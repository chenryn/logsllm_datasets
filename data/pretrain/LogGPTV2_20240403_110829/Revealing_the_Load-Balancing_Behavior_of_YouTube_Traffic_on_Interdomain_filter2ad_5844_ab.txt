**Link ID**
*Figure 2. Link usage probability of 6 probes. Each ISP employs at least two interdomain links to load balance the traffic to video caches. (Color figure online)*

### Geographic Location
The first factor to study is the relationship between the geographic location of probes and the use of interdomain links. Figure 1(a) shows that different probes in Comcast exhibited similar or dissimilar behavior in terms of link use. We investigated this sharing of interdomain links among probes.

To characterize this behavior, we computed a link usage probability vector, \( \text{Pb}_i >, \forall i \in L \), for each probe. We then performed agglomerative hierarchical clustering in Matlab, using squared Euclidean distance as a similarity measure between two vectors. We considered only Comcast monitors because interdomain links do not overlap across ISPs. Figure 3 shows the dendrogram of the resulting five clusters, which reflect the locations of the probes.

- The leftmost cluster (red) consists of 6 monitors in the Northeastern U.S.
- The second cluster (#30) is in the Southeastern U.S.
- The remaining three clusters are in northern central, southwest, and central areas of the U.S., respectively.

This clustering is consistent with the goal of reducing latency by routing requests across the nearest interconnection.

### Time of Day
Another important factor is the time of day, as ISPs or YouTube may employ different load balancing strategies during peak hours. We adopted the "7 p.m. to 11 p.m." definition of peak usage hours from the FCC Broadband America Report [11], and recomputed the link usage probability for peak and off-peak hours. The German ISP (Kabel) showed a significant difference in link usage probability between the two periods. Figure 4 shows the five interdomain links observed by probe #02. During off-peak hours, the five links were somewhat evenly utilized. In peak hours, only three of the five links were significantly used, with their link usage probability increasing by 5% to 15% relative to off-peak hours. For other ISPs, we did not find significant differences in link usage (not to be confused with utilization!) between peak and off-peak hours.

### Destination Google AS
According to [1], ISPs can establish peering with Google on two ASes—AS 15169 and AS 36040. The former is the most common option and can access all Google services and content, while the latter provides only the most popular content and is not available at all IXPs [1]. Table 3 shows the link usage probability according to the destination AS of the links. Values in brackets are the number of links in the respective categories.

| **Google AS** | **Comcast** | **Kabel** | **Italia** | **Free** |
|---------------|-------------|-----------|------------|----------|
| **15169**     | 0.99 (25)   | 0.76 (3)  | 0.16 (6)   | 0.04 (1) |
| **36040**     | 0.0001 (1)  | 0.24 (2)  | 0.84 (4)   | 0.94 (2) |
| **43515**     | 0           | 0         | 0          | 0.02 (1) |

- Comcast mostly connects users to Google with AS 15169.
- For the other three ISPs in Europe, load balancing with AS 36040 is more common.
- ISP Italia has more interdomain links peering with AS 15169 but accesses YouTube caches mainly using AS 36040. This arrangement could be for historical reasons, as AS 36040 was assigned to YouTube before the merger (the AS name is still 'YouTube').
- For the German ISP Kabel, we found that the links (Link ID 32 and 33) mostly used during off-peak hours (see Fig. 4) were peering with AS 36040, while the remaining three links were peering with AS 15169.

Interestingly, we found that ISP Free connected users to Google with AS 43515 between June 1, 2016, and August 17, 2016. Google currently manages this AS for its core network but not for peering purposes [1]. These YouTube test sessions were assigned to video caches with IP prefix (208.117.224.0/19), announced by AS 43515. We believe the purpose of this AS recently changed. Some video caches were still assigned to AS 43515 during that time period, but now no longer respond to ICMP ping, as other caches did. This example illustrates that ISPs may have different preferences in engineering traffic to and from Google ASes.

### Video Cache Assignment
YouTube primarily uses two techniques to load balance requests: DNS-based redirection and HTTP-based redirection. DNS-based redirection assigns users to a front-end server based on the DNS server making the query [8,10]. These front-end servers, apart from serving static web elements on youtube.com, are responsible for assigning users to video caches hosted under the domain *.googlevideo.com. In some cases, if the video content is not available in the assigned video cache (cache miss), Google uses HTTP-based redirection to redirect users to another cache using HTTP response status code 332.

We investigated whether the video caches selected by the front-end server considered the use of interdomain links. Our YouTube measurements captured more than 3,000 hostnames and IPs of video caches. The SamKnows probes resolved these hostnames with their default list of DNS servers during each YouTube measurement. We found that around 90% of the hostnames mapped to a single IP address, except for a special hostname (redirector.googlevideo.com) designed for handling cache misses. This result indicated that DNS-based redirection is not common for hostnames of Google’s video caches.

To study the mechanism of video cache selection, we compared video cache hostnames and IPs between any two probes. In Section 4.1, we described how user geographic location influences the selection of interdomain links. If Google uses video cache selection to engineer the desired use of specific interdomain links, the front-end servers will likely direct nearby probes to a similar set of caches. Figure 5 depicts the overlapping in video cache hostname/IP mappings for any two monitors, with probes (rows) sorted according to the clustering results in Fig. 3. The lower/upper triangular part of the matrix compares the hostnames/IPs collected by the two probes, respectively. The triangular symmetry reflects the largely one-to-one mapping between IPs and hostnames.

From the similarity in the use of interdomain links, we expect nearby probes (e.g., #32, #60, and #44) to share a similar set of video caches (i.e., many overlaps).
