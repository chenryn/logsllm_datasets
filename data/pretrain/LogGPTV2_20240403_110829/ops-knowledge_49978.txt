User: I just installed the envisagecore and envisageplugin in Ubuntu 10.04. I'm using Eclipse SDK and PyDev plugin. How can I import this plugin in Eclipse?
Assistant: I don't have access to the Envisage plugins documentation, so I'm not sure how these are installed. In general what you need to do is open Windows -> Preferences -> PyDev -> Interpreter - Python and check that the package directory is present in the System PYTHONPATH window. If it isn't add it and press Apply.
If your plugins are installed in a standard location, i.e. site-packages, another option is to remove your current interpreter from the upper window and press Auto Config.
