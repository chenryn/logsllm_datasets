## Extended Abstract: Enhancing Security in Trustworthy Systems through 3-D Integrated Hardware

### Introduction
Despite the abundance of transistors and microprocessor cores, economic constraints often prevent the integration of specialized hardware mechanisms required for secure processing into commodity parts. This paper explores a novel approach to augmenting commodity hardware post-fabrication to enhance security for systems that require it. Our methods are applicable to a wide range of security issues, including the detection and isolation of hardware subversion and Trojan horses, cache-based side channels in chip multi-processors (CMPs), embedded systems security, and hardware intrusion detection and prevention.

### Challenges in Commodity Hardware
Using off-the-shelf components to build trustworthy systems results in a constant struggle to provide separation, isolation, and protection. This challenge is exacerbated by the shift towards multi-core processors, where security functionality is often not a priority at the platform ISA or micro-architecture levels. Features such as resource sharing, which are included for performance, can be exploited by adversaries, compromising security. Without a significant change in how computing systems are constructed, unacceptable amounts of time and resources will be spent mitigating vulnerabilities introduced by new processor features.

### Proposed Solution
To address these challenges, we propose a radical transformation in the development and deployment of trustworthy systems. Our approach allows for direct hardware support for fine-grained control of the underlying system while still leveraging the performance and cost benefits of the latest commodity parts. We achieve this through the augmentation of commodity hardware with a 3-D integration approach.

### 3-D Integration Approach
Hardware manufacturers are reluctant to prioritize hardware support for trustworthy systems due to the significant resources and practical and theoretical problems involved. Incorporating strong security enhancements drives up costs and prolongs release schedules, which is unacceptable in the cost-sensitive desktop market. Our solution involves disentangling security mechanisms from the design and consolidating them onto a separate layer of circuitry, called a control plane, which is stacked on top of a commodity integrated circuit (the computation plane).

The control plane can be connected to the computation plane using die-stacking technologies, but it can also be left unattached, allowing the manufacturer to sell the un-enhanced product at a lower cost. 3-D stacking technology, already being explored by major microprocessor manufacturers, uses techniques such as through-silicon vias (TSVs) to interconnect multiple active layers.

### Applications and Benefits
This work has the potential to impact all levels of the system stack, from application software down to circuits and packaging. Various challenges need to be addressed at each layer for this approach to be successful. For example, the control plane's ability to enforce policies depends on circuit-level capabilities for monitoring and restricting activity if needed. The challenge is to ensure that the computation plane remains fully functional even when some functionality is disabled by the control plane. Another challenge is integrating different technology nodes, such as a 130nm process for the control plane and a 45nm process for the computation plane.

Our approach can enhance commodity hardware with application-specific security functionality, addressing a wide range of hardware security issues:

- **Cache-Based Side Channels in CMPs**: We intercept and manage traffic destined for the cache-bus, forcing signals to take a detour to the control plane, where a cache manager mediates access.
- **Isolation of Untrusted Software**: Using posts from the control plane, we disable specific wires in the computation plane to cut connections that violate isolation requirements. The control plane can also mediate the interaction of cores and other system resources.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: The control plane can monitor and log interactions of cores, providing protection for configurable hardware audit mechanisms and secure storage of audit records. It can detect hardware intrusions, subversions, Trojans, and information leakage.
- **Object Reuse Mechanism**: The control plane clears the sensitive state of a core between tasks, sanitizing both intra- and inter-core shared resources. It can also configure and initialize computation plane cores.
- **High-Integrity Data Tagging Schemes**: The control plane can implement various data tagging schemes, such as security classification tags, provenance tags, and persistent memory tags.

### Conclusion
Current trends in building trustworthy systems on increasingly complex and less understood hardware make such systems costly to deploy and maintain. Our research introduces a fundamentally new method for incorporating security mechanisms into hardware, potentially shifting the economics of trustworthy systems. With our approach, trustworthy systems can be built quickly using unmodified commodity processors equipped with a customized control plane that provides configurable, application-specific security functionality.
