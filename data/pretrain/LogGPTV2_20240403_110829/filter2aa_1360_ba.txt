### Indexed Media Files
Previously, search engines like Google and Bing indexed media files by type, such as MP3, MP4, and AVI. However, due to misuse, this functionality no longer works effectively. The following extensions can still be indexed and provide useful results:
- **PPT, PPTX**: PowerPoint Presentations
- **DOC, DOCX, ODT**: Word Documents
- **XLS, XLSX, ODS**: Excel Spreadsheets
- **PDF**: Portable Document Format

### Search Operators for Inclusion and Exclusion
- **Inclusion**: Use specific file types with the `filetype:` operator.
- **Exclusion**: Use the hyphen `-` to exclude certain text from search results. Ensure there is no space between the hyphen and the excluded text.

#### Example Searches
1. **Finding Resumes**:
   - `filetype:doc "resume" "target name"`: This search often reveals resumes that include personal information like phone numbers, addresses, and work history.

2. **Combining `filetype` and `site`**:
   - `filetype:pdf site:irongeek.com`: This finds all PDF files on a specific domain.

3. **Filtering by Content**:
   - `filetype:ppt "Cisco"`: Finds older PPT files containing "Cisco".
   - `filetype:pptx "Cisco"`: Finds newer PPTX files containing "Cisco".

4. **Combining Multiple Searches**:
   - `filetype:ppt "Cisco"`: 15,200 results.
   - `filetype:pptx "Cisco"`: 12,700 results.
   - Total: Over 27,000 PowerPoint files.

5. **Further Filtering**:
   - `filetype:pptx "Cisco Confidential"`: Focuses on more relevant content.

### Advanced Search Techniques
#### InURL Operator
- `inurl:ftp -inurl:(http|https) filetype:pdf "osint"`: Finds FTP servers with PDFs containing "osint".

#### InTitle Operator
- `intitle:"osint video training"`: Finds pages titled "osint video training".
- `allintitle:training osint video`: Finds pages where "training," "osint," and "video" appear in the title in any order.

#### OR Operator
- `"Michael Bazzell" OR "Mike Bazzell" OSINT`: Returns pages with either "Michael Bazzell" or "Mike Bazzell" and "OSINT".

#### Range Operator
- `"bonnie woodward" "1..999 comments"`: Finds pages about Bonnie Woodward with 1 to 999 comments.

#### Asterisk Operator
- `osint * training`: Finds phrases starting with "osint" followed by any word(s) and ending with "training".

#### Related Operator
- `related:inteltechniques.com`: Finds sites related to inteltechniques.com.

### Customizing Google Search
#### Dated Results
- **Custom Date Range**:
  - `&tbs=cdr:1,cd_min:1/1/0`: Adds a custom date range to your search URL.

#### Google Programmable Search Engines
- **Creating a Custom Search Engine**:
  1. Log in to a Google account.
  2. Navigate to programmablesearchengine.google.com.
  3. Create a new search engine.
  4. Add websites to search (e.g., `inteltechniques.com`, `inteltechniques.net`).
  5. Name and create the engine.
  6. Embed the search engine or use the public URL.

#### Adding Refinements
- **Refinement Options**:
  - **Give Priority**: Emphasizes matching rules but includes other sites if minimal results.
  - **Search Only**: Restricts results to specified sites.

- **Example Refinements**:
  - Social Networks: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, Tumblr.
  - Assign each refinement to its respective website.

### Real-World Application
- **Missing Person Case**:
  - Set search tools to show results up to the date of disappearance.
  - Focus on content posted before the disappearance was public.

### Summary
By using advanced search operators and creating custom search engines, you can efficiently filter and find relevant information. These techniques are particularly useful for OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) and privacy-related investigations.
