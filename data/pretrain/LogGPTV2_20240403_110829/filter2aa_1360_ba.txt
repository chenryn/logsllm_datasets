Previously, Google and Bing indexed media files by type, such as MP3, MP4, AVI, and others. Due to abuse of

The search operators mentioned previously are filters to include specific data. Instead, you may want to exclude 
some content from appearing within results. The hyphen (-) tells most search engines and social networks to 
exclude the text immediately following from any results. It is important to never include a space between the 
hyphen and filtered text. The following searches were conducted on my own name with the addition of excluded 
text. Following each search is the number of results returned by Google.
The result is exactly 1,080 PowerPoint files of interest. There are many uses for this technique. A search of 
filetype:doc "resume" "target name" often provides resumes created by the target which can include cellular 
telephone numbers, personal addresses, work history, education information, references, and other personal 
information that would never be intentionally posted to the internet. The "filetype" operator can identify any 
file by the file type within any website. This can be combined with the "site" operator to find all files of any type 
on a single domain. By conducting the following searches, I was able to find several documents stored on the 
website irongeek.com.
The result is 15,200 Microsoft PowerPoint presentations that contain Cisco within the content. This search only 
located the older PowerPoint format of PPT, but not newer files that may have the PPTX extension. Therefore, 
the following two searches would be more thorough.

The second search provided an additional 12,700 files. This brings our total to over 27,000 PowerPoint files, 
which is overwhelming. I will begin to further filter my results in order to focus on the most relevant content 
for my research. The following search will display only newer PowerPoint files that contain the exact phrase 
Cisco Confidential within the content of the slides.
InURL Operator
inurkftp -inurl(http | https) filetype:pdf "osint"
The following will dissect how and why this search worked.
inurkftp - Instructs Google to only display addresses that contain "ftp" in the URL.
filetyperpdf- Instructs Google to only display PDF documents.
"osint" - Instructs Google to mandate that the exact term osint is within the content of results.
InTitle Operator

The final search eliminated results which included any of the restricted words. The pages that were 
referenced other people with my name. My goal in search filters is to dwindle the total results to a 
amount. When you are overwhelmed with search results, slowly add exclusions to make an impact on the amount 
of data to analyze.
Obviously, this operator could also be used to locate standard web pages, documents, and files. The following 
search displays only blog posts from intekechniques.com that exist within a folder titled "blog" (WordPress).
Note that the use of quotation marks prevents the query from searching "video training" within websites tided 
"osint". The quotes force the search of pages specifically tided "osint video training". You can add "all" to this 
search to force all listed words to appear in any order. The following would find any sites that have the words 
osint, video, and training within the tide, regardless of the order.
We can also specify operators that wall focus only on the data within the URL or address of the website. 
Previously, the operators discussed applied to the content within die web page. My favorite search using this 
technique is to find File Transfer Protocol (FTP) servers that allow anonymous connections. The following 
search would identify any FTP servers that possess PDF files that contain the term OSINT within the file.
-inurl(http | https) - Instructs Google to ignore any addresses that contain either http or https in the URL. The 
separator is the pipe symbol (|) located above the backslash key. It tells Google "OR". This would make sure 
that we excluded any standard web pages.
Similar to InURL, the "InTide" operator will filter web pages by details other than the actual content of the 
page. This filter will only present web pages that have specific content within the tide of the page. Practically 
every’ web page on the internet has an official tide for the page. This is often included within the source code of 
the page and may not appear anywhere within the content. Most webmasters carefully create a tide that will be 
best indexed by search engines. If you conduct a search for "osint video training" on Google, you will receive 
2,760 results. However, the following search will filter those to 5. These only include web pages that had the 
search terms within the limited space of a page tide.

You may have search terms that are not definitive. You may have a target that has a unique last name that is 
often misspelled. The "OR" (uppercase) operator returns pages that have just A, just B, or both A and B. 
Consider the following examples which include the number of results each.
This option has been proven to be very useful over the past year. It collects a domain, and attempts to provide 
online content related to that address. As an example, 1 conducted a search on Google with the following syntax.
"Michael Bazzell" OSINT 61,200
"Mike Bazzell" OSINT 1,390
"Michael Bazzell" OR "Mike Bazzell" OSINT 18,600
"Michael Bazell" OR "Mike Bazell" OSINT 1,160
"Michael Bazzel" OR "Mike Bazzel" OSINT 582
The "Range Operator" tells Google to search between two identifiers. These could be sequential numbers or 
years. As an example, OSINT Training 2015..2018 would result in pages that include the terms OSINT and 
training, and also include any number between 2015 and 2018.1 have used this to filter results for online news 
articles that include a commenting system where readers can express their views. The following search identifies 
websites that contain information about Bonnie Woodward, a missing person, and between 1 and 999 comments 
within the page.
The asterisk (*) represents one or more words to Google and is considered a wild card. Google treats the * as a 
placeholder for a word or words within a search string. For example, "osint * training" tells Google to find pages 
containing a phrase that starts with "osint" followed by one or more words, followed by "training". Phrases that 
fit this search include: "osint video training" and "osint live classroom training".
The results contain online folders that usually do not have typical website files within the folders. The first three 
results of this search identified the following publicly available online data folders. Each possess dozens of 
documents and other files related to our search term of OSINT. One provides a folder structure that allows 
access to an entire web server of content. Notice that none of these results points to a specific page, but all open 
a folder view of the data present.

/\n interesting way to use this search technique is while searching for online folders. We often focus on finding 
websites or files of interest, but we tend to ignore the presence of online folders full of content related to our 
search. As an example, I conducted the following search on Google.

The results included no references to that domain, but did associate it with my other websites, my Twitter page,

website into several social networks and friends' websites.

nee OSINT Training by Michael Bazzell.
Real World Application: Whenever I was assigned a missing person case, 1 immediately searched the internet. 
By the time the case is assigned, many media websites had reported on the incident and social networks were 
full of sympathetic comments toward the family. In order to avoid this traffic, I set the search tools to only show 
results up to the date of disappearance. I could then focus on the online content posted about the victim before 
the disappearance was public. This often led to more relevant suspect leads.
Google can be very sporadic when it comes to supplying date information within search results. Sometimes you 
will see the date that a search result was added to the Google index and sometimes you will not. This can be 
frustrating when you desire this information in order to identify relevant results. There is a fairly unknown 
technique that will force Google to always show you the date of each search result.
There is a text bar at the top of ever}’ Google search result page. This allows for searching the current search 
terms within other Google sendees such as Images, Maps, Shopping, Videos, and others. The last option on this 
bar is the "Tools" link. Clicking this link will present a new row of options directly below. This provides new 
filters to help you focus only on the desired results. The filters will vary for each type of Google search. Figure 
9.01 displays the standard search tools with the time menu expanded.
The "Any time" drop-down menu will allow you to choose the time range of visible search results. The default 
is set to "Any time" which will not filter any results. Selecting "Past hour" will only display results that have been 
indexed within the hour. The other options for day, week, month, and year work the same way. The last option 
is "Custom range". This will present a pop-up window that will allow you to specify the exact range of dates that 
you want searched. This can be helpful when you want to analyze online content posted within a known time.
When you modify the "Any Time" option under the Search Tools menu, you will always see a date next to each 
result. If you are only searching for recent information, this solves the issue. However, if you are conducting a 
standard search without a specific date reference, the dates next to each result are missing. To remedy this, you

Notice that the result now has the date when the content was first indexed by Google. You can also now sort 
these results by date in order to locate the most recent information. The search tools menu also offers an "All 
results" menu that will allow you to choose to see "all results" or "Verbatim". The All Results will conduct a 
standard Google search. The Verbatim option searches exactly what you typed. One benefit of the Verbatim 
option is that Google will often present more results than the standard search. It digs a little deeper and gives 
additional results based on the exact terms you provided.

Now that you are ready7 to unleash the power of Google, you may’ want to consider creating your own custom 
search engines, which Google has rebranded to Programmable Search Engines. Google allows you to specify 
the exact type of searches that you want to conduct, and then create an individual search engine just for your 
needs. Many specialty’ websites that claim to search only social network content are simply using a custom engine

This basic functionalin’ can be quite powerful. It is the method behind my custom Pastebin search engine 
discussed in a later chapter. In that example, I created a custom search engine that scoured dozens of specific 
websites in order to retrieve complete information about specific topics. This is only die first layer of a Google 
custom search engine. Google offers an additional element to its custom engines. This new layer, labeled 
Refinements, allows you to specify multiple actions within one custom search engine. The best way to explain 
this is to offer two unique examples.
After you log in to a Google account, navigate to the website listed above. If you have never created an engine, 
you will be prompted to create your first. Enter the first website that you want to search. In my example, I will 
search inteltechniques.com. As you enter any website to search, Google will automatically create another field 
to enter an additional website. The second website that I will search is inteltechniques.net. Provide a name for 
your custom engine and select "Create". You now have a custom search engine. You can either embed this 
search engine into a website or view the public URL to access it from within any web browser.
from Google. For our first example, we will create a basic custom search engine that only searches two specific 
websites.
For the first example, I wanted to create a custom search engine that allowed us to search several social networks. 
Additionally, we will isolate the results from each network across several tabs at the top of our search results. 
The first step will be to create a new custom search engine by clicking "New search engine" in the left menu. 
Instead of specifying the two websites mentioned earlier, we will identify’ the websites to be searched as the 
following.
While this is not a complete list of active social networks, it represents the most [.  r .
time of this writing. At this point, our custom search engine would search only these websites and provide all 
results integrated into one search result page. We now want to add refinements that will allow us to isolate the 
results from each social network.
When each refinement is created, you will have two options of how the search will be refined. The option of
