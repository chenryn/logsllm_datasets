## Abstract
Adult content is a significant contributor to Internet traffic. Like other platforms, adult websites aim to engage and retain users, often through recommendations that shape user journeys. Using data from a large content delivery network (CDN), we analyze session journeys on an adult video portal. Our study takes two perspectives: first, we examine the available content corpus, and second, we investigate session access patterns. We make several observations that could inform optimization strategies, such as users frequently skipping within video streams.

## 1. Introduction
The Internet has evolved from a web-oriented infrastructure to a distributed content delivery system. Video content, particularly adult content, has become increasingly popular. While there have been studies on various types of video content, such as user-generated content (UGC), video on demand (VoD), Internet TV (IPTV), and catch-up TV, there is still limited understanding of the unique workload and access patterns of adult video portals. This paper presents a large-scale analysis of a major adult website, focusing on how individual viewer decisions impact the CDN workload.

To achieve this, we use two key datasets:
1. A dataset from a large CDN, covering one hour of access logs with 20.08 million records, 62,000 users, and 3.28 TB of data.
2. Metadata scraped from the website, including content categories and upload dates.

We explore three aspects:
1. The corpus and workload served by the platform (Section 4).
2. Per-session access patterns (Section 5).
3. Implications for content delivery (Section 6).

## 2. Background and Related Work
Pornography is among the most searched-for content online. Despite its taboo nature in some research fields, there has been growing interest in studying adult video platforms. Recent work has examined the content corpus and workloads of these sites, as well as their impact on the broader Internet. Studies have also explored related topics such as privacy, automated recognition, recommendation systems, and security issues.

This paper provides one of the first large-scale analyses of an online adult multimedia delivery service. While there are numerous studies on traditional video streaming systems, the lack of data on adult video access makes it challenging to apply existing technologies. This study aims to provide insights into the session-level specifics of adult content access patterns.

## 3. Methodology and Data
Our analysis relies on two key datasets:
1. **CDN Data:** Access logs from a major adult video website, collected over one hour.
2. **Web Scrape Data:** Metadata about each video, including categories and upload dates.

### 3.1 CDN Data
#### Data Description
The CDN data, collected in 2019, includes 20.08 million access entries. Each log entry contains:
- **Timestamp:** Time of the request.
- **Client ID:** Anonymized IP address.
- **Resource:** Web resource requested.
- **User Agent:** Identifies the client's device and browser.
- **HTTP Referrer:** URL the client was redirected from.
- **City ID:** Geolocation of the client, with an estimated accuracy of less than 20 km.

#### Identifying Sessions
We map requests to sessions using a SHA256 hash of the IP address, device, and browser. The data covers 62,000 unique user sessions. Incomplete sessions, defined as those with requests within the first or last 5 minutes of the trace, are removed, accounting for 15% of the data.

### 3.2 Web Scrape Data
The CDN logs provide detailed access patterns but lack metadata. Therefore, we scrape metadata from the website for each video, including category, view count, likes/dislikes, and hashtags. We gathered metadata for 4.9 million videos, covering 91.1% of the videos in the CDN traces.

### 3.3 Ethical Considerations and Limitations
#### Limitations
- The short duration of the trace data limits our ability to make generalizable statements, especially regarding longitudinal trends.
- The data only covers a single portal from one data center, limiting our ability to generalize to other deployments.

#### Ethical Considerations
- The logs were fully anonymized by the CDN before we received them.
- Sensitive data, such as content category tags, were further anonymized.
- Pre-processing was done by one author, who did not perform the subsequent analysis.
- All data was stored securely with restricted access.
- IRB approval was obtained.

## 4. Characterization of Corpus and Workload
We begin by characterizing the corpus and overall site workloads observed at the CDN.

### Resource Type
Typical adult video sites include a variety of media types. Figure 1a shows the fraction of requests to each resource type, revealing that:

[Figure 1a: Fraction of Requests to Each Resource Type]

Despite the prominence of image content, primarily thumbnails, the majority of bytes served are for video content due to its voluminous nature. Videos tend to be relatively short, with subtle variations across categories. Popularity is highly skewed, with the top 10% of videos contributing 73.7% of all accesses.

[Further details and figures can be added as needed.]
