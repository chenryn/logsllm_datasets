Numpy tried to convert an infinite list to numpy.ndarray and I never stopped.  
This problem occurs when an array appended with itself more than once.
### Example:
    from numpy import asarray as ar
    #from numpy import array as ar
    a = []
    #Range must be more than 1.
    for i in range(2):
        a.append(a)
    #This line does not stop.
    print(ar(a))
### Numpy/Python version information:
np. **version** : 1.16.5  
Python: 3.7.4
