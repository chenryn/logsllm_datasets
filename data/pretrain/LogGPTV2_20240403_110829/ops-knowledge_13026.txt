Question: "An application security specialist argues that traditional checks for the presence of x86 / x64 architecture in mobile applications are no longer sufficient due to the widespread availability of Apple Silicon (ARM) hardware. What would be a strong counterargument supporting the need for enhanced emulator detection strategies?"
 "A": "Apple Silicon hardware is incapable of running emulators, thus making traditional checks obsolete."
 "B": "Emulators running on Apple Silicon could mimic ARM architecture, thus bypassing traditional architecture checks."
 "C": "Traditional checks are sufficient because all emulators are detectable through their lack of support for GPU hardware emulation."
 "D": "The presence of x86 / x64 architecture is a foolproof method of emulator detection and requires no further analysis."
Answer: B
