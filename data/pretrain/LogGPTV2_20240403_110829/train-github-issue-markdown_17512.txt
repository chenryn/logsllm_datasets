Subject: Request for Portable Atom Installation Option

Dear Atom Team,

I am a student currently facing an issue with installing and using Atom on my school's computers, as I do not have root access. I was wondering if there is a way to download a standalone binary version of Atom, similar to what Sublime Text offers. This would greatly facilitate the use of Atom for me and potentially for others who wish to run it from a portable device such as a USB drive.

Additionally, this request may be related to or could complement the discussion in issue #2939.

Thank you for considering this suggestion. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
