Question: "A developer is reviewing the error handling configuration for an ASP.NET web application to ensure that sensitive information is not exposed to users when an error occurs. Which of the following configurations would be most appropriate for securing the web application against information leakage through error messages?"
 "A": "Set <customErrors mode='Off' />, to ensure that all users receive the same error page without any sensitive information."
 "B": "Set <customErrors mode='On' defaultRedirect='GenericErrorPage.htm' />, to redirect users to a custom error page that does not expose sensitive information."
 "C": "Set <customErrors mode='RemoteOnly' />, so that remote users receive a generic error page, while local users can see detailed stack traces for debugging."
 "D": "Avoid using <customErrors> tag and rely on the server's default error handling, which is guaranteed to be secure."
Answer: B
