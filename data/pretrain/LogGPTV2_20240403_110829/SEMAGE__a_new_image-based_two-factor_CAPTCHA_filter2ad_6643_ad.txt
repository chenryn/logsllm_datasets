### Table 1: Average Time Taken per Challenge for Each System (in Seconds)
- **Semage**: 11.64
- **Asirra**: 17.35
- **reCAPTCHA**: 11.05

### Timing Distribution Analysis
The distribution plots in Figure 9 show that most users of Semage completed each challenge in approximately 11.64 seconds or less, while the average time for Asirra was significantly higher, with most users taking around 17.35 seconds. The consistency and uniformity in the majority of the data points indicate that the timing averages were not significantly affected by outliers, thus representing the general user behavior.

### Comparison with reCAPTCHA
Interestingly, the average time taken to solve a Semage challenge is nearly identical to that of reCAPTCHA. This is somewhat unexpected, as we anticipated that solving Semage challenges would be slower due to the novelty of the system compared to the well-established text-based CAPTCHAs. This suggests that Semage is user-friendly and easy to use.

### Factors Affecting Time
- **Asirra**: Requires more images per challenge, leading to longer completion times. This is necessary for security, given the limited number of differentiating classes (cats and dogs).
- **Semage**: Involves relating two or more images, which could be more time-consuming. However, the timing data indicates that Semage challenges are easier than expected, likely due to the natural cognitive abilities of humans.

### Accuracy Statistics
- **Total Correct Attempts**: The total number of correct attempts for Semage is higher than for Asirra, indicating that users can solve Semage challenges more accurately.
- **Familiarity and Comfort Level**: Users who rated themselves as "less comfortable" with CAPTCHAs (rating 3 or less) still showed high accuracy with Semage and reCAPTCHA, but lower accuracy with Asirra.

### Correct Attempts Ratio (C.A.R.)
- **Semage**: 0.94
- **Asirra**: 0.91

The C.A.R. is the number of correct attempts divided by the total attempts, signifying how often a human passes the challenge. A ratio closer to 1 indicates better usability. The user study data shows that Semage has a higher C.A.R. than Asirra, and the difference between Semage and reCAPTCHA is negligible. This, combined with the timing data, suggests that Semage has a higher usability factor than the current state-of-the-art image-based system (Asirra).

### Fun Factor and Ease of Use
After completing challenges from the three systems, users were asked to rate Semage and Asirra on fun and ease of use:
- **Fun Factor**:
  - 58.92% of users rated Semage as more fun (ratings 4 and 5).
  - 16.07% rated Asirra as more fun (ratings 1 and 2).
  - The rest considered them equally fun.
- **Ease of Use**:
  - 72.61% of users rated Semage as easier (ratings 4 and 5).
  - 10.72% rated Asirra as easier (ratings 1 and 2).
  - 16.66% considered both systems equally easy.

These metrics, along with the timing and accuracy results, clearly demonstrate that Semage is a highly user-friendly CAPTCHA system.

### Limitations and Future Work
- **Database Generation**: Creating a large and accurate database for image-based CAPTCHAs is challenging. Our implementation involved web crawling to gather and label images, but manual filtering was required to remove irrelevant or objectionable content. This process is time-consuming and poses a problem for regular updates.
- **Legal Issues**: There may be legal concerns with using crawled images directly.
- **Future Work**: Further research is needed to develop an automated method for creating a large, correct database to allow widespread deployment in real-world applications.

### Conclusion
In this paper, we introduced SEMAGE, a CAPTCHA system that uses semantic relationships between images. Users are presented with a set of candidate images and must choose those that fit a certain relation. This design leverages both semantic understanding and visual-cognitive tasks, providing double protection against bot attacks. SEMAGE is easy to understand and interact with, offering a customizable solution for website administrators. It can be particularly useful for touch-based devices and e-commerce platforms, where it can serve both security and promotional purposes.
