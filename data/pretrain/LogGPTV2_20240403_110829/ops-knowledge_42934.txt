Question: "After reviewing a security event log with ID 6144 on a Windows system, an administrator notes the GPO List contains an entry formatted as '8AB9311A-E5FB-4A5A-8FB7-027D1B877D6D DC Main Policy'. What can the administrator infer about the applied Group Policy Objects, and how can they verify the specific policy if further investigation is needed?"
 "A": "The GUID in the GPO List represents a Globally Unique Identifier that can be verified using the Get-GPO PowerShell cmdlet with the '-Name' parameter."
 "B": "The entry in the GPO List is a random string and does not relate to the actual policy applied, and thus no action is required."
 "C": "The administrator should trigger an alert as the GUID indicates an unauthorized modification to the DC Main Policy."
 "D": "The GUID in the GPO List must be cross-referenced with external security databases to verify the legitimacy of the applied policy."
Answer: A
