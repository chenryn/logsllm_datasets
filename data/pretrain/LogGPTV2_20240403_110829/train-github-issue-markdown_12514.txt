This issue is similar to the issue #3283, which actually proposed exactly the
same feature. I'm creating a new issue to bring attention back to this
feature.
It seems useful to be able to run only single task from a playbook. It can be
achieved by defining a tag in 'roles' section of the playbook. However this
approach has drawback: in every playbook where we will use the role we will
have to define the same tag (which may clutter the playbook and introduces
duplication).
Implicit tag defined for each of the roles could be a option. Nice I think,
since being able to run only selected role(s) seems to be useful. But it can
also be considered as little mysterious. Maybe it would be better to introduce
'--roles' parameter to ansible-playbook CLI instead.
The other option could be ability to define tags for a role in the role itself
(instead of in the playbook). It could be done i.e. by extending role's
meta/main.yml file by adding section 'tags' to it (next to 'dependencies')
which would define role's tags. The tags defined in meta could sum up with the
tags defined in playbook.  
This way we could avoid duplication and avoid introducing the implicit tag.
