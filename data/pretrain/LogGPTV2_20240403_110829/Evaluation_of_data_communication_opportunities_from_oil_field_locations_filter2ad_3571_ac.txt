Figure 6: Interruptions on cellular link availability at WIL1
In the meanwhile, interruptions on those wireless links
caused by weak signal can be very frequent. We present cel-
lular link’s availability from data collected at WIL1 during
August in Figure 6. In this month, over 1100 interruptions
occurred with a peak rate of more than 10 times per hour.
Overall, data access from ﬁeld location to the Internet
is a delay-tolerant network scenario [24]. Applications run-
ning over these data links at ﬁeld locations should include
disruption/delay-tolerance features to handle intermittent
link availability as mentioned in [3].

Figure 7: CDF of average TCP throughput
There were 200 to 1000 FTP uploads via Verizon’s cel-
lular links in each SLA crew during April 2011. Another
2000 FTP uploads were ﬁnished in data set SLA1 ATT. In
addition, a BGAN link was used for more than 600 FTP
uploads from SLA1 crew from October 2010 to November
2010. No FTP upload was conducted on VSAT link in our
measurement study since this link is strictly managed and
only business applications with recorded and approved band-
width consumption proﬁle may access it.
Figure 7 illustrates Cumulative density functions (CDFs)
of average TCP throughput in those data sets. We notice
the signiﬁcant variation on average TCP throughput over
cellular links. This is caused by ﬂuctuation of signal quality
as ﬁeld locations are normally far from cellular towers or by
contentions of spectrum usage, which will be discussed later
in this section. Verizon’s cellular service provides higher
maximum achievable uplink speed (500kbps) than AT&T’s
(250kbps) but is associated with bigger variations. The av-
erage TCP throughput is stable over the BGAN link as it is
tightly managed and has less background traﬃc ﬂuctuation
due to limited accesses.
Temporal correlation/predication of TCP throughput over
wireless links in small time scales of tens of seconds are in-
vestigated in previous work [2, 4]. We are interested in aver-
age TCP throughput over cellular links and we conduct our
study in a much larger time scale.
We show the average TCP throughput of each upload from
the SLA1 ATT data set according to the hour when it starts
in Figure 8a. Each dot represents one average TCP through-
put measured at a certain hour. We also draw the range
bounded by 5 percentile and 95 percentile of all values at
each hour. Although 5% to 95% ranges are similar across
diﬀerent hours as link quality ﬂuctuates all the time, the
25% to 75% range is narrow which indicates that a signiﬁ-
cant portion of TCP throughput measurements at each hour
are around the median value.
Average TCP throughput is generally low during busy
hours of the day and high otherwise. We believe this is re-

lated to contention of spectrum usage towards the cellular
tower from other cellular devices at the same ﬁeld location
or the diurnal congestion on cellular service providers’ back-
bone. As median values change signiﬁcantly from hour to
hour, collecting statistics for each hour of the day would help
TCP throughput predication in the same hour of the day.
Similar hourly-shifted pattern can be found in Figure 8b,
which illustrates results from the data set consists of over
6000 TCP throughput measurements over Verizon’s service
from SLA1 to 4 in April and May, 2011.
4.2.3 End-to-end Latency
End-to-end latency is the link metric which essentially af-
fects TCP stack’s performance and determines service qual-
ity experienced by many applications. To collect measure-
ment of this metric, ping packets are sent over SLA1-4’s
cellular link and VSAT link periodically with an interval of
5 minutes and 15 minutes respectively. Ping packets are also
sent over SLA4’s BGAN link with an interval of 15 minutes.
Figure 9 shows those measurements in August 2011. Note
that VSAT link’s end-to-end latency is stable around 500 ms.
In the meanwhile, the latency on BGAN link is signiﬁcantly
longer with a lower bound of 1000 ms and 80% measure-
ment results are around 2000 ms. Compared with satellite
links, cellular links have a better lower bound around 200
(b) Measurements over cellular links

ms. However, measurements of latency on cellular links are
heavy-tailed which means long end-to-end latency may oc-
cur from time to time.
Although BGAN and cellular links may have higher avail-
ability than the VSAT link according to previous discus-
sions, they might not be used by applications having a tight
latency requirement. On the one hand, this indicates mul-
tiple network interfaces should be jointly used to provide
eﬀective data communication at remote areas; on the other
hand, signiﬁcant diﬀerences on end-to-end latency charac-
teristics could make the link management a challenging task
as one more criteria should be evaluated besides the cost
and availability mentioned in previous discussion. Further-
more, an application’s data communication may switch be-
tween diﬀerent interfaces when availability interruptions oc-
cur. Whether we should make TCP stack aware of such
latency discrepancy in advance so that a faster rate adjust-
ment can be achieved is being evaluated and will be reported
in future study.
5. SUMMARY AND FUTURE WORK
We conducted a coverage evaluation in a certain region of
the United States in 2010 to conﬁrm the expanding presence
of cellular data services in remote areas. Due to the distance
from test locations to cellular towers and possibly unfavor-
able terrestrial conditions, variations in service coverage and
data link speed are high. Spatial diversity using two anten-
nas provides improvements over cellular link’s speed, but
there was no coverage diﬀerence in our study. Encouraged
122by overall good coverage of cellular service, we conducted
comprehensive ﬁeld tests with ﬁve oil ﬁeld operation crews
at the diﬀerent geographical region in 2011. We evaluated
communication opportunities provided by satellite and cel-
lular links in this study of a total over 300 days.
At certain regions, the cellular data link shows compara-
ble availability to satellite links which were once deemed as
the only solution for accessing the Internet at remote ar-
eas. This indicates a potential operational cost reduction
from replacing the satellite link with a more cost-eﬀective
cellular data link or developing network policy to manage
those data links with ﬁnancial consideration. We also no-
tice that the operational pattern of the ﬁeld crew may aﬀect
data links’ availability over time. Delay-tolerance capability
is desirable for potential applications using those links due
to intermittent availability at ﬁeld locations. Average TCP
throughput on cellular links shifts according to the hour of
the day.
We are selecting crews operating at other districts in the
United States to extend our measurement study to other ge-
ographical regions. In addition, we will provide more com-
prehensive characterization on those data links at a ﬁner
time granularity. For example, end-to-end latency or jit-
ter performance will be measured so that we are able to
evaluate possibilities of introducing more interactive appli-
cations such as real-time collaborations between oﬃce and
ﬁeld locations.
Interaction between TCP/UDP stack and
link characteristics will be investigated for potential “tun-
ing” of the transport layer for performance improvements
over those links.
