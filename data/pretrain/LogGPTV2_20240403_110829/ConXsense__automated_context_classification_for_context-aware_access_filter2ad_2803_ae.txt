Apex [28], which extends the Android operating system with
conditional permissions.
It provides to some extent sup-
port for context-based access control by allowing the user to
deﬁne context-dependent resource restrictions (e.g., based
on the time of day). All of these works heavily rely on
user- or pre-deﬁned rules, whereas our work relies on dy-
namic context classiﬁcation utilizing machine learning as a
source for access control enforcement. Also, in contrast to
MOSES, TrustDroid and Apex, our access control architec-
ture is based on the more generic and ﬂexible FlaskDroid
platform [7], which is also able to cover (most of) the use
cases described in Saint.
A recent patent application by Bell et al. [5] discloses a
system using context-triggered policies controlling the access
of applications to sensors and other resources on a smart-
phone. Also their approach relies on either pre-deﬁned poli-
cies or policies uploaded to the devices by external entities.
Addressing the problem of more usable user authentica-
tion on mobile devices, Riva et al. [31] use various contex-
tual clues to (partially) authenticate the user by estimating
the likelihood that the user is in proximity and use this in-
formation to conﬁgure the device lock. Similarly, Hayashi
et al. [19] introduce Context-Aware Scalable Authentication,
an approach which uses the location of the device in a prob-
abilistic framework to determine the active authentication
factors to be used for user authentication (e.g., PIN or pass-
word) on smartphones. Although we cover a similar use
case as these papers, our approach is very diﬀerent. We do
not authenticate the user, but rather adjust device locking
behavior based on automatic classiﬁcation of the context
according to its perceived risk level.
Kang et al. [22] introduced the idea of time-based cluster-
ing of position observations, which Zheng et al. [46] used to
introduce the concepts of stay points and stay regions, fur-
ther developed by Montoliu et al. [26]. We adopt a slightly
modiﬁed form of the notion of stay regions to deﬁne our
GPS-based CoIs. In addition, we also extend the notion of
a stay points to non-locational data in the form of WiFi stay
points. Dousse et al. [14] have successfully demonstrated the
use of WiFi ﬁngerprints for identifying and detecting places
based on WiFi. We adopt a simpliﬁed version of their place
identiﬁcation scheme considering only intersections of WiFi
snapshots for our WiFi-based CoI detection.
302Gupta et al. [17] were the ﬁrst to use context proﬁling
and the notion of CoI and device familiarity for estimat-
ing the ’safety’ level of a context. Their system relied on a
simple heuristic model based on time-discounted familiarity
measures and suﬀered from having to specify a ﬁxed thresh-
old for distinguishing between context classes, which fails
to take into account context- and user speciﬁc diﬀerences.
Since we apply a sophisticated context model and more pow-
erful machine learning models for context classiﬁcation, our
approach is capable to take better into account also context-
and user-speciﬁc diﬀerences in perceptions of risk level and
privacy exposure.
11. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we described ConXsense, a context-aware
access control framework for mobile devices utilizing au-
tomated classiﬁcation of contexts based on sensed context
data. We applied it to two concrete smartphone-related
use cases: defending against sensory malware and device
misuse. We showed that context classiﬁcation can be used
for context-aware access control enforcement, eﬀectively ad-
dressing true security concerns that smartphone users have.
In this, however, we do not see the task merely as a predic-
tion problem, but rather we consider true contextuality as
a continuous process of learning from and adapting to the
individual needs and preferences of smartphone users.
Having validated the eﬀectiveness of ConXsense, the next
step is to evaluate its usability. We plan to implement on-
device versions of the Proﬁler and Classiﬁer and create a mo-
bile app for user studies focusing on the usability aspects
related to our framework. We intend also to develop further
richer context models incorporating more context sensors,
and addressing other context-aware access control use cases.
