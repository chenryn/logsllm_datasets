Question: "A Windows system administrator needs to enhance the security of enterprise web applications by ensuring that communications with certain domain names are only trusted if they are signed by specific certificates. Which of the following actions would best achieve this goal and what is a potential limitation of this approach?"
 "A": "Implementing enterprise certificate pinning to associate a root issuing certificate authority with a domain name, which might limit the flexibility to change certificate authorities in the future."
 "B": "Enabling automatic root certificate updates in Windows to ensure the system trusts the most recent certificates, potentially leading to trusting new, unwanted certificates."
 "C": "Disabling all root certificates in the system to prevent any domain from being trusted, ensuring maximum security at the expense of disrupting all secure communications."
 "D": "Only allowing self-signed certificates for all enterprise web applications, which would increase the administrative overhead for managing trust relationships."
Answer: A
