**Describe the problem**
The 1.13 release candidate requires a minimum compute capability of 6.0 (so it
ignores lower-level devices). Is this an intentional change that we can expect
to see in the full release? Or just an artifact of the release candidate
build?
**Provide the exact sequence of commands / steps that you executed before
running into the problem**
    from tensorflow.python.client import device_lib
    device_lib.list_local_devices()
**Any other info / logs**  
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem.
If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and
files should be attached.
