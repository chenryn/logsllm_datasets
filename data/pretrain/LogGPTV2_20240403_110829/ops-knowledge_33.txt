User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Cannot open oracle 9i database: ORA-16038: log 4 sequence# 1781 cannot be archived my server was unexpectedly rebooted.

after the server boot up I received the following error when trying to start up the database:

ORA-16038: log 4 sequence# 1781 cannot be archived
ORA-19504: failed to create file ""
ORA-00312: online log 4 thread 1: "[LOCATION OF LOG]"


is there anything I can do about this?
Thanks for the help.

Assistant: check how much free space you have on archive destination FS ,Clean up some space and try again 
should work 

you can also clean up logs if you dont need any them from RMAN 
RMAN&gt; delete archivelog all; OR clean up not required logs delete archivelog until time 'xxxx'
