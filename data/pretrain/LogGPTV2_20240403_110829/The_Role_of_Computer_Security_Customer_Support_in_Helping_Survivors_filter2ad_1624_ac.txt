additional risks that should be considered when giving advice

and ensure that the customer is safe to receive and act on
advice. The question, “How do you think he is watching your
activity?” in Scenario B was identiﬁed as a good example: it is
open-ended, non-judgmental, and might help the agent better
diagnose the case by encouraging the customer to speculate
about the source of the problem.
Professionals also provided their own examples of appro-
priate follow-up questions, e.g., asking about the customer’s
immediate concern in the form of “What are you most con-
cerned about?” or “What is your goal of calling me today?”
Professionals explained that such questions do not assume
the survivor’s needs and might help identify other risks that
warrant attention, such as those related to immigration status,
health, or economic situation. Another follow-up question
could be, “What have you already tried?” to facilitate the
troubleshooting process and make the conversation more pro-
ductive, since the survivor likely tried to address the problem
before reaching out for help.
Professionals further discussed the need to account for the
possibility that the abuser might be physically or remotely
accessing the survivor’s devices and accounts. Four groups
recommended a safety check-in with the customer by asking,
“Do you think you’re on a secure line?” or, “Are you safe
now?” If the response is no or unsure, the agent should offer
to call back or initiate a chat from a different device, such as
a friend’s phone. Three groups also recommended verifying
the customer’s identity in case the abuser is impersonating
the survivor to gain access to the security software or other
accounts. The agent could verify the customer’s email, phone
number, or account history (e.g., “I see in our records someone
just called about this account. Is that you?”).
Nevertheless, professionals acknowledged that it is chal-
lenging to handle situations in which the abuser is present:
identity veriﬁcation takes practice and can still go wrong;
giving advice such as switching to a different phone might
tip off the abuser. Yet, professionals noted that the risk does
not undermine the importance of support agents providing
necessary help and information. As a researcher explained:
“[The survivor] had to disclose the problem to begin
with, so [the abuser] has already [been] tipped off. But
. . . that’s why we need to connect [the survivor] to a safety
clinic. It’s really tricky when the phone is the only way to
communicate.” (P1, researcher)
Avoid overpromising. All groups took issue with the phrase,
“I’m happy to help resolve the issue” in Scenario A, saying
that “resolve” is an overpromise because one chat session is
unlikely to solve the physical and digital complexities sur-
vivors face in IPV [27,28,53]. From their perspectives, agents
might promise to solve problems instinctively or to comply
with company policy. Yet many IPV survivors face persistent
attacks from their abusers and are likely experiencing effects
of trauma, meaning that such promises could be misleading
and frustrating to them. Professionals noted that a better re-
sponse would be to be honest about the security software’s
limitations while still providing support, such as, “I will help
you as much as I can in this call today, and whatever we don’t
take care of, we might have to keep working on it.” Doing so
does not necessarily contradict the agent’s responsibility to
help customers. As a legal advocate said:
“[The agent] can still support the survivor while giving
them a response they don’t want . . . But do it in a way that
lets [the survivor] know they are there, they understand,
they are validating their experience . . . They can still give
[the survivor] bad news without completely turning them
down.” (P16, legal advocate)
4.3 Responsibilities of Customer Support
Customer support’s typical role is to provide technical as-
sistance related to the company’s products and services and
engage with customers [7]. Professionals stressed that while
agents should only advise on topics within their expertise
and refer the customer elsewhere for issues beyond, agents
could do more than troubleshooting technical problems or
recommending the company’s products. For instance, agents
could discuss the potential consequences of advice they give
or share basic technology safety tips.
Avoid making advice too product-oriented. In Scenario A,
the agent recommended installing one of the company’s soft-
ware products. Professionals commented that this behavior is
understandable, given that the agent represents the company
and that the product might be helpful. Nevertheless, the line
might read too product-oriented and convey the impression
that the agent was following a script and making a sales pitch
without actively listening. To make a product recommenda-
tion more helpful, a counselor suggested explaining how and
why the software is going to help in the survivor’s situation:
“[The survivor] didn’t call for that product. She called
with a problem. [The agent] never explained how their
product was going to solve the problem . . . so please give
more explanation about that.” (P2, counselor)
Discuss consequences of given advice. While profession-
als agreed that support agents could provide IPV survivors
with vital assistance, they emphasized the caution required
in providing such assistance. One suggestion was explaining
potential negative consequences that might result from the
advice to prompt the survivor to consider safety issues. A
manager gave an example:
“Ask [the survivor]: if this app were to be uninstalled,
how would it affect you? . . . Do you use it often? Do you
rely on it? Does the [abuser] have access to it? Will they
notice if it’s uninstalled?” (P9, manager)

However, other professionals mentioned a potential issue
with discussing negative consequences — it might trigger ad-
ditional questions from the survivor that catch the agent off
guard, which points to the importance of external referrals:
“I feel it’s like a slippery slope because [the agents] are
not domestic violence advocates. And so [the survivor] is
going to just be like, ‘What do you mean? What do you
think will happen?’ And they’re never going to be able to
answer those questions.” (P1, researcher)
Share resources for tech safety. Three groups suggested
sharing resources that might improve the survivor’s digital
security and privacy, such as adjusting privacy settings on
social media and using strong passwords. Prior work with
IPV survivors [26] also indicates that survivors have many
general tech safety questions and desire credible information
on this topic, validating the need for sharing tech safety re-
sources. One group noted that in addition to sharing existing
resources, such as the NNEDV’s Safety Net project [76], com-
puter security companies could utilize their expertise to pro-
vide self-created content on tech safety. Such content could
appear on the company website’s FAQ or “Contact” page
to put such resources into a survivor’s pathway of seeking
help.3 Participants suggested tech safety resources be written
in plain language and provided with non-technical support
resources (e.g., information about domestic violence shelters)
to ensure relevant resources are available in one place.
Have a specialized team. Three groups suggested a special-
ized team within the company’s customer support division
for handling IPV cases transferred from frontline agents. A
specialized team resolves the dilemma for frontline agents
who are often pressured or incentivized to complete cases
quickly [63], whereas dealing with complex issues like tech-
enabled IPV requires extensive effort and patience. It could
also reduce the company’s workload in coordinating training,
as training a small group of specialists would be easier than
training all frontline agents. One group further noted that the
company could track the number of potential IPV cases front-
line agents receive to understand the issue’s prevalence and
decide whether investing in a specialized team is warranted.
Given the possibility that a survivor might face imminent
danger, professionals emphasized that frontline agents should
always conduct a safety check-in (e.g., “Do you think you can
stay on the line with us?”) to determine whether the survivor
could tolerate a transfer to the specialized team. Addition-
ally, many survivors might have experienced prior failures in
obtaining assistance and could easily get frustrated when be-
ing transferred. A counselor gave an example of appropriate
language taking this into account:
“We, as a company, remain interested and committed to
trying to help you and talk to you . . . But if you can hold on
3Some security companies are already doing this (e.g., [37,51]), although
most content does not speciﬁcally address IPV or tech-enabled abuse.
a minute, I’m going to get you connected with a colleague
who knows our product but can [also] talk to you about
some of these [safety] issues.” (P2, counselor)
Without the pressure of completing cases in a limited time,
professionals envisioned that these specialist agents could
even build long-term relationships with survivors, such as
following up with them if the problem does not get ﬁxed in
the initial chat session. Importantly, four groups cautioned
that support agents should never provide advice beyond their
expertise and training. Examples of out-of-scope advice in-
cluded comprehensive IPV-related counseling, safety plan-
ning (e.g., maintaining physical safety in leaving an abuser),
and legal advice. While professionals identiﬁed a handful of
follow-up questions to ask or advice to give, they noted that
the extent to which agents can help customers think through
potential consequences depends on the individual’s situation
and needs. If the survivor needs support the agent cannot pro-
vide, the agent should refer them to external professionals
with expertise in the social, legal, or health aspects of IPV.
4.4 Suggestions for External Referrals
In addition to technological challenges, many IPV survivors
are concurrently dealing with medical, legal, ﬁnancial, and
other complex problems [27]. With this in mind, profession-
als discussed the need to refer survivors to external support,
including IPV advocates, legal experts, and law enforcement.
We now discuss professionals’ suggestions on where, when,
and how to refer survivors to external organizations.
Where to refer. All groups stressed the need to refer sur-
vivors to relevant hotlines (e.g., the National Domestic Vio-
lence Hotline, Safe Horizon, and Crisis Text Line) and orga-
nizations that provide resources for survivors (e.g., NNEDV).
Four groups also suggested referrals to 911 or the National
Suicide Prevention Lifeline if there are cues of physical dan-
ger or suicide contemplation. Two groups mentioned that
survivors might also beneﬁt from referrals to legal resources
(e.g., WomensLaw.org) or sex trafﬁcking resources (e.g., the
National Human Trafﬁcking Hotline).
One challenge in making referrals is that the resources
available differ substantially across local, state, national, and
global boundaries. In the US, there is the National Domestic
Violence Hotline, but each state also has its own hotline [81].
The referrals get more complicated for global companies.
However, a legal advocate argued that ﬁguring out the exact
resource for referrals is not necessary as long as any referral
is given, as staff at hotlines and organizations are sufﬁciently
trained to refer onward if they are not in a position to help:
“Most of these places that you call can handle any of
these intakes and they’ll ﬁgure out the way . . . If you get
the company committed to giving out a suicide hotline and
a collection of these numbers, honestly the distinctions
don’t matter.” (P13, legal advocate)

When to refer. To determine when an external referral is
needed, all groups suggested monitoring for “red ﬂags” in the
conversation. Indications of adverse behaviors such as spy-
ing, stalking, and violence from an intimate partner generally
point to the need for IPV-related resources. “This problem
has almost driven me to commit suicide” in Scenario A or
other indications of threatened physical safety are clear red
ﬂags that call for 911 and suicide prevention resources.
Three groups suggested that agents be trained to understand
and identify common types of tech abuse. One resource that
could be part of such training is the NNEDV’s Power and
Control Wheel on Technology and Abuse [75]. For situations
without clear indications of IPV (e.g., the customer mentions
abusive behaviors but does not mention an intimate partner),
professionals believed the agent should still share relevant
resources not limited to IPV. An attorney gave an example:
“If it’s a stranger, there would have to be some concerning
conduct . . . So if [a customer is] calling, maybe it’s be-
cause [they] are getting creepy spoofed messages from an
account [they] don’t recognize. Well that’s already raising
ﬂags, right?” (P5, attorney)
In Scenario C, in which the customer believed their ex was
monitoring the chat to prevent them from getting help, one
group pointed out this was an example of controlling behav-
ior that still warrants attention, as IPV can occur via coercive
control without physical violence [14, 16, 29]. Professionals
across all groups advocated for making referrals without wor-
rying about verifying whether the customer is experiencing
IPV: a referral is better than no referral, because not provid-
ing resources to someone in need can do more harm than
providing resources to someone who does not need them:
“Let’s say [the customer] is actually safe . . . They Google
the number, they see it’s . . . the domestic violence helpline.
They’re going to be, ‘whatever, I’m not calling that’ . . . But
for the person who really has the need, if they want it, they
will follow up on that phone call.” (P12, paralegal)
How to refer. Four groups mentioned an important principle
in making referrals was to respect the survivor’s agency in
decision making. The idea of empowerment — that survivors
should be able to decide if and how they want to get help —
is common in IPV professionals’ training [57, 59]. As an
example, an administrative assistant explained that agents
should always ask survivors whether and how they would like
to be transferred to external resources:
“Maybe this survivor is not in a private space to have
that conversation . . . Maybe transferring them directly to
a domestic violence agency [is] too overwhelming at that
moment and not what they are looking for . . . Give them
resources to explore it on their own.” (P15, admin. asst.)
Three groups discussed potential harms resulting from la-
beling the customer as an IPV survivor. Here, the harm does
not come from the action of providing IPV-related resources,
but rather from repeated mentioning of words like abuse, do-
mestic violence, or victim. Customers who are not survivors
might ﬁnd it offensive, and customers who are survivors might
not be ready to be identiﬁed as such. Instead, agents should
use the same language that the customer uses, e.g., if the
customer describes abusive behavior from an ex-partner, the
agent should also use “ex-partner” in referring to the abuser.
As a counselor described:
“If [my clients] say something is going on, I am not going
to say ‘you are a survivor of domestic violence’ . . . You
don’t want them to think that the person has assumed
. . . You want to give them the opportunity to call it in
whatever ways they want.” (P14, counselor)
5 Focus Groups with Support Practitioners
IPV professionals provided many suggestions for how cus-
tomer support could provide help for IPV survivors. To assess
the practicality of these suggestions, we conducted four fo-
cus groups with 11 customer support practitioners between
April and June 2020. We sought to learn how attuned support
practitioners are to tech-enabled IPV and their opinions on
these suggestions, including any potential implementation
challenges. We continued the focus group format, consider-
ing that IPV could be a new and sensitive topic to support
practitioners, and that a group setting may make participants
comfortable sharing their thoughts upon hearing others’ opin-
ions or experiences [27, 57]. This study also received IRB
approval.
5.1 Method
Recruitment. Our participants came from four large secu-
rity companies afﬁliated with the Coalition Against Stalker-
ware [71]. All four companies offer consumer- and business-
facing security software and services to millions of customers.
Each had customer support divisions to answer product-
related questions and concerns. Among our participants (see
