## Introduction/Motivation
### Surveillance - Then
- 1960: Radio receiver inside pipe
- 1960: Camera inside a pack of cigarettes
- 1970: Microphone inside a dragonfly
- 1990: Microphone inside a fake catfish

### Surveillance - Now
- Spyware/Remote Access Trojans (RATs)
- Benign Reasons?
  - Family
  - Couple
  - Friends

### Key Takeaways
- It is very easy to:
  - Enable premium features without paying
  - Access highly sensitive data of a person
  - Perform mass surveillance in real-time

## How Does It Work?
- **Observer** (push/pull)
- **Monitored Person** (push/pull)
- **Tracking Provider** (backend/cloud)

### Types of Data
- Location
- SMS
- Call logs
- Media files

### Attack Vectors
- Client-side vulnerabilities
- Communication vulnerabilities
- Server-side vulnerabilities

## Bad Client-Side Checks with SharedPreferences
### Example 1: Enabling Premium Features
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```java
  N = com.google.android.gms.ads.g;
  if(!this.n.getBoolean("l_ads", false)) {
    ...
  } else {
    this.N.setVisibility(View.GONE);
  }
  ```
- **SharedPreferences Backup/Restore:**
  - Rooted device: Copy `loveMonitoring.xml` from app folder to PC, modify, and copy back.
  - Unrooted device: Use `adb backup`, `adb restore`, and `android-backup-extractor`.

### Example 2: Admin Privileges
- App supports two modes: parent (controller/administration) and children (monitored).
- Administrator can create new administrators and monitor all children.

### Example 3: Remove Lockscreen
- After app start, the lock screen asks for a PIN.
- To remove the lock screen, change the SharedPreference value from `true` to `false`.

### Example 4: Authentication Bypass
- Same method works for login, no password required.

**Recommendation:**
- Do not use SharedPreferences for authorization checks!

## Client-Side and Communication Vulnerabilities
### Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks
- **User/App** â†” **Tracking Provider (Backend/Cloud)**
- DATA
- DATA
- DATA

## Server-Side Vulnerabilities
- Insecure APIs
- Weak authentication mechanisms
- Insufficient logging and monitoring

## Responsible Disclosure Process
- Identify the vulnerability
- Contact the developer/vendor
- Provide a detailed report
- Allow a reasonable time for a fix
- Publicly disclose after the issue is resolved

## Summary
- Tracker apps are vulnerable to various security issues.
- Client-side, communication, and server-side vulnerabilities can be exploited.
- Proper security practices and responsible disclosure are essential to mitigate these risks.
