User: I want to kill python interpeter - The intention is that all the python files that are running in this moment will stop (without any informantion about this files).
obviously the processes should be closed.
Any idea as delete files in python or destroy the interpeter is ok :D (I am working with virtual machine).
I need it from the terminal because i write c code and i use linux commands...
Hope for help
Assistant: pgrep -f youAppFile.py | xargs kill -9
pgrep returns the PID of the specific file will only kill the specific application.
