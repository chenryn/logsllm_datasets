Question: If a cybersecurity analyst is setting up a detection mechanism for firmware corruption on company devices, which of the following approaches would be the least effective and why?
"A": "Monitoring changes to the firmware for unexpected modifications, which does not account for legitimate updates.",
"B": "Logging attempts to read/write to BIOS and comparing against known patching behavior, but this may generate false positives if legitimate software behaves similarly.",
"C": "Checking for the presence of known malware bootloaders, which may not detect novel or unknown malware strategies.",
"D": "Inspecting network traffic for signs of firmware tampering, which may not detect local attacks that do not involve network communication."
Answer: D
