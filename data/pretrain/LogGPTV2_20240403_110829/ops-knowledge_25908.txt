User: I have a new MacBook w/ Yosemite. In an attempt to get OSC, Zeroconf, PySide and Kivy working, I installed too much via Homebrew.  I've successfully (?) undone most of the damage, I think, and have installed all the Python modules so that Apple's Python finds everything... from the terminal window.
However, now my code runs from the console, correctly importing a custom pythonosc module installed with "sudo python setup.py install", but when I package it with py2app it can no longer find pythonosc. (It found it previously with Python et al installed a la Homebrew.)
Assistant: You say you've "installed too much via Homebrew" and need "Apple's Python to find everything"

After installing Python modules into Homebrew's site-packages, you can make them importable from outside.  

First make a directory here (assuming 2.7):
mkdir -p ~/Library/Python/2.7/lib/python/site-packages
Then put a path file in it:
echo 'import site; site.addsitedir("'$(brew --prefix)'/lib/python2.7/site-packages")' >> ~/Library/Python/2.7/lib/python/site-packages/homebrew.pth
