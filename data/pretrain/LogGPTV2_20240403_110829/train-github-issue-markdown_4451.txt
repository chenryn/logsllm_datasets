Subject: Discrepancy in Tutorial Results

Hello,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inquire about an issue I encountered while following the tutorial. The example provided in the tutorial specifies a radius of 53 and an SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) of 5200. I downloaded the code and used the same sample image as shown in the tutorial. However, the results I obtained were significantly different from those presented.

Has anyone else attempted this example? Is it possible that something has changed in the code or the tutorial since its publication?

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
