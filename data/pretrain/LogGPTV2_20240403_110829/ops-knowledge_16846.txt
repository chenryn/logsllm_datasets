User: How to use Git for team collaboration development, including branch management, commit specification, merge, etc.?
Assistant: Git is a popular distributed version control tool that allows multiple people to collaborate on the same project. The following is the basic process of using Git for team collaboration development: 1. Create a remote warehouse: Usually, a Git project requires a remote warehouse hosted in the cloud, and services such as GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket can be used. 2. Branch management: Team members can create their own feature branches based on the development branch and independently develop their own functions. When you're done, merge the feature branch into the develop branch, making sure everyone's code doesn't affect each other. You can also create personal branches for developing, testing code, etc. 3. Commit specification: commit is an important concept in version control, which is used to record the modification of each version. In order to facilitate recording and viewing, certain commit specifications need to be followed, such as the use of semantic version numbers, clear comments, etc. 4. Dealing with conflicts: Conflicts occur when multiple people modify the same file at the same time. When merging branches, Git will automatically attempt to merge, but if conflicts are found during the merge process, they will need to be resolved manually. You can use the merge tool that comes with Git or a third-party tool to solve it. 5. Code Review: Code Review is an important step before merging code. Through Code Review, potential problems and loopholes in the code can be found to improve code quality and security. 6. Version release: Every time a version is released, a tag is required to mark the version number. Team members can develop and test based on a specific version number. The above are the basic steps, and different teams and projects need to carry out specific planning and operations according to the actual situation.
