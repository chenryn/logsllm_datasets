User: Introduce some common load balancing algorithms and their advantages and disadvantages.
Assistant: 1. Round Robin Algorithm: Assign requests to different servers in turn, and each server handles the same number of requests. This algorithm is easy to understand and easy to implement, but it cannot take into account the actual load of each server, which may cause some servers to be overloaded while others are idle. 2. The least number of connections algorithm: assign the request to the server with the least number of current connections. This algorithm takes into account the actual load of the server, which can effectively avoid the overload of a single server. However, this algorithm needs to maintain the number of connections of each server, resulting in certain overhead. 3. IP Hash Algorithm: According to the client IP address, the request is assigned to the corresponding server, the purpose is to realize the load balancing that the request for the same client is always assigned to the same server. This algorithm is simple, but it is easy to cause load imbalance when the number of clients is small. 4. Response time weighting algorithm: The distribution of requests is determined according to the average response time of the server. Servers with lower average response times will get more requests. This algorithm can be automatically adjusted according to the server load, but it needs to continuously monitor the server response time, resulting in certain overhead. 5. Dynamic weighted round-robin algorithm: This algorithm combines the round-robin algorithm and the weight adjustment mechanism to dynamically adjust the weight of the server according to the actual load of the server. This algorithm takes into account the actual load of each server, and the adjustment range will not be too large, but the implementation is more complicated and it is easy to introduce new performance problems.
