### Functions for Creating Pseudo-Identities (PIs) Based on Biometric Data

After a user registers, the created PI is securely stored. Upon successful authentication, the PI expires, and a new PI can be generated for subsequent recognitions. For enhanced security, the system requires a password or other credentials as supplementary/auxiliary data (AD).

#### Enrollment Phase
During enrollment, a biometric device captures the user's biometric templates while the user provides a password. An encoder then generates the PI and creates additional non-biometric helper data (HD) using only the user’s AD. The initial biometric information and AD are subsequently destroyed. The design includes parameters to separate and individualize elements, preventing impersonation and addressing issues with users who have very similar characteristics [122]. Helper data and PI references are securely stored in an encrypted domain, such as a database (DB), card, or token.

#### Authentication Process
The authentication process can follow two different approaches [33]:

1. **Direct Verification:**
   - The user presents their biometrics at the system's sensors and provides the password used during enrollment.
   - Using the stored templates of the helper data and the PI, a verifier communicates the decision result to the application's parties.
   - After a successful authentication, the user's fresh biometrics and password are destroyed.

2. **PI Recoding:**
   - The newly captured biometric features, AD, and the template of the HD are provided to a PI recoder, which generates a new PI.
   - The biometric and supplementary data are then destroyed, and the new PI is provided to the application's comparator.
   - The authentication decision is determined by comparing the newly created PI with the stored PI template.

This technique combines passwords and biometric data, offering high levels of security [62]. It adheres to the privacy principles of ISO standards [92] and respects the properties outlined in [66]. The embedded one-way functions ensure non-invertibility. The mechanism provides individualized comparison parameters to optimize performance, offering renewability, cancelability, and revocability. It allows the creation and communication of multiple PIs for the same user across various non-local architectures, such as cloud-based designs, ensuring confidentiality and anonymity. This approach overcomes the limitations of other mechanisms [151], though interoperability and integrity are evaluated for different threat scenarios. The integration of minimal data, such as minutiae features of fingerprints, is examined to test the overall accuracy in realistic use-cases. Table 1 compares and summarizes the presented approaches.

### Privacy-Preserving Authentication Model

In this section, we introduce an authentication model based on the privacy-preserving cryptographic mechanism of pseudo-identities. Due to their advantages and high security, PIs are ideal for our model, specifically designed for eFinance applications. Following the ISO framework for privacy and security in financial services [94], we address the practical issues in technically implementing the privacy principles and security regulations introduced in [66, 92, 95].

#### Related Work
Literature offers various proposals for secure biometric authentication in mobile devices [146]. Privacy-preserving approaches that combine passwords and biometrics in electronic financial architectures present reliable security levels [32, 145]. The cryptographic technique of PIs is characterized as the optimal mechanism for commercial applications [33, 62]. Although it shows promising results, state-of-the-art research lacks practical applicability [69]. We analyze and exploit this mechanism in an eFinance service scenario.

#### Scenario, Parties, and Roles
Figure 2 illustrates the registration and authentication processes. For higher security, our model uses the second authentication approach involving a PI recoder, as described in Section 5. The design involves a user, a bank, and the user's mobile device with an embedded fingerprint sensor. The bank, through an application running on the user's device, offers online financial checking services. The user creates an electronic bank account and gains access to the eFinance service.

The architecture of PIs classifies systems based on storage and comparison choices [33]. Cloud-based models are more accurate when they distribute comparison templates, as evaluated in [215]. We select this approach to reduce tampering attacks and prevent malicious users from registering under another person's name. The signal processing subsystems of the PI encoder and recoder are local. Our model stores information distributed on the user's mobile device and on a server. Results are transmitted through decision subsystems, and the bank's application handles the comparison procedures on the server.

#### Registration and Authentication
For user enrollment, the client uses the bank's application to request account creation. Biometric sensors capture and extract minimal minutiae data from the user's fingerprint, and the application requires a PIN code as AD. The device's encoder uses this information to generate the PI and create additional helper non-biometric data, using only the client's PIN code. The PI is encrypted and locally stored on the device, while the helper data template is securely transmitted to the bank and associated with the client's account information. Biometrics and the PIN code are erased.

During authentication, the client requests access to their account using the bank's application and presents their fingerprints and PIN code. For the comparison procedure, the bank securely transmits the encrypted helper data for the given user's PIN code to the bank's application. The decision is not solely based on the helper data; a PI recoder subsystem creates a new PI based on the new biometric features presented by the client. There is no storage of private biometrics and related references at this phase. The PI comparator of the bank's application communicates the result of the comparison between the newly created PI and the initial stored PI to the bank, and the PIN code and biometric minimal data are destroyed. The authentication decision is provided to the client.

#### Security and Privacy Requirements
Our model meets the security requirements of confidentiality, cancelability, and revocability [96] and covers the new recommendation of renewability [66]. According to security regulations for financial services [94, 95], the property of permanence is critical for privacy-aware schemes. Our model preserves this recommendation, as PIs expire and can be re-created. The design is based on two levels of security, combining passwords and biometrics, offering higher robustness [95].

The privacy requirements of non-invertibility and unlinkability [92] are preserved. Unlinkability does not apply to the bank, which is considered semi-honest. In case of an attack, compromised PIs are canceled, and the templates become incompatible with the user's original ones, respecting the client's privacy [215]. One-way functions prevent the use of biometric data for any purpose other than the intended one [94], avoiding further processing of additional data across applications and databases. The original biometric feature cannot be recovered, and the system offers confidentiality against unauthorized access. In the online environment of the bank's application, it is challenging to implement minimal data for preserving data minimization and providing user control over their data [95].

### Conclusion
Biometric authentication for eFinance and ePayment purposes is gaining global acceptance, increasing privacy concerns in the financial sector. Research in cryptography for biometrics offers mechanisms that, when practically implemented, bring new privacy-enhanced designs. In this paper, we discussed current security approaches and privacy practices that protect users' biometric information while respecting their privacy rights. We presented a privacy-preserving biometric authentication model for eFinance applications based on the recent cryptographic technique of pseudonymous biometric identities. In compliance with data protection regulations, we addressed ways to enhance privacy and satisfy security requirements during the design process. Future work will focus on designing protocols and the technical implementation of the model, leading to toolkits for secure and privacy-aware identity management in financial services.

### Abstract
Biometric authentication is part of the daily routine for millions of users, enhancing their experience and convenience. The adoption of biometric technologies for various applications has grown exponentially over the last decade. Cloud computing can deliver biometric services over the Internet, offering benefits such as reduced cost, increased storage capacity, unlimited data processing, efficiency, and flexibility. However, with the proliferation of cloud-based biometric authentication, security and privacy concerns have become more relevant. Although biometrics provide strong guarantees in verifying users' identity, privacy regulations recognize biometric data as sensitive information. Numerous cloud-based biometric authentication architectures have been proposed, but most are unimodal and multi-factor models. Multibiometric designs offer improved reliability and accuracy. In this work, we propose a distributed approach for multimodal user authentication that incorporates existing biometric datasets in a secure and privacy-preserving manner. The verification setup functions as an expert system, using previously stored biometric templates held by distinct, mutually untrusted cloud-based identity providers. We focus on biometric integration using a user-specific weighted score level fusion method that provides an optimum trade-off between accuracy and robustness. Our system uses Multi-Party Computation (MPC) techniques to allow mutually distrusting parties to jointly compute the matching score without revealing any private data. The final fused score is communicated to a single party. Unlike existing state-of-the-art cloud-based biometric identity management architectures, our system provides multimodal authentication without re-enrolling users, preventing additional biometric extraction and storage of private information. The proposed design is analyzed for usability, security, privacy, computational efficiency, and applicability.
