functions, to create PIs based on the references of biometric data. After the
user’s registration, the created PI is securely stored. After the authentication
procedure, the PI expires while for a second recognition, the scheme can create
a new PI. For higher levels of security, the scheme requires the presence of a
password or credential that are used as supplementary/auxiliary data (AD).
Figure 1: Architecture for renewable biometric pseudo-identities.
During the enrollment phase, a biometric device captures the biometric templates
from user’s fresh features while the user provides a password. Subsequently, an
encoder generates the PI and creates additional non-biometric HD, using as an
input only the user’s AD. The initial biometric information and AD are destroyed.
The design involves the parameters for the separation and individualization of
the elements, preventing impersonation, bringing obstacles for users that have
very similar characteristics [122]. Helper data and PI references are securely
stored as diﬀerent templates in an encrypted domain, such as a DB, card or
token.
The authentication process is divided in two diﬀerent approaches [33]. The
scheme can proceed to a direct and simple veriﬁcation of the PI. The user
presents his biometrics at the system’s sensors and provides the password that
was presented during the enrollment phase. Given the stored templates of the
102 PRIVACY-PRESERVING BIOMETRIC AUTHENTICATION MODEL FOR EFINANCE APPLICATIONS
helper data and the PI, a veriﬁer provides and communicates the decision
result to the application’s parties. After a successful authentication, user’s
fresh biometrics and the password are destroyed. According to the second
authentication method, the new captured biometric features, the AD and the
template of the HD are provided to a PI recoder, allowing the generation of
a new (pseudo-identity)*. It follows the destruction process for the biometric
and supplementary data, while the new PI is provided to the application’s
comparator. The authentication decision is determined by the comparison of the
new created (pseudo-identity)* with the template of the stored pseudo-identity.
The technique can combine passwords and biometric data, presenting high levels
of security [62]. It preserves the privacy principles of ISO standards in [92] while it
also respects the properties in [66]. The embedded one-way functions are subject
to the recommendation of non-invertibility. The mechanism oﬀers individualized
comparison parameters to optimize the performance, oﬀering renewability,
cancelability and revocability. It allows the creation and communication of
multiple PIs for the same user in several non-local architectures, for instance
cloud-based designs that demand high ﬂexibility. The security requirements of
conﬁdentiality and anonymity are satisﬁed. Hence, it overcomes the limitations
of the other mechanisms [151]. However, the recommendations of interoperability
and integrity are evaluated for diﬀerent threat scenarios. The integration of
minimal data as a user’s input such as minutiae features of ﬁngerprints is
examined, testing the overall accuracy of the implementation in realistic use-
cases. Table 1 compares and summarizes the presented approaches.
6 Privacy-Preserving Authentication Model
In this section, we introduce an authentication model based on the privacy-
preserving cryptographic mechanism of pseudo-identities. Due to their
advantages and high security results, the PIs are the ideal technique for our
model that is specially designed for eFinance applications. Following the ISO
framework for privacy and security in services of the ﬁnancial sector [94], we
present the practical issues in technically addressing the privacy principles and
security regulations introduced in [66,92,95].

security levels [32, 145]. The cryptographic technique of PIs is characterized
as the optimum mechanism for commercial applications [33, 62]. In terms of
security and privacy, although its promising results, state-of-the-art oﬀers only
theoretical works that lack of applicability [69]. We exploit and analyze the
mechanism in an eFinance service scenario.
6.2 Scenario, Parties and Roles
Figure 2 presents the registration and authentication processes. For higher
levels of security, our model utilizes the second approach of authentication that
involves a PI recoder as it is presented in Section 5. The design involves a user,
a bank and the user’s mobile device with an embedded ﬁngerprint sensor. The
bank, through the application running on the device controlled by the user,
oﬀers to the clients the service of the online ﬁnancial checking. The user creates
an electronic bank account and gains the eFinance service access.
The architecture of PIs presents a classiﬁcation of systems according to the
choices for storage and comparison [33]. The models for cloud-based applications
104 PRIVACY-PRESERVING BIOMETRIC AUTHENTICATION MODEL FOR EFINANCE APPLICATIONS
Figure 2: Biometric pseudo-identities model in an eFinance application.
are more accurate when they distribute the templates of comparison, according
to the evaluation introduced in [215]. We select this approach in order to
reduce the parameter of tampering attacks and prevent a malicious user from
registering, using another person’s name and getting access to his account. The
signal processing subsystems of the PI encoder and recoder are local. Our model
stores the information distributed on user’s mobile device and on server. The
results are transmitted through decision subsystems while bank’s application
handles the comparison procedures that take place on server.
6.3 Registration and Authentication
For the user’s enrollment procedure, the client utilizes the bank’s application,
requesting the creation of his account. The biometric sensors capture and extract
minimal minutiae data of his ﬁngerprint while the application demands the
PRIVACY-PRESERVING AUTHENTICATION MODEL
105
presence of a PIN code that is used as AD. The device’s encoder uses this
information to generate the PI and create additional helper non-biometric data,
using as an input only client’s PIN code. The PI is encrypted and locally stored
at the device, the helper data template is securely transmitted at the bank. It
is stored and associated with the client’s account information. Biometrics and
PIN code are erased.
During the authentication, the client requests access at his account, using the
bank’s application and presenting his ﬁngerprints and the PIN code. For the
comparison procedure, the bank securely transmits to the bank’s application
the encrypted helper data for the given user’s PIN code. The decision is not
determined only by the helper data, since the subsystem of a PI recoder creates
a new (pseudo-identity)* based on the new biometric features that the client
presents. At this phase, there is no storage of private biometrics and their related
references. The PI comparator of the bank’s application communicates to the
bank the result of the comparison between the new created (pseudo-identity)*
and the initial stored pseudo-identity while PIN code and biometric minimal
data is destroyed. The authentication decision is provided to the client.
6.4 Security and Privacy Requirements
The security requirements of conﬁdentiality, cancelability and revocability [96]
can be met through the utilization of the pseudo-identities approach. The new
recommendation of renewability introduced in [66] is also covered. According to
the security regulations for ﬁnancial services [94,95] the property of permanence
is critical for privacy-aware schemes. Our model preserves the recommendation,
since the PIs expire and can be re-created. Finally, our design is based on two
levels of security, combining passwords and biometrics. Thus, it oﬀers higher
robustness, as this is suggested in [95]
The privacy requirements of non-invertibility and unlinkability [92] are
preserved. It is noted that the term of unlinkability is not referred to the
bank. This party is considered semi-honest, and the privacy regulations are
related to the malicious third parties. In case of an attack, the PIs are canceled
and the compromised templates become incompatible with the user’s original
ones, respecting client’s privacy [215]. Though the one-way functions, the
model prevents the use of biometric data for any other purpose than the one
originally intended [94]. In that way, further processing of additional data across
applications and other DBs is avoided. The original biometric feature cannot be
recovered and the system oﬀers conﬁdentiality against access by an unauthorized
intruder. For the online environment of the bank’s application, it is challenging
106 PRIVACY-PRESERVING BIOMETRIC AUTHENTICATION MODEL FOR EFINANCE APPLICATIONS
to study the implementation of minimal data for preserving data minimization
and oﬀer user’s control over his data [95].
7 Conclusion
Biometric authentication for eFinance and ePayment purposes gains ground
globally, increasing the privacy concerns in ﬁnancial sector. In the light of the
foregoing critique, research on the ﬁeld of cryptography for biometrics oﬀers
mechanisms that their practical implementation brings new privacy-enhanced
designs. In this paper, we discussed the current security approaches and privacy
practices that can oﬀer protection of user’s biometric information, respecting
his privacy rights. We presented a privacy-preserving biometric authentication
model for eFinance applications, based on the recent cryptographic technique
of pseudonymous biometric identities. In compliance with the data protection
regulations, we discussed the ways that privacy can be addressed and how the
security requirements could be satisﬁed during the design process. Authors’
future direction is the design of the protocols and the technical implementation
of the model. The proposed approach can lead to the toolkits for secure and
privacy-aware identity management in ﬁnancial services.

Abstract. Biometric authentication is part of the daily routine
for millions of users, enhancing their experience and convenience.
Additionally, the adoption of biometric technologies for various
applications has grown exponentially over the last decade. Due
to the increasing demand for authentication solutions, cloud
computing can serve as a means to deliver biometric services
over the Internet oﬀering numerous beneﬁts, such as reduced cost,
increased storage capacity, unlimited data processing, eﬃciency and
ﬂexibility. However, with the proliferation of cloud-based biometric
authentication deployments, security and privacy concerns become
more relevant than ever. Although biometrics provide strong
guarantees in verifying users’ identity, privacy regulations recognize
biometric data as sensitive information. Over the last few years,
numerous cloud-based biometric authentication architectures have
been proposed in the literature. However, the majority, if not all,
of them are unimodal and multi-factor models. Multibiometric
designs have attracted attention in high security schemes as
they oﬀer improved reliability and accuracy. In this work, we
propose a distributed approach for multimodal user authentication
that allows incorporation of already existing biometric datasets
in a secure and privacy-preserving manner. Speciﬁcally, the
veriﬁcation setup is designed to function as an expert system,
using previously stored biometric templates that are held by
distinct mutually untrusted cloud-based identity providers. We
focus on biometric integration by exploiting a user-speciﬁc weighted
score level fusion method that provides an optimum trade-oﬀ
between accuracy and robustness. Our system uses Multi-Party
Computation techniques to allow mutually distrusting parties to
jointly compute the matching score without revealing any private
data. The ﬁnal fused score is only communicated to a single
party. In contrast to the existing state-of-the-art in cloud-based
biometric identity management architectures, our system provides
multimodal authentication without having to re-enroll the users

by collecting their biometric samples, preventing any additional
biometric extraction and storage of users’ private information. The
proposed design is analyzed to demonstrate its usability, security,
privacy, computational eﬃciency and applicability.

Introduction
In the era of technological evolution, automatic recognition of users has become
fast and easy. A major issue with traditional user authentication techniques,
such as passwords, is the existence of too many password-account pairs for
the same username across several services [31]. Moreover, tokens, smart cards
and digital signatures can be forgotten or lost, resulting in increased security
threats and privacy concerns [116]. Initially, biometric authentication has
primarily been used in forensic science and the military, and it is seen as
an accurate method of recognizing individuals from their unique anatomical,
physiological or behavioral characteristics [122]. Nowadays, authentication
technologies based on unimodal biometrics and multi-factor schemes (e.g.,
single biometric modality and password) are considered more convenient by the
users of the smartphones while they are used on a daily basis in government,
health-care, ﬁnancial and business applications, Wazid et al. [223]. Moreover,
multimodal designs that integrate multiple biometrics have proven to be more
secure and reliable, managing to supersede the unimodal and multi-factor
authentication approaches due to their eﬀectiveness [39,182]. A recent report
