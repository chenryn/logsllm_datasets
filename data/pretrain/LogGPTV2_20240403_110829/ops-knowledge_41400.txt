User: I wanted to know how can I make standalone application in python.
Basically what I am doing right now is I have a template.tex file and my script generate the pdf by giving some input values.
So I have to make exe file for windows and same for linux.
I can use cx_freeze for creating exe file.
But my problem is most of people do not contain latex on their computer.
SO how can I make latex get install when I first run my exe.
Basically how to make make file.
Thanks
Assistant: You could write a installer (using NSIS or something) that does two things : 

install LateX (or make sure there is an installation of latex available), potentially by calling another installer
then install your python script (which can assume latex is now available)
