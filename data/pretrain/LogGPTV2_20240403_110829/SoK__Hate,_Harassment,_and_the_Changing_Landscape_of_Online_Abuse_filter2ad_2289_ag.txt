APPENDIX
A. Survey instrument
Our complete survey instrument included 60 questions related to a respondent’s experiences online with respect to security,
privacy, and abuse. We report only the exact text of the survey components that we relied on for our study of hate and
harassment. The survey instrument’s questions about a respondent’s age and gender were ﬁxed by the panel provider to
enable reaching a minimum stratiﬁed cross-section. As such, we were unable to ask speciﬁcally about non-binary participants
at the time of our survey. Likewise, these questions did not have a “Prefer not to say” option in order to ensure sufﬁcient
samples per strata. When asking about whether a participant identiﬁed as LGBTQ+, we omitted the question in regions
where such afﬁliations are heavily stigmatized or dangerous due to government policies, based on feedback from the panel
provider. Finally, when asking about a participant’s education level, we tailored the education categories per region. As such,
when comparing demographics across countries, we normalized to two groups: “Secondary or less” and “Some college or more”.

B. Unweighted survey demographics
We detail the unweighted, self-reported demographics of respondents from the 22 countries covered by our survey in
Table V. In the event we surveyed the same country across multiple years, we report the aggregate, average breakdown. Our
demographic proﬁle includes a participant’s gender, age, education, and whether they identify as LGBTQ+.
