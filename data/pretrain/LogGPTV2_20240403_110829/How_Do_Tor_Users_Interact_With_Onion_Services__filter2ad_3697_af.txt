slightest idea of exactly what’s being protected and what
isn’t. Vague pronouncements that "doing X is safer" don’t
help. Tor needs to stop being muddy in explaining what
it protects, and stop promoting itself to people who don’t
understand what it can and can’t do for them.’ 11/517
complained about lack of anonymity protection speciﬁ-
cally from government, big companies or even Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI). 8/517 wanted to verify
onion services as legitimate or live and only 2/517 spoke
about not wanting the dark net to contain criminal content.
Education and Resources. 24 survey respondents be-
lieved that there was a “‘knowledge” issue with not
enough resources and documentation for newcomers to
Tor and onion services. Many of our interviewees felt
similarly (7/17). Interviewees lamented about a lack of
documentation or resources that would allow newcom-
ers to learn more about onion services. P8, for example,
wanted to know how to use onion services correctly and
stop being uncertain about its properties: “Really clear
user education in the installation process would be great
for people like me . . . who are like ‘Okay, this is a thing I
can use, why am I using it again? What am I using it for?
What does it do?” Three of our interviewees also referred
to the lack of proper education as “cultural mysticism.”
Uneducated users often misunderstand concepts, as P10
explained: “The perception that these are hardcore se-
curity tools sometimes signals to ordinary users that they
are also difﬁcult or badly designed or complicated to use,
and that’s not really the case with Tor.” Even if knowl-
edge was not an issue, fear of consequences may deter
users otherwise, as P8 mentioned before: “Because it’s
also super scary. You think you’re playing with this spy
thing . . . Sometimes it’s actually a really simple technical
thing that’s not terrifying. And to demystify those things
would be really nice.”
Improved Search. 15/517 survey respondents wanted
onion services to be more accessible, such as via a good
search engine or organized database. At least four in-
terviewees also desired improved search engines. As an
example of this sentiment, S116 wrote: ‘Ask someone
to develop a really good search engine so that sites may
be found. I am sure that the dark net has to be more
than a few illicit sites that are selling stolen credit cards,
and running Bitcoin scams. I feel like when I browse
the dark net, I am ﬂoating in space waiting for another
planet to suddenly appear. Whatever content is out there
needs to be discovered, lest people will make misinformed
judgments about the dark net. The dark net should be
understood to be preeminently about privacy, not crimi-
nality.’ In addition, many survey respondents expressed
frustration about the difﬁculty of ﬁnding out if a particu-
lar public website has a corresponding onion service. A
common wish was to have a website list its onion service
prominently in a footer or on the corresponding Internet
site (3/517). Ironically, some survey respondents were
surprised that torproject.org has a corresponding onion
site—they could not ﬁnd it on the website.
6 Future Directions
Our work highlights several opportunities for improve-
ments to current onion services.
Security indicators for onion services. First, many of
our participants had an incomplete mental model of how
onion services work and trusted them less than other Tor
services, which suggests that a better indicator of the
protections an onion service offers should be made vis-
ible to onion service users. Currently, The Tor Project
is working on a security indicator for onion services [1].
Figure 2b illustrates that Tor Browser currently, in ver-
sion 7.0.10, displays an onion service connection as an
insecure HTTP connection, thus greatly “under-selling”
the security and privacy that an onion service connection
provides. The design process for such indicators should
evaluate whether users understand the meaning of the in-
dicator, as well as how it differs from an HTTPS indicator.

resorted to memorizing links to avoid security issues with
storing onion links. This problem suggests the need for
a privacy-preserving bookmarking tool that allows users
to bookmark sites without leaving a trail in their browser
storage or elsewhere on their system.
7 Conclusion
Onion services resemble the 1990s web: Pages load
slowly, user interfaces are clumsy, and search engines
are inadequate. Users appreciate the extra security, pri-
vacy, and NAT punching properties of onion services,
which gives rise to a variety of use cases. Yet, users are
confronted with a variety of privacy, security and usability
concerns that should be addressed in future generations of
onion services. For example, users are concerned about
the susceptibility of onion domains to phishing attacks,
and the onion domains that are leaked to the public In-
ternet illustrate that this threat is real—and unaddressed.
Users have limited ways of discovering the existence of
onion services, let alone navigating to them.
A range of design improvements, from better discovery
mechanisms to automatic “upgrading” to a correspond-
ing onion service when it is available are initial steps to
improve usability. Some of these desired features have
clear analogs in the public Internet, such as the padlock
icon as a security indicator for HTTPS, and HTTP Strict
Transport Security (HSTS) to automatically upgrade an
HTTP connection to HTTPS. We expect that many of the
usability design lessons from the public Internet may in
some cases also apply to onion services.

Figure 13: A click on the onion icon reveals the Tor relays that
constitute the circuit that was used to fetch the current page. As
of February 2018, the user interface is subject to a redesign [2].
(Felt et al. found the subtleties that one must consider
when designing similar security indicators [8].)
The Tor Browser’s circuit display interface is also being
redesigned (see Figure 13) [2]. As with an onion service
indicator, an evaluation of the circuit display could reveal
user misunderstandings that may improve perceptions of
and trust in onion services. For example, we found that
some users are not familiar with the concept of guard
relays and incorrectly expect each relay in their circuit to
change, which suggests the need for an improved inter-
face. Users also found it difﬁcult to verify the authenticity
of an onion site; while certiﬁcates do help, many sites still
do not have them, and some may never have them.
Automatic detection of phishing onion domains. Our
ﬁndings that some onion domains in the root DNS data
have small edit distance to popular onion domains sug-
gests that users may fall victim typos to phishing attacks;
on the other hand, because the number of popular onion
domains is still relatively small and (through our analysis
and previous work [18, 33]) relatively well-known, the
Tor Browser could raise an alert when the user attempts
to access an onion domain that has a small edit distance
to a popular onion domain.
Opt-in publishing of onion sites. Our participants often
wanted more services to be available as onion services
and did not often know if an onion service for a popular
website existed. Participants found it difﬁcult to discover
new onion services, which suggests the need for better
ways to ﬁnd active onion services. While search engines
and curated lists do exist, they do not generally allow
users to locate an onion service of interest without also
stumbling upon unwanted content. One possibility is an
opt-in public log, whereby users can learn about new
onion domains as they are added. Many participants
also expressed interest in a browser feature that could
automatically “upgrade” from a regular web site to its
corresponding onion service. (The Tor Project is currently
investigating this problem space [13].)
