User: I'm trying to separate a string into three variables where C:\Example\readme.txt could be read as C:\Example, readme, and .txt for the sake of a script I'm writing. It may be deployed in both Windows and Unix environments and may deal with both Windows or Unix paths, so I need to find a way that complies to both standards; I've read about several functions that achieve similar to this, but I'm looking for some input on how to best handle the single string inside a function.
*Note, I'm running IronPython 2.6 in this environment, and I'm not sure if that varies so greatly with standard Python 2.7 that I would need to adapt my usage.
EDIT: I'm aware of using os.path.splitext to get the extension from the filename, but finding a platform-independent way to get both the path and the filename (which I later use splitext on) is what boggles me.
Assistant: You want os.path.split + os.path.splitext. Please take some time reading the doc next time, it would have been waaaayyyy faster than posting here.
