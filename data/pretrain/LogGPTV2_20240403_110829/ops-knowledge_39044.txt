User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Replication issue with mysql 5.5.8 while restoring the dump on master server. While restoring the Mysql dump file it throws the following error.
ERROR 1665 (HY000): Cannot execute statement: impossible to write to binary log since BINLOG_FORMAT = STATEMENT and at least one table uses a storage engine limited to row-based logging.
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

The replication configuration is as below.
my.cnf
Replication Configuration:
       server-id    = 33
       max_binlog_size=40M
       log_bin=/MySql_5.5.8/log/my-bin
       log-bin-index=/MySql_5.5.8/log/log/mysql_rpllg/my-bin.index

Assistant: You most likely need to set it up for mixed format so the server can decide. 

binlog-format=MIXED

Statement format does not always work, especially if a statement contains variable such as CURRENT_TIMESTAMP. You can read about this here: https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/mariadb-documentation/log-files/binary-log/binary-log-formats/ - Clark Vera
