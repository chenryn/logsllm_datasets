User: There is a group of servers, and one of the servers needs to be used as a load balancer to realize traffic distribution among multiple servers. Please list the required steps.
Assistant: 1. First determine the load balancing technology to be used, such as round robin, minimum number of connections, etc. 2. Purchase and install load balancing software or hardware devices. 3. Configure the load balancer, and add the servers that need traffic distribution to the service pool of the load balancer. 4. Configure the server to ensure that the server can normally receive traffic distribution from the load balancer. 5. Test whether the configuration is successful, for example, you can test whether the traffic is distributed to different servers by accessing the IP address of the load balancer. 6. Monitor the load balancer and server to find and solve problems in time.
