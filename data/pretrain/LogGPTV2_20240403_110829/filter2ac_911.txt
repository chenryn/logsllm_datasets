**Title: iOS Kernel PAC: One Year Later**

In February 2019, I reported to Apple five methods for bypassing kernel Pointer Authentication on the iPhone XS. While the design represented a significant improvement over the ARMv8.3 standard, it still had some fundamental weaknesses when it came to defending kernel control flow against attackers with access to kernel memory.

This talk will examine how Pointer Authentication Codes (PAC) have (and have not) improved in the year since, and will conclude by presenting five new methods for bypassing kernel PAC to achieve arbitrary kernel code execution on iOS 13.3.
