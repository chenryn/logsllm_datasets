User:  How to setup SSH public key authentication on Linux?
Assistant: Setting up SSH public key authentication on Linux requires the following steps: 1. Generate a key pair: use the command "ssh-keygen -t rsa" to generate a public key and a private key, which will generate a public key in the ~/.ssh/ directory and private key files (id_rsa.pub and id_rsa). 2. Add the public key to the target server: first you need to log in to the target server, then use the command "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh" to create the .ssh directory, and use the echo command to copy the public key to authorized_keys file, for example "echo 'public key content' >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys". 3. Configure the SSH server: If you need to allow public key login, you need to modify the SSH server configuration file /etc/ssh/sshd_config. Find the two parameters "PubkeyAuthentication" and "RSAAuthentication", change them to "yes", and restart the SSH server. After completing the above steps, you can use the public key for SSH login.
