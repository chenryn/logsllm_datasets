User: Please design an application load balancing solution based on traffic control.
Assistant: The following is an application load balancing solution based on flow control: 1. Establish traffic monitoring: Set up the traffic monitoring function on the load balancer, and realize load balancing by monitoring the traffic of each server. 2. Set the traffic threshold: In order to avoid the system crash caused by the high load of a certain server, it is necessary to set the traffic threshold of each server. When the traffic of the server reaches the threshold, the traffic will be transferred to other servers. 3. Clear load balancing strategy: The load balancer needs to set a clear load balancing strategy, such as using the round robin method, the least connection method, and so on. 4. Intelligent routing: The load balancer needs intelligent routing, which can route corresponding requests to appropriate servers according to business needs; at the same time, priority scheduling is also required for important traffic. 5. Line switching: When there is a server failure or the service is unavailable, the system needs to perform line switching to smoothly transfer the request traffic to an available server to ensure business continuity. In short, the application load balancing solution based on traffic control needs to establish traffic monitoring, set traffic thresholds, formulate clear load balancing policies, intelligent routing, and line switching to ensure the stability and reliability of load balancing.
