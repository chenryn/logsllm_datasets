One of the Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) with which we have an ongoing collaboration is currently using this system in operational settings.

Like all routing daemons, BIRD maintains a Routing Information Base (RIB) that contains all BGP paths it receives from its peers, known as the Master RIB. However, when BIRD is used as a Route Server (RS), it can be configured to (i) maintain peer-specific RIBs and (ii) use these for peer-specific BGP best path selection (see Figure 3). In such a configuration, each member AS peering with the RS maintains a BGP session with the RS, resulting in a peer-specific RIB. When IXP member AS X advertises a prefix to the RS, it is first added to the AS X-specific RIB. If this prefix passes the AS X-specific import filter, it is then added to the RS' Master RIB. If the export filter of AS X allows it, the prefix will also be added to each AS Y-specific RIB, where AS Y is any other IXP member connected to the RS. The RS then performs a peer-specific best path selection and re-advertises the prefix to each AS Y.

IXPs typically apply import filters to ensure that each member AS only advertises routes it should. These filters are often derived from route registries such as the Internet Routing Registry (IRR) [7]. This policy reduces the risk of unintended prefix hijacking and advertisements of bogon prefixes, including private address space. For export filters, they are generally set by IXP members to control which other IXP member ASes receive their routes. Commonly, this is achieved by tagging route advertisements to the RS with RS-specific BGP community values [24]. These values, set on a per-route basis, restrict the propagation of routes to specific members. Thus, export filters allow RS peers to express their policies.

Using peer-specific RIBs overcomes the hidden path problem because the BGP decision process is executed independently for each peer. If the best route for a certain prefix cannot be re-advertised to some particular members (e.g., due to export filters), the RS can still select and advertise an alternative route to those members, provided another, non-blocked route is available. Maintaining separate RIBs for each RS peer has a cost in terms of memory and processing capabilities. However, recent stress tests and real deployment performance reports for BIRD at large IXPs [22, 33, 32] show that maintaining about 400 RIBs, each with up to 100K prefixes, consumes roughly 4 GB of memory and can be achieved with commodity servers.

### 2.5 Looking Glasses and Route Servers

Network operators often face difficulties debugging BGP routing because they cannot see the results of their route announcements within their own network. To address this, the community has set up BGP looking glasses (LGs) and route monitors (RMs) in many locations across the Internet. LGs are user-interfaces co-located on routers, many of which are publicly accessible and can execute a limited number of commands, including ping, traceroute, and BGP commands. These provide details about all BGP sessions of the router. Historically, LGs have been used by researchers to gain better visibility into the AS-level topology and IXP-specific peering fabrics [28, 18].

LGs can also be co-located with RSes at IXPs. In this setup, the LGs act as proxies for executing commands against the Master RIB of the RS and may include additional capabilities, such as listing all prefixes advertised by all peers or BGP attributes per prefix. Such LGs, referred to as LG-RS, are available at some IXPs, including DE-CIX and LonAP, and have recently been used to explore AS connectivity at IXPs [25].

### 3. DATA SOURCES

In this section, we describe the European IXPs with which we have ongoing collaborations and that have shared their IXP-internal datasets with us. We provide details about these proprietary datasets and the public IXP-external datasets available for this study.

### 3.1 Profiles of Our IXPs

We focus on two IXPs (denoted L-IXP and M-IXP) that operate a Route Server. These IXPs differ significantly in size and service offerings. Table 1 summarizes key features of our IXPs and their members, including a third IXP (S-IXP) for comparison. S-IXP, representative of smaller IXPs (less than 20 members) without a Route Server, will not be considered further in this paper.

**Large IXP (L-IXP):**
- **Members:** Close to 500
- **Peak Traffic:** Exceeded 3 Tbps in late 2013
- **Layer-2 Switching Fabric:** Distributed over multiple colocations/datacenters within a metropolitan area
- **Port Speeds:** 1 to 100 Gbps
- **Membership:** Full spectrum of networks, including CDNs, content providers, hosters, and ISPs (from Tier-1 to regional to local)
- **Service Offerings:** SLAs, remote peering, black-holing (mitigation of DDoS attacks), and free use of its RS
- **RS Configuration:** Two IPv4 and IPv6 RSes with advanced LG support

**Medium IXP (M-IXP):**
- **Members:** 101
- **Peak Traffic:** Exceeded 250 Gbps in late 2013
- **Layer-2 Switching Fabric:** Present in several locations
- **Port Speeds:** 1 to 100 Gbps
- **Service Offerings:** Remote peering and free use of its RS (two for each IPv4 and IPv6)
- **RS Configuration:** Does not support peer-specific RIBs; LG supports a limited set of commands

### 3.2 IXP-Internal Data: Route Server

For both L-IXP and M-IXP, we have access to data from their BIRD deployments. For L-IXP, we have weekly snapshots of the peer-specific RIBs starting in June 2013. For M-IXP, we have several snapshots of the Master RIB starting in December 2013. Additionally, for L-IXP, we have all BGP traffic to and from its RS captured via tcpdump.

The unique advantage of these IXP-provided control plane measurements is that they are rich enough to accurately and completely reconstruct the "ground truth" in terms of connectivity established with the help of the RS, i.e., the IXPs' multi-lateral peering fabrics.

### 3.3 IXP-Internal Data: Traffic

For each IXP, we have access to data plane measurements in the form of sFlow records collected from their public switching infrastructures. The sFlow records contain Ethernet frame samples collected using random sampling (1 out of 16K). They capture the first 128 bytes of each sampled frame, including full Ethernet, network, and transport-layer headers, as well as some payload bytes.

We rely on 4 continuous weeks of collected sFlow for each IXP. For L-IXP, we cover a 4-week period in August/September 2013, and for M-IXP, we cover a 4-week period in December 2013. We also use snapshots collected at L-IXP dating back to 2011, covering periods of two weeks.

These IXP-provided data plane measurements allow us to examine the connectivity established without the use of the IXPs' RSes (i.e., bilateral peerings). More importantly, they provide valuable but hard-to-obtain information about how the two parties of an IXP peering use that link and for what purpose.

### 3.4 Public IXP-Specific Data

We also rely on widely-used public datasets, including BGP data from route collectors such as RIPE RIS, Routeviews, PCH [13], and Abilene [6]. We refer to these as RM BGP data. Additionally, we use data from the RS-LG at L-IXP and from several publicly accessible LGs querying the routing tables of routers belonging to members peering at L-IXP.

### 4. CONNECTIVITY: BI-/MULTI-LATERAL

Using our IXP-provided measurements, we show how we can recover the actual peering fabrics at the IXPs. We also illustrate the portions of these fabrics that can and cannot be recovered using different public BGP data.

**Table 2: Multi-lateral and Bi-lateral Peering Links**

| **Type** | **IPv4** | **IPv6** |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **Multi-lateral Peerings: RS RIBs** | | |
| - Asymmetric | 5,086 | 434 |
| - Bi-only | 3,727 | 75 |
| - Symmetric | 65,599 | 3,140 |
| **Bi-lateral Peerings: Inferred from Data-Plane** | | |
| - Bi-/multi | 4,256 | 223 |
| - Bi-only | 5,705 | 61 |
| **Total Peerings** | 85,457 (70%) | 3,795 (75%) |

### 4.1 Connectivity: IXP-Provided Data

To determine if IXP members AS X and AS Y are using a multi-lateral (ML) peering at the IXP, we use the IXP-provided RS data. Specifically, for L-IXP, we check if AS X and AS Y peer with the RS. If so, we check the peer-specific RIB of AS Y for a prefix with AS X as the next hop. If such a prefix is found, we say that AS X uses an ML peering with AS Y. If AS Y is also found in the peer-specific RIB of AS X as the next hop, the ML peering is symmetric; otherwise, it is asymmetric.

For M-IXP, which only uses the Master RIB, we re-implement the per-peer export policies based on the Master RIB entries to determine peerings via the RS. If there is a route for a prefix in the Master RIB with AS X as the next hop, we assume an ML peering with all member ASes, including AS Y, unless the community values associated with the route explicitly filter the route via the peer-specific export filter to AS Y.

To determine if IXP members AS X and AS Y are using a bilateral (BL) peering at the IXP, we use the IXP-provided traffic measurements. Specifically, we require sFlow records showing BGP data exchanged between the routers of AS X and AS Y over the IXP's public switching infrastructure. We cannot differentiate between asymmetric and symmetric BL peerings with these data plane measurements.

Our methodologies yield a lower bound for BL peerings and an upper bound for ML peerings, but these bounds are generally very tight. For example, for BL peerings, the numbers are stable once we use data from more than two weeks. For ML peerings, our method does not account for the fact that some RS peers might reject the advertisements of the RS, leading to some over-counting. However, we find member ASes that use the same link for both ML and BL peering.

### Summary of Actual ML and BL Peering Fabrics

| **Type** | **L-IXP** | **M-IXP** |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Multi-lateral Peerings: RS RIBs** | | |
| - Asymmetric | 5,086 | 434 |
| - Bi-only | 3,727 | 75 |
| - Symmetric | 65,599 | 3,140 |
| **Bi-lateral Peerings: Inferred from Data-Plane** | | |
| - Bi-/multi | 4,256 | 223 |
| - Bi-only | 5,705 | 61 |
| **Total Peerings** | 85,457 (70%) | 3,795 (75%) |

This summary provides our best efforts to reconstruct the actual ML and BL peering fabrics of our IXPs.
