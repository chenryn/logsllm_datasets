ABSTRACT
Biometrics have been widely adopted for enhancing user authenti-
cation, beneting usability by exploiting pervasive and collectible
unique characteristics from physiological or behavioral traits of
human. However, successful attacks on “static” biometrics such as
ngerprints have been reported where an adversary acquires users’
biometrics stealthily and compromises non-resilient biometrics.
To mitigate the vulnerabilities of static biometrics, we lever-
age the unique and nonlinear hand-surface vibration response and
design a system called V to defend against various attacks
including replay and synthesis. The V system relies on two
major properties in hand-surface vibration responses: uniqueness,
contributed by physiological characteristics of human hands, and
nonlinearity, whose complexity prevents attackers from predicting
the response to an unseen challenge. V employs a challenge-
response protocol. By changing the vibration challenge, the system
elicits input-dependent nonlinear “symptoms” and unique spec-
trotemporal features in the vibration response, stopping both replay
and synthesis attacks. Also, a large number of disposable challenge-
response pairs can be collected during enrollment passively for
daily authentication sessions.
We build a prototype of V with an o-the-shelf vibra-
tion speaker and accelerometers to verify its usability and security
through a comprehensive user experiment. Our results show that
V demonstrates both strong security and long-term consis-
tency with a low equal error rate (EER) of 5.8% against imperson-
ation attack while correctly rejecting all other attacks including
replay and synthesis attacks using a very short vibration challenge.

1 INTRODUCTION
The mass proliferation of “smart” devices has created unprece-
dented security and privacy concerns to their users. One of the
signicant security concerns comes from unauthorized entities ac-
cessing and controlling user devices. Stronger access control goes a
long way towards alleviating security and privacy threats to users
and their devices. User authentication, where a user has to prove
their identity to a system, is one core mechanism to achieve ade-
quate access control.
Biometric user authentication, which relies on the unique physi-
ological or behavioral traits of the user to verify their identity, has
been touted as the solution that meets both security and usability
goals. Thanks to its low cognitive burden, it is more attractive to the
users who wish to authenticate themselves to their devices without
having to memorize a password or use an additional security device.
Several commercial and research solutions have been proposed
or deployed to achieve biometric authentication. These solutions
range from the traditional approaches such as ngerprints [14]
and iris scan [12] to the more advanced modalities such as human
touching [6, 32, 34], human speech [31, 43, 44], eye movement pat-
terns [13, 15, 33], electrophysiological measurements [2, 38, 45],
and vibration responses [5, 21, 23]. Of these modalities, vibration re-
sponse has emerged as an attractive method due to its compatibility
with commodity devices. Consumer devices, such as smartphones
and watches, are commonly equipped with vibration motor, mi-
crophone, accelerometer, and gyroscope which can generate and
measure the vibrations o the human body.
Typical biometric approaches rely on what we refer to as “static”
biometrics. An initial training phase collects physiological or be-
havioral information from the user, such as a gesture, ngerprint,
or voice print. At the authentication phase, the user proves their
identity by reusing the same information every time. The problem
lies in that human biometrics are non-resilient [24, 26, 27, 41]:
once the biometric information has been compromised, the user
cannot recover. Some biometric methods such as gesture-based vi-
bration [21] can scale to multiple traits corresponding to a specic
gesture. Their usability, however, will degrade signicantly as a
cost due to increased training eort and mental burden.
In this work, we attempt to answer this question: Is it possible to
leverage the strengths of biometric authentication while avoiding its
pitfalls? We answer this question in the armative and argue that
the key to answering this question is to consider a dynamic view of
human biometrics. The human body is a complex and dynamic sys-
tem that reacts dierently to dierent physical stimuli. If through
some training phase, an authenticating service knows the responses

to a large set of stimuli, then it can play a new and disposable stim-
ulus at each session. It collects the response and attempts to match
it to the previously recorded response. Instead of reusing the same
biometric to authenticate the user, an authenticating service can
use a new biometric for each authentication session and never use
it again. We refer to this model as challenge-response biomet-
ric authentication. This model is akin to physically unclonable
functions (PUFs) that are popular in hardware security [35].
In this paper, we present V, a system that adopts a challenge-
response protocol for biometric authentication. It leverages the
nonlinear and complex nature of hand-surface vibration. Figure 1
illustrates the use case of V. It has access to a pool of pre-
collected challenge-response pairs from a user. The challenge refers
to a vibration stimulus to the user’s hand through a surface, and
the response is the collected vibration. Due to the properties of
the user’s hand contact, each response is unique per-challenge and
per-user. At each authentication session, V plays a disposable
challenge and uses a classier to decide whether the measured re-
sponse matches the pre-collected one. By design, V is resilient
to an attacker replaying previously used biometric information.
To realize V, we have to design two core components: (1)
the challenges to play and (2) the classiers to compare the collected
and pre-collected responses.
Challenge design: A challenge is a vibration stimulus that com-
prises dierent spectral components. First, to maximize the user-
distinguishability as a biometric, a frequency sweep is used to
capture the frequency selectivity contributed by the physiological
traits in human hands. Second, combinations of sinusoidal waves
with random frequencies act as stimuli along with the frequency
sweep in disposable challenges to elicit the user-distinct and vary-
ing degrees of complicated nonlinearity in vibration responses,
including harmonics and intermodulation, which are hard to model
and predict for unseen responses.
Response classication: V is a per-user system; a V
user does not have access to other users’ response data for privacy
and security considerations. This requirement constrains V’s
classier design as it cannot obtain negative samples from other
users. To address this issue, we utilize the one-class k-nearest neigh-
bor (OC-kNN) classier, which relies on the similarity between
inference-time observations and training instances. V trains
one classier for each challenge. We devised a novel mechanism to
set the matching threshold of the classier per-user as to reduce
the misclassication rate.
We implement V using o-the-shelf speaker and accelerom-
eter. Our evaluation via 15 individuals shows the following:
• V exhibits a favorable performance in terms of security
and usability with an EER at 5.8% evaluated using long-term
authentication session against impersonation attacks.
• V can reject 97.3% impersonation samples and 100%
replay and synthesis attacks with reasonable eort in pas-
sive enrollment and an extremely short 200-ms vibration
challenge in one authentication session.
• V’s challenge-response design is resilient to variations
in the challenge design. Using shorter challenges with fewer
spectral stimuli still maintains a satisfactory EER.
2 BACKGROUND ON HAND-SURFACE
VIBRATION RESPONSE
In this section, we introduce two properties of hand-surface vibra-
tions that enable the operation of V: user distinguishability
and nonlinearity.
2.1 User-Distinct Vibration Response
A human hand exhibits unique physiological features such as geom-
etry, bone shape, bone-muscle ratio, bone density, which have been
utilized as a static biometric for a while [3]. These features lead to
the human-distinguishable characteristics of acoustic dispersion,
absorption, and reection when a person places his/her hand on a
vibration surface. Specically, the contact area between a hand and
the vibration surface aects the reection and absorption of the
surface vibration. Dierences in the contact area (due to dierent
hand geometry of dierent users) contribute to dierent vibration
propagation paths and varying constructive or destructive inter-
ferences at dierent frequencies – leading to frequency-selective
vibration responses. Moreover, the dierences in hand’s damping
and acoustic absorption relate to composition, the force and distri-
bution of contact between the hand and surface, contributing to
vibration responses that are user-distinct, too [8].
One can naively model the vibration response of a hand using
a spring-mass-damper system. Such a model, however, ignores
several practical issues, including the multipath-induced frequency
selectivity dependent on the hand-surface contact and the nonlinear
spectral interactions. As a result, an accurate user-specic model
for hand contact interaction is extremely hard to build even by
state-of-the-art 3D nite-element (FE) modeling techniques [9, 36].
2.2 Nonlinear Eects in Vibration Response
The second property that V utilizes is the nonlinearity in the
vibration responses of the hand-surface system, which is dicult
to model and predict [22, 39, 42]. Previous studies have demon-
strated that a hand itself, due to its geometry and composition, is a
nonlinear medium for acoustic propagation [9, 16].
Here, we show a model of nonlinear acoustics to explain the
complexity of vibration responses of the hand-surface system. For
a linear system, the output signal Sout is a linear combination of
the input signals Sin , which can be represented as:
Sout = A · Sin .
(1)
The complex gain only aects the phase and amplitude of the inputs,
and no new frequency component appears in the response of the
linear system. In a nonlinear system, however, like the hand-surface
system, the response will contain new frequency components. For
simplicity, we model the nonlinear response as a power-series of
inputs with dierent gains at each term:
