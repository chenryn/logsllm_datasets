## Abstract
The security of the Internet largely depends on the SSL/TLS protocol and its underlying X.509 certificate infrastructure. However, this system is vulnerable due to the liberal delegation of signing authority, where a single compromised certification authority (CA) can undermine global trust. Recent high-profile incidents have highlighted this vulnerability. Various countermeasures have been proposed to enhance the security of the certificate ecosystem, often focusing on detecting signs of man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. This study aims to understand the degree to which benign changes in the certificate ecosystem share structural properties with attacks, using a large-scale dataset of over 17 billion SSL sessions. Our findings indicate that common indicators of malicious activity also occur frequently in benign contexts, challenging the effectiveness of current detection methods. We discuss the implications of these observations for proposals aimed at improving SSL security.

## 1. Introduction
The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, now commonly referred to as TLS, is a cornerstone of Internet security, providing secure end-to-end channels and authentication through its X.509 certificate infrastructure. In this system, CAs issue server certificates, which clients verify against a list of trusted root CA certificates. Root CAs often delegate their signing authority to intermediate CAs, creating a chain of trust. However, the compromise of a single CA can break the entire trust chain, making CAs attractive targets for attackers. 

Recent incidents have demonstrated that adversaries can obtain rogue certificates to launch transparent MITM attacks, where victims do not see warnings because the injected certificates validate correctly. Several countermeasures, such as TACK, DANE, and pinning extensions for HSTS, have been proposed to enhance the security of the certificate ecosystem. These measures often involve monitoring for signs of MITM attacks, but they typically do not account for the frequency of similar benign activities. This oversight can lead to a high rate of false positives, desensitizing users to security warnings.

In this work, we analyze a large-scale dataset of over 17 billion SSL sessions to understand the dynamics of SSL trust relationships. We find that many artifacts commonly associated with attacks also occur in benign contexts, challenging the effectiveness of current detection methods. Our results have significant implications for initiatives like Certificate Transparency (CT), which aim to improve the security of the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).

## 2. Data Collection
We have been collecting SSL session and certificate information from eight research and university networks, covering approximately 314,000 active users. Our data collection setup involves running the open-source Bro system on gateway links, using a custom script to collect details from each outgoing SSL connection. The script uploads log files to a central database every hour, ensuring privacy by not recording any identifying client information.

### 2.1 Setup
Each data provider runs the Bro system on their network gateways. Our custom script collects timestamps, certificates, TLS extension information, and more from each SSL connection. The script uploads ASCII-formatted log files to our database hourly. Due to operational constraints, our data collection is a "best effort" process, and we cannot quantify what we miss. However, the large volume of data across multiple sites provides a representative view of real-world SSL activity.

### 2.2 Data Sets
Table 1 summarizes the data collected from each participating site. The total dataset includes 57.4 million certificates, with 47 million originating from Grid traffic and Tor servers, which are excluded from further analysis due to their dynamic nature. As of February 1, 2013, we had observed 842,700 filtered certificates, of which 622,000 were not expired. We could validate 489,600 of these against the Mozilla root store using the NSS library, which is used by Firefox and Chrome for certificate validation.

## 3. Attack Survey
We survey known attacks and analyze them through the lens of our global trust graph, where vertices represent certificates and edges represent trust relationships. Our primary focus is on attacks involving web infrastructure CAs, excluding other trust hierarchies and attacks on client/server implementations or the SSL protocol itself.

### 3.1 Trust Graph
Our data collection allows us to derive a directed graph of global trust relationships, where nodes represent CA or end-host certificates, and incoming edges indicate the CAs that signed them. The trust graph changes over time due to certificate expiration and the addition of new certificates.

Table 2 lists the top 10 root certificates and their owners, along with the percentage of total certificates traceable to them. Symantec is the largest CA in our dataset, issuing 38% of the total certificates under various brands and using 14 different root certificates. We observe certificates issued by 44 different organizations, including government-controlled roots from countries like Turkey, France, Spain, Hong Kong, the Netherlands, China, and Denmark.

| Root Certificate Owner | % Root Certificates | % Total Certificates |
|------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Symantec               | 19%                 | 38%                  |
| GeoTrust               | 18%                 | 18%                  |
| GoDaddy                | 14%                 | 14%                  |
| AddTrust               | 9.6%                | 9.6%                 |
| GlobalSign             | 8.6%                | 8.6%                 |
| VeriSign (1)           | 6.3%                | 6.3%                 |
| Thawte                 | 4.4%                | 4.4%                 |
| DigiCert               | 4.1%                | 4.1%                 |
| USERTRUST              | 2.8%                | 2.8%                 |
| Starfield              | 2.2%                | 2.2%                 |

### 3.2 Notable Attacks and Incidents
Several high-profile CA attacks and incidents have occurred in recent years, each involving an adversary attempting to inject a new certificate into the global trust graph without triggering warnings. Below are some notable examples:

#### 3.2.1 Türktrust
In early 2013, Türktrust mistakenly marked two customer certificates as CA certificates, enabling their owners to generate globally valid signatures. One customer later used one of these certificates to intercept encrypted traffic on a local network. Google detected the attack when Chrome's certificate pinning reported an unexpected certificate for *.google.com.

## 4. Analysis of Daily Changes
We examine daily changes in the global certificate system to identify patterns that may be indicative of attacks. Surprisingly, we find that many artifacts commonly associated with attacks also occur frequently in benign contexts. For example, in January 2013, the country of the issuing CA changed for 1,300 certificates. This suggests that global trust relationships, involving many independent actors with different interests and incentives, do not provide a robust basis for detecting abuse patterns.

## 5. Discussion
Our findings have significant implications for efforts to improve the security of the SSL ecosystem. Specifically, they challenge the effectiveness of Certificate Transparency (CT) and other initiatives that rely on detecting specific patterns of activity. We suggest that future efforts should focus on more nuanced approaches that account for the frequent occurrence of benign changes in the certificate ecosystem.

## 6. Related Work
We summarize related work in the field of SSL/TLS security, highlighting existing countermeasures and their limitations. Our study provides a unique perspective on the dynamics of SSL trust relationships and the challenges in distinguishing between benign and malicious activities.

## 7. Conclusion
This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the SSL certificate ecosystem, revealing that common indicators of malicious activity also occur frequently in benign contexts. Our findings have important implications for the design and implementation of security measures aimed at improving the robustness of the SSL ecosystem. Future work should focus on developing more sophisticated methods for detecting and mitigating potential threats.
