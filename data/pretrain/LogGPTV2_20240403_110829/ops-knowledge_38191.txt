User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Logged out of Facebook on all devices on a sudden. Should I be worried about being hacked? A while ago, I was opening Facebook app on Android and then I got the message "Session expired. Please log in again.". I then tried logging in with my current password and was success to log in my account. Before, long time ago, when I created this account, I'd set up two-factor authentication for my account and when I checked after I did the log in, it was still active.

After that, I opened my laptop and Chrome then went to Facebook, just to find out that the session on PC was also logged out. After I logged back in, I went to security under settings and checked the section "When you're logged in" and I saw that all of the past logged in entries are gone. The only entries I got were those log in on my phone and my laptop (also appeared to be my trusted devices).

I was thinking of someone had tried (and succeeded?) to access my account, then logged out of all current sessions. However, I did not get any suspicious prompt on my phone to authenticate an unusual log in (Like "Did you just logged in near location xxxxx?"), also no warning email from my registered email telling me about my account being accessed on an unrecognized browser or computer.

Tl;dr: Facebook account suddenly got logged out of all devices, password was not changed, logged in entries are gone, no email warning about account being compromised, no two-factor authentication prompt showed up.

My questions are:


Are there any chances that someone was successfully able to get into my account? If yes, then how could they bypass the two-factor authentication?
Is that incident normal or I should take security actions?


Thank you!

Assistant: Facebook reported a data leak today and forced a large number of accounts to log off as a precaution. Source: NY Times and Facebook.

That NYT article says "The company forced more than 90 million users to log out early Friday, a common safety measure taken when accounts have been compromised."

Additional article from The Hacker News - "unknown hacker or a group of hackers exploited a zero-day vulnerability in its social media platform that allowed them to steal secret access tokens for more than 50 million accounts" and "Facebook has already reset access tokens for nearly 50 million affected Facebook accounts and an additional 40 million accounts, as a precaution"
