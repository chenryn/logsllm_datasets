User: How to implement a Redis cache cluster with high availability architecture? Please give a specific configuration scheme.
Assistant: Redis cache cluster that implements a high-availability architecture requires the use of two solutions: Redis Sentinel (sentinel) and Redis Cluster (cluster). 1. Redis Sentinel solution Redis Sentinel is a high-availability solution officially launched by Redis. It can automatically monitor the status of Redis master and slave nodes, and automatically switch to the standby node when the master node fails. The following are the specific steps to realize the high-availability architecture of Redis Sentinel: (1) Deploying Redis Sentinel First, you need to deploy Redis Sentinel nodes on different servers. Each Sentinel node needs to specify the Redis master and slave nodes to be monitored through the configuration file. (2) Configure the Redis master-slave architecture In order to achieve a high-availability architecture, it is necessary to deploy the Redis master-slave architecture. In the Redis master-slave architecture, the master node is responsible for reading and writing operations, while the slave node is only responsible for backing up data. (3) Configure Redis Sentinel Add the IP address and port information of the Redis master-slave node to be monitored in the Redis Sentinel configuration file, and specify the communication port and password between Sentinels. An example configuration file is as follows: sentinel monitor master 127.0.0.1 6379 2 sentinel down-after-milliseconds master 5000 sentinel failover-timeout master 10000 sentinel parallel-syncs master 1 sentinel auth-pass master password (4) Start Redis Sentinel Start Redis Sentinel nodes, Let it automatically monitor the status of Redis master and slave nodes. When the master node fails, Sentinel will switch the slave node to the new master node to achieve a high-availability architecture. 2. Redis Cluster solution Redis Cluster is a distributed Redis cluster solution, which can disperse and store data on multiple nodes, and automatically perform data migration and load balancing to improve the availability of Redis. The following are the specific steps to realize the high-availability architecture of Redis Cluster: (1) Deploying Redis Cluster First, you need to deploy Redis Cluster nodes on different servers, and each node needs to specify the IP address and port information of the node through the configuration file. An example configuration file is as follows: port 6379 cluster-enabled yes cluster-config-file nodes.conf cluster-node-timeout 15000 appendonly yes (2) To add a node to the cluster, use the command redis-cli --cluster create on one of the nodes To initialize the cluster and add other nodes to the cluster. (3) Configure Redis Cluster Add the IP address and port information of the Redis master-slave node to be monitored in the Redis Cluster configuration file, and specify the communication port and password between Sentinels. An example configuration file is as follows: port 6379 cluster-enabled yes cluster-config-file nodes.conf cluster-node-timeout 15000 appendonly yes cluster-announce-ip 192.168.1.100 cluster-announce-port 6379 (4) Start Redis Cluster Start Redis Cluster Nodes, allowing them to automatically perform data migration and load balancing, and implement a high-availability architecture.
