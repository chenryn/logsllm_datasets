Background:
What is Urban Exploration?
Urban Exploration is the practice of discovering, exploring, 
and often photographing the more “off-beat” areas of 
human civilization.
“This hobby consists of a lot more than just poking about in 
abandoned buildings and storm drains and hanging out on 
web boards trying to impress people. Being an urban 
explorer is a whole way of looking at the world, where every 
ladder, door, window, grate and hole in the ground is a 
possible portal to adventure.”
- Jeff Chapman (“Ninjalicious”), 2004
What do we explore?

The UrbEx Subculture
Jeff Chapman (“Ninjalicious”) coined “Urban 
Exploration” & operated the zine “Infiltration” 
from 1996 – 2005.
Several web communities have sprung up over 
the last ten years. 
UER.CA (mostly USA)
DegGi5.com (NE USA)
28dayslater.co.uk  (UK)

Explorers vs. Tourists vs. Scenesters
Birds of a Feather
What Urban Explorers and Computer Hackers have in common
Perspective
"Behind-the-scenes" view of the word
Ability to look at things abstractly
Willing to use non-standard entry points
Secrecy
Built around a subculture with counterculture tendencies 
Distrusting of newbies
Hesitant to allow outsiders in
Script Kiddies and Tourists
Gray Area Activities
Do you use your powers for good or for awesome?
Sense of "moral superiority" while engaging in legally 
questionable behavior
Birds of a Feather
What Urban Explorers and Computer Hackers have in common
Frighteningly similar lack of fashion sense.
Black t-shirts are the shiznit, yo!
Social Engineering
Incredibly effective in UrbEx and Hacking
Higher stakes (walking away vs. county lock-up)
Exploitation by others
Taggers vs. Website Defacers
Scrappers vs. Phishers
Drug labs, gangs, and k1dd1e-pr0n collectors.
So you want to be an explorer...
Safety
This is a hobby.  We do it for fun.  Dying is not fun.
Off-limits areas do not have to meet safety codes.
Abandoned buildings may not be structurally sound.
Hazardous materials may be present.
Hazardous people  may be present.
In the basement of an abandoned building, no one can hear 
you scream.
Urban Exploring can be dangerous, even if you do 
everything right.
Safety: Rules to Live By
The "do list:"
Tell someone exactly where you are going, and check in later.
Carry a cellphone.
Carry as many flashlights as you need + 1. 
Be very wary of water-damaged floors.
Move slowly; look, then move.
Wear well fitting, covering clothing that you won't mind tearing.
Wear waterproof, sturdy shoes or boots
Consider whether gloves, a mask, or other safety equipment are 
appropriate.
Safety: Rules to Live By
The "don't list:"
Never explore alone.
Do not step/crawl/move where you can't see.
Do not put any body part you want to keep through a hole of jagged metal 
or broken glass.
Do not climb anything unsturdy.
Do not move while looking through a camera.
Do not let doors close behind you without checking their openability from 
both sides.
Do not touch, taste, or smell unusual substances to figure out what they 
are.
Safety: Health Hazards
Asbestos
There is no known "safe level" of asbestos exposure
Mesothelioma develops > 10 years later
Deadly
Asphyxiation
Enclosed spaces
Subterranean spaces
Often, no indications of "bad air" until you pass out
Disease Exposure
Pigeon / Rat / Animal waste
Human Waste
Tetanus, Hepatitis A & B are all preventable with vaccines.
Chemical Exposure
PCBs, acids, toxic waste all may be present in industrial locations
Research the facility before you enter the premesis
Wear protective clothing or masks when appropriate.
Legality*
Trespass laws vary state by state.  Look yours up.
There is nothing wrong with getting permission!
Don't break the law!   Avoid:
Theft 
Vandalism 
Breaking and Entering 
Possession of Burglary Tools
The appearance  of any of the above
Disregarding these rules not only puts you at risk, but makes 
life harder for the "legitimate" explorers.
* Disclaimer:  I am not a lawyer, and nothing in this presentation is intended to be legal advice.  If in doubt, consult an attorney.
No Lock Picks!
Stealth
Appearance
Dress to look convincing , not cool.
Walk & act "casual, but confident."
Credibility Props - coined by Ninjalicious. 
Alone vs. small groups vs. big groups
Be aware of your visibility and act accordingly.
Parking
What to do when confronted.
Introduce yourself first.
Be friendly and non-confrontational.
Offer to leave peacefully.
Do No Harm
Subscribe to the Sierra Club motto: 
"Take nothing but photographs, leave nothing but footprints."
Vandalism or B&E increases your likelihood of criminal 
charges
Creating new or obvious points-of-entry (PoE) invites graffiti, 
theft, squatters, &etc.
Be respectful of property owners & future explorers by not 
changing anything.  
Life-cycle of an Abandonment
Secured
Boarded up windows
Chained doors
Locked Fences
Infiltrated
Break-in by scrappers, taggers, homeless, &etc
At least one Point of Entry (PoE)
PoE possibly concealed from view
Promiscuous
Accessibility well established
Multiple PoEs
Regular occupancy by taggers, homeless,
   teenagers, explorers
Rapid deterioration of site 
   (graffiti, trash, theft, &etc)
Incident
Injury, death, murder, or arrest made on site
Police involvement
Property owner contacted, cycle repeats.
Discovering Locations
Open your eyes!
Check likely areas of town for the types of facilities you are 
interested in.
Railroad tracks
Industrial Areas
Downtown Areas
Commercial Property Listings
Using the Internet
Google Earth / Satellite / Street View
Web searches.  (ugh.  I mean, really, do this last. )
Do not ask explorers online "Where is that location?"
akin to emailing someone from #hack and saying "Can I have a 0day 
for xyz?"
