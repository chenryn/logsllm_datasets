anomaly refers to an IP address block being announced by
more than one AS. Such anomaly is also commonly referred
to as a Multiple Origin AS (MOAS) conﬂict. (I.b) A BGP
AS path deviation measures the difference observed between
BGP AS paths collected from a given BGP collector towards
a given IP address block.
(II) Traceroute anomalies are used to assess the impact
of control plane routing changes on the data plane. They are
extracted from the set of daily IP/AS traceroute paths. (II.a) An
IP/AS reachability anomaly refers to a permanent change in the
reachability of the probed destination host or AS. (II.b) A Hop
count anomaly quantiﬁes a possible permanent change in the
length of traceroutes. (II.c) An IP-level traceroute deviation
and an AS-level traceroute deviation measure the difference
observed between respectively IP-level traceroutes and AS-
level traceroutes. (II.d) A Geographical deviation quantiﬁes
the difference observed between the countries traversed by
traceroutes.

approach is that when an IP address block is hijacked for
stealthy spamming then a routing change will be observed
when the block is released by the spammer to remain stealthy.
Since we start monitoring a network when we receive spam
from it, we look for a routing change from the hijacked state of
the network to the normal state of the network. The goal here
is not to build a stand-alone BGP hijack detection system but
instead to collect, in real-time, routing data associated with
spam networks in order to identify spammers sending spam
from temporarily (i.e., less than one day) hijacked IP address
blocks as described in [35]. In the remainder of this section we
describe the different parts of our experimental environment in
more details.
A. Routing data collection
1) Spam IP address block selection: Our primary dataset is
a live feed of spam emails collected at spamtraps. Every day
we receive about 3,500,000 spam emails from about 24,000
distinct IP address blocks. Due to the overhead imposed by
traceroute measurements and by querying the BGP collectors,
our system can currently monitor about 8,000 IP address
blocks on a daily basis. A sample of IP address blocks is
extracted from the spam feed every hour. When selecting
blocks to monitor we prioritize the recently announced ones as
they are good candidates for short-lived hijacks as suggested
in [35]. We consider to be recently announced any IP address
block in our spam dataset that became routed within the last
24 hours, based on archived routing information bases (RIBs)
from RouteViews and RIPE RIS.
2) Traceroute and BGP monitoring: We monitor each spam
IP address block during seven days by launching traceroutes
As described in [47], every anomaly type is quantiﬁed
with a score in [0, 1]. A BGP origin anomaly is deﬁned by a

block and AS1 and AS2 are the ASes announcing IP . In
case an IP address block is announced by more than two
ASes, several BGP origin anomalies can be produced. Path
deviations are computed using the Jaccard index1 on the sets
(pd, pd+1) where pd is a path collected on day d and pd+1
is a path collected on day d + 1. Finally, IP/AS reachability
anomalies and the hop count anomaly are computed once for
all traceroutes collected for a spam network. In summary, a
network monitored for n days produces (i) zero or more BGP
origin anomalies, (ii) c × (n − 1) path deviations for each
anomaly type where c is the number of collectors (c = 1 for
traceroutes and c = 6 for BGP AS paths) and (iii) zero or one
IP/AS reachability and hop count anomalies.
2) Multi-stage aggregation and ﬁltering: In [47] we used a
decision tree to compute a global suspiciousness score on the
