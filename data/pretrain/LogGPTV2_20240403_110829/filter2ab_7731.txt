ATT&CK ID:S0575
ATT&CK Technique Name:Conti
Conti can use CreateIoCompletionPort(), PostQueuedCompletionStatus(), and GetQueuedCompletionPort() to rapidly encrypt files, excluding those with the extensions of .exe, .dll, and .lnk. It has used a different AES-256 encryption key per file with a bundled RAS-4096 public encryption key that is unique for each victim. Conti can use "Windows Restart Manager" to ensure files are unlocked and open for encryption.[36][5][37][38][31]
