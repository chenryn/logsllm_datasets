Proposition (3) derives a state estimate at kth time instance based
on system dynamics, sensor measurement and steady state Kalman
filter.
3.2 System State under Stealthy Attack
After deriving the system state estimate under normal operation,
this section will quantify the damage that the attacker can induce
to the system in the worst case scenario of a stealthy attack for
the proposed detection technique. It is assumed that the attacker
has perfect knowledge of the system dynamics, the Kalman filter,
control inputs, sensor measurements and detection procedure. In
particular, we are interested in attack sequences δk that can induce
a change in the system dynamics while trying to be hidden by
the detection technique. This class of attacks is known as stealthy
attacks. First a general attack vector δk is considered to spoof sensor
measurements.
¯yk = yk + δk ,
(10)
Where ¯yk is the sensor measurement under attack and can be
represented in terms of attack vector δk. Next, state estimation
error, residual vector and state estimate are derived for a scenario
of an attack on sensor measurements. A generic stealthy attack
vector is considered with the following properties,
• An attacker can choose an attack value (δk) from the noise
distribution of the residual vector.
• An attacker can choose an arbitrary value to inject in the
• An attacker can choose a combination or either of the above
sensor output.
two attack vectors.
A generic stealthy attack vector δk can be expressed as,
δk = β[Cek + ηk] + α
(11)
Where Cek +ηk is residual vector under normal operation as defined
by proposition (2). β ∈ R is a scalar value to choose multiples of
residual vector distribution (noise pattern). α ∈ R is to add an
arbitrary reading in the sensor measurement. The intention behind
this attack vector in Eq. (9) is that if an attacker chooses δk from the
noise pattern distribution of a sensor, it might evade detection. A
powerful attacker can intelligently choose α while keeping β = 0 to
add an arbitrary value and keep original noise pattern from sensor
measurements. Since the proposed technique depends on noise
pattern in the residual vector under normal operation of the plant
rk = Cek + ηk, choice of expression in Eq.(11) is realistic. In the
following, system state deviation is derived under a stealthy attack
scenario.
Proposition 4. Consider the process (1), the Kalman filter (3)-(5).
Under the generalized attack (11) δk on the plant, it can be shown
that the state estimation error is ek +1 = Aek + vk − (β + 1)LCek −
(β + 1)Lηk − Lα.
Proposition 5. Consider the process (1), the Kalman filter (3)-(5).
Under the generalized attack (11) δk on the plant, it can be shown
that the residual vector is rk = (β + 1)Cek + (β + 1)ηk + α.
Proposition 6. Consider the process (1), the Kalman filter (3)-(5).
Under the generalized attack (11) δk on the plant, it can be shown
j=0 [Aj Lα + (β + 1)Aj Lηk−1−j +
(β + 1)Aj LCek−1−j + Aj Buk−1−j] + Ak x0.
Proof : Due to space limitations the proof for Proposition (4)-(6) is
provided in Appendix B.
■
that the state estimation is ˆxk =k−1
One can compare expressions in propositions (1-3) and proposi-
tions (4-6). It can be seen that under an attack state estimate and
residual vector not only depends on system dynamics but also on at-
tacker’s choice of α and β i.e., the attack vector. This intuition is base
for the proposed technique where one can differentiate between
the distribution of residuals in attack and attack-free scenarios.
3.3 State Degradation under Stealthy Attack
The upper bounds on the deviation of state estimate are derived a
stealthy attack. An upper bound on estimation error is also calcu-
lated under a powerful stealthy attack.
Proposition 7. Consider the process (1), the Kalman filter (3)-(5).
Let the sensors be attacked by the stealthy attack sequence (11).
Then, if ρ([A−(β +1)LC]) < 1, it is satisfied that limk→∞ ||E[ek]|| =
γ, where γ := ||[I − (A − (β + 1)LC)]−1[ ¯v − (β + 1)L¯η − Lα]||.
Proof : From proposition 4 we have,
ek +1 = [A − (β + 1)LC]ek + vk − (β + 1)Lηk − Lα .
(12)
Assuming ρ([A − (β + 1)LC]) < 1,implies that [I − (A − (β + 1)LC)]
is invertible. Calculating the expectation on eq. (12),
E[ek +1] = [A−(β + 1)LC]E[ek] + E[vk]−(β + 1)LE[ηk]− Lα . (13)
E[ek +1] = [A − (β + 1)LC]E[ek] + ¯v − (β + 1)L¯η − Lα .
(14)
Therefore, ρ([A − (β + 1)LC]) < 1 imply that the equilibrium ¯e
is exponentially stable [6], i.e., limk→∞ E[ek] = ¯e. The Euclidean
norm on Rn is a continuous function from Rn to R≥0 [19]. It follows

that limk→∞ ||E[ek]|| = || limk→∞ E[ek]|| = ||¯e||. For the case of
limk→∞ E[ek] ≈ limk→∞ E[ek +1] converges to ¯e from (14),
For a system where ρ(A) < 1, there exists a matrix norm ||.||∗ such
that ||A||∗ < 1 and series in eq. (21) is convergent and ˆx(k) ≤ γk:
¯e = [A − (β + 1)LC]¯e + ¯v − (β + 1)L¯η − Lα,
[I − (A − (β + 1)LC)]¯e = ¯v − (β + 1)L¯η − Lα,
(15)
(16)
γk =
This completes the proof.
¯e = [I − (A − (β + 1)LC)]−1[ ¯v − (β + 1)L¯η − Lα]
(17)
■
From Eq. (17), it is observed that the error estimate depends on
attack components α and β and bounded by attacker’s choice of
these components and system dynamics.
State estimate under stealthy attack: From Proposition (6) we

Where ||J|| is the induced norm of matrix J ∈ Rpxp defined as
||J|| := maxx ∈Rp, ||x ||2=1 ||Jx||. The notation ||J||∗ stands for some
matrix norm such that ρ(J) < 1 implies ||J||∗ < 1, where ρ(.)
denotes spectral radius. Spectral radius of a matrix J ∈ Rpxp is
defined as ρ(J) = max(λp), where λp are the eigen values for J. For
ρ(J) < 1, such a norm always exist where ||J||∗ < 1 as shown by
Lemma 5.6.10 in [19]. If ρ(J) ≥ 1, we simply take ||J||∗ = ||J||.
Expression (23) provides upper bounds for the effects of the stealthy
attack on the state estimation given ρ(A) and the design of the
proposed detection technique.
3.4 Security Argument
In the previous section, a stealthy attacker is assumed, and it was
shown that how system states would deviate from normal behavior
under such an attack. In the following, a security proof is provided
for such worst case stealthy attack.
Definition 1. Linear Transformation on a random variable. A linear
transformation takes the form of creating a new variable from the
old variable using the equation for a straight line: new variable = a
+ b* (old variable) where a and b are mathematical constants. What
is the mean and the variance of the new variable? To solve this let
X denote the old variable and assume that it has a mean of ¯X and a
. Let X* denote the new variable. Then X∗ = a + bX
variance of S
with new mean: ¯X∗ = a + b ¯X and new Variance: SX ∗ = b
Definition 2. Sum of two normal distributions. The sum of two
independent normally distributed random variables is normal, with
its mean being the sum of the two means, and its variance being the
sum of the two variances (i.e., the square of the standard deviation
is the sum of the squares of the standard deviations) [18].
Residual vector under normal operation i.e. no attack can be
given by rk = Cek + ηk, as rk := yk − ˆyk. For an attack δk it’s
rk := yk + δk − ˆyk resulting in r∗
= Cek + ηk + β(Cek + ηk) + α
which is r∗

Theorem 1. Under a powerful attacker defined as δk = β(Cek +
ηk) + α which is a function of probability distribution of residual
vector rk. The original random variable rk goes to r∗
as in (24). The
statistics of this new random variable deviates from the original
probability distribution of rk. This property enables data injection
attack detection on sensors using residual vector rk.
Proof : We prove the above assertion using following cases for
δk = β(Cek + ηk) + α.

• Case 1: An attacker choose to inject data from the noise
distribution of rk without any arbitrary data α i.e. α = 0.
Resultant attack vector is δ = β(Cek + ηk) with r∗
= (Cek +
ηk) + β(Cek + ηk). As we have seen that noise pattern can be
approximated as a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and

Water Treatment Process: There are six stages in SWaT and each
stage is controlled by a dedicated PLC. Sensor measurements are
used by PLCs to control the process plant. For each stage a set of
sensors S = {S1, S2, ...} and actuators A = {A1, A2, ...} are listed
in Figure 5. An interested reader is referred to [26], for details
on the architecture of SWaT testbed. The proposed technique is
tested on different sensors to demonstrate its efficacy on different
sensing systems. A system model for complete SWaT testbed is
obtained using sub-space system identification technique [32]. Data
is collected for seven days of normal operation of the plant. For
the next four days, a range of attacks was executed. For sensor
identification based on the system model, we used the normal
operation data from SWaT testbed and used the proposed technique
to identify a sensor against adversarial manipulations of a sensor
measurement.
Figure 4: For the case of δk = (β +1)(Cek +ηk) +α. An attacker
makes an arbitrary choice of β and α. We can see that the
residual deviates from the normal pattern under an attack
facilitating the detection using noise-based fingerprints.

the resultant statistics changed even if an attacker choose

• Case 2: An attacker choose to inject data arbitrarily and
do not add anything from the noise pattern of the residual
vector. This means for the case of δk = β(Cek + ηk) + α,
β = 0 with resultant attack vector as δk = α, where α is an
arbitrary scalar value to be added in sensor measurement.
This can be considered a very intelligent attack for which
residual vector becomes r∗
= rk + α.
k
Intuitively it means that noise pattern in rk is offset with a
constant value α, an obvious consequence of which is change
of mean of the random variable from 0 to α. Using definition
1, we can see that the resultant residual vector (r∗
= rk + α)

is a linearly transformed version of rk. Variance would stay
the same but mean value goes to ¯r∗
• Case 3: This is a general case for an attack vector δk. An at-

and an arbitrary value α and constructs an arbitrary attack
with δk = β(Cek + ηk). The resultant residual vector be-
