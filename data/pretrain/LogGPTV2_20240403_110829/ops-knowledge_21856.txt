User: How to use Git for version control? Please introduce commonly used commands and workflow, and explain what each command does.
Assistant: Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple people to collaborate on development and record historical changes of different versions. Commonly used Git commands and workflows are described below: 1. Create and clone a repository: Use the "git init" or "git clone" commands to create a new Git repository or clone an existing repository from a remote Git repository. 2. Submit code changes: use the "git add" command to add file changes to the cache, and use the "git commit" command to submit the changes to the local warehouse. 3. View and compare versions: use the "git log" command to view the commit history, use the "git show" command to view the specific submitted changes, and use the "git diff" command to compare the differences between different versions. 4. Branch management: Use the "git branch" command to view and create branches, use the "git checkout" command to switch branches, and use the "git merge" command to merge different branches. 5. Remote warehouse: Use the "git remote" command to view and manage the remote warehouse, use the "git fetch" and "git pull" commands to update the local code to the latest version, and use the "git push" command to push the local code to the remote warehouse. These commands can help teams collaborate, manage code versions, view and compare differences between different versions, and push code to remote repositories and share it with other developers. By using Git, teams can collaborate on code development more easily and reliably.
