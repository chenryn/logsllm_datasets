User: I am working on am Android Scripting Environment (ASE) script in Python to replicate an iPhone app.
I need a device UID of some sort. My thoughts where a salted MD5 hash of the MAC address or device phone number, but I can't figure out how to access either of those using the Python APIs within ASE.
What can I do to create a UID in Python in ASE?
Assistant: The newer versions of ASE now include a function call to create these identifiers.
