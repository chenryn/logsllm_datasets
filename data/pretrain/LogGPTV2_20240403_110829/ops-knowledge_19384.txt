User: When running any Python script (by double clicking a .py file on Windows 7) I'm getting a Python: failed to set __main__.__loader__ error message. What to do?
More details: 

The scripts work on other machines.
The only version of Python installed on the machine on which the scripts don't work is 3.2.
I get the same error when trying to run the script from the Windows shell (cmd).
Here's an example for the content of a file named "hey.py" that I failed to run on my machine:
print('hey')
Assistant: I also had this problem.  Like mottyg1 said, it happens when the python script is run from a directory containing non-english characters.  I can't change the directory name though, and my python script needed to be in the directory in order to perform manipulations on the filenames.  So my workaround was simply to move the script to a different folder and then pass in the directory containing the files to be changed.
So to be clear, the problem is only when the directory containing the python file has non-english characters, but python can still handle such characters in its functions, at least as far as I've been able to tell.
