User: How to Monitor and Troubleshoot System Performance on a Linux System? Please list the relevant tools and commands and explain what they do.
Assistant: Tools and commands such as top, htop, iostat, vmstat, sar, nmon, perf, etc. can be used for system performance monitoring and troubleshooting on Linux systems. 1. top: Real-time monitoring of system processes, CPU usage, memory, disk and other information, among which the most commonly used are CPU usage, memory and process information. 2. htop: Similar to top, but with more powerful functions, it can be operated more conveniently through the mouse, and supports functions such as process tree display and KILL process. 3. iostat: Monitor disk I/O performance parameters, such as disk read and write speed, IOPS (input/output operations per second), response time, etc., which can be used to troubleshoot disk performance bottlenecks. 4. vmstat: Output the virtual memory statistics of the Linux system, including system, memory, disk, CPU and other data, which can be used to understand the system load and adjust virtual memory parameters. 5. sar: A system performance analysis tool that can monitor indicators such as CPU, memory, I/O, network, process, and load. It can also perform performance trend analysis by storing historical data, which is suitable for long-term system performance monitoring and analysis. 6. nmon: A system performance monitoring tool similar to sar, which supports real-time performance monitoring and can output detailed system information, such as CPU, memory, disk, network, process and other indicators. 7. perf: Linux kernel performance tool, used to analyze and adjust the performance and tuning requirements of the system kernel part, can capture system performance information, hot functions, etc., and is very helpful for kernel tuning. These tools and commands can help administrators understand the system performance status, discover problems in time, give early warning and solve them, and improve system stability and reliability.
