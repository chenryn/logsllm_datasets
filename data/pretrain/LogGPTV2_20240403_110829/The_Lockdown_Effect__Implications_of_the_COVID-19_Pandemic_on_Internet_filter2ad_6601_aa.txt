ABSTRACT
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many governments imposed lock-
downs that forced hundreds of millions of citizens to stay at home.
The implementation of confinement measures increased Internet
traffic demands of residential users, in particular, for remote work-
ing, entertainment, commerce, and education, which, as a result,
caused traffic shifts in the Internet core.
In this paper, using data from a diverse set of vantage points
(one ISP, three IXPs, and one metropolitan educational network),
we examine the effect of these lockdowns on traffic shifts. We find
that the traffic volume increased by 15-20% almost within a week—
while overall still modest, this constitutes a large increase within
this short time period. However, despite this surge, we observe that
the Internet infrastructure is able to handle the new volume, as most
traffic shifts occur outside of traditional peak hours. When looking
directly at the traffic sources, it turns out that, while hypergiants
still contribute a significant fraction of traffic, we see (1) a higher
increase in traffic of non-hypergiants, and (2) traffic increases in
applications that people use when at home, such as Web conferenc-
ing, VPN, and gaming. While many networks see increased traffic
demands, in particular, those providing services to residential users,
academic networks experience major overall decreases. Yet, in these
networks, we can observe substantial increases when considering
applications associated to remote working and lecturing.

1 INTRODUCTION
The profile of a typical residential user—in terms of bandwidth us-
age and traffic destinations—is one of the most critical parameters
that network operators use to drive their network operations and in-
form investments [29, 41, 64]. In the last twenty years, user profiles
have changed significantly. We observed user profile shifts from
peer-to-peer applications in the early 2000s [23, 49, 66], to content
delivery and streaming applications in 2010s [7, 24, 35, 37, 52], and
more recently to mobile applications [32, 67]. Although changes in
user profiles are a moving target, they typically have time scales of
years. Thus, staying up to date, e.g., via measurements, was feasible.
The COVID-19 pandemic is most likely a once in a generation
global phenomenon that drastically changed the habits of millions
of Internet users around the globe. As a result of the government

mandated lockdowns, a large fraction of the population had to de-
pend on their residential Internet connectivity for work, education,
social activities, and entertainment. Unexpectedly, the Internet held
up to this unforeseen demand [63] with no reports of large scale
outages or failures in more developed countries. This unique phe-
nomenon allows us to observe changes that may be expected within
months or years in a matter of days.
COVID-19-induced weekly growth. We observe a significant
traffic evolution in 2020 at multiple Internet vantage points in
Figure 1. The COVID-19 outbreak reached Europe in late January
(week 4) and first lockdowns were imposed in mid March (starting
on week 11). Thus, we normalize weekly traffic volumes by the
median traffic volume of the first ten weeks of 2020 (pre-lockdown
period). We can clearly identify drastic changes in the data collected
at multiple and diverse vantage points (see Section 2 for details):
Traffic demands for broadband connectivity, as observed at an ISP
in Central Europe as well as at a major IXP in Central Europe and
an IXP in Southern Europe increased slowly at the beginning of
the outbreak and then more rapidly by more than 20% after the
lockdowns started. The traffic increase at the IXP at the US East
Coast trails the other data sources since the lockdown occurred
several weeks later. While we observe this phenomenon at the ISP
and IXP vantage points, one difference between them is that the
relative traffic increase at the IXP seems to persist longer while
traffic demand at the ISP decreases quickly towards May. This
correlates with the first partial opening of the economy, including
shop reopenings in this region in mid-April and further relaxations
including school openings in a second wave in May. Our findings
are aligned with the insights offered by mobility reports published
by Google [30] and the increased digital demand as reported by
Akamai [42, 43], Comcast [18], Google [31], Nokia Deepfield [36],
and TeleGeography [62].
Drastic shift in usage patterns. In light of the global COVID-19
pandemic a total growth of traffic is somewhat expected. More
relevant for the operations of networks is how exactly usage pat-
terns are shifting, e.g., , during the day or on different days of a
week. To this end, we show the daily traffic patterns at two of the
above mentioned vantage points in Figure 2. The Internet’s regular
workday traffic patterns are significantly different from weekend
patterns [33, 38, 59]. On workdays, traffic peaks are concentrated
in the evenings, see Figure 2a. For instance, Wed., February 19 vs.
Sat., February 22, 2020: With the pandemic lockdown in March, this
workday traffic pattern shifts towards a continuous weekend-like
pattern, as can be seen in the daily pattern for Mar. 25, 2020 in Fig-
ure 2a. More specifically, we call a traffic pattern a workday pattern
if the traffic spikes in the evening hours and a weekend pattern if
its main activity gains significant momentum from approximately
9:00 to 10:00 am. For our classification, we use labeled data from
late 2019 and use an aggregation level of 6 hours. Then, we apply
this classification to all available days in 2020. Figures 2b and 2c
show the normalized traffic for days classified as weekend-like on
the top and for workday-like on the bottom. If the classification
is in line with the actual day (workday or weekend) the bars are
colored blue, otherwise they are colored in orange. We find that up
to mid-March, most weekend days are classified as weekend-like
days and most workdays as workday-like days. The only exception
is the holiday period at the beginning of the year in Figure 2c. This
pattern changes drastically once the confinement measures are
implemented: Almost all days are classified as weekend-like. This
change persists in Figure 2c until the end of June due to the vaca-
tion period, which is consistent with the behavior observed in 2019
(not shown). In contrast, Figure 2b shows that the shift towards a
weekend-like pattern becomes less dominant as countermeasures
were relaxed in mid-May.
These observations raise the question of the cause for this signif-
icant traffic growth and shift in patterns, given that many people
are staying at home for all purposes, e.g., working from home, re-
mote education, performing online social activities, or consuming
entertainment content. The increased demand in entertainment, e.g.,
video streaming or gaming, may imply an increase in hypergiant
traffic. This is in accordance with a statement by a commissioner
of the European Union which stated that major streaming compa-
nies reduced their video resolution to the standard definition from
March 19, 2020 onward [19, 48]. According to mainstream media,
some started to upgrade their services back to high definition or 4K
around May 12, 2020 [27]. Furthermore, the need for remote working
may imply an increased demand for VPN services, usage of video
conference systems, email, and cloud services.
In this paper, we study the effect that government-mandated
lockdowns had on the Internet by analyzing network data from a
major Central European ISP (ISP-CE), three IXPs located in Central
Europe, Southern Europe, and the US East Coast, and an Spanish
educational network (EDU). This enables us to holistically study
the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic both from the network edge
(ISP-CE/EDU) and the Internet core (IXPs). We find that:

Figure 3: Time series of normalized aggregated traffic volume per hour for ISP-CE and three IXPs for four selected weeks:
before, just after, after, and well after lockdown (base/March/April/June).
Daily traffic patterns are moving to weekend-like patterns.
• Relative traffic volume changes follow user changing habits—
causing “moderate” increases of 15-20% at the height of the lock-
down for the ISP/IXPs, but decreases up to 55% at the EDU net-
work. Even after the lockdown is scaled back, some of these
trends remain: 20% at the IXP-CE but only 6% at the ISP-CE.
• Most traffic increases happen during non-traditional peak hours.
• Online entertainment demands account for hypergiant traffic
surge. Yet, the need for remote working increases the relative
traffic share of many “essential” applications like VPN and con-
ferencing tools by more than 200%. At the same time, the traffic
share for other traffic classes decreases substantially, e.g., traffic
related to education, social media, and—for some periods—CDNs.
• At the IXP-level, we observe that port utilization increases. This
phenomenon is mostly explained by a higher traffic demand from
residential users.
• Traffic changes are diverse, increasing in some network ports
while decreasing in others. One example of the latter is the EDU
network, where we observe a significant drop in traffic volume
on workdays after the lockdown measures loosened, with a max-
imum decrease of up to 55%. Yet, remote working and lecturing
cause a surge in incoming traffic, e.g., for email and VPN connec-
tions. The EDU traffic shift is antagonistic, yet complementary,
