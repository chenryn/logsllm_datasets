## Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic led many governments to impose lockdowns, confining hundreds of millions of people to their homes. These measures significantly increased residential Internet traffic, particularly for remote work, entertainment, commerce, and education, causing notable shifts in Internet core traffic.

In this paper, we analyze data from various vantage points, including one ISP, three IXPs, and a metropolitan educational network, to examine the impact of these lockdowns on Internet traffic. Our findings indicate that traffic volume increased by 15-20% within a week, which, while modest overall, represents a significant increase over a short period. Despite this surge, the Internet infrastructure has managed to handle the new volume, with most traffic shifts occurring outside traditional peak hours. We observe that while hypergiants still contribute a significant fraction of traffic, there is a higher increase in non-hypergiant traffic and in applications used at home, such as web conferencing, VPN, and gaming. While many networks experienced increased traffic demands, academic networks saw major overall decreases, though substantial increases were observed in applications related to remote working and lecturing.

## 1. Introduction
The profile of a typical residential user, in terms of bandwidth usage and traffic destinations, is a critical parameter for network operators to drive operations and inform investments. Over the past two decades, user profiles have shifted from peer-to-peer applications in the early 2000s to content delivery and streaming applications in the 2010s, and more recently to mobile applications. Although these changes are typically gradual, the COVID-19 pandemic caused an unprecedented and rapid shift in Internet usage patterns.

The global phenomenon of the COVID-19 pandemic drastically changed the habits of millions of Internet users. Government-mandated lockdowns forced a large fraction of the population to rely on residential Internet connectivity for work, education, social activities, and entertainment. Surprisingly, the Internet infrastructure held up to this unforeseen demand, with no reports of large-scale outages or failures in more developed countries. This unique situation allows us to observe changes that might otherwise take months or years to manifest.

### 1.1. Weekly Traffic Growth
Figure 1 illustrates the significant traffic evolution in 2020 at multiple Internet vantage points. The outbreak reached Europe in late January (week 4), and the first lockdowns were imposed in mid-March (week 11). We normalized weekly traffic volumes by the median traffic volume of the first ten weeks of 2020 (pre-lockdown period). The data show a gradual increase in traffic at an ISP in Central Europe, a major IXP in Central Europe, and an IXP in Southern Europe, followed by a more rapid increase of over 20% after the lockdowns started. The IXP on the US East Coast showed a delayed increase, correlating with later lockdowns. While the relative traffic increase at the IXP persisted longer, the ISP's traffic demand decreased quickly towards May, coinciding with the partial reopening of the economy.

### 1.2. Drastic Shift in Usage Patterns
The global pandemic not only increased overall traffic but also shifted usage patterns. Figure 2 shows the daily traffic patterns at two vantage points. Regular workday traffic patterns, characterized by evening peaks, shifted to a continuous weekend-like pattern during the lockdown. We classified days based on labeled data from late 2019 and found that almost all days were classified as weekend-like after the confinement measures were implemented. This change persisted until the end of June, consistent with the 2019 behavior. As countermeasures were relaxed in mid-May, the shift towards a weekend-like pattern became less dominant.

### 1.3. Causes of Traffic Growth and Pattern Shifts
The significant traffic growth and pattern shifts can be attributed to the increased demand for online entertainment, video streaming, and gaming, which are primarily served by hypergiants. Additionally, the need for remote working led to an increased demand for essential applications like VPN and conferencing tools, with a traffic share increase of over 200%. Conversely, traffic related to education, social media, and CDNs decreased substantially.

### 1.4. Holistic Study of the Effects
We studied the effects of government-mandated lockdowns on the Internet by analyzing network data from a major Central European ISP, three IXPs, and a Spanish educational network. Our key findings include:
- Daily traffic patterns shifted to weekend-like patterns.
- Relative traffic volume changes followed user changing habits, with moderate increases of 15-20% at the height of the lockdown for ISPs and IXPs, but decreases of up to 55% in the EDU network.
- Most traffic increases occurred during non-traditional peak hours.
- Online entertainment demands accounted for the hypergiant traffic surge, while remote working increased the relative traffic share of essential applications.
- At the IXP level, port utilization increased, primarily due to higher traffic demand from residential users.
- Traffic changes were diverse, with some network ports experiencing increases and others decreases. For example, the EDU network saw a significant drop in workday traffic volume after the lockdown measures loosened, with a maximum decrease of up to 55%. However, remote working and lecturing caused a surge in incoming traffic for email and VPN connections.

## Conclusion
The COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns had a profound impact on Internet traffic patterns, with significant shifts in both volume and usage. Despite the challenges, the Internet infrastructure demonstrated resilience, handling the increased demand and adapting to new usage patterns. Our study provides valuable insights into the dynamic nature of Internet traffic and the importance of flexible and robust network infrastructure.
