User: I am trying to migrate my app and everything worked fine until I changed in app.yaml
from threadsafe: false to threadsafe: true.
The error I was receiving was: 
threadsafe cannot be enabled with CGI handler: a/b/xyz.app
After some googling I found:
Only scripts in the top-level directory work as handlers, so if you have any in subdirectories, they'll need to be moved, and the script reference changed accordingly:
- url: /whatever
  # This doesn't work ...
  # script: lib/some_library/handler.app
# ... this does work
  script: handler.app
Is there any workaround for this(if above research is valid), as I don't want to change my project hirarchy?
Assistant: Put a main file in the top-level directory and import all your handlers there, then reference them via that file
