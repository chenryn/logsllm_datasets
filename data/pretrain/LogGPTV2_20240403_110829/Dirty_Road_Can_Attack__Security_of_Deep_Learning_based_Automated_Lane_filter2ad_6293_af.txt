world [4, 5, 28–30]. In particular, various techniques have
been designed to improve the physical-world robustness, e.g.,
non-printability score [4, 93–95], low-saturation colors [5],
and EoT [4,5,29,30]. In comparison, prior efforts concentrate
on image classiﬁcation and object detection, while we are
the ﬁrst to systematically design physical-world adversarial
attacks on ALC, which require to address various new and
unique design challenges (§3.3).
10 Conclusion
In this work, we are the ﬁrst to systematically study the secu-
rity of DNN-based ALC in its designed operational domains
under physical-world adversarial attacks. With a novel attack
vector, dirty road patch, we perform optimization-based attack
generation with novel input generation and objective function

designs. Evaluation on a production ALC using real-world
traces shows that our attack has over 95% success rates with
success time substantially lower than average driver reaction
time, and also has high robustness, generality, physical-world
realizability, and stealthiness. We further conduct experiments
using both simulation and a real vehicle, and ﬁnd that our at-
tack can cause a 100% collision rate in different scenarios. We
also evaluate and discuss possible defenses. Considering the
popularity of ALC and the safety impacts shown in this paper,
we hope that our ﬁndings and insights can bring community
attention and inspire follow-up research.
