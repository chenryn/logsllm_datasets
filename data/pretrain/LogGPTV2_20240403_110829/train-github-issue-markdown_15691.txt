# Environment
    Windows Version: Windows 10 Education 1903
    OS Build: 18362.10005
    Windows Terminal version: 0.3.2142.0
    Any other software?
# Steps to reproduce
Opening more than certain tabs breaks the tab management. There are several
issues faced:
  * Multiple tabs become hidden and there is no way to know how many tabs are open and way to access them.
  * Tab text/label is partially hidden along with the close button for each tab after the first tab.
Unless the window is maximized, there is no way to even find the new tabs
opened. The configuration used is default.
To reproduce:
  1. Open Windows Terminal
  2. Open many tabs
The following GIF demonstrates the issue:

  * There is a way to know the number of tabs open and a way to access each one
# Actual behavior
  * Multiple tabs become hidden and there is no way to know how many tabs are open and way to access them.
  * Tab text/label is partially hidden along with the close button for each tab after the first tab.
