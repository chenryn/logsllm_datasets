trust values which are given as input matrix [S,T]T to the deep
autoencoder model. We consider a parameter α, where 0  0.3, DA-
SBCD achieves better precision value when compared to SpamCom
and Botnet Discovery methods. As µ increases, the performance in
terms of precision, recall, F-measure and G-measure of all social
botnet community detection algorithms also increase, due to the
fact that the social bots attempt to establish social relationships
with the legitimate participants. Moreover, the DA-SBCD algorithm
provides 2-4% improvement on precision over the SBCD algorithm.
The is because DA-SBCD identifies different types of malicious
activities using deep autoencoder with random-walk based trust
model and similarity among participants.
For Social Honeypot dataset, the performance of DA-SBCD algo-
rithm provides an improvement of about 6% on precision, 3% on
recall, and 3% on F-measure over the SpamCom algorithm . There-
fore, on an average, the performance of the proposed DA-SBCD
algorithm is improved around 3% over the existing algorithms.
Indeed, the F-measure result demonstrates that the DA-SBCD out-
performs other existing methods (such as SpamCom [3] and Botnet
Discovery [23]) for social botnet community detection.
Figures 5a and 5b compare the DA-SBCD algorithm with our
SBCD algorithm SpamCom and Botnet Discovery in terms of NMI
for different values of µ varying from 0 to 1. We observe that DA-
SBCD outperforms other existing social botnet detection algorithms
on both the Twitter datasets considered. Precisely, DA-SBCD pro-
vides 4-8% improvement on the NMI values. For Social Honey-
pot dataset, DA-SBCD achieved the highest N MI = 0.75 when
µ = 0.7, which is a significant improvement over Botnet Discovery.
Although SpamCom achieves better performance when compared
to Botnet Discovery, it is lower than DA-SBCD algorithm. One rea-
son for this is that the existing social botnet community detection
algorithms learn only from a single layered representation of data.
However, the proposed DA-SBCD algorithm learns from multiple
deep layers for social botnet community detection. Another rea-
son is that DA-SBCD integrates both trust and similarity values,
and learns by adjusting the parameter α for better performance
in different types of datasets. Moreover, in the deep autoencoder
model, the encoding phase of hidden layer considers only a set
of participants having high behavioral similarity edges, instead of
considering all participants. This implies that by integrating the
deep autoencoder model with trust and similarity values, the botnet
detection approach is more accurate.
6 CONCLUSION
Based on the behavioral similarity, this paper proposed a novel
two-phase model for efficiently detecting social botnet communi-
ties (i.e., malicious participants) in the Twitter network. The first
phase, called the community formation phase, uses the Social Botnet
Community Detection (SBCD) algorithm to distinguish legitimate
participants among social botnet communities. The second phase,
called the community reconstruction phase, involves Deep Autoen-
coder based Social Botnet Community Detection (DA-SBCD) algo-
rithm, where the output of the first phase community structure is
given as input to the autoencoder model to classify different types
of social botnet communities with better accuracy. Experiments are

and The Fake Project dataset. The proposed DA-SBCD algorithm
is demonstrated to outperform not only our SBCD algorithm but
also two existing botnet community detection methods, such as
SpamCom and Botnet Discovery, in terms of normalized mutual in-
formation (NMI), precision, recall, F-measure and G-measure. More
precisely, the DA-SBCD algorithm achieves around 90% on preci-
sion value and provides up to 8% improvement on the NMI value
over existing social botnet detection algorithms. As a future work,
we plan to investigate the dynamic behavior of malicious social
bots by considering their spatio-temporal features. Further, we plan
to investigate the influence of botnet communities on the online
rating and recommended systems.
