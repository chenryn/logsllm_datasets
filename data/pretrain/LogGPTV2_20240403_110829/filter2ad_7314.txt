**Slide 5/20: Fault Model for PLA**
- **Four Types of Faults:**
  - [Detailed description of each type of fault]

---

**Slide 6/20: Online Diagnosis for Nano-PLAs**
- **Basic Idea:**
  - Offline vs. Online diagnosis
- **Information Required for Online Fault Identification:**
  - Input Vector (IV): Inputs to the PLA's AND plane
  - Product Term Vector (PTV): Outputs of the AND plane and inputs to the OR plane
  - Output Vector (OV): Outputs of the PLA's OR plane
- **RAM for Each AND and OR Plane:**
  - [Description of RAM usage]

---

**Slide 7/20: Example of a D-Type Fault**
- **Condition for D-Type Fault:**
  - Pth product term wire has a value of 1
  - Oth output wire shows 0
  - The device connecting the Pth product term and Oth output wire is configured as "on" in the fault-free PLA.

**Slide 8/20: Online Diagnosis Conditions**
- **General Diagnosis Conditions for Four Types of Faults:**
  - [Detailed conditions for identifying each type of fault]
  - **Columns to Examine:**
    - C1, C2, and C3

---

**Slide 9/20: Online Fault Diagnosis Algorithm**
- **Diagnosis for AND Plane Faults:**
  - For every bit position i in IV (Input Vector), if IV[i] = 0:
    - PV = RAND[i] // Read Pattern Vector (PV) from the ith column of RAM RAND
    - For every bit p where (PV[p] = 1; PTV[p] = 1), identify a G-type fault at location [i][p]
    - For every bit p where (PV[p] = 0; PTV[p] = 0), identify an S-type fault at location [i][p]
- **Diagnosis for OR Plane Faults:**
  - For every bit position p in PTV (Product Term Vector), if PTV[p] = 1:
    - PV = ROR[p] // Read Pattern Vector (PV) from the pth row of RAM ROR
    - For every bit o where (PV[o] = 1; OV[o] = 0), identify a D-type fault at location [p][o]
    - For every bit o where (PV[o] = 0; OV[o] = 1), identify an A-type fault at location [p][o]

**Slide 10/20: Fault Masking in Nano-PLA**
- **Logic Tautology Form:**
  - fAND = f . f = f
  - fOR = f + f = f
- **Basic Idea:**
  - Redundancy integrated within the logic function
- **Figure: Fault Masking Example**

---

**Slide 11/20: Example of Tautology-Based PLA**
- **Figure: An example of a tautology-based PLA that can mask all four types of faults**

---

**Slide 12/20: Comparison of Fault Masking Schemes**
- **Original 2-Level PLA:**
  - P x I AND plane
  - P x O OR plane
  - Da = P x I and Do = P x O
- **Proposed 3-Level PLA Scheme:**
  - 2P x 2I AND plane
  - 2P x 2O OR plane
  - Extra level of AND logic: 2O number of devices and O wires
  - Overall: 4Da + 4Do + 2O devices
- **TMR (Triple Modular Redundancy):**
  - 4 levels
  - Overall: 3Da + 3Do + 9O devices

**Slide 13/20: Proposed Scheme vs. TMR**
- **Comparison:**
  - Redundancy in logic vs. voting hardware
  - Compatible with any nano-PLA implementation vs. large area of wiring for voting structure

---

**Slide 14/20: Conclusion**
- **Online Fault Diagnosis Scheme:**
  - Precisely identifies the location of errors
  - Introduces delay
- **Fault Masking Scheme:**
  - Generates correct output
  - Susceptible to multiple faults
- **Framework for Online Fault Tolerance Approaches**
