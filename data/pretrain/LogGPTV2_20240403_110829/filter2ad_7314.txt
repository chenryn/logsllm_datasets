Slide 1/20
Overview
• Motivation
• Contributions
• Fault Models
• Fault tolerant approaches
Slide 2/20
1
Motivation
• Small scale of fabrication process => 
– Large number of manufacturing defects
– High occurrences of online faults
– Expensive top down fabrication process
• New implications:
– Regularity in structure
– Online reconfigurability
Slide 3/20
Contributions
• Two hardware redundancy based fault tolerant 
approaches:
– Online fault diagnosis scheme
– Fault masking scheme
• Categories of online fault tolerance

Fault tolerance approaches
• Online repair base scheme
– Online fault detection
– Online diagnosis phase
– Reconfiguration based repair
• Cons: Delay introduced
• Fault masking scheme
– Known approach is: N-modular redundancy scheme (NMR)  
Slide 5/20
Fault Model for PLA
• Four types of faults

Online diagnosis for nano-PLAs
• Basic idea:
– Offline vs Online diagnosis
• Information required to identify a fault online –
– Input Vector(IV): Inputs to PLA’s AND plane
– Product Term Vector(PTV): Outputs of AND plane and inputs 
to OR plane
– Output Vector(OV): Outputs of the PLA’s OR plane.
• A RAM for each AND and OR plane.
Slide 7/20
An example
• A D type [missing device in OR plane] error occurs iff: 
• P th product term wire has a value 1
• O th output wire shows 0
• The device connecting P th product term and O th output 
wire is configured as “on” in the fault free PLA.

Online diagnosis conditions
• General diagnosis conditions for 4 types of faults
To identify a fault, 
We need to look at C1 and C2
and C3 columns
Slide 9/20
Online fault diagnosis algorithm
• Diagnosis for AND plane faults:
•
•
•
•
For every bit position i in IV (Input Vector) , if IV [i] = 0: //Diagnosis for AND plane faults
(a) PV = RAND[i] //Read Pattern Vector (PV ) from the i'th column of RAM RAND
(b) For every bit p that (PV [p] = 1; PTV [p] = 1), identify a G type fault at location [i][p]
(c) For every bit p that (PV [p] = 0; PTV [p] = 0), identify an S type fault at location [i][p]
• Diagnosis for OR plane faults:
•
•
•
•
For every bit position p in PTV (Product Term Vector), if PTV [p] = 1:
(a) PV = ROR[p] //Read Pattern Vector (PV ) from the p'th row of RAM ROR
(b) For every bit o that (PV [o] = 1;OV [o] = 0), identify a D type fault at location [p][o]
(c) For every bit o that (PV [o] = 0;OV [o] = 1), identify an A type fault at location [p][o]

Fault Masking in nano-PLA
• Logic tautology form
fAND = f . f = f
fOR = f + f = f
Basic Idea:
-Redundancy 
integrated
within logic 
function

Comparison of Fault masking schemes
• Original 2 level PLA has:
– P x I AND plane
– P x O OR plane
– Da = P x I and Do = P x O
• Proposed 3 level PLA scheme has: 
– 2P x 2I AND plane
– 2P x 2O OR plane
– Extra level of AND logic: 2O number of devices and O wires.
– Overall: 4Da + 4Do + 2O devices
• TMR is a majority voting fault masking algorithm having 
4 levels:
– Overall: 3Da + 3Do + 9O devices
Slide 13/20
• Proposed scheme vs TMR:
Cont..
– Redundancy in logic vs voting hardware
– Compatible with any nano-PLA implementation vs large area 
of wiring for voting structure

Conclusion
• Online fault diagnosis scheme 
– precisely identify location of error
– Introduces delay
• Fault masking scheme
– Generates correct output
– Susceptible to multiple faults
• Just a framework for online fault tolerance approaches
