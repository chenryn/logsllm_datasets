A Messages used in the survey study
A.1 Long message
Unlike many other messaging apps, messages in TextLight
are end-to-end encrypted. This ensures that only you and the
person you’re communicating with can read the messages
you send and receive. Nobody in between – including em-
ployees here at TextLight – can see the content of your
messages.
That’s because the encryption and decryption of messages
in TextLight occurs entirely on your device. Before a message
ever leaves your device, it’s secured with a lock, and only
you and your recipients have the keys to open the message
and read it. These keys are kept only on your devices, so
TextLight never has access to them.
Not all messaging apps use end-to-end encryption. For
example, SMS messaging is not encrypted. Apps that do

not use end-to-end encryption can access, read, or change
your messages, or even sell your private conversations to
other parties. TextLight, with end-to-end encryption, guaran-
tees that your messages can’t be sold because we don’t have
access to your unencrypted messages in the ﬁrst place. With
end-to-end encrypted messaging, privacy isn’t just a promise;
it’s mathematically ensured.
It’s important to note that TextLight and end-to-end encryp-
tion cannot protect against all possible privacy threats. Par-
ties such as TextLight and your internet service provider
(Verizon, T-mobile, etc.) may be able to tell that you are
exchanging messages with someone, even if they can’t see
what the messages say. Moreover, end-to-end encryption
cannot protect you from someone who gets their hands
on your unlocked phone, or from a hacker who has suc-
cessfully installed malicious software. TextLight also does
not prevent your correspondent from publishing the messages
you have exchanged.

A.3 Short messages
Conﬁdentiality (s.conf): Messages in TextLight are end-
to-end encrypted. This ensures that only you and the person
you’re communicating with can read the messages you send
and receive. Nobody in between can see the content of your
messages.
Metadata weakness (s.meta):
Messages in TextLight
are end-to-end encrypted. However, parties such as TextLight
and your internet service provider (Verizon, T-mobile, etc.)
may be able to tell that you are exchanging messages with
someone, even if they can’t see what the messages say.
Endpoint weakness (s.endpt):
Messages in TextLight
are end-to-end encrypted. However, end-to-end encryption
cannot protect you from someone who gets their hands on
your unlocked phone, or from a hacker who has successfully
installed malicious software.
Mechanism (s.mech):
Messages in TextLight are end-to-
end encrypted. Before a message ever leaves your device, it’s
secured with a lock, and only you and your recipients have
the keys to open the message and read it.
Risks (s.risk): Messages in TextLight are end-to-end en-
crypted however, not all messaging apps use end-to-end en-
cryption. Apps that do not use end-to-end encryption can read,
change, or even sell your messages to other parties.
A.4 Control message
TextLight is a messaging app with a focus on speed and accu-
racy, it’s super-fast, simple and free. You can use TextLight
on all your devices at the same time – your messages sync
seamlessly across any number of your phones, tablets or com-
puters.
With TextLight, you can send messages, photos, videos
and ﬁles of any type (doc, zip, mp3, etc), as well as create
groups for up to 200,000 people or channels for broadcasting
to unlimited audiences. You can write to your phone contacts
and ﬁnd people by their usernames. As a result, TextLight is
like SMS and email combined – and can take care of all your
personal or business messaging needs. In addition to this, we
support voice calls.

B Messages used in the app study
B.1 Short messages
• Messages in TextLight are end-to-end encrypted. End-to-
end encryption ensures that only you and the person you’re
communicating with can read the messages you send and
receive. Nobody in between can see the content of your
messages.
• Even though messages in TextLight are end-to-end en-
crypted, parties such as TextLight and your internet/mobile
service provider (Verizon, AT&T, etc.) may still be able to
tell that you are exchanging messages with someone, even
if they can’t see what the messages say.
• We use end-to-end encryption in TextLight to keep your
messages safe, but end-to-end encryption cannot protect
you from someone who gets their hands on your unlocked
phone, or from a hacker who has successfully installed
malicious software on your phone.
• End-to-end encryption ensures that before a message ever
leaves your device, it’s secured with a lock, and only you
and your recipients have the keys to open the message and
read it. Messages in TextLight are end-to-end encrypted.
• Not all messaging apps use end-to-end encryption. Apps
that do not use end-to-end encryption can read, change, or
even sell your messages to others. That’s why we always
use end-to-end encryption in TextLight.

C Mapping of educational messages to ﬁnd-
ings of our previous work [9]
A mapping between suggestions in our previous work and
educational messages in this work are given in this Appendix.
All short messages mentioned below are also included in the
Long message.
• Conﬁdentiality: Previously we had suggested that users
ﬁnd conﬁdentiality the most important aspect of e2e
encryption. We emphasize this point in s.conf, s.mech.
• Risks: We directly communicate the risks of not using
e2e encrypted systems with s.risk. Our previous work
noted that that conveying the risks of not using e2e en-
cryption was important and surprising to multiple users.
• Mechanism: We dedicate a short message to the inner
workings of e2e encryption (s.mech). As suggested pre-
viously, we use a brief analogy and emphasize that this
mechanism ensures conﬁdentiality. This aims to strike
a balance between users who want to learn more about
the technical aspects of e2e encryption, and users who
are confused by it.
• Endpoint and metadata weaknesses: We had previ-
ously suggested that it is important to mention weak-
nesses of e2e encryption, we achieve this with s.meta
and s.endpt. s.endpt emphasizes that the endpoints aren’t
protected by e2e encryption, and s.meta conveys that e2e
encryption by itself does not protect metadata. Although
metadata weakness wasn’t emphasized in our prior work,
we think it’s an important limitation of e2e encryption
and therefore include it.
In addition, we follow other recommendations such as
avoiding integrity and authenticity topics, employing risk com-
munication methods, and integrating the messages in regular
communication workﬂows.
