slider to select one of the predefined levels, which implies
consent to all of the previously listed categories.
• Vendor-based notices offer even more fine-grained control
by allowing visitors to accept or decline cookies for each
third-party service used by the website. Such notices are part
of IAB Europe’s Transparency and Consent Framework [14],
which refers to its advertising partners as “vendors.”

Text. The text displayed by consent notices also varies widely.
It should inform the website visitor of the fact that the website
uses cookies or similar tracking technology and may list additional
information such as the purpose of the data collection. Depending
on the choices offered, the notice may provide instructions for
consenting to (or denying) the use of cookies. Table 1 provides
an overview of common text contents of consent notices for the
following typical pieces of information:
• Collection. What the visitor consents to, which can be the
use of cookies (94.8 %), the collection of their personal data
(1.4 %), both (1.6 %), neither (0.9 %), or something else (such
as the website’s privacy policy; 1.3 %).
• Processor. Who collects this information, which can be
specifically limited to the first party (0.7 %), third-party ser-
vices (2.6 %), both (21.1 %), or refer to an unspecified party
(usually denoted by the pronoun “we” or the domain/website
name; 75.5 %).
• Purposes. These may be specific (e. g., “audience measure-
ment” or “ad delivery”; 38.6 %), generic (e. g., “to improve
user experience”; 45.5 %), or not specified at all (16.9 %).
Nudging & Dark Patterns. Consent notices often (57.4 %) use
interface design to steer website visitors towards accepting privacy-
unfriendly options. Typical techniques include color highlighting of
the button to accept privacy-unfriendly defaults, hiding advanced
settings behind hard to see links, and pre-selecting checkboxes that
activate data collection [10]. We observed all of these techniques
in our sample.
Formatting. We found that, unless predetermined by the con-
sent library used, the choice of fonts and colors typically matched
that of the underlying website. The formatting of consent notices
may also be influenced by the website’s business requirements [17],
e. g., sites relying on monetization via online behavioral advertis-
ing (OBA) are unlikely to steer their visitors towards an opt-out
mechanism by making this option highly visible.
Link to additional information. Consent notices may include
a link to the website’s privacy policy, a designated cookie policy, or
4
a website providing additional information about cookies – 92.3 %
of the notices in our sample contain such a link to additional infor-
mation. In Table 1, we marked as “other” consent notices where the
full privacy policy was already included in the notice itself (1.1 %).
Table 1 shows that the majority of consent notices are placed at
the bottom of the screen (58 %), not blocking the interaction with
the website (93 %). They offer no options besides a confirmation
button that does not do anything (86 %), and most try to nudge users
towards consenting (57 %). While nearly all notices (92 %) contain
a link to a privacy policy, only a third (39 %) mention the specific
purpose of the data collection or who can access the data (21 %).
3 METHOD
Given the legal requirements for explicit, informed consent, the
vast majority of cookie consent notices we analyzed are likely not
compliant with European privacy law. To further investigate the
effects of different combinations of these properties on consent
behavior, we conducted a field study with consent notices on a
German e-commerce website.
We investigated the effect of the following parameters on users’
interactions with consent notices:
(1) The position of the notice, as notices displayed in some parts
of the screen are more likely to be ignored.
(2) The number of choices offered by the notice, which is in-
fluenced by legal requirements and the need to give users
actual control over the website without overwhelming them
with too many options.
(3) Nudging visitors towards giving consent through highlight-
ing and preselection, since this may cause people to consent
who would not have made the same decision otherwise.
(4) The presence of a privacy policy link and whether the notice
refers to “cookie use” (technical language) or “data collec-
tion” (non-technical language). These differences in wording
may influence people’s expectations of the website’s data
processing practices and thus their consent decision.
We did not evaluate the effects of the following parameters:
blocking (because the owner of our partner website asked us not
to block access to the site), formatting (because of the multitude
of options – we chose the same color scheme as in the notice
previously used on the website), and size (which is difficult to vary
consistently across devices).
From the end of November 2018 to mid-March 2019, we con-
ducted three between-subjects experiments to determine if, and
how, different parameters of consent notices influence interaction
rates. In each experiment, we tested variants for one or two of the
parameters described in Table 1: position in Experiment 1, choices
and nudging in Experiment 2, and wording and the presence of a pri-
vacy policy link in Experiment 3. The respective other parameters
were kept constant in an experiment.
3.1 Study Setup
We partnered with a German-language e-commerce website based
on WordPress. The website has 15,000–20,000 unique visitors per
month, most of which are single-page visitors that reach the site
from a search engine looking for product information and reviews.
The third-party services used by the website are Google Fonts and
the CSS framework Ionic for design, Google Analytics embedded via
Google Tag Manager for audience measurement, Facebook social
media buttons, embedded YouTube videos, and targeted advertise-
ments delivered by Google Ads. All of these services store cookies
in the visitor’s browser.
We modified a WordPress plugin, Ginger – EU Cookie Law [26],
to test different notice variants. Ginger was selected because it can
block cookies before opt-in, log users’ consent, and because it was
released under a GPLv2 license. By the time of publication of this
paper, the original version of the plugin had been discontinued. We
added support for checkbox-based and “no option” notices. We did
not implement “slider” notices because we considered them a less
compliant variant of the “categories” type.
The plugin was further modified to function as follows in our
study: When a user first visited our partner website, they were
shown one consent notice. Which notice of the n test conditions
in the current experiment was displayed was determined in round-
robin fashion. The ID of the displayed notice was stored in a cookie
in the participant’s browser to ensure visitors who did not click
the notice would continue to see the same notice across subpages
and recurring visits. Each participant was assigned a unique iden-
tifier: pid=SHA-256(ip_address||user_aдent). The participant’s IP
address was discarded after computation of pid. The participant
ID was stored in another cookie, together with the participant’s
consent as required by Article 7 GDPR1.
If the visitor clicked any interaction element that would usually
cause a consent notice to disappear, i. e., the ‘X’ discard button,
“Accept,” “Decline,” or “Submit,”2 the notice did not disappear in-
stantly. Instead, the notice content was replaced with an invitation
1The legal bases for storing the cookie that remembers the banner ID are Article 6(1)(e)
GDPR (public interest in conducting this study) and Article 6(1)(c) GDPR (compliance
with a legal obligation) for storing the consent cookie.
2In all experiments, all texts in the consent notice and survey were in German to
match the website’s language. Survey responses were also in German. The authors
translated all texts and responses into English for this paper. Both the original and the
translated consent notices and the survey are available in our GitHub repository at
https://github.com/RUB-SysSec/uninformed-consent.

to take an online survey about their experiences with this and other
consent notices (see Appendix B). The invitation disclosed that
this was a university study and that participants could win one of
15 25-euro shopping vouchers. Users could either click “Discard”
to close the notice, or select “Participate” to open the survey in a
new browser tab. The survey was created in a LimeSurvey instance
running on a web server hosted by the authors.
If the website visitor did not interact with the consent notice, the
content of the notice was automatically replaced with the survey
invitation 30 seconds after the page had fully loaded. This is because
we also wanted to explore users’ reasons for not interacting with
consent notices. Web analytics data for our partner website showed
that 95 % of all users who had interacted with the website’s previous
consent notice had done so within 30 seconds of accessing the site.
Thus we assumed that website visitors who did not interact with
the consent notice within 30 seconds would not have clicked it at a
later point in time.
We modified the Ginger plugin’s logger add-on to create log
entries whenever a participant clicked an interaction element on the
notice. Log events were also triggered upon page load, when links to
the privacy policy or survey were clicked, when the consent notice
content was auto-replaced with the survey invitation, and when
the participant dismissed this invitation. Each log entry consisted
of a timestamp, the participant’s ID (pid), the ID of the consent
notice they had seen, the event they had triggered, their screen
resolution, operating system, browser, and whether an ad blocker
had been detected.3
3.2 Experiment 1: Position
Experiment 1 ran from November 30 to December 18, 2018, i. e., for
19 days. We had observed consent notices being shown at various
screen positions and wanted to determine the effect of placement
on interaction with the cookie consent notice to inform our subse-
quent experiments. The research question for Experiment 1 was:
Does the cookie consent notice’s position on a website influence a
visitor’s consent decision? In order to encourage user interaction,
we displayed a “binary” notice without nudging (see Figure 1(bb)),
the simplest type offering an actual choice. We tested the notice in
six different positions (see Figure 2). We could not test the center
position as our partner asked us to not block access to their website.
3.3 Experiment 2: Number of Choices, Neutral
Presentation vs. Nudging
From December 19, 2018 to January 28, 2019, we conducted Ex-
periment 2, which focused on the effects of given choices and pre-
selections on consent. In our analysis of consent notices, we had
identified various complexity levels of choices offered and meth-
ods to emphasize certain options. Prior work has shown that the
design and architecture of choices heavily influences people’s de-
cisions [43, 50]. While this effect has also been shown successful
in improving user privacy [1, 2], in practice it is most often used
to make users share more information [10]. Website owners often
have an interest in getting visitors to agree to the use of cookies
and hence highlight certain choices in the consent notice to nudge
3We used BlockAdBlock 3.2.1 (https://github.com/sitexw/BlockAdBlock) to detect ad
blocking functionality in the visitor’s browser.
Figure 1: Cookie consent notices with different choice mechanisms and nudging used in our experiments: (a) a binary notice
in two variants, one nudging visitors to click “Accept” (aa) and one presenting both choices equally (bb); (b) a no-option notice

checkboxes (nudging); and (e) a vendor-based notice with unchecked checkboxes (non-nudging).
has an “Accept” button which is not highlighted.
the banner. There is no nudging variant because the notice
does not offer any choice.
• Confirmation–Non-nudging (Figure 1 (c)): This notice
• Confirmation–Nudging: Same as the Confirmation–Non-
nudging notice, but the “Accept” button is highlighted (like
the “Accept” button in Figure 1 (a) (aa)).
• Binary–Non-nudging (Figure 1 (a) (bb)): The “Accept” and
“Decline” buttons are formatted the same way, neither is
emphasized.
• Binary–Nudging (Figure 1 (a) (aa)): Same as Binary–Non-
nudging but only the “Accept” button is highlighted in a
contrasting color.
• Categories–Non-nudging: Same as notice (d) in Figure 1,
but with unchecked checkboxes. The “Necessary” category
cannot be unchecked, as is common practice.
• Categories–Nudging (Figure 1(d)): Same as Categories–
Non-nudging but with pre-checked checkboxes for all cate-
gories.
• Vendors–Non-nudging (Figure 1(e)): Similar to the cate-
gories variant, but the checkboxes correspond to the third-
party services used by our partner website.
• Vendors–Nudging: Same as Vendors–Non-nudging but with
pre-selected checkboxes.
For the category-based notices, we had to map the third-party
services used by the website to different categories. We manu-
ally inspected the 434 category-based notices in our initial set of
5,087 consent notices for common category wording. For example,
we found advertising cookies to be categorized as “marketing” or
“advertising”; web analytics was also referred to as “performance

visitors towards accepting. We observed this for 57.4 % of the no-
tices in our sample. Our research question therefore was: Does the
number of choices and nudging through emphasis or pre-selection in
consent notices influence user’s consent decisions?
For nudging, we used pre-checked checkboxes and buttons high-
lighted in contrasting colors, techniques often used to nudge users
towards accepting default settings [10]. While we observed that
most category- and vendor-type notices in practice display such
fine-grained controls only after the visitor clicked “Settings,” we
chose to immediately display all available options to ensure that
our conditions only varied in the number and framing of choices.
In Experiment 2, we displayed the following consent notices at the
position determined in Experiment 1 to yield the highest interaction
rates:
• No option (Figure 1 (b)): In line with many notices we ob-
served, we added an ‘X’ in the top-right corner to dismiss

cookies,” “statistics,” or “audience measurement.” This yielded the
following category–third party mappings:
• Necessary: Cookies to remember the displayed notice and
• Personalization & Design: Ionic, Google Fonts
• Analytics: Google Analytics
• Social Media: Facebook, YouTube
• Marketing: Google Ads
For all category- and vendor-based notices in Experiments 2 and
3, the available options were displayed in random order, except for
the “Necessary” category, which was always displayed first as in
the majority of category-based notices we had observed.
In Experiments 2 and 3, we increased the font size of the banner
message, resulting in larger notices. We did this to fix an imple-
mentation bug of the Ginger plugin that had caused the text to be
displayed in a very small font on some smartphones in portrait
mode.
3.4 Experiment 3: (Non-)Technical Language
and Privacy Policy Link
Experiment 3 was conducted from January 29 to March 15, 2019.
In this experiment, we tested the influence of the presence of a
link to the website’s privacy policy. Previous research suggests that
(American) Internet users have consistent misconceptions about
privacy policies, indicated by the fact that a majority believes the
existence of a privacy policy means that a website cannot share
personal data with third parties [47]. At the same time, Martin [27]
showed that the existence of a reference to a privacy policy in the
context of data sharing explanations increases mistrust in a website.
There are further known misconceptions about what cookies actu-
ally are and what they are used for [19, 30]. To learn more about
the influence of these factors in the context of consent notices, our
research question was: Does the presence of a privacy policy link or
mention of cookies influence users’ consent decisions?
The base notice for this experiment was the Category–Non-
nudging notice from Experiment 2 because of GDPR’s data pro-
tection by default requirement and the ability to provide consent
for specific purposes with checkboxes. We chose a category-based
notice over a vendor-based one due to the results of Experiment 2
(see Section 4.3). The notice text for this experiment was: “This
website [uses cookies | collects your data] to analyze your usage of
this site, to embed videos and social media, and to personalize the
ads you see. Please select for which purposes we are allowed to use
your data. [You can find more information in our privacy policy].”
We tested the following conditions:
• Technical–PP Link: The original Categories–Non-nudging
notice from Experiment 2. It uses both technical language
(“uses cookies”) and a sentence with a link to the website’s
privacy policy.
• Technical–No PP Link: Same as Technical–PP Link, but
the privacy policy sentence was replaced with whitespace
to keep the size of the notices consistent.
