## 1. Introduction

In the context of BitTorrent, locality refers to the degree of disparity in swarm dynamics from both spatial and temporal perspectives. According to [1], more than 45% of peers exhibit over 30% more connections within the same Internet Service Provider (ISP) compared to a random graph, indicating a bias towards local peers. Additionally, [2] found that (1) a significant portion of BitTorrent traffic does not reach higher-tier ISPs, and (2) BitTorrent usage patterns vary diurnally.

While previous studies have focused on demonstrating the extent of localized phenomena in swarm dynamics, our research aims to investigate these phenomena from a content perspective, which we term "content locality." Our contributions include:
1. Observing that (i) the locations of consumers are spatially skewed, and (ii) the number of daily swarm participants is temporally skewed.
2. Demonstrating that cultural aspects of content influence user participation in swarms from a spatial perspective.
3. Finding that the time-sensitivity of content (e.g., TV series) affects temporal locality.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Data Collection

We employed the same methodology as [3] to collect BitTorrent user traces. Our dataset, collected over 33 days from April 6 to May 9, 2011, includes 27,371 torrents and 2,247,035 unique IP addresses. Using Maxmind, we identified the locale of each peer, mapping IP addresses to their respective countries or Autonomous Systems (ASes). The dataset contains 224 countries and 10,529 ASes. We analyzed content locality across seven categories: TV, Porn, E-book, Movie, Music, Application, and Game.

### 2.2 Locality Metrics

#### Spatial Locality

We define spatial locality as the probability that two randomly selected peers in the same swarm share the same locale. This is calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Swarm Locality} = \frac{2}{n(n - 1)} \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \delta(L(v_i), L(v_j))
\]

where \(L(v)\) denotes the locale (e.g., AS or country) of a peer \(v\), and \(\delta(i, j)\) is the Kronecker delta function (\(\delta(i, j) = 1\) if \(i = j\), and \(\delta(i, j) = 0\) otherwise).

#### Temporal Locality

To measure temporal locality, we define the daily locality as the probability that two peers in the same swarm download the torrent on the same day.

## 3. Spatial and Temporal Locality

### Existence of Locality

To determine the presence of spatial and temporal locality in swarms, we compared the locality of real swarms with that of hypothetical swarms, where peers are uniformly distributed among observed locales and dates. Figure 1 shows that the swarm locality in real swarms is significantly higher than in hypothetical ones. In the spatial domain, the ratio of swarm locality to hypothetical locality increases from 1.80 times for continents to 4.56 times for countries and 11.49 times for ASes. Similarly, the daily locality of swarm populations is 1.46 times higher than the hypothetical uniform distribution, indicating temporal skewness in swarm dynamics.

### Spatial Locality

Figure 2(a) illustrates the average swarm locality for each content category. Movies and TV categories exhibit higher swarm locality, while the Porn category shows lower locality, despite all three being video-centric. This disparity can be attributed to the style of content consumption; movies and TV content often require understanding of language and culture, whereas porn films do not. Applications and games also show low swarm locality, likely because multi-language support is typically included in the main program or available for download, making language less important.

### Temporal Locality

Figure 2(b) displays the daily locality across the seven content categories. TV torrents exhibit higher temporal locality than other content types, except for E-books. Analysis reveals that the periodic nature of TV torrents (with 58% of titles following a periodical naming convention, e.g., 'S**E**') contributes to this high temporal locality. E-book torrents also show high temporal locality due to their shorter average lifetime (8-9 days) compared to other categories (11-12 days).

## 4. Concluding Remarks

Our study aimed to capture and quantify swarm dynamics in terms of spatial and temporal locality from a content perspective. We found that cultural factors, such as language, significantly influence swarm dynamics, leading to diverse spatial locality patterns. Additionally, content properties like periodic publication characterize temporal locality. Future work will explore content locality from various perspectives, including content types, characteristics of content publishers, and user preferences, with the goal of leveraging this information for efficient content prefetching and caching.
