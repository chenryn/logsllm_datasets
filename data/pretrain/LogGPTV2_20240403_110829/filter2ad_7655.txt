Introduction
The locality in BitTorrent refers to how much disparity exists in swarm dynamics
from the spatial and temporal perspectives. According to [1], 30% more connec-
tions among peers in the same ISP compared to a random graph are observed
for more than 45% of peers, which indicates that BitTorrent connections among
peers are biased to local peers. [2] found that (1) substantial BitTorrent traﬃc
does not reach higher-tier ISPs, and (2) BitTorrent’s temporal usage patterns
vary in a diurnal fashion.
While these studies focus on showing how much localized phenomena occur in
swarm dynamics, we try to investigate the locality phenomena in BitTorrent from
a content perspective (i.e., content categories), which we call content locality.
We make the following contributions: (1) We observe that (i) locations of
consumers are spatially skewed and (ii) numbers of per-day swarm participants
is also temporally skewed, (2) We show that the cultural aspects of content aﬀect
how users participate in swarms from a spatial perspective, and (3) We ﬁnd that
the time-sensitivity of content (e.g., TV series) aﬀects temporal locality.
2 Methodology
2.1 Data Collection
We use the same methodology to obtain the BitTorrent user traces as [3]. Our
datasets, which have been collected for 33 days for April 6 to May 9, 2011, consist
of 27,371 torrents and 2,247,035 peers (unique IP addresses). Using Maxmind,
we have identiﬁed the user’s locale, which maps each IP address (of a peer) to its
country or autonomous system (AS). There are 224 countries and 10,529 ASes
from the datasets. Throughtout this paper, we investigate the content locality
depending on the seven content categories: TV, Porn, E-book, Movie, Music,
Application, and Game.
2.2 Locality Metrics
Spatial Locality: We investigate the locality of a swarm by considering the con-
nectivity among peers who actually exchange data among one another.

(a) Spatial Locality
(b) Temporal Locality

thetical locality

To this end, we deﬁne the swarm locality as the probability that randomly-
selected two nodes (in the same swarm) have the same locale:
2
n(n − 1)
n−1(cid:2)
n(cid:2)
i=1
j=i+1
δ (L (vi) , L (vj)),
where L(v) denote the locale (e.g., AS or country) of a peer v, δ(i, j) is the
Kronecker’s delta (δ(i, j) = 1 if i = j, and δ(i, j) = 0 otherwise).
Temporal Locality: To investigate how swarm dynamics is temporally charac-
terized, we deﬁne a metric: daily locality which indicates the probability whether
two peers in the same swarm download the torrent in the same day.
3 Spatial and Temporal Locality
Existence of Locality: To see whether the spatial and temporal locality exists
in a swarm, we ﬁrst plot the swarm locality of the real swarms, compared with
that of hypothetical swarms where peers are uniformly distributed among the
observed locales and dates. In Figure 1, we observe that the swarm locality of the
real swarms is signiﬁcantly higher than that of the hypothetical ones. In spatial
domain, as the locale is changed from continents to countries and to ASes, the
ratio between the swarm locality and the hypothetical one increases from 1.80
times to 4.56 times and to 11.49 times, respectively. Like spatial locality, we ﬁnd
that the daily locality of swarm population is higher (1.46 times) than that of
the hypothetical uniform distribution, which indicates that the swarm dynamics
in terms of population is temporally skewed.
Spatial Locality: We next plot the average swarm locality for each content
category in Figure 2(a). We observe that torrents in Movie and TV categories
have the higher swarm locality while the ones in Porn category exhibit the lower
swarm locality, even though the three categories are video-centric. We believe
that the disparity across the three categories is due to the style of content con-
sumption; movies or video content typically requires the understanding of con-
tent by languages and cultures, while porn ﬁlms typically do not need such

backgrounds. Torrents in App and Game categories have low swarm locality as
shown in Figure 2(a). For the most of App and Game torrents, multi-language-
support packages are either included in the main program or downloadable from
the web sites. Hence, the language is not important for the App and Game
torrents.
Temporal Locality: Figure 2(b) shows the daily locality across the seven con-
tent categories. TV torrents exhibit higher temporal locality than torrents of
other content types except for E-book. To investigate why TV torrents show
high daily locality, we analyze and ﬁnd that periodicity for a TV torrent make
higher temporal locality (58% of titles of TV torrents follow periodical naming
convention (i.e., ‘S**E**’, where ‘S’ and ‘E’ stand for series and episode, respec-
tively.)). Interestingly, E-book torrents also show high temporal locality because
the average lifetime of an E-book torrent is around 8∼9 days, which is shorter
than that of a torrent in other the categories (around 11∼12 days). The shorter
lifetimes of E-book swarms are likely to result in the high temporal locality.
4 Concluding Remarks
We conducted a measurement study to capture and quantify the swarm dynam-
ics in terms of spatial and temporal locality from a content perspective. We
found that cultural factors (e.g., language) heavily aﬀect the pattern of swarm
dynamics, which results in diverse phenomena in the spatial locality. Also, we
observed that the content properties like periodic publication characterize the
temporal locality. Our ongoing work includes investigating the content locality
from a diverse perspective of content properties (e.g., content types, character-
istics of content publishers, or preferences of users) and exploring the possibility
to exploit the content locality for eﬃcient content prefetching and caching.
