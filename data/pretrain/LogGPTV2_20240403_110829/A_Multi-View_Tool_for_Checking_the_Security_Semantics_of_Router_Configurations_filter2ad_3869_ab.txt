### Potential Security Risks and Configuration Issues

1. **Unsecured Services**: Activated services that pose potential security risks, and missed opportunities to enable useful additional security features such as password protection, encryption, and authentication.
2. **Password Reuse**: Strongly encrypted passwords reused in weakly encrypted formats, effectively providing near-plaintext access to the strongly encrypted secrets.
3. **Incomplete Router Configuration**: Partial configuration of complex router features, such as RADIUS-based authentication without specifying a RADIUS server.
4. **Undefined Access Control Lists (ACLs)**: Assigning an undefined ACL to an interface, leaving it unprotected.
5. **Unused ACLs**: Defined but unused ACLs, often due to typographical errors, leading to inadequate protection.
6. **Superfluous Rules**: ACLs containing unnecessary or "dead" rules, indicating a lack of understanding of the configured properties.
7. **Inadequate Interface Security**: Ingress/egress interfaces failing to meet user-defined minimum relaying (whitelist) and filtering (blacklist) requirements.
8. **Interface Restrictions**: Line interfaces not adhering to user-defined blacklist and whitelist restrictions.
9. **High Logging Thresholds**: Setting excessively high reporting thresholds for logging, thereby excluding critical ACL events that should be logged.

**Note**: Most of these issues require an evaluation of the combined effects of multiple configuration clauses. This type of analysis cannot be achieved by simple pattern matching at the syntax level but requires a comprehensive assessment of the configuration's semantics.

### CROCODILE Demonstration and Features

**Figure 2** illustrates the evaluation profile of a demonstration run. For more details about the configuration under test and its evaluation results, visit the CROCODILE homepage at [www.iese.fraunhofer.de/crocodile](http://www.iese.fraunhofer.de/crocodile).

#### Differential Display Mode
CROCODILE offers a differential display mode, which highlights changes relative to an earlier configuration. Irrelevant findings are faded out, making it easier to focus on significant changes. This feature is particularly useful when users do not address all findings, leaving some settings unchanged for reasons not visible in the configuration file.

#### Available Checker Modules

1. **CompoundPatterns**: 
   - **Functionality**: Supports user-defined evaluation criteria for the existence or absence of specific IOS configuration clauses.
   - **Features**: Users can specify arbitrary syntax patterns and assign severity levels to their occurrence or omission. CROCODILE generates messages (OKAY, INFO, CHECK, WARN, ALERT) based on these criteria.
   - **Example**: Ensuring that all interfaces, except 'Loopback' or 'Null', are either disabled or have the Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) disabled.

2. **Connectivity**:
   - **Functionality**: Extracts and reports topology information of the routerâ€™s network neighborhood.
   - **Focus**: While it checks for irregularities and potential weaknesses, its primary purpose is to provide topology data for further processing or manual inspection.

3. **IngressEgress**:
   - **Functionality**: Verifies that the configuration of ACLs, line interfaces, and network interfaces conforms to the desired behavior.
   - **User Input**: Users can specify blacklists and whitelists, and the module will list any violations found.

4. **AAA (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting)**:
   - **Functionality**: Checks the consistency, completeness, and security of authentication and authorization settings.
   - **Features**: Evaluates the use of insecure features, compatibility with AAA, and the security of passwords and external authentication server accesses.

5. **Logging**:
   - **Functionality**: Validates the activation level of logging modes, remote logging servers, and configured attributes.
   - **Features**: Ensures the consistency of all logging settings.

6. **Passwords**:
   - **Functionality**: Checks and lists the general and level-specific activation of passwords, identifies trivial or weakly encrypted passwords, and detects reuse of strongly encrypted passwords in weakly encrypted formats.

7. **SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)**:
   - **Functionality**: Checks for full use of available security features, easily guessed community strings, and protection by ACLs and SNMP view restrictions.

8. **NTP (Network Time Protocol)**:
   - **Functionality**: Evaluates NTP access control lists, checks authentication keys, and performs cross-checks between configured NTP commands and security settings.

9. **RATemulation**:
   - **Functionality**: Emulates the Router Audit Tool (RAT), providing detailed security checks.

### Access Control List Analysis

CROCODILE uniquely represents and processes ACLs and their associated blacklists and whitelists. It computes these sets independently of the specific ordering or format of ACL and routing clauses, and uses them for consistency and security checks:

- **Dependent Rules**: Identifies ACL rules whose packet domain intersects with earlier rules, indicating the need for reconsideration when removing or reordering clauses.
- **Dead Rules**: Flags rules that could be removed without any effect, along with the set of earlier rules that "killed" them.
- **Verification**: The IngressEgress module verifies that the given ACL achieves the desired relaying and filtering effect.
- **Interactive Utility**: The 'blackwhite.pl' utility allows interactive narrowing of the scope of set computations, making it easier to comprehend and verify complex ACLs.

### Related Work

Few tools are available for router security checking, with notable ones being RAT (Router Audit Tool) and a lesser-known tool by Equant Communications. Some firewall analysis tools also offer comparable functionality in packet filtering behavior.

#### RAT (Router Audit Tool)
- **Version 2.0**: Developed by several partners, including the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA).
- **Functionality**: Provides comprehensive security checks for routers, similar to CROCODILE's capabilities.
