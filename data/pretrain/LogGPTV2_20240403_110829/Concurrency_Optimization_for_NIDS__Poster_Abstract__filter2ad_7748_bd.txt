Evaluation of inhibitory effect of grapefruit juice on intestinal CYP3A activity
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Yujin Lee, Seoul National University, South Korea
CO-AUTHORS: Soyoung Lee, Andrew HyoungJin Kim, Joo-Youn Cho
The cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A enzyme is major phase I drug metabolizing enzyme which accounts for 40% and 80% of total CYP in the liver and 
intestine, respectively Among the factors affecting CYP3A activity, grapefruit juice is known to inhibit intestinal CYP3A activities which may lead 
to undesired drug interaction We aimed to evaluate the intestinal CYP3A inhibitory effect by grapefruit juice using midazolam and endogenous 
metabolic markers Fifteen Korean healthy male subjects completed the study Subjects received oral and intravenous midazolam as probe drug 
CYP3A activity was evaluated using midazolam clearance and endogenous metabolic markers To inhibit intestinal and total (both hepatic and 
intestinal) CYP3A activities, grapefruit juice and clarithromycin were used, respectively Urinary and plasma steroids were quantified by using GC-
MS and the concentration of midazolam and its metabolites were quantified using LC-MS In total CYP3A inhibition phase, urinary markers, 6β-OH-
cortisone/cortisone and 6β-OH-cortisol/cortisol, and the concentration of plasma marker, 4β-OH-cholesterol, decreased 04, 05 and 03-fold, 
respectively Midazolam clearance was also significantly decreased 03-fold compared to that of control However, in intestinal CYP3A inhibition 
phase, both midazolam clearance and endogenous metabolic markers were not significantly decreased except for 6β-OH-cortisone/cortisone 
ratio was significantly decreased 06-fold compared to that of control In conclusion, the inhibitory effect of clarithromycin on CYP3A activity was 
significant However, the inhibitory effect of grapefruit juice was negligible Therefore, we speculate that there will be no significant interaction 
between grapefruit juice and CYP3A substrate drugs

Major depressive disorder is a heterogeneous disorder with a wide spectrum of symptoms leading to disability, suicide and physical disorders 
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are ones of the most commonly used drugs of treatment of depression For unknown reasons, a 
great number of patients do not show any improvement during drug treatment (30-40%) The underlying molecular mechanisms of depression 
remain unknown To improve knowledge of pathophysiology and to search biomarkers to help prognostic of antidepressant treatment response 
in patient, we employed a LC-HRMS metabolomics approach in a BALB/c induced mouse model of depression to investigate metabolic changes 
in 6 specific brain regions, after 5 weeks with a fluoxetine treatment From 770 cumulated targeted metabolites, 68 discriminant Variable 
Importance in Projection (VIP) were shown to discriminate vehicle-treated group from drug responder and non-responder mice, after OPLS-DA 
This central metabolomics approach is completed by a peripheral analysis through plasma analysis A less robust OPS-DA model was obtained, 
but 27 discriminant metabolites (over 197 robustly analyzed) were altered in plasma Comparison of central VIP with peripheral VIP leads to 7 
common metabolites This study shows the complementary of these two compartments, ie cerebral and plasma metabolome From this, specific 
brain regions shown particular metabolism which could explain some aspects of the depressive pathophysiology and some biomarkers could be 
proposed to anticipate antidepressant treatment response

Differences in metabolic profiles of venous and arterial umbilical cord blood
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Olle Hartvigsson, Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden
CO-AUTHORS: Alastair Ross, Carl Brunius, Malin Barman, Ann-Sofie Sandberg
Analysing umbilical cord blood is important for assessing neonatal health and development The easiest and most common collection procedure 
is to squeeze blood out of the cord after it is severed Hence a mixture of venous (from mother to child) and arterial (from child to mother) blood is 
collected This study aimed to determine key differences in metabolite profiles between venous and arterial cord blood plasma The metabolome of 
venous, arterial and mixed squeezed umbilical cord blood was analysed from 52 children using a combination of targeted and untargeted GC-MS/
MS Data was analysed by multilevel Random Forest (ML-RF) in a repeated double cross validation framework incorporated with unbiased variable 
selection In pairwise analysis of arterial and venous blood, approximately 75% of samples were correctly classified (p=00078) Arterial blood had 
higher concentrations of glucose, sorbose and galactose than venous blood which contained higher levels of α-ketoglutaric acid, L-glutamic acid, 
homocysteine and several other metabolites Mixed blood had a metabolic profile that was in-between the arterial and venous blood, but could 
not be classified properly by multivariate models Our results highlight that cord blood sampling with non-systematic mixing of arterial and venous 
blood induces undesirable variability in metabolomics analyses We therefore conclude that control of the sampling procedure is imperative during 
metabolomics analyses, especially when energy or amino acid metabolism are relevant for the research question

Comparison of plasma metabolic profiling in allergic rhinitis and asthma by 1H NMR in early childhood
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Meng-Han Chiang, Research Fellow, Taiwan
CO-AUTHORS: Chih-Yung Chiu, Gigin Lin
Allergic rhinitis and asthma are both chronic heterogeneous disorders with the high prevalence of coexistence Clinically, house dust mite 
sensitization with elevated serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels is a significant factor in relation to both allergic rhinitis and asthma However, few 
studies have addressed the potential molecular mechanisms between allergic rhinitis and asthma, especially in children Metabolomics provides 
a complementary functional approach to the molecular functions interacted with the host, offering the opportunity to characterize diseases 
effectively The aim of this study was to investigate plasma metabolic profiling in children with allergic rhinitis and asthma Plasma samples were 
collected and metabolites were analyzed by 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) NMR spectra were processed by an open source 
software NMRProcFlow and subsequently analyzed by MetaboAnalyst In this study, a total of 111 children with mean age of 49 ± 05 years were 
enrolled Among them, there were 27 asthmatics, 44 allergic rhinitis, and 40 healthy controls After analysis, total 104 buckets refer to 50 known 
metabolites were identified by Chenomx software Compared to healthy controls, six and five metabolites were significantly different in children 
with allergic rhinitis and asthma respectively Among them, allergic rhinitis associated hypoxanthine, glutamate, and phenylalanine were positively 
changed with mite-allergen specific IgE levels, whereas asthma associated glutamine and arabinose were inversely changed in opposing directions 
Clinically, a comprehensive analysis of functions studies related to these 8 metabolites could potentially provide further prevention and treatment in 
children with allergic rhinitis and asthma

Endometrial Receptivity in Women with Dormant Genital Tuberculosis: A Molecular and Metabolomic Approach
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Koel Chaudhury, School of Medical Science and Technology, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, India
CO-AUTHORS: Elavarasan Subramani, Baidyanath Chakravarty
Genital tuberculosis (GTB) in women is one of the common causes of infertility in emerging countries The important problem in diagnosing and treating 
GTB is that it often exists in a dormant form without any clinical symptoms There is a general consensus that GTB affects implantation due to ovarian 
and endometrial involvement Behavior of the endometrium during the window of implantation in asymptomatic infertile women having dormant 
GTB is not well understood The possible molecular association between dormant GTB and endometrial receptivity is, therefore, explored Reduced 
levels of endometrial receptivity markers suggest impairment in the receptive status of the endometrium in dormant GTB women Also, alterations 
in endometrial thickness, blood flow parameters and vascular endothelial growth factor indicate poor angiogenesis during implantation window 
Compromised LIF-STAT3 signaling pathway could possibly be responsible for repeated implantation failure Metabolomic studies indicate a clear 
metabolic differentiation in the metabolic profile of endometrium and serum between women with dormant GTB and controls The significantly altered 
endometrial tissue and serum metabolites could be largely related to energy metabolism and amino acid biosynthesis This underlines the metabolic 
influence of tubercle infection, even in its dormant form Expression of several serum metabolites followed a similar pattern as that observed in the 
endometrium of dormant GTB women The potential of these metabolites as putative diagnostic markers of dormant GTB seems promising

Selection for prolificacy and lean growth in swine has been associated with a substantial increase in piglet mortality The first 24-48 hours after birth 
represent the most critical period A major determinant for early survival is piglet maturity at birth, which strongly relies on the process of maturation 
during the last month of gestation The objective of the current study was to compare progeny from Large White and Meishan pigs, which differ for 
piglet survival and vitality, to describe the metabolic status of the piglets Thirty-nine sows were anesthetized at 90 or 110 days after conception 
(average gestation term: 114 days) Their fetuses (on average 157 per sow) were quickly obtained by caesarean section and this study focuses on 
the plasmatic, the urinary and the amniotic liquid metabolomes (1H-NMR) of 507 to 604 fetuses Raw 1D Bruker spectral data files were treated with 
ASICS, an R package available on Bioconductor ASICS allowed the direct identification and quantification of about 90 metabolites from a library 
of 190 metabolites, with about 60 metabolites per fluid, among which 39 were in common in the three fluids A multivariate analysis and a mixed 
model were applied to the quantification results to explain the differences between the gestational stages and the breeds The results provide new 
insights in the biological pathways involved in piglet maturation Grants: ANR ANR-09-GENM005 (PORCINET) and ANR-16-CONV-0004 (#DigitAg),

Neonatal hair profiling of monochorionic twins can be implicated to reflect a longitudinal metabolic phenotype of 
compromised fetal growth rate and abnormal umbilical artery flow
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Ting-Li Han, First affiliated Hopstial of Chonqing Medical University, China
CO-AUTHORS: Jing Yang, Yuan Wei, Yang Yang, Zhang Hua, Yangyu Zhao
Selective intrauterine fetal growth restriction (sIUGR) in monochronic diamniotic twins, especially types 2&3 with abnormal umbilical artery 
Doppler, results in increased risks of fetal/perinatal mortality and postnatal disability Hair metabolome profiles of neonates were characterized 
to reflect the long-term pathophysiological changes across different clinical forms of sIUGR twins Hair samples were collected at delivery from 
10 pairs of type 1 sIUGR twins, 8 pairs of types 2&3 sIUGR twins, and 11 pairs of uncomplicated twins The hair metabolome was characterized by 
gas chromatography-mass spectrometry PLS-DA analysis and ROC curves were applied to screen for metabolites between/within twin pairs in 
different sIUGR and uncomplicated twin subgroups A generalized estimating equation (GEE) model was implemented to correlate hair metabolites 
to birthweight and fetal growth rate within/between sIUGR co-twins Metabolic pathway analysis and metabolic network reconstructions were 
performed using the KEGG database Our results demonstrated that the hair metabolite profiles of different sIUGR subclinical forms were associated 
with the averaged fetal growth rate after 28 weeks of gestation but not birthweight The hair profiles were capable of discriminating type2&3 sIUGR 
twins from uncomplicated twins In particular, the metabolites 2-aminobutyric acid, cysteine, alanine, proline, valine, and tyrosine areas under 
the ROC curve were above 09 The metabolic pathway analysis highlighted the associations of sIUGR twins with abnormal umbilical artery flow 
including nutrient depletion pathway, glutathione metabolism, and attenuated nerve development This study offers novel insight into evaluating the 
severity of intrauterine ischemia and hypoxia for T2&3 sIUGR twins, through the neonatal hair metabolome

Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) the one of the major causes of neurodevelopmental impairment in the pediatric age Therapeutic 
hypothermia (TH) initiated within 6 h of birth is now established as the standard of care for infants with moderate and severe HIE TH has 
significantly reduced mortality and improved neurological outcome in survivors However, no objective bedside test is available for an accurate 
and early diagnosis of HIE This study elucidates early metabolic changes in newborns with HIE in order to select potential disease specific target 
biomarkers capable of predicting long-term adverse outcomes We analyzed changes in the plasma metabolome employing gas-chromatography-
mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography-time-of-flight MS (LC-TOFMS) in a cohort of 55 asphyxiated infants who evolved to 
moderate/severe HIE Hypoxia-ischemia induced brain injury was assessed employing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) between days 4 and 8 
post-partum This study describes for the first time the evolution of the plasma metabolome of newborn infants with HIE covering the time period 
between birth and completion of TH Results obtained allowed a critical assessment of the usefulness of lactate, pyruvate, and pyruvate/lactate for 
early outcome prediction Besides, metabolomic profiling identified a dynamic perturbation of eleven metabolic pathways, including amino acid 
and purine metabolism, and the steroid hormone biosynthesis, in newborns with pathologic MRI outcomes Future work will focus on the specific 
study of the steroid hormone biosynthesis pathway, which remained altered during the whole study period, to explore its potentials for biomarker 
discovery or adjuvant therapies to be combined with TH

Evaluation of Lipid Profile Differences between Neonatal and Adult Serum
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Richard Beger, NCTR, United States
CO-AUTHORS: Mustafa Akkoyunlu, Jiyeon Yang, Jinchun Sun
Introduction: While lipid profiles in terms of lipid classes including total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and low-
density lipoprotein cholesterol have been measured in newborn infants, little work has been conducted to show the lipid levels as lipid species in 
neonatal serum Methods: Adult pooled sera (AS) were collected from 2 adult mice (8 to 12-week-old) for each replicate (n=5 replicates) Neonatal 
pooled sera (NS) were collected from 8-10 mice (1-week-old) for each replicate (n=5) An aliquot of 50 µL of the reconstituted sample was directly 
infused into a QTRAP 5500 MS with SelexION™ technology at a flow rate of 7 µL/min for targeted lipid profiling Results: Lipidomics analysis results 
showed that total lipid amount (13 classes of lipids including neutral and polar lipids) present in NS was lower vs AS or in HINS vs HIAS, which is 
consistent with previous studies on newborns Lipid classes of CE, DAG, LPC, LPE and TAG were significantly lower in NS vs AS; while lipid classes 
of PC, PE and SM were significantly higher in NS vs AS The top fatty acid chain lipids differentiated NS from AS were the most abundant TAGs 
including (FA 16:0), (FA 16:1), (FA 18:1) and (FA 18:2) Interestingly, NS and HINS serum had higher levels of all lipid classes containing arachidonic acid 
(signaling molecule and a key inflammatory intermediate) chain vs AS and HIAS Novel Aspects: Lipidomics analysis was conducted to evaluate the 
lipidome differences between neonatal and adult mouse sera at lipid species level

LC-MS Based Targeted and Untargeted Metabolomics for the Identification of Potential Biomarkers in Plasma From  
Pediatrics With Chronic Kidney Disease
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Sandra Benito, University of the Basque Country, Spain
CO-AUTHORS: Nora Unceta, Alicia Sánchez-Ortega, M. Aránzazu Goicolea, Ramón J. Barrio
The assessment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is carried out using glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which is calculated from serum creatinine 
concentration However, serum creatinine concentration changes according to several factors, thus endangering CKD diagnosis, especially in 
early stages of the disease In addition, pediatric CKD is related to malnutrition, development, metabolic and cardiovascular complications, leading 
to a 30 times higher mortality rate in paediatrics suffering from advanced CKD in comparison with their healthy counterparts Regarding that the 
discovery of new biomarkers might allow earlier diagnosis as well as a better response, comprehensive research has been performed in plasma 
samples from paediatrics with CKD Following targeted and untargeted metabolomics approaches 7 potential biomarkers have been found which 
could be useful for pediatric CKD by means of comparison of metabolic profiles: citrulline, S-adenosylmethionine, symmetric dimethylarginine, 
cis-4-decenoylcarnitine, n-butyrylcarnitine, bilirubin and sphingosine-1-phosphate The use of these metabolites in addition to creatinine enables 
better differentiation of paediatrics with CKD and control paediatrics in comparison with the use of creatinine alone Afterwards, these 7 biomarkers 
in addition to the classical biomarker creatinine have been gathered together into a routine analytical method Aimed at evaluating the usefulness 
of this routine analysis method, a CKD pediatric population have been analyzed as well as a healthy pediatric population, being able to differentiate 
between them by means of data analysis

Correlating plasma and liver metabolic profiles: an application to the study of organ maturation
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Oskar González, University of the Basque Country, Spain
CO-AUTHORS: Oihane E. Albóniga, Rosa M. Alonso, Yun Xu, Royston Goodacre
Liver plays a main role in drug metabolism, so studying the grade of maturation of this organ would help to develop more appropriate dosing 
regimens for paediatric population Nevertheless, considering the invasive nature of liver analyses there are obvious ethical boundaries In 
this work, we investigated the suitability of plasma as an alternative matrix to evaluate the biological age of liver With this aim, we studied the 
correlation of plasma and liver metabolomic profiles obtained by UHPLC-TOF-MS for piglets of different ages By means of Pearson correlation 
analysis we observed that 360 and 1784 pairs of features were significantly correlated in positive and negative ionization mode, respectively 
Procrustes transformation was applied in order to assess the similarity of the clustering resulting from the data obtained from the two matrices The 
dissimilarity values were low both for ESI+ (03753) and for ESI- (03673) and, hence, liver and plasma are expected to provide similar discriminatory 
information Furthermore, Multiblock Principal Component analysis demonstrated to be a very suitable tool to combine the data obtained from both 
matrices and to better understand the clustering according to three groups: newborns, neonates and infant piglets Considering all these results, 
plasma proved to be a matrix of great interest to provide insight into the maturation grade of liver This could lead to less invasive procedures to 
study drug metabolism and it could be an important step forward towards an accurate dosing in paediatric population

Basque Country, Spain
CO-AUTHORS: Oskar González, María E. Blanco, Rosa M. Alonso, Yun Xu, Royston Goodacre
Knowledge about drug metabolism in paediatric population is limited mainly due to ethical issues, scarce number of clinical trials and reduced 
sample size of the few paediatric studies available In consequence, drug administration in children is often based on algorithms from allometric 
models optimised for adults, without considering the maturation state of key organs, such as liver, which during childhood are still in their 
development process The invasiveness of liver sample collection requires the use of animal models, such as piglets, to study the paediatric 
population In this study, metabolomic profiles of liver tissue, obtained from 36 piglets of different ages, were analysed by an HPLC-Q-TOF-MS 
system in positive and negative electrospray ionization (ESI) modes The multivariate analysis by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed a 
perfect clustering of the three groups of piglets (newborns, neonates and infants) By univariate analysis, 91 features (m/z-tr) at ESI+ and 48 features 
at ESI- differentiating the three groups of piglets were found The HPLC-MS/MS analysis of these significant features and their comparison with 
Metlin, HMDB, mzCloud and MyCompoundID databases allowed the identification of 13 acylcarnitines, such as acetylcarnitine, butyryl-L-carnitine, 
2-methylbutyroyl-carnitine or palmitoyl-L-carnitine, among others, suggesting the involvement of the fatty acids metabolism in the liver maturation 
state These results provided an important contribution in paediatrics and demonstrated that metabolomics is a useful tool in this area

Metabolomic prediction of adverse pregnancy outcomes
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Nancy McBride, MRC IEU, United Kingdom
CO-AUTHORS: Paul Yousefi, Matthew Suderman, Caroline Relton, Deborah Lawlor 
Pregnancy-related disorders, such as gestational diabetes (GD), hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), small for gestational age (SGA), large 
for gestational age (LGA) and preterm birth (PTB), can have long-lasting adverse effects on maternal and offspring health and are a significant 
public health concern Current risk factors rely on clinical predictors such as smoking, age, parity and body mass index (BMI) However, these 
are poor predictors Metabolites may reflect dynamic changes in metabolic pathways of women with pregnancy-related disorders We aim to see 
whether we can use metabolomics to improve prediction of adverse pregnancy outcomes We used the Born in Bradford multi-ethnic cohort and 
the UK Pregnancies Better Eating and Activity Trial randomised control trial of obese pregnant women Both have nuclear magnetic resonance 
(NMR) metabolite data from pregnant women at 24-28 weeks gestation We used 159 NMR-derived metabolite measures and information on 
clinical predictors from 9,312 women to generate prediction models Penalised regression was used to create predictive models with an elastic net 
penalty for HDP, GD, SGA and LGA from 90% of the cohort Out-of-sample performance was conducted in a randomly allocated subset of 10% of 
observations that were withheld during training using receiver operating characteristic curves We found that a model combining the metabolites 
and existing clinical predictors had very good discrimination for GD (AUC 085), good for HDP (076) and SGA (073), poorer for LGA (AUC 069) We 
will now compare this to the predictive purpose of the mass spectrometry (MS) metabolite platform

Pre-symptomatic biomarker for preeclampsia in mid-trimester
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Yujin Kang, Kookmin University, South Korea
CO-AUTHORS: Seung Mi Lee, Joong Shin Park, Do Yup Lee
Preeclampsia (PE) is a hypertensive disease associated with pregnancy that has not yet been clearly elucidated The disorder can affect fetus and 
pregnant women, which in turn necessitates special care In particular, it may cause complications such as fetal growth retardation, premature birth, 
renal dysfunction, and chronic hypertension in pregnant women Sometimes, preeclampsia is very similar to symptoms of normal pregnancy such as 
weight gain, swelling and headache and some mothers have no symptoms at all Accordingly, it is very important to properly diagnose preeclampsia 
through periodic antenatal screening and early diagnosis In our current study, metabolic profiling of maternal plasma samples in mid-trimester 
was performed using gas chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF MS) and liquid chromatography orbitrap mass spectrometry 
(LC-Orbitrap MS) A total of 330 metabolites were semi-quantitatively identified Primarily, partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) 
demonstrated a clear discrimination between pregnant women with preeclampsia and healthy controls Subsequent binary logistic regression 
analysis constructed a potential biomarker recomposite with 3 metabolites The predictive model successfully discriminated preeclampsia group in 
the mid-trimester (AUC = 0801)
