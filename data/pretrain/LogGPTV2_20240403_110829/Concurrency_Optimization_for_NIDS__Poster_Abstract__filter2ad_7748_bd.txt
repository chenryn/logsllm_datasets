**Presenting Author:** Yujin Lee, Seoul National University, South Korea  
**Co-Authors:** Soyoung Lee, Andrew HyoungJin Kim, Joo-Youn Cho

**Abstract:**
Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A enzymes are major phase I drug-metabolizing enzymes, accounting for 40% and 80% of total CYP in the liver and intestine, respectively. Among the factors affecting CYP3A activity, grapefruit juice is known to inhibit intestinal CYP3A activities, potentially leading to undesired drug interactions. This study aimed to evaluate the intestinal CYP3A inhibitory effect of grapefruit juice using midazolam and endogenous metabolic markers.

Fifteen healthy Korean male subjects completed the study. Participants received oral and intravenous midazolam as a probe drug. CYP3A activity was assessed using midazolam clearance and endogenous metabolic markers. To inhibit intestinal and total (both hepatic and intestinal) CYP3A activities, grapefruit juice and clarithromycin were used, respectively. Urinary and plasma steroids were quantified using GC-MS, and the concentrations of midazolam and its metabolites were quantified using LC-MS.

In the total CYP3A inhibition phase, urinary markers (6β-OH-cortisone/cortisone and 6β-OH-cortisol/cortisol) and the concentration of the plasma marker 4β-OH-cholesterol decreased by 0.4, 0.5, and 0.3-fold, respectively. Midazolam clearance was also significantly decreased by 0.3-fold compared to the control. However, in the intestinal CYP3A inhibition phase, both midazolam clearance and endogenous metabolic markers were not significantly decreased, except for the 6β-OH-cortisone/cortisone ratio, which decreased by 0.6-fold compared to the control.

In conclusion, clarithromycin significantly inhibited CYP3A activity, while the inhibitory effect of grapefruit juice was negligible. Therefore, we speculate that there will be no significant interaction between grapefruit juice and CYP3A substrate drugs.

**Central and Peripheral Metabolomics in a Model of Depression: Biosignatures of Drug Responder and Non-Responder Mice**

**Presenting Author:** Sylvie Mavel, University of Tours, France  
**Co-Authors:** Antoine Lefèvre, Marc Legrand, Laurent Galineau, Lydie Nadal-Desbarats, Catherine Belzung, Patrick Emond

**Abstract:**
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a heterogeneous condition with a wide spectrum of symptoms leading to disability, suicide, and physical disorders. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are among the most commonly used treatments for depression. However, a significant number of patients (30-40%) do not show improvement during SSRI treatment. The underlying molecular mechanisms of depression remain poorly understood. To improve our understanding of the pathophysiology and to identify biomarkers for predicting antidepressant response, we employed a LC-HRMS metabolomics approach in a BALB/c mouse model of depression. We investigated metabolic changes in six specific brain regions after five weeks of fluoxetine treatment.

From 770 targeted metabolites, 68 discriminant Variable Importance in Projection (VIP) were identified, distinguishing vehicle-treated groups from drug responders and non-responders using OPLS-DA. This central metabolomics approach was complemented by peripheral analysis through plasma metabolomics, which yielded a less robust OPLS-DA model but identified 27 discriminant metabolites out of 197 analyzed. Comparison of central and peripheral VIPs revealed seven common metabolites, highlighting the complementary nature of these two compartments.

This study demonstrates the potential of metabolomics to elucidate specific brain region metabolism, which may explain aspects of depressive pathophysiology and provide biomarkers for predicting antidepressant response.

**Differences in Metabolic Profiles of Venous and Arterial Umbilical Cord Blood**

**Presenting Author:** Olle Hartvigsson, Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden  
**Co-Authors:** Alastair Ross, Carl Brunius, Malin Barman, Ann-Sofie Sandberg

**Abstract:**
Analyzing umbilical cord blood is crucial for assessing neonatal health and development. The most common collection method involves squeezing blood from the severed cord, resulting in a mixture of venous (from mother to child) and arterial (from child to mother) blood. This study aimed to determine key differences in metabolite profiles between venous and arterial cord blood plasma.

The metabolomes of venous, arterial, and mixed squeezed umbilical cord blood were analyzed from 52 children using a combination of targeted and untargeted GC-MS/MS. Data were analyzed using multilevel Random Forest (ML-RF) in a repeated double cross-validation framework with unbiased variable selection. Pairwise analysis of arterial and venous blood correctly classified approximately 75% of samples (p=0.0078). Arterial blood had higher concentrations of glucose, sorbose, and galactose, while venous blood contained higher levels of α-ketoglutaric acid, L-glutamic acid, homocysteine, and other metabolites. Mixed blood had a metabolic profile intermediate between arterial and venous blood but could not be classified properly by multivariate models.

These results highlight that non-systematic mixing of arterial and venous blood during sampling introduces undesirable variability in metabolomics analyses. Therefore, controlled sampling procedures are essential, especially when studying energy or amino acid metabolism.

**Comparison of Plasma Metabolic Profiling in Allergic Rhinitis and Asthma by 1H NMR in Early Childhood**

**Presenting Author:** Meng-Han Chiang, Research Fellow, Taiwan  
**Co-Authors:** Chih-Yung Chiu, Gigin Lin

**Abstract:**
Allergic rhinitis and asthma are chronic, heterogeneous disorders with a high prevalence of coexistence. House dust mite sensitization and elevated serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels are significant factors in both conditions. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these conditions, especially in children, remain poorly understood. Metabolomics offers a functional approach to characterize diseases by analyzing the host's molecular functions. This study aimed to investigate plasma metabolic profiling in children with allergic rhinitis and asthma.

Plasma samples from 111 children (mean age: 4.9 ± 0.5 years) were collected and analyzed by 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). NMR spectra were processed using NMRProcFlow and analyzed with MetaboAnalyst. A total of 50 known metabolites were identified. Compared to healthy controls, six and five metabolites were significantly different in children with allergic rhinitis and asthma, respectively. Allergic rhinitis-associated hypoxanthine, glutamate, and phenylalanine were positively correlated with mite-allergen-specific IgE levels, while asthma-associated glutamine and arabinose were inversely correlated.

Comprehensive analysis of these metabolites could provide insights into the prevention and treatment of allergic rhinitis and asthma in children.

**Endometrial Receptivity in Women with Dormant Genital Tuberculosis: A Molecular and Metabolomic Approach**

**Presenting Author:** Koel Chaudhury, School of Medical Science and Technology, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, India  
**Co-Authors:** Elavarasan Subramani, Baidyanath Chakravarty

**Abstract:**
Genital tuberculosis (GTB) is a common cause of infertility in women, particularly in emerging countries. GTB often exists in a dormant form without clinical symptoms, making diagnosis and treatment challenging. There is a consensus that GTB affects implantation due to ovarian and endometrial involvement. The behavior of the endometrium during the window of implantation in asymptomatic infertile women with dormant GTB is not well understood.

This study explored the molecular association between dormant GTB and endometrial receptivity. Reduced levels of endometrial receptivity markers suggest impaired endometrial receptivity in women with dormant GTB. Alterations in endometrial thickness, blood flow parameters, and vascular endothelial growth factor indicate poor angiogenesis during the implantation window. Compromised LIF-STAT3 signaling pathways may contribute to repeated implantation failure. Metabolomic studies revealed clear metabolic differentiation in the metabolic profiles of endometrium and serum between women with dormant GTB and controls. Significantly altered endometrial tissue and serum metabolites were related to energy metabolism and amino acid biosynthesis, highlighting the metabolic influence of tubercle infection even in its dormant form.

Expression of several serum metabolites followed a similar pattern as observed in the endometrium of women with dormant GTB, suggesting their potential as diagnostic markers.

**Study of Fetal Pig Maturity in Relation to Neonatal Survival Using a Multi-Fluids Metabolomic Approach**

**Presenting Author:** Laurence Liaubet, INRA-GenPhySE, France  
**Co-Authors:** Gaëlle Lefort, Nathalie Vialaneix, Hélène Quesnel, Marie-Christine Père, Yvon Billon, Laurianne Canario, Nathalie Iannuccelli, Cécile Canlet, Alain Paris, Rémi Servien, Laurence Liaubet

**Abstract:**
Selection for prolificacy and lean growth in swine has been associated with increased piglet mortality. The first 24-48 hours after birth are the most critical period, and piglet maturity at birth is a major determinant of early survival. This study aimed to compare progeny from Large White and Meishan pigs, which differ in piglet survival and vitality, to describe the metabolic status of the piglets.

Thirty-nine sows were anesthetized at 90 or 110 days after conception (average gestation term: 114 days). Their fetuses (on average 15.7 per sow) were obtained by caesarean section, and this study focused on the plasmatic, urinary, and amniotic liquid metabolomes (1H-NMR) of 507 to 604 fetuses. Raw 1D Bruker spectral data files were treated with ASICS, an R package available on Bioconductor. ASICS allowed the direct identification and quantification of about 90 metabolites from a library of 190 metabolites, with about 60 metabolites per fluid, including 39 in common across the three fluids.

Multivariate analysis and a mixed model were applied to the quantification results to explain differences between gestational stages and breeds. The results provide new insights into the biological pathways involved in piglet maturation. This study was supported by grants ANR ANR-09-GENM005 (PORCINET) and ANR-16-CONV-0004 (#DigitAg), and INRA (divisions GA, SA, MIA).

**Neonatal Hair Profiling of Monochorionic Twins Can Reflect Longitudinal Metabolic Phenotypes of Compromised Fetal Growth Rate and Abnormal Umbilical Artery Flow**

**Presenting Author:** Ting-Li Han, First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, China  
**Co-Authors:** Jing Yang, Yuan Wei, Yang Yang, Zhang Hua, Yangyu Zhao

**Abstract:**
Selective intrauterine fetal growth restriction (sIUGR) in monochorionic diamniotic twins, especially types 2&3 with abnormal umbilical artery Doppler, increases the risk of fetal/perinatal mortality and postnatal disability. This study characterized hair metabolome profiles of neonates to reflect long-term pathophysiological changes across different clinical forms of sIUGR twins.

Hair samples were collected at delivery from 10 pairs of type 1 sIUGR twins, 8 pairs of types 2&3 sIUGR twins, and 11 pairs of uncomplicated twins. The hair metabolome was characterized using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). PLS-DA analysis and ROC curves were used to screen for metabolites between/within twin pairs in different sIUGR and uncomplicated twin subgroups. A generalized estimating equation (GEE) model was implemented to correlate hair metabolites with birthweight and fetal growth rate within/between sIUGR co-twins. Metabolic pathway analysis and metabolic network reconstructions were performed using the KEGG database.

Results showed that hair metabolite profiles of different sIUGR subclinical forms were associated with the averaged fetal growth rate after 28 weeks of gestation but not birthweight. The hair profiles discriminated type 2&3 sIUGR twins from uncomplicated twins. Specifically, the metabolites 2-aminobutyric acid, cysteine, alanine, proline, valine, and tyrosine had areas under the ROC curve above 0.9. Metabolic pathway analysis highlighted associations of sIUGR twins with abnormal umbilical artery flow, including nutrient depletion, glutathione metabolism, and attenuated nerve development. This study provides novel insights into evaluating the severity of intrauterine ischemia and hypoxia in T2&3 sIUGR twins through neonatal hair metabolome.

**Early Phenotypic Alterations of Newborns Suffering from Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy with Pathologic Cerebral Magnetic Resonance Imaging**

**Presenting Author:** Julia Kuligowski, Health Research Institute La Fe, Spain  
**Co-Authors:** José David Piñeiro-Ramos, Antonio Núñez-Ramiro, Anna Parra-Llorca, Juan Martínez-Rodilla, Roberto Llorens, Ángel Sánchez-Illana, Guillermo Quintás, Máximo Vento

**Abstract:**
Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a major cause of neurodevelopmental impairment in pediatric populations. Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) initiated within 6 hours of birth is now the standard of care for infants with moderate and severe HIE, significantly reducing mortality and improving neurological outcomes. However, no objective bedside test is available for accurate and early diagnosis of HIE. This study elucidated early metabolic changes in newborns with HIE to identify potential disease-specific biomarkers for predicting long-term adverse outcomes.

We analyzed changes in the plasma metabolome using gas-chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography-time-of-flight MS (LC-TOFMS) in a cohort of 55 asphyxiated infants who developed moderate/severe HIE. Brain injury was assessed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) between days 4 and 8 post-partum. This study describes the evolution of the plasma metabolome of newborns with HIE from birth to the completion of TH. Results allowed a critical assessment of the usefulness of lactate, pyruvate, and the pyruvate/lactate ratio for early outcome prediction. Metabolomic profiling identified dynamic perturbations in eleven metabolic pathways, including amino acid and purine metabolism, and steroid hormone biosynthesis, in newborns with pathologic MRI outcomes.

Future work will focus on the specific study of the steroid hormone biosynthesis pathway, which remained altered throughout the study period, to explore its potential for biomarker discovery or adjuvant therapies to be combined with TH.

**Evaluation of Lipid Profile Differences Between Neonatal and Adult Serum**

**Presenting Author:** Richard Beger, NCTR, United States  
**Co-Authors:** Mustafa Akkoyunlu, Jiyeon Yang, Jinchun Sun

**Abstract:**
While lipid profiles in terms of lipid classes, including total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, have been measured in newborn infants, little work has been conducted to show the lipid levels as lipid species in neonatal serum. This study aimed to evaluate the lipid profiles in neonatal and adult serum.

Adult pooled sera (AS) were collected from 2 adult mice (8 to 12-week-old) for each replicate (n=5 replicates). Neonatal pooled sera (NS) were collected from 8-10 mice (1-week-old) for each replicate (n=5). An aliquot of 50 µL of the reconstituted sample was directly infused into a QTRAP 5500 MS with SelexION™ technology at a flow rate of 7 µL/min for targeted lipid profiling.

Lipidomics analysis results showed that the total lipid amount (13 classes of lipids, including neutral and polar lipids) present in NS was lower than in AS or HINS vs. HIAS, consistent with previous studies on newborns. Lipid classes of CE, DAG, LPC, LPE, and TAG were significantly lower in NS vs. AS, while PC, PE, and SM were significantly higher in NS vs. AS. The top fatty acid chain lipids differentiating NS from AS were the most abundant TAGs, including (FA 16:0), (FA 16:1), (FA 18:1), and (FA 18:2). Interestingly, NS and HINS serum had higher levels of all lipid classes containing arachidonic acid (a signaling molecule and key inflammatory intermediate) chain vs. AS and HIAS.

This study provides novel insights into the lipidome differences between neonatal and adult mouse sera at the lipid species level.

**LC-MS Based Targeted and Untargeted Metabolomics for the Identification of Potential Biomarkers in Plasma From Pediatrics With Chronic Kidney Disease**

**Presenting Author:** Sandra Benito, University of the Basque Country, Spain  
**Co-Authors:** Nora Unceta, Alicia Sánchez-Ortega, M. Aránzazu Goicolea, Ramón J. Barrio

**Abstract:**
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is assessed using glomerular filtration rate (GFR), calculated from serum creatinine concentration. However, serum creatinine concentration can vary due to several factors, leading to inaccurate CKD diagnosis, especially in early stages. Pediatric CKD is associated with malnutrition, developmental, metabolic, and cardiovascular complications, resulting in a 30 times higher mortality rate in advanced CKD compared to healthy counterparts. The discovery of new biomarkers could allow earlier diagnosis and better management.

This study performed comprehensive metabolomics in plasma samples from pediatric CKD patients using targeted and untargeted approaches. Seven potential biomarkers were identified: citrulline, S-adenosylmethionine, symmetric dimethylarginine, cis-4-decenoylcarnitine, n-butyrylcarnitine, bilirubin, and sphingosine-1-phosphate. These metabolites, in addition to creatinine, enabled better differentiation of pediatric CKD patients from controls compared to creatinine alone. These biomarkers were integrated into a routine analytical method, which was evaluated in a pediatric CKD population and a healthy pediatric population, successfully differentiating between them.

**Correlating Plasma and Liver Metabolic Profiles: An Application to the Study of Organ Maturation**

**Presenting Author:** Oskar González, University of the Basque Country, Spain  
**Co-Authors:** Oihane E. Albóniga, Rosa M. Alonso, Yun Xu, Royston Goodacre

**Abstract:**
The liver plays a crucial role in drug metabolism, and studying its maturation can help develop appropriate dosing regimens for pediatric populations. However, the invasive nature of liver analysis poses ethical challenges. This study investigated the suitability of plasma as an alternative matrix to evaluate the biological age of the liver.

We studied the correlation of plasma and liver metabolomic profiles obtained by UHPLC-TOF-MS in piglets of different ages. Pearson correlation analysis revealed that 360 and 1784 pairs of features were significantly correlated in positive and negative ionization modes, respectively. Procrustes transformation was applied to assess the similarity of clustering from the two matrices. The dissimilarity values were low for both ESI+ (0.3753) and ESI- (0.3673), indicating that liver and plasma provide similar discriminatory information. Multiblock Principal Component Analysis (PCA) demonstrated that combining data from both matrices improved the understanding of clustering according to three groups: newborns, neonates, and infant piglets.

These results suggest that plasma is a valuable matrix for providing insight into liver maturation, leading to less invasive procedures for studying drug metabolism and more accurate dosing in pediatric populations.

**LC-MS Based Metabolomics: Biomarkers of Organ Maturation in Pediatrics**

**Presenting Author:** Oihane Elena Albóniga, Analytical Chemistry Department, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of the Basque Country, Spain  
**Co-Authors:** Oskar González, María E. Blanco, Rosa M. Alonso, Yun Xu, Royston Goodacre

**Abstract:**
Knowledge about drug metabolism in pediatric populations is limited due to ethical issues, scarce clinical trials, and small sample sizes. Consequently, drug administration in children is often based on algorithms from allometric models optimized for adults, without considering the maturation state of key organs like the liver. The invasiveness of liver sample collection necessitates the use of animal models, such as piglets, to study the pediatric population.

In this study, metabolomic profiles of liver tissue from 36 piglets of different ages were analyzed using an HPLC-Q-TOF-MS system in positive and negative electrospray ionization (ESI) modes. PCA showed perfect clustering of the three groups of piglets (newborns, neonates, and infants). Univariate analysis identified 91 features (m/z-tr) at ESI+ and 48 features at ESI- differentiating the three groups. HPLC-MS/MS analysis and comparison with Metlin, HMDB, mzCloud, and MyCompoundID databases allowed the identification of 13 acylcarnitines, such as acetylcarnitine, butyryl-L-carnitine, 2-methylbutyroyl-carnitine, and palmitoyl-L-carnitine, suggesting the involvement of fatty acid metabolism in liver maturation.

These results provide important contributions to pediatrics and demonstrate that metabolomics is a useful tool in this area.

**Metabolomic Prediction of Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes**

**Presenting Author:** Nancy McBride, MRC IEU, United Kingdom  
**Co-Authors:** Paul Yousefi, Matthew Suderman, Caroline Relton, Deborah Lawlor

**Abstract:**
Pregnancy-related disorders, such as gestational diabetes (GD), hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), small for gestational age (SGA), large for gestational age (LGA), and preterm birth (PTB), can have long-lasting adverse effects on maternal and offspring health. Current risk factors, such as smoking, age, parity, and body mass index (BMI), are poor predictors. Metabolites may reflect dynamic changes in metabolic pathways in women with pregnancy-related disorders.

We aimed to use metabolomics to improve the prediction of adverse pregnancy outcomes. We used the Born in Bradford multi-ethnic cohort and the UK Pregnancies Better Eating and Activity Trial (UPBEAT) randomized control trial of obese pregnant women. Both cohorts have nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolite data from pregnant women at 24-28 weeks gestation. We used 159 NMR-derived metabolite measures and information on clinical predictors from 9,312 women to generate prediction models. Penalized regression with an elastic net penalty was used to create predictive models for HDP, GD, SGA, and LGA from 90% of the cohort. Out-of-sample performance was evaluated in a randomly allocated subset of 10% of observations withheld during training using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.

The combined model of metabolites and existing clinical predictors had very good discrimination for GD (AUC 0.85), good for HDP (AUC 0.76) and SGA (AUC 0.73), and poorer for LGA (AUC 0.69). We will now compare this to the predictive performance of the mass spectrometry (MS) metabolite platform.

**Pre-symptomatic Biomarker for Preeclampsia in Mid-Trimester**

**Presenting Author:** Yujin Kang, Kookmin University, South Korea  
**Co-Authors:** Seung Mi Lee, Joong Shin Park, Do Yup Lee

**Abstract:**
Preeclampsia (PE) is a hypertensive disorder associated with pregnancy that remains poorly understood. It can affect both the fetus and the pregnant woman, leading to complications such as fetal growth retardation, premature birth, renal dysfunction, and chronic hypertension. Preeclampsia symptoms can be similar to those of normal pregnancy, making early and accurate diagnosis crucial.

In this study, we performed metabolic profiling of maternal plasma samples in the mid-trimester using gas chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF MS) and liquid chromatography orbitrap mass spectrometry (LC-Orbitrap MS). A total of 330 metabolites were semi-quantitatively identified. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) demonstrated a clear discrimination between pregnant women with preeclampsia and healthy controls. Subsequent binary logistic regression analysis constructed a potential biomarker composite with three metabolites. The predictive model successfully discriminated the preeclampsia group in the mid-trimester (AUC = 0.801).

This study provides a promising approach for the early detection of preeclampsia, which could lead to better management and outcomes for affected women and their fetuses.
