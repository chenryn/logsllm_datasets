Question: Which of the following statements accurately reflect the security mechanisms in place for Mac computers regarding Direct Memory Access (DMA) protections and the operation of kernel extensions (kexts)?
"A": "On a Mac with Apple silicon, the IOMMU allows peripherals to access all memory regions indiscriminately to ensure maximum compatibility and performance.",
"B": "For an Intel-based Mac, the IOMMU operates on a default-allow policy until the operating system initializes it to block unauthorized DMA requests.",
"C": "Starting with macOS 11, third-party kernel extensions must be included in the Auxiliary Kernel Collection at boot and cannot be loaded on demand to enhance system security.",
"D": "Kernel extensions for a Mac with Apple silicon can be enabled in One True Recovery mode, requiring a downgrade to Reduced Security and an administrator password to authorize."
Answer: CD
