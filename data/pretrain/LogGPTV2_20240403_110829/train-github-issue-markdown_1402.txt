After #14531 we are running the CI infrastructiure of ours using `r5a.2xlarge`
machines. They are needed for tests (thanks to having 8xCPUs and 64 GB RAM we
can run full suite of tests in 15 minutes instead of 1h by running the tests
in parallel. Likely (due to ~ 2x less cost of running tests (2x more price/ 4x
less time) we are saving money. We also achieve 30%-40% speedups on Pylint,
Static Checks (thanks to 8 CPUS available).
However not all jobs can use the memory/parallelism and we can use much
cheaper machines without impacting CI execution time:
  * Docs (not yet but possible)
  * K8S tests (not yet but possible)
  * Building Images
  * Providers building and testing
  * Image verification
  * Image waiting (this one is particularly wasteful)
By introducing a smaller type of machines and assigning the "big" machine type
only to the jobs that can utilise higher we can drive the cost down
significantly.
Small machine = r5a.large with 2 CPUs and 16GB memory should likely be enough
Spot Price in Frankfurt:
r5.2xlarge = $0.1549 per Hour  
r5a.large = $0.0365 per Hour
This means that for non-test jobs we can have further 4 x smaller cost if we
do it.
