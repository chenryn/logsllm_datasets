I'm trying to build Windows Terminal from command line using VS 2017 on
Windows 10 x64 insider, build 18362.86. I kept getting the error below even
after installing all the VS 2017 components that have something to do with C++
and .Net. From the error message it seems the build surprisingly involves VS
2019 (which I have installed as well). My expectation is VS 2019 should not be
involved as I use VS 2017 command line. I then decided to install all the
components that have something to do with C++ and .Net for VS 2019. I still
get the same error message.
My steps for building:
  1. Clone the repo from github
  2. Do `git submodule update --init --recursive`
  3. Do `.\tools\razzle.cmd`
  4. Do `bcz`
What am I missing? The error message is as below:  
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual
Studio\2019\Community\MSBuild\Microsoft\VC\v150\Microsoft.CppCommon.targets(2128,3):
error MSB4019: The imported project "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual
Studio\2019\Community\MSBuild\Microsoft\WindowsXaml\v15.0\Microsoft.Windows.UI.Xaml.Cpp.targets"
was not found. Confirm that the path in the  declaration is correct,
and that the file exists on disk.
