When I run a command
    >"node_modules/.bin/ngc" -p ./
I get the error:
> Error: Error encountered resolving symbol values statically. Function calls

That all is related to this piece of code
    @NgModule({
        ...
        providers: [
            COMPILER_PROVIDERS
        ],  
    })
    export class AppModule {}
Once COMPILER_PROVIDERS are not declared
        providers: [
            // COMPILER_PROVIDERS
then **AOT works** as expected... just ... **as also expected, the app is
not** working _(simply, COMPILER_PROVIDERS are needed for it)_
I did see this "encouraging disclaimer"
    /**
     * @module
     * @description
     * Entry point for all APIs of the compiler package.
     *
     * 
     *   Unstable APIs
     *   
     *     All compiler apis are currently considered experimental and private!
     *   
     *   
     *     We expect the APIs in this package to keep on changing. Do not rely on them.
     *   
     * 
So - it is **experimental** , **private** , **"I cannot rely on it"** ... but
I need it.
Please, am I doing something wrong? or is intended ... **COMPILER_PROVIDERS
will never be supported by AOT**?
