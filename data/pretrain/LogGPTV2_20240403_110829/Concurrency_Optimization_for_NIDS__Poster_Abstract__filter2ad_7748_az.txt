Profiling the effect of Adult Onset Hypothyroidism (AOH) on the mouse heart in both sexes integrating untargeted  
GC- and LC-MS metabolomics
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Maria-Konstantina Ioannidi, Metabolic Engineering & Systems Biology Lab, Institute of Chemical Engineering Sciences, 
FORTH, Greece
CO-AUTHORS: Marigoula Margarity, Maria I. Klapa
Background: The present study is part of a multi-tissue investigation (brain, heart, liver) of the effect of Adult-Onset-Hypothyroidism (AOH) on the 
metabolic physiology of a chemical induction mouse model, intending to comparatively reconstruct the metabolic fingerprint of this pathophysiology 
at the organism level in both sexes Here, we present the heart metabolic profiling, integrating gas and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry 
(GC-/LC-MS)-based metabolomics with systems and network biology approaches Methods: Tissue collection of 24 mice (male/female in sets of 
six euthyroid/hypothyroid) was performed on the 124th postnatal day, after applying an optimized tissue perfusion protocol with saline solution 
An adapted to mouse heart metabolite extraction protocol was performed Standardized data deposition and analysis was conducted using our 
software suite, M-IOLITE, and multivariate statistics tools The differential metabolites were visualized within the mouse heart primary metabolism 
network that we have reconstructed from literature and our data Results and Discussion: Indeed, the integration of GC-MS with LC-MS metabolomic 
analyses provided a broader overview of the mouse heart central carbon metabolism under AOH Our results validated a lipid-centric metabolism 
for the heart, which becomes de-regulated under AOH characterized by decreased energy metabolism and TCA cycle activity No extended inter-
sex differences were observed, with the female exhibiting greater metabolic AOH insulation through an increased lipid oxidation activity These 
results will be presented in comparison with the already acquired brain region metabolic profiles of the same animals towards a multi-tissue AOH 
metabolic physiology model Acknowledgments: The work was supported by BITAD_MIS_5002469, ELIXIR-GR_MIS 5002780, EATRIS-GR_MIS

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an important disease due to its association with a broad range of disorders We aimed to identify 
metabolome biomarkers for NAFLD using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and develop a diagnostic model for disease prediction 
Methods: We enrolled 3,733 visitors of St Luke International Hospital, Center for Preventive Medicine (Tokyo, Japan) between October 2015 and 
September 2016 who applied exclusion criteria for NAFLD diagnosis, eg daily alcohol intake (Men≥30g, Women≥20g), concurrent liver disease or 
malignancy, medication for metabolic diseases Fatty liver was diagnosed by ultrasonography Metabolome analysis was performed on blood serum 
samples using the GCMS-TQ8040 (Shimadzu, Japan) Results: The mean age of the participants was 518 years, and 826 (221%) were diagnosed 
with NAFLD Compared to the non-NAFLD group, 570% of the metabolites (65/114 investigated metabolites) were significantly increased in the 
NAFLD population The metabolite that demonstrated the strongest association was glutamic acid (P = 64 x 10-89 and AUC = 0759), followed 
by 2-oxoglutaric acid and valine These metabolites were significantly associated with NAFLD even after adjustment for sex, age, and BMI using 
logistic regression Finally, using LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator), we constructed a diagnostic model including multiple 
metabolites (n=70), which achieved an AUC of 0870 Discussion and Conclusions: We identified metabolites associated with NAFLD which were 
observed to be independent of obesity A high-performance diagnostic model for NAFLD through integration of metabolomics analysis and machine 
learning was developed which may have potential for clinical application in the future

Curcumin alleviates palmitate-induced inflammation and glycerolipid accumulation in C2C12 skeletal muscle cells
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Dean Ashley, University of Cambridge, United Kingdom
CO-AUTHORS: McNally BD, Murfitt S, Middleton A, Sassano G, Russell P, Aleksic M, Griffin J
Increased plasma concentrations of palmitate in obese individuals is suggested to enhance inflammation, lipotoxicity and insulin resistance in 
peripheral tissues, including skeletal muscle Upon treatment with palmitate expression of the inflammatory cytokines Il6 and Tnfα were increased 
as measured by rtPCR, while co-treatment with curcumin ameliorated these increases Published studies have shown that curcumin can increase 
AMPK activity in skeletal muscle of mice fed a high-fat diet, ameliorating inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin resistance However, 
the mechanism underpinning these changes has not been fully elucidated As AMPK is an important regulator of lipid metabolism, we applied mass 
spectrometry to assess curcumin-induced alterations in the lipid profile of C2C12 myotubes exposed to 750 µM palmitate Lipids were extracted 
using a modified Bligh and Dyer method, and lipid changes were assessed using open profiling C18-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry 
Treatment with palmitate raised concentrations of triacylglycerides (TAGs), diacylglycerides (DAGs), ceramides and phosphatidylcholine species 
The elevated levels of TAGs and DAGs were reduced with curcumin co-treatment, while concentrations of other lipid species were unaffected 
These results suggest the reduced inflammation and insulin resistance exerted by curcumin is driven by increased catabolism of DAGs and TAGs by 
alleviating the palmitate induced DAG activation of protein kinase C, JNK and IKK pathways

Metabolomics involves the (semi-)quantitative and qualitative measurement of metabolites in biological matrices and is used as an analytical tool 
for biomarker discovery in research but have not frequently been applied to diagnostics Inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) are routinely identified 
by targeted analysis of intermediary metabolites Recent developments in high-resolution mass spectrometry, tracer-based metabolomics and ion 
mobility techniques, opens new avenues to perform (untargeted) metabolomics for the identification of new biomarkers in IEM In our study, we 
investigated the metabolome profiles from a set of 120 plasma samples from patients with 10 known inborn errors of peroxisomal metabolism We 
used reversed-phase, normal-phase, and HILIC chromatography followed by full-scan orbitrap-MS on the Q Exactive plus in positive and negative 
ionization mode and annotated over 200 polar metabolites and over a 1200 lipid species We identified specific biomarkers for the different inborn 
errors of peroxisomal metabolism and discovered new potential biomarkers Because this is a semi-targeted approach, identities of some of the 
newly found biomarkers remain to be characterized Furthermore, we performed stable isotope tracer experiments on three classical and three 
variant (no illness at diagnosis by newborn screening, erythrocyte galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase activity 4-9%) galactosemia patients and 
were able to distinguish mild from severe patient (the galactosemia index), which ultimately could lead to personalized treatment of these patients 
The ultimate goal is to use this type of metabolomics analysis for first line screening of IEMs

Metagenomics and metabolomics analysis are allowing the exploration of the connection between intestinal microbiota and host metabolism Within 
the NutriTech project, 72 healthy subjects (male and female, ± 60 yo) were enrolled in a weight loss intervention (20% dietary energy restriction for 
12 weeks), losing in average 64% of their body weight In some volunteers, weight loss was associated with an improvement in insulin sensitivity, 
while in others only minor changes in insulin sensitivity were observed, despite weight loss Looking for metabolic signatures that could help 
understand these outcomes, two PLS-DA models were built: one using the results of body composition and metabolite profiling of plasma samples 
collected during an OGTT and a mixed meal test; the second using data from intestinal microbiota composition Marker metabolites of both groups 
were identified: in particular urea, specific bile acids, amino acids and acylcarnitines, as well as several discriminant bacterial species Individuals 
without improvement in insulin sensitivity following the weight loss, displayed higher plasma concentrations of tauroursodeoxycholic acid (a taurine-
conjugated bile acid), had higher proportions of Bilophila and other urease-positive bacteria within their microbiome, but lower concentrations of 
urea and deoxycholic acid The differences in microbiota composition are in line with the differences in plasma urea and bile acids concentrations 
This analysis brings new phenotypic information associated with differential weight loss and allows the generation of hypothesis Further studies are 
warranted and validation of the findings in larger cohorts is of course necessary

Batch independent screening of Inborn Errors of Metabolism with untargeted metabolomics
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Michiel Bongaerts, Erasmus Medicale Centre, Netherlands
CO-AUTHORS: Ramon Bonte, Serwet Demirdas, Henk Blom, George Ruijter
It has been demonstrated that untargeted metabolomics can be used for the screening of Inborn Errors of Metabolism (IEM) However, most studies 
have used control samples from the same experimental run for determining Z-scores of metabolites This limits both the amount and matching (sex, 
age) of the controls with the patient of interest We explored the use of controls originating from different experimental runs / batches In this way 
a better reference population can be defined for a given patient 6 batches were independently processed and subsequently merged In total 195 
controls and 33 patients were measured including 20 different IEM’s We explored multiple normalization methods to correct for signal drift and 
batch effects Internal standard based normalization methods performed better than statistical based methods We developed a normalization 
method, Metchalizer, which uses a mixed effect model and internal standards for normalization This method showed the best performance on our 
data compared with other methods After normalization with Metchalizer 56 out of 69 biomarkers for patients with known IEM’s were detected 
by using a reference population from other batches This study identified multiple age/ sex related metabolites by using a regression model The 
variance in control samples is determined by both biological and technical variance The biological variance for a given metabolite might strongly 
depend on age and/or sex and therefore matching patient and reference is important when determining Z-scores We show that using controls from 
other batches can solve this issue as long as batch effects can be corrected

BACKGROUND: Although hypocholesterolemic drugs are the first-line therapy for cardiovascular disease prevention, the most highly used stains 
are known for their various adverse effects such as muscle inflammation, liver damage, and hyperglycemia This study sought to determine 
variations of plasma metabolite concentrations related to hypocholesterolemic drugs intake using capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry 
METHODS: All data and samples were collected from participants of the Tsuruoka Metabolomics Cohort Study which was conducted in Japan 
Information on medical history, lifestyle, and medications was collected through a standardized, self-administered questionnaire After excluding 
those with a history of cancer, stroke, and myocardial infarction, we selected participants on hypocholesterolemic drugs alone as drug users 
(n=385) and those with LDL-cholesterol 140 mg/dl or above but without any drug as controls (n=1143) Associations between the drug intake and 
plasma metabolite concentrations were examined by linear regression Then, analysis of co-variance was conducted to examine the association 
between levels of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and hypocholesterolemic drug-related metabolites RESULTS: Out of 115 polar metabolites 
analyzed, five were identified as hypocholesterolemic drug-related metabolites These associations were independent of sex, age, systolic blood 
pressure, FPG, smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity, dietary energy, and liver function Three out of five metabolites (betaine, threonine, and 
cystine) were included in the trans-sulfuration pathway Cystine was also found to be associated with elevated levels of FPG, which may reflect the 
effect of statin intake on hyperglycemia CONCLUSION: Alterations of plasma metabolite levels in transsulfuration pathway were observed with 
hypocholesterolemic drug intake

Metabolomics study on the effect of combination treatment between pioglitazone and piceatannol on Non-Alcoholic  
Fatty Liver Disease in Rats

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common liver disorders worldwide NAFLD prevalence increases recently and becomes 
an important public health concern Given the importance of insulin resistance in the pathogenesis of NAFLD, insulin sensitizers were broadly 
investigated in treating NAFLD However, the long-term usage related side effects of insulin sensitizers have limited its utility Combination drug 
therapy utilizes more than one medication but each agent is given at a dose much lower than the normal therapeutic dose (ie, minimal side 
effects are anticipated) resulting in synergistic therapeutic outcomes In this study, we used metabolomics approaches to investigate a novel drug 
therapy using pioglitazone (a commonly used insulin sensitizer) in combination with piceatannol, a natural analog of resveratrol, to treat NAFLD in 
rat fed with high fat diet (HFD) Our in vivo study clearly demonstrated that Sprague-Dawley rats fed with HFD for 4 weeks could establish NAFLD 
Treatment with pioglitazone in combination with piceatannol would could significantly reduce the adverse effects induced by HFD It could lower 
the liver’s lipid content and the total cholesterol level in serum It was found that the metabolomics profile of combination drug therapy group 
was significantly different from that of the HFD group but it was getting closer to that of the control group Additionally, more than 20 metabolites 
were found as potential biomarkers indicating that this combination drug therapy could effectively modulate the lipid metabolism and result in 
improvements in NAFLD

One of the major challenges for the healthcare system is the increasing prevalence of obesity Several therapeutic approaches to overcome 
obesity modify adipose tissue metabolism to induce sustained weight loss However, how treatment effects are mediated on multiple metabolic 
pathways remain elusive We present a novel method to investigate tissue-specific metabolism in brown and white adipose tissue (BAT, WAT) in rats 
We performed open flow microperfusion (OFM) allowing collection of interstitial fluid of BAT and WAT, and subsequent metabolic profiling of the 
collected samples Metabolic profiling was performed in OFM samples with volumes as small as 15 µl each Analyzation was done using HILIC-HRMS 
(Vanquish UHPLC, QExactive mass spectrometer Thermo Fischer Scientific) in positive and negative electro spray ionisation mode with a gradient 
elution and a run time of 37 minutes Metabolic profiling identified 141 metabolites including lipids, fatty acids or amino acids that were classified into 
metabolites usable for multivariate (MVA) or for univariate (UVA) data analysis 94 MVA metabolites showed a median standard deviation of peak 
intensity in pooled quality control samples of 71%, low ppm and no retention-time deviation, making them usable for principal component analysis 
(PCA) and analysis of variance (ANOVA) UVA metabolites were only usable for ANOVA PCA showed a distinct signature for 2 metabolite classes 
in WAT and BAT samples MVA and some UVA metabolites from these classes also showed statistically significant differences in the ANOVA These 
results serve as a proof-of-concept to directly investigate adipose tissue metabolism in-vivo

Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based approach to evaluate lipidomic changes of plasma in  
Yijin-Tang-treated obese mice
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Jueun Lee, Korea Basic Science Institute, South Korea
CO-AUTHORS: So Min Lee, Eunjung Kang, Hye-Lin Kim, Jeeyoun Jung, Geum-Sook Hwang
Obesity is one of the most widespread health problems and is characterized by an aberrant lipid metabolism The herbal remedy Yijin (Erchen)-tang 
(YJT) is widely used to treat obesity-related disorders However, the change of lipid metabolism by YJT still remains unknown In this study, liquid 
chromatography (LC)-mass spectrometry (MS)-based approach was applied to investigate specific changes in lipid metabolism associated with the 
therapeutic effects of YJT-treated obese mice C57BL/6N mice were fed a high-fat and high-cholesterol (HFHC, 40% fat and 1% cholesterol) diet 
for 8 weeks and treated them with YJT for an additional 6 weeks We then performed untargeted lipidomic analysis of plasma using UPLC-QTOF 
MS coupled with multivariate statistical analysis Partial least squares-discriminant analysis score plots showed that YJT altered the lipid metabolic 
pattern of HFHC mice In particular, ceramides and triglycerides with saturated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids were significantly 
changed by YJT, which were significantly associated with insulin resistance, the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications and 
adipocytokine signaling pathway in pathway enrichment analysis In addition, the changes of total WBC, CRP and blood glucose, and correlation 
analysis between lipids and those clinical markers showed the effect of YJT treatment on ameliorating inflammation and improving insulin 
resistance These data suggest that YJT ameliorates obesity-induced systemic inflammation and insulin resistance by regulating lipid metabolism, 
and demonstrated that lipidomic profiling is a useful method to investigate the therapeutic effects of herbal decoctions in traditional Korean and 
Chinese medicine

Anabolic androgenic steroids induce weight loss in male Wistar rats in relation to free fatty acids in plasma
PRESENTING AUTHOR: David Balgoma, Uppsala University, Sweden
CO-AUTHORS: Sofia Zelleroth, Alfhild Grönbladh, Mathias Hallberg, Curt Pettersson, Mikael Hedeland
The abuse of anabolic androgenic steroids (AASs) in supratherapeutic doses is a source of public concern Among other effects, AASs affect 
lipogenesis and lipolysis in different tissues Lipidomics has the potential of unraveling the mechanism of the effects of AASs in health and disease 
Consequently, we treated Wistar rats every third day with vehicle, nandrolone decanoate, and testosterone undecanoate (supratherapeutic 
doses) The weight of the animals was measured every third day and, on day 18, the animals were euthanized, blood was collected, and plasma 
isolated After extraction, the plasma lipidome was analyzed on an Acquity UPLC-Synapt G2S Q-ToF equipped with a BEH C18 column Free fatty 
acids showed a specific regulation in relation to the treatment with AASs They increased in the treatment with nandrolone decanoate, but they 
did not change with testosterone undecanoate Weight decreased with the treatment with nandrolone decanoate but weight did not change with 
testosterone undecanoate As free fatty acids in plasma are known to reflect the levels of triacylglyceride lipolysis in the adipose tissue, weight 
regulation is associated with the levels of free fatty acids in plasma This effect might play a role in the effect of androgens in health and disease

It is alarming that 1 in 2 people (212 million) with diabetes were undiagnosed according to the International Diabetes Federation One reason for 
this problem is that the only sensitive assay for the early detection of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), which is time 
consuming and costly The goal of the H2020 EIT Health funded DeTecT2D consortium therefore is to develop a new metabolomics-based assay for 
the sensitive detection of pre-diabetes and T2D from a single fasting blood sample A set of 3 metabolite biomarkers for pre-diabetes and T2D was 
previously identified by members of the DeTecT2D consortium Based on clinical studies, the consortium extended this set to 6 metabolites, which 
were further evaluated in two population-based human cohorts (n=9870) In KORA and Fenland studies, the set of biomarkers showed comparable 
AUC values (83% and 94%) to detect individuals with pre-diabetes and newly diagnosed T2D, respectively We further evaluated whether the set 
of 6 metabolites was capable of replacing the standard OGTT Based on individuals with normal fasting glucose, we obtained AUC values of 74% 
and 77% for pre-diabetic and diabetic individuals in the KORA S4 study, respectively Although our extended set of biomarkers does not outperform 
the OGTT, it is highly predictive for newly diagnosed T2D Thus, our set of biomarkers holds great promise for use as a routine screening tool for 
individuals with pre-diabetes and undiagnosed T2D
