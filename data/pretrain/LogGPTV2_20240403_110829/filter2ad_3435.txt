puter and Communications Security in Denver, Colorado,
USA. The goal of this workshop is to discuss the problems
of privacy in the global interconnected societies and possi-
ble solutions to them. The workshop program includes 11
full papers and 3 short papers out of 32 total submissions.
Speciﬁc areas that are covered in the program include, but
are not limited to: web and social network privacy, mobile
and location privacy, communications privacy, and privacy-
preserving data analysis.

INTRODUCTION
The increased power and interconnectivity of computer
systems available today create the ability to store and pro-
cess large amounts of data, resulting in networked informa-
tion accessible from anywhere at any time. It is becoming
easier to collect, exchange, access, process, and link infor-
mation. This global scenario has inevitably resulted in an
increasing degree of awareness with respect to privacy. Pri-
vacy issues have been the subject of public debates, and the
need for privacy-aware policies, regulations, and techniques
has been widely recognized.
