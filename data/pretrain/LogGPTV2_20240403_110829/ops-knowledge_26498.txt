User: I would like to use my Raspberry Pi for some programming. (never done it before, I want to get into Python.) If I can transfer my programs yo my Windows 8.1 computer and run them there also, that would be perfect. Can I do that? Thanks!
Assistant: Yes! Python code is mostly platform independent. Only some specific libs must be compiled in the Maschine. These should be installed using pip (if needed). More info in Google.
