ABSTRACT
As interest in cryptocurrency has increased, problems have arisen
with Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) methods, the
most representative methods of acquiring cryptocurrency in a
blockchain. The PoW method is uneconomical and the PoS method
can be easily monopolized by a few people. To cope with this issue,
this paper introduces a Proof-of-Probability (PoP) method. The PoP
is a method where each node sorts the encrypted actual hash as
well as a number of fake hash, and then the first node to decrypt
actual hash creates block. In addition, a wait time is used when
decrypting one hash and then decrypting the next hash for restrict-
ing the excessive computing power competition. In addition, the
centralization by validaters with many stakes can be avoided in the
proposed PoP method.

1 INTRODUCTION
The success of Bitcoin, one of the most well-known blockchain
applications, has attracted much attention to cryptocurrency. Peo-
ple have adopted various methods to acquire cryptocurrencies in-
cluding Bitcoin. In addition, the major attraction point was an
incentive/compensation-earning method which is implemented
in each cryptocurrency. There are two representative methods in
incentive/compensation-earning, i.e., Proof-of-Work (PoW) and
Proof-of-Stake (PoS), as follows:
• PoW (Proof-of-Work): A way of getting compensation by
• PoS (Proof-of-Stake): A way of getting compensation by the

However, there exist drawbacks to the two major proof methods.
The PoW method is uneconomical due to excessive power consump-
tion occurred during complicate problem solving using distributed
computing systems (e.g., GPU). In addition, the PoS method is easy
to monopolize by people with large stakes and has a drawback that
new network participants may be reluctant to participate in the
blockchain network. Several Altcoin (the term collectively used for
the sequel to the Bitcoin) have begun to appear that have comple-
mented or applied new concepts. However, these Altcoins are not
completely deviate from the PoW and PoS methods. Therefore, it is
difficult to solve the problems of excessive power consumption or
monopoly those are occurring in currently existing methods.
This paper proposes a way to solve the issues/drawbacks in
PoW and PoS methods, which is called Proof-of-Probability (PoP).
In the proposed PoP method, each node has its own hash sorting
algorithm. When attempting to create transaction information in
blocks, the encrypted actual hash and a number of fake hash are
distributed over blockchain network. Then, each node finds the
actual hash through its own sorting algorithm. The node that first
mined the actual hash receives the cryptocurrency compensation.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2
provides related work and literature surveys. Section 3 explains the
details of the proposed Proof-of-Probability (PoP) method. Section 4
concludes this paper and presents future research directions.
2 RELATED WORK
This section introduces two major proof algorithms in blockchain
cryptocurrecy mechanisms, i.e., PoW (Section 2.1) and PoS (Sec-
tion 2.2).
2.1 PoW (Proof-of-Work)
The concept of PoW was initially introduced in 1993 by Cynthia
Dwork and Moni Naor. In 1999, it was named Proof-of-Work by
Markus Jakobsson and Ari Juels. In 2008, Nakamoto SatoshI adopted
the PoW method in Bitcoin systems, and this makes the PoW
method popular [1].
All transactions made of cryptocurrencies are stored in blocks
within the blockchain. A method for verifying the validity of these
blocks is called Proof-of-Work. The structure of the block in the
blockchain consists of Version, Pre Block Hash, Merkle Root, Cre-
ation Time, Bits (diffculty), and Nonce.
In other words, PoW is to find a nonce value and prove the
validity of the transaction. The node that found the nonce value
receives the cryptocurrency in return for proving the validity of the
transaction. The algorithm for finding nonce values is as follows.
All cryptocurrencies that can be mined use PoW method. Miner has
to insert input values one by one in order to do mining. An average

different, however the more and more cryptocurrency you have,
more cryptocurrency can be obtained continuously. For example, a
person who has 100 Peercoins would be entitled to validation 100
times more than a person who has only one Peercoin.
Figure 3: Qualification to validate based on stake.
In case of PoS method, one PC with internet connection can
participate in the blockchain. Moreover, additional GPU devices are
not necessary. The PoS method is more cost effective than the PoW
method because it does not use too much computing power than
PoW. However, it is not easy to inflow large amounts of money
into the cryptocurrency blockchain because of the fact that the
price increase is not large. The fact that a person with a large stake
can easily monopolize, the lack of gain in cryptocurrency makes it
unfair for new participants. This is one of major disadvantages in
the PoS method.
3 SYSTEM MODEL AND ALGORITHM
The basic design concept of the proposed method in this paper
is introduced in Section 3.1; and the details of the algorithm is
described in Section 3.2.
3.1 Design
The PoW method consumes a large amount of electricity due to
over-heated mining as well as the cost of purchasing a mining equip-
ment. To handle this issue, the PoS method solved the economical
disadvantage of the PoW method, however participants are hard
to come into the system, and they can easily be monopolized by a
large shareholder. Only the top four percents own 97 percents of
the actual Bitcoin issues. The method used to solve these problems
is called the PoP (Proof-of-Probability) in this paper. The overall
structure of this PoP method is shown in Fig. 4.
1) Each node (A, B, C, D) has its own hash sorting algorithm.
2) When a transaction occurs, it sends an encrypted hash and a
lot of fake hash through the blockchain network.
3) Each node prioritizes hashes to mine with its own hash sorting
algorithm.
4) The node put the input value into the sorted hash to find the
nonce value satisfying the computation. In the case of fake hash,

of trillions of input attempts are required to find a nonce value, and
it is almost impossible for the person to do so. For this reason, a
group called Mining Pools allocates their computing power, and
when the mining succeeds, the cryptocurrency is distributed by the
amount of allocated computing power. Currently, the computing
power of the Top4 Mining Pools is over 50 percent of the total. If
these Mining Pools have a combined computing power of more
than 50 percent, then the security of the cryptocurrency is in danger
of deteriorating rapidly.
Figure 2: Block creation algorithm.
The nother drawback of the PoW method is cost efficiency. Since
the PoW method has to maintain hash consistently, it is neces-
sary to purchase high-performance ASIC and GPU. Moreover, as
mentioned above, mining of cryptocurrency requires more than
a few trillion input attempts, which consumes a large amount of
electricity. The electricity consumption of Bitcoin and Ethereum,
which are representative cryptocurrencies adopting PoW method,
is higher than that of Syria, which is the 72nd largest electricity
consumption country in the world.
Based on this drawback, PoS (Proof-of-Stake), which will be
introduced in Section 2.2, appeared in order to solve the high cost
of mining, and the security problem caused by hash’s monopoly.
2.2 PoS (Proof-of-Stake)
The PoS method was initially used in Peercoin in 2012. PoS method
does not have mining that uses computing power unlike the PoW
method. In the PoS method, the block validity is verified through
own stake. It is similar to the idea of paying a dividend on a stock.
The process of validating a blockchain and creating a new block is
called forging. The forgers take only transaction fees. When you
connect a wallet with a certain amount of cryptocurrency to a
blockchain network, you can be rewarded with a cryptocurrency.

binarized. If the bit of a nonce of 2n is 1, the hash is determined to
be the true and that node creates a block. If the bit of a nonce of 2n
is 1, the hash is determined to be the true and that node creates a
block. n changes randomly every time a transaction occurs, and the
value of n is known only to the validator. Also, the calculated nonce
is verified for nonce calculated in the real hash. After validating,
set a time limit of one minute until the next is validated so that the
node can not be verified consecutively.
4 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we propose a Proof-of-Probability (PoP) method to
overcome the disadvantages of the existing PoW and PoS methods.
The time limit was set whenever one hash was verified, thus the
blockchain participants no longer need to have high computing
power. In addition, more participants have a stake, the higher the
probability of acquiring cryptocurrency, however this is not as
absolute as the PoS method when the hash sorting algorithm is
different for each node. Using this method will reduce the craze
of the overheated computing power and make the participation of
new blockchain nodes popular. The exact number of time limits,
bits adjusting algorithms in PoP method will be adjusted through
future experiments and evaluation of indicators. In addition, we will
investigate data-intensive performance evaluations for comparing
with existing methods in various aspects.
