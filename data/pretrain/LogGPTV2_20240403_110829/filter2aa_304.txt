#### Ethereum is Not Bitcoin
> "The key component is this idea of a Turing-complete blockchain."
> â€” Vitalik Buterin

Ethereum introduces the concept of **smart contracts**, which are self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code. These smart contracts have a wide range of applications and can handle complex transactions, making them a powerful tool in the blockchain ecosystem.

#### Smart Contracts: A Billion Reasons
- **30 million reasons will do**: The potential for innovation and financial gain is immense, but there are also significant risks to consider.

---

#### Caveats
- **Solidity**: The primary programming language for writing smart contracts on Ethereum.
- **Development Tools**:
  - **.sol files > bytecode > blockchain**: The compilation process converts Solidity code into bytecode, which is then deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.
  - **Atom with plugins**:
    - **language-ethereum**: Syntax highlighting and other features for Solidity.
    - **etheratom**: Integration with the Ethereum network for testing and deployment.
  - **Remix**: A browser-based IDE for writing, testing, and deploying Solidity code.
  - **Solgraph**: A tool for visualizing the control flow of Solidity functions.
  - **Oyente**: A static analysis tool for detecting security vulnerabilities in smart contracts.

#### Basic Methodology
1. **Interview Developers**: Understand the design and intended functionality of the smart contract.
2. **Review .sol File**: Examine the source code for any obvious issues.
3. **Try Compiling**: Ensure the code compiles without errors.
4. **Dissect Code Flow (Optional Solgraph)**: Use tools like Solgraph to visualize the control flow.
5. **Run Oyente (Cross Fingers)**: Use Oyente to detect potential vulnerabilities.
6. **Manually Verify 3/4 Vulnerabilities**: Review the results and manually verify the presence or absence of detected vulnerabilities.
7. **Manually Check for Common Vulnerabilities**:
   - **Reentrancy**: Ensure that reentrant calls are handled correctly.
   - **Default Public Functions**: Be cautious of default public visibility, as seen in the Parity wallet hack.
   - **Unchecked Send**: Avoid using `send` without proper checks, as demonstrated in the King of the Ether contract.
   - **Gas Limits**: Be aware of gas limits and ensure that transactions do not run out of gas.
   - **Withdraw Don't Send**: Ensure that withdrawal functions are implemented correctly.
   - **Encryption**: Use secure encryption methods.
   - **Transaction-Ordering Dependence**: Be mindful of the order in which transactions are processed.
   - **Call-Stack Depth Limit**: Avoid exceeding the call-stack depth limit.
   - **Variable or Function Ambiguity**: Ensure that variable and function names are clear and unambiguous.
   - **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs to prevent unexpected behavior.
   - **Throw (Deprecated)**: Use `require` and `assert` instead.
     - **require(condition)**: Check external conditions (e.g., invalid inputs or errors in external components).
     - **assert(condition)**: Handle internal errors.

#### Odds and Ends
- **Timestamp Dependence**: Avoid relying on block timestamps for critical operations.
- **Business Logic Flaws**: Ensure that the business logic is sound and free from flaws.
- **Separating Public/Private Data**: Clearly separate public and private data to maintain security.
