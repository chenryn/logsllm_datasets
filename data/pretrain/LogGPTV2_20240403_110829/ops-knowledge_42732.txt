`p4.exe` is the Perforce command-line tool, similar to Git, CVS, or SVN. I am attempting to execute multiple `p4 resolve` commands in a Python script to resolve conflicts in a large number of files (around 100).

However, I am unable to use the `p4 resolve -m` command as intended, which would automatically open my 3-way merge tool for conflicting files. The `-m` option is not accepted as a command-line parameter by `p4`.

Instead, I have to manually run `p4 resolve`, wait for the prompt, and then enter `m` to select the 3-way merge tool.

Is there a way in Python to automate this process, since I cannot pass the `m` parameter directly to `p4.exe`? Currently, I am using `os.system(myDosCommand)`.

**Assistant:**

Have you considered piping the input to the command? In `cmd.exe`, you can do something like this:

```cmd
C:\> echo m | p4 resolve
```

In Python, you can achieve this using the `subprocess` module, which allows you to send input to the command. Here's an example:

```python
import subprocess

# Define the command and the input
command = ['p4', 'resolve']
input_data = 'm\n'  # The \n simulates pressing Enter

# Run the command and pass the input
process = subprocess.Popen(command, stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, text=True)
stdout, stderr = process.communicate(input=input_data)

# Print the output and error (if any)
print("Output:", stdout)
print("Error:", stderr)
```

This approach should allow you to automate the process of entering the `m` option when running the `p4 resolve` command.
