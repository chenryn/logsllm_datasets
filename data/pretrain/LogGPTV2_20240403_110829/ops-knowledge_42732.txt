User: p4.exe is the perforce command line tool (git/cvs/svn like tool).
I am trying to launch several ms-dos commands 'p4 resolve' in an python script. because I have a hundred files to resolve.
However I cannot launch 'p4 resolve -m' as I want (which automatically opens my 3-way merge tool on the conflicting files). p4 doesn't accept the m as an executable parameter.
Instead, manually, I must do 'p4 resolve', then wait for the prompt to ask me for an option, and then only type 'm' there.
Do you know in python how I could feed the input since I cannot pass the 'm' parameter to the command line tool p4.exe.
For the moment I use os.system(myDosCommand)
Assistant: Have you tried merely piping the input to the command?
In cmd.exe:
C:\> echo m | p4 resolve
