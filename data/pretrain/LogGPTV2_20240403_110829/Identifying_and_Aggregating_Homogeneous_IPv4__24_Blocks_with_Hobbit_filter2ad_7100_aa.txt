ABSTRACT
Addresses in the Internet are typically measured as if
they represent larger aggregates. These larger blocks
may be based on preﬁxes advertised through BGP, with
larger preﬁxes broken into “/24s.” Such an approach
is typical in network mapping and other research, and
tries to balance the detail available by probing more
addresses with the eﬃciency available by probing only
as many as will discover new information.
In this paper, we consider preﬁx homogeneity: the
extent to which addresses within the same preﬁx are co-
located in topology and have similar performance. We
consider whether “24” is the right unit of homogeneity,
whether additional eﬃciency is possible by using larger
or even discontiguous address aggregates in some cases,
and in what situations additional detail may be missed
by treating addresses as representative of /24 blocks.
With these results, we present a map of homogeneous
address aggregates in the network.

IPv4 addresses are commonly represented in dot dec-
imal notation where each of four octets is written in
decimal numbers and concatenated with dots. In this
notation, it is very straightforward to discern whether
addresses are in the same /24. Although it is not clear
whether this notation promoted the use of /24 preﬁxes
or vice versa, it is true that /24 is a very common pre-
ﬁx. For example, 53% of BGP preﬁxes (obtained from
RouteViews BGP snapshot) are /24 preﬁxes.

considering a /24 block (that is, a block consisting of
IPv4 addresses having a common /24 preﬁx) as a unit.
Actually, several measurement studies and systems use
/24 blocks as a unit mostly for the purpose of reducing
measurement loads, possibly at the expense of accuracy
or completeness. An Internet outage detection system
called Trinocular [1] tracks outages for /24 blocks, and
a recent study on the availability of Internet hosts have
focused on the availability of /24 blocks [2]. The IPv4
topology dataset of CAIDA [3] is constructed by prob-
ing the destinations randomly chosen from each routed
/24 preﬁx. The EDNS-Client-Subnet DNS extension [4]
strongly encourages recursive resolvers to truncate the
IPv4 addresses of users to 24 bits, for the purpose of
protecting the privacy of users.
The performance of the systems using /24 blocks as a
unit is closely related to the homogeneity of /24 blocks,
because a lack of homogeneity may hurt their opera-
tions. For example, Trinocular may fail to detect out-
ages if a few addresses within a /24 block have an outage
while others are normally up. The EDNS-Client-Subnet
extension may also fail to ﬁnd the single best server for
addresses within a /24 block if some addresses are dis-
tant from each other.
In this paper, we measure homogeneity of /24 blocks
to verify whether /24 is a good unit. We focus on topo-
logical proximity because it is closely related to the op-
erations of the most of the systems that use /24 blocks
as a unit. If the addresses within /24s are topologically
distant, they are unlikely to have identical traceroute
results (thus aﬀecting topology discovery by CAIDA),
concurrent outages (aﬀecting Trinocular) and identical
corresponding front-end servers (aﬀecting the EDNS ex-
tension).
The measurement of homogeneity in terms of topolog-
ical proximity may seem to be a trivial problem which
can be simply solved by using traceroute. However,
due to the prevalence of load-balancing, comparing the
traceroute results is not straightforward. While Paris-
traceroute deals with load-balancing, it is not a panacea,
particularly for per-destination load-balancing. A chal-
lenge is that per-destination load-balancing is preva-
lent and it often changes even the last-hop routers of
the topologically co-located addresses. To address this
151challenge, we develop a methodology that distinguishes
diﬀerences in the routes due to load-balancing from
those due to distinct route entries. Using this method-
ology, which we call homogeneous block identiﬁcation
technique (Hobbit), we evaluate the homogeneity of /24
blocks.
Even if /24 blocks are homogeneous, they may not be-
come a good unit if they can be further aggregated into
larger homogeneous blocks. Therefore, our work in this
paper includes ﬁnding homogeneous blocks larger than
/24 blocks by aggregating homogeneous /24s. Given a
list of homogeneous /24 blocks, we ﬁrst associate each
/24 with its topology information. An obvious way of
the aggregation is to merge /24 blocks that have exactly
the same information. We ﬁrst aggregate the blocks in
this way, and then try to merge the /24 blocks with sim-
ilar but not identical information. Even if /24 blocks
are topologically co-located, their topology information
gathered by our methodology may not be identical (e.g.,
due to a relatively small number of information sources,
that is, responsive addresses within some /24s compared
to the others). We deal with this using a graph cluster-
ing algorithm called MCL [5]. We represent /24 blocks
as vertices and the similarities of the topology informa-
tion between /24s as edges, and then apply MCL.
Our work of ﬁnding homogeneous blocks has several
implications. First, homogeneous blocks larger than /24
can be used for improving eﬃciency of the systems using
/24 blocks as a unit. For example, by choosing desti-
nations for topology discovery from each of the iden-
tiﬁed homogeneous blocks which could be larger than
/24 (instead of from each /24), measurement loads can
be reduced. The saved resources can be utilized for en-
hancing the coverage of the topology dataset by sending
more probes to the heterogeneous /24 blocks we ﬁnd.
Second, the identiﬁcation of homogeneous blocks en-
ables stratiﬁed sampling. Compared to simple random
sampling, stratiﬁed sampling is more likely to choose
representative samples because it draws samples from
each homogeneous sub-group. Since IPv4 addresses are
owned by diverse organizations, the advantage of strat-
iﬁed sampling can be signiﬁcant. Finally, homogeneous
blocks can provide guidance in searching for new ad-
dresses of the hosts that changed their addresses by
DHCP. To characterize the behaviors of speciﬁc hosts,
it may not be enough to identify their addresses once
and keep tracking the addresses because of dynamic
addresses.
If there is no way of new addresses being
informed by the hosts, the new addresses need to be
searched for. Knowing the addresses that are in the
same homogeneous blocks as their (old) addresses can
help this search.
We make the following contributions in this paper.
• We develop a methodology called Hobbit that dis-
tinguishes between route diﬀerences due to load-
balancing and distinct route entries.
• We ﬁnd 1.77M homogeneous /24 blocks using Hob-
bit (which accounts for 90% of the /24s that were
measurable).
• We analyze the composition of heterogeneous /24
blocks.
• We ﬁnd 131k homogeneous blocks larger than /24s,
whose size ranges from 2 to 1,251 in terms of the
/24s they contain.
• We characterize top 15 biggest homogeneous blocks.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows.
We present the basic idea of a methodology for measur-
ing homogeneity of /24 blocks in Section 2. We detail
our methodology in Section 3, and describe measure-
ment results in Section 4. Section 5 and 6 describe how
to aggregate homogeneous /24 blocks and present the
aggregation results. We discuss implications of our work
in Section 7. We compare our work to related work in
Section 8 and conclude in Section 9 with future work.
2 METHODOLOGY
A straw-man proposal for measuring the homogeneity
of /24 blocks is to obtain IP-level routes of all the ad-
dresses within /24 and conclude that a /24 is homo-
geneous if all the IP-level routes are identical. An un-
derlying assumption of this approach is that the routes
towards co-located addresses are identical. However,
in today’s Internet where path diversity due to load-
balancing is prevalent, this is not true for many ad-
dresses. Even probes between the same source-destination
pairs often take diﬀerent paths [6]. We ﬁrst describe
how to deal with load-balanced paths.
2.1 Paris-traceroute is helpful but not enough
Paris-traceroute, which is a variant of traceroute, has
been proposed to correct inaccurate inferences of paths
due to load-balancing. It tunes the values of the packet
header ﬁelds that aﬀect the path selection by load-balancers,
so that all probes towards a destination follow the same
path. Paris-traceroute can also be extended to a tool1
that enumerates all paths between a source-destination
pair.
We use Paris-traceroute MDA in comparing (IP-level)
routes of diﬀerent addresses, to prevent from falsely
classifying identical routes as being diﬀerent.
If the
numbers of routes towards destinations are more than
one, identifying a single route for each destination may
cause false classiﬁcations. For example, if destinations
A and B both have routes {r1, r2}, and we ﬁnd only a
single route r1 for A and r2 for B, then A and B will
appear to have diﬀerent routes which is not true. To
prevent this from happening, we enumerate all routes
using Paris-traceroute MDA and compare the sets of
routes.
1The extended version is called Multipath detection al-
gorithm (MDA). In this paper, we use the term “Paris-
traceroute MDA” because MDA is often considered as
a subcomponent of Paris-traceroute.
152Based on the methodology described above, we per-
form a preliminary analysis on the homogeneity of /24
blocks. We ﬁrst identify active IPv4 addresses using
ZMap ICMP Echo Request scan dataset [7, 8]. This
dataset is generated by sending ICMP Echo request
probes to all public IPv4 addresses, and recording the
reply messages (if exist). We only consider IPv4 ad-
dresses that responded with ICMP Echo reply messages
to be active2. Given the list of active addresses, we
select an active address from each /26 block while ex-
cluding /24 blocks that have no active address in any
of the /26s within them. In other words, we only se-
lect /24s that have at least one active address in every
/26 block within them, to increase the conﬁdence of
our result to represent /24s not /25s nor /26s. For each
chosen address, we enumerate all the routes between a
source located at UMD and the chosen address. We con-
sider that addresses have identical routes if they share
at least one route. A /24 block is regarded as being
homogeneous if all of the (four) addresses within the
block have identical routes. To our surprise, 88% of the
/24 blocks were heterogeneous. Considering that we
address per-ﬂow load-balancing using Paris-traceroute
MDA and that we are generous in determining whether
addresses have identical routes by requiring only one
route to be identical, 88% is unexpectedly high. With
a doubt that ICMP rate limiting can be a confounding
factor, we try to eliminate the eﬀect of ICMP rate lim-
iting. We use unresponsive hops as wildcards that can
represent any address in comparing routes. For exam-
ple, routes ,  and  are all con-
sidered to be identical where * represents unresponsive
hop. This change to the route comparisons reduces
the percentage of heterogeneous /24 blocks, but very
slightly: The percentage of heterogeneous blocks de-
creases to 87% from 88%.
2.2 Per-destination load-balancing matters
The unexpectedly high ratio of heterogeneous /24
blocks implies that there can be other confounding fac-
tors than per-ﬂow load-balancing addressed by Paris-
traceroute MDA and ICMP rate limiting. One possibil-
ity is that load balancing is performed by destination,
not by ﬂow. We estimate how signiﬁcant the eﬀect of
per-destination load-balancing can be.
Although Paris-traceroute MDA is used to discover
per-destination load-balanced paths [6], it just enumer-
ates all distinct paths towards the addresses within /24
blocks, assuming that paths towards the addresses within
/24s are “identical” unless they are load-balanced paths.
2We used a single snapshot taken on the day before
our measurement started. About 376M addresses were
active in the snapshot we used. Since the availability
of Internet hosts varies over time, some of the identiﬁed
active addresses might not respond in our measurement,
and there might be some other active addresses than the
identiﬁed ones.

entries (left) and per-destination load-balancing (right).
However, our goal in this paper is to verify whether /24
blocks are homogeneous and thus we cannot rely on
MDA. Instead, we make an assumption that is much
more likely to be true than the assumption of Paris-
traceroute MDA. We assume that the addresses within
“/31” blocks have identical routes unless per-destination
load-balancing occurs. Based on this assumption, we
select two addresses that are within a /31 block from
each /24, and then discover routes between a source (lo-
cated at UMD) and the selected addresses using Paris-
traceroute MDA. If the addresses within /31s have dis-
tinct routes, we consider that the /24s they are cho-
sen from are aﬀected by per-destination load-balancing.
About 77% of the /31s have distinct routes. This shows
that per-destination load-balancing is prevalent and can
be a signiﬁcant confounding factor in determining the
homogeneity by comparing routes.
2.3 Dealing with per-destination load-
balancing
Per-destination load-balancers can take diﬀerent paths
even for topologically co-located addresses. Hence, in
the presence of per-destination load-balancing, homo-
geneity cannot be measured by simply comparing routes.
A remedy is to focus on last-hop routers3 instead of
the entire routes.
If routes are diﬀerent due to load-
balancing but eventually converge, last-hop routers will
be identical. If routes are identical, last-hop routers are
obviously identical. One missing case is when routes are
diﬀerent due to load-balancing but do not converge. In
other words, last-hop routers are diﬀerent due to load-
balancing. It might be questionable how often this hap-
pens. According to the traceroutes dataset we collected
for the addresses within /31s, about 30% of the address
pairs within /31s have distinct last-hop routers. These
diﬀerences are likely due to load-balancing (under the
assumption that addresses within /31s are unlikely to
have diﬀerent routes without load-balancing).
3Last-hop routers are the last routers in the paths to the
destinations. Their addresses may not be identiﬁed by
traceroute if they do not respond to traceroute probes.

Figure 2: The relationship between the sets of the ad-
dresses grouped by last-hop routers.  denotes
X is a last-hop router of a destination Y .
The question is how to distinguish whether the dif-
ference in last-hop routers is caused by load-balancing
or heterogeneity. We consider that addresses are het-
erogeneous (in terms of topological proximity) if their
last-hop routers are diﬀerent due to distinct route en-
tries rather than load-balancing4 (ﬁgure 1).
Route
entries are typically generated for subnets of which net-
work preﬁxes do not overlap each other, unless one sub-
net includes the other. Therefore, the relationships be-
tween distinct route entries will be hierarchical. To be
speciﬁc, every pair of the entries will be either mutu-
ally disjoint (a sibling relationship5), or one includes
the other (a parent-child relationship). Hence, if last-
hop routers are diﬀerent due to distinct route entries,
when grouping addresses by their last-hop routers and
representing each group by the range from the numer-
ically smallest address in the group to the largest one,
the relationships between the ranges also will be hier-
archical (Figure 2a and 2b). The contrapositive of this
statement, which should be also true, is that the ad-
dresses within /24 blocks are not heterogeneous (i.e.,
homogeneous), if any of the addresses is not hierarchi-
cal when grouped by their last-hop routers (Figure 2c).
Combining this with that /24 blocks are homogeneous if
their addresses have identical last-hop routers, we deter-
mine that /24s are homogeneous if any of the addresses
within them does not a have hierarchical relationship
with others, or they all have common last-hop routers.
We call this methodology homogeneous block identiﬁca-
tion technique (Hobbit).
3 ELABORATION ON HOBBIT
3.1 Last-hop vs entire traceroute
The basic idea of Hobbit is to examine whether the
addresses within /24s have hierarchical relationships.
This idea is applicable not only to last-hop routers but
also to entire traceroutes. (We can group addresses hav-
