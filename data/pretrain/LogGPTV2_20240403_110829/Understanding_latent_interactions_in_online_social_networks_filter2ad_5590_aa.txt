## Abstract

Popular online social networks (OSNs) such as Facebook and Twitter are transforming the way users communicate and interact with the Internet. A deep understanding of user interactions in OSNs can provide valuable insights into human social behavior and the design of social platforms and applications. However, recent studies have shown that a majority of user interactions on OSNs are latent interactions, which are passive actions like profile browsing that cannot be observed by traditional measurement techniques.

In this paper, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of both visible and latent user interactions in OSNs. To obtain quantifiable data on latent user interactions, we conducted a detailed measurement study on Renren, the largest OSN in China, with over 150 million users. All friendship links in Renren are public, allowing us to crawl a connected graph component of 42 million users and 1.66 billion social links in 2009. Renren also maintains detailed visitor logs for each user profile and counters for each photo and diary/blog entry. We captured detailed histories of profile visits over a 90-day period for more than 61,000 users in the Peking University Renren network. Using these data, we studied issues such as user profile popularity, reciprocity of profile visits, and the impact of content updates on user popularity. Our findings indicate that latent interactions are much more prevalent and frequent than visible events, are non-reciprocal in nature, and that profile popularity is uncorrelated with the frequency of content updates. Finally, we constructed latent interaction graphs as models of user browsing behavior and compared their structural properties with those of visible interaction graphs and social graphs.

## 1. Introduction

Online social networks (OSNs) are not only popular tools for interaction and communication but also have the potential to alter the way users engage with the Internet. Today, social networks count close to one billion members worldwide. Facebook, the most popular OSN, has more than 500 million active users and has surpassed Google as the most visited site on the Internet. Increasingly, Facebook and Twitter are replacing email and search engines as users' primary interfaces to the Internet. This trend is likely to continue as networks like Facebook seek to personalize the web experience by giving sites access to information about their visitors and their friends through new platforms such as OpenGraph.

A deep understanding of user interactions in social networks can provide important insights into questions of human social behavior and the design of social platforms and applications. For example, gauging the level of reciprocity in social interactions can shed light on the factors that motivate interactions. Additionally, understanding how interactions are distributed between friends can assist in tracking information dissemination in social networks, thus identifying "popular" or "influential" users to target in branding and ad campaigns. Finally, lessons from studying how users interact through different communication tools can guide the design of new, more engaging mechanisms for social interaction.

Initial measurement studies of OSNs focused on topological characteristics of the social graph, the underlying structures of these services that capture explicit relationships between users. More recent work has shifted focus to measuring observable social interactions. By examining records of interaction events across different links, these studies distinguish close-knit, active relationships from weak or dormant relationships and derive a more accurate predictive model for social behavior.

Recently, two significant studies used clickstream data at the network level to capture the behavior of OSN users, revealing that passive or latent interactions such as profile browsing often dominate user events in a social network. Unfortunately, these studies have been constrained by several limitations of clickstream data. First, the type of data captured in a clickstream is highly dependent on the time range of the clickstream. Captured events are also from the perspective of the active user, making it challenging to correlate events across time and users. Second, clickstream data is highly dependent on the structure of the OSN site and can be extremely challenging to reduce large volumes of data to distinct user events. Finally, each application-level user event generates a large volume of clickstream data, and extremely large clickstreams are needed to capture a significant number of user events. These properties of verbosity and complexity mean that it is extremely difficult to gather enough clickstream data to study user interactions comprehensively at scale.

However, a comprehensive and large-scale study is necessary to answer many of the deeper questions about user behavior and interactions, such as: Are user interactions reciprocal? Do latent interactions such as profile browsing reflect the same popularity distributions as visible actions like user comments? What can users do to become "popular" and draw more visitors to their pages?

In this paper, we seek to answer these and other questions in our search for a deeper understanding of user interactions in OSNs. To address the challenge of gathering data on latent interactions, we performed a large-scale, crawl-based measurement of the Renren social network, the largest and most popular OSN in China. Functionally, it is essentially a clone of Facebook, with similar structure, layout, and features. Unlike Facebook, Renren has two unique features that make it an attractive platform to study user interactions.

First, while Renren users have full privacy control over their private profiles, their friend lists are public and unprotected by privacy mechanisms. This allowed us to crawl an exhaustive snapshot of Renren's largest connected component, producing an extremely large social graph with 42.1 million nodes and 1.66 billion edges. Second, and perhaps more importantly, Renren user profiles make a variety of statistics visible to both the profile owner and her visitors. Each user profile keeps a visible list of "recent visitors" who browse the profile, sorted in order, and updated in real-time. Each photo and diary entry also has its own page with a count of visits by users other than the owner. These records are extremely valuable, as they expose latent browsing events to our crawlers, granting us a unique opportunity to gather and analyze large-scale statistics on latent browsing events.

### Our Study

Our study of latent user interactions includes three significant components. First, we characterize properties of the large Renren social graph and compare them to known statistics of other OSNs, including Facebook, Cyworld, Orkut, and Twitter. Our second component focuses on questions concerning latent interactions and constitutes the bulk of our study. We describe a log reconstruction algorithm that uses relative clocks to merge visitor logs from repeated crawls into a single sequential visitor stream. We repeatedly crawled users in the Peking University Renren network over a period of 90 days, extracted profile visit history for 61K users, and examined issues of popularity, visitor composition, reciprocity, and latency of reciprocation. We compared user popularity distributions for latent and visible interactions and used per-object visit counters to quantify the level of user engagement generated from user profiles, photos, and diary entries. We also studied the correlation of different types of user-generated content with a user’s profile popularity. Finally, in our third component, we built latent interaction graphs from our visitor logs and compared their structure to those of social graphs and interaction graphs. We also revisited the issue of experimental validation for social applications and performed a case study of the impact of different social graphs on evaluating information dissemination algorithms.

Our study provides several insights into user behavior on online social networks, including:
- User profile popularity follows a Zipf distribution.
- Profile visits have extremely low reciprocity, despite the fact that Renren users have full access to the list of recent visitors to their profile.
- Compared to visible interactions, latent profile browsing is far more prevalent and more evenly distributed across a user’s friends. Profile visits are less likely to be repeated than visible interactions but are more likely to generate visible comments than other content such as photos and diary entries.
- For all users, regardless of their number of friends, profile popularity is not strongly correlated with the frequency of new profile content.

Finally, we use our data to construct latent interaction graphs that capture browsing activity between OSN users. Our analysis finds that latent interaction graphs exhibit general Power-law features, fall between social and visible interaction graphs in terms of connectivity, but show less local clustering properties than both.

## 2. Methodology and Initial Analysis

Before diving into detailed analysis of user interaction events, we begin by providing background information about the Renren social network and our measurement methodology. We then give specifics on our techniques for reconstructing profile browsing histories from periodic crawls. Using a random subset of user profiles, we perform sampling experiments to quantify the expected errors introduced by our approach. Finally, we analyze characteristics of the Renren social graph and compare it to known graph properties of existing social graph measurements.

### 2.1 The Renren Social Network

Launched in 2005, Renren is the largest and oldest OSN in China. Renren can be best characterized as Facebook’s Chinese twin, with most or all of Facebook’s features, layout, and a similar user interface. Users maintain personal profiles, upload photos, write diary entries (blogs), and establish bidirectional social links with their friends. Renren users inform their friends about recent events with 140-character status updates, much like tweets on Twitter. Similar to the Facebook news feed, all user-generated updates and comments are tagged with the sender’s name and a timestamp.

Renren organizes users into membership-based networks, much like Facebook used to. Networks represent schools, companies, or geographic regions. Membership in school and company networks requires authentication. Students must offer an IP address, email address, or student credential from the associated university. Corporate email addresses are needed for users to join corporate networks. Renren’s default privacy policy makes profiles of users in geographic networks private, making them difficult to crawl. Fortunately, profiles of users in authenticated networks are public by default to other members of the same network. This allowed us to access user profiles within the Peking University network, as we could create nearly unlimited authenticated accounts using our own block of IP addresses.

Like Facebook, a Renren user’s homepage includes a number of friend recommendations that encourage the formation of new friend relationships. Renren lists 3 users with the most number of mutual friends in the top right corner of the page. In addition, Renren shows a list of 8 "popular users" at the very bottom of the page. These popular users are randomly selected from the 100 users with the most friends in the university network.

#### Unique Features

Renren differs from Facebook in several significant ways. First, each Renren user profile includes a box that shows the total number of visitors to the profile, along with names and links to the last 9 visitors ordered from most to least recent. In addition, Renren also keeps on each individual photo and diary page a visible counter of visitors (not including the user himself). These lists and counters have the same privacy settings as the main profile. They have the unique property of making previously invisible events visible, and are the basis for our detailed measurements on latent user interactions.

A second crucial feature is that friend lists in Renren are always public. Users have no way to hide them. This allowed us to perform an exhaustive crawl of the largest connected component in Renren (42.1 million users). This contrasts with other OSNs, where full social graph crawls are prevented by user privacy policies that hide friendship links from the public. The exception is Twitter, which behaves more like a public news medium than a traditional social network.

Additionally, comments in Renren are threaded, i.e., each new comment is always in response to one single other event or comment. For example, user A can respond to user B’s comment on user C’s profile, and only B is notified of the new message. Thus, we can precisely distinguish the intended target of each comment.

One final difference between Renren and Facebook is that each standard user is limited to a maximum of 1,000 friends. Users may pay a subscription fee to increase this limit to 2,000. From our measurements, we saw that very few users (0.3%) took advantage of this feature.

### 2.2 Data Collection and General Statistics

Like Facebook, Renren evolved from a social network in a university setting. Its predecessor was called Xiaonei, literally meaning "inside school." In September 2009, Renren merged with Kaixin, the second-largest OSN in China, and absorbed all of Kaixin’s user accounts.

#### Crawling the Renren Social Graph

We crawled the entire Renren network from April 2009 to June 2009, and again from September to November of 2009. We seeded crawlers with the 30 most popular users’ profiles and proceeded to perform a breadth-first traversal of the social graph. During the crawl, we collected unique user IDs, network affiliations, and friendship links to other users. For our study, we use data from our last crawl, which was an exhaustive snapshot that included 42,115,509 users and 1,657,273,875 friendship links. While this is significantly smaller than the 70 million users advertised by Renren in September 2009, we believe the discrepancy is due to Kaixin users who were still organized as a separate, disconnected subgraph. We describe properties of the social graph later in this section.

#### Crawling the PKU Network

We performed smaller, more detail-oriented crawls of the PKU network between September and November of 2009 (90 days) to collect information about users’ profiles and interaction patterns. This methodology works because the default privacy policy for authenticated networks is to make full profiles accessible to other members of the same network. Since we collected the network memberships of all users during our complete crawl, we were able to isolate the 100,973 members of the PKU network to seed our detailed crawl. Of these users, 61,405 users had the default, permissive privacy policy, enabling us to collect their detailed information. This covers the majority of users (60.8%) in the PKU network and provides overall network coverage similar to other studies that crawled OSN regional networks.

As part of our PKU crawls, we gathered all comments generated by users in message board posts, diary entries, photos, and status updates. This data forms the basis of our experiments involving visible interactions. Our dataset represents the complete record of public visible interactions between users in the PKU network. In total, 19,782,140 comments were collected, with 1,218,911 of them originating in the September to November 2009 timeframe.

Figure 1 plots the percentage of comments in various applications each day. The most popular events to comment on are status updates, which account for roughly 55% of all daily comments. Message boards cover 25%, while diary and photo each account for roughly 10%.

#### Privacy and Data Anonymization

Our study focuses on the structure of social graphs and interaction events between users. Since we do not need any actual content of comments, photos, or user profiles, we waited for crawls to complete, then went through our data to anonymize user IDs and strip any private data from our dataset to protect user privacy. In addition, all user IDs were hashed to random IDs, and all timestamps are replaced with relative sequence numbers. We note that our group has visited and held research meetings with technical teams at Renren, and they are aware of our ongoing research.

### 2.3 Measuring Latent User Interactions

In addition to visible interactions generated by users in the PKU network, we also recorded the recent visitor records displayed on each user’s profile. This data forms the basis of our study of latent interactions.
