ABSTRACT
Popular online social networks (OSNs) like Facebook and Twitter
are changing the way users communicate and interact with the In-
ternet. A deep understanding of user interactions in OSNs can pro-
vide important insights into questions of human social behavior,
and into the design of social platforms and applications. However,
recent studies have shown that a majority of user interactions on
OSNs are latent interactions, passive actions such as proﬁle brows-
ing that cannot be observed by traditional measurement techniques.
In this paper, we seek a deeper understanding of both visible
and latent user interactions in OSNs. For quantiﬁable data on la-
tent user interactions, we perform a detailed measurement study
on Renren, the largest OSN in China with more than 150 million
users to date. All friendship links in Renren are public, allowing us
to exhaustively crawl a connected graph component of 42 million
users and 1.66 billion social links in 2009. Renren also keeps de-
tailed visitor logs for each user proﬁle, and counters for each photo
and diary/blog entry. We capture detailed histories of proﬁle visits
over a period of 90 days for more than 61,000 users in the Peking
University Renren network, and use statistics of proﬁle visits to
study issues of user proﬁle popularity, reciprocity of proﬁle vis-
its, and the impact of content updates on user popularity. We ﬁnd
that latent interactions are much more prevalent and frequent than
visible events, non-reciprocal in nature, and that proﬁle popularity
are uncorrelated with the frequency of content updates. Finally, we
construct latent interaction graphs as models of user browsing be-
havior, and compare their structural properties against those of both
visible interaction graphs and social graphs.

INTRODUCTION
Not only are online social networks (OSNs) popular tools for in-
teraction and communication, but they have the potential to alter
the way users interact with the Internet. Today’s social networks
already count close to one billion members worldwide. Facebook,
the most popular OSN, has more than 500 million active users [26],
and has surpassed Google as the most visited site on the Inter-
net [30]. Increasingly, Facebook and Twitter are replacing email
and search engines as users’ primary interfaces to the Internet [9,
15]. This trend is likely to continue, as networks like Facebook seek
to personalize the web experience by giving sites access to infor-
mation about their visitors and their friends, through new platforms
such as OpenGraph [23].
A deep understanding of user interactions in social networks
can provide important insights into questions of human social be-
havior, as well as the design of social platforms and applications.
For example, gauging the level of reciprocity in social interac-
tions can shed light on the factors that motivate interactions.
In
addition, understanding how interactions are distributed between
friends can assist in tracking information dissemination in social
networks, thus identifying “popular” or “inﬂuential” users to target
in branding and ad campaigns [6, 11, 14]. Finally, lessons from
studying how users interact through different communication tools
can guide the design of new, more engaging mechanisms for social
interaction.
Initial measurement studies [1, 22, 29] of OSNs focused on topo-
logical characteristics of the social graph, the underlying structures
of these services that capture explicit relationships between users.
To better understand the true nature of relationships between OSN
users, more recent work has shifted focus to measuring observable
social interactions [7, 19, 28, 29]. By examining records of interac-
tion events across different links, the studies distinguish close-knit,
active relationships from weak or dormant relationships, and derive
a more accurate predictive model for social behavior.
Recently, two signiﬁcant studies [3, 25] used clickstream data
at the network level to capture the behavior of OSN users, and re-
vealed that passive or latent interactions such as proﬁle browsing
often dominate user events in a social network [3].
Unfortunately, these studies have been constrained by several
limitations of clickstream data. First, the type of data captured in
a clickstream is highly dependent on the time range of the click-
stream. Captured events are also from the perspective of the ac-
tive user, making it challenging to correlate events across time and
users. Second, clickstream data is also highly dependent on the
369structure of the OSN site, and can be extremely challenging to re-
duce large volumes of data to distinct user events. Finally, each
application-level user event generates a large volume of clickstream
data, and extremely large clickstreams are needed to capture a sig-
niﬁcant number of user events. These properties of verboseness
and complexity mean that it is extremely difﬁcult to gather enough
clickstream data to study user interactions comprehensively at scale.
However, a comprehensive and large study is necessary to answer
many of the deeper questions about user behavior and interactions,
such as: are user interactions reciprocal, do latent interactions such
as proﬁle browsing reﬂect the same popularity distributions as visi-
ble actions like user comments, what can users do to become “pop-
ular” and draw more visitors to their pages?
In this paper, we seek to answer these and other questions in
our search for a deeper understanding of user interactions in OSNs.
To address the challenge of gathering data on latent interactions,
we perform a large-scale, crawl-based measurement of the Renren
social network [24], the largest and most popular OSN in China.
Functionally, it is essentially a clone of Facebook, with similar
structure, layout and features. Like Facebook, Renren also evolved
from a university-based social network (a predecessor called Xi-
aonei). Unlike Facebook, Renren has two unique features that make
it an attractive platform to study user interactions.
First, while Renren users have full privacy control over their pri-
vate proﬁles, their friend lists are public and unprotected by pri-
vacy mechanisms. This allowed us to crawl an exhaustive snapshot
of Renren’s largest connected component, producing an extremely
large social graph with 42.1 million nodes and 1.66 billion edges.
Second, and perhaps more importantly, Renren user proﬁles make
a variety of statistics visible to both the proﬁle owner and her visi-
tors. Each user proﬁle keeps a visible list of “recent visitors” who
browse the proﬁle, sorted in order, and updated in real-time. Each
photo and diary entry also has its own page with a count of visits by
users other than the owner. These records are extremely valuable,
in that they expose latent browsing events to our crawlers, granting
us an unique opportunity to gather and analyze large scale statistics
on latent browsing events.
Our study.
Our study of latent user interactions includes three
signiﬁcant components. First, we begin by characterizing proper-
ties of the large Renren social graph, and compare them to known
statistics of other OSNs, including Facebook, Cyworld, Orkut and
Twitter. Our second component focuses on questions concerning
latent interactions, and constitutes the bulk of our study. We de-
scribe a log reconstruction algorithm that uses relative clocks to
merge visitor logs from repeated crawls into a single sequential
visitor stream. We repeatedly crawl users in the Peking University
Renren network over a period of 90 days, extract proﬁle visit his-
tory for 61K users, and examine issues of popularity, visitor com-
position, reciprocity, and latency of reciprocation. We compare
user popularity distributions for latent and visible interactions, and
use per-object visit counters to quantify the level of user engage-
ment generated from user proﬁles, photos, and diary entries. We
also study correlation of different types of user-generated content
with a user’s proﬁle popularity. Finally, in our third component, we
build latent interaction graphs from our visitor logs, and compare
their structure to those of social graphs and interaction graphs. We
also revisit the issue of experimental validation for social applica-
tions, and perform a case study of the impact of different social
graphs on evaluating information dissemination algorithms.
Our study provides a number of insights into user behavior on
online social networks, including:
ulation, and closely follows a Zipf distribution.
(cid:129) Users’ proﬁle popularity varies signiﬁcantly across the pop-
(cid:129) Proﬁle visits have extremely low reciprocity, despite the fact
that Renren users have full access to the list of recent visitors
to their proﬁle.
(cid:129) Compared to visible interactions, latent proﬁle browsing is
far more prevalent and more evenly distributed across a user’s
friends. Proﬁle visits are less likely to be repeated than visi-
ble interactions, but are more likely to generate visible com-
ments than other content such as photos and diary entries.
(cid:129) For all users, regardless of their number of friends, proﬁle
popularity is not strongly correlated with frequency of new
proﬁle content.
Finally, we use our data to construct latent interaction graphs
that capture browsing activity between OSN users. Our analysis
ﬁnds that latent interaction graphs exhibit general Power-law fea-
tures, fall between social and visible interaction graphs in terms of
connectivity, but show less local clustering properties than both.
2. METHODOLOGY AND INITIAL
ANALYSIS
Before diving into detailed analysis of user interaction events,
we begin by providing background information about the Renren
social network and our measurement methodology. We then give
more speciﬁcs on our techniques for reconstructing proﬁle brows-
ing histories from periodic crawls. Using a random subset of user
proﬁles, we perform sampling experiments to quantify the expected
errors introduced by our approach. Finally, we analyze character-
istics of the Renren social graph, and compare it to known graph
properties of existing social graph measurements.
2.1 The Renren Social Network
Launched in 2005, Renren is the largest and oldest OSN in China.
Renren can be best characterized as Facebook’s Chinese twin, with
most or all of Facebook’s features, layout, and a similar user inter-
face. Users maintain personal proﬁles, upload photos, write diary
entries (blogs), and establish bidirectional social links with their
friends. Renren users inform their friends about recent events with
140 character status updates, much like tweets on Twitter. Similar
to the Facebook news feed, all user-generated updates and com-
ments are tagged with the sender’s name and a time stamp.
Renren organizes users into membership-based networks, much
like Facebook used to. Networks represent schools, companies,
or geographic regions. Membership in school and company net-
works require authentication. Students must offer an IP address,
email address, or student credential from the associated univer-
sity. Corporate email addresses are needed for users to join cor-
porate networks. Renren’s default privacy policy makes proﬁles of
users in geographic networks private. This makes them difﬁcult
to crawl [29]. Fortunately, proﬁles of users in authenticated net-
works are public by default to other members of the same network.
This allowed us to access user proﬁles within the Peking Univer-
sity network, since we could create nearly unlimited authenticated
accounts using our own block of IP addresses.
Like Facebook, a Renren user’s homepage includes a number
of friend recommendations that encourage formation of new friend
relationships. Renren lists 3 users with the most number of mutual
friends in the top right corner of the page.
In addition, Renren
shows a list of 8 “popular users” at the very bottom of the page.
These popular users are randomly selected from the 100 users with
the most friends in the university network.

Unique features.
Renren differs from Facebook in several sig-
niﬁcant ways. First, each Renren user proﬁle includes a box that
shows the total number of visitors to the proﬁle, along with names
and links to the last 9 visitors ordered from most to least recent.
In addition, Renren also keeps on each individual photo and diary
page a visible counter of visitors (not including the user himself).
These lists and counters have the same privacy settings as the main
proﬁle. They have the unique property of making previously invis-
ible events visible, and are the basis for our detailed measurements
on latent user interactions.
A second crucial feature is that friend lists in Renren are always
public. Users have no way to hide them. This allowed us to perform
an exhaustive crawl of the largest connected component in Renren
(42.1 million users). This contrasts with other OSNs, where full
social graph crawls are prevented by user privacy policies that hide
friendship links from the public. The exception is Twitter, which
behaves more like a public news medium than a traditional social
network [16].
In addition, comments in Renren are threaded, i.e. each new
comment is always in response to one single other event or com-
ment. For example, user A can respond to user B’s comment on
user C’s proﬁle, and only B is notiﬁed of the new message. Thus
we can precisely distinguish the intended target of each comment.
One ﬁnal difference between Renren and Facebook is that each
standard user is limited to a maximum of 1,000 friends. Users may
pay a subscription fee to increase this limit to 2,000. From our
measurements, we saw that very few users (0.3%) took advantage
of this feature.
2.2 Data Collection and General Statistics
Like Facebook, Renren evolved from a social network in a uni-
versity setting. Its predecessor was called Xiaonei, literally mean-
ing “inside school.” In September 2009, Renren merged with Kaixin,
the second largest OSN in China, and absorbed all of Kaixin’s user
accounts.
Crawling the Renren social graph.
We crawled the entire
Renren network from April 2009 to June 2009, and again from
September to November of 2009. We seed crawlers with the 30
most popular users’ proﬁles, and proceeded to perform a breadth-
ﬁrst traversal of the social graph. During the crawl, we collect
unique userIDs, network afﬁliations, and friendship links to other
users. For our study, we use data from our last crawl, which was an
exhaustive snapshot that included 42,115,509 users and 1,657,273,875
friendship links. While this is signiﬁcantly smaller than the 70 mil-
lion users advertised by Renren in September 2009, we believe the
discrepancy is due to Kaixin users who were still organized as a
separate, disconnected subgraph. We describe properties of the so-
cial graph later in this section.
Crawling the PKU network.
We performed smaller, more
detail oriented crawls of the PKU network between September and
November of 2009 (90 days) to collect information about user’s
proﬁles and interaction patterns. This methodology works because
the default privacy policy for authenticated networks is to make full
proﬁles accessible to other members of the same network. Since we
collected the network memberships of all users during our complete
crawl, we were able to isolate the 100,973 members of the PKU
network to seed our detailed crawl. Of these users, 61,405 users had
the default, permissive privacy policy, enabling us to collect their
detailed information. This covers the majority of users (60.8%) in
the PKU network, and provides overall network coverage similar
to other studies that crawled OSN regional networks [29].
As part of our PKU crawls, we gathered all comments generated
by users in message board posts, diary entries, photos, and status
updates. This data forms the basis of our experiments involving
visible interactions. Our dataset represents the complete record of
public visible interactions between users in the PKU network. In
total, 19,782,140 comments were collected, with 1,218,911 of them
originating in the September to November 2009 timeframe.
Figure 1 plots the percentage of comments in various applica-
tions each day. The most popular events to comment on are status
updates, which accounts for roughly 55% of all daily comments.
Message boards cover 25%, while diary and photo each account
for roughly 10%.
Privacy and data anonymization.
Our study focuses on the
structure of social graphs and interaction events between users.
Since we do not need any actual content of comments, photos, or
user proﬁles, we waited for crawls to complete, then went through
our data to anonymize userIDs and strip any private data from our
dataset to protect user privacy. In addition, all user IDs were hashed
to random IDs, and all timestamps are replaced with relative se-
quence numbers. We note that our group has visited and held re-
search meetings with technical teams at Renren, and they are aware
of our ongoing research.
2.3 Measuring Latent User Interactions
In addition to visible interactions generated by users in the PKU
network, we also recorded the recent visitor records displayed on
each user’s proﬁle. This data forms the basis of our study of latent
interactions.
