I have a few files for making HTTP requests. I want to extend those to allow
easier access to our API. Here is some sample code:
http.ts
    export type HTTPParameters = { [key: string]: string };
    export type HTTPHeaders = { [key: string]: string };
    export enum HTTPMethod { Get, Head, Post, Put, ... };
api.ts (->ArrowsApiRequestMethodApiRequestMethod=HTTPRequestMethod<-;
    // Expected '{'
The actual working solution looks like this:
    import { SomeEnum as MyEnum } from './http.ts';
    export { MyEnum };
    export class Foo {
      constructor(public method: MyEnum = MyEnum.Get) {}
    }
I might be missing something here, but if this is really the only solution,
then it's pretty ugly and it would be nice to have something better.
