## Abstract
We present XLINK, a multi-path QUIC video transport solution, which we evaluated in the context of Taobao short videos. XLINK is designed to address two key operational challenges: (1) optimizing user-perceived Quality of Experience (QoE) in terms of robustness, smoothness, responsiveness, and mobility, and (2) minimizing cost overhead for service providers, typically Content Delivery Networks (CDNs). The core of XLINK leverages QUIC's user-space nature to directly capture and use user-perceived video QoE to control multi-path scheduling and management. We overcame significant hurdles such as multi-path head-of-line blocking, network heterogeneity, and rapid link variations, while balancing cost and performance.

To our knowledge, XLINK is the first large-scale experimental study of multi-path QUIC video services in a production environment. Our evaluation, based on over 3 million e-commerce product short-video plays from consumers who upgraded to the Taobao Android app with XLINK, shows that compared to single-path QUIC, XLINK achieved improvements of 19 to 50% in the 99th percentile video-chunk request completion time, 32% in the 99th percentile first-video-frame latency, and 23 to 67% in the re-buffering rate, at the expense of 2.1% redundant traffic.

## 1 Introduction
Video streaming, whether live or on-demand, has become a central component of today’s e-commerce. Ninety-six percent of consumers report that product videos are incredibly helpful in their purchasing decisions [1]. The current COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerated this trend, driving more sellers to create video content on platforms like Alibaba, Amazon, YouTube, and TikTok, and fostering a wave of internet celebrity economies [2].

As one of the world’s leading e-commerce services, we have made two key observations: (1) short-form product video stalls and startup delays significantly impact user satisfaction, and (2) the demand for higher data rates, driven by consumers’ desire for greater detail and engagement, requires more wireless bandwidth and robust data delivery, especially for mobile devices that may experience frequent hand-offs. Multi-path transport, which allows multi-homed devices like smartphones to aggregate wireless links, is a promising solution to meet these needs.

Multi-path transport has gained significant attention over the past few decades [4–8]. The most well-known multi-path protocol is MPTCP, defined in RFC 6824 [4]. However, MPTCP requires OS-level support, making it costly for mobile app providers who are not phone manufacturers [2]. Recently, as the industry moves toward QUIC [10], multi-path extensions over QUIC [7, 11, 12] have been introduced. Unlike TCP, QUIC, being a user-space protocol, can be installed and upgraded as part of the application, enabling rapid and continuous deployment [10]. However, recent proposals [7, 13] were designed for generic traffic and were not optimized for video, and their practical effectiveness remains unclear [14, 15].

In this paper, we explore the feasibility and benefits of applying multi-path QUIC to large-scale video services. We found that directly applying existing multi-path solutions to our large-scale product video services was not straightforward. To justify the incentives, multi-path should achieve at least the same performance as a single path [6, 16]. However, our deployment showed that default multi-path solutions could be 16% slower at the median and 28% slower at the 99th percentile compared to single-path delivery over the better path. Efficiently using aggregated wireless resources proved more challenging than expected, with major hurdles including multi-path head-of-line (MP-HoL) blocking caused by fast-varying and heterogeneous paths [6].

Solutions to MP-HoL blocking include sophisticated packet scheduling algorithms [18–20], but these rely on predictions of network characteristics, which are often inaccurate, especially for wireless links with rapid variations and occasional outages [21]. Other proposals transmit duplicate packets to decouple multi-paths, but this leads to significant traffic redundancy. For instance, traditional re-injection strategies [6] can increase outbound traffic from video servers by more than 15%, making them impractical for large-scale video services.

Given these challenges, we present XLINK, a large-scale experimental study of multi-path QUIC video transport. The key idea behind XLINK is to leverage QUIC's user-space nature and directly use video QoE feedback to control multi-path scheduling and management. Specifically:

- **Dynamic Packet Re-injection:** Instead of predicting network characteristics, XLINK uses client QoE feedback to dynamically control the aggressiveness of packet re-injection in the server's scheduler. This ensures performance and cost-efficiency.
- **Stream and Frame Priority-Based Scheduling:** XLINK is designed to work with multiple concurrent QUIC streams, carefully determining the sending order based on stream urgency and video frame importance to provide a smoother streaming experience.
- **First-Video-Frame Acceleration:** XLINK introduces first-video-frame acceleration with video-frame priority-based re-injection, allowing video applications to differentiate video frame importance and avoid excessive delays during video startup.
- **QoE-Aware Path Management:** XLINK handles large path delay differences in heterogeneous networks with QoE-aware path management, including wireless-aware primary path selection and flexible ACK_MPs routing, enhancing performance.

XLINK achieves superior performance in terms of video startup delays, re-buffering rates, mobility support, and CDN traffic overhead. Additionally, XLINK maintains the security and privacy standards of QUIC, ensuring no additional concerns.

### Contributions
- **First Large-Scale Study:** We present the first large-scale experimental study of multi-path QUIC video transport in a production environment, demonstrating its feasibility and deployability.
- **Leveraging QUIC as a User-Space Protocol:** We highlight the importance of leveraging QUIC's user-space nature to closely interact with applications and use video QoE for scheduling and path management.
- **Practical Challenges and Solutions:** We identify and address practical challenges related to performance, cost, mobility, compatibility, and network heterogeneity, sharing our experiences in overcoming these issues.

### Main Results
We conducted large-scale A/B tests comparing XLINK with single-path QUIC, involving over 100,000 participants who voluntarily upgraded to a test version of the Taobao Android app. Our dataset included over 3 million video plays. The results show that XLINK achieved 19 to 50% improvement in the 99th percentile video-chunk request completion time, 32% improvement in the 99th percentile first-video-frame latency, and 23 to 67% improvement in the re-buffering rate, with only 2.1% redundant traffic. These findings suggest that XLINK is a significant step towards the widespread adoption of multi-path QUIC on the public Internet.

The innovation behind XLINK's use of remote feedback to control multi-path packet re-injection extends beyond end-to-end video delivery and can serve as a general high-performance multi-path transport mechanism. The stream and frame priority-based scheduling leverages QUIC's ability to express video awareness, making it more specific to QUIC.

With the proliferation of video applications and wireless technologies, the traditional one-size-fits-all approach to video and transport optimization will no longer suffice. XLINK, by leveraging the user-space nature of QUIC, pioneers innovations in closer collaboration between video and wireless, paving the way for other exciting research areas such as live streaming, 360-degree videos, augmented reality (AR), and virtual reality (VR).

## 2 Motivation
The development of XLINK is driven by several trends:

- **Short-Form Video Explosion:** Recent years have seen a surge in short-form videos, driven by apps like TikTok, Reels, and Twitter [24]. E-commerce companies, including Alibaba, Amazon, eBay, and Redfin, are shifting to short videos to showcase products in mobile apps. Short videos impose more stringent QoE requirements, as viewers are less tolerant of QoE impairments for short videos than long videos [27]. Meanwhile, consumer demand for high-quality video content, such as 4K and beyond (e.g., AR and VR), is increasing, requiring bit-rates of over 85Mbps [28]. These changes necessitate solutions to overcome spectrum shortages and link instability in wireless connectivity. XLINK offers an easy-to-deploy solution that can benefit billions of users.
