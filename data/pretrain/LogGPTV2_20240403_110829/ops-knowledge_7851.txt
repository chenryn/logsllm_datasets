User: currently I am working on a web app development and I am running my server on an Amazon ec2 instance. I am testing my (web app which uses Flask) by running the server on localhost:5000 as usual. However I don't have access to the gui hence I don't see my app and test it like I would do on a browser. I have a Mac OS X computer so my question is how can I see the localhost of Amazon EC2 from my mac's browser ?
Assistant: You cannot connect to localhost on a remote machine without a proxy. If you want to test it you will need to change the binding to the public IP address or 0.0.0.0.
You will then have to lock down access to your own IP address through the security settings in AWS.
