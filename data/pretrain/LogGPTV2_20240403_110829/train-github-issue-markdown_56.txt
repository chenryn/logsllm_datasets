 **TypeScript Version:**  
1.8.9
React.__spread has been deprecated for a while, and has been removed in 15.0.  
(facebook/react@`a142fd2`)
When upgrading a typescript project to React 0.15, an error is shown that
`React.__spread is not defined` when using spread props.
It looks like it'll be turned into a warning instead
soon(facebook/react@`fc1cfb6`), but it's advisable to migrate tsx
transformations from using `React.__spread` to using `Object.assign`
