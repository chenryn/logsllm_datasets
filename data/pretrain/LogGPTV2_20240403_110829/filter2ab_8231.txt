**ATT&CK ID:** T1048.001  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol

Adversaries may exfiltrate sensitive data by transmitting it over a symmetrically encrypted network protocol that is distinct from the existing command and control (C2) channel. This technique involves using an alternative, non-C2 protocol to encrypt and transfer the data, potentially to a different network location than the primary C2 server. By doing so, adversaries can evade detection and ensure the confidentiality of the exfiltrated information.
