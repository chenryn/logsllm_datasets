User:  Please explain what decorators are in Python, and their usage scenarios and advantages.
Assistant: Decorator is an important programming idea and grammatical feature in Python. It can add some additional functions and behaviors without changing the source code of the original function. The basic grammatical form of a decorator is: @decorator_func, which can be placed above the function definition, which is equivalent to using the function name as a parameter of the decorator function, and at the same time binding the function name to the return value of the decorator function with the same name. Usage scenarios: 1. Add log information or performance statistics functions, such as recording function execution time, number of calls, exception information, etc. 2. Add a cache or control the execution times and calling interval of the function. 3. Check or convert function parameters, such as checking parameter type, value range, legality, etc. 4. Implement authentication and permission control, such as checking whether users have permission to access sensitive interfaces. 5. Realize unified API service access, such as signature verification and anti-crawler measures for API requests. Advantages: 1. Decorators can improve code reusability and maintainability, and encapsulate a certain function into a decorator function, which can be used when calling multiple functions, avoiding code duplication and redundancy. 2. The decorator can avoid modification of the source code of the original function, keep the code clear and concise, and avoid introducing too much nesting and judgment logic. 3. The decorator can flexibly and dynamically modify the function and behavior of the function, such as modifying the log level, controlling the number of function executions, etc. according to different environments or requirements.
