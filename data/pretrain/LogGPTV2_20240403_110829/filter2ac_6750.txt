### Title: BlackHat US-19: Chip.Fail - Glitching the Silicon of the Connected World

In the realm of smart devices, from automobiles to Internet of Things (IoT) gadgets, processors form the core of their functionality. However, these processors are often overlooked in the threat modeling process during product design. There is an implicit trust that they function as intended and that the security features listed in their data sheets are reliable. This oversight is particularly concerning when these processors are used in security-critical applications such as bitcoin wallets, automotive systems, or authentication tokens.

In this presentation, we will explore the use of fault injection attacks to compromise some of the most popular IoT processors. We will demonstrate how these attacks can be executed with equipment costing less than $100 USD. Additionally, we will release both software and hardware tools to facilitate these attacks, providing a deeper understanding of the vulnerabilities present in these critical components.
