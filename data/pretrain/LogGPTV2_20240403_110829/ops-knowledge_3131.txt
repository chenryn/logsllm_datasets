User: I have a python script and am wondering is there any way that I can ensure that the script run's continuously on a remote computer? Like for example, if the script crashes for whatever reason, is there a way to start it up automatically instead of having to remote desktop. Are there any other factors I have to be aware of? The script will be running on a window's machine.
Assistant: Many ways - In the case of windows, even a simple looping batch file would probably do - just have it start the script in a loop (whenever it crashes it would return to the shell and be restarted).
