## Abstract
In distributed reflective denial-of-service (DRDoS) attacks, adversaries send requests to public servers (e.g., open recursive DNS resolvers) and spoof the IP address of a victim. These servers, in turn, flood the victim with valid responses, unknowingly exhausting the victim's bandwidth. Recently, attackers have launched DRDoS attacks with bandwidths exceeding hundreds of Gb/s. While this technique is well-known for protocols like DNS, it is unclear whether other protocols are equally or more vulnerable.

This paper revisits popular UDP-based protocols used in network services, online games, P2P file-sharing networks, and P2P botnets to assess their security against DRDoS abuse. We find that 14 protocols are susceptible to bandwidth amplification, with traffic multiplication factors up to 4670. In the worst case, attackers need only 0.02% of the bandwidth they intend to direct at their victim, enabling far more dangerous attacks than previously known. Additionally, we identify millions of public hosts that can be abused as amplifiers.

We then analyze over 130 real-world DRDoS attacks by announcing bait services to monitor abuse and analyzing darknet and ISP network traffic. Our analysis shows that attackers are already abusing protocols beyond DNS, such as CharGen, SNMP, and Quake 3. Finally, we evaluate countermeasures against DRDoS attacks, including preventing IP spoofing and hardening protocols and service configurations. We demonstrate that poorly-designed rate limiting and packet-based filtering techniques may fail to mitigate carefully-crafted DRDoS attacks.

## 1. Introduction
Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks aim to disrupt a victim's service by overwhelming it with excessive load. Distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks, where multiple infected devices (botnets) are instructed to target a victim, are a common form of DoS. Attackers can also exhaust application-layer resources, such as the maximum number of database sessions in a web application.

In distributed reflective denial-of-service (DRDoS) attacks, an adversary aims to exhaust the victim's bandwidth by exploiting public servers of UDP-based network protocols. These servers respond to requests without validating the sender's identity, allowing the attacker to spoof the victim's IP address. DRDoS offers several advantages to attackers:
- **Anonymity:** Victims receive backscatter traffic from amplifiers, disguising the attacker's identity.
- **Highly-distributed attacks:** Multiple amplifiers can be abused simultaneously, making the attack difficult to trace.
- **Amplification:** The reflected traffic is significantly larger in bandwidth than the traffic the attacker sends to the amplifiers.

Recent DRDoS attacks have been particularly severe. For example, in May 2012, a 167 Gb/s DRDoS attack targeted a real-time financial exchange platform [15]. In March 2013, Spamhaus.org was hit by a 300 Gb/s DRDoS attack [16]. In August 2013, a 100 Gb/s DRDoS attack brought down GreenNet, an ISP hosting human rights groups [36]. These attacks primarily exploited open DNS resolvers, which amplify traffic due to the large response sizes, especially with EDNS0 and DNSSEC [5].

While DNS has been hardened against abuse, little is known about the vulnerabilities of other widely-deployed protocols. This paper evaluates the susceptibility of 14 UDP-based protocols to DRDoS attacks, identifies potential amplifiers, and proposes methods to detect and mitigate these attacks.

## 2. Threat Model
Our threat model focuses on distributed and reflective denial-of-service (DRDoS) attacks, where an attacker (A) aims to consume the available bandwidth of a victim (V). The attacker uses systems (amplifiers) to reflect and amplify the attack traffic, rather than sending it directly. The victim is any Internet-connected host, typically identified by a single IPv4 address.

### Key Assumptions:
- **IP Spoofing:** The attacker can send IP packets with spoofed source addresses. Despite efforts to prevent IP spoofing, many Autonomous Systems still allow it [1].
- **Protocol Knowledge:** The attacker knows at least one UDP-based protocol (P) for which they can craft requests that a server will answer. The attacker can obtain a set of amplifiers (MP) that respond to valid requests of protocol P.
- **No Control Over Amplifiers:** The attacker cannot control or configure the amplifiers, only use the services offered to anyone.

Figure 1 illustrates our threat model. The attacker sends small requests to amplifiers, specifying the victim's IP address as the source. The amplifiers, in turn, send large responses to the victim, causing bandwidth congestion.

## 3. Amplification Vulnerabilities
In DRDoS attacks, two main factors determine the impact:
1. **Amplification Factor:** The ratio of the size of the response to the size of the request.
2. **Number of Amplifiers:** The total number of amplifiers and their aggregated bandwidth.

### Protocol Overview
We analyzed 14 popular UDP-based protocols, categorizing them into five groups:

| **Category** | **Protocol** | **Port(s)** | **Description** |
|--------------|--------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Network Services** | NTP | 123 | Time synchronization |
|                | DNS | 53 | Domain name resolution |
|                | NetBios | 137 | Name service protocol of NetBios API |
|                | SSDP | 1900 | Discovery of UPnP-enabled hosts |
| **Legacy Protocols** | CharGen | 19 | Legacy character generation protocol |
|                | QOTD | 17 | Legacy "Quote-of-the-day" protocol |
| **P2P File Sharing** | BitTorrent | any | BitTorrent’s Kademlia DHT implementation |
|                | Kad | any | eMule’s Kademlia DHT implementation |
| **Multiplayer Games** | Quake 3 | 27960 | Games using the Quake 3 engine |
|                | Steam | 27015 | Games using the Steam protocol |
| **P2P Botnets** | ZAv2 | 164XY | P2P-based rootkit |
|                | Sality | any | P2P-based malware dropper |
|                | Gameover | any | P2P-based banking trojan |

These protocols are attractive to attackers because small requests can lead to large responses, and IP address spoofing is possible due to the lack of a proper handshake. TCP-based protocols are excluded from our analysis as they do not easily allow for amplification.

## 4. Real-World Attacks
To understand if attackers are abusing these vulnerable protocols, we employed a three-fold approach:
1. **Bait Services:** Deployed and monitored bait services for the protocols to detect abuse.
2. **Scanning Noise Analysis:** Analyzed scanning noise from two darknets to identify potential amplifier scans.
3. **Traffic Analysis:** Developed a lightweight method to detect DRDoS attacks via traffic analysis and deployed it at a large ISP.

Our evaluation of over 130 real-world DRDoS attacks shows that while DNS remains the most popular protocol, other protocols like CharGen, SNMP, and Quake 3 are also being abused.

## 5. Countermeasures
We evaluated various countermeasures against DRDoS attacks, including:
- **Preventing IP Spoofing:** Implementing strict egress filtering to prevent IP spoofing.
- **Hardening Protocols:** Modifying protocols to reduce the size of responses or require authentication.
- **Rate Limiting:** Implementing rate limiting on amplifiers to restrict the number of requests they can handle.

However, we found that poorly-designed rate limiting and packet-based filtering techniques may fail to mitigate carefully-crafted DRDoS attacks. We discuss how future protocols and implementations can be designed to be more resilient to DRDoS attacks.

## 6. Contributions
Our contributions include:
1. **Discovery of 14 Vulnerable Protocols:** Identified 14 network protocols that can be abused to launch DRDoS attacks, with amplification factors up to 4670.
2. **Detection Methods:** Proposed methods to detect real-world DRDoS attacks, including bait services and traffic analysis.
3. **Countermeasure Evaluation:** Described and evaluated DRDoS countermeasures, providing insights into effective and ineffective mitigation strategies.

## 7. Conclusion
This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of UDP-based protocols' vulnerability to DRDoS attacks. We identified 14 protocols that can be abused, with significant amplification factors. We also proposed and evaluated methods to detect and mitigate these attacks. As the threat landscape evolves, it is crucial to continuously reassess and improve the security of network protocols and their implementations.
