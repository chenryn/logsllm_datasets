# Analysis of AS Link Heterogeneity and Traffic Patterns at Internet Exchange Points (IXPs)

## Introduction
The study examines the traffic patterns and heterogeneity in peering links at a major European IXP, focusing on the deployment and usage of servers by content delivery networks (CDNs) like Akamai and Cloudflare. The analysis reveals significant deviations from traditional assumptions about how CDN traffic is handled, highlighting the importance of understanding the diverse ways in which CDNs deploy their infrastructure.

## Methodology
### Data Collection
- **Vantage Point**: One of the largest European IXPs.
- **Data Source**: sFlow records, providing a weekly pool of approximately 230 million IP addresses.
- **Server Identification**: Extracted approximately 1.5 million server IPs from the data.

### Data Analysis
- **Grouping Servers**: Grouped servers by organizations using publicly available data, inspired by earlier studies [20, 48].
- **Traffic Analysis**: Analyzed the percentage of CDN traffic on direct peering links versus other member links.

## Results

### Akamai Traffic Analysis
- **Figure 7(b)**: Shows the percentage of Akamai traffic on the direct peering link to Akamai (x-axis) versus the percentage of total Akamai-server traffic for each IXP member (y-axis).
- **Key Observations**:
  - **Traditional Assumption**: All dots would be stacked at x=100, indicating all Akamai traffic is on direct peering links.
  - **Reality**: Dots are scattered, indicating that some members receive all their Akamai-related traffic from non-Akamai ASes (x=0), even when the traffic is significant (y>>0).
  - **Quantitative Insight**: Akamai sends 11.1% of its traffic via non-IXP member links, and traffic from more than 15K out of 28K identified Akamai servers is seen via non-IXP member links.

### Cloudflare Traffic Analysis
- **Figure 7(c)**: Similar plot for Cloudflare, showing similar usage patterns despite different business models (Akamai deploys servers inside ISPs, while Cloudflare operates its own data centers).

### Other Services
- **Amazon CloudFront**: Almost all traffic is sent via the IXPâ€™s Amazon links.
- **Amazon EC2**: A significant fraction of traffic comes via other IXP peering links.
- **Peak Times**: During peak times, the percentage of traffic on non-IXP member links increases, possibly due to load balancing, performance improvement, or cost savings.

## Discussion

### Implications
- **Network Heterogenization**: Increasingly, CDNs and other Internet players are deploying servers in third-party ASes, leading to more heterogeneous network infrastructures.
- **Challenges in Attribution**: The findings highlight the challenges in attributing the right traffic to the right party, as traditional AS-level views do not capture the full picture of how network infrastructures are used and deployed.

### Comparison with Prior Work
- **Prior Studies**: Previous work has focused on specific companies (e.g., Akamai, YouTube, Netflix) or inferred web hosting infrastructures based on content alone.
- **Unique Approach**: This study uses a large European IXP as a vantage point and relies on publicly available data to group servers by organization, providing a more comprehensive and generalizable methodology.

### Future Directions
- **Fusion of Data**: The need to fuse IXP-internal and IXP-external data to obtain a more accurate and detailed picture of the global network and its constituents.
- **Open Research Problem**: How to appropriately integrate selective IXP-external data with IXP-internal measurements to achieve unprecedented accuracy and insight into the global network.

## Conclusion
The study contributes to Internet measurements by revealing the existence of single, well-localized physical locations where one can observe much of the global Internet. The observed trend towards increasingly heterogeneous networks and diverse usage of IXP peering links is expected to accelerate, driven by economic incentives and the growing importance of cloud providers. The paper also advances a new mental model for the Internet's ecosystem, accounting for the observed network heterogenization and providing a rich and flexible framework for future research.
