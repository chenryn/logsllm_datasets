# Bug report
**What is the current behavior?**
When compiling typescript using ts-loader with webpack, the `library` variable
is not hoisted to the global level, thereby not exposing it at all.
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**
MWE at https://github.com/retorquere/webpack-mwe
With webpack 5.21.2, `var MyModule =` is declared at the top of the webpacked
output; with 5.24.4, it is declared inside the IIFE and thus not available at
the global level.
**What is the expected behavior?**
that the variable in `output.library` is declared in a way that it is
available at the global level
**Other relevant information:**  
webpack version: 5.21.2 vs 5.24.4
