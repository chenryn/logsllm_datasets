### Organizational Change Management (OCM) Lifecycle Management

#### 2.1 OCM Lifecycle Management

**2.1.1 Inputs**

To effectively manage the OCM Lifecycle during the Initiating Process Phase, the OCM Practitioner must have a comprehensive understanding of the following inputs:

- **Business Need:** The business need drives the direction of the change initiative and defines how the organization, its groups, and its people will be affected.
- **Environmental Readiness Assessment:** This assessment, completed in the Concept Process Phase, provides guidance to identify the OCM priority areas with the highest need. These areas include:
  - Organizational Readiness
  - Leadership Readiness
  - Employee Readiness
  - Supporting Infrastructure Readiness
- **Change Magnitude Assessment:** This assessment helps the OCM Practitioner understand the organization and the change, tailoring OCM efforts to the specific needs of the organization.

**2.1.2 Roles**

The following roles and their associated responsibilities are involved in OCM Lifecycle Management activities during the Initiating Process Phase:

- **OCM Practitioner:**
  - Analyze the completed Environmental Readiness Assessment.
  - Collaborate with the Project Sponsor to obtain inputs for addressing OCM priorities.
  - Identify activities to address OCM priorities and develop the OCM Schedule.
- **Project Sponsor:**
  - Collaborate with the OCM Practitioner to provide inputs for addressing OCM priorities.
  - Provide guidance on the workability of proposed activities.
  - Sign off on OCM efforts.
  - Assist with communicating the OCM effort to project stakeholders.
- **Project Manager:**
  - Oversee and provide project management for the OCM work effort.
- **Stakeholders:**
  - Collaborate with the OCM Practitioner to provide inputs for addressing OCM priorities and develop the OCM Schedule.

**2.1.3 Activities**

OCM Lifecycle Management in the Initiating Process Phase focuses on developing an OCM Schedule tailored to the specific needs identified in the Concept Process Phase. The key activity is:

- **Develop the OCM Schedule:**
  - The OCM Practitioner identifies and prepares for OCM activities to be conducted during the Planning Process Phase by developing the OCM Schedule.
  - The OCM Practitioner should work with the Project Manager and leverage existing project schedules as necessary.
  - The OCM Practitioner can determine a course of action to address the OCM priorities by completing three separate tasks:
    - Identify activities to address OCM priorities.
    - Determine and schedule OCM activities.
    - Determine how to monitor OCM activities.

**Identify Activities to Address OCM Priorities:**

- The first step in developing the OCM Schedule is to determine the activities that will best address the OCM priorities for the project.
- Based on the results of the Change Magnitude Assessment and Environmental Readiness Assessment, the OCM Practitioner identifies the environmental areas that are deficient or are risks for the organization, also called the OCM priority areas.
- The OCM Practitioner then determines which activities will best address their organizationâ€™s specific priorities.

**Sample OCM Mitigation Activities:**

- **Organizational Readiness:**
  - If the project is not a top priority for the organization, the OCM Practitioner may work with the Project Sponsor to develop facilitated sessions with key stakeholders to discuss the business need and project priorities, develop a common understanding of the need for change, and gain commitment to the project and project outcomes.
  - The OCM Practitioner may gather and review lessons learned from previous changes and provide suggestions for incorporation.

- **Leadership Readiness:**
  - If the project is not a top priority for leadership, the OCM Practitioner may work with the Project Sponsor to develop facilitated sessions with key executive leaders to discuss the business need and project priorities, develop a common understanding of the need for change, and gain commitment to the project and project outcomes.
  - The OCM Practitioner may utilize coaching sessions with identified leaders to stress the importance of open communication and provide tools and techniques to facilitate communication and trust building.

- **Employee Readiness:**
  - If employees are fatigued from other change initiatives, the OCM Practitioner may organize an all-staff meeting where key executives build excitement for the change.

- **Supporting Infrastructure Readiness:**
  - If employees do not have access to the necessary training and skill development, the OCM Practitioner should ensure that the training needs are clearly identified and documented for the project team during the Planning Process Phase.
  - The OCM Practitioner should work with the Project Manager and the project team to ensure that the business case is clearly and visibly aligned with people, processes, and strategies as they relate to the change initiative.

**Schedule OCM Activities:**

- The OCM Practitioner should continue to work with the Project Manager as necessary to develop the schedule of OCM activities needed for implementation.
- The schedule of activities may span between the Initiating and Planning Process Phases but should be developed and acted on early and frequently enough to address the needs of the organization.
- The OCM Practitioner should consider the availability of resources, the availability of target individuals, and the frequency of activities based on the degree of deficiency within each priority area.

**Determine How to Monitor and Control Activities:**

- The OCM Practitioner will need to determine the best way to assess and track progress and issues as the OCM effort moves forward in conjunction with project management activities.
- Potential effectiveness measuring strategies may include feedback surveys, informal feedback and observation, and feedback drop boxes.

### 2.2 Leadership Support

**2.2.1 Overview**

Leadership Support began in the Concept Process Phase with the identification or selection of a Project Sponsor. To maintain an influential Project Sponsor, the OCM Practitioner engages him/her during the Initiating Process Phase to obtain commitment to this critical project role. Additionally, the OCM Practitioner identifies and engages other relevant executive leaders during this process phase to ensure that they provide support for the change initiative. Overall, Leadership Support serves to continually broaden the group of supportive leaders.
