2.1.1 Inputs
In order to complete the Initiating Process Phase OCM Lifecycle Management 
activities,  the  OCM  Practitioner  will  need  a  thorough  understanding  of  the 
following inputs:
Business Need: The business need drives the direction of the change initiative 
and defines how the organization, its groups, and its people will be affected.
Environmental  Readiness  Assessment:  The  completed  Environmental 
Readiness  Assessment,  completed  by  the  OCM  Practitioner  in  the  Concept 
Process  Phase,  provides  guidance  for  the  OCM  Practitioner  to  identify  the 
OCM priority areas with the highest need. The four areas are: Organizational 
Readiness,  Leadership  Readiness,  Employee  Readiness,  and  Supporting 
Infrastructure Readiness.

2.1.3 Activities
OCM  Lifecycle  Management  in  the  Initiating  Process  Phase  focuses  on  the 
OCM efforts required to address the OCM priorities identified in the Concept 
Process Phase. The OCM Lifecycle Management activity and associated tasks 
in Initiating serve to develop an OCM Schedule tailored to the specific needs 
identified in the Concept Process Phase.
Develop the OCM Schedule
The OCM Practitioner identifies and prepares for OCM activities to be conducted 
during the Planning Process Phase by developing the OCM Schedule. The OCM 
Practitioner should work with the Project Manager and leverage existing project 
schedules as necessary. Then the OCM Practitioner can determine a course of 
action to address the OCM priorities by completing three separate tasks:
Skills
Use the following skills to 
complete the activity:
•  Project Management
•  Strategic Thinking
•  Teamwork
•  Problem Solving
•  Identify activities to address OCM priorities
•  Determine and schedule OCM activities
•  Determine how to monitor OCM activities
Identify Activities to Address OCM Priorities
The first step in developing the OCM Schedule is to determine the activities that 
will best address the OCM priorities for the project. Based on the results of the 
Change Magnitude Assessment and Environmental Readiness Assessment, both 
completed  in  the  Concept  Process  Phase,  the  OCM  Practitioner  identified  the 
environmental areas that are deficient or are risks for the organization, also called 
the OCM priority areas. The OCM Practitioner then determines which activities 
will best address their organization’s specific priorities. Examples of underlying 
issues and mitigation strategies are listed on the next page; however, this is not a 
comprehensive list.
The OCM Practitioner should use his/her knowledge, experience, and judgment 
in regards to the organization, business need, and potential change to determine 
other  mitigating  activities  that  may  be  successful  in  the  organization  at  this 
time.  The  activities  identified  may  be  implemented  in  this  process  phase  and 
continue into the Planning Process Phase. In addition to activities identified and 
scheduled now, the OCM Practitioner will continue to introduce new activities in 
future process phases as the need arises. The OCM Practitioner may consider the

following questions when determining the type and frequency of activities in the 
Concept Process Phase:
•  What is the relative size of population that the change impacts?
•  What population will be addressed by activities in specific priority areas 
(leaders, all affected staff, project team, etc.)?
•  Are there any scheduling constraints (time, geographic location, etc.)?
•  Which resource is best suited for conducting activities (OCM Practitioner, 
Project Sponsor, etc.)?
The OCM Practitioner must utilize strategic thinking and problem solving skills 
to work through all of the identified priority areas.

The organization 
does not effectively

strategies to 
deliver timely and 
measurable results
The OCM Practitioner should 
ensure that the training needs 
are clearly identified and 
documented for the project 
team during the Planning 
Process Phase 
The OCM Practitioner should 
work with the Project Manager 
and the project team to 
ensure that the business case 
is clearly and visibly aligned 
with people, processes, and 
strategies as they relate to the 
change initiative
After the mitigating strategies to address the OCM priority areas are identified, 
the  OCM  Practitioner  should  return  to  the  Change  Magnitude  Assessment  to 
complete  the  remaining  sections  if  not  done  already.  The  OCM  Practitioner 
identified  the  relative  size  of  the  change  and  the  organization’s  overall  level 
of  readiness  in  the  Concept  Process  Phase.  After  reviewing  specific  priority 
areas and determining a course of action for addressing these areas, the OCM 
Practitioner should record the specific areas and mitigating activities on the 
Change Magnitude Assessment. This working document provides a high level 
overview that the OCM Practitioner can refer to when discussing the direction of 
the OCM effort with the Project Sponsor, Project Manager, or other individuals.

Schedule OCM Activities
The  OCM  Practitioner  should  continue  to  work  with  the  Project  Manager  as 
necessary to develop the schedule of OCM activities needed for implementation. 
The schedule of activities may span between the Initiating and Planning Process 
Phases, but should be developed and acted on early and frequently enough to

address the needs of the organization. The OCM Practitioner should consider 
the following when developing the schedule:
•  Availability of resources to execute the activities
•  Availability of the target individuals to participate  
(e.g., Project Sponsor, executives)
•  Frequency of activities based on the degree of deficiency within each 
priority area 
The OCM Practitioner will use the identified activities, resources, and timing to 
create the OCM Schedule that is incorporated into the overall project schedule, 
if one exists. This schedule is meant to be a living document that assists the 
OCM Practitioner in organizing resources, completing the identified activities, 
and monitoring the progress of the OCM effort. The OCM Practitioner should 
maintain the schedule in conjunction with the Project Manager and review and 
revise it on a regular basis throughout all remaining process phases. The OCM 
effort will expand to include activities in all knowledge areas within Planning 
and Executing, which the OCM Practitioner will need to identify and address 
within the OCM Schedule.
Determine How to Monitor and Control Activities
The OCM Practitioner will need to determine the best way to assess and track 
progress  and  issues  as  the  OCM  effort  moves  forward  in  conjunction  with
project management activities. The OCM Practitioner should not only monitor 
the progress to completion, but also control the activities by measuring their 
effectiveness.  Measuring  the  effectiveness  of  OCM  activities  is  conducted  by 
observing  the  overall  environment  and  gathering  feedback  from  the  project 
team, leaders, and Stakeholders. Potential effectiveness measuring strategies 
may include:
•  Feedback  Surveys:  Surveys  help  to  gather  and  sort  feedback  from  large 
pools  of  respondents.  Surveys  can  be  distributed  electronically  or  in  hard 
copy form, and may be given multiple times throughout the project lifecycle 
in order to gauge the effectiveness of ongoing activities and support. 
•  Informal  Feedback  and  Observation:  The  OCM  Practitioner  can  rate 
effectiveness through informal conversations and observations as he/she 
works within the organization. How are Stakeholders reacting to activities? 
Is the general atmosphere a positive one? What questions and concerns is 
the OCM Practitioner hearing?

•  Feedback  Drop  Box:  This  tool  allows  Stakeholders  to  leave  feedback 
when desired. The box can be virtual or tangible and can be used to collect 
information on Stakeholder questions, thoughts, concerns, and feelings. 
The OCM Practitioner will also need to determine the best way to communicate 
activity and task progress, feedback, and modifications to the Project Manager, 
project team, and any other resources that own the action.

Leadership Support began in the Concept Process Phase with the identification 
or  selection  of  a  Project  Sponsor.  In  order  to  maintain  an  influential  Project 
Sponsor, the OCM Practitioner engages him/her during the Initiating Process 
Phase to obtain commitment to this critical project role, as shown in Figure 
2-3.  In  addition,  the  OCM  Practititoner  identifies  and  engages  other  relevant 
executive leaders during this process phase to ensure that they provide support 
for  the  change  initiative.  Overall,  Leadership  Support  serves  to  continually 
broaden the group of supportive leaders.
