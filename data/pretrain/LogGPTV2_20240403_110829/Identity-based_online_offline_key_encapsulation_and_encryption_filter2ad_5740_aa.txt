ABSTRACT
An identity-based online/o(cid:15)ine encryption (IBOOE) scheme
splits the encryption process into two phases. The (cid:12)rst phase
performs most of the heavy computations, such as modu-
lar exponentiation or pairing over points on elliptic curve.
The knowledge of the plaintext or the receiver’s identity is
not required until the second phase, where the ciphertex-
t is produced by only light computations, such as integer
addition/multiplication or hashing. This division of compu-
tations makes encryption a(cid:11)ordable by devices with limited
computation power since the preparation works can be ex-
ecuted \o(cid:15)ine" or possibly by some powerful devices. The
identity-based (ID-based) nature of the scheme also allows
the preparation of ciphertext without certi(cid:12)cate veri(cid:12)cation.
Since e(cid:14)ciency is the main concern, less burden in the
computation requirements of all phases (i.e., both phases of
encryption and the decryption phase) and smaller ciphertext
size are desirable. In this paper, we propose new schemes
with improved e(cid:14)ciency over previous schemes by assum-
ing random oracles. Our (cid:12)rst construction is a very e(cid:14)-
cient scheme secure against chosen-plaintext attack (CPA),
which is just slightly modi(cid:12)ed from an existing scheme. We
then proceed to propose a new notion called ID-based On-
line/O(cid:15)ine KEM (IBOOKEM) that allows the key encap-
sulation process to be split into o(cid:15)ine and online stages, in
the same way as IBOOE does. We also present a generic
transformation to get security against chosen-ciphertext at-
tack (CCA) for IBOOE from any IBOOKEM scheme with
one-wayness only. Our schemes (both CPA and CCA) are
the most e(cid:14)cient one in the state-of-the-art, in terms of
online computation and ciphertext size, which are the two
main focuses of online/o(cid:15)ine schemes. Our schemes are
very suitable to be deployed on embedded devices such as
smartcard or wireless sensor which have very limited com-
putation powers and the communication bandwidth is very

INTRODUCTION
The notion of online/o(cid:15)ine cryptographic algorithm was
(cid:12)rst introduced by Even, Goldreich and Micali [17, 18], in
the context of digital signature. With this notion, the sign-
ing process can be divided into two phases. The (cid:12)rst phase
is called o(cid:15)ine phase which is executed prior to knowing
the message to be signed and the second phase is called on-
line phase which is performed after knowing the message.
The online phase should be very fast and require only very
light computation, such as integer multiplication or hashing.
Other heavier computations such as modular exponentiation
should be avoided in the online phase. Online/o(cid:15)ine cryp-
tographic schemes are thus particularly useful for low-power
devices such as smartcards or wireless sensors. It may take
a very long time, if not impossible, for these devices to ex-
ecute heavy cryptographic computation. With this notion,
these heavy computations can be done in the o(cid:15)ine phase
which can be carried out by other powerful devices instead.
1.1 Related Work
Several online/o(cid:15)ine signature schemes [30, 16, 22, 9, 7,
21, 23] were proposed since the work of Even et al. in 1989.
However, the (cid:12)rst online/o(cid:15)ine encryption scheme was pro-
posed by Guo, Mu and Chen [20] nearly after two decades.
One possible reason for this gap lies in how the public key
is associated with the cryptographic object. A signature is
bound to the signer’s public key, which is obviously known
to the signer; while there are many possibilities for the re-
cipient’s public key in encryption. It seems challenging to
bundle the ciphertext with a public key by only \cheap" op-
erations. Guo et al. did not directly tackle this challenge
since their scheme were proposed in the context of identity-
based encryption. The di(cid:11)erence is that the ciphertext is
addressed to an identity but not a public key. The o(cid:15)ine
phase of their schemes can be carried out without knowing
the identity of the recipient.
Many identity-based encryption schemes involve pairing
operation which is relatively expensive when compared with
other operations such as modular exponentiation. One pos-
sible approach to speed up these schemes is to outsource the
computation of pairing (e.g., [31, 13]) to a more powerful
device when the pairing operations induce a signi(cid:12)cant over-
head. While this is a possible approach, there exist schemes
which the pairing operation in the encryption process can be
pre-computed, such as the one proposed by Sakai and Kasa-
hara [26]. For this class of schemes, online/o(cid:15)ine technique
maybe more promising.
1.2 Motivations
We believe that identity-based (ID-based) online/o(cid:15)ine
encryption is worthy to be studied, from both the practical
perspective and the cryptographic design perspective.
1.2.1 Application.
First, ID-based system is particularly suitable for power-
constrained devices. In an ID-based cryptosystem, encryp-
tion is done with respect to an arbitrary string correspond-
ing to an identity (e.g., an email address, a device identi(cid:12)er).
Only the entity who is \certi(cid:12)ed" by a trusted key genera-
tion center (KGC) will receive a private key for an identity
string. This property gives the original motivation of ID-
based cryptosystem [29], which is to eliminate the necessity
for checking the validity of certi(cid:12)cates in traditional public
key infrastructure (PKI). One only needs to know the recip-
ient’s identity in order to encrypt a message. It avoids the
complicated and costly certi(cid:12)cate (chain) veri(cid:12)cation for the
authentication purpose, which is equivalent to at least two
signature veri(cid:12)cations in PKI-based encryption1.
Consider a wireless sensor network (WSN) scenario, in
which the sensors are collecting sensitive data which is neces-
sary to be encrypted before sending back to the base station-
s. To ensure timely and e(cid:14)cient delivery of sensitive infor-
mation, online/o(cid:15)ine encryption is a handy tool. It would
be much better if part of the encryption process could be
done prior to knowing the data to be encrypted and the re-
cipient’s public key or identity. The o(cid:15)ine part (containing
all heavy computations) can be done by a powerful device
at the setup or manufacturing stage, which (cid:12)ts exactly with
the o(cid:15)ine stage of the online/o(cid:15)ine encryption paradigm
since (obviously) no data is collected and the identity of the
base station maybe still unknown to the wireless sensor at
this stage. Using an ID-based system, when there is a new
node added to the network, other nodes do not need to have
its certi(cid:12)cate veri(cid:12)ed in order to communicate in a secure
way. This can greatly reduce communication overhead and
computation cost.
1It may cost less than two signature veri(cid:12)cation for certi(cid:12)ed
encryption [2], but the speci(cid:12)c construction provided in [2]
does not support o(cid:15)ine preprocessing, speci(cid:12)cally, all the
exponentiations involved require the knowledge of the mes-
sage to be encrypted and the identity and the public key of
the recipient.
1.2.2 Cryptographic Challenge.
The de facto security standard of encryption scheme is in-
distinguishability against adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack
(CCA), in which the adversary can ask for the decryption
of many ciphertexts except the one it is challenged with.
When it comes to online/o(cid:15)ine encryption, the division of
the encryption algorithm into two stages may introduce vul-
nerability. Indeed, we found out that [10] a scheme recently
proposed [24] is actually vulnerable to CCA attack2.
There exist generic transformations (e.g.
[19]) for build-
ing a CCA-secure scheme from a weaker one (e.g., with
one-wayness). Due to the assumption of random oracle,
these CCA-transformations are actually very e(cid:14)cient, in the
sense that not much computational overhead is introduced
to the underlying weaker scheme. However, they are not
\online/o(cid:15)ine"-aware, i.e., the most expensive part of the
encryption can only be done with the knowledge of the re-
cipient and the message.
One may also consider using hybrid encryption to get an
ID-based online/o(cid:15)ine encryption scheme. Speci(cid:12)cally, a
key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) is (cid:12)rstly used to derive
a session key, then a data encapsulation mechanism (DEM)
is used to encrypt the message using the session key pro-
duced by the KEM. An obvious requirement that it is pos-
sible to divide the KEM into o(cid:15)ine stage and inexpensive
online stage, which is not formally studied in the ID-based
setting. Moreover, a generic transformation borrowing a
similar concept for getting CCA security [25] require the
underlying building block to support plaintext-check, which
possibly translates to a strengthening of the underlying as-
sumption. In particular, the security reduction requires that
a certain class of computational problem remains hard even
given the access of the corresponding decisional oracle. This
may render the security proof unfalsi(cid:12)able, and possibly one
may want to deploy the resulting online/o(cid:15)ine system with
a larger security parameter which leads to a lower oper-
ational e(cid:14)ciency.
Ideally, it is desirable to enjoy the on-
line/o(cid:15)ine feature without a(cid:11)ecting the underlying scheme
too much.
Finally, we remark that one can transform an ℓ-level hier-
archical IBE (HIBE) to an (ℓ − 1)-level CCA-secure HIBE
using a strong one-time signature (OTS) [5]. However, our
concern here is e(cid:14)ciency, and the involvement of an \extra"
level in HIBE certainly degrades it, not to mention that the
signing algorithm of the OTS scheme can only be done in
the online stage. To conclude, an e(cid:14)cient way to get CCA
security which preserves the online/o(cid:15)ine property of the
underlying scheme is lacking.
1.3 Contribution
Our contribution is in two folds. First, we propose two
e(cid:14)cient identity-based online/o(cid:15)ine encryption (IBOOE)
schemes. One is very e(cid:14)cient with CPA security while the
another one achieves the de facto CCA security. Both our
schemes come with security analysis in the random oracle
model.
As far as the authors know, there are only four IBOOE
schemes in the literature. The (cid:12)rst two were proposed by
Guo et al.
[20]. Although they satisfy the basic require-
2The authors of [24] have reported the CCA attack discov-
ered in [10] and the corresponding (cid:12)x in the presentation in
ACNS 2009. The weakness of [24] is recently made explicit
in [28].
53
ments, they are not very e(cid:14)cient. The (cid:12)rst scheme (denot-
ed by GMC BB ) requires at least 7 pairings to decrypt and
the second scheme (denoted by GMC G ) produces very large
(more than 6400 bits) ciphertext. Liu and Zhou [24] (denot-
ed by LZ) proposed another IBOOE scheme in the random
oracle model. Although the authors claimed that the scheme
provides CCA security, it is later found that the scheme is
actually CPA secure only [10, 28]. Recently Chu et al. [14]
(denoted by CLZBD) also proposed another IBOOE scheme
in the selective ID model.
When compared to all previous schemes, our schemes out-
perform in terms of e(cid:14)ciency. The online computation is the
critical factor for IBOOE. Both our schemes only require 1
modular computation in the online stage, which are at least
50% faster than other schemes. For ciphertext size, the ci-
phertext of our CPA scheme is only 640 bits while that of
our CCA scheme is just 800 bits, which is 30% smaller than
CLZBD, 3 times small than GMC BB or 8 times smaller than
GMC G . Moreover, both our schemes require only 1 pair-
ings in decryption, which is the minimum among all (non-
online/o(cid:15)ine) e(cid:14)cient identity-based encryption schemes.
Another desirable feature of our schemes is that they work
with the setup of the non-online/o(cid:15)ine version (in contrast
to LZ). Both the administrator and the users of a deployed
system does not need to re-setup the whole system and is-
sues new keys to all users to use our online/o(cid:15)ine algo-
rithms. Our scheme is based on the identity-based encryp-
tion scheme proposed by Sakai and Kasahara [26], which
requires no pairing operation in encryption as we previously
mentioned. Moreover, their scheme is one of the few exist-
ing schemes which achieves anonymous-ciphertext indistin-
guishability against KGC attack [11, 12].
Second, we propose a new notion called Identity-Based
Online/O(cid:15)ine KEM (IBOOKEM) which parallelizes the
concept of IBOOE in a way that it splits the process of
key encapsulation into o(cid:15)ine and online stage. Similar to
IBOOE, the receiver identity is not required in the o(cid:15)ine
stage. We provide an e(cid:14)cient instantiation of IBOOKEM
and present a generic transformation from any IBOOKEM
with one-wayness to CCA-secure IBOOE. Our CCA-secure
IBOOE scheme is the result of this e(cid:14)cient transformation.
The security of the transformation is argued in the random
oracle model.
1.4 Organization
Some de(cid:12)nitions will be given in Section 2. We present
our CPA scheme in Section 3. Next we introduce the new
notion of IBOOKEM and give an instantiation and a generic
transformation to CCA-secure IBOOE in Section 4.
It is
followed by the detailed comparison between our schemes
and other schemes in Section 5. Finally we conclude the
paper in Section 6.

2.1 Pairings and Difﬁe-Hellman Inversion
Let G be an addictive cyclic group and GT be a multi-
plicative cyclic group, both of prime order q. Let P be a
generator of G. We de(cid:12)ne ^e : G × G → GT to be a bilinear
pairing if it has the following properties:
1. Bilinearity: For all U, V ∈ G, and a, b ∈ Z, ^e(aU, bV ) =
^e(U, V )ab.
54
2. Non-degeneracy: ^e(P, P ) ̸= 1.
3. Computability: It is e(cid:14)cient to compute ^e(U, V ) for all
U, V ∈ G.

BDHI) [3] The ℓ-BDHI problem in (G, GT ) is de(cid:12)ned as
follow: On input an (ℓ + 1)-tuple (P, αP, α2P,··· , αℓP ) ∈
α ∈ GT . We say that the (t, ϵ, ℓ)-BDHI
Gℓ+1, output ^e(P, P )
assumption holds in (G, GT ) if no t-time algorithm has ad-
vantage at least ϵ in solving the ℓ-BDHI problem in (G, GT ).
2.2 Deﬁnition of Online/Ofﬂine Encryption
1
An ID-based online/o(cid:15)ine encryption (IBOOE) scheme
consists of the following (cid:12)ve probabilistic polynomial time
(PPT) algorithms:
• (param, msk) ← Set(1k) takes a security parameter k ∈
N and generates param, the global public parameters
and msk, the master secret key of the KGC.
• DID ← Ext(1k, param, msk, ID) takes a security param-
eter k, the global parameters param, a master secret
key msk and an identity ID to generate a secret key
DID corresponding to this identity.
• (cid:22)C ← EncO(cid:11) (1k, param) takes a security parameter k
and the global parameters param to generate an o(cid:15)ine
ciphertext (cid:22)C.
• C ← EncOn(1k, param, m, (cid:22)C, ID) takes a security param-
eter k, the global parameters param, a message m, an
o(cid:15)ine ciphertext (cid:22)C, an identity ID to generate a ci-
phertext C.
• (m/ ⊥) ← Dec(1k, param, C, DID) takes a security pa-
rameter k, the global parameters param, a ciphertext
C, a secret key of the receiver DID to generate a mes-
sage m or ⊥ which indicates the failure of decryption.
For simplicity, we omit the notation of 1k and param from
the input arguments of the above algorithms in the rest of
this paper.
