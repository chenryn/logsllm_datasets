What are Metasploit Modules?
• More than just exploits 
• Payloads – the “arbitrary code” you hear about in 
advisories
• Encoders – add entropy to payloads, remove bad 
characters
• NOP – create sophisticated nopsleds
• Auxiliary – Like an exploit module but without a payload
– Underappreciated

Which would you pick for a training drill?
Live Ammo?
Or Paint Balls?

= Live Exploits
= vSploit Modules
Introducing: vSploit Modules
• New spin on auxiliary modules
– Focus on attack response emulation
– Not intended for exploitation
– Continues with Metasploit roots as security testing and validation 
framework
– Allows organizations to understand their current security 
– Allows organizations to understand their current security 
investment
• Stand-alone compatibility
– No exploitation used
– Possible to remove exploit modules if necessary in some 
environments
8
• Evaluate devices on their own merit
• Minimal traffic evasion
• Trigger alerts on purpose
• Ensure proper network device placement
• Test and train security staff
vSploit: Purpose
• Test and train security staff
• Test security architecture without exploits
9
• Many network based security offering monitor network 
traffic for behavior
• Many devices are signature based
• Need to be placed on network properly to see interesting 
traffic
vSploit: Interesting Traffic
• Good test cases are hard to emulate
10
• IDS
• IPS
• DLP
• Firewalls
• Network Intelligence Devices
vSploit: Network Traffic Device
• Network Intelligence Devices
11
• ESIM
• Netflow collectors
• Other Log correlation devices (ie. Splunk)
• Network-based vulnerability analysis devices
Security Monitoring
12
• Signature-based
• Looks for known suspicious traffic
• SQL injections
• Attack responses
• Alert on suspicious behavior
IDS/IPS
• Alert on suspicious behavior
13
• Similar to IDS
• Concerned with data leakage
• Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
– Social security numbers
– Payment information
Data Loss Prevention (Network Based)
• Protected Health Information (PHI)
– Medical records 
• PCI-related data 
– Credit card numbers 
14
• Collects system logs
• Significant capital investment
• Provides correlation
• Provides reporting
• Key to most security operations efforts
Enterprise Security Information Management (ESIM)
• Key to most security operations efforts

Where to put it…
• Official modules live in msf3/modules/
– Subdirectories organized by module type  (exploit/, 
auxiliary/, post/, …)
• ~/.msf3/modules/ has same structure, loaded at 
startup if it exists
• ~/.msf3/modules/auxiliary/vsploit is a the 
• ~/.msf3/modules/auxiliary/vsploit is a the 
location for vSploit modules
