julia 0.3.3 on Mac OSX 10.9.4/amd64
When I re-define a function, any other functions that call that function need
to be recompiled to use the new definition.
Here is a simple example:
    julia> function f()  print("f called\n")  end
    f (generic function with 1 method)
    julia> function g() print("g, pre-f\n"); f(); print("g, post-f\n") end
    g (generic function with 1 method)
    julia> g()
    g, pre-f
    f called
    g, post-f
    julia> function f()  print("hi, I'm a new definition of f \n")  end
    f (generic function with 1 method)
    julia> g()
    g, pre-f
    f called
