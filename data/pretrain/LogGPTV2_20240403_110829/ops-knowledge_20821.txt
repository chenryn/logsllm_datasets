User: Please describe the basic concepts and common commands of Docker containers.
Assistant: Docker container is a virtual operating system environment that contains all the components and dependencies needed to run an application. It has functions similar to a lightweight virtual machine, but with higher operating efficiency. Each instance of a Docker container runs independently and is isolated from each other. The following are common Docker commands and their meanings: Common commands: 1. docker run Run a Docker container instance; optional parameters can be specified to mount data volumes at startup. 2. docker stop stops a running container. 3. docker ps View the list of currently running containers. 4. docker images to view the list of all local images. 5. docker rm removes one or more containers. 6. docker rmi removes one or more images. 7. docker tag creates a tag for the image. 8. docker push Push the local image to the Docker Hub warehouse. 9. docker pull Pull the image from the Docker Hub repository to use locally. 10. docker-compose uses Docker Compose to run multiple containers and manage the connections, port mapping, data volume mounting and other relationships between them.
