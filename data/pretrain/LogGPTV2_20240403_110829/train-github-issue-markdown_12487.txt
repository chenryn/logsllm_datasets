When following the instructions in #10181, the compilation process results in two test failures. The first failure is related to an issue documented in JuliaMath/openspecfun#30. The second failure is as follows:

```
Exception on 5: 
ERROR: Assertion failed: |func(D) - func(DM)| > 3.4332275e-5
    at read (./iobuffer.jl:86)
    at read (stream.jl:699)
    at anonymous (task.jl:837)
While loading linalg4.jl, in an expression starting on line 263.

ERROR: Assertion failed: |func(D) - func(DM)| > 3.4332275e-5

While loading /home/jiahao/julia-intel/test/runtests.jl, in an expression starting on line 39.
```

This error indicates that there is a discrepancy between the expected and actual values of `func(D)` and `func(DM)`, with the difference exceeding the threshold of 3.4332275e-5.
