these entities correspond to the third-party content providers that deliver the
content and the site that the content is delivered on behalf of, respectively. This
comparison provides a natural reference point, as both IDPs and third-party
content providers serve clients on behalf of the origin site.
Figure 6(a) shows the service provider breakdown; i.e., the fraction of user
sites (RPs, for example) that are served by each third-party service provider
(IDP, for example) of varying global Alexa rank. Figure 6(b) shows the service
user breakdown; i.e., the fraction of third-party relationships that these sites are
responsible for. We note that the content provider usage is distributed much
more evenly across popularities than the IDP usage, which is heavily skewed
towards the most popular sites.
In general, we ﬁnd that IDPs often provide service for less popular RPs,
whereas in the context of content delivery, it is much more common that the
third-party content is served by less popular sites. While these less popular sites
in some cases are backed up by a big company, the diﬀerences are striking. Fig-
ure 7 shows the relative diﬀerence in site rank between providers (e.g., IDPs)
and service user sites (e.g., RPs) for the two types of relationships. These re-
sults show that the identity management landscape is signiﬁcantly more skewed
towards the big players than the content delivery ecosystem. For example, while
50% of the observed content provider relationships have a site-rank ratio of at
least 4 (suggesting only a light bias towards more popular sites), the correspond-
ing RP-IDP site-rank ratio is at least 103 (between the RP and IDP ranks).
3.4 Service-Based Analysis
To gain a better understanding of the sites that are more likely to act as an RP
or IDP, we manually classiﬁed the top-200 sites, as well as each of the identiﬁed
IDPs, based on the primary service they provide. For this analysis, we manually
labeled each site into one of nine service classes. While alternative classiﬁcations
are possible, the classes used here were inspired by those used by Gill et al. [5].
Table 2 lists the service classes and the statistics for each class.
These results show that the use of IDPs is greatest among sites that share
information/news/data. This is consistent with signiﬁcant use of OAuth. How-

ever, it is also interesting to see that sites of some other service classes (e.g.,
tech and video sites) often use more IDPs per RP, in the case that they decide
to act as an RP. We conjecture that the high number of IDPs per RP for tech
sites reﬂects that these sites are early adopters of these technologies. This con-
jecture is supported by the fact that these sites to a much larger extent than
other sites give their users the option of using specialized IDPs, which provide
identity management as their only service.
We ﬁnd that both tech and commerce sites have a relative preference for
picking IDPs from within their own category. For example, the tech sites are
responsible for 12/40 (30%) of the tech IDP relationships observed from the
top-200 sites, and 2/5 (40%) of the IDPs used by RPs classiﬁed as commerce
sites are to IDPs that are commerce sites. These sites may have to rely more on
domain knowledge to maintain credibility within their communities than other
type of sites. News and ﬁle sharing sites, on the other hand, only use IDPs
classiﬁed as social (e.g., Facebook and Twitter). This usage may be motivated
by a desire to form “personal” relationships and connect with more users.

3.5 Cultural and Geographic Analysis
We next try to glean some insight as to whether there may be some preference
for selecting IDPs with similar geographic or cultural focus. Due to factors such
as global user populations, it is diﬃcult to uniquely assign each site to a single
geographic region. We make no claims regarding the absolute number of sites
that pick a “local” IDP. Instead, our observations are discussed relative to what
is observed for third-party content delivery relationships.
While the general conclusions of our results appear to hold true for a wide
range of mapping approaches, in this section we present results using three di-
verse methods: (i) a whois services based on where sites are registered, (ii) an
online geo-location service located in the US to map the location of the servers,
and (iii) statistics provided by Alexa estimating the region in which the site’s
primary user audience is located.
Table 3 shows the percentage of local relationships, for each of the three
mapping approaches. We use one row for sample sites mapped to diﬀerent parts
of the world, and list how large a percentage of the third-party providers are
considered local. The region “others”, which includes South America, Africa
and Oceania, is only responsible for 2-3.5% of the relationships. In the above
results we exclude the unmapped relationships.

While the correct geographic location of a service/site in non-trivial and the
exact percentage of sites classiﬁed as “local” clearly depends on the method
used, our results allow two major observations. First, we note that there is a
tendency for selecting local IDPs in all geographic regions with major IDPs, with
the exception of Europe and Other, which primarily use major American IDPs.
Second, and more importantly, the fraction of “local” IDPs is larger than the
fraction of “local” content providers for all regions except for Europe and Other.
It should be noted that the IDP usage in Europe and Other overall is much
smaller than in the other regions. This stronger locality preference (with the
exception of European sites) is further illustrated in Figure 8, which shows the
geographic breakdown for sites mapped to the regions with the most usage. Here,
the server-based mapping approach is used and we include a further breakdown
of Asia.
A closer look at the data reveals that info RPs only choose local IDPs, whereas
social, tech, ﬁle sharing, and news RPs use more non-local IDPs than other
categories.
4 Related Work
Other works have formally validated OAuth [3, 8], Facebook Connect [7],
OpenID [12], and SSO services in general [1]. For OAuth, a long laundry list
of problems and threats has been identiﬁed, including phishing, eavesdropping,
and various problems related to tokens [6]. It has also been shown that SSO
services are vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks [1] and that OpenID is vul-
nerable to cross-site request forgery attacks [12]. However, perhaps the biggest
weakness in SSO is the implementation of the protocols themselves [3, 10]. For
example, Wang et al. [13] presents an experimental study of the security of some
of the most popular SSO services.
It should also be noted that identity management solutions can greatly aﬀect
user behavior. For example, as users get used to authenticating with unknown
third-parties and following the path of least resistance, they may not take secu-
rity precautions or read privacy agreements, making them increasingly suscepti-
ble to phishing attacks [4]. This last uncertainty has prompted many users to be
cautious and afraid of using (unknown) third-party services, and may be another
reason why we observe that many sites select popular IDPs. This shift away from
specialized OpenID solutions may also hamper the development and/or adoption
of large-scale identity federations with stronger authentication methods [2].
Complementing prior work, we provide a large-scale characterization in which
we analyze relationships and third-party selection in the identity management
landscape.
5 Discussion and Conclusions
This paper studies how websites are using third-party identity providers. We
present a novel data collection methodology, which combines a Selenium-based
Third-Party Identity Management Usage on the Web
161
crawler and a log-based sampling technique, and use the collected datasets to
characterize global IDP usage. To provide a reference point for discussion, we
compare our observations with the selection of third-party content providers.
Our methodology and analysis captures how factors such as relative site popular-
ities, cultural/geographic biases, and the intrinsic characteristics of the websites
inﬂuence the relationships between RPs and IDPs.
Our study shows that a small number of IDPs dominate the IDP space. These
IDPs are typically popular web services with a large international user base, and
already have access to large amounts of sensitive user data. As these companies
are under public scrutiny, they will hopefully take greater care to securely store
and handle sensitive user information. However, the many RPs using a few IDPs
can also result in a large attack surface. The fact that OAuth is dominating
OpenID also raises some privacy concerns, as it typically involves sharing of
more user data.
A rich-gets-richer phenomena appears to be at play with the tendency of RPs
selecting highly popular services as IDPs. Instead of picking specialized IDPs,
which provide authentication as their primary service, RPs are choosing IDPs
with higher popularity ranking than themselves. Today, many specialized IDPs,
such as Clickpass, Vidoop, and MyopenID are therefore disappearing, being
acquired, and/or going out of business.
Our characterization and dataset is the ﬁrst large-scale measurement-based
study of the identity management landscape and its structure, and is expected to
provide an important stepping stone towards better understanding third-party
identity management and their impact on Web users. Future work includes a
large-scale security and privacy evaluation of alternative identity management
solutions that take into account the observed relationship tendencies observed
in the current identity management landscape.
