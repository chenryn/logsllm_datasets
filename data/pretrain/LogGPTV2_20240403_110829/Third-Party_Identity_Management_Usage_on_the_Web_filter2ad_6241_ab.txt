### Figures and Analysis

**Figure 4. Number of IDPs per Sampled RP**

**Figure 5. Breakdown of the Average Number of IDPs Selected per RP and Popularity Segment**

These figures correspond to third-party content providers that deliver content and the sites on which the content is delivered, respectively. This comparison provides a natural reference point, as both IDPs and third-party content providers serve clients on behalf of the origin site.

**Figure 6(a)** illustrates the service provider breakdown, showing the fraction of user sites (RPs) served by each third-party service provider (IDP) across varying global Alexa ranks. **Figure 6(b)** shows the service user breakdown, indicating the fraction of third-party relationships these sites are responsible for. We observe that the usage of content providers is more evenly distributed across different popularity levels compared to IDP usage, which is heavily skewed towards the most popular sites.

In general, we find that IDPs often provide services for less popular RPs, while in the context of content delivery, it is more common for third-party content to be served by less popular sites. Although some of these less popular sites may be backed by large companies, the differences are significant. **Figure 7** highlights the relative difference in site rank between providers (e.g., IDPs) and service user sites (e.g., RPs) for the two types of relationships. These results show that the identity management landscape is significantly more skewed towards major players than the content delivery ecosystem. For example, while 50% of the observed content provider relationships have a site-rank ratio of at least 4 (indicating a slight bias towards more popular sites), the corresponding RP-IDP site-rank ratio is at least 103 (between the RP and IDP ranks).

### 3.4 Service-Based Analysis

To better understand the sites that are more likely to act as RPs or IDPs, we manually classified the top-200 sites and each identified IDP based on the primary service they provide. For this analysis, we categorized each site into one of nine service classes, inspired by those used by Gill et al. [5]. **Table 2** lists the service classes and their respective statistics.

Our findings indicate that the use of IDPs is most prevalent among sites that share information, news, and data. This is consistent with the significant use of OAuth. However, it is also interesting to note that sites in other service classes, such as tech and video sites, often use more IDPs per RP when they decide to act as an RP. We conjecture that the high number of IDPs per RP for tech sites reflects their early adoption of these technologies. This is supported by the fact that these sites frequently offer users the option to use specialized IDPs, which provide identity management as their primary service.

We also find that both tech and commerce sites have a preference for selecting IDPs from within their own category. For example, tech sites account for 12 out of 40 (30%) of the tech IDP relationships observed from the top-200 sites, and 2 out of 5 (40%) of the IDPs used by RPs classified as commerce sites are also commerce sites. These sites may rely more on domain knowledge to maintain credibility within their communities. In contrast, news and file-sharing sites only use IDPs classified as social (e.g., Facebook and Twitter). This usage may be motivated by a desire to form "personal" relationships and connect with more users.

### 3.5 Cultural and Geographic Analysis

Next, we explore whether there is a preference for selecting IDPs with similar geographic or cultural focus. Due to factors such as global user populations, it is challenging to uniquely assign each site to a single geographic region. We do not claim absolute numbers but discuss our observations relative to what is observed for third-party content delivery relationships.

While the general conclusions of our results hold true for a wide range of mapping approaches, in this section, we present results using three diverse methods: (i) a whois service based on where sites are registered, (ii) an online geo-location service located in the US to map the location of the servers, and (iii) statistics provided by Alexa estimating the region in which the site's primary user audience is located.

**Table 3** shows the percentage of local relationships for each of the three mapping approaches. We use one row for sample sites mapped to different parts of the world, listing the percentage of third-party providers considered local. The region "Others," which includes South America, Africa, and Oceania, is responsible for only 2-3.5% of the relationships. In the above results, we exclude unmapped relationships.

Although the correct geographic location of a service/site is non-trivial and the exact percentage of sites classified as "local" depends on the method used, our results allow two major observations. First, there is a tendency to select local IDPs in all geographic regions with major IDPs, except for Europe and Others, which primarily use major American IDPs. Second, the fraction of "local" IDPs is larger than the fraction of "local" content providers for all regions except for Europe and Others. It should be noted that IDP usage in Europe and Others is much smaller than in other regions. This stronger locality preference (with the exception of European sites) is further illustrated in **Figure 8**, which shows the geographic breakdown for sites mapped to the regions with the most usage. Here, the server-based mapping approach is used, and we include a further breakdown of Asia.

A closer look at the data reveals that info RPs only choose local IDPs, whereas social, tech, file sharing, and news RPs use more non-local IDPs than other categories.

### 4 Related Work

Other works have formally validated OAuth [3, 8], Facebook Connect [7], OpenID [12], and SSO services in general [1]. For OAuth, a long list of problems and threats has been identified, including phishing, eavesdropping, and various issues related to tokens [6]. It has also been shown that SSO services are vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks [1] and that OpenID is vulnerable to cross-site request forgery attacks [12]. However, perhaps the biggest weakness in SSO is the implementation of the protocols themselves [3, 10]. For example, Wang et al. [13] present an experimental study of the security of some of the most popular SSO services.

It should also be noted that identity management solutions can greatly affect user behavior. As users get accustomed to authenticating with unknown third-parties and following the path of least resistance, they may neglect security precautions and privacy agreements, making them increasingly susceptible to phishing attacks [4]. This uncertainty has prompted many users to be cautious and wary of using (unknown) third-party services, which may be another reason why many sites select popular IDPs. This shift away from specialized OpenID solutions may also hinder the development and/or adoption of large-scale identity federations with stronger authentication methods [2].

Complementing prior work, we provide a large-scale characterization in which we analyze relationships and third-party selection in the identity management landscape.

### 5 Discussion and Conclusions

This paper studies how websites use third-party identity providers. We present a novel data collection methodology that combines a Selenium-based crawler and a log-based sampling technique, and use the collected datasets to characterize global IDP usage. To provide a reference point for discussion, we compare our observations with the selection of third-party content providers. Our methodology and analysis capture how factors such as relative site popularities, cultural/geographic biases, and the intrinsic characteristics of the websites influence the relationships between RPs and IDPs.

Our study shows that a small number of IDPs dominate the IDP space. These IDPs are typically popular web services with a large international user base and already have access to large amounts of sensitive user data. As these companies are under public scrutiny, they will hopefully take greater care to securely store and handle sensitive user information. However, the many RPs using a few IDPs can also result in a large attack surface. The fact that OAuth is dominating OpenID also raises some privacy concerns, as it typically involves sharing more user data.

A rich-gets-richer phenomenon appears to be at play, with the tendency of RPs selecting highly popular services as IDPs. Instead of picking specialized IDPs, which provide authentication as their primary service, RPs are choosing IDPs with higher popularity rankings than themselves. Today, many specialized IDPs, such as Clickpass, Vidoop, and MyOpenID, are disappearing, being acquired, or going out of business.

Our characterization and dataset are the first large-scale measurement-based study of the identity management landscape and its structure. This study is expected to provide an important stepping stone towards better understanding third-party identity management and its impact on Web users. Future work includes a large-scale security and privacy evaluation of alternative identity management solutions, taking into account the observed relationship tendencies in the current identity management landscape.
