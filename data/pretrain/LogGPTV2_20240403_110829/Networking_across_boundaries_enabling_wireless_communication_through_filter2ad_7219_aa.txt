ABSTRACT
We consider the problem of wireless communication across
medium boundaries, specifically across the water-air inter-
face. In particular, we are interested in enabling a submerged
underwater sensor to directly communicate with an airborne
node. Today’s communication technologies cannot enable
such a communication link. This is because no single type of
wireless signal can operate well across different media and
most wireless signals reflect back at media boundaries.
We present a new communication technology, translational
acoustic-RF communication (TARF). TARF enables under-
water nodes to directly communicate with airborne nodes by
transmitting standard acoustic signals. TARF exploits the fact
that underwater acoustic signals travel as pressure waves, and
that these waves cause displacements of the water surface
when they impinge on the water-air boundary. To decode the
transmitted signals, TARF leverages an airborne radar which
measures and decodes these surface displacements.
We built a prototype of TARF that incorporates algorithms
for dealing with the constraints of this new communication
modality. We evaluated TARF in controlled and uncontrolled
environments and demonstrated that it enables the first prac-
tical communication link across the water-air interface. Our
results show that TARF can achieve standard underwater bi-
trates up to 400bps, and that it can operate correctly in the
presence of surface waves with amplitudes up to 16 cm peak-
to-peak, i.e., 100, 000× larger than the surface perturbations
caused by TARF’s underwater acoustic transmitter.

INTRODUCTION
1
Underwater communication networks all face the same prob-
lem: they cannot directly communicate across the water-air
interface. Said differently, a deeply submerged sensor cannot
directly communicate with another node above the water’s
surface [12, 13, 32, 52]. This is because wireless signals ex-
hibit different properties in different media making it hard
to use any single type of signal for cross-medium communi-
cations [12]. In particular, while radio waves can travel over
long distances in air, they die exponentially fast in water (see
Fig. 1(a)). Conversely, while acoustic waves can travel over
long distances underwater, they reflect off the water’s sur-
face and hence cannot carry information across the water-air
boundary (as shown in Fig. 1(b)).
Yet, enabling communication across the water-air boundary
would bring benefits to numerous applications. In particular,

and subsea Internet of Things (IoT) all need to establish com-
munication links between underwater sensors and airborne
nodes [8, 15, 32]. Today’s state-of-the-art networks rely on au-
tonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) that act as data mules.
These AUVs need to dive into deep sea to collect data from
underwater sensors and continuously resurface to transmit col-
lected data before diving back in. This makes the exploration
process time-consuming and costly [18, 30], particularly in
offshore oil exploration which require scanning vast areas of
the seabed and where searching for and establishing a single
deep-sea well can cost more than $100 million [14]. Cross-
medium communication also presents security challenges,
which are particularly problematic in military applications.
For example, to communicate with an airborne drone, a deeply
submerged submarine needs to surface, compromising its lo-
cation to an adversary [17, 23, 49].
A common approach to work around this problem has
been to deploy relays that are partially submerged in wa-
ter [37, 40, 57, 59]. The relays collect information from un-
derwater nodes using acoustic links and relay it to nodes
above the surface using radio signals. However, such relays
can easily drift away with waves, severing communication to
underwater sensors [59]. Moreover, this workaround leaves
out submarines, which cannot rely on stationary deployed
relays as they need to roam vast areas of the ocean.
We present TARF, the first system that enables deeply sub-
merged underwater nodes to directly communicate across
the water-air boundary by leveraging standard acoustic links.
TARF’s design exploits the fundamental physical properties
of acoustic waves, as demonstrated in Fig. 1(c). In particular,
an acoustic signal emitted by a sound transducer travels as a
pressure wave. When the pressure wave hits the water surface,
it causes a perturbation or displacement of the surface due to
its mechanical nature. To pick up these signals, TARF relies
on an airborne Radio Frequency (RF) sensor. The sensor trans-
mits an RF signal and measures its reflection off the water
surface. These reflections vary due the surface displacement
caused by the impinging acoustic signals from an underwater
transmitter. TARF’s receiver analyzes the variations in RF
reflections and uses them to decode the bits communicated by
an underwater node. We call this phenomenon translational
acoustic-RF (TARF) communication, as it enables communi-
cation by leveraging a translation between acoustic signals
and the RF reflections.
This new communication modality presents unique con-
straints due to the entanglement of both electromagnetic and
mechanical nature of the resulting links, as well as unique
environmental challenges. As a result, translating this com-
munication paradigm into a practical networked system still
faces multiple challenges:
• First, the surface vibrations caused by acoustic waves are
very minute – of the order of few to tens of microns. The
2
displacement becomes even more shallow when the node
is deeply submerged in the ocean.
• More importantly, these perturbations are easily masked by
ocean waves that disturb the water surface and are three to
six orders of magnitude larger than them.
• Finally, the underwater acoustic transmitter has no mecha-
nism of estimating the overall channel. This makes it pro-
hibitive to choose the right modulation and coding schemes
to match the wireless channel quality. In particular, while
the above design enables uplink communication, it remains
elusive for the airborne sensor to send channel feedback to
the underwater node since RF signals are not mechanical
and hence will not vibrate the water’s surface and translate
into acoustic waves.
To overcome these challenges, TARF co-designs the
transceiver architecture with the communication protocols. At
a high level, it leverages a highly accurate RF-based sensor
that can measure minute reflections and introduces new algo-
rithms that can decode and eliminate unwanted interference.
We highlight the different system components below:
• First, we employ a millimeter wave sensor as a receiver
to capture and decode the RF reflections from the water
surface. Specifically, TARF’s airborne sensor transmits sig-
nals whose wavelength is few millimeters and measures
the phase of their reflection. Due to the small wavelength,
even surface displacements of few microns can lead to de-
tectable phase changes of few degrees, allowing TARF to
sense and decode very minute surface vibrations. We fur-
ther incorporate the millimeter wave sensor into an FMCW
(Frequency-Modulated Carrier Wave) radar, which allows
it to focus its beam on the water surface, and mitigate noise
and interference from undesired reflections.
• Second, we realize that ocean waves can be treated as struc-
tured interference in our context due to their mechanical
nature, and design filters that can mitigate their impact on
the received signal.
• Third, we discover unique properties of this new communi-
cation modality, which arise from the translation between
pressure and displacement at the water-air interface. For
example, we show that the channel’s frequency-selective
fading is inversely proportional to the transmit acoustic
frequency. Our transmitter and receiver take these prop-
erties into account to design a power- and rate-optimal
modulation scheme across the operational bandwidth.
• Finally, to select an appropriate bitrate, TARF can incor-
porate a pressure sensor as a proxy for the channel. The
pressure sensor can be used to infer the distance to the sur-
face and estimate the dominant pathloss component. This
would allow a TARF transmitter to perform rate adaptation
despite the lack of receiver feedback.
We built a prototype of TARF using underwater speak-
ers and custom-made millimeter wave radars. We tested our

prototype in synthesized water tanks and a swimming pool
(in the presence of practicing swimmers). Our experimental
evaluation demonstrates the following results:
• Our prototype achieves cross-medium throughput of hun-
dreds of bits per second in scenarios where existing com-
munication technologies cannot establish any link.
• TARF can decode the transmitted packets even in the pres-
ence of waves by up to 8 cm of height (16 cm peak-to-peak),
i.e., 100, 000× larger than the (µm) displacement caused by
the transmitted acoustic signals.
• We empirically evaluate the communication link with dif-
ferent modulation schemes (BPSK, QPSK, 16-QAM, etc.),
and we demonstrate that TARF’s channel-aware rate and
power allocation algorithm can consistently outperform
flat modulation schemes. Moreover at low SNRs, TARF’s
adaptation scheme can improve the throughput up to 10×
compared to flat modulation schemes.
While these results are promising, we believe they only
represent a first demonstration of TARF’s capability as a
cross-medium communication technology, and our design
still exhibits multiple limitations. First, because our system
cannot sustain a communication link in the presence of waves
with amplitudes larger than 16 cm, it cannot operate under
all weather conditions. In particular, it is resilient to capillary
waves – which consist the dominant ocean surface wave on
calm days – but not to wind waves. Another key limitation
arises from the need to have the transmitter and the receiver
relatively aligned along a vertical axis, since the throughput
decays rapidly when they are misaligned (as we quantify
in §8). Despite these limitations, we hope that this work can
motivate researchers to explore and develop TARF to enable
truly ubiquitous cross-medium communication, and allow
underwater computing devices to seamlessly communicate
with the outside world.
Contributions. TARF is the first communication technology
that enables a deeply submerged underwater node to directly
communicate with a compact airborne node. We present the
design, prototype implementation, and evaluation of this tech-
nology demonstrating that it can achieve standard underwater
data rates in scenarios where past technologies cannot estab-
lish any communication throughput.
2 RELATED WORK
TARF builds on past literature in two main areas: underwater
communication networks and wireless sensing, as we detail
below. In contrast to past work in these areas, TARF intro-
duces the first system that leverages sensing as a means for
communication across the water-air boundary.
Underwater Communication. The sinking of the Titanic
in 1912 and the start of World War I spurred interest in un-
derwater communication and sensing [35]. This led to the
3
development of SONAR systems, which leverage sound and
ultrasonic signals for submarine communications and for de-
tecting icebergs and U-boats [28, 35]. The appeal of acoustic
communication arises from their low attenuation in water in
comparison to RF signals. However, none of the early systems
could communicate across the water-air boundary [35].
Interest in underwater communication and sensing resurged
during the Cold War [25, 27]. The US and Soviet navies devel-
oped ELF (extremely low frequency) communication systems
which operate at 30-300 Hz and are capable of communicat-
ing across the air-water boundary [9, 41]. The key challenge
with these systems is that, due to their very long wavelengths,
they require kilometer-long antennas, which make them in-
feasible to incorporate into underwater vehicles [41, 56]. As a
result, most of the deployment of these systems remained lim-
ited to restricted point-to-point anchors deployed in specific
locations [9, 41].
Over the past two decades, there’s been mounting interest
in underwater networking for ocean exploration as well as oil
and gas mining [14, 42, 54]. To overcome the water-air barrier,
these systems rely on nodes that incorporate two communica-
tion modules: acoustic and RF [40, 41]. To send information
across the air-water boundary, these nodes dive deep into
the water to communicate with underwater sensors, typically
deployed on the sea bed, collecting information from them
using acoustic signals and re-surfacing frequently to relay this
information using RF signals for in-air communication, be-
fore diving again to collect more data [36, 37, 48]. Significant
research in the robotics community has focused on how to
perform this process efficiently with robotic swarms or how
to place partially-submerged relay nodes to optimize cover-
age [42, 48, 57]. Similarly, the military has deployed such
relay nodes in permanent points of interest in the ocean [34].
However, these systems still suffer from the ability to scale,
and are not feasible for submarines as surfacing would com-
