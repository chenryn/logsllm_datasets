User: I have a core dump under Linux. The process went on memory allocation rampage and I need to find at least which library this happens in. 
What tool do you suggest to get broad overview of where the memory is going? I know the problem is hard/unsolvable fully. Any tool that could at least give some clues would help.
[it's a python process, the suspicion is that the memory allocations are caused by one of the custom modules written in C]
Assistant: Try running linux perf tool on the python process with callgraph enabled.
if its multi threaded process give all associated LWPs as arguments.
