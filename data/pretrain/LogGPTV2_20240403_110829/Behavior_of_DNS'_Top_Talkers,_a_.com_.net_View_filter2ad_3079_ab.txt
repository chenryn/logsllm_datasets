### Accuracy of the Top-Talkers List and Query Type Profiling

#### Accuracy of the Top-Talkers List
The accuracy of a top-talkers list degrades over time if it is not continuously updated. By definition, the top-talker list initially accounts for 90% of all queries seen on day 0. As shown in Figure 3(b), if the list remains unchanged, it will only account for 84% of all queries by day 10.

#### Query Type Profiling
Figure 4(b) illustrates the distribution of query types over our study period. IPv4 address queries (type A) are the most frequent, followed by IPv6 address queries (AAAA). Mail server (MX) record queries are less common than AAAA queries. Other types, such as DNSSEC record types, service location (SRV) records, and obsolete A6 records, are also observed but constitute only a small portion of the total query traffic. The type distribution is similar for both top-talkers and the entire set of query sources.

- **(b)** Query type distribution for all sources and top-talkers.

To better understand the behavior of resolvers, we developed a profiling scheme, as shown in Figure 5(a). This figure provides a breakdown of resolver profiles and their distribution across one study day, which is representative of other days. On this day, we observed 975,391,055 queries from 958,558 distinct addresses. The line thickness of each node's border in the tree is proportional to the percentage of resolvers that fall into that category.

Our profiling starts by considering whether a resolver sent any A record queries, the most common type. 94.07% of all resolvers sent at least one A record query. These resolvers then split into two nearly equal groups: 55.63% also sent AAAA record queries, while 44.37% did not request any AAAA records.

**Figure 5: Resolver Query Type Profiles**
- **(a)** Includes all resolvers.
- **(b)** Includes only top-talkers.

This profiling can help detect unexpected behaviors or attacks, simulate resolvers more accurately, and analyze DNS behaviors. For example, the distribution has implications for tracking IPv6 deployment. It is encouraging that over half of the resolvers requesting IPv4 addresses also request IPv6 addresses. However, this DNS query behavior does not directly translate to actual IPv6 usage. Many operating systems and web browsers automatically request both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, causing local resolvers to resend both types of queries.

Interestingly, there were 40,211 resolvers that only requested IPv6 AAAA records, sending a combined 122,998 queries without requesting a single IPv4 address. This behavior, observed from the TLD, does not definitively indicate that these resolvers are IPv6-only.

The bottom row of the tree in Figure 5(a) considers whether a resolver sends MX record queries. The leftmost leaf node includes resolvers that send A, AAAA, and MX queries, such as those for small or medium companies. The rightmost leaf node includes resolvers that do not request A, AAAA, or MX records but query for other types of records, such as DNS monitoring tools.

When restricted to top-talkers, the profile still covers 90% of the traffic but reduces the number of resolvers to under 40,000. Top-talkers are more likely to request both A and AAAA records, with over 80% of resolvers who request IPv4 records also requesting IPv6 records. This can be partly explained by polling behavior, where a resolver may send a single query to a GTLD server, leading to an incomplete view of its overall behavior.

### Conclusions and Future Work

In this paper, we present the first analysis of DNS query traffic at a .com/.net TLD server site, characterizing the IP addresses of the DNS resolver population, the distribution of query volume, and query type profiling. Our goal is to define and understand the features of normal resolvers. Analysis of query types provides insights into typical resolver behaviors and the use of IPv6 in DNS.

We found that resolvers display interesting pinning and polling behavior patterns, and the query type distribution highlights three main types of traffic. The prominence of A6 queries demonstrates the old Internet adage that "nothing ever really dies in the Internet."

Our results show that the majority of the hundreds of millions of queries come from a relatively small and dynamic group of under 40,000 resolvers. The top-talkers dominate the observed behavior and serve as a useful low-pass filter when characterizing typical traffic patterns. Including non-top-talkers in the analysis can skew the results, so focusing on top-talkers allows us to concentrate on typical, well-maintained, and active resolvers.

Future work will explore how the top-talker list cutoff of 90% compares with other values, whether sources migrating out of the top-talkers list pin to another instance, and the stability of the global set of top-talkers.
