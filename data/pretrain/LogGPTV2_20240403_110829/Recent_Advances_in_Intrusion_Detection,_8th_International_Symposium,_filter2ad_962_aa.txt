Preface 
On behalf of the Program Committee, it is our pleasure to present the proceedings of 
the 8th Symposium on Recent Advances in Intrusion Detection (RAID 2005), which 
took place in Seattle, Washington, USA, September 7-9, 2005.  
that  arise  when  studying 
The  symposium  brought  together  leading  researchers  and  practitioners  from 
academia,  government  and  industry  to  discuss  intrusion  detection  from  research  as 
well  as  commercial  prospectives.  We  also  encouraged  discussions  that  addressed 
issues 
including  monitoring, 
performance  and  validation,  from  a  wider  perspective.  We  had  sessions  on  the 
detection  and  containment  of  Internet  worm  attacks,  anomaly  detection,  automated 
response  to  intrusions,  host-based  intrusion  detection  using  system  calls,  network 
intrusion detection, and intrusion detection, in mobile wireless networks.  
intrusion  detection, 
The RAID 2005 Program Committee received 83 paper submissions from all over 
the world. All submissions were carefully reviewed by several members of Program 
Committee and selection was made on the basis of scientific novelty, importance to 
the  field,  and  technical  quality.  Final  selection  took  place  at  a  Program  Committee 
meeting  held  on  May  11  and  12  in  Oakland,  California.  Fifteen  papers  and  two 
practical  experience  reports  were  selected  for  presentation  and  publication  in  the 
conference  proceedings.  The  keynote  address  was  given  by  Phil  Attfield  of  the 
Northwest Security Institute.  
A  successful  symposium  is  the  result  of  the  joint  effort  of  many  people.  In 
particular, we would like to thank all authors who submitted papers, whether accepted 
or  not.  Out  thanks  also  go  to  the  Program  Committee  members  and  additional 
reviewers for their hard work with the large number of submissions. In addition, we 
want  to  thank  the  General  Chair,  Ming-Yuh  Huang,  for  handling  conference 
arrangements and finding support from our sponsors. Finally, we extend our thanks to 
the  sponsors:  Pacific  Northwest  National  Laboratory,  The  Boeing  Company,  the 
University of Idaho, and Conjungi Security Technologies.

Abstract. To detect and defend against Internet worms, researchers have long
hoped to have a safe convenient environment to unleash and run real-world worms
for close observation of their infection, damage, and propagation. However,
major challenges exist in realizing such “worm playgrounds”, including the
playgrounds’ ﬁdelity, conﬁnement, scalability, as well as convenience in worm
experiments. In this paper, we present a virtualization-based platform to create
virtual worm playgrounds, called vGrounds, on top of a physical infrastructure.
A vGround is an all-software virtual environment dynamically created for a
