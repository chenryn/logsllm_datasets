titleblackhat:us-22 Catch Me If You Can: Deterministic Discovery of Race Conditions with Fuzzing
Finding concurrency bugs has presented a challenge for security and development teams. Race condition-based vulnerabilities are a growing category of bugs reported to vendors and have been observed in in-the-wild exploits. Coverage-guided fuzzing has been a boon to the security community both offensive and defensive but on its own is often not sufficient to find deep concurrency issues reliably. This research discusses a novel approach to fuzzing that enables deterministic discovery of race condition bugs, allowing researchers to unearth and root cause these serious bugs while still having fun.
