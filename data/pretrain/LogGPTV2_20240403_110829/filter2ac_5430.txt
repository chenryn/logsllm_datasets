### Title: Catch Me If You Can: Deterministic Discovery of Race Conditions with Fuzzing

**Abstract:**

Identifying concurrency bugs, particularly those related to race conditions, has been a persistent challenge for both security and development teams. Race condition-based vulnerabilities are an increasingly common category of bugs reported to vendors and have been observed in real-world exploits. While coverage-guided fuzzing has been a valuable tool for the security community, it often falls short in reliably detecting deep concurrency issues.

This research introduces a novel approach to fuzzing that enables the deterministic discovery of race condition bugs. This method allows researchers to not only uncover these critical vulnerabilities but also to pinpoint their root causes. By leveraging this new technique, security and development teams can more effectively address these serious bugs, all while maintaining an engaging and productive testing process.
