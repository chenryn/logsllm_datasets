region code.   
Region codes are a decimal digit that determines in which region 
a DVS can be sold.  The region code prevents regional arbitrage 
by buyers and allows large-scale geographic price discrimination 
by  merchants.    Therefore  a  primary  function  of  CSS  is  regional 
price discrimination5. 
CSS  encrypts  the  contents  of  a  DVD  so  that  only  approved 
readers  can  access  the  code.    A  key  that  decrypts  each  DVD  is 
stored  in  any  licensed  DVD  player.    Every  DVD  player  has  a 
small set of player keys (in case one key should be compromised).   
Every DVD is encrypted with a key, called the title key.   
Each  CSS-protected  DVD  begins  with  a  hashed  disk  key  (5 
bytes).    After  the  hashed  value,  the  full  disk  key  is  then  listed 
encrypted  in  every  possible  player  key.    There  is  a  set  of  409 
player keys.   
Every CSS licensee is given a player key.  Thus if a CSS licensee 
implements an unacceptable player, the license can be revoked by 
removing the corresponding encrypted disk key.   
Assuming the player has a valid key, the player confirms that it is 
using the correct key for the given disk by hashing the decryption 
of the disk key.  The hashed, decrypted key should be equal to the 
5 bytes at the beginning of the CSS block. 
Once the disk key has been determined, the DVD player uses the 
disk key to decrypt a title key.  The content is either encrypted in 
the title key or encrypted in a permutation of the title key and the 
list of encrypted disk keys. 
DeCSS breaks the encryption provided by CSS so that a DVD can 
be decrypted and played on unlicensed players.  This undermines 
the  licensing  strategies  and  the  value  of  the  region  code.    A 
primary function of DeCSS was to allow users to play DVDs on 
the Linux operating system using open code6.   
All players limit the number of times a region code can be altered.  
The  Macintosh  OS  X  DVD  player  limits  the  change  to  three 
times.  Other players limit the number of changes five times.  The 
number  of  times  a  player  can  allow  the  user  to  alter  the  region 
code is a function of the license associated with the DVD player 
key.    Should  any  player  manufacture  a  device  that  allowed 
arbitrary region code alterations then the license of that producer 
would be revoked.   
5  I  use  the  phrase  price  discrimination  in  the  economics  sense, 
implying  no  moral  wrong.  In  fact,  there  is  a  strong  economic 
argument that for high fixed cost, low marginal cost goods price 
discrimination  is  necessary  for  the market to function. A most 
common form of price discrimination is the “stay over Saturday 
night”  used  by  airlines  to  discriminate  between  corporate  and 
vacation travelers. Notice that air travel providers are in a high 
fixed cost, low marginal cost business.  
6 Since a fundamental element of open code is the ability of users 
to alter the code, no provider of open source players can enforce 
a limit on the number of times the region code is altered. 
5.3  eBook 
The  Adobe  eBook  software  provides  for  digital  encryption  of 
content  and  is  associated  with  a  series  of  sellers  who  agree  to 
provide  copies  of  an  eBook-protected  book  for  resale.    eBook 
merchants  provide  conversion  to  digital  format,  author  rights 
management services via eBook and offer to provide distribution.  
Different  providers  offer different bundles of services associated 
with  eBook.    However  eBook  can  be  purchased  with  server 
software so there is no archival requirement with eBook services.   
As  with  PDF,  Adobe  provides  a  free  eBook  reader  compatible 
with the eBook digital rights management system.   
In contrast with paper books eBooks expire.   
In contrast with other digital books Adobe prevents cut and paste 
of  significant  sections.    Adobe  eBook  also  prohibits  the  use  of 
text-to-audio readers. 
The  Advanced  eBook  Processor  directly  addresses  the  core 
question of which of the characteristics of paper books are worth 
preserving in the digital realm, with the eBook and the Advanced 
Processor having fundamentally different answers.   
6.  ANALYSIS 
In this section I bring together the functions of copyright and the 
functions of the digital rights management systems.  A hypothesis 
that  must  be  addressed  for  this  analysis  to  be  useful  is  that  all 
illegal  copying  substitutes  for  purchasing.    While  there  is 
evidence  to  the  contrary  [40],  [41]  the  concept  of  illegally 
copying as revenue lost will be assumed in the tabulated analysis.  
Then in each discussion the question will be briefly revisited.   
If  all  illegal  copying  is  a  direct  substitute  for  legal  copying  the 
obvious  implication  is  that  the  value  of  increased  access  is 
negligible.    There  is  simply  loss  of  revenue  for  the  author.    If 
illegal  copying  functions  as  free  advertisement,  and  encourages 
additional  purchases  then  increased  access  yields  increased 
revenue.  If illegal copying yields widespread awareness of a work 
and thus increases distribution but not sales, then the author losses 
monetary value but gains reputation value.   
There  is  a  second  conflict  is  evident  between  the  functions  of 
copy  accuracy:  how  does  availability  alter  the  veracity  of  a 
document?  When  there  is  an  increase  in  availability  and  a 
decrease in security in a document, what dominates? If the content 
are not available, or the availability is strictly controlled, then the 
useful functionally of surety is limited as fewer can learn from or 
build  on  the  information.    A  timely  example  is  the  alteration  of 
E.T.:  the  extra  terrestrial  for  re-release.    In  the  (2002)  release 
potty  humor  was  deleted,  and  police  are  seen  with  flashlights 
instead  of  guns.    These  digital  changes  would  be  misleading  to 
any  scholar  using  E.T.    to  study  the  culture  of  the  seventies.  
These changes were made possible by the existence of few master 
copies.    Similar  controls  of  documents  and  copying  technology 
allowed  Stalin  to  alter  official  historical  documents  when 
previously  favored  officials  were  purged.    In  both  cases,  the 
alteration is detectable by virtue of copies in archives beyond the 
reach of the editor.   
Having  considered  these  common  issues  I  now  consider  the 
systems described above according to copy accuracy.  In each cell 
the function of copy accuracy is listed in the first column.  Along 
each  row  the  ability  of  a  DRM  system  to  fulfill  that  function  is 
listed in the corresponding column.  The increase or decrease in 
84the ability of a system to support a particular function is noted by 
a minus or plus sign, respectively.   
The monetary incentive reflects the creation of a primary market.  
Recall  that  the  author’s  incentive  consists  of  both  a  direct  right 
over the content as well as a reputation right.  Attribution refers to 
the binding of the reputation attribute to the content.  Archiving, 
attribution  and  access  are  inherent  technologically  deterministic 
elements of the paper-based copyright system.

Advanced  eBook  Processor  enables  the  right  of  first  sale  (or 
secondary  distribution)  and  illegal  copying.    The  increase  or 
decrease  in  market  value  is  a  function  of  the  nature  of  illegal 
copying as substitution or complement for legal copies.   
Note  the  Adobe  eBook  confirms  the  features  of  digital  content 
that  are  a  loss  to  consumers  while  negating  the  gains  for 
consumers.    Specifically  the  eBook  removes  first  sale,  archival 
storage, and the ability to mark passages.  The eBook deletes the 
right  of  first  sale  and  related  rights  (rentals).    The  eBook 
essentially takes all alterations of the copy accuracy resulting from 
technological change and negates those granted to the consumer.   
Given that Advanced eBook Processor removes the tight binding 
between  author  and  content,  the  implication  is  that  eBook 
decreases reputation value.  However this is subject to the issue of 
distribution as opposed to encryption as surety mechanisms.   
In  terms  of  access  eBook  arguably  increases  access  in  that  it 
provides a portable format and support for creating digital books.  
However,  in  the  long  term,  eBook  decreases  access  not  only 
because  of  explicit  expiration  of  content  access  rights  but  also 
because  of  changes  in  format.    Advanced  eBook  Processor 
increases  access  and  availability  because  it  prevents  expiration 
and ensures availability when the Adobe-owned format is altered. 
The eBook is designed to allow temporary personal annotations.  
The ownership of the annotations is a function of licensing. The 
readers’ annotations may be deleted with the deletion of the text 
or  remain.  In  addition,  the  license  determines  if  the  annotations 
can  be  saved  as  a  discrete  file  and  shared  with  others  who  may 
own a copy of the book. The Advanced eBook Processor removes 
licensing  constraints,  but  also  the  promise  of  integrity  in  those 
annotations.   
In contrast to other on-line book formats, eBook prevents cut and 
paste of significant sections.  Of course, the centuries old tradition 
of  transcription  for  plagiarism  and  illegal  copying  remains 
available.    Thus  in  comparison  with  paper  texts  there  is  not 
effective  change  between  an  electronic  book  and  a  traditional 
book with respect to authorship and reputation value.

CSS  does  not  prevent  bulk  reproduction  and  resale  of  content.  
When content are mass-produced the only issue would be that the 
region  code  remains.    This  means  that  a  large-scale  commercial 
production of illegal copies must purchase originals in the target 
market.    In  effect,  this  prevents  consumers  from  purchasing 
illegally  copied  goods  in  another  region  and  returning  home  to 
sell them.  Also, by making it more likely that an illegal copy will 
not work in a CSS-compliant player, CSS may function to reduce 
demand for illegal copies of DVDs.   
CSS increases the monetary value of the DVD because it allows 
regional  price  discrimination.    CSS  limits  this  value  as  the 
secondary market is decreased because first owners cannot resale 
across boundaries.  If this constrains the right of first sale, there is 
a possible increase in monetary value to the owner. 
DeCSS decrypts the content on the player, allowing excerpts and 
therefore  misappropriation.    It  increases  each  of  access  and 
availability,  In  addition,  it  creates  the  ability  to  make  derivative 
works.    Unlike  the  case  of  books  direct  transcription  is  not  an 
option  in  video  content.    Therefore  DeCSS  may  increase  the 
.value  of  the  tradable  right  if  it  increases  the  use  of  a  good  for 
building  other  information  goods.    This  reuse  will  also  increase 
the reputation value.   
CSS prevents annotation.  DeCSS does not prevent annotation by 
design, but neither does it enable such annotation.   
DeCSS  enables  archiving  by  creating  an  unprotected  bit  stream 
and allowing any player to be used.  DeCSS increases access by
