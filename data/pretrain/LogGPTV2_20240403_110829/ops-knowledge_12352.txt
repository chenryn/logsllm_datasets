I have a Python script that manages the IP address on my Windows 10 computer. The script primarily executes `netsh` commands, which require administrative privileges.

Since I am the administrator of my own computer and I log in with an account (Adrian) that has administrative rights, I need a way to run the script with elevated privileges without using the "Run as administrator" option via right-click.

Is there a way to achieve "Run as administrator" from the command line (CMD) within my Python script?

Thank you.

For the solution, you can use the `runas` command to execute your script with elevated privileges. However, please note that `runas` requires the password for the specified user. Here is an example of how you might do it:

```cmd
runas /user:Adrian "python your_script.py"
```

When you run this command, you will be prompted to enter the password for the `Adrian` user. If you want to avoid entering the password every time, you may need to consider other methods such as configuring the User Account Control (UAC) settings or using task scheduling with elevated privileges.

If you have any further questions or need more detailed steps, feel free to ask.
