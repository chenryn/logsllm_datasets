data being handled by each software application are po-
tentially of signiﬁcant interest. Even if EM side-channel
analysis cannot reveal all of data being handled by an IoT
device platform, extracting critical information, e.g., cryp-
tographic keys, can help progress forensic analysis.
5.1. Observable Electromagnetic Spectrum Patterns
While there exists a wide variety of microcontroller
chips used on IoT devices, Sohaib et al. has shown that
it is still viable to perform EM side-channel attacks on
them [61]. When considering information leakage from an
EM emission trace, visually inspecting the time-domain
signal is the ﬁrst observational technique. This approach
is called simple electromagnetic analysis (SEMA), which
evolved from the simple power analysis (SPA) introduced
by Kocher et al. [24]. Another way of performing visual
observations is by transforming the EM trace into the fre-
quency domain and plotting it as a spectrogram. This
enables observation of diﬀerent signal patterns distributed
over multiple frequencies.
Multiple published works have demonstrated the ef-
fectiveness of the SEMA approach in extracting critical
6
extract encryption keys from three diﬀerent chips used on
smartcards namely; COMP128, DES, and RSA. Accord-
ing to this study, the SNR of EM emissions from these
chips is higher than the SNR of power consumption anal-
ysis. This results in the extraction of more information
from the DEMA technique as compared to simple power
analysis attacks [70]. Asymmetric key encryption, such as
RSA, can also be attacked by identifying the individual
modular exponentiation operations performed within the
algorithm through EM emissions [71].
Due to the modern electronic multimedia distribution
model, e.g., music, movies, and ebooks, end-users can of-
ten become the attackers. These users might have the
malicious intention of breaking encryption or sharing Dig-
ital Rights Management (DRM) protected data. Since the
victim device is owned by the attacker, unlimited physical
access to the hardware and software becomes available for
the attacker through various side-channel attacks. White
Box Cryptography (WBC) was introduced as a solution to
this; whereby cryptographic algorithms and keys are com-
bined with random codes and random data to create an
obfuscation that makes side-channel attacks more diﬃcult.
However, it has been shown that EM side-channel attacks,
such as DEMA, are still capable of extracting encryption
keys despite of the application of WBC techniques [72].
Recently, Camurati et al. made an important discov-
ery that extended the previously known capabilities of
EM side-channel analysis of cryptographic operations on
IoT devices [73]. It was shown that mixed-signal proces-
sors, such as system-on-chips (SoCs), that contains a radio
transceiver and a CPU on the same silicon die, can cause
long distance EM leakages. This occurs when the CPU
noise gets modulated into the radio transceiver’s emission
– extending the range of the CPU EM side-channel. As
the usage of SoCs is getting increasingly popular on IoT
devices, this latest type of EM side-channel leakage, called
screaming channels, has signiﬁcantly increased the poten-
tial attack surface.
5.3. Analysis on Wireless-Powered Devices
Unlike traditional computing devices that have their
own power source to run CPU operations, wireless-powered
devices, e.g., passive RFIDs, depend on an external RF
ﬁeld provided by the device’s reader for power [74]. IoT de-
vices are ideal candidates to be powered by wireless means.
EM side-channel analysis on such devices is challenging
due to the presence of a strong RF ﬁeld from the reader,
which obfuscates the weak EM emissions of the devices
themselves. However, RFID based devices are being used
in critical systems, such as secure access control to build-
ings and electronic payments, where cryptographic opera-
tions are performed on-board. Therefore, investigating the
EM side-channel capability on such devices is important
from both security and forensic standpoints.
Hutter et al. demonstrated the capability to perform
EM side-channel analysis on RFID based devices using a
custom-made RFID tag as a proof of concept [75]. Using
Figure 3: EM analysis of XOR-Cipher algorithm to extract the en-
cryption key.
Matrix that provides the best correlation of hamming dis-
tances. The hypothetical key corresponding to this row
is likely the encryption key used for the XOR operation
inside the CPU.
Standard encryption algorithms, such as the Data En-
cryption Standard (DES) and the Advanced Encryption
Standard (AES), employ XOR operations at various stages
in their functionality using chunks of the encryption key
and input data. Therefore, DEMA attacks are possible by
attacking each chunk of the key being used with the XOR
operations. Such an attack reveals parts of the encryption
key, which have to be combined at the end. However, in a
real-world setting, the attacker may not have enough EM
emission samples of the encryption operations to calculate
the correct part of the key used. This results in lists of
possible key chunks for each segment of the encryption
key used in the algorithm. The problem of identifying the
correct parts of the key to build the complete encryption
key is called the Key Enumeration Problem, which can be
solved within a reasonable computational overhead [67].
Quisquater et al. practically demonstrated that EM
analysis is a viable option to the aforementioned power
analysis attack on computer CPUs [68]. By precisely mov-
ing the EM probe over a microcontroller, the authors were
able to build an accurate 3-dimensional EM signature of
the chip running an idle loop. It was shown that the ra-
diation spectrum of each processor was suﬃciently unique
to use as a distinguishable feature for processor identiﬁ-
cation. These experiments were performed in a Faraday
cage to minimise the external noise eﬀects and the EM
emissions were captured using a small magnetic loop an-
tenna (diameter ≈ 3mm). An oscilloscope digitised the
signal for analysis. Gandolﬁ et al. [69] applied DEMA to
7
this custom set up, the authors were able to recover the
AES key used in a challenge response protocol between
the RFID tag and the reader. In order to avoid the dis-
turbance from the RF ﬁeld of the reader device, the RFID
circuitry was placed outside the reader’s RF ﬁeld, while
the power harvesting antenna is kept inside the reader’s
RF ﬁeld. The two components were connected through
a suﬃciently long wire. This enabled the measurement
of the EM emissions from the RFID circuitry without in-
terference. However, it is not possible to follow a similar
approach in a regular RFID tag as the antenna and RFID
circuitry are inseparable by any reasonable means.
Kasper et al. performed EM side-channel attacks on
RFID based smart-cards in a more realistic setting. This
research employed commercially available smart-cards and
performed the attacks within the RF ﬁeld of the RFID
reader [76]. When the RFID smart-card is consuming
more energy, the amplitude of the RFID readers RF ﬁeld
becomes lower. Similarly, when the RFID smart-card is
consuming less energy, the amplitude of the RFID read-
ers ﬁeld is higher. This means, the power consumption of
the RFID tag is reﬂected in the amplitude of the RFID
readers carrier frequency. Kasper et al. used this signal
as the EM side-channel to attack internal operations of
the RFID reader. A computer-controlled USB-oscilloscope
and a computer-connected custom-made RFID reader was
used to attack the RFID tag while capturing EM ﬂuctua-
tions using a small RF loop probe. This set up was used
to perform a correlation power analysis (CPA) attack to
extract the symmetric keys used in DES and 3-DES im-
plementations on the smart-card successfully.
Recent research by Xu et al. demonstrated that RFID
based smart-cards that employ side-channel attack mit-
igation techniques, such as head and tail protection, are
not eﬀective enough against EM side-channel analysis at-
tacks [77].
In their work, encryption keys used for the
3DES algorithm were demonstrated to be recoverable. In
light of this attack vector, it is important to note that
wireless-powered IoT devices are also susceptible to threats
from EM analysis based attacks.
Many smart-card-based fraud, such as stealing credit
card details, involve malicious devices, such as card skim-
mers, that can read and store data from the cards. Inves-
tigators face the challenge of identifying victims of such
skimming devices due to the fact that card details are
encrypted when stored on these devices. Souvignet and
Frinken demonstrated that correlation power analysis, which
is a variant of DPA attack, can be used to extract the de-
tails of victim smart-cards from such skimmer devices by
physically tapping into a seized device [78]. The success of
their work indicates that EM side-channel analysis can be
even more promising in extracting such evidence without
requiring any physical alterations to the device itself.
5.4. Countermeasures to Electromagnetic Side-Channels
As EM side-channel analysis has been shown to be suc-
cessful on recovering data from computing devices, various
8
countermeasures have been explored to counteract it on
both software and hardware levels [25]. Masking variables
by using random values alongside the operations is a ba-
sic software-based countermeasure that has been proven
to not be eﬀective enough against EM side-channel at-
tacks [79, 80]. Various other approaches including the
randomisation of the operation sequences or lookup tables
of algorithms [81, 82], avoiding instructions pairs execut-
ing adjacently that are known to emit distinguishable EM
patterns [38, 39], and accessing critical data using point-
ers instead of values [83] require further studies to see how
eﬀective they are against EM side-channel attacks.
Quisquater et al.
suggests several hardware design
countermeasures to these attacks [68]. Actions that can
be taken by hardware designers includes minimising metal
parts in a chip to reduce EM emissions, the use of Faraday
cage like packaging, making the chip less power consum-
ing (which leads to less unintentional emissions), asyn-
chronism (i.e., design the chip not to use a central sys-
tem clock and instead operate asynchronously), and the
use of dual line logic (i.e., using two lines that in com-
bination of two bits represents a state instead of a single
line that simply represent 0 or 1 states). Furthermore,
it has been shown that it is possible to mathematically
model an electronic chip during the design phase to iden-
tify and avoid potential information leakages through EM
side-channels [84, 85].
6. Standards and Tools
EM side-channel attacks are not currently commonly
being used for digital forensics purposes. Therefore, it can
be too early to ﬁnd any existing standards or tools on
EM side-channel analysis for digital forensics. However,
in order for future establishment of standards and tools, it
is important to review the relevant standards and tools in
both hardware and software security domains.
The concerns of electromagnetic wave emissions from
IoT devices from the software perspective are mostly con-
centrated towards the wireless communication technolo-
gies, such as WiFi, Bluetooth, and proprietary IoT proto-
cols, e.g., Zigbee [86, 87]. Meanwhile, unintentional EM
emission minimisation is generally left to those involved in
the hardware design and manufacturing process. The term
electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) refers to a device’s
unintentional EM emissions that can aﬀect the function-
ality of other devices and the health of humans who are
exposed to it [27]. The Federal Communications Commis-
sion (FCC), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA),
the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and
the European Union (EU) are examples of authorities con-
cerned with EMC [88, 89]. However, regarding the ques-
tion of EM side-channel information leakage from gen-
eral purpose electronic devices, there are no such rules to
govern the manufacturers. Instead, only guidelines exist,
which may or may not be followed [90, 91].
Figure 4: Altering the traditional IoT digital evidence acquisition process [14], EM side-channel analysis can help in various ways for live
analysis of computing devices.
Once a hardware device’s design is completed and man-
ufacturing commences, it is a challenging task to apply
mitigation steps should the EMC tests reveal that it does
not meet requirements.
In the worst case scenario, the
minimisation of EM emissions may require a complete re-
working of the PCB used in the device or a replacement
of a critical electronic component. Due to the potential
for costly manufacturing disruption, the minimisation of
EM emissions is necessary from the initial hardware design
phase. Due to the fact that EM side-channel information
leakage is not a problem limited to hardware manufactur-
ers, a joint eﬀort by both hardware and software developers
to establish standards is necessary.
In order to facilitate the assessment on EM side-channel
security threats, standardised tools and frameworks are
highly necessary. Test vector leakage assessment (TVLA)
is a technique that can be used to assess the resistance
of cryptographic implementations against hardware side-
channel attacks [92]. TempestSDR is a software tool that
can be used with a large variety of hardware platforms,
e.g., the universal software radio peripheral1 (USRP) or
HackRF 2, to eavesdrop on computer monitors by captur-
ing the EM signals emitted by the video cables [93, 94].
Multiple commercial and open source products exist that

can be used to break encryption on microcontroller based
IoT devices, such as ChipWhisperer [95, 96] and Riscure
Inspector [97, 98]. Blanco et al. presented a side-channel
trace acquisition framework called SCAP, which is tar-
geted at general purpose computing devices (including mo-
bile devices). While the framework does not currently per-
form side-channel attacks, the objective is to provide a
platform to build future analysis tools [99]. Such tools en-
able IoT system developers to test the robustness of their
hardware against physical side-channel attacks and iden-
tify information leakage.
7. Discussion
Having discussed the scientiﬁc literature related to EM
side-channel analysis attacks, it is important to identify
the future impact it may cause in the domain of digital
forensics on IoT devices. This section highlights some of
the potential ways this impact may occur in the future
under diﬀerent themes. Figure 4 illustrates the avenues
for future research in this direction. Many of these future
potentials are already starting to be realised and others
are ambitious predictions that can prove signiﬁcantly ben-
eﬁcial to digital forensics.
Recent versions of mobile operating systems, e.g., An-
droid and iOS, secure their internal storage using encryp-
tion. Critical information necessary for digital forensic in-
vestigation can be inaccessible due to being stored in an
encrypted form [100, 101, 102]. This includes encrypted
emails, encrypted instant messenger applications, encrypted
ﬁles, and encrypted storage partitions. While the increas-
ing application of cryptographic protection on computing
devices poses a challenge to traditional digital forensics,
it can open up new opportunities to EM side-channel at-
tacks [7]. EM side-channel attacks require a large num-
ber of traces acquired from a victim device while the de-
vice is performing cryptographic operations using a single
key. The most common encryption operations occurring
on older systems are the secure socket layer (SSL) based
web traﬃc [103]. With encrypted data storage becoming
commonplace, EM side-channel attacks can potentially be
performed by observing cryptographic operations during
live data forensic analysis procedures [104].
Instead of using a single side-channel attack in iso-
lation, combinations of multiple side-channel attacks di-
rected towards a single computer system can prove more
fruitful.
It has been proven that power and EM side-
channel analysis can be combined to achieve better re-
