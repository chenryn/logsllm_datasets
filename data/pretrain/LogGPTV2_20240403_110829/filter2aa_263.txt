## Introduction to DOCSIS
### What is DOCSIS?
DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification) is a standard for delivering high-speed internet, telephony, and digital TV services over cable networks.

### Use of DOCSIS
- **Internet**: The most common application of DOCSIS.
- **Telephony**: Most cable modems include an Analog Telephone Adapter (ATA).
- **Digital TV Decoders**: Built-in cable modems in decoders to monitor and provide feedback data from end users.

### General Architecture
- **CMTS (Cable Modem Termination System)**: On the ISP side, CMTS broadcasts packets to end users on a single frequency.
- **Modems**: On the user side, modems send packets back to the CMTS on a different frequency during their assigned timeslot.
- **Coverage**: A CMTS can serve a small neighborhood to an entire city.
- **Frequencies**: Downstream frequencies are similar to those used for TV.
- **Packet Encapsulation**: Uses MPEG packets, similar to digital TV, to encapsulate data.

### Registration Process
1. Acquire and lock the downstream frequency.
2. Determine the upstream parameters.
3. Obtain an IP address.
4. Download the modem configuration via TFTP.
5. Apply the configuration and enable packet forwarding.

### Encryption on the Link
- **Encryption and Authentication**: Not mandatory.
- **BPI (Baseline Privacy Interface)**: Provides mechanisms for authentication and encryption.
- **Algorithms**: DES and AES are the supported encryption algorithms.

## Sniffing Techniques
### DVB-C Card
- **Feasibility**: Possible due to similarities in protocols and frequencies with digital TV.
- **Cost**: Inexpensive.
- **Limitations**: Only captures downstream traffic.
- **Alternatives**: Hardware like USRP can capture both upstream and downstream traffic.

### Packet-o-matic
- **Input Module**: Captures the traffic.
- **Processing Modules**: Packets are processed and matched using match, helpers, and conntrack modules.
- **Target Module**: Processes packets to produce the desired output.
- **Real-Time Operation**: Everything occurs in real-time.
- **Interfaces**: Telnet and XML-RPC interfaces are available.

## Exploitation Possibilities
### Privacy
- **Data Sniffing**: Capture data destined for all ISP users.
- **Stream Reassembly**: Reassemble streams in real-time and extract usable files (e.g., emails, phone conversations, IM chats).
- **DoS Attacks**: Perform DoS by reinjecting TCP RST (tcpkill) packets or ICMP error packets.

### Modem SNMP Hacks
- **IP Filters**: Change the IP filters of the modem's Ethernet bridge.
- **Access Control**: Deny access to the server polling the download/upload quota.
- **Reboot**: Reboot the modem.
- **Other Actions**: Perform any other actions allowed by the modem's SNMP interface.

### Miscellaneous
- **Filter Bypass**: Bypass modem filters by reinjecting sniffed packets into the LAN.
- **Virtual Network Interface**: Create a virtual network interface (tap device) to use with other tools.
