**Current behavior**
After updating to Angular 4 code below throws errors (Cannot read property
'instance' of undefined). It was working without any problems before update:
    export` const entity = new InjectionToken('entity');
    export class BaseComponent {
       protected entity;
       constructor(injector: Injector) {
           ...
           this.entity = injector.get(entity)
       }
    }
    @Component({
       ...
       providers: [{provide: entity, useValue: 'whoCares'}]
    })
    export class InheritorComponent {
        constructor(injector: Injector) {
            super(injector)
        }
    }
**Expected behavior**
I excepted InheritorComponent to be initialized with provided data via token.
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**
Here is working example:

Code is similar. The only difference is angular version.
