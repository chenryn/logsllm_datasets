### Overview of Facebook Applications and Their Usage

The following applications, Hugged, iSmile, and My Angels, allow users to exchange virtual hugs, smiles, and angels, respectively. Additionally, there are Holiday Cheers (enabling the sending of virtual seasonal greetings), Pound Puppies (allowing users to adopt virtual pets), and The Streets (a platform where users can engage in virtual fights with other users, similar to Fighters’ Club [10]).

**Table 1: Application Usage Statistics**

| Application   | Launch Date | Avg. DAU | Avg. MAU | Rank | DAU/MAU |
|---------------|-------------|----------|----------|------|---------|
| Hugged        | Feb 2008    | 131,292  | 2.3M     | 50   | 0.057   |
| iSmile        | Aug 2008    | 120,361  | 2.4M     | 65   | 0.050   |
| Holiday Cheers| Nov 2008   | 75,283   | 1.1M     | 97   | 0.068   |
| My Angels     | Aug 2008    | 14,016   | 370K     | 339  | 0.038   |
| Pound Puppies | Jun 2008    | 1,545    | 14K      | 1,368| 0.11    |
| The Streets   | Nov 2008    | 1,232    | 12.5K    | 1,520| 0.099   |

*Note: The average DAU and MAU statistics were calculated from Dec 20 to Jan 24. Application ranks show how popular the six applications are among 81,000+ Facebook third-party applications.*

All six applications are in the top 5% of Facebook applications by DAU, with Hugged, iSmile, and Holiday Cheers being in the top 100. Hugged is the most popular and longest-deployed, followed by iSmile. Holiday Cheers, launched just before Thanksgiving, attracted over 1.4 million users in less than two months. In contrast, The Streets and Pound Puppies grew more slowly, as indicated by their metrics.

### Comparative Analysis with Top 200 Facebook Applications

To evaluate the representativeness of our applications, we manually explored the workflows of the 200 most used Facebook applications over a two-week period from January 10 to January 24, 2009. Our findings include:

- **Application Semantics**: Hugged, iSmile, My Angels, and Holiday Cheers only allow interactions with Facebook friends, aligning with 61% of the top 200 applications. The Streets and Pound Puppies, like the remaining 39%, do not restrict interactions to friends.
- **Delay Requirements**: 70% of the top 200 applications, including our six, use the Facebook canvas design, which requires responses to be rendered within 8 seconds. The rest are delay-insensitive.
- **Engagement Ratio**: The DAU/MAU ratio indicates user engagement. The Streets and Pound Puppies have high ratios due to their point-based game mechanics. Clustering the top 200 applications by engagement ratio, we found that Hugged, Holiday Cheers, and iSmile are similar to 31.6%, The Streets and Pound Puppies to 19.2%, and My Angels to 13.5%.

Thus, our six applications provide a diverse and representative sample of top Facebook applications.

### Passive Measurements

Application servers receive user requests forwarded by the OSN, providing vantage points for passive measurements. These requests fall into three categories:
1. **Page View (PV)**: Regular requests from clients who have installed the application.
2. **Not Installed (NI)**: Requests from clients who have not yet installed the application, redirected to an installation page.
3. **Inline (IR)**: AJAX-based queries for rendering content within HTML pages.

We collected network and application-layer traces from November 18, 2008, to January 5, 2009, for Hugged, Holiday Cheers, and The Streets. Network layer traces log all request and response packets using `tcpdump`, while application-layer traces record the time stamps when the server starts processing a request and writes the response to the TCP socket.

**Figure 3: Total and PV Requests (per hour) for Hugged**

- More than 89% of the total request arrivals are of type PV.
- Slight discrepancies between network and application-layer logs are due to `tcpdump` failing to log some requests and a small fraction of requests being dropped during high load periods.

### Active Tracing Using PlanetLab

To gather data from multiple vantage points, we conducted experiments using PlanetLab (PL) nodes across 32 countries. We used these nodes to send synthetic requests to various application servers, modeling characteristics of user PV requests to understand their impact on OSN request forwarding and response processing delays.

- **User Accounts**: We used three different Facebook user accounts with varying numbers of friends to diversify user locations.
- **Experiment Design**: 
  1. A client sends an HTTP GET request to the OSN with an experiment ID.
  2. The application server logs the arrival time stamp.
  3. The server responds with content specific to the experiment ID.
  4. The client receives the response and logs the arrival time stamp.

We varied the request size and response content to measure OSN Request Forwarding Delay (𝑑𝑓) and Response Processing Delay (𝑑𝑔). Non-User-Related and User-Related content experiments were conducted to diversify the response content.

### Observations and Inferences at Application Servers

The client-OSN interaction process faces two types of delays at third-party application servers: request queuing delay (𝑑𝑞) and request processing delay (𝑑𝑝). Understanding the workload characteristics and their impact on these delays is crucial for resource provisioning. Key observations and analysis include:

- **Workload Characteristics**: Analyzing request arrival patterns and response sizes helps in understanding the impact on 𝑑𝑞 and 𝑑𝑝.
- **API Calls**: Delays involved when application servers interact with OSN servers through API calls, such as updating a client’s newsfeed based on recent activity.

These insights help in ensuring a satisfactory user experience, especially for popular and viral applications.
