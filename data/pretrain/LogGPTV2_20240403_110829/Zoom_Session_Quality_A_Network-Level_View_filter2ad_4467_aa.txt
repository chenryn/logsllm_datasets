## Abstract
Zoom is a widely used videoconferencing application for remote work and learning. In 2020, the University of Calgary adopted Zoom for delivering online lectures during work-from-home restrictions. Starting in September 2021, the university offered both in-person and online classes, leading to increased Zoom usage on the campus network. This paper examines Zoom network traffic in two ways: small-scale active measurements of individual test sessions to understand communication patterns and traffic structure, and large-scale passive measurement of campus-level traffic to identify usage patterns and performance issues. Our findings reveal a 4x increase in Zoom traffic on our campus network since 2020, along with network-related issues affecting session quality.

## 1. Introduction
Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, Zoom has become a primary platform for online learning at many universities, including the University of Calgary. Zoom's popularity grew due to its ease of use and ability to host large meetings [2, 17].

In September 2021, the University of Calgary began transitioning back to in-person learning for 50% of its courses. Many students who enrolled in in-person classes also had Zoom-based online lectures for other courses. This often required students to be on campus for their online classes, significantly increasing Zoom traffic on the campus network and leading to anecdotal reports of performance issues.

This paper describes our approach to studying Zoom network traffic on campus and the insights gained from this analysis. We explore the size of the Zoom user community on campus, the number of classes joined by students while on campus, and student behavior when joining Zoom sessions, such as timing, duration, and camera/microphone usage. We also examine the user-level Quality of Experience (QoE) for Zoom sessions. Our results provide a better understanding of Zoom usage on the campus network and highlight several network performance issues.

Our main contributions include tools for analyzing empirical Zoom network traffic data and insights into Zoom session quality from a network-level perspective. Table 1 summarizes our key observations, which are discussed in detail throughout the paper.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of related work. Section 3 describes our methodology for collecting and analyzing Zoom network traffic. Section 4 presents results from small-scale experiments, while Section 5 discusses results from campus-wide traffic analysis. Section 6 discusses the performance implications of our findings, and Section 7 concludes the paper.

## 2. Related Work
Several studies have examined the impact of the pandemic on Internet traffic, including enterprise networks [1, 5], ISP networks [7], mobile networks [9], and academic environments [4, 15]. Here, we highlight some key papers:

- **Feldmann et al. [5]**: Studied the effects of the pandemic on Internet traffic, observing a 15–20% increase in traffic volumes within a week of lockdowns in Europe. They identified new applications like Zoom and Teams contributing to the growth.
- **Favale et al. [4]**: Examined changes in network traffic at Politecnico di Torino, a medium-sized Italian university. They found that incoming traffic decreased, but outbound traffic more than doubled for the campus hosting the e-learning platform. Unlike our study, they focused on a custom in-house solution based on BigBlueButton.
- **Chang et al. [3]**: Developed a cloud-based framework to compare QoE for Meet, WebEx, and Zoom using emulated clients. They tested up to 11 participants and focused on architecture, infrastructure, geographic location, lag, video bit rate, and network bandwidth constraints.
- **MacMillan et al. [10]**: Compared Meet, Teams, and Zoom in an experimental testbed, focusing on network utilization, robustness, and fairness under different network conditions. They tested up to 8 participants.
- **Marczak and Scott-Railton [12]**: Investigated potential security vulnerabilities in Zoom network traffic.
- **Mahr et al. [11]**: Analyzed the types of data sent by Zoom in encrypted and unencrypted forms.

Our work differs from these studies by focusing on developing tools to analyze empirically observed Zoom sessions generated by thousands of users on our campus network.

## 3. Methodology
Our approach combines active and passive network traffic measurement techniques to study on-campus Zoom sessions from both network-level and application-level perspectives.

### Small-Scale Active Measurements
We use Wireshark [16] to capture and analyze packet-level traffic from controlled Zoom test sessions. Although all Zoom traffic is encrypted, we can still extract useful information such as IP addresses, port numbers, session structure, and bandwidth consumption. Data collection is performed using Windows and Linux laptops in a controlled environment with only one user per session. All participants opted in for data collection.

### Large-Scale Passive Measurements
We analyze campus-wide Zoom traffic using summarized logs from our campus network monitor (Endace DAG; Dell PowerEdge running Zeek). These logs provide detailed information about each connection, including start time, protocol endpoints, bytes/packets transferred, and duration. The logs are collected with permission from the campus IT staff and through the research ethics review process. We focus on aggregate traffic characteristics from thousands of users, most of whom use transient IP addresses from DHCP/NAT.

We collect passive measurement data from a mirrored stream of all traffic passing through the campus edge router, allowing us to observe all traffic with at least one endpoint on the campus network and one on the Internet. We identify Zoom traffic based on the 118 IPv4 network prefixes listed on the Zoom website. We also use information about the Zoom connection process and local DNS logs to distinguish between different Zoom server types (e.g., MMR, API, CDN, logging, Web, XMPP, Zone Controller).

## 4. Small-Scale Measurements
This section presents results from our small-scale measurements of Zoom test sessions using Wireshark. The goal is to understand the structure of Zoom traffic and enable analysis using campus-level connection logs.

### 4.1. Zoom Session Structure
Our first experiment involved a 45-minute Zoom test session with three participants. The meeting host was on campus using a wireless laptop, the second participant was at home, and the third participant joined late and left early.

Figure 1(a) shows a time-series plot of the packet traffic during the session. After launching the meeting, the host waited for others to join. During this time, communication occurred between the host’s laptop and the Zoom MMR server using one TCP control connection (port 443) and three separate UDP connections for audio, video, and screen-sharing (data), respectively. All media traffic was sent to the MMR server on UDP port 8801, with periodic keep-alive packets when idle. TCP is used to manage the session and handle chat messages.

When the second participant joined 6 minutes later, Zoom switched to peer-to-peer (P2P) mode. In P2P mode, all media traffic is delivered directly between the two participants using a single UDP connection with ephemeral ports at each end. The total bit rate in P2P mode fluctuated between 3 Mbps and 6 Mbps, with an average of 5 Mbps.

When the third participant joined 11 minutes later, Zoom switched back to server mode, with all traffic from each laptop being sent to the MMR server on UDP port 8801. In this mode, Zoom uses three UDP channels (with ephemeral ports at each client) to send audio, video, and screen-sharing data to each participant. The packet rates and sizes on each channel are distinct, enabling simple heuristics to identify the channels. These channels are color-coded in the graph: blue for video, orange for audio, green for screen-sharing data, and black for total UDP traffic volume. The total bit rate in this mode was about 3.5 Mbps, higher than the 1.0–1.5 Mbps rate reported for free-tier Zoom [3, 10]. As evident from the graph, video accounts for most of the UDP traffic.

Other observations from Figure 1(a) include:
- The overall packet rate decreased when switching from P2P mode to server mode, likely due to bandwidth management techniques.
- When the third participant left, Zoom did not switch back to P2P mode but remained in central server mode for the remainder of the session.
- When screen-sharing occurred (at the 20-minute mark), the video bit rate was dynamically reduced until screen-sharing ended.
- Two upward spikes suggest that Zoom uses dynamic bandwidth probing to adapt the video bit rate during the session. Each spike represents a higher packet rate from the MMR server for 10 seconds.
- The TCP control connection (red) lasted throughout the Zoom session, regardless of the number of participants.

### 4.2. Zoom Session Profiles
In addition to time-series plots, we construct session profiles to visualize Zoom session structure and identify performance anomalies.
