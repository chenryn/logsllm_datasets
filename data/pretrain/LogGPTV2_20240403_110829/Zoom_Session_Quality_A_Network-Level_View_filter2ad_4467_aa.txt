Abstract. Zoom is a popular videoconferencing application for remote
work and learning. In 2020, our university adopted Zoom for delivering
online lectures during work-from-home restrictions. Starting in September
2021, however, our university oﬀered both in-person and online classes,
leading to increased Zoom usage on our campus network. In this paper,
we study this Zoom network traﬃc in two diﬀerent ways. First, we per-
form small-scale active measurements on individual Zoom test sessions to
understand communication patterns and traﬃc structure. Second, we use
large-scale passive measurement of campus-level Zoom traﬃc to under-
stand usage patterns and performance problems. Our results identify 4x
growth in Zoom traﬃc on our campus network since 2020, as well as
network-related issues that aﬀect Zoom session quality.

1 Introduction
Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, Zoom has become the
primary platform for online learning at many universities worldwide, including
the University of Calgary. Zoom grew signiﬁcantly as a video conferencing plat-
form during the pandemic, due to its ease of use, and the ability to host meetings
with a large number of participants [2,17].
In September 2021, our university began to transition back to in-person learn-
ing for 50% of its courses. Many students who enrolled for in-person classes also
had Zoom-based online lectures for other courses. Due to course scheduling, this
situation often required students to be on campus for their online classes, which
signiﬁcantly increased Zoom traﬃc on our campus network, and led to several
anecdotal reports of Zoom performance problems.
In this paper, we describe our approach for studying Zoom network traﬃc
on campus, and our results from analyzing this network traﬃc. Our work is
motivated by fairly broad questions such as how large the Zoom user community
is on campus and the number of classes being joined by students while on campus.
The data that we collect and analyze also gives insights into the behaviours of
students when joining Zoom sessions from on campus, such as when and for how
long they join Zoom sessions, and whether they use their camera or microphone.
We are also interested in the user-level Quality of Experience (QoE) for Zoom

sessions. Our results provide a better understanding of how Zoom is used on our
campus network, and identify several network performance issues.
Our main contributions include tools for analyzing empirical Zoom network
traﬃc data, as well as insights regarding Zoom session quality from a network-
level perspective. Our results quantify the performance of Zoom with respect to
bandwidth usage and QoE. Table 1 summarizes our main observations, which
are discussed more fully in the rest of the paper.

2 Related Work
Several prior works have studied pandemic eﬀects on Internet traﬃc, including
enterprise networks [1,5], ISP networks [7], mobile networks [9], and academic
environments [4,15]. Here we highlight selected papers from the literature.
Feldmann et al. [5] studied pandemic eﬀects on Internet traﬃc, as viewed by
ISPs, IXPs, and mobile network operators. They identiﬁed 15–20% growth in
Internet traﬃc volumes within a week of the lockdowns taking place in Europe.
Their paper identiﬁed new network applications being used in work-from-home
environments, including Zoom and Teams, that contributed to the traﬃc growth.
Our study focuses speciﬁcally on Zoom in a campus setting, with an emphasis
on network-level and application-level performance.
Favale et al. [4] studied changes to network traﬃc induced by the COVID-
19 pandemic in an academic setting. The traﬃc patterns were observed from
Politecnico di Torino, a medium-sized university located in Italy. Their study
diﬀers from ours in that the online e-learning platform studied was not Zoom,
but rather a custom in-house solution developed based on the BigBlueButton
framework. The authors found that incoming traﬃc was greatly reduced across
three university campuses that were studied, since few students were on campus

to generate inbound traﬃc. For the campus that hosted the e-learning platform,
however, the outbound network traﬃc more than doubled. While their university
did not adopt Zoom at all, many universities did. Thus our results should be
broadly applicable for many Zoom users in academic environments.
Two recent papers [3,10] studied videoconferencing applications, including
Zoom. Chang et al. [3] developed a cloud-based framework for testing and com-
paring the QoE for Meet, WebEx, and Zoom. Their work used emulated clients
in the cloud to identify QoE diﬀerences for these three applications, based on
architecture, infrastructure, geographic location, lag, video bit rate, and network
bandwidth constraints. They used free-tier versions of these applications, and
real mobile devices, in meetings with up to 11 emulated participants. MacMillan
et al. [10] compared Meet, Teams, and Zoom in an experimental testbed. Their
work focused on network utilization, robustness, and fairness [14] between and
among these videoconferencing applications under diﬀerent emulated network
conditions. They also studied the scaling properties of these applications with
up to 8 participants. Our work diﬀers from both of these papers in that we focus
on developing tools to analyze empirically-observed Zoom sessions generated by
thousands of users on our campus network. Our companion paper [6] provides a
longitudinal (macroscopic) view of Zoom, Teams, Meet, VPN, and other appli-
cations on our campus network during the pandemic; here, we provide a detailed
(microscopic) look at Zoom.
There are also several Zoom-speciﬁc papers that focus on privacy and secu-
rity issues [11,12], rather than network performance or QoE. Marczak and Scott-
Railton [12] studied Zoom network traﬃc to investigate potential security vul-
nerabilities with the platform. Mahr et al. [11] analyzed the types of data that
Zoom sends in either encrypted or unencrypted form. In our paper, we focus on
the network traﬃc patterns and application-level performance of Zoom.
3 Methodology
Our work uses a combination of active and passive approaches to network traﬃc
measurement. We use the resulting data to study on-campus Zoom sessions from
both network-level and application-level perspectives.
We ﬁrst analyze Zoom traﬃc at a small-scale to extract insights regarding
communication patterns. We do so using Wireshark [16] for a packet-level view
of Zoom test sessions under our control. Although all Zoom traﬃc is encrypted,
we can still obtain useful information regarding the Zoom application, such as
IP addresses and port numbers, session structure, and bandwidth consumption.
Data collection is done using Windows and Linux laptops. Wireshark is used
to capture packets locally during Zoom test sessions. Data collection is done in
a controlled environment where we are the only users in a Zoom session. Our
active measurements only involve users who opted in for data collection.
Using knowledge from the small-scale experiments, we subsequently analyze
campus-wide Zoom traﬃc at our university, which has approximately 35,000
students, faculty, and staﬀ, and a 10 Gbps external connection to the Internet.
The campus-level traﬃc data consists of summarized traﬃc logs from our campus
558

network monitor (Endace DAG; Dell PowerEdge running Zeek). The connection
logs provide detailed information about each observed connection, such as start
time, protocol endpoints, bytes/packets transferred, and connection duration
(see Appendix A for an example). These logs are collected in cooperation with
our campus IT staﬀ, and with permission obtained via our campus research
ethics review process. We conduct TCP/IP traﬃc analysis using packet headers
only (no payloads), focusing on aggregate traﬃc characteristics from thousands
of users, most of whom use transient IP addresses from DHCP/NAT.
We collect our passive measurement data from a mirrored stream of all traﬃc
that passes through the campus edge router. This means that we can observe
all traﬃc that has at least one endpoint on the campus network and at least
one endpoint on the Internet. In particular, Zoom traﬃc is observable when
students or instructors on campus connect to a Zoom server. We identify Zoom
traﬃc based on the 118 IPv4 network preﬁxes1 indicated on the Zoom Web site.
We also use information about the Zoom connection process2 and local DNS
logs to distinguish Zoom MultiMedia Routers (MMR) from other Zoom server
types (e.g., API, CDN, logging, Web, XMPP, Zone Controller).
4 Small-Scale Measurements
This section presents results from our small-scale measurements of Zoom test
sessions using Wireshark. The purpose is to understand the structure of Zoom
traﬃc, and enable Zoom analysis using our campus-level connection logs.
4.1 Zoom Session Structure
Our ﬁrst experiment3 focused on the structure of a Zoom test session that lasted
about 45 min. The meeting host was on campus, using the university-licensed
version of Zoom on a wireless laptop. The second participant was on their own
laptop at home. A third participant joined the meeting late, and then left early.
Figure 1(a) shows a time-series plot of the packet traﬃc during this Zoom
test session, based on the Wireshark trace. After launching the meeting, the host
waited for others to join. During this time, communication took place between
the host’s laptop and the Zoom MMR server, using one TCP control connection
(port 443), and three separate UDP connections4 for audio, video, and screen-
sharing (data), respectively. All media traﬃc was sent to the MMR server on
UDP port 8801, with periodic keep-alive packets when idle. TCP is used to
manage the session, and handle any chat messages5 sent during the meeting.

3 Other experiments tested diﬀerent features (e.g., camera, microphone, chat, screen-
sharing, waiting room) to learn more about Zoom, similar to the approach in [8].
See Appendix B for two additional examples of such sessions.
4 Though UDP is connectionless, we refer to these as UDP connections or channels.
5 Documents sent via chat use a separate TCP connection to an XMPP server.

When the second participant joined 6 min later, Zoom switched into peer-
to-peer (P2P) mode (shown in purple). In this mode (P), all media traﬃc is
delivered directly between the two participants using a single UDP connection
with ephemeral ports at each end [3]. However, the TCP control (C) connection
to the MMR server remained in place. The total bit rate in P2P mode ﬂuctuated
between 3 Mbps and 6 Mbps, with an average of 5 Mbps.
When the third participant joined 11 min later, Zoom switched back into
server mode, with all traﬃc from each laptop being sent to the MMR server on
UDP port 8801. In this mode, Zoom uses three UDP channels (with ephemeral
ports at each client) to send audio, video, and screen-sharing data to each par-
ticipant. The packet rates and sizes on each channel are quite distinctive (see
the CDF plots in Fig. 1(b) and (c)), enabling simple heuristics6 to identify the
channels. These channels are colour-coded in the graph with blue for video (V),
orange for audio (A), green for screen-sharing data (D), and black for total UDP
traﬃc volume (T). The total bit rate in this mode was about 3.5 Mbps, substan-
tially higher than the 1.0–1.5 Mbps rate reported for free-tier Zoom [3,10]. As
is evident from the graph, video accounts for most of the UDP traﬃc observed.

Several other observations are evident from Fig. 1(a). First, the overall packet
rate decreased when switching from P2P mode to Zoom server mode, likely
reﬂecting bandwidth management techniques used by the server. Second, when
the third participant leaves, Zoom does not switch back into P2P mode; rather, it
stays in central server mode for the remainder of the session. Third, when screen-
sharing happens (at 20-min mark), the video bit rate is dynamically reduced
until screen-sharing is complete. Fourth, the two upward spikes suggest that
Zoom uses dynamic bandwidth probing to adapt the video bit rate during the
session. Each spike represents a higher packet rate from the MMR server for 10
s. Finally, the TCP control connection (red) lasts throughout the Zoom session,
regardless of the number of participants.
4.2 Zoom Session Proﬁles
In addition to time-series plots of packet traﬃc, we construct session proﬁles to
visualize Zoom session structure and identify performance anomalies.
