Question: "A hardware engineering team is tasked with designing a security-sensitive module for a new system. They are aware of the risks posed by single-event upsets (SEUs) to the system's operation, especially when the system is deployed in environments with high levels of cosmic radiation. Which of the following design strategies should the team consider implementing to mitigate the risk of SEUs compromising the security guarantees of the module?"
 "A": "Incorporate parity bits for each word in SRAM to allow error detection and correction."
 "B": "Implement triple-modular redundancy around security-sensitive modules."
 "C": "Replace SRAMs storing security-critical data with non-volatile memory types to prevent bit flips."
 "D": "Utilize Error-Correcting Codes (ECC) and Address Interleaving for SRAMs storing security-critical data."
Answer: BD
