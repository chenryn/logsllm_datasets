# Bug report
Webpack supports the `browser` alias but it doesn't apply it to exports map.
**What is the current behavior?**
This pattern is supported
    {
    	"main": "./index.js",
    	"browser": "./browser.js"
    }
but this pattern isn't:
    {
    	"exports": {
    		".": "./index.js",
    		"./browser": "./browser.js"
    	}
    }
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**
You can check out this folder: https://github.com/fregante/webpack-
sandbox/tree/main/exports-browser
It also includes the webpack output (log and dist)
This is part of the output file that demoes which of the 2 files are imported
for the "exports map" and "old style" imports respectively:
    (() => {
    	var e = {
    			507: () => {
    				console.log('field: exports["."]');
    			},
    			933: () => {
    				console.log('field: browser');
    			},
    		},
    		r = {};
    [clipped]
**What is the expected behavior?**
`exports.browser` should be picked up just like `browser` is
