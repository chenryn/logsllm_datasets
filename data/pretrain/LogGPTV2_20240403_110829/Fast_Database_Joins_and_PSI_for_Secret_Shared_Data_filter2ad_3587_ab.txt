2.4 Cuckoo Hash Tables
The core data structure that our protocols employ is a cuckoo hash table which is
parameterized by a capacity n, two (or more) hash functions h0, h1 and a vector T
which has m = O(n) slots, T [1], ..., T [m]. For any x that has been added to the hash
table, there is an invariant that x will be located at T [h0(x)] or T [h1(x)]. Testing if
an x is in the hash table therefore only requires inspecting these two locations. x is
added to the hash table by inserting x into slot T [hi(x)] where i ∈ {0, 1} is picked
at random. If there is an existing item at this slot, the old item y is removed and
reinserted at its other hash function location. Typically the required table size is
m ≈ 1.6n for λ = 40 bits of statistical security, see [DRRT18].
3 Our Construction
3.1 Overview
First we describe our join algorithm without any privacy and then we will discuss
how this translates to the secret shared setting. Figure 1 depicts our algorithm with
the following phases:
1. Y is inserted into a cuckoo hash table T based on the join-key(s). That is, let
us assume the columns Y1 and X1 are the join keys. Then row Y [i] is inserted
at T [j] for some j ∈ {h0(Y1[i]), h1(Y1[i])}.

construct output row.
Figure 1: Overview of the join protocol using oblivious switching network.
2. Each row X[i] needs to be compared with the rows T [j] for j ∈ {h0(X1[i]), h1(X1[i])}.
As such, T [h0(X1[i])] is mapped to a new row (cid:98)Y 0[i] and T [h1(X1[i]) to (cid:98)Y 1[i].
be located at (cid:98)Y 0[i] or (cid:98)Y 1[i]. As such, these rows can directly be compared to
3. It is now the case that if row X[i] has a machining key in Y , then this row will
determine if there is a match on the join keys and the where clause evaluates
to true. Let bi = 1 if there is such a match and 0 otherwise.
4. Various types of joins can then be constructed from locally comparing row i
from these tables, i.e. X[i],(cid:98)Y 0[i],(cid:98)Y 1[i]. For example, an inner join is con-
either (cid:98)Y 0[i] or (cid:98)Y 1[i] depending on which one matches. If there is no match,
structed from all the rows where bi = 1 by selecting the values from X[i] and
then that output row is set to NULL.
The main challenge in bringing the described algorithm to the secret shared
setting is constructing the cuckoo hash table T and selecting rows from T with-
out leaking sensitive information. We achieve this with the use an MPC friendly
randomized encoding and a new three-party protocol called an oblivious switching
network.
Let us continue to assume that the columns X1 and Y1 are the join-keys. Our
protocol begins by generating a randomized encoding for each of the secret shared
this encoding which takes secret shares from the parties, apply a PRF Fk to the
reconstructed value using a internally sampled key k, and returns the resulting value
join-key (cid:74)xi(cid:75) ∈(cid:74)X1(cid:75) and (cid:74)yi(cid:75) ∈(cid:74)Y1(cid:75). Figure 2 contains the ideal functionality for
to one of the three parties. For (cid:74)xi(cid:75) :=(cid:74)X1(cid:75)[i], P0 will learn Fk(xi) while P1 will
learn Fk(yi) for(cid:74)yi(cid:75) :=(cid:74)Y1(cid:75)[i]. Since the join-keys xi (resp. yi) are unique and k is
Party P1 proceeds by constructing a secret shared cuckoo hash tableT from
the rows of (cid:74)Y(cid:75) where the hash function values for row i are deﬁned as hj(yi) =
secret shared cuckoo tableT such that row Y [i] is located at T [hj(yi)] for some
H(j||Fk(yi)). Note that P1 knows only the randomized encodings Fk(yi) of each row

In particular, assuming we use two
cuckoo hash functions, then P0 constructs two oblivious switching networks that
how such a network operates is discussed later but the result is two new tables

not even the cardinality of the join is revealed due to the use of NULL rows.
ality takes as input several tuples ((cid:74)Bi(cid:75),(cid:74)Xi(cid:75), Pi) where Bi ∈ {0, 1}d is an array of
3.2 Randomized Encodings
The randomized encoding functionality Fencode of Figure 2 enables the parties to
coordinate their secret shares without revealing the underlying values. In particular,
the parties will construct a cuckoo hash table using these encodings. The function-
d bits, Xi ∈ ({0, 1}σ)d is a array of d strings and Pi that denotes that party Pi
should be output the encodings for this tuple. The functionality assigns a random
(cid:96) bit encoding for each input x ∈ {0, 1}σ. For j ∈ [d], if the bit Bi[j] = 0 then the
functionality outputs the encoding for Xi[j] and otherwise a random (cid:96) bit string.
Looking forward, Bi[j] = 1 will mean that the key Xi[j] is actually set to NULL and
a random encoding should be returned.
LowMC Encodings. We realize this functionality using the LowMC block cipher[ARS+15].
When implemented with the honest majority MPC protocols[AFL+16], this ap-
proach results in extremely high throughput, computing up to one million encodings
per second. Once the parties have their secret shared inputs, they sample a secret

shared LowMC key uniformly and encrypt each input under that key using the MPC
protocol. These encryptions are revealed as the encodings to the appropriate party.
The LowMC cipher is parameterized by a block size (cid:96), keys size κ, s-boxes per
layer m and the desired data complexity d. To set these parameters, observe that the
adversary only sees a bounded number of block cipher outputs (encodings) per key.
As such, the data complexity can be bounded by this value. For our implementation
we upper bound the number of outputs by d = 230. The remaining parameters are
set to be (cid:96) ∈ {80, 100} and m = 14 which results in r = 13 rounds and computational
security of κ = 128 bits[ARS+15]. The circuit for (cid:96) = 80 contains 546 and gates
(meaning each party will send only 546 bits per encoding).
One issue with the LowMC approach alone is that the input size is ﬁxed to
be at most (cid:96) ∈ {80, 100} bits. However, we will see that the larger join protocol
requires an arbitrary input size σ. This is accommodated by applying a universal
hash function to the input shares. Speciﬁcally, the parties jointly pick a random
matrix E ← {0, 1}σ×(cid:96). The parties can then locally multiply each secret shared
input before it is sent into the LowMC block cipher.
The security of this transformation follows from xE (cid:54)= x(cid:48)E with overwhelming
probability if x (cid:54)= x(cid:48). In particular, f (x) = xE is a universal hash function given
that E is independent of x. As such the probability that f (x) = f (x(cid:48)) for any x (cid:54)= x(cid:48)
is 2−(cid:96). Applying the birthday bound we obtain that probability of any collisions
i di is
among the tuples is 2−(cid:96)+p where p = log2 D2/2 = 2 log2(D) − 1 and D =(cid:80)
the total number of encodings.
Conditioned on the inputs to the block cipher being unique, the outputs of the
block cipher is also distinct and indistinguishable from random (cid:96) bit strings. As
such, in the simulation the real outputs can be replaced with that of the ideal
functionality so long as 2−(cid:96)+p is statistically negligible, i.e. (cid:96) − p ≥ λ.
3.3 Oblivious Switching Network
The ideal functionality of a switching network was introduced by Mohassel and
Sadeghian[MS13]. It obliviously transform a vector A = (A1, ..., An) such that the
output is A(cid:48) = (Aπ(1), ..., Aπ(m)) for an arbitrary function π : [m] → [n]. The ac-
companying protocol of [MS13] was designed in the two party setting where the ﬁrst
party inputs A while the second party inputs a description of π. We introduce a

(a) Uniformly sample a key k for a LowMC cipher with block size (cid:96), security κ
and data complexity at least d blocks.

each call.

new oblivious switching network protocol tailored for the honest majority setting
with signiﬁcantly eﬃciency improves. Our protocol has O(n) overhead and is con-
stant round. [MS13] requires O(n log nκ) communication/computation and O(log n)
rounds.
The ideal functionality of our protocol is given in Figure 4 with three parties, a
programmer Pp, a sender Ps and a receiver Pr. Pp has a description of π while Pp,Ps
have a secret sharing of a vector A ∈ Σn where Σ = {0, 1}σ. Pp and Pr are each
output a share ofA(cid:48) s.t. A(cid:48) = (Aπ(1), ..., Aπ(m)). For ease of presentation, we will
initially assume A is the private input of Ps.
Permutation Network. We begin with a restricted class of switching networks where
the programming function π is injective. That is, each input element Ai will be
mapped to a maximum1 of one location in the output A(cid:48). As we will see later, this
property will simplify the implementation since we do not need to duplicate any
element. Intuitively, the Permute protocol of Figure 5 instructs Ps to ﬁrst shuﬄed
A in a random order (as speciﬁed by π0) and then secret share it between Pp & Pr.
1Strictly speaking, this protocol implementation a generalization of a permutation network since
it allows some elements to not appear in the output, i.e. m < n and π : [m] → [n].
11
Then Pp & Pr will reorder these shares (as speciﬁed by π1) to be in the desired order
(i.e. π). This is done as follows, Pp samples two random functions π0, π1 such that
π1 ◦ π0 = π, π0 : [n] → [n] is bijective and π1 : [m] → [n] is injective. Pp sends π1 to
Pr and π0, S ← Σn to Ps who sends B := (Aπ0(1) ⊕ S0, ..., Aπ0(n) ⊕ Sn) to Pr. The
ﬁnal shares of A(cid:48) = π(A) are deﬁned as Pp holdingA(cid:48)0 := (Sπ1(1), ..., Sπ1(m)) and
the Pr holdingA(cid:48)1 := (Bπ1(1), ..., Bπ1(m)).
The simulation of this protocol is perfect. The view of Ps contains a uniform
permutation π0 and vector S. Similarly, the view of Pr contains π1 which is uniformly
distributed (when π0 is unobserved) and the uniform vector B. See Section B.1 for
details. In our computational secure setting, π0, S can be generated locally by Pp
and Ps using a common source of randomness, e.g. a seeded PRG. This reduces the
rounds to 1.
Shared Inputs. As presented here in the text our protocols assume the input vector
A being transformed is the private input of the Ps. However, the full protocols
will require the input A to secret shared. Let us assume we have some switching
network protocol Π which takes input A from Ps, π from Pp and output shares
of π(A). Then this can be transform to shared inputA. The parties invoke Π
where Ps input their share A1 and Pp inputs π. Pp and Pr receive B from
the functionality. The ﬁnal result can then be computed as Pr holding A(cid:48)1 :=
B1 while Pp locally deﬁnesA(cid:48)0 :=B0 ⊕ π(A0). It is easy to verify that
A(cid:48) = π(A1)⊕ π(A0) = π(A). The protocol descriptions in Figure 5 include this
shared input modiﬁcation. However, here in the text we will continue to assume A
is the sole input of Ps.
Duplication Network.
The Duplication protocol of Figure 5 considers a second type of restricted net-
work where π : [n] → [n], s.t. π(1) = 1 and π(i) ∈ {i, π(i − 1)} for i = 2, ..., n. That
is, each output position is either a copy of the same input position (i.e. π(i) = i)
or is a duplicate of the previous output position (i.e. π(i) = π(i − 1)). For ex-
ample, let the truth table of π be (π(1), ..., π(6)) = (1, 1, 3, 4, 4, 4) and therefore
A(cid:48) = (A1, A1, A3, A4, A4, A4). Note the only change is that A1, A4 were duplicated
into the next position(s). This transformation can be characterized by a vector
b ∈ {0, 1}n where bi = 1 denotes that the output position i should be a copy of
output position i − 1, i.e. b = (0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1) for the example above. Therefore we
get the relation A(cid:48)
i−1 for i ∈ [2, n].
i = biAi ⊕ biA(cid:48)
As a warm-up, let us ﬁx some index i and consider the simpler relation where
i = biAi ⊕ biAi−1,
A(cid:48)
i is either Ai or Ai−1 and not A(cid:48)
i.e. A(cid:48)
i−1 as described before. Conceptually, we
will implement this using an OT-like protocol with OT messages (Ai, Ai−1) and
select-bit bi. Ps samples three uniform strings A(cid:48)
