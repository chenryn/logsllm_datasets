Hi there,
I installed 1.3 yesterday and my application no longer compiles correctly.
Here's an example:
**TS Input**  
import a = require("../dir1/file1");  
import MongoClient = require('mongodb');  
import b = require('../dir1/file2');  
import c = require("../dir2/file1");
**JS Output**  
var c = require("../dir2/file1");
For some reason three of the four lines did not make it into the JS file. All
worked fine before I installed the new TypeScript.
Any thoughts?
