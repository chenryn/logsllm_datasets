**ATT&CK ID:** T1110  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Brute Force

Adversaries may employ brute force techniques to gain unauthorized access to accounts when the passwords are unknown or when password hashes have been obtained. In cases where the adversary does not know the password for a specific account or set of accounts, they may systematically attempt to guess the password using automated and iterative methods. 

Brute force attacks can be conducted in two primary ways:
1. **Online Brute Force:** The adversary interacts directly with a service (e.g., a login page) that checks the validity of the provided credentials. This method is often slower due to rate limiting and account lockout policies.
2. **Offline Brute Force:** The adversary attempts to crack previously acquired credential data, such as password hashes, without interacting with the service. This method can be faster and more efficient, as it bypasses the rate limits and security controls imposed by the service.

Both methods aim to discover valid credentials through repeated and systematic guessing, potentially leading to unauthorized access if successful.
