## Motivation and Purpose
- **Objective:** To learn and teach methods for developing tools.
- **Introduction:** Introduce toolsmithing to those interested in tool development.
- **Discussion:** Share our experiences from implementing the idabridge tool.
- **Release:** Present an Alpha version of our idabridge.

## Toolsmithing Overview
- **Definition:** Toolsmithing is the process of creating tools that can be used in various domains.
- **Characteristics:**
  - Not typically standalone applications.
  - Ranges from simple scripts to comprehensive libraries.
  - Focuses on utility rather than usability.
  - Often takes the form of "X is needed to make Y" or "Z needs to be built, but nothing exists currently."

## Toolsmithing Tools
- **High-Level Languages:** Python, Ruby
- **Programming Environments:** iPython
- **Debuggers:** PDB, WinDbg, Olly, etc.
- **Network Sniffers:** For network debugging
- **Resources:** Books, code repositories, and other available resources
- **Principle:** Use whatever gets the job done quickly and efficiently.

## Our Toolsmithing Process
- **Building is Believing:**
  - Good tools take time to develop.
  - Iterative development (e.g., idabridge's command handling took three iterations).
  - Build to meet current needs.
- **Loner Development Squads:**
  - Create small, manageable milestones.
  - Keep a supportive friend on speed dial.
  - Write concise and reusable code.
- **The World is Bigâ€¦ Chances are it Exists:**
  - Leverage open-source projects.
  - Review and repurpose existing code.
  - Use real-world examples.
  - Implement complex components by building on existing solutions (e.g., using BIND for DNS).

## Introducing Idabridge
- **Description:** An extensible network listener for IDA Pro.
- **Features:**
  - Provides remote control capabilities for IDA users.
  - Implements an asynchronous network listener.
  - Offers extensibility through a Python class.
  - Aims to serve as a middleware layer for other tools such as binary diffing, debuggers, and frameworks like Radare.

## Current State of Things
- **Trends:**
  - Users are moving towards cloud-based solutions.
  - Increased collaboration among analysts and users.
  - Federation of data across different environments.
  - Heterogeneous tool chains.
  - Cool tools developed within closed environments may not be widely available.

## Goals and Challenges
- **Investigate:**
  - Cloud-based reversing tools.
  - Feasibility of a middleware for our current tools.
- **Determine:**
  - Which tools will make a significant difference.
  - Future direction for supporting technologies (e.g., cloud-based Python interpreters, migration of binaries and environments for analysis).

## Idabridge Components
- **IDA Pro Networking Client**
- **WinDbg Network Server**
- **Python Environment Exported from IDAPython**
- **Command Handler for Debuggers and IDA Pro:**
  - VDB/Vtrace
  - WinDbg
  - IDA Pro

## Tools Used for Development
- **Visual Studio for C/C++ on Windows:**
  - IDE for debugging and development.
- **iPython & Python:**
  - Scripting for code and class creation.
  - Functional code testing.
  - Data manipulation and verification.
  - Server mock-ups for initial command handling.

## Development Environments
- **Windows 7, 64-bit:**
  - Visual Studio 2010
  - iPython
- **Windows XP VM, 32-bit:**
  - Visual Studio 2010
  - Other necessary tools

## Overall Lessons Learned
- **Debugging Debuggers:**
  - Writing scripts to implement code.
  - Parsing IDAPython APIs.
  - Implementing Python command handlers.
  - Writing long logic C++ statements.
  - Creating stub functions.

## Toolsmithing: Research Phase
- **Initial Research and Development: 90 Hours**
  - Researching code and capabilities (IDA Pro and WinDbg).
  - Learning APIs and their usage.
  - Planning, testing, and adjusting.
  - Created a GUI to simulate a debugger.
  - Implemented IDA commands manually using C++.
  - Developed separate command handling on different platforms.
  - Focused on getting things working.

## Toolsmithing: Phase 2
- **Development: 60 Hours (2 weeks)**
  - Developed an abstract command handler based on names.
  - Included typed argument marshaling (str, int, long, byte).
  - Combined the network stack and handling.
  - Realized the need for better command handling.
  - Combined source and functionality.

## Toolsmithing: Command Handler
- **Development: 30 Hours (1.5 weeks)**
  - Developed the abstract handler.
  - Added IDAPython bridge.
- **Development: 20 Hours**
  - Added Python as the main command handling.
  - Co-developed Vtrace/VDB command handling.

## Idabridge Demonstration

## Conclusions
- **Key Attributes:**
  - Creativity, patience, persistence, and tenacity.
  - Small milestones drive motivation.
  - Expectations are limited by the time frame.
  - Tool code quality differs from production code quality.
