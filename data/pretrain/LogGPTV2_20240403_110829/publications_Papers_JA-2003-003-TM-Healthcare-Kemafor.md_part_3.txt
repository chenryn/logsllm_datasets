The tracking subsystem involves reminding parents and guardians about shots that are
due or overdue and informing field workers about children who have not been receiving
their immunizations.
Additionally, health agencies can use the available data to generate reports (for
submissions to authorities such as the DSS and State Government) and to determine the
health needs of the state.

The development of the application was completed with constraints due to end-user and
system requirements. Some of the important requirements for this application, as
determined by CHREF, include:
• Support for a distributed client/server-based architecture in a heterogeneous
computing environment. This distribution should be transparent to users;
• Support for inter- and intra- enterprise wide coordination of tasks;
• Provision of a standard user-friendly interface for all users of the system (see Figure
4-5);
• Support for a variety of tasks: transactional, non-transactional, human, and
application;
• Capability to use existing DBMS infrastructure across organizations;
• Low cost of the system acquisition and deployment for the providers and user
organizations;
• Ease of use, modification (re-design), scalability, extensibility, and fast design-to-
implementation;
• Use of standards, including EDI, for interactions among autonomous organizations,
where possible;

• Security authorization for users and secure communication (required, as patient data
is typically confidential).

Figure 4-6. Implementation test-bed for the Immunization Tracking application
Based on these requirements, we have created a system test-bed on which the application
was implemented (Figure 4-6). The system included a heterogeneous and distributed
infrastructure, with multiple Web servers, CORBA servers, and multiple databases. The
workflow involves 13 tasks, including tasks for the admit clerk, triage nurse, and for the
eligibility check. Autonomous software systems and heterogeneous computer platforms
were running in Georgia and in Connecticut; these included Solaris 2.4, Windows/NT, as
well as Windows95, and five databases on two DBMS (Illustra and Oracle).
The workflow application system supports the maintenance of several central
databases:
• The Master Patient Index (MPI) records the personal information and medical history
of patients;
• The Master Encounter Index (MEI) records brief information pertaining to each
encounter of each patient, at any hospital or clinic in the state;
• An Immunization Database (IMM) records information regarding each immunization
performed for a person in the MPI;
• Eligibility databases (ELG) provide an insurance company’s patient eligibility data;
and
• The Detailed Encounter databases (ENC) provide detailed encounter information, as
well as relevant data for each patient served by a particular provider.
The application design and implementation calls for CHREF to manage the MPI,
MEI, and the IMM centralized databases for the state of Connecticut. The ELG database,
containing data provided by insurance companies, is used in this application for EDI-

based eligibility verification, using the ANSI X12 standard. In particular, Web-based
access is used to submit eligibility inquiries using ANSI 270, and responses are received
using ANSI 271 transactions. Each participating provider organization (each hospital or
clinic) has its own ENC database. When a structured database is used at CHREF, we
promote the use of ODBC compliant DBMS. The DBMSs (Illustra and Oracle) used in
this application are ODBC compliant.
5 Benefits of the METEOR Approach
METEOR offers unique solutions to realize the promise of recent advances in distributed
computing infrastructure, middleware, and Web technologies. By quickly integrating
applications and information systems to support complex and dynamic business process
management, METEOR provides technical advantages that distinguish it from other
systems. These distinctions are outlined in Table 5-1 for the applications discussed in
Section 4.

6 Conclusion
Based on the deployment of real-world workflows, we have drawn a set of requirements
for workflow systems supporting healthcare applications. Today’s healthcare processes
require capabilities for mission-critical workflow support and enterprise integration.
Indispensable features include the seamless deployment over networked and
heterogeneous server platforms; rapid deployment of applications; ease of integration of
legacy/existing applications; high scalability and performance; specification, analysis,
and monitoring of quality of service metrics; and adaptation to changes.
While comprehensive solutions encompassing these features are lacking in many of
the current generation of workflow systems, the METEOR system distinguishes itself by
focusing on supporting these high-end requirements.
The METEOR approach enables a rapid design-to-development via automatic code
generation. The workflow model and enactment system support a variety of indispensable
activities – user and application (automated) tasks – to be used in real-world
organizational processes. The workflow engines support heterogeneous and distributed
computing environments. This allows workflow process and data to be distributed within
and across enterprises. Reliability is an inherent part of the WfMS infrastructure; it
includes support for error handling and recovery by exploiting transaction management
features. A well-defined hierarchical error-model is used for capturing and defining
logical errors, and a recovery framework provides support for the detection and recovery
of workflow system components in the event of failure. The system also supports a
dynamic change interface, QoS management, and a case-based reasoning subsystem to
effectively handle exceptions.
