I tried following the official docker based local cluster setup guide here on
OSX and it fails to work in the case of v1.2.
There are several issues. Enumerating a few of them.
  * API server is not accessible from outside of the docker VM host.
  * Image garbage collection fails
  * Problem with nsinit - #19069 might solve this.
  * Volumes cleanup - #22911
  * Master node setup is racy - #23197
Some of the issues above are common to other linux based platforms too. This
issue will serve as an umbrella issue for getting hyperkube functional soon.
