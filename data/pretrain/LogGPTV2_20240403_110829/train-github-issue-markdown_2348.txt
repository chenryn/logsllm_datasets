# What / Why
`npm install` fails to resolve two version ranges of one dependency into a
version that is compatible with both requirements.
I have to use the unsafe `--legacy-peer-deps` flag to bypass this error.
## When
I try to add another package to a project with `"react": "^16.9.0"` I get a
conflict, even though the ranges are compatible (`peerDependencies` of the
package being installed is `"react": "^0.14.9 || >=15.3.0"`).
## How
### Current Behavior
When resolving peer dependencies, `npm` picks the latest available edge
version of `react` compatible with the installed `peerDependency`
requirements, which is `17.0.2` at the moment, ignoring the rest of the range.
And then fails with dependency version conflict.
### Steps to Reproduce
    mkdir peer-dependency-conflict-demo
    cd peer-dependency-conflict-demo
    npm add react@^16.9.0
    npm add react-bootstrap@=0.32.4

### Expected Behavior
NPM installs the requested package, knowing that the current installed version
of `react` is compatible with its peer requirements (`"react": "16.14.0"`
satisfies `^0.14.9 || >=15.3.0`).
