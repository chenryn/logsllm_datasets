 **Migrated issue, originally created by Dariusz GÃ³recki (@canni)**
Consider following example of joined-table inheritance:
    class Parent(DeclarativeBase):
        # ...
        parent_column = Column(String(255))
    class Child(Parent):
        # ...
        child_column = synonym('parent_column')
        @validates('child_column')  # @validates('parent_column') also does not work
        def validator(self, name, value):
            # not called at all
            raise ValueError()
The `validator` method is never called
