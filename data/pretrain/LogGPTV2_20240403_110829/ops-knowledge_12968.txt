User: some months ago, I installed Python 2.7 on my laptop (my os is Windows 7). 
After, I decided to use Python xy 2.7.3 instead of 'pure' Python; so, as suggested, I removed Python 2.7 and tried to install Python xy 2.7.3. However, when I tried to run the .exe file for installation, a warning window appears telling me that Python 2.7 is already installed on my computer. I tried to install a different version of Python xy (2.6) and everything went fine; however, I'd really prefer to use the latest version of Python xy. 
Actually, I can't figure out what went wrong whie uninstalling Python 2.7; does someone have any clue?
I can tell you that I followed the 'normal' procedure for programm uninstalltion; control panel -> Programs -> Remove Program
Thanks in advance

Assistant: I faced this issue: I tried to uninstall the python and fresh install, reason my pip version issue was not getting resolved. So I deleted the python folder, removed python from system path, and when I tried to uninstall from "Uninstall a program" in control panel, it showed "Windows installation package" error window and could not clean uninstall. 
Solution what i found was: In the "Uninstall a program" select python and click repair. And then uninstall the python, it worked for me. Hope this helps and save some time.
 PS: I am pretty new to python, and any help correcting me would be appreciated.
