**Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST?** (choose one):
Bug report.
**Kubernetes version** (use `kubectl version`):
master.
**What happened** :
golang.org/x/net/context clashed with a dependency in my project because it
been vendored as source into the tree.
**What you expected to happen** :
I expected Kubernetes to use go_rules features for vendoring in WORKSPACE,
like so
new_go_repository(  
name = "org_golang_x_net",  
importpath="golang.org/x/net",  
commit="f4b625ec9b21d620bb5ce57f2dfc3e08ca97fce6"  
)
**How to reproduce it** (as minimally and precisely as possible):
Build a small project that imports Kubernetes as an external dependency like
this:
git_repository(  
name = "io_k8s_kubernetes",  
remote = "https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes",  
commit = "...",  
)
This allows use of the Kubernetes BUILD rules in the remote project. Then,
import golang.org/x/net as above and try to use it in a go_binary. The link
step will fail.
