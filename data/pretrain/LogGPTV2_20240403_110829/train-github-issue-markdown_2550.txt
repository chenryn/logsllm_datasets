    class Base {
      static getCorrectFoo(): any {
         return this;
      }
       static get foo(): any {
          return this;
       }
    }
    class Inherited extends Base {}
    Base.foo === Base;
    Base.getCorrectFoo() === Base;
    Inherited.foo === Base; /// Should be `Inherited`
    Inherited.getCorrectFoo() === Inherited;
I believe this is because the `foo` getter will be defined via
`Object.defineProperty(Base, {..})`, which hard-wires `this` to `Base` within
the getter, rather than binding as expected to `Inherited` in `Inherited.foo`.
