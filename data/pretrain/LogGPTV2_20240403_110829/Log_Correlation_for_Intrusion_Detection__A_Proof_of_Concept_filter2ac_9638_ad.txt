### Discussion

The results show that correlating logs can significantly enhance the detection of abnormal behavior, thereby improving the overall accuracy of the IDS. However, the "predict the next system call" method does not perform well for this particular problem, as normal traces already exhibit a high level of abnormal behavior, leading to an increased risk of false positives.

### Future Work

Further testing is needed to better understand the effects of multi-log correlation and the "predict the next system call" method. Specifically, we need to determine the optimal sequence size and sliding window size for post-processing. Additionally, it would be beneficial to test different methods for correlation and other data mining tools, such as RIPPER. Evaluating the use of different logs for the correlation process is also important.

Stream data mining techniques, which involve real-time data mining, could further enhance our work. Once the rules are generated, they can be applied on-the-fly, making the system more responsive and efficient.

### Conclusions

Correlating logs to discover intrusion attacks is essential for improving the effectiveness of IDSs. By analyzing and correlating information from multiple logs, IDSs can enhance the accuracy of their alarms. However, log correlation is not trivial due to the large number of entries in audit logs. Data mining techniques are necessary to extract useful information from background noise.

In this paper, we performed experiments to successfully correlate data from multiple logs in a laboratory setting for a specific case of anomaly detection (the Yaha virus). Our empirical results show improved IDS accuracy through the correlation of network log and system call information. Not only did we make abnormal traces more abnormal, making intrusions easier to detect, but we also reduced false positives by making normal traces more normal.
