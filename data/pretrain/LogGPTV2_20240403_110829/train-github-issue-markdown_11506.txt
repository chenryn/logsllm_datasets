When decorating `routing.loader` in a compiler pass I get the following
deprecation error when the container is built:
    User Deprecated: The "routing.loader" service is private, getting it from the container is deprecated since Symfony 3.2 and will fail in 4.0. You should either make the service public, or stop using the container directly and use dependency injection instead.
I can't figure out why this is happening.
