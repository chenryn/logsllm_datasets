I have encountered some performance issues with JAX version 0.2.26 and 0.2.27.
This has surfaced while running the TestU01 small-crush RNG testsuite against
the `jax.random` RNG as well as my own implementation in
https://github.com/DPBayes/jax-chacha-prng which run significantly slower than
in previous versions. Running JAX version 0.2.26 with JAXlib version 0.1.74
took me 30:47.50 minutes (close to that with JAX version 0.2.27). With JAX
version 0.2.25, same JAXlib version, took only 0:38.59 minutes.
I'm not sure what causes this and it's hard to track down. It could of course
be an issue in my wrapping code around the Python rngs as I haven't yet found
a simpler working example that demonstrates this behaviour. I'm trying to
narrow it down further, but wanted to ask whether anyone else has encountered
something similar or if there were any changes in JAX version 0.2.26 that I'm
not aware of and that could explain this.
Please:
  * Check for duplicate issues.
  * Provide a complete example of how to reproduce the bug, wrapped in triple backticks like this:  
As said above, I have not boiled this down to a simple complete example.
