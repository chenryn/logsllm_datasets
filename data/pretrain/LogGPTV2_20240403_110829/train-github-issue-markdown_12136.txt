  * VSCode Version: 1.00
  * OS Version: Win 10
Steps to Reproduce:
  1. Install node.js 6.0.0
  2. Try to debug within a router.get function.
    router.get("/:id", (req, res, next) => {
        controller.getSingle(req.params.id).then(data => res.json(data));
    });
When I add a breakpoint at the `controller.` call, the debugger stops when I'm
using node 5.11.0. It does not after upgrading to 6.0.0. The debugger stops
(so it notices a breakpoint), but it doesn't show the line where it stopped
anywhere.
Breakpoints outside of the express calls work fine by the way. So when I add a
breakpoint at the router.get, it works (but at the start of the application,
which is good, obviously).
Changing from () => to function() did not change anything.
