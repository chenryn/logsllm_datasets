tificates compared to RSA.
Combining these insights, in Figure 4 (third panel) we visualize
the relationship between signing algorithm, public key bit size &
type of the host server, and the corresponding certificate validity.
Certificates are highly likely to be valid when both CAs and hosts
use elliptic curve (EC) keys and signatures; e.g. 99% of websites

certificate issuer information encoded in their certificate, we ana-
lyze the remaining 50,443 hostnames. 19,781 (39.21%) of the sites
use a wildcard certificate and 4,486 (22.67%) of these are invalid.
We further use the EV policy OIDs in Mozilla’s certverifier to check
for policy strings corresponding to trusted EV certificates [58], and
find 2,145 (4.24%) EV certificate hostnames.
Figure 3: Certificates by issue and expiry date.
The leading cause for certificate invalidity is host name mis-
match, contributing to 36.6% of the invalid https certificates. Fur-
ther analysis of some of these mismatches follows in Section 5.3.3.
Errors in retrieving local issuer certificate and certificate self-
signing are the next most common. There are instances of govern-
ment hostnames both using expired certificates and having self-
signed certificates in the certificate chain, but this is less than 1%
of the hostnames considered. During our scans, 12.7% of the hosts
try to negotiate an unsupported SSL protocol (older than SSLv3.0),
indicating that the server might be running old unpatched software
potentially vulnerable to POODLE [56].
5.3.1 Certificate Issue Duration. Valid certificates were commonly
issued for a fixed duration of 2-3 years as agreed upon by the
CAs [13, 14]. Invalid certificates have a much wider spread in du-
ration (see Figure 3). We find 12,422 total invalid certificates due
to hostname mismatches, inability to get local issuer certificates,
leaf self-signed certificates, and those in the certificate chain along
with expired certificates (excluding those causing exceptions). Only

with-SHA256 attesting a 256-bit EC host public key are valid.
5.3.3 Host Public Key Pair Reuse. We notice that government web-
sites tend to reuse wildcard certificates across different hostnames
belonging to the same government, often incorrectly. One such cer-
tificate was shared across 102 hostnames in Bangladesh. However,
https was invalid on all of these sites because of hostname mis-
matches; the wildcard certificate was valid for *.portal.gov.bd
but was used on all *.gov.bd. In a similar case, the Colombian
government used the wildcard certificate for *.micolumbiadigi-
tal.gov.co on *.gov.co. Such instances are found in 111 coun-
tries, with the top five violators being Bangladesh (2 certificates
incorrectly used across 138 hostnames), Colombia (3 certificates
incorrectly used across 125 hostnames), China (8 certificates in-
correctly used across 107 hostnames), Dominica (1 certificate in-
correctly used across 28 hostnames), and Vietnam (3 certificates
incorrectly used across 21 hostnames).
Unlike cases where a single certificate is shared across differ-
ent hostnames in one country, we also see instances of public key
and single-certificate reuse by different governments. We found
58 government hostnames of 24 countries using the same certifi-
cate. 154 certificates were reused across 1,390 hostnames, with 108
certificates reused by 2 countries, 19 by 3 countries, 11 by 4 coun-
tries, and 1 by 24 countries. The most-reused certificates are invalid
self-signed localhost certificates with the same set of public keys.
210 (15.1%) of these hostnames use self-signed certificates with no
chain of trust, while 648 (46.6%) of the incorrectly reused ones are
invalid due to hostname mismatches. This incorrect usage points
to a troubling possibility that all the servers share the same private
key. A malicious user with the key could observe TLS connections
to a target server using the same certificate and decrypt communi-
cations with any clients who have added an exception to the invalid
certificate. Valid reused certificates are wild card certificates being
hosted by the same government. We do not find any instances of
valid public key reuse across country governments.
5.3.4 Configuring CAA Records: DNS Certification Authority Au-
thorization (CAA) is a DNS record type which indicate the CAs
allowed to issue a certificate for the given domain. Enabling CAA
records allows administrators to restrict certificate issuance to
trusted CAs and implements notification procedures to identify
incorrect certificate signing requests which could be initiated by
masquerading adversaries [37]. We performed measurements on
all of the the hostnames for CAA records and identify that only
1851 (1.36%) of all domains had a valid CAA record and 100% of the
CAA records themselves were valid. The use of CAA records also
mitigates the risk of certificate mis-issuance by CAs, which could
have serious consequences, up to and including removal of the CA
from the trust stores.
5.4 Hosting Providers
Cloud hosting providers & Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) can
impact the https ecosystem by automatically enabling https with-
out the need for customer action, sometimes for free, making them
alluring for governments as an alternative to self-hosting. Some
domain registrars (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap) also provide hosting
services and simplify certificate deployment for their customers.
Governments have been increasingly leveraging these platforms to
streamline operations and increase their resistance to DDoS attacks.
We explore the uptake of these hosting platforms and potential
impacts on https adoption for their government clients (Figure 5).
We note that different countries might have different legal re-
quirements for government cloud providers such as being FedRAMP
(equivalent) certified and compliant with accessibility guidelines [36,
77]. Prior work has focused on comparing FedRAMP and the South
Korean cloud certification process, presenting improvement sug-
gestions, and analyzing improvement adoption [41, 53, 71]. These
studies further motivate our case studies in Section 6.
We sort government hostnames by cloud and CDN service using
the periodically updated public IP ranges published by providers
like Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Cloudflare, IBM,
Oracle, Google Cloud and HP-Enterprise. Akamai however does
not publish an official IP range list and hence is not considered
in this study. Using these CIDR prefixes, we perform lookups on
the DNS A records of the domains to resolve the IP address and
identify the host. We use the first IP address returned in the list of A
records, and label all IP addresses not belonging to our list of service
providers as “privately hosted or unknown”. In Figure 5, we find

Those on commercial clouds or CDNs have significantly higher
https adoption, with 60% having valid certificates compared to
30% on private servers.
5.5 Comparison with Non-Govt. Sites
Given the positive effects of public and commercial pressure on
https adoption, we expected website popularity ranking and use of
valid https to be correlated. This complicates an apples-to-apples
comparison between government and non-government sites as
our list includes mostly government sites outside the top millions
(90.9%), for which there are no rankings. Thus, we restrict our
comparison to the subset of our government hostnames present
in the Tranco million dataset (12,293 of our 135,139 hostnames),
comparing https validity while accounting for relative rank.
We compare https in these top government websites (mean
rank: 396,427, 𝜎: 285,611) with [1] 12,000 random, uniformly sam-
pled top million non-government hostnames (mean rank: 499,206,
𝜎: 286,907) and [2] 12,000 sampled top million non-government
hostnames closely matching the rank distribution as the govern-
ment hostnames (mean rank: 402,676, 𝜎: 288,942). For sampling
dataset [2] of non-government hostnames, we first divide the top
million into (N=50) buckets by rank, and count the number of gov-
ernment hostnames in each bucket, ensuring each contains at least
100 government hostnames. We then uniformly sample an equal
number of non-government hostnames in each bucket to match
the number of government hostnames. Figure 7 compares these
three sets with linear regressions on https validity by top million
ranking, with 95% confidence interval bands.
Though ranking does have an effect, overall valid https use
in government websites in the top million is similar to results
in the long tail dataset, at ∼30%. Meanwhile, the top 12,000 non-
government websites have >70% valid https while the two non-
government sets we sampled have ≈55%, indicating that even top

government websites perform worse than most other top million
sites. We expect that these results likely remain consistent in the
long tail of the Internet. Figure 7 shows this disparity and indicates
that the probability of having a valid https certificate reduces as
ranking worsens. However, in this study we do not further compare
reasons for certificate invalidity in top million non-government
and government websites.
In Figure 6, we find that privately hosted government websites
in the top million have 50% of the validity of top non-government
websites. In contrast, non-government websites using public cloud
and CDNs have a validity greater than 70% in our sampled datasets.
6 CASE STUDIES
While the above analyses of the expanded worldwide list of govern-
ment hostnames provides interesting insights, it remains unclear
how representative our data sample is; for example we may have
encountered only a small proportion of government hostnames
from each country. To address this, we include two in-depth case
studies of countries chosen because they provide public, authorita-
tive lists of government hostnames: The United States of America
(USA) and the Republic of Korea (ROK) or South Korea. Both gov-
ernments actively curate their lists, providing a more complete view
of https adoption. As of the publication date, both also have laws
on securing government websites requiring technical measures
against forgery or fraud, though only the USA’s legal requirements
specify https[60, 61, 66]. While the two countries themselves are
not representative of the world, both having high human develop-
ment index scores (USA:15, ROK:22) and Internet adoption rates
(USA:90%, ROK:96%), among other unique factors, their relative
technical sophistication likely biases them towards https adoption
and thus the following analyses could be viewed as a potential
high-water mark for https adoption among governments.

Plotted data are the 12K government hostnames listed (blue), randomly

with rank for all sets, with worse https adoption for government sites.
6.1 Case Study 1: United States of America
The United States General Services Administration (GSA) publishes
an open data set of all hostnames which belong to the government
and archives this information for each presidential term [78, 79]. We
consider this data the ground truth set for the United States and per-
form the same analyses as we do with the worldwide lists. The GSA
categorizes the hostnames into federal, state, local, regional, county,
native sovereign nations and quasi-governmental hostnames. We
additionally merge this with the public list of military hostnames
obtained from the Department of Defense (DoD). While the USA
predominantly uses .gov as the official government extension, it
also uses other domain extensions such as .fed.us and .mil for its
federal and military related websites. As mentioned in section 4.1.1,
we filtered only for hostnames with official government domain
extensions (such as .gov in the case of the US), excluding the others.
From the authoritative GSA list, US government websites demon-
strate overall 81.12% valid https use.
6.1.1 Certificate Analysis. Let’s Encrypt is the most popular CA
used by US government websites and less than 5% of the Let’s
Encrypt certificates used by these websites are invalid as shown
in Figure 8. We identify that 83.11% of the invalid Let’s Encrypt
certificates are invalid due to hostname mismatches, 13.39% due to
expiry of the certificate and the remaining due to the client being
unable to validate the root certificate in the local trust store.
Consistent with the global scan, we find that CAs using elliptic
curves for signatures tend to be valid & used correctly. Figure 9
shows certificate validity by type of signing algorithm used by the
CA authority and public key sizes used by the host. We observe that
100% of certificates are invalid when issued using SHA1 with RSA
encryption, MD5 with RSA encryption or Probabilistic Signature
Scheme (PSS), whereas 100% of certificates are valid using ECDSA

with SHA384. We also find that valid certificates are highly clustered
together in duration of validity, within 3 years of the current date
(see Figure 10), compared to invalid certificates which are issued
for much longer durations than agreed upon by the CAs [13, 14].
6.1.2 Hosting Analysis. Government web hosting both worldwide
and in the US is dominated by private hosting. 13.02% of US govern-
ment sites are on the public cloud and CDNs, close to the 11.46%
for all government sites in the Tranco top million. Government
sites are 3.5x more likely to be hosted on AWS than the second
most popular service Cloudflare, with Azure and Google Cloud
closely following, as shown in Figure 5. The public GSA dataset
contains a large number of unreachable sites in the 2016 presiden-
tial end-of-term snapshot. This is because these websites are either
archived or unavailable. We do not consider unavailable websites
in our analyses. In Appendix A.1, we discuss validity by host for
the individual datasets aggregated here.
6.2 Case Study 2: South Korea
The government of South Korea (ROK) centrally maintains a search
portal under “gov.kr”, also called “Government24,” which contains a
comprehensive organizational map of the Korean government and
serves as an authoritative database of all of their hostnames [3]. All
21,885 hostnames present in the database at the time were scraped
from the search results and de-duplicated. From this authoritative
government website list, we measured a 37.95% rate of https va-
lidity in the Republic of Korea.
6.2.1 Certificate Analysis. The largest issuer of government web
certificates in South Korea was the CA Sectigo RSA DV Secure
Server, closely followed by Alpha SSL (see Figure 11)–also the 4th
and 10th largest CAs used worldwide (Figure 2), and the 5th and
24th largest CAs used by US government websites (Figure 9). 47%
of ROK certificates issued by Sectigo RSA DV were invalid, due
to hostname mismatches, inability to get local issuer certificate,
a self-signed certificate in the chain, or expiry. ROK continues
to use private CAs or CAs which were previously a part of the

6.2.2 Hosting Analysis. As shown in Figure 5, the vast majority of
government websites in the ROK are privately hosted, with only
0.21% of sites being hosted on popular large public clouds or CDNs.
Similar to the USA, as shown in Figure 10, we notice the valid
certificates being clustered together.
6.3 Case Study Discussion
Despite having similar human development index scores and In-
ternet adoption rates, overall https adoption by the US and South
Korean governments are very different (at 81.12% and 37.95%, re-
spectively). https error and misconfiguration profiles also differ
between the countries. Exceptions, such as unsupported SSL proto-
col, timeout, connection refused or reset by peers, and wrong SSL
version number, compose 2.79% of https invalidity in the USA, as
compared to 21.08% in the ROK. In the US, the usage of a self-signed
certificate in the certificate chain causes 0.18% of errors and the
inability to get local issuer certificate composes 2.44%. In the ROK,
the corresponding figures are 5.95% and 15.44%, respectively.
South Korea created and deployed its own CA accredited by the
National Public Key Infrastructure (NPKI), which historically was
only accessible through a plugin installed by the citizens to ensure
secure access to government resources with a user-issued identity
certificate [43]. Over the past decade, there have been massive ef-
forts to improve interoperation between NPKI and web standardiza-
tion efforts by the W3C and EFF for PKI [50, 65]. In 2018, South Ko-
rea prepared a bill to abolish the government-accredited NPKI and
switch to the web standard [43]. Since then, the recent Electronic
Government Act and proceeding Enforcement Decree have required
(without precisely defining) security measures against forgery or
data theft for e-government services [60, 61], underscoring the
importance of scanning government websites for accountability.
Two years later (Figure 11) we continue to see NPKI-attested sub
CAs, such as CA134100031 (3rd most popular) and CA131100001
(9th most popular), being used by government websites in the ROK,
but treated as invalid certificates by popular browsers and tools
like OpenSSL due to their repeated violation of certificate issuance
standards [15].
