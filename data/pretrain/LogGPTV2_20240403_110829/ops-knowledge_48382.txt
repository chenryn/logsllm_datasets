**Issue Description:**

I have installed Python 2.7.3 on a 64-bit Linux machine, along with the 64-bit Oracle 11g client. I have also set the `ORACLE_HOME`, `PATH`, and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variables, and successfully installed `cx_Oracle` version 5.1.2 for Python 2.7 and Oracle 11g. However, when I run the `ldd` command on `cx_Oracle`, it is unable to locate `libclntsh.so.11.1`.

I have attempted various solutions, including creating symbolic links to `libclntsh.so.11.1` under `/usr/lib64` and updating the `oracle.conf` file in `/etc/ld.so.conf.d/`. Despite trying all the suggested solutions from online forums, I have not been able to resolve the issue.

**Resolution:**

The problem was that I had installed Python and `cx_Oracle` as the root user, but the Oracle client was installed by the "oracle" user. After installing my own Oracle client, the issue was resolved.

Additionally, I encountered a `PyUnicodeUCS4_DecodeUTF16` error with Python. To fix this, I reinstalled Python using the `--enable-unicode=ucs4` option.

If you are facing a similar issue, ensure that the Oracle client is installed by the same user who installed Python and `cx_Oracle`. Additionally, consider recompiling Python with the `--enable-unicode=ucs4` option if you encounter Unicode-related errors.
