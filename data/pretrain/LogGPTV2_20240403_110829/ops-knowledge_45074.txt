User: I am using the output streams from the io module and writing to files. I want to be able to detect when I have written 1G of data to a file and then start writing to a second file. I can't seem to figure out how to determine how much data I have written to the file.
Is there something easy built in to io? Or might I have to count the bytes before each write manually?
Assistant: See the tell() method on the stream object.
