Currently `PriorityQueue` defaults to a max-heap and if you want to use it as
a min-heap you need to overload `Ord` and change the comparison.
But you should be able to use the default ordering and simply specify that you
want a min-heap, so we can use it for types like `(uint, &str)` for example.
The simple idea would be to simply make a `new_min_heap` and a
`min_heap_with_capacity` constructors.
Thoughts?
