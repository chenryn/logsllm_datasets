lapping IPs or hostnames). However, the two probes with the highest similarity
(#32 and #60) had fewer than 40 overlapping IP/hostname pairs. Surprisingly,
probes #32 and #30 had the most such IP/hostname pairs. These two Comcast
probes were around 1,500 km apart. There was no overlapping interdomain links
among ISPs, but we observed 16 cross-ISP overlapping video cache IPs between
Italia (#43) and Free (#71). Given these dissimilar patterns with the use of
interdomain links we presented in previous sections, we believe that video cache
selection did incorporate any interdomain link preference.
ISPs can also balance YouTube workload by distributing traﬃc to the same
video cache via diﬀerent interdomain links. In our measurements, around half
of the YouTube video cache IPs were accessed with more than one interdomain
link (Fig. 6). For Kabel, about 90% of the video caches were reached with at
least two diﬀerent links, suggesting that access ISPs are heavily involved in load
balancing traﬃc to/from YouTube.
5 Conclusion
We used topological measurement and inference and YouTube-speciﬁc end-to-
end measurement to explore how Google and ISPs perform load balancing of
YouTube traﬃc. By incorporating interdomain link information, we discovered
that ISPs play an important role in distributing YouTube traﬃc across multiple
interdomain links that connect ISPs to Google infrastructure. Unsurprisingly,
location and time-of-day inﬂuence load balancing behaviors. For the server side,
our analysis of DNS bindings between hostnames and IPs of video caches suggests
that YouTube front-end servers select video caches by controlling hostnames,
rather than DNS-redirection. We further observed that the same video cache
can be accessed with multiple interdomain links, and the varied patterns of
such links across diﬀerent access ISPs suggests that ISPs, rather than Google,
play a primary role in balancing YouTube request load across their interdomain
links toward Google. In the future, we plan to investigate the impact of load
balancing behavior on video streaming performance and its correlation to user-
reported QoE.
