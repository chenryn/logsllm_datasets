### Repro steps
I was using the YouTube website. I have a habit of checking if the website i
have visited was using react or not. As always I checked for YouTube website
too. But the react developer tools extension was showing the youtube website
is using react.
Just to make sure it was right I have installed the firefox browser then
installed the react developer tools extension and opened the youtube website,
But in firefox, the extension was saying the youtube is not using react.
For confirming with other websites, I have visited mdn and GitHub docs in both
chrome and firefox. The chrome react developer tools extension says that the
mdn is using react and the firefox react developer tools extension says that
the mdn is not using react. For the GitHub docs website, the chrome extension
says that the GitHub docs website was using the react whereas the firefox
react developer tools extension shows that the Github docs website doesn't use
the react.
I am attaching the screen recording. To differentiate what websites I have
visited in chrome and firefox I previously opened the websites in chrome and
showed the results, for firefox I have typed the query and showed the results.
Can you tell why it was happening like this?
