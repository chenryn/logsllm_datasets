The `fsutil repair` command is used to administer and monitor NTFS self-healing repair operations. Self-healing NTFS attempts to correct corruptions in the NTFS file system online, without requiring `Chkdsk.exe` to be run. For more information, see [Self-healing NTFS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/file-server/self-healing-ntfs).
