### Video Consumption Trends and Platform Usage

#### Overview
While smart TVs and set-top boxes support web browsers, video consumption on these browsers remains minimal. Almost all publishers today support both web browsers and mobile applications. By examining the percentage of view-hours served by different platforms, we can observe significant shifts in viewer behavior.

#### View-Hour Analysis
**Fig. 6(a)** illustrates that browser viewership has declined from nearly 60% to less than 25%. Despite increased publisher support for smart TVs over the past two years, their share of view-hours remains below 5%. Interestingly, set-top boxes have seen the most growth, now accounting for nearly 40% of view-hours, while mobile app viewership has remained steady at around 20-25%.

These findings are consistent with a recent report [24], which indicates that among Netflix users, set-top boxes and smart TVs accounted for 70% of view-hours, while web browsers and mobiles each accounted for 15% in early 2018.

#### Publisher Influence
To determine if large publishers are skewing these observations, **Fig. 6(b)** shows view-hour trends after removing the top few publishers. While there are some differences, such as mobile app viewing surpassing other platforms over time and set-top viewing growing at a slower rate, the overall trends remain qualitatively similar. This suggests that platform usage trends are not solely driven by the largest publishers, unlike the trend with DASH adoption.

#### Views vs. View-Hours
The increase in view-hours for set-top boxes could be due to either longer view durations or more views. **Fig. 6(c)** depicts the fraction of views across different platforms, including the three largest publishers. Set-top box views have grown to 20% of total views, but this lags behind the set-top view-hour growth (nearly 40% in **Fig. 6(a)**). This suggests that mobile app views tend to be shorter, while set-top views are longer. **Fig. 8** confirms this, showing the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of individual view duration (in hours, with the X-axis truncated at 1 hour) for each platform. Only 24% of mobile and browser views last longer than 0.2 hours, compared to more than 60% of set-top views.

#### Device-Specific Trends
An examination of device usage within the top three platforms reveals additional insights:
- **Browsers:** The share of view-hours for HTML5 increased from about 25% to nearly 60% over two years, primarily at the expense of other browser-based players, especially Flash.
- **Mobile Devices:** View-hours for Android devices have increased significantly, and both Android and iOS now have comparable viewership.
- **Set-Top Boxes:** Roku devices dominate in terms of view-hours, though AppleTV and FireTV also account for a non-negligible percentage.

Overall, these results indicate that publishers must manage multiple platforms and devices within each platform, contributing to significant management complexity.

#### Number of Platforms per Publisher
**Fig. 9(a)** characterizes the number of platforms supported by publishers. Over 85% of publishers support more than one platform, and over 95% of view-hours are attributable to these publishers. About 30% of publishers support all five platforms, accounting for over 60% of view-hours. The number of platforms supported increases with view-hours (**Fig. 9(b)**). For instance, in the bucket corresponding to 10^3X to 10^4X view-hours, most publishers support at least three platforms, and nearly half support all five. **Fig. 9(c)** shows that the average and view-hour weighted average of the number of platforms supported by publishers have increased by 48% and 37%, respectively, over two years. Publishers now support more than three platforms on average, with the weighted average being nearly 4.5.

### Content Distribution

Once content is packaged, it is distributed to end users using content delivery networks (CDNs). CDNs work by placing content closer to the end user, which is crucial for performance. Understanding CDN usage is important because it can have a significant impact on performance and can add complexity to video management.

#### Prevalence by CDN
We observed 36 different CDNs across all publishers, including both regional and international CDNs. Some publishers also use internal CDNs, sometimes in conjunction with external ones. Over 93% of view-hours were served by just five CDNs, indicating that viewership is concentrated among a few major CDNs.

**Fig. 11(a)** shows the percentage of publishers using each of the top five CDNs over time. One CDN, denoted as A, dominates, with nearly 80% of publishers using it, while only 30% use the second most dominant CDN, C. These numbers have remained relatively stable over time.

**Fig. 11(b)** shows the percentage of view-hours served by each CDN. In the current snapshot, three CDNs (A, B, and C) each account for 20-35% of view-hours, while the other two account for about 5% or less. Some CDNs use anycast to direct clients to specific servers, but this method is susceptible to BGP route changes that can sever ongoing TCP connections, raising concerns about its suitability for large transfers. We found that one of the top three CDNs in our dataset uses anycast, suggesting that anycast route instability has not been a significant issue for reliable video delivery.

#### Longitudinal Trends
While longitudinal CDN usage across publishers has largely remained stable, the trend in view-hours shows significant changes. In the latest snapshot, CDN A is no longer dominant, with CDNs B and C serving a greater share of view-hours. These results highlight the importance of considering view-hours in the analysis, an aspect often overlooked in prior work.

#### Number of CDNs per Publisher
**Fig. 12(a)** shows the percentage of publishers using a given number of CDNs and the percentage of view-hours attributable to these publishers. Over 40% of publishers use only a single CDN, but they account for less than 5% of view-hours. In contrast, less than 10% of publishers use five CDNs, but these publishers account for more than 50% of view-hours.

**Fig. 12(b)** classifies the number of CDNs used by publishers based on their view-hours. The results indicate that the percentage of publishers using multiple CDNs increases with the number of view-hours. For example, all publishers with more than 10^5X view-hours use at least four CDNs, while all publishers with less than X daily view-hours use a single CDN. In the 10^3X - 10^4X bucket, the number of CDNs used ranges from 1 to 3, while in the 10^4X - 10^5X bucket, the number of CDNs ranges from 1 to 5.

**Fig. 12(c)** shows the longitudinal trend for the average number of CDNs used by publishers and the weighted average (weighted by the publisherâ€™s view-hours). While there is some growth in the average number of CDNs per publisher (exceeding 2 in the latest snapshot), the weighted average grows much faster and is nearly 4.5 in the latest snapshot.

#### Live vs. VoD Traffic
Live video has different demands than video-on-demand (VoD), particularly in terms of low end-to-end latency. We found that 30% of publishers use at least one CDN exclusively for VoD traffic, and 19% use at least one CDN exclusively for live traffic. In one extreme case, a publisher used one CDN for all its VoD traffic and a different CDN for all its live video. However, most CDNs used exclusively for live content by one publisher were used exclusively for VoD content by another. Thus, no CDN dominated for live video, reflecting the opaque management decisions of publishers.

### Summary

Several common themes emerge from our analysis of the three dimensions of management complexity:
- No single alternative dominates in terms of view-hours. View-hours are roughly equal between HLS and DASH, across browser, mobile, and set-top boxes, and across three major CDNs.
- More than 90% of view-hours can be attributed to publishers who support more than one protocol, use more than one CDN, and support more than one platform.
- Publishers with more view-hours support more choices in each dimension. The average number of choices, weighted by view-hours, is 2.2 for protocols, 4.5 for CDNs, and 4.5 for platforms.
- At least two of our trends (increase in DASH usage and the emergence of three CDNs with comparable view-hours) are driven by large publishers. However, large publishers alone do not drive trends in platform usage.

By assessing the distribution of view-hours, we observe new trends and provide additional insights:
- Set-top box usage is significant, even exceeding browsers and mobile apps. This sharp rise in set-top box usage is not well documented and can drive the adoption of higher resolution video such as 4K.
- Prior work has not quantified the distribution of multi-CDN usage. We find that almost 80% of view-hours are from publishers using four and five CDNs. While two or three CDNs are sufficient for resilience or load balancing, additional CDNs appear necessary for improved coverage.
- Despite industry excitement with DASH, we expected to find significant DASH support among our publishers. While over 40% of our publishers support DASH, a small number of large publishers account for most of the DASH view-hours. Quality issues with DASH implementations may delay its widespread adoption by smaller publishers.
- Our dataset shows negligible use of RTMP, even though several of our publishers serve live content. RTMP provides low-latency live streaming but has scalability issues and lacks widespread device support.
- Other studies report high mobile view shares, and we find that these have indeed risen over time. However, mobile app view-hours have not increased proportionally because view durations on mobile devices tend to be short.
- Prior work has quantified the decline of Flash, reporting a 96% drop in Flash views for one browser. We find a more modest drop, with about 40% of browser view-hours attributable to Flash, down from 60% at the beginning of our study.

### Understanding Management Complexity

Our results show that publishers must deal with significant diversity across all components of the management plane, impacting the complexity of management tasks. We propose measures to capture this complexity and explore how these measures correlate with publisher view-hours, an approximate indication of publisher size. A correlation would suggest that management complexity is higher for large publishers and lower for small publishers. If even small publishers incur high management complexity, this may indicate a high barrier to entry, as a publisher targeting modest viewership must still pay for high management costs.

#### Examples of Video Management Tasks
- **Software Development and Maintenance:** Publishers must build and maintain players for different devices and browsers, often using device-specific SDKs. They may need to support multiple code bases and multiple versions of SDKs to support legacy devices, incurring both one-time development and ongoing maintenance costs.
- **Packaging:** For each video ID, a publisher needs to package the content for different streaming protocols. Packaging may be performed by the CDN or other third parties, though the overheads remain regardless of who does the packaging.
- **Failure Triaging:** Troubleshooting video performance problems is challenging, as poor performance can be due to the CDN, network, user's device, or a combination of these factors. Performance issues may also be associated with specific streaming protocols, such as errors in manifest files.
