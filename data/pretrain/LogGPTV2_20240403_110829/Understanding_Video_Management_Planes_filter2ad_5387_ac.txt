applications, and, as expected, almost all publishers support browsers
and mobile apps today.
By view-hours. Fig. 6(a) shows that, by percentage of view-hours
served by different platforms, browser viewership has declined from
nearly 60% to less than 25% today. Despite publishers aggressively
increasing support for smart TVs during the last two years, their
share of view-hours has stayed at less than 5%. Interestingly, the set-
top category has grown the most, with the largest share of view-hours
(nearly 40%) in the latest snapshot, while mobile app viewership
has stayed steady at about 20-25%. These results are qualitatively
consistent with a recent report [24] that shows that, among Netflix
users, set-top boxes and smart TVs accounted for 70% of view-hours,
while web browsers and mobiles accounted for 15% each in early
2018.
To understand whether large publishers bias our observations,
Fig. 6(b) shows view-hour trends when we remove the top few
publishers. There are some differences in trends, with mobile app
viewing surpassing all other platforms over time, and set-top viewing
growing at a slower rate. However, the results overall are qualitatively
similar, indicating that platform usage trends in our dataset are not
being driven by the largest publishers alone, unlike the trend with
DASH adoption.
By views. The growth in view-hours with set-top boxes could be
caused by longer view durations or by more views. To investigate
this further, Fig. 6(c) depicts the fraction of views served across
different platforms (including the three large publishers). While
views with set-top boxes have grown to 20% of views in the latest
snapshot, they lag behind the set-top view-hour growth (to nearly
40% in Fig. 6(a)). Taken together, Fig. 6(a) and Fig. 6(c) suggest that
mobile app views are of shorter duration, while set-top views are of
longer duration. Fig. 8 confirms this intuition, depicting the CDF of
individual view duration (in hours, with the X-axis truncated at 1
hour) for each platform in our latest snapshot. Only 24% of mobile
and browser views last longer than 0.2 hours, while more than 60%
of set-top views last longer than 0.2 hours.
Trends within platforms. An examination of trends of device us-
age within each of the top 3 platforms also shows interesting trends,
some well-known, others less so. Among browsers, the view-hours
for HTML5 increased from about 25% to nearly 60% within the
two year period (Fig. 10(a)). This increase came at the expense

of a reduction of view-hours in other browser-based players, espe-
cially Flash. Among mobile devices, view-hours for Android devices
have increased significantly (Fig. 10(b)), and both Android and iOS
have comparable viewership in the latest snapshot. Finally, among
set-top boxes (Fig. 10(c)) Roku devices are dominant in terms of
view-hours, but AppleTV and FireTV account for a non-negligible
percentage of view-hours. Overall, the results indicate that a pub-
lisher must not only cope with multiple platforms but also multiple
devices within each platform, which can contribute to significant
management complexity (§5).
Number of platforms per publisher. Fig. 9(a) characterizes the
number of platforms supported by publishers. Over 85% of publish-
ers support more than one platform, and over 95% of view-hours
are attributable to these publishers. 30% of publishers support all 5
platforms and these publishers account for over 60% of the view-
hours. As with other dimensions, the number of platforms supported
increases with view-hours (Fig. 9(b)). For instance in the bucket
corresponding to 103𝑋 to 104𝑋 view-hours, the vast majority of
publishers support at least 3 platforms, and nearly half support all
5 platforms. Finally, Fig. 9(c) shows that the average and the view-
hour weighted average of the number of platforms supported by
publishers have increased by 48% and 37% respectively over the
two year period. Publishers support more than 3 platforms on aver-
age in the latest snapshot, with the weighted average being nearly
4.5.
4.3 Content Distribution
Once the content is packaged, it is distributed to end users using
content distribution networks (CDNs). CDNs work by situating
the content closer to the end user. Understanding this dimension
is important because CDN usage can have significant performance
impact [61, 66, 69, 73]. Further, publishers can employ multiple
CDNs which can lead to complexity in video management (§5).
Prevalence by CDN. Across all publishers we observed 36 different
CDNs in our dataset. This list included both regional and interna-
tional CDNs. Further, some publishers had their own internal CDNs
(sometimes used in conjunction with external CDNs). Of these, over
93% of the view-hours were served by 5 CDNs, indicating that video

viewership is concentrated among a handful of CDNs. We analyze
the opportunities arising from this consolidation in §6.
Across publishers. Fig. 11(a) shows the percentage of publishers
across time that use each of the top 5 CDNs (anonymized). One CDN,
𝐴 dominates, with nearly 80% of the publishers using it, while only
30% use the second most dominant CDN 𝐶. Longitudinally, these
numbers have remained more or less steady.
By view-hours. Fig. 11(b) shows the percentage of the view-hours
served by each of these CDNs. In the current snapshot, 3 CDNs (𝐴,
𝐵 and 𝐶) each account for 20-35% of the view-hours, while the
other 2 account for about 5% or less each. Some CDNs use anycast
to direct a client to a particular server [54], but anycast is susceptible
to BGP route changes that sever ongoing TCP connections, raising
concerns that anycast may not be suitable for large transfers [79].
We discovered that 1 of the top 3 CDNs in our dataset uses anycast,
suggesting that anycast route instability has not been a blocking
factor in the reliable delivery of video chunks.
While longitudinal CDN usage across publishers has largely re-
mained stable, the longitudinal trend of view-hours shows significant
changes. In particular, CDN 𝐴 is no more dominant in our latest
snapshot, where CDN 𝐵 and 𝐶 served a greater share of view-
hours. Again, these results highlight the importance of considering
view-hours in the analysis, an aspect not considered by prior work
(§3).
Number of CDNs per publisher. We next characterize publishers
by the number of CDNs they use.
Fig. 12(a) shows the percentage of publishers that use a given
number of CDNs, and the percentage of view-hours that may be
attributed to these publishers in our latest snapshot. While more
than 40% of publishers use only a single CDN, they account for less
than 5% of the view-hours. In contrast, less than 10% of publishers
use 5 CDNs, but these publishers account for more than 50% of
view-hours.
Fig. 12(b) shows the number of CDNs used by publishers clas-
sified by their view-hours. The results indicate that the percentage
of publishers that use multiple CDNs increases with the number
of view-hours attributable to the publisher. For example, at the ex-
tremes, all publishers with more than 105𝑋 view-hours use at least
4 CDNs, while all publishers with less than 𝑋 daily view-hours use
a single CDN. In the 103𝑋 − 104𝑋 bucket, the number of CDNs
used ranges from 1 to 3, while in the 104𝑋 − 105𝑋 bucket, the
number of CDNs ranges from 1 to 5.
Finally, Fig. 12(c) shows the longitudinal trend for the average
number of CDNs used by publishers, and the weighted average
(weighted by the publisher’s view-hours). While there is some
growth in the average CDNs per publisher (with the average ex-
ceeding 2 in the latest snapshot), the weighted average grows much
faster and is nearly 4.5 in the latest snapshot.
Live video has some different demands than video-on-demand
(VoD), especially low end-to-end latency from video capture to
viewing, and so we were interested in whether publishers favored
particular CDNs for one type of content versus the other, perhaps
due to different CDN features or latency. Of publishers which use
multiple CDNs and serve both live and VoD traffic, 30% use at least
one CDN only for VoD traffic, and 19% use at least one CDN only for
live traffic. In one extreme case, a publisher used one CDN for all its
VoD traffic and a different CDN for all its live video. However, most
CDNs that were used exclusively for live content by one publisher
were used exclusively for VoD content by another publisher. Thus, no
CDN dominated others for live video, and our results seem to reflect
opaque management plane decisions of publishers. We have left it
to future work to explain the rationale for CDN choices amongst
publishers.
4.4 Summary
Several common themes run through our analysis of these three
dimensions of management complexity.
∙ In no dimension does a single alternative dominate in terms of
view-hours. View-hours are roughly equal between HLS and
DASH; across browser, mobile, and set-up; and across three large
CDNs.
∙ More than 90% of view-hours can be attributed to publishers who
support more than 1 protocol. The same is true of publishers who
use more than 1 CDN, and publishers who support more than 1
platform.
∙ Publishers with more view-hours support more choices in each di-
mension. The average number of choices, weighted by view-hours,
is 2.2 for protocols, 4.5 for CDNs and 4.5 for platforms.
∙ At least two of our trends (increase in DASH usage, and the
emergence of 3 CDNs with comparable view-hours) are driven
245

by large publishers. However, large publishers alone do not drive
trends in platform usage.
By assessing the distribution of view-hours, we observe new
trends and provide additional insights on known trends:
∙ By view-hours, set-top box usage is significant, even exceeding
browsers and mobile apps. This sharp rise of set-top box usage
is not well documented and can drive the adoption of higher
resolution video such as 4K video.
∙ Prior work has not quantified the distribution of multi-CDN usage.
We find that almost 80% of view-hours are from publishers using
4 and 5 CDNs. While 2 or 3 CDNs are sufficient for resilience
or load balancing, additional CDNs appear to be necessary for
improved coverage.
∙ Given industry excitement with DASH [41], we expected to find
significant DASH support among our publishers. While over 40%
of our publishers support DASH, a small number of large pub-
lishers account for most of the DASH view-hours. In working
with publishers, we have experienced quality issues with DASH
implementations, so it might take some more time for the DASH
ecosystem to mature to the point where small publishers also use
more DASH.
∙ Our dataset shows negligible use of RTMP even though several of
our publishers serve live content. RTMP provides low latency live
streaming, but it has some scalability issues and lacks widespread
device support.
∙ Other studies report high mobile view shares [22], and we find
that these have indeed risen over time, but mobile app view-hours
have not increased by a corresponding amount, because view
durations on mobile devices tend to be small.
∙ Prior work has quantified the demise of Flash, reporting a 96%
drop in Flash views for one browser [28]. We find a much more
modest drop, with about 40% of browser view-hours attributable
to Flash, down from 60% at the beginning of our study.
5 UNDERSTANDING MANAGEMENT
COMPLEXITY
Our results in §4 have shown that publishers must deal with sig-
nificant diversity across all components of the management plane.
This diversity can impact the complexity of management tasks. In
this section, we propose measures to capture this complexity, and
explore how these measures correlate with publisher view-hours,
an approximate indication of publisher size. A correlation indicates
that management complexity is higher for large publishers and low
for small publishers. If, however, even small publishers incur high
management complexity, this may indicate a high barrier to entry
since a publisher who targets modest viewership early in its business
growth must still pay for high management costs.
Some examples of video management tasks include:
Software development and maintenance. Video publishers must build
and maintain players for different devices and browsers. Typically,
content publishers use device specific SDKs (released by device
vendors, or third parties) [5, 21, 33]. A publisher may not only need
to maintain multiple code bases corresponding to the different sup-
ported devices (§4), but may also need to support multiple versions
of the SDKs to support legacy devices. Besides the one-time devel-
opment cost, there is an ongoing maintenance cost associated with
rolling out new features, and fixing software bugs.
Packaging. For each video ID, a publisher needs to package the con-
tent for different streaming protocols. Packaging may be performed
by the CDN or other third parties [2, 13, 27, 31]. Though packag-
ing performed by CDNs may offer better economies of scale, the
associated overheads remain irrespective of who does the packaging.
Failure Triaging. Troubleshooting video performance problems is
challenging, and poor performance may be due to a CDN, the net-
work or the user’s device [62, 67], or a combination of these fac-
tors [67]. In addition, performance problems may be associated with
a particular streaming protocol (e.g., manifest files may have errors
