trafﬁc consistently, and BitTorrent’s erratic nature correlates with
the total number of /24 blocks observed per day. In aggregate, 360
Safe trafﬁc is diurnal: in UCSD-13, the average number of source
IP addresses sending this trafﬁc per hour varies between 165k at
20:00 UTC to 2.31M at 0:00 UTC. However, we do not observe
clients using the software at predictable intervals. Thus P2P mis-
conﬁgurations and bugs provide excellent coverage, but only when
we do not need many packets per source or high predictability.
Backscatter. Normally, we think of backscatter from spoofed
DoS attacks as coming from a small number of attacked machines
or networks. Both the Spamhaus attack and the increase in DNS
trafﬁc show that the number of sources sending backscatter can
actually be large. The Spamhaus attack [43] targeted Spamhaus’
network, the networks carrying Spamhaus’ trafﬁc and strategically
selected Internet exchange points. The increase in DNS trafﬁc is
caused by responses to spoofed queries — from many open re-
solvers simultaneously.
Backscatter events provide a period of increased visibility of re-
mote networks, and it may be advantageous to infer network prop-
erties during these events. This window of opportunity may vary:
the Spamhaus attack lasted a couple days, while DNS backscatter
is an on-going phenomenon.
7.2 Dependence on position in IPv4 space
Wustrow et al. [48] ﬁnd signiﬁcant non-uniformity in the num-
ber of bytes and packets received by four /8 darknets in March
2010. However, we ﬁnd more uniformity when considering the
number of sources sending non-spoofed trafﬁc to our /8 darknets.
Intuitively, ﬁltering out spoofed trafﬁc removes some irregularities,
and many IBR components target UCSD-NT and MERIT-NT with
equal probability (e.g., scanning, backscatter, P2P misconﬁgura-
tions).
In particular, we observe a similar number of /24 blocks through
partial-UCSD-13 and MERIT-13 (2.65M and 2.76M respec-
tively). Table 2 shows that partial-UCSD-13 and MERIT-13
also have a similar trafﬁc composition. All components, except
Gaming and Other, contribute approximately the same number of
/24 blocks to each dataset. The Gaming difference can be ex-
plained by a misconﬁguration: a single UCSD-NT IP observes
115k /24 blocks sending Steam trafﬁc. In the Other category, 10
times as many /24 networks send TCP trafﬁc destined to IP ad-
dresses matching {A.B.C.D | A=MERIT & C=13} than {A.B.C.D
| A=UCSD & C=13}.
Additionally, many source /24 blocks send trafﬁc to both UCSD-
NT and MERIT-NT. The ∩UCSD-13 column of Table 2 shows the
overlap—the number of /24 blocks observed in both MERIT-13
and UCSD-13 accounts for more than 84% of /24 blocks. We also
observe an overlap of at least 49% in individual IBR components
(Conﬁcker produces the highest overlap, 99%) which implies that
sources sending IBR likely target multiple /8 networks. Thus, it is
likely that other portions of the address space receive packets from
these sources.
However, we cannot examine all /8 darknets to understand the
full effect of position. The non-uniform nature of IBR may cause
variance when examining other darknets. Wustrow et al. ﬁnd that
many misconﬁgurations affect only the 1.0.0.0/8 block (e.g., traf-
ﬁc to 1.2.3.4) [48]; these misconﬁgurations may also inﬂuence the
number of sources sending trafﬁc to 1.0.0.0/8, in addition to bytes
and packets. Additionally, we show in the next section that sources
often do not target all subnets within a /8 darknet.

With smaller darknets, we expect to observe fewer sources and
observe those sources less frequently. To study the effect of us-
ing a smaller darknet, we vary darknet size, from a /16 to a /8, by
considering contiguous subnets of UCSD-NT as their own mini-
darknet. Figure 8a reports for each darknet size, the range of source
/24 blocks captured by these contiguous subnets in UCSD-13. We
ﬁnd, due to the non-uniform nature of IBR, signiﬁcant differences
in the number of sources captured by subnets of the same size.
Figure 8b shows for each /16 within UCSD-NT the number of
/24 blocks captured during 2013 census. In UCSD-NT, most vari-
ations can be attributed to: (1) the bug in Conﬁcker’s PRNG, (2)
BitTorrent’s RPC mechanism, KRPC, and (3) Encapsulated IPv6
trafﬁc. Individual IP hotspots are observed as little spikes in Fig-
ure 8b, but create small discrepancies compared to the differences
caused by the Conﬁcker, BitTorrent and IPv6 components (for /16
or larger darknets).
Despite these discrepancies, based on median observations, the
marginal utility of a single darknet IP address decreases as the size
of the darknet increases (e.g., doubling the size of the darknet re-
sults in fewer than a 2x increase in the number of /24 blocks ob-
served). In the /8 to /16 range, we observe a power-law relation-
ship between the median number of /24 blocks observed and the
number of darknet IP addresses monitored. Speciﬁcally, in the /8
to /16 range of UCSD-NT, reducing darknet size by a factor of two
should yield about 89% of the original /24 blocks. As a result, we
expect small darknets to also observe many /24 blocks. But this
power-law relationship does not hold for all darknet sizes: the me-
dian number of /24 blocks observed by an IP in UCSD-13 is an
order of magnitude less than the number implied by the power law
relationship.
8. CASE STUDIES
The previous sections identify and characterize aspects of IBR
relevant to conducting opportunistic network analysis. In this sec-
tion, we examine how these aspects inﬂuence network inferences
with IBR. Table 4 shows 13 types of IBR-based inferences, which
vary along the dimensions of packet-level information (Section 5)
and number of required observations of the source (Section 6). Not
all sources with the speciﬁed dimensions of (packet-level, number
of observations) will be analyzable. For example, to calculate up-
time with two TCP packets, the source needs to send packets with
TCP timestamps from an operating system where the technique is
valid.
The inferences in Table 4 include previous studies where the au-
thors applied their method Internet-wide, previous studies where a
technique used on a small scale may be usable for Internet-wide
analysis, techniques used with measurement data other than IBR
that may be applicable to IBR, and novel uses of IBR. While not
exhaustive, Table 4 suggests that IBR is versatile in terms of the
number and range of inferences it may be able to support, includ-
ing existence (or active use) of a network resource, host attributes,
and network behavior.
We consider three case studies in detail: locating open resolvers
(Section 8.1), determining uptime (Section 8.2), and identifying
path changes (Section 8.3). The goal of these case studies is to
highlight some strengths and weaknesses of using IBR. The open
resolver case study uses erratic but information-rich trafﬁc; the up-
time case study applies a common technique to a diverse set of
hosts, but we need to take steps to ensure its accuracy; the path
change case study takes advantage of repeated contact at the AS-
level, but is not as accurate as the standard active technique (tracer-

oute). Through these case studies we extend our knowledge of the
state of the Internet and we identify some situations where IBR
can assist in Internet-wide measurement: (1) when the presence of
a source in IBR provides additional context; (2) to obtain a large
sample; (3) for hosts unreachable through active probing; and (4)
to reduce measurement overhead.
8.1 Locating open DNS resolvers
In a reﬂective ampliﬁcation attack, the attacker sends a small,
spoofed packet to a node that responds with a much larger packet
to the spoofed source IP address. These attacks often use DNS re-
cursive queries. As a security mechanism, many DNS servers only
answer recursive queries within their administrative domain. DNS
servers not implementing this security mechanism are known as
“open resolvers.” Locating open resolvers is a ﬁrst step in improv-
ing DNS security.
Our objectives with this case study are: (1) to show that the
changing composition of IBR can provide an opportunity to learn
about the Internet; (2) to show that IBR can supplement active prob-
ing techniques by providing additional information; (3) to expose
limitations in IBR’s ability to determine the existence of network
components.
Method.
If a darknet receives a DNS response, the most likely
scenario is that a DNS server is responding to a spoofed query. In
this section, we consider all UDP source port 53 trafﬁc. We label
an IP address as an open resolver if the Recursion-Available ﬂag
is set, as it indicates the willingness to resolve recursive queries.
This way, we actually locate either a machine that accepts recursive
queries from any IP address or that recursively resolves domains on
behalf of a forwarding open DNS server [45]. We do not check the
correctness or consistency of responses reaching the darknet, but
we include response codes in our analysis.
Results. Table 5 shows that we observe few open resolvers in
UCSD-12,13 and MERIT-13. However, starting around Febru-
ary 2014, we observe a sustained increase in DNS responses (also
visible as an increase in backscatter in Figure 7b). Van Nice reports
that this type of attack is responsible for 3% of global ISP DNS
trafﬁc, which may result in DoS to (a) the resolvers, (b) authori-
tative name servers, and (c) web sites hosted by the authoritative
servers [47]. To show the magnitude of open resolvers during this
time period, we create a dataset, UCSD-14-DNS, between January
20, 2014 and March 1, 2014.

entire IPv4 address space over a period of 6.5 hours, once per

observed and size of the darknet (Figure 8a), but signiﬁcant variance based on position in the darknet (Figure 8b).
