ABSTRACT 
The  objective  of  the  5th  ACM  Workshop  on  Moving  Target 
Defense (MTD 2018) – held in Toronto, Canada on October  15, 
2018,  in  conjunction  with  the  24th  ACM  Conference  on 
Computer and Communications Security (ACM CCS 2018) – is to 
bring  together  researchers  from  academia,  government,  and 
industry  to  discuss  novel  randomization,  diversification,  and 
dynamism  techniques  for  improving  the  security  of  computer 
systems and network, and new metric and analytical frameworks 
to assess and quantify the effectiveness of MTD techniques.  As 
in previous editions, the 2018 workshop offers a forum to discuss 
the challenges and opportunities that such defenses provide.  We 
have assembled an exciting and diverse program including nine 
refereed  papers  and  one  invited  keynote  talk  that  will  provide 
participants  with  a  vibrant  and  thought-provoking  set  of  ideas 
and insights.

1  INTRODUCTION 
The static nature of current computing systems has made them 
easy  to  attack  and  hard  to  defend.    Adversaries  have  an 
asymmetric advantage as they have the time to study a system, 
identify  its  vulnerabilities,  and  choose  the  time  and  place  of 
attack to gain the maximum benefit.  The idea of moving-target 
defense  (MTD) is  to impose the  same  asymmetric  disadvantage 
on attackers by making systems dynamic and therefore harder to 
explore and predict [1, 2, 3].  With a constantly changing system 
and its ever adapting attack surface, attackers will have to deal 
with a great amount of uncertainty just like defenders do today.  
The  ultimate  goal  of  MTD  is  to  measurably  increase  the

attackers’  workload  [4]  so  as  to  level the  cybersecurity  playing 
field  for  both  defenders  and  attackers  –  ultimately  tilting  it  in 
favor of the defender. 
The  MTD  2018  workshop  aims  to  provide  a  forum  for 
researchers and practitioners in this area to exchange their novel 
ideas, findings, experiences, and lessons learned. 
2  SCOPE 
Randomization, diversification, and dynamism can be applied to 
many  different  components  of  a  computer  system  or  network 
[3], and at different layers of its software stack [5].  As a result, 
MTD  encompasses  a  broad  spectrum  of  techniques  and  their 
associated metrics and analytical frameworks. 
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: 
  System randomization 
  Artificial diversity 
  Cyber maneuver and agility 
  Software diversity 
  Dynamic network configuration 
  Moving target in the cloud 
  System diversification techniques 
  Dynamic compilation techniques 
  Adaptive defenses 
  MTD strategies and planning 
  Deep learning for MTD 
  MTD quantification methods and models 
  MTD evaluation and assessment frameworks 
  Large-scale MTD (using multiple techniques) 
  Moving target in software coding, and API virtualization 
  Autonomous technologies for MTD 
  Human, social, and usability aspects of MTD 
Intelligent countermeasure selection 
3  WORKSHOP OBJECTIVES 
The  MTD  workshop  aims  to  bring  together  researchers  from 
academia,  government,  and  industry  to  report  on  the  latest 
research  efforts  on  moving  target  defense,  generate  productive 
discussions  and  constructive  debates  on  this topic,  and identify 
new  and  promising  research  directions.   In  particular,  the 
5th MTD  workshop  has  a  special  focus  on  lessons  learned  from 
past  research  in  the  area  of  moving  target  defense,  and 
challenges  and  opportunities  faced  by  the  community  moving 
forward.

security landscape, advancing the state of the art in this field will 
be critical to securing the nation’s cyber infrastructure against a 
vast array of known and unknown threats.   
4  MTD PROGRAM 
The  5th  MTD  workshop  is  a  one-day  pre-conference  workshop, 
scheduled  on  October  15,  2018.    The  program  includes  one 
invited keynote speaker.  Prof. Radha Poovendran (University of 
Washington)  will  give  a  keynote  talk  titled  “Dynamic  Defense 
against Adaptive and Persistent Adversaries,” which will address 
the design of Moving Target Defense (MTD) and DIFT games for 
modeling  Advanced  Persistent  Threats  (APTs).    The  program 
also  includes  an  exciting  set  of  nine  refereed  full  papers, 
covering  a  broad  range  of  topics  from  methods  for  evaluating 
MTD  techniques  to  novel  MTD  frameworks  and  techniques, 
including  techniques  specifically  designed  to  protect  critical 
systems  against  advanced  threats.    The  nine  presentations  are 
grouped in three sessions based on topics, namely: (1) Evaluation 
of  MTD  Techniques; 
(2)  Novel  MTD  Frameworks  and 
Techniques;  and  (3)  Protection  of  Critical  Services  against 
Advanced Threats.
