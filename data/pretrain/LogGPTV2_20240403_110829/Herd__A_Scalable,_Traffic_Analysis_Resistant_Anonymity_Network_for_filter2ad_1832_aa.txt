## Abstract
Effective anonymization of Voice-over-IP (VoIP) calls requires a scalable anonymity network that is resilient to traffic analysis and has sufficiently low latency to support high-quality voice calls. The popular Tor anonymity network, for instance, is not designed for the former and typically cannot achieve the latter. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and experimental evaluation of Herd, an anonymity network where a set of dedicated, fully interconnected cloud-based proxies yield suitably low-latency circuits, while untrusted superpeers add scalability. Herd provides caller/callee anonymity among clients within a trust zone (e.g., jurisdiction) and under a strong adversarial model. Simulations based on a trace of 370 million mobile phone calls among 10.8 million users indicate that Herd achieves anonymity among millions of clients with low bandwidth requirements, and that superpeers decrease the bandwidth and CPU requirements of the trusted infrastructure by an order of magnitude. Finally, experiments using a prototype deployment on Amazon EC2 show that Herd has a delay low enough for high-quality calls in most cases.

## 1. Introduction

Voice-over-IP (VoIP) systems are popular due to their support for pseudonymous identities and strong encryption, making them appealing to users concerned about communication privacy. However, many nation-states use Internet surveillance to monitor and repress critics [18, 14], and even Western democracies conduct mass surveillance [9, 10, 8, 4]. In this environment, VoIP systems are insufficient to ensure the anonymity of Internet users, nor the safety of political activists and whistleblowers, as illustrated by the NSA's ability to intercept Skype conversations [13].

Existing anonymity networks are not designed for the low latency required to support VoIP, nor do they scale to millions of users under a strong adversarial model. For example, Tor [28] scales to large numbers of users but is vulnerable to an adversary who can eavesdrop on the ingress and egress paths of Tor circuits. Recent revelations indicate that the UK's GCHQ is pursuing this to deanonymize Tor users [1]. We demonstrate in Section 4 that a simple attack using only the start and end times would trace 98.3% of the calls of a large, real voice workload if they had been made over Tor. (A more sophisticated attack that also considers the time series of encrypted packets would likely trace even more calls.)

In addition, Tor typically incurs round-trip delays between 2–4 seconds on established, sender-anonymous circuits due to random proxy selection and high-latency connections [43, 15], which is prohibitive for VoIP. Other anonymity systems resist traffic analysis at the cost of performance or scalability [37, 47, 26, 30, 45]. For example, Dissent, the state-of-the-art Dining Cryptographers network (DC-Net), is resilient under a strong threat model but requires one broadcast channel per anonymity set, impacting anonymity and scalability, as well as several round-trip times, yielding delays significantly higher than Tor [47].

In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of Herd, a scalable anonymity network that combines suitable delays for VoIP with anonymity under a strong adversarial model. Herd achieves these properties using a novel design tailored to the specific requirements and traffic characteristics of VoIP. Specifically, (1) Herd leverages the multitude of jurisdictions in the Internet with a design that ensures a user's anonymity depends only on mixes located in jurisdictions that (s)he trusts, independent of her communication partners' choices; (2) it exploits the constant-rate, low-bandwidth nature of VoIP traffic to resist traffic analysis while achieving low delay; (3) it employs a novel design based on network coding to hide clients' activity patterns, enabling Herd to offload its trusted infrastructure with the help of untrusted peers.

At its core, Herd relies on a set of dedicated mixes (proxies that relay VoIP data packets) operated by independent organizations in different jurisdictions around the world. The underlying insight is that no adversary has access to mix locations everywhere in the world. Herd exploits this by allowing clients to choose a mix within a trust zone, i.e., a jurisdiction/provider that is friendly to their cause, and by guaranteeing that client anonymity depends only on this choice.

Because the set of mixes is fully connected, a Herd circuit involves at most three intercontinental links (usually one), which keeps delays low enough for acceptable VoIP quality. To increase scalability, Herd can optionally use untrusted superpeers that forward traffic between clients and a mix. Superpeers reduce the CPU and bandwidth demands on trusted infrastructure without sacrificing anonymity. Bitwise unlinkability (i.e., decorrelating the content of packets arriving and departing a mix) and traffic-analysis resistance are achieved via encrypted connections padded using artificial traffic (chaff), where rate adjustments are correlated within large anonymity sets.

This paper makes the following contributions:
- We present the design of Herd, a scalable anonymity network with latency sufficiently low to carry VoIP calls and anonymity under a strong adversarial model.
- A trace-based evaluation of Herd's overheads and performance using a trace of 370 million mobile phone calls among 10.8 million users, and a comparison with Drac [26], an existing low-delay anonymity network.
- An open-source implementation of Herd.
- An experimental evaluation of Herd’s perceived call quality based on VoIP calls made by volunteers using a Herd deployment on Amazon EC2.

Our key results are as follows. First, using trace-based simulations, we show that Herd achieves anonymity with low bandwidth requirements for millions of clients. Second, we find that superpeers decrease the bandwidth and CPU demands on trusted infrastructure by an order of magnitude because they allow Herd to take advantage of resource contributions by untrusted parties without affecting anonymity. We estimate that untrusted superpeers that contribute resources for free or in exchange for free calls would reduce Herd’s operational costs from $10-100 to $0.10-1.14 per user/month for this workload. Third, experiments with an implementation and a prototype deployment on 4 Amazon EC2 data centers show that Herd incurs modest additional latency compared to direct communication. The Herd source code is available under a BSD license [19].

We discuss background and related work on private voice communication in Section 2. We then present the design and implementation of Herd in Section 3 and compare its performance with alternative low-latency anonymity networks in Section 4. We conclude in Section 5.

## 2. Background & Related Work

### 2.1 Context

Providing anonymous communication is challenging from a technical, legal, and political standpoint. Recent revelations about state-sponsored mass surveillance suggest that government agencies analyze large-scale data collected at Internet exchange points [1, 4] and request customer data from service providers [10, 9]. In this environment, achieving effective and practical anonymity is difficult.

Even in the presence of such powerful attackers, however, we posit that there exist free havens supporting private communication, even if those free havens differ depending on the communication partners and their topic. We believe this is the case for two reasons. First, no single adversary has access to all parts of the Internet and jurisdiction over all service providers. This is true despite the fact that countries like the US and the UK have access to a disproportionate amount of Internet traffic today. Moreover, in the wake of recent revelations, there is some indication that more countries may seek to establish national Cloud and Web service providers and independent Internet routes that do not needlessly cross other countries or continents [17].

Second, for any worthy cause that a group of users pursue under the cloak of anonymity, there is likely a country that is friendly or at least indifferent to that cause. Combined with the first point, we believe that users can find a jurisdiction that avoids legal and political challenges to anonymous communication, leaving only technical challenges.

The design of Herd seeks to exploit these circumstances by allowing callers and callees to independently choose a provider within a jurisdiction they deem friendly to their cause and through a trust model where a user's anonymity depends only on their own choice of provider. Before we describe the design of Herd in the next section, we review existing work in anonymous voice services.

### 2.2 Existing Techniques

#### Burner Phones
A simple method for anonymous voice calling is to use pre-paid SIM cards and cheap cellular phones purchased with cash and discarded after a period of use. To receive calls, a user must disseminate her current phone number to callers using an out-of-band mechanism. Using burner phones may not be appropriate in all cases due to its monetary cost, relative inconvenience, and the unavailability of unregistered, pre-paid SIM cards in some countries. Further, using a burner phone does not guarantee that calls made using the phone will not be tapped or otherwise logged.

#### VoIP Services
In principle, VoIP services are an alternative for anonymous voice calling. While VoIP signaling protocols such as SIP and P2PSIP were not designed for anonymous call setup, it is possible, for instance, to create a Skype or Google Voice account under a pseudonym and contact the service through a VPN, which obscures the user’s IP address. However, VPNs can be compelled by authorities to release the IP addresses of their customers. For instance, a UK-based VPN recently complied with a US subpoena to trace one of its users [3]. Also, it is widely assumed that Skype complies with requests for call metadata by government authorities [7], and that the NSA has the ability to intercept the contents of Skype calls [13].

Private VoIP services like RedPhone [16] and Silent Circle [12] offer end-to-end encrypted voice calls (strong encryption and at least partially open source) and advertise that no call metadata is stored. However, the services rely on rendezvous and relaying services that can be compelled by local authorities to capture and release call metadata. A subpoena against the operator of a server involved in a call may reveal the IP addresses of the caller and callee.

None of the existing VoIP services are designed to resist traffic analysis, where a passive network observer can determine the caller and callee by matching the time series of encrypted traffic at different points in the network.

#### Anonymity Networks
Users can improve protection against de-anonymization by accessing a VoIP service via an anonymity network like Tor [15]. Unfortunately, the typical delays incurred by Tor circuits are too high for adequate VoIP call quality. More generally, a measurement study indicates that achieving acceptable VoIP call quality using an Tor-like (onion routing) anonymity network based on volunteered resources (PlanetLab) is challenging [39].

LAP [33] is a lightweight anonymity network with near-optimal delay and low routing overhead. However, it assumes a weaker threat model than Tor and requires network support that is not deployed today.

#### Traffic Analysis Resistant Anonymity
Traffic analysis consists of statistical attacks that reveal communication partners by considering the time series of packets and user activity. Tor, like most other medium-delay anonymity networks [33, 21, 20], is not designed to withstand traffic analysis, and we empirically show the effectiveness of such attacks against Tor in Section 4.1.4.

Anonymity networks can batch messages to hide the correlation between input and output messages, as originally done in Chaumian mix-nets [24]. Batching prevents an attacker from tracing messages based on their arrival and departure times, but without chaff, it requires delaying messages for substantial periods. As a result, mix-nets are suitable only for delay-tolerant communications such as emails [32, 40, 27].

ISDN-MIXes [44, 35] combine mixing of time-sliced channels with chaff traffic and broadcast of incoming calls on subscriber links to achieve anonymous telephony on an ISDN network. Herd instead provides anonymous VoIP calls over the Internet, under a threat model that considers today’s powerful adversaries.

Finding the right tradeoff between delaying messages and adding chaff traffic is an open research challenge. For example, both the Java Anonymous Proxy (JAP) [21] and the Freedom Network [46] abandoned chaffing due to its high bandwidth overhead. Below, we discuss designs that combine batching with chaffing to reduce mix-net delays, as well as Dissent, a system based on DC-nets.

Aqua [37] provides k-anonymity for BitTorrent-like traffic in the presence of traffic analysis. While the designs of Herd and Aqua share several ideas, they support different applications and traffic types and differ in other ways: First, Herd uses a hybrid architecture with trusted mixes and untrusted superpeers (SPs), where SPs improve scalability using a novel design based on network coding. Second, Herd leverages (a) the constant-rate nature of VoIP traffic and (b) the jurisdictional diversity of the Internet to achieve paths that require less than half the number of hops as Aqua (at most 3 versus 7 intercontinental hops) without loss of resistance against traffic analysis. Whereas Aqua requires multipath between two pairs of mixes to disperse hotspots in file-sharing traffic, constant-rate traffic does not have this constraint, enabling Herd to achieve latencies appropriate for VoIP calls. By organizing its infrastructure into disjoint trust zones and coupling rate adjustments both within and across them, Herd decouples the anonymity of users of different zones, while Aqua does not consider mixes’ jurisdiction.

P5 [45] and Tarzan [30] are P2P anonymity networks that use broadcast channels and chaffing, respectively, to defend against traffic analysis. Because they use a P2P model, their security depends on forwarding traffic via a series of proxies hosted on endpoints, affecting their latency and reliability.

Dissent [47] is an infrastructure-based anonymity service with a very strong adversarial model, where a single honest proxy is sufficient to ensure anonymity, even in the face of traffic analysis attacks. The system relies on DC-nets and verifiable shuffles, and its infrastructure-based architecture scales to hundreds of clients with modest delay and bandwidth sufficient for web browsing. However, the system’s capacity, scalability, and latency are subject to DC-net scaling limits with respect to the number of proxies, overhead per payload bit for cryptographic processing, and delay.

Drac [26] is a traffic-analysis resistant anonymity network for VoIP and IM that relies on a social network to provide anonymous communication among strangers and unobservable communication among friends. An important difference with Herd is that Drac exposes users’ social network to an adversary. Drac also routes calls in a peer-to-peer fashion over the social network, which can cause impractically long latency for calls between users who are several hops apart in the social graph. Whereas Herd clients maintain a handful of chaffing links (e.g., 2 or 3), Drac may require substantially more (e.g., Twitter and Facebook users have on average 45 and 190 contacts, respectively [31, 29]). We provide a quantitative comparison of Drac and Herd, in terms of anonymity, scalability, and perceived call quality in Section 4.

### 2.3 Our System: Herd

Herd is designed specifically for VoIP traffic and the anonymity needs of voice callers. Herd takes advantage of VoIP calling patterns and traffic characteristics to provide anonymity under a strong adversarial model with reasonable overhead and delay low enough for high-quality voice calls.
