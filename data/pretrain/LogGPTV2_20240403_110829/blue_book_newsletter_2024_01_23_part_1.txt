## [Habit management](habit_management.md)
* New: Introduce habit management.
    A [habit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit) is a routine of behavior that is repeated regularly and tends to occur subconsciously.
    A [2002 daily experience study](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.83.6.1281) found that approximately 43% of daily behaviors are performed out of habit. New behaviours can become automatic through the process of habit formation. Old habits are hard to break and new habits are hard to form because the behavioural patterns that humans repeat become imprinted in neural pathways, but it is possible to form new habits through repetition.
    When behaviors are repeated in a consistent context, there is an incremental increase in the link between the context and the action. This increases the automaticity of the behavior in that context. Features of an automatic behavior are all or some of: efficiency, lack of awareness, unintentionality, and uncontrollability.
    Mastering habit formation can be a powerful tool to change yourself. Usually with small changes you get massive outcomes in the long run. The downside is that it's not for the impatient people as it often appears to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold that unlocks a new level of performance.
* New: [Why are habits interesting.](habit_management.md#why-are-habits-interesting)
    Whenever you face a problem repeatedly, your brain begins to automate the process of solving it. Habits are a series of automatic resolutions that solve the problems and stresses you face regularly.
    As habits are created, the level of activity in the brain decreases. You learn to lock in on the cues that predict success and tune out everything else. When a similar situation arises in the future, you know exactly what you look for. There is no longer a need to analyze every angle of a situation. Your brain skips the process of trial and error and creates a mental rule: if this, then that.
    Habit formation is incredibly useful because the conscious mind is the bottleneck of the brain. It can only pay attention to one problem at a time. Habits reduce the cognitive load and free up mental capacity, so they can be carried on with your nonconscious mind and you can allocate your attention to other tasks.
* New: [Identity focused changes.](habit_management.md#identity-focused-changes)
    Changing our habits is challenging because we try to change the wrong thing in the wrong way.
    There are three levels at which change can occur:
    - Outcomes: Changing your results. Goals fall under this category: publishing a book, run daily
    - Process: Changing your habits and systems: decluttering your desk for a better workflow, developing a meditation practice.
    - Identity: Changing your beliefs, assumptions and biases: your world view, your self-image, your judgments.
    Many people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on what they want to achieve. This leads to outcome-based habits. The alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this approach, we start by focusing on who we wish to become.
    The first path of change is doomed because maintaining behaviours that are incongruent with the self is expensive and will not last. Even if they make rational sense. Thus it's hard to change your habits if you never change the underlying beliefs that led to your past behaviour. On the other hand it's easy to find motivation once a habit has changed your identity as you may be proud of it and will be willing to maintain all the habits and systems associated with it. For example: The goal is not to read a book, but to become a reader.
    Focusing on outcomes may also bring the next problems:
    - Focusing on the results may lead you to temporal solutions. If you focus on the source of the issue at hand you may solve it with less effort and get you to a more stable one.
    - Goals create an "either-or" conflict: either you achieve your goal and are successful or you fail and you are disappointed. Thus you only get a positive reward if you fulfill a goal. If you instead focus on the process rather than the result, you will be satisfied anytime your system is running.
    - When your hard work is focused on a goal you may feel depleted once you meet it and that could make you loose the condition that made you meet the goal in the first place.
    Research has shown that once a person believes in a particular aspect of their identity, they are more likely to act in alignment with that belief. This of course is a double-edged sword. Identity change can be a powerful force for self-improvement. When working against you, identity change can be a curse.
* New: [Changing your identity.](habit_management.md#changing-your-identity)
    Whatever your identity is right now, you only believe it because you have proof of it. The more evidence you have for a belief, the more strongly you will believe it.
    Your habits and systems are how you embody your identity. When you make your bed each day, you embody the identity of an organized person. The more you repeat a behaviour, the more you reinforce the identity associated with that behaviour. To the point that your self-image begins to change. The effect of one-off experiences tends to fade away while the effect of habits gets reinforced with time, which means your habits contribute most of the evidence that shapes your identity.
    Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. This is one reason why meaningful change does not require radical change. Small habits can make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new identity.
    Once you start the ball rolling things become easier as building habits is a feedback loop. Your habits shape your identity, and your identity shapes your habits.
    The most practical way to change the identity is to:
    - [Decide the type of person you want to be](habit_management.md#decide-the-type-of-person-you-want-to-be)
    - Prove it to yourself with small wins
    Another advantage of focusing in what type of person you want to be is that maybe the outcome you wanted to focus on is not the wisest smallest step to achieve your identity change. Thinking on the identity you want to embrace can make you think outside the box.
* New: [Decide the type of person you want to be.](habit_management.md#decide-the-type-of-person-you-want-to-be)
    One way to decide the person you want to be is to answer big questions like: what do you want to stand for? What are your principles and values? Who do you wish to become?
    As we're more result oriented, another way is to work backwards from them to the person you want to be. Ask yourself: Who is the type of person that could get the outcome I want?
* New: [How to change a habit.](habit_management.md#how-to-change-a-habit)
    The process of building a habit from a behaviour can be divided into four stages:
    - **Reward** is the end goal.
    - **Cue** is the trigger in your brain that initiate a behaviour. It's contains the information that predicts a reward.
    - **Cravings** are the motivational force fueled by the desire of the reward. Without motivation we have no reason to act.
    - **Response** is the thought or action you perform to obtain the reward. The response depends on the amount of motivation you have, how much friction is associated with the behaviour and your ability to actually do it.
    If a behaviour is insufficient in any of the four stages, it will not become a habit. Eliminate the cue and your habit will never start. Reduce the craving and you won't have enough motivation to act. Make the behaviour difficult and you won't be able to do it. And if the reward fails to satisfy your desire, then you'll have no reason to do it again in the future.
    We chase rewards because they:
    - Deliver contentment.
    - Satisfy your craving.
    - Teach us which actions are worth remembering in the future.
    If a reward is met then it becomes associated with the cue, thus closing the habit feedback loop.
    If we keep these stages in mind then:
    - To build good habits we need to:
        - Cue: Make it obvious
        - Craving: Make it attractive
        - Response: Make it easy
        - Reward: Make it satisfying
    - To break bad habits we need to:
        - Cue: Make it invisible
        - Craving: Make it unattractive
        - Response: Make it difficult
        - Reward: Make it unsatisfying

### [Configure Docker to host the application](docker.md)
* New: [Send logs to journald.](docker.md#send-logs-to-journald)
    The `journald` logging driver sends container logs to the systemd journal. Log entries can be retrieved using the `journalctl` command, through use of the journal API, or using the docker logs command.
    In addition to the text of the log message itself, the `journald` log driver stores the following metadata in the journal with each message:
    | Field |	Description |
    | ---   |  ----  |
    | CONTAINER_ID |	The container ID truncated to 12 characters. |
    | CONTAINER_ID_FULL |	The full 64-character container ID. |
    | CONTAINER_NAME |	The container name at the time it was started. If you use docker rename to rename a container, the new name isn't reflected in the journal entries. |
    | CONTAINER_TAG, | SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER	The container tag ( log tag option documentation). |
    | CONTAINER_PARTIAL_MESSAGE |	A field that flags log integrity. Improve logging of long log lines. |
    To use the journald driver as the default logging driver, set the log-driver and log-opts keys to appropriate values in the `daemon.json` file, which is located in `/etc/docker/`.
    ```json
    {
      "log-driver": "journald"
    }
    ```
    Restart Docker for the changes to take effect.
* New: [Send the logs to loki.](docker.md#send-the-logs-to-loki)
    There are many ways to send logs to loki
    - Using the json driver and sending them to loki with promtail with the docker driver
    - Using the docker plugin: Grafana Loki officially supports a Docker plugin that will read logs from Docker containers and ship them to Loki.
      I would not recommend to use this path because there is a known issue that deadlocks the docker daemon :S. The driver keeps all logs in memory and will drop log entries if Loki is not reachable and if the quantity of `max_retries` has been exceeded. To avoid the dropping of log entries, setting `max_retries` to zero allows unlimited retries; the driver will continue trying forever until Loki is again reachable. Trying forever may have undesired consequences, because the Docker daemon will wait for the Loki driver to process all logs of a container, until the container is removed. Thus, the Docker daemon might wait forever if the container is stuck.
      The wait time can be lowered by setting `loki-retries=2`, `loki-max-backoff_800ms`, `loki-timeout=1s` and `keep-file=true`. This way the daemon will be locked only for a short time and the logs will be persisted locally when the Loki client is unable to re-connect.
      To avoid this issue, use the Promtail Docker service discovery.
    - Using the journald driver and sending them to loki with promtail with the journald driver. This has worked for me but the labels extracted are not that great.
* New: [Solve syslog getting filled up with docker network recreation.](docker.md#syslog-getting-filled-up-with-docker-network-recreation)
    If you find yourself with your syslog getting filled up by lines similar to:
    ```
     Jan 15 13:19:19 home kernel: [174716.097109] eth2: renamed from veth0adb07e
     Jan 15 13:19:20 home kernel: [174716.145281] IPv6: ADDRCONF(NETDEV_CHANGE): vethcd477bc: link becomes ready

     Jan 15 13:19:21 home kernel: [174717.215917] device veth31cdd6f left promiscuous mode
     Jan 15 13:19:21 home kernel: [174717.215919] br-fbe765bc7d0a: port 2(veth31cdd6f) entered disabled state
    ```
    It probably means that some docker is getting recreated continuously. Those traces are normal logs of docker creating the networks, but as they do each time the docker starts, if it's restarting continuously then you have a problem.
### [Python Snippets](python_snippets.md)
* New: [Parse a datetime from an epoch.](python_snippets.md#parse-a-datetime-from-an-epoch)
    ```python
    >>> import datetime
    >>> datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(1347517370).strftime('%c')
      '2012-09-13 02:22:50'
    ```
### [Inotify](python_inotify.md)
* New: Introduce python_inotify.
    [inotify](https://pypi.org/project/inotify/) is a python library that acts as a bridge to the `inotify` linux kernel which allows you to register one or more directories for watching, and to simply block and wait for notification events. This is obviously far more efficient than polling one or more directories to determine if anything has changed.
    Installation:
    ```bash
    pip install inotify
    ```
    Basic example using a loop:
    ```python
    import inotify.adapters
    def _main():
        i = inotify.adapters.Inotify()
        i.add_watch('/tmp')
        with open('/tmp/test_file', 'w'):
            pass
        for event in i.event_gen(yield_nones=False):
            (_, type_names, path, filename) = event
            print("PATH=[{}] FILENAME=[{}] EVENT_TYPES={}".format(
                  path, filename, type_names))
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        _main()
    ```
    Output:
    ```
    PATH=[/tmp] FILENAME=[test_file] EVENT_TYPES=['IN_MODIFY']
    PATH=[/tmp] FILENAME=[test_file] EVENT_TYPES=['IN_OPEN']
    PATH=[/tmp] FILENAME=[test_file] EVENT_TYPES=['IN_CLOSE_WRITE']
    ```
    Basic example without a loop:
    ```python
    import inotify.adapters
    def _main():
        i = inotify.adapters.Inotify()
        i.add_watch('/tmp')
        with open('/tmp/test_file', 'w'):
            pass
        events = i.event_gen(yield_nones=False, timeout_s=1)
        events = list(events)
        print(events)
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        _main()
    ```
    The wait will be done in the `list(events)` line
### [Pydantic](pydantic.md)
* New: Create part of the attributes in the initialization stage.
    ```python
    class Sqlite(BaseModel):
        model_config = ConfigDict(arbitrary_types_allowed=True)
        path: Path
        db: sqlite3.Cursor
        def __init__(self, **kwargs):
            conn = sqlite3.connect(kwargs['path'])
            kwargs['db'] = conn.cursor()
            super().__init__(**kwargs)

### [Ansible Snippets](ansible_snippets.md)
* New: [Fix the `ERROR! 'become' is not a valid attribute for a IncludeRole` error.](ansible_snippets.md#fix-the-error-become-is-not-a-valid-attribute-for-a-includerole-error)
    If you're trying to do something like:

      - name: "Install nfs"
        become: true
        ansible.builtin.include_role:
          name: nfs
    ```
    You need to use this other syntax:
    ```yaml
    tasks:
      - name: "Install nfs"
        ansible.builtin.include_role:
          name: nfs
          apply:
            become: true
    ```
