User: I needed to have a directly executable python script, so i started the file with #!/usr/bin/env python. However, I also need unbuffered output, so i tried #!/usr/bin/env python -u, but that fails with python -u: no such file or directory.
I found out that #/usr/bin/python -u works, but I need it to get the python in PATH to support virtual env environments.
What are my options?
Assistant: When you use shebang on Linux, the entire rest of the line after the interpreter name is interpreted as a single argument. The python -u gets passed to env as if you'd typed: /usr/bin/env 'python -u'. The /usr/bin/env searches for a binary called python -u, which there isn't one.
