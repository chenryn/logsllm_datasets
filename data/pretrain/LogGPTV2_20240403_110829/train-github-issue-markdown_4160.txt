Using `@cfunction` on a function without a stable return type and then calling
the function through the returned function pointer produces a segfault. We
discussed this on discourse, where we came up with several simple cases to
reproduce the issue. The simplest one seems to be:
    julia> f(x) = x ? 1 : 2.0
    f (generic function with 1 method)
    julia> fptr = @cfunction(f, Any, (Bool,))
    Ptr{Nothing} @0x00007effcbe85e00
    julia> ccall(fptr, Any, (Bool,), true)
    Unreachable reached at 0x7effcbe85f2a
    signal (4): Illegal instruction
