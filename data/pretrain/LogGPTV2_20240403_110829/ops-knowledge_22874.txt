Assistant: This log chunk shows the system performing various tasks related to network connections, security, and Thunderbolt connections. The kernel is denying network-outbound requests from various software components, the secd process is having trouble syncing with a device, SpotlightNetHelper is failing to create global data, and networkd is experiencing a torpedo hit. Additionally, IOThunderboltSwitch is unplugging a port, locationd is changing an icon state, and IO80211AWDLPeerManager is setting an AWDL operation mode.
