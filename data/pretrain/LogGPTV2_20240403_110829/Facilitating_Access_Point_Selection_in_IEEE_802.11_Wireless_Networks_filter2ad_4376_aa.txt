Abstract
The performance experienced by wireless clients in IEEE
802.11 wireless networks heavily depends on the clients’
ability to identify the Access Point (AP) that will offer the
best service. The current AP afﬁliation mechanism imple-
mented in most wireless clients is based on signal strength
measurements received by the client from all the APs in its
neighborhood. The client then afﬁliates with the AP from
which it receives the strongest signal. It is well-known that
such an algorithm can lead to sub-optimal performance,
due to its ignorance of the load at different APs.
In this work, we consider the problem of AP selection.
We identify potential bandwidth as the metric based on
which hosts should make afﬁliation decisions, and deﬁne it
as the (MAC-layer) bandwidth that the client is likely to re-
ceive after afﬁliating with a particular AP. We further limit
ourselves to the use of passive measurements that do not
require an end-host to afﬁliate with the AP, thus allowing
the end-host to simultaneously evaluate the potential band-
width to multiple APs in range. This can also facilitate
more informed roaming decisions. We propose a method-
ology for the estimation of potential upstream and down-
stream bandwidth between a client and an AP based on
measurements of delay incurred by 802.11 Beacon frames
from the AP. Preliminary experiments conducted in a con-
trolled environment demonstrate that the proposed method-
ology looks promising, yielding fairly accurate results un-
der varying conditions.

Introduction
There has been an enormous growth in the adoption of
IEEE 802.11 wireless networks in the last few years. The
ease of installation and the low infrastructure cost of 802.11
networks makes them ideal for network access in ofﬁces,
malls, airports, cafes, hotels and so on. The widespread de-
ployment of IEEE 802.11 networks means that a wireless
client is often in the vicinity of multiple APs with which to
afﬁliate. The selection of the AP that the client decides to
afﬁliate with needs to be done carefully since it will dictate
the client’s eventual performance.
The conventional approach to access point selection is
based on received signal strength measurements from the
access points within range. However, it has been pointed
out in several papers [1, 2, 4] that afﬁliation based on signal
strength can lead to very bad performance for the end-host,
since the signal-strength metric does not convey informa-
tion regarding other attributes that affect end-host perfor-
mance, such as the AP load and the amount of contention
on the wireless medium.
In this paper, we describe how an end-host can take the
aforementioned attributes into account while choosing an
access point to afﬁliate with. We identify a metric that can
capture the bandwidth that an end-host is likely to receive if
it were to afﬁliate with a given access point, which we call
potential bandwidth. The MAC-layer bandwidth offered by
different wireless networks in the vicinity of the wireless
client is a desirable metric as it takes into account the AP
load, the contention on the wireless medium, as well as the
signal strength.
In designing an afﬁliation algorithm based on poten-
tial bandwidth estimation, several constraints must be
taken into consideration. The algorithm needs to be non-
intrusive, i.e.
it should not introduce additional overhead
to the APs or their afﬁliated users. The algorithm should
not require any changes at the AP side, if possible. More
importantly, such an algorithm should be able to estimate
potential bandwidth without previous afﬁliation with the
several APs within range. Such a constraint minimizes the
amount of time a client spends in the evaluation of the sev-
eral choices it may have (since it does not associate and
dis-associate with the different APs), while allowing for
the continuous evaluation of AP performance even when an
afﬁliation has taken place1. The latter implies that a wire-

quency. In the case of roaming, the client will be able to quantify potential

less client implementing the proposed functionality will be
able to make more informed and efﬁcient roaming deci-
sions, continuously quantifying the performance of all APs
in range.
In this paper, we propose a methodology for the estima-
tion of potential bandwidth between a given AP and an end-
host that fulﬁlls the aforementioned requirements. The pro-
posed methodology does not require the end-host to change
its current afﬁliation and introduces very little overhead.
Unlike [1, 2], the afﬁliation algorithm proposed in this pa-
per is end-host initiated and therefore, does not necessitate
changes at the AP.
In a nutshell, our approach to potential bandwidth es-
timation relies on passive measurements of the timings of
beacon frames sent out by an AP. Beacon frames are broad-
cast by APs periodically, and are used by APs to announce
their identity as well as for the synchronization of the entire
network. The delay between the time when a beacon frame
is scheduled for transmission and its eventual transmission
captures the load of the AP and the contention inside the
network, conditions that the client would face if afﬁliated
with that AP. The corresponding delay of data frames pro-
vides an estimate for the bandwidth a client will receive
from the AP downstream. Upstream potential bandwidth
estimation relies on frames sent by the client to the AP in
the unafﬁliated state and is based on a similar methodology
that quantiﬁes the respective delays.
Our technique can be used as part of an AP selection
mechanism or for the evaluation of a wireless network’s
health. We evaluate its accuracy using controlled exper-
iments in a low-noise environment. Preliminary experi-
ments indicate that our approach yields fairly accurate es-
timates of the actual bandwidth from the AP to end-host,
indicating that our approach looks promising.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows.
In the
next section, we describe related work. In Section 3, we
describe our potential bandwidth estimation scheme. We
discuss experimental results in Section 4. Finally, we con-
clude and describe in detail future directions in Section 5.
2 Related Work
The conventional AP selection mechanism, based on sig-
nal strength measurements, has been shown to lead to poor
user experience [1, 2, 7] and highly unbalanced load dis-
tribution among APs [4]. Due to these shortcomings there
have been several alternative proposals which typically fall
in one of three categories: (i) AP-assisted [3, 7, 1], (ii)
centralized [2], and (iii) active [8] solutions. In this work
we take a step back and look at the fundamental require-
ments of the AP selection problem. Based on the identiﬁed
requirements, we propose a technique that does not require
bandwidth only for the APs residing in the same frequency.
the assistance of the AP, does not require previous afﬁlia-
tion of the client with an AP, and is initiated by the client
without the need for central coordination. Such properties
allow for the continuous evaluation of the “quality” of all
APs within range that could also facilitate better roaming
decisions.
Our work targets the estimation of the potential band-
width and not the available bandwidth as in [5], which is
deﬁned as the maximum rate at which a host can send its
data without lowering the sending rates of other already af-
ﬁliated hosts.
In this work, we are not interested in the
bandwidth available to a client before afﬁliation, but the
MAC-layer bandwidth the client will receive after it afﬁl-
iates with the AP. In addition, we do not aim to estimate
the layer-3 throughput that a client would receive once af-
ﬁliated with an AP, since such an estimation would require
knowledge of the client’s workload and its path through
the wired network. The metric of potential bandwidth can
characterize the wireless part of the client’s connections. In
future work, we intend to look into passive measurement
techniques that could allow us to extend our estimates to
account for the wired part of the network, say by passively
observing the performance currently experienced by other
users in the same wireless network.
The closest recent work to ours is [6], where the authors
propose a methodology for passive bandwidth estimation
between two communicating wireless stations. However,
their method does not provide an estimate of the potential
bandwidth that an end-host is likely to receive on a wireless
link with another host (when one of the hosts is not part of
the network yet).
3 Potential Bandwidth Estimation
In this section, we describe how an end-host can estimate
both the potential upstream and downstream bandwidth be-
tween the AP and itself. The ﬁnal afﬁliation decision made
by the end-host is going to be some function of the up-
stream and downstream bandwidth and is likely to depend
on the user’s requirements. For the remainder of this work,
we assume that the client has credentials to associate with
any AP within range and selects the AP offering the high-
est bandwidth in the direction the client will use for its data
transfer. We begin by providing a brief background of the
IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol for data transmission.
3.1 Background
The protocol for data transmission is the same regardless
of whether the transmitter is an AP or an afﬁliated host.
Each node (including the AP) that has data to transmit in an
IEEE 802.11 network ﬁrst senses the channel for a duration
equal to DIF S (Distributed Inter-Frame Sequence). If the
node determines the channel to be idle for this duration,

then the node enters a back-off stage, in which it delays
its transmission by a random number of time slots (each
slot of duration SLOT ) chosen from the interval [0, CW ],
where CW is called the contention window size.
If the
channel is still idle at the end of the back-off stage, then
the node transmits a Request-to-Send (RT S) frame to the
intended receiver. On receiving the RT S frame, the re-
ceiver responds back with a Clear-to-Send (CT S) frame
to the sender after a delay equal to Short Inter-Frame Se-
quence (SIF S). Nodes, other than the sender or the re-
ceiver, that hear either the RT S or the CT S frame delay
their transmissions until after the end of the data transmis-
sion between the sender and the receiver, as speciﬁed in
the duration ﬁeld of the RT S and CT S frames. Upon re-
ceiving the CT S frame, the sender waits for a duration of
SIF S and sends its data frame. Finally, the receiver re-
sponds back with an ACK frame to acknowledge the re-
ceipt of DAT A frame. The absence of either a CT S or
ACK frame causes the sender to timeout and re-transmit
the RT S frame or the DAT A frame respectively. Many
implementations also allow nodes to simply turn on or dis-
able the RT S/CT S handshake. In this case, nodes directly
transmit their data frames, on determining the channel to be
idle at the end of the backoff stage.
We ﬁrst describe our methodology to estimate the down-
stream bandwidth from an AP to an end-host in the ab-
sence of RT S/CT S handshake and then describe how
the RT S/CT S handshake mechanism can be accommo-
dated into the estimation scheme. We also discuss how an
end-host can determine its upstream bandwidth to an AP.
We initially ignore losses and subsequently, describe how
losses can be accounted for in Section 3.5.
3.2 Beacon Delays
In order to estimate the downstream bandwidth from the ac-
cess point to an end-host, we propose a methodology that
allows the end-host to estimate the delays of the periodic
Beacon frames sent from an access point. Figure 1 illus-
trates how beacon frame transmissions are handled at an ac-
cess point. As seen from the ﬁgure, an access point sched-
Figure 1: Beacon Transmissions at an Access Point
ules a Beacon frame every beacon interval (typically, 102.4
ms). The time instant at which the access point schedules
the next beacon message is referred to as the Target Bea-
con Transmission Time (T BT T ). As per the 802.11 stan-
dard, time zero is deﬁned to be a T BT T . Given the value
of the beacon interval, the end-host knows the exact time
instants when beacon messages are scheduled for transmis-
sion. Once a beacon message is scheduled, it is transmit-
ted according to the normal frame transmission rules. In
this paper, we assume that beacon frames are not priori-
tized over other frames, as implemented in the APs used in
our experiments. Handling beacon frame prioritization is
an interesting extension and will be considered in our fu-
ture work. The time difference between the instant when
a beacon message transmission begins (as obtained from
the timestamp ﬁeld of the Beacon frame) and the T BT T
yields an estimate of the beacon delay, TB, which is the
total time spent by a beacon frame at the access point wait-
ing for transmission. Since we assume that beacon frames
are not prioritized over other frames, TB provides an esti-
mate of the total queuing delay plus the contention delay
that will be experienced by a data frame transmitted by the
AP. Note that beacon delays are computed solely based on
timestamps provided by the access point and thus, synchro-
nization issues do not arise.
We now proceed to describe how we can use observed
beacon delays to estimate the downstream bandwidth from
an AP to a mobile host.
