Question: A web application utilizes a microservice-based architecture, with multiple services running in containers orchestrated by Kubernetes, and exposed through a single API gateway. When conducting security testing on this application, which of the following factors should you consider?
"A": "Since the microservices run on Kubernetes, no authentication testing is required as Kubernetes ensures secure authentication for all services.",
"B": "Testing should include an assessment of the API gateway for potential misconfigurations that could lead to unauthorized access to individual microservices.",
"C": "You should focus exclusively on static storage security, as microservices typically do not handle dynamic content or databases.",
"D": "The use of multiple languages in microservices can suggest their presence, which may be verified by looking for detailed error messages."
