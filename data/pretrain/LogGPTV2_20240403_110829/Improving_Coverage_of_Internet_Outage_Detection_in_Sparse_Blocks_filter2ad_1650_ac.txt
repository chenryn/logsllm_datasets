between 2FR-FBS and Trinocular during 2017q4 as seen from six sites. Dataset A30.
longer or more blocks were not sparse, there would be no attenuation. A lower
FBS threshold ( ˆA3F R) of 0.15 trims only 15% of events. However, we choose to
leave FBS threshold at 0.2 to avoid overﬁtting our parameters to Iraq.
Random Sampling of Outage Events. Finally, we conﬁrm our results with
a random sample of events. We select 50 random blocks that show some outage
from the Trinocular 2017q4 dataset, then a best-estimate ground truth through
manual examination. Table 2 shows the confusion matrix after applying FBS. Of
the total 5200 down events detected by Trinocular, FBS ﬁxes 4133 (79% are false
outages), misses 621 down events (12% are not ﬁxed, but should have been), and
conﬁrms 446 true down events (9% are not changed). The FBS Error Rate is
0.12 (621 false outages of 5200 events), so it is fairly successful at removing noise.
Many of the false outages are due to moderately sparse blocks (0.2  0.8

duration of a FR depends how many addresses are considered in the block (E(b))
and how active they are ( ˆA(E(b))).
To analyze FBS changes to temporal precision, we consider repaired events,
false down events corrected by FBS, and accepted events, true down events that
pass through FBS unchanged. LABR does not aﬀect temporal precision.
We study FBS eﬀects by examining the 2017q4 outage dataset (A30) from
one site (Los Angeles). Most blocks (2.8M blocks, 70%) are never aﬀected by
FBS because they are not sparse or do not have an outage. For the remaining
1.2M blocks that are at some point sparse ( ˆA3F R < 0.2) and for which Trinocular
reports an outage, we examine each outage event.
We ﬁrst examine the 308M events that FBS repairs (the top left, red line in
Fig. 5, 1.2M blocks). We see that for about half the cases (53% of the events),
FBS repairs a single-round of outage in 11 min. Almost all the remaining events
are recovered in 15 or fewer rounds, as expected. Only a tiny fraction (0.5%)
