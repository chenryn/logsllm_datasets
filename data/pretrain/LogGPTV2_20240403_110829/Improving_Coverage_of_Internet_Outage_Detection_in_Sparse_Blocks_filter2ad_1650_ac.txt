### Comparison between 2FR-FBS and Trinocular in 2017Q4

**Dataset A30:**
- **Comparison Context:** The comparison between 2FR-FBS and Trinocular was conducted during the fourth quarter of 2017, using data from six sites.
- **Sparse Blocks and Attenuation:** If blocks were longer or less sparse, there would be no attenuation. A lower FBS threshold (ˆA3F R) of 0.15 would trim only 15% of events. However, to avoid overfitting our parameters, especially for Iraq, we set the FBS threshold at 0.2.

### Random Sampling of Outage Events
- **Validation Method:** To validate our results, we performed a random sampling of outage events. We selected 50 random blocks that showed some outages from the Trinocular 2017Q4 dataset and manually examined them to establish a best-estimate ground truth.
- **Confusion Matrix Results:**
  - **Total Down Events Detected by Trinocular:** 5200
  - **Corrected by FBS (False Outages):** 4133 (79%)
  - **Missed by FBS (True Outages Not Fixed):** 621 (12%)
  - **Confirmed by FBS (True Outages):** 446 (9%)

- **FBS Error Rate:** 0.12 (621 false outages out of 5200 events), indicating that FBS is fairly successful at removing noise. Many false outages are due to moderately sparse blocks (0.2 < ˆA3F R < 0.8).

### Block Categorization
- **Block Categories:**
  - **(a) Mostly Up Blocks:** IPv4 responsive, Trinocular trackable
  - **(b) Infrequently Down Blocks:** # down events < 5
  - **(c) Non-Sparse Blocks:** ˆA3F R ≥ 0.2
  - **(d) FBS Considered Overlap with (c):** FBS trackable, ˆA3F R < 0.2, |E(b)| ≥ 3

- **Block Characteristics:**
  - **Mostly Up Blocks (a):** 100%
  - **Infrequently Down Blocks (b):** 95%
  - **Non-Sparse Blocks (c):** 93%
  - **FBS Considered (d):** 78%
  - **FBS Trackable (d):** 30%

- **Duration of FR:** The duration of a FR depends on the number of addresses considered in the block (E(b)) and their activity level (ˆA(E(b))).

### Temporal Precision Analysis
- **Event Types:**
  - **Repaired Events:** False down events corrected by FBS
  - **Accepted Events:** True down events that pass through FBS unchanged
  - **LABR Impact:** LABR does not affect temporal precision.

- **Dataset Analysis:**
  - **Total Blocks Analyzed:** 2.8M blocks (70%) are never affected by FBS because they are not sparse or do not have an outage.
  - **Sparse and Outage-Affected Blocks:** 1.2M blocks (30%) are at some point sparse (ˆA3F R < 0.2) and reported as having an outage by Trinocular.

- **Repair Time Analysis:**
  - **Repaired Events (308M):** 
    - **Single-Round Repair (53%):** FBS repairs a single round of outage in 11 minutes.
    - **Remaining Events (47%):** Almost all remaining events are recovered in 15 or fewer rounds.
    - **Long-Term Repairs (0.5%):** A very small fraction of events take more than 15 rounds to recover.

This structured approach provides a clear and detailed analysis of the FBS performance and its impact on outage detection and repair.
