System information
Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script
provided in TensorFlow): yes  
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): 20.04  
I have implemented a classification model , which has Batchnormalization
layers into it. While training the model , i used
`tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization` layer for training. Then manually
extracted the bn weights (gamma, beta, mean , var) from checkpoint file and
called the bn using `tf.nn.batch_normalization` layer using above statistics
for inference. I observed a drop in testing accuracy (~75%) as compared to the
scenario where i load the weights in the model using keras itself
model.load_weights(chkpnt_file) (~92%).  
Though if i replace the `tf.nn.batch_normalization` call to keras bn layer
call by calling set_weights function , both the cases gived 0.0 diff, which
apprently led me to believe that there is diff in both the calls while the
input and bn_weights are exactly same. epsilon is also same.
Standalone code to reproduce the issue  
Please refer to this colab
notebook(https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nysYyCR5Ay_jkPlh1WD9A1Mf01eVvhMu?
usp=sharing) for a small example. Here the error is coming to be a margin of
10^-3 which theoretically shouldn't be there.
