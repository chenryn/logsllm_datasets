After updating Deno to the latest version (1.2.0), I encountered two errors:

1. **Error: TS2345**
   - **Message:** Argument of type 'string | URL' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.
     - Type 'URL' is not assignable to type 'string'.
   - **Code Snippet:**
     ```typescript
     return new URL(url).pathname;
     ```
   - **Location:**
     - `https://deno.land/std@v0.53.0/path/win32.ts:911:18`
     - `https://deno.land/std@v0.53.0/path/posix.ts:433:18`

I have a global `deps.ts` file with dependencies, and they are up to date at version 0.61.0. Additionally, I tried running with the `-L debug` argument, but it did not provide any further information.

**Question:**
Do you have any suggestions on how I can locate and resolve this issue?
