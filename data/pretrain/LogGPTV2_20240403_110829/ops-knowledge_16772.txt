User: I have a simple script I wrote, and when trying to run it (F5) , I get this msg:

================== RESTART: C:\Users\***\Desktop\tst.py ==================

I restarted the shell, reopened the script, but still, the same msg appears.
I use python 3.5.1 and I tried to simplify the script as much as possible, but I still get this result. Now my script is only one line with a simple print(1) command and I still get this msg.
Was there something wrong with the shell installation?
Assistant: CIsForCookies, my guess is that you don't actually have a complete script; maybe you have just a function definition and you haven't included a line to run that function. (I had this problem and then remembered to call the function I defined; the problem went away.)
