`fit_generator()` seems to keep consuming memory throughout an epoch if
objects defined inside the generator class are not converted into a numpy
array. RAM keeps on getting filled until an epoch ends. For large enough
datasets, this leads to RAM completely filling up before a single epoch is
completed.
Is it possible that the objects keep getting duplicated?
Python = 3.6.6  
Keras = 2.2.4  
Tensorflow = 1.12.0
Here is a sample script to reproduce the issue.
