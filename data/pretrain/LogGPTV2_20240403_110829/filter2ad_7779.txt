## Abstract
The Domain Name System (DNS) is a fundamental component of the Internet's infrastructure. Monitoring changes in the DNS over time provides valuable insights into the evolution of the Internet. Currently, the only large-scale method for such measurements is passive DNS (pDNS), which, while useful for security applications, does not provide sufficient data to reliably track DNS changes over time. We propose a complementary approach based on active measurements, which generates a unique and comprehensive dataset on the evolution of the DNS. Our high-performance infrastructure queries over 50% of the DNS name space daily, designed from the ground up to support big data analysis, such as on a Hadoop cluster. This novel approach aims to significantly advance DNS-based measurement and analysis of the Internet.

## 1. Introduction
After IP, DNS is arguably the most critical infrastructure on the Internet. Almost all networked applications and services rely on DNS to map names to IP addresses. Therefore, measuring DNS content can provide significant insights into the state of the Internet. Systematic, long-term measurements allow us to observe the evolution of the Internet.

### Applications of Measuring DNS Over Time
- **Network Security:** Historical DNS data can help track malicious activity by mapping past associations between IP addresses and domain names.
- **Network Research:** DNS data over time provides empirical information about operational practices and the deployment of new protocols. For example, understanding the adoption of cloud email providers over time requires DNS data (e.g., MX records).

### Passive DNS (pDNS)
pDNS, driven by security benefits, collects data from the link between recursive caching name servers and authoritative name servers. While pDNS is useful for tracking malicious activity, it lacks reliability over time because:
1. It only records data for domains that clients behind the resolvers are interested in.
2. It has no control over the temporal spacing of queries.

### Our Approach
To address these limitations, we developed an active measurement approach. Using DNS zone files from top-level domains (TLDs), we send a fixed set of queries for each domain in a TLD once every 24 hours. This approach allows us to control the behavior of the querying clients, providing reliable and consistent data. 

## 2. Infrastructure

### 2.1 High-Level Overview
Our measurement setup is divided into three stages:
1. **Input Collection:** Collect DNS zones for TLDs, compute daily deltas, and track zone content and changes over time in a database.
2. **Main Measurement:** Perform active DNS queries using a cloud-based cluster.
3. **Aggregation and Preparation for Analysis:** Convert the output to the Parquet columnar storage format, suitable for Hadoop cluster processing.

### 2.2 Main Measurement
- **Cluster Management:** Each TLD measurement is orchestrated by a cluster management host, distributing work to worker nodes.
- **Worker Nodes:** Custom-built software performs predefined DNS queries for each domain in a chunk of work.
- **Data Aggregation:** Data collected by workers is sent to a central aggregation point for further processing and analysis.

### 2.3 Analysis
We store data in a format suitable for Hadoop cluster processing. We use map/reduce operations and advanced analysis tools like the Impala query engine for in-depth analysis.

## 3. Case Study
We analyzed the use of cloud mail platforms (Microsoft Office 365 and Google Apps) over a 50-day period. Figure 3 shows the growth in the fraction of domains per TLD using these platforms. Our platform processed over 84 billion query results, and the analysis was completed in about 7.5 hours on a single 40-core node.

This case study demonstrates the potential of our measurement platform, showing how the Internet is evolving towards bulk service provision by a few large providers.

## 4. Conclusions and Future Work
We have created a unique active measurement infrastructure for the DNS, capable of measuring over 50% of the total DNS name space daily. This dataset enables reliable DNS-based analysis of the Internet's evolution. We invite other researchers to collaborate with us and plan to create a web portal with daily statistics. Several research projects are already underway, leveraging this platform to investigate various Internet phenomena.
