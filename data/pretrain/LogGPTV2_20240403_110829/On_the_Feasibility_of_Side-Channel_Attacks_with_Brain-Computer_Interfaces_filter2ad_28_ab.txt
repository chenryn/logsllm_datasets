were partially cooperating in an attack situation and were
following our instructions. However, we minimized the
interaction between the supervisor and subjects to sim-
ulate a realistic environment, where a user is only inter-
acting with his computer (see Appendix A).
4 Experimental Design and Results
The main question, which this paper attempts to answer
is: Can the signal captured by a consumer-grade EEG
device be used to extract potentially sensitive informa-
tion from the users? In the following, we detail the tech-
nical setup, the experimental design, and the analytical
methods of our experiments.
Figure 4: Experimental setup. The instructor sits be-
hind the curtain to minimize interaction during the ex-
periments. In this case, a sequence of credit cards is pre-
sented to the user.
4.1 The Setup
After obtaining the approval of the Institutional Review
Board (IRB), we recruited 30 Computer Science students
for the experiments. For two participants, the experi-
ments could not be conducted due to faulty equipment
(low battery on the EEG device). Of the 28 participants
remaining, 18 were male and 10 female. In total, the ex-
periment lasted about 40 minutes. The participants were
informed that they were going to participate in an exper-
iment involving the privacy implications of using gam-
ing EEG devices, but we explained neither the details of
the experiment nor our objectives. Each participant was
seated in front of the computer used for the experiments
(see Figure 4). The operator then proceeded to mount the
Emotiv EEG device on the participants.
4.2 The Protocol
After the initial setup, the participants were asked to try
to remain relaxed for the entire duration of the experi-
ments, as blinking or other face movements cause signif-
icant noise. The exact script used during the experiments
can be found in Appendix A. The interaction with the
participants was kept as short and concise as possible.
The order of the experiments was kept ﬁxed in the order
found in Appendix A.
Each experiment consisted of three main steps:
1. (Optional) Brief verbal explanation of the task by
the operator;
2. (Optional) Message on screen for 2 seconds;
3. Images being ﬂashed in random order for the dura-
tion of the experiment.

4.3.2 Experiment 1: Pin Code
This experiment has the goal to gather partial informa-
tion about a user’s chosen 4-digit PIN. Given the sen-
sitivity in studying the users’ real PINs, we asked the
participants to choose and memorize a randomly gener-
ated PIN just for the experiment. Furthermore, the par-
ticipants were asked not to reveal the PIN until after the
end of the experiment session. The participants were told
that there were no special instructions for the experiment,
e.g., no counting numbers. They were just informed that,
at the end of the experiment, they would be asked to enter
the ﬁrst digit of their PIN (refer to Appendix A for the
exact script). In this way, we bring the information of in-
terest to the attention of the user which makes the subject
focus on the desired stimulus without requiring their ac-
tive support of the classiﬁer. After the instructions were
given, the operator started the experiment. There was no
on-screen message shown at the beginning of the exper-
iment. The experiment images consisted of a sequence
of randomly permuted numbers between 0 and 9 that
were shown on the screen one by one. Each number was
shown 16 times and the experiment lasted approximately
90 seconds.
4.3.3 Experiment 2: Bank Information
The aim of this experiment was to obtain the name of the
bank of the participant by reading their response to visual
stimuli that involved photos related to banks. The ﬁrst it-
eration of this experiment, whose results are not reported,
consisted of showing the logo of 10 different banks2. The
intuition was that the participants would show a higher
response when seeing the logo of their bank. However,
this attack was unsuccessful. After de-brieﬁng with the
early test participants, we realized that they simply rec-
ognized the logos of all the banks.
In the second and ﬁnal iteration of the experiment, we
showed two different sets of images: automatic teller ma-
chines (ATMs) and credit cards. Rationale for choosing
to display ATM or credit card photos, rather than logo
images, is that while users might be familiar with all lo-
gos, they might be only familiar with the look of their
own local bank ATM and debit card. The results are re-
ported in Section 5.
The protocol for this experiment was as follows. Each
participant was asked by the operator whether they were
a customer of one of the banks in a list. Four partici-
pants answered negatively, therefore the experiment was
skipped.
In case of an afﬁrmative answer, the experi-
ment was started. The screen in front of the participants
showed the question “What is the name of your bank?”

frame shows how the stimuli were ﬂashed on the screen.
Each image was shown to the users for a ﬁxed duration
of 250ms. On the screen in Figure 4, a photo is being
shown to a test participant.
The time of the target and non-target stimuli and the
stimulus identiﬁers were recorded alongside the raw sig-
nal coming from the EEG device. After the experiment,
we used the classiﬁcation techniques detailed in Sec-
tion 4.4 to infer information about the secrets of the par-
ticipant.
4.3 The Experimental Scenarios
In this section, we describe the calibration of the device
and six different experiments. In each experiment, the
attacker tries to gain information about a different secret.
Each experiment lasted approximately 90 seconds.
4.3.1 Training Phase
This experiment was set up to learn a model to detect the
P300 signal from each user. The users were presented
with a randomly permuted sequence of numbers from 0
to 9 and were asked by the operator to count the number
of occurrences of a target number x. Each number was
shown 16 times, with a stimulus duration of 250 ms and a
pause between stimuli randomly chosen between 250 ms
and 375 ms. At the end of experiment the participants
were asked for their count to check for correctness.
We also developed a method to calibrate the classiﬁer
without this active training phase. This could be used for
a concealed attack in cases where the intended applica-
tion of the user does not require the detection of P300.
We explain this on-the-ﬂy calibration phase in Section 5.

One interesting application of such an attack would be
scenarios in which the knowledge of particular individ-
ual is used as a form of authentication. For example,
in recent years, Facebook has started showing photos of
friends for the purpose of account veriﬁcation 3.
4.3.6 Experiment 5: Geographic Location
The purpose of this experiment was to accurately pin-
point the geographic location of the residence of the par-
ticipants. Each participant was asked if they lived in an
area close to campus. Eight participants in total did not
live close to campus and did not complete this experi-
ment. In case of an afﬁrmative answer, the participants
were shown a sequence of highlighted maps of an area of
approximately 4 square kilometers around campus. Each
image showed the same area overall, but with a different
highlighted zone on the map.
While IP addresses provide a rather accurate way to
localize the location of a user, there are cases in which
the users actively try to hide their geographic location
using proxies. Even though our experiment showed only
a predeﬁned map of a rather small geographic area, we
envision possible future attacks in which the true geo-
graphic location of a user is leaked by showing maps or
landmarks with increased accuracy.
While for all the other experiments we did not instruct
the user to do particular things except for watching the
screen, here we asked the users to count how often their
region was highlighted. This experiment was devised to
study the inﬂuence of active user support, as counting
assures a higher attention from the user which is known
to improve the detection of P300.
4.4 Analysis Methodology
In this section, we detail how the attacker processes and
analyzes the data and provide the speciﬁcation of the data
recorded by the BCI device.
Data characteristics and acquisition The data con-
sists of several parts. The amplitudes of the EEG signal
are recorded with 14 different electrodes. Each electrode
represents one ‘channel’ of the signal. According to the
standard 10-20 system [19], the 14 channels are called 1:
‘AF3’, 2: ‘F7’, 3: ‘F3’, 4: ‘FC5’, 5: ‘T7’, 6: ‘P7’, 7:
‘O1’, 8: ‘O2’, 9: ‘P8’, 10: ‘T8’, 11: ‘FC6’, 12: ‘F4’,
13: ‘F8’, and 14: ‘AF4’. The location of the channel
electrodes can be seen in Figure 7.
Each channel is recorded at a sampling rate of 128Hz.
The software for showing stimuli to the user outputs the
time stamp for each stimulus and the indicator of the

for 2 seconds. Then, for the ATM experiment, images of
teller machines were ﬂashed on the screen. For the credit
card experiment, images of credit cards were ﬂashed.
4.3.4 Experiment 3: Month of Birth
The operator did not give any speciﬁc instructions to the
participants and only informed them that the instructions
would be provided on the screen. The participants were
simply asked in which month they were born by an on-
screen message that lasted for 2 seconds, then, a ran-
domly permuted sequence of the names of the months
was shown on the screen.
In many access-restricted websites the date of birth or
similar information serves as a backup function for re-
setting a user’s password. If an attacker needs this infor-
mation, the BCI device could provide a potential attack
vector.
4.3.5 Experiment 4: Face Recognition
For this experiment,
the operator again did not give
any speciﬁc instruction to the participants and only in-
formed them that the instructions would be provided on
the screen. The participants were simply asked “Do you
know any of these people?” by an on-screen message
that lasted 2 seconds. Then the images of people were
randomly ﬂashed for the duration of the experiment.
The goal of this experiment was to understand whether
we could infer who the participants knew by reading their
EEG response when being showed a sequence of photos
of known and unknown people. We used photos of 10
unknown persons and one photo of the current President
of the United States of America, Barack Obama. The
photo of the president was chosen because, being in a
US institution, we were conﬁdent that each participant
would recognize the President.

stimulus. In this way, the EEG signal can be related to
the stimuli.
Figure 7: Position of the electrodes of the EPOC device.
As explained in Section 3, our attack vector exploits
the occurrence of P300 peaks in the EEG signal triggered
by target-stimuli. This requires the attacker to be able to
reliably detect these peaks and to discriminate them from
all other EEG signals measured on non-target stimuli.
This task is very similar to the P300-Speller, where the
EEG signal for the intended letter must be discriminated
from the signal of unintended letters (as described in Sec-
tion 2). However, in contrast to the spelling scenario the
attacker is dealing with a passive user. This makes an at-
tack much harder than spelling. In our case, the user does
not intend to provide a discriminative signal for the target
stimulus. This means that the user does not support the
classiﬁer with increased attention on the target stimulus,
as can be achieved, for instance, by counting the number
of occurrences of this stimulus. As a consequence, the
data available to the attacker is less discriminative be-
tween target and non-target stimuli than in the spelling
scenario.
An additional challenge for our attack is that the gam-
ing device we are using is not made for detecting P300.
For instance, they have more electrodes on the frontal
part of the scalp (see Figure 7). This enables them to rec-
ognize facial expressions which provide a stronger sig-
nal than the EEG signal itself and thus are more robust
for controlling games. The P300 is mostly detected at
the parietal lobe, optimally with electrodes attached at
Pz position, which is a centered on the median line at
the top of the head. As we want to investigate the attack
in a realistic home-use scenario we did not use other de-
vices optimized for P300 detection and did not adapt the
gaming device (for instance by turning it around, which
would provide more sampling points in the Pz area).
7
Classiﬁcation of target stimuli Detecting P300 in
EEG data is a binary classiﬁcation task. The input is a
set of epochs. Each epoch is associated with a stimulus.
In our setting a stimulus is an image depicted on a com-
puter screen in front of the user. Let nc be the number of
EEG channels and let f be the sampling rate of the de-
vice (in our case the signal is sampled with 128 Hz). An
epoch consists of nc time series starting tp milliseconds
prior to the stimulus and ending ta milliseconds after the
stimulus. The number of measurements per time series is
then q = (tp + ta)f. Typically, tp is a few hundred mil-
liseconds and ta is between 800 ms and 1500 ms. The
signals of all channels are concatenated and each epoch
is represented as a real vector x ∈ Rp, where p = qnc is
the dimensionality of the vector space.
The classiﬁcation task consists of two phases,
the
training phase and the classiﬁcation phase. The in-
put of the training phase is a set of epochs Xtr =
{xtr
i ∈ Rp, i = 1...n1} and a vector of labels y ∈
{0, 1}n1, where each label yi
indicates whether the
epoch xtr
i corresponds to a target stimulus (yi = 1) or
not (yi = 0). The signal of each epoch has been recorded
while the corresponding stimulus was shown to the user
