SGX processor (e.g., a cloud SGX server). We call such servers OPERA
Servers. To preserve the anonymity of the SGX platforms, OPERA
adopts the same group signature schemes used by IAS, i.e., the EPID
scheme. An IssueE is responsible for generating an EPID group
issuing key, which is used to issue member keys to AttestEs and
to produce group verification certificates (gvCert). To leverage IAS
to validate the authenticity of the IssueE, the ISV that launches the
IssueE must be registered with Intel and the attestation must go
through these ISVs. We call an OPERA-participating ISV an OPERA-
SV. From Intel’s point of view, each OPERA-SV is no different than
other ISVs.
The AttestE is launched on the SGX platform that requires
enclave attestation services. It communicates with the IssueE to
obtain a unique EPID member private key. The IssueE conducts a
remote attestation to validate the authenticity of AttestE. Then the
AttestE serves the local attestation requests from the ISV enclaves
(called IsvEs) and produces quotes (called OPERA quotes) that are
signed by its EPID private key. At least one AttestE is required
Session 10B: TEE IICCS ’19, November 11–15, 2019, London, United Kingdom2319to run on the same SGX platform with the IsvE to be attested;
multiple AttestEs can be launched to work with the same IssueE.
Each OPERA-SV must run its own frontend server to communicate
with IAS. We discuss in Sec. 6 how frontend servers can be hosted by
untrusted parties. The authenticity of both IssueEs and AttestEs
are guaranteed by the original Intel attestation procedure, with the
help of the OPERA-SV frontend server.
Operations. OPERA operates in three steps: registration, preparation,
and attestation. The registration step launches, validates, and regis-
ters an IssueE to OPERA; the preparation step launches an AttestE
on one SGX platform, validates its authenticity, and provisions the
EPID private key into the AttestE by running a provisioning pro-
tocol with an IssueE; the attestation step attests the authenticity
of an IsvE (i.e., ISV enclave) that run on the same machine as the
AttestE. The validation of IssueE and AttestE needs to be run
periodically to check the validity of the SGX platform using IAS
and establish trustworthiness of these enclaves.
The source code and the binaries of IssueEs and AttestEs are
published so that they can be scrutinized to perform the exact de-
sired actions, nothing less and more. For example, the only network
activities from an AttestE is through a provisioning protocol or
through a self-validation procedure. As long as the code follows
these protocols and nothing more, it can be assured that no infor-
mation regarding the ISVs or the SGX platforms will be collected
by OPERA. Furthermore, as each IsvE communicates only with the
AttestE, the ISV could assure that its identity will neither be leaked
to Intel.
To enable the ISVs to verify the authenticity of IsvE, AttestE,
and IssueE directly from the OPERA quotes, OPERA adopts the con-
cept of certificates and accompanies the quotes with a chain of
certificates, including an EPID group certificate (gvCert) gener-
ated by IssueE that endorse the authenticity of AttestE and a
certificate-type structure from IAS that endorses the validity of
IssueE. SGX platform’s anonymity is preserved by adopting the
EPID scheme, as the ISVs cannot differentiate one SGX platform
from another by looking at their EPID signatures. Additional cares
must be taken for the anonymity guarantees, however, which we
will detail in Sec. 3.
3 DESIGN OF OPERA
In this section, we detail the design of the open attestation ser-
vice. In Sec. 3.1, we describe the registration step for setting up one
IssueE to OPERA; in Sec. 3.2, we describe preparation step for set-
ting up one AttestE on an SGX platform; in Sec. 3.3, we describe
the attestation step for an ISV enclave; in Sec. 3.4, we explain the
revocation process.
3.1 Registration
This step sets up an IssueE and registers it with OPERA. Then a
validation procedure is executed to generate a fresh group verifica-
tion certificate (gvCert) for the IssueE. The validation procedure
is executed periodically (e.g., daily) to guarantee that the security
level of the SGX processor it runs upon is up-to-date.
Figure 4: Validation protocol of IssueE
IssueE setup. An IssueE is launched on an untrusted OPERA server.
After launching, the IssueE first generates inside the enclave mem-
ory an issuing private key and the corresponding group public key.
As the issuing private key is protected by SGX, the OPERA Server
cannot learn its content. A copy of the issuing private key will be
sealed for backup. An issuing private key represents an EPID group
and is used to produce EPID member private keys for each AttestE.
An IssueE also creates two empty revocation lists during its setup:
one for private key revocation and the other for signature-based
revocation as described in Intel’s documentation [22].
IssueE validation. After setup, the IssueE generates a group ver-
ification certificate (gvCert) for the EPID group. The certificate
should include the group public key, revocation lists, and a cryp-
tographic proof of their authenticity. OPERA achieves this using
Intel SGX’s remote attestation with the help of a frontend server
run by an OPERA-SV. The IssueE uses Intel’s quoting enclave to
generate an IAS quote with the hash of the group public key and
revocation lists as the report data, and sends the IAS quote to the
frontend software to be forwarded to IAS. The IAS verification
report (returned from IAS and signed by Intel) can be used as a
proof of the authenticity of the public key and the revocation lists.
The certificate expires after a short period, e.g., a day [24], so that
the IssueE needs to periodically re-validate itself and produce a
fresh gvCert. IAS checks if the Intel-issued EPID private key has
been revoked or if the CPU is up-to-date, which is essential to the
security of OPERA. Therefore, periodic re-validation is important.
Since OPERA servers are not trusted, we need to be careful when
designing the validation protocol. Basically, we need a reliable
way, e.g., a timestamp to represent the freshness of a gvCert. Note
that the IAS verification report contains a timestamp from the IAS,
which can be used as the timestamp of the gvCert. However, IAS
quotes used to produce IAS verification reports do not include any
time information. It is possible for the OPERA server to send an
outdated IAS quote to IAS to obtain an IAS verification report from
Intel with a new timestamp, so that the OPERA server might be able
to refresh an expired gvCert without interacting the IssueE.
One intuitive solution is to maintain an internal timestamp in-
side IssueE, and include the timestamp in the gvCert. The IssueE
could use valid IAS verification reports to update this timestamp.

However, such a design requires two rounds of Intel’s remote attes-
tation for each validation, one for updating the timestamp and the
other for generating the gvCert with the updated timestamp.
timestamp as input to the IssueE.
Hence, we adopted a commit-and-reveal method which requires
only one round of Intel’s remote attestation per validation. The
protocol for updating the certificate is shown in Fig. 4. Specifically,
when requesting a new certificate,
• The OPERA Server software first passes a current (untrusted)
• The IssueE then picks a random nonce, calculates the hash
value of the group public key, hash values of the revocation lists,
the timestamp provided by OPERA server, and the generated
nonce. The hash value will then be used to generate a new IAS
quote to be sent to IAS.
• After receiving the IAS verification report, IssueE checks the
timestamp of the IAS verification report and timestamp given
by the OPERA Server software. If their difference is small, e.g.,
less than 5 seconds, IssueE reveals the nonce and outputs the
verification certificate.
The timestamp of the IAS verification report is used as the times-
tamp of the gvCert. Here the revealed nonce enforces that the
timestamp of an acceptable IAS verification report should be close
(with a small difference) to the IssueE timestamp present in the
gvCert. The structure of the certificate is shown in Table 1.
3.2 Preparation
This step sets up an AttestE on an SGX platform. The validation
procedure is executed periodically (e.g., daily) to ensure that the
SGX processor is up-to-date.
AttestE setup. An AttestE will be launched on an SGX platform.
It will then run a provisioning protocol (as illustrated in Fig. 5) with
an IssueE:
• The AttestE sends to the OPERA server an EPID provisioning
• After receiving the request, IssueE generates a nonce, and then
• The AttestE verifies gvCert, and generates an EPID private key
using the nonce received in Msg 2. A proof of knowledge [10] is

request (Msg 1).
Figure 5: OPERA provisioning flow
generated to prove that AttestE does possess the private key.
The hash value of the proof will be used as the report data to
generate an IAS quote. This quote and the proof itself will be
sent back to IssueE (Msg 3).
• After receiving Msg 3, IssueE sends the quote to the OPERA-SV
frontend, which forwards the quote to IAS. The returned IAS
verification report can be used to authenticate to IssueE that the
AttestE runs on trusted SGX CPU and its measurement matches
the expected value (hardcoded in IssueE). IssueE calculates a
certificate of the EPID private key and sends it back to AttestE
(Msg 4). The provisioning protocol concludes.
AttestE validation. Similar to IssueE, AttestE also needs to peri-
odically perform an attestation with IAS to validate the authenticity
of the underlying SGX platform. Each attestation is performed us-
ing a fresh nonce as its report data. The AttestE maintains an
internal timestamp to record the most recent time its environment
is verified. After receiving the IAS verification report correspond-
ing to the same nonce, AttestE will update the timestamp using
the one from the report. This timestamp will be sent to the ISV
during attestation to inform the ISV about the time of most recent
validation. To prevent the resolution of the timestamp from being
abused by ISVs to de-anonymize the SGX platform, the timestamp
is discretized (e.g., to date, when the validation is performed daily).
The SGX trusted platform service provides a rich set of function-
ality for enclaves running on the SGX platform. Although AttestE
itself does not use any such services, it records the status of the
SGX trusted platform services, e.g., whether the services are up-to-
date, so that it is able to provide such information to the attested
enclaves that use the services. In addition, the SGX platform also
keeps an up-to-date gvCert and revocation lists that are retrieved
periodically from the IssueE.
3.3 Attestation
Once the registration and preparation steps are completed, the SGX
platform can allow ISVs to leverage OPERA for remote attestation.
When an IsvE needs to attest itself to the ISV or a third party
(possibly upon requests), it first generates a report, with a message
it would like to communicate with the ISV as the report data, to
be transferred to the AttestE via local attestation. The AttestE

verifies the IsvE’s report and then signs a data structure containing
the report, the timestamp of AttestE, and the status of the SGX
trusted platform service, using its EPID private key. The resulting
quote is called OPERA quote. The structure of the OPERA quote is
shown in Table 2.
The OPERA quote, the gvCert, and the revocation lists are sent
back to the ISV. The ISV then verifies that (1) the gvCert is valid—
the IAS verification report is properly signed by Intel and reflects
the integrity of the gvCert; (2) the EPID signature is verified to be
valid; (3) the timestamps of the IAS verification report, IssueE and
AttestE are up-to-date; (4) The measurements of the IssueE and
IsvE are valid; (5) Optionally, the pseManifest status is valid; (6)
IsvE’s report reflects the integrity of the attestation data. After the
verification, the remote party could be assured that the report data
is indeed generated by the specific IsvE running on a trusted SGX
platform.
We describe an example attestation scheme to demonstrate how
to use OPERA to derive a shared Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)
key between an ISV and its IsvE. The attestation workflow is illus-
trated in Fig. 6.
Specifically, the attestation is accomplished in the following four
steps:
• The ISV software first generates a nonce and an ECDH pri-
vate/public key pair (a, дa), and then sends the nonce and ECDH
public key дa to the IsvE launched on a SGX platform.
• The IsvE generates an ECDH private/public key pair (b, дb), and
derives the shared ECDH key дab following standard ECDH
protocol, from its own ECDH private key b and the received
ECDH public key дa such that дab = (дa)b. The hash value of
the received ECDH public key дa, its own ECDH public key дb,
and the nonce is used as the report data to generate a report
and send it to the AttestE.
• The AttestE verifies the IsvE’s report and then generates an
OPERA quote. Then the OPERA quote, the ECDH public key дb,
gvCert, and the revocation lists are sent back to the ISV soft-
ware.
• The ISV software verifies (1) the gvCert, (2) the EPID signature,
(3) the timestamps of the IAS verification report, IssueE and
AttestE, (4) The measurements of the IssueE and IsvE, (5)
