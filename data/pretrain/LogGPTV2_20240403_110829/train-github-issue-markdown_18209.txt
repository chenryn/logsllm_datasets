Is it possible to keep a reference on a scene's object ?  
When we do :
    this.scene.add(meshObject);
When I make it, my object is add in the scene and it is "lost" in the property
"children" which is an array.  
I must search the object in the scene's property "children" to modify the
object that I display.  
I would like keep a link on this object and when I modify my object through
this link I would modify directly the contents of the scene.
Like a say precedently I remarked that objects which are displayed are in
scene's children property. isn't it possible to have a tree on this property
to classify object.  
By example I have several objects, some of them are cubes other are circles,
and I would like classify them in the scene.  
Like you can see on the following picture :

In this way I could apply a modification on all cubes easily without run all
array's member. If I try to set it, the scene will be able to display objects
or not ?
