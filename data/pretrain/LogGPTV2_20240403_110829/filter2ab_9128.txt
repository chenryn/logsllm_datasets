### Title: Unmasking Vulnerabilities in File Descriptors: A Comprehensive Analysis

**Abstract:**

The Unix philosophy, "Everything is a file," underscores a fundamental aspect of the operating system. File descriptors (FDs) are extensively used in the Linux kernel, and the operations of exporting FDs to user space and importing them back into the kernel are both common and essential. However, our research has uncovered that these operations can be highly vulnerable, leading to significant security risks.

In this presentation, we will reveal several new types of vulnerabilities associated with the import and export of FDs in the Linux kernel. These vulnerabilities, which include previously unknown types as well as persistent issues like type confusion, have been found to be widespread and affect millions of devices, including those running Linux and Android kernels.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Vulnerabilities in FD Import Operations:**
   - We discovered multiple high-risk vulnerabilities in the usage of FD import operations.
   - New types of vulnerabilities, along with known ones like type confusion, were identified.
   - These vulnerabilities are particularly prevalent in GPU drivers, such as ARM Mali and AMD GPU drivers.

2. **Vulnerabilities in FD Export Operations:**
   - We identified a dozen vulnerabilities in the usage of FD export operations.
   - These vulnerabilities affect the Linux and Android kernels, impacting a large number of devices.

3. **Characteristics of the Vulnerabilities:**
   - GPU drivers, especially those using the `dma-buf` interfaces, are more susceptible to these vulnerabilities.
   - Some of these vulnerabilities are difficult to detect using traditional fuzzers like syzkaller due to their unique characteristics.

**Methodology:**

To address the challenges in identifying these vulnerabilities, we developed innovative methods to guide fuzzers. These methods have proven effective in uncovering vulnerabilities in the scenarios described above. Additionally, we will provide coding tips and best practices to help developers prevent such vulnerabilities related to file descriptors.

**Conclusion:**

This presentation will provide a comprehensive overview of the vulnerabilities in the usage of FD operations, detailing our findings and offering practical solutions. By understanding and addressing these vulnerabilities, we can significantly enhance the security of the Linux and Android kernels, protecting millions of devices from potential threats.
