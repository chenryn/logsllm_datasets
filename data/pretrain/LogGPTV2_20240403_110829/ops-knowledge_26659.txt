User: So I have a live Python application on App Engine that has far too many automatic indexes. I noticed a high amount of datastore writes for my low entity count and I believe this is the cause. Each entity has many StringProperties and some even have StringListProperties.
I added the indexed = False to all my object's properties (I don't every use a query where this would matter):
someproperty = db.StringProperty(indexed = False)
Is there anything else I need to do for new entities to be unindexed? Do I need to increment the app's version id?
Do I need to run appcfg.py vacuum_indexes . ?
Assistant: To get rid of the existing automatic indices you will have to retrieve every single entity and re-put it with the indexed = False properties.
If you don't do this, then the automatic indices will stick around.  However, the new entities you create will not be added to those indices.
