I've been using Druid to ingest data from Kafka. The messages in Kafka are
thrift-serialized versions of custom records. In order to parse these
serialized messages, I've written a custom Druid extension, which extends the
ByteBufferInputRowParser class in Druid.
This has been working fine. However, one issue I've encountered is that the
parse(T input) method of ByteBufferInputRowParser lets me convert one input to
only on Druid row. I
**Question:**  
Is there a way for me to map a given input into multiple InputRow objects?
Each of my Kafka messages has a list of items and I need to store each item as
a separate Druid row.
