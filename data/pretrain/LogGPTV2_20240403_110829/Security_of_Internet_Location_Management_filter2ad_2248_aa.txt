## Abstract

In the Mobile IPv6 protocol, a mobile node sends binding updates to its correspondents to inform them of its current location. It is well-established that the origin of this location information must be authenticated. This paper discusses several threats associated with location management that go beyond unauthentic location data. Specifically, an attacker can redirect data to flood third parties and induce unnecessary authentication. We introduce and analyze protection mechanisms, focusing on those that work for all Internet nodes and do not require a PKI or other new security infrastructure. Our threat analysis and assessment of defense mechanisms formed the basis for designing a secure location management protocol for Mobile IPv6. Many of the same threats should be considered when designing any location management mechanism for open networks.

## 1. Introduction

This paper examines attacks against the mobile and stationary location management features of the Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) protocol and other Internet mobility protocols. We analyze the threats posed by location management and the advantages and limitations of various security mechanisms. False location information can corrupt directories and routing tables, leading to misrouting of confidential information, hijacking of connections, and denial of service (DoS) because honest nodes cannot communicate. Cryptographic authentication of location information is typically seen as a key defense mechanism. For example, authentication of updates to location information is mandatory in Mobile IPv4 [PJ01], Mobile IPv6 [JPA02], and Dynamic DNS [VTRB97]. This paper reports the lessons we learned when designing such an authentication protocol for MIPv6.

We first overview known attacks that use unauthentic location data (Section 2) and discuss authentication mechanisms (Section 3). We are particularly interested in mechanisms that allow authentication between arbitrary Internet nodes without prior trust relationships, public-key infrastructure (PKI), or trusted third parties. We then present new types of attacks that go beyond unauthentic messages. Specifically, we explain how even strongly authenticated location management can be exploited in DoS attacks. First, data flows can be redirected to flood third parties who are not participating in the mobility protocol (Section 4). Second, the attacker may exploit features of a location management protocol to exhaust the resources of either the mobile or the correspondent, for example, by inducing unnecessary authentication (Sections 5 and 6). Finally, we make some notes about prioritizing security goals and combining multiple levels of authentication (Section 7).

It is essential to understand that some of the threats may be acceptable or too expensive to prevent completely. Different security mechanisms provide variable levels of guarantees for variable security properties at variable costs. The challenge is to find an acceptable level of protection at an acceptable price. Our goal is not to create a general infrastructure for strong authentication but to ensure that the introduction of a new technology, mobility, does not expose the current Internet to uncontrolled threats. Therefore, we can resort to some relatively weak and inexpensive security mechanisms that nevertheless solve the problems at hand.

The ideas presented in this paper formed the basis for the design of the secure location management protocol in the current Mobile IPv6 specification [JPA02]. We believe that the same threats and defenses should be considered in the development of any location management protocol for open networks.

### 1.1. The Mobile IPv6 Protocol

This section provides a brief overview of mobility and the Mobile IPv6 architecture. We avoid using protocol-specific terms whenever possible.

IP mobility means that an Internet node moves from one location (i.e., IP address) to another, either because it physically moves between network coverage areas or media types, or because its logical point of network access changes. The main goals of mobility protocols are to maintain existing connections over location changes and to ensure that the mobile node can be reached at its new location. By location management, we mean any mechanism for informing other nodes about the mobile's current address. Typically, location management either utilizes a directory service where the mobile's location is maintained or involves direct notifications to the nodes that need to know about the new location.

In Mobile IPv6, every mobile node (MN) has a home network and is identified by a home IP address on that network. The 128-bit IPv6 address consists of a 64-bit routing prefix, used for routing packets to the right network, and a 64-bit interface identifier, which identifies the specific node on the network and can essentially be a random number. Thus, IP addresses in MIPv6 can identify either a node or a location on the network, or both.

A router called the home agent at the home network acts as the mobile's trusted agent and forwards IP packets between the mobile's correspondent nodes (CN) and its current location, called the care-of address (Figure 1(a)). The MIPv6 protocol also includes a location management mechanism called binding update (BU). When the mobile changes its current address, it can send BUs to its correspondents and home agent to notify them of the new location so that they can communicate directly (Figure 1(b)). The mobile may also be triggered to send a BU when it receives a packet from a new correspondent via the home agent.

The mobile node and its home agent have a permanent trust relationship and a preconfigured security association for encrypted and authenticated communication. The mobile informs the home agent about its location via this secure tunnel. We assume these messages arrive safely and have nothing further to say about them. The mobile and its home agent can cooperate to send BUs to the correspondents, with whom they often have no pre-existing relationship. The correspondent stores the location information in a binding cache entry, which needs to be refreshed regularly by sending a new BU. The topic of this paper is the security of these BUs, which are sent to arbitrary correspondents.

It should be noted that there are several alternative approaches to Internet mobility, and the attacks and protection mechanisms identified in this paper are general enough to be applicable to many such mechanisms. It is beyond the scope of this work to compare the relative merits of the alternative mobility protocols.

Another issue we do not address is location privacy. MIPv6 does nothing special to try to hide the mobile's home address or current location from others. Nevertheless, the protocol is relatively privacy-friendly: the mobile's current location is tracked by its own home agent but not by any global or public directory, the mobile is free to use temporary and multiple home addresses, and sending BUs to correspondents is a voluntary optimization for the mobile.

## 2. Unauthentic Location Information

This section provides a brief overview of the threats that result from not authenticating location information. Readers familiar with the topic may want to skip to Section 3.

Unauthenticated location information makes it possible for an attacker to misinform correspondents about the mobile's location and, thus, to redirect packets intended for the mobile to a wrong destination. This can lead to the compromise of secrecy and integrity as well as denial-of-service (DoS) because target nodes are unable to communicate.

When sending false BUs, the attacker can use its own address as the false care-of address and pretend to be the mobile. This way, it can hijack existing connections between the mobile and its correspondents or open new ones. The attacker can also redirect the packets to a random or non-existent care-of address to disrupt communication with the mobile. It has to send a new binding update every few minutes to refresh the binding cache entry at the correspondent.

These attacks are alarming because the attacker can be anywhere on the network, and all Internet nodes are potential targets. All IPv6 nodes must support the correspondent functionality, and the addresses of mobile nodes are indistinguishable from those of stationary ones. Thus, the attacker can make any node believe that any other node, even a non-mobile one, is mobile and has moved to the false care-of address. This is, to some extent, a side effect of the effort to make mobility transparent.

To send false BUs, the attacker needs to know the IP addresses of both communicating nodes. This means that nodes with well-known and permanent addresses, such as public servers and those using stateless auto-configuration [TN98], are most vulnerable. They include nodes that are part of the network infrastructure, such as DNS servers, which are particularly interesting targets for DoS attacks. Frequently changing random addresses, e.g., ones created by IPv6 addressing privacy features [ND01], may mitigate the risks to some extent.

End-to-end encryption and integrity protection of payload data, e.g., with authenticated SSL or IPSec, can prevent attacks against data secrecy and integrity but not denial-of-service. Two stationary nodes that know each other to be stationary could be configured to refuse BUs from each other.

We have considered only active attackers because, to redirect packets, the attacker must eventually send one or more messages. In fact, active attacks are easier for the average attacker than passive ones would be. In most active attacks, the attacker can initiate the BU protocol execution at any time, while passive attacks would require the attacker to wait for suitable messages to be sent by the target nodes.

## 3. Authentication of Location Data

This section discusses proposed authentication methods for location information. The first two techniques (Sections 3.1-3.2) are relatively strong and involve public-key algorithms. Section 3.3 presents a relatively weak routing-based authentication method that would be labeled as insecure in traditional network security thinking. Nevertheless, it provides a well-defined level of assurance in real networks and can complement or even replace the stronger methods. Instead of trying to prevent all attacks, the best strategy is often to limit the number of potential attackers that can attack a particular target and to reduce the number of targets a potential attacker can threaten.

Any authentication protocol must take into account replay attacks. A nonce-based freshness mechanism seems practical because the authentication and DoS protection mechanisms described in Sections 3.3 and 4.2 use nonces anyway. Time stamps would be problematic because mobile nodes may not be able to maintain sufficiently accurate clocks. Sequence-numbered BUs, on the other hand, could be intercepted and delayed for later attacks.

### 3.1. Public Key Authentication

An obvious solution to the authentication of location information would be to use a suite of strong generic authentication mechanisms and a trust infrastructure, such as IPSec, IKE, and an X.509-based PKI. However, there are reasons why the generic protocol suites may not be suitable for this purpose. First, the generic authentication protocols are usually designed with general-purpose security requirements in mind, and their overhead can be too high for low-end mobile devices and for a network-layer signaling protocol. Second, an Internet-wide PKI would be difficult to deploy and manage, especially for mobile nodes that frequently change locations and may not have a fixed identity.
