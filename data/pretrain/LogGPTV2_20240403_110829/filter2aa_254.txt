### Wendel G. Henrique – Security Consultant, Trustwave SpiderLabs
- **Role:** Security consultant (Penetration Test Team) at Trustwave’s SpiderLabs.
- **Experience:** Over 9 years in the security industry.
- **Achievements:** Co-authored patent-pending penetration testing technology.
- **Speaking Engagements:** Spoken at several high-profile security conferences, including Black Hat Arsenal 2010 (USA), OWASP AppSec Research 2010 (Sweden), Black Hat Europe 2010 (Spain), Troopers 09 (Germany), OWASP AppSecEU09 (Poland), YSTS 3.0 (Brazil), DEFCON 16 (USA), and H2HC (Brazil).
- **Vulnerability Discoveries:** Identified vulnerabilities in a wide range of technologies, including webmail systems, wireless access points, remote access systems, web application firewalls, IP cameras, and IP telephony applications.

### First Things First
- **Setup:** A server connected to two WiFi networks.
- **Challenge:** Log into the server as root at least every 5 minutes during the talk. The first person to provide the root password before the end of the talk wins a T-shirt.
- **Methods:** There are two known methods to achieve this, but participants are encouraged to find a third, innovative method.
- **Purpose:** The significance of this challenge will be explained later in the presentation.

### What is This All About?
- **Objective:** To showcase real, interesting, and uncommon attacks that automated tools cannot detect.
- **Context:** Out of over 2300 penetration tests conducted by SpiderLabs last year, only the most unique and intriguing were selected for this presentation.
- **Goal:** By the end of the presentation, attendees should be more aware of the potential vulnerabilities in everyday systems and applications.

### Collection of Weirdest, Freakiest, and Most Unlikely Hacks We've Found

#### Do You Want Fries with That Hack?
- **Target:** A large restaurant network with online ordering.
- **Technology:** Web application developed in Java and Flash.
- **Security:** No severe common issues like SQL Injection or Remote Code Execution.
- **Exploit:** Manipulating prices and parameters was ineffective. However, the transaction process involved a third-party server, which lacked proper validation mechanisms. This allowed an attacker to purchase items at a fraction of their actual cost.

#### One PBX Will Rule Them All Hack
- **Target:** Siemens ROLM PBX.
- **Exploit:** Cloned the voice mail for corporate tech support and used it to trick a user into revealing their credentials, allowing unauthorized access.

#### The Inside-Out VPN Hack
- **Target:** Internal network with limited accessible services.
- **Exploit:** ARP Poisoning and HTTPS Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack to intercept and clone session cookies, gaining access to internal applications and file servers.

#### The Island Nation and Port 0 Hack
- **Target:** Credit card processing for an entire country.
- **Exploit:** Exploited a firewall vulnerability that allowed traffic sourced from port 0 to pass through, leading to a compromise of the entire credit card processing system.

#### The Caucasian-Asian Love Hack
- **Target:** External penetration test with limited services.
- **Exploit:** Used social engineering and information gathered from the developer's dating profile to crack the administrative web interface password.

#### In Soviet Russia Hackers Monitor You Hack
- **Target:** Multi-national company with multiple IP HD cameras.
- **Exploit:** Bypassed the authentication system to gain access to the cameras and the internal network.

#### Oracle and The New Tool Hack
- **Target:** Internal penetration test with only Oracle databases accessible.
- **Exploit:** Used thicknet to hijack an existing Oracle session and take control of the database.

### Meet the Victims - These Have Serious Implications
- **Types of Organizations:** Multi-national banks, global restaurant franchises, credit card processors, and major retail chains.
- **Data Compromised:** Financial transactions, credit card data, HR data, and sensitive government lists.

### DEMO: Who Won a T-Shirt?
- **Reveal:** Announce the winner of the T-shirt challenge and explain the winning method.

### Conclusion
- **Summary:** The presentation highlighted complex and uncommon hacks found in real-world environments, emphasizing the importance of considering unusual attack vectors.
- **Impact:** These attacks had significant implications, affecting high-end and important systems.
- **Closing Remarks:** Thank the audience and invite them to contact the speakers for further discussion.
