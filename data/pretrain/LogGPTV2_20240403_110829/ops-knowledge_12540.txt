Question: "A peripheral device attempts unauthorized memory access on a Mac computer. What is the expected behavior of the system in response to this action for a Mac with Apple silicon and an Intel-based Mac, respectively?"
 "A": "The system with Apple silicon triggers a kernel panic due to IOMMU detecting the unauthorized attempt."
 "B": "The Intel-based Mac system allows the DMA request after software initializes the IOMMUs."
 "C": "The Intel-based Mac system blocks the DMA request by default due to IOMMU's default-deny policy."
 "D": "The system with Apple silicon allows the peripheral to access memory exclusively mapped for its use."
