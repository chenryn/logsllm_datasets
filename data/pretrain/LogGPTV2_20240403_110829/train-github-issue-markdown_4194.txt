 **Isssue**  
`tel` and `callto` links not opened in app despite having been registered with
`setAsDefaultProtocolClient`
_It is very similar (identical?) tothis issue. It is 6 months old and has
received 7 thumbs up but no further attention, hence this new attempt._
Specifics:
  * Output of `node_modules/.bin/electron --version`:  
_v.3.0.10_
  * Operating System (Platform and Version):  
_**Windows 10**  
Version 1709  
OS Build 16299.125_
  * Output of `node_modules/.bin/electron --version` on last known working Electron version (if applicable):  
_Not applicable_
**Expected Behavior**  
`app.setAsDefaultProtocolClient('tel')` and
`app.setAsDefaultProtocolClient('callto')` should make your application become
available in the list of apps appearing when opening a `tel:` or `callto:`
link.
**Actual behavior**  
Application is not included in the list of apps appearing when clicking a tel
or callto link.
**To Reproduce**
  1. Download the latest Electron demo (v2.0.1)
  2. In function `createWindow` found in `main.js`, add these two lines:
    const defaultProtocolSet = app.setAsDefaultProtocolClient('tel'); //can also be set to 'callto' instead of 'tel'
    console.log('defaultProtocolSet? ', defaultProtocolSet);
  3. Open Windows's Command Prompt and run `npm install && run dev`  
You should now see _'defaultProtocolSet? true'_ in the Command Prompt window
  4. Open a browser and in the address field enter `tel://0123456789`(replace number with number of your choice) and press return. Alternatively you can click on any `tel` link you have available.
Result:  
A menu with a list of applications will be opened, but your app will not be
represented here.
**Additional Information**  
There does not seem to be a problem registering and opening custom protocol
links, such as `'myOwnTestProtocol'`
Thanks for your time and consideration!
