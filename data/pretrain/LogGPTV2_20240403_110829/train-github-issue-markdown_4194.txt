**Issue**

`tel` and `callto` links are not being opened in the application, despite having been registered with `setAsDefaultProtocolClient`.

This issue is very similar (if not identical) to a previously reported one that is now six months old. That issue has received 7 upvotes but no further attention, which is why I am creating this new report.

### Specifics:
- **Output of `node_modules/.bin/electron --version`:**  
  v3.0.10
- **Operating System (Platform and Version):**  
  **Windows 10**  
  Version 1709  
  OS Build 16299.125
- **Output of `node_modules/.bin/electron --version` on last known working Electron version (if applicable):**  
  Not applicable

### Expected Behavior
The calls to `app.setAsDefaultProtocolClient('tel')` and `app.setAsDefaultProtocolClient('callto')` should register the application as a handler for `tel:` and `callto:` links. This would make the application appear in the list of available apps when such a link is clicked.

### Actual Behavior
The application does not appear in the list of available apps when a `tel:` or `callto:` link is clicked.

### To Reproduce
1. Download the latest Electron demo (v2.0.1).
2. In the `createWindow` function found in `main.js`, add the following lines:
   ```javascript
   const defaultProtocolSet = app.setAsDefaultProtocolClient('tel'); // Can also be set to 'callto' instead of 'tel'
   console.log('defaultProtocolSet? ', defaultProtocolSet);
   ```
3. Open the Windows Command Prompt and run `npm install && npm run dev`.
   - You should see `defaultProtocolSet? true` in the Command Prompt window.
4. Open a web browser and enter `tel://0123456789` (replace the number with a valid phone number) in the address bar, then press Enter. Alternatively, you can click on any `tel:` link you have available.
   
   **Result:**
   - A menu with a list of applications will open, but your app will not be listed.

### Additional Information
There does not seem to be an issue with registering and opening custom protocol links, such as `'myOwnTestProtocol'`.

Thank you for your time and consideration!
