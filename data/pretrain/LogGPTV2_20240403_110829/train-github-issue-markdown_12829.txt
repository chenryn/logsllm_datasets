Using {% raw %} in templates does not stop jinja2 variable substitution
  * ansible 1.4 -devel `4f13967`
[playbook.yml]
    ---
    - name: "test raw template output"
      hosts: localhost
      vars:
        myvar: "foo"
      tasks:
        - local_action: template src="mytemplate.j2" dest="/tmp/myoutput.txt"
[mytemplate.j2]
    Test: Preserve curly braces, and NOT perform variable substitution:
    First Attempt:
    {% raw %}
      - { include: "{{ myvar }}" }
    {% endraw %}
[/tmp/myoutput.txt]
    Test: Preserve curly braces, and NOT perform variable substitution:
    First Attempt:
      - { include: "foo" }
NOTE: template output performs variable substitution even inside the {% raw %}
block.
