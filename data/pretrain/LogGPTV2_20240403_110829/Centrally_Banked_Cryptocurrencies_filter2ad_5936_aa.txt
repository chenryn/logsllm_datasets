## Abstract
Current cryptocurrencies, starting with Bitcoin, rely on a decentralized blockchain-based transaction ledger, maintained through proof-of-work (PoW) mechanisms that also generate the monetary supply. While decentralization offers benefits such as independence from national political control, it also presents significant limitations in terms of computational costs and scalability. We introduce RSCoin, a cryptocurrency framework where central banks maintain complete control over the monetary supply but rely on a distributed set of authorities, or "mintettes," to prevent double-spending. Although monetary policy is centralized, RSCoin still provides strong transparency and auditability guarantees. We demonstrate, both theoretically and experimentally, the benefits of a modest degree of centralization, including the elimination of wasteful hashing and a scalable system for avoiding double-spending attacks.

## 1. Introduction
Bitcoin, introduced in 2009, and the many alternative cryptocurrencies it has inspired (e.g., Litecoin and Ripple), have achieved remarkable success. Financially, by November 2015, Bitcoin held a market capitalization of $4.8 billion, and 30 other cryptocurrencies had a market capitalization exceeding $1 million. In terms of visibility, cryptocurrencies are increasingly accepted as a form of payment by international merchants, with 150,000 merchants using either Coinbase or Bitpay as payment gateway providers.

Major financial institutions, such as JPMorgan Chase and Nasdaq, have announced plans to develop blockchain technologies. Government institutions, including the European Central Bank, the US Federal Reserve, and the UK Treasury, have acknowledged the potential impacts of cryptocurrencies on monetary policy, payment systems, and innovation. Despite their success, existing cryptocurrencies suffer from several limitations, particularly poor scalability. The Bitcoin network, currently the most heavily used, can handle at most 7 transactions per second (TPS), whereas PayPal handles over 100 TPS and Visa handles an average of 2,000 to 7,000 TPS. This lack of scalability is due to the reliance on broadcast and the need for significant computational energy in PoW, which manages the transaction ledger and makes double-spending attacks prohibitively expensive. Alternative cryptocurrencies, such as Litecoin and Permacoin, attempt to address these issues but do not eliminate the underlying costs. Additionally, the loss of control over the monetary supply in current cryptocurrencies provides little flexibility for macroeconomic policy and results in extreme volatility.

Against this backdrop, we present RSCoin, a cryptocurrency framework that decouples the generation of the monetary supply from the maintenance of the transaction ledger. Our design decisions aim to create a more scalable cryptocurrency, inspired by the research agenda of the Bank of England, which raises the question of whether central banks should use such technology to issue digital currencies. RSCoin centralizes the monetary supply, with every unit of currency created by a central bank, making it more acceptable to governments. Despite this centralization, RSCoin retains the benefits of a transparent transaction ledger, a distributed system for maintaining it, and a globally visible monetary supply. This makes monetary policy transparent, allows direct access to payments and value transfers, supports pseudonymity, and benefits from innovative uses of blockchains and digital money.

RSCoin addresses some of the scalability issues of fully decentralized cryptocurrencies by delegating the authority of validating transactions to a number of known and accountable institutions called "mintettes." These mintettes support a simple and fast mechanism for double-spending detection. We adapt a variant of Two-Phase Commit, optimized to ensure the integrity of the transaction ledger. Our experimental testbed, consisting of 30 mintettes running a basic Python implementation, can process over 2,000 TPS, with performance scaling linearly as the number of mintettes increases. Most transactions take less than one second to clear, compared to many minutes in traditional cryptocurrency designs.

Recent issues in the Bitcoin network have highlighted that the incentives of miners may be misaligned. Research suggests that this problem is exacerbated in other cryptocurrencies. In RSCoin, mintettes can collect fees for good service, and such fees can be withheld from misbehaving or idle mintettes, leading to a more robust set of incentives. In a real deployment, mintettes are expected to be institutions with an existing relationship to the central bank, such as commercial banks, and thus have existing incentives to perform this service.

The ultimate goal for RSCoin is to provide a scalable cryptocurrency that can be deployed and controlled by a central bank, and to offer a framework that allows any central bank to deploy its own cryptocurrency. We discuss the requirements for interoperability between different RSCoin deployments, how different currencies can be exchanged in a transparent and auditable way, and how various considerations, such as security and geopolitical reasons, can be resolved without fragmenting the global monetary system.

## 2. Related Work
Much of the research on cryptocurrencies has focused on analyzing the extent to which existing properties (e.g., anonymity and fairness) are satisfied or proposing new methods to improve certain features. We focus on works related to stability and scalability. Studies have shown that even Bitcoin's heavyweight mechanisms do not provide perfect solutions. For example, Eyal and Sirer [9] and Garay et al. [10] demonstrated that an attacker can temporarily withhold blocks and undermine fairness. Babaioff et al. [1] argued that honest participation in the Bitcoin network is not sufficiently incentivized, and Johnson et al. [14] and Laszka et al. [18] showed that some participants might be incentivized to engage in denial-of-service attacks against each other. Karame et al. [15] and Rosenfeld [31] considered how an adversary might exploit both mining power and network topology to execute a double-spending attack. Gervais et al. [11] examined the structure of mining pools, the rise of SPV clients, and the privileged rights of Bitcoin developers, concluding that Bitcoin is far from achieving full decentralization. On the positive side, Kroll et al. [17] analyzed a simplified model of the Bitcoin network and concluded that Bitcoin is (at least weakly) stable.

In terms of other constructions, Laurie’s approach of designated authorities [19] is related to our work, but it does not describe a consensus mechanism or consider a centralized entity responsible for the generation of a monetary supply. RSCoin is also related to the approaches adopted by Ripple and Stellar, as all three use consensus protocols that sit between a fully decentralized setting (where PoW-based "Nakamoto consensus" [6] is widely adopted) and a fully centralized setting. Within this space, RSCoin makes different trust assumptions and thus ends up with different features. Both the Stellar and Ripple consensus protocols avoid a central point of trust but require a broadcast channel and constant direct communication between servers. In contrast, RSCoin, which aims to achieve scalability and centralization, avoids both broadcast channels and direct communication between mintettes.

Finally, our approach borrows ideas from industrial solutions. Specifically, our two-layered approach to the blockchain is inspired by the Bitcoin startup Factom, and our consensus mechanism is inspired by Certificate Transparency [20]. Like Certificate Transparency, RSCoin uses designated authorities and relies on transparency and auditability to ensure the integrity of the ledger, rather than full trust in a central party.

## 3. Background
In this section, we provide a brief background on Bitcoin and traditional cryptocurrencies, and introduce relevant notation. Since RSCoin adopts properties of other online payment systems, such as credit cards and cryptographic e-cash, we highlight some of the advantages and disadvantages of each approach in Table I.

### 3.1 The Bitcoin Protocol
Bitcoin, introduced in a whitepaper in 2008 [25] and deployed on January 3, 2009, is a decentralized cryptocurrency. It has achieved significant success and inspired numerous alternative cryptocurrencies (often called "altcoins") based on the same blockchain technology. The novelty of this technology lies in its ability to fulfill the two key requirements of a currency—monetary supply generation and transaction ledger establishment—in a completely decentralized manner. A global peer-to-peer network serves both to generate new units of currency and to bear witness to the transfer of existing units through transaction broadcast and computational PoW protocols.

To highlight the differences between RSCoin and fully decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, we outline the main operations and entities of these blockchain-based currencies. Users can generate signing keypairs and use the public key as a pseudonym or address to store units of the cryptocurrency. To transfer value, a user creates a transaction, which is cryptographically signed using the secret key associated with the sending address. Transactions can transfer value from multiple input addresses to multiple output addresses, requiring signatures from the secret keys associated with each input address. Once a transaction is created, it is broadcast to peers in the network and eventually reaches miners. Miners seal the transaction into the global ledger by including it in a pool of transactions, which they hash along with metadata and a nonce to produce a hash below a target value (defined by the network difficulty). When a miner successfully produces such a hash, they broadcast the pool of transactions and its associated hash as a block. Blocks include a reference to the previously mined block, allowing the acceptance of the miner’s block into the blockchain to be signaled by the broadcast of subsequent blocks. Miners are incentivized by collecting optional fees from individual transactions and a system-specific mining reward (e.g., 25 BTC as of November 2015). These rewards are collected in a special coin generation transaction included in the block. Crucially, blocks serve to generate the monetary supply and provide a partial ordering for transactions, allowing all users in the network to impose a global (partial) ordering on transactions and thwart double-spending by maintaining a list of unspent transaction outputs and validating a transaction only if its input addresses appear in this list.

### 3.2 Notation
We denote a hash function as \( H(\cdot) \) and a signature scheme as the tuple \((\text{Sig.KeyGen}, \text{Sig.Sign}, \text{Sig.Verify})\). These algorithms behave as follows: via \((pk, sk) \leftarrow \text{Sig.KeyGen}(1^\lambda)\) one generates a signing keypair; via \(\sigma \leftarrow \text{Sig.Sign}(sk, m)\) one generates a signature; and via \(0/1 \leftarrow \text{Sig.Verify}(pk, m, \sigma)\) one verifies a signature on a message.

We use \( \text{addr} \) to denote an address, which is identical to a public key \( pk \) in terms of the underlying technology, but we use the separate term to disambiguate between usage in a transaction (where we use \( \text{addr} \)) and usage as a signature verification key (where we use \( pk \)). We use \( \text{tx}(\{ \text{addri} \}_i \rightarrow \{ \text{addrj} \}_j) \) to denote a transaction in which \( n \) units of currency are sent from \( \{ \text{addri} \}_i \) to \( \{ \text{addrj} \}_j \). Each usage of an address \( \text{addr} \) can be uniquely identified by the tuple \( \text{addrid} = (\text{tx}, \text{indextx(addr)}, v) \), where \( \text{tx} \) is the hash of the transaction in which it received some value \( v \), and \( \text{indextx(addr)} \) is the index of \( \text{addr} \) in the list of inputs or outputs.
