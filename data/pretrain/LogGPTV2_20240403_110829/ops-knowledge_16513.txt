User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题logrotate pattern matching for daemon restart In a setup very much like: http://wiki.apache.org/httpd/ExtendingPrivilegeSeparation I have logs located in /var/weblog/&lt;domain&gt;/error_log

I would like to use logrotate to rotate these logs 50M, gzip the rest, and keep 5.

Instead of repeating the same section over and over again, I'm wondering if I can use something like:

/var/weblog/*/error_log {
    missingok
    rotate 5
    delaycompress
    compress
    size 50M
    sharedscripts
    postrotate
        /opt/bw/sbin/bw_apachectl.sh reload $1
    endscript
}


to match the domain and use it in the script.

Assistant: I think the logrotate.conf man page answers this question quite nicely.
