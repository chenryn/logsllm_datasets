**ATT&CK ID:** M1037  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Filter Network Traffic

To mitigate and filter malicious network traffic, leverage services provided by Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) or specialized providers that focus on DDoS mitigation. These services can filter traffic upstream from your infrastructure, reducing the load on your network. Implement boundary traffic filtering by:

- Blocking source IP addresses that are originating the attack.
- Blocking specific ports that are being targeted.
- Blocking the protocols used for transporting the malicious traffic.

This approach helps to effectively manage and reduce the impact of network-based attacks.
