User: How to configure and optimize system kernel parameters on a Linux system to improve system performance?
Assistant: Configuring and optimizing system kernel parameters on a Linux system can improve system performance. The following are some commonly used methods: 1. Modify /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled to madvise: This can reduce the overhead of memory allocation and release, and Reduce memory fragmentation. 2. Adjust the memory swappiness value: You can use the sysctl command to set it to reduce the frequent memory swap of the system and increase the system performance. 3. Turn off unnecessary services: To reduce the burden and overhead of the system, you can use the systemctl command or modify the scripts in the /etc/rc.d/ directory. 4. Adjust file system parameters: You can use the tune2fs command to configure the file system, including parameters such as inode size, block size, and delayed writing time. 5. Set network parameters: You can set network parameters by modifying the /etc/sysctl.conf configuration file, such as buffer size, TCP connection timeout, etc. 6. Kernel optimization: You can optimize the kernel by modifying the parameters in the /proc/sys/kernel/ directory, such as adjusting the number of system threads and delay time. 7. Use an efficient file system: such as ext4, xfs, etc., which can reduce disk fragmentation and improve file system performance. 8. Adjust CPU performance: You can use the cpufreq command to set the CPU operating frequency, reduce power consumption, and improve system efficiency. The above are some commonly used methods, but the specific configuration and optimization need to be adjusted and optimized according to the actual situation and needs.
