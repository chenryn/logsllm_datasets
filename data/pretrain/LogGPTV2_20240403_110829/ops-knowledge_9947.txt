User: I would like to install Fipy on Python3.3 (Windows 7 or Linux/ubuntu-mint), is possible? I need to use Fipy for improving my python3.3 coding. Do I have to translate that in python 2.7 ? 
Please does anyone know? any suggestion?
Assistant: No, FiPy does not support Python 3. You need to either use Python 2 or help update FiPy to support Python 3. Contact the authors about that.
