### Positive Rate and Detection Rate Analysis

In our experiments, we observed that the false positive rate increased from 7.9% to 48.28%, while the detection rate dropped to 78.776%. Next, we considered an end-to-end attack scenario where the attacker performs both bootstrapping and continuous sensing. In this scenario, our defense mechanism reduced the detection rate to 47.48% and increased the false positive rate to 49.5%. These results apply to both the original and advanced attackers. The ambiguity introduced by our defense renders the attack impractical.

| Metric | No Defense | AP Obfuscation |
|--------|------------|-----------------|
| False Positive Rate | 7.935% | 48.284% |
| Detection Rate | 99.988% | 78.776% |
| False Positive Rate (End-to-End) | 10.719% | 49.598% |
| Detection Rate (End-to-End) | 99.725% | 47.481% |

### Possible Countermeasures

To overcome our proposed injection method, the attacker must find ways to distinguish the obfuscation packets sent by the Access Point (AP) from the original packets sent by the anchor. As discussed earlier, using packet sequence numbers and arrival times is infeasible due to our packet randomization. Distinguishing the two streams at the network traffic level is also difficult because packet contents are encrypted, and we can shape traffic to resist identification by attackers [15]. Finally, separating the two streams using physical layer characteristics is challenging, as it requires sophisticated and bulky hardware. One option is to analyze per-symbol aCSI/RSS patterns, but this is infeasible with commodity WiFi chips, which only report per-packet aCSI/RSS values. Another option is to use a large antenna array (MIMO with at least 4-6 antenna elements, each separated by 6.25 cm) to distinguish signals sent by the anchor from those sent by the AP, as they come from different directions. However, such a sniffer (over 31 cm in length) would be conspicuous and easily raise suspicion.

### Related Work

#### Human Sensing by Snooping Signals

We categorize existing works into five groups:

1. **Traffic Analysis**: This group infers user presence and status in a home/office from their network traffic [35], [51], [77], [18], [49], [45], [12]. It requires strong knowledge of device behaviors and can be countered by sending cover traffic, applying encryption, and traffic shaping. In contrast, our attack remains effective even when all network-level defenses are deployed, as long as WiFi devices still transmit packets.

2. **Specialized Signals**: This group uses RFID [78], visible light [76], [37], and acoustic [40], [44] signals, which often correlate with human motion. However, these solutions require control of transmitters inside or outside the target property, which is infeasible under our attack model.

3. **Fingerprinting**: This group builds fingerprints of each predefined target location and/or activity based on aCSI [43], [66], [75], CSI [46], [65], RSS [26], [59], [53], [57], or raw signals [67]. Since the attacker under our model has no knowledge of the target users and no access to the target property, building fingerprints becomes infeasible.

4. **Advanced Radio Hardware**: This group uses advanced radio hardware (laptops or USRPs with antenna arrays or directional antennas) to communicate with the anchors inside the target property. This allows the sniffer to measure fine-grained CSI values (both amplitude and phase) [68] and use them to calculate AoA and Doppler frequency shift (DFS) to detect human motion [29], [47], [65], [72], [28], [19]. Our attack differs by using a passive sniffer with a single antenna, which does not communicate/synchronize with the anchors. In this case, the sniffer cannot infer CSI phase, AoA, or DFS.

5. **Passive Sniffers**: This group detects user motion using passive sniffers to collect and analyze physical RF signals [17], [19], [63]. Both [17] and [63] target user motion that disturbs the direct propagation path, requiring precise locations of the anchors. [19] uses multiple sniffers with bulky directional antennas to compute Doppler shift of user motion. The sensing method used by our attack falls into this category but targets multipath signal propagation from each anchor to the sniffer. We design a new aCSI variance model to reliably detect user motion, eliminating the need for precise anchor location and an antenna array at the sniffer.

#### Passive Transmitter Localization

Existing works often leverage receivers with multiple antennas [14], [33], [58], [30], [69], [34] to estimate signal AoA and apply triangulation across receivers to derive target location. Our anchor localization (during bootstrapping) uses a compact smartphone with a single antenna and applies passive localization that fits spatial RSS measurements to a propagation model [27], [38], [23]. Our key contribution is the data sifting algorithm that identifies good RSS samples as input to the model fitting.

#### Defense Against RF Sensing

Existing works [32], [48], [22], [64] defend against eavesdropping on a transmitter by a jammer transmitting simultaneously, preventing the attacker from decoding packets or estimating CSI/AoA. This requires precise synchronization between the transmitter and the jammer [31] or a high-cost full-duplex obfuscator [48]. Our defense uses the AP to insert fake packets (rather than transmitting simultaneously), which is easy to deploy and effective against our attack.

### Conclusion

Our work highlights that the ubiquity of WiFi devices comes with an unexpected cost: reflected or blocked RF transmissions leak information about our location and activities. We describe a set of low-cost, stealthy reconnaissance attacks that can continuously monitor and locate human motion inside a private property, turning WiFi devices inside into motion sensors. All this is done without compromising the WiFi network, data packets, or devices, and only requires a commodity WiFi sniffer outside the property. We validate the attack on various real-world locations and develop a new effective defense based on carefully tuned WiFi signal obfuscation by APs.

We believe our work points to the potential of more powerful information leakage attacks via passive RF reflections. With more sophisticated signal processing techniques (and potentially new hardware), much more might be learned from the way ambient RF signals interact with our bodies and surroundings. We are pursuing this line of research to better understand these attacks and to develop defenses to better safeguard our security and privacy.
