positive rate from 7.9% to 48.28% while dropping the detection
rate to 78.776%. Next, we consider the end-to-end attack
scenario where the attacker performs both bootstrapping and
continuous sensing. Our defense drops the detect rate down to
47.48% while increasing the false positive rate to 49.5%. These
results apply to both the original attacker and the advanced
attacker. Such ambiguity renders the attack useless in practice.

TABLE VII.
THE ATTACK PERFORMANCE UNDER AP-BASED SIGNAL
OBFUSCATION (BEST PERFORMANCE OUT OF THE ORIGINAL AND THE
ADVANCED ATTACK WITH AN EXTRA SNIFFER).
Possible countermeasures.
To overcome our proposed
injection method. Doing so at
defense, the attacker must ﬁnd ways to distinguish the ob-
fuscation packets sent by AP from the original packets sent
by an anchor w. As discussed earlier, doing so using packet
sequence number and arrival time is infeasible due to our
packet
the network trafﬁc
level is also difﬁcult, since packet contents are encrypted,
and we can shape trafﬁc to resist
trafﬁc identiﬁcation by
attackers [15]. Finally, it is also difﬁcult to separate the two
streams using physical layer characteristics, because doing so
requires much more sophisticated and bulky hardware. One
option is to analyze per-symbol aCSI/RSS patterns. This is
infeasible using commodity WiFi chips, as they only report
per-packet aCSI/RSS values. Another option is to use a large
antenna array (MIMO with at least 4–6 antenna elements, each
separated by 6.25cm) to distinguish signals sent by w from
those sent by the AP, since they come from different directions.
The resulting sniffer (>31cm in length) would be conspicuous
and easily raise suspicion.
IX. RELATED WORK
Human sensing by snooping signals. We categorize ex-
isting works into ﬁve groups. The ﬁrst group applies trafﬁc
analysis to infer user presence and status in a home/ofﬁce
from their network trafﬁc [35], [51], [77], [18], [49], [45], [12].
It requires strong knowledge on device behaviors and can be
easily countered by sending cover trafﬁc, applying encryptions
and trafﬁc shaping. In contrast, our attack remains effective
even when all network-level defenses are deployed, as long as
WiFi devices still transmit packets.
The second group uses “specialized signals” such as
RFID [78], visible light [76], [37], and acoustic [40], [44],
that often correlate with human motion. But existing solutions
require control of transmitters inside or outside of the target
property, which is infeasible under our attack model.
The third group builds ﬁngerprints of each predeﬁned target
location and/or activity, based on either aCSI [43], [66], [75],
CSI [46], [65], RSS [26], [59], [53], [57], or raw signals [67].
Since the attacker under our model has no knowledge of
the target users and access to the target property, building
ﬁngerprints becomes infeasible.
The fourth group uses advanced radio hardware (laptops
or USRPs with antenna arrays or directional antennas) that
communicate with the anchors inside the target property.
This allows the sniffer to measure ﬁne-grained CSI values
(both amplitude and phase) [68], and use them to calculate
AoA and doppler frequency shift (DFS) to detect human
motion [29], [47], [65], [72], [28], [19]. Our attack differs
by using a passive sniffer with a single antenna, which does
not communicate/synchronize with the anchors. In this case,
the sniffer cannot infer CSI phase, AoA or DFS.
The ﬁnal group detects user motion using passive sniffers
to collect and analyze physical RF signals [17], [19], [63]. As
discussed earlier, both [17], [63] target user motion that dis-
turbs the direct propagation path, requiring precise locations of
the anchors. [19] uses multiple sniffers with bulky directional
antennas to compute doppler shift of user motion. The sensing
method used by our attack falls into this category, but targets
multipath signal propagation from each anchor to the sniffer.
We design a new aCSI variance model to reliably detect user
13
motion, eliminating the need for precise anchor location and
antenna array at the sniffer.
Passive transmitter localization.
Existing works often
leverage bulky receivers with multiple antennas [14], [33],
[58], [30], [69], [34] to estimate signal AoA, and applies trian-
gulation across receivers to derive target location. Our anchor
localization (during bootstrapping) uses a compact smartphone
with a single antenna, and applies passive localization that ﬁts
spatial RSS measurements to a propagation model [27], [38],
[23]. Our key contribution is the data sifting algorithm that
identiﬁes good RSS samples as input to the model ﬁtting.
Defense against RF sensing. Existing works [32], [48], [22],
[64] defend against eavesdropping on a transmitter by a jam-
mer transmitting simultaneously, preventing the attacker from
decoding packets or estimating CSI/AoA. This requires precise
synchronization between the transmitter and the jammer [31]
or a high-cost full-duplex obfuscator [48]. Our defense uses AP
to insert fake packets (rather than transmitting simultaneously),
which is easy to deploy and effective against our attack.
X. CONCLUSION
Our work shows that the ubiquity of WiFi devices has an
unexpected cost: reﬂected or blocked RF transmissions leak
information about our location and activities. We describe
a set of low-cost, stealthy reconnaissance attacks that can
continuously monitor and locate human motion inside a private
property, turning WiFi devices inside into motion sensors. All
this is done without compromising the WiFi network, data
packets or devices, and only requires a commodity WiFi sniffer
outside of the property. We validate the attack on a variety of
real-world locations, and develop a new effective defense based
on carefully tuned WiFi signal obfuscation by APs.
We believe our work points to the potential of more pow-
erful information leakage attacks via passive RF reﬂections.
With more sophisticated signal processing techniques (and
potentially new hardware), much more might be learned from
the way ambient RF signals interact with our bodies and
surroundings. We are pursuing this line of research to both
better understand these attacks and to develop defenses to
better safeguard our security and privacy.
