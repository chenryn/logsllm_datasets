User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题iptables nat question I nat all tcp to a socks proxy doing something like..

sudo iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m owner --uid-owner USER -m tcp -j REDIRECT --to-ports XXX

Therefore all packets go there, it works. 

I know that local socks proxy connect to a IP and I want to allow my computer to access only that IP. The way I try to do it is..  

sudo iptables -P OUTPUT DROP


then I add an exception

sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -o lo -d 127.0.0.1 -j ACCEPT (loopback)
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -d xxx.yyy.xxx.zzz -j ACCEPT


I have used wireshark to see if my computer connects to another IP but it only connects to that IP but somehow when I say to iptables DROP everything except that one with ALL protocols allowed and ALL ports, it is not working. I really cant understand it.

Assistant: Use "-v, --verbose", you see iptables counter. This is a good tool for debugging.
Use LOG target to debug iptables rules.
