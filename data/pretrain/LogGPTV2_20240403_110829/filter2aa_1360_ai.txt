### Blocking of Specific Scripts Globally Throughout the Organization with a Custom Version of uBlock Origin

#### Linux Installation Steps
1. **Install Curl:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y curl
   ```
   This command installs `curl` on your Linux system, which is used for downloading files from the internet.

2. **Switch to the Desktop Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd ~/Desktop
   ```
   This command changes the current directory to the Desktop path.

3. **Download the File:**
   ```bash
   curl -u osint9:bookl43wt -O https://inteltechniques.com/osintbook9/ff-template.zip
   ```
   This command downloads the `ff-template.zip` file using the provided credentials.

4. **Extract the File:**
   ```bash
   unzip ff-template.zip -d ~/.mozilla/firefox/
   ```
   This command extracts the contents of the `ff-template.zip` file into the `~/.mozilla/firefox/` directory.

5. **Switch to the Firefox Profile Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd ~/.mozilla/firefox/ff-template/
   ```
   This command changes the current directory to the newly extracted Firefox profile directory.

6. **Copy the Data:**
   ```bash
   cp -R * ~/.mozilla/firefox/*.default-release
   ```
   This command copies the contents of the `ff-template` directory to the default Firefox profile directory.

#### Windows & Mac Instructions
While terminal commands are possible and will be used in the OSINT machine chapter, it is often easier to copy the profile based on the official tutorial. You can also replicate these steps in Linux if you encounter any difficulties. Follow these steps:

1. **Chrome (google.com/chrome)**
   - **Privacy Settings:**
     - Beside the content settings button, there is a "Clear browsing data" button. This opens a dialogue that allows you to clear any or all data stored during your sessions. You can erase information for a period ranging from the last hour to "the beginning of time". It is recommended to use this function to clear all browsing data daily.
   - **Passwords and Forms:**
     - Disable the features by unchecking the boxes "Enable Autofill to fill out web forms in a single click" and "Offer to save your web passwords". If you have stored form-fill information or passwords in Chrome, remove any data before conducting investigations.

2. **Firefox Profile Setup:**
   - Open Firefox and click the menu button (three horizontal lines), then click "Help" and select "Troubleshooting Information".
   - Under the "Application Basics" section, click on "Open (or Show) Folder (or Directory)". A window with your profile files will open.
   - Close Firefox but leave the profile folder window open.
   - Paste the content of the new folder from your removable drive into this folder. Overwrite any files when prompted.
   - Restart Firefox. You should now see all the extensions installed and configured within the menu. All privacy and security settings should be applied, and you are ready to begin your usage.

#### Browser Security and Privacy
- **Chrome:**
  - Chrome is known for being fast and responsive, and it is secure by nature. However, it compromises privacy as Google receives a lot of data about your internet usage.
  - Both Firefox and Chrome "sandbox" each tab, restricting the content in that tab to that tab only, preventing it from affecting other tabs or the computer's hardware.
  - For investigative purposes, I recommend using uBlock Origin on any browser, including Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Opera.
  - If you are concerned about privacy, consider switching to the Brave browser, which is based on Chrome but eliminates most of the intrusive behavior.

- **Chrome Extensions:**
  - To install add-ons in Chrome, navigate to the settings menu and click "Extensions" on the upper left side of the Chrome interface.
  - Uninstall any add-ons that you did not personally install or research for trustworthiness.
  - Most extensions previously explained for Firefox can be installed in the same manner in Chrome.

#### Tor Browser (torproject.org)
- **Installation:**
  - For Windows and Mac, the Tor bundle is available for free from the site and requires minimal default installation.
  - Upon launching, Tor will create a connection to a Tor server, routing all your internet traffic through that server.
  - After the connection is successful, it will load a custom version of the Firefox browser, providing a layer of privacy to stay hidden from a suspect.

- **Usage:**
  - Tor may be overkill for most investigations. If you are only searching and monitoring common services like Facebook, Twitter, or YouTube, this service is not needed.
  - If you are visiting personal websites and blogs of a tech-savvy hacker, consider using Tor.
  - When using Tor, you may notice a decrease in internet speed, which is normal and often improves over time.

#### Bookmarklets
- **JavaScript Bookmarklets:**
  - Bookmarklets are short lines of JavaScript code stored as bookmarks within any browser. They execute commands within the website you are currently viewing without navigating away from the page.
  - Examples include:
    - **FacebookID:** Displays the Facebook User ID.
    - **FacebookGroupID:** Displays the Facebook Group ID.
    - **FacebookExpand:** Attempts to expand all comments on a profile.
    - **ModifiedDate:** Displays the date and time of modification to a static web page.
    - **Cache-Google:** Opens a Google Cache version of the current website.
    - **Paywall:** Opens a blocked news article within a new tab through Outline.com.

#### Linux Applications
- **VLC Media Player:**
  - Install VLC using the following command:
    ```bash
    sudo snap install vlc
    ```
  - This command tells Ubuntu to install VLC. You may need to confirm the installation by entering "y" for "yes".

- **FFmpeg:**
  - Update and install FFmpeg using the following commands:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y ffmpeg
    ```
  - These tools are useful for manipulating and downloading videos.

- **YouTube-DL:**
  - Install Python and YouTube-DL using the following commands:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install -y python3-pip
    sudo -H pip install youtube_dl
    ```
  - Download a video using the following command:
    ```bash
    youtube-dl https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLWEXRAnQdO
    ```

By following these steps, you can set up a secure and efficient environment for your investigative work.
