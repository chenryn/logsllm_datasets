# Environment
    Windows build number:18362
    Windows Terminal version (if applicable):
    Any other software?
# Steps to reproduce
I am attaching a simple program that write "\033[" and "0c" to stdout. When I
use the EchoCon sample to launch this under ConPTY, I only see "0c" in the
output. Breaking at the WriteFile at the bottom of the EchoCon sample, I see
the following things:
  1. An initial XTERM SetTitle OSC, which is unexpected but manageable.
  2. A sequence of "[escape code for cursor off]" "0c" "[escape code cursor on]" (notice \033[ is missing)
code attached:
    #include 
    #include 
    int main(int argc, char**argv) {
      char *csi = "\033[";
      char *da = "0c";
      DWORD bwrote =0;
    	/*
        HANDLE hConsole = { GetStdHandle(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE) };
     DWORD consoleMode = 0;
      GetConsoleMode(hConsole, &consoleMode);
       SetConsoleMode(hConsole, consoleMode | ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_PROCESSING);
       */
      WriteFile(GetStdHandle(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE),csi,2,&bwrote,NULL);
      WriteFile(GetStdHandle(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE),da,2,&bwrote,NULL);
    }
If I uncomment the call to SetConsoleMode in the child process, it shows a
bizzarre sequence of "\r\n" after the Xterm sequence.
# Expected behavior
Just my \033[0c
# Actual behavior
As described above. I am probably just overlooking something, but I'd love to
find an explanation for this.
