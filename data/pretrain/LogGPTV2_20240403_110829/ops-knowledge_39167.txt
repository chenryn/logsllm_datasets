User: If I run two different Python scripts simultaneously, I see a console window which shows output from each of the scripts alternately, switching back and forth every second or so. If I open a second console window before running the second script, the same thing happens - both console windows switch between the 2 scripts. 
How can I get each script to output to its own console window?
Assistant: a very belated response but it sounds like your issue is that you have the 'Show Console When Standard Out Changes' option selected.
Hope that helps, or that you found the solution on your own. Cheers!
