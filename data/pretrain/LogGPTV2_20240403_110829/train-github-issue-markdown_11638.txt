From working on #7819 (comment), here's a case where having both `bounds` and
`constraints` enabled leads to bizarre behavior that violates both. I don't
know where the actual problem is. Yellow dots are the local minima found
during each step. Blue is an (exclusion) constraint, and red is out of bounds:
**Neither:**

**Bounds only (red):**
![bounds yes constraints no](https://user-

**Constraints only (blue):**

**Bounds (red) and constraints (blue):**

It finds lots of incorrect minima, many of which violate the bounds or the
constraints or both.
I think these are using different minimizers, though. The "both" case seems to
be slsqp.
