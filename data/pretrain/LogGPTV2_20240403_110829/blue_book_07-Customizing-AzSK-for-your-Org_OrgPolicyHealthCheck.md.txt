> The Secure DevOps Kit for Azure (AzSK) was created by the Core Services Engineering & Operations (CSEO) division at Microsoft, to help accelerate Microsoft IT's adoption of Azure. We have shared AzSK and its documentation with the community to provide guidance for rapidly scanning, deploying and operationalizing cloud resources, across the different stages of DevOps, while maintaining controls on security and governance.
AzSK is not an official Microsoft product â€“ rather an attempt to share Microsoft CSEO's best practices with the community..

## Overview
#### When and why should I check org policy health 
AzSK keeps on adding and enhancing features with different capabilities to monitor Security compliance for Org subscriptions. During these enhancement in new releases, it may include latest features and also some breaking changes. To provide smoother upgrade and avoid policy break, AzSK provides feature for Org policy to run AzSK components with specific version using configuration(mentioned in AzSK.Pre.json). Currently, we have come up with health and fix script which will validate all mandatory resources and latest configurations are in place. 
It is recommendated to run health scan before and after updating AzSK version for Org.
