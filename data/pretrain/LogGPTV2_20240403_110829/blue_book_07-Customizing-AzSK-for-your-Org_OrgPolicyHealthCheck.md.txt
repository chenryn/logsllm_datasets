----------------------------------------------
### About AzSK
The Secure DevOps Kit for Azure (AzSK) was developed by the Core Services Engineering & Operations (CSEO) division at Microsoft to accelerate Microsoft IT's adoption of Azure. We have shared AzSK and its documentation with the community to provide guidance on rapidly scanning, deploying, and operationalizing cloud resources across various stages of DevOps, while maintaining robust security and governance controls. Please note that AzSK is not an official Microsoft product but rather a means to share best practices from Microsoft CSEO.

# AzSK Custom Org Policy Health Check

### [Overview](OrgPolicyHealthCheck.md#overview-1)
### [Run Org Policy Health Check](OrgPolicyHealthCheck.md#run-org-policy-health-check-1)

## Overview
#### When and Why Should I Check Org Policy Health?
AzSK continuously adds and enhances features to monitor security compliance for organizational subscriptions. New releases may introduce the latest features and potential breaking changes. To ensure a smooth upgrade and avoid policy breaks, AzSK provides a feature that allows you to run AzSK components with specific versions using configuration settings (mentioned in `AzSK.Pre.json`). 

We have developed a health and fix script that validates all mandatory resources and ensures the latest configurations are in place. It is recommended to run a health scan before and after updating the AzSK version for your organization.

## Run Org Policy Health Check
To validate the health of your organization's policy for mandatory configurations and policy schema syntax issues, use the following command. You can review the failed checks and follow the suggested remedies.

```PowerShell
Get-AzSKOrganizationPolicyStatus -SubscriptionId <subscription-id> `
           -OrgName "Contoso" `
           -DepartmentName "IT"
```

If you have used customized resource names, you can use the following parameter set to run the health check:

```PowerShell
Get-AzSKOrganizationPolicyStatus -SubscriptionId <subscription-id> `
           -OrgName "Contoso-IT" `
           -ResourceGroupName "RGName" `
           -StorageAccountName "PolicyStorageAccountName" 
```

Review the failed checks and follow the suggested remedies to fix any issues.
