User: I have 2 .pyo python files that I can convert to .py source files, but they don't compile perfectly as hinted by decompyle's verify.
Therefore looking at the source code, I can tell that config.pyo  simply had variables in in an array:
ADMIN_USERIDS = [116901,
 141,
 349244,
 39,
 1159488]
I would like to take the original .pyo and disassembly or whatever I need to do inorder to change one of these IDs.
Or....
in model.pyo the source indicates a 
if (productsDeveloperId != self.getUserId()):
All I would want to do is hex edit the != to be a == .....Simple with a windows exe program but I can't find a good python disassembler anywhere.
Any suggestions are welcomed...I am new to reading bytecode and new to python as well.
Assistant: Convert the .pyo files to .py and then edit the .py and then run python on the .py files. Python will regenerate the .pyo files Don't edit the pyo
I don't know the python bytecode but I would doubt that the strings == or 1= would appear in the .pyo file 
Although a much better way is get the original .py files and use them. If they give the wrong program as implied by wanting to change != to == then you could ask the supplier to fix the bug.
