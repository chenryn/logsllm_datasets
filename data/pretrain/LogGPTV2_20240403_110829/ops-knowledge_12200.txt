I have two `.pyo` Python files that I need to convert back to `.py` source files. However, the decompilation process using `decompyle` does not yield a perfect result, as indicated by its verification step.

Upon inspecting the decompiled source code, I found that `config.pyo` contains an array of user IDs:

```python
ADMIN_USERIDS = [116901, 141, 349244, 39, 1159488]
```

I would like to modify one of these IDs. Additionally, in `model.pyo`, there is a condition:

```python
if (productsDeveloperId != self.getUserId()):
```

I want to change the `!=` operator to `==`. This can be done easily with a hex editor for Windows executables, but I am having trouble finding a suitable Python disassembler.

**Questions:**
1. How can I disassemble or otherwise modify the original `.pyo` files to make these changes?
2. Are there any Python disassemblers you would recommend?

**Current Suggestions:**
- Convert the `.pyo` files to `.py`, make the necessary edits, and then run the Python interpreter on the modified `.py` files. The interpreter will regenerate the `.pyo` files.
- Do not directly edit the `.pyo` files.
- It is unlikely that the strings `==` or `!=` will appear verbatim in the `.pyo` bytecode.
- The best approach would be to obtain the original `.py` files. If the provided `.py` files contain errors (as implied by the need to change `!=` to `==`), it would be advisable to request the supplier to fix the bug.

I am new to both reading bytecode and working with Python, so any suggestions are greatly appreciated.
