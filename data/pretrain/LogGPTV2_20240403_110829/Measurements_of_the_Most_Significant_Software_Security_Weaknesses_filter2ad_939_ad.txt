# CWE-295 and Related Vulnerabilities

## Improper Certificate Validation
### CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation
This weakness involves failing to properly validate a certificate, which can lead to security vulnerabilities.

## Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource
### CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource
This vulnerability occurs when permissions are incorrectly assigned to critical resources, potentially allowing unauthorized access.

## Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference
### CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference
This weakness involves the improper handling of XML external entity (XXE) references, which can lead to information disclosure, denial of service, or remote code execution.

## Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')
### CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')
This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code, leading to the execution of malicious scripts or commands.

## The Two Most Dangerous CWEs: Injection vs. Memory Errors

The most distinctive groups of weaknesses in both the MDSE Top 25 list and the MSSW Top 20 lists are injection and memory errors. The use of the MSSW equation and the split into class and base lists significantly reorders these groups, introducing new CWEs and dropping some.

### Injection Weaknesses
Injection is the most dangerous type of weakness, represented by:
- **CWE-89 (SQL Injection)**
- **CWE-502 (Deserialization of Untrusted Data)**
- **CWE-78 (OS Command Injection)**
- **CWE-94 (Code Injection)**
- **CWE-611 (Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference)**

These CWEs rank 1, 2, 4, 6, and 17, respectively, in the base list. In the MDSE list, their rankings are 6, 16, and 11 due to lower frequencies. The MSSW inclusion of their high severity scores (8.89, 9.01, and 8.58) moved them up in the base list. Note that CWE-502 covers Object Injection.

The second-ranked CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting) in the MDSE list is not in the MSSW base list, despite having the highest frequency of 1571, due to its relatively low severity score of 5.83.

### Memory Weaknesses
The most dangerous memory weaknesses are:
- **CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)**
- **CWE-120 (Classic Buffer Overflow)**

These rank 3 and 5 in the base list but are not included in the MDSE list due to the correction of the frequency bias towards proper inclusion of their severity scores (8.34 and 8.55).

Other memory weaknesses in the MSSW class and base lists include:
- **CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read)**
- **CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)**
- **CWE-416 (Use After Free)**
- **CWE-415 (Double Free)**
- **CWE-119 (General Memory Corruption)**
- **CWE-400 (Memory Exhaustion)**

### Comparison of Injection and Memory Weaknesses
Compared to MDSE, the MSSW equation highlights several injection weaknesses with much higher severity than any memory weaknesses. Analysis of related CVEs confirms that injection vulnerabilities are easier to exploit and have a higher impact. An injection directly leads to arbitrary command, code, or script execution, whereas turning a buffer overflow into arbitrary code execution requires significant effort and advanced skills.

### Next Most Dangerous CWEs
The next most dangerous groups of weaknesses in the MSSW class and base lists relate to:
- **Randomization**: CWE-330 (Use of Insufficiently Random Values)
- **Authentication**: CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials)
- **File Upload**: CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type)
- **Cryptography**: CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery), CWE-326 (Inadequate Encryption Strength)
- **Arithmetics and Conversion**: CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound), CWE-191 (Integer Underflow)
- **Input Validation**: CWE-129 (Improper Validation of Array Index)

### Mapping Dependencies
Both the MDSE and MSSW rankings depend heavily on how NVD assigns CWEs to particular CVEs. The CWE selection is restricted to view CWE-1003. Insufficient information about a CVE or an insufficiently specific CWE may lead to the use of the closest matching CWE class or pillar.

### Related Work
The need to improve information security has motivated widespread interest in metrics, both qualitative and quantitative. However, many in the software security community doubt our ability to quantify security. Despite this, acceptable but possibly imperfect metrics must be developed to facilitate security decisions and evaluate changes in security posture.

### Future Work
Future work should evaluate whether intentional bias towards either frequency or severity is more useful in this domain. Additionally, it would be useful to identify CWEs whose associated vulnerabilities are frequently used in actual and impactful breaches.

### Conclusion
Creating aggregate metrics that combine multiple simple measurements is of practical importance for the field of security. Our work aggregates frequency and severity (i.e., exploitability and impact) into a single metric, addressing the limitations of the officially published CWE metric and producing the most accurate equation yet for measuring the most significant software security weaknesses.
