User: Please provide some common system monitoring indicators, such as CPU usage, memory usage, etc., and explain which monitoring indicators are more important in various scenarios.
Assistant: Common system monitoring indicators include: 1. CPU usage: Refers to the CPU usage in the system, including the usage of the entire system and the usage of each process. In scenarios that require high performance, such as video rendering, compiling programs, etc., CPU usage is more important. 2. Memory usage: refers to the usage of memory in the system, including the usage of the entire system and the usage of each process. In scenarios that require a large amount of calculation or cached data, such as machine learning model training, big data processing, etc., memory usage is more important. 3. Disk IO: refers to the speed of reading and writing disks in the system, including the number of bytes read and written, the number of reads and writes, and the average response time. In scenarios that require a large number of file or database operations, such as log processing and data storage, disk IO is more important. 4. Network traffic: refers to the traffic transmitted by the network in the system, including inbound traffic and outbound traffic. Network traffic is more important in scenarios where network communication or massive data transmission is required, such as online games, video streaming, etc. 5. Number of processes: refers to the number of processes running in the system. In scenarios where it is necessary to control resource consumption or solve problems such as process blocking, the number of processes is more important. 6. System load: refers to the number of processes running simultaneously in the system and the length of the request queue. In scenarios where system performance and stability need to be guaranteed, system load is more important. Different scenarios need to pay attention to different monitoring indicators, which need to be selected and reasonably configured according to the actual situation. For example, in a high-performance computing scenario, you need to pay attention to the CPU and memory usage; in a network communication scenario, you need to pay attention to network traffic and delay; in a system stability scenario, you need to pay attention to indicators such as system load and number of processes.
