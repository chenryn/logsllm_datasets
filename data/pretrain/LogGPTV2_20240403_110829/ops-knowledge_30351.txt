User: How can system upgrades and maintenance be performed without service interruption?
Assistant: The following methods are required to achieve uninterrupted system upgrades and maintenance: 1. Load balancer: use a load balancer to distribute traffic. When a server needs to be upgraded and maintained, it is not necessary to shut down the entire service. Traffic is distributed to other healthy servers, so that the continuous operation of the service can be guaranteed. 2. Containerization: Use containerization technology to package applications and dependencies into containers, and switch traffic between multiple containers, so that during upgrades or maintenance, traffic can be switched to a normal running container without affecting the operation of other containers. 3. Rolling upgrade: Use the rolling upgrade method to gradually update each component or service in the system, each time only affecting a small number of users or traffic, and then wait for it to stabilize before continuing to update other parts. This method takes longer to complete the upgrade process, but it ensures that the entire service remains available during the upgrade process. 4. Security partition: partition services by security level, place high-priority services in the security zone, and strictly monitor and protect these services to ensure that they will not be affected in any way during maintenance and upgrades. 5. Hot backup: to achieve hot backup, that is, to provide the same service through a backup server when the entire service process and functions remain unchanged. When the main server is upgraded or maintained, the backup server takes over its work, thus ensuring Continuity of Service.
