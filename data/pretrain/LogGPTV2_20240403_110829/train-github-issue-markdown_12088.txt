I'm experiencing an issue with the Bootstrap carousel not functioning correctly in any version of Internet Explorer. I have included the following JavaScript files: `bootstrap.js`, `bootstrap-transition.js`, and `bootstrap-carousel.js`. 

Any assistance or guidance on how to resolve this problem would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your help.

Best regards,
