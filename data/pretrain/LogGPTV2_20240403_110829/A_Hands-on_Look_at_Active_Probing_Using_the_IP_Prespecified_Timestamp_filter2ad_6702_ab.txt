Option Management. Henceforth we use the following notation: the term Dj
represents the set of destinations which respond to the generic TSp probe by
stamping the prespeciﬁed address j times, while the D
notation refers to a
speciﬁc probe. For instance, D
is the set of destinations which, solicited with
ICMPp probes, returned replies containing only one stamped record.

Tab.3(a) suggests the rule followed by most devices to manage TSp: the option
is stamped once every time the probe passes through the interface associated to
the currently pointed prespeciﬁed address. Since UDPp and SKIPp probes, unlike
ICMPp, return the option as aﬀected by the forward path only, the similarity
among D
supports such hypotesis. Tab.3(b), in which
the (i, j) element represents the size of D
, deeper investigates such
(147.8k ) conﬁrms again
scenario: the big intersection between D
our hypothesis. Hence, if a (D|DDDD) probe enters and leaves the destination
node through the same interface D, the option is stamped twice, otherwise just
once. As we will discuss in Sec. 5, such behavior may reduce the applicability of
the technique proposed in [3].

4.2 RFC Compliance Analysis
Timestamp Format. According to the RFC 791, a standard timestamp should
always be lower than 86.4 ∗ 105 (24h ∗ 3600s ∗ 1000), while a non−standard value
should belong to the range [231, 232]. Hence, the range ]86.4 ∗ 105, 231[ consists
of non RFC−compliant values. Among the 660k destinations stamping at least
once, we found timestamp values according to the following distribution: 87.6%
standard, 11.3% non−standard, 1.15% non RFC−compliant. We also found 449
destinations stamping diﬀerent probes using diﬀerent formats and 9 of them
doing it inside the same answer.
4 DVMRP [12] codes 3.x are commonly associated to Juniper, while 12.x to Cisco.

records
(b) sources of the anomalies
Fig. 3. Non RFC−compliant behaviors
Focusing our attention on the standard values, we analyzed the diﬀerence
between contiguous not null timestamps from the same reply. Fig.3(a) shows
such values for ICMPp replies, where we identify three cases: (i) small positive
and (ii) negative diﬀerences, (iii) both positive and negative huge diﬀerences.
According to the rule described in Sec.4.1, the ﬁrst case represents an estimation
of the reply−generation delay on the destination node. Although limited by
the milliseconds resolution, such estimation may represent a valid alternative
to classic techniques based on round−trip time. The second case corresponds
to transient anomalies which quickly disappeared. The third case represents a
persistent behavior we observed on just 38 destinations, which seem to stamp the
option by using two diﬀerent clocks. Since such replies contain four timestamps
following the t1t2t2t3 pattern, where often t1 ≈ t3, we speculate the presence of
a middlebox along the path which is responsible of inserting t1 and t3.
Anomalies. Disregarding timestamp values, 40013 targeted destinations pro-
vided non RFC−compliant replies, which lead us to the following taxonomy:
– OWR: some prespeciﬁed IP addresses are overwritten;
– SKP: the destination stamps the option by skipping one or more records
(e.g. the second IP is stamped, but not the ﬁrst one);
– PTR: the pointer ﬁeld is inconsistent with respect to the number of times-
tamps;
– CUT: the original packet carried by the ICMP error message is truncated
– OFL: the overﬂow ﬁeld counts several extra−stamps, but the number of
before the end of the option;
timestamps is less than four;
– RPL: the option data is replaced with part of the original packet header.
It is worth to notice that the CUT anomaly is diﬀerent from a missing option.
Indeed, the IHL ﬁeld of the IP header carried back by the ICMP error message is
15 in the ﬁrst case, pointing out the presence of the option, and 5 in the latter
case. Regarding the PTR anomaly, the pointer value should belong to the set
{5, 13, 21, 29, 37}, but we also found non−standard values: 253 and 9.

Fig.3(b) shows that most anomalies, with the exception of CUT, were gener-
ated by destinations belonging to the Pathending set. Although such set may
