User: I have a problem with debugging Python programs under the Netbeans IDE. When I start debugging, the debugger writes the following log and error. Thank you for help.

[LOG]PythonDebugger : overall Starting
>>>[LOG]PythonDebugger.taskStarted : I am Starting a new Debugging Session ...
[LOG]This window is an interactive debugging context aware Python Shell
[LOG]where you can enter python console commands while debugging
>>>c:\documents and settings\aster\.netbeans\6.7\config\nbpython\debug\nbpythondebug\jpydaemon.py
args = ['C:\\Documents and Settings\\aster\\.netbeans\\6.7\\config\\nbPython\\debug\\nbpythondebug\\jpydaemon.py', 'localhost', '11111']
localDebuggee= None
JPyDbg connecting localhost on in= 11111 /out= 11112
ERROR:JPyDbg connection failed errno(10061) : Connection refused
Debug session normal end

ERROR :: Server Socket listen for debuggee has timed out (more than 20 seconds wait) java.net.SocketTimeoutException: Accept timed out

thanks for answer
Assistant: For Python I like WingIDE from Wingware.
