I am having trouble creating a bean of type java.io.File with a single
constructor-arg. The problem is that the bean that is instantiated seems to
"double" its argument value.
Application Context:
* * *
test  
Test code:
* * *
import java.io.File;  
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;  
import org.springframework.context.support.FileSystemXmlApplicationContext;
public class Test {  
public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {  
File f1 = new File("test");  
System.out.println(f1.getAbsolutePath());  
ApplicationContext ac = new
FileSystemXmlApplicationContext("applicationContext.xml");  
File f2 = (File)ac.getBean("dir");  
System.out.println(f2.getAbsolutePath());
    }
}
Abbreviated Output from code:
* * *
run:  
[java] /home/vickeryj/temp/springTest/test
...
    [java] /home/vickeryj/temp/springTest/test/test
In short it seems to me that both println statements should be the same,
however the bean retrieved from the application context has a path of
"test/test" rather than the value of "test" which I passed in.
Can anyone recreate this?
