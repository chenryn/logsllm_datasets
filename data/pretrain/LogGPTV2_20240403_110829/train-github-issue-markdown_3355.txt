`our_rand_r` is a fast and simple random generator defined in
`sklearn/tree/_tree.pyx`
Problems:
  * The functions only return 0s if seeded with 0. We need to audit the use of this function and make sure it is never seeded with 0.
  * The code is duplicated (`sklearn/linear_model/cd_fast.pyx`) and will be in #4738, in #4873, and possibly other PR . My first attempt to re-use only one code (by moving the inline function in _tree.pxd file) has failed: Every tests passed on Linux (Travis) but it broke 45 tests on Windows (AppVeyor), I did not figure out why.
