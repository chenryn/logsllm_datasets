`our_rand_r` is a fast and simple random number generator defined in `sklearn/tree/_tree.pyx`. There are several issues with this function that need to be addressed:

1. **Seeding with Zero**: When the function is seeded with 0, it only returns 0s. We need to conduct an audit of the function's usage to ensure it is never seeded with 0.

2. **Code Duplication**: The code for `our_rand_r` is duplicated in `sklearn/linear_model/cd_fast.pyx`. This duplication is being addressed in pull requests #4738 and #4873, and possibly others. 

   - **Refactoring Attempt**: My initial attempt to refactor the code by moving the inline function to `_tree.pxd` was unsuccessful. While all tests passed on Linux (Travis), 45 tests failed on Windows (AppVeyor). The root cause of these failures has not yet been determined.

To resolve these issues, we need to:
- Ensure `our_rand_r` is not seeded with 0.
- Address the code duplication by successfully refactoring the function and resolving the test failures on Windows.
