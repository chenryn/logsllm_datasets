### Table 5: Top 10 Most Popular Tokens to Appear Before and After Targets in Target Embeddings

| Token | Frequency (Before) | Frequency (After) |
|-------|--------------------|-------------------|
| secure | 2761 | 4755 |
| mail | 4131 | 2709 |
| login | 2459 | 3583 |
| id | 2386 | 3144 |
| support | 2384 | 2989 |
| services | 2055 | 2034 |
| webapps | 78,461 | - |
| Others | 258,110 | - |

**Summary:**
These results show that, unlike with Certificate Authorities (CAs), there is a wide range of providers who host target embedding domains. The most popular hosting providers offer options for free hosting. Combined with our findings on free registration and free certificate issuance, we conclude that there is an end-to-end path by which attackers can acquire, host, and secure target embedding domains for free. As a result, many such users currently face no economic barrier to entry for target embedding.

### 5.5 What is the Structure of Target Embeddings?

Next, we evaluate the structure of target embeddings: what words most commonly precede and follow target embeddings? To compute this, we tokenize the Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs) at dots and dashes and extract the tokens appearing immediately before and after each embedded target. In Table 5, we report on the top ten most common tokens, both before and after. "nil" denotes when the target was the first item to appear in the FQDN. We make several observations:

1. **Phishing-Related Tokens:**
   The most popular tokens—both before and after the target—are strongly concentrated around what appear to be attempts at phishing for user credentials. Terms such as "login," "secure," "signin," and "account" are all associated with user logins. Similarly, "appleid," "services," and "pay"—three of the most popular preceding tokens—are all associated with monetary transactions.

2. **Diverse Distribution:**
   While there is a reasonably diverse distribution of most tokens—and while "nil" and "www" are expected to be popular subdomains—"appleid" stands out as a significant outlier. This not only reinforces our earlier finding that "apple.com" is one of the most highly targeted domains but also shows how attackers do it: by reinforcing it with additional subdomains common to that website.

3. **Comparison with Existing Research:**
   We are not the first to explore words that precede or follow suspicious domain names. Netcraft [1] notes briefly that they incorporate prefixes and suffixes that are common in phishing domains when computing the domain score they use in validating certificate issuance requests. Unfortunately, their list is not public, and they only list a few: "update," "login," and "secure." We also see a high frequency of "login" and "secure," but "update" is not in the top 10 for either set of tokens.

**Summary:**
The tokens that appear before and after an embedded target can yield a powerful signal as to the intent behind the embedding. This insight has been applied during some CAs' issuance [1]. 

### Figure 5: Cumulative Fraction of Target Embedding Domains by Hosting Providers

**Hosting Provider | Unique Domains**
|-----------------|------------------|
| verotel.com | 7,670 |
| namecheaphosting.com | 3,852 |
| amazonaws.com | 3,817 |
| websitewelcome.com | 3,408 |
| digitalocean.com | 2,203 |
| unifiedlayer.com | 1,631 |
| ovh.net | 1,569 |
| google.com | 1,226 |
| hetzner.de | 1,205 |
| internetx.com | 1,134 |
| Others | 40,306 |

**Summary:**
Unlike the narrow distributions of CAs and registrars, we find that target embedding domains use a wide range of hosting sites. Figure 5 shows a long-tail: 0.6% (427) of the hosting domains we identified host only a single target embedding domain. However, there is a slight preference towards a small set of providers. The top 10 hosting domains in Table 4 collectively cover 42.09% of all the target embedding domains we observe. Many of the most popular hosting domains offer options for free hosting, including "amazonaws.com" (5.54%), "unifiedlayer.com" (2.37%), and "hetzner.de" (1.75%). Given our results showing preferences for free domain registration and certificate issuance, we speculate that they are using free versions for hosting as well.

### 5.6 How are Wildcard Certificates Utilized?

Recall that wildcard certificates contain at least one domain of the form `*.foo.bar.com`, allowing the certificate holder to use one compact certificate to authenticate many one-level subdomains of `foo.bar.com`. This is a powerful tool for benign website operators, as rolling out new services and subdomains does not necessarily require obtaining new certificates.

Wildcards in certificates may only be used to expand a single level of subdomain: the pattern matching the wildcard cannot include a dot [38]. For instance, `bar.example.com` is a valid completion of `*.example.com`, but `foo.bar.example.com` is not. Due to this restriction, any attempt to use a wildcard to mask the intended target of a target embedding attack must include the target’s TLD immediately after the wildcard.

We measure all certificates where the wildcard is immediately followed by the TLD of a target seen in our targeting attacks, followed by a hyphen or a dot (e.g., `*.com-foo.bar.com` or `*.co.uk.bar.com`). Each such wildcard certificate has the potential to be used to target-embed any domain with the matching TLD. We cannot know which target(s) an attacker intends to impersonate—or if the certificates were ever used for impersonation—instead, we measure an upper bound of how many wildcard domains are capable of being used this way.

In total, we observe 343,336 unique wildcard domains whose wildcard is immediately followed by a TLD used in a targeted domain. Figure 6 shows how this number has changed over time, broken down by the CA who issued them.

Like with the number of target embedding certificates overall (§5.3), we see an exponential increase in the number of wildcard certificates starting with a targeted TLD. Unlike our previous results, this increase can be attributed to a single CA: COMODO. Likewise, the decline in late 2018 can also be directly attributed to COMODO. We are unable to explain this phenomenon, but we note that it is not relegated solely to wildcard certificates, nor even to target embedding writ large. Over this time, COMODO changed its name to Sectigo, and its overall number of valid certificates has gone down considerably. Let’s Encrypt began issuing wildcard certificates in mid-2018. Although its share of target embedding domains has gone up, it has not done so to the extent that Let’s Encrypt entered the non-wildcard ecosystem.

### 5.7 Composing Impersonation Techniques

Both combosquatting and typosquatting occur in the actual domain of an FQDN, whereas target embedding requires the use of a subdomain. Due to this difference, target embedding is not mutually exclusive with other forms of domain impersonation. In this section, we investigate domains that compose methods of impersonation.

First, we take the 256,045 FQDNs from our dataset of target embedding domains. Next, we see how many of those FQDNs’ actual domains are either combosquatting or typosquatting, using the domains collected in §4.3. We discovered 2,442 FQDNs using both target embedding and combosquatting, and 443 FQDNs using both target embedding and typosquatting.

Of the 2,875 FQDNs from the union of those two sets, 960 targeted the same target using both methods of impersonation. 1,062 targeted "apple" with one method, and "icloud" with the other method. Most of the 853 remaining FQDNs targeted seemingly unrelated pairs, such as "www.docusign.com.amazonline.com.br" and "paypal.com.webapps-update-icloud.ga."

Finally, we see if any FQDNs compose Unicode homographs with target embedding. We begin by taking all domains with Unicode characters, identified with the Punycode [10] prefix "xn–." For each token that includes Unicode characters, we try all combinations of ASCII characters that could be confused with the Unicode characters [28]. If this substitution results in the e2LD of an Alexa 100k target domain, we then see if that token is followed by the target’s TLD, and that this TLD is not the real TLD of the domain. In all, we discovered 13 FQDNs that compose Unicode homographs and target embedding in this way.

We can only speculate why someone would compose impersonation methods. It may be the case that attackers feel they can maximize their chances at successfully deceiving users. Or, perhaps, they are testing different techniques to see which ones are more effective.
