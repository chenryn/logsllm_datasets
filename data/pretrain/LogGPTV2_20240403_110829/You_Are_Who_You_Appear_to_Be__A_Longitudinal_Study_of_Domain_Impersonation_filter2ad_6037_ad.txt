Table 5: Top 10 most popular tokens to appear before and
after targets in target embeddings.
Summary These results show that, unlike with CAs, there is a
wide range of providers who host target embedding domains. The
most popular hosting providers offer options for free hosting. Com-
bined with our results showing free registration and free certificate
issuance, we conclude that there is an end-to-end path by which
attackers can acquire, host, and secure target embedding domains
for free. As a result, currently, many such users face no economic
barrier of entry to target embedding.
5.5 What is the structure of target embeddings?
Next, we evaluate the structure of target embeddings: what words
most commonly precede and follow target embeddings? To compute
this, we tokenize the FQDN at dots and dashes and extract the
tokens appearing immediately before and immediately after each
embedded target. In Table 5, we report on the top ten most common
tokens, both before and after. nil denotes when the target was the
first item to appear in the FQDN. We make several observations.
First, the most popular tokens—both before and after the target—
are strongly concentrated around what appear to be attempts at
phishing for user credentials. Terms such as login, secure, signin,
and account are all associated with user logins. Similarly, appleid,
services, and pay—three of the most popular preceding tokens—
are all associated with monetary transactions.
Second, while there is a reasonably diverse distribution of most
tokens—and while nil and www are expected to be popular
subdomains—appleid stands out as a significant outlier. This not
only reinforces our earlier finding that apple.com is one of the
most highly targeted domains: it also shows how attackers do it: by
reinforcing it with additional subdomains common to that website.
Third, we are not the first to explore words that precede or fol-
low suspicious domain names. Netcraft [1] notes briefly that they
incorporate prefixes and suﬃxes that are common in phishing do-
mains when computing the domain score they use in validating
certificate issuance requests. Unfortunately, their list is not public,
and they only list a few: update, login, and secure. We also see
high frequency of login and secure, but update is not in the top
10 for either set of tokens.
Summary The tokens that appear before and after an embedded
target can yield a powerful signal as to the intent behind the embed-
ding. This insight has been applied during some CAs’ issuance [1];

marily hosted on a few providers, but use a wide range of
providers overall. (Note: log-scale axes.)

embedding domains.
determine who operates these IP addresses, we used the technique
proposed by Cangialosi et al. [9]: we issue reverse DNS lookups
for the IP addresses (many hosting providers, like Akamai, include
their names in reverse lookups). If this information is not available,
we then look up the IP address’ autonomous system (AS) number,
and report who operates that AS.
Figure 5 presents the distribution of the fraction of domains
hosted by all distinct hosting domains we identified, and Table 4
shows the top 10 most popular hosting domains we observed. We
make two key observations:
First, unlike the narrow distributions of CAs and registrars, we
find that target embedding domains use a wide range of hosting
sites. Figure 5 shows a long-tail: 0.6% (427) of the hosting domains
we identified host only a single target embedding domain.
Second, however, there is a slight preference towards a small set
of providers. The top 10 hosting domains in Table 4 collectively
cover 42.09% of all of the target embedding domains we observe.
Unsurprisingly, many of the most popular hosting domains of-
fer options for free hosting, including, amazonaws.com (5.54%),
unifiedlayer.com (2.37%), and hetzner.de (1.75%). We are unable
to verify whether these target embedding domains are using the
free or for-pay versions of these hosting providers. However, given
our results that show preferences for free domain registration and
certificate issuance, we speculate that they are using free versions
for hosting, as well.

Table 6: Top 10 most popular TLDs to follow a wildcard.
For each, we provide the number of unique targets we ob-
served using that TLD in target embedding; all of these tar-
gets could be embedded by one of these wildcard certificates.
We limit analysis to TLDs that are used by at least one target.
mid-2018. Although its share of target embedding domains has
gone up, it has not done so to the extent that Let’s Encrypt entered
the non-wildcard ecosystem.
Next, we investigate the TLDs used in these potentially target
embedding certificates. Table 6 shows the top 10 most frequent
TLDs that appear immediately after a wildcard. Three of the four
most common TLDs used by targets (.com, .net, and .de) show up
in the top 10 TLDs following wildcards.
Table 7 shows the top 10 actual TLDs used in these wildcard
certificates. Unlike the TLDs used in our target embedding domains
(§5.2), we see a stronger concentration of the more traditionally
popular TLDs, with particularly higher numbers of .de and .net. Be-
cause attackers are more likely to use TLDs that permit free domain
registration, this result indicates that many wildcard certificates are
likely not used for target embedding. However, we also see many
instances of free TLDs that are correlated with target embedding
attacks: .tk (8,626), .ga (5,892), .ml (7,037), .cf (6,046), and .gq (4,670).
Finally, .stream is the third most popular real TLD for these wild-
card domains. At least 90% of the 13,067 wildcard domains using
.stream as their real TLD are part of the *.net- campaign outlined
in Section 6.
Summary Wildcard certificates offer the possibility for the owner
to perform target embedding on an unbounded number of targets.
We observe a sharp increase in the number of wildcard certificates
over the past couple years; with Let’s Encrypt only recently offering
wildcard certificates, we expect this to increase in the near future.
Our results of the TLDs (both target and actual) used in wildcard
certificates echo those of target embedding (Section 5.2).
5.7 Composing Impersonation Techniques
Both combosquatting and typosquatting occur in the actual domain
of an FQDN, whereas target embedding requires the use of a sub-
domain. Due to this difference, target embedding is not mutually
exclusive with other forms of domain impersonation. In this section,
we investigate domains that compose methods of impersonation.
First we take the 256,045 FQDNs from our dataset of target
embedding domains. Next, we see how many of those FQDNs’
actual domains are either combosquatting or typosquatting, using
Figure 6: Stacked-plot graph representing the number of cer-
tificates valid on a given day that were issued by top CAs, for
certs with wildcard domains that start with a TLD.
however, it appears that our techniques can be used to help identify
the set of suspicious tokens.
5.6 How are wildcard certificates utilized?
Recall that wildcard certificates contain at least one domain of the
form *.foo.bar.com, allowing the certificate holder to use one
compact certificate to authenticate many one-level subdomains of
foo.bar.com. This is a powerful tool for benign website operators,
as rolling out new services and subdomains does not necessarily
require obtaining new certificates.
Wildcards in certificates may only be used to expand a single
level of subdomain: the pattern matching the wildcard cannot in-
clude a dot [38]. For instance, bar.example.com is a valid comple-
tion of *.example.com, but foo.bar.example.com is not. Due
to this restriction, any attempt to use a wildcard to mask the in-
tended target of a target embedding attack must include the target’s
TLD immediately after the wildcard.
We measure all certificates where the wildcard is immediately fol-
lowed by the TLD of a target seen in our targeting attacks, followed
by a hyphen or a dot (e.g., *.com-foo.bar.com or *.co.uk.bar.com).
Each such wildcard certificate has the potential to be used to target-
embed any domain with the matching TLD. We cannot know which
target(s) an attacker intends to impersonate—or if the certificates
were ever used for impersonation—instead, we measure an upper
bound of how many wildcard domains are capable of being used
this way.
In total, we observe 343,336 unique wildcard domains whose
wildcard is immediately followed by a TLD used in a targeted
domain. Figure 6 shows how this number has changed over time,
broken down by the CA who issued them.
Like with the number of target embedding certificates overall
(§5.3), we see an exponential increase in the number of wildcard
certificates starting with a targeted TLD. Unlike our previous results,
this increase can be attributed to a single CA: COMODO. Likewise,
the decline in late 2018 can also be directly attributed to COMODO.
We are unable to explain this phenomenon, but we note that it
is not relegated solely to wildcard certificates, nor even to target
embedding writ large. Over this time, COMODO changed its name
to Sectigo, and its overall number of valid certificates has gone down
considerably. Let’s Encrypt began issuing wildcard certificates in

Table 7: Top 10 most common actual TLDs used by wildcard
certificates that begin with a fake TLD following the *.
the domains collected in §4.3. We discovered 2,442 FQDNs using
both target embedding and combosquatting, and 443 FQDNs using
both target embedding and typosquatting.
Of the 2,875 FQDNs from the union of those two sets, 960 tar-
geted the same target using both methods of impersonation. 1,062
targeted “apple” with one method, and “icloud” with the other
method. Most of the 853 remaining FQDNs targeted seemingly un-
related pairs, such as “www.docusign.com.amazonline.com.br”
and “paypal.com.webapps-update-icloud.ga”.
Finally, we see if any FQDNs compose unicode homographs with
target embedding. We begin by taking all domains with unicode
characters, identified with the Punycode [10] prefix ”xn–”. For each
token that includes Unicode characters, we try all combinations of
ASCII characters that could be confused with the Unicode characters
[28]. If this substitution results in the e2LD of an Alexa 100k target
domain, we then see if that token is followed by the target’s TLD2,
and that this TLD is not the real TLD of the domain. In all, we
discovered 13 FQDNs that compose Unicode homographs and target
embedding in this way.
We can only speculate why someone would compose imper-
sonation methods. It may be the case that attackers feel they can
maximize their chances at successfully deceiving users. Or, perhaps
