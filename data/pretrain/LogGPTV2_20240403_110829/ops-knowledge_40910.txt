User: Working on different projects I have the choice of selecting different programming languages, as long as the task is done.
I was wondering what the real difference is, in terms of performance, between writing a program in Python, versus doing it in C.
The tasks to be done are pretty varied, e.g. sorting textfiles, disk access, network access, textfile parsing.
Is there really a noticeable difference between sorting a textfile using the same algorithm in C versus Python, for example?
And in your experience, given the power of current CPU's (i7), is it really a noticeable difference (Consider that its a program that doesnt bring the system to its knees).
Assistant: C is definitely faster than Python because Python is written in C.
C is middle level language and hence faster but there not much a great difference between C & Python regarding executable time it takes.
but it is really very easy to write code in Python than C and it take much shorter time to write code and learn Python than C.
Because its easy to write its easy to test also.
