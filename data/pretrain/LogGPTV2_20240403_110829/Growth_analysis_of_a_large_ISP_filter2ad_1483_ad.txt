the corresponding Cogent-owned CIDR address blocks using the
ARIN and RIPE registry databases. This list contained 17,731,584
IPv4 addresses, and was used through the week of March 3, 2013.
Using data collected by a recent “Internet Census” [6], which
issued multiple reverse DNS queries for the entire IPv4 address
space, we identiﬁed an additional 2,426,624 Cogent-owned IP ad-
dresses which could potentially contain *.cogentco.com reverse
DNS records. While our original query list contained just 88% of
the expanded list, we found the number of *.atlas.cogentco.com
records only increased from 50,981 to 52,643 (a 3.3% increase,
cf. Figure 1(b)). Therefore, as with the map comparison described
above, we believe this comparison suggests our targeted DNS-based
mapping well covers Cogent’s network.
5. EXPLORATION
Having established the validity and coverage of our data, we now
conduct an initial time-series exploration of Cogent’s network. Our
analysis proceeds at three levels: ﬁrst, considering the interfaces,
independent of the routers; second, considering the routers, inde-
pendent of their connections; and third, considering the inferred
network graph.

physical and virtual interfaces per router for all weeks.
5.1
Interface evolution
First, we consider Cogent’s interfaces independently of their as-
sociated routers. In Figure 2, we see that a majority of interfaces are
physical interfaces, which we further breakdown in Figure 3. The
virtual interfaces are predominantly VLAN interfaces, plus loop-
back interfaces for each router. Based on our dataset, we infer that
the three most common types of physical interfaces in Cogent’s
network are 100 Mbps Ethernet, 10 Gbps Ethernet, and 1 Gbps
Ethernet, respectively.
We ﬁnd that the number of interfaces grew linearly over the pe-
riod of our data collection. We infer that Cogent adds an average
of approximately 153 new interfaces each week (R2 = 0.92). We
also infer that this growth is not proportional to the existing distri-
bution of interface types. Figure 3 shows that the rate of growth is
highest for 10 Gbps Ethernet interfaces, followed by that for 100
Mbps Ethernet.
5.2 Router evolution
Next, we consider Cogent’s routers, independent of the connec-
tions between them. In Figure 4, we plot the number of inferred
Cogent routers over time, and ﬁnd that Cogent adds an average of
approximately 11 new routers per week. We note that the apparent
recent dip in growth rate occurs at the start of 2013.
We ﬁnd that the distribution of the number of interfaces per
router remains relatively stable over the course of our data collec-
tion. The average number of interfaces only rises from 10.7 per
router to 11.4, while the median remains six. In Figure 5, we sepa-
rate the interfaces into physical and virtual interfaces (see Table 1),
and ﬁnd that the weekly distributions remain stable throughout the
study. The number of physical interfaces decays as an exponential

Figure 6 shows a visualization of the inferred network for the
week of April 7, 2013, where we have grouped together all routers
belonging to the same site. The graph, produced using Gephi [8],
is colored according to a community detection algorithm [10], and
the size of the nodes is proportional to their betweenness centrality,
i.e., related to the number of shortest paths the node is part of. Even
though the node positions resemble geographical positions, they are
computed by a force-directed layout algorithm with no geographic
information. This is a further indication that the inferred network is
related to the real one.
We constructed an equivalent graph for each valid week in the
dataset, and now look into the evolution of a few important graph
metrics. Leskovec et al. [18] examined the evolution of several real
networks, such as the AS graph and the arXiv citation network,
and found two phenomena: densiﬁcation, and shrinking diameters.
Densiﬁcation states that the number of edges e(t), and the number
of nodes n(t), over time follow the relation e(t) ∝ n(t)α, with
1 < α < 2. This implies that the average degree increases over
time. They also found that the effective diameter of the network
shrinks over time.3 We found neither of these phenomena to be
signiﬁcant in the evolution of the inferred Cogent graph.
Figure 7 shows a scatterplot of the number of nodes versus the
number of edges for the inferred network graph. The relation is
very close to linear, but the exponent of the densiﬁcation law is
0.9. Correspondingly, the bottom curve in Figure 8 shows that the
average degree actually decreases, with a small negative slope of
−0.0011 in a linear ﬁt. The top curve in Figure 8 shows the evo-
lution of the effective diameter of the graph. The diameter remains
nearly constant, with a negative slope of −0.001 in a linear ﬁt.
Since our collection period of slightly more than one year is rel-
atively short compared to the analysis in [18], it remains to be seen
if these trends continue as we collect more data.
6. CONCLUSION
As noted by previous researches, DNS queries are a potentially
problematic source of topological information; we ﬁnd this is not
the case for Cogent’s network. We were lucky that Cogent’s inter-
face naming scheme was both rich with data and obvious to parse.
Finding other ISPs with similar naming schemes and sensibilities is
simply a matter of chance; if even feasible, it would require human
intervention to build a database of rules, similar to Rocketfuel’s
undns tool, which attempts to map routers to physical locations
based on DNS records [25].
Fortunately, Chabarek and Barford are currently developing such
a database [11]. Using a combination of machine learning-based
clustering and hand-crafted regular expressions, they have partially
discovered interface speeds, equipment types, and router functions
from the DNS addresses of approximately 26,000 organizations.
While their initial study used only the DNS records in the CAIDA
dataset previously mentioned [7], the resulting rule database could
be used to expand the approach taken in this work to other ISPs.
Unfortunately, the future of performing reverse DNS queries on
a large-scale looks hazy. The simple approach taken here of issuing
queries at a low rate from hosts at around 100 PlanetLab locations,
will not scale as ISP networks transition to IPv6. Therefore, it is
important for the research community to measure as many network
properties as possible while the scale of IP address blocks is still
relatively small.

tinuous interpolation of the node distance cumulative distribution.
