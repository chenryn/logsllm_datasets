p = 0.57). This shows that users have trouble identifying who is
collecting their personal data when it comes to ads, but stating the
name of the collecting company close to the banner helps.
Assessment of provided data. In the survey, participants are shown
three data category sections, each listing different data types we
received by using the different transparency tools (Q12–Q21). The
categories are (1) technical data, (2) tracking data, and (3) segment
data. Technical data is raw data presented to users without any kind
of processing, typically in a text file. This is likely log data that can
be directly extracted from HTTP traffic (e. g., user agents) or directly
derived from this data (e. g., locations based on IP addresses). Track-
ing data, also often provided in text files, is information on websites
on which the ad company has tracked the user (clickstream data)
708or with whom personal data was shared. (Interest) segment data is
information ad companies inferred from a user’s online behavior.
The results of participants’ views on the provided data are shown
in Figure 2a. Tools that shared inferred data (i. e., segments) were
evaluated very positively in all four question categories. Over
three quarters (76 %) of participants stated (sum of answer options
“Strongly Agree” and “Agree”) that they understood the provided
data and thought that it was helpful to understand what companies
do with personal data. It is worth noting that not all companies
infer this kind of data. For example, a company offering a service
to identify ad fraud will most likely not infer high-level data but
still has access to personal data like IP addresses. Tracking informa-
tion is less easily understood by participants: Close to half of the
participants (53 %) report that they understood the data and found
it helpful (47 %). Profiles that provide technical data were rated
slightly less understandable but much less helpful (39 %), and in
these profiles, data is presented in a much less clear way (37 %) than
in the other categories of profile. We found a correlation between all
four questions on clear presentation, understandability, helpfulness,
and whether users anticipated this type of data, in each section of
categories (Pearson correlation: r > 0.5, p < 0.001). Meaning that
all four questions in each category were answered similarly.
After presenting all three profiles of one category, we asked
participants if such data is useful to assess the privacy impact of
companies. The results are given in Figure 2b. Similar to the as-
sessment of profile categories, segment data is rated to be most
helpful, followed by tracking data. When it comes to preferences
which data users would like to receive when they performed an
access request (Q23), participants equally rank “tracking data” and
“interest data” as first choice (41 % for tracking and 45 % for segment
data) but more users chose “tracking data” as their second choice
(47 % vs. 28 %—see Figure 2c). This is unexpected as participants
stated they found segment data to be most useful (see Figure 2b) to
assess privacy implications of a company, and one would expect
that they also prioritized profiles accordingly. While participants
did not directly comment on this discrepancy one explanation could
be that tracking information is accurate and factual, while segment
information is inferred and previous research has shown that it
is often inaccurate [42]. Therefore, segment data helps users to
understand why they see specific ads but tracking data gives them
a better idea of what data companies have. In general, combined
overall profile types, participants who stated that they understood
the provided personal data thought that it was useful to assess the
use of data (p < 0.0001) and stated it was presented transparently
(p < 0.0001). Furthermore, participants who stated that the pre-
sented data was useful—regarding the usage of data—also stated
that the data helped to bring more transparency to the advertise-
ment ecosystem (p ≈ 0.0005). Access to technical data is by far the
least favorite way how users want to get access to their personal
data. However, technically savvy users who answered our question
regarding the ecosystem (Q7) correctly and stated that they were at
least “knowledgeable” (Q6) about the online tracking industry rated
this kind of information more helpful (p < 0.001).
When asked (Q24), 55 % of participants expressed that, after
seeing personal data collected on a stranger, that they were “very
interested” or “interested” in data collected about themselves. 58 %
stated that they would change their online behavior due to the seen
data (Q25). Considering that only a few had requested their data
previously, this could be related to a social desirability bias, but
it could also indicate that there is simply a lack of awareness of
transparency tools.
Summary. The analysis of users’ perception of available trans-
parency tools shows that individuals prefer the collected data being
shown as interest segment information over raw technical data.
Furthermore, while participants were aware of the privacy impact
of ad companies, only very few did request access to their data but
reported they might do so.
5 BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE
Aside from evaluating existing transparency tools, we contacted 773
companies to assess their view on the usefulness of transparency
tools for users. We motivated our inquires not purely on trans-
parency tools in general but also wanted to assess how current
legislation (i. e., the GDPR) influenced the design of such tools and
which challenges companies faced. To this end, we crawled 773
privacy policies of the companies we analyzed and extracted all
email addresses present in the policies, using a regular expression.
By manual inspection, we identified the relevant email addresses by
name (e. g., PI:EMAIL) and dropped other addresses
(e. g., PI:EMAIL) if we found a more specific one. We
did not find an email address in 35 policies via automatic or man-
ual inspection. We used the regular email server from a research
organization to send the emails.
5.1 Method
We sent the first batch of email invitations to 74 companies (ap-
prox. 10 %) in October 2018. In December 2018, we invited 333
companies (approx. 45 %) to participate in our survey. In January
2019, the final batch of 333 companies was invited. Out of all in-
vitations, 147 resulted in an error message. 48 responses said that
our email had been classified as spam/batch mail, the rest resulted
in other delivery errors. We manually double checked all of these
email addresses for transcription errors. While one company did
not exist anymore, the other companies listed email addresses in
their privacy policies that do not exist at all. Overall, 593 companies
received an invitation to participate in our study.
The survey consists of four categories of questions: (1) general
questions regarding the company’s business processes for “subject
access requests” (SAR), (2) four questions regarding their develop-
ment of SAR processes, (3) three open-ended questions regarding
the company’s view on the usefulness of data transparency and the
GDPR in general, and (4) demographic questions. The full question-
naire can be found in Appendix B. At the end of the questionnaire,
participants were asked to volunteer for an in-person interview.
Interviews were conducted using a semi-structured guideline
as described by Flick [24]. After a brief introduction, interviewees
were asked to explain their job position, if applicable, the business
model of the company they are working for, and then give a broad
assessment of what the GDPR meant for their business. Afterwards,
the interviews focused on the same topics as the survey, but we
also asked participants for their personal opinion about how to
improve transparency. The interviews were conducted in January
and February 2019. All companies that completed the survey and

participated in the interviews did so on the request of anonymity
and are not necessarily the companies whose privacy tools we
analyzed in Section 3. Interviews were transcribed focusing on
content and analyzed using the thematic analysis method [8]. After
initial coding to structure the data it was structured in themes
discussed by multiple interviewees’ to identify their positions. In
two cases the analysis was based on notes because one participant
did not agree to be recorded and in one case the recording was of
bad quality. The coding and analysis was performed by one of the
authors.
5.2 Results
Of the 593 invited companies, 24 (4 %) completed the survey and
eight agreed to participate in an in-person telephone interview. In
14 cases, the survey was taken by a company’s Data Protection
Officer or a person from the legal department. In the remaining
cases, we got responses from persons on the executive level in
the company (e. g., “head of data business” or CEO). Twelve of the
participating companies have their headquarter within the EU, nine
outside the EU (eight in the US and one in Israel), and two companies
preferred not to disclose this information. In nine surveys it was
reported that the company employs 1–100 people, ten had 101–500,
and four companies had more than 1,000 employees. The size of
the department responsible for handing privacy-related requests is
in all but two cases proportional to the company size (i. e., larger
companies have larger privacy departments). The companies where
this is disproportional are companies specialized in privacy-related
consulting.
Of the eight interview partners, four companies directly collect
and process personal data, two companies only handle personal
data on a business-to-business side, and two companies handle both.
All stated that they handle personal data of at least one million
data subjects. Two of the interviewees were privacy consultants
and claimed to work for “dozens” of clients in the ad industry. In
the interviews, they answered the questions generalized for all of
their clients. We report all findings and quotes in the singular to
provide the same level of anonymity to all interview partners.
Impact of the GDPR. In the interviews, several partners high-
lighted that—from their point of view— achieving GDPR compliance
in online advertisement is one of hardest tasks (I-2: “So I represented
advertising in the GDPR groups, so we kind of created a group of
champions, if you want, so I was the champion on advertising, and
it proved that advertising was the most challenging one [...]”). Not
surprisingly, all participants stated (in the interviews as well as the
survey) that the GDPR helped them to convince their management
to invest in privacy. However, aside from these increased costs the
only other benefit mentioned by four companies was that GDPR
compliance might be a competitive factor (e. g., P-17 stated: “It be-
came a marketing talking point that we used to show that people
want some control over what data is collected about them, but other
than that it has had almost zero benefit and quite a bit of cost”).
When asked about the impact of the GDPR on their daily work
we got mixed responses. Some companies stated—aside from the
two months prior to the GDPR—that the workflows in their com-
panies did not changed much while others reported problems that,
as a result of the GDPR, data they had considered non-PII now is
considered PII data (e. g., I-4: “[...] suddenly, any identificator ‘[sic.]
710would become PII. [...] they (the GDPR) say that cookies are per-
sonal identifiable information. [...] So suddenly everyone, absolutely
everyone working in advertising, would handle PII data”). “PII” is
the term used in the legal debate in the US. Interview partners
that claimed their processes had already been GDPR-compliant
beforehand stated that they had to add modules that implement
the required accountability (e. g., records when and how consent
was conceived). One company stated that they had eliminated all
personal identifiers not necessary for their core business, a data
minimization approach favored by privacy scholars.
Access Requests. Interviewees were asked about subject access
requests since the enforcement of the GDPR. While 11 companies
stated that they had a standardized access request process (e. g., a
website that presents the collected data to the user), slightly more
(13) stated that they handled each SAR individually (e. g., the data
is pulled from a database by the DPO). Responses show that overall
fewer individuals than expected requested access. 12 participants
stated that they received the expected amount and ten stated that
they got “less” (4) or “way less” (6) than expected (one company
preferred not to disclose). One interview partner (I-7) reported
that they and other companies had expected “a five-digit figure of
requests per month”, but over the whole year, they had received less
than ten access requests. Consequently, half of the companies (12)
do not consider changing how they handle access requests; only six
of the participants reported that they were planning to change the
process. Based on our data, there is no indication that companies
that offer online tools receive more SARs than companies that
only provide an offline tool. However, only one company stated
that they monitor the number of requests they receive via their
online platform. The remaining interviewees said they would like
to change the process or reported that it had already been changed.
Regarding guidelines, 15 companies stated that they preferred
more unified guidelines about how access requests should be han-
dled. When asked who should provide this guidance, nine partic-
ipants would prefer self-regulation (e. g., by the IAB), ten norma-
tive guidance (e. g., ISO standard), and three legislative guidance
(e. g., amendments of the GDPR). These rather high numbers are
likely related to the uncertainties that come with the new legislation.
In the interviews especially representatives from smaller compa-
nies said they had a hard time defining processes they thought
would comply with the new legislation. Thus, the desire for more
regulation or guidelines could be a result of frustration companies
faced when trying to comply with such complex regulations.
Challenges. In the online survey, we asked participants about the
challenges for transparency and access requests. The answers to
the questions can be grouped into two categories: (1) identification
of users and (2) uncertainty about data flows. One of the main
challenges for companies is to decide what level of identification
is required before answering access requests. One the one hand, it
is necessary to make sure that access is only granted to the actual
individual whose data is stored. On the other hand, “authentication
of individuals creates more sensitive data” (P-16).
The challenge of identification was also highlighted during the
interviews. All but one of the participants agreed that identification
is problematic since a cookie ID is not really sufficient to identify a
person. One company stated that they were not concerned about
cookie ID misuse, and all other companies implement the process
differently, ranging from signed affidavits to screenshots of browser
cookie stores. In terms of provided data, all companies claimed that
they provide all data upon request—showing the clear discrepancy
between user perception, our measurements, and company claims.
The second challenge is related to the ad ecosystem that depends
on data exchange between companies. To provide access to data,
services have to “understand the data flow of each partner [they]
work with” (P-13). While some companies most likely created a
record of processing activities as required by the GDPR, one of the
interview partners claimed that not all are aware of all data flows:
“[...] one of the reasons is technical, because I’m quite sure that they
do not know how much data they have. I’m positive on this.” (I-1).
Opinions. In the last part of the survey as well as in the inter-
views, participants were asked about their personal opinion regard-
ing the GDPR and new transparency rights. They assessed that the
GDPR brought more attention to privacy in terms of management,
mostly because of the high fines, but also because of public aware-
ness. Therefore, all agreed that privacy has become more integrated
into daily practices. If participants had an opinion on why users
have such a bad view of ad-tech companies, they said that the main
reason was the general negative attitude towards advertisements
and/or data leaks, in general, was the main reason for that. One
participant was puzzled by our finding that 65 % of users believe
that companies do not share all data upon request and stated that
from his/her point of view this was not correct.
Regarding transparency, all participants agreed that this was a
positive development but added that the current systems provides
only a few benefits to users and is quite impractical in practice.
As I-3 put it, “it’s not useless, but users—and that’s why they are
not contacting us—that do not want to be tracked already have an
app [to block tracking]”, while other stated that SARs and privacy
policies are “sufficient” (I-1) measures. At the end of the interviews,
we asked what the interviewees thought would help to bring more
transparency to the online ad industry. Three interview participants
described a system that would give users high-level information
about types of data collected and summarized similarly to credit
scores, while still offering the technical data to those who are in-
terested. Furthermore, two partners highlighted that transparency
needs to be addressed when the data is collected or shared and that
SARs do not help with that. Another idea was to add standardized
‘traffic sign’ like symbols to websites, ad banners, or cookie banners
that easily describe which data is collected and for what purpose.
When asked why the provided data is often formatted in non-usable
ways, partners named different reasons like the data would “become
stultified” (I-1) if raw data was formatted in a (standardized) way.
One participant said that they could not do that because then they
would become a data processor and not only a “data collector” (I-5).
Another participant was surprised that not all companies provided
inferred data like segments: “Then you have been given an incom-
plete dataset because that’s the only way that it actually works well
for an ad company is to have a better understanding of what your
preferences are. So I think then it’s time for a complaint.” (I-6).
Summary. Our study of the company perspective on data trans-
parency did not reveal a consensus across topics. While some would
711prefer more detailed guidelines, others think the current implemen-
