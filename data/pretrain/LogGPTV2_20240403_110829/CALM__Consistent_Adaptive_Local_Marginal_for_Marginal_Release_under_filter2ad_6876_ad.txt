A SUPPLEMENTARY METHOD
DESCRIPTIONS
into an integer, where b(v) = d
A.1 Details of FT
Define b(·) as the function that transforms a d-dimensional value v
i =1 2d −i · vai . The Fourier transfor-
mation aims to project eb(v ), the standard basis of b(v), onto the
Fourier basis. Specifically, denote all the Fourier basis as a 2d × 2d
matrix Ω = {ωi j }, where ωi j = 2−d /2(−1) ⟨i |j ⟩, and ⟨i |j⟩ is the
inner product of i and j in their binary representations. Each user
j reports one bit of the local coefficient (Ωeb(v j )) at location i, us-
ing randomized response. By aggregating all users’ reports into the
noisy Fourier coefficients θ, the aggregator in fact is estimation
Ω · F, where F is the full contingency table. The marginal tables can
then be calculated from θ:
TA(v) = α ∈V[d ],α[d ]\A =0
θb(α ) · (cid:18) η ∈V[d ],ηA =vA
ωb(α ),b(η)(cid:19)
(9)
Note that in the formula above, fixing α, for any η, ωb(α ),b(η) is the
same. This is because α fixes the bits in positions not contained in
A to be all zeros, while η enumerates all of these bits. As a result,
to calculate Equation (9), one only needs to enumerate all α’s.
The advantages of this method lies in that it only needs to access
j =0 (cid:0)d
k
j(cid:1) Fourier coefficients. For variance, each coefficient is mul-
tiplied by 2−d /2 · 2d /2−k . Moreover, each TA(v) is the summation
of 2k coefficients.
A.2 Details of EM
For any k-way marginal Ai , it can be estimated via the following
formula:
TAi (v) =
C(v) −A ⊂Ai hTA(v)q |Ai |− |A |(p − q) |A |i
(p − q) |Ai |
=vAi
n
where C(v) denotes the fraction of users that has value v, i.e., C(v) =
j:y j
Ai
. Note that to calculate TAi , one should get TA for all
A ⊂ Ai first. The base case is T∅ = 1. The results are then used as
the initial values of the EM algorithm, i.e., Pr [v]0 = TAi (v).
The EM algorithm has two parts, the E step and the M step. In
the E step, the likelihood is computed as
Pr (cid:2)v |y j(cid:3) t
=
Pr [v]t · Pr (cid:2)y j |v(cid:3)
v Pr [v]t · Pr (cid:2)y j |v(cid:3)
,
where Pr [v]t denote the probability for v in round t, and Pr [v]0 is
initialized to 1
|VA | . Then Pr [v]t is updated in the M step,
Pr [v]t +1 =
1
n
n
j =1
Pr (cid:2)v |y j(cid:3) t
until maxv |Pr [v]t +1 − Pr [v]t | ≤ δ for some δ > 0. This procedure
eventually converges to the local maximum of the log-likelihood
function.
A.3 Other Details of PriView
We provide the remaining consistency and reconstruction steps for
the PriView method. Note that these steps are also used in CALM.
Overall Consistency. We can conduct the following procedure
to achieve overall consistency. First, enumerate all the subsets of
A. These subsets form a partial order under the subset relation,
which can be organized as a topological graph. This topological
graph starts from the empty set. Then, for each subset of A in the
topological order, we ensure the consistency among the marginals
that include this subset. It is shown in [29] that following the topo-
logical order, a later consistency step will not invalidate consistency
established in previous steps.
Non-Negativity through Ripple. We propose to adopt the fol-
lowing łRipplež non-negativity method, which turns negative
