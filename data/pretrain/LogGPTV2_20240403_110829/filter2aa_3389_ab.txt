### Professional Life and Scientific Curiosity

The initial chapters of the memoir establish that Peter Sturrock was indeed mentored and respected by renowned conventional scientists. These mentors, among the best in his field, guided him into research in astrophysics and physics in both Europe and the United States. This journey resulted in numerous publications and a distinguished career at Stanford University, one of the world's most prestigious academic institutions.

### The "Other" Career: A Dissident Scientist

After setting this framework, Sturrock delves into his "other" career as a dissident scientist. In other words, he is a man driven by curiosity, finding the universe, as Alice might say, "curiouser and curiouser."

It may seem simple to assert that the scientific mind is inherently curious. However, Sturrock often encountered a lack of this core attribute, which he considers the cornerstone of intelligence. He was frustrated by the absence of willingness to explore beyond the comfort zone, a frustration that surfaces in many of his anecdotes. Many of his colleagues were constrained by a culture of caution and fear, wary of being labeled heretics or losing their professional benefits.

### Research Interests and Cautious Approach

In addition to UFO phenomena, Sturrock discusses possible instances of the paranormal, spontaneous healing, and reincarnation. UFO phenomena, however, remain at the forefront of his research. He has explored case histories, summarized physical and psychological effects, and examined phenomena that seem to violate known laws of physics. Throughout his work, Sturrock has been appropriately cautious in public pronouncements, mindful of potential pitfalls. He generally avoids discussing personal reactions to his work, such as the near-terror of SETI researchers who feared he might advance the UFO point of view at a conference on extraterrestrial life, potentially embarrassing them.

### Cultural Influence and English Upbringing

Sturrock's English upbringing may have influenced some of his attitudes and interests. Based on my experiences living in England as a young man, I offer these speculations:

1. **Understatement and Intensity**: In England, loud expressions of enthusiasm are often frowned upon. For example, when Sesame Street was introduced to English television audiences, a friend preferred a program where children sat quietly while a teacher read a story. An Englishman, feeling strongly about something, might say "um" rather than "oh boy gee whiz wow!" This understatement underscores the intensity of feeling, a characteristic that is evident in Sturrock's careful and measured approach to his work.

2. **Eccentricity and Anomalies**: England has a tradition of respecting the eccentric and the anomalous, with efforts to reconcile the known and the unknown. The Society for Psychical Research, for instance, included psychologists like Frederick W. H. Myers, philosophers like William James, and physicists like Oliver Lodge. They conducted serious, thoughtful investigations into mediums, spirits, and spontaneous manifestations. Sturrock is part of this tradition, knowing that wise, distinguished men did not reject subjects a priori but peered into the shadows on the edges of experience.

### Credibility and Skepticism

A few years ago, I reviewed Jonathan Moreno’s “Mind Wars,” an investigation by a neuroscientist and bioethicist. Like Sturrock, Moreno repeatedly emphasized his conventional credentials to assure a skeptical audience that he was not a "conspiracy theorist" or a nut-case but a legitimate, credentialed academic. Moreno worked with intelligence professionals and wrote openly about national security and secrecy issues. He noted that scientists often "clammed up" when asked about their research, fearing to speak for the record. While Sturrock does not dwell on this aspect, it is present in the background. Sociological and cultural norms for conformity, along with the compelling nature of the data, contribute to the elusiveness of anomalies. The national security state since World War II adds to the cognitive dissonance in our quest for understanding.

### Anomalies and Their Elusiveness

An anomaly, by definition, does not connect with other known facts. It hangs in the air, tantalizing but out of reach. This characteristic also afflicts the fruits of research into anomalies. For example, the Pocantico Conference, which involved distinguished scientists contradicting the Condon Report, the last known "official" government paper on UFOs, made recommendations but led to no significant follow-up. Similarly, the work done by the French GEPAN/SEPRA remains largely unknown. The Society for Scientific Exploration, which Sturrock helped found, and its publication, The Journal of Scientific Exploration, have produced important work but remain on the periphery of mainstream thought.

### The Promise and Fear

The promise of this thoughtful and intriguing memoir is that it will help to wear away the resistant rock of reality. The fear is that it will be dismissed as a quirky look into weird, new-agey experiences, irrelevant to the highways of career science. The counter-cultural view is that if something exists, it is worthy of being understood. And so is Peter Sturrock.

### About the Author

Richard Thieme is a writer and professional speaker focused on the deeper implications of technology, religion, and science for 21st-century life. He has spoken to audiences from Berlin to Brisbane on topics such as identity, creativity, security, and "UFOlogy 101." His articles, translated into multiple languages, are taught at universities worldwide and frequently anthologized. His column, "Islands in the Clickstream," was published in various international cities and distributed to thousands of subscribers before being collected into a book by Syngress Publishing, a division of Elsevier, in 2004.
