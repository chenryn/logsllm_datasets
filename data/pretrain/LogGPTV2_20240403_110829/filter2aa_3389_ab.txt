professional life.  Those chapters establish that Sturrock was indeed mentored and
respected by conventional scientists of some renown, that some of the best people in his
field led him into research in Europe and the United States in astrophysics and physics
that resulted in numerous papers and a long distinguished career at Stanford University,
one of the most respected academic environments in the world. 
Then, having hung that framework like a curtain, Sturrock discusses his “other” career as
a dissident scientist. A man, in other words, who was curious and found the universe, as
Alice said, even “curiouser and curiouser.” 
It sounds simple, doesn’t it? That the scientific mind is curious?  Yet again and again,
Sturrock was frustrated by the absence of this core attribute, arguably the cornerstone of
intelligence, the willingness to poke one’s whiskers out beyond the door of one’s snug
abode and sniff the air;  that frustration comes to the surface in anecdote after anecdote.
So many colleagues were tamed and constrained by a culture of caution and hesitancy, a
fear of being branded a heretic, a terror, after all, of losing one’s benefits. 
In addition to UFO phenomena, Sturrock discusses possible instances of the paranormal,
spontaneous healing, and reincarnation.  But UFO phenomena is in the foreground of his
research. In the past he has discussed case histories, summaries of physical and
psychological effects, and phenomena which seems to violate known laws of physics. He
has always been appropriately cautious in public pronouncements, mindful of mine
fields, tiptoeing with care.  He has generally avoided mention of personal reactions to his
work, such as the near-terror of SETI researchers, for example, who thought he was
attending a conference on extraterrestrial life and might advance the UFO point of view
to their embarrassment. (My experience interviewing Frank Drake and Jill Tarter echoed
Sturrock’s. The economic and political requirements of SETI, fighting for several
hundred million dollars in endowment funds against a strong political headwind,
necessitated, Tarter told me, a strict divorce of their project from “bad science,” defined
as anything that might taint their efforts. She used her own mistaken identification of the
moon as a UFO during an airplane ride as an example of why all UFO reports must be
something similar. When I observed that this was not scientific, she did not respond. I
recall feeling - as Sturrock often did - taken aback by the lack of a scientific attitude on
the part of a well-known scientist.)
In all of his multiple pursuits, it is possible – not certain – that Sturrock’s English
upbringing influenced some of his attitudes and interests. Based on my experiences while
living in England as a young man, I offer these speculations.
First, I learned in England that loud expressions of enthusiasm are often frowned on. I
recall that when Sesame Street was introduced to English television audiences, for
example, a friend said a much better program was the one in which children sat quietly
on the floor while a teacher read a story. When an Englishman felt strongly about
something, he was more inclined  to say “um” quietly instead of “oh boy gee whiz wow!”
This is relevant because this is a review of a memoir, not a scientific paper. It underscores
the habitual understatement which for an Englishman born and bred reveals rather than
contradicts intensity of feeling. If an exuberant American extrovert like myself were to
write this account, it might say: Please, people! this is DATA! this is observable,
frequently reported data! and it challenges the way we believe the universe works! Let’s
THINK about it, shall we? 
But Sturrock is English, and always, his conclusions and proposals are those of a careful
scientist. He insists on using Bayes’ Theorem as a touchstone for a sane way to proceed
in every investigation, he never goes beyond the data itself, and he restricts the
presentation of data to documented events.
Here’s a second hunch about “things English:” in addition to advances that created
modern scientific thinking beginning with the Royal Society, there has been regard in
England for the eccentric, the anomalous, the struggle to reconcile the known and the
unknown into one big picture. The work of the Society for Psychical Research at the turn
of the twentieth century included psychologists like Frederick W. H. Myers, philosophers
like William James, politicians like Lord Balfour, physicists like Oliver Lodge, and
serious, thoughtful investigation of mediums, spirits, spontaneous manifestations of
apparitions at a time of crisis, the survival of bodily death, and the like. My hunch is
simply that Sturrock is part of that tradition too. He knew that wise distinguished men did
not reject a subject a priori but peered into the shadows on the edges of experience. He
knew that Conan Doyle and Williams Butler Yates evangelized for the existence of
faeries. That framework is part of the heritage of a man who suggests that when we turn
around and look at the world, we transit a full 360 degrees before coming home again,
knowing that when we do, the self at which we arrive will not be the self which departed
on that journey. 
A few years ago, I reviewed Jonathan Moreno’s “Mind Wars,” an investigation by a
neuroscientist and bioethicist with good credentials. Moreno investigated research based
on biology and neuroscience for warfare and “perception management.” Like Sturrock,
Moreno advanced conventional credentials again and again, recounting his work with
intelligence agencies, for example, so he could insist to a skeptical audience that he was
not “a conspiracy theorist” or a nut-case but a legitimate credentialed academic. 
Moreno worked with intelligence professionals and wrote openly about national security
and secrecy issues. He told me scientists often “clammed up” when he asked about their
research, that they dared not say a word for the record. Sturrock does not dwell on that
aspect of research into anomalous phenomena but it is there nevertheless. Not only do
sociological and cultural molds for conformity mold the clay of scientific research, but
precisely because the data is compelling, precisely because it would have attracted
attention, and research, and dollars in the past, whatever might have been discussed
behind closed doors is beyond our reach. Life in the national security state since World
War 2 adds even greater cognitive dissonance to our quest for understanding. It is not
only the universe that plays dice with us but, closer to home, it is likely that some in
positions of authority do too. No wonder we feel so often we are looking into a fun-house
mirror when we try to connect the dots. The elusiveness of anomalies is further distorted
by the fact that we don’t and can’t know what we don’t know ... about who does know
more about them.  
It is a characteristic of an anomaly that it does not connect with other known facts. It
hangs in the air like the grin of a Cheshire cat, tantalizing but out of reach. That
characteristic also afflicts the fruits of research into anomalies. The Pocantico
Conference, for example, resulted in distinguished scientists contradicting the Condon
Report, the last known “official” Government paper on UFOs,  and made
recommendations, and then ... nothing. The investigation of anomalies became, itself,
anomalous. Sturrock also cites GEPAN/SEPRA as one model for investigation of UFO
events, so one might expect the work done by the French to be on our radar, but ... it
remains anomalous, too. A society which Sturrock helped to found – The Society for
Scientific Exploration –an attempt to bridge the two worlds – and its publication, The
Journal of Scientific Exploration, have also resulted in important work but ... the society,
the journal, remain in limbo, a bit off the beaten path, interesting to some, but anomalous.
For the moment, those efforts are here and not here at the same time, lacking integration
into mainstream thought. They accumulate but remain liminal to the primary concerns of
establishment scientists, mainstream media, and 21st century consensus reality.
The promise of this thoughtful, so-interesting memoir is that one more drip in a sequence
of drips on the rocks of reality will help to wear away the resistant rock. The fear is that
this work too will be dismissed as a quirky look into weird, new-agey experiences, an
off-road trip irrelevant to the highways of career science. 
The counter-cultural view? If it exists, it is worthy of being understood. 
And so is Peter Sturrock.
