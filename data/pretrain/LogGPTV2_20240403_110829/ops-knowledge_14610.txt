User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题snort-mysql not starting on Ubuntu server I am following this tutorial: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SnortIDS

I've set up the database, everything has installed correctly, and I've configured the snort.conf file so it outputs to a database (with creds all filled out ok).

When I run /etc/init.d/snort start, it fails but does not produce any error message other than [fail].

The last few lines of /var/log/syslog are:

snort[5687]: database: must enter database name in configuration file#012
snort[5687]: FATAL ERROR:


My output database line in the snort.conf file is:

output database: log, mysql, user=snort password=... dbname=snort host=localhost


I have tried it with the commas separating everything, putting quotes around stuff, etc. The password is only made up of letters (after I thought maybe a number was throwing it off).

Assistant: [parameter list]
  
  The parameter list consists of key value pairs (See Table 4). The
  syntax of the parameter list is a series of key=value pairs each
  separated by a space.
  
  The only parameter that is absolutely necessary is dbname. All other
  parameters are optional but may be necessary depending on the RDBMS
  configuration.


Move dbname to be the first parameter to see what happens:

output database: log, mysql, dbname=snort user=snort host=localhost password=...
