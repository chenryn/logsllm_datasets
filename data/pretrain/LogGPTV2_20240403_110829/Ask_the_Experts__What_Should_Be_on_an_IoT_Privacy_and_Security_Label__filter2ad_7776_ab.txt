### User Experience (UX) Expert Recruitment and Delphi Method Application

#### 1. Expert Recruitment
We recruited experts with whom the authors had professional interactions or who were recommended by other experts. The selection process was rigorous, ensuring that all chosen experts were well-recognized in their respective fields. Specifically, we sought experts meeting at least one of the following criteria:
- Computer science or engineering professor in the field of security.
- More than 10 years of research or practice in privacy and security.
- Author of notable books on privacy and security.
- Active involvement in cybersecurity standardization.
- Leading a corporate IoT product team.

Seven experts met two or more of these criteria. After identifying qualified experts, we invited them to participate in either an in-person interview at our institution or an online interview via Skype. All interviews were audio recorded and transcribed by a third-party service. Each expert received a $25 Amazon gift card as compensation.

#### 2. Delphi Method
The Delphi method, as defined by Delbecq et al., is "a method for the systematic solicitation and collection of judgments on a particular topic through a set of carefully designed sequential questionnaires interspersed with summarized information and feedback of opinions derived from earlier responses." This qualitative research method, developed by Dalkey and Helmer in the 1950s, is widely used to reach consensus among a group of experts without face-to-face interactions. It has been applied in various fields, including policy design, social science, and human-computer interaction.

The Delphi method has three key features:
- **Anonymized Responses and Interactions:** Feedback and responses are anonymized to ensure unbiased input.
- **Multiple Rounds of Data Collection:** The process involves several rounds of data collection, such as interviews and surveys.
- **Feedback Loop:** In each round, the summary of the previous round is shared with experts to facilitate consensus. Typically, consensus is reached after three iterations.

#### 3. Expert Interviews
The first phase of the Delphi method involved semi-structured interviews with privacy and security experts. We introduced the concept of a privacy and security label for IoT devices, drawing parallels with food nutrition labels. Experts were asked to define privacy and security in the context of IoT devices and to suggest content for the label. For each suggested piece of information, they were asked to consider its relevance to both consumers and experts. We compiled a list of factors, which was iteratively updated and reviewed by each expert (see Figure 5).

#### 4. First Round Survey
Based on the expert interviews, we created an extensive list of privacy, security, and general factors. We then conducted a survey to understand the rationale behind their preferences (see Figure 6). To reduce fatigue, each expert was presented with one-third of the factors, with the order randomized. We explained the concept of a layered IoT label, where the primary layer contains the most critical information, and the secondary layer provides additional details. For each factor, experts were asked to indicate its importance and provide supporting reasons.

#### 5. Second Round Survey
To achieve consensus on the inclusion and exclusion of factors, we conducted a second survey (see Figure 7). We outlined two key objectives: informing consumers and holding companies accountable for their privacy and security practices. Participants answered questions for one-third of the factors, randomly selected from the three categories—security, privacy, and general. On a five-point Likert scale, experts decided whether each factor should be included and provided their rationale. They also specified the layer and category for each factor and offered additional comments.

#### 6. Data Analysis
We collected approximately 22 hours of interview audio recordings and used thematic analysis to summarize the transcripts, following Braun and Clarke's approach:
- **Phase 1:** A primary coder read the transcripts and took notes, referring to audio files as needed.
- **Phase 2:** The primary coder created an initial codebook, focusing on reasons for and against including factors.
- **Phase 3:** Smaller codes were merged into broader themes.
- **Phase 4:** Themes were reviewed and discussed by the authors to resolve disagreements.
- **Phase 5:** Finalized themes were moved into the final codebook.

We reached saturation after interviewing 20 experts, with no new factors mentioned in subsequent interviews or surveys. Thematic analysis is qualitative and inductive, and we improved reliability through iterative discussions and expert consultations.

### Semi-Structured Interviews with Non-Expert Consumers

#### 1. Participant Recruitment and Compensation
We recruited 15 non-expert consumers through Craigslist, Reddit, and our institution’s recruitment website. Participants were required to be at least 18 years old and have purchased at least one smart home or personal device. They completed a screening survey, and qualified participants were invited to a 1-hour interview, receiving a $25 Amazon gift card.

#### 2. Initial Questions
Participants were shown a box for a hypothetical security camera without a label and asked about their perceptions of the device's privacy and security. They were then shown a labeled box and asked to interpret the label and assess the risk.

#### 3. Risk Communication in Comparative Purchase Process
Participants compared two labeled security cameras with different privacy and security information, discussing which they would purchase and the factors influencing their decision. We introduced the secondary layer of the label and asked for their thoughts on one-layer and two-layer labels.

#### 4. Information Comprehension in Non-Comparative Purchase Process
Participants examined the label of the product they decided not to purchase, discussing their concerns and understanding of the information.

#### 5. Risk Communication in Non-Comparative Purchase Process
Participants identified risky factors and discussed potential risks and improvements.

#### 6. Secondary-Layer Information Comprehension
Participants were asked about their preference for accessing the secondary layer (QR code or URL) and provided feedback on the information.

#### 7. Label Format
Participants gave feedback on the label format, including the separation of factors into privacy, security, and general sections, and suggested improvements.

#### 8. Purchase Behavior
We asked about participants' online and in-store shopping behaviors.

#### 9. Data Analysis
We collected about 15 hours of audio recordings, which were transcribed. The primary coder created and updated the codebook using structural coding, appropriate for semi-structured interviews. Two researchers independently coded each interview, achieving a Cohen’s Kappa inter-coder agreement of 84%, considered "excellent."

### Ethics
Both expert and consumer studies were reviewed and approved by our Institutional Review Board (IRB). All participants provided informed consent for participation, audio recording, and transcription by a third-party service.

### Limitations
Expert elicitation can be prone to overconfidence and cognitive biases. To mitigate this, we presented strong arguments for and against each factor in the second survey. The experts interviewed may not represent the entire population of privacy and security experts, but we aimed to include a diverse range of viewpoints.
