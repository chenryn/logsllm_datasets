User: I am programming a django based website. I actually use a small computer under Ubuntu 10.04.
I would like to buy something more professional, so I am wondering whether an iMac is good for that, because :

Is there a free IDE as good as eclipse on MacOS ?
Is there a remote python debugger like pydev for eclipse ?
Is there some typical issues with python on MacOS ?
does apache+mod_wsgi works well on MacOS ?
Assistant: FWIW, mod_wsgi is developed on MacOS X. My experience in supporting users of mod_wsgi is however that MacPorts and fink are an absolute PITA. Specifically, trying to use Python and Apache from those third party systems usually causes nothing but hurt. This is based on problems encountered over the last couple of years. I haven't heard much lately though, so it may be the case that those systems have finally fixed up their 32/64 bit issues and Python build problems.
