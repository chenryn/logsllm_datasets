User: Please provide a NGINX-based load balancer deployment solution
Assistant: The NGINX-based load balancer deployment scheme is as follows: 1. Install NGINX: Install NGINX on the load-balanced machine. The specific operation can be performed through the following command: sudo apt-get install nginx 2. Edit the NGINX configuration file: Open the main configuration file of NGINX "/etc/nginx/nginx.conf", and add the following content to configure the load balancing service: http { upstream backend { server backend1.example.com weight=5; server backend2.example.com; server backend3.example.com; } server { listen 80; location / { proxy_pass http://backend; } } } In the above configuration, the "upstream" block defines a cluster named "backend", which contains three servers "backend1.example.com ”, “backend2.example.com”, and “backend3.example.com”, and the server “backend1.example.com” has a weight of 5. Additionally, the "server" block defines how the cluster is used: any HTTP request to this load balancer will be proxied to a server in the cluster. 3. Test: Restart NGINX so that it loads the new configuration and sends HTTP requests to the load balancer to ensure they have been properly forwarded to the backend servers. sudo service nginx restart In short, the NGINX-based load balancer deployment scheme is relatively simple, and can expand the performance and reliability of web applications very quickly, so that clients can get responses faster and reduce failure rates.
