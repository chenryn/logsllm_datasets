### `qwinsta` Command

**Applies to:**
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
The `qwinsta` command displays information about sessions on a Remote Desktop Session Host (RDSH) server. This includes both active and other sessions that the server is running.

**Note:**
- The `qwinsta` command is equivalent to the `query session` command.
- For information on new features in the latest version, refer to "What's New in Remote Desktop Services in Windows Server."

**Syntax:**
```shell
qwinsta [sessionName | userName | sessionId] [/server:<serverName>] [/mode] [/flow] [/connect] [/counter] [/?]
```

**Parameters:**

- **sessionName**: Specifies the name of the session you want to query.
- **userName**: Specifies the name of the user whose sessions you want to query.
- **sessionId**: Specifies the ID of the session you want to query.
- **/server:**: Identifies the RDSH server to query. The default is the current server.
- **/mode**: Displays the current line settings.
- **/flow**: Displays the current flow-control settings.
- **/connect**: Displays the current connect settings.
- **/counter**: Displays current counter information, including the total number of sessions created, disconnected, and reconnected.
- **/?**: Displays help at the command prompt.

**Remarks:**
- A user can always query the session to which they are currently logged on. To query other sessions, the user must have special access permissions.
- If no session is specified using the `sessionName`, `userName`, or `sessionId` parameters, the command will display information about all active sessions in the system.
- When `qwinsta` returns information, a greater than (>) symbol is displayed before the current session. For example:
  ```shell
  C:\>qwinsta
      SESSIONNAME     USERNAME        ID  STATE    TYPE    DEVICE
      console         Administrator1  0   active   wdcon
      >rdp-tcp#1      User1           1   active   wdtshare
      rdp-tcp                          2   listen   wdtshare
                                      4   idle
                                      5   idle
  ```

**Examples:**

- To display information about all active sessions on the server `Server2`:
  ```shell
  qwinsta /server:Server2
  ```

- To display information about the active session `modeM02`:
  ```shell
  qwinsta modeM02
  ```

This command is useful for administrators who need to monitor and manage RDSH sessions on their servers.
