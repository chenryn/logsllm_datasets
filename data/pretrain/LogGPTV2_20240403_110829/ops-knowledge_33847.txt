User: i have no way of upgrade to python 2.7 or 3.1 so i am stuck with python 2.6 on my ubuntu 10.04 machine.
will i still be able to find host that supports  python 2.6?
is using python 2.6 still consider outdated or bad practice?
Assistant: 2.6 will be around for a long time. There are many machines that still run even 2.4, so you're fine.
