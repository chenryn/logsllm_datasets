    Consider this playground program:
    http://play.golang.org/p/0uxQi6r0y7
    It does not, of course, produce 2 billion lines of output. At some point the output is
    truncated and the program terminated for producing too much output. In my test, the
    response JSON object had 43887 elements in the "Events" array.
    The javascript running on the page, though, crashes after printing only part of the
    response. In my test, it printed 7948 "asdf"s before crashing with
    "Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded". The JS stack trace
    indicates a recursive function 'next' at playground.js:59.
    Additionally, my browser pegs one core for about 20 seconds while producing even this
    much output.
    I suggest that the limit on output size be truncated more aggressively or the javascript
    be made more efficient.
