Please refer to the example at [http://jsbin.com/taxat/1](http://jsbin.com/taxat/1).

**Environment:**
- **Operating System:** MacOS 10.8.5
- **Browsers Tested:**
  - Firefox 26
  - Chrome 32

**Observations:**

1. **Using `XS and SM - via hidden`:**
   - The content is correctly displayed in both `xs` (extra small) and `sm` (small) screen resolutions.

2. **Using `XS and SM - via visible`:**
   - The content is only displayed in the `sm` resolution.
   - **Expected Behavior:** The content should also be displayed in the `xs` resolution.
   - **Actual Behavior:** The content is not shown in the `xs` resolution, which is incorrect.

**Conclusion:**
- There appears to be an issue with the visibility settings for the `xs` and `sm` breakpoints when using the `visible` class. This problem may also affect other resolution combinations, and further testing is recommended to confirm this.
