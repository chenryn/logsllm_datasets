Modems, explained    
Modulator / Demodulator
Modulator:  Encodes a digital signal over an analog 
representation
Demodulator:  Reconstructs the digital signal from the 
analog representation
Digital signal rate = bits per second (bps)
Analog "symbol" rate = baud
In many cases, bps != baud
Timeline of Modem History
~1959 "Bell 101" 110 baud standard, Anderson-Jacobson modems introduced for
           private-line use by US Military
       1962  "Bell 103" 300 baud standard, AT&T commercial modems introduced
             ~1963 Livermore Data Systems Model A 
                          1968 "The Carterphone Decision" - allowing third party devices
                                  to be electrically connected to telephone lines* 
                                        1972 Vadic 1200bps modem

That was surprisingly bad-ass.
(Especially the part at the beginning where he ripped off the poor 
grieving little old lady.)

Hi,
I stumbled on your youtube video.  It brought back some interesting memories.
We used that model in about 64 as you surmised.  The big problem was dirty 
lines.  If you got a line that had any noise on it, the modem used to return all 
sorts of Junk.  As we used it to transfer data for computation between 
computers, we often did not know the dirty line existed until results started to 
come out all gobbledygook.  The worst case was when we some how got an infinity 
loop happening in the mainframe and all terminals froze.  Took some time to 
diagnose and rectify!!! :-[

DEMO TIME
or "Shut the hell up
and show us the modem!"
Demonstrating the Model A Modem
Demo 1:  Connecting the modem, modulation, and noise
Demo 2:  Dialing into a system at 300 baud
Demo 3:  Replaying a previously recorded Bell 103 session
  into the modem.
Demo 4: (Hopefully!) Making the modem talk / listen 
    through unusual mediums
            - Cellular phone                    - Walkie Talkies
            - PVC Pipe                            - Room P.A. system?
            - Other?
Thanks for coming!
