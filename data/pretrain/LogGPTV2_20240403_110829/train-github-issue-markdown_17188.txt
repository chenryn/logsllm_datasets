The typescript definition file for the Popover component is missing both the
anchorPosition and anchorReference props added in #9004 . I believe (though
I'm not familiar with Flow) the Flow types are there in the .js component
file.
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
Popover in Typescript projects should be able to have anchorPosition and
anchorReference set.
## Current Behavior
Typescript throws the following errors:
> TS2339: Property 'anchorPosition' does not exist on type
> 'IntrinsicAttributes & PopoverProps & { children?: ReactNode; }'.  
>  TS2339: Property 'anchorReference' does not exist on type
> 'IntrinsicAttributes & PopoverProps & { children?: ReactNode; }'.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. Add anchorPosition and anchorReference to Popover
  2. Compile code with Typescript
