### `sc.exe delete` Command

The `sc.exe delete` command removes a service subkey from the Windows Registry. If the service is currently running or if another process has an open handle to the service, the service will be marked for deletion and removed once it is no longer in use.

**Important Note:**
We strongly advise against using this command to delete built-in operating system services such as DHCP, DNS, or Internet Information Services (IIS). For managing, installing, removing, or reconfiguring operating system roles, services, and components, please refer to the documentation on [Installing or Uninstalling Roles, Role Services, or Features](#).

#### Syntax
```plaintext
sc.exe [\\<RemoteServer>] delete <ServiceName>
```

#### Parameters
- **`\\<RemoteServer>`**: Specifies the name of the remote server where the service is located. The server name must be in Universal Naming Convention (UNC) format (e.g., `\\myserver`). This parameter is not required when running `sc.exe` locally.
- **`<ServiceName>`**: Specifies the name of the service as returned by the `getkeyname` operation.
- **`/?"**: Displays help information for the `sc.exe` command at the command prompt.

#### Examples
To delete the service subkey `NewServ` from the registry on the local computer, use the following command:
```cmd
sc.exe delete NewServ
```

This command will remove the specified service subkey from the registry, provided that the service is not currently in use.
