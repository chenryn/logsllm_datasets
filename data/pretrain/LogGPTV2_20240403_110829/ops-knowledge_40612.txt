User: When I kick off a python script from within another python script using the subprocess module, a zombie process is created when the subprocess "completes". I am unable to kill this subprocess unless I kill my parent python process. 
Is there a way to kill the subprocess without killing the parent? I know I can do this by using wait(), but I need to run my script with no_wait().
Assistant: Like this:
s = Popen(args)
s.terminate()
time.sleep(0.5)
s.poll()
it works
zombie processes will disappear
