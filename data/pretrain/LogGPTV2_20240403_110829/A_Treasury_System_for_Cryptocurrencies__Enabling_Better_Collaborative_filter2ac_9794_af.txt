During the tests many abnormal situations were simulated,
for instance, a malicious behavior of the committee members,
absence of the voters and experts, refusal to participate in
the decryption stage, etc. With a correctly working majority
of the committee members, the voting results were always
successfully obtained and rewards were correctly distributed.
Evaluations. For evaluating performance of the cryptographic
protocols a special set of tests were developed as a part of
the cryptographic library. The working station has Intel Core
i7-6500U CPU @ 2.50GHz and 16GB RAM.
We benchmarked key generation protocol running time for
different number of voting committee members: from 10 to
100 (high numbers might be required to guarantee honest
majority on member random selection among large amount
of members). Shared public key generation was made both for
all honest committee members and in presence of malicious
ones (any minority amount, their exact ratio does not have
inﬂuence on protocol running time for any honest participant).
Results are given in Fig. 10.
Besides, there is an estimated amount of data needed to be
transmitted over a P2P network to complete the protocol, in
dependence of committee size and malicious members ratio.
Results are given in Fig. 11 (recall that even controlling 50% of
the committee, an attacker can break conﬁdentiality of voters’
ballots, but not their integrity or tally result).
Ballot generation is done once by a voter and takes less
than 1 second for several hundreds of experts, so it has little
inﬂuence on the voting protocol performance. To get tally
results, it is needed to collect all ballots from participating
voters, validate their correctness (via attached NIZK) and then
do tally for all correct ballots. Figure 12 shows the prover’s
running time, the veriﬁer’s running time and the size of the
unit vector ZK proof that has been used in the ballot casting.
Finally, the overall communication cost for all the voting
ballots per project during the entire treasury period is depicted
in Fig. 13. In particular, for a treasury period with 5000 voters
and 50 experts, the overall communication is approximately
20 MB per project.
Remark. Note that in practice, the treasury period is long
enough, say, 30 days (approximately 4320 blocks for Bitcoin),
so blockchain space overhead for treasury deployment in the
cryptocurrency blockchain is insigniﬁcant. At the same time,
we consider a sidechain approach [6], [21], [29] for treasury
implementation as an effective solution. It allows separation of
treasury functionality from the mainchain consensus, providing
a number of advantages. In particular, treasury protocols do not
inﬂuence the mainchain consensus, moving all implementation
complexity in a sidechain. This modular construction also
saves mainchain space for core clients.
VIII. RELATED WORK
The Dash governance system (DGS) [17] also referred to
as Dash governance by blockchain (DGBB) is the pioneer trea-
sury implementation for cryptocurrency development funding
on any real-world cryptocurrency. The DGS allows regular
users on the Dash network to participate in the development
process of the Dash cryptocurrency by allowing them sub-
mit project proposals (for advancing the cryptocurrency) to
the network. A subset of users known as Masternodes then
vote to decide what proposals from the submitted proposals
get funding. Every voting cycle (approximately one month),
winning proposals are voted for and funded from the accrued
resources in the blockchain treasury. 10% of all block rewards
within each monthly voting period is contributed towards the
blockchain treasury, from which proposals are then funded.
Although the DGS works in practice, there are open questions
to it. For instance, voting on the DGS is not private, thereby
leaving nodes susceptible to coercion.

Beyond voting, the Dash Governance System (DGS) [17],
[28], is the ﬁrst self-sustenance/funding mechanism in any
cryptocurrency or blockchain system. However, the DGS does
not support delegative voting and ballot privacy.
A second system is the ZenCash (now - Horizen) multi-
stakeholder governance model. By design, it adopts a ﬂexible
multi-stakeholder governance model [39]. The core idea is to
remove centralisation which entrusts enormous powers with
a minority. Participation is voluntary and decision-making
powers cuts across all categories of stakeholders proportional
to their resources(stake).
Initially, the Horizen (ZenCash) system has a Core Team
(inclusive of founders of Zen) and a DAO (consisting of
industry leaders) that controls 3.5% of block mining rewards
and 5% of rewards respectively. The plan is to evolve, de-
velop and adopt a hybrid voting mechanism that enables all
stakeholders to inﬂuence decisions and resource allocations
on the blockchain. This evolution would result in a system
of DAOs, with competing DAOs responsible for working on
different problems. Collectively, the DAOs will be responsible
for activities (building, maintaining, improving software, legal,
marketing, and advertising) that will ensure the long-term
sustainability of Zen.
Community members / stakeholders are allowed to partic-
ipate in the development of Zen via project proposals which
are funded by the DAOs through the 5% block mining reward
allocation they receive. We remark that proposals are only to be
funded subject to successful voting. Although, at launch, only
one DAO “staffed with respected professionals” exists. The
staff strength of each DAO is between 3−5 members and could
potentially be increased to any number. A dispute resolution
mechanism is to be provided for solving issues among DAO
members. Delegative voting is not supported and the system
uses ﬁxed amount of voting tokens.
Liquid democracy (also known as delegative democ-
racy [19]) as an hybrid of direct democracy and representative
democracy provides the beneﬁts of both system (whilst doing
away with their drawbacks) by enabling organisations to take
advantage of the experts in a voting process and also gives
every member the opportunity to vote [41], [42]. Although the
advantages of liquid democracy has been widely discussed in
Fig. 13: The overall communication for all the voting ballots during
an entire treasury period.
the literature [12], [23], [26], [32], [34], there are few provably
secure construction of liquid democracy voting.
Most real-world implementations of liquid democracy only
focus on the functionality aspect of their schemes. For instance,
Google Vote [25] is an internal Google experiment on liquid
democracy over the social media, Google+, which does not
consider voter privacy. Similarly, systems such as proxyfor.me
[36], LiquidFeedback [31], Adhocracy [7], GetOpinionated,
[16] also offer poor privacy guarantees. It is worth mentioning
that Sovereign [37] is a blockchain-based voting protocol for
liquid democracy; therefore, its privacy is inherited from the
underlying blockchain, which provides pseudonymity-based
privacy. Wasa2il [33] is able to achieve end-to-end veriﬁability
because this foils privacy. The best known liquid democracy
and proxy democracy voting schemes are nVotes [35] and
Statement Voting [41], [42]. However, those systems require
mix-nets as their underlying primitive. This makes them less
compatible to the blockchain setting due to the heavy work
load of the mixing servers.
There are a few blockchain based e-voting schemes in the
literature, but most of them, e.g., Agora [8], only use the
blockchain as a realization of the bulletin board. The actual
e-voting schemes are not integrated with the blockchain. [30]
is a proposed blockchain-based voting solution that heavily
relies on an external “trusted third party” between users and the
election authority/authentication authority, in order to ensure
anonymity/privacy of voters. Each candidate is voted for by
having transactions sent
to them. Nonetheless, privacy or
anonymity of voters can be broken by collusion between the
authentication organisation and the trusted third party. [11]
proposes an end-to-end voting system based on Bitcoin that
utilises a Kerberos-based protocol to achieve voter identity
anonymisation. Voting takes place via sending of tokens from
voters to address (public key) of candidates. However, voting
is not private and other voters can be inﬂuenced by the trend or
likelihood of the overall results (before voting is concluded).
Furthermore, the scheme is susceptible to coercion.
Our work differs from these earlier works because it not
only supports liquid democracy whilst preserving privacy of
14
the voters and delegates, it is also practical in the sense that it
considers real-life concerns (e.g., monthly duration of treasury
epoch) associated with a treasury system for blockchains.
IX. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this work, we initiated the study of blockchain treasury
systems for the community to collaboratively collect and
distribute funds in a decentralised manner. We note that the
voting scheme used in the treasury system can be further
improved with game-theoretic approaches to enable better
collaborative decision making. The proposed system can also
be extended to serve blockchain self-governance. Our treasury
system is planned for practical deployment in cryptocurrencies
in 2019. In particular, the treasury model is in the roadmap of
Cardano [3], to be a part of the Voltaire release [4]. Horizen
(formerly ZenCash) also implements DAO Treasury Protocol-
level Voting System [5] based on our scheme.
