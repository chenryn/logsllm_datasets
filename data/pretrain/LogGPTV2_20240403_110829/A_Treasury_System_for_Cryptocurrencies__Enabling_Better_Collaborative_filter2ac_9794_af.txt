### Testing and Evaluation

During the testing phase, various abnormal scenarios were simulated, including malicious behavior by committee members, absence of voters and experts, and refusal to participate in the decryption stage. Despite these challenges, with a correctly functioning majority of committee members, the voting results were consistently obtained, and rewards were accurately distributed.

#### Performance Evaluations

To evaluate the performance of the cryptographic protocols, a specialized set of tests was developed as part of the cryptographic library. The workstation used for these tests was equipped with an Intel Core i7-6500U CPU @ 2.50GHz and 16GB RAM.

We benchmarked the key generation protocol's running time for different numbers of voting committee members, ranging from 10 to 100. Higher numbers may be necessary to ensure an honest majority when members are randomly selected from a large pool. Shared public key generation was tested both in the presence of all honest committee members and with a minority of malicious ones (the exact ratio of malicious members did not affect the protocol's running time for any honest participant). The results are presented in Figure 10.

Additionally, we estimated the amount of data that needs to be transmitted over a P2P network to complete the protocol, considering the size of the committee and the ratio of malicious members. These results are shown in Figure 11. It is worth noting that even if an attacker controls up to 50% of the committee, they can compromise the confidentiality of voters' ballots but not their integrity or the tally result.

Ballot generation, which is performed once by each voter, takes less than one second for several hundred experts, thus having minimal impact on the overall performance of the voting protocol. To obtain the tally results, all ballots from participating voters must be collected, validated (using attached NIZK proofs), and then tallied. Figure 12 illustrates the prover's running time, the verifier's running time, and the size of the unit vector ZK proof used in the ballot casting process.

Finally, the total communication cost for all voting ballots per project during the entire treasury period is depicted in Figure 13. For a treasury period involving 5000 voters and 50 experts, the overall communication is approximately 20 MB per project.

### Remark

In practice, the treasury period is sufficiently long, typically around 30 days (approximately 4320 blocks for Bitcoin), making the blockchain space overhead for treasury deployment insignificant. We also consider a sidechain approach [6], [21], [29] for implementing the treasury, which offers several advantages. This approach allows the separation of treasury functionality from the mainchain consensus, thereby reducing complexity and saving mainchain space for core clients.

### Related Work

The Dash Governance System (DGS) [17], also known as Dash Governance by Blockchain (DGBB), is the pioneering treasury implementation for cryptocurrency development funding. DGS enables regular users on the Dash network to participate in the development process by submitting project proposals. A subset of users, known as Masternodes, vote to decide which proposals receive funding. Every voting cycle (approximately one month), winning proposals are funded from the accrued resources in the blockchain treasury. 10% of all block rewards within each monthly voting period are allocated to the blockchain treasury.

Although the DGS is functional, it has some open questions. For example, voting on the DGS is not private, leaving nodes susceptible to coercion.

Beyond voting, the DGS [17], [28] is the first self-sustenance/funding mechanism in any cryptocurrency or blockchain system. However, it does not support delegative voting and ballot privacy.

Another system is the ZenCash (now Horizen) multi-stakeholder governance model, which adopts a flexible multi-stakeholder governance model [39]. The core idea is to remove centralization and distribute decision-making powers proportionally among all stakeholders based on their resources.

Initially, the Horizen (ZenCash) system has a Core Team (including the founders of Zen) and a DAO (consisting of industry leaders) that control 3.5% and 5% of block mining rewards, respectively. The plan is to evolve and adopt a hybrid voting mechanism that allows all stakeholders to influence decisions and resource allocations on the blockchain. This would result in a system of DAOs, each responsible for different aspects of the blockchain's sustainability.

Community members/stakeholders can participate in the development of Zen via project proposals, which are funded by the DAOs through the 5% block mining reward allocation. Proposals are only funded subject to successful voting. Although, at launch, only one DAO "staffed with respected professionals" exists, the staff strength of each DAO is between 3-5 members and can be increased. A dispute resolution mechanism is provided to address issues among DAO members. Delegative voting is not supported, and the system uses a fixed amount of voting tokens.

Liquid democracy, a hybrid of direct and representative democracy, provides the benefits of both systems while mitigating their drawbacks. It allows organizations to leverage the expertise of members and gives every member the opportunity to vote [41], [42]. Although the advantages of liquid democracy have been widely discussed in the literature [12], [23], [26], [32], [34], there are few provably secure constructions of liquid democracy voting.

Most real-world implementations of liquid democracy focus on functionality rather than privacy. For instance, Google Vote [25] is an internal experiment on liquid democracy over Google+ that does not consider voter privacy. Similarly, systems like proxyfor.me [36], LiquidFeedback [31], Adhocracy [7], GetOpinionated [16], and others offer poor privacy guarantees. Sovereign [37] is a blockchain-based voting protocol for liquid democracy, inheriting its privacy from the underlying blockchain, which provides pseudonymity-based privacy. Wasa2il [33] achieves end-to-end verifiability but at the cost of privacy. The best-known liquid democracy and proxy democracy voting schemes are nVotes [35] and Statement Voting [41], [42], which require mix-nets as their underlying primitive, making them less compatible with the blockchain setting due to the heavy workload of mixing servers.

There are a few blockchain-based e-voting schemes in the literature, but most, such as Agora [8], use the blockchain only as a bulletin board. The actual e-voting schemes are not integrated with the blockchain. [30] proposes a blockchain-based voting solution that heavily relies on an external "trusted third party" to ensure voter anonymity/privacy. Each candidate is voted for by having transactions sent to them. However, privacy or anonymity can be broken by collusion between the authentication organization and the trusted third party. [11] proposes an end-to-end voting system based on Bitcoin that utilizes a Kerberos-based protocol to achieve voter identity anonymization. Voting takes place via sending tokens from voters to the candidates' addresses. However, voting is not private, and other voters can be influenced by the trend or likelihood of the overall results before voting concludes. Furthermore, the scheme is susceptible to coercion.

Our work differs from these earlier works because it supports liquid democracy while preserving the privacy of voters and delegates. It is also practical, considering real-life concerns such as the monthly duration of the treasury epoch associated with a blockchain treasury system.

### Conclusion and Future Work

In this work, we initiated the study of blockchain treasury systems for the community to collaboratively collect and distribute funds in a decentralized manner. We note that the voting scheme used in the treasury system can be further improved with game-theoretic approaches to enable better collaborative decision-making. The proposed system can also be extended to serve blockchain self-governance. Our treasury system is planned for practical deployment in cryptocurrencies in 2019. Specifically, the treasury model is part of the roadmap for Cardano [3], to be included in the Voltaire release [4]. Horizen (formerly ZenCash) also implements a DAO Treasury Protocol-level Voting System [5] based on our scheme.
