“The victims may be aware that something is wrong on
[their] phone, but cannot really describe what the issue
is about . . . or maybe [they] describe it [on] a high level.”
(S10, director)
As one solution, a practitioner proposed using probing ques-
tions to conﬁrm the customer’s “survivor” identity. However,
we caution that such questions, especially those on the history
of abuse, might unintentionally re-traumatize the customer,
and differ from IPV professionals’ suggestion to consider
additional risks and attack vectors rather than to verify the
IPV situation:
“We do some veriﬁcation for customer contacts . . . where
we collect basic information like name, email, address
. . . But I don’t know, it’s not foolproof to see if they were
actually victims of abuse. Or by giving them some open
questions like, how were they victimized? Having them
quote some examples that can give us a sense?” (S2,
engineering & support liaison)
Complexities of tech-enabled IPV. Practitioners discussed
the socio-technical challenges in IPV and the resulting prob-
lems for support agents. All groups mentioned the dual-use
nature of many apps used by abusers [10] as a challenge. A
director described training agents to watch out for dual-use
apps:
“Sometimes [agents] have to make some additional
changes to . . . our software to categorize those types of
gray applications as malicious so that it can be removed.
Our agents are trained on that so that’s probably one of
the ﬁrst things they would do.” (S6, director)
Another director considered the possibility that the abuser
might be monitoring the conversation, and simply removing
the stalkerware might put the survivor at further risk:
“Just to say, ‘Hey, your device is infected’ and remove the
stalkerware typically means a risk for the victim . . . We
don’t see [an] ideal way of communication if we identify
stalkerware on a device, because the victim most likely
gets observed on all channels . . . If we shot them an email
to their Google account . . . the attacker can see this com-
munication. Just removing without notiﬁcation, a victim
could also be at risk because the attacker assumes that
the victim is aware.” (S10, director)
Frontline agents have limited capacity. On top of chal-
lenges in identifying and addressing tech-enabled IPV, two
groups pointed out that support agents already work hard and
have little time or capacity to take on new and complex tasks.
S7, a manager, described frontline agents as “the Cinderella
of companies” with the lowest pay but the expectation of do-
ing a perfect job. In response to IPV professionals’ suggestion
that agents mention possible consequences of given advice,
S8 was concerned that there may be too many consequences
for frontline agents to foresee, pointing to the importance of
external referrals for safety planning:
“My answer is trust the National Domestic Violence Hot-
line. Call them from a safe device. But that’s it. There
really isn’t a one-size-ﬁts-all answer on this. [Safety plan-
ning] is something that takes more than a couple of min-
utes . . . I could not see that happening in under an hour.”

6 Discussion
Our ﬁndings show that support agents already encounter cases
of tech-enabled IPV. There are many ways customer support
could help survivors and challenges to them playing this role.
We now note limitations of our work, reconcile perspectives
between the two sets of focus groups, and discuss areas com-
puter security companies can explore to improve their cus-
tomer support for IPV survivors.
Limitations. Our research has several limitations. Our sam-
ple sizes were on the lower end for focus group studies [55].
Both groups were hard-to-recruit populations due to their
specialities and limited time; customer support practitioners’
participation further required their companies’ approval. Nev-
ertheless, we believed our recruitment was sufﬁcient, as data
saturation was reached before we stopped data collection.
Our ﬁndings have limitations in terms of generalizability.
While the participating companies are leaders in the consumer
security market globally, the IPV organizations are all based
in US metropolitan areas. We recruited support practitioners
from companies in the Coalition Against Stalkerware [71]
which are already committed to ﬁghting tech-enabled abuse;
other companies who have not expressed such commitment
might be less amenable to adopt our recommendations. Our
focus on computer security companies is warranted, but other
customer-facing domains (e.g., banking and insurance) also
assist IPV survivors in managing consequences of abuse and
could offer targeted assistance. Future research could examine
to what extent our recommendations apply to these domains.
Security software is not a silver bullet. Existing anti-virus
and anti-spyware tools have limitations in detecting dual-use
apps used for intimate partner surveillance [10]. Even with
improved detection algorithms [64], security software cannot
fully protect IPV survivors as they face complex social and le-
gal challenges [27,39]. IPV professionals unanimously agreed
that security software is not a silver bullet for addressing tech-
enabled IPV, and coordination with other stakeholders in the
IPV ecosystem is vital to providing survivors with holistic
support. Some customer support practitioners acknowledged
their products’ limitations and the importance of not over-
promising, but others sought to give customers conﬁdence
in provided solutions or believed that their software would
protect most customers by default. The divergent opinions
between practitioners from different companies reﬂect that a
mentality change in dealing with IPV cases must occur at the
company level — pursuing perfect technical solutions might
be reasonable for general customers, but could be dangerous
and misleading for IPV survivors. Agents should communi-
cate the beneﬁts of a technical solution while acknowledging
that successfully resolving a tech issue at the moment is un-
likely to resolve all of a survivor’s problems.
Provide IPV tech advice with caution & boundaries. IPV
survivors face risks of escalated abuse for even routine
privacy-protective measures like turning off location tracking
or changing passwords [27,28,40]. As such, for any technical
solutions provided, agents should be equipped to recognize
the potential repercussions on survivors and recommend alter-
native solutions that account for an abuser’s potential control
of the survivor’s accounts and devices. As noted by both IPV
professionals and support practitioners, for survivors with
suspected spyware on their phone, agents should highlight
that any activity on the device may be seen by the abuser and
ask the survivor to consider how to proceed instead of simply
removing the spyware.
Furthermore, IPV survivors who contact computer security
customer support likely have a wide range of needs based
on their situation. While prior work has identiﬁed different
phases of IPV [53], our ﬁndings suggest that the advice pro-
vided by support agents can and should be IPV phase-agnostic:
trauma-informed language beneﬁts a survivor before and after
separation as trauma persists, and caution around an abuser’s
potential monitoring or escalated violence is needed in all
phases. Customer support agents should not offer advice that
requires them to know the details of a survivor’s living situ-
ation, contact with the abuser, or plans for leaving. Neither
should support agents ask about these details, as the questions
can be traumatizing and invasive. Instead, support agents
should provide options, highlight risks, and rely on the cus-
tomer to make the safest decision for themselves. Any in-
depth safety planning that helps survivors remain safe in
escaping and requires knowing the phase of IPV should be
handled by IPV professionals via referral. By recognizing
their work’s boundary and facilitating the connection to ex-
ternal resources, support agents increase the chance that a
survivor gets the help they need with precaution.
Make external referrals for safety planning. IPV profes-
sionals and support practitioners both emphasized the im-
portance of external referrals. All companies we spoke with
were already referring customers to certain external resources
such as law enforcement, so the infrastructure and general
procedure for doing this are in place. An immediate next
step is to add domestic violence hotlines, human trafﬁcking
hotlines, suicide helplines, and others to the repertoire of re-
ferred resources. As support practitioners noted, the provided
resources should be up-to-date and geographically relevant.
Even though some regional organizations (e.g., the National
Domestic Violence Hotline in the US [36] and the Women
Against Violence in Europe [21]) maintain lists of state and
local domestic violence hotlines and can refer survivors on-
ward, many countries lack a national hotline for domestic
violence [60], indicating the need of broad referrals for sur-
vivors in these areas. Pointers to external resources could also
be embedded under the company’s FAQ or other tech support
pages, as this approach further increases survivors’ access to
resources with low chances of triggering the abuser when they
only pay attention to the page title or web address.

Regarding the speciﬁc processes in making external refer-
rals, support practitioners and IPV professionals noted differ-
ent challenges. Support practitioners highlighted challenges
around when to refer: not only recognizing signs that someone
might need a referral, but also doing enough vetting to de-
termine that the customer was deﬁnitely experiencing abuse.
IPV professionals did not consider the latter point necessary
or advisable, as it could lead to presumptive labeling or trau-
matizing questions. Instead, they emphasized that whenever
there are red ﬂags indicating a need for further assistance,
agents should provide referrals. They were mainly concerned
with how to refer, and suggested that agents use respectful
language in offering referrals, avoid labeling, and give cus-
tomers enough agency to decide whether they need or want
to act on it. For high-stakes situations like IPV, ensuring who-
ever needs resources can learn about them takes priority, and
recommending resources with non-judgmental language does
not harm customers who do not need them. By offering refer-
rals, support agents are not “taking sides,” but rather serve as
crucial bridges to social workers, attorneys, law enforcement,
and other IPV experts.
Note that avoiding harmful labeling does not mean agents
should be vague in describing the referral resources and asso-
ciated risks. Survivors should be given a clear picture of the
referred organizations to account for potential repercussions
from the abuser. For instance, when sharing the number of
a helpline, agents can use the same terms used by the sur-
vivor to avoid labeling while still being explicit about the
audience it serves. Agents should further caution that the
number, if called, would be in the call history and might be
seen by the abuser; a safer option may be to call from a
friend’s phone or a public phone. Additionally, agents should
not treat all digital abuse victims as IPV survivors by default.
Targeted digital attacks also occur to NGO employees [44],
politicians [30], journalists [82], and in the context of elder
or child abuse [2, 56]; the victims bear similarities to IPV
survivors but have distinct vulnerabilities. Ideally, agents are
trained to generally recognize such situations, use trauma-
informed responses, and make referrals to related resources if
needed.
Train customer support agents. IPV professionals and sup-
port practitioners unanimously agreed that training frontline
agents to be better prepared for tech-enabled IPV cases is both
feasible and critical for supporting survivors. Support agents
are already dealing with these cases. Survivors who contact
computer security companies may not be aware of existing
IPV-related resources, and some may not even realize they
are facing tech-enabled IPV. Therefore, having more potential
contact points, including but not limited to support agents
who receive training in identifying signs of tech-enabled IPV,
is an essential step in raising survivors’ awareness and provid-
ing them with necessary help. Equipping agents with a basic
understanding of IPV and the caution needed for a proper
response is also vital to prevent inadvertent harm, such as
escalating abuse by removing spyware without further pre-
cautions or making misleading promises.
Based on our ﬁndings, we identify the following compo-
nents as potential elements of such training. We have devel-
oped respective training materials and shared them with one
of our partner companies, who provided positive feedback.
1. Introduce IPV to customer support agents. Discuss the
prevalence of IPV, including technical (e.g., how technol-
ogy is misused to facilitate IPV) and non-technical aspects
(e.g., the survivor’s and abuser’s social entanglements and
the need for holistic safety planning). Explain why agents
should be committed to learning how to support survivors.
2. Describe common tech-enabled abuse and desired re-
sponses. Present scenarios of how abusers exploit tech-
nologies in IPV and model how agents should respond.
Deﬁne and give examples of trauma-informed language,
and explain its importance. Frame the problem as an op-
portunity to offer help rather than a situation that requires
careful vetting or evaluation of the customer’s victimhood.
3. Explain how agents could provide support. Present meth-
ods for assisting survivors, such as asking questions that
take into account broader risks beyond the immediate tech
issue, sharing tech safety resources, and making referrals.
4. Identify mental health resources for agents. Provide re-
sources (e.g., therapeutic sessions and peer support groups)
for agents who might be experiencing IPV or suffering sec-
ondary trauma from handling such cases.
Ultimately, training should make agents aware of unique
risks and nuances in IPV, help them pick up cues that indicate
customers experiencing IPV, and teach them how to safely
and respectfully share resources. As support practitioners
noted, training should be updated and provided periodically
to strengthen recall, as frontline agents might not encounter
IPV cases frequently enough to practice applying the knowl-
edge. Furthermore, training components like trauma-informed
language provide beneﬁts beyond IPV survivors. For exam-
ple, victims of hacking and identity theft are also dealing with
complex tech issues and distress in their lives [9, 43], and
would beneﬁt from interacting with agents that use trauma-
informed language.
Track IPV cases to inform decision-making. Some IPV
professionals proposed having an in-house specialized team
for IPV cases to reduce the pressure on frontline agents and
save effort in training everyone. However, support practition-
ers responded that justifying the cost of building this special-
ized team is difﬁcult when the company does not know how
frequently their customers would need it. Both sets of focus
groups brought up the idea of tracking anonymized data of
tech-enabled IPV cases in support agents’ daily work. Do-
ing this would provide insights into the frequency and types

of attack mechanisms, how agents handle these cases, and
the extent to which agents may experience secondary trauma.
Such knowledge can guide companies in making business
decisions, including a specialized internal team to support
survivors and beyond, and identify other opportunities to help
IPV survivors and support agents.
Build partnerships between security companies and IPV
advocates. Tech-enabled IPV is likely to persist, indicating
the need for coordinated expert support. Both computer se-
curity companies and IPV advocacy groups are vital to the
support ecosystem. Our research synthesizes the expert advice
from IPV professionals and support practitioners, who each
have in-depth knowledge of constraints in their professions.
As tech-enabled IPV grows in prevalence and changes its
forms, new countermeasures are needed to protect survivors.
An enduring partnership between IPV support organizations
and computer security companies provides learning pathways
for both parties. IPV professionals can receive guidance on
recognizing signs of spyware and other abuse-enabling tech-
nology in their work. Security professionals can learn about
guidelines for interacting with survivors and incorporating
them into protocols for customer support and beyond. For
example, spyware detection tools would also need to con-
