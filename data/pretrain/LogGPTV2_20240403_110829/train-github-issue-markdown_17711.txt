###  **bug**
You can find the code : https://codesandbox.io/s/j3233w91xw  
**Code explanation :**
  * The Parent component called "ManageEvents" make an API call to get a list of Events from the backend.
  * Once the events get fetch, I use the function "map" to create the child components called "EventCard" that takes in arguments the events parameters that i fetched. (eventName, eventLocation... and EventPictureIDs)
  * In the EventCard component, I fetch the pictures url using the EventPictureIDs parameter and store the urls in the state called "picture" ( state = { picture: [] }; )
  * Then I display the pictures in the component call "CarouselComponent"
**Note : **  
I just added a button "delete" to delete the cards that you will create. You
will get an error on the deletion ( in the javascript console) but if you
refresh the page the card will be deleted.
**PLEASE DO NOT DELETE THE CARD THAT ALREADY EXIST OTHERWISE YOU WONT BE ABLE
TO REPRODUCE THE ERROR**
### **What is the current behavior?**
**Issue :**  
When I create a new Event, I click on the button "Create Event" that triggers
the action to create a default event as follow :  
let postData = {  
name: "New Event",  
location_name: "Paris",  
location_lat: 34.12345,  
location_lng: -14.12345,  
description: "Add the Event's Description",  
date: moment().format("YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm"),  
participant: 20,  
**picture: []**  
};
and once the event is created in the backend, I use the function
"val.unshift(res.data); setstate(....);" to add the event to the ManageEvent
State (I use unshift to have the new event being shown as the first Card)  
And then I re-render the component.  
The issue is that even if the new event does not have any pictures ( picture:
[] ),  
Reactjs render the component "EventCard" showing pictures for this new event.  
Reactjs uses the pictures from the previous card for this new card  
If you refresh the page, the new card will appear correctly without pictures.
but it should appear like that without to refresh the page.
The state of EventCard ( ( state = { picture: [] }; ) ) is not re-init to
empty at the each component creation.
**Note :**  
when using "unshift" the new card appears at the first place with picture
(should not appears with pictures)  
when using "push" instead of "unshift" the new card appears at the last place
without pictures (expected)
### **What is the expected behavior?**
I want to use "unshift" to have the new card at the first place without
pictures
### **Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this
issue? **
"react": "^16.5.2"  
Chrome - Firefox
