User: I'm using cx_freeze to freeze a Python script for distribution to other windows systems. I did everything as instructed and cx_freeze generated a  build\exe.win32-2.6 folder in the folder containing my sources. This directory now contains a a bunch of PYD files, a library.zip file, the python DLL file and the main executable. Which of these files would I need to distribute? Any help, guys?
Thanks in advance.
Assistant: You need all of them.
