User: I have written a Python TCP/IP server for internal use, using win32serviceutil/py2exe to create a Windows service.
I installed it on a computer running Windows XP Pro SP3. However, I can't connect to it when it's running as a service. I can confirm that it's binding to the address/port, because I get a conflict when I try to bind to that address/port with another application. Further, I have checked the Windows Firewall settings and have added appropriate exceptions. If I run the server as a simple console application, everything works as expected. However, when I run it as a service, it doesn't work.
I vaguely remember running into this problem before, but for the life of me can't remember any of the details.
Suggestions, anyone?
Assistant: First of all, whenever you implement a Windows service, be sure to add proper logging.
My worker threads were terminating because of the exception, "The socket operation could not complete without blocking."
The solution was to simply call sock.setblocking(1) after accepting the connection.
