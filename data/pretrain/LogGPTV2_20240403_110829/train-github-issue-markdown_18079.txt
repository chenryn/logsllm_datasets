### Model description
FELIX is an encoder-only text editing model, which allows for faster editing
and summarization than sequence-to-sequence models, because the summarization
can be computed in parallel instead of autoregressively.
  * Blog
  * Paper
### Open source status
  * The model implementation is available
  * The model weights are available
### Provide useful links for the implementation
https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/felix
No weights are available, but code to train it is available. A component of
FELIX is BERT, so training FELIX is a matter of fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT
model.
