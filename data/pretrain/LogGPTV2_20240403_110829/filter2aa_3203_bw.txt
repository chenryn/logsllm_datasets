Page: 392

#### Figure 13-17: The Add IP Filter Dialog Box
Figure 13-17 illustrates an example of adding an IPv4 packet filter. The following settings can be configured on an IPv4 packet filter:

1. **IP Protocol**: This is the identifier for an upper-layer protocol. For instance, TCP uses a protocol number of 6, UDP uses 17, and ICMP uses 1.

2. **Source IP Address**: This is the IP address of the source host. You can configure this address with a subnet mask to specify a range of IP addresses (corresponding to an IP subnet or address prefix) with a single filter entry.

3. **Destination IP Address**: This is the IP address of the destination host. Similar to the source IP address, you can use a subnet mask to specify a range of IP addresses with a single filter entry.

4. **TCP Traffic**:
   - **TCP Source Port**: Identifies the source process sending the TCP segment.
   - **TCP Destination Port**: Identifies the destination process for the TCP segment.

5. **UDP Traffic**:
   - **UDP Source Port**: Identifies the source process sending the UDP message.
   - **UDP Destination Port**: Identifies the destination process for the UDP message.

6. **ICMP Traffic**:
   - **ICMP Type**: Identifies the type of ICMP packet (e.g., Echo, Echo Reply).
   - **ICMP Code**: Identifies one of the possible multiple functions within a specified type. If only one function exists within a type, the Code field is set to 0.

### IPv6 Packet Filtering
IPv6 packet filtering can be performed using the following methods:

1. **Windows Firewall**
2. **IPv6 Packet Filtering with Routing and Remote Access**
3. **Basic IPv6 Firewall**
4. **IPv6 ICF**

#### Windows Firewall
- **Supported Versions**: Windows Vista, Windows XP with SP2 and later, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2003 with SP1 and later.
- **Configuration**: You can configure exceptions for IPv6 traffic using the Windows Firewall with Advanced Security snap-in and the Windows Firewall item in Control Panel.
- **Shared Settings**: IPv4 and IPv6 traffic can share settings for excepted traffic. For example, allowing file and print sharing traffic will permit both IPv4-based and IPv6-based unsolicited incoming traffic.

#### IPv6 Packet Filtering with Routing and Remote Access
- **Supported Version**: Windows Server 2008.
- **Configuration Steps**:
  1. In the Routing and Remote Access snap-in, open the server name, then IPv6, and click General.
  2. Right-click the interface where you want to add a filter and select Properties.
  3. On the General tab, click Inbound Filters to configure filters for incoming IPv6 traffic or Outbound Filters for outgoing IPv6 traffic.
- **Address Configuration**: When specifying a source or destination IPv6 address, you must configure an address prefix and a prefix length.

#### Basic IPv6 Firewall
- **Supported Version**: Windows Server 2003 with no service packs installed.
- **Behavior**: When enabled, it drops incoming TCP Synchronize (SYN) segments and all incoming unsolicited UDP messages.
- **Default State**: Disabled by default on all interfaces.
- **Enable Command**: `netsh interface ipv6 set interface interface=NameOrIndex firewall=enabled`
- **Replacement**: Replaced with Windows Firewall.

#### IPv6 ICF
- **Supported Version**: Available as part of the Advanced Networking Pack for Windows XP (SP1).
- **Features**:
  - Automatically runs and filters traffic through all network connections where IPv6 is enabled.
  - Monitors outbound traffic and dynamically filters incoming response traffic (stateful filtering).
  - Silently discards all unsolicited incoming traffic.
  - Logs IPv6 traffic events to a separate log file (default location: `Systemroot\Pfirewall-v6.log`).
- **Configuration**: Use Netsh commands in the `netsh firewall` context to allow specific types of ICMPv6 traffic or traffic to specific TCP or UDP ports.
- **Replacement**: Replaced with Windows Firewall.

### Chapter Summary
- **Internet Protocol Security (IPsec)**: A framework of open standards for ensuring private, protected communications over IP networks. It provides data integrity, confidentiality, data origin authentication, and anti-replay security properties.
- **IPsec Modes**: Transport mode (uses the original IP header) and tunnel mode (encapsulates the entire IP packet with a new IP header).
- **IPsec Negotiation**: Uses main mode for key material and peer authentication, and quick mode for protecting traffic between peers.
- **IPsec Configuration**: Can be done using the Windows Firewall with Advanced Security or IPsec Policy Management snap-ins.
- **IPsec Support for IPv6**: Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 support ESP data encryption, while Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 do not.
- **Windows Firewall**: A stateful IPv4 and IPv6 firewall in Windows Vista, Windows XP with SP2 and later, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2003 with SP1 and later.
- **ICF and Basic Firewall**: Stateful IPv4 firewalls provided with earlier versions of Windows.

### Chapter Glossary
- **AH (Authentication Header)**: Provides data integrity, data origin authentication, and anti-replay security services.

- **ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload)**: Provides confidentiality, data integrity, data origin authentication, and anti-replay security services.
- **ICF (Internet Connection Firewall)**: A stateful firewall built into Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.

- **IP Filter**: A description of network traffic including source and destination addresses, masks, protocols, and ports.
- **IP Packet Filtering**: A capability of Routing and Remote Access to specify allowed or discarded IPv4 traffic on a per-interface basis.
- **IPsec Policy**: A collection of rules and settings for IPsec services.
- **Rule**: A list of IP filters and security actions that occur when a packet matches a filter.
- **SA (Security Association)**: A combination of a mutually agreeable policy and keys defining the security services, mechanisms, and keys used to protect communication.
- **SPI (Security Parameters Index)**: A unique value in an SA that distinguishes among multiple security associations.

### Chapter 14 – Virtual Private Networking
**TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows**  
Page: 399

#### Abstract
This chapter describes the virtual private network (VPN) technologies included with Microsoft Windows operating systems, enabling remote users to connect to an intranet or remote offices to connect to each other. As a network administrator, understanding how to configure and use VPN connections is crucial for leveraging the global connectivity of the Internet to provide secure and ubiquitous connectivity.

#### Chapter Objectives
- Define a virtual private network (VPN) in terms of its benefits, components, and attributes.
- Describe the two types of VPN connections and how routing works for each.
- Explain the roles of different VPN protocols, including PPP, PPTP, L2TP/IPsec, and SSTP.
- Describe the process for creating various types of VPN connections.
- Configure remote access and site-to-site VPN connections.
- Describe the use of RADIUS for VPN connections and use either NPS or IAS as a RADIUS server and proxy.

#### Virtual Private Networking Overview
- **Definition**: A VPN extends a private network to encompass links across shared or public networks like the Internet.
- **Emulation**: Data is encapsulated and encrypted to emulate a point-to-point private link.
- **Benefits**: Users can connect to an organization's server from a remote location using the infrastructure of a public internetwork.
- **Routed Connections**: Organizations can create routed site-to-site connections with geographically separate offices or other organizations, maintaining secure communication.
- **Cost Savings**: Long-distance dial-up or leased lines can be replaced with local dial-up or leased lines to an ISP.

#### Components of a VPN
- **VPN Server**: A computer that accepts remote access or site-to-site connections from VPN clients.
- **VPN Client**: A computer that initiates a connection to a VPN server. It can be an individual computer or a router.
- **Tunnel**: The portion of the connection where data is encapsulated.
- **VPN Connection**: The portion of the connection where data is encrypted.
- **Tunneling Protocols**: Communication standards for managing tunnels and encapsulating private data. Examples include PPTP, L2TP, and SSTP.
- **Tunneled Data**: Data sent through a VPN tunnel.
- **Transit Internetwork**: A shared or public internetwork crossed by encapsulated data.
