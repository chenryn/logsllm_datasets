##### ISSUE TYPE
Feature Idea
##### COMPONENT NAME
`mysql_user`
##### ANSIBLE VERSION
    ansible 2.3.0.0
      config file =
      configured module search path = Default w/o overrides
##### CONFIGURATION
Default configuration
##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
N/A
##### SUMMARY
From the MySQL 5.7 what's new page:
> The server now requires account rows in the mysql.user table to have a
> nonempty plugin column value and disables accounts with an empty value.
On a fresh installation of MySQL 5.7 the `root` user for host `localhost` is
now configured with a plugin value of `auth_socket`. This prevents users other
then root to connect as root using the `mysql`client utility:
    user@server$ mysql -u root -pP4ssw0rd
    ERROR 1698 (28000): Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost'
While as root this works:
    root@server# mysql
Currently, this cannot be done with Ansible.

##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
It would be nice to introduce a new parameter to this module which accepts all
possible plugin values (defaulting to `mysql_native_password`) , e.g.:
    mysql_user: name=root password=abc123 plugin=mysql_native_password
    mysql_user: name=root plugin=auth_socket

##### ACTUAL RESULTS

##### CHALLENGES
  * @oscherler noted that the syntax varies between MySQL and MariaDB: ansible/ansible-modules-core#3587 (comment)
  * @wouteroostervld added that you have to change the plugin and password in one action, to avoid exposure: ansible/ansible-modules-core#3003 (comment)
##### NOTES
  * Issue migrated from ansible/ansible-modules-core#3003
  * Releated PR: ansible/ansible-modules-core#3587
I changed a few details:
  * @verwilst mentioned that you can use either a password or auth_socket not both: ansible/ansible-modules-core#3003 (comment)
  * I updated the format to follow the latest one
  * I updated the ansible version output, even if not very usefull in this case
  * I also added some references and a challenges section
