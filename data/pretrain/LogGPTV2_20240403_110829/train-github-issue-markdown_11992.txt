### Summary
According to the MySQL 5.7 "What's New" documentation, the server now requires account rows in the `mysql.user` table to have a non-empty `plugin` column value and disables accounts with an empty value. On a fresh installation of MySQL 5.7, the `root` user for the host `localhost` is configured with a `plugin` value of `auth_socket`. This prevents users other than `root` from connecting as `root` using the `mysql` client utility:

```bash
user@server$ mysql -u root -pP4ssw0rd
ERROR 1698 (28000): Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost'
```

However, when logged in as `root`, the following command works:

```bash
root@server# mysql
```

Currently, this behavior cannot be managed with Ansible.

### Steps to Reproduce
It would be beneficial to introduce a new parameter to the `mysql_user` module that accepts all possible plugin values, defaulting to `mysql_native_password`. For example:

```yaml
- mysql_user:
    name: root
    password: abc123
    plugin: mysql_native_password

- mysql_user:
    name: root
    plugin: auth_socket
```

### Expected Results
The `mysql_user` module should be able to set the `plugin` value for a user, allowing for the management of authentication methods such as `auth_socket` and `mysql_native_password`.

### Actual Results
Currently, the `mysql_user` module does not support setting the `plugin` value, leading to limitations in managing user authentication methods.

### Challenges
- @oscherler noted that the syntax for setting the `plugin` value varies between MySQL and MariaDB. (Reference: ansible/ansible-modules-core#3587 (comment))
- @wouteroostervld added that the `plugin` and `password` must be changed in one action to avoid exposure. (Reference: ansible/ansible-modules-core#3003 (comment))

### Notes
- This issue was migrated from ansible/ansible-modules-core#3003.
- Related Pull Request: ansible/ansible-modules-core#3587
- @verwilst mentioned that you can use either a password or `auth_socket`, but not both. (Reference: ansible/ansible-modules-core#3003 (comment))
- The format has been updated to follow the latest guidelines.
- The Ansible version output has been updated, even though it may not be very useful in this context.
- Additional references and a challenges section have been added.
