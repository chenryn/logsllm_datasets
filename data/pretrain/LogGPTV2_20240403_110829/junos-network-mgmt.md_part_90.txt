Layer 2 Port Mirroring Global Instance
On an MX Series router and on an EX Series switch, you can configure a set of port-mirroring properties
that implicitly apply to packets received on all ports in the router (or switch) chassis. This set of port-
mirroring properties is the global instance of Layer 2 port mirroring for the router or switch.
Within the global instance configuration, you can specify a set of mirror destination properties for each
packet address family supported by Layer 2 port mirroring.
For a general description of Layer 2 port-mirroring properties, see "Understanding Layer 2 Port
Mirroring Properties" on page 1013. For a comparison of the types of Layer 2 port mirroring available on
an MX Series router and on an EX Series switch, see Application of Layer 2 Port Mirroring Types.
Configuring the Global Instance of Layer 2 Port Mirroring
On an MX Series router and on an EX Series switch, you can configure a set of Layer 2 port-mirroring
properties that implicitly apply to packets received on all ports in the router (or switch) chassis.
To configure the global instance of Layer 2 port mirroring on an MX Series router and on an EX Series
switch:
1. Enable configuration of the Layer 2 port mirroring:
[edit]
user@host# edit forwarding-options port-mirroring
1125
2. Enable configuration of the packet-selection properties:
[edit forwarding-options port-mirroring]
user@host# edit input
3. Specify global-level packet-selection properties.
a. Specify the number of packets to select:
[edit forwarding-options port-mirroring input]
user@host# set rate number
The valid range is 1 through 65535.
b. Specify the number of packets to mirror from each selection:
[edit forwarding-options port-mirroring input]
user@host# set run-length number
The valid range is 0 through 20. The default value is 0.
c. Specify the length to which mirrored packets are to be truncated:
[edit forwarding-options port-mirroring input]
user@host# set maximum-packet-length number
The valid range is 0 through 9216. The default value is 0, which means the mirrored packets are
not truncated.
4. Specify the global-level Layer 2 address-type family from which traffic is to be selected for mirroring:
[edit forwarding-options port-mirroring input]
user@host# up
[edit forwarding-options port-mirroring]
user@host# edit family family
The value of the family option can be ethernet-switching, cccor vpls.
1126
NOTE: Under the [edit forwarding-options port-mirroring] hierarchy level, the protocol family
statement family ethernet-switching is an alias for family vpls. The command-line interface (CLI)
displays Layer 2 port-mirroring configurations as family vpls, even for Layer 2 port-mirroring
configured as family ethernet-switching. Use family ethernet-switching when the physical interface
is configured with encapsulation ethernet-bridge.
5. Enable configuration of global-level mirror destination properties for this address family:
[edit forwarding-options port-mirroring family family]
user@host# edit output
6. Specify global-level mirror destination properties for this address family.
a. Specify the physical interface on which to send the mirrored packets:
[edit forwarding-options port-mirroring family family output]
user@host# set interface interface-name
You can also specify an integrated routing and bridging (IRB) interface as the output interface.
b. (Optional) Allow configuration of filters on the destination interface for the named port-mirroring
instance:
[edit forwarding-options port-mirroring family family output]
user@host# set no-filter-check
7. (Optional) Specify that any packets selected for mirroring are to be mirrored only once to any
mirroring destination:
[edit forwarding-options port-mirroring family family output]
user@host# up 2
[edit forwarding-options port-mirroring]
user@host# set mirror-once
TIP: Enable the mirror-once option when an MX Series router or an EX Series switch is
configured to perform Layer 2 port mirroring at both ingress and egress interfaces, which
1127
could result in sending duplicate packets to the same destination (which would complicate the
analysis of the mirrored traffic).
8. Verify the minimum configuration of the global instance of Layer 2 port mirroring:
[edit forwarding-options ... ]
user@host# top
[edit]
user@host# show forwarding-options
forwarding-options {
port-mirroring {
input { # Global packet-selection properties.
maximum-packet-length number; # Default is 0.
rate number;
run-length number;
}
family (ccc | vpls) { # Address- type ’ethernet-switching’ displays as ’vpls’.
output { # Global mirror destination properties.
interface interface-name;
no-filter-check; # Optional. Allow filters on interface.
}
}
mirror-once; # Optional. Mirror destinations do not receive duplicate packets.
}
}

Layer 2 Port Mirroring Named Instances Overview
On an MX Series router and on an EX Series switch, you can define a set of port-mirroring properties
that you can explicitly bind to physical ports on the router or switch. This set of port mirroring
properties is known as a named instance of Layer 2 port mirroring.
You can bind a named instance of Layer 2 port mirroring to physical ports associated with an MX Series
router’s or an EX Series switch’s Packet Forwarding Engine components at different levels of the router
(or switch) chassis:
• At the FPC level—You can bind a named instance to the physical ports associated with a specific
Dense Port Concentrator (DPC) or to the physical ports associated with a specific Flexible Port
Concentrator (FPC).
• At the PIC level—You can bind a named instance of port mirroring to a specific Packet Forwarding
Engine (on a specific DPC) or to a specific PIC.
NOTE: MX Series routers support DPCs as well as FPCs and PICs. Unlike FPCs, DPCs do not
support PICs. In the Junos OS CLI, however, you use FPC and PIC syntax to configure or display
information about DPCs and the Packet Forwarding Engines on the DPCs.
The following points summarize the behavior of Layer 2 port mirroring based on named instances:
• The scope of packet selection is determined by the target of the binding—At the ports (or port)
bound to a named instance of Layer 2 port mirroring, the router or switch selects input packets
according to the packet-selection properties in the named instance.
• The destination of a selected packet is determined by the packet address family—Of the packets
selected, the router or switch mirrors only the packets belonging to an address family for which the
named instance of Layer 2 port mirroring specifies a set of mirror destination properties. In a Layer 2
environment, MX Series routers and EX Series switches support port mirroring of VPLS
(family ethernet-switching or family vpls) traffic and Layer 2 VPN traffic with family ccc.
For a general description of Layer 2 port-mirroring properties, see "Understanding Layer 2 Port
Mirroring Properties" on page 1013. For a comparison of the types of Layer 2 port mirroring available on
an MX Series router and on an EX Series switch, see Application of Layer 2 Port Mirroring Types.
Mirroring at Ports Grouped at the FPC Level
On an MX Series router and on an EX Series switch, you can bind a named instance of Layer 2 port
mirroring to a specific DPC or FPC installed in the router (or switch) chassis. The port mirroring
properties in the instance are applied to all Packet Forwarding Engines (and their associated ports) on
the specified DPC or to all PICs (and their associated ports) installed in the specified FPC. Port mirroring
1129
properties that are bound to a DPC or FPC override any port-mirroring properties bound at the global
level or the MX Series router (or switch) chassis.
Mirroring at Ports Grouped at the PIC Level
On an MX Series router and on an EX Series switch, you can bind a named instance of Layer 2 port
mirroring to a specific Packet Forwarding Engine or PIC. The port-mirroring properties in that instance
are applied to all ports associated with the specified Packet Forwarding Engine or PIC. Port-mirroring
properties that are bound to a Packet Forwarding Engine or PIC override any port-mirroring properties
bound at the DPC or FPC that contains them.
NOTE: For MX960 routers, there is a one-to-one mapping of Packet Forwarding Engines to
Ethernet ports. Therefore, on MX960 routers only, you can configure port-specific bindings of
port-mirroring instances.
Mirroring at a Group of Ports Bound to Multiple Named Instances
On an MX Series router and on an EX Series switch, you can apply up to two named instances of Layer 2
port mirroring to the same group of ports within the router (or switch) chassis. By applying two different
port-mirroring instances to the same DPC, FPC, Packet Forwarding Engine, or PIC, you can bind two
distinct Layer 2 port mirroring specifications to a single group of ports.
NOTE: You can configure only one global instance of Layer 2 port mirroring on an MX Series
router and on an EX Series switch.
NOTE: You can configure more than two port mirroring instances for each FPC by configuring
inline port mirroring. For information on inline port mirroring, see "Configuring Inline Port
Mirroring" on page 1134.
Defining a Named Instance of Layer 2 Port Mirroring
On an MX Series router and on an EX Series switch, you can define a set of Layer 2 port-mirroring
properties that you can bind to a particular Packet Forwarding Engine (at the PIC level of the router or
switch chassis) or to a group of Packet Forwarding Engines (at the DPC or FPC level of the chassis).
To define a named instance of Layer 2 port mirroring on an MX Series router or on an EX Series switch:
1130
1. Enable configuration of a named instance of Layer 2 port mirroring :
[edit]
user@host# edit forwarding-options port-mirroring instance pm-instance-name
2. Enable configuration of the packet-sampling properties:
[edit forwarding-options port-mirroring instance pm-instance-name]
user@host# edit input
3. Specify packet-selection properties:
a. Specify the number of packets to select:
[edit forwarding-options port-mirroring instance pm-instance-name input]
user@host# set rate number
The valid range is 1 through 65535.
b. Specify the number of packets to mirror from each selection:
[edit forwarding-options port-mirroring instance pm-named-instance input]
user@host# set run-length number
The valid range is 0 through 20. The default value is 0.
NOTE: The run-length statement is not supported on MX80 routers.
c. Specify the length to which mirrored packets are to be truncated:
[edit forwarding-options port-mirroring instance pm-instance-name input]
user@host# set maximum-packet-length number
The valid range is 0 through 9216. The default value is 0, which means the mirrored packets are not
truncated.
NOTE: The maximum-packet-length statement is not supported on MX80 routers.
1131
4. Enable configuration of the mirror destination properties for Layer 2 packets that are part of bridging
domain, Layer 2 switching cross-connects, or virtual private LAN service (VPLS):
a. Specify the Layer 2 address family type of traffic to be mirrored:
[edit forwarding-options port-mirroring instance pm-instance-name input]
user@host# up
[edit forwarding-options port-mirroring instance pm-instance-name]
user@host# edit family family
The value of the family option can be ethernet-switching, ccc, or vpls.
NOTE: Under the [edit forwarding-options port-mirroring] hierarchy level, the protocol family
statement family ethernet-switching is an alias for family vpls. The command-line interface
(CLI) displays Layer 2 port-mirroring configurations as family vpls, even for Layer 2 port-
mirroring configured as family ethernet-switching. Use family ethernet-switching when the
physical interface is configured with encapsulation ethernet-bridge.
b. Enable configuration of the mirror destination properties:
[edit forwarding-options port-mirroring instance pm-instance-name family family]
user@host# edit output
5. Specify mirror destination properties.
a. Specify the physical interface on which to send the mirrored packets:
[edit forwarding-options port-mirroring instance pm-instance-name family family output]
user@host# set interface interface-name
b. (Optional) Allow configuration of filters on the destination interface for the global port-mirroring
instance:
[edit forwarding-options port-mirroring instance pm-instance-name family family output]
user@host# set no-filter-check
1132
NOTE: You cannot configure port mirroring instances on MX80 routers. You can only
configure port mirroring at the global level on MX80 routers.
6. (Optional) Specify that any packets selected for mirroring are to be mirrored only once to any
mirroring destination:
[edit forwarding-options port-mirroring instance pm-instance-name family family output]
user@host# up 3
[edit forwarding-options port-mirroring]
user@host# set mirror-once
TIP: Enable the global mirror-once option when an MX Series router or an EX Series switch is
configured to perform Layer 2 port mirroring at both ingress and egress interfaces, which
could result in sending duplicate packets to the same destination (which in turn would
complicate the analysis of the mirrored traffic).
7. To configure a mirroring destination for a different packet family type, repeat steps 4 through 6.
8. Verify the minimum configuration of the named instances of Layer 2 port mirroring:
[edit forwarding-options ... ]
user@host# top
[edit]
user@host# show forwarding-options
forwarding-options {
port-mirroring {
... optional-global-port-mirroring-configuration ...
instance {
pm-instance-name ( # A named instance of port mirroring
input { # Packet-selection properties
maximum-packet-length number; # Default is 0.
rate number;
run-length number;
}
family (ccc | vpls) { # Address- type ’ethernet-switching’ displays as ’vpls’.
output { # Mirror destination properties
interface interface-name;
no-filter-check; # Optional. Allow filters on interface.
1133
}
}
}
}
mirror-once; # Optional. Mirror destinations do not receive duplicate packets.
}
}
Disabling Layer 2 Port Mirroring Instances
You can disable the global instance of Layer 2 port mirroring, a particular named instance, or all
instances of port mirroring:
• To disable the global instance of Layer 2 port mirroring, include the disable statement at the [edit
forwarding-options port-mirroring] hierarchy level:
[edit]
forwarding-options {
port-mirroring {
disable; Disables the global instance of Layer 2 port mirroring.
...global-instance-of-layer-2-port-mirroring-configuration...
}
}
• To disable the definition of a particular named instance of Layer 2 port mirroring, include the disable
statement at the [edit forwarding-options port-mirroring instance instance-name] hierarchy level:
[edit]
forwarding-options {
port-mirroring {
...optional-configuration-of-the-global-instance-of-layer-2-port-mirroring...
instance {
port-mirroring-instance-name {
disable; Disables this named instance of Layer 2 port mirroring.
...definition-of-a-named-instance-of-layer-2-port-mirroring...
}
}
}
}
1134
• To disable the global instance and all named instances of Layer 2 port mirroring, include the disable-
all-instances statement at the [edit forwarding-options port-mirroring] hierarchy level:
[edit]
forwarding-options {
port-mirroring {
disable-all-instances; Disables all instances of Layer 2 port mirroring.
...optional-configuration-of-the-global-instance-of-layer-2-port-mirroring...
instance {
port-mirroring-instance-name {
...definition-of-a-named-instance-of-layer-2-port-mirroring...
}
}
}
}
Configuring Inline Port Mirroring
Inline port mirroring provides you with the ability to specify instances that are not bound to the flexible
PIC concentrator (FPC) in the firewall filter then port-mirror-instance action. This way, you are not limited
to only two port-mirror instances per FPC. Inline port mirroring decouples the port-mirror destination
from the input parameters like rate. While the input parameters are programmed in the switch interface
board, the next-hop destination of the mirrored packet is available in the packet itself. Inline port
mirroring is supported only on Trio-based modular port concentrators (MPCs).
Using inline port mirroring, a port-mirror instance will have an option to inherit input parameters from
another instance that specifies it, as shown in the following CLI configuration example:
instance pm2 {
+ input-parameters-instance pm1;
family inet {
output {
interface ge-1/2/3.0 {
next-hop 192.0.2.10;
}
}
}
}
1135
Multiple levels of inheritance are not allowed. One instance can be referred by multiple instances. An
instance can refer to another instance that is defined before it. Forward references are not allowed and
an instance cannot refer to itself, doing so will cause an error during configuration parsing.
The user can specify an instance that is not bound to the FPC in the firewall filter. The specified filter
should inherit one of the two instances that have been bound to the FPC. If it does not, the packet is not
marked for port-mirroring. If it does, then the packet will be sampled using the input parameters
specified by the referred instance but the copy will be sent to the its own destination.

Precedence of Multiple Levels of Layer 2 Port Mirroring on a Physical Interface
You can bind different sets of Layer 2 port mirroring properties (the global instance and one or more
named instances) at various levels of an MX Series router or of an EX Series switch chassis (at the
chassis level, at the FPC level, or at the PIC level). Therefore, it is possible for a single group of physical
interfaces to be bound to multiple Layer 2 port mirroring definitions.
If a group of ports (or, in the case of a PIC-level binding in an MX960 router, a single port) is bound to
multiple Layer 2 port mirroring definitions, the router (or switch) applies the Layer 2 port-mirroring
properties to those ports as follows:
1. Chassis-level port-mirroring properties implicitly apply to all ports in the chassis. If an MX Series
router or an EX Series switch is configured with the global port-mirroring instance, those port
mirroring properties apply to all ports. See Configuring the Global Instance of Layer 2 Port Mirroring.
2. FPC-level port-mirroring properties override chassis-level properties. If a DPC or FPC is bound to a
named instance of port mirroring, those port mirroring properties apply to all ports associated with
1136
that DPC or FPC, overriding any port mirroring properties bound at the chassis level. See "Binding
Layer 2 Port Mirroring to Ports Grouped at the FPC Level" on page 1136.
3. PIC-level port-mirroring properties override FPC-level properties. If a Packet Forwarding Engine or
PIC is bound to a named instance of port-mirroring, those port mirroring properties apply to all ports
associated with the Packet Forwarding Engine or PIC, overriding any port-mirroring properties bound
to those ports at the FPC level. See "Binding Layer 2 Port Mirroring to Ports Grouped at the PIC
Level" on page 1137.
Binding Layer 2 Port Mirroring to Ports Grouped at the FPC Level
On an MX Series router and on an EX Series switch, you can bind a named instance of Layer 2 port
mirroring to a specific DPC or to a specific FPC in the router (or switch) chassis. This is known as binding
a named instance of Layer 2 port mirroring at the FPC level of the router (or switch) chassis. The port
mirroring properties specified in the named instance are applied to all physical ports associated with all
Packet Forwarding Engines on the specified DPC or FPC.
NOTE: You can also bind a named instance of Layer 2 port mirroring to a specific Packet
Forwarding Engine on a DPC or FPC in the router (or switch) chassis.
For any packet-type family supported by Layer 2 port mirroring
• Port-mirroring properties bound to a specific DPC or FPC override any port-mirroring
properties configured at the global level.
• Port-mirroring properties bound to a specific Packet Forwarding Engine override any port-
mirroring properties configured at the DPC or FPC level.
You can apply up to two named instances of Layer 2 port mirroring to the same group of ports within
the router (or switch) chassis. By applying two different port-mirroring instances to the same DPC or
FPC, you can bind two distinct Layer 2 port-mirroring specifications to a single group of ports.
Before you begin, complete the following tasks:
• Define a named instance of Layer 2 port mirroring. See Defining a Named Instance of Layer 2 Port
Mirroring.
• Display information about the number and types of DPCs or FPCs in the MX Series router and in the
EX Series switch, the number of Packet Forwarding Engines on each, and the number and types of
ports per Packet Forwarding Engine.
To bind a named instance of Layer 2 port mirroring to a DPC or FPC and its Packet Forwarding Engines:
