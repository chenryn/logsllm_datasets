User: When enabled sshd jail i see Starting fail2ban: ERROR  NOK: ("Failed to initialize any backend for Jail 'sshd'",)
ERROR  NOK: ('sshd',)
In logs :
ERROR Backend 'systemd' failed to initialize due to No module named systemd
ERROR Failed to initialize any backend for Jail 'sshd'
Centos 6.7 no have systemd module .
CentOS 6.7, python 2.6
Assistant: I was able to fix this by editing the paths-common.conf file from:
default_backend = %(default/backend)s
to:
default_backend = pynotify or default_backend = auto
