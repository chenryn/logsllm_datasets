User: I am playing 2 videos in two different pipelines of gstreamer. I would like to synchronize both the videos. do any of you have any tips?
Assistant: Depends on what you mean by synchronization, what are your sources and what is your pipeline. If both are getting data from different sources unless the sources were synchronized in some form there is no real sense to what you mean by synchronize the two pipelines
If all you want is that they are in lock step with each other irrespective of what their source offsets were, as long as you have a clock based pipeline they will remain so. [say you are capturing from two usb cameras]. As long as the system is fast enough to run the 2 pipelines in real time they will remain in real time.
If you just want to display the two side by side irrespective of the initial offsets between them use videomixer and place them side by side. It will automatically ensure the two are synchronized in the sense that the videos will move in lock step with each other 
If you want them to be synchronized on basis of the timestamps then you have to use RTSP. Send the output from both the pipelines to a gstrtpbin and from the single gstrtpbin you can get synchronized streams. This is slightly non trivial.
