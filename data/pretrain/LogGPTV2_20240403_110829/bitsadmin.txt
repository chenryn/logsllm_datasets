Bitsadmin is a command-line tool used to create, download or upload jobs, and to monitor their progress. The bitsadmin tool uses switches to identify the work to perform. You can call bitsadmin /? or bitsadmin /help to get a list of switches.
bitsadmin /?
bitsadmin /help
Most switches require a  parameter, which you set to the job's display name, or GUID. A job's display name doesn't have to be unique. The /create and /list switches return a job's GUID.
By default, you can access information about your own jobs. To access information for another user's jobs, you must have administrator privileges. If the job was created in an elevated state, then you must run bitsadmin from an elevated window; otherwise, you'll have read-only access to the job.
Many of the switches correspond to methods in the BITS interfaces. For additional details that may be relevant to using a switch, see the corresponding method.
Use the following switches to create a job, set and retrieve the properties of a job, and monitor the status of a job. For examples that show how to use some of these switches to perform tasks, see bitsadmin examples.
