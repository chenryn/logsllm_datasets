Modals that have been opened and closed and reopened are not being closed
using the x or the close button. The live example modal from the docs shows
this http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals.
Open the modal.  
Close it however you'd like.  
Reopen the modal.  
Clicking close or the X does not close the modal only clicking outside will
close it.
