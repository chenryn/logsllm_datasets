To perform deadlock checking, we use the standard method of viewing the  
various processes as nodes in a directed graph (the waits-for graph or  
WFG).  There is a graph edge leading from process A to process B if A  
waits for B, ie, A is waiting for some lock and B holds a conflicting  
lock.  There is a deadlock condition if and only if the WFG contains a  
cycle.  We detect cycles by searching outward along waits-for edges to  
see if we return to our starting point.  There are three possible  
outcomes:  
1. All outgoing paths terminate at a running process (which has no  
outgoing edge).  
2. A deadlock is detected by looping back to the start point.  We  
resolve such a deadlock by canceling the start point's lock request and  
reporting an error in that transaction, which normally leads to  
transaction abort and release of that transaction's held locks.  Note  
that it's sufficient to cancel one request to remove the cycle; we don't  
need to kill all the transactions involved.  
3. Some path(s) loop back to a node other than the start point.  This  
indicates a deadlock, but one that does not involve our starting  
process. We ignore this condition on the grounds that resolving such a  
deadlock is the responsibility of the processes involved --- killing our  
start-point process would not resolve the deadlock.  So, cases 1 and 3  
both report "no deadlock".  
Postgres' situation is a little more complex than the standard discussion  
of deadlock detection, for two reasons:  
1. A process can be waiting for more than one other process, since there  
might be multiple PROCLOCKs of (non-conflicting) lock types that all  
conflict with the waiter's request.  This creates no real difficulty  
however; we simply need to be prepared to trace more than one outgoing  
edge.  
2. If a process A is behind a process B in some lock's wait queue, and  
their requested locks conflict, then we must say that A waits for B, since  
ProcLockWakeup will never awaken A before B.  This creates additional  
edges in the WFG.  We call these "soft" edges, as opposed to the "hard"  
edges induced by locks already held.  Note that if B already holds any  
locks conflicting with A's request, then their relationship is a hard edge  
not a soft edge.  
A "soft" block, or wait-priority block, has the same potential for  
inducing deadlock as a hard block.  However, we may be able to resolve  
a soft block without aborting the transactions involved: we can instead  
rearrange the order of the wait queue.  This rearrangement reverses the  
direction of the soft edge between two processes with conflicting requests  
whose queue order is reversed.  If we can find a rearrangement that  
eliminates a cycle without creating new ones, then we can avoid an abort.  
Checking for such possible rearrangements is the trickiest part of the  
algorithm.  
The workhorse of the deadlock detector is a routine FindLockCycle() which  
is given a starting point process (which must be a waiting process).  
It recursively scans outward across waits-for edges as discussed above.  
If it finds no cycle involving the start point, it returns "false".  
(As discussed above, we can ignore cycles not involving the start point.)  
When such a cycle is found, FindLockCycle() returns "true", and as it  
unwinds it also builds a list of any "soft" edges involved in the cycle.  
If the resulting list is empty then there is a hard deadlock and the  
configuration cannot succeed.  However, if the list is not empty, then  
reversing any one of the listed edges through wait-queue rearrangement  
will eliminate that cycle.  Since such a reversal might create cycles  
elsewhere, we may need to try every possibility.  Therefore, we need to  
be able to invoke FindLockCycle() on hypothetical configurations (wait  
orders) as well as the current real order.  
The easiest way to handle this seems to be to have a lookaside table that  
shows the proposed new queue order for each wait queue that we are  
considering rearranging.  This table is checked by FindLockCycle, and it  
believes the proposed queue order rather than the real order for each lock  
that has an entry in the lookaside table.  
We build a proposed new queue order by doing a "topological sort" of the  
existing entries.  Each soft edge that we are currently considering  
reversing creates a property of the partial order that the topological sort  
has to enforce.  We must use a sort method that preserves the input  
ordering as much as possible, so as not to gratuitously break arrival  
order for processes not involved in a deadlock.  (This is not true of the  
tsort method shown in Knuth, for example, but it's easily done by a simple  
doubly-nested-loop method that emits the first legal candidate at each  
step.  Fortunately, we don't need a highly efficient sort algorithm, since  
the number of partial order constraints is not likely to be large.)  Note  
that failure of the topological sort tells us we have conflicting ordering  
constraints, and therefore that the last-added soft edge reversal  
conflicts with a prior edge reversal.  We need to detect this case to  
avoid an infinite loop in the case where no possible rearrangement will  
work: otherwise, we might try a reversal, find that it still leads to  
a cycle, then try to un-reverse the reversal while trying to get rid of  
that cycle, etc etc.  Topological sort failure tells us the un-reversal  
is not a legitimate move in this context.  
So, the basic step in our rearrangement method is to take a list of  
soft edges in a cycle (as returned by FindLockCycle()) and successively  
try the reversal of each one as a topological-sort constraint added to  
whatever constraints we are already considering.  We recursively search  
through all such sets of constraints to see if any one eliminates all  
the deadlock cycles at once.  Although this might seem impossibly  
inefficient, it shouldn't be a big problem in practice, because there  
will normally be very few, and not very large, deadlock cycles --- if  
any at all.  So the combinatorial inefficiency isn't going to hurt us.  
Besides, it's better to spend some time to guarantee that we've checked  
all possible escape routes than to abort a transaction when we didn't  
really have to.  
Each edge reversal constraint can be viewed as requesting that the waiting  
process A be moved to before the blocking process B in the wait queue they  
are both in.  This action will reverse the desired soft edge, as well as  
any other soft edges between A and other processes it is advanced over.  
No other edges will be affected (note this is actually a constraint on our  
topological sort method to not re-order the queue more than necessary.)  
Therefore, we can be sure we have not created any new deadlock cycles if  
neither FindLockCycle(A) nor FindLockCycle(B) discovers any cycle.  Given  
the above-defined behavior of FindLockCycle, each of these searches is  
necessary as well as sufficient, since FindLockCycle starting at the  
original start point will not complain about cycles that include A or B  
but not the original start point.  
In short then, a proposed rearrangement of the wait queue(s) is determined  
by one or more broken soft edges A->B, fully specified by the output of  
topological sorts of each wait queue involved, and then tested by invoking  
FindLockCycle() starting at the original start point as well as each of  
the mentioned processes (A's and B's).  If none of the tests detect a  
cycle, then we have a valid configuration and can implement it by  
reordering the wait queues per the sort outputs (and then applying  
ProcLockWakeup on each reordered queue, in case a waiter has become wakable).  
If any test detects a soft cycle, we can try to resolve it by adding each  
soft link in that cycle, in turn, to the proposed rearrangement list.  
This is repeated recursively until we either find a workable rearrangement  
or determine that none exists.  In the latter case, the outer level  
resolves the deadlock by aborting the original start-point transaction.  
The particular order in which rearrangements are tried depends on the  
order FindLockCycle() happens to scan in, so if there are multiple  
workable rearrangements of the wait queues, then it is unspecified which  
one will be chosen.  What's more important is that we guarantee to try  
every queue rearrangement that could lead to success.  (For example,  
if we have A before B before C and the needed order constraints are  
C before A and B before C, we would first discover that A before C  
doesn't work and try the rearrangement C before A before B.  This would  
eventually lead to the discovery of the additional constraint B before C.)  
Got that?
