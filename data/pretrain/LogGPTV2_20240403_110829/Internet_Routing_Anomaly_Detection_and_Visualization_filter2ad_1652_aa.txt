## Abstract
Diagnosing inter-domain routing problems in the Internet is challenging. BGP, the de facto inter-domain protocol, is designed for routing, not diagnosis. It generates a large volume of messages even for minor connectivity changes, making it difficult to interpret the data. We have developed statistical techniques to extract the large-scale structure of BGP events and visualization techniques to display this structure in operationally meaningful ways. These tools can detect routing anomalies in real-time. We present case studies of routing instabilities at a Tier-1 ISP and a large institutional network, automatically diagnosed by our tools. We also discuss the limitations of using BGP events alone and how integrating additional data sources can improve understanding.

## 1. Introduction
The Internet is composed of Autonomous Systems (ASs) and relies on two levels of routing: intra-domain and inter-domain. An AS is a collection of network resources under the administrative control of a single entity. Intra-domain routing uses Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs), such as OSPF or ISIS for ISPs, and EIGRP or OSPF for enterprises. Inter-domain routing uses the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to facilitate connectivity to the rest of the Internet. BGP routers exchange route announcements and withdrawals with peers in other ASs, attaching path attributes like AS paths and community tags. ASs configure policies based on these attributes to filter routes and achieve their business goals.

Despite its simplicity, BGP's associated routing policies are complex. Misconfigurations can lead to serious incidents, such as a small AS accidentally announcing the full Internet routing table with one-hop AS paths, causing a major outage. Common anomalies include route hijacking, where a BGP router announces reachability to prefixes it does not own, and route leakage, where a misconfigured BGP router sends too many routes to a peer with limited resources. Persistent route oscillations can also severely affect routing stability.

BGP is designed for routing, not diagnosis. For example, a peering session reset between two BGP peers requires explicit withdrawals and re-establishment of the session, generating a large number of messages. The sheer number of prefixes and possible paths makes it difficult to understand what is happening in the Internet through BGP. This paper presents solutions to detect and visualize Internet routing anomalies, including:

- A visualization technique that shows the large-scale structure of BGP routes.
- An analysis technique for anomaly detection with BGP events.
- Integration of router configuration files, traffic data, and IGP routing data.
- Case studies of routing instabilities observed in a large educational network and a major U.S. Tier-1 ISP.

## 2. Data Collection Methodology
We collected BGP and IGP routing data from real networks using the Packet Design Route Explorer (REX). REX forms passive iBGP peers with all BGP edge routers or core route reflectors, providing the same view of BGP information as other members of the iBGP mesh. REX maintains a database for each peer to track route attributes, augmenting BGP messages with withdrawn attributes. Our first dataset was collected at U.C. Berkeley from August to December 2003, during a period of significant transitions. The second dataset was collected at a U.S. Tier-1 ISP (ISP-Anon) from June to August 2002, anonymizing IP addresses, prefixes, router names, and AS numbers.

Our techniques are designed to apply to both iBGP and eBGP. Most BGP studies focus on globally visible problems, but diagnosis from within a site is critical for network operators. This paper is the first to study root cause diagnosis and show BGP misbehaviors from within a network’s point-of-view.

## 3. Making Sense of Inter-domain Routing
We present two techniques for detecting and visualizing Internet inter-domain routing anomalies: TAMP (Threshold and Merge Prefixes) for visualization and Stemming for root-cause diagnosis. These techniques can be used together or separately.

### 3.1 Visualization: TAMP Picture and Animation
TAMP generates a picture or animation of a set of BGP routes, showing inter-domain routing as routers see it. TAMP constructs a virtual tree for each BGP router, linking the router to BGP Nexthops, ASs, and prefixes. Edge weights are proportional to the number of unique prefixes carried on the edge. TAMP merges these trees into a graph, computing edge weights by combining common prefixes. The resulting TAMP graph is laid out using AT&T’s graphviz library. For realistic networks, the TAMP graph would be extremely bushy, so we use thresholding and merging to simplify it.

## 4. Case Studies
We present case studies of routing instabilities observed in a large educational network and a major U.S. Tier-1 ISP. These case studies include hard-to-detect, problematic BGP incidents, such as backdoor routes, misconfigured community tags, policy filters with unintended consequences, unexpected leaked paths, and persistent route oscillations, all automatically diagnosed by our techniques.

## 5. Integration of Additional Data Sources
We describe the integration of router configuration files, traffic data, and IGP routing data into our techniques to better understand routing anomalies. This integration provides a more comprehensive view of the network, enhancing the accuracy and effectiveness of our tools.

## 6. Related Work
We discuss related work in the field of BGP anomaly detection and visualization, highlighting the contributions and differences of our approach.

## 7. Conclusion
We conclude with a summary of the project's status and future directions, emphasizing the importance of our techniques in improving the reliability and stability of Internet routing.
