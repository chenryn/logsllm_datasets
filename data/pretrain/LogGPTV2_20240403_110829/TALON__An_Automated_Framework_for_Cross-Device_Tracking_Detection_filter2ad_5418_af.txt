desktop crawl values are in range {0,1}, where 0 represents
the before/test sessions, while 1 the after/train sessions. The
time of crawl is divided in 30 minutes timeslots and is en-
coded in range {0,48}. The day of crawl is encoded in range
{1,7}. V represents the (enumerated) vectors of values in the
sets of: landing pages, training pages, ads and ad categories.
