### Software Requirements
To run the ontology construction tools, the following software versions are required:
- Java 1.4.0 or later (version 1.4.0 or later is strongly recommended)
- Jena 1.2 (or later)
- GraphViz 1.8.x
- Xerces 1.4.x
- IsaViz (http://www.w3.org/2001/11/IsaViz/Overview.html) for additional features

Installation instructions are available on the editor’s web page (http://www.w3.org/2001/11/IsaViz/Overview.html).

### Ontolingua
**Introduction**
The Ontolingua server, developed by the Knowledge Systems Laboratory at Stanford University, was one of the first ontology tools. It was designed to facilitate the development of ontologies through a form-based web interface. Initially, the primary application within the Ontolingua Server was an ontology editor, which supports distributed, collaborative editing, browsing, and creation of ontologies.

**Additional Features**
- **Webster**: A tool for reorganizing taxonomies and resolving name conflicts in knowledge bases.
- **Open Knowledge Base Connectivity (OKBC) Server**: Facilitates remote access to ontologies.
- **Ontology Merge Tool**: Allows merging of multiple ontologies.

**Export and Import Formats**
- **Export Formats**: DAML+OIL, KIF, OKBC, LOOM, Prolog, Ontolingua, CLIPS
- **Import Formats**: Classic Ocelot, Protégé knowledge bases

**Usage from External Applications**
- **Remote Access**: Connect to the OKBC Server from a remote client.
- **Translation**: Use the ontology editor to translate the ontology into an implementation language.

**Organization and Interface**
- **Structure**: The Ontolingua Server is a set of ontology-related web applications built on top of the Ontolingua KR System.
- **Language**: Uses an OKBC model with full KIF axioms.
- **Interface**: Divided into two frames: one for the menu and another for creating new classes.
- **Session Management**: Users can create and manage sessions, and share ontologies with group members.

**Collaboration and Reusability**
- **Multi-User Sessions**: Encourages collaborative ontology development.
- **Reusability**: Supports modular ontology construction and reuse through a library of ontologies.

**Limitations**
- **User Knowledge**: Requires familiarity with KIF and the Ontolingua language.
- **User Interface**: Not very user-friendly; buttons are large and primitive, and drawings can be ambiguous.

**Access and Registration**
- **Web Access**: No installation required.
- **Registration**: Users must register to use the system, which provides access to Chimaera, the Ontology Editor, and Webster.

### OilEd
**Introduction**
OilEd is a graphical ontology editor developed by the University of Manchester for Description Logic Ontologies. Its primary purpose is to provide a tool for ontology editing, not for knowledge acquisition or large-scale knowledge base construction.

**Features**
- **Internal Format**: Uses DAML+OIL.
- **Import/Export**: Can import from DAML+OIL and export as RDFS, DAML OWL, RDF/XML, and other formats.
- **Reasoner Integration**: Includes a DAML+OIL checker and integrates with the FaCT reasoner.
- **User Manual**: Included in the distribution, available under the GPL license.

**Installation and Usage**
- **Free Download**: Available for free, but requires registration with a valid email address.
- **OWL Support**: Requires downloading and configuring the sesame-oil.jar library.
- **Packages**: Multiple installation packages are available, including versions with and without the FaCT reasoner.

**Sample Ontologies**
- **Knowledge Acquisition**: (KA)2 demo ontology from the Ontobroker project.
- **Wines**: Deborah McGuinness’ DAML+OIL wines ontology.
- **Diving**: An ontology of terms from scuba diving.
- **Mad Cows**: An ontology demonstrating the use of the reasoner to spot inconsistent concepts.

### WebODE
**Introduction**
WebODE is an ontological engineering workbench developed by the Ontological Engineering Group (OEG) at the Technical University of Madrid. It provides various ontology-related services, including edition, navigation, documentation, merge, and reasoning.

**Architecture**
- **Three-Tier Model**:
  1. **Presentation Tier**: User interface provided via a web browser using HTML, CSS, XML, JavaScript, and Java.
  2. **Middle Tier**: Business logic implemented using servlets and JSPs, with direct access to ontologies through a well-defined API.
  3. **Database Tier**: Contains the data, with ontologies stored in a database.

**Features**
- **Web Application**: Built on top of the ODE API.
- **Interoperability**: Uses standard web technologies for simple interoperability.
- **Validation**: JavaScript for form validation and Java for more complex logic and presentation.

**Access and Usage**
- **Web Access**: No installation required.
- **Collaborative Work**: Supports multi-user sessions and collaborative ontology development.
