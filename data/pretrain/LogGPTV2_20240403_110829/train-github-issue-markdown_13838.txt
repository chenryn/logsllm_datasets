This is from the insider channel. When updating the main version, I got the
same message, asked it to ignore. Currently, that instance crashes every few
minutes. Not sure if the ignore was the cause.
Running from the command line gives the error below  
`{ errorCode: 'load', moduleId: 'https-proxy-agent', neededBy: [
'vs/base/node/proxy' ], detail: { [Error: Cannot find module 'https-proxy-
agent'] code: 'MODULE_NOT_FOUND' } }`
