https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/tree/master/contrib/install.sh has a line
that depends on output coming from `cp`.  
In Ubuntu, if the locale is set to `en_US.UTF-8` then `cp -va` outputs fancy
Unicode quote symbols that are not accounted for by the rest of the script
causing `make install` to fail:
    $ cp -va file1 file2
    ‘file1’ -> ‘file2’
