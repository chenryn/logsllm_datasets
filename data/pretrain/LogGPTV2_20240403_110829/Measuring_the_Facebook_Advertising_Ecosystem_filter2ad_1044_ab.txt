Ad explanations: By simulating the click on the “Why am I
seeing this” button of each ad, AdAnalyst collects the explana-
tion that the user can see regarding the respective ad. Facebook
imposes very strict and opaque rate limits with respect to the
maximum number of explanations we can retrieve. These rate
limits present an accessibility obstacle to users, and conse-
quently also to AdAnalyst. Thus, we developed a scheduling
mechanism where we collect all the HTTP requests that can
be used to retrieve explanations and get only 10 explanations
per hour. Additionally, we do not collect an explanation for
an ad if we have already collected the explanation for the
same ad for the same user within the previous two days. Our
methodology achieves the collection of explanations for most
ads, but does not ensure the collection of every explanation. In
total, we collected 84.2K unique ads with their explanations
(129.1K for DATA-BRAZIL). We did not manage to collect
explanations for 4.4K ads (16.7K for DATA-BRAZIL).
We parse these explanations to retrieve information on the
types of targeting that were used, and the targeting attributes
that are mentioned. For each targeting attribute, we also obtain
its audience size (e.g., the number of Facebook users that sat-
isfy the attribute) from the Facebook Advertising Interface [8].
Ad Preferences: For each user, AdAnalyst collects the in-
formation found in their respective Ad Preferences pages
periodically. From there, we have collected information about
all the attributes that Facebook has inferred about users. In
total, we collected 17.1K distinct
interests, behaviors and
demographics (38.2K for DATA-BRAZIL) from all users. The
median number of attributes that Facebook has inferred for a
user is 310 (615 for DATA-BRAZIL)
Advertisers: From all the ads we collected in our dataset, we
extracted 22K unique advertisers (28K for DATA-BRAZIL). In
order to be able to advertise on Facebook, advertisers currently
need to create a Facebook Page, while this was not the case
in the past. In total, 99.4% of our advertisers have a Facebook
Page (100% for DATA-BRAZIL).
The Facebook Pages can provide information about adver-
tisers. From these pages, we collect the categories that the
advertiser belongs to, the number of people who have ‘Liked’
the Page, and the veriﬁcation badge (i.e., if the advertiser is
veriﬁed by Facebook).
B. Data limitations
There are two sources of biases and limitations in our
dataset, one that comes from users that installed AdAnalyst

and one that comes from the way Facebook provides ad

Representativeness and bias: Representativeness is an im-
portant but challenging issue in any empirical study such as
ours. We designed a methodology to gather Facebook ads that
is as thorough as possible, given our practical constraints. We
used two different strategies to disseminate AdAnalyst. The
ﬁrst consisted of disseminating it in our social and family
circles as well as in the conferences we attended. For this
version, users had to set their Facebook language to English
or French. The second dissemination strategy consisted of
providing AdAnalyst as part of a system focused on bringing
transparency to the Brazilian 2018 elections, in a version that
also works in Portuguese. In order to inspect possible biases in
our dataset, we leverage information that we can infer about the
users in our dataset from their ad explanations (i.e., their age
group, gender and location), and Ads Preferences page (i.e.,
their interest-, behavior- and demographic-based attributes),
and compare them with the global Facebook population. To
estimate the fraction of users in the global Facebook population
with a certain demographic or interest we use the Facebook
Ads Interface [8] and query for monthly active users that
satisfy the respective criteria worldwide as well as in Brazil,
Europe and North America.3
The geographical distribution of our datasets across conti-
nents and some selected countries is depicted in Table I. We
see that, while we do not cover the world representatively, we
do observe some geographical diversity in particular thanks to
the combination of the DATA-WORLDWIDE and the DATA-
BRAZIL dataset. Table II compares the age, gender and edu-
cation level of users in our datasets and the Facebook global
population. We see that our dataset is biased towards: young
ages, with 47.4% of the users being between 22-30 years old–
compared to 32.5% in the Facebook global population4; men,
with 68.4% of the users being male–compared to 57% in
the Facebook global population; and educated users, 71.1%
3In the query we optimize for reach and leave the default “automatic
placements” option selected, which includes users in the whole Facebook
network (e.g., Instagram, mobile users, messenger, and audience network).

of users have indicated tertiary education in their proﬁle–
compared to 35.9% in the Facebook global population. Overall,
we observe that the biases seem closely related to our dissemi-
nation strategies and often transcend geographical boundaries.
We then investigate the biases in our dataset by looking
at the fraction of users in our datasets for which Facebook
has inferred an attribute and compare it with the fraction
in the Facebook population. Figure 1 presents the compar-
ison for 451 predeﬁned attributes5 comparing all users in
DATA-WORLDWIDE with the Facebook’s population world-
wide and the 495 Brazilian users from DATA-BRAZIL with
the Facebook’s population in Brazil. The scatter plot shows
that there is a correlation between the representation of most
attributes in the Facebook population and in our datasets
(worldwide population vs. DATA-WORLDWIDE and Brazilian
population vs. DATA-BRAZIL) with the Pearson’s correlation
coefﬁcient being 0.86 for DATA-WORLDWIDE and 0.87 for
DATA-BRAZIL. We also see that many attributes seem to be
over-represented in our dataset, especially in the case of DATA-
BRAZIL. This is probably due to the fact that users in our
datasets have, on average, more attributes than Facebook users
in general. Our estimated average number of attributes (out of
those examined) per user in Facebook worldwide is 40 (44
in Brazil), while the average number of attributes per user in
DATA-WORLDWIDE is 54, and in DATA-BRAZIL is 75.
To investigate in which aspects our dataset is most biased,
Table III shows for each selected geographical region the
attributes that have the biggest absolute difference in repre-
sentation between our datasets and Facebook’s population in
these regions. We observe that users in Europe, and North
America, which belong to DATA-WORLDWIDE, are far more
likely to be Frequent Travelers, Frequent international trav-
elers or Close friends of expats than the general Facebook
population in these regions. DATA-BRAZIL is more biased
towards attributes that might be hinting towards more afﬂuent
and educated individuals (e.g., People who prefer high-value
goods in Brazil, Science, Books, and Engineering).
Overall, we believe that we collected a sufﬁcient amount
of ads from a sufﬁcient amount of advertisers to draw valuable
conclusions. In addition,
the geographical diversity of our
5We use all Facebook predeﬁned attributes that are leaves in the Facebook
attribute hierarchy, do not have a time duration smaller than 6 months
(e.g., Newlywed (3 months)), and cannot be used by advertisers to exclude
audiences.

data allows us to assess the extent to which some of our
observations are robust across regions.
Limitations on ad explanations: Andreou et al. [22] showed
that ad explanations are incomplete: each explanation shows
at most one targeting attribute (plus age/gender/location infor-
mation) regardless of how many attributes the advertisers use.
This means that explanations reveal only part of the targeting
attributes that were used, providing us—and the users—with an
incomplete picture of the attributes that advertisers were using.
However,
in the same study, authors performed a number
of controlled experiments that suggest—but not conclusively
prove—that there is a logic behind which attributes appear in
an explanation and which do not. Given a targeting audience
A obtained from two attributes a1∧a2, if a1 and a2 come from
different high-level attribute categories (e.g., Demographic,
Behavior, or Interest), the attribute shown follows a speciﬁc
precedence (Demographics or Age/Gender/Location > Inter-
ests > PII-based > Behaviors). If a1 and a2 come from the
same attribute category, the one that appears in the explanation
is the one with the highest estimated audience size. These
observations allow us estimate whether our results about a
speciﬁc targeting type are underestimated or not. We will detail
how this limitation impacts the results throughout the paper.

It is important to mention that the code of our developed
browser plugins is open source as they can be viewed in the
client’s machine, as any Chrome and Firefox extension. We
only collect information about the ads and clearly state what
we collect to the volunteers who install the extensions and
accept our terms. All data collection that we present in this
paper was reviewed and approved by the Ethical Review Board
of the University of Saarland and by the Institutional Review
Board of Northeastern University. Due to IRB restrictions, and
in order to minimize any risk of exposure of users’ sensitive
information, we will not share our data or make them publicly
available.
IV. WHO ARE THE ADVERTISERS?
In order to investigate how the platform is being used we
ﬁrst need to be able to characterize the different advertisers
that use the platform. We brieﬂy look at the advertisers from
two different perspectives, (i) their identity; and (ii) their
categories.
A. Advertisers’ identity
Because advertising platforms have been the vectors for
privacy violations [31], [40], discriminatory advertising [9],
[16], [38], and ad-driven propaganda [19], we begin by ex-
amining who the set of advertisers are and what features they
have that might indicate their trustworthiness. Estimating the
trustworthiness of an advertiser, however, is a difﬁcult task.
Facebook offers a platform where anyone with a Facebook
