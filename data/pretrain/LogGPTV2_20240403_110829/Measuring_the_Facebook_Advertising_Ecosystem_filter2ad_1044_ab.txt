### Ad Explanations
By simulating the click on the "Why am I seeing this?" button of each ad, AdAnalyst collects the explanations that users see for the respective ads. Facebook imposes strict and opaque rate limits on the number of explanations that can be retrieved, which presents an accessibility obstacle to both users and AdAnalyst. To address this, we developed a scheduling mechanism where we collect all HTTP requests that can be used to retrieve explanations and limit the collection to 10 explanations per hour. Additionally, we do not collect an explanation for an ad if we have already collected the same explanation for the same user within the previous two days. This methodology allows us to collect explanations for most ads, but it does not guarantee the collection of every explanation. In total, we collected 84.2K unique ads with their explanations (129.1K for DATA-BRAZIL). We were unable to collect explanations for 4.4K ads (16.7K for DATA-BRAZIL).

We parse these explanations to extract information on the types of targeting used and the specific targeting attributes mentioned. For each targeting attribute, we also obtain its audience size (e.g., the number of Facebook users that satisfy the attribute) from the Facebook Advertising Interface [8].

### Ad Preferences
For each user, AdAnalyst periodically collects information from their respective Ad Preferences pages. From these pages, we gather data about all the attributes that Facebook has inferred about the users. In total, we collected 17.1K distinct interests, behaviors, and demographics (38.2K for DATA-BRAZIL) from all users. The median number of attributes that Facebook has inferred for a user is 310 (615 for DATA-BRAZIL).

### Advertisers
From the ads in our dataset, we extracted 22K unique advertisers (28K for DATA-BRAZIL). Currently, to advertise on Facebook, advertisers must create a Facebook Page, which was not always the case. In total, 99.4% of our advertisers have a Facebook Page (100% for DATA-BRAZIL). These pages provide additional information about the advertisers, including the categories they belong to, the number of people who have 'Liked' the page, and the verification badge (indicating if the advertiser is verified by Facebook).

### Data Limitations
There are two primary sources of bias and limitations in our dataset: one from the users who installed AdAnalyst and another from the way Facebook provides ad explanations.

#### Representativeness and Bias
Representativeness is a critical but challenging issue in empirical studies like ours. We designed a methodology to gather Facebook ads as thoroughly as possible, given our practical constraints. We used two dissemination strategies for AdAnalyst. The first involved distributing it within our social and family circles and at conferences, requiring users to set their Facebook language to English or French. The second strategy involved providing AdAnalyst as part of a system focused on bringing transparency to the Brazilian 2018 elections, with a version that works in Portuguese.

To inspect potential biases in our dataset, we compared the age group, gender, and location of our users (inferred from ad explanations) and their interests, behaviors, and demographic-based attributes (from Ad Preferences) with the global Facebook population. We used the Facebook Ads Interface [8] to estimate the fraction of users in the global Facebook population with certain demographics or interests.

Table I shows the geographical distribution of our datasets across continents and selected countries. While our coverage is not globally representative, we observe some geographical diversity, especially when combining DATA-WORLDWIDE and DATA-BRAZIL. Table II compares the age, gender, and education level of users in our datasets with the Facebook global population. Our dataset is biased towards younger ages (47.4% of users are between 22-30 years old, compared to 32.5% in the global population), men (68.4% male, compared to 57% in the global population), and educated users (71.1% with tertiary education, compared to 35.9% in the global population).

Figure 1 presents a scatterplot comparing 451 predefined attributes for DATA-WORLDWIDE with the Facebook global population and 495 Brazilian users from DATA-BRAZIL with the Facebook Brazilian population. The Pearson’s correlation coefficient is 0.86 for DATA-WORLDWIDE and 0.87 for DATA-BRAZIL, indicating a strong correlation. However, many attributes are over-represented in our dataset, particularly in DATA-BRAZIL. This is likely because users in our datasets, on average, have more attributes than general Facebook users.

Table III shows the attributes with the largest absolute differences in representation between our datasets and the Facebook population in selected regions. Users in Europe and North America (DATA-WORLDWIDE) are more likely to be frequent travelers, frequent international travelers, or close friends of expats. DATA-BRAZIL is more biased towards attributes suggesting affluence and education (e.g., preference for high-value goods, interest in science, books, and engineering).

Overall, we believe we have collected a sufficient amount of ads from a diverse range of advertisers to draw valuable conclusions. The geographical diversity of our data allows us to assess the robustness of our observations across different regions.

#### Limitations on Ad Explanations
Andreou et al. [22] showed that ad explanations are incomplete, showing at most one targeting attribute (plus age, gender, and location information) regardless of the number of attributes used by advertisers. This means that explanations provide an incomplete picture of the targeting attributes. However, controlled experiments suggest that there is a logic behind which attributes appear in an explanation. If a targeting audience is obtained from two attributes \(a_1 \land a_2\) from different high-level categories (e.g., Demographic, Behavior, or Interest), the attribute shown follows a specific precedence (Demographics or Age/Gender/Location > Interests > PII-based > Behaviors). If \(a_1\) and \(a_2\) come from the same category, the one with the highest estimated audience size appears in the explanation. These observations help us estimate whether our results about specific targeting types are underestimated.

### Ethical Considerations
The code for our browser plugins is open source and can be viewed on the client's machine. We only collect information about the ads and clearly state what we collect to the volunteers who install the extensions and accept our terms. All data collection presented in this paper was reviewed and approved by the Ethical Review Board of the University of Saarland and the Institutional Review Board of Northeastern University. Due to IRB restrictions and to minimize the risk of exposing users' sensitive information, we will not share our data or make them publicly available.

### Who Are the Advertisers?
To investigate how the platform is being used, we first need to characterize the different advertisers. We look at advertisers from two perspectives: (i) their identity and (ii) their categories.

#### Advertisers’ Identity
Advertising platforms have been vectors for privacy violations, discriminatory advertising, and ad-driven propaganda. Therefore, we examine the set of advertisers and the features that might indicate their trustworthiness. Estimating the trustworthiness of an advertiser is difficult, but Facebook offers a platform where anyone with a Facebook Page can advertise.
