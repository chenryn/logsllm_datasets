#### Challenge Name
All of them.
#### Issue Description
Whenever I start a new challenge and try to place my curser in the code to
start editing it, my curser won't go to or move to where I need it to go. I
can place my curser somewhere near where I need it and try to arrow over to
where I need it to go, but it gets stuck. Also if I put my cursor on a blank
line between lines of code where I want to add a line of code, it'll start
typing somewhere in the middle of a whole other line. Once I've started
editing the code (in the wrong place originally since I can't get to the right
place), THEN it will allow me to put my cursor anywhere I need it. It's just
annoying.
