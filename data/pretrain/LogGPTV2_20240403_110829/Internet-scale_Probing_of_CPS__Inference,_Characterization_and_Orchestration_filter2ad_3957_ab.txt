B. CPS Security: Cyber Security Approaches
Complementary to the above, the cyber security research
community has also offered various approaches in an attempt
to tackle numerous security aspects of CPS. Such approaches
characteristically put
less emphasis on the control system
dynamics by essentially focusing on the cyber (i.e., com-
munication networks, protocols, data, etc.) perspective. We
classify a number of such fundamental approaches into four
core categories as summarized in Table II and we subsequently
discuss only a few of them, due to space limitations. In
the context of modeling CPS protocols, Yoon et al. [27]
proposed the use of message sequences derived from CPS
communication trafﬁc to capture legitimate plant behavior.
To accomplish the latter task, the authors employed a dy-
namic Bayesian network and a probabilistic sufﬁx tree as
the underlying predictive model. Executed evaluations using
synthetic data demonstrated that
the proposed approach is
able to accurately model normal trafﬁc, ﬂag certain deviations,
and reduce the false positive rate. From another perspective,
several research works investigated secure approaches for CPS
software and memory resources. For instance, McLaughlin et
al. [28] proposed an approach to verify safety-critical code
executed on programmable controllers. The devised approach
initially checks such code against a set of physically safe
measures and subsequently present case studies of abuse in
case of any inferred inconsistencies. In this context, the authors
introduced the notion of temporal execution graph, which
illustrates the consequences of a certain untrusted executed
code. The proposed approach was validated in terms of its
capability to enforce certain common safety properties by
means of experimentation in an emulated environment. Several
other research initiatives exploited CPS process variables for
anomaly detection. For example, Hadˇziosmanovi´c et al. [11]
extracted process variables from a CPS plant to build pre-
dictability models. By leveraging simple regression models,
the authors alerted CPS plant operators of any deviation
in the expected parameters as an indicator of an ongoing
attack. From a data analytics perspective, Almalawi et al.
[29] presented a machine learning approach to infer CPS
attacks. By employing an unsupervised clustering mechanism
based on the k-means algorithm, the proposed approach aims
at distinguishing between consistent and inconsistent CPS
observations. Simulations were conducted to validate the effec-
tiveness of the devised approach. Within the same category of
research works but from an industrial/operational perspective,
the security community supporting the open source intrusion
detection system Snort [30] has also offered and contributed
to various CPS detection rules [31]. The latter aim at inferring
unauthorized requests, malformed packets and rarely used and
suspicious CPS protocol commands.
While the surveyed research works offer signiﬁcant contri-
butions, nevertheless, we can extract (1) the general inadequacy
of research attempts to systematically combine or at least
diminish the gap between cyber and control capabilities for
securing CPS, (2) the lack of empirical data related to tangible
malicious CPS attacks and strategies that are generated from
real unsolicited attackers, which could realistically affect the
stability and security of CPS, (3) the deﬁciency of CPS
security approaches in providing, both, attribution evidence
and threat severity metrics and (4) the lack of such approaches
in providing means for CPS resiliency in the physical realm
during or immediately after an attack. Our presented work
that falls within this category of research works aims at

contributing to point (2) by providing a ﬁrst thorough look
in terms of insights and inferences related to CPS attackers’
reconnaissance strategies, by investigating unsolicited darknet
data.
C. Probing Analysis
In the context of inferring probing events, Li et al. [46]
considered large spikes of unique source counts as probing
events. The authors extracted those events from network tele-
scope trafﬁc using time series analysis; they ﬁrst automatically
identiﬁed and extracted the rough boundaries of events and
then manually reﬁned the event starting and ending times.
At this point, they used manual analysis and visualization
techniques to extract the event. In an alternate work, Jin et al.
[47] considered any incoming ﬂow that touches any temporary
dark (grey) IP address as potentially suspicious. The authors
narrowed down the ﬂows with sustained suspicious activities
and investigated whether certain source or destination ports
are repeatedly used in those activities. Using these ports, the
authors separated probing activities of an outside host from
is generated from the same host. In the
other trafﬁc that
area of analyzing probing events,
the authors of [47, 48]
studied probing activities towards a large campus network
using netﬂow data. Their goal was to infer the probing strate-
gies of scanners and thereby assess the harmfulness of their
actions. They introduced the notion of gray IP space, developed
techniques to identify potential scanners, and subsequently
studied their scanning behaviors. In another work, the authors
of [46, 49] presented an analysis that drew upon extensive
honeynet data to explore the prevalence of different types
of scanning. Additionally, they designed mathematical and
observational schemes to extrapolate the global properties of
scanning events including total population and target scope. In
the context of probing measurement studies, Benoit et al. [50]
presented the world’s ﬁrst Web census while Heidemann et al.
[51] were among the ﬁrst to survey edge hosts in the visible
Internet. Further, Pryadkin et al. [52] offered an empirical
evaluation of IP address space occupancy whereas Cui and
Stolfo [53] presented a quantitative analysis of the insecurity
of embedded network devices obtained from a wide-area scan.
Additionally, Durumeric et al. [54] investigated darknet trafﬁc
to analyze the current practices of Internet-wide scanning.
They generated cyber threat intelligence related to sources
of scanning activity and probed services, among others. The
authors also elaborated on some defensive mechanisms and
provided several insightful recommendations when executing
such activities for research purposes. Furthermore, Dainotti et
al. [55] presented a pioneering measurement and analysis study
of a 12-day Internet-wide probing campaign targeting VoIP
(SIP) servers, while an “anonymous” presented and published
online [56] what they dubbed as the Carna botnet. The author
exploited poorly protected Internet devices, developed and
distributed a custom binary, to generate one of the largest and
most comprehensive IPv4 census ever.
In this work, we extend previous research contributions to
identify a new threat vector; unsolicited sources employing
Internet-scale scans in an attempt to ﬁngerprint numerous CPS
resources. To this end, we devise and implement innovative
methods and techniques, and apply them on network telescope
data to perform a comprehensive measurement and analysis of
a broad list of CPS communication and control protocols.
D. Network Telescope: Measurements & Analysis
The idea of monitoring unused IP addresses for security
purposes was ﬁrst brought to light in the early 1990s by
Bellovin for AT&T’s Bell Labs Internet-connected computers
[57, 58]. However, the topic of telescope data analysis received
further attention after year 2000 [59]. Since then, the focus
of network telescope studies has shifted several times, closely
following the volatile nature of new threat actors. For instance,
some of the important contributions that demonstrate the
evolution of telescope research include the discovery of the
relationship between backscatter trafﬁc and DDoS attacks in
2001 [60], worm propagation analysis between 2003 and 2005
[61, 62], the use of time series and data mining techniques
on telescope trafﬁc in 2008 [63], the monitoring of large-scale
cyber events through telescope in 2012 [64], and more recently,
the study of ampliﬁcation attacks using telescope sensors in
2013 and 2014 [65, 66].
In contrast, this work proposes and evaluates a formal proba-
bilistic preprocessing model for network telescope trafﬁc in an
effort to ﬁngerprint and ﬁlter out misconﬁguration trafﬁc. We
believe that this proposed model is of signiﬁcant value, given
its postulated highly applicable nature in the ﬁeld of Internet
measurements.
E. CPS Trafﬁc Analysis
CPS network trafﬁc monitoring and analysis can be divided
in two main categories, namely, interactive monitoring and
passive monitoring. On one hand, honeypots are an example
of low- to high-interactive trap-based monitoring systems [67].
The ﬁrst CPS honeypot, known as the SCADA HoneyNet
Project, was designed and deployed in 2004 by Cisco Systems
[68]. Digital Bond, a company that specializes in CPS cyber-
security, deployed two SCADA honeypots in 2006 [69]. The
release of Conpot in 2013 has greatly facilitated the deploy-
ment and management of CPS honeypots [15]. While such
honeypots provide an effective mechanism to generate real
CPS attack models, they indeed suffer from two drawbacks.
First, improper deployment of honeypots may introduce se-
curity risks (i.e., malware escaping the honeypot sandbox and
propagating to the production network). Second, honeypots are
4
only effective if they are not detected; there exist substantial
evidence that honeypots can be relatively easily ﬁngerprinted
[70, 71]. In terms of passive analysis, such methods include
the study of network telescope trafﬁc to generate statistics
and trends related to various inferred CPS misdemeanors. The
ﬁrst limited reported network telescope study which addressed
the security of CPS protocols was conducted in 2008 by
Team Cymru [72]. Their report included coarse statistics on
scans targeting commonly used CPS protocols such as DNP3,
Modbus and Rockwell-encap.
In this work, in addition to providing a thorough measurement
and analysis study of probing trafﬁc targeting ample of CPS
protocols, we further propose, evaluate and validate a novel
approach to infer and report orchestrated, stealthy and previ-
ously undocumented probing activities targeting a number of
CPS protocols.
III. PROPOSED APPROACH
In this section, we elaborate on the devised models, ap-
proaches and methods that aim at (1) cleansing darknet data
to prepare it for effective use, (2) inferring and characterizing
CPS probing trafﬁc and (3) identifying orchestrated CPS
probing campaigns.
A. Darknet Preprocessing Model
Although darknet data mostly contains malicious packets
originating from probes, backscattered packets from victims of
distributed denial of service attacks and malware propagation
attempts, among others, it might also include what is dubbed
as misconﬁguration trafﬁc. The latter non-malicious packets
might be caused by network/routing or hardware/software
faults that were erroneously directed towards a darknet. Such
trafﬁc can also be an artifact of an improper conﬁguration
when deploying a darknet. Indeed, misconﬁguration trafﬁc
“pollutes” darknet data as such trafﬁc can not be exploited
for cyber threat intelligence. Further, misconﬁguration trafﬁc
makes it harder for cyber threat intelligence algorithms to
operate correctly on darknet data, which often yields to nu-
merous undesirable false positives and false negatives. Another
drawback of the existence of misconﬁguration trafﬁc within
darknet data, is that it wastes valuable storage resources.
Therefore, in this section, we elaborate on the proposed
probabilistic model that is particularly tailored towards the
goal of preprocessing darknet data by ﬁngerprinting and thus
ﬁltering out misconﬁguration trafﬁc.
In a nutshell, the model formulates and computes two
metrics that aim at capturing the natural and the characteristic
behavior of misconﬁguration ﬂows as they target the darknet IP
space. The model initially estimates the “rareness of access”;
the degree to which access to a given darknet IP address is
unusual. The model further considers the “scope of access”;
the number of distinct darknet IP addresses that a given remote
source has accessed. Subsequently,
the joint probability is
formulated, computed and compared. If the probability of the
source generating a misconﬁguration is higher than that of
the source being malicious (or unsolicited), then the source
is deemed as one that is generating misconﬁguration trafﬁc,
subsequently ﬂagged, and its corresponding generated darknet
ﬂows are ﬁltered out. The above two metrics are elaborated
next.
Let D = {d1, d2, d3,···} represent the set of darknet IP
addresses and Di a subset of those accessed by source si.
First, the model captures how unusual the accessed destina-
tions are. The idea behind this metric stems from the fact
that misconﬁgured sources access destinations that have been
accessed by few other sources [73]. Thus, the model estimates
the distribution of a darknet IP di being accessed by such a
source as
Pmisc(di) =
,
(1)
ns(di)(cid:88)
ns(dj)
∀dj∈D
where ns(di) is the number of sources that have accessed di. In
contrast, a malicious darknet source will access a destination at
random. Typically, deﬁning a suitable probability distribution
to model the randomness of a malicious source targeting a
speciﬁc darknet destination is quite tedious; often a simplistic
assumption is applied to solve this issue. In this context, a very
recent work by Durumeric et al. [54] has demonstrated that
darknet sources will probe their targets following a Gaussian
distribution 1. By adopting that assumption, one can model the
probability of a darknet destination accessed by a malicious
source as
Pmal(di) =
σ
√
1
2π
e−(x−µ)2/2σ2
,
(2)
where σ is the standard deviation, µ is the mean, σ2 is
the variance and x is the location of the darknet destination
following the distribution. Recall that equations (1) and (2)
allow the model to initially capture how unusual the accessed
destinations are. However, further, the model considers how
many darknet destinations have been accessed by a given
source. The latter will be subsequently described.
Given a set of Di, darknet destinations accessed by a
speciﬁc source si, the model eventually aims at measuring two
probability distributions, namely, Pmisc(Di) and Pmal(Di).
The former being the probability that Di has been generated
by a misconﬁgured source while the latter is the probability
that Di has been generated by a malicious darknet source.
Let D1 = {di1, di2, di3} be those darknet addresses
accessed by s1. The model captures the probability P (D1) of
the source generating {di1, di2, di3} as the probability of s1
accessing this speciﬁc combination of destinations knowing
that it targeted three destinations multiplied by the probability
of s1 accessing any three destinations. The latter could be
generalized and formalized as
P (Di) = P (Di = {di1, di2,··· , din} |
|Di| = n) × P (|Di| = n).
(3)
For both, a misconﬁgured and a malicious source, the ﬁrst
term of equation (3) could be modeled as
|Di|) = 1
Pmisc(Di = {di1, di2,···} |
(cid:89)
K
∀dj∈Di
Pmisc(di)

1In the presence of Network Address Translation (NAT), different IP
addresses that are simultaneously probing and generating misconﬁguration
trafﬁc would cause the distribution to be non-Gaussian. This might lead
to falsely attributing probing trafﬁc as misconﬁguration. While we can not
deny or validate this scenario, future work could investigate the empirical
distribution of such phenomena to ﬁlter it out.
