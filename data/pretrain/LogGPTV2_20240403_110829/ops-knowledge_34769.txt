User: I just did a clean install of ananconda 2.0 (python 3.4) on my mac osx after uninstalling the previous version of anaconda. 
I used the graphical installer but the launcher is missing in the ~/anaconda directory.
I tried running spyder and ipython from the terminal but i got long error messages that ended with: 
ValueError: unknown locale: UTF-8
I am a newbie to python programming and this is quite unnerving for me. I have gone through related answers but I still need help.
Guys, please kindly point me in the right direction.
Thanks.
Assistant: You have two problems here:

The Anaconda launcher haven't been ported to Python 3 yet, so that's why you can't find it.
To fix the ValueError: unknown locale: UTF-8 problem, you need to:

Open a terminal
Write this command on it
nano ~/.bashrc (nano is terminal-based editor)
Paste this text in nano:
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
Hit these keys to save: Ctrl+O+Enter, then Ctrl+X to exit.
Close that terminal, open a new one and try to start spyder. Everything should be fixed now.
