I have a question regarding the new is_file_like function and its usage in IO
functions like read_csv
This new change in pandas 0.20 breaks many codes which previously assume that
a file-like object is just an object possessing `read` or `write` method.
Is there any specific reason we have to enforce such conditions?
When making such changes why we have to break the previous behaviors?
