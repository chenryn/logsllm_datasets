### Current Behavior
This is a duplicate of #2632. This has been closed, but I still encounter it
using the latest version of npm.
When running `npm install` in a project that references a `bin` script that
doesnâ€™t exist, the command fails with the error:
    npm ERR! code ENOENT
    npm ERR! syscall chmod
    npm ERR! path /home/remco/Projects/appsemble/node_modules/@appsemble/server/dist/index.js
    npm ERR! errno -2
    npm ERR! enoent ENOENT: no such file or directory, chmod '/home/remco/Projects/appsemble/node_modules/@appsemble/server/dist/index.js'
    npm ERR! enoent This is related to npm not being able to find a file.
    npm ERR! enoent
### Expected Behavior
`npm install` is succesful

    git clone PI:EMAIL:appsemble/appsemble.git
    cd appsemble
    rm yarn.lock
    npm install
