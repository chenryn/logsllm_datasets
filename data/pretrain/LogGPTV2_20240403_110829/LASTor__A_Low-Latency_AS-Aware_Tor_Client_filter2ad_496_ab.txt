### Addressing the Shortcomings of Tor Heuristics

To address the limitations of current heuristics, Tor clients need to determine the Autonomous Systems (ASes) through which internet traffic is routed between them and entry nodes, as well as between exit nodes and destinations. Since we are focusing on client-side solutions, modifying relays to measure routes or querying a route prediction service (e.g., iPlane [12]) is not feasible, as it would reveal the client and destination to the service. Downloading pre-computed AS paths for all possible combinations is also impractical due to the large data size required.

### Techniques for Improving Tor Path Selection

#### Weighted Shortest Path (WSP) Algorithm
- **Goal**: Reduce communication latency while allowing users to balance latency and anonymity.
- **Method**: WSP algorithm probabilistically selects paths with a preference for low-latency routes. The algorithm can be adjusted using a parameter \( \alpha \) that varies from 0 (lowest latency) to 1 (highest anonymity).
- **Implementation**: Use geographical distance as a proxy for latency to avoid the need for extensive latency measurements between relays.

#### Clustering of Relays
- **Goal**: Defend against strategic placement of relays by an adversary.
- **Method**: Cluster relays in nearby locations to reduce the likelihood of adversarial relays being selected.
- **Benefits**: Enhances path diversity and reduces the risk of compromised paths.

#### DNS Lookup Service
- **Goal**: Determine the set of ASes through which internet traffic may be routed between a pair of IP addresses.
- **Method**: Utilize a lightweight algorithm running on PlanetLab nodes to perform DNS lookups and predict AS paths.

### Overview of LASTor Techniques

| Section | Technique | Goal |
|---------|-----------|------|
| IV-A    | Weighted Shortest Path (WSP) | Reduce latency with a trade-off between latency and anonymity |
| IV-B    | Clustering of relays | Defend against strategic relay placement |
| IV-D    | DNS lookup service | Preempt traffic correlation attacks by ASes |
| IV-C    | Lightweight AS path determination | Account for distributed destinations |

### Problem Statement and Datasets

**Problem Statement:**
Our goal is to address the shortcomings in Tor related to latency and anonymity without requiring a complete redesign. We aim to modify the client-side path selection algorithm to provide immediate benefits to users.

**Datasets:**
- **PL-Tor-Web**: 50 PlanetLab nodes as clients, 2423 Tor relays, and 200 websites as destinations.
- **PL-BGP-Rand**: 50 PlanetLab nodes as clients, 378 BGP routers as relays, and 500 randomly chosen /24 prefixes as destinations.
- **PL-PL-Web**: 50 PlanetLab nodes as both clients and relays, and the top 200 websites as destinations.

### Path Selection

**Path Latency Factors:**
- Propagation delay
- Queuing delay
- Transmission delay

**Preferential Selection of Low-Latency Paths:**
- **Method**: Use the end-to-end geographical distance as a proxy for latency.
- **Empirical Validation**: Comparison of end-to-end latencies using geographical distance versus actual latencies shows similar results, confirming the effectiveness of this approach.

**Clustering of Relays:**
- **Issue**: WSP's preference for lower geographical distances can lead to predictable paths.
- **Solution**: Cluster relays to distribute the probability of selection more evenly, reducing the risk of adversarial relays being chosen.

### Empirical Results

- **Fig. 4**: Comparison of end-to-end latency when using geographical distance versus path latency in the WSP algorithm.

By implementing these techniques, we aim to enhance the performance and security of Tor without requiring significant changes to the existing infrastructure.
