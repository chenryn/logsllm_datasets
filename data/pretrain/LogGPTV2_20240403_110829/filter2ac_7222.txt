**Title: Botconf2013 - Efficient Program Exploration by Input Fuzzing**

One of the key challenges in maintaining a malware detection service is the continuous updating of its database. This process requires the analysis of new malware samples. Typically, analysts attempt to reproduce the behavior of the malware in a controlled and secure environment. However, a bot sample may only trigger a malicious function if it receives specific inputs from its command and control (C&C) server.

The goal is to identify the inputs that activate all relevant code branches within the bot binary, thereby revealing its malicious behaviors. From a broader perspective, this problem encompasses both program exploration and message format extraction, which are active areas of research.

In our ongoing work, we are exploring a new approach to achieving code coverage through input tainting. This method aims to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the program exploration process.
