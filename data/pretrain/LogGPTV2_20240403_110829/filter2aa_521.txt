Keyspaces
In theory - 
Number of depths to the power of the number of spaces
E.g. - 
Schlage - 10 depths, to the power of 5 or 6 spaces - 
100,000 or 1,000,000 possible combinations
Medeco - 6 depths, to the power of 5 or 6 spaces - 
7000 or 46000 combinations
There are further limitations imposed by physical constraints!

The Economics of Brute-Force Attacks
Brute force = trying all possible keys
If we have n key codes to try, we need at most n blanks, possibly fewer
●
Blanks cost between $0.13 and $3.00 - the common ones are cheap
●
If you have access to a code cutting machine, the marginal cost of a new key 
cut is the blank + your time
●
If you do not, locksmiths will cut keys to code for $3.00-$10.00 each
E.g. - if you can reduce the keyspace of a given lock to 1000 possible keys, the 
cost might be $450 (you own a code machine, blanks are $0.45 each) or $4000 
(you need to use a locksmith, cost per cut key is $4.00)

Password Re-Use

Key Re-Use
●
Is called “keyed alike” and is a common and accepted arrangement
In a keyed-alike system, the key space is 1!

Information Theory
Shannon Entropy
Information = stuff we know.
Entropy = stuff we don’t know.
We know whether a stop light is red or green.  The colour of a stop light is information.
We don’t know the outcome of a random variable, such as a coin flip or a dice roll.  A coin flip 
and or dice roll has entropy.  A key or password has entropy.
55
Measuring Entropy
Once we do know the information, how many bits on a hard drive will it take to 
write it down (on average)?
A coin flip → one bit
A random number 0..255 → 8 bits
A random number 1..10 → 3.32 bits
3 random numbers 1..10 can be encoded in a number 0..103.
We can use 10 bits to encode 0..1023.  So 10 bits will encode 0..999.
10 bits / 3 random numbers 1..10 ≈ 3.33 ≈ 3.32 bits / random number
56
Measuring Entropy
Number of bits it takes to write down a number 0..x 
 → log2(x)
Number of bits of entropy (H) for a random variable with n outcomes:
 → H = log2(n)
E.g: 
A fair coin flip, 2 outcomes: log2(2) = 2 bits
A random number 0..255: log2(256) = 8 bits
A random number 1..10: log2(10) = 3.322 bits
57
Key Entropy Examples
Number of bits in a piece of information (e.g. key, password) - 
●
8-character ASCII password - 8*8=256 bits of entropy
●
10-digit passcode, 3 characters long - 1000 combinations or 9.97 bits
●
EVVA MCS key, 4 rotors with 8 positions each - 8^4=4096 or 12.00 bits of entropy
●
Schlage 5-pin system - 5^10 or 100000 combinations (16.6 bits)
If there are N possibilities, and all possibilities are equiprobable, then entropy (H) is given by: 
H = log2(n)
If some possibilities are more likely than others, entropy goes down.  E.g., dictionary-based 
passwords; avoidance of deep cut keys; key coding to deter picking
58
Entropy: 2 Possibilities, Unequal Probability
Master key decoded to 14767 or 94767…
When 50/50 chance…
H = -p1 log2(p1) - p2 log2(p2)
H = -0.5 log2(0.5) - 0.5 log2(0.5) = -log2(0.5) = log2(2) = 1 bit.
Are these equiprobable?
H = 0.95 log2(0.95) + 0.05 log2(0.05) = 0.286 bits
In the extreme, if one option is certain, that’s 0 bits!
In general… H = -Σ p log2(p)

Getting a Key Cut
1.
Identify the blank
2.
Determine the bitting code you want
3.
Go to a locksmith (not a hardware store 
or 7/11)
4.
Ask if they can cut you a key by code
5.
Give them the blank and code: e.g. “A Schlage SC1 with bitting code 
0-4-2-8-5”
6.
If they say “that key is restricted, I can’t cut you that”... check out our 
DEF CON 27 talk on Duplicating Restricted Mechanical Keys or wait a 
year for our (tentative) DEF CON 29 part II of that talk.
96
Defenses
●
Avoid very large mastering systems
●
Don’t master high-security and low-security facilities on one system
○
Very high risk locations should be off-master (current requirement for USA nuclear arsenals)
●
A missing lock is as bad as a missing GMK!
●
Consider alternatives to the 2-step system
○
Other specific defenses 
○
If this is in your threat model 
●
Use a restricted keying system - it won’t stop a determined attacker, but it can 
slow them down and drive their costs up
●
Your facility should be secure even if an attacker has the GMK
○
All a lock does is keep honest people honest.  Add alarms, guards, etc. 
●
Use IC or electronic components to make rekeying easier
