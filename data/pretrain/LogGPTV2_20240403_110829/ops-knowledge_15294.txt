User:  In a cloud server cluster, how to ensure load balancing? What load balancers are available?
Assistant: To ensure load balancing of cloud server clusters, a load balancer can be used. The specific implementation principle is to evenly distribute incoming requests to each node in the server cluster, so as to achieve the effect of load balancing. Common load balancers are as follows: 1. Hardware load balancer: usually a specialized hardware device that can be independent of the server. Due to its good performance and stability, it is effective in high-load environments. 2. Software load balancer: it can run on the server or in a virtual machine. Compared with hardware load balancers, software load balancers are less costly, but the corresponding performance will be affected to a certain extent. 3. DNS load balancing: Based on DNS resolution technology, requests are distributed to different server nodes. However, since DNS resolution depends on the cache of the local DNS server, delays may occur in high-concurrency environments. 4. IP load balancing: Based on the technology of IP address, the request is distributed, and different requests are directed to different server nodes. However, due to the limitation of IP addresses, more detailed load balancing cannot be achieved. Common load balancers include: nginx, LVS, F5, etc.
