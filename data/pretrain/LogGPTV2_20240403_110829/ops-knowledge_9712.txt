Question: An Apple device security engineer is discussing the implications of Sealed Key Protection (SKP) and the system's ability to handle legitimate software updates without compromising security. Which of the following outcomes would likely occur if there was an unexpected change in the measured firmware or security configuration components on a device with SKP enabled?
"A": "The system measurement device key (SMDK) would become inaccessible due to the alteration of the hardware register measurements.",
"B": "The Secure Enclave would immediately lock down the device and prevent any form of user interaction until Apple Support is contacted.",
"C": "The crypto-hardware-derived system measurement root key (SMRK) would derive to a different value, causing a 'break' in the key hierarchy seal.",
"D": "The LocalPolicy modifications would be ignored, and the device would continue to function normally as if no changes had been made."
