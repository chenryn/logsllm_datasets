Distance threshold (km)
Figure 17: Increasing the distance threshold allows the
routing of clients to cheaper clusters further away (ﬁgure
16 shows corresponding falling cost)
Figure 16 shows results for a speciﬁc set of server energy
parameters, but other parameters give scaled curves with
the same basic shapes (this follows analytically from our
energy model equations in §5.1; the diﬀerence in scale can
be seen in ﬁgure 15).
6.3 Synthetic Workload: 39 Months of Prices
The previous section uses a very small subset of the price
data we have. Using a synthetic workload, derived from the
original 24-day one, we ran simulations covering January
2006 through March 2009. Our results show that savings
increase above those for the 24-day period.
Figure 18 shows how electricity cost varied with the dis-
tance threshold (analogous to ﬁgure 16). The results are
similar to what we saw for the 24-day case, but maximum
savings are higher. Notably: thresholds above 2000km in
ﬁgure 18 do not exhibit sharply diminishing returns like
those seen in 16. In order to normalize prices, we used statis-
tics of how Akamai routed clients to model an Akamai-like
router, and calculated its 39-month cost.
Figure 19 breaks down the savings by cluster, showing the
change in cost for each cluster. The largest savings is shown
at NYC. This is not surprising since the highest peak prices
tend to be in NYC. These savings are not achieved by always
routing requests away from NYC: the likelihood of requests
being routed to NYC depends on the time of day.
We simulated other server distributions (evenly distributed
across all 29 hubs, heterogeneous distributions, etc) and saw
similar decreasing cost/distance curves.

ulations with diﬀerent distance thresholds. This uses the
future (0%, 1.1) model, and obeys 95/5 constraints.
Dynamic Beats Static. In particular, we see that when
95/5 constraints are ignored, the dynamic cost minimization
solution can be substantially better than a static one.
In
ﬁgure 18, we see that the dynamic solution could reduce the
electricity cost down to almost 55%, while moving all the
servers to the region with the lowest average price would
only reduce cost down to 65%.
6.4 Reaction Delays
Not reacting immediately to price changes noticeably re-
duces overall savings. In our simulations we were conserva-
tive and assumed that there was a one hour delay between
the market setting new prices and the system propagating
new routes.
Figure 20 shows how increasing the reaction delay impacts
prices. First, note the initial jump, between an immediate
reaction and a next-hour reaction. This implies achievable
savings will exceed what we have calculated for systems that
can update their routes in less than an hour. Further, note
the local minima at the 24 hour mark. This is probably
because market prices can be correlated for a given hour
from one day to the next.
The increase in cost is substantial. With the (65% idle,
1.3 PUE) energy model, the maximum savings is around 5%
(see ﬁgure 15). So a subsequent increase in cost of 1% would
eliminate a large chunk of the savings.

7. ACTUAL ELECTRICITY BILLS
In this paper, we assume that power bills are based on
hourly market prices and on energy consumption. Addi-
tionally, we assume that the decisions of server operators
will not aﬀect market prices.
The strength of this approach is that we can use price
data to quantify how much money would have been saved.
However, in reality, achieving these savings would probably
require a renegotiation of existing utility contracts. Further-
more, rather than passively reacting to spot prices, active
participation opens up additional possibilities.
Existing Contracts. It is safe to say that most current
contractual arrangements would reduce the potential sav-
ings below what our analysis indicates. That said, server
operators should be able to negotiate deals that allow them
to capture at least some of this value.
Wholesale-indexed electric billing plans are becoming in-
creasingly common throughout the US. This allows small
companies that do not participate directly in the wholesale
market to take advantage of our techniques. This billing
structure appeals to electricity providers since risk is trans-
ferred to consumers. For example, in the mid-west RTO
Commonwealth Edison oﬀers a Real-Time Pricing program
[26]. Customers enrolled in it are billed based on hourly
consumption and corresponding wholesale PJM-MISO loca-
tional market prices.
Companies, such as Akamai, renting space in co-location
facilities will almost certainly have to negotiate a new billing
structure to get any advantage from our approach. Most
co-location centers charge by the rack, each rack having a
maximum power rating.
In other words, a company like
Akamai pays for provisioned power, and not for actual power
used. We speculate that as energy costs rise relative to other
costs, it will be in the interest of co-location owners to charge
based on consumption and possibly location. There is evi-
dence that bandwidth costs are falling, but energy costs are
not. Even if new kinds of contracts do not arise, server op-
erators may be able to sell their load-ﬂexibility through a
side-channel like demand response, as discussed below, by-
passing inﬂexible contracts.
Selling Flexibility. Distributed systems with energy
elastic clusters can be more ﬂexible than traditional con-
sumers: operators can quickly and precipitously reduce power
usage at a location (by suspending servers, and routing re-
quests elsewhere). Market mechanisms already exist that
would allow operators to value and sell this ﬂexibility.
Some RTOs allow energy users to bid negawatts (nega-
tive demand, or load reductions) into the day-ahead market
auction. This is believed to moderate prices.
Alternatively, customers could enroll in triggered demand
response programs, agreeing to reduce their power usage in
response to a request by the grid operators. Load reduction
requests are sent out when electricity demand is high enough
to put grid reliability at risk, or rising demand requires the
imminent activation of expensive/unreliable generation as-
sets. The advance notice given by the RTO can range from
days to minutes. Participating customers are compensated
based on their ﬂexibility and load. Demand-response vari-
ants exist in every market we cover in this paper.
Even consumers using as little as 10kW (a few racks) can
participate in such programs. Consumers can also be aggre-
gated into large blocs that reduce load in concert. This is
the approach taken by EnerNOC, a company that collects
many consumers, packages them, and sells their aggregate
ability to make on-demand reductions. A package of hotels
would, for example, reduce laundry volume in sync to ease
power demand on the grid.
The good thing about selling ﬂexibility as a product, is
that this is valued even where wholesale markets do not
exist.
It even works if price-diﬀerentials don’t exist (e.g.
ﬁxed price contracts or in highly regulated markets).
However, we have ignored the demand side. How do op-
erators construct bids for the day-ahead auctions if they
don’t know next-day client demand for each region? What
happens when operators are told to reduce power consump-
tion at a location, when there is a concentration of active
clients nearby? In systems like Akamai, demand is gener-
ally predictable, but there will be heavy traﬃc days that are
impossible to predict.
There is anecdotal evidence that data centers have partic-
ipated in demand response programs [3]. However, the ap-
plicability of demand response to single data centers is not
widely accepted. Participating data centers may face addi-
tional downtime or periods of reduced capacity. Conversely,
when we look at large distributed systems, participation in
such programs is attractive. Especially when the barriers to
entry are so low—only a few racks per location are needed
to construct a multi-market demand response system.
8. FUTURE WORK
Some clear avenues for future work exist.
Implementing Joint Optimization. Existing systems
already have frameworks in place that engineer traﬃc to
optimize for bandwidth costs, performance, and reliability.
Dynamic energy costs represent another input that should
be integrated into such frameworks.
RTO Interaction. Service operators can interact with
RTOs in many ways. This paper has proposed a relatively
passive approach in which operators monitor spot prices and
react to favourable conditions. As we discussed in section
7, there are other market mechanisms in place that service
operators may be able to exploit. The optimal market par-
ticipation strategy is unclear.
Weather Diﬀerentials. Data centers expend a lot of
energy running air cooling systems, up to 25% of total en-
ergy. In modern systems, when ambient temperatures are
low enough, external air can be used to radically reduce
the power draw of the chillers. At the same time, weather
temperature diﬀerentials are common. This suggests that
signiﬁcant energy savings can be achieved by dynamically
133routing requests to sites where the heat generated by serv-
ing the request is most inexpensively removed. Unlike price
diﬀerentials, which reduce cost but not energy, routing re-
quests to cooler regions may be able to reduce both.
Environmental Cost. Rather than attempting to min-
imize the dollar cost of the energy consumed, a socially re-
sponsible service operator may instead choose to use an envi-
ronmental impact cost function. The environmental impact
of a service is time-varying. An obvious cost function is the
carbon footprint of the energy used.
In grids that aggre-
gate electricity from diverse providers, the footprint varies
depending upon what generating assets are active, whether
power plants are operating near optimal capacity and what
mixture of fuels they are currently using. The variation oc-
curs at multiple time scales, e.g., seasonal (is there water to
power hydro systems), weekly (what are the relative prices
of various fossil fuels), and hourly (is the wind blowing or
the tide going out). Additionally, carbon is not the only pol-
lutant. For instance, power plants are the primary station-
ary sources of nitrogen oxide in the US. Due to variations in
weather and atmospheric chemistry, the timing and location
of NOx reductions determine their eﬀectiveness in reducing
ground-level ozone [27].
9. CONCLUSION
The bounds derived in this paper should not be taken too
literally. Our cost and traﬃc models are based on actual
data, but they do incorporate a number of simplifying as-
sumptions. The most relevant assumptions are probably (1)
that operators can do better by buying electricity on the
open market than through negotiated long-term contracts,
and (2) that the variable energy costs associated with ser-
vicing a request are a signiﬁcant fraction of the total costs.
Despite these caveats, it seems clear that the nature of ge-
ographical and temporal diﬀerences in the price of electricity
oﬀers operators of large distributed systems an opportunity
to reduce the cost of servicing requests. It should be pos-
sible to augment existing optimization frameworks to deal
with electricity prices.
