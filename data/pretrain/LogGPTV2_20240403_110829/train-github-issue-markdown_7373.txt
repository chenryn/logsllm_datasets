I created a question on SO: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25763600/how-
to-patch-collection-using-symfony2-forms-and-rest
The problem is that when I PATCH the data, the "signature" setting is removed
from the "settings" collection. However, if I do the same with any direct
field of the "user" entity, PATCH request is handled properly (only the field
that is included in the request is being changed, and nothing else is being
deleted or set to null).
Is it anyhow possible to handle this in case of OneToMany collection (i.e. I
want to change only one particular setting or some of them, but not all)?
