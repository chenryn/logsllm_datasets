I recently posted a question on Stack Overflow: [How to Patch a Collection Using Symfony2 Forms and REST](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25763600/how-to-patch-collection-using-symfony2-forms-and-rest).

The issue I'm encountering is that when I perform a PATCH request, the "signature" setting is removed from the "settings" collection. However, if I apply the same PATCH request to any direct field of the "user" entity, the request is processed correctlyâ€”only the included field is updated, and no other fields are deleted or set to null.

Is there a way to achieve similar behavior for a OneToMany collection? Specifically, I would like to update only one or a few specific settings within the collection, without affecting the others.
