## Minimally Reproducible Test Case
This is the code example from the getting started guide. RabbotMQ as a broker
and couchdb as a backend.
    from celery import Celery
    app = Celery("tasks", broker="pyamqp://....", backend="couchdb://...")
    @app.task
    def add(x, y):
        return x + y
# Expected Behavior
The result is stored in the backend.
# Actual Behavior
The following error message is displayed:

    TypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str'
It looks like this function
celery/celery/backends/couchdb.py
Line 77 in 025bad6
|  def get(self, key):  
---|---  
is getting a bytes-like object but a string is needed. I enclosed the key in
str(). Then it worked.
