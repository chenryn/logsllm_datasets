I am experiencing an issue with the auto-completion feature in Atom, where it fails to properly display words containing umlauts (ä, ö, ü). Specifically, the umlaut and any characters following it are omitted from the suggestion. I am using Atom version `0.211.0`, installed via a `.deb` package, on Ubuntu 14.04.

Here is a visual representation of the problem:
