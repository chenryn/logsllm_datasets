User: What is SQL injection attack? How to prevent it?
Assistant: SQL injection attack is a kind of attack method that exploits the loophole that the application program does not correctly process user input data, and executes malicious database operations by injecting SQL statements into user input. It could allow an attacker to access unauthorized data, modify or delete data, or even gain administrator privileges. In order to prevent SQL injection attacks, the following measures can be taken: 1. Use parameterized queries: Before the data entered by the user, use parameterized statements to build SQL queries. Parameterized queries will ensure that only valid parameters are used instead of The entire user input is executed as part of the query, preventing SQL injection attacks. 2. Filter user input: Strictly check and filter the data entered by the user, remove or escape all special characters, such as single quotes, double quotes, brackets, etc., so as to prevent attackers from injecting malicious code. 3. Use secure functions and stored procedures: Perform database operations using secure functions and stored procedures provided by the application and the database itself, which have been designed to prevent SQL injection attacks. 4. Reasonable control of user permissions: Give application and database users minimum permissions to limit their executable operations and access to data, thereby avoiding potential injection attacks. 5. Use firewalls and security software: Install and configure appropriate firewalls and network security software to filter and block malicious SQL query requests and attack attempts.
