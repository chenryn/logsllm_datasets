stimulation by western blot and grey values analysis. The results
showed that the pERK basal levels of c/gMC5R-F254A/H257A de-
creased, but the pERK basal levels of pMC5R-F339A/H342A were sig-
niﬁcantly increased (Fig. S2). We found that the pERK basal levels and
cAMP levels of c/d/g/pMC5R mutants are not consistent, which were in
agreement with previous observation that cAMP production and ERK1/
2 activation are not necessarily related (Yang and Tao, 2016).
We next tested the level of pERK1/2 under the stimulations of
6

ligands. Under the activation of agonist NDP-α-MSH, the pERK1/2 level
of cMC5R-F254A increased, and the pERK1/2 level of pMC5R-F339A
decreased, while the pERK1/2 levels of other receptors and mutants
showed no signiﬁcant change. Meanwhile, under the stimulation of the
antagonist AgRP, there were no signiﬁcant changes in the pERK1/2
levels of c/d/gMC5R-H257A and pMC5R, but cMC5R-F254A showed
increased pERK1/2 level, and the other receptors and mutants showed
decreased pERK1/2 level (Fig. 4). Interestingly, the F254A mutagenesis
from cMC5R and dMC5R showed opposite pERK1/2 response to AgRP
despite of their consistent amino acid sequences. We speculated that
this mutation may aﬀect the location of receptors in cell surface and
thereby result in this diﬀerence. However, the speciﬁc causes are still
not clear at current stage and more investigations is warranted. Taken
together, these MC5Rs and mutants display signiﬁcant species-speciﬁc
phenotypes, which was inconsistent with hMC5R, suggesting that pre-
sence of interspecies diﬀerences would aﬀect the cellular signaling of
MC5Rs. Coupled with the cAMP analysis, we found that D119A in c/d/
gMC5Rs and D204A in pMC5R have no eﬀect on the basal activity of
cAMP and pERK1/2, but loss reactivity to all four ligands, indicating
the key role of these two amino acid residues in cellular signaling.
Importantly, only pMC5R-F339A showed decreased cAMP and pERK1/
2 to AgRP stimulation, and thus can be employed for the screening of
novel antagonists. In addition, the basal cAMP and pERK1/2 signals of
pMC5R-H342A are increased, and the antagonistic activity induced by
AgRP is weakened, suggesting its highly potential as a continuous ac-
tivation mutant (CAM) for future genetic breeding.
4. Conclusion
In conclusion, we successfully cloned c/d/g/pMC5Rs and described
their genetic and protein characters by comparing with hMC5R. To
further investigate the functions of speciﬁc amino acids, 12 alanine-
substitutions mutants were constructed. These cloned genes and their
mutations were successfully expressed in HEK293T cells. Subsequent
pharmacological experiments including cAMP and pERK1/2 analysis
revealed that some speciﬁc mutations would aﬀect the basal levels or
response to ligands stimulation, which would contribute to the devel-
opment of novel ligands and continuous activation mutant. Taken to-
gether, these ﬁnding demonstrated molecular and pharmacological
characterization of poultry and pig melanocortin-5 receptors and their
mutants, providing a new insight into further investigation on their
physiological and pharmacological functions.
