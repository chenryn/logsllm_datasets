**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Web Service

Adversaries may leverage existing, legitimate external web services as a means to relay data to and from a compromised system. Popular websites and social media platforms can serve as command and control (C2) mechanisms, providing significant cover because hosts within the network are likely already communicating with these services prior to a compromise. By using common services such as those offered by Google or Twitter, adversaries can blend their malicious activities into the expected noise of regular traffic. Additionally, many web service providers use SSL/TLS encryption, which adds an extra layer of protection for the adversary, making it more difficult for defenders to detect and intercept the C2 communications.
