Feature Idea
##### COMPONENT NAME
core
##### ANSIBLE VERSION
2.1
##### CONFIGURATION
##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
##### SUMMARY
As ansible has some long keys without shortcuts (like `--vault-password-file`
or `--force-handlers`) it really misses autocompletion. I've found a script
that seem to work fine but had just a quick look on it. It would be really
nice to ship one with ansible distribution.
