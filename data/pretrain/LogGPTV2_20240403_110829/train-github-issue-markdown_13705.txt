I'm not entirely sure where to report this issue, but I encountered a problem when downloading Bootstrap 3.0.1 via Bower. The error message indicates that there is an installation issue related to the `bootstrap/dist/fonts/*` directory, stating "no such file or directory" (fs.js).

To verify that the issue is specific to version 3.0.1, I reverted to version 3.0.0 in my Bower configuration and did not encounter the same problem. 

Could you please let me know the appropriate channel to report this?
