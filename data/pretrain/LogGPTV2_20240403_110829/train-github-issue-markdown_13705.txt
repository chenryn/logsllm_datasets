Not really sure where to possible report this issue. I noticed when i download
bootstrap 3.0.1 via bower there appears to be an install error related to the
bootstrap/dist/fonts/* no such file or directory. (fs.js) -
To test that this is indeed related to 3.0.1 i changed my bower to go back to
3.0.0 and did not encounter this issue.
