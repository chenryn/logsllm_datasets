**Current Behavior**
To share CSS common to all components in an Angular 2 application, the current approach is to:
- Add a stylesheet containing the common CSS to the `index.html` file.
- Alternatively, add the styles to the root component and disable view encapsulation for each component that needs to share this CSS. (Note: I am uncertain if this alternative method works as expected.)

**Expected Behavior**
A well-documented and recommended method for sharing CSS across components. This could be an improvement on one of the existing methods, or a new, more intuitive way to apply root-level CSS that can be easily shared among components.

**Motivation / Use Case for Changing the Behavior**
The primary motivation is to enhance ease of use. Currently, sharing CSS among components involves a significant amount of trial and error, often leading to extensive searching on Stack Overflow. There is also a lack of clear information regarding the advantages and disadvantages of each method, making it difficult to choose the most appropriate solution.

**Environment Details**
- **Angular Version:** 2.0.0-rc.X, 2.0.0 final
