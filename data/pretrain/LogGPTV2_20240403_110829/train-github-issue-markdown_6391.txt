**Current behavior**  
To share CSS common to all components in an angular2 app, we have to currently
Add a to a stylesheet with all the common CSS in the application's index.html
(or add the styles to the application's root component and turn off view
encapsulation for each component that wants to share this CSS? - not sure if
this option works)
**Expected behavior**  
A well-documented and recommended way to share CSS across components - whether
one of the current options above, or a newer option that makes it easier to
add root-level CSS to share among components.
**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**  
Ease of use, trying to share CSS among components now involves lots of trial
and error and stack overflow-ing for me right now, without knowing the
pros/cons of each method.
