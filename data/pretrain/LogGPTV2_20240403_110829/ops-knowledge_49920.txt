User: I am a windows 7 user, so pardon me for my ignorance. I have been trying to help my friend get easy_install working on her Mac OS X laptop. We managed to get everything working for 2.7 with these commands in the terminal:

python distribute_setup.py (which installs "distribute")
easy_install

We tried the same thing for Python 3.2.3:

python3.2 distribute_setup.py
easy_install

But the package gets installed for python 2.7 instead of 3.2.3. From what I know, this is because easy_install only works with 2.7.
On my windows 7, I managed to do all these by going into the command prompt, python32 directory and doing:

python distribute_setup.py

Then going into the python32/script directory and running easy_install.exe directly:

easy_install

This installs the package to python 3.2.3 with no problems.
Question:
What should we be doing for Mac OS X? Is there a Mac equivalent of running "easy_install.exe"?
Assistant: For what its worth on my install of python3 (using homebrew), calling the correct binary was all that was required. easy_install3 was already on the system path, as was easy_install-3.3.
