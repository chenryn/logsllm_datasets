   - **Package Applicability**: For each session, the log reads out the cached package applicability for specific packages. The packages are named in the format `Package_for_KB<KB_number>~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~<version>`.
   - **Applicable and Current States**: The log provides the `ApplicableState` and `CurrentState` for each package. The states are numerical values, with `ApplicableState` indicating whether the package is applicable to the system, and `CurrentState` indicating the current state of the package on the system.
