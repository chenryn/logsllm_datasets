User: What is Security Vulnerability Scanning? How should we prevent and respond to security breaches?
Assistant: Security vulnerability scanning refers to the use of software tools to detect security vulnerabilities in computer systems or networks. Its purpose is to patch potential vulnerabilities in time before they are discovered, preventing hacker attacks, network viruses, and other threats from affecting the system. Measures to prevent and respond to security breaches are as follows: 1. Regularly conduct security breach scans and vulnerability repairs. It is generally recommended to conduct a security scan once a month and update the patching measures in time to ensure system security. 2. Keep the software and operating system updated to avoid unnecessary security breaches. It is recommended to enable automatic updates to avoid forgetting to update. 3. Improve the security of user passwords and network authentication controls. Two-factor authentication is recommended to ensure account security. 4. Conduct security training for systems and networks to improve employees' security awareness and precautions. 5. Guarantee the security behavior of the network, set up firewall and access control to limit network intrusion. In short, to avoid the occurrence of security vulnerabilities, the security of a system needs to be considered comprehensively in order to be able to effectively prevent and repair it.
