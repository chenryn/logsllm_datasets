signals opposed to the major trends and to inspire 
new and more sustainable way of develop them.   
2.3 Co-production of single projections
In line with the second characteristics of user or 
community-based solutions developed above, a third 
aspect of the experience of both schools analysed 
here is characterised by the collaborative production 
of visions with the different populations in which the 
students have been immerged. 
User-centred and even immersive ethnographic-like 
approaches doesn’t necessary lead to bottom-up 
creation of new ideas and visions. Long and in-depth 
user investigations tends to guaranty a more accurate 
understanding of population perceptions, expectations 
and motivations but what is inferred from these 
investigations relates to the subjectivity of who – in our 
case the design students – will interpret and transform 
the results of the investigations into ideas and visions. 
The co-creation posture goes one step further beyond 
a user-centred approach: the future visions are created 
in part by users themselves. The design students 
are acting as enablers: they support the users in 
formulating their ideas, in articulating their scenarios, 
in aligning them with the strategic environment and 
in adjusting the qualities and feasibility of the solution 
envisioned. Co-creation works also as a short-cut ‘from 
field to solution’, often with a proper analysis of pro and 
contras coming after, downstream instead of up-stream.
The particular organisations of the work sessions reflect 
this posture of co-creation with users and stakeholders.

The little team of students and staff from ENSCI was 
equipped with a small van and settle each day in a 
different place: REEDS research laboratory; Politechnique 
high school; Joncherettes neighbourhood committee, 
EPPS local development agency, etc… More than a 
meeting with the stakeholder, the intention was to work 
at their place and co-develop scenarios with them. Each 
session was built in a similar way with first a collective 
building of ideas on sustainable and collaborative living 
between the high tech research campus and the local 
populations and second a construction in the form of 
short stories of future visions from the point of view a 
the specific stakeholder involved. 
“Scheduling strategic design 
work on the field rather 
than in the school is a 
strong asset to ensure that 
the visions shaped by the 
design students are done 
with the stakeholders or 
at least, through the eyes 
and from the posture of the 
stakeholders.”
In a minor level, La Cambre students were hosted at ID 
Campus spin-off project of the business management 
HEC-ULg university of Liège. From there, they were 
able to visit inhabitants and students living in Saint-
Gilles neighbourhood or to receive them at ID Campus 
place for work sessions and collective discussions. 
In both cases, the immersion posture was key to move 
the barycentre of envisioning activities from in vitro to 
in vivo. Scheduling strategic design work on the field 
rather than in the school is a strong asset to ensure 
that the visions shaped by the design students are 
done with the stakeholders or at least, through the 
eyes and from the posture of the stakeholders.  
2.4 A mosaic vision
Forth and last characteristics of the approaches of the 
schools is the production of a vision of sustainable and 
145
inclusive living on the territory through a particular 
and intrinsically bottom-up process based on the 
aggregation of a large number of single projections.
Someone on top of a hill looking around will grasp 
an overview of the landscape. He or she will see 
the articulation of the main parts of this landscape 
villages, fields, forest, connecting roads, etc. Details 
will be seen as part of this general organization of the 
landscape: a house near the field is likely to be a farm; 
people walking along the road are likely going for 
shopping at the village, etc. 
When building a strategic vision, one tends to assume 
the posture of our observer standing on a hill: looking 
from far away to look far away (Godet, 1985) as advised 
in forward looking activities. The main intention and 
advantage of this posture is to extract the signal 
from the noise, to capture macro-structures and main 
articulation assuming that only large phenomenon 
finally matters. This posture induces also bias: 
emerging phenomenon, faits porteurs d’avenir as things 
small for their current importance but large for how 
they may impact on future can hardly be noticed. In 
case they are visible and noticed, they are interpreted 
within the mainstream and macro-trends structure. 
As for our landscape observer, details are read and 
attributed to the big picture: farms to the fields and 
people to the shops. 
The visioning posture adopted during the exercises 
carried out in two schools experimentations is 
radically different. Imagine the landscape observer is 
short-sighted and has forgotten his or her glasses. S/
he can’t embrace the whole landscape. Instead s/he 
will walk across the landscape, visit the farm, meet 
the people walking on the road but also feel the 
atmosphere of the ageing village, meet unemployed 
youths involved in a market gardening association and 
encounter part of the ‘faits porteurs d’avenir’  that will 
determine the future of the territory s/he observes. 
At the end of his/her walk across the territory, s/he 
will also have formed an overview of the landscape 
but a radically different one: the overview is the sum 
of multiple observations of details. It privileges the 
micro structure. Mainstream phenomenon tends to 
appear less predominant and emerging trends tends to 
acquire more weight. Bias are opposite to the ones of 
the previous observer posture: the resulting vision may 
be uneven and sometimes distorted.
A map of the different services has been produced by EPPS to picture how they could integrate in the 
territory
In both schools students have been encouraged to 
adopt the second posture and build a mosaic scenario 
(Jégou, 2010). Like in the mosaic work, they choose 
each little stone for its colour, shape it so that it 
acquires a balance in its own and place it near the 
others. More craftsmen may work contemporaneously 
in building the mosaic. It’s only when the work is 
finished that stepping back and stretching the eyes 
they may see the picture they have produced. In the 
same way, forward looking activities as experimented 
in both schools exercises, generate mosaic scenarios. 
They are constituted by a sum of micro-projections 
presented through short video-sketches: 16 single and 
complementary projections aggregate to constitute 
a vision of integration of laboratory and high tech 
companies advanced research into the daily living 
of Paris-Saclay future campus; 11 similar projections 
picture a collaborative living between students and 
inhabitant in a neighbourhood-campus in Saint-
Gilles. Both mosaic scenarios put forward emerging 
opportunities and realistic visions but slightly shifting 
from what is commonly agreed and expected.  
The EPPS development agency hosted the final 
presentation of the group of student to Paris-Saclay 
Campus stakeholders. They decide to publish the 
micro-scenarios on EPPS website and for that 
spontaneously produced a map, localizing the 
scenarios on the territory and thus bridging the macro-
urban planning approach with the micro design one. 
The resulting tentative map shows a good tentative 
visualisation of what are called here mosaic scenarios: 
a global vision resulting from the integration of 
multiple projections of concrete micro-solutions
3. ACUPUNCTURE PLANNING BY MICRO-PROJECTS 
This second part will build on the experiences from 
both schools experimentations:
• 
• 
• 
• 
In-depth micro-investigations of the 
territory to complete and modulate the 
urban planning approach.
(Re)starting from usages and interactions 
at ‘people scale’ to detect counter stream 
promising signals.
Collaborative production of visions with the 
different stakeholders in immersion in their 
context.
Production of an innovative vision of 
sustainable and inclusive living on the 
territory through bottom-up process based 
on the aggregation of a large number of 
single projections.
It will discuss how these new approaches may renew 
the ways local urban planning and governance of the 
territories is usually conducted.
3.1 Action-based acupuncture and co-creation of the city
A collective projection resulting from the integration 
of multiple projections of concrete micro-solutions 
146
questions the way citizens’ consultation and 
stakeholders’ participation is conducted. The tools 
and design processes adapted from user-centred 
approaches tends to turn upside down both citizens 
engagement and territorial development processes.
A series of principles for the governance of urban 
development emerged from both schools field 
experimentations. We describe here some of these 
principles radically different from current practices. The 
aim of this description is two folds: on the one hand it 
will help to better characterize this hypothesis of new 
emerging posture for territory development. On the 
other hand, these innovative principles will work as 
guidelines to implement this new posture within new 
projects.  
3.1.1 User-oriented simulations
Project representation tools can be classified in 3 main 
categories: sketches capturing a tentative draft in 
progress of the project; technical drawings describing 
the precise specification of the project to ensure its 
execution; renderings suggesting in the most realistic 
way how the finalized project may look like.
These 3 categories can be distributed along an 
axis described by the two polarities descriptive and 
suggestive: technical drawings are mostly descriptive 
and they suggest very little the final result; rendering 
on the contrary have a very strong suggestive 
power but remains very fuzzy descriptions; sketches, 
although less finalized are in a balanced position as a 
suggestive evocation of the final result and a tentative 
description of it.
Territorial development tends to use more descriptive 
tools as urban planning maps, architecture drawings 
and plans with generally a low suggestive capacity 
in particular for non-professional citizens. More 
147
suggestive scale models are expensive to produce. 
Virtual models are more accessible and more and 
more often available. At the scale of the territory both 
tends to require still time and money and appears 
hardly at sketch stage but rather as renderings. In 
conclusion the culture of territorial development tends 
to provide more descriptive representations along the 
project development and suggestive representations 
that speaks to laymen are available mostly at the end 
when the project is finalised.   
The mosaic scenarios 
showing bit-of-life is an 
attempt to grasp large 
systems of interactions in an 
impressionist manner.
The mosaic scenarios showing bit-of-life as produced 
by in the two schools experiences is an attempt to 
grasp large systems of interactions in an impressionist 
manner showing a panorama of very colourful single 
simulations that users are able to aggregate in a 
unified suggestive vision.
These user-oriented simulations of territorial 
development are a good balance between the two 
polarities of the previous axis: it is suggestive enough 
showing with the video bit-of-life of users in context. 
It is descriptive enough thanks to the accumulation 
of many bits-of-life covering as many dimensions and 
issues of the territory as possible.
3.1.1 Vision-based deliberation 
Citizens participation to territorial development 
appears as a very closed approach to the users-centred 
of participative co-design approaches. Citizens are 
involved in a local territorial project development 
process. They tend to be involved possibly at early 
stages of the development to go beyond simple 
conciliation meetings to peace tensions within the 
population when faced to projects in which it was not 
involved before. 
But even if showing many similarities, citizen 
participation processes and user-centred approaches 
belong to different cultures of action. In participation 
processes, citizens are called to take part to the 
decisions as an alternative or complement to the 
representative democracy where the decision is 
delegated to the elected representatives. Citizens voice 
their points of views and are able to influence directly 
the decisions to be taken. They take part for that in 
meetings, forums and any forms of arenas where 
together with other stakeholders they debate in order 
to influence the final result. Their posture is therefore 
mainly the one of shared decision makers. 
In user-centred approaches, citizens seem to adopt 
a different posture: they are voiced as users. The 
techniques and tools involved are based on experience 
of use of a current situations and experimentation 
of new alternative solutions. Rather than external 
participating decision makers, users are in the project. 
The rational of user-centred approach is based on 
citizens’ expertise of usages rather than on their 
legitimacy to take part to the decisions. 
This difference of posture makes a great difference in 
terms of involvement in the territorial development. 
In both schools experiences, citizens and stakeholders 
in general are considered as competent in imagining 
together local developments. Helped (or better 
enabled) by professionals (young designers in both 
cases) they produce the new vision, building on their 
insights and experiences, exchanging within a social 
conversation process and envisioning it through user-
oriented simulations as described above. 
Their deliberation takes place on the emerged vision. 
On the one hand, the object of the deliberation is 
concrete and tangible for all the participating citizens 
as they see in the bits-of-life a direct projection of 
their own ways of living. They can compare and are 
not supposed to decide on speculations: they both 
see what they may loose but also they can envision 
what they may get instead. On the other hand, the 
vision is still open. It can be adapted and further 
developed. The future (their local future) is not in the 
hands of experts and professionals producing opaque 
conjectures. Citizens are in capacity to see limits and 
possibilities, discuss barriers and enablers and interact 
with the experts and professionals of territorial 
development to define which infrastructures would be 
needed and best implement their visions. 
In participation processes, 
citizens are called to take 
part to the decisions as an 
alternative or complement 
to the representative 
democracy where the 
decision is delegated to the 
elected representatives.
These principles suggest active forms of organic 
transformation of the territory far away from the 
implementation of strait-forward visions. They proceed 
in a more iterative way by an acupuncture process 
of micro-projects in synergy, by iterative loops of 
local development process, based on trial and errors, 
unexpected success and also drawbacks.
This organic process may appear less satisfactory 
from many points of view. The rationality of building 
infrastructures commands for big projects and large 
chunks of works to benefit from economy of scale 
whereas more little steps, hesitations, reorientations 
may result in a more expensive comprehensive bill at 
the end. They may require also longer periods of work, 
longer time to achieve a complete development and 
they may be perceived by the population as a nether-
ending work-in-progress. Finally the result itself may 
appear less clear, more of a bricolage with adaptations, 
modifications and trade-offs.
But these conclusions come when comparing our 
hypothesis of a development based on organic 
micro-projects to a successful rational large territorial 
development. And this is without counting with the 
148
many failures of large top-down developments that 
generates more often than acknowledged, non working 
infrastructures underused because the population 
nether engaged in it: suburbs and neighbourhoods 
built from scratch with scarce quality of life and the 
many non-places characteristic of recent territorial and 
urban developments that are generating high social 
and environmental indirect costs to the society.
3.2 Bottom-up visioning and open governance
Scenarios based on a mosaic of micro-visions starting 
from the users points of view generate a collective 
projection on the territory radically different from 
the programmatic approach that usually starts with 
generating urban infrastructures to prompt new ways 
of living. Beyond this oppositions and possible forms
