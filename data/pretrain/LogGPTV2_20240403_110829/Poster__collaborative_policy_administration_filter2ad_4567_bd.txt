### 2.3 Co-production of Single Projections

In line with the second characteristic of user- or community-based solutions, a third aspect of the experiences at both schools analyzed here is characterized by the collaborative production of visions with the various populations in which the students were immersed.

User-centered and even immersive ethnographic-like approaches do not necessarily lead to bottom-up creation of new ideas and visions. While extensive and in-depth user investigations tend to ensure a more accurate understanding of population perceptions, expectations, and motivations, the insights derived from these investigations are subject to the interpretation and transformation by the design students. 

Co-creation, however, goes a step further than a user-centered approach: the future visions are partially created by the users themselves. The design students act as enablers, supporting users in formulating their ideas, articulating scenarios, aligning them with the strategic environment, and adjusting the qualities and feasibility of the envisioned solutions. Co-creation serves as a shortcut 'from field to solution,' often with a thorough analysis of pros and cons following downstream rather than upstream.

The organization of work sessions reflects this co-creation posture. For example, a small team of students and staff from ENSCI, equipped with a van, set up each day in different locations such as the REEDS research laboratory, Politechnique high school, Joncherettes neighborhood committee, and the EPPS local development agency. The intention was not just to meet stakeholders but to work on-site and co-develop scenarios with them. Each session began with a collective ideation on sustainable and collaborative living between the high-tech research campus and the local populations, followed by the construction of short stories of future visions from the perspective of the specific stakeholder involved.

"Scheduling strategic design work on the field rather than in the school is a strong asset to ensure that the visions shaped by the design students are done with the stakeholders or at least through the eyes and from the posture of the stakeholders."

Similarly, La Cambre students were hosted at ID Campus, a spin-off project of the HEC-ULg University of Liège. From there, they visited inhabitants and students in the Saint-Gilles neighborhood or received them at ID Campus for work sessions and collective discussions. In both cases, the immersion posture was key to shifting the center of envisioning activities from an in vitro to an in vivo context.

### 2.4 A Mosaic Vision

The fourth and final characteristic of the approaches at both schools is the production of a vision of sustainable and inclusive living on the territory through a particular and intrinsically bottom-up process based on the aggregation of a large number of single projections.

Imagine an observer on a hill who can see the overall landscape, including villages, fields, forests, and connecting roads. Details are interpreted within this general framework. When building a strategic vision, one often assumes the posture of this observer, looking from afar to capture macro-structures and main articulations, assuming that only large phenomena matter. This approach, however, has its biases: emerging phenomena, though small in current importance, may have a significant impact on the future and are often overlooked or misinterpreted within the mainstream and macro-trends.

The visioning posture adopted in the exercises at both schools is radically different. Imagine the landscape observer is short-sighted and has forgotten their glasses. Instead of seeing the whole, they walk across the landscape, visiting farms, meeting people, and experiencing the atmosphere of the aging village. They encounter unemployed youths involved in a market gardening association and other "faits porteurs d’avenir" (carriers of the future) that will shape the future of the observed territory. By the end of their walk, they form an overview, but it is a mosaic of detailed observations, privileging micro-structures and giving more weight to emerging trends.

Both schools encouraged students to adopt this mosaic scenario-building approach. Like a mosaic, each small stone (or projection) is chosen for its color, shaped, and placed to create a balanced and cohesive picture. Multiple craftsmen can work simultaneously, and only when the work is finished can the full picture be seen. In the same way, forward-looking activities generate mosaic scenarios, composed of micro-projections presented through short video-sketches. These scenarios highlight emerging opportunities and realistic visions, slightly shifting from commonly expected outcomes.

The EPPS development agency hosted the final presentation of the student group to Paris-Saclay Campus stakeholders. They decided to publish the micro-scenarios on the EPPS website and produced a map localizing the scenarios on the territory, bridging the macro-urban planning approach with the micro-design one. The resulting tentative map visualizes the mosaic scenarios, showing a global vision resulting from the integration of multiple concrete micro-solutions.

### 3. Acupuncture Planning by Micro-Projects

This second part builds on the experiences from both schools' experiments:
- In-depth micro-investigations of the territory to complete and modulate the urban planning approach.
- (Re)starting from usages and interactions at 'people scale' to detect counter-stream promising signals.
- Collaborative production of visions with different stakeholders in their context.
- Production of an innovative vision of sustainable and inclusive living on the territory through a bottom-up process based on the aggregation of a large number of single projections.

It will discuss how these new approaches may renew the ways local urban planning and governance of territories are usually conducted.

#### 3.1 Action-Based Acupuncture and Co-Creation of the City

A collective projection resulting from the integration of multiple projections of concrete micro-solutions questions the way citizens' consultation and stakeholders' participation are conducted. Tools and design processes adapted from user-centered approaches tend to turn upside down both citizen engagement and territorial development processes.

Several principles for the governance of urban development emerged from both schools' field experiments. These principles, radically different from current practices, aim to better characterize this hypothesis of a new emerging posture for territory development and serve as guidelines for implementing this new posture in new projects.

##### 3.1.1 User-Oriented Simulations

Project representation tools can be classified into three main categories: sketches, technical drawings, and renderings. These categories can be distributed along an axis described by the two polarities of descriptive and suggestive. Technical drawings are mostly descriptive, while renderings have a strong suggestive power but remain fuzzy. Sketches, although less finalized, balance suggestion and description.

Territorial development tends to use more descriptive tools like urban planning maps and architecture drawings, which have low suggestive capacity, especially for non-professional citizens. More suggestive scale models are expensive, and virtual models, while more accessible, still require time and money. Thus, the culture of territorial development provides more descriptive representations during the project development and suggestive representations mainly at the end when the project is finalized.

The mosaic scenarios showing bit-of-life are an attempt to grasp large systems of interactions in an impressionist manner, presenting a panorama of very colorful single simulations that users can aggregate into a unified, suggestive vision. These user-oriented simulations of territorial development strike a balance between being suggestive enough to show video bits-of-life in context and descriptive enough to cover many dimensions and issues of the territory.

##### 3.1.2 Vision-Based Deliberation

Citizens' participation in territorial development is similar to user-centered participatory co-design approaches. Citizens are involved in local territorial project development, often at early stages to go beyond simple conciliation meetings. However, while there are similarities, citizen participation processes and user-centered approaches belong to different action cultures.

In participation processes, citizens are called to take part in decisions as an alternative or complement to representative democracy. They voice their points of view and influence decisions directly. Their posture is that of shared decision-makers. In user-centered approaches, citizens are considered experts in usage rather than legitimate decision-makers. They are involved in the project, and their expertise in usages is the basis for their involvement.

In both schools' experiences, citizens and stakeholders are considered competent in imagining local developments. Enabled by professionals (young designers), they produce new visions, building on their insights and experiences, and envisioning it through user-oriented simulations. Their deliberation is on the emerged vision, which is concrete and tangible, allowing them to compare and envision what they may gain or lose. The vision is open and adaptable, placing the future in the hands of citizens and professionals who can define the necessary infrastructures.

These principles suggest active forms of organic transformation of the territory, far from straightforward visions. They proceed iteratively through an acupuncture process of micro-projects, iterative loops of local development, and trial and error, leading to unexpected successes and drawbacks.

While this organic process may seem less efficient in terms of cost and time, it avoids the failures of large top-down developments, which often result in non-working, underused infrastructures, poor quality of life, and high social and environmental costs.

#### 3.2 Bottom-Up Visioning and Open Governance

Scenarios based on a mosaic of micro-visions starting from the users' points of view generate a collective projection on the territory that is radically different from the programmatic approach, which starts with generating urban infrastructures to prompt new ways of living. This bottom-up approach and open governance offer a more dynamic and adaptive way to develop and manage territories.
