### Describe the workflow you want to enable
Linear and logistic regression allow l1, l2, or elasticnet regularization.
However, the Poisson regression class (which is amazing to have!) only allows
L2 regularization.
### Describe your proposed solution
Enable flexible regularization choices for the Generalized Linear Models
