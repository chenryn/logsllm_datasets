under three time-of-use pricing schemes including Orange and Rock-
land, Ontario Power Generation [9] (Ontario, Canada), and Paciﬁc
Gas and Electric [31] (California). The simulated environments ob-
served cost savings ranging from 1.8% to 5.2%. This reﬂects the
smoothing of load by the battery, where some amount of the peak
load is shifted into the off-peak hours. Note that the price of energy
is signiﬁcantly higher in California than the other simulated envi-
ronments, and thus the costs are about double that of the upper-mid
Atlantic and Ontario regions. The costs savings of $2 to $10 may
partially offset the costs of the NILL system.
Also contributing to the long-term cost of a NILL scheme is the
cost of battery maintenance and replacement as a function of bat-
tery lifetime. Under a NILL scheme that exercises a lead-acid bat-
tery to between 50 to 80% DOD, the battery can be expected to last
between 500 to 1,000 cycles [7], which equates to one or two years.
One way to extend battery lifetime is to only use NILL when occu-
pants are at home. Additional measures to reduce cycle frequency
are the primary goal of future work for this project.
5.2 Optimizing NILL Parameters
The NILL system simulated in this paper relies on a number of
important parameters for its operation. While some guidance has
been given for parameter choice, such as the calculation of KSS,
others were chosen using expert knowledge. In practice, set rules
should be used to choose KH, KL, and the EWMA parameter α.
The KL value chosen in a low recovery state allows the battery
to recharge quickly to just below a maximum SOC (80% in our
experiments). For many lead acid batteries, optimal lifetime and
performance can be achieved by recharging to between 50% and
80% SOC at a high rate, and then throttling back to charge to be-
tween 90% to 100% [13]. KH was chosen using the previous few
data points from the net load. While this results in a low discharge
from the battery, it is not guaranteed to be minimal. As lead-acid
batteries tend to perform best at a high SOC, KH should be chosen
to maximize efﬁcient performance. The EWMA was used to adapt
KSS over time as the net load caused recovery states. The better
the choice of KSS, the longer a steady state may be maintained.
While we achieved good results with α = 0.5, this heuristic is not
guaranteed to work under arbitrary conditions. Instead, a full im-
plementation should consider techniques such as minimizing Mean
Squared Error (MSE).
5.3 Power Signatures and Disaggregation
Two NILM techniques under research that may pose a challenge
to NILL are power signature analysis and load disaggregation. Power
signature based NILMs collect high-resolution data to detect unique
appliance signatures. One example of a device power signature is
the turn on transient in demand when starting a motor [35, 41].
Similarly, power signatures can be found in loads with a small ca-
96pacitance such as ﬂuorescent lighting and electronic devices [40].
This technique can be highly accurate, but requires equally accu-
rate measurements with a sampling rate of at least 600 samples
per second and a resolution of tenths of amps. In the most extreme
case a signature-based NILM can characterize the line noise caused
by different appliances during transitional phases using MHz sam-
pling rates [32]. As modern residential smart meters simply do not
support the sampling rate or computation needed for detecting load
signatures, we do not consider them further here.
Load disaggregation techniques attempt to ﬁnd the set of appli-
ance loads contributing to a net load by solving a discrete knapsack
problem. Though this technique was originally considered to be
computationally impractical [12], it has recently been demonstrated
as feasible for residential loads [20]. In this scenario, the NILL bat-
tery represents an unknown quantity in the knapsack problem. At
one-watt resolution, there are thousands of possible values for the
battery quantity, many of which will have valid solutions to the
knapsack ﬁtting. Thus, we believe that load disaggregation based
NILMs are not a signiﬁcant threat to the privacy afforded by NILL.
6. CONCLUSIONS
We have introduced a new class of privacy-preserving algorithms
called non-intrusive load leveling (NILL). NILL blinds privacy-
exposing NILM algorithms by removing the majority of useful en-
ergy use transitions sensed by recently introduced smart meters.
Simulations of NILL over real usage proﬁles in four homes showed
that between 1.1 and 5.9 meaningful events were exposed to NILM
algorithms per day. Such features reside amongst hundreds or thou-
sands of false events, making recovery of appliance proﬁles virtu-
ally impossible under current algorithms. Future efforts will ex-
pand on the analysis to explore tradeoffs between different battery
systems and the integration with existing in-home alternative en-
ergy generation technology.

97In the second scenario, NILL is installed some time after NILM,
revealing both NILL and non-NILL load proﬁles over mutually ex-
clusive time span–thus allowing a differential analysis of the pre-
and post-NILL data. Similar to the previous case, the NILM must
ﬁnd the clustering of the NILL data that most closely matches that
of the non-NILL data. Any assumption about the signiﬁcance of
such a correlation, however, can be further leveraged NILL algo-
rithms to cause false inference by the adversary. In the ﬁnal sce-
nario, which is both the least likely yet most advantageous for the
adversary, there may be temporally overlapping NILL and non-
NILL samples. If the non-identical features in these two sample
sets are highly correlated, a linear mapping from NILL to non-
NILL would give a fair approximation of the mapping between fea-
tures. Once again, a NILM’s reliance on any such mapping could
be leveraged by NILL to cause false positive appliance classiﬁca-
tions by adding random noise or phantom features.
A.2 Inference from NILL Internal State
It has been previously shown that the high level behavior of
cyber-physical systems can be determined based on their low level
signaling [36]. Similarly, adversarial NILMs may attempt to infer
properties of the NILL system’s internal state based on features in
the NILL load proﬁle. For example, a sudden spike in feature mass
is likely indicative of a low recovery state. A low recovery state
in turn reveals the state of the battery, i.e. that the state of charge
c ≤ L and rate of charge b(t) > 0. Once the state is known at a
point in time, it is possible to determine the state at any future time
by observing transitions in the target load. The question that re-
mains is whether or not an adversarial NILM can infer more about
d from knowing the internal system state and u, than from knowing
u alone.
To infer anything about d beyond the features already overlap-
ping with u, the NILM must know something about b, because
u − b = d. But can anything be implied about b from knowing
NILL’s internal state? The previous example demonstrated that in
the low recovery scenario it is known that b > 0 and likely close
to the battery’s maximum safe charge rate. However, as was shown
experimentally in Section 4.4, there is already a high RFM during a
low recovery state, making the overlap between d and u fairly sub-
stantial. Whether the remainder of features in u reveal information
about d during a recovery scenario is left to future analysis.
If the NILL is in steady state, then b may be either positive or
negative depending completely on KSS − d. Thus it seems highly
unlikely that a NILM can make inferences based on knowing that
the NILL is in steady state. Finally, in a high recovery scenario,
KH is chosen to be slightly below the most recent several d values,
allowing the battery to discharge at a low rate. In this case, it is
known that b < 0, and that KH − d is fairly small. While this is an
indication that d is a light load for the duration of the high recovery
state, it reveals only the general size of appliances, but not speciﬁc
information as to which appliances or whether they are automatic
or manually operated.

APPENDIX
A. FUTURE NILM ALGORITHMS
The analysis discussed in the previous section only considered
currently available NILM algorithms. Future approaches will apply
more powerful machine learning and data mining techniques. Con-
sider the threat models of as-yet-unknown NILM algorithms that
may use features more proﬁtably or exploit knowledge of NILL to
expose energy usage. In particular, the NILM algorithms consid-
ered thus far have been oblivious to the potential presence of NILL.
This raises the question, could a NILM aware of the operations of a
NILL algorithm recover more information about the actual demand
d from the observed demand u than a basic feature-based NILM?
While the answer to this question is almost certainly yes, it is cur-
rently unclear how this inference could be done, or how it could be
countered.
A.1 Feature Correlation
In the evaluation, we saw that there are features in u that do not
overlap with those visible in d, i.e., the non residual features. To
a basic steady state NILM, these features reveal little to nothing
about the appliance that caused the feature. An adversarial NILM,
however, may be able to learn a mapping from some of the features
present only in u to those in d. This may be done under three sepa-
rate circumstances. First, the NILL system may have been installed
before the NILM. When this is the case, there is no non-NILL
data available for training, forcing the NILM to ﬁrst cluster fea-
tures from the NILL load proﬁle. If a correlation is found between
the NILL clustering and clusters for known appliance features, a
mapping may potentially be found between the two sets.
