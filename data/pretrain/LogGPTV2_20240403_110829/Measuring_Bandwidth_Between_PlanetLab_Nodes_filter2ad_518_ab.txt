Some PlanetLab nodes have imposed outgoing bandwidth limit, ranging from 500
Kbps to 10 Mbps. We observed interesting interplay between the trafﬁc shaper for band-
width limiting and the pathrate probing scheme. In some cases we measured end-to-end
capacity of 100 Mbps even though the source was bandwidth limited to 500 Kbps. We
are further exploring this interaction.
The standard deviation for the second set is much smaller than the ﬁrst set. We believe
the preﬁltering of the nodes for the second set is the main reason as the nodes that showed
extremely low or high capacities in the ﬁrst set were relatively unstable, and could have
been removed from our second experiments. In the second set, we have limited the
number of nodes per site to at most two nodes, and hence we have less number of high
capacity local paths than the ﬁrst set. We can also observe that in the second set, more
than 99% of the paths show the capacity of less than 120 Mbps.
Table 3 shows the capacity measured region by region. We categorize each node into
ﬁve regions: North America, South America, Asia, Europe, and Oceania. In our ﬁrst
measurement set we did not have any node from the Oceania region part of PlanetLab.
On other entries of the table with N/A, no estimates were returned. There were only two
nodes from Brasil in South American region in the second set, and as mentioned earlier,

Fig. 3. Cumulative distribution function of asymmetry factor
capacities of the path to and from these nodes were very low. One might think that pairs
between the same region will have higher capacity than those for inter-regions. The table
however does not show any strong conﬁrmation of that belief. It is also interesting to
see that although the paths from Asia to Oceania show high capacity, the same cannot
be said for the reverse direction.
We now investigate whether the paths between PlanetLab hosts are symmetric in
terms of capacity. For the ﬁrst set, among 12,006 measurements, only 2,172 pairs (4,344
measurements) reported capacity estimates in both directions, and for the second set,
8,758 pairs (17,516 measurements) out of 21,861 measurements returned estimates for
both directions. To understand the path asymmetry, we deﬁne asymmetry factor between
two nodes i and j, αi,j, as follows:
αi,j =
|BWi,j − BWj,i|
max(BWi,j, BWj,i)
where BWi,j is the bottleneck bandwidth from node i to node j.

When the capacity of the forward path equals the capacity of the reverse path (i.e.,
complete symmetry), the asymmetry factor is zero. A high asymmetry factor implies
stronger asymmetry.
The distribution of the asymmetry factor for both sets are reported in Table 4 while the
CDF is plotted in Figure 3. In the ﬁrst set, only 132 pairs (6%) showed α of less than 0.01
and 692 pairs (32%) are less than 0.1. Although about 60% of the pairs have asymmetry
factor below 0.5, there are a signiﬁcant number of pairs with high asymmetry factor. We
further investigated the reason for high asymmetry in 328 pairs that have α larger than
0.5. The PlanetLab imposed artiﬁcial bandwidth limit was reason for asymmetry in 189
of these pairs.
In the second set however, surprisingly large portion of the paths showed high sym-
metry. Nearly 60% has the asymmetry factor of less than 0.05. We believe that the main
reason is, as shown in Table 2, more than half of the capacity estimates were between
80 and 120 Mbps.
Temporal Analysis. Since the measurements from Set 1 and Set 2 were done almost
5 months apart, the obvious question to ask is whether the data suggests signiﬁcant
changes in the PlanetLab infrastructure during this period. Note that we already know
of two signiﬁcant changes - the PlanetLab software version was upgraded to version 3
and the pathrate tool was upgraded to a new version. To answer the above question, we
computed the common source-destination node pairs between the two sets and analyzed
the bandwidth measurements. We found 128 common nodes in the two sets and 3,409
common source-destination node pair measurements.
The summary statistics of the measured capacity for these node pairs common to both
measurement sets are given in Table 5. There are some interesting differences between
the two sets, which could be caused by infrastructure changes, measurement errors or
both. The average capacity between the measured node-pairs increased to 71 Mbps
from 55 Mbps, as did the minimum measured bandwidth, implying an upgrade of the
infrastructure on average. An interesting point to note is that the maximum capacity
between any node pair decreased signiﬁcantly from 1 Gbps to 152 Mbps. This could
have been due to stricter bandwidth limits imposed on PlanetLab nodes. In the ﬁrst set,
the capacity between the nodes planetlab1.cse.nd.edu and planetlab2.cs.umd.edu were
measured to be 1 Gbps, which in the second set is now close to 100 Mbps. We were
300
S.-J. Lee et al.
unable to determine whether this is due to an infrastructure change, imposed bandwidth
limit or measurement error. Diagnosing the causes for these measurement changes is
future work.
While the stated goal of this work was not to verify accuracy of the pathrate tool
(this has been done by other researchers in earlier work), we mentioned earlier that in
some of the measurements in Set 1, the low estimate of bandwidth reported by pathrate
were found to be negative and the authors of pathrate rectiﬁed this in the subsequent
release. Although the negative values do not affect any of our presented results as we
use the high estimate of the bandwidth, it is interesting to note that with the new version
of pathrate, of the 3,409 measurements, no negative low estimates were observed in Set
2, while there were 93 negative measurements in Set 1.
The capacity distribution of the 3,409 common node pairs is given in Table 6. The
biggest changes are in the paths with capacity between 20 Mbps and 50 Mbps and those
with capacity between 80 Mbps and 120 Mbps. From the data presented it seems that
signiﬁcant number of paths were upgraded from the ﬁrst band (20∼50 Mbps) to the
second band (80∼120 Mbps) in the time between our measurements.
As mentioned earlier, given two nodes A and B in this common set, capacity mea-
surements in both directions, i.e., source destination node pairs (A,B) and (B,A) may
not both be available. Of the 3,409 source-destination node pairs common to sets 1 and
2, 661 node pairs (i.e., 1,322 measurements) had bandwidth measurements in both di-
rections and hence the asymmetry metric could be computed for these. The asymmetry
factor distribution is tabulated in Table 7. Again, the second set of experiments show a
signiﬁcantly reduced asymmetry than the ﬁrst set.
Correlation Study. We now study the correlation between bandwidth and latency. Be-
fore we report the result of this study, we explain the motivation of attempting to relate
the delay with bandwidth. As mentioned in Section 1, our ultimate goal is to gain insights
into potential correlation that will enable scalable bandwidth estimation. For example, to
ﬁnd a node whose path from a given node has the largest capacity, instead of performing
bandwidth estimates to all the nodes, can we do the probing to just a small number of
nodes (ﬁve for instance)? Since measuring latency can be done with less probing over-
head with quick turnaround time than measuring bandwidth, there already exist tools
that perform scalable network distance estimation [26]. With these tools available and
