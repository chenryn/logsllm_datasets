Question: "Consider the following code snippet that attempts to mitigate the vulnerability of misinterpreting input: 

javascript
function validateInput(input) {
  // Intended to prevent misinterpretation of input
  if (/^[0-9]+$/g.test(input)) {
    return true;
  }
  return false;
}
 

Which alternative implementation would NOT be effective in preventing the misinterpretation of numeric input?"
 "A": "Using a strict regular expression that also validates the length of the input."
 "B": "Implementing a whitelist of acceptable characters and checking the input against it."
 "C": "Casting the input to an integer type without additional validation."
 "D": "Employing a parsing function that throws an exception for any non-numeric characters."
Answer: C
