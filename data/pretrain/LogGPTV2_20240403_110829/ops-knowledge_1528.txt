User: I have three versions of Python on my Mac: 2.6.1 (built-in), 2.5.4 (Google App Engine development), and 2.7.2 (general Python programming).
I installed BeautifulSoup with python setup.py install. However, only 2.7.2 is able to work with it.
How do I install it for 2.5.4 as well?
Assistant: Set your PYTHONPATH environmental variable to point to the installation you want to install it for, and make sure you're using that version of Python when you run python setup.py install. Something like PYTHONPATH=/usr/lib/python25 /usr/bin/python25 setup.py install.
