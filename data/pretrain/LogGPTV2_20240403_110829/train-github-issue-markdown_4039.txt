I have built a local Flutter engine project and obtained a `flutter.jar` file. I then copied this file to the Flutter SDK, specifically to the path `flutter/bin/cache/artifacts/engine/android-arm64`. However, when I attempt to run a Flutter project, I encounter the following crash:

```
[FATAL:flutter/runtime/dart_vm.cc(422)] Error while initializing the Dart VM: Wrong full snapshot version, expected '6891e4153091f27bfe9ab236374f51a1' found '77ed80617eb2b1627e6c51ae7252c677'
```

I am unable to use the `flutter run --local-engine android_debug` command because my Flutter project is integrated into an existing Android project. How can I properly use my custom engine JAR in this setup?
