There are a lot of parts of CSS that are reused in multiple properties, that
get duplicated in the XML file, leading to code bloat and risk of
inconsistencies.
The most obvious one are the colour keywords which are repeated 42 times in
css-scheme.xml alone (and there are a lot of colours!, and they're included in
other files on top), but there are others such as border-style values (that
are in column-rule, etc.), timing functions (transitions, animations, etc)
Some things already are reused, such as the length units, and hsla,rgba, etc.
Would be nice to expand this.
