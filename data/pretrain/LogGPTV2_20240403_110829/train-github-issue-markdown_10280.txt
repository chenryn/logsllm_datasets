The last line of the developer console displays the following error message:

```

This error is also captured in the `workbench.main.js` file, which indicates that the main thread has sent a message to the worker, and the worker has replied with an error. The relevant log entries from `workbench.main.js` are as follows:

```

The error suggests that there is an infinite recursion or a very deep call stack, likely within the `importAndExportRewriter.js` or `typescriptServices.js` files. This issue needs to be addressed to prevent the application from crashing.
