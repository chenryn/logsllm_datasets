### Title: Government-Mandated Front Doors? A Global Assessment of Legalized Government Access to Data

**Abstract:**

In an era where digital authoritarianism is on the rise, there has been a growing focus on whether private sector companies are required to provide data to foreign governments in exchange for market access. This can range from source code reviews to unfettered access upon request, and it increasingly poses risks to intellectual property and personal data. 

This issue is particularly relevant as significant supply chain disruptions have prompted many companies to reassess their global footprint, with cybersecurity becoming a top priority. As corporations reshore and transform their global operations, integrating government data access policies into their strategic considerations is essential.

But how do these policies compare across different countries? Has the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) inspired more stringent data protection measures, or is the Chinese model of data governance spreading more rapidly, as some argue?

To address these questions, this presentation will introduce a new global index that evaluates countries based on their government-mandated data access requirements. We will discuss the data and factors driving the index and seek community input to refine and improve the model. Given the significant global transformations underway, understanding and addressing government-mandated data access is crucial for managing the full spectrum of global cyber risks.

**Key Points:**

1. **Growing Focus on Data Access:** There is increasing scrutiny on whether private companies must provide data to foreign governments for market access.
2. **Risks and Implications:** Such requirements pose significant risks to intellectual property and personal data, especially in the context of digital authoritarianism.
3. **Supply Chain Disruptions and Cybersecurity:** Companies are reassessing their global footprint, with cybersecurity as a top priority.
4. **Global Index Introduction:** A new global index will be introduced to evaluate countries based on their government-mandated data access requirements.
5. **Comparative Analysis:** The presentation will explore whether GDPR or the Chinese model is more influential in shaping global data access policies.
6. **Community Engagement:** Input from the community will be sought to refine and improve the index model.
7. **Strategic Considerations:** Understanding and addressing government-mandated data access is essential for managing global cyber risks.
