Using DNS data collected through active DNS measurements,
we studied the degree of co-hosting of the current web, and its im-
plications in relation to ESNI’s privacy benefits. Quantifying these
benefits for co-hosted websites using k-anonymity, we observed
that the majority of popular websites (about half of all domains
studied) will gain only a small privacy benefit (k500) include only vastly less
popular websites mostly hosted by smaller providers, while 20% of
the websites, will not gain any benefit at all due to their one-to-one
mapping between domain name and hosting IP address.
We hope that our findings will raise awareness about the re-
maining effort that must be undertaken to ensure a meaningful
privacy benefit from the deployment of ESNI. In the meantime,
privacy-conscious website owners may seek hosting services of-
fered by providers that exhibit a high ratio of co-hosted domains
per IP address, and highly dynamic domain-to-IP mappings.
