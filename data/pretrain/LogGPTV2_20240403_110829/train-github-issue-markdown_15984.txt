Hello,
Why a date field with the options below is it limited. Choice available
between 1902 and 2037?
    $Builder-> add ('date', 'date', array (
        'input' => 'datetime'
        'widget' => 'choice'
        'years' => range (1850,2050) "
    ));
documentation says:
> If timestamp is used, DateType is limited to dates entre Fri, Dec. 13, 1901
> 8:45:54 p.m. GMT and Tue, January 19, 2038 3:14:07 GMT on 32bit systems.
> This is due to a limitation in PHP Itself.
Is it normal that the option datetime have the same limitation?  
For information i use symfony 2.3
Thank you for this great framework.
