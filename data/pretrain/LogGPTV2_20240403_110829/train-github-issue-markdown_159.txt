## Enable mapping a shortcut to a single key (and vice versa)
The expected behaviour would be to set the following mappings:  
Alt + o -> รถ  
Shift + Alt + o -> ร
What works already is the second example, since you can make it to produce
_Shift + รถ_ (which then prints as _ร_ ).  
What doesn't work is the first example, since **key remapping** does not allow
for using shortcut sequences (instead only single keys) and on the other hand
**shortcut remapping** does not allow for a single keystroke be its result
("Shortcut must start with a modifier key" when trying to set _รถ_ as the
result of _Alt + o_ shortcut).
For me the scenario would be to get rid of German QWERTZ keyboards and be able
to do programming with QWERTY, while also being able to type proper German
text with Umlauts. All of that while not having to use a crude keyboard layout
where, e.g.:  
RAlt + q = รค  
RAlt + p = รถ  
RAlt + y = รผ
Maybe the way to go would be to either add another category that allows
intermixed (shortcut -> single keystroke) mappings, or just allow exactly that
for the existing shortcut remapping category.
