### Title: Black Hat US-20: Portable Document Flaws 101

PDF is a powerful and versatile document format, but it also harbors several lesser-known, insecure features. In this presentation, we will delve into the PDF specification to uncover these vulnerabilities. Our systematic and in-depth analysis will reveal the capabilities of malicious PDF documents that can exploit all major PDF viewers.

We categorize our attacks into four main classes:

1. **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks**: These attacks target the host system on which the document is processed, leading to resource exhaustion and system instability.
2. **Information Disclosure Attacks**: These attacks track who opens the document or leak personal data from the victim's computer to the attacker's server. This can include form data, local files, and user credentials.
3. **Data Manipulation Attacks**: These attacks alter form values, write local files on the host system, or modify the displayed content of a document based on the opening application.
4. **Code Execution Attacks**: These attacks silently launch embedded executables on the victim's machine, potentially giving the attacker full control over the system.

Finally, we will propose a comprehensive methodology for systematically protecting against attacks that exploit legitimate but dangerous PDF document features.
