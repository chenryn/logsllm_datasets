User: OS X (Mavericks) has Python 2.7 stock installed. But I do all my own personal Python stuff with 3.3. I just flushed my 3.3.2 install and installed the new 3.3.3. So I need to install pyserial again. I can do it the way I've done it before, which is:

Download pyserial from pypi 
untar pyserial.tgz
cd pyserial
python3 setup.py install

But I'd like to do like the cool kids do, and just do something like pip3 install pyserial. But it's not clear how I get to that point. And just that point. Not interested (unless I have to be) in virtualenv yet.
Assistant: brew install python3
create alias in your shell profile

eg. alias pip3="python3 -m pip" in my .zshrc


âžœ  ~ pip3 --version
pip 9.0.1 from /usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages (python 3.6)
