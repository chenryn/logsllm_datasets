**Reinstalling pyserial for Python 3.3.3 on OS X (Mavericks)**

OS X Mavericks comes with Python 2.7 pre-installed, but I prefer to use Python 3.3 for my personal projects. Recently, I upgraded from Python 3.3.2 to 3.3.3, and now I need to reinstall the `pyserial` package.

### Manual Installation Method
I can reinstall `pyserial` using the following steps:

1. Download `pyserial` from PyPI.
2. Untar the downloaded file: `tar -xzf pyserial.tgz`.
3. Navigate to the `pyserial` directory: `cd pyserial`.
4. Install the package: `python3 setup.py install`.

### Using pip3 for Installation
However, I would like to use a more modern and convenient method, such as `pip3 install pyserial`. To achieve this, follow these steps:

1. **Install Python 3.3.3 via Homebrew**:
   ```sh
   brew install python3
   ```

2. **Create an alias for `pip3` in your shell profile**:
   - Open your shell configuration file (e.g., `.zshrc` or `.bashrc`).
   - Add the following line to create the alias:
     ```sh
     alias pip3="python3 -m pip"
     ```
   - Save the file and reload the shell configuration:
     ```sh
     source ~/.zshrc  # or source ~/.bashrc
     ```

3. **Verify the installation**:
   ```sh
   pip3 --version
   ```

   You should see output similar to:
   ```sh
   pip 9.0.1 from /usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages (python 3.6)
   ```

By following these steps, you can use `pip3` to manage your Python 3.3.3 packages, including `pyserial`.
