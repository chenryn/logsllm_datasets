User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题ssl_error_rx_record_too_long (FF/Django/StartSSL/Windows) I've been trying to get SSL to work but I'm stuck. I tried several solutions offered here and on other Google results but no luck.

I got a free certificate from https://www.startssl.com/, Im using a Windows server, client is Firefox (code ssl_error_rx_record_too_long, other browsers give something less informative). I am trying to use Django but the request never makes it to the server so I think that's unrelated; nothing is displayed in the console. Apache shows no errors for httpd.

The http (not https) version of the site is working normally. Adding :443 to the https request does not change the error.

The (I think) relevant part of httpd config is:

Listen 80

LoadModule ssl_module modules/mod_ssl.so

DefaultType text/plain

&lt;IfModule ssl_module&gt;
    SSLRandomSeed startup builtin
    SSLRandomSeed connect builtin
&lt;/IfModule&gt;

Listen 443

NameVirtualHost 85.223.64.8:80
Include "C:/Users/Mark/Web/Apache/httpd.conf.incl"

&lt;VirtualHost _default_:443&gt;
    # Include expanded
    LogLevel warn
    ErrorLog "path/secure.error.log"

    DocumentRoot "path/www"
    ServerName django.mverleg.nl
    ServerAdmin postmaster@mverleg.nl
    ServerAlias *.django.mverleg.nl
    ProxyPreserveHost On
    ProxyRequests Off

    SSLEngine on

    SSLSessionCache 'shmcb:path/ssl_scache(512000)'
    SSLSessionCacheTimeout 300

    SSLProtocol all -SSLv2
    SSLCipherSuite ALL:!ADH:!EXPORT:!SSLv2:RC4+RSA:+HIGH:+MEDIUM

    SSLCertificateFile "path/ssl.crt"
    SSLCertificateKeyFile "path/ssl.key"
    SSLCertificateChainFile "path/sub.class1.server.ca.pem"
    SSLCACertificateFile "path/ca.pem"

    &lt;Location /&gt;
        UseCanonicalName Off
        ServerSignature Off
        AddDefaultCharset utf-8
        ProxyPass http://127.0.0.1:8081/
    &lt;/Location&gt;
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;


Running test for httpd gives nothing. Error log when restarting:

The Apache2.2 service is restarting.
Starting the Apache2.2 service
The Apache2.2 service is running.
Init: Session Cache is not configured [hint: SSLSessionCache]
httpd.exe: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 85.223.64.8 for ServerName

After which htppd.exe is not running (and hence no errors or response on page request).

If I comment the VirtualHost part, the next line after the above is:

[Wed Jan 04 01:41:52 2012] [notice] Apache/2.2.14 (Win32) DAV/2 mod_ssl/2.2.21 OpenSSL/0.9.8l configured -- resuming normal operations


Any help would be greatly appreciated. I thought everything is set up according to various guides I found so I can't see what's wrong (admitted I don't know much about SSL or httpd settings).

Updated version already implementing some of the suggestions below and show error.

Unbelievable, it broke again... Http sites were working and https site was saying identity could not be verified (which is a step forward I guess). Then I restart the server and back to the old situation (nothing accessible). I reverted the changed (I think so...) and it's still broken. Any chance this is related to caching or storing keys or something like that, as it worked for a while when I added the new mod_ssl? None of this makes any sense, it's driving me crazy... Any ideas? Got a new error:

[Wed Jan 04 03:30:45 2012] [crit] (OS 18)There are no more files.  : master_main: create child process failed. Exiting.

Assistant: SSL clearly isn't enabled at the minute on that IP address on port 443 (http://85.223.64.8:443/ works as plain HTTP).

Please double check you have enabled mod_ssl (via LoadModule somewhere in your configuration, depending on what you're using).

If you haven't specified an NameVirtualHost directive, try using &lt;VirtualHost _default_:443&gt; instead of specifying your IP address.
