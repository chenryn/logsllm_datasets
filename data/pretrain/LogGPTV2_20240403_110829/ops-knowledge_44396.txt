User: When I try installing mysql-python using below command,
macbook-user$ sudo pip install MYSQL-python
I get these messages:

/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/include/python2.7/pyconfig.h:891:1: warning: this is the location of the previous definition
/usr/bin/lipo: /tmp/_mysql-LtlmLe.o and /tmp/_mysql-thwkfu.o have the same architectures (i386) and can't be in the same fat output file
clang: error: lipo command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
error: command 'clang' failed with exit status 1

Does anyone know how to solve this problem? Help me please!
Assistant: At first glance it looks like damaged pip package. Have you tried easy_install instead with the same package?
