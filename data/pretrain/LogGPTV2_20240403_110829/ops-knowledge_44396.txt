When I attempt to install `mysql-python` using the following command on my MacBook:

```bash
sudo pip install MySQL-python
```

I encounter these error messages:

```
/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/include/python2.7/pyconfig.h:891:1: warning: this is the location of the previous definition
/usr/bin/lipo: /tmp/_mysql-LtlmLe.o and /tmp/_mysql-thwkfu.o have the same architectures (i386) and can't be in the same fat output file
clang: error: lipo command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
error: command 'clang' failed with exit status 1
```

Does anyone know how to resolve this issue? I would greatly appreciate any help.

At first glance, it appears that the `pip` package might be damaged or there could be a compatibility issue. Have you tried using `easy_install` instead? You can try installing the same package with the following command:

```bash
sudo easy_install MySQL-python
```

If the problem persists, please provide more details about your system configuration, such as the version of macOS and Python you are using.
