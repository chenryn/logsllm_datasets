In the documentation, on both the CSS and components pages, the terms `btn-lg`, `btn-sm`, and `btn-xs` are referenced. However, in the actual CSS files, these classes are named `btn-large`, `btn-small`, and `btn-mini`, respectively. 

To ensure consistency and avoid confusion, it would be beneficial to update the documentation to reflect the correct class names used in the CSS files.
