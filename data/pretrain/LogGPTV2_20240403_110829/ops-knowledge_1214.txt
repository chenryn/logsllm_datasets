Subject: Transitioning New DC to Primary and Removing Old DC

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am currently working with a machine running Windows Server 2016, which is functioning as a Domain Controller (DC), DNS, and DHCP server. This machine, referred to as AD1 (ad1.mydomain.com), is an older, temporary solution. I have recently set up a new server, also running Windows Server 2016, and installed the same roles (DC, DNS, and DHCP) on it. The new server is named AD (ad.mydomain.com) and has been added to the same domain.

### Current Setup:
- **AD1 (Old Machine):** ad1.mydomain.com
- **AD (New Machine):** ad.mydomain.com

### Repadmin Log Output:
```plaintext
C:\Users\Administrator.mydomain>repadmin /showrepl

```

### Steps Taken:
- Backed up the DHCP database from AD1 using the following command:
  ```shell
  netsh server dhcp export C:\dhcp-db.txt all
  ```
- Imported the DHCP database into the new DC (AD).

### Question:
How do I make AD (the new DC) the primary DC and completely remove the old one (AD1)? Is it sufficient to demote AD1 so that AD will take over all roles?

### Answer:
To transition the new DC (AD) to be the sole DC and remove the old one (AD1), follow these steps:

1. **Transfer FSMO Roles:**
   - Ensure that all Flexible Single Master Operations (FSMO) roles are transferred to the new DC (AD). You can use the `ntdsutil` tool to transfer these roles.
     ```shell
     ntdsutil
     roles
     connections
     connect to server <new_dc_name>
     q
     transfer rid master
     transfer pdc
     transfer infrastructure master
     transfer schema master
     transfer domain naming master
     q
     q
     ```

2. **Demote the Old DC (AD1):**
   - Demote the old DC (AD1) using the `dcpromo` or `Uninstall-ADDSDomainController` cmdlet in PowerShell.
     ```shell
     dcpromo
     ```
     or
     ```powershell
     Uninstall-ADDSDomainController -DemoteOperationMasterRole
     ```

3. **Verify Replication:**
   - Verify that replication is functioning correctly between the new DC (AD) and any other DCs in the domain.
     ```shell
     repadmin /replsummary
     ```

4. **Remove AD1 from the Domain:**
   - Once the demotion is complete, remove AD1 from the domain and shut it down.

### Best Practices:
- It is not recommended to have only one DC in a production environment. Always maintain at least two DCs for redundancy and fault tolerance.
