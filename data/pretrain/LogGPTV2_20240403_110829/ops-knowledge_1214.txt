User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Make backup DC as primary and remove the old primary one Hope you are doing well. I have a machine which is running Windows Server 2016. It is acting as DC, DNS and DHCP. This machine is old and I was using it temporary. Now, I have got my new servers and installed on one Windows Server 2016. I had installed DC, DNS and DHCP on it, and made it as a DC in the same domain for the first machine. So, I am having now:
1- AD1 : ad1.mydomain.com (Old machine)
2- AD  : ad.mydomain.com  (New machine)

The repadmin log as following:

C:\Users\Administrator.mydomain&gt;repadmin /showrepl

Repadmin: running command /showrepl against full DC localhost

I had also backed up my DHCP database from AD1 using:

netsh server dhcp export C:\dhcp-db.txt all


And imported back into my new DC.

My question is, how do I make AD (the new DC) as primary DC and remove the old one totally?! Is is enough to demote AD1 so AD will be the primary?!

Regards,,,

Assistant: Yes, it's enough to demote the old machine. There is no "primary" DC, this is an old concept. All DCs are equal. One DC holds FSMO roles, these get transfered automatically if you demote the machine holding these roles. Be aware that it is not a best practice to only use one DC in a production environment, make sure you have at least two DCs for redundancy.
