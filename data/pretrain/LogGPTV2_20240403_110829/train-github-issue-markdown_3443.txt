 **Florent Ramiere** opened **SPR-6902** and commented
When this method is executed
    @ExceptionHandler
    @ResponseBody
    public String dummyExceptionHandler(Exception e) {
        return e.getMessage();
    }
Spring mvc tries to resolve the view using the method output --> 404.  
As the method is annotated with `@ResponseBody`, it should directly write the
method output to the response.
