integer division by zero returns 0 rather then inf (or some other specially
defined integer infinity constant). This behavior is not consistent with
floats and is mathematically wrong.
Example:
> > > 1/int_(0)  
>  0  
>  1/float_(0)  
>  inf
Is this a bug or there is some good reason why ints behave this way?  
I'm using numpy 1.0.1 and scipy 0.5.2
