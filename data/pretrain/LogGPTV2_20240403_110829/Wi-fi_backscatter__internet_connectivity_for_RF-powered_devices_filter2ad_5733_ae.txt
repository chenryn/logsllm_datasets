the Wi-Fi Backscatter preamble in Fig. 7.
9. EFFECT OF REFLECTIONS ON WI-FI COMMU-
NICATION
Next, we evaluate the effects of the reﬂections created by our
prototype device on communication between a Wi-Fi transmitter-
receiver pair. Speciﬁcally, we stress-test the system when the Wi-Fi
Backscatter tag is at close distances to the receiver.1 Note that in
practice, a Wi-Fi Backscatter device modulates only when queried
by a Wi-Fi reader. However to stress-test the system, we set Wi-Fi
Backscatter to continuously send bits at two different data rates of
1 kbps and 100 bps. Since Wi-Fi uses bit rate adaptation, we ﬁx the
Wi-Fi receiver and the prototype in location 1 in Fig. 13 and move
the Wi-Fi transmitter across the remaining locations. The devices
use their default bit rate adaptation algorithms. We use built in Wi-
Fi of a Lenovo Thinkpad laptop as the transmitter and a Linksys
WRT54GL AP as the receiver. In each run of the experiment, the
Wi-Fi transmitter sends UDP packets for two minutes, and logs
the throughput observed every 500 ms. We compute the average
1Note that we do not evaluate the effect of Wi-Fi Backscatter’s
downlink design on Wi-Fi trafﬁc. Experimental evaluation of the
effect of non Wi-Fi trafﬁc on CTS_to_SELF and CTS_to_SELF on
Wi-Fi trafﬁc has been explored in prior work [10].

Figure 19—Effect of Wi-Fi Backscatter Uplink on Wi-Fi data
rate. The ﬁgure plots the data rates for different locations for
the Wi-Fi transmitter placed in the testbed in Fig. 13. The Wi-Fi
Backscatter prototype is conﬁgured to continuously modulate the
Wi-Fi channel and the plots show the results for three scenarios:
without the prototype, with the prototype modulating at 100 bps
and 1 kbps. The plots show that Wi-Fi rate adaptation can easily
adapt to the variations caused by the prototype transmitter.
throughput by computing the mean across the two minute dura-
tion. In each Wi-Fi transmitter location, we measure the average
throughput both in the presence and absence of our prototype.
Fig. 19 (a) and (b) shows the average data rate as a function of
the Wi-Fi transmitter location, for two different distance values be-
tween the prototype device and the Wi-Fi receiver. Each ﬁgure plots
the data rates in three different scenarios: in the absence of the pro-
totype, and when the prototype transmits at 100 bps and 1 kbps.
The ﬁgures show that while there is variation in the observed data
rate across these scenarios (most notably in location 5 where the ex-
periments were performed with heavy Wi-Fi utilization due to the
presence of a class in the adjacent room), they are mostly within
the variance. We believe this is because Wi-Fi uses rate adaptation
and can easily adapt for the small variations in the channel quality,
resulting from the reﬂections from our prototype.
10. EVALUATING CORRELATION EFFECTS ON
WI-FI BACKSCATTER UPLINK RANGE
Finally, we evaluate the feasibility of extending Wi-Fi Backscat-
ter’s range on the uplink using the correlation technique in §3.4.
Speciﬁcally, we place the Wi-Fi helper (an Intel Wi-Fi Link 5300
card) 3 meters away from the Wi-Fi reader (an Intel Wi-Fi Link
5300 card). The Wi-Fi Backscatter tag encodes zero and one bits
using long code sequences of length N; the Wi-Fi reader correlates
with these code sequences to decode the bits as described in §3.4.
We vary the distance between the Wi-Fi reader and the prototype

Distance between Wi-Fi reader and Wi-Fi Backscatter prototype (in cm)
Figure 20—Increasing the uplink range using the correlation
mechanism in §3.4. The ﬁgure shows that the range can be in-
creased to more than 2 m by using long sequences to represent each

and measure the correlation length at which the observed bit error
rate at the Wi-Fi reader is less than 10−2.
Fig. 20 plots these correlation lengths as a function of the dis-
tance between the reader and our prototype. The ﬁgure shows
that as the correlation length increases, the range at which Wi-Fi
Backscatter’s uplink operates also increases. Speciﬁcally, using a
correlation length of 20 bits, we establish the uplink communica-
tion link at distances of about 1.6 meters between the Wi-Fi reader
and the prototype. The required correlation length increases signif-
icantly with the distances between the Wi-Fi reader and the pro-
totype. Speciﬁcally, at distances of 2.1 meters, we need a correla-
tion length of about 150 bits. While this would reduce the effective
bit rates achieved on the uplink, we emphasize that establishing a
communication link between Wi-Fi Backscatter tags with existing
Wi-Fi devices, albeit at a low rate, is beneﬁcial for a large class of
Internet-of-Things applications.
11. RELATED WORK
Wi-Fi Backscatter is related to work on RFID systems [8, 28,
29], which use dedicated powered infrastructure (RFID readers) to
provide power and enable communication with battery-free tags.
The cost of deploying and maintaining such an infrastructure has
tempered the adoption of these systems. In contrast, the key value
proposition of RF-powered devices is that they can harvest ambi-
ent RF signals (e.g., TV, cellular, and Wi-Fi) and thus eliminate the
need for dedicated infrastructure. Since traditional radio communi-
cation consumes signiﬁcantly more power than is available in RF
signals [23], it has thus far been challenging to connect these de-
vices to the Internet. Wi-Fi Backscatter addresses this problem with
a novel system that bridges RF-powered devices and the Internet.
Wi-Fi Backscatter is also related to recent work on ambient
backscatter communication [17] that enables two RF-powered de-
vices to communicate by scattering ambient TV signals. While am-
bient backscatter can enable a network of RF-powered devices to
communicate with each other, it does not provide Internet connec-
tivity. A naive option is to deploy powered infrastructure devices
that are equipped with both ambient backscatter communication
and traditional power-consuming radios, but this diminishes the key
beneﬁt of RF-powered systems; an ability to operate without ded-
icated infrastructure. Wi-Fi Backscatter enables RF-powered de-
vices to communicate with existing Wi-Fi infrastructure, bringing
us closer to the vision of an RF-powered Internet of Things.
Wi-Fi Backscatter also differs from both RFID and ambient
backscatter systems in that these systems decode backscatter in-
formation from a single continuous signal source, i.e., an RFID
reader or a TV tower. Further, the decoding is performed on cus-
tom hardware that is specially designed for this purpose. In con-
617trast, this paper introduces a method to modulate the Wi-Fi channel
and demonstrates that we can perform decoding on off-the-shelf
Wi-Fi devices. Further, we show how to detect Wi-Fi packets and
communicate using such a capability.
Finally, recent work has demonstrated the ability to harvest
power from ambient signals including TV [26, 19, 15, 25], and
cellular transmissions [27, 23]. More recently, researchers have
demonstrated the ability to harvest energy from Wi-Fi transmis-
sions [22, 21, 11]: [14] harvests and backscatters signals using
transmissions from Agilent 89600 custom 2.4 GHz transceiver
hardware and [22, 11] show the feasibility of power harvesting us-
ing signals from off-the-shelf Wi-Fi access points. Wi-Fi Backscat-
ter builds on this work but is complimentary in that it transforms ex-
isting Wi-Fi signals into a communication medium for battery-free
devices. Speciﬁcally, we are the ﬁrst to establish a communication
link between RF-powered devices and commodity Wi-Fi devices.
12. CONCLUSION
RF-powered devices hold the promise to realize a pervasive vi-
sion of the “Internet of Things” where devices may be embedded
into everyday objects and can achieve computation, sensing, and
communication, all without the need to ever plug them in or main-
tain batteries. This paper provides the critical component in this
vision of RF-powered Internet of Things: an ability to connect RF-
powered devices to the Internet.
We present Wi-Fi Backscatter, a novel communication system
that bridges RF-powered devices with the Internet. We show that it
is possible to reuse existing Wi-Fi infrastructure to provide Internet
connectivity to RF-powered devices. We show the feasibility of our
approach by building a hardware prototype and demonstrating the
ﬁrst communication link between an RF-powered device and com-
modity Wi-Fi devices. We run experiments with off-the-shelf Wi-Fi
devices and achieve communication rates of up to 1 kbps and ranges
of up to 2.1 m. We believe that this new capability is critical for the
commercial adoption of RF-powered Internet of Things.
