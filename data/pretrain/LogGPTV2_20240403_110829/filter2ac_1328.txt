**ATT&CK ID:** M0937  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Filter Network Traffic

**Description:**
Implement network traffic filtering to identify and manage protocols and payloads associated with firmware activation or updating activities. This involves monitoring and controlling data flows to ensure that only authorized and expected firmware-related communications are allowed, thereby mitigating potential security risks.

**Key Actions:**
- **Protocol Filtering:** Configure firewalls and other network security devices to inspect and filter specific protocols commonly used for firmware updates.
- **Payload Inspection:** Employ deep packet inspection (DPI) to examine the content of network packets, ensuring that they match known, legitimate firmware update patterns.
- **Access Control:** Restrict access to firmware update mechanisms to trusted sources and authenticated users, reducing the risk of unauthorized modifications.

By implementing these measures, organizations can enhance their network security posture and protect against malicious firmware updates and activations.
