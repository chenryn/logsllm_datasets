    PowerToy module for which you are reporting the bug (if applicable): PowerRename
# Steps to reproduce
Some files' names end with `_\d` and I want to change their names to `_0\d`.
So I use Power Rename to search for `_(\d)$` and try to change them to `_0$1`
but it doesn't work.
# Expected behavior
Change `_\d` to `_0\d`.
# Actual behavior
They were changed to `_\d$1` and enumerated.
