We're using a custom ShaderMaterial that we clone for each mesh so they can
have unique uniforms.
But it turns out that internally UniformsUtils.clone() is called which clones
the texture parameter. This means each one counts as unique and gets uploaded
to the GPU separately. Not good!
So unless we're going about this the wrong way, it would seem better if
texture parameters were copied by reference rather than cloned as hard to see
anyone wanting to duplicate the textures like this.
