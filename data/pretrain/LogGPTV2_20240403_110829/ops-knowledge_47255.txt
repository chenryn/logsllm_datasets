When running the PyPy interpreter with the optimization flag, you may encounter different behaviors compared to the standard CPython interpreter. Below is an example of how the `assert` statement behaves differently between PyPy and CPython when using the `-O` flag.

### Example with PyPy

```sh
$ ./pypy -O
Python 2.7.2 (a3e1b12d1d01, Dec 04 2012, 13:33:26)
[PyPy 1.9.1-dev0 with GCC 4.6.3] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
And now for something completely different: `` amd64 and ppc are only
available in enterprise version''
>>> assert 1 == 2
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
AssertionError
```

In this case, even with the `-O` flag, the `assert` statement still raises an `AssertionError`.

### Example with CPython

```sh
$ python -O
Python 2.7.3 (default, Aug  1 2012, 05:14:39) 
[GCC 4.6.3] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> assert 1 == 2
```

Here, the `assert` statement is ignored, and no `AssertionError` is raised, as expected when using the `-O` flag with CPython.

### Update for PyPy3

As of October 3, 2021, PyPy3 does support the `-O` flag and will turn off assertion statements. This means that if you use PyPy3 with the `-O` flag, the `assert` statement will be ignored, similar to the behavior in CPython.

```sh
$ pypy3 -O
Python 3.x.y (rev-abcdefg, date)
[PyPy 7.3.4 with GCC 4.6.3] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> assert 1 == 2
```

In this updated version, the `assert` statement is ignored, and no `AssertionError` is raised.

This update aligns PyPy3's behavior with that of CPython when using the `-O` flag, making it more consistent for developers.
