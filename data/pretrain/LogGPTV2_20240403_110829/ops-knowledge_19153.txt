If you're interested in exploring Google App Engine (GAE) with Python, there are several excellent tools that can enhance your development experience. While I have found gedit to be quite satisfactory, especially with the addition of helpful plugins like the Class Browser, it's worth noting that other integrated development environments (IDEs) and code editors might offer more tailored features for GAE and Python.

For a more robust solution, you may want to consider:

- **PyCharm**: This is a powerful IDE specifically designed for Python development. It offers excellent support for web frameworks and integrates well with GAE.
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: A highly customizable editor with a wide range of extensions, including those that provide great support for Python and GAE.
- **Google Cloud SDK with Cloud Shell Editor**: The official Google Cloud SDK comes with an integrated editor, which is particularly useful if you prefer working directly within the Google Cloud environment.

While Eclipse is a versatile IDE, its Java-centric design means that the Python development experience may not be as seamless or feature-rich compared to the above-mentioned options. 

I hope this helps, and feel free to reach out if you have any further questions!
