User: Looking to dabble with GAE and python, and I'd like to know what are some of the best tools for this - thanks!
Assistant: I've  been using gedit and am pretty happy with it, there is a couple of good plugins that make life easier (e.g. Class Browser).    I tried eclipse but its just not the same experience you get with Java.
