User: Please explain what is failover? List several failover scenarios and explain their applicability.
Assistant: Failover is a strategy used to ensure that a system remains available and reliable in the event of a failure. This usually involves transferring load from one failed service/device to an alternate service/device. Here are some common failover scenarios: 1. Redundant failover (Active-Active): In this scenario, multiple devices operate simultaneously in the network and share the load. If one of the devices fails, its load will be automatically transferred to other devices. This solution is suitable for tasks that require high availability, such as load balancing, databases, etc. 2. Active-passive failover (Active-Passive): In this scheme, the system includes a master device and a backup device. If the primary device fails, the backup device will take over its service. This approach is suitable for tasks where it is necessary to ensure that hardware or software failures do not cause excessive system downtime. 3. Cloud Failover: In this scenario, the application is hosted in the cloud and availability and reliability can be guaranteed by seamlessly transferring the load to other cloud services. This approach is suitable for applications that require availability and reliability across multiple geographically dispersed data centers. 4. Data Mirroring Failover: In this scenario, data is replicated to multiple devices/services simultaneously. If one device fails, the data is restored from the mirrored copy and service continues. This approach is suitable for tasks that require data integrity and recovery, such as data backup and archiving. In short, the failover scheme should be selected according to the application scenario, load and availability requirements. Factors such as cost, complexity, recovery time, and reliability must be considered.
