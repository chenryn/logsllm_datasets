7.1 Comparison of Findings with Prior Work
The prior work has made various conclusions concerning the eﬀect of the software
vulnerabilities, and whether they are associated with a certain feature of those
vulnerabilities, including correlation with types, publicity, etc. In the following,
we compare our work and ﬁndings with the prior work across multiple factors,
including vulnerability type, publicity, data source, methodology, and sector.

breaches involving unauthorized access to conﬁdential data, and reported no sig-
niﬁcant reaction to non-conﬁdentiality related breaches. Through our analysis,
we had a similar conclusion. Particularly, we found that vulnerabilities aﬀect-
ing vendor’s stock negatively have descriptions containing phrases indicating
conﬁdentiality breaches, such as “denial of service”, “allows remote attacker to
read/execute”, “allows context-dependent attackers to conduct XML External
Entity XXE attacks via a crafted PDF”, and “allows context-dependent attack-
ers to have unspeciﬁed impact via an invalid character”.
How Publicity Aﬀects Price (Contradiction). There has been several
works in the literature on attempting to understand how the coverage by media
and other forms of publicity for viruses and data breaches aﬀect the stock value
of a given vendor associated with such vulnerabilities. For example, Hovav and
D’Arcy [10] demonstrated that virus-related announcements do not impact stock
price of vendors. Our results partly contradict their claims, as we show that vul-
nerabilities impact the stock value a vendor, sometimes signiﬁcantly (negatively),
regardless to whether such vulnerabilities are announced or not.
Data Source and Eﬀect (Broadening Scopes). Goel et al. [14] and Telang
and Wattal [13] estimated the impact of vulnerabilities on the stock value of a
given vendor by calculating a Cumulative Abnormal Rate (CAR) and using a
linear regression model. Their results are based on security incidents: while both
gather data from the press, Telang and Wattal [13] also use a few incidents from
Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) reports. On the other hand, we

consider a wide range of vulnerabilities regardless of being reported by the press.
Our results show various trends and indicate the dynamic and wide spectrum of
eﬀect of vulnerabilities on the stock price of vendors.
Methodology (Addressing Caveats of Prior Work). The prior work shows
the impact of vulnerabilities using CAR, which aggregates AR’s on diﬀerent
days. However, we refrain from using CAR because of the following. First, CAR
does not eﬀectively capture the impact of a vulnerability, due to information
loss by aggregation. For example, CAR would indicate no-eﬀect if the magni-
tude (upward) of one or more days analyzed negate the magnitude (downward)
of other days. Second, we consider a vulnerability as having had an impact if
the stock shows a downward trend on d1, d2, or d3, irrespective of the magni-
tude. Third, our results, through a rigorous analysis are statistically signiﬁcant.
To demonstrate the caveats of CAR and show the beneﬁts of our approach in
capturing a better state of the eﬀect of vulnerabilities on the stock price, we
consider both Samsung and Equifax in Table 2. On the one hand, the impact of
vulnerability on Equifax on days 2 and 3 was signiﬁcant (−14.02 and −24.09 vs.
+1.52 on day 1), where CAR would capture the eﬀect. On the other hand, such
an eﬀect would not be captured by CAR with Samsung (−0.08 and −0.08 on
days 1 and 2 vs. +2.95 on day 3). Our approach, however, considers the eﬀect
of the vulnerability the stock price over the diﬀerent days separately (and does
not lose information due to aggregation).
Sector-Based Analysis. A general hypothesis is that the cost of security and
vulnerabilities on vendors is sector-dependent. One of the main shortcomings of
the prior work, however, is that it overlooks analyzing the cost based on sectors
of the software industry. By classifying vendors based a clear industry sector, our
results show the likelihood of eﬀect to be high in software and consumer product
industry, while the likelihood is less in the device, networking or conglomerate
industries. Table 4 further highlights the industries with highest losses, by track-
ing losses by individual vendors. Although Table 2 shows that a vulnerability
may or may not have an eﬀect on its vendor’s stock price, Table 3 shows that
individual vulnerabilities may aﬀect the stocks’ value.

Shortcomings. In this study we found a signiﬁcant eﬀect of vulnerabilities on
a given day and limited ourselves to the second day after the release of the
vulnerability in order to minimize the impact of other factors. However, other
factors may aﬀect the stock value than the vulnerability, making the results
unreliable, and highlight the correlational-nature of our study (as opposed to
causational). Eliminating the eﬀect of those factors, once known, is an open
question. Furthermore, apart from the eﬀect on stock, a vendor may sustain
other hidden and long-term losses, such as consumers churn (switching to other
products or vendors), loss of reputation, and internal losses (such as man-hour
for developing remedies), which we do not consider in our evaluation, and open
various directions for future work.
7.2 Breaches and Disclosure
Our analysis of the vulnerabilities show that while vulnerabilities may or may
not have an impact on the stock price, a vulnerability reported by the press is
highly likely to impact the stock price. The diverse results for the vulnerabilities
collected from NVD are explained by the diverse severity of the vulnerabilities,
whereas (1) the press may report on highly critical vulnerabilities that are more
likely to result in loss, or (2) the reported vulnerabilities in the press may create
a negative perception of the vendor leading to loss in their stock value. This,
as a result, led many vendors to not disclose vulnerabilities in order to cope
with bad publicity. For example, Microsoft did not disclose an attack on its bug
tracking system in 2013 [35], demonstrating the such a behavior in vendors when
dealing with vulnerabilities [36]. Recent reports also indicate a similar behavior
by Yahoo when their online accounts were compromised, or by Uber when their
employees and users personal information were leaked. More broadly, a recent
survey of 343 security professionals worldwide indicated that the management of
20% of the respondents considered cyber-security issues a low priority, alluding
to the possibility of not disclosing vulnerabilities even when they aﬀect their
systems [37].
8 Conclusion and Future Work
We perform an empirical analysis on vulnerabilities from NVD and look at their
eﬀect on vendor’s stock price. Our results show that the eﬀect is industry-speciﬁc,
and depends on the severity of the reported vulnerabilities. We also compare the
results with the vulnerabilities found in popular press: while both vulnerabilities
aﬀect the vendor’s stock, vulnerabilities reported in the media have a much more
adverse eﬀect. En route, we also design a model to predict the stock price with
high accuracy. Our work is limited in a sense that we do not consider other
external factors aﬀecting the stock or internal factors aﬀecting long term users
behavior and deriving vulnerabilities cost. Exploring those factors along with
regional diﬀerences in eﬀect will be our future work.
