In 0.9.x queryGranularity when represented as string was defaulting to use
DurationGranularity. Now after the changes in #3850, it is now defaulted to
use PeriodGranularity instead. This change is incompatible w.r.t timezone as
both implementations behave differently based on the user timezone.
Sample code -
        DateTimeZone.setDefault(DateTimeZone.forOffsetHours(5));
        PeriodGranularity periodGranularity = new PeriodGranularity(new Period("P2D"), null, null);
        DurationGranularity durationGranularity = new DurationGranularity(86400000, 0);
        System.out.println(jsonMapper.writeValueAsString(periodGranularity));
        System.out.println(jsonMapper.writeValueAsString(durationGranularity));
output -
    {"type":"period","period":"P2D","timeZone":"UTC","origin":null}
    {"type":"duration","duration":86400000,"origin":"1970-01-01T05:00:00.000+05:00"}
Notice the origin in both the versions, PeriodGranularity defaults to UTC
timezone if no timezone is specified explicitly while DurationGranularity
defaults to the user timezone.
