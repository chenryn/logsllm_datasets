sensors originally, and r (·) denotes the randomizing function.
A prime example of a TX Randomization Detection scheme
is a time-based randomization scheme ﬁrst shown by Shoukry
et al. [106]. In the scheme, the sensor randomly ceases all
stimulus transmission. Then, any received stimulus during this
pause indicates the presence of an attack. While attackers
with higher capabilities may still overcome this scheme [108],
it would greatly increase attack difﬁculty. Other work has
proposed the same time-based randomization scheme [87] for
medical infusion pumps. In the same line, Xu et al. [68]
proposed physical shift authentication to detect transduction
attacks on automotive ultrasonic sensors by randomizing sev-
eral waveform parameters.
Verifying Actuation. A system with both sensor(s) and
actuator(s) may detect attacks by probing the surroundings
periodically. Essentially, the actuator delivers a probing signal
to the surrounding environment and compares the measured
response with an expected response. A vast difference between
expected and measured signals indicates the presence of an
attack. The transfer-function notation is similar to that of
detection by TX randomization, in χ (x(cid:48), n + a(cid:48); t (x0)) form,
where x0 indicates the preset probing signal and t(·) denotes
the function that converts the probing signal to the environ-
mental response. Prior work has suggested various forms of
verifying actuation detection schemes. Foo Kune et al. [47]
proposed the adoption of a cardiac probe that cross-checks
whether cardiac signal readings coincide with the expected
values after some sort of investigative actuation to the cardiac
tissue. In the same line, Muniraj et al. [107] suggested an
active detection method, which detects the attack based on
“judiciously designed excitation signals” superimposed on the
control signal.
Detecting Out-of-band Signals. Defenders may come up
with an additional receiver that detects targeted out-of-band
signals. For example, as suggested by prior work [44], [86],
adopting an additional microphone can detect resonating sound
against MEMS sensors. Since sensors require only in-band
(cid:32) Applicable (cid:35) Not applicable
stimuli to function, detecting out-of-band signals do not affect
sensors’ functionality, and there can be many other variations
according to the targeted out-of-band signals.
2) Detecting Measurement Shaping Steps: Previous work
describes how to detect certain measurement shaping steps.
Saturation Detection. Several previous studies suggest
saturation detection as a defense [45], [70], [87]. Saturating
a component leaves the component in an abnormal state, that
may be easily detectable with hardware or software support.
The saturation detection function, χsat, monitors if the input
of a vulnerable component exceeds a threshold, e.g., a voltage
level. Assuming the ith component
is saturated, χsat can
inequality as shown in Eq. (9),
be modeled as a logical
where A (xi, ni + a(cid:48)
i) denotes the intensity of combined xi
and ni + a(cid:48)
i, and ε is the saturation threshold.
χsat (x(cid:48), n + a(cid:48)) = A (xi, ni + a(cid:48)
i) > ε
(9)
Detecting IMD Features. Studies have shown that attacks
exploiting intermodulation distortion (IMD) for signal demod-
ulation could leave identifying features in analog signals.
Zhang et al. [90] proposed to search for features of IMD
demodulated voice signals by the intensity at high frequencies
(500 Hz to 1 kHz), and Roy et al. [91] suggested to search
for signal correlation in the sub-50 Hz band. These features
are introduced by IMD and may not be easily erased.
B. Prevention Methods
Prevention methods ensure proper sensor output even in the
presence of a transduction attack, generally by attenuating ma-
licious signals either inside or outside of the sensor. Prevention
methods can roughly be modeled as three types:
P1: Component Modiﬁcation. A defender modiﬁes an
existing component to reduce an attacker’s ability to exploit
that function. Assuming the vulnerable ith component (fi) is
improved (f(cid:48)
i), these defenses can be expressed as below.

to sensors that
stimuli, thus increasing injection difﬁculty while allowing the
transducer to remain exposed to intended physical stimuli.
Examination of previous work shows that
these reduction
methods can be classiﬁed further into spatial, temporal, and
spectral categories. Spatial attack surface reduction attempts
to conﬁne transducer exposure only to the direction of the
physical stimuli to measure. Spatial methods are especially
relevant
take readings from their ﬁeld of
view piece by piece. For example, Shin et al. [45] suggested
increasing the directivity of internal receivers/transmitters and
removing curved reception glass in lidars. Similarly,
tem-
poral reduction limits the duration of transducer exposure,
and spectral reduction limits the bandwidth of stimulus the
transducer is exposed to. Petit et al. [46] proposed limiting
lidar reception time (temporal reduction) and ﬁltering out
unwanted light frequencies (spectral reduction). Unlike spatial
reduction, temporal reduction would correspond to Component
Modiﬁcation because reducing the effective duration can be
implemented without additional hardware. Likewise, Spectral
reduction may also be implemented by Component Modiﬁca-
tion when reducing the bandwidth to which the transducer is
exposed is feasible without adopting new hardware.
2) Filtering: Filtering aims to attenuate malicious analog
signals within the sensor without attenuating the legitimate
signals. These defenses are suitable for sensors that focus only
on a speciﬁc part of the analog signal, e.g., a speciﬁc frequency
band. In terms of transfer-function representation, ﬁltering
defenses correspond to Component Modiﬁcation (when im-
proving existing ﬁlters) and Component Addition (when an
additional ﬁlter is adopted).
LPF/HPF/BPF. A defender can use low/high/band-pass
ﬁlters to attenuate frequency bands containing only noise or
malicious signals. In addition, they may also mitigate IMD
and aliasing by blocking frequencies that possibly induce
such phenomena. Previous work suggests a variety of relevant
applications for these ﬁlters [47], [59], [90].
Adaptive Filtering. A defender may be able to use
adaptive ﬁltering to attenuate injected signals when simple
low/high/band-pass ﬁlters are inapplicable. In the context
of transduction attacks, adaptive ﬁltering methods typically
ﬁnd some reference of a malicious signal and then use this
reference to ﬁlter it out. For example, a defender may augment
a microphone with an additional wire to clearly receive an
attacker’s electromagnetic wave signal, and then use this
reference to ﬁlter the malicious analog signal on the sensing
path [47]. Alternatively, differential signaling can be employed
to cancel out the injected signal [42], [47]. Other work has also
employed adaptive ﬁltering in additional contexts [44], [86].
Out-of-phase Sampling. A defender may make an analog-
to-digital converter (ADC) adopt a special sampling pattern
related to the frequency to which the injected signals are
conﬁned. This strategy can mitigate attacks that exploit ADC
aliasing for output control (Section IV-D4) as shown by
Trippel et al. [59].
3) Randomization: Adding randomness can often mitigate
attacker inﬂuence on sensor output. Randomness can be ap-
Fig. 3: Example of fused transfer-function chains. N chains with different
numbers of internal components (m1 through mN ) are synthesized together
by the combining function C to produce an intermediary output xc. This
intermediary output then undergoes M more transfer functions (fc1 through
fcM ) to yield the ﬁnal combined output yc.

denotes the input to fi under attack and xi+1 is the
where xadv
output of fi without an attack. Thus, modiﬁcation (fi → f(cid:48)
i)
reduces an attack’s effect on output (Eq. (10)).
P2: Component Addition. A defender inserts a new
component to reduce the effect of the attack on subsequent
components. In terms of transfer function representation, this
type of defenses can be represented as below.
|f(cid:48)(x1, n + a(cid:48)) − y| (cid:28) |f (x1, n + a(cid:48)) − y|,
(11)
where f(cid:48) is a new transfer function of the sensor obtained
by adopting the new component, and y is the sensor output
without attack in Fig. 2.
P3: Component Fusion. A defender fuses multiple chains
of components, either full chains or parts of chains, to produce
a new combined output. Fig. 3 illustrates an example of com-
bining chains. N chains of transfer functions are synthesized
together to produce an intermediary output xc, which is then
processed by additional M transfer functions to yield the ﬁnal
output yc. Throughout the combining process, the effect of the
attack becomes suppressed in the ﬁnal output, yc.
In the remainder of this section, we introduce various
prevention methods built on Component Modiﬁcation, Com-
ponent Addition, and Component Fusion.
1) Shielding: Shielding mitigates injection steps by reduc-
ing exposure to external physical signals. It can be a simple
solution to mitigate transduction attacks, but occasionally re-
quired hardware changes may be inadequate [86] or too costly
to implement. Shielding typically adds additional hardware
and thus corresponds to Component Addition.
Physical Barriers. A defender may add situation-speciﬁc
barriers to attenuate external physical signals, e.g., using a
Faraday cage to block electromagnetic signals. However, by
design some sensors must be exposed to the outer environ-
ment, and thus physical barriers may not always be applicable.
For example, a defender cannot block a lidar from lasers as
the lidar needs to sense echoes of its own transmitted lasers
to function. Previously discussed physical barriers include
shielding conducting wires [47], acoustic damping [42], [44],
[86], and optical shielding [87].
Attack Surface Reduction. Reducing the attack surface
area selectively limits transducer exposure to external physical

digital backends such as microcontrollers. This defense can
be subdivided into receiver-chain (RX) and transmitter-chain
(TX) randomization based on where the randomness is applied.
RX Randomization. RX randomization applies randomness
to RX control parameters and can effectively deal with attacks
where the injected signals can only be partially controlled,
e.g., the raw injected signal is ﬂuctuated randomly instead
of a controllable bias [59] or only a fraction of the injected
signal is controllable [98]. Under such partially controllable
cases, attackers often exploit the predictable property of a
certain component, e.g., sampling points of an ADC. Thus,
randomizing the exploitable property may prevent full sensor
output control. These defenses correspond to Component Mod-
iﬁcation because randomness can generally be adopted without
any additional components. RX randomization can mitigate
ADC aliasing as suggested by prior work on accelerom-
eters and gyroscopes [43], [59]. Randomizing the ADC’s
sampling intervals prevents an attacker from predicting the
exact quantization timing, increasing the difﬁculty of inducing
controllable bias to the output. However, RX randomization
may have other applications. Davidson et al. [98] suggested
using a random sample consensus (RANSAC) [109] to defend
a transduction attack on optical ﬂow sensors based on the
Lucas-Kanade method [110]. To extract true optical ﬂow from
the corrupted transducer output, RANSAC randomly picks a
subset of features to form hypotheses, then makes all other
features to vote for them.
TX Randomization. Prevention and detection by TX ran-
domization operate on similar principles, but prevention by
TX randomization (TX randomization in short) focuses more
on enhancing the resiliency of sensors against attacks rather
than detecting them. When randomness is added to various
parameters (e.g., direction, waveform, and frequency) of the
transmitted signal,
the sensor itself, aware of the random
pattern, can selectively concentrate only on meaningful infor-
mation. In contrast, attackers unable to identify the random
pattern embedded in the signal may not be as effective. TX
randomization often corresponds to Component Modiﬁcation,
but may also correspond to Component Addition (e.g., adding
actuators for spatial randomization). It also should be noted
that the modiﬁed transfer function lies not in the receiver but in
the transmitter chain. TX randomization has long been utilized
for military applications, especially for radars [111], and for
additional applications. The physical shift authentication [68]
can recover real echoes in the received signal of an ultrasonic
sensor. Petit et al. and Shin et al. [45], [46] suggested random-
probing lidars, which correspond to spatial randomization, to
defend spooﬁng attacks. Additionally, Shin et al. proposed
randomizing lidars’ ping waveform.
4) Improving the Quality of Components: Sensor designers
may choose to improve the performance of certain components
to mitigate attacker signals, though typically this increases
production costs. The details of a speciﬁc component improve-
ment, including the sensor and attack to defend, allows this
class of defense to mitigate a variety of injection and measure-
ment shaping steps. For example, Trippel et al. [59] suggested
using secure ampliﬁers whose dynamic range is large enough
to cope with the exploited saturation. Son et al. [42] proposed
to redesign MEMS gyroscopes to have resonance frequencies
in non-critical frequency bands. Although speciﬁc approaches
were not given, designing acoustic-resonance resilient MEMS
gyroscopes were proposed as a defense by both Son et al. [42]
and Wang et al. [44]. All three cases belong to Component
Modiﬁcation because no additional component is adopted.
5) Sensor Fusion: Defense by sensor fusion enhances re-
siliency against transduction attacks by utilizing output from
multiple sensors. They can be divided further into (1) spatial
fusion which utilizes multiple sensors, sometimes different
types of sensors, (2) spectral fusion that adopts multiple
redundant frequencies/wavelengths for measurement, and (3)
temporal fusion which utilizes the history of measurement.
Spatial fusion corresponds to Component Fusion as combines
