**Current behavior**
`` and `` tags are stripped from templates, but they are listed
in the DOM element registry as supported, complete with DOM properties, etc.:
https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/modules/%40angular/compiler/src/schema/dom_element_schema_registry.ts
**Expected/desired behavior**
They should be at least removed from the registry. Even better, they could be
marked as forbidden in the registry so that it's clear that they don't fall in
the 'unknown' tag category.
**Angular version:** GitHub repo, master branch
@mprobst advised me to CC @tbosch and @mhevery for this issue, thanks for
taking a look at it!
