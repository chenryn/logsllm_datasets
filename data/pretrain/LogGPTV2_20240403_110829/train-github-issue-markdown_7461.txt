On one of the pages that I'm parsing I got:
File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/requests/models.py", line 777, in
text  
content = str(self.content, encoding, errors='replace')  
LookupError: unknown encoding: ISO-LATIN-1
I think it would be more sensible to try a default encoding (utf-8 and
windows-1252 as a fallback) when Python doesn't support the encoding defined
in the page.
Also, using encoding.lower().replace('-latin-', '-8859-') will go a long way
fixing the common case of pages using iso-latin-N instead of iso-8859-N.
