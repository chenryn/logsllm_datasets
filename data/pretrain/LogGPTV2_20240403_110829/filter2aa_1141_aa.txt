Home Insecurity: No Alarms, False Alarms, and SIGINT

PI:EMAIL
ABSTRACT
The market share of home security systems has substan-
tially increased as vendors incorporate more desirable fea-
tures: intrusion detection, automation, wireless, and LCD
touch panel controls. Wireless connectivity allows vendors
to manufacture cheaper, more featureful products that re-
quire little to no home modiﬁcation to install. Consumer
win, since adding devices is easier. The result: an osten-
sibly more secure, convenient, and connected home for a
larger number of citizens. Sadly, this hypothesis is ﬂawed;
the idea of covering a home with more security sensors does
not translate into a more secure home.
Additionally, the
number of homes using these vulnerable systems is large,
and the growth rate is increasing producing a even larger
problem. In this paper, we will demonstrate a generalized
approach for compromising three systems: ADT, the largest
home security dealer in North America; Honeywell, one of
the largest manufacturers of security devices; and Vivint,
a top 5 security dealer.
We will suppress alarms, create
false alarms, and collect artifacts that facilitate tracking the
movements of individuals in their homes.

INTRODUCTION
Home security systems have advanced tremendously in the
past 25 years. They have evolved from simple systems com-
posed of wired sensors, keypads, and control panels to a
central hub for all home security and automation needs.
Newer home security systems have incorporated most every
advancement in consumer electronics to make more feature-
ful systems including touchscreens, two-way communication,
wireless sensors, and wireless home automation. Some can
even be controlled from a smartphone.. This rapid incorpo-
ration of new technology to create innovative features not
only increases the attack surface of the system, but also
reduces the resources expended on the upkeep of legacy fea-
tures. Because of this trade-o↵, allocating more resources
for expansion of features instead of maintenance, we arrive
at the current situation where cutting edge security systems
are still using wireless protocols created 20 years ago. In
this paper, we will demonstrate how this is a major security
risk that has no clear remediation path.
We will explore
the motivations of the adversary. We will develop a model
for the adversary and the home security systems.
Using
the developed models, a methodology will be developed for
evaluating the eﬃcacy of the adversary’s attacks. Then, we
will cover the attack primitives that are available to the ad-
versary and their use cases. We will then move on to the
application of the attack primitives: we will suppress alarms,
create false alarms, and collect artifacts that facilitate track-
ing the movements of individuals in their homes. We then
apply these attack primitives to three di↵erent security sys-
tems. We conclude our analysis by observing and explaining
the eﬃcacy of these attack primitives.

MOTIVATION
Consumers purchase home security systems to be safe in
their residences. These systems ostensibly protect both the
valuables of the occupants and the occupants themselves.
Adversaries have repeatedly demonstrated the ease of cut-
ting the phone lines which alert the monitoring companies.
This is a well known attack, demonstrated in approximately
25% of invasions [Chianis 2014].
Because of this and the
ease of installation, many consumers are advised to pur-
chase wireless security systems. It has been demonstrated
the cellular link back to the monitoring company can be
compromised [Porter and Smith 2013], and that some wire-
less home automation systems can be compromised as well
[Fouladi and Ghanoun 2013]. Subverting magnetic and PIR
sensors so they never communicate an alarm has also been
demonstrated [Porter and Smith 2013].
All of these attacks attempt to accomplish similar goals. As
the adversary, we would like to subvert these systems so that
they provide a false sense of security, and ideally become a
liability to the occupants.
To completely subvert the se-
curity systems, the adversary needs the ability to covertly
inﬁltrate and exﬁltrate the premises. To make the systems a
liability, the adversary wants to monitor the behavior of the
occupants and use the system to induce behavior in both
the occupants and monitoring companies.
Our adversary
also wants a cheap, easy, and generalizable attack. The ad-
versary believes he can accomplish these goals by attacking
the intra-home wireless communications.

MODELS
3.1
Adversary Model
Intra-home wireless communications for home security sys-
tems have been in use for over 20 years. The adversary ex-
pects these communications to be vulnerable and fairly easy
to compromise across multiple manufacturers. In addition,
technology is trending towards wireless communications, so
the adversary expects the attacks to be high yield. Given
the attacks are a success, the attacks should be easy to com-
modify since software deﬁned radios are becoming cheaper
and more ubiquitous. Now that the adversary has decided
on a wireless approach, what is required to accomplish the
goals?
The adversary requires three attack primitives. The ﬁrst is
jamming of transmissions, which will suppress alarms and
allow covert inﬁltration and exﬁltration. The second is SIG-
INT, which will be used to intercept transmissions and mon-
itor occupants. The third is replay, which will trigger false
alarms and be used to induce behavior.
The adversary will have some stringent constraints placed on
him in hopes of providing the cheapest, easiest, and most
generalizable solution.
The ﬁrst constrains knowledge ac-
quisition techniques. There will be no dumping of ROMs or
ﬁrmware, there will only be black-box testing. The second
constrains possible attacks. There will be no fuzz testing or
crafting of malicious transmissions. The adversary will be
restricted to the three available attack primitives.
3.2
Security System Model
We model intra-home security system communication as a
directed graph with two edge labels (communication types)
and four vertex labels (device types). The two communica-
tion types are:
1. vulnerable
2. secure
The 4 device types are:
1. sensors (e.g. door sensor, glass break, motion detector)
2. alerting devices (e.g.
keypad for occupants, control
panel for monitoring companies)
3. bridges
4. other
Sensors are devices that trigger an event when some cri-
teria is met. They generally support one-way communica-
tion and simply broadcast their event using their supported
communication type. Some more advanced sensors contain
some state, and will broadcast a periodic heartbeat and alert
when their battery is low. Alerting devices report the system
state, the aggregate of all events received by the device, to
an authority, i.e., the occupants of the protected area or the
monitoring company. The third device type, bridge, is any
device that simply passes transmissions along. Bridges act
to extend range and translate transmissions from one com-
munication type to another. Our fourth device type, other,
is to cover all other devices that do not ﬁt the other types.
Given the adversary model, we treat wired communication
and non-legacy wireless communication as secure.
We model home security systems as directed graphs (di-
graphs) since the transmissions from sensors happen regard-
less of whether or not the alarm devices are in an armed
or disarmed state. Also, alarm devices generally only sig-
nal an event if they are armed and receive a transmission
from one of the sensors. So, communications are modeled
as originating at the sources (sensors) ﬂowing through the
graph (through bridges and alarm devices) to sinks (alarm
devices).
As can be seen in Figure 1, the digraph for the exemplar
Honeywell system is composed of 5 sensors (blue nodes),
2 alarm devices (red nodes), 5 vulnerable communications
channels (solid edges) and 2 secure communication channels
(dashed edges). The black box encompassing the blue and
red nodes signiﬁes the barrier of the protected area. So, all
communications occur within the protected area except for
the single communication channel connected to the moni-
toring company (cowboy badge).
Since all events pass through the keypad, the center red
node, all the adversary needs to do is compromise the sen-
sor communication channels and the keypad will never re-
ceive any events to alert the occupants or the monitoring
company.

Methodology
Given our objectives, system model, and primitives, the fol-
lowing is our general approach to analyzing new security
systems:
1. Identify all devices and their supported communication
types.
2. Generate a directed graph from sources (sensors) to
sinks (alerting devices).
3. If any wireless communication channels exist, attempt
our SIGINT primitive.
4. If a path exists from a source to a sink that involves a
vulnerable communication channel, attempt jamming
and replay primitives.
5. Evaluate the attained level of control and situational
awareness of the system.
Before applying our methodology to two additional systems,
we will show implementations of the three attack primitives
when applied to the Honeywell system.

ATTACK PRIMITIVE IMPLEMENTATION
In this section we will detail the hardware and software
required for implementation, the implementation of these
primitives, and some of the capabilities that they provide.
The implementations will be targeting a Honeywell system.
The Honeywell system is comprised of two 5815MN door
sensors, 3 5800 PIR-RES motion detectors, a 6160RF key-
pad, and a Vista 20P control panel. This system was pur-
chased approximately two years ago.
4.1
Required Hardware and Software
There are four prerequisites:
1. A software deﬁned radio that is capable of transmitting
and receiving on the frequencies used by the home security
devices. We use a USRP N210 software deﬁned radio with
a WBX daughterboard.
2. A tuned antenna. We use several cut-to-length wire an-
tennas.
3. Software to program the software deﬁned radio. We use
GNU Radio. GNU Radio is open-source, free, and supports
the vast majority of SDRs on the market. It comes with
a graphical tool, GNU Radio Companion (GRC), which is
invaluable for general use and rapid prototyping. GRC is
similar to Simulink and LabView with its ﬂow-based pro-
gramming. The output of GRC is a Python program. So, it
is standard workﬂow to prototype in GRC and let it create
the Python boilerplate.
4. A test system. We use the previously mentioned Honey-
well system.
4.2
Tuning In
The ﬁrst step is to ﬁgure out where in the frequency spec-
trum communications are taking place. This can be done
using a dedicated spectrum analyzer, an SDR as a spectrum
analyzer, or by simply consulting the FCC [FCC 2014]. We
searched the FCCID of the 5815MN door sensor (FCCID:
CFS8DL5815) and found the information in Figure 2.
We will be referencing ﬁgure 2 throughout the paper. For
tuning in, the Functional Description provides us with the
needed center frequency: 345MHz.

Jamming
4.3.1
Spot Jamming Implementation with GRC
This ﬂow chart is simple. Our source is a random number
generator with an output type of integer. Our sink is the
USRP N210 with center frequency set to 345MHz and gain
set arbitrarily high. We cannot wire these two blocks to-
gether because they are of di↵erent types. So we add our
Functional Description
The 5815MN is a battery powered, portable
transmitter that is part of a wireless
alarm system.
It is used in conjunction
with a receiver (5881) to indicate an
alarm when activated.
RF transmissions
are initiated by a change in state of the
loop and/or tamper inputs.
In addition,
the 5815MN sends a regular supervision
or check-in RF message, no more often
