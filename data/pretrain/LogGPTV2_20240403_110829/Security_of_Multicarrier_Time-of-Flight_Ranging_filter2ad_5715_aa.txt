ABSTRACT
OFDM is a widely used modulation scheme. It transmits data over
multiple subcarriers in parallel, which provides high resilience
against frequency-dependent channel drops (fading) and achieves
high throughput. Due to the proliferation of OFDM-enabled de-
vices and the increasing need for location information, the research
community has suggested using OFDM symbols for secure (time-of-
flight) distance measurements. However, a consequence of relying
on multiple subcarriers is long symbols (time-wise). This makes
OFDM systems not a natural fit for secure ranging, as long symbols
allow an attacker longer observation and reaction times to mount
a so-called early-detect/late-commit attack. Despite these concerns,
a recent standardization effort (IEEE 802.11az [5]) envisions the
use of OFDM-based signals for secure ranging. This paper lays the
groundwork for analyzing OFDM time-of-flight measurements and
studies the security guarantees of OFDM-based ranging against a
physical-layer attacker. We use BPSK and 4-QAM, the most robust
configurations, as examples to present a strategy that increases the
chances for early-detecting the transmitted symbols. Our theoret-
ical analysis and simulations show that such OFDM systems are
vulnerable to early-detection/late-commit attacks, irrespective of
frame length and number of subcarriers. We identify the underly-
ing causes and explore a possible countermeasure, consisting of
orthogonal noise and randomized phase.

1 INTRODUCTION
Secure ranging is important for applications that rely on proximity
(car lock) or positioning (navigation, autonomous driving). Recent
proposals for secure distance measurements rely on ultra-wideband
wireless communications (UWB) [3]. Even though transmitting on

a wide frequency range can provide sub-10cm ranging precision
and high security-guarantees, this technology is not yet widely
deployed. Due to its use of wide segments of licensed spectrum,
it is subject to stringent constraints on transmit power. Moreover,
the fact that the signal power is compressed in short pulses makes
amplification difficult and limits the distance for practical operation.
Compared to UWB, orthogonal frequency division multiplex-
ing (OFDM) is a modulation technique that is widely used today,
especially in wireless systems that offer high throughput, such as
in WiFi or cellular (i.e., 4G, 5G). A lot of infrastructure supporting
these communication standards has been deployed with an ongoing
trend towards high-bandwidth OFDM signals (5G). With OFDM,
data is transmitted over many subcarriers in parallel. This provides
robustness against frequency-selective channel drops (fading) [19].
However, because the subcarriers are closely spaced in frequency
in most OFDM-based systems, an OFDM receiver requires multiple
time samples for correct decoding. The transmitted symbols are sig-
nificantly longer than for most singlecarrier systems, which is not
ideal for (secure) ranging. Over the last decade, there was a lot of
research dedicated to overcoming this challenge and re-purposing
OFDM signals in WiFi for time-of-flight (ToF)-based ranging and
positioning [12, 15, 28], achieving ranging precision on the order
of meters or less.
Such performance numbers are sufficient for many applications,
and OFDM signals are a viable candidate for ranging. However,
in the context of distance bounding and ranging, the security of
OFDM systems is unclear to date, unlike ultra-wideband (UWB)
based systems that are thought to be secure against a powerful,
Dolev-Yao-like attacker with idealized reaction times [24]. Given
the vast proliferation of OFDM systems today and in the foreseeable
future (5G), it is therefore of great importance to also assess the
security of OFDM-based ranging implementations. This concern
has been identified by the ongoing IEEE 802.11az standardization ef-
fort for next-generation positioning based on WiFi signals. Current
proposals for secure ranging that have been made by the respective
Task Group [5] include different OFDM modulations where ran-
dom symbol sequences are transmitted to acquire the time-of-flight
(ToF).
At the time of writing this paper (June 2021), the Task Group
has not yet decided on the final technique that would provide the
most resilience against a distance-reducing attacker. The fact that
discussions have been ongoing for more than four years [6] clearly
indicates the challenging nature of OFDM-based ranging. Undoubt-
edly, one needs to fully understand the security implications of a
ranging scheme before its design is “baked” into billions of hard-
ware chips supporting the upcoming IEEE 802.11az standard.
In light of this development, we aim to identify the pitfalls of
OFDM-based ranging and assess whether multicarrier time-of-flight
ranging can be secure. We choose a theoretical angle to approach
the question and assume an idealized adversary with no hardware

constraints. Therefore, our results serve as a guideline for real-world
systems that might relax the adversarial model by constraining
reaction time, sensitivity, and computational power of a potential
attacker. In addition to the theoretical insights, we make our own
proposal for secure multicarrier ranging that is based on orthogonal
noise and can be used in conjunction with other approaches..
In order to increase positioning accuracy, some OFDM-based
ranging systems exploit signal phase and directionality alongside
time-of-flight information. Since these features do not contribute
to the system’s overall security—phase information can easily be
subverted, see, e.g., [22]—, the focus of this work will only be on
the security guarantees provided by time-of-flight measurements.
In particular, we make the following contributions:
• We provide mathematical proof that robust OFDM constel-
lations, namely BPSK and 4-QAM, are vulnerable to early-
detection. An attacker can identify (almost) any symbol with
access to only a quarter (plus one) of the time-domain sam-
ples for BPSK and half (plus one) of the time-domain samples
for 4-QAM.
• For the highly performant BPSK, we constructively prove
the existence of valid late-commit attack sequences for all
non-pulsed symbols. Those factors jointly lead to a deter-
ministically achievable, significant distance reduction.
• We identify a possible countermeasure that involves a con-
tinuous extension of the constellation grid.
The paper is organized as follows. The following Section 2 intro-
duces secure ranging and summarizes the main results. Section 3
introduces the vulnerabilities of highly robust OFDM configura-
tions. In Section 4, we address a potential countermeasure. We
discuss our findings in a broader sense in Section 5 and provide
related work in Section 6 before concluding in Section 7.
2 BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF
RESULTS
Over the last two decades, OFDM and its variants have become the
predominant modulation techniques for high-throughput wireless
communication, both in the WiFi and cellular domains (4G, 5G). In
the cellular domain, we see a trend towards high signal bandwidths
(100MHz and more), which furthers the adoption of OFDM modula-
tion and increases the utility of those signals for ranging based on
time-of-flight measurement. The security of such systems against
physical-layer attackers depends on certain time-domain properties
of the modulation. However, due to the information being encoded
in the frequency domain, the resulting physical-security properties
against a distance-modifying attacker do not follow trivially and
have, to the best of our knowledge, not been studied so far.
2.1 OFDM
Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing encodes message bits
in frequency domain and transforms them into time-domain by an
inverse Fourier transform, i.e.,
c = F −1 {C} ,

different numbers of subcarriers (N ). The frequency spec-
trum shows how the subcarriers share the channel band-
width. The transmitter modulates message bits on individ-
ual subcarriers and applies an Inverse Fourier Transform to
arrive at the time samples (on the right).

The values of C are determined by the symbol bit-sequence b and
the constellation mapping MAP (·), e.g., BPSK, QPSK, 16-QAM, etc.
This results in the transmitted signal
c = OFDM (b) = F −1 {MAP (b)} ,
which is sent over the wireless channel. The receiver then retrieves
the information bits after performing an FFT on the incoming signal,
b′ = OFDM−1 (c) = DEMAP (F {c}) ,
where the demapping operation is a hypothesis test based on the
constellation set. As information bits are transmitted on orthog-
onal subcarriers (illustrated in Fig. 1), OFDM provides resilience
to frequency-selective fading. The dips in the channel transfer
function caused by fading remain constrained to a subset of the
subcarriers. The receiver can maintain the orthogonality under a
channel by adding a cyclic prefix (CP), which means to prepend the
last few samples of the symbol at the beginning, thus circularizing
the symbol. This allows simple equalization on a per-subcarrier
level, as orthogonalization ensures an independent impact of the
channel on each subcarrier.
To enable reliable communication, an OFDM transceiver has to
perform additional tasks, namely synchronization, frequency and
sampling offset correction, channel estimation and equalization.
Introducing a cyclic prefix can help with those tasks. However, use
of a cyclic prefix has a detrimental effect on ranging security. The
cyclic prefix adds redundancy such that an attacker can predict
the last part of the symbol with absolute certainty, even after only
listening to the first part of the symbol (i.e., the cyclic prefix). For
the remainder of this paper, we are therefore only concerned with
“plain” OFDM symbols that neither contain a cyclic prefix, nor any
guard symbols or bands. This is a realistic assumption, which has

external attacker (a separate entity) attempts to modify the ToF
measurement such that the prover appears to be closer to the ver-
ifier. Figure 3 visualizes the Mafia Fraud attack. This is also the
attack scenario the IEEE 802.11az task group is mainly concerned
with.
In order to achieve distance reduction, the attacker has to make
sure the challenge message is registered at the prover at an earlier
time than the legitimate challenge, and/or, advance both distance
commitment and response message in a way that they arrive at the
verifier at an earlier time. The attacker can operate either on the
protocol/data-layer or on the symbol level to inject and advance the
messages. If the adversary cannot predict the content of the mes-
sages, it is forced to resort to the symbol level and has to mount a
so-called early-detection/late-commit (ED/LC) attack. We explain the
ED/LC attack assuming the attacker attempts to advance the chal-
lenge message. The same technique can be applied to the response
message.
For every symbol the verifier transmits, the attacker also emits
a symbol, such that it arrives at the prover with a certain time
advantage. Because the attacker does not know the exact symbol
apriori, the first part of the adversarial symbol can be random noise,
tricking the prover into believing that the wireless channel has
distorted the start of the symbol. Figure 4 shows an abstract example
of an ED/LC attack performed against a singlecarrier symbol. The
adversary starts transmitting early even though the exact symbol
is not known yet.
Since wireless transmission is not instant and the symbols have
a certain duration, the attacker listens to the verifier’s transmission
(while interfering with the prover) and tries to detect the verifier’s
actual symbol based on the fraction of the signal received so far. This
process is called early-detection (shown as ED in Fig. 4). Assuming
the attacker succeeds and early-detects the verifier’s symbol with
high probability, it changes its own transmission from noise to a
valid symbol—or a signal that is interpreted by the prover as the
intended symbol1. This step of the attack is called late-commit
(shown as LC in Fig. 4) and, if successful, makes the second part
of the adversarial symbol appear as a valid symbol to the prover
which blames the noise in the first part of the symbol on the channel
and continues with the protocol. Finally, the attacker succeeds in
reducing the time-of-flight measurement and in accomplishing the
Mafia Fraud.
2.3 IEEE 802.11az
Within the IEEE 802.11az task group, there is an ongoing standard-
ization effort towards secure OFDM-based ranging [5]. Publicly
available, preliminary documents indicate that a physical-layer
attacker is indeed considered a threat and part of the ongoing dis-
cussion. These documents discuss an attacker with limited reaction
times and countermeasures evolving around coarser measures, such
as avoiding cyclic prefixes and highly redundant encoding. Some of
the documents treat a similar attacker as introduced in this work,
operating on the sub-symbol level, however, without a rigorous
study underpinning the presented measures. Our work aims to help
1The adversary superimposes its signal onto the legitimate signal. The adversarial
signal has to take such effects into account and has to be transmitted at higher power
for it to be decoded correctly at the receiver.

also been made by the IEEE 802.11az standardization effort. When
in ranging mode, OFDM symbols must not feature (additional)
redundancy, such as a cyclic prefix.
2.2 Distance bounding and secure ranging
Typically, a distance-bounding or secure ranging protocol allows a
prover to convince a verifier to be within a certain distance. Among
the different techniques to measure physical distance based on a
radio signal, time-of-flight measurement is the only one with the
potential of being secure against a physical-layer attacker. This is
based on the observation that an unknown signal’s arrival time
cannot be meaningfully modified (i.e., reduced) by an attacker, as
opposed to the signal’s absolute strength or phase. We focus on a
scenario where two entities, a verifier and a prover, determine their
distance by measuring the time-of-flight (ToF) of a signal exchange,
as illustrated in Figure 2. We assume the prover to be trusted and,
in particular, entrusted with maintaining a time schedule that feeds
into ToF estimation. We will henceforth assume the use of a distance
commitment, as presented in [26]. This allows us to separate the fast
reply from the data-bearing part in a challenge-response protocol
for secure ranging, removing the need for fast processing of the
challenge, i.e., to decouple the time-critical part of the protocol,
unlike rapid bit exchange in Brands and Chaum [8]. Alternatively,
the reply time could even be communicated by the prover after the
ranging exchange. Irrespective of this protocol design choice, the
crucial requirement on the data-bearing part is that an attacker
cannot advance the response in time through reactive interference.

community has coined four attack scenarios in the context of
distance-bounding protocols: Distance Fraud, Mafia Fraud, Ter-
rorist Fraud, and Distance Hijacking [4]. In this work, we focus
