### Heterogeneity of Organizations and ASes

Figure 6 illustrates the heterogeneity of organizations and ASes (Autonomous Systems) in today's Internet. The scatter plot in Figure 6(c) shows the number of organizations (y-axis) versus the number of server IPs (x-axis) for each AS, both on a logarithmic scale. This visualization highlights that operating a diverse infrastructure is common, not limited to the largest players.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Diverse Infrastructure**: Many organizations operate their server infrastructure across multiple ASes, often involving third-party networks.
2. **Third-Party Networks**: Hand-checking 143 organizations with more than 1,000 servers confirmed that these ASes are typically genuine third-party networks, independently operated from the organization whose servers they host.
3. **AS Diversity**: Many ASes host a significant number of server IPs belonging to multiple organizations. For example, over 500 ASes host servers from more than five organizations, and more than 200 ASes support more than ten organizations.

#### Implications:
- **Heterogeneous ISP Networks**: The trend towards more heterogeneous ISP networks is evident, with ASes hosting more servers from an increasing number of third-party networks. This is consistent with public announcements and efforts by content providers like Google, Amazon, and Facebook to install their own CDNs inside various ISPs.
- **Challenges in Network Management**: The increasing intertwining of networks and traffic poses significant challenges in studying and controlling such complex systems. For instance, a large web hosting company (AS36351) has over 40,000 server IPs belonging to more than 350 different organizations, as highlighted in Figure 6(c).

### New Reality: Heterogeneous Links

In Section 5.2, we discussed how organizations leverage network diversity by spreading their infrastructure across multiple networks. This creates fluid and often transparent network boundaries, complicating the attribution of traffic to the correct network.

#### Example: Akamai at an IXP
- **Traditional AS-Level View**: In the traditional AS-level perspective, Akamai (AS1) peers with AS3 at an IXP, which in turn peers with another non-Akamai AS2. The traffic on the peering link between AS3 and Akamai AS can be measured to determine Akamai's traffic.
- **Enhanced View with Member-Specific Details**: When considering that there is an Akamai server behind/inside non-Akamai AS2, the measurement becomes more complex. It requires measuring traffic on both the peering link between AS3 and Akamai AS and the peering link between AS3 and non-Akamai AS2.

#### Impact on Traffic Attribution
- **Problems with Traditional AS-Level View**: The trend towards network heterogenization creates problems for the traditional AS-level view of the Internet. Accurately attributing traffic to the responsible parties becomes more challenging.
- **Observations at the IXP**: Figure 7(b) shows the observed traffic at the IXP for Akamai, illustrating the complexity introduced by the presence of Akamai servers in non-Akamai ASes.

### Conclusion
The increasing heterogeneity of organizations and ASes, along with the spread of infrastructure across multiple networks, presents significant challenges for the traditional AS-level view of the Internet. Accurate traffic attribution and management require a more nuanced and detailed approach to account for the complexities introduced by this diversity.
