  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
  * Once a `Collapse` has finished animating in and has the `entered` className, `overflow` should be set to `visible` so borders, box-shadows, `Checkbox` ripples, contents positioned outside etc are visible.
## Current Behavior
Currently the implementation only sets the `height` to `auto`, and the
contents of a component which uses `Collapse` (like `StepContent`) can be
clipped e.g. shadows around `Paper`s, `Card`s etc
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
https://codesandbox.io/s/koo6069llv
## Context
The most common case where this will pop up is when using a form in a
`Stepper` with `orientation` set to `vertical`. The ripple from a `Checkbox`
will clip at the edge of the `Collapse` used in `StepContent`.
## Your Environment
See codesandbox link above.
## Workaround
I was able to use theme overrides to work around this for now:
    createMuiTheme({
      overrides: {
        MuiCollapse: {
          entered: {
            height: "auto",
            overflow: "visible"
          }
        }
      }
    });
