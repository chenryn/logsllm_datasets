**Migrated Issue, Originally Created by Anonymous**

I am encountering an issue with the current SQLAlchemy trunk (revision 1344) on my system. The following exception is raised:

```
[15:27:20,845] (2006-04-27) [engine]: DELETE FROM managers WHERE managers.person_id = %(person_id)s
[15:27:20,845] (2006-04-27) [engine]: [{'person_id': 2}]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "polymorph2.py", line 130, in <module>

    operation.execute()
  File "/path/to/egg/sqlalchemy/mapping/unitofwork.py", line 540, in execute
    result = self.mapper.delete_obj(self.session, self.object)
  File "/path/to/egg/sqlalchemy/mapping/mapper.py", line 661, in delete_obj
    raise CommitError("ConcurrencyError - updated rowcount %d does not match number of objects updated %d" % (result.rowcount, len(objects)))
sqlalchemy.exceptions.CommitError: ConcurrencyError - updated rowcount 1 does not match number of objects updated 2
```

The error message indicates a `CommitError` due to a mismatch between the expected and actual number of rows updated during a delete operation. Specifically, the operation expected to update 2 rows but only 1 row was affected.

Could you please provide guidance on how to resolve this issue or any additional information that might be helpful for debugging?
