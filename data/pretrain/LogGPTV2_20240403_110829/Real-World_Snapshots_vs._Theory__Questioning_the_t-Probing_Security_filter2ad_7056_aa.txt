Abstract—Due to its sound theoretical basis and practical efﬁ-
ciency, masking has become the most prominent countermeasure
to protect cryptographic implementations against physical side-
channel attacks (SCAs). The core idea of masking is to randomly
split every sensitive intermediate variable during computation
into at least t+1 shares, where t denotes the maximum number
of shares that are allowed to be observed by an adversary without
learning any sensitive information. In other words, it is assumed
that the adversary is bounded either by the possessed number
of probes (e.g., microprobe needles) or by the order of statistical
analyses while conducting higher-order SCA attacks (e.g., differ-
ential power analysis). Such bounded models are employed to
prove the SCA security of the corresponding implementations.
Consequently, it is believed that given a sufﬁciently large number
of shares, the vast majority of known SCA attacks are mitigated.
In this work, we present a novel laser-assisted SCA technique,
called Laser Logic State Imaging (LLSI), which offers an
unlimited number of contactless probes, and therefore, violates
the probing security model assumption. This technique enables
us to take snapshots of hardware implementations, i.e., extract
the logical state of all registers at any arbitrary clock cycle
with a single measurement. To validate this, we mount our
attack on masked AES hardware implementations and practically
demonstrate the extraction of the full-length key in two different
scenarios. First, we assume that the location of the registers (key
and/or state) is known, and hence, their content can be directly
read by a single snapshot. Second, we consider an implementation
with unknown register locations, where we make use of multiple
snapshots and a SAT solver to reveal the secrets.

I. INTRODUCTION
Electronic embedded devices are an indispensable part of
our today’s connected systems. To ensure the conﬁdential-
ity and integrity of processed data in these systems, strong
cryptography is needed. But even in the presence of such
cryptographic primitives, the security of deployed devices still
can be compromised by attackers, who can gain access to
these devices and thus launch physical attacks. Side-Channel
Analysis (SCA) attacks are examples of such physical threats,
which are hard to detect and mitigate due to their most often
passive nature. SCA attacks exploit the inevitable inﬂuence of
computation and storage on different measurable quantities on
a device, such as timing [1], power consumption [2], Electro-
Magnetic (EM) emanation [3], and photon emission [4].

Universit¨at Berlin.
Several countermeasures have been proposed to defeat SCA
attacks. Among them, masking has been shown to be the
most effective one that can be applied to most cryptographic
schemes. Masking schemes are based on the principle of split-
ting the computation over several randomized and independent
shares. To prove the security of the masked implementations,
the t-probing model was ﬁrst introduced in the seminal work
of Ishai et al. [5]. In this model, the adversary is assumed to
be limited by the number of t probes available for observing
the computation on wires. In such a scenario, we require
to employ at least t + 1 shares to assure that the adversary
cannot learn any sensitive information from t observations. In
practice, assuming such a limit is quite plausible.
For instance, due to the lack of spatial distance in case of
invasive micro/nano-probing attacks or EM analysis, we expect
the number of possible probes to be very limited. Moreover,
the higher number of probes leads to a more expensive probe
station, and hence, the cost of multi-probe stations is another
limiting factor for the adversary. Currently, the most advanced
commercially-available nano-probe station consists of at most
eight needles [6]. Similarly for EM stations, the largest setup,
which has been reported so far only in [7], makes use of three
simultaneous probes. In the case of classical power analysis,
typically only one physical probe is available. However, it
captures the entire circuit’s power consumption, including that
of all shares of all sensitive variables at once (univariate) or at
multiple time instances (multivariate). Therefore, higher-order
statistical analyses dealing with such power measurements to
some extent reﬂect the number of probes, for example, see [8].
Such higher-order analyses are, however, strongly affected by
the noise level [9]. Consequently, it is believed that employing
a sufﬁciently large number of shares can – in the presence of
noise – avert classical SCA attacks.
On the other hand, more advanced photonic SCA attacks
from the chip backside [10] enable the adversary to capture
side-channel information of several transistors simultaneously,
and hence, can provide a large number of probes. However,
these attacks can only extract data during transitions. More-
over, due to the typically low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR),
the integration of leakages associated to many executions of
the cryptographic algorithm with attacker-controlled inputs is
necessary. Yet, the existing randomization in masking schemes
makes measurement repetition and integration over the same
data infeasible. While randomization has been mainly consid-

ered as a countermeasure against power/EM SCA attacks in
the literature, optical attacks become ineffective as well due
to their need for integration.
In response, an intriguing research direction dealing with
single-trace SCA attacks has been formed, which mainly target
the implementation of public-key algorithms requiring a large
number of clock cycles [11]–[13]. Besides, there have been ef-
forts to mount SCA with a minimum possible number of traces
by proﬁling the target in advance, also known as template
attacks [7], [14]. Unfortunately, these techniques are relevant
only for speciﬁc cryptographic schemes and cannot be applied
in general to all masked implementations. Furthermore, the
proﬁling phase, in the case of template attacks, might be
infeasible in real-world scenarios, where only one sample is
available. Besides, it should be noted that proﬁling still does
not guarantee the success of the SCA attack by a single-trace
measurement and cannot easily scale with an increase in the
number of shares. Driven by the limitations mentioned above,
the following question arises: Does a practical single-trace
SCA technique exist that offers an unlimited number of probes
while not being limited to speciﬁc cryptographic algorithms?
Our Contributions. In this work, we indeed positively answer
the above question. We present a novel laser-assisted SCA
attack from the chip backside using a known Failure Analy-
sis (FA) technique, called Laser Logic State Imaging (LLSI)1.
By modulating the voltage supplying the transistors on the
chip, the corresponding light reﬂection (originating from a
laser scanning irradiation on these transistors) also becomes
modulated. The resulting modulation is highly data dependent
because only transistors in the on-state affect the reﬂection
of the laser. We demonstrate how an adversary can deploy
LLSI in a particular clock cycle to take a snapshot from the
entire circuit and recover the state of all transistors, which
form the gates and registers. Hence, it enables the adversary to
have an unlimited number of contactless probes during a time
period, which invalidates the central underlying assumption of
the probing security model for masking schemes. Moreover,
in contrast
to other optical attacks or conventional SCA
techniques, LLSI does not require any repeated measurements
with the same data. Therefore, the existing randomness in
masking schemes does not have any protective effect.
To validate our claims, we consider two attack scenarios.
First, we assume that the location of the registers is known
to the adversary; hence their content can be directly read
out using a single snapshot. If this includes key and/or state
registers of the underlying cipher, extracting the secret key is
straightforward. In this case, the effort for the attacker grows
linearly with the number of shares. Second, we demonstrate
that even without knowing the location of the registers, the
attacker can still recover the secret key by capturing a couple
of snapshots at consecutive clock cycles, and making use of

previously reported in the failure analysis community. We claim neither this
technique nor our experimental setup as the contribution of this work. Our
primary intention is to draw attention to the potential threat of this known but

a SAT solver. Apart from several simulation-based investiga-
tions, to practically show the effectiveness of LLSI we mount
snapshot attacks on masked AES designs implemented on a
Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) manufactured with
a 60 nm technology. As a result, we successfully break the
security of the targeted masked implementations by extracting
their full-length keys.
II. BACKGROUND
A. Masking Countermeasures and t-Probing Model
While several customized countermeasures (e.g., shielded
hardware, current ﬁltering, and dual-rail
logic) have been
designed to protect speciﬁc cryptographic implementations
against SCA attacks, masking is known as the most widely
studied one with sound theoretical and mathematical founda-
tions. The main idea behind masking schemes is to make use
of a couple of parties (order of the masking), and split the
intermediate computations dealing with the secrets, i.e., multi-
party computation and secret sharing. The input of the circuit
(key and plaintext) should be represented in a shared form, and
the ﬁnal result (ciphertext) should be obtained by recombining
the output shares while the entire computations are performed
only on shares. The primary advantage of masking is that it can
be assessed in formal security models. In Boolean masking, as
the most common scheme, every random bit x is represented
by (x0, . . . , xd) in such a way that x = x0 ⊕ . . . ⊕ xd.
Based on formal analyses given in [15], a secret sharing with
d + 1 shares can at most defeat an adversary who is limited
to the dth order SCA. Further, it has been demonstrated that
measurements of each share xi are affected by Gaussian noise,
and hence, the number of noisy traces required to recover x
grows exponentially with the number of shares [9]. Therefore,
as a general knowledge, a higher number of shares would
potentially diminish the feasibility of attacks.
On the other hand,
the security of masking has been
analyzed by the t-probing model, which was ﬁrst introduced
in [5]. In this model, it is assumed that the adversary has
access to at most t physical probes to observe the compu-
tation on wires of the circuit at each time period (e.g., one
clock cycle). In such a scenario, at least t + 1 shares are
required to ensure that the adversary cannot learn any sensitive
information from t observations. Although we would like to
consider an adversary with an unlimited number of probes,
this task is generally impractical according to the impossibility
of obfuscation [5], [16]. To unify the leakage models, and
therefore, simplify the analysis of SCA countermeasures, it has
been shown that the two aforementioned leakage models are
related by reducing the security in one model to the security of
the other one [8], [17]. In other words, a dth-order noisy SCA is
equivalent to placing t = d physical probes on the wires of the
target circuit. Based on such models and assumptions, several
constructions have been introduced [18]–[23], and a couple
of security proofs have been given [24]–[27]. Moroever, some
(security) veriﬁcation tools have been developed [28]–[32],
and multiple implementations have been reported [33]–[39].

(here: 1 MHz), however, transistors carrying a static signal do not appear in the image. In contrast, for LLSI, the power supply is modulated with a known
frequency (here: 2 MHz), thus transistors in the on-state can be localized.
In order to highlight the deployment of masking schemes in
real-world products, we would like to mention that protection
against side-channel attacks is among the criteria deﬁned by
certiﬁcation bodies in several countries. Masking schemes are
among the countermeasures which have been employed in,
e.g., banking cards since more than a decade ago by smartcard
vendors.
B. Optical Backside Failure Analysis Techniques
Due to the increasing number of metal
layers on the
frontside of integrated circuits (ICs), optical FA techniques
have been developed to access on-chip signals through the
backside [40]. The main techniques are photon emission
analysis, laser stimulation, and optical probing, which take
advantage of the high infrared transmission of silicon for
wavelengths above 1 µm. Although initially developed for FA
purposes, these techniques are nowadays also used in the
security domain [41]. FA labs are equipped with machines
that incorporate all of the previously mentioned techniques in
one device, which is typically a laser scanning microscope
(LSM) equipped with a camera for photon emission analysis,
a detector for measuring the reﬂected laser light, and laser
sources of different wavelengths.2
Due to their high spatial resolution, optical FA techniques
seem to be promising for conducting single-trace measure-
ments. For instance, the analysis of Photon Emission (PE) with
temporal resolution allows to detect the time of switching ac-
tivities of single transistors. Related techniques are Picosecond
Imaging Circuit Analysis (PICA) [42], and the more low-cost
approach of Simple Photonic Emission Analysis (SPEA) [43],
which has been used to attack unprotected implementations of,
e.g., AES [43] and RSA [10]. However, the circuit has to be
repeatedly stimulated for these techniques, since the emission
probability is very low for a single switching event. This
disqualiﬁes time-resolved PE analysis from being a single-
trace technique. Optical techniques that in principle can probe
