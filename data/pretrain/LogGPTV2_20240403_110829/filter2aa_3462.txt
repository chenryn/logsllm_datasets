# How Hackers Won the Zombie Apocalypse

**QuahogCon - Providence, RI - April 23-25, 2010**

**Presenter: Dennis Brown**

## Introduction
- **What is QuahogCon?**
  - A new regional conference in Rhode Island.
  - Focuses on Information Security (Infosec) and Maker Culture.
- **About the Presenter:**
  - **Dennis Brown**: Organizer of QuahogCon.
  - **Affiliations:**
    - DC401 (Rhode Island Defcon Group).
    - Security Researcher at Tenable Network Security.

## Badge Hardware
- **Objective:**
  - Create a hackable badge that remains functional and usable after the conference.
- **Desired Features:**
  - Wireless connectivity.
  - An engaging "game" in the firmware.
  - Open-source development environment.
  - Easy to write custom firmware.
- **Achievements:**
  - Successfully implemented 3 out of the 4 desired features.

## The Badge
- **Base Design:**
  - Based on RedWire LLC's RedBee Econotag.
  - Freescale MC13224v ARM7 Microcontroller.
  - Zigbee communication.
  - 36 GPIO Headers.
  - USB connector for easy flashing.
- **Additions:**
  - 2 AAA batteries.
  - 7 LEDs.
- **Cost:**
  - Approximately $30 per badge.

## End Product
- **Interface Components:**
  - 2 Buttons + Reset.
  - 5 Red LEDs on the left.
  - RGY (Red, Green, Yellow) LEDs on the right.

## Badge Features
- **Coding:**
  - Relatively easy to code for.
- **Custom Firmware:**
  - Kismet client for Zigbee sniffing.
  - Killerbee firmware for Zigbee packet injection.
  - Contiki support for a full system environment.

## Conference Firmware
- **Game Concept:**
  - Aimed to create an interactive game for attendees.
  - Desired features:
    - Ways to affect other attendees.
    - Ways to hack other attendees' badges.
- **Final Game:**
  - Chose a "Zombies vs. Humans" concept.
  - Selected 3 weeks before the conference.
  - Note: More time would have been beneficial.

## Zombies versus Humans!
- **Game Mechanics:**
  - **Humans:**
    - Can kill zombies with multiple attack modes.
    - Have 500 health points.
  - **Zombies:**
    - Can kill humans with charge-up attacks.
    - Have 300 health points.
  - **Clerics (Speakers and Vendors):**
    - Can heal humans and reclaim zombies.
  - **Security "Mussel":**
    - Can attack anyone but is not very powerful to encourage work.

## How It Worked
- **Live Demo:**
  - Attacks dealt 1-5 damage.
  - Dead humans became zombies.
  - Dead zombies became incapacitated but could be revived.
  - Clerics could heal up to 20 health points.

## God Mode
- **Special Feature:**
  - Only 2 badges were flashed with this mode.
  - Designed as a "prize" for attendees.
  - Allowed users to turn badges into any mode except God mode.

## Predictions
- **Expected Hacks:**
  - Cracking the intentionally weak encryption (XOR, no checksum).
  - Packet replay attacks.
  - Hardware hacks.
  - Auto-attacks.
  - Unknown vulnerabilities.

## The Invasion Begins!
- **Badge Distribution:**
  - Distributed at 5 PM on April 23.
  - 65% Human, 30% Zombie.
- **Initial Phase:**
  - Predictable human dominance with low interest.
  - Zombies tried to gain a foothold.
- **Saturday, April 24:**
  - The game dynamics changed significantly.

## Badge Hacks
- **Predicted and Unpredicted Hacks:**
  - **Unsuccessful Attacks:**
    - 555 Timer for automated attacks (stopped by firmware rate limiting).
  - **Moderately Successful Attacks:**
    - Fuzzing (caused badges to "freak out" and caused Denial of Service).
  - **Very Successful Attacks:**
    - Packet Replay (no checksum, successful auto-attack).
    - Cracking Encryption (simple XOR, brute-forcing, and protocol discovery).

## Spoiler Alert!
- **Future Plans:**
  - QuahogCon 2011 Badge: Preliminary design based on Arduino.

## Lessons Learned
- **Denial of Service:**
  - Caused significant game outages.
  - Need to take steps against fuzzing next year.
- **Encryption:**
  - Simple XOR encryption lasted about 18 hours.
- **Hardware Hacks:**
  - No successful hardware hacks affected the game, but people still enjoyed the hardware.

## Conclusion
- **Key Takeaways:**
  - Wireless badges provide maximum fun.
  - Interacting with other attendees' badges is even more enjoyable.
  - High-quality badges can be affordable.
