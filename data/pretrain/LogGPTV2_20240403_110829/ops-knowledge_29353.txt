User: I'm a .NET developer who knows very little about Python, but want to give it a test drive for a small project I'm working on.
What tools and packages should I install on my machine? I'm looking for a common, somewhat comprehensive, development environment.
I'll likely run Ubuntu 9.10, but I'm flexible.  If Windows is a better option, that's fine too.
Edit: To clarify, I'm not looking for the bare minimum to get a Python program to run.  I wouldn't expect a newbie .NET dev to use notepad and a compiler. I'd recommend Visual Studio, NUnit, SQL Server, etc.
Assistant: You don't need much.  Python comes with "Batteries Included."
Visual Studio == IDLE.  You already have it.  If you want more IDE-like environment, install Komodo Edit.
NUnit == unittest.  You already have it in the standard library.
SQL Server == sqlite.  You already have it in the standard library.
Stop wasting time getting everything ready.  It's already there in the basic Python installation.
Get to work.
Linux, BTW, is primarily a development environment.  It was designed and built by developers for developers.  Windows is an end-user environment which has to be supplemented for development.
Linux was originally focused on developers.  All the tools you need are either already there or are part of simple yum or RPM installs.
