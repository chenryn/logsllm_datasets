I have developed a small chat server application using Python and TwistedWeb, which is currently configured to run on localhost. My goal is to deploy this script on a shared server provided by Fatcow.com so that it can run continuously, allowing clients to connect and disconnect as needed.

However, I have encountered some limitations with the hosting service. Fatcow.com only provides Python 2.5 and does not support SSH connections or the installation of custom libraries, such as Twisted. As a result, I am unable to run my Python socket application as a server on their platform.

After contacting Fatcow.com's support team, they confirmed that these constraints cannot be bypassed, making it impossible to achieve my objective with their service. Therefore, I have concluded that this approach is not feasible with Fatcow.com.

Thank you for any assistance or alternative suggestions.
