User: I have a small application written in python using TwistedWeb. It is a chat server.
Everything is configured right now as for localhost.
All I want is to run this python script on a server(shared server provided by Fatcow.com).
I mean that the script will be working all the time and some clients will connect/disconnect to it. Fatcow gives me python 2.5 without any custom libraries. Is there a way and a tutorial how to make it work with TwistedWeb?
Thanks in advice.
Assistant: I have contacted Fatcow.com support. They do not support SSH connections and do not support Python 2.7 with Twisted library, especially python socket application as server. So it is dead end.
Question resolved.
