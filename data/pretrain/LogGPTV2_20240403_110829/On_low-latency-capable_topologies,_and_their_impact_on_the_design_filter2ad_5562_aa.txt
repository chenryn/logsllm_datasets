ABSTRACT
SpaceX has filed plans with the US Federal Communications
Committee (FCC) to build a constellation of 4,425 low Earth
orbit communication satellites. It will use phased array anten-
nas for up and downlinks and laser communication between
satellites to provide global low-latency high bandwidth cover-
age. To understand the latency propertes of such a network,
we built a simulator based on public details from the FCC
filings. We evaluate how to use the laser links to provide a net-
work, and look at the problem of routing on this network. We
provide a preliminary evaluation of how well such a network
can provide low-latency communications, and examine its
multipath properties. We conclude that a network built in this
manner can provide lower latency communications than any
possible terrestrial optical fiber network for communications
over distances greater than about 3000 km.
1 INTRODUCTION
As network bandwidths have increased, latency has emerged
as being the limiting factor for many networked systems,
ranging from the extremes of high frequency trading, to the
more mundane effects of latency on VoIP, online gaming, and
web performance[2]. Fundamentally, once traffic engineering
has mitigated congestion[7, 9] and buffer bloat has been ad-
dressed, for wide-area traffic the remaining problem is that
the speed of light in glass simply isn’t fast enough.
In recent FCC filings[12], SpaceX proposed and subse-
quently received permission to launch Starlink, a constella-
tion of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites to provide low-latency,
high-bitrate global Internet connectivity. These filings provide
a great deal of detail about the RF links between the satellites
and the ground, including how phased-array antennas can
steer narrow transmission beams for both up and downlinks.
The filings do not discuss in any detail satellite to satellite
communications, but do state that free-space lasers will be
used. No radio spectrum for satellite-to-satellite communica-
tion is requested, so lasers must be the primary communica-
tion link between satellites. Crucial to the low-latency story
is that free-space lasers communicate at c, the speed of light
in a vacuum, which is ≈ 47% higher that in glass[4].

Starlink represents a new category of wide-area backbone,
where thousands of satellites move and connect in a pre-
dictable pattern, but due to orbital constraints the network is
far from a simple static mesh. We ground our study in the
basic properties of the Starlink deployment, and proceed by
simulating routing designs on such a network. Where details
are not publicly available, we adopt reasonable parameters
from first principles. Our goal is to provide early insight into
the interactions between the dynamic topology of the constel-
lation, how routing might work over such a novel network
architecture, and emergent end-to-end latency properties.
2 STARLINK
In Starlink’s initial phase, 1,600 satellites in 1,150 km altitude
orbits will provide connectivity to all except far north and
south regions of the world. A second phase adds another
2,825 satellites in orbits ranging from 1,100 km altitude to
1325 km, increasing density of coverage at lower latitudes and
providing coverage at least as far as 70 degrees North. Finally,
in an additional FCC filing SpaceX proposes launching an
additional 7,518 satellites in approximately 340 km VLEO
orbits. In this paper, we examine only the LEO constellation.
SpaceX’s FCC filings necessarily concentrate on the prop-
erties of phased-array beam steering and spectrum allocations,
so as to demonstrate they will not interfere with other spec-
trum users. In contrast, we are mostly concerned with satellite-
to-satellite communication, and primarily consider the RF up
and down links from the point of view of which satellites can
be reached from which ground location at any time. The main
restriction is that satellites are considered reachable if, from
the ground, they are within 40 degrees from the vertical.
The FCC filings also discuss debris risks when the Starlink
satellites are finally de-orbited. We see that each satellite will
have five 1.5 kg silicon carbide “communication components”
that may survive reentry due to silicon carbide’s melting
point of 2,730C. This material is used in mirrors for laser
communication links. A good working assumption is that
each satellite will have five free-space laser links to connect
to other Starlink satellites. In fact, as we shall explore, five
laser links per satellite is also effectively the minimum number
needed to build a low-latency dense LEO network.
While free-space optical communications have been tested
in orbit, no high-bitrate system exists that operates over the
moderate distances Starlink will use, except for SpaceX’s
own pair of test satellites launched in Feb 2018. In 2014, the
European Data Relay System (EDRS) achieved 1.8 Gb/s from
LEO to geostationary earth orbit (GEO), across a distance
of 45,000 km[13]. ESA claims that the design is capable
of 7.2Gb/s. In contrast, the distances in Starlink are much
lower - most links are likely to be 1000 km or less. At EDRS
distances, lasers will spread due to diffraction. If Starlink
simulations[8] shows their motion, and other results from this
paper. It should be immediately clear that coverage provided
is not uniform - the constellation is much denser at latitudes
approaching 53◦ North and South. For example, London is
located at 51.5◦ N, and will have approximately 30 satellites
overhead within the 40◦ RF coverage angle.
For the second deployment phase, there are an additional
1,600 satellites in 53.8°inclination orbits. These are 40 km
lower than the first phase satellites, so they orbit slightly faster.
A 53°and a 53.8°satellite that start close together in the sky
will slowly drift apart. To provide spatial diversity for the RF
beams, it makes most sense to stagger their orbital planes
so that the 53.8°orbital planes are equidistant between the
53°orbital planes at the equator. The bottom graph in Figure 1
shows minimum crossing distances vs orbital phase offsets
for this constellation. We conclude that 17/32 is the best phase
offset, though a few other values also appear to be viable.
Performing a similar analysis for the satellites in higher
inclination orbits, and arranging them to maximize minimum
distance between their orbital planes, we end up with the
4,425 satellite constellation, as shown in Figure 3. Coverage
over extreme latitudes is still sparse, but appears to be suffi-
cient to satisfy FCC requirements to cover Alaska, and also
provide some polar routes for long distance communication.
3 BUILDING A NETWORK
Given five laser links per satellite and knowledge of orbits,
we can now approach the coupled problems of how to build a
network, and how to route on that network. The first question
is which satellites should we interconnect with lasers?
A dense LEO constellation like Starlink has two main
advantages over terrestrial networks. First, it can connect
almost anywhere, however remote. Second, the speed of light
in a vacuum, c, is ≈ 47% higher than in optical fiber. The
ability to connect anywhere is important, but we speculate
that providing low-latency wide area communication will be
where the money to maintain and operate such a network is
made, connecting cities that are already well connected using
optical fiber, but with lower latency as a premium service.
Already there are new private microwave relay links between
New York and Chicago[11], London and Frankfurt[1], and
London and Paris. These links have relatively low capacity
compared to fiber, but are of high enough value to the finance
industry to be worth building new low latency links.
Starlink’s LEO satellites will be in 1,110 to 1,325 km orbits.
Although much lower than GEO, this is still too high to pro-
vide lower latency than fiber over shorter distances. However,
over longer distances the extra latency getting between Earth
and the nearest satellite may be more than offset by routing
around the world between the satellites at c. The primary
goal then, seems to be to connect key population centers with
satellite paths that run close to the great circle route.
Let us first consider the 1,600 satellites in phase 1. To
maintain good paths, most laser links must be up at any time.
This constrains the solutions. Except at the extreme north and

uses similar power lasers, the inverse square law suggests that
received power on Starlink could be as much as 2000 times
greater than on EDRS. It seems probable that free-space laser
link speeds of 100 Gb/s or higher will be possible. However,
in this paper we will refrain from modelling network capacity,
as this is too speculative, and focus instead on latency, which
is constrained only by topology and the speed of light.
