Subject:           OIG Draft Report:  Review of Web Applications Security and Intrusion Detection 
in Air Traffic Control Systems 
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) appreciates the Department of Transportation 
(DOT) Office of the Inspector General (OIG) efforts in the subject draft report that will assist 
FAA in identifying weaknesses in the FAA web infrastructure that have not previously been 
detected. 
FAA operates with the ongoing knowledge that Cyber security is one of the key components to 
the safe operation of the National Air Space System (NAS) and Cyber security is a top priority 
for FAA as identified in the FAA Flight Plan.  The Air Traffic Organization (ATO) places the 
highest priority on pursuing and maintaining a safe and secure Air Traffic Control (ATC) 
system. 
ATO recognizes that constant vigilance and effective and expeditious action are the keys to 
addressing Cyber security in its ATC systems.  It has demonstrated its commitment to ensuring 
NAS safety and Cyber security through the extensive measures it has taken to reduce the risk of 
Cyber attack.  Some of these steps include:  implementing a comprehensive Information System 
Security (ISS) Program in support of Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) 
requirements; separating NAS operational ATC systems from Mission Support and 
Administrative systems; identifying and fixing Cyber security weakness in a prioritized process, 
with expedited processes in place to address critical issues identified as high priority; and 
modernizing ATO Cyber security through improvements in processes and technology. 
One important element of NAS system Cyber security is the separation of infrastructure 
elements.  Specifically, the FAA networking infrastructure is comprised of two major networks 
that are separated physically and logically: 
       Appendix A.  Management Comments 
17
•  The FAA Administrative/ATC Mission Support (Admin/MS) Network:  Provides Wide 
Area Network (WAN) support to FAA services, except ATC operations. 
•  The National Airspace System (NAS) Network:  Provides WAN services that support ATC 
operations. ATC systems are prohibited by FAA Order 1370.95, Wide Area Network 
Connectivity Security, from directly connecting to the FAA Admin/MS Network or any other  
on-NAS network. 
The OIG report findings focus entirely on vulnerabilities associated with Admin/MS system 
assets.  The OIG used commercially available scanning tools to assess the security of the 
Admin/MS elements of the ATO infrastructure and vulnerabilities were identified.  FAA 
recognizes the importance of dealing with all identified system vulnerabilities in a logical and 
orderly manner, and will treat vulnerabilities identified in the OIG report with the utmost 
diligence and conduct mitigation to include as many families of vulnerabilities as possible in 
parallel.  Immediate attention will be focused on mitigating high and moderate risk 
vulnerabilities in FAA public facing websites and FAA websites that provide Mission Support 
services. 
OIG Recommendation 1:  Ensure that all Web applications used in ATC systems are 
configured in compliance with Government security standards. 
FAA Response:  Concur.  The FAA Telecommunications Infrastructure (FTI) NAS IP WAN 
currently has intrusion-detection-system (IDS) sensors deployed that monitor data flow into and 
out of 27 ATC NAS operational facilities, which provides coverage for all NAS IP connected 
facilities.  In addition, internal NAS facility IP demarcation points between NAS entities and 
Mission Support entities have been identified by the FAA as requiring additional IDS sensors to 
be installed.  Vulnerabilities identified in the OIG report will be prioritized based on their level 
of risk and addressed through the ATO Certification and Accreditation (C&A) Remediation 
Management process.  Web applications are also assessed as part of system C&A Risk 
Assessments conducted on a 3-year cycle, and will receive continued scrutiny and attention as 
risks are identified.  
FAA is actively analyzing the OIG audit report raw data, which will correlate OIG report 
findings to FAA systems so that new Plans of Action and Milestones (POAMs) can be 
developed.  The analysis will be complete by April 30, 2009.  The FAA uses the DOT Secure 
Web Application Standards as the basis for securely configuring web applications and will 
ensure that the web applications identified in the OIG report are in compliance with these 
standards.  New system POAM items will be developed by July 31, 2009; however, FAA will 
take immediate corrective action on any critical vulnerabilities. 
In addition, the ATO ISS Program Compliance/Audit Plan ensures that FAA has a valid NAS 
ATC operational web application inventory that is configured in accordance with DOT Secure 
Web Application Standards. 
OIG Recommendation 2:  Strengthen the patch management process by (a) identifying 
Web applications with known vulnerabilities, and (b) promptly installing relevant security 
patches in a timely manner. 
       Appendix A.  Management Comments

FAA Response:  Concur.  Security patching vulnerabilities identified in the OIG report will be 
addressed via the ATO C&A Remediation Management process.  The vulnerabilities identified 
by OIG are being assessed, and remediation actions will be prioritized based on the level of risk 
presented.  As part of the ATO ISS Program Compliance/Audit Plan defined in Recommendation 
1, the audit/compliance team will be auditing the existence of appropriate security patches.  The 
FAA is analyzing the specific scanning tool report data provided by OIG and is correlating 
findings to FAA systems for POAM development.  Patch implementation will be performed in 
accordance with established FAA configuration management processes.  System POAM items 
will be developed by July 31, 2009; however, FAA will take immediate corrective action on any 
critical vulnerabilities. 
As part of its standardized process for patch management, ATO Security Certification Teams are 
responsible for ensuring that patch management procedures are properly developed and 
implemented.  The ATO has developed a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) template and 
guidance document for the NIST SP 800-53 System Integrity (SI) control family that defines the 
patch management procedures to be implemented for each system.  The ATO ISS Program 
conducted a workshop in December 2008 to review the security SOP guidance and ensure that 
Security Certification Teams and System Owners understand the procedure development 
requirements.  FAA will continue its efforts to ensure that this process results in the timely and 
effective implementation of system patches. 
OIG Recommendation 3: Take immediate action to correct high-risk vulnerabilities and 
establish a timetable for remediation of all remaining identified during this audit. 
FAA Response:  Concur.  FAA recognizes that the vulnerability scanning tools used to perform 
the OIG Web Audit did identify some vulnerabilities in the Admin/MS systems.  The FAA takes 
all security vulnerabilities very seriously and will ensure that the high rated vulnerabilities that 
are correlated to FAA systems as part of the actions defined in the responses to 
Recommendations 1 and 2 are handled as high priority configuration management changes for 
immediate implementation.  Implementation will be tracked via the POAM process.  The FAA is 
now reviewing the detailed data from the OIG's testing.  As part of that review, it is evaluating 
the extent of which those vulnerabilities identified in the draft report as high risk coincide with 
FAA's definition of high risk and conform to NIST standards.  In addition, vulnerabilities 
identified by FAA internal scans are also receiving priority attention and will be remediated.  
Lower priority issues will be addressed as appropriate.  The review of vulnerabilities identified 
by the OIG will be completed April 30, 2009.  Based on the findings, the FAA will develop a 
timetable for remediation by July 31, 2009; however, FAA will take immediate corrective action 
on any critical vulnerabilities. 
OIG Recommendation 4: Resolve differences with Cyber Security Management Center 
(CSMC) and establish a timetable for deploying IDS monitoring devices covering local 
area networks at all ATC facilities. 
FAA Response:  Concur.  FAA intends to ensure that it has a smooth and effective working 
relationship with the CSMC that is conducive to expeditious and effective interactions.  While 
FAA believes that the relationship with CSMC is essentially sound, within 30 days, the FAA  
       Appendix A.  Management Comments

Chief Information Officer (CIO) along with the CIO for ATO will meet with the CSMC 
leadership to discuss strengths and weaknesses of interactions between their organizations and 
identify any areas in need of improvement.  In addition, the FAA CIO is creating service level 
agreements with all FAA lines of business. 
In regard to IDS monitoring devices, FAA has actions underway to complete its network of IDS 
monitoring systems and is currently implementing and monitoring boundary and internal 
network protection measures. 
As an added measure of NAS operations network protection, the FAA FTI NAS IP WAN 
currently has IDS sensors deployed that monitor data flow into and out of 27 ATC NAS 
operational facilities, which provides coverage for all NAS IP connected facilities.  The FTI 
NAS IP WAN is configured to provide these IDS sensors with visibility into the data traffic 
traveling into and out of the NAS operational LAN infrastructures as well as all other NAS IP 
WAN connected facility LANs.  This existing configuration allows for reviewing the majority of 
IP data traffic that is used for NAS ATC operational systems.  Additionally, the FTI service has a 
Security Operations Center that monitors the IDS sensor data and works with appropriate FAA 
Cyber security organizations, including the CSMC, to resolve security events. 
As an additional level of protection, internal NAS facility IP demarcation points between NAS 
entities and Mission Support entities have been identified by the FAA as requiring additional 
IDS sensors to be installed.  While it would not be appropriate to discuss the specific 
demarcation points in this memo, FAA would be happy to provide details to the OIG in another 
forum.  However, we note that some of these IDS systems will be fully operational this year, 
having passed key site testing on March 10, 2009.  The current completion date for the 
implementation of all IDS's at ARTS IIIE facilities is February 2010.  A deployment strategy for 
the remaining automation systems will be developed by December 2009. 
OIG Recommendation 5. In conjunction with CSMC officials, identify the information 
needed for remediation and establish procedures to ensure timely remediation of cyber 
incidents based on criticality as assessed by CSMC. 
FAA Response:  Concur.  The ATO has recently implemented two process improvements: a 
Reconciliation of Findings process; and an Open Incident Handling process, thereby reducing the 
number of open incidents.  The improved processes have reduced the amount of time to respond 
to new CSMC findings, provided more efficient tracking of all open findings, and allowed for 
more comprehensive documentation and reporting capability. 
In conjunction with CSMC, ATO has taken steps to improve timely response of cyber incidents. 
Specifically, the CSMC and ATO are working together through focused meetings and cyber 
security related workshops to refine the process of identifying the criticality of information for 
event remediation.  A refined process will be developed by August 2009.
