has been impacted by a massive error. This condition requires
Ô¨Årst that j builds, for all the devices in Lk(j), all the sets
of collections of disjoint r-consistent motions. Then, for each
set of these collections, j veriÔ¨Åes that there always exists a
dense motion containing j such that none of the elements of
this dense motion can belong to one of these collections. The
question that naturally comes up is whether this computation
complexity is worth regarding the performance of the sufÔ¨Åcient
condition of Theorem 6. To answer this question, we have
generated conÔ¨Ågurations of errors that maximize the number of
devices that exhibit massive anomalies. This has been achieved
by setting the probability G that an isolated error impacts a
device to a small constant Œµ. Table II and Table III summarize
the main obtained trends. Table II provides the repartition of
each set Ik, Mk (detected by Theorem 6 and by Theorem 7),
and Uk for A = 20 generated errors and |Ak| = 100
impacted devices. The main result is that in average no more
than 0.4% of devices impacted by massive anomalies are
missed by Theorem 6. This result is very interesting given
the computational cost incurred by the NSC of Theorem 7.
In Table III, the cost corresponding to column Ik represents
the average number of maximal motions that device j ‚àà Ik
belongs to. For the second column, the cost represents the
number of maximal dense motions that device j ‚àà Mk belongs

to. For the third column,

the
collections of dense motions containing the devices in Lk(j).
C. Granularity of the snapshots
Any online detection system should be able to quickly
identify the presence of isolated or massive anomalies to
rapidly Ô¨Åx or conÔ¨Åne the events or errors that lead to these
anomalies. Typically, this largely depends on the frequency
at which the system can sample the QoS information of the
devices it monitors. In our approach, the frequency of QoS
information sampling is locally tuned, and only depends on
the local occurrence of anomalies. Thus by avoiding any kind
of global synchronization, devices can efÔ¨Åciently provide a
Ô¨Åne grain event/errors detection without impacting the rest
of the system. An enjoyable consequence of this local tun-
ing is that devices can afford to increase the frequency at
which they sample their neighborhood, decreasing accordingly
the number of concomitant errors and thus the number of
unresolved conÔ¨Ågurations. This is illustrated in Figure 7.
This Ô¨Ågure shows the percentage of unresolved conÔ¨Ågurations
as a function of the number of errors generated between
two snapshots of the system and the type of errors (that is
when G = 1, only isolated errors are generated, while for
G = 0 up to all the devices in the vicinity of an impacted
device can be impacted). This Ô¨Ågure conÔ¨Årms the fact that
when a single error (isolated or massive) is generated then
no unresolved conÔ¨Ågurations exists. Now for an increasing
number of errors, the number of unresolved conÔ¨Ågurations
augments. Note that the impact of massive errors is more
signiÔ¨Åcant on the number of unresolved conÔ¨Ågurations because
it increases the number of conÔ¨Ågurations where a device can
belong to several maximal dense motions.
D. Pertinence of Restriction R3
We Ô¨Ånally show that the impact of Restriction R3 on the
accuracy of Ik and Mk is relatively weak. Indeed, to model the
impact of errors, we have assumed that if a device belongs to a
œÑ-dense motion then this device has necessarily been impacted
by an error that has impacted many other devices. While

Proportion of missed detection as a function of A and G when
relevant in many situations, we show in the following the
proportion of devices for which the second part of Restriction
R3 does not hold. Figure 8 shows the proportion of devices that
claim to have been impacted by a massive error (in accordance
with our model) although it was an isolated one, as a function
of the frequency of the snapshots (represented by the number
of generated errors between two snapshots). This Ô¨Ågure shows
that in the worst case, this proportion is less than 10%, and
it remains constant whatever the number of errors. Which is
an interesting result. Finally, Figure 9 shows that Restriction
R3 has no impact on the number of unresolved conÔ¨Ågurations,
which comes from the fact that unresolved conÔ¨Ågurations are
essentially due to the superposition of massive errors.
VIII. CONCLUSION
This paper has been devoted to the on-line detection of
errors or events in large scale systems according to the extent
of their damage. We have proposed a new approach that fully
relies on the local knowledge of each impacted device to
provide the monitoring application the essential information
that should help them to be continuously aware of the state of
the system. This has been achieved by modelling the impact of
errors on devices as consistent and close trajectories in a QoS
space. We have derived necessary and sufÔ¨Åcient conditions
locally applicable. We have validated the pertinence of our
model by comparing the output of our algorithms with a
large spectrum of scenarios of errors. Finally, by design, our

approach is scalable. As future work, we plan to extend our
characterization to take into account malicious devices. In
particular, we will study the presence of collusion of malicious
devices whose aim would be to prevent an impacted device to
be detected by the monitoring application.
