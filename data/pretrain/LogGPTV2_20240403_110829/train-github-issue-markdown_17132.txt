The code in this gist triggers an unusual error on macOS. When attempting to create and display a 6x6 `Array{Float64,2}`, the following error message is generated:

```
ERROR: LoadError: ArgumentError: can't repeat a string -1 times

```

This error consistently occurs on macOS (but not on Linux) during the 143rd iteration of the algorithm. Interestingly, removing any of the printing statements from the code resolves the issue.

Here are the system details for reference:
