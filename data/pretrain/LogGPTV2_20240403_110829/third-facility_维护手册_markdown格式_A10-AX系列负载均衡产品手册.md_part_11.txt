device. The neighbor device is expected to send the packet back over the same link.
bfd enable
Description Globally enable BFD packet processing.
Syntax [no] bfd enable
Default Disabled
Mode Configuration mode
bfd interval
Description Configure BFD timers.
Syntax [no] bfd interval ms min-rx ms multiplier num
Parameter Description
interval ms Rate at which the ACOS device sends BFD control packets to its BFD neighbors. You can specify
48-1000 milliseconds (ms). The default is 800 ms.
min-rx ms Minimum amount of time in milliseconds that the ACOS device waits to receive a BFD control
packet from a BFD neighbor. If a control packet is not received within the specified time, the
multiplier (below) is incremented by 1. You can specify 48-1000 ms. The default is 800 ms.
multiplier num Maximum number of consecutive times the ACOS device will wait for a BFD control packet
from a neighbor. If the multiplier value is reached, the ACOS device concludes that the routing
process on the neighbor is down. You can specify 3-50. The default is 4
Usage If you configure the interval timers on an individual interface, then the interface settings are
used instead of the global settings. Similarly, if the BFD timers have not been configured on
an interface, then the interface will use the global settings.
NOTE: BFD always uses the globally configured interval timer if it's for a BGP loopback
neighbor.

rent running config.
Syntax block-merge-end
Default N/A
Mode Block-merge configuration mode
Usage This command exits block-merge configuration mode and merges all of your new configura-
tion with the existing running configuration. In the case of overlapping configurations, the
new configuration will be used and any child instances will be deleted. Any old configura-
tions which are not replaced in block-merge mode will remain in the running configuration
after this command is entered. The new configurations are merged into the running configu-
ration without disturbing live traffic.
block-merge-start
Description Use this command to enter block-merge configuration mode.
Syntax block-merge-start
This command takes you to the Block-merge configuration level, where all configuration
commands are available.
Default Disabled.
Mode Global configuration mode.
Usage This command enters block-merge configuration mode but leaves the ACOS device up.
While in block-merge mode, new configurations will not be entered into the running config-
uration. At the block-merge configuration level, you can enter new configurations which you
want to merge into the running configuration. Any configuration that overlaps with the cur-
rent running configuration will be replaced when ending block-merge mode. Any configura-
tions in the running config which are not configured in block-merge mode will continue to
be included in the running configuration mode after exiting block-merge mode.
block-replace-end
Description Enter this command to end block-replace configuration mode and replace the current run-
ning configuration with the new configurations.
Syntax block-replace-end
Default N/A
Mode Block-replace configuration mode.

Usage This command enters block-replace configuration mode but leaves the ACOS device up.
While in block-replace mode, new configurations will not be entered into the running con-
figuration. At the block-replace configuration level, you can enter a new configuration which
you want to replace the running configuration. All of the running configuration will be
replaced when ending block-merge mode. If an object that exists in the running configura-
tion is not configured in block-replace, then all configurations for that object will be removed
upon ending block-replace mode.
boot-block-fix
Description Repair the master boot record (MBR) on the hard drive or compact flash.
Syntax boot-block-fix {cf | hd}
Parameter Description
cf Repair the compact flash.
hd Repair the hard disk.
Default N/A
Mode Configuration mode
Usage If the ACOS device is a member of an aVCS virtual chassis, use the device-context com-
mand to specify the device in the chassis to which to apply this command.
Usage The MBR is the boot sector located at the very beginning of a boot drive. Under advisement
from A10 Networks, you can use the command if your compact flash or hard drive cannot
boot. If this occurs, boot from the other drive, then use this command.

bootimage
Description Specify the boot image location from which to load the system image the next time the
ACOS device is rebooted.
Syntax bootimage {cf pri | hd {pri | sec}}
Parameter Description
cf | hd Boot medium. The ACOS device always tries to boot using the hard
disk (hd) first. The compact flash (cf) is used only if the hard disk is
unavailable.
pri | sec Boot image location, primary or secondary.
Default The default location is primary, for both the hard disk and the compact flash.
Mode Configuration mode
Usage If the ACOS device is a member of an aVCS virtual chassis, use the device-context com-
mand to specify the device in the chassis to which to apply this command.
Example The following command configures the ACOS device to boot from the secondary image area
on the hard disk the next time the device is rebooted:
ACOS(config)# bootimage hd sec
Secondary image will be used if system is booted from hard disk
ACOS(config)#
bpdu-fwd-group
Description Configure a group of tagged Ethernet interfaces for forwarding Bridge Protocol Data Units
(BPDUs). BPDU forwarding groups enable you to use the ACOS device in a network that runs
Spanning Tree Protocol (STP).
A BPDU forwarding group is a set of tagged Ethernet interfaces that will accept and
broadcast STP BPDUs among themselves. When an interface in a BPDU forwarding group
receives an STP BPDU (a packet addressed to MAC address 01-80-C2-00-00-00), the interface
broadcasts the BPDU to all the other interfaces in the group.
Syntax [no] bpdu-fwd-group group-num
Replace group-num with the BPDU forwarding group number (1-8).
If the ACOS device is a member of an aVCS virtual chassis, specify the group number as
follows: DeviceID/group-num
This command changes the CLI to the configuration level for the BPDU forwarding group,
where the following command is available.
[no] ethernet portnum [to portnum] [ethernet portnum]
Document No.: 410-P2-CLI-001 - 6/17/2016 | page 96
A10 Thunder Series and AX Series—Command Line Interface Reference
This command enables you to specify the ethernet interfaces you want to add to the BPDU
forwarding group.
Default None
Mode Configuration mode
Usage This command is specifically for configuring VLAN-tagged interfaces to accept and forward
BPDUs.
Rules for trunk interfaces:
• BPDUs are broadcast only to the lead interface in the trunk.
• If a BPDU is received on an Ethernet interface that belongs to a trunk, the BPDU is not
broadcast to any other members of the same trunk.
Example The following commands create BPDU forwarding group 1 containing Ethernet ports 1-3,
and verify the configuration:
ACOS(config)# bpdu-fwd-group 1
ACOS(config-bpdu-fwd-group:1)# ethernet 1 to 3
ACOS(config-bpdu-fwd-group:1)# show bpdu-fwd-group
BPDU forward Group 1 members: ethernet 1 to 3
bridge-vlan-group
Description Configure a bridge VLAN group for VLAN-to-VLAN bridging.
Syntax [no] bridge-vlan-group group-num
Replace group-num with the bridge VLAN group number.
If the ACOS device is a member of an aVCS virtual chassis, specify the group number as
follows: DeviceID/group-num
This command changes the CLI to the configuration level for the specified bridge VLAN
group, where the following configuration commands are available:
Command Description
forward-all-traffic Configures the bridge VLAN group to be able to forward all kinds of
traffic.
forward-ip-traffic Configures the bridge VLAN group to be able to typical traffic
between hosts, such as ARP requests and responses.
This is the default setting.
[no] name string Specifies a name for the group. The string can be 1-63 characters
long. If the string contains blank spaces, use double quotation marks
around the entire string.
There is no default name set.
page 97 | Document No.: 410-P2-CLI-001 - 6/17/2016
A10 Thunder Series and AX Series—Command Line Interface Reference
Command Description
[no] router-interface ve num Adds a Virtual Ethernet (VE) interface to the group. This command is
applicable only on ACOS devices deployed in routed (gateway)
mode. The VE number must be the same as the lowest numbered
VLAN in the group.
By default this is not set.
[no] vrid num Configure a VRID for the bridge VLAN group; this can be used with
additional groups sharing the same VRID in VRRP-A configurations.
[no] vlan vlan-id Adds VLANs to the group.
[vlan vlan-id ... | to vlan vlan-id]
By default this is not set.
Default By default, the configuration does not contain any bridge VLAN groups. When you create a
bridge VLAN group, it has the default settings described above.
Mode Configuration mode
Usage VLAN-to-VLAN bridging is useful in cases where reconfiguring the hosts on the network
either into the same VLAN, or into different IP subnets, is not desired or is impractical.
In bridge VLAN group configurations, the VE number must be the same as the lowest
numbered VLAN in the group.
Example For more information, including configuration notes and examples, see the “VLAN-to-VLAN
Bridging” chapter in the System Configuration and Administration Guide.
cgnv6
Description CGN and IPv6 migration commands.
For more information about these commands, refer to the Command Line Interface Reference
(for CGN).
class-list (for Aho-Corasick)
Description Configure an Aho-Corasick class list. This type of class list can be used to match on Server
Name Indication (SNI) values.
Syntax [no] class-list list-name ac [file filename]
Parameter Description
list-name Adds the list to the running-config.
ac Identifies this as an Aho-Corasick class list.
filename Saves the list to a standalone file on the ACOS device.
NOTE: A class list can be exported only if you use the file option.
Document No.: 410-P2-CLI-001 - 6/17/2016 | page 98
A10 Thunder Series and AX Series—Command Line Interface Reference
This command changes the CLI to the configuration level for the specified class list, where
the following commands are available:
Command Description
[no] contains sni-string Matches if the specified string appears anywhere within the SNI value.
[no] ends-with sni-string Matches only if the SNI value ends with the specified string.
[no] equals sni-string Matches only if the SNI value completely matches the specified string.
[no] starts-with sni-string Matches only if the SNI value starts with the specified string.
(The other commands are common to all CLI configuration levels. See “Config Commands:
Global” on page61.)
Default None
Mode Configuration mode
Usage The match options are always applied in the following order, regardless of the order in which
the rules appear in the configuration.
• Equals
• Starts-with
• Contains
• Ends-with
If a template has more than one rule with the same match option (equals, starts-with,
contains, or ends-with) and an SNI value matches on more than one of them, the most-
specific match is always used.
If you delete a file-based class list (no class-list list-name), save the configuration
(“write memory” on page57) to complete the deletion.
class-list (for IP limiting)
Description Configure an IP class list for use with the IP limiting feature.
Syntax [no] class-list list-name
[ac | dns | ipv4 | ipv6 | string | string-case-insensitive]
[file filename]
Parameter Description
list-name Adds the list to the running-config.
ac Identifies this as an Aho-Corasick class list.
dns Identifies this as a DNS class list.
ipv4 | ipv6 Identifies this as an IPv4 or IPv6 class list.
string Identifies this as a string class list.
page 99 | Document No.: 410-P2-CLI-001 - 6/17/2016
A10 Thunder Series and AX Series—Command Line Interface Reference
Parameter Description
string-case-insensitive Identifies this as a case-insensitive string class list.
file filename Saves the list to a standalone file on the ACOS device.
NOTE: A class list can be exported only if you use the file option.
This command changes the CLI to the configuration level for the specified class list, where
the following command is available:
(The other commands are common to all CLI configuration levels. See “Config Commands:
Global” on page61.)
[no] {ipaddr/network-mask | ipv6-addr/prefix-length}
[glid num | lid num]
This command adds an entry to the class list.
Parameter Description
ipaddr /network-mask Specifies the IPv4 host or subnet address of the client. The network-mask specifies
the network mask.
To configure a wildcard IP address, specify 0.0.0.0 /0. The wildcard address matches
on all addresses that do not match any entry in the class list.
ipv6-addr/subnet-length Specifies the IPv6 host or network address of the client.
glid num | lid num Specifies the ID of the IP limiting rule to use for matching clients. You can use a sys-
tem-wide (global) IP limiting rule or an IP limiting rule configured in a PBSLB policy
template.
• To use an IP limiting rule configured at the Configuration mode level, use the
glid num option.
• To use an IP limiting rule configured at the same level (in the same PBSLB policy
template) as the class list, use the lid num option.
To exclude a host or subnet from being limited, do not specify an IP limiting rule.
Default None
Mode Configuration mode
Usage Configure the GLIDs or LIDs before configuring the class list entries. To configure a GLID or
LID for IP limiting, see “glid” on page123 or “slb template policy” in the Command Line Inter-
face Reference for ADC.
As an alternative to configuring class entries on the ACOS device, you can configure the class
list using a text editor on another device, then import the class list onto the ACOS device. To
import a class list, see “import” on page46.
NOTE: If you use a class-list file that is periodically re-imported, the age for class-list entries
added to the system from the file does not reset when the class-list file is re-
Document No.: 410-P2-CLI-001 - 6/17/2016 | page 100
A10 Thunder Series and AX Series—Command Line Interface Reference
imported. Instead, the entries are allowed to continue aging normally. This is by
design.
For more information about IP limiting, see the DDoS Mitigation Guide (for ADC).
If you delete a file-based class list (no class-list list-name), save the configuration
(“write memory” on page57) to complete the deletion.
Request Limiting and Request-Rate Limiting in Class Lists
If a LID or GLID in a class list contains settings for request limiting or request-rate limiting, the
settings apply only if the following conditions are true:
1.The LID or GLID is used within a policy template.
2.The policy template is bound to a virtual port.
In this case, the settings apply only to the virtual port. The settings do not apply in any of the
following cases:
• The policy template is applied to the virtual server, instead of the virtual port.
• The settings are in a system-wide GLID.
• The settings are in a system-wide policy template.
NOTE: This limitation does not apply to connection limiting or connection-rate limiting.
Those settings are valid in all the cases listed above.
Example The following commands configure class list “global”, which matches on all clients, and uses
IP limiting rule 1:
ACOS(config)#class-list global
ACOS(config-class list)#0.0.0.0/0 glid 1
class-list (for VIP-based DNS caching)
Description Configure an IP class list for use VIP-based DNS caching.
Syntax class-list list-name dns [file filename]
Parameter Description
list-name Adds the list to the running-config.
dns Identifies this list as a DNS class list.
file filename Saves the list to a file.
This command changes the CLI to the configuration level for the specified class list, where
the following command is available:
[no] dns match-option domain-string lid num
page 101 | Document No.: 410-P2-CLI-001 - 6/17/2016
A10 Thunder Series and AX Series—Command Line Interface Reference
This command specifies the match conditions for domain strings and maps matching strings
to LIDs.
Parameter Description
match-option Specifies the match criteria for the domain-string. The match-option
can be one of the following:
• dns contains – The entry matches if the DNS request is for a
domain name that contains the domain-string anywhere within
the requested domain name.
• dns starts-with – The entry matches if the DNS request is for
a domain name that begins with the domain-string.
• dns ends-with – The entry matches if the DNS request is for a
domain name that ends with the domain-string.
domain-string Specifies all or part of the domain name on which to match. You
can use the wildcard character * (asterisk) to match on any single
