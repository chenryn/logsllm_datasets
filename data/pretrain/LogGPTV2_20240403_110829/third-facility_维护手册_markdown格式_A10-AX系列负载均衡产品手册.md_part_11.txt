### BFD (Bidirectional Forwarding Detection) Configuration

**bfd enable**
- **Description**: Globally enables BFD packet processing.
- **Syntax**: `[no] bfd enable`
- **Default**: Disabled
- **Mode**: Configuration mode

**bfd interval**
- **Description**: Configures BFD timers.
- **Syntax**: `[no] bfd interval <ms> min-rx <ms> multiplier <num>`
- **Parameter Descriptions**:
  - `interval <ms>`: Rate at which the ACOS device sends BFD control packets to its BFD neighbors. You can specify a value between 48-1000 milliseconds (ms). The default is 800 ms.
  - `min-rx <ms>`: Minimum amount of time in milliseconds that the ACOS device waits to receive a BFD control packet from a BFD neighbor. If a control packet is not received within the specified time, the multiplier (below) is incremented by 1. You can specify a value between 48-1000 ms. The default is 800 ms.
  - `multiplier <num>`: Maximum number of consecutive times the ACOS device will wait for a BFD control packet from a neighbor. If the multiplier value is reached, the ACOS device concludes that the routing process on the neighbor is down. You can specify a value between 3-50. The default is 4.
- **Usage**: 
  - If you configure the interval timers on an individual interface, then the interface settings are used instead of the global settings.
  - If the BFD timers have not been configured on an interface, then the interface will use the global settings.
  - **Note**: BFD always uses the globally configured interval timer if it's for a BGP loopback neighbor.

### Big Buffer Pool Configuration

**big-buff-pool**
- **Description**: On high-end models only, you can enable the `big-buff-pool` option to expand support from 4 million to 8 million buffers and increase the buffer index from 22 to 24 bits.
- **Note**: The AX 5200-11 requires 96 Gb of memory to support this feature. To check that your system meets this requirement, use the `show memory system` CLI command.
- **Syntax**: `[no] big-buff-pool`
- **Default**: Disabled
- **Mode**: Configuration mode
- **Example**:
  ```shell
  ACOS(config)# no big-buff-pool
  This will modify your boot profile to disable big I/O buffer pool.
  It will take effect starting from the next reboot.
  Please confirm: You want to disable the big I/O buffer pool (N/Y)? Y
  ```

### Block Configuration Mode Commands

**block-abort**
- **Description**: Exits block-merge or block-replace mode without implementing the new configurations made in block mode.
- **Syntax**: `block-abort`
- **Default**: N/A
- **Mode**: Block-merge or block-replace configuration mode
- **Usage**: Use this command to discard any changes you make while in block-merge or block-replace mode. In order to exit block mode without committing the new configuration changes, use `block-abort`. This command must be entered before `block-merge-end` or `block-replace-end` in order for all block configuration changes to be deleted. This command ends block configuration mode.

**block-merge-end**
- **Description**: Exits block-merge mode and integrates new configurations into the current running config.
- **Syntax**: `block-merge-end`
- **Default**: N/A
- **Mode**: Block-merge configuration mode
- **Usage**: This command exits block-merge configuration mode and merges all of your new configuration with the existing running configuration. In the case of overlapping configurations, the new configuration will be used and any child instances will be deleted. Any old configurations which are not replaced in block-merge mode will remain in the running configuration after this command is entered. The new configurations are merged into the running configuration without disturbing live traffic.

**block-merge-start**
- **Description**: Enters block-merge configuration mode.
- **Syntax**: `block-merge-start`
- **Default**: Disabled
- **Mode**: Global configuration mode
- **Usage**: This command enters block-merge configuration mode but leaves the ACOS device up. While in block-merge mode, new configurations will not be entered into the running configuration. At the block-merge configuration level, you can enter new configurations which you want to merge into the running configuration. Any configuration that overlaps with the current running configuration will be replaced when ending block-merge mode. Any configurations in the running config which are not configured in block-merge mode will continue to be included in the running configuration mode after exiting block-merge mode.

**block-replace-end**
- **Description**: Ends block-replace configuration mode and replaces the current running configuration with the new configurations.
- **Syntax**: `block-replace-end`
- **Default**: N/A
- **Mode**: Block-replace configuration mode
- **Usage**: This command exits block-replace configuration mode and replaces all of your existing configuration with the new configuration. Any old configurations which are not replaced in block-replace mode will be removed in the running configuration after this command is entered. The new configurations become the running configuration without disturbing live traffic.

**block-replace-start**
- **Description**: Enters block-replace configuration mode.
- **Syntax**: `block-replace-start`
- **Default**: Disabled
- **Mode**: Global configuration mode
- **Usage**: This command enters block-replace configuration mode but leaves the ACOS device up. While in block-replace mode, new configurations will not be entered into the running configuration. At the block-replace configuration level, you can enter a new configuration which you want to replace the running configuration. All of the running configuration will be replaced when ending block-replace mode. If an object that exists in the running configuration is not configured in block-replace, then all configurations for that object will be removed upon ending block-replace mode.

### Boot and Image Management Commands

**boot-block-fix**
- **Description**: Repairs the master boot record (MBR) on the hard drive or compact flash.
- **Syntax**: `boot-block-fix {cf | hd}`
- **Parameter Descriptions**:
  - `cf`: Repair the compact flash.
  - `hd`: Repair the hard disk.
- **Default**: N/A
- **Mode**: Configuration mode
- **Usage**: If the ACOS device is a member of an aVCS virtual chassis, use the `device-context` command to specify the device in the chassis to which to apply this command. The MBR is the boot sector located at the very beginning of a boot drive. Under advisement from A10 Networks, you can use this command if your compact flash or hard drive cannot boot. If this occurs, boot from the other drive, then use this command.

**bootimage**
- **Description**: Specifies the boot image location from which to load the system image the next time the ACOS device is rebooted.
- **Syntax**: `bootimage {cf pri | hd {pri | sec}}`
- **Parameter Descriptions**:
  - `cf | hd`: Boot medium. The ACOS device always tries to boot using the hard disk (hd) first. The compact flash (cf) is used only if the hard disk is unavailable.
  - `pri | sec`: Boot image location, primary or secondary.
- **Default**: The default location is primary, for both the hard disk and the compact flash.
- **Mode**: Configuration mode
- **Usage**: If the ACOS device is a member of an aVCS virtual chassis, use the `device-context` command to specify the device in the chassis to which to apply this command.
- **Example**:
  ```shell
  ACOS(config)# bootimage hd sec
  Secondary image will be used if system is booted from hard disk
  ACOS(config)#
  ```

### BPDU Forwarding Group Configuration

**bpdu-fwd-group**
- **Description**: Configures a group of tagged Ethernet interfaces for forwarding Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDUs). BPDU forwarding groups enable you to use the ACOS device in a network that runs Spanning Tree Protocol (STP).
- **Syntax**: `[no] bpdu-fwd-group <group-num>`
- **Parameter Descriptions**:
  - `<group-num>`: Replace with the BPDU forwarding group number (1-8).
  - If the ACOS device is a member of an aVCS virtual chassis, specify the group number as `DeviceID/group-num`.
- **Default**: None
- **Mode**: Configuration mode
- **Usage**: This command is specifically for configuring VLAN-tagged interfaces to accept and forward BPDUs.
- **Rules for trunk interfaces**:
  - BPDUs are broadcast only to the lead interface in the trunk.
  - If a BPDU is received on an Ethernet interface that belongs to a trunk, the BPDU is not broadcast to any other members of the same trunk.
- **Example**:
  ```shell
  ACOS(config)# bpdu-fwd-group 1
  ACOS(config-bpdu-fwd-group:1)# ethernet 1 to 3
  ACOS(config-bpdu-fwd-group:1)# show bpdu-fwd-group
  BPDU forward Group 1 members: ethernet 1 to 3
  ```

### Bridge VLAN Group Configuration

**bridge-vlan-group**
- **Description**: Configures a bridge VLAN group for VLAN-to-VLAN bridging.
- **Syntax**: `[no] bridge-vlan-group <group-num>`
- **Parameter Descriptions**:
  - `<group-num>`: Replace with the bridge VLAN group number.
  - If the ACOS device is a member of an aVCS virtual chassis, specify the group number as `DeviceID/group-num`.
- **Default**: By default, the configuration does not contain any bridge VLAN groups. When you create a bridge VLAN group, it has the default settings described above.
- **Mode**: Configuration mode
- **Usage**: VLAN-to-VLAN bridging is useful in cases where reconfiguring the hosts on the network either into the same VLAN, or into different IP subnets, is not desired or is impractical. In bridge VLAN group configurations, the VE number must be the same as the lowest numbered VLAN in the group.
- **Example**: For more information, including configuration notes and examples, see the “VLAN-to-VLAN Bridging” chapter in the System Configuration and Administration Guide.

### Class List Configuration

**class-list (for Aho-Corasick)**
- **Description**: Configures an Aho-Corasick class list. This type of class list can be used to match on Server Name Indication (SNI) values.
- **Syntax**: `[no] class-list <list-name> ac [file <filename>]`
- **Parameter Descriptions**:
  - `<list-name>`: Adds the list to the running-config.
  - `ac`: Identifies this as an Aho-Corasick class list.
  - `<filename>`: Saves the list to a standalone file on the ACOS device.
- **Note**: A class list can be exported only if you use the `file` option.
- **Default**: None
- **Mode**: Configuration mode
- **Usage**: The match options are always applied in the following order, regardless of the order in which the rules appear in the configuration: Equals, Starts-with, Contains, Ends-with. If a template has more than one rule with the same match option and an SNI value matches on more than one of them, the most-specific match is always used. If you delete a file-based class list (`no class-list <list-name>`), save the configuration (`write memory`) to complete the deletion.

**class-list (for IP limiting)**
- **Description**: Configures an IP class list for use with the IP limiting feature.
- **Syntax**: `[no] class-list <list-name> [ac | dns | ipv4 | ipv6 | string | string-case-insensitive] [file <filename>]`
- **Parameter Descriptions**:
  - `<list-name>`: Adds the list to the running-config.
  - `ac`: Identifies this as an Aho-Corasick class list.
  - `dns`: Identifies this as a DNS class list.
  - `ipv4 | ipv6`: Identifies this as an IPv4 or IPv6 class list.
  - `string`: Identifies this as a string class list.
  - `string-case-insensitive`: Identifies this as a case-insensitive string class list.
  - `<filename>`: Saves the list to a standalone file on the ACOS device.
- **Note**: A class list can be exported only if you use the `file` option.
- **Default**: None
- **Mode**: Configuration mode
- **Usage**: Configure the GLIDs or LIDs before configuring the class list entries. To configure a GLID or LID for IP limiting, see `glid` or `slb template policy` in the Command Line Interface Reference for ADC. As an alternative to configuring class entries on the ACOS device, you can configure the class list using a text editor on another device, then import the class list onto the ACOS device. To import a class list, see `import`.

**class-list (for VIP-based DNS caching)**
- **Description**: Configures an IP class list for use with VIP-based DNS caching.
- **Syntax**: `class-list <list-name> dns [file <filename>]`
- **Parameter Descriptions**:
  - `<list-name>`: Adds the list to the running-config.
  - `dns`: Identifies this list as a DNS class list.
  - `<filename>`: Saves the list to a file.
- **Default**: None
- **Mode**: Configuration mode
- **Usage**: This command specifies the match conditions for domain strings and maps matching strings to LIDs. The match-option can be one of the following: `dns contains`, `dns starts-with`, `dns ends-with`.
