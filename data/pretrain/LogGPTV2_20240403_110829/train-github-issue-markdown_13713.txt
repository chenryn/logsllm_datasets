Any use cases which require an HttpContext attribute to be set aren't covered
in this implementation, and the extensions required make the whole thing so
messy as to make using the Rest Template more of a burden than a benefit. Here
is the particular case that I've been fussing with today to little avail,
setting preemptive authentication (i.e. send basic authentication headers by
default rather than performing 2 requests to authenticate):
http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-
ga/tutorial/html/authentication.html#d4e1023
The problem being that the RestTemplate implementation as it is has no support
for setting HttpContext parameters (the template calls the
Http.execute(HttpUriRequest) which uses only the non-accessible default
HttpContext), there aren't any good ways to set the default context parameters
on the HttpClient in 4.x Apache HTTP Components. You end up needing to extend
HttpClient to provide for default HttpContext params on the HttpClient object
and the whole thing just becomes a spaghetti mess from there making the
template more pain than pleasure.
