Try this:
  * create a new app
  * start an emulator
  * flutter run your new app
  * yay, it works!
  * then, replace your lib/main.dart with the following contents:
    import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
    void main() {
      runApp(new MyWidget());
    }
    class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
      @override
      Widget build(BuildContext context) {
        return new GestureDetector(
          onTap: () => print('tapped!')
        );
      }
    }
And then:
  * type `r` in your flutter run console
Expected: hot reloads and everything is awesome
Actual:
This error:
    Initializing hot reload...
    I/flutter ( 3394): ══╡ EXCEPTION CAUGHT BY WIDGETS LIBRARY ╞═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    I/flutter ( 3394): The following _CompileTimeError was thrown building MyApp(dirty):

This is a pretty poor user experience:
  * There is no more MyHomePage class in my source code, why is Flutter telling me there's an error here?
  * There is no suggestion or hint that I need to Hot Restart
Luckily, I then remembered that:
  * I can Hot Restart
  * There is some issue about changing types of widgets and not working well with Hot Reload
(Neither of which a new user would understand :/)
Suggestions:
  * Tolerate changing widget types (from stateless to stateful) during Hot Reloads
  * Detect when a Hot Reload isn't possible, error out earlier than showing me code that no longer exists
  * Suggest to the user something like "Bummer, that didn't seem to work. Please try Hot Restart with capital R."
Thanks!
