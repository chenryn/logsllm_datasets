User: Is there a quick way (i.e. that minimizes time-to-answer) to find out if a file is open on Linux?   
Let's say I have a process that writes a ton a files in a directory and another process which reads those files once they are finished writing, can the latter process know if a file is still being written to by the former process?
A Python based solution would be ideal, if possible.
Note: I understand I could be using a FIFO / Queue based solution but I am looking for something else.
Assistant: If you can change the 'first' process logic, the easy solution would be to write data to a temp file and rename the file once all the data is written.
