the categories represented by the tagged domains—online
pharmacies, replica shops, and counterfeit software stores—is
a small fraction of all spam. This is not so, however. As we
will see in Section 4.3, these domains dominate the feeds in
volume.
Figure 1 and Table 3 put the Bot feed in perspective.
Although extremely valuable in identifying which domains
are being spammed by which botnet, its contribution to the
big picture is more limited. None of its tagged domains were
exclusive, not a surprising fact given that bots are renowned
for indiscriminate high-volume spamming. The roughly 3,700
exclusive live domains in the Bot feed are likely the result
of the domain poisoning described earlier (Section 4.1), as
fewer than 1% of all domains were legitimate (Table 2).
In the preceding discussion of
Pairwise comparison.
exclusive contribution, we were implicitly asking which feed,
if it were excluded, would be missed the most. Next we
consider the question of each feed’s diﬀerential contribution
with respect to another feed. Equivalently, we are asking how
many domains from one feed are also in another. (Removing
non-responsive and benign domains is particularly important
for a meaningful comparison here.)
Figure 2 shows pairwise domain overlap as a matrix, with
live domains plotted on the left and tagged domains on the
right. For two feeds A and B, the cell in row A column B
shows how many domains (percent) from feed B are in feed
A, as well as the absolute number of such domains. Formally,
the top and bottom numbers show
|A ∩ B|/|B| and |A ∩ B|.
For example, in the left-hand matrix, the cell in row Ac1
column mx1 indicates that Ac1 and mx1 have approximately
47,000 live domains in common, and that this number is 65%
of the mx1 feed. Note that these same 47,000 live domains
constitute 81% of the Ac1 feed (row mx1 column Ac1). In
addition, the right-most column, labeled All contains the
union of all domains across all feeds. The numbers in the All
column thus indicate what proportion of all spam domains
(the union of all feeds) is covered by a given feed.
Figure 2 once again highlights the coverage of the Hu and
Hyb feeds. The Hyb feed covers 51% of all live domains (the
union of all non-blacklist feeds), while the Hu feed covers 58%;
the two feeds together covering 98% (not shown in matrix)
of all live domains. When restricted to tagged domains only
(Figure 2 right), the coverage of the Hu feed is an astounding
96%, while the contribution of Hyb drops to 39%. In fact,
restricting the domains to tagged only (right-hand matrix)
excludes many of the benign domains appearing in Hyb from
the All column, improving the coverage of most feeds with
respect to All.
Figure 2 also reveals that most feeds—especially Ac1, mx1,
mx2, and mx3—are quite eﬀective at capturing bot-generated
spam domains. These feeds range from 12% to 21% bot-
generated (tagged domains), although the true number is

these honeypot feeds (mx1, mx2, mx3, Ac1, and Ac2), and
both blacklists considerably overlap each other. Moreover,
blacklists have a non-trivial overlap with the Hu feed. Despite
these higher numbers, though, a gap still exists, as blacklists
cannot replace the human identiﬁed dataset. Overall, this is
a strong indicator of the strength of human-identiﬁed feeds,
while also stressing the signiﬁcance of blacklists.
4.2.2 Volume
While there are millions of URLs and thousands of do-
mains spammed daily, the number of messages in which each
appears can vary dramatically. We call the number of mes-
sages advertising a domain the volume of that domain. Here
we consider the coverage of each feed with respect to the
relative volume of spam it covers. To estimate this quantity,
we solicited the help of a large Web mail provider to measure
the volume of spam domains at their incoming mail servers.
The incoming mail oracle. We refer to this data source
as our incoming mail oracle. For this measurement, we
collected all live domains seen across all feeds, and submitted
them to the cooperating mail provider. The provider reported
back to us the number of messages (normalized) containing
each spam domain, as seen by their incoming mail servers
over ﬁve days during the measurement period. This provider
handles mail for hundreds of millions of users. Although the
measurement collected is not a perfectly uniform sample of all
spam globally, we believe it to be a reasonable representative.
Given the limited duration of the measurement—ﬁve days
versus three months of feed data—these results should be
interpreted with caution.
Figure 3 shows the volume of spam covered by the live
and tagged domains in each feed. Recall that both live and
tagged domains speciﬁcally exclude domains listed in the
Alexa 1 million and domains appearing in the Open Directory
Project listings (Section 4.1.4). In the ﬁgure, we’ve included
the volume due to these Alexa and ODP domains occurring
in each feed, shown stacked on top of the live and tagged
volume bars. Before removing Alexa and ODP domains, the
volume of live domains is dominated by these potential false
positives. Among tagged domains, the volume attributed to
Alexa and ODP domains (before exclusion) is much lower.
These are domains which may have been used by the spammer
as a redirection mechanism, either by abusing a legitimate
service or via compromise. Of the feeds, the blacklists show
the highest purity, as noted in Section 4.1.
With the Alexa and ODP domains excluded from the set
of tagged domains, the uribl blacklist provides the greatest
coverage, followed by the Hu feed and dbl blacklist. At the
opposite end, the Hyb feed provides only about a sixth of
the coverage (by tagged domain volume) compared to uribl,
dbl, and Hu. Although it has nearly an order of magnitude
more domains, its spam volume coverage is less than the Bot
feed. One possibility is that this feed contains spam domains
not derived from e-mail spam.

cell expresses this intersection relative to the second program
(identiﬁed by the column). For example, the cell in row
mx1 column Hyb indicates that 37 aﬃliate programs are
seen in both feeds, and that these 37 programs represent
approximately 90% of the 41 programs appearing in the Hyb
feed.
Generally, most feeds do a good job covering all programs.
The mx3 feed has the second worst coverage, covering only
62% of all programs. Not surprisingly, the Bot feed has the
worst coverage: only 15 programs. This poor coverage is
partly because botnet operators frequently act as aﬃliates
themselves and thus only advertise for a modest number
of programs where they have spent the time to establish
themselves. Even a botnet for rent will have a modest number
of users and thus any given botnet will typically spam for a
small number of programs in a given time.
4.2.4 RX-Promotion
In the aﬃliate marketing model for spam-advertised goods,
the store site is usually hosted by the aﬃliate program itself,
and not the spammer. For the aﬃliate program to determine
which aﬃliate should receive credit for a sale, the URL
itself must uniquely identify the aﬃliate. The most common
mechanism is to assign each (major) aﬃliate a handful of
dedicated domains.6 Any sales generated via those domains
are automatically credited to the appropriate aﬃliate.
One program, RX-Promotion, embeds an aﬃliate identiﬁer
in the page source of the storefront itself. This embedding
allowed us to extract aﬃliate identiﬁers and map them to
domains.
In total, we were able to identify 846 distinct
aﬃliate identiﬁers.
Aﬃliate coverage.
Figure 5 shows the pairwise feed com-
parison matrix for RX-Promotion aﬃliate identiﬁer coverage.
Similar to aﬃliate program coverage, the human-identiﬁed
feed Hu contributes the largest number of distinct aﬃliates.
In this case, however, the diﬀerence between Hu and other
feeds is more pronounced, with more than 40% of the aﬃli-
ates found exclusively in Hu. The remaining feeds follow the
same pattern as before. The MX honeypots (especially mx1
and mx2) continue to oﬀer slightly greater coverage than
seeded honey accounts (Ac1 and Ac2). Most striking is the
paucity of aﬃliate IDs in the botnet feeds, conﬁrming our ear-
lier suspicion that botnet-originated aﬃliate program spam
is associated with a single individual (the botnet operator).
Revenue coverage.
The ultimate measure of an aﬃli-
ate’s success is the revenue he generates for the program. By
this measure, a feed’s value lies not in how many aﬃliates it
covers, but in how much revenue it covers.
In a recent dispute between rival pharmacy aﬃliate pro-
grams, a number of RX-Promotion documents were leaked
to the public [23]. One such document available to us, lists
annual revenue generated by each RX-Promotion aﬃliate in
2010. Using these revenue statistics, we calculate aﬃliate
coverage weighted by aﬃliate revenue. Figure 6 shows the
revenue-weighted aﬃliate coverage of each feed.
The domains advertised in the smaller campaigns only
found in Hu and dbl generate an order of magnitude more
revenue than the sites advertised by bots and typically ﬁve
times more than those sites seen in MX and honey account
feeds. Overall, the results generally follow the aﬃliate cover-
6New domains must be constantly registered and assigned, as
domains quickly become ineﬀective because of blacklisting.

Up to this point, our focus has been the domains occur-
ring in feeds, with the implicit understanding that domains
represent a spam campaign. The relationship between a
