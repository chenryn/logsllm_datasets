| dbl | 144,721 | 100,631 |
| uribl | 2,127,164 | 67,856 |
| mx1 | 79,040 | 35,506 |
| mx2 | 13,588,727 | 1,315,292 |
| mx3 | 534,060 | 0 |

**Figure 1: Relationship between the total number of domains contributed by each feed and the number of domains exclusive to each.**

The categories represented by the tagged domains—online pharmacies, replica shops, and counterfeit software stores—constitute a small fraction of all spam. However, as we will see in Section 4.3, these domains dominate the feeds in volume.

### Analysis of the Bot Feed
Although the Bot feed is extremely valuable for identifying which domains are being spammed by specific botnets, its contribution to the overall picture is more limited. None of its tagged domains were exclusive, which is not surprising given that bots are known for indiscriminate high-volume spamming. The roughly 3,700 exclusive live domains in the Bot feed are likely the result of domain poisoning, as fewer than 1% of all domains were legitimate (Table 2).

### Pairwise Comparison
In the preceding discussion on exclusive contributions, we implicitly asked which feed, if excluded, would be missed the most. Next, we consider the differential contribution of each feed with respect to another. This involves asking how many domains from one feed are also present in another. Removing non-responsive and benign domains is crucial for a meaningful comparison.

**Figure 2: Pairwise Feed Domain Intersection**
- **Left Matrix:** Live Domains
- **Right Matrix:** Tagged Domains

For two feeds A and B, the cell in row A and column B shows:
- The percentage of domains from feed B that are in feed A: \( \frac{|A \cap B|}{|B|} \)
- The absolute number of such domains: \( |A \cap B| \)

For example, in the left-hand matrix, the cell in row Ac1 and column mx1 indicates that Ac1 and mx1 share approximately 47,000 live domains, which is 65% of the mx1 feed. These same 47,000 live domains constitute 81% of the Ac1 feed. The right-most column, labeled "All," contains the union of all domains across all feeds, indicating the proportion of all spam domains covered by a given feed.

### Coverage of Feeds
- **Hu and Hyb Feeds:**
  - Hyb covers 51% of all live domains.
  - Hu covers 58%.
  - Together, they cover 98% of all live domains.
  - When restricted to tagged domains, Hu covers 96%, while Hyb's coverage drops to 39%.

- **Other Feeds:**
  - Ac1, mx1, mx2, and mx3 are effective at capturing bot-generated spam domains, ranging from 12% to 21% bot-generated (tagged domains).
  - uribl is effective at capturing honeypot feeds (mx1, mx2, mx3, Ac1, and Ac2), and blacklists overlap significantly with each other and the Hu feed.

### Volume Coverage
**Figure 3: Feed Volume Coverage**
- **Left Matrix:** Live Domains
- **Right Matrix:** Tagged Domains

We estimated the volume of spam domains using data from a large web mail provider. The provider reported the number of messages containing each spam domain over five days. Although this is not a perfectly uniform sample, it is a reasonable representation.

- **Alexa and ODP Domains:**
  - Before exclusion, the volume of live domains was dominated by potential false positives.
  - Among tagged domains, the volume attributed to Alexa and ODP domains was much lower.

- **Coverage:**
  - With Alexa and ODP domains excluded, the uribl blacklist provides the greatest coverage, followed by the Hu feed and dbl blacklist.
  - The Hyb feed provides only about a sixth of the coverage compared to uribl, dbl, and Hu.

### Affiliate Programs
**Figure 4: Pairwise Feed Similarity with Respect to Covered Affiliate Programs**

- **General Coverage:**
  - Most feeds do a good job covering all programs.
  - The mx3 feed has the second-worst coverage, covering only 62% of all programs.
  - The Bot feed has the worst coverage, with only 15 programs. This is partly because botnet operators frequently act as affiliates themselves and only advertise for a modest number of programs.

### RX-Promotion
**Figure 5: Pairwise Feed Similarity with Respect to Covered RX-Promotion Affiliate Identifiers**

- **Affiliate Coverage:**
  - The human-identified feed Hu contributes the largest number of distinct affiliates, with more than 40% found exclusively in Hu.
  - MX honeypots (especially mx1 and mx2) offer slightly greater coverage than seeded honey accounts (Ac1 and Ac2).
  - Botnet feeds have very few affiliate IDs, confirming that botnet-originated affiliate program spam is associated with a single individual (the botnet operator).

### Revenue Coverage
**Figure 6: Revenue-Weighted Affiliate Coverage of Each Feed**

- **Revenue Generation:**
  - Domains advertised in smaller campaigns only found in Hu and dbl generate an order of magnitude more revenue than those seen in bot and MX/honey account feeds.
  - Overall, the results generally follow the affiliate coverage, with Hu and dbl contributing the most significant revenue.

### Conclusion
The analysis highlights the strengths and limitations of different feeds in covering spam domains and affiliate programs. Human-identified feeds like Hu and blacklists like uribl and dbl provide substantial coverage and are essential for comprehensive spam mitigation.
