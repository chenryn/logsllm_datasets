I have written code to enable initialization of a bean using initialization
parameters from a database table. I would be happy to submit the code to the
Spring project.
In summary, a FactoryBean is specified in an ApplicationContext xml file
creates the bean. The bean's properties values are read from a database table.
Properties can be reinitialized at any time, using the current values in the
database table.
The preliminary code can be downloaded from:

I have posted information on how to use it is available on the Spring forum
