User: How to Locate Network Faults During Network O&M? Please list some methods of network troubleshooting.
Assistant: Methods for locating network faults: 1. Infrastructure inspection: Check the working status of various infrastructures in the network, such as routers, switches, network cards, network cables, etc., to ensure that the connections are correct. 2. Network topology check: Check the network topology, such as whether the VLAN division is correct, whether the route isolation is done well, and so on. 3. Troubleshooting for a single IP address: Use the ping command to check whether the target IP address exists, and then use the traceroute command to troubleshoot the location. 4. Network traffic inspection: Use network monitoring tools, such as Wireshark, tcpdump, etc., to check whether the network traffic is normal and whether there is any abnormal traffic. 5. Hidden troubleshooting: Most network failures occur from time to time. At this time, it is necessary to track some logs, error messages, and conduct more in-depth investigations. 6. Step by step troubleshooting: If none of the above methods can solve the problem, you can try to further investigate the root cause of the problem and find a solution through protocol analysis, traffic analysis, and network topology analysis. 7. Information exchange: When dealing with complex network faults, communicate with other operation and maintenance engineers, discuss and share ideas with each other, so that you can locate and solve problems more quickly and accurately.
