I have developed a straightforward preset for Node 5.0, which I am currently employing in a production environment. I plan to keep it closely aligned with Babel 6 releases. So far, the preset has been performing well, shaving off a few milliseconds from response times and, in some cases, reducing Gulp build times by several seconds. This is achieved by avoiding unnecessary transpilation and leveraging Node 5's native features.

You can find the package here: [babel-preset-node5](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-preset-node5)

Could you please review the "key features" section? I've based my work on this compatibility table. Have I overlooked any important aspects?
