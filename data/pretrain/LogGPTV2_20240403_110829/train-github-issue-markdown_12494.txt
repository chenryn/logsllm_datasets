**Environment** :
  * **Cloud provider or hardware configuration** : Google Cloud
  * **OS** (e.g. from /etc/os-release): GCE Container VM
  * **Kernel** (e.g. `uname -a`): N/A
  * **Install tools** : N/A
  * **Others** : N/A
**What happened** :  
We use `kubectl replace -f deployment.json` to update deployment resources in
our cluster. We do this because we generate `deployment.json`, and pass it to
either `create` or `replace` depending on whether or not the resource already
exists
**What you expected to happen** :  
We expected that `replace` will trigger the rollout logic, however `kubectl
rollout status deployment ...` always seems to return immediately available,
even when `kubectl get pods` shows pods creating / being terminated (in
violation of the rolling update strategy as well).
**How to reproduce it** (as minimally and precisely as possible):  
`kubectl replace -f deployment.json` where `deployment.json` describes a
deployment resource. You can try changing the image version in a container in
`deployment.json` and running the `replace` command.
**Anything else do we need to know** :  
N/A
