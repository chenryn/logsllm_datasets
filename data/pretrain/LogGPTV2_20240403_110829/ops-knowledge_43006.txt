User: I'm looking for a way to let multiple Python programs coexist on the same Windows machine.
Here's the problem: suppose program A needs Python 2.5, B needs 2.6, C needs 3, and each of them needs its own version of Qt, Wx or whatever other modules or whatever.
Trying to install all these dependencies on the same machine will break things, e.g. you can install different versions of Python side-by-side but only one of them can have the .py file association, so if you give that to Python 2.5 then B and C won't work, etc.
The ideal state of affairs would be if program A could live in C:\A along with its own Python interpreter, Qt/Wx/MySQL driver/whatever and never touch anything outside that directory, ditto for B and C.
Is there any way to accomplish this, other than going the full virtual box route?
edit: I tried the batch file solution, but it doesn't work. That is, it works on simple test scripts but e.g. OpenRPG fails at some point in its loading process if its required version of Python doesn't own the file association.
Assistant: One solution would be to craft a batch file that invokes the correct interpreter for a given application.  THis way, you can install additional interpreters in separate folders.
Probably not perfect but it works.
