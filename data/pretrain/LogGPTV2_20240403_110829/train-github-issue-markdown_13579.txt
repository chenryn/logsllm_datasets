I am using sklearn for my project i have trained model on 64 bit linux
machine,now i want to load that model (.pickle format) on raspberry pi which
is 32 bit os and hw configuration,i have following issue while unpickling
model file.  
Please help me if any solution on this.
knn_clf =joblib.load(f)

packages/sklearn/externals/joblib/numpy_pickle.py", line 568, in load
