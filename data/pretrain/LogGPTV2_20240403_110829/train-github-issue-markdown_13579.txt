I am using `scikit-learn` for my project and have trained a model on a 64-bit Linux machine. Now, I want to load this model (in `.pickle` format) on a Raspberry Pi, which has a 32-bit operating system and hardware configuration. However, I encounter the following error when trying to unpickle the model file:

```python
knn_clf = joblib.load(f)
```

Error Traceback:
```python

    obj = _unpickle(fobj)

```

Could you please provide a solution or suggest a workaround for this issue?
