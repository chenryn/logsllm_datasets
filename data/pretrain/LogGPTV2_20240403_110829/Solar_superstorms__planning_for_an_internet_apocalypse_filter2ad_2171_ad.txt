(a) Reach of ASes
(b) Spread of ASes
Figure 9: (a) An AS has a reach above a particular latitude
if it has at least one router with latitude coordinates above
the threshold. ASes above 40> are more vulnerable. (b) The
spread of an AS, measured using the location coordinates of
routers in the AS, is the dierence between the highest and
the lowest latitudes of its component routers. Note that 1>
latitude spread approximately equals to 111 km.
South Africa: Even under the high-failure scenario ((1), although
it loses some capacity, South Africa continues to retain its connec-
tivity to both the Eastern and the Western Coast of Africa. The
cable interconnecting South Africa and Portugal (and other inter-
mediate locations including Nigeria), as well as South Africa and
Somalia (and other intermediate locations including Mozambique
and Madagascar), are unaected.
Australia and New Zealand: With high failures ((1), New Zealand
loses all its long-distance connectivity except to Australia. Similarly,
while Australia retains most of its connectivity to nearby islands
in addition to domestic connections, the longest unaected cable
interconnects it with Jakarta (Indonesia) and Singapore.
Brazil: Interestingly, even under high failures ((1), Brazil will re-
tain its connectivity to Europe in addition to other parts of South
America such as Argentina. However, it will lose its connectivity
to North America. It is interesting to note that the US loses its

Implications for Autonomous System Connectivity.
Ideally, we want to understand the ASes that will be aected when
submarine cables fail. However, this will require AS to cable map-
ping, which is currently unavailable. Fortunately, CAIDA provides
a dataset with Internet router locations and router to AS mappings.
This dataset contains router to AS mapping for 46, 014, 869 routers
across 61, 448 ASes. We use this dataset to understand the impact
on ASes. Note that there exist several known errors in the loca-
tion mapping employed by the CAIDA dataset [34]. Hence, the
evaluations in this paper are aected by these errors as well.
First, the impact on an AS depends on its presence in the vulner-
able latitude region (above 40>). Hence, we measure the percentage
of ASes that have at least one router instance in this region. In
Figure 9(a), we observe that 57% of ASes have a presence in the
vulnerable regions.
Second, an AS has a higher probability of being aected if it has
a large spread. We measure the spread of an AS using the location
coordinates of its routers. The evaluation is restricted to latitude
spread since the estimation of longitude boundaries is more dicult
and error-prone with the given dataset. An AS’ latitude spread is
measured as the dierence between the highest and the lowest
latitudes of its component routers. In Figure 9(b), we observe that
50% of ASes have a latitude spread less than 1.723> and 90% of ASes
have a latitude spread less than 18.263> (1> latitude spread ⇡ 111
km). This shows that a vast majority of ASes are geographically
localized and do not have a large spread.
A geographically restricted AS is less likely to be directly im-
pacted by solar superstorms. A large spread for an AS may not
always mean that it has long links. However, with a large spread, it
is likely that an AS will be directly impacted or indirectly impacted
within one hop by a severe event.
Overall, a large number of ASes with low spread may help in
limiting the impact. However, a signicant fraction of ASes have
some presence in the more vulnerable regions.

Implications for Hyperscale data centers. Based on
the characteristics of solar superstorms-based failures at the level
of nodes, cities, and countries in the previous section, next we dis-
cuss the implications for large-scale data centers that serve a large
fraction of Internet services and content today. In particular, we

consider public information on data center locations of Google [6]
and Facebook [38].
While the majority of Google data centers [6] are located in the
US, they are spread across latitudes and longitudes. In the event of
high failures, data centers in South Carolina and Georgia as well as
Las Vegas are more likely to be located close to active long-distance
cables. In Asia, one of Google’s data centers is located in Singapore,
a location less likely to lose connectivity during solar superstorms.
European Google data centers are located in countries with short
interconnecting submarine cables to the rest of Europe. While this
area is highly susceptible to power failures, Internet failures due
to repeater damage are less probable due to the shorter length of
cables in this region.
Facebook’s data centers [38] are predominantly located in the
northern parts of the Northern hemisphere. Facebook does not
operate any hyperscale data centers in Africa or South America,
unlike Google. Owing to the limited geographic spread of data
centers, Facebook will have less resilience in the event of solar
superstorms.
4.4.3
Implications for DNS servers. DNS root servers are
highly geographically distributed. Although the distribution is not
proportional to Internet users (Africa with more Internet users than
North America has nearly half the number of DNS servers), DNS
root servers are widely present on all continents. Hence, DNS root
servers are resilient in the face of solar superstorms.
While location information of all DNS root servers is publicly
available (including all anycast server locations), data on more than
1500 Top-Level Domain servers and other DNS root zone servers are
limited. While the IP address of these servers can be obtained from
DNS records, it is dicult to identify their locations, particularly
because they typically employ anycast.
4.4.4 Summary.
• The distribution of Internet infrastructure is skewed when com-
pared to the distribution of Internet users. The infrastructure
concentration in higher latitudes poses a greater risk during
solar storms.
• The investigation on the impact of GIC shows that submarine
cables have a higher risk of failure compared to land cables. This
is primarily due to their large lengths.
• The US is one of the most vulnerable locations with a high risk
of disconnection from Europe during extreme solar events. Intra-
continental connections in Europe are at a lower risk due to the
presence of a large number of shorter land and submarine cables
interconnecting the continent.
• In Asia, Singapore will retain good connectivity to neighboring
countries even under severe storms. Chinese cities are more prone
to lose connectivity than Indian cities because they connect to
much longer cables. The cables running along the eastern and
western coasts of Africa are less prone to failures.
• The cable between Brazil and Europe has less probability of being
aected compared to cables connecting the US and Europe.
• Australia, New Zealand, and other island countries in the region
will lose most of their long-distance connections. But local con-
nectivity, as well as connections to Singapore, are less vulnerable.
• A large fraction of ASes have a presence in vulnerable regions,
however, the vast majority have a small spread. The extent of
impact on an AS and its customers will depend on a combination
of these factors.
• Google data centers have a better spread, particularly in Asia and
South America. Facebook is more vulnerable.
• DNS root servers are highly distributed and hence not vulnerable.
5 PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE
Although we have sentinel spacecraft that can issue early warn-
ings of CMEs providing at least 13 hours of lead time, our defenses
against GIC are limited. Hence, we need to prepare the infras-
tructure for an eventual catastrophe to facilitate ecient disaster
management. Towards this goal, we outline several directions.
5.1 Internet Infrastructure Design
As shown in our analysis, the current Internet infrastructure is
heavily concentrated in higher latitudes that are at a greater risk
for GIC. We need to factor in this threat during infrastructure
expansion.
With the increased melting of Arctic ice, there are ongoing eorts
to lay cables through the Arctic [11, 12]. While this is helpful for
improving latency, these cables are prone to higher risk. During
topology design, we need to increase capacity in lower latitudes
for improved resiliency during solar storms (although latency is
higher). Moreover, since links from the US and Canada to Europe
and Asia are highly vulnerable, adding more links to Central and
South America can help in maintaining global connectivity. South
America is more likely to maintain connectivity to Europe and
Africa.
At submarine cable landing points, particularly in the low lati-
tudes, it is important to have mechanisms for electrically isolating
cables connecting to higher latitudes from the rest, to prevent cas-
cading failures.
A higher density of data centers and IXPs in northern parts of
Europe and America also poses a threat to Internet services. Data
center and application service providers should be cognizant of
solar threats during new deployments. We need to develop stan-
dardized tests for measuring end-to-end resiliency of applications
under such extreme events. Specically, systematic modeling of
potential disruptions to the Internet, from the physical layer to
various applications, through collaborations between astrophysi-
cists, electrical engineers, and networking researchers is critical for
improving Internet resiliency.
This paper focused on terrestrial infrastructure only. With in-
creasing deployments of low earth orbit satellites [14], it is also
important to study the impact of solar superstorms on satellite
Internet constellations that are directly exposed to powerful CMEs.
5.2 How to Use the Lead Time?
A CME that originates in the sun reaches the earth at least 13 hours,
typically 1-3 days, later. This provides the infrastructure operators
an opportunity to devise a shutdown strategy that minimizes con-
nectivity loss during and after impact. In power grids, since GIC
is superimposed with generated current, a key strategy involves
reducing or completely shutting down power generation.
701
Solar Superstorms: Planning for an Internet Apocalypse
SIGCOMM ’21, August 23–27, 2021, Virtual Event, USA
In the Internet infrastructure, the shutdown strategy needs to
focus on two aspects: (i) protecting the equipment during a solar
event, and (ii) ensuring the continuation of services after the event
anticipating partial damage to infrastructure (damaged submarine
cables, satellites, etc.). Similar to power grids, powering o is the eas-
iest solution for equipment damage prevention. However, note that
this only provides limited protection since GIC can ow through
a powered-o cable. Since the peak current is reduced slightly by
powering o, this can help only when the threat is moderate.
Planning for post-impact connectivity is a much harder prob-
lem, especially with limited modeling available for the extent of
cable damage. Search engines, nancial services, etc. should geo-
distribute critical data and functionalities so that each partition
(potentially disconnected landmasses such as N. America, Eurasia,
Australia, etc.) can function independently. Also, service and con-
tent providers should pre-provision high priority service for critical
applications such as 911, hospitals, re departments, etc.
5.3 Piecing Together a Partitioned Internet
We need to rethink the network environment in the event of a
partial or complete disconnection [57]. This includes designing ad-
hoc network connectivity mechanisms (e.g., Project Loon [36]) and
peer-to-peer applications that can bootstrap connectivity locally.
User-powered mesh networks [7] that proved valuable during other
natural disasters such as earthquakes can also help during solar
superstorms. However, unlike other localized disasters, wide-area
connectivity disruption is a unique challenge associated with solar
storms. To tackle this problem, we need to examine alternatives
such as backup interdomain protocols that allow multiple paths
and more resilient Internet architectures (e.g., SCION [18]). More
broadly, designing and installing in advance a seamless protocol that
can piece together all available modes of communication, includ-
ing cables, satellites, and wireless, across multiple administrative
domains is critical for fast recovery.
5.4 Devising New Resilience Tests for Internet
Systems
Current best practices on fault tolerance and resilience evaluation
in software systems revolve around failure models that consider a
limited number of failures within and across locations. Large-scale
infrastructure failures spanning broad swaths of the Internet are
absent in the literature. This was primarily due to the fortuitous
absence of such a catastrophic event in the past two decades when
the Internet infrastructure grew rapidly. Hence, our understanding
of the impact of a solar superstorm on Internet sub-systems (e.g.,
Autonomous Systems) and Internet-based systems (e.g., cloud ser-
vices, Voice over IP) is very limited. We need to devise standard
practices in resilience testing involving large-scale failures.
74]. Today, there is a tight interdependence between power grids
and networks. Smart grids rely on either their own private WAN
networks or the public Internet for their functioning. As a result,
failures of power grids and the Internet and other communication
networks are more tightly coupled.
Although power grids and the Internet have varying levels of
impact on society, there are several dierentiating features in the
nature of failures and hence, the recovery mechanisms required.
First, power grids and the Internet dier in their structure and
organization. For example, in the US, there are three regional power
grids. If the power grid in New York fails, it will not cause any
signicant eects in California. The Northeast will be without
power, but it is not possible to transfer electricity from California
to New York and cause any power overload in California. On the
other hand, when all submarine cables connecting to NY fail, there
will be signicant shifts in BGP paths and potential overload in
Internet cables in California. In short, the Internet is more global
compared to power grids, and even regional failures can result in
signicant consequences for the broader Internet.
Second, the length of power cables will closely follow the ITU
land dataset. Both power lines and Internet cables on land are typi-
cally in close proximity to road and rail networks. Hence, longer
submarine cables may be susceptible to higher risks. The key road-
block associated with replacing transformers in power grids is the
