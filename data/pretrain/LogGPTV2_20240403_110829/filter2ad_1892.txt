## Abstract
Previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of deriving simple indicators for file transfers, human interactivity, and other important behavioral characteristics. We propose a practical implementation and use of such indicators with NetMate. Our extended version of NetMate, currently in development, is already of interest to network security practitioners conducting incident analysis. The tool can post-process traffic traces containing suspicious flows to provide a behavioral description of the incident and surrounding traffic activities. With further development, this approach has significant potential for other use cases, including intrusion detection, insider threat detection, and traffic classification.

## Introduction
Most current network monitoring tools rely on well-known port numbers and/or payload analysis to identify network applications. While payload analysis is more reliable than port numbers, it is not always possible due to encryption or obfuscation. Previous research has shown that classifying network traffic based on flow behavior is feasible and promising. However, we are not aware of any practical traffic characterization solutions of this type being used by network security professionals.

Our proposed implementation is designed with practitioners in mind. Installation and use are straightforward, similar to common packet processing tools like tcpdump and snort. The output is intuitive and can provide valuable insights into traffic activities under investigation.

## Methodology
This implementation is based on previous work [4], where flow features (metrics) have discriminative power and provide insight into traffic behavior. The set of flow features, inspired by Paxson's work [5], includes indicators of interactivity (human control), conversation, transaction, data transfer, and other important behavioral characteristics. The analysis is confined to headers at the network and transport layers, making it independent of payload access.

We are extending NetMate [6], an existing open-source packet processing framework. NetMate includes two types of modules: Packet Processing Modules, which implement different metrics, and Export Modules, which handle different output formats. Our flow features are implemented in Packet Processing Modules, and our rule engine, which describes and recognizes the flows, is implemented as an Export Module.

## Implementation
Our Export Module compares the measured flow metrics against a configurable set of rules stored in files. When NetMate is configured to use our new modules and rules, the output file consists of one line per flow (i.e., per TCP/UDP 5-tuple session). Here is a sample output:

```
yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss, 4, 6, xx.xx.xx.xx, yy.yy.yy.yy, 35573, 22, directional-bkwd, persistent, human-keystroke-fwd, no-bulk-transfer, free-transmitrate, blockcipher-encrypted, , , , , , ssh, , , , , , , , ,
```

Two types of rules are used to produce the output: description rules and recognition rules. In the example above, the description rules produce the portion of the output in underlined characters, while the text in italics is due to the recognition rules. In this example, only one protocol profile, ssh, matched. The first part of the output includes the date, time, and the flow key (IP version, protocol ID, IP addresses, and port numbers).

## Current State and Future Work
We need to evaluate performance on streaming traffic and assess the detection rates and false positive rates of the implemented rules. These rules come from [4] and have been implemented following their original specifications, which were derived manually. Future work will consider using machine-learning techniques [1][2][3] to derive recognition and description rules. The currently implemented description rules provide a sensible and insightful overview of traffic activities. We believe that the description capability alone adds significant value. While the implemented recognition rules aim to identify protocols, they can also be defined to recognize general types of traffic of interest to an analyst.

Despite its early development stage, we believe our current version can be useful to security analysts in the context of supporting network incident analysis. We are working on the first release of our extended NetMate, expected to be available by September 2009.
