Tab. 3 displays the 10 largest topics in the data, each with a
manually assigned topic description, the top c-TF-IDF terms, and
the number of ads assigned to the topic.
The largest topic regarded ‚Äúenterprise‚Äù ads, e.g., a Salesforce ad to
‚Äúempower your partners to accelerate channel growth with external
apps.‚Äù The second largest topic included ‚Äútabloid‚Äù ads, e.g., ‚Äúthe
untold truth of Arnold Schwarzenegger,‚Äù as well as many clickbait

Table 2: Summary of the types of ads in our dataset.
The model‚Äôs fourth largest topic, ‚Äúpolitics‚Äù, contained 71,240
ads: a 64.8% overlap with the 55,943 political ads identified by our
classifier and qualitative coding.
These topics give us a sense of the context within which politi-
cal ads were embedded. Like the web ad content studied in prior
work [96, 97], political ads were surrounded by ordinary or legit-
imate ads for products and services, as well as low-quality and
potentially problematic ads.
4.4 Distribution of Political Ads On Sites
Next, we examine how political ads were distributed across sites
by political bias, misinformation label, and popularity.

Table 3: Top Topics in the Overall Ad Dataset.
Political Bias of Site. Overall, we find that political ads appeared
more frequently on sites with stronger partisan bias. Fig. 4 shows
the fraction of ads that were political across websites‚Äô political
biases for mainstream and misinformation sites.
The percentages we calculate are the number of ads normalized
by the total number of ads collected from sites for each level of bias.
The number of ads collected from sites in each bias level varies, but
no group of sites had overwhelmingly more ads. From Left to Right,
the number of ads collected per site in each group were: 1,888, 1,950,
2,618, 2,092, and 2,172, and 1,676 had unknown bias.
Two-sample Pearson Chi-squared tests indicate a significant as-
sociation between the political bias of the site and the percent-
age of ads that were political, for both mainstream news sites
(ùúí2(5, ùëÅ = 1150676) = 25393.62, ùëù < .0001) and misinformation
sites (ùúí2(5, ùëÅ = 206559) = 8041.43, ùëù < .0001). Pairwise com-
parisons using Pearson Chi-squared tests, corrected with Holm‚Äôs
sequential Bonferroni procedure, indicate that all pairs of website
biases were significantly different (ùëù < .0001).
On mainstream news sites, conservative sites had more political
ads than others; 9% and 10.3% of ads on right-leaning and right
sites were political, but only 6.9% and 4.4% of ads on left and left-
leaning sites. On misinformation sites, 26% of ads on left sites were
political, substantially more than right leaning sites. In 4 of the 7
left misinformation sites (AlterNet, Daily Kos, Occupy Democrats,
Raw Story) over 19% of ads were political.
We also find that political advertisers tend to target sites match-
ing their political affiliation: Democratic and liberal groups ran
the majority of their ads on left-of-center sites, and likewise for
Republican and conservative groups on right-of-center sites (Fig. 5).
In particular, ads for Democratic political candidates and progres-
sive nonprofits and causes ran substantially more on 2 of 7 Left
misinformation sites (Daily Kos and Occupy Democrats).

sociation between the political bias of the site and the number of ads

based on the advertiser‚Äôs political affiliation, for both mainstream
news sites (ùúí2(25, ùëÅ = 1, 150, 676) = 22575.49, ùëù < .0001) and
misinformation sites (ùúí2(20, ùëÅ = 206, 559) = 22168.50, ùëù < .0001).
Pairwise comparisons using Pearson Chi-squared tests, corrected
the Holm-Bonferroni method, indicate that all pairs of website bi-
ases were significantly different (ùëù < .0001) except for the (Lean
Left, Uncategorized) Misinformation Sites.
Site Popularity. We found little relationship between site pop-
ularity and the number of political ads on it (Fig. 6). While sites
hosting many political ads tended to be popular politics sites (e.g.,
dailykos.com, mediaite.com), some popular sites (e.g., nytimes.com,
cnn.com) ran <100 political ads. A linear mixed model analysis of
variance indicates no statistically significant effect of site rank on
the number of political ads (ùêπ(1, 744) = 0.805, ùëõ.ùë†.).
At a high level, we find that political ads are seen more on web-
sites that are political and partisan in nature. We hypothesize that
this is either due to contextual targeting (political groups advertis-
ing to co-partisans), and/or because neutral news websites choose
to block political advertising on their sites to appear of impartiality.
4.5 Advertisers of Campaign Ads
Next, we analyze the advertisers who ran campaign and advocacy
ads: their organization type, their affiliations, and how many they
ran. Fig. 7 shows these ads by organization type and affiliation.
Registered Committees. Most campaign ads (12,131, 55.1%) were
purchased by registered committees (FEC or state PACs). These ads
were roughly evenly split between Republican- and Democratic-
affiliated committees, including official candidate committees, like
Biden for President, as well as Hybrid PACs and party-affiliated
Super PACs, such as the Progressive Turnout Project and the Trump
Make America Great Again Committee. These also include candi-
date committees for other state, local, and federal offices.
Nonprofits. We observed campaign ads from nonpartisan non-
profits, e.g., AARP (259 ads, 1.2%), ACLU (256 ads, 1.2%), as well
as explicitly conservative ones, e.g., Judicial Watch (504 ads, 2.3%),
Pro-Life Alliance (471 ads, 2.1%). Few explicitly liberal nonprofits
ran ads under our categorization system. However, some may con-
sider self-described nonpartisan organizations as liberal, e.g., issue
organizations like the ACLU, or voting rights groups like vote.org.
Figure 5: The percentage of ads observed on websites from
advertisers of different political affiliations, by the political
bias and misinformation label of the website. Advertisers
tended to run ads on websites aligned with their politics.
Figure 6: The total number of political ads observed on each
site, by the site‚Äôs Tranco rank. Though the largest outliers in
terms of political ads tend to be popular sites, many popular
sites show few if any political ads.
News Organizations. Some news organizations ran explicitly po-
litical ads to promote candidates or policies ‚Äî these were mostly
conservative-leaning organizations. The top advertisers in this
group are not well-known, e.g., ConservativeBuzz (1,199 ads, 5.4%),
