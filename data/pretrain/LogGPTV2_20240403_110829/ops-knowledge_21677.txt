User: I'm just starting out with Python, and have found out that I can import various libraries. How do I find out what libraries exist on my Mac that I can import? How do I find out what functions they include?
I seem to remember using some web server type thing to browse through local help files, but I may have imagined that!
Assistant: You can install another library: yolk.
yolk is a python package manager and will show you everything you have added via pypi. But it will also show you site-packages added through whatever local package manager you run.
