User: Based on Vagrant and VirtualBox, how to build a virtualized development environment locally for multi-person collaborative development?
Assistant: The following are the steps to build a virtualized development environment locally: 1. Install Vagrant and VirtualBox software 2. Create a Vagrantfile 3. Configure the virtual machine environment, including operating system, CPU and memory, etc. 4. Installation and configuration required 5. Share project code and resources 6. Start a virtual machine When sharing project code and resources, you can use a shared folder to achieve this, so that multiple people can access the same project when collaborating code base and data files. In addition, you can also package the required software packages and library files into a .box file, and then use the same .box file to create the same virtual machine on other people's machines, ensuring that everyone uses the same environment for development and testing . In short, using Vagrant and VirtualBox can easily build a local virtualized development environment, support multi-person collaborative development, and improve efficiency and code quality.
