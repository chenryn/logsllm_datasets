User: How to configure the network in the Docker container? Please list the specific steps and precautions.
Assistant: Docker provides a variety of network modes, such as bridge network, host network, overlay network, etc. Users can choose the appropriate network mode to configure according to their needs. The following are the configuration steps based on the bridge network mode: 1. Create a bridge network ``` docker network create -d bridge mynetwork ``` This will create a bridge network named mynetwork, by default, Docker will create a bridge network for this network Allocate an available IP segment, the gateway address of this network is 172.19.0.1. 2. Create a container and add it to the network ``` docker run -d --name container1 --network mynetwork busybox ``` This will create a container named container1 and add it to the mynetwork network, The container will be assigned an IP address allocated from the IP segment of the network. You can use the docker inspect command to view the IP address of the container. 3. To test the network connection, you can enter the container1 container and use the ping command to test the connection with other containers or external networks, for example: ``` docker exec -it container1 sh ping google.com ``` Notes: 1. Although Docker will automatically assign a default IP segment to the bridge network, but you can also manually specify the IP segment. 2. By default, Docker containers cannot be directly accessed and must be joined to the same network to communicate. 3. If you need to expose the container to the external network, you need to use technologies such as port forwarding to implement it.
