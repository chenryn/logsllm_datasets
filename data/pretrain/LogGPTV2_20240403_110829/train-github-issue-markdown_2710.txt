Hi there,
I am trying to find out if it is possible to add vectors based off of quiver
in matplotlib and animate this via matplotlib animation.  
I was able to use quiver to create static graphs of vector addtion.
I am trying to duplicate the animation style here from this link:  
https://www.physics.mun.ca/~jjerrett/vector/vector.html
But i saw on stackoverflow that at one point it was not possible to position
vectors  
then they said it can, see this link:

matplotlib-quiver-position-coordinates-in-an-animation?rq=1

## So to explain details of my program, it asks user to input 2 vectors.  
Then the 2 vectors, the tails, are placed at the origin.  
Then need to move one of the vector tails to the tip of the other vector in
order to do vector addition.  
And then draw arrow from origin to the final point.
Hope you can let me know.
P.
