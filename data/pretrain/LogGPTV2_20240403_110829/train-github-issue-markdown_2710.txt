Hello,

I am currently exploring the possibility of adding vectors using `quiver` in Matplotlib and animating this process with the `matplotlib.animation` module. I have successfully created static graphs for vector addition using `quiver`, but now I would like to animate the process.

I am aiming to replicate the animation style demonstrated on this webpage:  
[Vector Addition Animation](https://www.physics.mun.ca/~jjerrett/vector/vector.html)

I came across a discussion on Stack Overflow that initially suggested it was not possible to update the position of vectors in an animation, but a later response indicated that it is indeed possible. You can find the relevant discussion here:  
[Updating Quiver Position Coordinates in an Animation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17758942/is-it-possible-to-update-matplotlib-quiver-position-coordinates-in-an-animation?rq=1)

### Details of My Program
My program prompts the user to input two vectors. The tails of these vectors are initially placed at the origin. To perform vector addition, I need to move the tail of one vector to the tip of the other vector. Finally, I want to draw an arrow from the origin to the final point.

Could you please provide guidance on how to achieve this?

Thank you,  
P.
