User: Is it problematic to build python packages (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, h5py,...)  on one linux distro (ubuntu) and run them from another distro (centos)?
I am asking this because our computing cluster has centos machines while my pc is ubuntu.
Assistant: There will not be any problem if you change the way of packaging. Ubuntu needs a different type of packaging while centos needs another type. Build your package and pack it in such a way as normal centos packages and then use it in centos
