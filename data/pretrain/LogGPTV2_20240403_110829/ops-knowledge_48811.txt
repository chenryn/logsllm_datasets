Question: Consider a scenario where an organization is evaluating the implementation of DNSSEC to enhance the security of its DNS infrastructure. Which of the following are potential challenges they might face, and what are the possible consequences or mitigations related to DNSSEC deployment?
"A": "DNSSEC can mitigate problems with key distribution by allowing any entity to sign for any domain, thereby simplifying the process.",
"B": "Adoption of DNSSEC may be slow due to the lack of incentives to upgrade and the non-trivial costs associated with performance and administrative overhead.",
"C": "Name enumeration is a challenge with DNSSEC, but it can be partially mitigated by using NSEC3 which adds hashing to non-existent domain names.",
"D": "DNSSEC resolves all issues related to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks by ensuring that only authenticated responses are accepted."
