Following PR #12001, there are three primary areas that require updates to fully support the experimental API: deep copies and conversions, the client library, and kubectl.

### 1. Deep Copies and Conversions
Currently, types, along with their conversions and deep copies, are being generated in multiple packages. However, types from the experimental API may reference types in the standard API. Since the deep copy and conversion functions are not exported, they must be regenerated in each package, leading to redundant (albeit automatically generated) code. To address this, we can either:
- Modify the autogeneration code to use `Scheme.DeepCopy`/`Scheme.Convert` for types declared in other packages.
- Move the conversion and deep copy functions to a common location. The downside of this approach is the need to import a new package everywhere, as both `pkg/api` and `pkg/expapi` should be initialized before adding these functions. It may be safe to add the functions before the types, but this is not clearly documented.

### 2. Client Library
The `Config` object in the client library needs to be updated to support the experimental API. Specifically, the `Prefix`, `Version`, and `Codec` fields need to be modified to support both experimental and future multiple API groups. These fields also exist within `client.RESTClient`, although only `Codec` is public. Given that these fields are often defaulted in `helper.go`, breaking changes might be acceptable.

To add experimental objects, we could introduce a new `Experimental` field in the `Client` struct, of type `ExperimentalClient` (which embeds a `*RESTClient`). This field would be initialized in the `Client` constructor, so users would interact with it as follows:

```go
c, err := client.New(config)
if err != nil {
    // Handle error
}
list, err := c.Experimental.DaemonController(ns).List(selector)
```

### 3. Kubectl
Several changes are needed in kubectl to support the experimental API:
- **Proxy**: The proxy should handle the experimental prefix if it is enabled.
- **API Versions**: The `api-versions` command should include information about the experimental API.
- **Validation**: Validation (via Swagger) should check the experimental API.
- **Client Library Integration**: Kubectl uses the client library, so support cannot be completed until the client library is updated.

### Next Steps
- Implement the necessary changes to the deep copy and conversion generation.
- Update the client library to support the experimental API.
- Modify kubectl to handle the experimental API.
