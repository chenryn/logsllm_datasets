### Heat Removal Technique

The heat removal technique operates between 200-500 degrees Celsius, allowing for the slicing away of materials. This method is also applicable to metal-impregnated epoxies, although it may require higher temperatures and could potentially damage the underlying components.

#### Prerequisites for Heat Removal
- **Enhanced Ventilation**: Ensure proper ventilation to prevent inhalation of fumes.
- **Hot Air Source**: Use a hot air rework station.
- **Safety Buddy**: Have a partner ready to assist in case of accidents.
- **Xacto Knives**: 
  - A very sharp Xacto knife with a heat-resistant handle and a small blade.
  - A very sharp Xacto knife with a heat-resistant handle and a large blade. Multiple knives are recommended to allow hot ones to cool while continuing work.
- **Magnification Station**: Use a magnification station for precise work.

#### Heat Removal Demo Video
A video demonstration of the heat removal technique is available. However, please note that the venue has restrictions on conducting chemical experiments on their property.

### Handling Encapsulated Devices

If the device is encapsulated in an unusual form factor, such as a card, specific techniques can be employed:

#### Circuit Cards and Laminate Layer Removal
- **Technique by Emerson Tan and Co.**: Methylene Chloride Card Facing Technique.
- **Applicability**: Suitable for plastic-coated cards with flexible circuit material and a laminated plastic layer.
- **Process**: The methylene chloride dissolves the bonds between organic molecules in the plastic, causing the outer layers to slough off, leaving the internal components intact.
- **Time Frame**: Depending on the concentration of methylene chloride and ambient temperature, the process takes 5-30 minutes.

#### Obtaining Methylene Chloride
- **Sources**: Found in trace amounts in household compounds like floor refinishing gel.
- **Distillation**: Not covered due to liability; consult a chemist, not the internet.
- **Online Purchase**: Can be ordered online.
- **Safety Precautions**:
  - Use nitrile gloves up to the elbow.
  - Use a non-reactive metal pan (e.g., stainless steel or aluminum).
  - **WARNING**: Do not attempt this at home. Do not ingest or apply to animals.

### Example: PayPal OTP Card
- **Before**: Encased in a protective case.
- **After**: The outer layers have been removed, revealing the board design, connectors, and battery (silver foil patch).

### Additional Physical Protections
- **Welded Devices**:
  - Acid etching
  - Grinding
  - Precision drilling
  - Laser cutting
- **Security Screws**:
  - Obtain necessary bits from eBay, which are usually inexpensive and useful.
- **Plastic Latches**:
  - Can be difficult to open and may cause self-injury if not careful.
  - High-surface-area interlocks are particularly challenging.
  - Be cautious to avoid damaging the board.

### Electrical Intrusion Sensors
- **Examination**:
  - Carefully inspect the case for sensor wires.
  - Determine if the intrusion sensor is passive or active.
  - Check for magnetic sensors using a Gauss meter or an iPhone's Hall Effect Sensor (compass).
- **Booby Traps**:
  - Be aware of potential booby traps, such as X-ray and light sensors, nitrogen-filled cases, and case contact wires.
  - These are typically military-grade issues, and serious hardware might include explosive devices.

### Other Access Avenues
- **Front Panel Access**:
  - Check if the front panel (e.g., LCD) provides access to an internal bus (I2C or SPI).
  - This could be connected to the same bus as the startup flash.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) Attacks**:
  - Consider the possibility of MiTM attacks when accessing the device.

By following these guidelines and precautions, you can safely and effectively perform physical attacks on various devices.
