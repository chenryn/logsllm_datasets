ABSTRACT
There is a rapidly growing interest in the security of cyber-physical
systems (CPS) and internet-of-things (IoT) in industry, government
and academia. NIST recently created a Cyber-Physical Systems
group and it is leading a public-private initiative to identify a gen-
eral architecture, design principles, solutions, and challenges ahead.
In Europe, the Horizon 2020 research program has targeted secu-
rity issues relating to cyber-physical infrastructures and Internet
of Things, while the fundamental science program CHIST-ERA
launched calls for research projects on resilient trustworthy cyber-
physical systems (2015) and user-centered security and privacy in
the Internet of Things (2016). In the US, grant calls such as the 2019
CPS grant call by NSF (total of 50M USD) show the significance of
CPS&IoT and their security.
In 2019, CCS accepted two workshops: One on CPS security and
privacy (running 5 times in the past) and one on IoT security and
privacy (running 2 times in the past). Since the topics are connected
and there is some significant overlap, the Steering Committees of
the two workshops have decided to merge towards delivering a
world-class event on CPS&IoT security and privacy.
