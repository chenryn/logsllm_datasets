User: How to use SSH to synchronize files from remote server to local?
Assistant: You can use the rsync command to synchronize files from the remote server to the local: 1. First, check whether rsync has been installed locally. If not, you can use the following command to install it: ```bash sudo apt-get install rsync ``` 2. Use the following command Synchronize the files from the remote server to the local: ```bash rsync -avz username@remote:/path/to/files /path/to/local/directory ``` Among them, username is the username of the remote server, and remote is the remote server /path/to/files is the file or directory path to be synchronized, and /path/to/local/directory is the local directory path to be synchronized. 3. When logging in to the remote server through SSH, you need to enter a password. If you want to use SSH key authentication, you can use the following command: ```bash rsync -avz -e "ssh -i /path/to/private/key" username@remote: /path/to/files /path/to/local/directory ``` Among them, /path/to/private/key is the SSH private key file path stored locally. 4. If you want to periodically synchronize files from the remote server to the local, you can use the crontab scheduled task to automatically execute the rsync command: 1. Open the cron table: ```bash crontab -e ``` 2. Add the following content to the last line: ` ``bash 0 0 * * * rsync -avz username@remote:/path/to/files /path/to/local/directory ``` Among them, 0 0 * * * means to execute once every day at 0:00, other time settings can be Refer to the grammar rules of cron. The above is the method of using SSH to synchronize remote server files to the local.
