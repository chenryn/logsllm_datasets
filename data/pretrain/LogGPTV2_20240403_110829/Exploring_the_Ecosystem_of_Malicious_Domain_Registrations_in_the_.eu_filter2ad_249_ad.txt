# Exploring the Ecosystem of Malicious Domain Registrations in the .eu TLD

## 1. Introduction
This study analyzes maliciously-flagged .eu domain registrations over a 14-month period, focusing on identifying operational components, such as campaigns, using registrant details.

## 2. Data and Methodology
### 2.1 Data Collection
- **Data Source:** Publicly available blacklists.
- **Time Frame:** July 2015 to September 2016.
- **Key Features:**
  - Domain length and registrar.
  - Registrant details (name, street, city, region, country, zip code, phone number, email account, and email provider).
  - Nameserver details (nameserver domain names and geographical location).

### 2.2 Campaign Identification
- **Manual Analysis:**
  - Criteria: Recurring registrant and nameserver details.
  - Identified 20 large campaigns.
- **Automatic Clustering:**
  - Algorithm: Agglomerative clustering with complete linkage.
  - Feature Set: 13 features, including one-hot encoding for categorical data.
  - Cutoff Selection: V-measure to determine the optimal number of clusters.

## 3. Results
### 3.1 Manual Campaign Analysis
- **Registrations per Day and Registrar:**
  - Figure 8 shows the daily registration counts for campaign c11.
- **Related Campaigns:**
  - **c02 and c03:** Shared phone number.
  - **c08 and c12:** Shared phone number, email, and address.
  - **c16 and c18:** Shared address.
  - Sudden termination of c01, c02, and c03 suggests a common actor or registrar.

### 3.2 Most Active Malicious Actors
- **Registrar Analysis:**
  - One registrar accounts for 49.6% of all malicious domain names and 2.27% of benign registrations.
  - This confirms earlier findings that a few registrars are responsible for the majority of spammer domains.
- **Email Providers:**
  - Popular public webmail providers (Gmail, Yahoo, AOL) are frequently used.
  - Gmail has a significant share in both malicious and benign registrations, while AOL and Yahoo have a higher fraction of malicious registrations.
- **Registrants:**
  - Three registrants are responsible for over 3,000 malicious registrations.
  - Non-blacklisted registrations from these registrants are likely malicious.

### 3.3 Automatic Campaign Identification
- **Clustering Process:**
  - **Algorithm:** Agglomerative clustering with complete linkage.
  - **Feature Set:** 13 features, expanded to 30,843 after one-hot encoding.
  - **Cutoff Selection:** V-measure at 432 clusters, with homogeneity of 0.90 and completeness of 0.86.
- **Results:**
  - 80% of domains in the 39 largest clusters.
  - Top 30 clusters represent 91.48% of blacklisted registrations within the 20 manually identified campaigns.
  - Clusters align well with manual campaign identification, with some exceptions (e.g., c02 and c03, c16 and c18).

## 4. Discussion and Limitations
### 4.1 Applications
- **Generalizability:** Findings can be applied to other TLDs.
- **Blacklist Extension:** 18.38% of registrations in identified campaigns are not on blacklists, offering opportunities for extension.
- **Proactive Measures:** Post-factum analysis can help stop ongoing campaigns.

### 4.2 Limitations
- **Compromised Benign Domains:** Minimal impact as 98.57% of blacklisted registrations were flagged within 30 days.
- **Pattern Dependency:** Malicious actors can use different registration patterns, but this increases their costs.
- **Anonymization Services:** Some registrars offer anonymization, which can obscure registrant information.
- **Incomplete Blacklists:** The ground truth is incomplete, potentially affecting performance.

## 5. Related Work
- **Hao et al. [11]:** Studied domain registration behavior of spammers, finding that most spam domains are short-lived.
- **Felegyhzi et al. [5]:** Proposed proactive domain blacklisting by inferring other malicious registrations through shared nameservers and identical registration times.
- **Cova et al. [4]:** Identified rogue antivirus campaigns using hosting infrastructure and registration details.
- **DNS Traffic Analysis:** Studies focus on initial DNS patterns of newly registered domains.
- **Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs):** Recent work by Plohmann et al. [17] demonstrates the importance of understanding DGAs for proactive C&C domain identification.

## 6. Conclusion
- **Main Findings:**
  - At least 80.04% of malicious registrations can be attributed to 20 campaigns.
  - Blacklist coverage can be extended by 19.30%.
  - False positives are minimal, at most 0.92%.
- **Implications:**
  - Leveraging registrant details and registration characteristics can identify large campaigns.
  - Automatic identification aids in tracking and interfering with long-running campaigns and extending blacklists preemptively.
