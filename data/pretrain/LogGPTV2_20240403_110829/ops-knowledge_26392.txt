User: I have a python file named abc.py. I can run it in mongodb with the help of robomongo but i couldnt run it in cmd. Can anyone tell me how to run a .py file in mongodb using cmd ?
Assistant: First you need to ensure that your directory is in the correct folder.
for example you can write cd name_of_folder
then to run it you need to typepython your_filen_name.py
