User: There is a server that needs to deploy multiple applications, how to effectively control resource competition among different applications?
Assistant: 1. Use virtualization technology: use containers or virtual machines to isolate each application, ensure that each application has its own independent resources, and avoid resource competition. 2. Allocate resources: For each application, perform reasonable resource allocation according to their workload requirements, such as allocating system resources such as CPU and memory. 3. Use load balancing: Use load balancing technology to distribute traffic to different servers and applications to ensure that each application can run stably. 4. Set priorities: For internal resources and external services, manage resource allocation by setting priorities. For example, prioritizing resource allocation for one high-priority application over other applications. 5. Monitoring and management: Through real-time monitoring and management of application resource usage, problems can be found in time and adjustments and optimizations can be made.
