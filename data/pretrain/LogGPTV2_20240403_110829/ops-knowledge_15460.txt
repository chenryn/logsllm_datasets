User: Let's say I had a cloud cluster with Python or C or something and I want to execute my function (as a client) in the cloud.  How could I possibly pass the function I wrote locally up to the server?
I've seen this elsewhere and I not only don't know how to do it but I want to see if there are many ideas for it.
Thanks,
Anthony Hurst
Assistant: Code mobility is a largely unexplored field with more questions than answers. Generally you cannot move arbitrary code around at runtime. There are a few programming languages that historically supported code mobility (e.g. Kali Scheme), but it is not something that would be ready for main stream use.
Concerning functions, here I am not quite sure what you are asking. There are functional programming languages that support what I would consider "precursors" to code mobility. E.g. in Erlang you can pass function signatures around and in Cloud Haskell you can send a Closure (that is a function with collocated data) within certain limitations.
Other approaches that have reached higher significance are to craft plug-ins, that is precompiled binaries that are loaded at runtime. There might be further possibilities to pass object code around so that not everything has to be compiled and linked at runtime when it is passed from one platform to an other.
Generally what needs to be clear to you is that what you develop is source code. This either needs to be interpreted at runtime (means on both platforms there must be an interpreter loaded) or compiled into binaries and then started. Then there is still the question of data and state etc. that would need to be shared before code mobility will work as we envision it.
