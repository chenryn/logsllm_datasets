Figure 5: Running time with SIMD.
The running time of using SIMD technology to perform classifi-
cation tasks is shown in Figure 5, where we require SecureDL to
classify Breast tissues in the ciphertext. For Figure 5(a), the selected
CNN network consists of two convolutional layers ( containing
20 feature maps and 50 feature maps, respectively), two average
pooling layer and two fully connected layers (256 and 10 neurons,
respectively). We can see that with the increase of batch size, the
running time of SIMD basically keeps a constant. Moreover, Se-
cureDL only takes 0.63 seconds to return results for a single query,
even when the batch size is taken to be 282. For Figure 5(b), we
increase the complexity of the CNN network used for classifica-
tion, i.e., the selected CNN network consists of three convolutional
layers ( containing oner 20 feature maps and two 50 feature maps,
respectively), two average pooling layer and two fully connected
layers (256 and 10 neurons, respectively). SecureDL also only takes
0.88 seconds to return results for a single query, when the batch
size is taken to be 282. By increasing the batch size to 6144, the run-
ning time decreases to 0.04 second per instance. Therefore, SIMD
technology can effectively improve the ability to process ciphertext.

It is worth mentioning that larger batch sizes inevitably increase
the size of the network, even it can speed up inference. Therefore,
there is a trade-off between memory and runtime, and we should
choose the appropriate batch size based on the size of the dataset.

model consists of two convolutional layers ( containing 20 feature
maps and 50 feature maps, respectively), two average pooling layer
and two fully connected layers (256 and 10 neurons, respectively).
Then, we increase the complexity of the benchmark model (by
adding different numbers of convolutional layers containing 50
feature maps) and record the classification time under the changed
model. We can see that as the number of added convolutional
layers rises, it will increase the running time of SecureDL in the
ciphertext, and also require more interaction between the server
and the user to implement the noise reduction. However, SecureDL
also only needs at most 0.61 seconds to process the classification of
an instance, even if the additional 5 convolutional layers are added
to the benchmark model (shown in Table 12).
