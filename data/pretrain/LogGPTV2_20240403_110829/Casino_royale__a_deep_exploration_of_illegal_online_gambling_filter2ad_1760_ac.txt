### Customer Service and Payment Channels

#### Social Network Applications
Gambling websites often provide social network account information for customer service, allowing players to contact them directly. Common accounts include Tencent QQ, WeChat, email addresses, and phone numbers. However, social networks are not widely used due to the risk of revealing private information about the controllers of these illegal sites.

#### Third-Party Customer Service
During our measurement, we extracted customer service URLs from 133,874 suspiciously illegal gambling sites, obtaining 8,387 unique URLs. Each URL represents a unique account registered with the customer service provider. The top 10 URLs are listed in Table 9, indicating that some groups or individuals operate multiple gambling sites.

#### Abuse of Third-Party Payment Channels
Illegal gambling sites frequently use third-party payment channels for their convenience and reliability. We identified over 1,140 such channels in 67,633 gambling websites. These channels are categorized into two types: those providing QR codes for payments and those requiring credit card information. Alipay is the most popular method, appearing in nearly 90% of illegal gambling sites. Operators often change recipient accounts and payment methods to evade law enforcement.

### Summary
Our analysis reveals that a few groups or individuals control a large number of suspiciously illegal gambling sites. These operators use a limited number of HTML templates and domain name patterns to create numerous sites, often hosted on the same IP or AS. They offer various games, use public cloud storage for resources, and employ multiple payment methods, frequently changing recipient accounts to avoid detection. Promotion is also a key strategy to attract potential customers.
