in person. The most common social accounts used in gam-
bling sites include Tencent QQ 5 account, Wechat account,
E-mail address, phone number and etc. Social network is
not widely used here because it can reveal private informa-
tion of these illegal gambling site controllers. (3) Third-party
customer service. During our measurement, we notice that
5Tencent QQ is a Chinese messaging application.
illegal gambling sites use third party online customer ser-
vice like live800.com, providesupport.net. This characteristic
enables us to look into the abused online customer service
providers and cluster the illegal gambling sites according
based on this information.
During this measurement, we first extract customer ser-
vice URL in different illegal gambling sites and obtain 8,387
different customer service URLs from 133,874 suspiciously
illegal gambling sites. It’s worth noting that each URL rep-
resents a unique account registered in the customer service
provider. For example, 0n7w61u9pi8zo0uvfo1jjtmraq contains
the account information of the URL https://messenger.provide
support.net/messenger/0n7w61u9pi8zo0uvfo1jjtmraq.html. The
top 10 URLs are shown in Table 9. We can see that the first
two customer service URLs appear in more than 12,000 suspi-
ciously illegal gambling sites. This indicates that these 6,000
suspiciously illegal gambling sites are likely operated by the
same groups or individuals. The total top 10 customer ser-
vice URLs cover 41,646 (31.1% of 133,874) gambling websites,
indicating that there are a few groups or individuals who
control a large number of suspiciously illegal gambling sites.
Then we sort customer service URLs by the number of
accounts registered by suspiciously illegal gambling sites.
Here, we use effective second-level domain (e2LD) to rep-
resent customer service providers. Table 10 lists the top 10
customer service providers. We can see the provider abused
most is livechatvalue.com. More than 34,000 gambling sites
utilize this provider. Note that both the 4th and the 5th e2LD
belong to Tencent, of which one is for PC and the other is
for mobile.
4.7 Abuse of Third-party Payment
Channel
Gambling sites widely employ third-party payment channel
due to its convenience and reliability. We investigate third-
party payment channels and find more than 1,140 third-party
payment channels abused by illegal gambling site. We extract
the domain of these payment channels from Sitesдamble, and
find them in 67,633 gambling websites.
Then we check the structure difference between the pay-
ment sites by using the similarity checker illustrated in Sec-
tion 3.3, and found 17 different website template. According
to the structure characteristic, we divide these payment web-
site into two categories. One provides QR code (users can
make a payment through scanning the QR Code) and the
other requires filling credit card information (users need to
submit the credit card information to make a payment).
We extract the payment methods from all the payment
websites, as shown in Table 11. We observe that online gam-
bling sites contains all the payment methods that are widely
used by people. For example, Alipay is the most popular pay-
ment method in China, which also appears in nearly 90% of
illegal gambling websites. In addition, illegal gambling sites
frequently change the recipient accounts to evade the law
enforcement. We monitored the recipient accounts of 100
gambling websites for a month. We observed that 63 of them
change their recipient accounts and 47 of them switched
their payment methods during this period. More details are
illustrated in Section 5.1.
4.8 Summary
From measurements and analysis results illustrated in this
section, we find that there exist a number of groups or indi-
viduals who control a large number of suspiciously illegal
gambling sites. Here, we summarize the findings mentioned
above and conduct a further analysis on the groups or indi-
viduals.
If two different gambling sites share the same recipient
account or customer service URL, we consider these two
gambling sites are operated by the same group or individ-
ual. We obtain 6,581 different groups or individuals behind
suspiciously gambling sites (6,581 clusters). Then we use
the similarity algorithm illustrated in Section 3.4 to extract
HTML templates in each cluster. The result is shown in Ta-
ble 12. We find that each cluster contains a large number
of domains while a quite small number of HTML templates
and domain name patterns. It indicates that the operator
leverages a few HTML templates to construct a number of
illegal gambling sites automatically to reduce the labor over-
head, which on the other hand enables us to detect illegal
gambling sites via the HTML templates. We also find that
most of domains in the same cluster are often hosted in the
same IP or the same AS.
We further illustrate the strategy of operating illegal gam-
bling sites. First of all, operators usually provide different
types of games in the website. In the deployment of the
website, the operators purchase a large number of domain
names and deploys them in servers on different AS in or-
der to evade detection. For the domain name selection, the
operators choose a plurality of domain names for bulk reg-
istration and management. For the content of the website,
operators prefer to use images extensively. In order to reduce
the cost, the operators utilize public cloud storage (sinaimg,
CDN etc) to store the website resources, especially images.
For the choice of customer service, they usually purchase
online third-party service. For the most important part (i.e.,
payment channel), the operators use a variety of different
payment methods at the same time (including Wechat pay,
alipay, etc), and change the recipient accounts to avoid risks.
After the deployment is completed, promotion plays an im-
portant role to attract potential customers. The navigation
