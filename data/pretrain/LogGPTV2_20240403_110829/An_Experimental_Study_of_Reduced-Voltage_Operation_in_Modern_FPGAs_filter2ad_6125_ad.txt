6. Combining Undervolting with Architectural
CNN Optimization Techniques
In this section, we experimentally evaluate undervolting for
employing the CNN’s quantization and pruning techniques.
Via experiments, we observe that these bit reduction tech-
niques can deliver additional power-efﬁciency gains propor-
tional to the quantization/pruning level. However, applying
these techniques can slightly increase the vulnerability of
CNNs to undervolting-related faults. This section reports
results for VGGNet as we observe similar results for other
workloads.
6.1. Quantization
Our baseline is optimized with INT8 precision. As shown in
Table 1, this precision does not incur any signiﬁcant accuracy
loss in comparison to baseline models that use ﬂoating-point
precision. For further analysis of the effect of undervolting
with lower precision models, we evaluate INT7, INT6, INT5,
and INT4 precisions. Using DNNDK, we observe signiﬁcant
accuracy loss for INT3, INT2, and INT1 when executed at
Vnom. Thus, we do not present them in this paper.
Figure 7 shows results of different precisions (INT8 to
INT4). We ﬁnd that i) when operating at reduced-voltage
levels, accuracy loss is relatively high due to lower precision;
ii) power-efﬁciency is proportional to voltage as well as quan-
tization levels. In conclusion, combining low-precision and
low-voltage operation can signiﬁcantly deliver higher power-
efﬁciency. However, it comes at the cost of accuracy loss.

6.2. Pruning
Figure 8 shows results of pruned and baseline (without any
pruning) models. We ﬁnd that undervolting-related faults have
a relatively more signiﬁcant effect on the pruned model. How-
ever, this comes with higher power-efﬁciency of the pruned
model, as shown in Figure 8b, due to fewer operations in the
pruned model. With undervolting, power consumption reduces
for both pruned and baseline models, at a similar rate. Vcrash
is different for the pruned model. Speciﬁcally, the pruned
version demonstrates a higher Vcrash voltage equal to 555mV
in contrast to the baseline Vcrash of 540mV .

7. Effect of Environmental Temperature
The power consumption of a modern chip, including FPGAs,
also depends on temperature. Temperature affects static power
consumption. As the external temperature increases, the leak-
age current and, in turn, the leakage-induced static power
increases [11, 38, 39, 47]. As technology node size reduces,
a large fraction of power consumption comes from the static
power. Therefore, temperature has a larger effect on the power
consumption of denser chips [69]. On the other hand, temper-
ature can have a considerable effect on circuit latency [70, 72],
i.e.,, circuit latency decreases as the temperature increases in
contemporary technology nodes. Therefore, there are fewer
undervolting-related faults at higher temperatures.
To understand the combination of multiple effects men-
tioned above, we study the effect of the environmental tem-
perature on the power-reliability trade-off of our FPGA-based
CNN accelerator under reduced-voltage operation. To this
end, we use GoogleNet as a benchmark and undervolt VCCINT .
We discuss the voltage behavior in both critical and guardband
regions at different temperatures ranging from 34◦C to 52◦C
degrees. To regulate the FPGA temperature, we control the
fan speed using the PMBus interface. We also use the same
PMBus interface to monitor the on-board live temperature. By
doing so, we can test different ambient temperatures ranging
from 34◦C to 52◦C degrees.4
7.1. Temperature Effect on Power Consumption
Figure 9 depicts the power consumption of our CNN accelera-
tor when executing GoogleNet with different VCCINT values at
different temperatures. Clearly, temperature has a direct effect
on power consumption. As temperature increases, power con-
sumption proportionally increases. This is due to increase in
static power when the chip heats up. Dynamic power consump-
tion is also affected by temperature, but this effect is almost
negligible. Importantly, we observe that the effect of tempera-
ture on power consumption reduces for lower voltages. For ex-
ample power change from 34◦C to 52◦C are 0.46% and 0.15%,
respectively at VCCINT = 850mV and VCCINT = 650mV .
4[34◦C, 52◦C] is the temperature range that we could generate using
the fan speed. Experimenting with wider temperature ranges requires more
facilities, which were not available to us.

• At any speciﬁc voltage point in either region, power con-
sumption directly increases as temperature increases, mainly
due to the direct relation of static power consumption and
temperature.
• The effect of temperature on power consumption is signiﬁ-
cantly less at lower voltage levels, due to the relatively lower
contribution of static power to total power consumption.
• In the critical voltage region and at any speciﬁc voltage
level, higher temperature leads to higher CNN accuracy.
The power cost of the higher temperature in the critical
voltage region is relatively low.
Consequently, a lower voltage can be applied at higher
temperatures without causing signiﬁcant accuracy loss at a
small power cost.
8. Related Work
To our knowledge, this paper provides the ﬁrst study evaluating
the effect of reduced-voltage operation in FPGA-based CNN
accelerators. In this section, we review related works on i)
undervolting, ii) power-efﬁcient CNNs, and iii) reliability of
CNNs.
8.1. Undervolting
Supply voltage underscaling below the nominal level is an
effective approach to improve the power-efﬁciency of digi-
tal circuits. There are two different approaches to studying
undervolting: simulation or real experiments.
8.1.1. Simulation Studies. This approach simulates hard-
ware to study undervolting.
It is convenient for early-
stage studies as it does not require large engineering ef-
fort. However, this approach lacks the information of real
hardware, and thus, validation of results is the main con-
cern. Most of the existing simulation-based studies are for
CPUs [81, 89, 108, 127] and speciﬁcally for CPU components
such as caches [2,23,118,119,126] and branch predictors [20].
There are also studies for ASIC CNN accelerators [5, 86, 132].
Following this approach, studies on FPGA-based designs are
either fully in simulation [70] or emulation of FPGA netlists
on simulation frameworks [45, 90].
8.1.2. Experimental Studies on Real Hardware. Evaluating
undervolting on real hardware is another approach that has
recently been considered for multiple devices [31, 79]. Doing
so requires relatively more engineering effort as well as con-
sidering physical constraints, such as non-standard device- and
vendor-dependent voltage distribution models. Yet, the results
produced are accurate and can be directly used in real-world
applications.
Undervolting of real hardware is studied for various sys-
tem components, such as CPUs [8, 10, 43, 76, 77], GPUs [55,
56, 138], ASICs [17, 48, 75], DRAMs [18, 19, 50], and Flash
disks [14–16]. These studies focus on voltage guardband anal-
ysis, fault characterization, and fault mitigation. Undervolting
on real FPGAs is not thoroughly investigated. Very recent

7.2. Temperature Effect on Reliability
Figure 10 shows the effect of temperature on the accuracy of
our reduced-voltage CNN accelerator. Our experiment demon-
strates that i) there is no noticeable change in the size of the
guardband and critical regions, and ii) higher temperature at a
particular voltage level leads to higher CNN accuracy. This
is because at higher temperatures, there are fewer undervolt-
ing related errors due to decreased circuit latency, an artifact
due to the Inverse Thermal Dependence (ITD) property of
contemporary technology nodes [72, 113].

7.3. Discussion
In our setup, considering the power-reliability trade-off dis-
cussed, the optimal setting is at Temp=50◦ and VCCINT =
565mV , i.e., the minimum voltage level at which there is
almost no accuracy loss due to the healing effect of high tem-
perature. However, the disadvantage of operating at higher
temperatures is the overall decrease in lifetime reliability. Be-
low, we summarize our ﬁndings on temperature effects.
• There is a negligible change in the value of Vmin = 570mV
across temperatures, and thus, there is no signiﬁcant change
in the guardband region. However, the system crashes rela-
tively earlier over temperature variation. We expect, though,
that when the system undergoes a wider temperature range,
there will be a more noticeable change in the Vmin and Vcrash.

works on FPGA undervolting are either accompanied with fre-
quency underscaling [1, 103] that can diminish performance,
or are limited to BRAMs [91, 95–97, 99]. This paper, for the
ﬁrst time, extends real FPGA undervolting studies to multiple
on-chip components of modern FPGA fabrics and evaluates it
in-detail on the power-accuracy trade-off of CNN applications.
8.2. Power-efﬁcient CNNs
Many works aim to improve CNN power-efﬁciency by opti-
mizing the CNN architecture as well as the underlying hard-
ware. In this paper, to achieve signiﬁcant power-efﬁciency,
we combine our hardware-level FPGA undervolting technique
with architectural CNN optimization techniques, including
quantization and pruning.
8.2.1. Architectural Techniques. This approach aims to re-
duce the parameter size of a CNN. The methods of this ap-
proach are independent of the underlying hardware, and in
theory, they can be applied to any hardware, including hard-
ware accelerators. The most common techniques are quantiza-
tion [34, 136, 137], pruning [33, 67, 129], batching [104], loop
unrolling [130], and memory compression [26, 49]. Among
these, quantization and pruning have shown signiﬁcant efﬁ-
ciency without signiﬁcantly compromising the CNN accuracy;
hence, we focus on them in our experiments.
8.2.2. Hardware-level Techniques. An orthogonal approach
to reducing CNN power is to optimize the underlying hardware.
To this end, since traditional processor-based architectures are
inherently power-hungry and not suitable for CNNs, exploiting
a dedicated hardware accelerator is the ﬁrst approach. Further
power savings are possible with low-level techniques, such as
undervolting.
• Hardware Accelerators: Data-ﬂow execution models us-
ing GPUs [37, 46], FPGAs [60, 64, 101, 107, 120] and
ASICs [4, 21, 42, 115] are more efﬁcient choices for CNNs
than traditional CPUs. Among these, FPGAs are more ﬂexi-
ble compared to ASICs and more efﬁcient than GPUs. Efﬁ-
cient exploitation of the underlying hardware is fundamental
for power-efﬁciency, using techniques like resource parti-
tioning [105] and reuse [88, 131]. Our work uses an indus-
trial tool [122] that inherently exploits these techniques.
• Undervolting: Undervolting has been shown to provide
signiﬁcant power-efﬁciency beneﬁt for CNNs when applied
to SRAMs [17], DRAMs [50], ASICs [17, 48, 68, 128, 132],
and heterogeneous systems [24, 25, 100].
8.3. Reliability of CNNs
Although CNNs are inherently resilient to some error rate
in data or underlying hardware, high enough error rates can
cause signiﬁcant accuracy loss. Error sources can be harsh
environments, process manufacturing defects, undervolting,
ionizing particles, noise in data, among others. Hence, CNN
reliability is an active research area. Existing studies are based
on fault injection or real errors.
8.3.1. Simulation-based Fault Injection. These studies in-
ject randomly-generated faults into CNNs, but they do not
consider undervolting [30, 40, 41, 57, 58, 63, 87, 98]. This
approach provides an opportunity for comprehensive fault
characterization of CNNs, such as the sensitivity of different
layers, different location of faults, among others. However,
these works do not consider faults in real hardware, which
potentially can lead to inaccurate analysis.
8.3.2. Faults in Real Hardware. In real-world applica-
tions, such as IoT, airspace, and driver-less cars, CNNs
can potentially experience different types of faults. Var-
ious works evaluate CNN reliability on faulty real hard-
ware, e.g., soft errors [13, 61, 62, 112] and undervolting in
ASICs [17, 54, 59, 116, 117]. This approach requires signif-
icant engineering effort but can result in relatively more ac-
curate results. None of these works study CNN reliability on
undervolted FPGAs.
9. Summary and Future Work
In this paper, we experimentally evaluated the effects of supply
voltage underscaling below the nominal level on real FPGA-
based CNN accelerators. We showed that we could improve
the power-efﬁciency of such accelerators by more than 3X
via undervolting. 2.6X of the power-efﬁciency improvement
comes from eliminating the voltage guardband (without com-
promising CNN accuracy), while the remaining 43% improve-
ment comes from undervolting further below the guardband
(which comes with CNN accuracy loss). We conclude that
undervolting can signiﬁcantly improve the power-efﬁciency
of FPGA-based neural network accelerators.
As future work, we aim to develop i) fault mitigation tech-
niques for very low-voltage regions even when the design
operates at the maximum frequency (Fmax), ii) dynamic volt-
age adjustment techniques considering temperature, accuracy,
power consumption, and performance trade-off. We also aim
to expand our experiments in hardware, by evaluating more
FPGAs, as well as in software, by repeating experiments on
other CNN platforms like DNNWeaver [101]. Finally, we
believe it is promising to study potential security issues of
FPGA-based CNN accelerators under reduced supply voltage
levels.
