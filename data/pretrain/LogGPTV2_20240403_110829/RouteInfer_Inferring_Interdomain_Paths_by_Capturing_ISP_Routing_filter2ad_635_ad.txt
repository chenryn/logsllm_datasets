preference rank of the entire list of candidate routes. It should be noted that we
can only know a decision AS prefers the best route to another candidate route.

We do not know the relative preference between the two routes which are not
selected as the best route. Therefore, the pairwise approach is more suitable for
solving our problem.
Among the pairwise algorithms, RankNet [42], LambdaRank [43], and Lamb-
daMART [29] have proven to be very successful pairwise LTR algorithms for
solving real-world ranking problems [44]. First, we evaluate which model is the
best for our problem. We want to know that given two candidate routes, can
models predict which one the AS prefer? We use four classic metrics, accuracy,
precision, recall, and area under curve (AUC) to evaluate the performance of
three models as shown in Fig. 12. All three models perform strongly with over
90% of four metrics (the higher the better). We can see that LambdaRank and
LambdaMART perform better than Ranknet. Besides, LambdaRank and Lamb-
daMART are based on the decision tree and the gradient boosting decision tree.
They are explainable and can give us an opportunity to conduct further analysis.
Comparison with Default Poli-
cies. Next, we try to ﬁgure out the
accuracy for predicting route deci-
sions using our LTR models. Predict-
ing route decisions represents ﬁnd-
ing the best route among multiple
candidate routes. Figure 13 depicts
the accuracy of three LTR models
and three default policies. We can
see that, compared with using default
policies to predict route decisions,
three LTR models are more accurate,
with accuracy between 60.38% and
67.07%. LambdaMART performs the
best among the three LTR models.
Route decision model based on LambdaMART improves the average accuracy of
51.11% than that of shortest valley-free, 126.4% than that of standard policies,
and 313.2% than that of the shortest path.

sion against default policies
5.5 Analysis of 3-Layer Policies
In this subsection, we further analyze policies inferred in our 3-layer policy model.
Our analysis mainly wants to answer the following two questions: (1) Whether
ASes in the diﬀerent tiers have diﬀerent routing behaviors? (2) Many ASes set
preﬁx policies for traﬃc engineering. Which ASes do those preﬁxes belong to?
Whether there are some ASes for which most of ASes set preﬁx policies?
Tier vs. Routing Behaviors. We ﬁrst investigate the relationship between
tier and routing behaviors. We classify ASes into three classes according to their
routing behaviors. If an AS sets at least one preﬁx policy, we call it preﬁx-level
AS. If an AS does not set any preﬁx policy but set at least one destAS policy,
we call it destAS-level AS. If an AS does not set any preﬁx policy or destAS
236
T. Wu et al.
policy and only set neighbor policy, we call it neighbor-level AS. We do not
consider ASes with fewer inferred policies (less than 100 policies) since we have
little information on their routing behaviors. We count the degree and AS rank
of the three classes of ASes as shown in Fig. 14. We can see that preﬁx-level
ASes tend to have large degrees and small AS ranks. On the contrary, neighbor-
level ASes tend to have small degrees and large AS ranks. Therefore, ASes in
high-tiers tend to set ﬁne-grained policies while ASes in low-tiers tend to set
coarse-grained policies.
Fig. 14. Tier vs. routing behaviors.
Destination ASes for Which Most of ASes Set Preﬁx Policies. Next,
we investigate most of ASes set preﬁx policies for the traﬃc from which ASes.
If an AS sets a preﬁx policy, we map the destination preﬁx of the policy to
the corresponding destination AS. For each destination AS, we count how many
ASes set preﬁx policies for it. We rank the destination ASes according to the
number of ASes which set preﬁx policies for the destination AS shown in Table
1. Interestingly, all top destination ASes are worldwide CDN service providers.
Anwar et al. [14] found destination ASes owned by Akamai account for most of
the routing decisions which deviate from standard routing policies. Our analysis
conﬁrms their ﬁndings and shows deep reasons. Not only Akamai but almost all
CDN ASes are the destination ASes for which most of ASes set preﬁx policies.
The reason why the paths towards those ASes deviate from standard policies is
that most ASes set ﬁne-grained preﬁx policies for the traﬃc from those ASes.
This result also tells us we should use preﬁx policies to infer the paths towards
CDN ASes.
5.6 Analysis of Route Decision Model
In this subsection, we try to analyze our explainable LTR route decision model
and try to answer the questions: What is the importance of the features used
in our route decision model? What is the diﬀerence between standard routing
policies and the model learned from empirical data?

Feature Importance Analysis. We rank all features by their F scores which
are calculated by the number of times a feature appears in a tree. As shown
in Fig. 15, we ﬁnd the most important feature is the degree and AS rank of
next-hop AS. Sometimes, ASes prefer to choose the routes whose next-hop ASes
are in high-tiers. We ﬁnd the feature of path length is as equal importance as
the feature of co-located facilities and IXPs between decision AS and next-hop
AS. Sometimes, ASes prefer to choose the routes with more co-located IXPs
and facilities between the decision AS and the next-hop AS. Perhaps counter-
intuitively, the less important feature is the business relationship between the
decision AS and the next-hop AS. This result proves standard import policies
are oversimpliﬁed indeed and conﬁrms our measurement results in Sect. 3. What
are the reasons for these discrepancies with the standard preference rules? We
investigate this in the following analysis.
238
T. Wu et al.
Fig. 17. Analysis of the violations of standard preference rule. No consensus means
three algorithms do not reach a consensus on the relationship of links. Same relationship
means two neighbor ASes have the same relationship but diﬀerent preferences. Sibling
means the violation is due to a sibling-to-sibling relationship link. Complex relationship
means the violation is due to a partial transit relationship or a hybrid relationship
link [45].
Violations of Standard Preference Rule. The standard preference rule says
the local preference is customer>peer>provider. So there exist three kinds of vio-
lations: (1) provider>peer (2) provider>customer (3) peer>customer. We count
the proportion of the three violations from our inferred routing policies. To
investigate the violations of standard policies, we need to know the business
relationship between ASes. A single relationship inference algorithm may have
many faults. Therefore, we use three state-of-the-art algorithms, AS-Rank [24],
ProbLink [46] and TopoScope [47] to infer AS relationships respectively. We
only consider the links for which all three algorithms reach a consensus on their
relationship. Figure 17 depicts the statistic of the violations of the standard pref-
erence rule. We can see that most of the violations are because the ASes prefer
the routes received from a provider to the route received from a peer. We further
analyze why they do not prefer the peer. We call these p2p links violative p2p
links. Then we use IXP data to locate those violative p2p links to corresponding
IXPs and count the number of violative p2p links in each IXP. IXP data can
tell us a list of interconnection facilities and associated AS. We check the inter-
connection IXP list of two ASes and ﬁnd the shared IXP. The result is shown
in Fig. 16. We can see that it obeys power-law distribution. Therefore, a small
number of IXPs contain most of the violative p2p links. Table 2 shows the top
10 IXPs with most of the violative p2p links. Those ten IXPs contains 81.65%
violative p2p links. We can see that all IXPs are located in Europe. But if all
large IXPs are located in Europe, our ﬁnding is meaningless. Therefore, we col-
lect the largest IXPs [48] and show them in Table 3. Brazil, Russia, USA all have
large IXPs. But they do not contain too many violative p2p links. Therefore,
we can see that many violations of the standard preference rule are because the
ASes prefer a provider to a peer and those violations are related to the IXPs in
Europe.

6 Conclusion and Future Work
With an in-depth analysis on the limitations of standard routing policies, we pro-
pose RouteInfer, an accurate interdomain path inference algorithm by capturing
routing behavior diversity and generality. RouteInfer increases the accuracy by
about 30.04% to 182.3% compared with existing algorithms. The two key com-
