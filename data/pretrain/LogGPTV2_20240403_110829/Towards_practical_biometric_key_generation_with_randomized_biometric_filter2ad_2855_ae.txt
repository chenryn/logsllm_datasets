# Performance and Security Analysis of RBTs

## 1. Introduction
This document provides a detailed analysis of the performance and security of Robust Biometric Templates (RBTs) compared to a baseline approach. The results are presented in terms of Equal Error Rate (EER), False Rejection Rate (FRR), and resistance to search algorithms.

## 2. Performance Metrics

### 2.1 Equal Error Rate (EER)
The EER is a measure of the point where the False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and False Rejection Rate (FRR) are equal. Lower EER values indicate better performance.

### 2.2 Number of Guesses Required by Search Algorithms
We empirically estimate the number of guesses required by an adversary to find a key, which provides a more practical measure of security.

## 3. Experimental Results

### 3.1 EER and FRR Comparison
Figure 2 shows the performance of RBTs with different parameters (k = 50%, n = N) against forgeries. The EER for RBTs under the Concatenative Synthesis (CS) algorithm is approximately 28.5% at no errors corrected. Trained human forgers achieve an EER of approximately 18% at 1 error-corrected for both parameter choices.

**Table 2: Comparison between RBTs and Baseline Approach**
| Method | Parameters | EER | Errors | Forgers |
|--------|------------|-----|--------|---------|
| RBT (a) | k = 30%, n = 50 | 17.7% | 1 | 19% |
| RBT (b) | k = 50%, n = N | 27% | 1 | 30% |
| Baseline | - | 20.6% | 4 | 27.4% |

### 3.2 Resistance to Search Algorithms
Figure 3 illustrates the number of guesses required by the search algorithm to find RBT-derived keys. RBTs with parameters (k = 50%, n = N) outperform the baseline approach for 40% of the population, and for over 30% of the population, this improvement is significant. However, for approximately 15% of users, the algorithm correctly predicts the target user’s key on the first attempt, highlighting the power of the original search-based attack.

**Figure 3: Number of Guesses Required by Search Algorithm**

- **Baseline**: Exhausts the complete key space at 244 guesses.
- **RBT (k = 50%, n = N)**: Requires approximately 280 guesses for 14.6% of the population.

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 Observations
- **EER and FRR**: RBTs offer more resistance to forgery and maintain lower FRRs compared to the baseline. The EER for RBTs occurs at 0 or 1 errors, while the baseline EERs occur at 3-4 errors.
- **Search Resistance**: Even with access to the user's password, RBTs with (k = 50%, n = N) are stronger than the baseline for a significant portion of the population.

### 4.2 Hypothesis
The improved performance of RBTs is attributed to the use of stronger features, which allow for more error tolerance while maintaining security. This reduces the FRR and increases the difficulty for attackers.

## 5. Conclusion
We propose a new technique to extract more entropy from biometrics for key generation purposes. By measuring biometrics differently for each user, we reduce error rates, enhance security, and increase the potential theoretical entropy. Our analysis shows that RBTs allow many users to generate keys that are stronger than passwords alone.
