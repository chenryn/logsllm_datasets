ABSTRACT
In this paper, we propose FlyCast, an architecture using the
physical layer of free-space optics (FSO) to accelerate multi-
cast communication. FlyCast leverages oﬀ-the-shelf devices
(e.g.
switchable mirror, beam splitter) to physically split
the FSO beam to multi receivers on demand, which enables
to build dynamical multicast trees in physical layer and ac-
celerates multicast communications. We demonstrate the
feasibility of FlyCast through our theoretical analysis and
the proof-of-concept prototype.

INTRODUCTION
One-to-many group communication is common in mod-
ern data centers running cloud and web-based applications,
or high performance computing (HPC) applications. Those
examples of cloud computing applications include publish-
subscribe services, Hadoop using data replication for higher
availability, network virtualization installing OS and appli-
cation images on a group of virtual machines. High per-
formance and scientiﬁc computing applications, often using
MPI group communication extensively, have been examined
and deployed in existing cloud computing infrastructures.
Multicast, an eﬃcient mechanism for group communica-
tions, beneﬁts the network by reducing bandwidth overhead
and latency between group members, alleviating in hotspot
or network congestion due to huge volume and high fan-
out traﬃcs. Traditional multicast solutions in cloud and
HPC data center mainly is optimized and implemented on
top of network, transport or upper layers [1], which suﬀer
from suboptimal multicast trees and high complexity. Re-
cently, hybrid network architecture that combines wireless
(e.g. 60GHz, free-space optics) or optical space switches
(OSS) to traditional wired electrical switches has been pro-

posed to dynamically adapt to traﬃc demand .The physical
layer broadcast media of wireless and optics have the nature
of one-to-many communication, which are very suitable for
group traﬃc pattern. Yu, et. al., utilizes the narrow-beam
of 60GHz to construct a wired and wireless mixed multicast
tree [4]. Xia, et. al., uses passive power splitters and OSS to
set up a dynamical multicast tree, and the data is optically
replicated from source to destinations [3].
Free-Space Optics (FSO) is an emerging technology with
the advantage of free wiring and low latency in constructing
ﬂexible data center network [2]. Compared with 60GHz, it
has the beneﬁts of high bandwidth and low interference. Ad-
ditionaly, with the switchable mirror (SM), it’s more ﬂexible
and expandable than OSS. To the best of our knowledge, no
existing equivalent work leverages the physical layer of FSO
to accelerate multicast communication.
In this paper, we
propose an architecture named FlyCast, which utilizes com-
mercial oﬀ-the-shelf devices (e.g. SM, beam splitter) to split
the FSO beam to multi receivers on demand.

Our work is inspired by the Fireﬂy, which exploits SMs
to construct a ﬂexible and fully FSO interconnected net-
work [2]. Each FSO device is equipped with multiple SMs.
The SMs are made up of a special liquid crystal material
which can be electrically controlled to rapidly switch be-
tween pure-reﬂection (mirror), half-reﬂection (mixed) and
total transparent (glass) states. Fireﬂy dynamically estab-
lishes the link by switching one of the SMs to mirror state,
while leaving the rest in glass state. The Fireﬂy only sup-
ports one-to-one communication. However, FlyCast makes
use of the mixed state of SMs to optically duplicate data to
multiple receivers, as shown in Fig. 1. The glass state (e.g.
2nd SM) means that the related terminal does not receive
the data, meanwhile there exist receivers at behind. On the
contrary, the SM with mirror state (e.g. 3rd SM) steers all
the received beam to the related receiver. When both the
related terminal and followed terminals can receive data, the
SM leaves in mixed state (e.g. 1st SM). Hence, the source
can simultaneously send data to Rx-1 and Rx-3 at line-rate.
97Next, we will use a motivating example to show what kind
beneﬁts of FlyCast delivers, as shown in Fig.2. We assume
that every Top-of-Rack (ToR) switch has two ports and each
port is equipped with two SMs (links with same color mean
that the SMs share the common FSO), and the dynamical
topology is shown as Fig. 2(a). The runtime topology can be
changed between Fig. 2 (b) and (c) by the controller. When
ToR A sends the same data to ToR E and C, no matter what
routing paths are used or how to change the states of SMs
according to Fireﬂy, it needs at least three hops to complete
the multicast communication.
In this scenario, using the
physical layer of FSO, ToR A can simultaneously send data
to C and E via one hop, as shown in Fig. 2(d) and (e).

Figure 2: An Example of the Advantage of FlyCast
Traditional distributed multicast routing protocols are dif-
ﬁcult to realize in the asymmetric network. The FlyCast
performs routing protocol in the control plane of software-
deﬁned networking (SDN) architecture. Moreover, the con-
troller manages the joining and leaving of group members
through interacting with the applications, and the SDN swit-
ches should support multicast rules. Given the group mem-
bers, network controller runs the control algorithm to com-
pute network topology and adjust the states of SMs. The
problem of computing network topology turns into building
a directed Steiner tree with additional constraints. Though
it is a NP-hard problem, there exist solutions based on ap-
proximation algorithms. However, edges sharing the same
port are conﬂicted, we have to modify the existing approaches
to construct multicast trees. For the direct edge 
chosen as the subset of the multicast tree, we will prune the
other edges connected to b except , thus guaranteeing
the in-degree of successors at most 1.
3. THE FEASIBILITY OF FLYCAST
The signal of FSO will be degraded when passing through
a beam splitter. Let l denote the transmittance (from 0.5 to
0.9) and let S/N denote the signal-noise ratio of the initial
FSO. From Eq. 1 we can ﬁnd out that the degradation of
FSO signal is determined by the transmittance.
10 lg (l ∗ S/N ) = 10 lg(S/N ) + 10 lg(l)
(1)
Only the power of last received signal Rk and Rk+1 which
passes through k beam splitters are greater than the transcei-
vers’ receiver sensitivity, all data can be recovered correctly.
M ax : k, subjectto :
Rk, Rk+1 > B
Rk+1 = A − n ∗ k
Rk = A − n ∗ (k − 1) − m
n = −10 lg(l)
m = −10 lg(1 − l)

The calculation process is as follows: Let A denote the
output power of the transceiver and B denote the receiver
sensitivity. Eq. 2 to Eq. 4 guarantee that the reﬂected
and passed signal are stronger than the receiver sensitivity.
The degradations of signal under diﬀerent transmittances
are described in Eq. 5 and Eq. 6. The goal is to maximize
the number of beam splitters.
The transceiver has a maximum output power of 4dBm
and a receiver sensitivity of -15dBm. Fig. 3 illustrates
the relationship between the transmittances and number of
beam splitters. Note that the initial FSO can be split up to
20 times with the transmittance of 0.9. Though the trans-
mittance of SM in mixed state is about 0.5, the SM can be
replaced with continuous switchable glass or MEMS-based
mirrors and beam splitters with diﬀerent transmittances.

Furthermore, we develop a proof-of-concept prototype to
validate the result of above theoretical analysis, as shown in
Fig. 4. We test the signal loss from one to three beam split-
ters with the transmittance of 0.5. Considering the misalign-
ment of collimator and the number of beam splitters, the
signal loss is consistent with the theoretical value (3dBm),
as shown in Tab. 1.
