User: Instead of encapsulating my entire code in a try{} except{} block, is there someway of catching exceptions globally?
Basically I am looking for a way to have a global exception handler which will handle all unhandled exceptions in the my python application written for google app engine
Assistant: Well, at the most basic level you could wrap all of your handler scripts referenced by app.yaml in a giant try-except block.
If you are using the webapp framework, consider overriding handle_exception() for each of your request handlers.  If you want all of your request handlers to have some basic exception handling that you specify, you could a request handler which implements this method and then derive all of your handlers from it.
