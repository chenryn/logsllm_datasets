When using the Command+Shift+B shortcut to view modified files, you may encounter a situation where multiple files with the same leaf filename have been modified. For example, in a Rails project, you might have `lib/my_lib.rb` and `config/initializers/my_lib.rb`. In such cases, only one of these files will be displayed in the list of modified files. In my experience, it was the file located in the `config` directory that appeared.

To ensure clarity and avoid confusion, it's important to verify which specific file has been modified by checking the full path.
