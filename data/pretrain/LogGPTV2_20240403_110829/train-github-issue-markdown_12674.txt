When you look at modified files through Command+Shift+B you may have modified
multiple files with the same leaf filename. For example, in a rails project
you may have lib/my_lib.rb and config/initializers/my_lib.rb. In this case
only one of them shows up in the list of modified files, in my case it was the
config one.
