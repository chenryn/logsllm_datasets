Overall measured traffic is shown from 2006-2010 using datasets D-1, D-2, D-3, D-4, D-5.

In 2003, a significant spike in traffic was observed, infecting thousands of hosts within 10 minutes. This spike was manually verified to be Slammer exploits by comparing the payload with the well-known SQL Slammer payload. The re-emergence of the worm or other scanning efforts, five years after the initial outbreak, is puzzling. When compared to the results reported in [10], the percentages of TCP traffic in terms of packets appear very similar.

**Table 5** shows the most popular TCP ports in terms of the total percentage of TCP traffic. Compared to the results reported in [10] in 2004, by the time of dataset D1 in 2006, we notice only a minor increase in port 445 activity and a general decrease in the fraction of the reported popular ports (i.e., 80, 135, 139) in the study. We observe the same dynamism as reported in that study, with ports such as 4662 appearing and disappearing in popularity. While most of these shifts are short-lived and seemingly without explanation, several major events stand out. Notably, the dramatic increase in traffic on port 445 in 2009-2010 is consistent with the emergence of the Conficker botnet in October 2008. Another interesting artifact visible in the data is the emergence of SSH scanning as a significant percentage of background radiation traffic starting in 2007. Scans on TCP port 23 also begin to emerge starting in 2007, indicating a significant uptick in attempts to locate backdoors installed by various worms.

**Table 6** shows the most commonly used flags in TCP packets over time as a percentage of the total number of packets. A clear trend is visible from this data, which is the steady increase in packets with only the SYN flag set. From 2006 to 2010, the total percentage of TCP packets with the SYN flag increases from 63% to almost 94%, while the percentage of packets with SYN-ACK flags set decreases dramatically from 26.1% in 2006 to 5.2% in 2010. It is unclear if this indicates an increase in scanning activity and a decline in DDoS activity.

The emergence of Conficker also accounts for perhaps the most significant shift in the nature of Internet background radiation. **Figure 3** shows the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of all destinations for which traffic was received in the 35/8 darknet. The 2006 CDF is virtually a straight line, indicating no significant hotspot activity in this traffic. However, starting in 2008, a knee starts to form in the CDF, indicating the emergence of hotspot activity. Finally, in 2009 and 2010, we observe a very pronounced kink in the CDF. This is congruent with a bug in Confickerâ€™s pseudo-random propagation algorithm [27]. This bug causes it to fix bits 8 and 24 (most-significant bits of octets 2 and 4, respectively) as 0, resulting in Conficker propagation scans being limited to only 1/4 of the Internet address space. In all observed /8s after 2008, we observe roughly three times less traffic for destination IPs with a second or fourth octet of 128 or greater.

### Spatial Analysis of Internet Background Radiation

**Figure 4: Spatial analysis of Internet Background Radiation.**  
Overall measured traffic (bytes and packets) is shown for datasets A-1, A-2, B-1, B-2, C-1, C-2.

**Figure 5: Spatial analysis of Internet Background Radiation.**  
Overall measured traffic by protocols is shown for datasets A-1, A-2, B-1, B-2, C-1, C-2.

One of the most dramatic features is the enormous volume of traffic in 1/8. The 1/8 network sees Internet Background Radiation rates as high as 150 Mbps. As discussed in the following section, most of this traffic is directed toward a small number of destinations in 1/8 due to misconfiguration in a wide range of Internet devices. Both 50/8 and 107/8 traffic rates show a significant diurnal pattern with almost similar data rates. The overall darknet traffic volume ranges from 20-40 Mbps or 40-60 Kbps. One puzzling feature visible in these figures is the clipped nature of the 35/8 graphs. We believe this is caused by a rate limit on a device present in the path of our data collector. While we have been able to verify that such a limit is not present in our own collection network, we have so far not been able to verify that there is no such setting at our upstream provider. The traffic volume by protocol is shown in **Figure 5**. The traffic volume in Figures 5 and 4 shows a sharp dip on day 7 of the A-1 dataset, caused by a temporary duplicate BGP announcement by APNIC.

Only those ports whose contribution to total traffic at a block that were different by more than 1% are shown.

| TCP Port | A1 - A2 | B1 - B2 | C1 - C2 |
|----------|---------|---------|---------|
| 21       | 40.3    | 1.7     | 8.7     |
| 25       | 1.6     | -75.0   | 32.5    |
| 80       | -       | -       | -       |
| 443      | -       | -       | -       |
| 445      | -       | -       | -       |
| 143      | -       | -       | -       |
| 1024     | -       | -       | -       |
| 5022     | -       | -       | -       |
| 6112     | -       | -       | -       |

The top 20 UDP destination ports are shown using datasets A-[1,2], B-[1,2], C-[1,2].

**Figure 9: Spatial analysis of Internet Background Radiation.**  
The distribution of TTL values for UDP traffic is shown using datasets A-[1,2], B-[1,2], C-[1,2].

The source Operating System estimate obtained by observing the TTL values in the TCP packets shows that the relative volume of traffic generated from the various sources appears to be the same for 35/8, 50/8, and 107/8 (datasets A-2, B-1, B-2, C-1, C-2). Recall that the default TTL values for Windows, Linux, and Solaris are 128, 64, and 255, respectively. Windows hosts tend to dominate the total traffic volume by various sources in all except the 1/8 darknet block, where Linux sources are responsible for a majority of the traffic. Analysis of the UDP TTL values displays a similar distribution for all darknets except once again the 1/8, where we see Windows, Linux, Solaris, and perhaps some embedded devices as possible contributors to the pollution. For example, we were able to identify some pollution at this network subnet (/24) %pkts %bytes.

| Subnet (/24) | %pkts | %bytes |
|--------------|-------|--------|
| 58.7         | 9.4   | 6.2    |
| 8.6          | 0.3   | 2.4    |
| 0.1          | 0.1   | -      |
