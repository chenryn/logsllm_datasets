10 minutes in 2003, infecting thousands of hosts. We were
able to manually verify that this spike was indeed Slammer
exploits and not some other exploit by verifying the pay-
load and comparing it with the well known SQL Slammer
payload. Whether the re-emergence of the worm or other
scanning eﬀorts, its occurrence at scale ﬁve years after the
initial outbreak is puzzling. It should be noted that when
compared to the results reported in [10] the percentages of
TCP traﬃc in terms of packets appears very similar.
Table 5 shows the most popular TCP ports in terms of
the total percentage of TCP traﬃc. When compared to the
results reported in [10] in 2004 by the time of dataset D1
in 2006 we notice only a minor up-tick in port 445 activ-
ity and a general decrease in the fraction of the reported
popular ports (i.e., 80, 135, 139) in the study. We do, how-
ever, witness the same dynamism as reported in that study,
with ports such as 4662 shown in Table 5 appearing and
disappearing in popularity. While most of these shifts are
short lived and seemingly without explanation, several ma-
jor events stand out. It is particularly interesting to note
the dramatic increase in traﬃc on port 445 in 2009-2010.
This is consistent with the emergence of the Conﬁcker bot-
net in October 2008. Another interesting artifact visible in
the data is the emergence of ssh scanning as a signiﬁcant
percentage of background radiation traﬃc starting in 2007.
Scans on TCP port 23 also begin to emerge starting 2007
which indicates a signiﬁcant up-tick in attempts to locate
backdoors installed by various worms.
Table 6 shows the most commonly used ﬂags in TCP pack-
ets over time as a percentage of total number of packets. A
very clear trend is visible from this data which is the steady
increase in packets which have only the SYN ﬂag set. From
2006 to 2010 the total percentage of TCP packets with SYN
ﬂag increases from 63% to almost 94% at the same time
the percentage of packets with SYN-ACK ﬂags set decreases
dramatically from 26.1% in 2006 to 5.2% in 2010. It is un-
clear if this indicates an increase in scanning activity and a
decline in DDoS activity.
The emergence of Conﬁcker also accounts for perhaps the
most signiﬁcant shift in the nature of Internet background
radiation. Figure 3 shows the Cumulative Distribution Func-
tion (CDF) of all destinations for which traﬃc was received
in the 35/8 darknet. The 2006 CDF is virtually a straight
line, indicating no signiﬁcant hot-spot activity in this traﬃc.
However, starting in 2008 a knee starts to form in the CDF
which indicates the emergence of hot-spot activity. Finally,
in 2009 and 2010 we are able to observe a very pronounced
kink in the CDF.
This is congruent with a bug in Conﬁcker’s pseudo-random
propagation algorithm [27]. This bug causes it to ﬁx bits 8
and 24 (most-signiﬁcant bits of octets 2 and 4, respectively)
as 0, resulting in Conﬁcker propagation scans being limited
to only 1/4 of the Internet address space. In all observed /8s

Table 7: The most signiﬁcant changes in the contri-
bution of a TCP destination port when compared
between blocks. Only those ports whose contribu-
tion to total traﬃc at a block that were diﬀerent by
more than %1 are shown.
after 2008, we observe roughly 3 times less traﬃc for desti-
nation IPs with a second or fourth octet of 128 or greater.
4.2 Spatial Analysis of Internet Background
Radiation
Figures 4, 6, 8, 9, and 7 represent our analysis of datasets
A-[1,2], B-[1,2], and C-[1,2]. The stacked graphs represent
data collected from the 35/8 darknet (A2, B2, and C2) on
the top row, while the bottom row of graphs represents data
collected from 1/8(A1), 50/8(B1), and 107/8(C1).
The overall traﬃc volume in bytes and packets is shown
in Figure 4. One of the most dramatic features is the enor-
mous volume of traﬃc in 1/8. The 1/8 network sees Internet
Background Radiation rates as high as 150Mbps. As we dis-
cuss in the following section, most of this traﬃc is directed
toward a small number of destinations in 1/8, due to mis-
conﬁguration in a wide range of Internet devices. Both 50/8
and 107/8 traﬃc rates show a signiﬁcant diurnal pattern
with almost similar data rates. The overall darknet traﬃc
volume ranges from 20-40Mbps or 40-60Kps. One puzzling
feature visible in these ﬁgures is the clipped nature of the
35/8 graphs. We believe this is caused by a rate limit on
a device that is present in the path of our data collector.
While we have been able to verify that such a limit is not
present in oCDFown collection network, we have so far not
been able to verify that there is no such setting at our up-
stream provider. The traﬃc volume by protocol is shown
in Figure 5. The traﬃc volume in Figures 5 and 4 shows a
sharp dip on day 7 of the A-1 dataset. This was caused by
a temporary duplicate BGP announcement by APNIC.
The ﬁrst column of Figures 6 and 7 show the cumulative
distribution function (CDF) of the cumulative contributions
of traﬃc with destination and source in each /24 network.
The 1/8 graphs show extremely high hotspot activity in both
these ﬁgures as evidenced by the extremely sharp knee in
these graphs. The second and third columns correspond
with datasets B-1 and C-1 respectively. Both of these display
moderate hotspot activity in the destination CDF but the
source CDF graphs are virtually identical across A-2, B-1,
B2, C-1, C-2. We describe some of this hotspot activity in
detail in the next section.
Datasets A-2, B-1, B-2, C-1, and C-2 all display remark-
able similarity in the TCP destination port distributions.
Table 7 summarizes the diﬀerences between these datasets.
It shows ports whose contribution was diﬀerent by more than
1% when compared to the A2, B2, and C2. The most in-
teresting features that we discovered during our analysis of
the UDP destination ports was some unusual activity on
port 514 in dataset B-1, which is the port associated with
syslog, as well as activity on port 15206, which represents
SIP traﬃc in dataset A-1. Figure 8 shows the traﬃc volume
contributed by these features and we discuss some of them
in the following section.
The source Operating System estimate obtained by ob-
serving the TTL values in the TCP packets shows that the
relative volume of traﬃc generated from the various sources
appears to be the same for 35/8, 50/8, and 107/8 (datasets
A-2, B-1, B-2, C-1, C-2). Recall that the default TTL val-
ues for Windows, Linux and Solaris are 128, 64 and 255
respectively. Windows hosts tend to dominate the total traf-
ﬁc volume by various sources in all except the 1/8 darknet
block, where Linux sources are responsible for a majority of
the traﬃc. Analysis of the UDP TTL values displays similar
distribution for all darknets except once again the 1/8 where
we see Windows, Linux, Solaris and perhaps some embedded
devices as possible contributors to the pollution. We were,
for example, able to identify some pollution at this network
