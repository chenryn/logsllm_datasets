## Abstract

Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) is increasingly being deployed and offered as a commercial service to residential broadband customers. Compared to traditional ISP networks, an IPTV distribution network typically adopts a hierarchical structure, imposes more stringent requirements on reliability and performance, uses different distribution protocols (such as IP multicast), and faces significant scalability challenges. These unique characteristics pose substantial challenges in the effective management of IPTV networks and services.

In this paper, we focus on characterizing and troubleshooting performance issues in one of the largest IPTV networks in North America. We collect extensive measurement data from various sources, including device usage and error logs, user activity logs, video quality alarms, and customer trouble tickets. We develop Giza, a novel diagnostic tool tailored for the scale and hierarchical structure of IPTV networks. Giza applies multi-resolution data analysis to quickly detect and localize regions experiencing performance problems and uses statistical data mining techniques to diagnose root causes. Validation against operational experiences demonstrates the effectiveness of GIZE in detecting important performance issues and identifying dependencies. The methodology and algorithms in Giza are expected to be valuable in IPTV network operations.

## 1. Introduction

In recent years, there has been a global trend among telecommunications companies to rapidly roll out Internet Protocol Television (IPTV). IPTV encodes live TV streams into IP packets and delivers them to users through residential broadband access networks. This growth is driven by two key factors: ISPs can offer new services such as triple-play (digital voice, TV, and data) and quadruple-play (digital voice, TV, data, and wireless), and IPTV provides greater flexibility and interactivity for users, opening up opportunities for a wide range of new applications.

Compared to traditional ISP networks, IPTV distribution networks have several unique characteristics:
1. **Stringent Performance and Reliability Requirements:** Even small packet loss and delay can significantly impair video quality, especially during live events.
2. **Tremendous Scale:** A large IPTV network can have millions of residential gateways, with rapid growth in numbers.
3. **Heavy Reliance on IP Multicast:** Although multicast technologies have been available for decades, their widespread deployment and use are relatively recent, leading to limited operational experience.

These characteristics present significant challenges in the effective management of IPTV networks.

In this paper, we focus on characterizing and troubleshooting faults and performance issues in one of the largest commercial IPTV deployments in North America. At the time of writing, the service provider had over one million subscribers across four time zones. We collected a large and diverse set of measurements from both the residential part of the IPTV network and the provider network. These measurements include end-device usage and error logs, user activity logs, video quality alarms, and customer trouble tickets. Analyzing such a vast and diverse dataset for characterization and troubleshooting is a challenging problem.

### Key Challenges
1. **Scalability:** Managing and troubleshooting a vast number of network devices (e.g., millions of residential gateways) and the resulting large volume of network data.
2. **Topological and Routing Models:** Considering the impact scope of network events in a hierarchical multicast tree structure.
3. **Skewed Event Distribution:** Most individual event-series have very small frequency counts, making statistical analysis difficult.
4. **Causal Dependencies:** Discovering causal relationships among diverse events, which can be challenging due to inaccurate timestamps and distributed event propagation.

### Our Contributions
We present the first comprehensive study of performance issues and faults in operational IPTV networks, providing insights into event distribution, spatio-temporal locality, and time-of-day effects. For fault localization and performance troubleshooting, we develop Giza, a multi-resolution infrastructure that includes a suite of novel statistical data mining techniques.

1. **Hierarchical Heavy Hitter Detection:** Identifies spatial locations where symptom events are dominant, reducing the amount of data for subsequent processing.
2. **Statistical Event Correlation Analysis:** Identifies event-series strongly correlated with the heavy hitter symptom, including potential root causes and impacts.
3. **Causal Dependency Discovery:** Uses statistical lag correlation and ℓ1 norm minimization to discover causal dependencies between events, constructing a sparse causal dependency graph.

We evaluate Giza using data from an operational IPTV network and service, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying and troubleshooting performance problems. Giza outperforms a state-of-the-art approach known as WISE. Additionally, we validate our conclusions against operational experiences, showing that Giza is a promising tool for diagnosing and resolving performance issues.

## 2. IPTV Network Performance Characterization

### 2.1 Overview of IPTV Service
Figure 1 shows the architecture of how IPTV service is delivered to residential customers. Live TV streams are encoded in IP packets and delivered through the residential broadband access network. The Super Head-end Office (SHO) encodes video streams received externally and transmits them to multiple Video Head-end Offices (VHOs) via a high-speed IP backbone. VHOs acquire additional local content, perform further processing, and transmit the processed TV streams to end users upon request. The streams pass through intermediate offices (IOs), central offices (COs), and DSLAMs before reaching the residential home.

Inside a home, a Residential Gateway (RG) serves as a modem, connecting to one or more Set-Top Boxes (STBs). Each STB connects to a TV. The hierarchy in Figure 2 shows the pyramid structure of the IPTV network, where each level serves multiple nodes at the next lower level.

Live IPTV streams are delivered via native IP multicast to save bandwidth. STBs also support advanced features such as DVR, VoD, PIP, HD channels, choice programming, online gaming, and chatting.

### 2.2 Data Sets
We collected a large variety of data from one of the largest commercial IPTV service providers in North America, which had over one million subscribers and over two million STBs in use. Our data set includes:
- **Customer Care Call Records:** Complete call records related to service disruptions, resulting in trouble tickets.
- **Video Quality Alarms:** Alarms data from video quality monitors, including packet loss, packet delay, and outage durations.
- **Home Network Performance/Activities:** Event traces from STBs and RGs, including power state, resets, crashes, and reboots.
- **Provider Network Performance/Activities:** SNMP MIBs and traps data from SHOs, VHOs, IOs, and COs, and Syslogs from devices at SHOs and VHOs.

### 2.3 Characterizing IPTV Performance Issues
We conducted our analysis over three months of data collected in 2008, focusing on spatial and temporal patterns of various performance-related events observed along the paths from the SHO to STBs.

#### 2.3.1 Customer Trouble Tickets
Table 1 shows the distribution of customer trouble tickets based on the nature of the reported performance issues. "Live TV video" related issues (e.g., video quality, blue screen, picture freezing) constitute almost half of the trouble tickets, followed by requests for information or upgrades, DVR, and remote control issues.

| Ticket Category | Percentage |
|-----------------|------------|
| Live TV video   | 46.5%      |
| Requested info/upgrade | 12.9% |
| DVR             | 9.6%       |
| Remote control  | 8.2%       |
| Equipment (STB, RG, PC) | 7.7% |
| HD              | 4.4%       |
| Audio           | 3.5%       |
| Program guide   | 1.6%       |
| VoD             | 1.6%       |
| Parental control | 1.6%       |
| Others          | 2.4%       |

#### 2.3.2 Video Quality Alarms
We analyzed video quality alarms reported by video monitors, using the Media Delivery Index (MDI) as a quality indicator. MDI comprises the Delay Factor (DF) and Media Loss Rate (MLR). DF indicates the time duration over which a packet stream must be buffered to prevent packet loss, while MLR measures the number of lost or out-of-order packets. One month of data showed that alarms related to DF contribute to the majority (around 79%) of the alarms, followed by high MLR, video stream outages, transport stream outages, high flow bit rates, high transport stream bit rates, and synchronization errors.

#### 2.3.3 Home Network Performance/Activities
We characterized data traces from STBs and RGs, including STB crashes, resets, power states, and RG reboots. Table 2 shows the distribution of STB crash events, with managed and native crashes being the most common, followed by watch dog reboots and out-of-memory errors.

| Crash Type | Percentage |
|------------|------------|
| Native     | 44.9%      |
| Managed    | 35.9%      |
| Watch dog  | 18.4%      |
| Out of memory | 0.5% |
| Others     | 0.2%       |

Figure 3 shows the distribution of the number of simultaneous native STB crash events occurring within a fixed time-bin of five minutes.
