## ðŸš€ Feature
Support for RPCs having timeouts is being added in #29601, but this isn't
currently per RPC. We would like to extend this to a per-RPC timeout that is
configurable by calls to `rpc.rpc_(a)sync`. The reason for this is that the
user may want more granular control over how long they expect an RPC to last.
See the discussion in the mentioned PR for some more context on the specific
changes that would be needed to implement this.
