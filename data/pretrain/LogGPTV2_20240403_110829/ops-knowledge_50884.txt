User: which one are you using on google app engine?
what were the reasons behind your decision?
Assistant: Imho..
Django - the only part that's relevant is the templating and maybe the no rel..
Webapp - never tried it after
Tipfy - is what I'm using, seems to be more "pylons" like, has a basic apps/modules structure and lots of "helpers" which quite frankly should be in the google.appengine.api
Easy to implement templates and routing is nice. Your pretty much left on your own on how to use tipfy and how to structure the application.
