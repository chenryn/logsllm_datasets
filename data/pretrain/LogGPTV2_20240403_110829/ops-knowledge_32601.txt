User: I'm interested in writing a program in C++ to automate the instructions necessary to run a certain python script I've been experimenting with. I was hoping someone could tell me where to look to find information on sending instructions to the command line from a C++ application, as I don't know what to google to find info on that.
Assistant: Hate to be the one to post it, but a nasty solution is the system function - dare I speak its name.  Call it with code that you want executed in the command prompt and it will run.  If you want to start task manager like this, call it like this: 
system("C:\\Windows\\System32\\taskmgr.exe");
Fair warning that nobody really likes to see system in live code.
