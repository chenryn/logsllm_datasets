Abstract
Unsolicited calls are one of the most prominent security
issues facing individuals today. Despite wide-spread anec-
dotal discussion of the problem, many important questions
remain unanswered. In this paper, we present the ﬁrst large-
scale, longitudinal analysis of unsolicited calls to a honeypot
of up to 66,606 lines over 11 months. From call metadata we
characterize the long-term trends of unsolicited calls, develop
the ﬁrst techniques to measure voicemail spam, wangiri at-
tacks, and identify unexplained high-volume call incidences.
Additionally, we mechanically answer a subset of the call
attempts we receive to cluster related calls into operational
campaigns, allowing us to characterize how these campaigns
use telephone numbers. Critically, we ﬁnd no evidence that an-
swering unsolicited calls increases the amount of unsolicited
calls received, overturning popular wisdom. We also ﬁnd that
we can reliably isolate individual call campaigns, in the pro-
cess revealing the extent of two distinct Social Security scams
while empirically demonstrating the majority of campaigns
rarely reuse phone numbers. These analyses comprise power-
ful new tools and perspectives for researchers, investigators,
and a beleaguered public.
1 Introduction
The global telephone network serves more users than the In-
ternet, is designed with higher availability guarantees, and
is commonly relied upon for mission critical real time com-
munications, including 911 service and emergency notiﬁca-
tions [1, 2]. Despite its global importance, the phone net-
work faces a number of problems. Prime among them are
so-called “robocalls” — a catch-all term for automated or
semi-automated unsolicited calls, often for fraud or telemar-
keting purposes [3]. Much like spam threatened the useful-
ness of email, unsolicited phone calls threaten to make voice
calling unusable between two unknown parties. Moreover,
because of the historic trust users have placed in the phone
network, these scams surprisingly steal millions of dollars of
revenue each year [4, 5].
Despite the clear importance of the problem, much of what
is known about the unsolicited calling epidemic is anecdotal
in nature. Despite early work on the problem [6–10], the re-
search community still lacks techniques that enable rigorous
analysis of the scope of the problem and the factors that drive
it. There are several challenges that we seek to overcome.
First, we note that most measurements to date of unsolicited
volumes, trends, and motivations (e.g., sales, scams, etc.) have
been based on reports from end users. In addition to the poten-
tial for selection bias, this information is often non-speciﬁc,
unreliable, and/or incomplete. Second, most prior work on
the problem has relied on analysis merely of the claimed
number of the caller, neglecting to address the rampant (but
previously unmeasurable) problem of number spooﬁng. Third,
like modern cybercrime, robocalling is a commercial activ-
ity perpetrated at scale by professional operators [4, 5, 11].
Identifying the largest botnets and black markets has enabled
targeted takedowns that reduce overall abuse on the Internet.
Prior to this work, similar techniques for unsolicited calls have
been out of reach. Such techniques could inform measure-
ments, but also facilitate effective enforcement of the worst
actors, leading to a decline in unsolicited calls.
In this paper, we operate a telephone honeypot that receives
unsolicited calls over an 11-month period to up to 66,606 tele-
phone lines. Our key innovation is the combined analysis
of extensive and detailed call metadata with call audio. We
combine this with novel techniques to identify similar calls
efﬁciently allowing us to characterize whole campaigns of
operation and detect fraud and abuse. While our purpose in
this paper is to characterize a pernicious phenomenon, we
note that our measurement techniques can provide valuable,
actionable threat intelligence to carriers. In so doing, we pro-
vide a perspective on the problem that has been until now
unavailable to researchers, regulators, and even carriers.
We use this new perspective to deliver 24 ﬁndings address-
ing three pressing questions:
• How frequent are robocalls and is the problem getting
worse? We ﬁnd that our lines can expect to receive a

robocall once every 8.42 days. Surprisingly, we learn
that weekly call volumes are neither better nor worse
over the observation period. We also discover and char-
acterize rare “storms” of sudden unexplained bursts of
unsolicited calls, providing support that anecdotal reports
of high call volumes by individuals do occur.
• Is it even safe to answer the phone? Regulatory agencies
and the press regularly warn of the risks of answering
or returning calls from unknown callers. Shockingly, we
discover no evidence that answering unsolicited calls
increases daily call volume in a randomized single-blind
study. We also develop heuristics to detect and measure
wangiri call-fraud scams, ﬁnding no evidence of such a
scam in 35 days across 2,949 highly-called lines.
• Who is calling and how do they operate? We develop
and evaluate techniques to tightly cluster call audio to
associate individual calls into broader campaigns with
high precision. We then provide the ﬁrst estimates of the
number of operational campaigns and analyses of their
number spooﬁng and line rotation practices and identify
the top scam campaigns collected by our honeypot. All
of these scams target vulnerable populations, including
the elderly and recent immigrants, while operating over
long time scales with impunity.
2 Background
To understand why unsolicited calling is such a challenging
problem, we ﬁrst need to review how the modern phone net-
work operates. A call is said to “originate” at the caller’s
equipment, facilitated by the caller’s carrier. It is the job of
this carrier to “terminate” the call, which has the counter in-
tuitive meaning of “establishing the connection”, not ending
it. If the originating carrier provides service to the called
party, termination is straight forward. If however, the called
party is served by another network, the originating carrier
must route the call signalling and media through one or more
intermediate carriers to reach the terminating carrier.
Carriers terminate calls using signalling protocols. In the
PSTN1, the most common protocol is Signaling System No.
7 (SS7). In VoIP, the most common protocol is Session Ini-
tiation Protocol (SIP). Carriers interconnect by establishing
network gateways, which can operate over traditional PSTN
trunks (called “TDM” in the industry) or VoIP, and often
translate both signalling protocols (e. g., SS7 to SIP) and me-
dia encoding (e. g., PCM to Speex). It is important to note
that when customers purchase VoIP-based telephone service
from a provider, the customer does not actually place calls
on an end-to-end basis with the called party. Instead, when
the customer places a VoIP call, their local VoIP client soft-
ware, physical phone, or phone gateway terminates the call at
1Public Switched Telephone Network
a proxy maintained by the provider. This provider-controlled
proxy then routes the call to a peering partner’s proxy, which
forwards to another provider, and so on until the called party’s
provider receives the call and delivers it to the called party.
This state of affairs may seem surprising, but it is to prevent
abuse of the network. Further, carriers are not allowed to listen
to call audio of subscribers to protect their privacy. Instead,
the call recipient must make a complaint, or the carrier must
identify a malicious operator by call metadata. Carriers are
required by law to maintain records on all calls they originate
or route, but they are not required to make this information
public. As a result when fraud specialists identify a fraudulent
call, they must coordinate with every carrier in the entire call
path to identify the origin. This entirely manual process is
known as “traceback.” A single call traceback can take dozens
of hours to complete, making it largely infeasible.
Identity in the Phone Network
2.1
The principal identiﬁer in the phone network is the phone
number. While different countries and regions have different
formats, all are uniﬁed in the ITU E.164 general format for
numbers for unambiguous interpretation. Blocks of phone
numbers are assigned to carriers according to the North Amer-
ican Numbering Plan (NANP), which covers all of the United
States, Canada, and 23 other countries or territories. Carriers
then assign numbers to subscribers. A valid NANP number
has a country code (e.g. “1” for USA and Canada), three
digit Numbering Plan Area code (NPA), three digit Exchange
code (termed “NXX”) and a four digit line number. There
are ﬁne-grained restrictions on NPA, NXX and the line num-
bers which determine if a phone number is valid, assigned,
toll-free, or charges a premium rate when called.
The feature known as “caller ID” actually takes several
forms in the PSTN. The ﬁrst form, Calling Line Identiﬁcation
(CLI) includes the phone number of the calling party in the
signalling information to setup the call. The second form is a
15-digit alphanumeric string to identify the caller known as
Caller ID Name (CNAM). CNAM is not carried in the sig-
nalling of the call. Instead, the terminating provider performs
a lookup for the CNAM associated with a CLI by querying
an authoritative database in the telephone network.
Caller ID in SIP calls is more complicated. Identity info can
be carried in the “To:” and “From:” ﬁelds of an INVITE mes-
sage, the ﬁrst signalling message to set up a VoIP call. These
ﬁelds are populated by the SIP client controlled by the end cus-
tomer. Some providers optionally append an additional iden-
tity header called a “P-Asserted-Identity” header. This header
is meant to indicate a “true” identity to be used by the originat-
ing provider or its peers to traceback a source. Recently, a new
standard to authenticate phone calls, STIR/SHAKEN [12],
has been developed and is in the earliest stages of deployment.
In this protocol, originating providers append a signature to
the SIP header indicating that they indeed originated the call.

This is also intended to facilitate traceback of abusive calls to
their original source. When deployed, STIR/SHAKEN will be
the ﬁrst and only widely-used cryptographic authentication
mechanism anywhere in the telephone network.
Operations that make large amounts of unsolicited calls,
especially those doing so illegally, have a strong incentive
to obscure their source phone number. They may do this to
entice callers to answer, to avoid easy blocking based on caller
ID, and/or to frustrate attempts to prosecute callers. There are
a number of methods they can use to accomplish this. The
ﬁrst is to ask the terminating provider to block the caller ID
to prevent it from being delivered to the called party. In the
United States, callers can precede their call with the preﬁx
“*67” to do this. In practice, this provides little anonymity
because all carriers on the path see the true identity.
The second method is to purchase VoIP service from a
provider who does not check outbound “From” ﬁelds for cor-
rect values. Many providers allow arbitrary “From” ﬁelds as
a feature for customers who wish to present a main business
number (e.g., a customer support number) that may not be
owned by that provider. This is the most common form of
caller ID spooﬁng. A special form of caller ID spooﬁng aims
to match the caller’s ﬁrst six digits (NPA-NXX). This prac-
tice is termed “neighbor spooﬁng” as it is meant to entice
victims to answer a phone call believing it is a neighbor or
local organization (such as a school). The ﬁnal method is
to simply purchase a very large pool of phone numbers and
rotate through them, often keeping them for only a short time.
Operators have informed us this is an occasional practice by
mass unsolicited callers. We note that from our viewpoint
of measuring unsolicited phone calls, caller ID spooﬁng and
simply having a large, rapidly changing pool of numbers is
indistinguishable. As such, in this paper, we call the practice
of changing numbers frequently “line rotation” regardless of
mechanism.
2.2 Unsolicited Calls
Unsolicited calls may be known by many different terms, in-
cluding “robocalls”, “phone spam,” and “vishing”. Not all
unsolicited calls are illegal or undesirable. Examples include
public safety announcements for evacuations or school clo-
sures.
Most unsolicited calls are undesired yet may be legal. In
the United States, calls made by political campaigns are legal.
Some telemarketing calls are also legal, provided they are not
targeted at cell phones, the called party has not subscribed to
the FTC’s “Do Not Call” list, or the caller has given permis-
sion for the call. Not only do most individuals not care for
such calls, often these sales calls are for undesirable products
criticized by consumer advocates, like auto warranties.
A small fraction of unsolicited calls are illegal scams. These
scams may impersonate law enforcement or government agen-
cies for taxes or beneﬁts. They may also impersonate or fraud-
ulently claim to be representatives of respected brands, as in
tech support scams [13, 14] or fraudulent vacation sales [11].
Two categories of unsolicited calls are not intended to be
answered. The ﬁrst is voicemail spam. Rather than enticing
their targets to listen to a recorded message in realtime, voice-
mail spam “injects” the recording into the voicemailbox of
the target [3,15]. Spammers will place two simultaneous calls
to the target so that the second call ﬁnds the line busy and is
redirected to voicemail. When the second call is connected,
the ﬁrst is disconnected by the caller, often before it rings.
The second type of unanswered call is known as a “one-
ring” or “wangiri” scam, derived from a Japanese term which
translates to “One (ring) and cut”. In this scam, the perpetrator
ﬁrst obtains a premium rate number that bills all callers at a
high rate (e.g. ﬁve dollars per minute). The perpetrator then
calls a large number of victims indiscriminantly, hanging up
just after it starts to ring. These calls are effectively free for the
perpetrator because incomplete call attempts are not billable.
However, the victim sees a missed call, and many victims will
attempt to return the call, discovering they were billed only
after their phone bill arrives. This scam is especially effective
in North America if the premium rate number is obtained in
certain Caribbean countries that are part of the North Amer-
ican Numbering Plan, as those phone numbers appear to be
domestic and are not obviously charging a premium.
3 Data Collection
In this section, we explain the design principles of our honey-
pot, discuss the history of phone numbers used in our exper-
iments, describe our data collection methodology, highlight
ethical and legal considerations of our work and ﬁnally share
details about a secondary data set used in our study.
3.1 Designing a Telephony Honeypot
A honeypot owned by a researcher allows adversaries to in-
teract with a set of resources in an isolated environment. A
telephony honeypot collects information about the entities
that operate in the phone network. To collect such informa-
tion, we assign a set of phone numbers to a honeypot. These
