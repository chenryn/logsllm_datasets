The `all.bash` script currently runs with the `-short` flag, which limits the tests to those that complete quickly. However, this can sometimes miss issues that are only identified by longer, more comprehensive tests. For example, see issues #10455 and #8617, where non-short tests revealed problems that were not caught by the short test suite. These issues are typically discovered when a developer eventually runs the full test suite during development.

To improve our testing process, it would be beneficial to have a fast builder that runs the complete set of tests for each commit. This would help us catch potential issues earlier in the development cycle.
