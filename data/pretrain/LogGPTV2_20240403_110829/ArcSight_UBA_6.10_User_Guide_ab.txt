Example: Zero-day attack.
l Execute Stage: Stage in which attackers escalate access to execute the attack using admin 	privileges. Example: Escalating privileges or stealing admin credentials, lateral movement.l Exfiltration Stage: Stage in which the attackers can move freely around the network and access or remove any sensitive data at will. Example: An insider uploading customer information to a personal file sharing/storage site.
