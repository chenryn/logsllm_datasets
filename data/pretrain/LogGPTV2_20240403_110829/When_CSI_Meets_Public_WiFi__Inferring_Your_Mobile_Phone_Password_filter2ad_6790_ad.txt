minutes since CSI may change with the change of environ-
ment.
We start the evaluation by testing the classiﬁcation accu-
racy and the 6-digit password inference accuracy. Then we
investigate various metrics that may inﬂuence the inference
accuracy of WindTalker including the distance and the di-
rection. Afterwards we perform a more speciﬁc case study
by inferring the password of mobile payment for Alipay in
Section 6. In the current stage evaluation, we only perform
user speciﬁc training and will discuss it’s limitation in Sec-
tion 7.
5.2 Classiﬁcation Accuracy
In Section 3, we have shown that diﬀerent keystrokes may
be correlated with diﬀerent CSI waveforms. In this section,
we aim to explore whether the diﬀerences of keystroke wave-
forms are large enough to be used for recognizing diﬀerent
keys inputs in the real-world setting. We collected training
and testing data from 10 volunteers. Each volunteer ﬁrst
generates 10 loop samples, where a loop is deﬁned as the
CSI waveform for key number from 0 to 9 by pressing the
corresponding digit. After that, we evaluate the classiﬁca-
tion accuracy of WindTalker through the collected CSI data.
The classiﬁcation accuracy is evaluated in terms of cross val-
idation accuracy. In our problem setting, for every 10 loops
dataset, we pick up one loop in turn for the testing data and
choose the other 9 loops as the training dataset. WindTalker
adopts the classiﬁer introduced in Section 4.5 to recognize
the keystroke. We perform the evaluation on Samsung Note
5 , Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 and Nexus 5. These mobile are run
with Android 6.0.1, 5.0.2 and 6.0.1, respectively. When we
use all ten loops data, WindTalker achieves average accuracy
classiﬁcation of 81.8% in Xiaomi, 73.2% in Nexus and 64%
in Samsung. Fig.8 shows average classiﬁcation accuracy of
all 10 volunteers in 10 PIN number.
Fig.9 describes the color map of confusion matrix of Xi-
aomi. For a speciﬁc typed number, it gives the correspond-
ing inference results. The darker the area is, the higher the
possibility of keystroke inference result is. Intuitively, it is
easier for an input number that is confused with the neigh-
boring numbers during the keystroke inference process.
5.3 Password Inference
In a practical scenario setting, it may not be easy for
WindTalker to get 10 training samples for each PIN num-
ber. So in the remaining section, we only use 3 samples
per number for training. To illustrate the performance of
WindTalker for password Inference, in this part, we ask vol-
unteers to press 10 randomly generated 6-digit passwords

and use their corresponding 3 loops as training dataset. This
experiment is repeated in both Samsung and XiaoMi.
We test totally 200 set of passwords, which include 1200
keys. The inference results show that totally 852 keys were
recovered. As shown in Table.1, WindTalker can achieve an
average 1-digit recovery rate of 79.0% in XiaoMi and 63.0%
in SamSung. For a 6-digit password in AliPay, the attacker
can try several times to recover the password at an increased
successful rate. Thus, we introduce a new metric, recov-
ery rate with Top N candidates, which indicates the rate of
successfully recovering the password for trying N times and
represents a more reasonable metric to describe the capa-
bility of the attacker in the practical setting. As shown in
Table.1, if we evaluate the 1-digit recovery rate under top 2
and top 3 candidates, it is found that the recovery rate can
be signiﬁcantly improved.
We further study how many candidates can help us to
succeed in predicting the right 6-digit payment password in
WindTalker. In particular, we will investigate the inference
accuracy under top N candidates. In the experiment, each
6-digit password will be correlated with six CSI waveforms.
For each waveform, WindTalker calculates the probability
of matching the waveform with the predict key number.
The probability of a predicted password is deﬁned by the
product of the six probabilities. For a 6-digit password, we
can obtain 100000 predicted password, then sort these pass-
word by their probabilities in descending order. A success-
ful password inference is deﬁned as that the real password

(b) CSI Shape Change by Distance
Figure 11: Distance’s inﬂuence in WindTalker
is included in top N candidates. In Fig.10(a) ,we give the
password inference accuracy under top N candidates, where
N ranges from 1 to 20. The result is encouraging.
It is
shown that, given top 1 candidate, the inference accuracy is
only 20%. The inference rate can be signiﬁcantly improved
if given top 5 candidates or top 10 candidates, which corre-
spond to 38% and 42%, respectively. It is also shown in Fig.
10(b) that, if given enough top N candidates (e.g., set N as
85), the inference accuracy can reach almost 80%.
5.4
Impact of Distance and Direction
There are many factors potentially impacting the CSI.
Even clicking at the same key, the diﬀerent distance and
direction between AP and the mobile device may also lead
to a quite diﬀerent CSI. We will investigate the impact of
the distance and the direction on CSI in our experiments.
5.4.1 Distance
In a real scenario, the distance between victim’s mobile
device and AP is not ﬁxed. As shown in Fig.11(a), the
recovery rate of WindTalker will decrease along with the in-
crease of the distance. However, it is observed that, even
if the distance is enlarged to 1.6m, WindTalker can still
achieve 1-digit recovery rate 70% under top 3 candidates. It
demonstrates that WindTalker can work well even if the dis-
tance reaches 1.6m. This is because with WindTalker, the
attacker can enforce the smart phones to send WiFi signals
and AP to receive the WiFi signals. In this setting, though
the distance between the victim and receiver (AP) is en-
Figure 12: Accuracy in Diﬀerent Direction
larged, the distance between the WiFi sender (smart phone)
and the victim (ﬁngers) is relatively stable, which guaran-
tees key recognizing. Fig.12 shows that both CSI shape and
degree will change under diﬀerent distance. This indicates
that WindTalker needs to retrain dataset even for the same
victim with diﬀerent distances. To partially solve this limi-
tation, in practice, the attacker can ﬁx the location of table
and chairs, which will make the user’s position relatively
stable.
5.4.2 Direction
The relative direction between the victim and attacker
may seriously aﬀect the CSI since diﬀerent directions mean
diﬀerent multi-path propagation between the transmitter
and the receiver. Thus, we show the performance of WindTalker
under diﬀerent directions. Note that the mobile device is in
front of victim in experiments. It is important to point out
that, for a right-handed user, WindTalker shows a better
performance when the AP is on the left side of the victim.
This is because it is easier for WindTalker to sense victim’s
ﬁnger clicks and the hand motion. Fig.12 shows the recovery
accuracy of WindTalker in diﬀerent direction. It is interest-
ing that WindTalker can achieve a high performance even
the AP is deployed behind victims, which means that the
proposed CSI based keystroke inference can work well even
if the attacker is behind the user without visually seeing the
clicking actions. This represents one of signiﬁcant merits
which cannot be achieved by any previous work.
6. REAL-WORLD EXPERIMENT: MOBILE
PAYMENT PASSWORD INFERENCE TO-
WARDS ALIPAY
6.1 System Setup
To demonstrate the practicality of the WindTalker, we
perform an experimental evaluation of password inference on
Alipay, a popular mobile payment platform on Both of An-
droid and iOS system. Alipay is the largest mobile payments
company in the world and has 450 million monthly active
user including 270 million mobile payment users. As shown
in Fig.13, we deploy a WindTalker system at a cafeteria-like
environment and release an authentication-free WiFi. The
AP (including Intel 5300 NIC and the antennas) is set up
behind the counter, which makes it less likely to be detected
visually. The victim is 1 meter away from our deployed WiFi
devices. When we collect the data, one user walks pass by
the victim but none of users walks between the victim and
the AP.
To simulate the real-world attack scenarios, the recruited
