ABSTRACT
Privacy-centric mobile social network (PC-MSN), which allows
users to build intimate and private social circles, is an increasingly
popular type of online social networks (OSNs). Because of strict
usage policy enforced by PC-MSNs (such as restricted account
and content access), malicious accounts (or users) have to act like
normal accounts to accumulate credentials before committing mali-
cious activities. Therefore, analysis merely relying on static account
profile information or social graphs is ineffective to detect such
growing-up accounts. Besides, existing behavior-based malicious
account detection methods fail to effectively detect growing-up ac-
counts who pretend to be benign and have similar behaviors to
benign users during the growing-up stage.
In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of growing-
up behaviors of malicious accounts in WeChat, one of the major
PC-MSNs with billions of daily active users across the globe. Our
analysis reveals that the behavior patterns of growing-up accounts
are very similar to that of benign users, and yet quite different
from typical malicious accounts. Based on this observation, we
design Muses, a detection system that can automatically identify
subtle yet effective behaviors (features) to distinguish growing-up
accounts before they engage in obvious malicious campaigns. Muses
is unsupervised so that it can adapt to new malicious campaigns
even if the behavior patterns of malicious accounts are unknown a
priori. In particular, Muses addresses the limitations of the previ-
ous supervised techniques, i.e., requiring manually labeled training
sets, which is time-consuming and costly. We evaluate Muses on a
large-scale anonymized dataset from WeChat with roughly 440k
accounts. The experimental results show that Muses achieves 2x
recall, with similar precision, compared with the previous methods.
Specifically, Muses detects over 82% growing-up accounts with a
precision of 90% and achieves an AUC of 0.95. Notably, Muses can
also effectively detect growing-up accounts even if malicious users
applied various evasion strategies.

1 INTRODUCTION
Recently, a new trend of Online Social Networks (OSNs), namely
privacy-centric mobile social networks (PC-MSNs), has attracted
billions of users, such as LINE, KakaoTalk, and WeChat. PC-MSNs,
which allow users to build close and private social realms, are
tailored for the public’s growing concern of privacy. For instance,
in PC-MSNs, users have to know the exact ID information to search
other accounts. Presumably, the only form of stranger-interaction in
PC-MSNs is via public services where mutually-disconnected users
may comment on the same post without any direct interaction, or
connect using opt-in Location-Based Services, which is opted-out
by default.
As the number of users increases drastically and more services
are integrated into PC-MSNs, they are also haunted by malicious
users. These malicious users register many fake accounts, aiming to
conduct various malicious activities such as spreading spam, faking
online votes, etc. Some of them even conduct illegal activities like
financial fraud and online gambling, sapping the usability and le-
gality of PC-MSNs. Since an account potentially can only impact its
connected accounts or subscribed accounts in PC-MSNs, these mali-
cious accounts have to act like benign users to gradually build their
credentials after registration, i.e., they have to grow themselves
to be seemingly benign before committing malicious activities. In
particular, due to the privacy policy of the PC-MSN, a malicious
account typically needs to be disguised as a benign user for a period
of time to make connections (e.g., making friends and commenting
on posts) with other benign users, before he finally performs ma-
licious activities. Such behaviors are called growing-up behaviors,
and the period of performing such behaviors is called a growing-up
period. Such growing-up malicious accounts (for short, growing-up
accounts), especially those with large social spheres, can estab-
lish chronic threats to the PC-MSNs. Detecting these growing-up
accounts is, therefore, vital to the health of PC-MSNs.
Detecting malicious or fake accounts in typical OSNs has been ex-
tensively studied. A large number of works have been developed to
detect malicious accounts, e.g., by leveraging static information like
registration data or profiles [8, 11, 15, 19, 20, 22, 24, 30, 30, 34, 34],

social graphs [1, 3–5, 7, 9, 12–14, 14, 16, 17, 22, 23, 25–28, 31–
33, 35, 36, 38], and user behavior analysis [6, 29]. However, the
existence of growing-up accounts makes these previous detection
approaches ineffective since these growing-up behaviors are almost
the same as benign ones and the patterns of these behaviors cannot
be well identified by existing techniques (see Section 5). By per-
forming growing-up behaviors, these accounts can expand their
social groups, which allows them to conduct effective malicious
activities in PC-MSNs.
A natural solution is to design a supervised method to detect
growing-up behaviors. However, there are two key challenges when
a supervised method is applied in practice. First, the detection per-
formance of a supervised method could decay significantly over
time, while real-world PC-MSNs are dynamically changing and ma-
licious accounts also change their patterns periodically. To update
the supervised model, one needs to repeatedly label new malicious
accounts, which, however, involves huge labor costs and is im-
practical for large-scale PC-MSNs like WeChat. Second, malicious
accounts can easily generate a small number of fake behaviors to
evade a supervised method.
In this work, we propose to detect growing-up accounts in an un-
supervised fashion. Unsupervised methods do not involve manual
labeling and can be more robust to evasion attacks (see Appen-
dix A). However, designing unsupervised methods is much more
challenging, especially when we target the new type of growing-up
malicious accounts. Specifically, compared with traditional fake ac-
count detection, the key unique challenges of detecting growing-up
accounts come from two folds. First, since growing-up accounts
behave quite similarly to benign users during their growing-up
periods (see Section 3), it is hard to distinguish them based on their
behavior patterns1. Particularly, behavior patterns can be faked,
which allows growing-up accounts to evade traditional detection
methods. Second, traditional clustering-based approaches assume
certain similarities (e.g., EvilCohort [21] assumes a clustering of
IP addresses) among malicious campaigns. However, we observe
that such similarity is negligible among growing-up accounts. In
particular, growing-up accounts do not have enough behavioral
information for direct similarity computation.
To address the above challenges, we start with the first com-
prehensive study of the growing-up behaviors of malicious ac-
counts in PC-MSNs based on the analysis of over 440k accounts on
WeChat, one of the largest PC-MSNs across the globe with billions
of users. Our measurement study reveals that the behavior pat-
terns of growing-up accounts are different from typical malicious
accounts in multiple typical behavior domains, such as IP addresses
and action counts. Further, growing-up accounts and benign ac-
counts behave similarly and the differences are very subtle, which
makes existing behavior-based detection methods ineffective. Based
on these observations, we propose Muses, a novel unsupervised
learning approach that can effectively capture the subtle differences
between growing-up accounts and benign accounts and detect the
growing-up accounts in the growing-up stage before they engage
in obvious malicious campaigns.
1We consider both accounts’ behaviors and attributes (e.g., IP addresses) in this paper.
For ease of description, we use the term behavior to indicate both accounts’ behaviors
and attributes.
Muses works as follows. First, Muses considers IP addresses, client
versions, and actions as three key behavior domains, and builds
bipartite graphs between accounts and these behavior domains to
capture the correlation between accounts and behavior attributes.
Then, Muses adopts a random walk technique to convert the bi-
partite graph into a weighted graph of accounts to model the rela-
tionship between accounts in each behavior domain. Third, Muses
employs a community detection algorithm to cluster accounts in the
weighted graph into a set of communities, and designs a novel met-
ric to evaluate the maliciousness of each community. Finally, Muses
computes the malicious score for each node based on the score of
the community it belongs to and labels growing-up accounts based
on malicious scores.
We build a prototype for Muses and conduct experiments with an
anonymized dataset from WeChat, which contains the first-week
action records of nearly 440k accounts. The experimental results
show that Muses can effectively detect 82% growing-up accounts
with a precision of 90% and an AUC of 0.95. Moreover, we com-
pare Muses with three state-of-the-art techniques and observe that
Muses outperforms these techniques by non-trivial margins, e.g.,
Muses achieves 2x recall than these methods with similar precision.
Further, we evaluate the robustness of Muses under various evasion
strategies potentially adopted by the adversary and find that Muses
shows great robustness against evasion attacks, e.g., the AUC of
Muses slightly drops less than 1% even under combined evasion
strategies.
Our contributions can be summarized as follows:
• We are the first to systematically study the behavior of growing-
up accounts in PC-MSNs based on large-scale real-world data,
providing useful references for subsequent research in this area.
• We propose an unsupervised method Muses to detect growing-
up accounts. Muses captures the subtle behavioral differences in
three key domains between the growing-up accounts and benign
accounts and detects growing-up account groups in an unsuper-
vised fashion. Further, our approach can dynamically handle the
ever-changing malicious patterns adopted by the growing-up
malicious accounts.
• We evaluate Muses extensively on dataset collected from WeChat.
The experimental results demonstrate that (i) Muses excels in
detection capability compared with the state-of-the-arts and (ii)
Muses is robust against various evasion strategies potentially
adopted by the adversary.
2 BACKGROUND
In this section, we provide the essential background of PC-MSNs
and growing-up accounts.
2.1 PC-MSNs vs. Traditional OSNs
Unlike traditional OSNs, PC-MSNs are designed for users to main-
tain close social groups. In PC-MSNs, users can only interact with
friends in their social groups. Therefore, malicious accounts in PC-
MSNs need to build large social groups before performing effective
malicious activities. There are many popular PC-MSN platforms
such as WeChat, KakaoTalk, LINE, and Telegrams. We use WeChat
as an example to explain two major differences between PC-MSNs
and traditional OSNs.

ACSAC ’21, December 6–10, 2021, Virtual Event, USA
Restricted account access. WeChat restricts the channels for
users to be discovered. First, WeChat does not allow searching
other accounts by usernames (nicknames), nor will it recommend
users based on attributes such as geographic location and interest
preferences. Unlike other OSNs such as Facebook, WeChat users
need to know the exact WeChat ID or phone number to locate other
accounts. Strangers without knowing such information are unable
to build social connections with the account.
To connect with an account, one needs to send friending re-
quests to the account through specific channels. These channels
include clicking the name-card shared by the friends of the account,
scanning the account-bounded QR code, and directly adding the
account if the requester and the account happen to be in the same
chatroom. In addition, WeChat does build some public services to
allow certain interactions with strangers. For example, users can
use location-based discovery service (LBS) to find other users who
also use the service nearby; use the random message service to send
messages to or receive messages from any other users; use match-
ing service to connect with other strangers who simultaneously
trigger the matching action. However, these services are disabled
by default and require explicit opt-in by users.
Restricted content access. WeChat has stricter content sharing
restrictions than other OSNs such as Twitter and Facebook. Twitter
users can use the @ operation to share content with any other users,
regardless of whether they have following or followed relationships.
Facebook allows users to set their timeline to a public state so that
all the activities posted by the user can be viewed by everyone.
Besides, Facebook even allows strangers to post comments on other
users’ timelines. On WeChat, users typically can interact only with
others who are socially connected (i.e., they are friending with each
other) by posting news, commenting, sending private messages,
and sending group messages. The posts or comments can only be
viewed or commented on by friends (users may have fine-grained
control over which posts can be viewed by which friends). Users
can only send private messages to each other after establishing
friend relationships. A user can only be invited to join a chatroom
by his friend. These mechanisms ensure that a WeChat account can
only spread information within its social sphere.
2.2 Malicious Campaigns In PC-MSNs
Malicious accounts often use PC-MSNs as low-cost platforms to
spread spam and conduct online phishing. Nowadays, PC-MSNs
provide many services other than chatting, including online pay-
ment, online voting, public accounts, etc. These services gather
a large amount of wealth and sensitive user information, hence
attracting even more malicious users. We list the three most signifi-
cant malicious campaigns in PC-MSNs.
Click farm. PC-MSNs provide official account service, allowing
users to make a profit from producing eye-catching content (e.g.,
influencer marketing). On WeChat, the most prevalent malicious
campaign is Click Farm, which recruits a large number of malicious
(fake) accounts to perform various malicious activities (in a short
period), such as following the official accounts created by fake
accounts, promoting articles published by fake accounts, liking the
articles, sharing the articles, etc.
Spam. Spam is another popular attack in PC-MSNs. In this kind
of campaign, malicious accounts sneak into various chatrooms to
broadcast spam with a wide range of content, such as promoting
certain fake or biased news, spreading pornographic content, etc.
Phishing. Malicious accounts conduct phishing with eye-catching
