### Incident Descriptions and Analysis

1. **Malware Installation via Email Attachment:**
   - A malicious Trojan was downloaded as an Outlook attachment. The enclosed macro, when triggered by Excel, created a fake `java.exe`. This malicious `java.exe` then exploited a vulnerable server using SQL injection to start `cmd.exe`, which in turn created an information-stealing tool.

2. **Exploitation of Shellshock Vulnerability:**
   - An attacker used an Apache server to exploit the Shellshock vulnerability in Bash multiple times. In each round, the attacker executed several Linux commands and cleared the Bash history to erase traces of the attack.

3. **Backdoor Creation Using Netcat:**
   - The attacker downloaded the netcat utility and used it to open a backdoor. Through this backdoor, a port scanner was downloaded and executed.

4. **Student Cheating Incident:**
   - A student downloaded midterm scores from an Apache server, modified them, and uploaded the altered version.

5. **Illegal File Storage by Administrator:**
   - A server administrator created a directory under another user’s home directory and downloaded illegal files to that directory.

6. **Compilation of Malicious Source Files:**
   - Malicious source files were downloaded and compiled on the system.

7. **Data Exfiltration:**
   - An attacker stole user account information from the `passwd` file, compressed it using gzip, and transferred the data to a remote machine.

### Analysis and Discussion

**PRIOTRACKER vs. Baseline Tracker:**
- We ran both PRIOTRACKER and the baseline forward-tracker for one day on each case.
- The results are summarized in Table III. Critical events (CEs) indicate essential causal dependencies in an attack, excluding transitional events like `bash -> bash`.
- Rare CEs are those with a rareness score greater than our configured threshold (θ = 0.1).
- PRIOTRACKER captured all crucial attack causalities within the time limit, while the baseline tracker missed 62% and 40% of critical events in the "Cheating Student" and "passwd-gzip-scp" cases, respectively, due to its intensive computation of noisy dependencies.
- Most CEs are rare, justifying our choice to prioritize rare events in causality tracking.

**Noisy Environment Impact:**
- All attack cases were conducted in a normal, noisy enterprise environment, resulting in graphs up to 600 times larger than essential attack traces.
- Noisy activities linking malicious and benign traces are shown in Table II. These noises are interleaved with attack activities due to inherent program logic, globally shared logs, and central user interfaces accessing both malware and benign files.

### Conclusion
- PRIOTRACKER outperforms the baseline tracker in capturing critical events, especially in noisy environments.
- The analysis time and ordinal of events show that PRIOTRACKER is more efficient and effective in identifying and tracking critical attack paths.
