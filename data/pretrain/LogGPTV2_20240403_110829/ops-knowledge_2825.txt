Certainly! Here is a more polished and professional version of the text:

---

**Log Schema:**

- **Event Type:** QL
- **Description:** No sandbox token available for the request.
- **Request Identifier:** QLThumbnailRequest (e.g., `vmware-usbarb-25037.log`)
- **Expected Outcome:** The request will likely fail due to the missing sandbox token.

**Example Log Entry:**

```
[QL] No sandbox token for request <QLThumbnailRequest vmware-usbarb-25037.log>, it will probably fail.
```

**Generalized Log Entry:**

```
[QL] No sandbox token for request <QLThumbnailRequest vmware-usbarb-<*>.log>, it will probably fail.
```

This format clearly outlines the structure of the log entry, making it easier to understand and reference.
