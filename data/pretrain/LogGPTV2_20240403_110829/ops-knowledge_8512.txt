User: 你作为资深数据库管理员，帮助解答一些数据库故障诊断问题。请描述 string_matching 如何作为数据库性能问题的根因排查
Assistant: This function checks for certain conditions that may cause index columns to fail. These conditions include selecting columns using certain functions or regular expressions, and using the "order by random()" operation. If any of these conditions are detected, the function provides suggestions for how to rewrite the query to avoid index failure. If abnormal functions or regulations are detected, the function suggests avoiding using functions or expression operations on indexed columns or creating expression index for it. If the "order by random()" operation is detected, the function suggests confirming whether the scene requires this operation. If any of these conditions are detected, the function is a root cause of the index failure. Otherwise, it is not a root cause.
