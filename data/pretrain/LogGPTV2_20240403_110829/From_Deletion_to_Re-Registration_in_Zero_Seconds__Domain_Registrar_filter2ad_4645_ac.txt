### Domain Re-Registration Delay Analysis

#### Introduction
In our dataset, which includes 600,000 domains, we observed a distinct pattern in the re-registration delay. As detailed in Figure 5, the growth in re-registrations is rapid within the first 30 seconds but then levels off at a microscopic scale. Between 3 and 8 hours after deletion, there is a second period of relatively fast re-registration, adding another 1% of deleted domains. These effects are the aggregate of registrar and customer behavior, reflecting different re-registration strategies.

#### Registrar Behavior
Figure 6 illustrates the re-registration timing for a selection of registrar clusters during the first 24 hours after deletion. Drop-catch services, such as DropCatch, XZ, and Pheenix, tend to re-register the majority of their domains with very short delays. For instance, DropCatch, the most active re-registration cluster, re-registers 99.3% of its domains with a delay of 0 seconds (relative to all its domains re-registered within 24 hours of deletion). XZ and Pheenix also re-register a majority of their domains at 0 seconds, but they continue to add more re-registrations in the following seconds. For example, XZ's re-registration rate increases from 74.8% at 0 seconds to 89.4% at 3 seconds. This indicates that drop-catch services vary in their timeliness.

#### Delay Metric and Detection
Our delay metric allows for more precise detection of drop-catch re-registrations compared to previous approximations. If we consider only re-registrations with delays of 3 seconds or less as drop-catch, approximately 86.1% of deletion day re-registrations fall into this category. Labeling all domains re-registered on the deletion day as drop-catch, as done in prior work [10], results in a "false positive" misclassification of 13.9% of domains, as they are not re-registered during the most competitive part of the drop-catch race.

Another heuristic might be to label deletion day re-registrations as drop-catch only if they occur during a typical Drop period (e.g., 19:00:00–19:59:59 UTC). However, this approach is also problematic. Almost 9.5% of deletion day re-registrations are drop-catch re-registrations that happen after 8 PM due to the variable duration of the Drop, and would not be detected by this heuristic (false negatives). Additionally, 7.4% of deletion day re-registrations occur between 7 and 8 PM but are not drop-catch re-registrations because their re-registration delay exceeds 3 seconds (false positives). Even though these domains are re-registered during the Drop, they are not re-registered as early as possible, but at a time when the competitive re-registration race has moved on to other domains. This underscores the utility of our re-registration delay metric.

#### Diverse Re-Registration Strategies
Drop-catch services do not always re-register all their domains with short delays. For example, Pheenix shows a significant increase in re-registrations 30 to 90 minutes after domain deletion, likely corresponding to the horizontal line visible in Figure 4c. We cannot determine whether customers backordered these domains before the Drop, or if Pheenix postponed their registration; they could also be regular domain orders placed during or after the Drop. Dynadot exhibits some drop-catch activity, but the bulk of re-registrations occurs at longer time scales, suggesting they are initiated directly by customers. GoDaddy re-registers some domains in the seconds after deletion, but there is no significant drop-catch activity, with the majority of domains re-registered hours later. Xinnet follows a similar pattern, with very few re-registrations until 10 seconds after deletion. Figure 4e suggests that Xinnet may hold back re-registrations with longer delays until the end of the Drop, resembling characteristics of drop-catch services, albeit with a more modest outcome. Similarly, most re-registrations using 1API happen relatively early, with the median at 26 minutes, but they do not start until 30 seconds after deletion.

#### Market Share Analysis
The examples above illustrate different re-registration strategies for deleted domains. Drop-catch services are the first to re-register domains, with visible differences in timing and quantity among them. These differences are also reflected in pricing; for instance, backorders at Dynadot are priced lower than at DropCatch. "Home-grown" drop-catching through APIs follows seconds to minutes later, yielding domains not taken by the drop-catch services at the cost of regular domain registrations. Hours later, remaining domains may be re-registered in batches.

#### Delay Interval Analysis
To analyze how domains differ based on their re-registration delay, we grouped re-registration delays into intervals, each containing at least 8,000 domains. Some intervals contain many more domains, but we cannot subdivide them further due to the precision of the domain creation timestamps released by the registry. For each interval, we computed the market share of different types of domains.

Figure 7 shows the market share of a selection of registrar clusters in each interval. DropCatch and SnapNames dominate the 0-second interval but re-register a much smaller share of domains afterward, until 8 to 10 minutes after deletion, when DropCatch reaches another high market share. Xinnet reaches a high market share of 50% 1 to 9 hours after deletion. No single registrar consistently dominates re-registrations across different delays.

#### Domain Age and Malicious Activity
When considering the market share in terms of the age of the domains being re-registered (Figure 8), we observe that re-registrations of older domains peak at a delay of 0 seconds. A higher prior registration age may indicate a more valuable domain, as it may receive more traffic due to pre-existing inbound links [10, 13]. However, our data show that re-registrations of older domains also peak at 6 seconds, 1 hour, and between 13 to 14 hours after deletion. Similar effects, albeit at different intervals, were observed when comparing the number of keywords and English dictionary words in re-registered domain names. We hypothesize that these correspond to different actors registering lists of attractive domains that were not claimed by drop-catch services.

In May, we used Google’s Safe Browsing API to check for malicious behavior in re-registered domains. At that time, each domain had been re-registered for at least 9 weeks. We found that a majority of domains later labeled as malicious were registered by drop-catch services with a delay of 0 seconds. This may seem surprising given the higher cost, but Safe Browsing does not elucidate the origin of the maliciousness, nor can we infer the intent of the domain registration. It is common for domains to be parked after re-registration [13], and they may inadvertently display malicious advertising campaigns without necessarily being re-registered for that purpose.

In terms of market share, however, the situation is different. Only 0.4% of domains re-registered with a delay of 0 seconds are labeled as malicious. From 30 to 60 seconds after deletion, the percentage of malicious domains registered during those intervals reaches 2%, but it corresponds to only around 250 domains. Overall, fewer than 0.5% of domains re-registered within 24 hours of deletion are labeled as malicious. Therefore, these results should be seen as preliminary and warrant further investigation.

#### Conclusion
In this paper, we studied domain registrations during the Drop, when expired domains are deleted and can be re-registered for the first time. While we were not able to measure registration attempts made by drop-catch services, we characterized the final outcome of the race to re-registration. Leveraging our technique to infer the deletion time of domains during the Drop, we showed that most re-registrations happen at the earliest possible time. Instant re-registrations also tend to be the ones with the oldest domains and most keywords. We observed a range of re-registration behaviors, including the use of reseller APIs for "home-grown" drop-catching seconds to minutes after the Drop, and re-registration of deleted domains in large batches hours later. Based on the inferred deletion time, we proposed a precise metric to detect drop-catch re-registrations. Knowledge of when or how domains were registered may be useful in research into uses of domains.
