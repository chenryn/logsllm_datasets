delay (600 k domains in our dataset). As the detail in Figure 5 shows,
growth is fast for the first 30 s, but then flattens out at a microscopic
scale. Between 3 h and 8 h after deletion, there is a second relatively
fast period, adding re-registrations for another 1 % of deleted do-
mains. These effects are the aggregate of registrar and customer
behaviour, and correspond to different re-registration strategies.
Figure 6 shows when a selection of registrar clusters re-register
their domains during the first 24 h after deletion. Drop-catch ser-
vices tend to re-register the majority of their domains with very
short delays. DropCatch, the most active re-registration cluster,
re-registers 99.3 % of its domains with a delay of 0 s (relative to all
its domains re-registered within 24 h of deletion). XZ and Pheenix
also re-register a majority of their domains at 0 s, but they keep
adding more re-registrations during the following seconds. For ex-
ample, XZ goes from 74.8 % at 0 s to 89.4 % at 3 s. This illustrates that
drop-catch services are not equally timely in their re-registrations.
Our delay metric allows for a more precise detection of drop-
catch re-registrations than the approximation used in prior work.
If we consider as drop-catch re-registrations only delays of 3 s
or less, about 86.1 % of deletion day re-registrations fall into this
category. Consequently, labelling all domains re-registered on the
deletion day as drop-catch, as done in prior work [10], results in
“false positive” misclassification of 13.9 % of domains since they
are not re-registered during the most competitive part of the drop-
catch race. Another conceivable heuristic would be to label deletion
day re-registrations as drop-catch only when they are re-registered
during a typical Drop period (e.g., 19:00:00–19:59:59 UTC). However,
this approximation is also problematic. Almost 9.5 % of deletion
day re-registrations are drop-catch re-registrations that happen
after 8 pm due to the variable duration of the Drop, and would
not be detected by this heuristic (false negatives). Another 7.4 % of
deletion day re-registrations happen between 7 and 8 pm, but are
not drop-catch re-registrations because their re-registration delay
is larger than 3 s (false positives). Even though these domains are re-
registered while the Drop takes place, they are not re-registered as
early as possible, but at a time when the competitive re-registration
race has already moved on to domains further down in the deletion
order. This illustrates the utility of our re-registration delay metric.
Drop-catch services do not necessarily re-register all of their
domains with short delays. Pheenix has another steep increase in re-
registrations 30–90 min after domain deletion, likely corresponding
to the horizontal line visible in Figure 4c. We do not know whether
customers backordered these domains before the Drop and Pheenix
postponed their registration; they could also correspond to regular
domain orders placed during or after the Drop. Dynadot does exhibit
some drop-catch activity, but the bulk of re-registrations appears
at longer time scales, thus likely initiated directly by customers.
While GoDaddy re-registers some domains in the seconds after
deletion, there does not seem to be significant drop-catch activity,
and the vast majority of domains are re-registered hours later. Xin-
net follows a similar pattern at a scale of hours; however, very few
re-registrations occur until 10 s after deletion. Figure 4e suggests
that Xinnet may hold back re-registrations with longer delays until
the end of the Drop, which resembles characteristics of drop-catch
services, albeit with a more modest outcome. Similarly, most re-
registrations using 1API happen relatively early, with the median
at 26 min, but they do not start until 30 s after deletion.
The examples above illustrate different re-registration strategies
for deleted domains. Drop-catch services are the first to re-register
domains, and there are visible differences in timing and quantity
among them. To some extent, these differences are also reflected
in pricing; backorders at Dynadot, for instance, are priced lower
than at DropCatch. “Home-grown” drop-catching through APIs
follows seconds to minutes later, yielding domains not taken by
the drop-catch services at the cost of regular domain registrations.
Hours later, remaining domains may be re-registered in batches.
4.4 Delay Interval Analysis
Domains re-registered through different means (and at different
cost) suggest that domains may have different qualitative attributes
depending on their delay. To analyse how those domains differ
from each other, we group re-registration delays into intervals. We
choose the duration of these intervals such that each one contains at
least 8 k domains. Some intervals contain many more domains; we
cannot subdivide them further due to the precision of the domain
creation timestamps released by the registry. For each interval, we
then compute the market share of different types of domains.
Figure 7 shows the market share of a selection of registrar
clusters in each interval. DropCatch and SnapNames dominate
the 0 s interval, but re-register a much smaller share of domains
afterwards, until 8–10 min after deletion, when DropCatch reaches
another momentarily high market share. Xinnet reaches a high
market share of 50 % 1–9 h after deletion. No single registrar con-
sistently dominates re-registrations across different delays.

all deleted .com domains are re-registered instantly.
Figure 6: CDF of re-registration delays for registrar clusters, relative to 24 h after deletion (left: detail
of the first 60 s). Drop-catch services re-register with short delays (DropCatch, XZ, Pheenix), other
registrars peak hours later (GoDaddy, Xinnet), and some exhibit both behaviours (Dynadot, 1API).
Figure 7: Market share of registrar clusters during variable-length intervals comprising at least 8 k total
re-registrations (denoted by vertical lines). Two drop-catch services, DropCatch and SnapNames, domin-
ate the first second (left detail), whereas Xinnet holds over 50 % market share from 1–9 h after deletion.
Figure 8: Interval market share of the prior domain age
of re-registrations. Older domains peak early, at delays
of 0 s and 6–16 s, suggesting higher perceived value.
When we consider the market share in terms of the age of
the domains being re-registered (Figure 8), we observe that re-
registrations of older domains peak at delay 0 s. A higher prior
registration age may be an indicator for a more valuable domain, as
it may receive more traffic due to pre-existing inbound links [10, 13].
However, our data show that re-registrations of older domains peak
not only at the beginning, but also at 6 s, 1 h, and between 13–
14 h after deletion. We observed similar effects, albeit at different
intervals, when comparing the number of keywords and English
dictionary words contained in re-registered domain names. We hy-
pothesise that these correspond to different actors registering lists
of attractive domains that were not claimed by drop-catch services.
In the beginning of May, we looked up all re-registered domains
using Google’s Safe Browsing API as an indicator for malicious
behaviour. At that time, each domain had been re-registered for at
least 9 weeks. We find that a majority of domains later labelled as
malicious were registered by drop-catch services with a delay of 0 s.
This may seem surprising given the higher cost, but Safe Browsing
does not elucidate the origin of the maliciousness, nor can we infer
the intent of the domain registration. It is a common occurrence that
domains are parked after re-registration [13], and they may have
inadvertently displayed malicious advertising campaigns without
necessarily being re-registered for that purpose.
In terms of market share, however, the situation is different. Only
0.4 % of domains re-registered with a delay of 0 s are labelled as
malicious. From 30–60 s after deletion, the percentage of malicious
domains registered during those intervals reaches 2 %, but it cor-
responds to only around 250 domains. Overall, fewer than 0.5 % of
domains re-registered within 24 h of deletion are labelled as mali-
cious. Therefore, we caution that these results should be seen as
preliminary and to be further investigated in future work.
5 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we studied domain registrations during the Drop,
when expired domains are deleted and can be re-registered for
the first time. While we were not able to measure registration
attempts made by drop-catch services, we characterised the final
outcome of the race to re-registration. Leveraging our technique
to infer the deletion time of domains during the Drop, we showed
that most of the re-registrations happen at the earliest possible
time. Instant re-registrations also tend to be the ones with the
oldest domains and most keywords. We observed a range of re-
registration behaviours, including the use of reseller APIs for “home-
grown” drop-catching seconds to minutes after the Drop, and re-
registration of deleted domains in large batches hours later. Based
on the inferred deletion time, we proposed a precise metric to detect
drop-catch re-registrations. Knowledge of when or how domains
were registered may be useful in research into uses of domains.
