User: How to prevent DDoS attacks and prevent business from being affected?
Assistant: The following are some measures to prevent DDoS attacks: 1. Firewalls and intrusion detection systems: Using firewalls and intrusion detection systems can prevent a large amount of traffic from entering the network and reduce the extent of DDoS attacks. 2. Load balancing: Through the load balancer, traffic can be evenly distributed to multiple servers, so as to avoid a certain server from being subjected to excessive traffic pressure. 3. CDN: Using CDN can separate the traffic from the source site and distribute it to multiple cache servers to improve the response speed and reduce the pressure on the source site. 4. Edge bus: Use the edge bus to cache and filter requests to prevent malicious traffic from entering the system. 5. Network traffic analysis: By analyzing network traffic, DDoS attack traffic can be identified and separated to reduce the impact of the attack. 6. Limit IP connections: Set rules to limit IP connections to prevent a certain IP address from connecting to the server too much. 7. Cloud security service: Using cloud security service can provide a higher level of security protection and prevent more complex DDoS attacks. 8. Security emergency response: Establish a security emergency response mechanism to check and eliminate network security vulnerabilities in a timely manner to prevent attacks.
