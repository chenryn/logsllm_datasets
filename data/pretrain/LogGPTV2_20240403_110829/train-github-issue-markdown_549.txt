#### Challenge Name
Any challenge, **both beta and production**
#### Issue Description
The exact same code works in Chrome but not in Firefox. In Firefox, the output
just above the tests says that the tests were completed, but tests that had to
be run in the iframed phone-view never passes.
According to this message from the console, there's some problem with CSP
which prevents some tests from running properly.  
`Content Security Policy: Directive ‘frame-src’ has been deprecated. Please
use directive ‘child-src’ instead.`
According to This Stack Overflow-thread, the spec for CSP in iframes is
confusing at the moment.
I guess we either should use the, according to the SO-thread above, now
deprecated `child-src` _temporarily_ until Firefox implements the new spec
with `frame-src` again.
Alternatively, we drop firefox support temporarily and hope they fix this
soon.
@freeCodeCamp/moderators Any ideas on how to solve this?
