The full page is considered extra small in actual pixel size, so it uses the
xs styles for layout (col-xs-...).
This is a problem, in our case, we have a mobile view and a print view. The
print view cannot be the same as the mobile view and the layout gets blown
apart as a result.
My interim solution is
    @media print {
        [class*="col-sm-"] {
            float: left;
        }
    }
Please consider adding col-print-... classes or addressing this conflict in
some other way that allows extra small and print layouts.
