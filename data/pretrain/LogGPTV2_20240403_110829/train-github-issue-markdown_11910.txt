When edit markdown docs, if Toggle Soft Wrap is active, get no problem with
English input, it will auto change to new line. But if input Chinese, it can't
auto change to new line when reach right edge of editor, it will be longer
line than it can display.
I found it seems problem with number of characters. For example, Atom display
100 English characters in one line, it will display 100 characters of Chinese
in one line too. But one Chinese character will take twice room to display
than English character.So it should change to new line when characters reach
50.
Hope someone can fix it. --Ubuntu 64bit
