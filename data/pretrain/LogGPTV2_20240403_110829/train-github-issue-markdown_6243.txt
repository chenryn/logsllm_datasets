Certainly! Here's a more polished and professional version of your text:

Currently, to handle XML content, you need to execute the following code:
```php
CssSelector::disableHtmlExtension();
$xxx = $crawler->filter('response>tradeBase>total_fee')->text();
```

I propose that we enhance the `Crawler` class to automatically detect XML content. When XML is detected, the `filter` method should internally call `CssSelector::disableHtmlExtension()` to ensure proper handling of the XML structure.

This approach will simplify the code and make it more robust for handling different types of content.
