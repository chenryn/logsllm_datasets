User: Is Python generally slower on Windows vs. a *nix machine?  Python seems to blaze on my Mac OS X machine whereas it seems to run slower on my Window's Vista machine. The machines are similar in processing power and the vista machine has 1GBs more memory. 
I particularly notice this in Mercurial but I figure this may simply be how Mercurial is packaged on windows.
Assistant: Maybe the python has more depend on a lot of files open (import different modules).
Windows doesn't handle file open as efficiently as Linux.   
Or maybe Linux probably have more utilities depend on python and python scripts/modules are more likely to be buffered in the system cache.
