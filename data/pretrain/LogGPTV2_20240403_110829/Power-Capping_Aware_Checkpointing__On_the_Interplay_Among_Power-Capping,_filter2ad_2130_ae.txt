Fig. 7: Execution time and energy consumption under various checkpointing intervals. Legends at the bottom represent execution
time (Ttotal), and legends at the top represent energy consumption. “Sim” is simulation results, “First” represents ﬁrst order
model, and “High” denotes high order model. OCIs derived from prior models (i.e., α−
e ) are marked with a triangle
facing upwards and OCIs calculated from our model (i.e., α+
e ) are marked with a triangle facing the downwards.

mainly writes checkpoints to storage system. We simulate more
than 40 checkpointing intervals under each power cap.
We make several observations from the Fig. 7. First, we
ﬁnd that across various power caps, the power capping aware
model predicted OCI closely matches with the simulation
results corresponding to minimum execution time and energy
consumption. Second, the OCI predicted by previous models,
which do not take power capping effects into account, are
signiﬁcantly far from optimal OCI points. In most cases, this
results in more than 10% performance loss and additional
energy consumption. We also notice that the difference be-
tween the ﬁrst and high order model is not signiﬁcant in
the cases presented here. Finally, we also observe that the
power capping aware model results in signiﬁcant savings as
the power cap becomes smaller. For example, the performance
difference between power capping aware OCI model and high
order model increases from 8.8% to 17.2% when power cap
drops from 60 watts to 25 watts. This is primarily because the
new model captures the MTBF change due to power capping
better as the power cap drops.
Finding 6: Our model predicted OCI closely matches
the minimal execution time and energy consumption achieved
by the simulation runs. The power capping aware model results
in signiﬁcant performance and energy savings compared to
previous models. Also, these savings increase signiﬁcantly as
the power cap gets tighter.
Next, we show that our model is validated for an exascale-
like system as well. Fig. 8 shows that the model closely follows
the simulation and power capping aware model predicts OCI
accurately. Interestingly, the improvements in performance and
energy due to new model is higher compared to the petascale
system. This is because at exascale the MTBF becomes smaller
and hence, previous models take checkpoint more frequently
and incur very high I/O overhead. However, the power capping
aware model adjusts the OCI taking both the system scale and
power capping into account. It estimates the OCI to be a bit
higher and hence, results in signiﬁcantly less I/O overhead.
As a key summary, Fig. 9(a) shows that applying our power
capping aware OCI model can reduce the total execution time
and energy consumption, compared to prior OCI models at
both peta- and exa-scale. We observe that for a petascale
system execution time can be improved between 8.8% to
17.2% using the high order power capping aware OCI model.
This effect is even more pronounced for exascale system where
execution time can be improved between 49.4% to 52.9%
using the high order power capping aware OCI model. Similar
savings can be observed for energy consumption as well when
applying power capping aware OCI model.
In Fig. 7 and 8, it can be noticed that the execution time and
energy curves shift upward when the power cap is reduced. To
illustrate and understand this trend better, we show Fig. 9(b)
where the execution time curve is plotted for a power cap of
50 watt, 40 watt, and 30 watt. α+
t are also marked
