## Abstract
The COPA authenticated encryption mode has been proven to have a birthday-bound security on integrity, and its instantiation AES-COPA (v1/2) was claimed or conjectured to have full security against tag guessing. The Marble (v1.0/1.1/1.2) authenticated encryption algorithm was also claimed to have full security on authenticity. Both AES-COPA (v1) and Marble (v1.0) were submitted to the Competition for Authenticated Encryption: Security, Applicability, and Robustness (CAESAR) in 2014. Marble was revised twice (v1.1/1.2) in the first round of CAESAR, and AES-COPA (v1) was tweaked (v2) for the second round.

In this paper, we present collision-based almost universal forgery attacks on the basic cases of COPA, AES-COPA (v1/2), and Marble (v1.0/1.1/1.2). Our results show that the basic cases of COPA and AES-COPA have at most a birthday-bound security on tag guessing, while the basic case of Marble has at most a birthday-bound security on authenticity. Although our attacks do not violate the birthday-bound security proof on integrity for COPA and AES-COPA, they contradict the full security claim or conjecture on tag guessing for AES-COPA and the full security claim on authenticity for Marble. 

Designers should be cautious when claiming the security of advanced forms of security notions without providing corresponding proofs, especially after proving the security of the fundamental form. Earlier versions of this work appeared in the CAESAR forum [16, 17] and in IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive Report 2015/079 [18].

## 1. Introduction
In symmetric cryptography, an authenticated encryption algorithm transforms an arbitrary-length data stream (plaintext) into a ciphertext of the same length and generates an authentication tag, under the control of a secret key. This combines the functionalities of a symmetric cipher and a message authentication code (MAC), ensuring both data confidentiality and integrity/authenticity in one pass. For a detailed introduction to authenticated encryption and related security notions, see Bellare and Namprempre's work [6].

Existential and universal forgery attacks on MACs can be extended to authenticated encryption algorithms. An existential forgery attack aims to produce a valid ciphertext-tag pair not previously given, while a universal forgery attack produces a valid ciphertext-tag pair for any specified message. A universal forgery attack implies an existential forgery attack but is more severe and typically more complex. Dunkelman, Keller, and Shamir [9] introduced the concept of almost universal forgery attacks on MACs, which work for almost any specified message.

## 2. Main Contributions
In this paper, we cryptanalyze the basic cases of COPA, AES-COPA (v1/2), and Marble (v1.0/1.1/1.2) against almost universal forgery. Our main findings are:

- **Collision-based almost universal forgery attacks on COPA under variable associated data:** These attacks have a complexity near the birthday bound. When applied to AES-COPA (v1/2) in the nonce-respecting scenario, each attack requires slightly less than \(2^{63}\) encryption queries, with a memory of about \(2^{66}\) bytes, and a time complexity of about \(2^{62}\) memory accesses, achieving a success probability of about 6%.

- **(Multi-)collision-based almost universal forgery attack on COPA under constant or no associated data:** This attack uses a novel idea and, when applied to AES-COPA (v1/2) in the nonce-misuse scenario, requires about \(2^{124}\) encryption queries and a memory of \(2^{120.6}\) bytes, with a computational complexity of about \(2^{124}\) simple operations and a success probability of about 32%. While primarily of academic interest due to its high data complexity, an efficient birthday-bound attack suggested by an anonymous reviewer is also noted.

- **Collision-based almost universal forgery attacks on Marble (v1.0/1.2) under variable associated data:** Following Fuhr et al.'s attack [10] on Marble v1.1, each attack has a data/time/memory complexity of about \(2^{65}\). Since Fuhr et al. extended their attack to Marble v1.2 [11], we focus on a different forgery method for Marble v1.0/1.1 in this final version.

Table 1 summarizes the published and our main (almost) universal forgery attacks on COPA and Marble. Our attacks suggest that the full security claims and conjectures on tag guessing for AES-COPA and on authenticity for Marble are overestimated. Designers should be cautious when making such claims without rigorous proofs.

## 3. Conclusion
Our almost universal forgery attacks on COPA, AES-COPA, and Marble highlight the importance of thorough security analysis and cautious security claims. Future designs of authenticated encryption algorithms should consider these findings to ensure robust security guarantees.
