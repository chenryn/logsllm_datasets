User: Using Jenkins for automated build and deployment, how to avoid security vulnerabilities?
Assistant: Here are some best practices to avoid Jenkins security vulnerabilities: 1. Stay up-to-date: Make sure to use the latest Jenkins versions and plugins to mitigate the effects of known vulnerabilities. 2. Authentication and authorization: Add user authentication and authorization to ensure that only authorized users can access and modify Jenkins configuration. 3. External access control: Carefully control the public access point of the Jenkins server, such as disabling external unauthorized access and only allowing connections to secure networks. 4. Security plug-ins: Install some security-enhancing plug-ins, such as the Jenkins Static Analysis security vulnerability detection plug-in, to enhance security. 5. Before continuously integrating any source code, conduct internal security scans and cascading environmental security audits to ensure that external codes do not pose a threat to Jenkins and CI/CD pipelines. 6. Secure Execution: Independently run Jenkins and tools or scripts for build and deployment. Make sure you are not using a privileged user or with too high privileges when running the script, and that the integrated CD process is in sync with the normal flow of your code.
