third-party trackers in the order of decreasing activity in Fig. 3(a). In more detail,
for each third-party tracker t, let St be the set of websites in our dataset that are
tracked by t. On the x-axis, we order the trackers in decreasing order in terms

of the number of sites on which they appear: |Sti

We can see from Fig. 3(a) that:
– 46 % of the Alexa Top 10,000 websites have at least one tracker on them.
– The top 5 most common trackers cover 30 % of the top 10,000 sites.
– Google alone (doubleclick.com and google.com) covers 25 % of the sites. The
doubleclick.com domain is responsible for advertisements and google.com is
where other websites download widgets and libraries.

B. The majority of tracked sites are tracked by more than one tracker.
Equally interesting is the fact that a website that has third-party tracking is
likely to contain multiple trackers. In Fig. 3(b), we plot the CDF of the distribu-
tion of third-party trackers on the Alexa websites that have at least one tracker.
For example, we see in the plot that 28 % of websites have one tracker, which
means that there are at least two trackers present on each of the remaining
websites (72 %).
We also ﬁnd that 29 % of the websites that are tracked by at least ﬁve third-
party trackers. For a visitor that means that ﬁve diﬀerent entities become aware
of her web-surﬁng preferences. It is equally worrisome to see that some popular
websites such as latimes.com and washing-tonpost.com have upwards of 10 third-
party trackers.
The well-known Google Analytics is not on the list in Fig. 3(b), because
by contract, Google Analytics provides statistics only to the ﬁrst-party websites
and the cookies set by Google Analytics are always associated with the domains
of the ﬁrst-party websites and therefore are not third-party cookies. Furthermore,
the same user who visits diﬀerent websites monitored by Google Analytics will
likely receive diﬀerent IDs, which makes tracking him or her non-trivial.
C. Third-party interactions: 37 % tracking versus 63 % benign. Recall
from Sect. 4 that our dataset contains a total of 202,556 third-party HTTP
requests, which includes both third-party tracking and benign third-party inter-
actions. Using our approach, we identify 75,849 (37 %) of them as third-party
tracking interactions. This is of interest in considering counter-measures to third-
party tracking, since there is a large number of interactions with benign third-
party websites, as we discuss in the next section.
6 Possible Solutions Against Third-Party Trackers
Here, we discuss some potential solutions that can be implemented in a browser
fairly easily to block third-party trackers from collecting user information.
A. Blocking all third-party cookies. One can consider labeling as trackers
all third-party websites that exchange cookies with the user’s computer. On the
one hand, this type would allow a user to block 100 % of the trackers with a
false positive rate of 12.6 %. On the other hand, that comes at the expense of
the degraded browsing experience. There are websites that refuse to display their
content unless the user’s browser accepts third-party cookies. More speciﬁcally,
with third-party cookies disabled, iFrames, widely used in third-party games and
apps on social networks, cannot read their own cookies [10] and cannot work.
As we saw in Sect. 5, the majority (63 %) of requests to third-party websites is
benign. A complete blocking solution would have unnecessarily blocked them.
B. Removing/Anonymizing the referrer ﬁelds in HTTP requests. Apart
from the cookies that can uniquely identify users, the values of the referrer ﬁelds
of the HTTP requests are important to the third-party websites’ ability to par-
tially construct a user’s browsing history. Therefore, using TrackAdvisor to iden-
tify HTTP requests carrying identifying information and then either removing
TrackAdvisor: Taking Back Browsing Privacy from Third-Party Trackers
287
the referrer information or replacing it with bogus values is one way to protect
the user’s privacy. To the best of our knowledge, third-party websites have tried
to withhold content from the users only in the case where the browsers would
not accept the cookies and no eﬀorts at all have been invested in validating the
referrers as a condition to provide content.
Here we only provide suggestions for possible defense methods against third-
party trackers. The full evaluation of the two methods is, however, beyond the
scope of this paper and may be tackled in a future work.
7 Related Work
Although much attention has been devoted to studying the phenomenon of third-
party trackers using cookies to track users [14,16,18], there exists no practical
solution that leverages cookies as a means to detect third-party tracking. To the
best of our knowledge, all existing practical solutions such as AdBlock Plus [1],
Microsoft’s Tracking Protection Lists [7], Collusion [3], and Ghostery [5] rely on
corporate- and community-maintained black lists (sometimes called block lists)
to block HTTP requests to well-known third-party trackers. AdBlock Plus is
an improvement to the original AdBlock that also blocks third-party trackers
in addition to advertisements. Ghostery and TPL focus on blocking trackers
instead.
All other related work have been focused on uncovering other types of cookies
(aside from the standard HTTP ones) that could be used to track users but did
not propose countermeasures like we did. In [12,17], the authors documented
the use of Flash cookies, which are Locally Shared Objects similar to cookies.
Advertisers can create a pair of cookies, an HTTP one and a Flash one, with
identical content, where the latter can “re-spawn” the former even after the
former has been deleted. Fortunately, the practice of using Flash cookies have
been on the decline because there have been lawsuits against the advertisers,
who essentially re-spawned the HTTP cookies against the users’ will.
There is a form of cookie-less tracking, which is cache-based and utilizes
ETags [6,12]. An ETag, assigned by the website and unique for each user, is
associated with an object on a web page (like an image) that can tell the server
if the object in the browser cache is the same as the one on the server. An
advertiser then can have exactly the same objects on many websites and track
the users just like they would with cookies. This method is not popular, as users
can just clear the browser caches frequently.
Most modern browsers oﬀer a “Do Not Track” option which is nothing more
than a request and the websites can ignore it if they choose to. The most recent
high-proﬁle website that decided to not honor “Do Not Track” is Yahoo [11]. The
Electronic Frontier Foundation then responded by releasing Privacy Badger [8],
a browser add-on that detects third-party trackers. It keeps tracks of all cookies
as the user visits websites and blocks cookies that are previously seen. This is
a promising development, but, given that this was released only in May 2014,
there are no reports yet as to how well Privacy Badger works, if it degrades user
288
T.-C. Li et al.
experience, and how much overhead it may add in terms of memory due to the
large number of cookies that need to be tracked.
Finally, there exists a form of tracking using the ﬁngerprint [13] of the
browsers. This form of tracking relies on the information that the browser sends
to the remote website (such as IP address, User-Agent, System fonts, screen res-
olution etc.). The remote website then can use all of this information to uniquely
identify the browser that the request comes from. However, because the over-
head that incurs is very high for browser ﬁngerprinting, we would make the
argument that third-party trackers are unlikely to adopt it as a means to track
the browsing behaviors of users.
8 Conclusion
We present TrackAdvisor, a Machine Learning-based method designed to detect
third-party trackers and become the basis for protecting the users’ privacy
from third-party trackers. TrackAdvisor’s novelty is its focus on the interac-
tions between the browsers and the remote websites to detect when the user’s
browsing privacy is being leaked instead of relying on black lists. TrackAdvi-
sor exhibits high Precision (99.4) and Recall (100 %) in contrast with a Recall
of 72.2 % by Microsoft’s Tracking Protection Lists, which is a black list-based
component in the widely used Internet Explorer.
Towards protecting user privacy, we evaluate two potential countermeasures:
(a) removing user identity in tracker cookies and (b) removing the referrer infor-
mation from the HTTP requests sent to third-party trackers. We ﬁnd that the
second method achieves the goal of protecting user privacy while not “breaking”
the functionalities of the web pages.
Finally, we present a study on the pervasiveness of third-party trackers. Our
study shows that 46 % of the websites on Alexa’s Global Top 10,000 list contain
at least one tracker each and 25 % of the 10,000 are tracked by a single entity:
Google, as its doubleclick ad service is very popular and many websites use the
code libraries provided by Google itself to add functionalities.
