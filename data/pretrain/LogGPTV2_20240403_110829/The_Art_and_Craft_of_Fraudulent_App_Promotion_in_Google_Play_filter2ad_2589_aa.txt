ABSTRACT
Black Hat App Search Optimization (ASO) in the form of fake re-
views and sockpuppet accounts, is prevalent in peer-opinion sites,
e.g., app stores, with negative implications on the digital and real
lives of their users. To detect and (cid:27)lter fraud, a growing body of
research has provided insights into various aspects of fraud posting
activities, and made assumptions about the working procedures
of the fraudsters from online data. However, such assumptions of-
ten lack empirical evidence from the actual fraud perpetrators. To
address this problem, in this paper, we present results of both a
qualitative study with 18 ASO workers we recruited from 5 free-
lancing sites, concerning activities they performed on Google Play,
and a quantitative investigation with fraud-related data collected
from other 39 ASO workers.
We reveal (cid:27)ndings concerning various aspects of ASO worker ca-
pabilities and behaviors, including novel insights into their working
patterns, and supporting evidence for several existing assumptions.
Further, we found and report participant-revealed techniques to
bypass Google-imposed veri(cid:27)cations, concrete strategies to avoid
detection, and even strategies that leverage fraud detection to en-
hance fraud e(cid:28)cacy. We report a Google site vulnerability that
enabled us to infer the mobile device models used to post more
than 198 million reviews in Google Play, including 9,942 fake re-
views. We discuss the deeper implications of our (cid:27)ndings, including
their potential use to develop the next generation fraud detection
and prevention systems.

1 INTRODUCTION
Popular online services that provide millions of users with access to
products, news, social relationships and peer-opinions, are besieged
by fraudulent behaviors, that skew public opinion and bias product
reputation and popularity [25, 35, 45, 54, 75, 80, 91]. To reduce the
e(cid:29)ects of such behaviors, commercial peer-opinion sites employ
proprietary solutions to detect and (cid:27)lter fraud, e.g., [22, 30, 34, 47, 56,
65, 67, 71, 79, 98]. Similarly, a substantial body of academic research
has focused on the detection aspect of the fraud problem, and has
proposed and used assumptions about the behaviors and capabilities
of fraudsters, that are based on intuition, extracted from small
datasets of fraud, or revealed by collaborators within commercial
sites. While such previous e(cid:29)orts have revealed important insights
into the operations of fraudsters, most have not been validated with
empirical feedback from the actual perpetrators.
In an e(cid:29)ort to address this limitation, we (cid:27)rst performed a struc-
tured interview study comprised of 118 questions, with 18 Black
Hat App Search Optimization (ASO) workers that we recruited
Session 10D: Mobile SecurityCCS ’19, November 11–15, 2019, London, United Kingdom2437from 5 freelancing sites, concerning fraud that they post on Google
Play. Second, we performed a quantitative investigation with data
that we collected from 39 other ASO workers recruited from the
same sites. The data includes 1,164 Google Play accounts that the
39 ASO workers revealed to control, and 21,767 fake reviews posted
from these accounts for 6,362 unique apps. Further, we identi(cid:27)ed,
and report a Google site bug that enabled us to infer the mobile
device models used to post 198,466,139 reviews for the 6,362 apps.
Based on the (cid:27)ndings of our studies, we present the fraud work-
(cid:30)ow map of Figure 1, showing newly identi(cid:27)ed and previously ex-
plored fraud capabilities, behaviors and detection avoidance strate-
gies. Speci(cid:27)cally, we report multiple, novel insights into the working
patterns of ASO workers, including that they (1) pool in physical,
brick-and-mortar o(cid:28)ces, friends-and-family organizations, and on-
line teams, (2) have either a well-articulated role and are salaried on
a regular basis, or are part of unstructured teams and share earnings,
(3) have access to many user accounts, of both sockpuppet (fake)
and organic (controlled by real users) types, (4) have access to large
and diverse stocks of low to high-end, and new to old mobile device
models, (5) (cid:30)exibly outsource work when their number of accounts
or device models are insu(cid:28)cient, and (6) implement interactive
work veri(cid:27)cations, and punish cheaters.
Further, our studies provide evidence that supports several obser-
vations and assumptions made by previous fraud detection work,
about, e.g., the emergence of organic fraud [50, 52, 101], the timing
of fraud [38, 53, 61, 63, 64, 96, 100], the fake review writing pro-
cess [38, 42, 51, 52, 60, 61, 63–65, 74, 76, 96, 97, 99] and the choice
of ratings [24, 51, 52, 63–65, 74, 93, 94].
However, we also report and validate concrete, participant-revealed
behaviors that do not (cid:27)t the mold of assumptions made in previous
work, including lockstep behaviors [32, 48, 59, 77, 81, 86, 93, 94, 97,
100] or posting reviews in bursts [26, 28, 32, 36–38, 40, 42, 43, 51,
52, 59–61, 63, 65, 92, 95, 96, 100].
We also found and report participant-claimed techniques to by-
pass Google-imposed veri(cid:27)cations, e.g., user account validations
and review-posting sanity checks, and even strategies to leverage
Google’s fraud detection mechanisms to improve fraud e(cid:28)cacy,
e.g., downvoting negative reviews to trigger their removal, or using
singleton accounts that exploit detection cold-start problems.
Finally, and importantly, we identify several vulnerability points
in the fraud work(cid:30)ow, and propose defenses that exploit them. In
summary, we introduce the following contributions:
• ASO worker studies. Present empirical data from actual
ASO workers, to advance our understanding of their work,
through interviews and a quantitative analysis of gold stan-
dard fraud data [§ 4].
• ASO worker capabilities, behaviors and strategies. Re-
port new (cid:27)ndings on the capabilities and behaviors exhibited
by ASO workers [§ 5]. Provide evidence that supports several
observations and assumptions made by previous detection
work. Report and validate concrete strategies to avoid detec-
tion, including departures from existing assumptions. Build
a (cid:27)rst map of the Google Play fraud work(cid:30)ow.
• Google Play vulnerabilities. Identify and report a bug that
can be exploited to collect device model information from
reviews [§ 4.2]. Report Google Play veri(cid:27)cations claimed to
be ine(cid:29)ective by participants. [§ 5].
• Impacts. Identify vulnerability points in the fraud work(cid:30)ow
and discuss their potential to advance fraud detection and
prevention work [§ 6].
2 RELATED WORK
Social network fraud studies have focused on the identi(cid:27)cation of
fraud and its e(cid:29)ects on social network users. For instance, Thomas
et al. [83] identi(cid:27)ed 1.1 million accounts suspended by Twitter and
studied the behavior and lifetime of spam accounts, the campaigns
they execute, and the wide-spread abuse of legitimate web services.
Thomas et al. [85] have further investigated fraudulent Twitter
account markets to monitor prices, availability, and fraud perpe-
trated by 27 merchants over 10 months. Stringhini et al. [82] studied
Twitter follower markets by purchasing followers from di(cid:29)erent
merchants, and discovered patterns and detected market-controlled
accounts in the wild. Critical operational details of the fraud mar-
ket have remained however mostly unstudied. Our work seeks
to address this, by both documenting and validating operational
procedures of ASO workers who target Google Play.
De Cristofaro et al. [36] studied page “likes” from Facebook ads
performed by “like” farms using honeypot pages, and analyzed
them based on temporal, social and demographic characteristics of
the likers. McCoy et al. [62] studied the business model of “online
pharma”, using ground truth datasets of transaction logs. Further,
Springborn et al. [78] purchased fraudulent tra(cid:28)c for honeypot
websites and analyzed the underlying pay-per-view networks and
their delivery methods. In comparison, we conduct an interview
study to directly engage and seek insights from fraud perpetrators,
then support them through an analysis of empirical fraud data.
Bursztein et al. [31] observed that manually hijacked Google
accounts exhibited activity at a tight daily schedule, homogeneous
daily time table and similar tools and utilities used in parallel on
di(cid:29)erent victims from varying IPs. While none of our participants
claimed to use hijacked accounts or to have been the victim of such
attacks, some participants did claim and exhibit lockstep behaviors
in their use of accounts. We further note that our study is more
general, as it concerns the entire fraud work(cid:30)ow.
Other similar studies have di(cid:29)erent goals. To highlight the meth-
ods and prevalence of scammers, speci(cid:27)c to Nigeria, Park et al. [69]
collected three months of data using an automated system which
posts honeypot ads on Craigslist, and interacts with scammers.
Portno(cid:29) et al. [73] used NLP and ML-based methods to determine
post type, product and price on cybercriminal market o(cid:29)erings.
Further, Wang et al. [88] used empirical crawled data to identify
SEO campaigns and documented their impact on promoting search
results for several luxury brands. In contrast, in our fraud study,
we seek to also identify (1) Google Play vulnerabilities that fraud
workers found and exploit, (2) evolutions in fraudulent behaviors to
avoid detection, and (3) their intrinsic weaknesses, to be exploited
by the next generation fraud detection solutions.
3 BACKGROUND
We consider peer-opinion app markets, e.g., Google Play [9], who
host accounts for products, developers and users. Developers use
their accounts to upload apps and information about them. User
accounts enable users to establish an online identity, search for,
install and review apps. A review consists of a star rating (1–5)

account from which it was posted.
Search rank fraud and crowdsourcing. The search rank of apps
has signi(cid:27)cant impact on the returns made by their developers.
Thus, developers have incentives to maximize their app’s visibility.
In this paper we focus on developers who attempt to engineer the
search rank of their apps by hiring specialized, online Black Hat
ASO workers, to perform review and install count manipulation. De-
velopers and fraudsters connect through several sites, that include
general-purpose crowdsourcing sites [7, 19, 39], specialized fraud
sites [1, 2, 4, 16, 18], and social networks (e.g., Facebook groups).
Fraud detection and defenses. Online systems implement a suite
of fraud detection and defense mechanisms [66, 79, 98]. For Google
Play, such observable mechanisms include:
• Account validation. Request users to prove control of a
mobile phone, e.g., by providing its calling number, then
retrieving a code sent to it through SMS.
• Install-then-review. Users can review an app only if they
• Filter fake reviews. Detect and remove reviews suspected
• Close fraudulent accounts. Identify and close user and
developer accounts suspected of behaviors that violate the
site’s terms of service.

of being fake.
4 METHODS
Our study involves both a qualitative exploration of and a quantita-
tive investigation into various aspects of fraud production. In this
section we describe both studies.
4.1 Qualitative Study
The qualitative study of our work is comprised of in-depth in-
terviews with 18 ASO workers. We recruited participants from
several Facebook ASO groups, and also Upwork [19], Fiverr [39],
Zeerk [21], and Peopleperhour [14], all popular among ASO work-
ers. We identi(cid:27)ed 560 such workers, and invited them to participate
in our study through the 1-on-1 communication services of the
corresponding sites. We include the recruitment message in the
auxiliary document.
72 of them responded to our invitation. To select participants
who are actively involved in ASO jobs, we asked the responders,
3 questions, all for Google Play: (1) “how many accounts do you
control?”, (2) “for how long have you been actively doing ASO?”,
and (3) “on how many ASO jobs did you work, approximately?”.
