## Abstract
Black Hat App Search Optimization (ASO) through fake reviews and sockpuppet accounts is prevalent on peer-opinion sites like app stores, with significant negative implications for both digital and real-life users. To combat this, a growing body of research has provided insights into various aspects of fraudulent activities and made assumptions about the working procedures of fraudsters based on online data. However, these assumptions often lack empirical evidence from actual perpetrators. This paper addresses this gap by presenting results from a qualitative study involving 18 ASO workers recruited from five freelancing platforms, focusing on their activities on Google Play, and a quantitative investigation using data from 39 additional ASO workers.

We reveal findings concerning various aspects of ASO worker capabilities and behaviors, including novel insights into their working patterns and supporting evidence for several existing assumptions. Additionally, we report techniques used to bypass Google-imposed verifications, strategies to avoid detection, and even methods that leverage fraud detection to enhance fraudulent efficiency. We also identify a vulnerability in Google Play that allowed us to infer the mobile device models used to post over 198 million reviews, including 9,942 fake reviews. Our findings have broader implications, including their potential use in developing next-generation fraud detection and prevention systems.

## Introduction
Popular online services that provide millions of users with access to products, news, social relationships, and peer opinions are frequently targeted by fraudulent behaviors that skew public opinion and bias product reputation and popularity. To mitigate these effects, commercial peer-opinion sites employ proprietary solutions to detect and filter fraud. Similarly, academic research has focused on detecting such fraud, making assumptions about the behaviors and capabilities of fraudsters based on intuition, small datasets, or information from collaborators within commercial sites. While these efforts have provided valuable insights, they often lack empirical validation from actual perpetrators.

To address this limitation, we conducted a structured interview study with 18 Black Hat ASO workers recruited from five freelancing sites, focusing on their fraudulent activities on Google Play. We also performed a quantitative analysis using data from 39 other ASO workers, which included 1,164 Google Play accounts and 21,767 fake reviews posted for 6,362 unique apps. Furthermore, we identified a Google site bug that allowed us to infer the mobile device models used to post 198,466,139 reviews for these apps.

Based on our findings, we present a fraud workflow map (Figure 1) that highlights newly identified and previously explored fraud capabilities, behaviors, and detection avoidance strategies. Specifically, we report multiple novel insights into the working patterns of ASO workers, including their organizational structures, roles, and access to user accounts and mobile devices. Our studies also provide evidence supporting several observations and assumptions made by previous fraud detection work, while identifying and validating new behaviors that do not fit existing assumptions.

Additionally, we report techniques used by participants to bypass Google-imposed verifications and even leverage Google’s fraud detection mechanisms to improve fraudulent efficiency. Finally, we identify several vulnerability points in the fraud workflow and propose defenses to exploit them. Our contributions include:

- **ASO Worker Studies:** Presenting empirical data from actual ASO workers to advance our understanding of their work through interviews and a quantitative analysis.
- **ASO Worker Capabilities, Behaviors, and Strategies:** Reporting new findings on the capabilities and behaviors exhibited by ASO workers, providing evidence that supports previous observations, and validating concrete strategies to avoid detection.
- **Google Play Vulnerabilities:** Identifying and reporting a bug that can be exploited to collect device model information from reviews and reporting Google Play verifications claimed to be ineffective by participants.
- **Impacts:** Identifying vulnerability points in the fraud workflow and discussing their potential to advance fraud detection and prevention work.

## Related Work
Social network fraud studies have primarily focused on identifying fraud and its effects on users. For example, Thomas et al. [83] identified 1.1 million suspended Twitter accounts and studied the behavior and lifetime of spam accounts, the campaigns they execute, and the widespread abuse of legitimate web services. Other studies have investigated fraudulent account markets, page "likes" from Facebook ads, and the business model of "online pharma." In comparison, our work seeks to document and validate the operational procedures of ASO workers targeting Google Play.

Other similar studies have different goals, such as highlighting the methods and prevalence of scammers in specific regions or using NLP and ML-based methods to determine post types and product offerings on cybercriminal markets. In contrast, our study aims to identify Google Play vulnerabilities, evolutions in fraudulent behaviors to avoid detection, and their intrinsic weaknesses to be exploited by the next generation of fraud detection solutions.

## Background
Peer-opinion app markets, such as Google Play, host accounts for products, developers, and users. Developers use their accounts to upload apps and related information, while user accounts enable users to establish an online identity, search for, install, and review apps. A review consists of a star rating (1-5), text, and the profile photo and name of the user account from which it was posted.

### Search Rank Fraud and Crowdsourcing
The search rank of apps significantly impacts the returns for developers, incentivizing them to maximize their app's visibility. Some developers hire specialized, online Black Hat ASO workers to manipulate review and install counts. These developers and fraudsters connect through general-purpose crowdsourcing sites, specialized fraud sites, and social networks like Facebook groups.

### Fraud Detection and Defenses
Online systems implement a suite of fraud detection and defense mechanisms. For Google Play, these include:
- **Account Validation:** Requesting users to prove control of a mobile phone by providing its calling number and retrieving a code sent via SMS.
- **Install-then-Review:** Allowing users to review an app only if they have installed it first.
- **Filter Fake Reviews:** Detecting and removing reviews suspected of being fake.
- **Close Fraudulent Accounts:** Identifying and closing user and developer accounts suspected of violating the site's terms of service.

## Methods
Our study involves both a qualitative exploration and a quantitative investigation into various aspects of fraud production.

### Qualitative Study
The qualitative study involved in-depth interviews with 18 ASO workers. We recruited participants from several Facebook ASO groups and popular freelancing platforms such as Upwork, Fiverr, Zeerk, and Peopleperhour. We identified 560 such workers and invited them to participate in our study through the 1-on-1 communication services of the corresponding sites. Of the 72 who responded, we selected participants actively involved in ASO jobs by asking them three questions: (1) "How many accounts do you control?", (2) "For how long have you been actively doing ASO?", and (3) "On how many ASO jobs did you work, approximately?"

This approach ensured that we gathered insights from experienced and active ASO workers, providing a robust foundation for our qualitative analysis.
