User: How to migrate a website to a new host and keep the DNS records unchanged?
Assistant: The steps to migrate the website to a new host and keep the DNS records unchanged are as follows: 1. Back up the original website data: Before migrating, you must first back up all the data of the original website, including databases, files, and configuration files. 2. Upload the data to the new host: upload the backup data to the new host, and build the website environment on the new host. 3. Configure the website: restore the backup database and files to the new host, and modify the configuration files of the website and other related information to ensure that the website can be accessed normally. 4. Test the website: Test whether the website can be accessed normally on the new host, and check if there are any errors. 5. Modify the DNS record: If the previous website had its own domain name, you need to modify the DNS record to the IP address of the new host. This step needs to be modified in the DNS management panel. 6. DNS takes effect: Wait for the DNS record to take effect, usually a few hours or a few days. 7. Cancel the service of the old host: After the website is accessed successfully, the service of the old host can be canceled to save costs.
