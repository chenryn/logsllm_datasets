User: I need to script my app (not a game) and I have a problem, choosing a script lang for this.
Lua looks fine (actually, it is ideal for my task), but it has problems with unicode strings, which will be used.
Also, I thought about Python, but I don't like It's syntax, and it's Dll is too big for me ( about 2.5 Mib).
Python and other such langs have too much functions, battaries and modules which i do not need (e.g. I/O functions) - script just need to implement logic, all other will do my app.
So, I'd like to know is there a scripting lang, which satisfies this conditions:

unicode strings 
I can import C++ functions and then call them from
script
Can be embedded to app (no dll's) without any problems

Reinventing the wheel is not a good idea, so I don't want to develop my own lang.
Or there is a way to write unicode strings in Lua's source? Like in C++ L"Unicode string"
Assistant: Lua strings are encoding-agnostic. So, yes, you can write unicode strings in Lua scripts. If you need pattern matching, then the standard Lua string library does not support unicode classes. But plain substring search works.
