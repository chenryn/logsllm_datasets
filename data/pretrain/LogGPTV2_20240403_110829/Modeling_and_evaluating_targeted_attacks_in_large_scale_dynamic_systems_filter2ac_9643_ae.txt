### VIII. Modeling the Adversarial Strategy in the Overlay Network

The probabilities \( p(A_s) \) and \( p(A_p) \) represent the likelihood of the system being absorbed into safe and polluted states, respectively. Figure 4 illustrates these probabilities, showing that they are equiprobable. Specifically, we observe that \( p(A_s) = 0.57 \) and \( p(A_p) = 0.43 \).

In the absence of adversarial activity (\( \mu = 0 \)), the cluster remains safe until it splits or merges. This is demonstrated for protocol \( l \) with an initial size \( S_0 \) of the spare set. The probability to reach a merge-safe state is \( 1 - \frac{3}{7} = 0.57 \), and the probability to reach a split-safe state is \( 0.43 \). 

After a period of growth, the overlay network stabilizes. For larger values of \( d \), the probability of merging increases, confirming the results above: the population of peers in the cluster triggers more leave operations than join operations. However, even for very large values of both \( d \) and \( \mu \) (e.g., \( \mu = 30\% \)), the probability of the cluster remaining in a polluted state is very small (strictly less than 8%).

### Influence of Adversarial Activity on Cluster Probabilities

For a given initial configuration, the probability of a cluster splitting increases with \( \mu \). Specifically, for \( \alpha = 8 \), the probability of a safe cluster splitting is lower than the probability of a polluted cluster merging. Malicious peers stay longer in the cluster, leading to more merge events in a polluted state.

We consider the same protocol and analyze the impact of the adversary on the whole overlay network, which consists of \( n \) clusters. Each cluster is subject to join and leave events, and we assume these events are uniformly distributed throughout the overlay. When a join or leave event occurs, a specific cluster is chosen with probability \( \frac{1}{n} \).

Markov chains \( X^{(1)}, \ldots, X^{(n)} \) are defined, each with the same state space \( \mathcal{N} \), transition matrix \( M \), and initial distribution \( \alpha \). These chains are not independent, as only one chain can make a transition at each instant, chosen with probability \( \frac{1}{n} \).

Let \( N_n^{(S)}(m) \) and \( N_n^{(P)}(m) \) denote the number of Markov chains in the safe and polluted states, respectively, just after the \( m \)-th join or leave event. Formally, these random variables are defined for \( m \geq 0 \) by:
\[ N_n^{(S)}(m) = \sum_{h=1}^n \mathbb{I}_{\{X_h^{(m)} \in S\}} \]
\[ N_n^{(P)}(m) = \sum_{h=1}^n \mathbb{I}_{\{X_h^{(m)} \in P\}} \]

### Theoretical Results

It has been proven in [25] that the transient state probabilities of each Markov chain \( X^{(h)} \) at instant \( m \geq 0 \) are given by:
\[ P\{X_h^{(m)} = j\} = \binom{m-1}{j} \left( r \right)^{m-1-j} \left( 1-r \right)^j P\{X_1 = j\} \]

The expected proportion of safe and polluted clusters is very low even for large values of \( d \) (less than 2.2%). The expected proportion of safe clusters decreases with increasing \( d \), and the same holds for the expected proportion of polluted clusters, despite the different y-axis scales used in the figures.

This can be explained by the fact that real churn dominates the induced churn, represented by parameter \( \mu \). Although the Markov chains are dependent, each is chosen with probability \( \frac{1}{n} \), and the induced churn is almost independent.

### IX. Conclusion

The main lessons learned from this study are:
1. Shuffling is a better property than tolerance to Byzantine peers (protocol \( k \) with \( k > 1 \)). This is because when \( k = 1 \), the implementation is reduced to a single Byzantine algorithm, compared to two such runs for \( k > 1 \).
2. By choosing an adequate value of \( L \), the lifetime of peers, the system can be resilient against targeted attacks and reduce the overhead. It demonstrates that pushing peers smoothly in an hyper-activity system is sufficient to reduce the propagation of attacks.
