User: I'm just getting started on building a Python app for Google App Engine.  In the localhost environment (on a Mac)
I'm trying to send debug info to the GoogleAppEngineLauncher Log Console via logging.debug(), but it isn't showing up.  However, anything sent through, say, logging.info() or logging.error() does show up.  I've tried a logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG) before the logging.debug(), but to no avail.
What am I missing?
Assistant: On a Mac:
1) click Edit > Application Settings
2) then copy and paste the following line into the "Extra Flags:" field
--log_level=debug
3) click Update 
your debug logs will now show up in the Log Console
