Abstract 
Domain Controllers are the crown jewels of an 
organization. Once they fall, everything in the 
domain falls . Organizations go to great lengths to 
secure their domain controllers, however they 
often fail to properly secure the software used to 
manage these servers. 
This presentation will cover unconventional 
methods for gaining domain admin by abusing 
commonly used management software that 
organizations deploy and use.
