User:  Please describe how to create users and set permissions under Linux.
Assistant: The steps to create a user and set permissions under the Linux system are as follows: 1. Create a user: Use the command `useradd` to create a new user, for example: `useradd username`, where `username` is the name of the new user. 2. Set user password: Use the command `passwd` to set a password for a new user, for example: `passwd username`, and then enter the password twice. 3. Set user folder permissions: Use the command `chmod` to set the folder permissions of the new user to be readable, writable, and executable by the user and its group, for example: `chmod 750 /home/username`. 4. Set up user groups: Use the command `usermod` to add new users to the corresponding user groups, for example: `usermod -aG groupname username`, where `groupname` is the corresponding group name. 5. Set sudo permission: Use the command `visudo` to edit the `/etc/sudoers` file, and add new users to the `sudo` group, for example: `username ALL=(ALL) ALL`. 6. Set the ssh key (optional): If you need to connect to the user's account through ssh, you can use the command `ssh-keygen` on the local computer to generate a key pair, and add the public key to the new user's `~ /.ssh/authorized_keys` file. After the above steps, you can successfully create a user under the Linux system and set permissions.
