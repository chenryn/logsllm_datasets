### Managing Directory Access

#### Using Administrative Accounts
Administrative accounts can be used to perform tasks such as installing software on the Mac OS X computer you are configuring.

#### Specifying Administrator Privileges for Active Directory User Groups
To specify which groups of Active Directory user accounts have administrator privileges:
1. In Directory Access, click **Services**.
2. If the lock icon is locked, click it and enter the name and password of an administrator.
3. Select **Active Directory** in the list of services, then click **Configure**.
4. If the advanced options are hidden, click **Show Advanced Options**.
5. Select **"Allow administration by"** and enter the names of the groups. Use commas to separate group names. For security, group names must be qualified by the domain name (e.g., `ADS\Domain Admins, IL2\Domain Admins`).

#### Editing User Accounts and Other Records in Active Directory
You can use Workgroup Manager to make changes to user accounts, group accounts, computer accounts, and other records in an Active Directory domain. You can also delete records using Workgroup Manager. For detailed instructions, see the user management guide.

To create user accounts, group accounts, computer accounts, and other records in an Active Directory domain, use the Microsoft Active Directory administration tools on a Windows server.

#### Setting Up LDAP Access to Active Directory Domains
Using Directory Access, you can set up an LDAPv3 configuration to access an Active Directory domain on a Windows server. This configuration provides full control over mapping Mac OS X record types and attributes to Active Directory object classes, search bases, and attributes. Some mappings, such as the unique user ID (UID), require extending the Active Directory schema.

An LDAPv3 configuration does not include features provided by the Active Directory plug-in in Directory Access, such as dynamic generation of unique user IDs and primary group IDs, creation of local Mac OS X home directories, automatic mounting of Windows home directories, cached authentication credentials, discovery of all domains in an Active Directory forest, and support for Active Directory replication and failover. For more information, see "Learning About the Active Directory Plug-in" on page 101.

#### Creating an Active Directory Server Configuration
To create an Active Directory server configuration:
1. In Directory Access, click **Services**.
2. If the lock icon is locked, click it and enter the name and password of an administrator.
3. Select **LDAPv3** in the list of services, then click **Configure**.
4. If the list of server configurations is hidden, click **Show Options**.
5. Click **New** and enter a name for the configuration.
6. Press **Tab** and enter the Active Directory server’s DNS name or IP address.
7. Click the pop-up menu next to the DNS name or IP address and choose **Active Directory**.
8. Enter the search base for the Active Directory domain, then click **OK**.
9. Select the **SSL** checkbox if you want Open Directory to use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for connections with the Active Directory server.

The Active Directory mapping template for an LDAPv3 configuration maps some Mac OS X record types and attributes to object classes and attributes that are not part of a standard Active Directory schema. You can change these mappings or extend the Active Directory schema. Alternatively, you may be able to access your Active Directory domain via the Active Directory plug-in instead of LDAPv3.

If you want the computer to access the Active Directory domain for which you just created an LDAPv3 configuration, you must add the directory to a custom search policy in the Authentication or Contacts pane of Directory Access. You must also ensure that LDAPv3 is enabled in the Services pane. For instructions, see “Enabling or Disabling LDAP Directory Services” on page 85 and “Defining Custom Search Policies” on page 89.

#### Accessing an NIS Domain
Using Directory Access, you can create a configuration that specifies how Mac OS X accesses an NIS domain.

To create a configuration for accessing an NIS domain:
1. In Directory Access, click **Services**.
2. If the lock icon is locked, click it and enter the name and password of an administrator.
3. Select **BSD Flat File and NIS** in the list of services, then click **Configure**.
4. Enter the NIS domain name. Include the NIS server’s hostname or IP address if required for security or if the server is not on the same subnet as the computer you’re configuring.
5. Optionally, enter the DNS name or the IP address of the server or servers where the NIS domain resides.
6. Create a custom search policy that includes the NIS domain. In a custom search policy, the NIS domain is listed as `/BSD/domain`, where `domain` is what you entered in step 4. For instructions, see “Defining Custom Search Policies” on page 89.

#### Using BSD Configuration Files
Historically, UNIX computers have stored administrative data in configuration files such as `/etc/master.passwd`, `/etc/group`, and `/etc/hosts`. Mac OS X, based on a BSD version of UNIX, typically retrieves administrative data from directory domains.

In Mac OS X version 10.2 and later (including Mac OS X Server version 10.2 and later), Open Directory can retrieve administrative data from BSD configuration files. This capability allows organizations to use existing BSD configuration files on Mac OS X computers, either alone or in conjunction with other directory domains.

To use BSD configuration files:
1. Set up each BSD configuration file with the data required by Mac OS X directory services. See “Setting Up Data in BSD Configuration Files” on page 109 for instructions.
2. Create a custom search policy that includes the BSD configuration files domain. In a custom search policy, the BSD configuration files domain is listed as `/BSD/local`. For instructions, see “Defining Custom Search Policies” on page 89.

Mac OS X Server version 10.3 supports a fixed set of BSD configuration files. You cannot specify which configuration files to use, nor can you map their contents to Mac OS X record types and attributes.

#### Setting Up Data in BSD Configuration Files
If you want a Mac OS X computer to get administrative data from BSD configuration files, the data must exist in the files and must be in the format required by Mac OS X. You may need to add, modify, or reorganize data in the files. Workgroup Manager cannot make changes to data in BSD configuration files, so you must use a text editor or other tools. For detailed specifications, see Appendix A, “Mac OS X Directory Data.”

#### Accessing Legacy NetInfo Domains
Shared directory domains created with Mac OS X Server versions earlier than 10.3 used the NetInfo protocol (and optionally the LDAPv3 protocol). NetInfo can still be used to access these legacy NetInfo domains. This means:
- Any Mac OS X Server or other Mac OS X computer can access a shared NetInfo domain hosted by a server upgraded to Mac OS X Server version 10.3.
- Mac OS X Server version 10.3 and Mac OS X version 10.3 can access any existing shared NetInfo domain.

Note: You cannot create a new shared NetInfo domain with Mac OS X Server version 10.3 except by using command-line utilities. If you use Server Assistant or Server Admin to set up Mac OS X Server version 10.3 to be an Open Directory master, other computers can access this new shared directory only by using LDAP.

For instructions on setting up a Mac OS X Server or other Mac OS X computer to access a shared NetInfo domain, see “About NetInfo Binding” and “Configuring NetInfo Binding,” following this topic.

Expert system administrators can manage NetInfo domains by:
- Creating machine records for broadcast binding to an existing shared NetInfo domain. For instructions, see “Adding a Machine Record to a Parent NetInfo Domain” on page 111.
- Configuring a shared NetInfo domain to use a particular port number instead of a dynamically assigned port number. For instructions, see “Configuring Static Ports for Shared NetInfo Domains” on page 112.

#### About NetInfo Binding
When a Mac OS X computer starts up, it can bind its local directory domain to a shared NetInfo domain. The shared NetInfo domain can bind to another shared NetInfo domain, creating a hierarchy of NetInfo domains.

A NetInfo hierarchy has a branched structure. Local domains at the bottom of the hierarchy bind to shared domains, which can in turn bind to other shared domains, and so on. Each domain binds to only one shared domain, but a shared domain can have any number of domains bind to it. A shared domain is called a parent domain, and each domain that binds to it is a child domain. At the top of the hierarchy is one shared domain that doesn’t bind to another domain; this is the root domain.

A Mac OS X computer can bind to a shared NetInfo domain using any combination of three protocols: static, broadcast, or DHCP.
- With static binding, you specify the address and NetInfo tag of the shared NetInfo domain. This is most commonly used when the shared domain’s computer is not on the same IP subnet as the computer that needs to access it.
- With DHCP binding, a DHCP server automatically supplies the address and NetInfo tag of the shared NetInfo domain. To use DHCP binding, the DHCP server must be configured to supply a NetInfo parent’s address and tag.
- With broadcast binding, the computer locates a shared NetInfo domain by sending out an IP broadcast request. The computer hosting the shared domain responds with its address and tag.

For broadcast binding, both computers must be on the same IP subnet or on a network that is configured for IP broadcast forwarding. The parent domain must have the NetInfo tag “network” and a machine record for each computer that can bind to it with broadcast binding.

If you configure a computer to use multiple binding protocols and a parent is not located with one protocol, another one is used. The protocols are used in this order: static, DHCP, broadcast.

#### Configuring NetInfo Binding
Using Directory Access, you can configure Mac OS X or Mac OS X Server to bind to a parent NetInfo domain using the static, broadcast, or DHCP protocols in any combination. The computer attempts to bind to a parent NetInfo domain when it starts up.

Note: If your network has no shared NetInfo domain, setting a computer to bind to a parent NetInfo domain will cause delays when the computer starts up.

To bind a Mac OS X computer to a shared NetInfo domain:
1. In Directory Access, click **Services**.
2. If the lock icon is locked, click it and enter the name and password of an administrator.
3. Select **NetInfo** in the list of services, then click **Configure**.
4. Select the binding protocols that you want the computer to use.
   - For broadcast binding, select **"Attempt to connect using Broadcast protocol."**
   - For DHCP binding, select **"Attempt to connect using DHCP protocol."**
   - For static binding, select **"Attempt to connect to a specific NetInfo server."** Then enter the IP address of the parent domain’s computer in the **Server Address** field and the parent domain’s NetInfo tag in the **Server Tag** field.
5. Click **OK**, then click **Apply**.
6. Restart the computer.

#### Adding a Machine Record to a Parent NetInfo Domain
Mac OS X computers can bind their directory domains to a parent NetInfo domain using broadcast binding. The parent NetInfo domain must have a machine record for each Mac OS X computer that can bind to it with broadcast binding. You can create a machine record with the NetInfo Manager application.

To add a machine record to a parent NetInfo domain:
1. Open NetInfo Manager on the computer where the parent domain resides, then open the domain.
2. Click the lock and authenticate using the name and password of an administrator for the directory domain.
3. Select the **"machines"** directory in the Directory Browser list.
4. Choose **New Subdirectory** from the Directory menu.
5. Double-click **new_directory** in the lower list and enter the DNS name of the child computer.
6. Choose **New Property** from the Directory menu.
7. In the lower list, change **new_property** to **ip_address** and change **new_value** to the IP address of the child computer.
8. Choose **New Property** from the Directory menu.
9. Change **new_property** to **"serves"** and then change **new_value** to the name and NetInfo tag of the child’s local domain, using a **"/"** to separate the name and the tag. For example, change **new_value** to **marketing.demo/local** for the local domain of the computer named **marketing.demo**.
10. Choose **Save Changes** from the Domain menu, then click **Update This Copy**.

#### Configuring Static Ports for Shared NetInfo Domains
By default, Mac OS X dynamically selects a port in the range 600 through 1023 when it accesses a shared NetInfo domain. You can configure a shared domain for NetInfo access over specific ports using the NetInfo Manager application.

To configure specific ports for NetInfo access to shared domains:
1. Open NetInfo Manager on the computer where the shared domain resides, then open the domain.
2. Click the lock and authenticate using the name and password of an administrator for the directory domain.
3. Select the **"/"** directory in the Directory Browser list.
4. To change the value of an existing port property, double-click the value in the **Value(s)** column and make the change.
5. To delete a port property, select it and choose **Delete** from the Edit menu.
6. To add a property, choose **New Property** from the Directory menu and proceed as follows:
   - If you want to use one port for both TCP and UDP packets, double-click **new_property** and change it to **"port."** Then change **new_value** to the port number you want to use.
   - If you want separate TCP and UDP ports, double-click **new_property** and change it to **tcp_port.** Then change **new_value** to the TCP port number you want to use. Next, double-click **new_property** and change it to **udp_port.** This time, change **new_value** to the UDP port number you want to use.

#### Setting Up Directory Access on a Remote Server
You can use the Directory Access application on your computer to set up and manage how a server with Mac OS X Server accesses directory services and discovers network services. Your computer must have version 10.2 or later of Mac OS X or Mac OS X Server, and the remote server must have Mac OS X Server version 10.2.

To configure directory access on a remote server:
1. In Directory Access on your computer, choose **Connect** from the **Server** menu.
2. Enter the connection and authentication information for the server that you want to configure, then click **Connect**.
   - **Address:** Enter the DNS name or IP address of the server that you want to configure.
   - **User Name:** Enter the user name of an administrator on the server.
   - **Password:** Enter the password for the user name you entered.
3. Click the **Services**, **Authentication**, and **Contacts** tabs and change settings as needed. All the changes you make affect the remote server to which you connected.
4. When you finish configuring the remote server, choose **Disconnect** from the **Server** menu on your computer.

### Maintenance and Problem Solving

#### Monitoring Open Directory
You can view Open Directory status and logs, and inspect Open Directory authentication logs for suspicious activities.

##### Viewing Open Directory Status and Logs
You can use the Server Admin application to view status information and logs for Open Directory services. The following logs are available:
- Directory services server log
- Directory services error log
- Lookup log
- NetInfo log
- LDAP log
- Password service server log
- Password service error log

To see directory services status or logs:
1. Open Server Admin and select **Open Directory** for a server in the **Computers & Services** list.
2. Click **Overview** to see status information.
3. Click **Logs** and use the **Show** pop-up menu to choose the log you want to see.

##### Monitoring Open Directory Authentication
You can use the password service logs, visible using Server Admin, to monitor failed login attempts for suspicious activity.

Open Directory logs all failed authentication attempts, including IP addresses that generate them. Periodically review the logs to determine whether there are a large number of failed trials for the same password ID, indicating that someone might be generating login guesses.

To see Open Directory authentication logs:
1. Open Server Admin and select **Open Directory** for a server in the **Computers & Services** list.
2. Click **Logs** and choose a password service log from the **Show** pop-up menu.

#### Directly Viewing and Editing Directory Data
You can view or edit raw directory data by using the Inspector in Workgroup Manager. The Inspector allows you to see directory data not otherwise visible in Workgroup Manager or any other application. Furthermore, the Inspector allows you to edit directory data that you cannot otherwise change in Workgroup Manager or other applications. For example, you can use the Inspector to change a user’s short name.

##### Showing the Directory Inspector
You can make the Inspector visible in Workgroup Manager by selecting an option in Workgroup Manager Preferences. Then you can use the Inspector to view or edit raw directory data.

**Important:** Changing raw data in a directory can have unexpected and undesirable consequences. You could inadvertently incapacitate users or computers, or unintentionally authorize users to access more resources.

To make the Inspector visible:
1. Open Workgroup Manager and choose **Workgroup Manager > Preferences**.
2. Select **"Show ‘All Records’ tab and inspector"** and click **OK**.
3. Click the **Users** button, **Group** button, or **Computers** button (on the left), then click **Inspector** (on the right).

You can also click the **All Records** button, which is next to the **Computers** button, and choose a record type from the pop-up menu at the top of the list. The pop-up menu lists all standard record types that exist in the directory domain. You can also choose **Native** from the pop-up menu and type the name of a native record type into the box that appears below the pop-up menu. The list displays all records, including predefined records, of the currently chosen record type.

##### Hiding the Directory Inspector
If the Inspector is visible in Workgroup Manager, you can hide it by changing an option in Workgroup Manager Preferences.

To hide the Inspector:
1. Open Workgroup Manager and choose **Workgroup Manager > Preferences**.
2. Deselect **"Show ‘All Records’ tab and inspector"** and click **OK**.

##### Changing a User’s Short Name
You can use the Inspector in Workgroup Manager to change a user’s short name or short names, including a user’s first short name.

**Important:** Changing a user’s first short name can have unexpected and undesirable consequences. Other services use each user’s first short name as a unique and persistent identifier. For example, changing a user’s first short name does not rename the user’s home directory. The user has the same home directory (even though its name doesn’t match the user’s new first short name) unless the user happens to access their home directory through a group membership. Changing a user’s first short name effectively revokes all group memberships, because each group’s membership is stored as a list of members’ first short names.

To change the short name of a user account:
1. Open Workgroup Manager and make the Inspector visible if it is hidden.
2. Click the **Accounts** button, then click the **Users** button.
3. Open the directory domain that contains the user account whose short name you want to change, and authenticate as an administrator of the domain.
   - To open a directory domain, click the small globe icon above the list of users and choose from the pop-up menu.
4. Select the account whose short name you want to change, then click **Inspector** (on the right).
5. Locate **RecordName** in the list of attributes, and if a triangle appears next to **RecordName**, click the triangle to see all **RecordName** values.
   - The **RecordName** attribute stores the user’s short name or names.
6. Double-click the **RecordName** value that is the short name you want to change, then type another short name and press **Return**.
   - You can also click a **RecordName** value, and then click **Edit** to change the value in an editing sheet.
7. Click **Save**.
