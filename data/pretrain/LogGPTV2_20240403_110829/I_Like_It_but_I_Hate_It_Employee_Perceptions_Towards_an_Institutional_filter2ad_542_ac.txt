authentication on their phone. Thus, 26% of the participants do
not use any sort of security lock on their phone, even though they
are capable of doing so. A Kruskal-Wallis Test (one-way ANOVA
for nonparametric data) was run to determine whether or not a
participant using any form of security on their phone would impact
any of our outcome measures. It was found that phone security
did not interact with any of the outcome measures of perceived
usability, relative advantage, or compatibility.
As there are newer means of signing in to a phone beyond a
passcode, we also tested for alternative approaches. Independent of
using a passcode/pin or not, we found that 57.5% of the participants
utilized a fingerprint reader on their phone, 28.5% used the ability
to draw a pattern to unlock their phone, and 7.2% used form of
facial recognition available, meaning that 93.2% of the participants
had the ability to access their phones through other approaches
beyond a 4 or 6-digit pin. To determine whether or not varying
passcode compositions would influence our outcome measures,
we ran several Kruskal-Wallis Tests and found that there was no
interaction between varying measures of mobile phone security and
our outcome measures. That is to say, whether or not a phone was
secured with a pincode, pattern, or facial recognition, this did not
impact any perceived usability, relative advantage, or compatibility
for the DuoMobile app.
As an extension of our analysis of mobile phone practices, we
explored whether the participants had a wider range of other con-
nected devices, such as smartwatches, as this creates enhanced
interaction possibilities with the DuoMobile app. We recorded that
4.7% of the participants owned and used a smartwatch or related
device. Although the number of participants utilizing smartwatches
was small, we still conducted a Kruskal-Wallis Test to determine
whether or not using a smartwatch regularly would impact per-
ceived usability, relative advantage, or compatibility. No interac-
tions were found.
In addition to phone lock mechanisms, we also surveyed the
participants’ use of technologies on their phone. We found that 14%
of them ran some form of anti-virus software on their devices, while
11% utilized some form of anti-malware software. Despite these
relatively low figures for the prevalence of security software, 58.9%
of the participants self-reported to have a moderately secure, to very
secure mobile device. We also explored the app-related behaviors of
the participants to determine whether or not these behaviors might
have an impact on our usability results (as DuoMobile primarily
functions as a mobile app). Concerning app installations, we found
that only 30.5% of our participants regularly downloaded apps on
their smartphones. Not surprisingly, we then found that 29.1% of
our participants had a great deal of hesitation about installing apps
on their mobile devices.
4.2 Preconceived Security Notions
To determine the influence of any preconceived notions towards
2FA that could affect our usability measures, we recorded responses
on whether or not participants found 2FA technologies to be benefi-
cial, as well as whether they felt 2FA made personal and institutional
data more or less secure. We found that individuals were signif-
icantly more likely to claim that they understand the benefits of
2FA, even though they do not actually believe 2FA technologies
are beneficial (t(133)=7.77, p<.001). In other words, people claimed
that they know using 2FA technologies are useful, just not entirely
useful to them. In contrast, we found that our participants were
equally likely to believe that 2FA technologies would make their
personal data, as well as university data, more secure.
As the introduction of DuoMobile also coincided with a university-
wide shift to required 2FA for all internal systems, we also sought
to understand employees’ opinions on this topic. We found that 57%
of the participants believed this newer system to be inconvenient,
though we also note that 54.2% of the participants believed this was
something the university should be implementing, and requiring.
Similarly, we asked our participants to evaluate how secure they
thought the university would be if no form of second-factor authen-
tication would be in use. A combined 44% of the participants felt
that the university would be somewhat to very insecure, with 19.4%
feeling that the university would be very secure. The remaining
36.6% had moderate opinions on the subject. It does seem likely,
based on these results, that many participants understand the value
of having a second-factor authentication system, even if they might
find it inconvenient at times.
4.3 Comparative Usability, Relative Advantage
& Compatibility Results
We first conducted a reliability analysis on each scale item to ensure
our results were accurately measuring the desired effects. As shown
in Table 1, we found that each of our measures for the token-based,
second-factor authentication, as well as for the DuoMobile system,
were found to be reliable for analysis (i.e., values for Cronbach’s
Alpha are good or excellent).

Ease of Use*

Figure 1: Physical Token compared with DuoMobile. (*Indi-
cates significance)
To begin our investigation of the perceived usability between
the traditional token 2FA system and the DuoMobile system, we
conducted a comparative analysis of reported ease of use, relative
advantage, and compatibility. The results of this analysis are vi-
sualized in Figure 1. Perhaps surprisingly, we found that when
comparing the perceived ease of use between the physical token
and the DuoMobile system, participants consider the token eas-
ier to use (t(122)=2.03, p=.04). The same effect direction was also
observable for relative advantage between the two systems, but
not significant. In contrast, DuoMobile was perceived to be more
compatible than the token, that is, the DuoMobile app was found
to be more compatible with our participants’ authentication work
flows, but (again) not significantly.
To delve deeper into these somewhat unexpected results, we
analyzed whether or not time spent being enrolled within the Duo-
Mobile system had any impact on reported ease of use, relative
advantage, or compatibility, with the reasoning that those who
had been enrolled in DuoMobile for a shorter period of time could
perceive the system less favorably. However, it was found that time
spent using the DuoMobile system (i.e., our data includes users
who had enrolled in January 2015 through May of 2016) had no
significant impact on any of our measures.
Continuing with this thread, we also ran an analysis to deter-
mine the impact of whether participants enrolled in DuoMobile
before their department’s hard deadline, or whether they were
forced to enroll on that deadline day. The distribution of enrollment
times was normal. There was a statistically significant difference
between groups as determined by a one-way ANOVA for measures
of token ease of use (F(4,103)=2.362, p<.05), DuoMobile relative
advantage(F(4,122)=4.826, p<.001), and DuoMobile compatibility
(F(4,108)=3.776, p<.05). A Tukey’s post hoc analysis revealed that

participants who were forced to enroll on the date of a university-
based deadline rather than by choice before the deadline found the
token to be significantly easier to use (4.00 ± 1.06, p<.01). Similarly,
if forced to enroll in DuoMobile rather than by choice before the
deadline, participants found DuoMobile to have less of a relative
advantage over the token (2.53 ± 1.01, p<.001), as well as to be less
compatible with their workflows (2.46 ± 1.32, p<.05).
Scale Items

kens and the DuoMobile app. Items designated as 2FA token
can be interchanged for the DuoMobile app. Items denoted
with ’*’ indicate reverse scale items. The two reported values
for Cronbach’s Alpha are for the token (left), and the Duo-
Mobile app (right).
Beyond comparing the two systems directly, we also sought
to explore interactions between our previously measured depen-
dent variables and perceived ease of use, relative advantage, and
compatibility to determine what factors may play a role in impact-
ing perceptions regarding adoption of the new DuoMobile system.
To begin, we first conducted several analyses on the smartphone
usage features that we discussed earlier to determine if any inter-
actions existed to form the basis of a predictive model. By utilizing
responses from our mobile device usage data analysis, we ran a
multiple regression analysis to determine if any of our measured
mobile practices could predict ease of use for DuoMobile. Explic-
itly, we included phone password complexity, phone containing
(or not containing) fingerprint reader, facial recognition, or pattern
input, DuoMobile use prior to using it for work, and previous use
of another 2FA authenticator within our exploratory model. None
of these variables statistically signified predicted ease of use for
DuoMobile (F(8,78)=.990, p=.450, r2=.092). None of the variables
added statistical significance to the prediction.
We ran an identical analysis for relative advantage in using
DuoMobile, and found that a majority of these variables did not
statistically signify predicted relative advantage for using DuoMo-
bile (F(8,78)=1.450, p=.190, r2=.129). We did, however, find that a
phone having a fingerprint reader did add statistical significance to
the prediction (p<.05).
Finally, we ran a multiple regression analysis based on phone us-
age for compatibility. Many of the variables did not signify predicted
compatibility when using DuoMobile (F(8,78), p=.603, r2=.077). We
did find, however, that prior DuoMobile usage outside of work did
add statistical difference to the prediction (p<.05).
Beyond understanding the participants’ feelings towards the
newly implemented DuoMobile system, we also aimed to explore
if we could examine any preconceived notions of 2FA technologies
in general, which were normally distributed, and whether these no-
tions impacted favoritism between token-based 2FA systems or the
app-based DuoMobile system. To accomplish this, we ran several
MANOVAs comparing generalized 2FA measures with perceived
ease of use, relative advantage, and compatibility. The 2FA concepts
measured were: whether the participants felt 2FA technologies were
beneficial, whether participants understood potential benefits of
2FA, if they thought 2FA made their personal data more secure, and
if they thought 2FA made their work data more secure.
Through our results, we can first show that 2FA technology
being considered beneficial by individuals has a statistically signifi-
cant, positive effect on the token’s relative advantage (F(4,55)=3.281,
p=.01), as well as DuoMobile’s relative advantage (F(4,55)=3.878,
p<.01) and compatibility (F(4,55)=2.647, p<.05). We also found that,
for individuals who believe that 2FA keeps their personal data
more secure, there is a statistically significant, positive effect on
DuoMobile’s ease of use (F(4,55)=3.014, p=.02). Finally, we found
that for individuals who believe 2FA keeps their work data more
secure, there is a statistically significant, positive effect on the to-
ken’s perceived ease of use (F(4,55)=3.625, p=.01), relative advantage
(F(4,55)=3.254, p=.01), and compatibility (F(4,55)=3.863, p<.01). We
did not find any statistically significant interactions with the mea-
sure seeking to understand if participants felt they understood the
potential benefits of 2FA.
4.4 Security & Privacy Post Adoption Concerns
The transition from an institution-owned token device to a personally-
owned digital one is not only interesting in terms of usability, but
also for security and privacy considerations. To understand poten-
tially shifting concerns in this regard, we surveyed the participants
about concerns related to losing their token (or cellphone), as well as
any shifting perceived responsibilities about their part in securing
an institution. Figure 2 shows the varying concerns for institutional
and personal security in the event of a lost device.
As shown in Figure 2, we can observe that concerns caused by
any sort of lost second-factor authentication device is only moderate
on a 5-point scale (1 indicating No Concern, 5 indicating Very High
Concern). In addition, we can first show that when previously using
a token, concern for the security of the institution and for the self
were not statistically different, (t(132)=1.805, p=.07). However, when
using a cell phone, concern for personal security was significantly
different than concern for the security of the institution in the event
of a lost device (t(132)=-6.576, p<.001).
