Tried to get help from mailing list, but nobody responded. See
https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/symfony2/Ib7pMtVpV3Q for
text explanations
I wrote simple test controller + test case to check this issue and it's
failing.  
See biozshock/symfony-standard@`0bcd739`
Functionality was added at `1099858` but i think tests do not fully cover it.
Or maybe I'm doing something in a wrong way?
