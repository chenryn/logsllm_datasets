I attempted to seek assistance from the mailing list, but unfortunately, I did not receive any responses. You can find the details of my inquiry [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/symfony2/Ib7pMtVpV3Q).

To further investigate this issue, I created a simple test controller and a corresponding test case. However, the test is failing. The code for these tests can be found in the `biozshock/symfony-standard` repository at commit `0bcd739`.

The functionality in question was added in commit `1099858`, but I suspect that the existing tests may not fully cover all aspects of this new feature. Alternatively, it's possible that I may have implemented something incorrectly.

Could someone please review the provided code and offer some guidance?
