  * Electron version: 1.8.2
  * Operating system: macOS 10.13.3
### Expected behavior
It seems like you should be able to copy text in the devtools using Cmd-C
_regardless of whether or not the app itself has those keys assigned as menu
items_
### Actual behavior
Cmd-C does nothing (apparently you have to add menu items to get this to
work). My app as no need of Copy so those keys are not assigned and no menu is
added. The normal app keys do not affect the devtools, why should Cmd-C be any
different? In other words pressing Cmd-F in devtools will start a search even
though my app has no menu for Cmd-F. Similarly it seems like Cmd-C should copy
when devtools has the focus regardless of what my app is doing.
### How to reproduce
    git clone -b cmd-c-not-working https://github.com/greggman/electron-quick-start.git
    cd electron-quick-start
    npm install
    npm start
Then try to copy something in devtools by pressing Cmd-C. Nothing happens.
Notice that Cmd-F works even though there is no Cmd-F menu item and even
though the app is trapping all keypresses. The point being it seems like
Electron's devtools shouldn't rely on the App's setup for basic functionality.
That works in Chrome because a webpage can't change the App's menus but in
Electron arguably Electron's devtools should be checking for Cmd-C/Cmd-X/Cmd-V
in some other way, maybe the same way it's checking for Cmd-F.
