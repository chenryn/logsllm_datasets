ampliﬁcation factor: although it comes at the cost of an addi-
tional packet with some payload, the payoff is a doubling in
trafﬁc elicited from the middleboxes. Strangely, this modiﬁca-
tion only works for two segments: any further segmentation
causes two of the middleboxes to not respond, and the other
three only send a maximum of two block pages.
Although this optimization can improve the ampliﬁcation
from middleboxes with this behavior, 26 others (14%) are
unable to perform packet reassembly and stop responding
entirely. Worse, for the middleboxes that do perform reassem-
bly and still respond, segmenting the request across multiple
packets lowers the ampliﬁcation factor.
FIN+CWR Another modiﬁcation Geneva identiﬁed against
four (2%) middleboxes was to change the TCP ﬂags of the
PSH+ACK packet in the (cid:104)SYN; PSH+ACK(cid:105) sequence to FIN+CWR.
The CWR ﬂag—“Congestion Window Reduced”—is used for
TCP’s Explicit Congestion Notiﬁcation (ECN), and generally
should not be combined with a FIN ﬂag. The modiﬁed packet
sequence elicits 12 copies of the middleboxes’ block pages,
each sent 0.4 seconds apart. The block page duplication in-
creases the ampliﬁcation factor of these middleboxes to 301×.
If the CWR ﬂag is not present on the packet, no response is
sent. According to the injected block pages, these middle-
boxes appear to be instances of Fortinet Application Guard;
this modiﬁcation appears to only improve ampliﬁcation factor
for these middleboxes.
Shorter HTTP Geneva discovered an optimization against
one middlebox: cutting off the four bytes in the HTTP
GET request that immediately follow the forbidden URL
(\r\n\r\n). Although this slightly improves the ampliﬁca-
tion factor for one middlebox, none of the other 183 middle-
boxes responded. This suggests that it is important for the
HTTP GET request to be well-formed.
Failed Approaches We expected that changing the TCP
window in our packet sequences might have an impact on
ampliﬁcation. Recall that TCP window size determines how
much data the other endpoint can send before expecting an
acknowledgement. However, we found that none of the mid-
dleboxes respected this TCP feature. Similarly, though TCP
mandates that data sent should not exceed the maximum seg-
ment size (MSS) TCP option, every middlebox ignored this
option.

Internet Scanning Methodology
We perform ZMap [10] scans of the IPv4 Internet to measure
the effectiveness each of the attack packet sequences from §3.
Modiﬁcations to ZMap ZMap allows us to create arbitrary
probe packets with the “probe modules”; we wrote a custom
probe module for the packet sequences identiﬁed by Geneva.
ZMap does not natively have the ability to send multiple dis-
tinct packets in each probe (e.g., SYN followed by PSH+ACK),
so we modiﬁed ZMap to add this capability.
Selecting Forbidden URLs Quack’s dataset contains 1,052
URLs that triggered censorship. Ideally, we could perform full
Internet-wide scans for each URL and determine which ones
produce the highest ampliﬁcation. Unfortunately, this would
take over 6 weeks of scanning at full 1 Gbps line rate per
Geneva strategy, and would likely have diminishing returns.
Instead, we chose to estimate the smallest combination
of URLs that collectively elicit responses from the largest
number of IP addresses. To do this, we construct every set of

size 1 ≤ N ≤ 7 of the 1,052 URLs from the Quack dataset,
and for each set compute the number of Quack IP addresses
it would have triggered.
We ﬁnd the ideal set to be of size N = 5, each coinciden-
tally from a different website category as identiﬁed by the Cit-
izen Lab Block List [17]: www.youporn.com (pornography),
plus.google.com (social networking), www.bittorrent.com
(ﬁle sharing), www.roxypalace.com (online gambling), and
www.survive.org.uk (sexual health services). These ﬁve key-
words collectively elicit responses from 83% of the Quack IP
addresses, after which there are diminishing returns (adding a
sixth keyword only increased the response rate by 3.6%).
We acknowledge that the Quack dataset may not be rep-
resentative of the entire Internet. Moreover, coverage of IP
addresses is not necessarily the same as coverage of middle-
boxes; however, few IP addresses (4%) in the Quack dataset
share the same /24 preﬁx, so we expect little middlebox over-
lap. It is possible that other keywords will elicit broader cov-
erage or greater ampliﬁcation; we leave this to future work.
Data Collection From April 9th to April 26th, 2020, we
performed 5 sets of Internet scans, one for each mutually
exclusive packet conﬁguration (§3.3). For each set, we per-
formed 7 Internet-wide scans: one for each of the 5 domains
and our two control scans (“example.com”, and no payload
at all). To avoid saturating our link, we scanned at 350 Mbps;
and each scan took approximately 2–4 hours. After each scan,
we aggregated the number of bytes and packets we received
from each IP address that responded to our probes. Follow-
ing convention, we include the size of the Ethernet header in
the size of our probes and response packets when computing
ampliﬁcation factors.
5 Internet Scanning Results
This section presents the results of sending our attack packet
sequences from §3 to the entire IPv4 Internet. We make two
notes upfront that are important in understanding our results:
Responder variation Our packet sequences elicit a wide
range of behaviors. We broadly classify them in Figure 3;
Figure 4: Rank order plot of the ampliﬁcation factor received
from each IP address for the triggering payloads containing
www.youporn.com across all ﬁve packet sequences.
for some destinations and packet sequences, we get response
packets directly from destinations, from middleboxes (pre-
tending to be the destination), or some combination of the two.
We conﬁrm in §5.3 that over 82% of the largest responses we
receive come from middleboxes, but unfortunately it is difﬁ-
cult to perform this analysis for every destination IP address
we send to. Thus, for consistency (and because middlebox de-
aliasing is difﬁcult and error-prone), we report on the number
of destination IP addresses from which we can elicit responses
throughout this paper. We explore clustering and identifying
middleboxes by their responses in §5.4.
Inﬁnite ampliﬁcation We discover many IP addresses that
continue to respond, seemingly indeﬁnitely, to our probes. The
ampliﬁcation factors for these IP addresses are technically
inﬁnite, but we report the (ﬁnite) ampliﬁcation we obtained
during our scans. These tend to be orders of magnitude larger
than other hosts. We explore inﬁnite ampliﬁers in §6.
5.1 Which strategies work best?
We begin by measuring the impact that packet sequence and
keyword have on response rate and ampliﬁcation factor.
Figure 4 compares the ampliﬁcation factors for each of
the 5 packet sequences with the URL www.youporn.com.
We immediately observe that each of these strategies elic-
its responses from over 5M destination IP addresses with

ampliﬁcation greater than one. Moreover, we ﬁnd that all of
them elicit very large ampliﬁcation factors; for each packet
sequence, there are over 50,000 destination IP addresses that
yield over 100×.
To focus on the heaviest hitters, Table 2 compares the total
volume of trafﬁc generated from the top 100,000 IP addresses
for each scan, and Table 3 shows the number of IP addresses
with ampliﬁcation factor greater than 100×. (cid:104)SYN; PSH(cid:105) and
(cid:104)SYN; PSH+ACK(cid:105) get responses from the largest number of
unique IP addresses: 29× more than the SYN scan. Despite re-
quiring an additional packet, they also yield higher ampliﬁca-
tion factors for most of the top 1,000 IP addresses, and elicited
the highest total amount of trafﬁc across every URL. Sending
a SYN packet with a forbidden HTTP GET was surprisingly
effective at eliciting responses: for half of the URLs, it had the
most IP addresses with an ampliﬁcation factor greater than
100×.
The choice of URL has a strong impact on how well a given
packet sequence ampliﬁes. Figure 5 shows the ampliﬁcation
factors from using each of the keyword/strategy combination.
Overall, www.youporn.com was the most effective for
eliciting the most responses, with two notable exceptions.
First, www.bittorrent.com elicited double the number of
IP addresses with ampliﬁcation factor greater than 100×.
The source of this is highly amplifying censorship of two
networks with /16 preﬁxes: one run by the University of
Ghent; the other, the City of Jacksonville, Florida. Sec-
ond, roxypalace.com on SYN packets similarly elicited re-
sponses from more IP addresses than any other URL, and

this is largely due to triggering the border ﬁrewall at Brigham
Young University, which runs a /16 preﬁx.
Surprisingly, scans for the control keyword example.com
trigger many ampliﬁers. It under-performed every other key-
word in number of IP addresses and amount of data elicited,
but thousands of IP addresses still responded with 20× ampli-
ﬁcation. It is possible the middleboxes who respond to this do
so as a means of access control. Scans with an empty payload
