As i use the sharding-sphere in my old project . There is some sql segement
like  
insert into a (a,b) value(?,?) on duplicate key update a= ? , b = ? + b by use
the PreparedStatement  
then the sharding-sphere will ignore the last two question symbol , then will
cause the parameter 3 not found exception .  
As i go through the source code in version 3.0.1-SNAPSHOT and found there is
not any logic to handle the placeholder in 'on duplicate key update' , so just
support sql like insert into a (a,b) value(?,?) on duplicate key update a=
VALUES(a) , b = VALUES(b) .  
Does this feature will support sooner , or any consideration for the sql at
the beginning.  
As i have modified the code to support it .
