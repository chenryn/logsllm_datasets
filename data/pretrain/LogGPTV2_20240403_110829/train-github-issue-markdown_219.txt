If the output of this product is a matrix, should it not be a column vector
matrix rather than a row vector matrix?
    >>> matrix([[1, 2], [3, 4]]).dot(array([5, 6]))
    matrix([[17, 39]])
This seems like a bug, although I do not have extensive knowledge of the
behavior of `numpy.matrix` and this has probably already been discussed
extensively.
