User: When I double-click on pycharm.sh, Ubuntu lets me choose between "Run in Terminal" and "Run". What is the difference between these options?
Assistant: The question is already answered, Updating answer to add the PyCharm bin directory to $PATH var, so that pycharm editor can be opened from anywhere(path) in terminal.

Edit the bashrc file,

nano .bashrc

Add following line at the end of bashrc file

export PATH="<path-to-unpacked-pycharm-installation-directory>/bin:$PATH"

Now you can open pycharm from anywhere in terminal

pycharm.sh
