Something happens which causes the police to 
want to investigate you

Police are investigating something 
In order to stop you to investigate, police must 
have  
"reasonable articulable suspicion" that "criminal 
activity is afoot" - Terry v. Ohio

Permission  
Questioning Part 1 
Miranda Warnings 
 Right to Silence 
Right to an Attorney 
Miranda given when a person is "in custody" 
Miranda required if prosecutors later want to 
introduce what you say against you at trial 
Police are allowed to lie to you 
Questioning Part 2 
Once you have been appointed or retained 
counsel on a particular case, you have 
additional rights to have your attorney 
present whenever police question you or you 
appear in court on that case 
Arrest 
Police must have probable cause to arrest 
In general, a person can be arrested for any 
crime (possibly even a traffic violation) 
First Appearance / Arraignment  
You may have an initial appearance where the 
only thing done is setting bail or releasing 
you. 
In many states, you have a right to bail.  
Realistically, bail is always set except in 
extremely serious cases (i.e. murder). 
Bail 
Cash bail only 
vs. 
Bail bonds 
First Appearance / Arraignment 2  
At your arraignment, you will receive a list of 
the charges against you. 
You must have an attorney present to assist  
you at this point, or you will be appointed 
one. 
(sometimes bail setting will also be done at  
your arraignment) 
Charges 
Only the prosecutor (district attorney) gets to 
decide what you are charged with 
Double Jeopardy - you can only be placed in 
jeopardy (tried) once for a particular criminal 
act 
Lets Make a Deal 
Throughout this process, starting at the 
Arraignment, the prosecutor will likely offer a 
plea deal 
> 90% of all criminal cases in the US end in a 
plea deal 
Preliminary Hearing / Grand Jury 
State may choose which method to indict you: 
Preliminary Hearing 
vs.  
Grand Jury 
Attorney-Client Relationships 
Anything you say to your attorney is privileged - meaning it 
is secret - as long as there are not other people in the 
room not involved in your case 
Only you can waive the attorney-client relationship - not the 
attorney! 
Only time attorney can tell someone else without your 
permission is if there is a imminent threat of harm to 
another person 
Attorney's job is to advise you on the law, give you advice 
about what to do, and make strategic decisions 
Trial 
At trial, a jury must find you guilty beyond a 
reasonable doubt 
Representing yourself is a bad idea
