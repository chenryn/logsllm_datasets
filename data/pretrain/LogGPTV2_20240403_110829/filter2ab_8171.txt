### Title: Calculating Risk in the Era of Obscurity: Reading Between the Lines of Security Advisories

In today's complex cybersecurity landscape, compliance with industry standards and government regulations necessitates a robust servicing and patching strategy. However, beyond mere compliance, it is crucial to understand the risks associated with inadequate servicing. To aid in this effort, various standards exist to help assess risk. Unfortunately, these standards can be manipulated by vendors, leading to inaccuracies when enterprises attempt to gauge their true risk exposure.

Over time, vendors have increasingly obscured the language in their security advisories, making it difficult for network defenders to discern the actual risk posed by a product. This lack of clarity often leaves administrators to speculate about the severity of potential vulnerabilities. In some cases, vendors release patches that are nothing more than placebosâ€”patches that make no substantive code changes, thereby providing a false sense of security. Similarly, vendors may release incomplete patches that fail to fully mitigate the vulnerability, leaving the software in a vulnerable state even after the supposed fix. This not only doubles the cost of patching, as an additional patch is required to address the initial inadequacy, but also increases the risk of successful attacks.

Our conclusions are based on the disclosure of over 9,500 vulnerabilities over the past 17 years. This presentation will highlight systemic issues with security patches and how these problems negatively impact enterprise security. We propose methods to incentivize vendors to improve their servicing practices, including alternative disclosure timelines for failed patches. We encourage other vulnerability disclosers to adopt similar timelines and for customers to prioritize purchasing decisions based on how vendors manage and mitigate risks through their servicing practices.

By addressing these issues, we aim to foster a more transparent and secure environment for all stakeholders in the cybersecurity ecosystem.
