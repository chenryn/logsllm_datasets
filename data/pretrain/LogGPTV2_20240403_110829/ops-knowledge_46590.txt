User: In GAE (Python), using the webApp Framework, calling self.redirect('some_url') redirects the user to that URL via the GET method. Is it possible to do a (redirect) via the POST method with some parameters as well?
If possible, how?
Thanks!
Assistant: You can pass parameters. Here is an example:
Let's say you have a main page and you want to POST to '/success'. Usually, you may use this way:
self.redirect('/sucess')
But if you want to pass some parameters from the main page to /success page, like username for example, you can modify the code to this:
self.redirect('/sucess?username=' + username)
In this way, you successfully passed the username value into the URL. In /success page, you can read and store the value by using this:
username = self.request.get('username')
At last, you can make you favorite information onto the /success page by using this simple code:
self.response.out.write('You\'ve succeeded, ' + username + '!')
But, it's of course not a safe way to pass password. I wish it helps.
