I would like to do some custom operations when scanning for components which
has lead me to wish for some additional extension points the Spring Component
Scanning.
  1. It would be nice if there were some sort of way to manipulate each BeanDefinitions found in ClassPathBeanDefinitionScanner.doScan prior to them being registered. A simple protected callback method would be sufficient for my needs.
  2. Provide some way to specify a custom ClassPathBeanDefinitionScanner in ComponentScanBeanDefinitionParser so that in order to use my custom ClassPathBeanDefinitionScanner I won't have to completely re-implement ComponentScanBeanDefinitionParser.parse()
Thoughts?
Mike
