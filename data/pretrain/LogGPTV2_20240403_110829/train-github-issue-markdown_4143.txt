I am interested in performing some custom operations during the component scanning process, which has led me to consider the need for additional extension points in Spring's Component Scanning mechanism. Specifically, I propose two enhancements:

1. It would be beneficial to have a way to manipulate each `BeanDefinition` discovered by `ClassPathBeanDefinitionScanner.doScan()` before they are registered. A simple, protected callback method would suffice for my requirements.

2. Provide a mechanism to specify a custom `ClassPathBeanDefinitionScanner` within `ComponentScanBeanDefinitionParser`. This would allow me to use my customized `ClassPathBeanDefinitionScanner` without having to completely re-implement `ComponentScanBeanDefinitionParser.parse()`.

Your thoughts on these suggestions?
