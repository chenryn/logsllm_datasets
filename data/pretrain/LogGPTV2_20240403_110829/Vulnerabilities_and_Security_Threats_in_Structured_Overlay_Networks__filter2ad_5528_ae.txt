# Attack on ID Mapping Scheme

### Table 2: Attack on ID Mapping Scheme
| Data Item Replicas (ms) | 2048 | 4096 | 8192 |
|------------------------|------|------|------|
| Time (ms)              | 2.32 | 4.22 | 8.47 |
|                        | 16.08|      |      |
| EIDs Required          | 2112 | 4301 | 8157 |
|                        | 16421|      |      |
| Success Probability    | 0.80 | 0.76 | 0.76 |
|                        | 0.84 | 0.96 | 0.95 |
|                        |      | 0.97 | 0.99 |

The above table summarizes the number of external identifiers (EIDs) required for a successful attack on data items with varying numbers of replicas. The success probability increases as the number of EIDs required increases, closely matching the results from our analysis (Equation 7): 
- \( \mathbb{P}(\text{success}) = \frac{\log(1 - \frac{1}{N})}{\log(1 - \frac{1}{M})} \)
- \( \mathbb{P}(\text{success}) = \frac{\log(1 - \frac{1}{N})}{\log(1 - \frac{1}{M})} \)

### 5.2 Experimental Validation
We simulated the Chord lookup protocol [17] with varying numbers of good nodes. We selected 100 random data items to attack. Table 2 presents our observations on the number of EIDs required for a successful attack on these data items. Our experimental results closely align with the theoretical analysis (Equation 7).

### 5.3 Defense
The Sybil attack paper [5] suggests using trusted certification authorities to bind an identity to an entity (node). However, this approach requires every node to reveal its identity, which may discourage some nodes from joining the overlay network. To reduce certification costs and encourage participation, one could use weak secure identifiers, such as IP addresses, which can be easily challenged and verified.

Other approaches to mitigate this problem include:
- **Bootstrap Server**: When a new node joins the system, it contacts a publicly known and trusted bootstrap server to obtain an entry point. The bootstrap server assigns a random identifier and issues a short-lived certificate.
- **Security Checks**: The bootstrap server can implement weak security checks, such as detecting frequent attempts by a node from a single IP domain to join the system. This makes it difficult for a malicious node to spoof a large number of pseudo-identifiers over a short duration.

In conclusion, the overlay network can use weak secure IDs as long as spoofing a large number of pseudo-identifiers in a short time is very challenging.

### 6 Related Work
**Sit and Morris [16]** discuss several security considerations in distributed hash table (DHT) based overlay networks. They present a framework for security analysis and discuss various attacks, including routing table maintenance, network partitioning, and denial-of-service attacks. Their paper suggests repeated checking as a defense against routing attacks. Our work quantifies the lookup costs and shows that repeated checks alone are insufficient, especially without multiple independent lookup paths.

**Castro et al. [3]** address secure routing in DHT-based overlay networks. They suggest redundant routing to strengthen the routing scheme by sending queries through different routes. Our analysis on multiple near-optimal independent paths is applicable to redundant routing, improving the success probability and lowering the lookup cost.

**Sybil Attack [5]** highlights that entities can forge multiple identities for malicious purposes. The paper suggests using secure node IDs signed by well-known certifying agents. However, requiring every node to have a certificate is expensive and may discourage participation. Thus, this paper (Section 5) assesses the risks and threats when weak secure IDs are used in a DHT-based overlay network.

### 7 Conclusion
We have studied the vulnerabilities of the overlay network layer in DHT-based systems through targeted attacks and suggested possible defense mechanisms. Key properties determining the hardness of these attacks include multiple independent paths, alternate optimal paths, and the ability to detect and recover from invalid lookups. We have also analyzed the impact of the number of external identifiers owned by a node on the feasibility of attacks.

In conclusion, incorporating these security features in the overlay network layer will provide a secure infrastructure for building large-scale distributed and decentralized applications.
