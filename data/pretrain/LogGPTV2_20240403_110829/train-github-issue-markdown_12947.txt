A common pattern is converting keyword arguments into a `Dict` for easier
manipulation. On master this currently throws an error:
    julia> f(;kw...) = Dict(kw...)
    f (generic function with 1 method)
    julia> f(a=1)
    ERROR: ArgumentError: Dict(kv): kv needs to be an iterator of tuples or pairs
    Stacktrace:
     [1] Dict(::Int64) at ./dict.jl:147
     [2] #f#1 at ./REPL[1]:1 [inlined]
     [3] (::getfield(, Symbol("#kw##f")))(::NamedTuple{(:a,),Tuple{Int64}}, ::typeof(f)) at ./:0
     [4] top-level scope
I think a `depwarn` would be better. Especially for code that needs to work on
`v0.6` and master.
