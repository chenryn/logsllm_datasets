Abstract: Traditionally, business value networks have orchestrated human and technical resources that worked
together to form relationships and to add value to a product or service. The Internet and the Web have
extended traditional business networks by allowing also a web of different digital resources to work together
to create value. Additionally, the increasing adoption of service-oriented architectures has allowed the
creation of service ecosystems in which Web services are exposed and connected. The TEXO project
proposes to combine these two trends to create what is called Future Business Value Networks which enable
IT-supported value networks via service ecosystems. This paper addresses the main challenging issues that
need to be explored to provide an integrated technical infrastructure to support this emerging new type of
business networks.
