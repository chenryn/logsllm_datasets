**Abstract:**  
Traditionally, business value networks have orchestrated human and technical resources to form relationships and add value to products or services. The advent of the Internet and the Web has extended these networks by enabling a web of digital resources to collaborate and create value. Additionally, the increasing adoption of service-oriented architectures (SOA) has facilitated the creation of service ecosystems where web services are exposed and interconnected. The TEXO project aims to combine these trends to create Future Business Value Networks (FBVNs), which enable IT-supported value networks through service ecosystems. This paper addresses the key challenges in developing an integrated technical infrastructure to support this emerging type of business network.

### 1. Introduction

Future Business Value Networks (FBVNs) integrate and bridge two critical perspectives: business networks and IT infrastructures. 

#### Business Perspective
Organizations have historically sought new business models to gain a competitive advantage or tap into hidden markets. For example, IKEA introduced self-assembly furniture, eBay pioneered online auctions, and Dell bypassed traditional distribution channels to reduce costs. In all these cases, the new or adapted business models often arise from the perception that a different approach could be more effective. These innovations are driven by business needs and often stem from intuitive insights.

#### IT Perspective
The IT perspective encompasses the global standards, tools, applications, and architectures that support the business perspective. Currently, the service-oriented architecture (SOA) paradigm has gained widespread acceptance as a strategy for consolidating and repurposing applications to be combined with new applications in more dynamic environments. Services can interoperate, be composed into long-running business processes, and span intra- and inter-organizational boundaries.

### 2. The TEXO Project

The THESEUS program, funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research in Germany, focuses on developing and testing prototypes based on emerging technologies in six application scenarios. The goal is to find short-term ways to convert new technologies into innovative and commercially viable services for Internet-based networks.

TEXO, a part of the THESEUS program, aims to develop new business models for the Web. The infrastructure to be developed will be independent of any individual company and will provide a new generation of marketplaces for (Web) services. The TEXO use case includes identifying business models and technologies for the Internet of Services (IoS) research vision.

### 3. FBVN Requirements

To support the concept of FBVNs, several requirements need to be addressed:

- **Legal, Community Aspects, and Business Models:** The implications of FBVNs must be studied from a legal perspective, with a focus on integrating global regulations. New business models and incentive mechanisms for stakeholders (service providers, brokers, and consumers) need to be generated.
- **Service Innovation:** Efficient approaches for fostering innovation are required, derived from successful and unsuccessful discovery efforts made by service users, communities, or information sources on the Internet.
- **Service Governance:** Governance should ensure strategic alignment between business services and business requirements, reducing risks and ensuring compliance with rules and regulations.
- **Service Delivery Platform:** A scalable infrastructure for service delivery is essential to enable businesses to participate in FBVNs.
- **Service Engineering:** This involves providing methods and tools for constructing and deploying services, integrating both software and service providers.
- **Platform Services:** The platform should provide brokering, mediation, billing, security, and trust services.
- **Management of Services:** The ability to freely compose and orchestrate business functions available as services on various marketplaces.
- **Security and Trust:** The platform must facilitate trust and trustworthiness in service offerings, balancing individual requirements and policies.

### 4. Service Engineering

Service engineering is a structured approach for describing an organization from a service perspective, translating an initial description from a natural language into a representation that is understood by the organization. Developing and implementing SOA has become a major task for organizations, requiring dedicated departments, specialized staff, and adequate methodologies.

#### 4.1 Definition

Service engineering is the systematic and disciplined development of SOA-based solutions, considering both business and technical perspectives.

#### 4.2 The ISE Methodology

The ISE methodology we are developing not only focuses on the technical perspective but also emphasizes a deep and prominent business perspective when developing business services for the IoS. We have adopted an approach based on the Zachman framework to support service engineering, focusing on the following perspectives and artifacts:

- **Contextual Model:** {Business Rules, Contextual Model}
- **Functional Model:** {Business Processes, Functional Model}
- **Informational Model:** {Business Data, Informational Model}
- **Logical Model:** {Business Workflow, Logical Model}
- **Technical Model:** {Technical Architecture, Technical Model}
- **Physical Model:** {Technical Implementation, Physical Model}

Each layer of the ISE methodology (Figure 1) provides a comprehensive view of the service engineering process, ensuring that both business and technical aspects are well-integrated.

**Figure 1: Perspectives and Artifacts of the ISE Methodology**

```
| Contextual Model | Business Rules, Contextual Model |
| Functional Model | Business Processes, Functional Model |
| Informational Model | Business Data, Informational Model |
| Logical Model | Business Workflow, Logical Model |
| Technical Model | Technical Architecture, Technical Model |
| Physical Model | Technical Implementation, Physical Model |
```

By addressing these requirements and leveraging the ISE methodology, we aim to provide a robust foundation for the implementation of Future Business Value Networks.
