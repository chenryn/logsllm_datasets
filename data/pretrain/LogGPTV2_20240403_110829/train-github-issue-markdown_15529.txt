Subject: Potential Bug in Modal Functionality on getbootstrap.com

Dear Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well.

While reviewing the modal example on the getbootstrap.com website, I noticed an issue when opening the modal. Specifically, the entire page content shifts to the left, which I believe is unintended and may be a bug.

To replicate the issue, please follow these steps:
1. Visit the modals documentation page: <http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals>
2. Click on the "Launch demo modal" button.

Upon opening the modal, you should observe the page content shifting to the left.

I would appreciate it if you could look into this matter and confirm whether it is indeed a bug or if there is a specific reason for this behavior.

Thank you for your attention to this issue.

Kind regards,  
J.
