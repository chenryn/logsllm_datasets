Subject: Issue Encountered During Kubernetes Cluster Setup

Dear Team,

We encountered an issue while executing the `KUBERNETES_PROVIDER=ubuntu ./kube-up.sh` command. The problem occurred during the following steps:

```
* /root/kube/reconfDocker.sh
  - docker stop/waiting
  - docker start/running, process 4601
  - Connection to 192.168.132.4 closed.
  - Validating master
  - Validating root@192.168.132.2
  - Validating root@192.168.132.3
  - Validating root@192.168.132.4
  - Using master 192.168.132.2
  - Cluster "ubuntu" set.
  - User "ubuntu" set.
  - Context "ubuntu" set.
  - Switched to context "ubuntu".
  - Wrote config for ubuntu to /root/.kube/config
  - Calling validate-cluster
  - Error from server: an error on the server has prevented the request from succeeding (kubectl failed, will retry 2 times)
  - Error from server: an error on the server has prevented the request from succeeding (kubectl failed, will retry 1 times)
  - Calling validate-cluster
  - Error from server: an error on the server has prevented the request from succeeding (kubectl failed, will retry 2 times)
  - Error from server: an error on the server has prevented the request from succeeding (kubectl failed, will retry 1 times)
  - Error from server: an error on the server has prevented the request from succeeding ('kubectl get nodes' failed, giving up)
  - Error from server: an error on the server has prevented the request from succeeding (kubectl failed, will retry 2 times)
```

The errors indicate that the `kubectl` commands are failing due to a server-side issue. We need to investigate and resolve this to proceed with the cluster setup.

Please let me know if you have any insights or suggestions on how to address this issue.
