How to configure IntelliSense in Visual Studio Code?
For example, lets consider the below code snippet.
    'use strict';
    import React from 'react';
    import ReactDOMServer from 'react-dom/server';
I would like the IntelliSense to suggests the available methods on `React`,
when I press `cmd + space` after typing `React.`.
Is that possible? If yes any pointer would be of great help.
**PS:**
I have already installed the `dependent modules` and updated the
`package.json` and they are available at `./node_modules/`
