User: Like most Python developers, I typically keep a console window open with the Python interpreter running to test commands, dir() stuff, help() stuff, etc.
Like any console, after a while the visible backlog of past commands and prints gets to be cluttered, and sometimes confusing when re-running the same command several times.  I'm wondering if, and how, to clear the Python interpreter console.
I've heard about doing a system call and either calling cls on Windows or clear on Linux, but I was hoping there was something I could command the interpreter itself to do.
Note: I'm running on Windows, so Ctrl+L doesn't work.
Assistant: just use this..
print '\n'*1000
