ABSTRACT
This paper presents a new side channel that affects mixed-signal
chips used in widespread wireless communication protocols, such
as Bluetooth and WiFi. This increasingly common type of chip
includes the radio transceiver along with digital logic on the same
integrated circuit. In such systems, the radio transmitter may unin-
tentionally broadcast sensitive information from hardware crypto-
graphic components or software executing on the CPU. The well-
known electromagnetic (EM) leakage from digital logic is inadver-
tently mixed with the radio carrier, which is amplified and then
transmitted by the antenna. We call the resulting leak “screaming
channels”. Attacks exploiting such a side channel may succeed
over a much longer distance than attacks exploiting usual EM side
channels.
The root of the problem is that mixed-signal chips include both
digital circuits and analog circuits on the same silicon die in close
physical proximity. While processing data, the digital circuits on
these chips generate noise, which can be picked up by noise-sensitive
analog radio components, ultimately leading to leakage of sensitive
information. We investigate the physical reasons behind the chan-
nel, we measure it on several popular devices from different ven-
dors (including Nordic Semiconductor nRF52832, and Qualcomm
Atheros AR9271), and we demonstrate a complete key recovery
attack against the nRF52832 chip. In particular, we retrieve the full
key from the AES-128 implementation in tinyAES at a distance of
10 m using template attacks. Additionally, we recover the key used
by the AES-128 implementation in mbedTLS at a distance of 1 m
with a correlation attack.
Screaming channel attacks change the threat models of devices
with mixed-signal chips, as those devices are now vulnerable from
a distance. More specifically, we argue that protections against side
channels (such as masking or hiding) need to be used on this class
of devices. Finally, chips implementing other widespread protocols
(e.g., 4G/LTE, RFID) need to be inspected to determine whether
they are vulnerable to screaming channel attacks.
1 INTRODUCTION
The drive for ever smaller and cheaper components in microelec-
tronics has popularized so-called mixed-signal circuits (i.e., circuits
in which analog and digital circuitry reside on the same piece of
silicon, called a die). A typical example is a WiFi chip featuring a
(digital) microcontroller as well as the (analog) radio. The special
challenge of such designs is to separate the “noisy” digital circuits
from the sensitive analog side of the system. In this paper we show
that improper separation of digital and analog components leads
to novel side-channel attacks that can break cryptography imple-
mented in mixed-signal chips over at least 10 meters.

Modern cryptographic algorithms have been designed with a
wide range of attacks in mind and are thus hardened against the
more traditional ways of breaking the secrecy that cryptography
is meant to provide. More recently, a lot of research attention has
therefore been focused on side-channel attacks. In a side-channel
scenario, attackers do not break the algorithm directly, but instead
gain knowledge of the algorithm’s internal state by means of ob-
serving its physical implementation; whenever such knowledge is
not meant to be public, it can be used to undermine the algorithm’s
integrity. For example, Kocher et al. showed in 1999 that observing
the power consumption of a smart card running an unprotected
implementation of DES allows an attacker to guess the key, effec-
tively breaking the cryptosystem [31]. Those results and related
work spawned a long line of work on side-channel attacks against
the implementations of all common cryptographic algorithms.
Measuring a system’s power consumption usually requires direct
physical access and potentially invasive application of probes on the
power supply. A more discreet avenue of attack that has since been
proved feasible are Electromagnetic (EM) attacks. Such attacks use
inadvertent electromagnetic emissions that are common in digital
circuitry—the key observation is that the emanations correlate with
certain computations [5]. EM attacks often use specialized magnetic-
field antennas in close proximity of the target chip, typically within
millimeters. In particular, the emissions of low-power devices are
very weak and do not allow for attacks over larger distances.
The key observation of this paper is that in mixed-design ra-
dio chips the processor’s activity leaks into the analog portion of
the chip, where it is upconverted, amplified, and broadcast as part
of the regular radio output. This leakage is not due to the design
error of an individual vendor, but to a fundamental difficulty in
designing mixed-signal chips. We show that it is possible to re-
cover the original leaked signal and apply variations of known
side-channel analysis techniques; we call our variations Correlation
Radio Analysis (CRA) and Template Radio Analysis (TRA), inspired
by the corresponding classes of power and EM analysis attacks.
Using the example of a commercial off-the-shelf Bluetooth device,
we demonstrate that cryptographic keys can be recovered by ob-
serving the device’s radio emissions in the 2.4 GHz band from a
distance.
Note that our attack does not depend on the actual data that the
device sends—all we need is the fact that the radio is transmitting
while the processor carries out cryptographic operations. Indeed,
in the context of this attack the transmitted data is considered
noise that we effectively remove, whereas the side channel leak
(i.e., signals correlated with the circuit’s computations) is the signal
we aim to recover.
In summary, our contributions are the following:
• We present a novel side channel on devices that handle sen-
sitive information and include a radio transceiver.

• We demonstrate full key recovery up to 10 meters, a much
• We conduct a thorough analysis of the channel’s properties
and explain its origin, allowing chip designers to take the
issue into consideration for future designs.
• We suggest countermeasures to protect current designs.
After examining necessary background information (Section 2)
we give an overview of screaming channels (Section 3) and present
our full example attack (Section 4). We then conduct a detailed
analysis of the channel (Section 5) and perform additional experi-
ments (Section 6). Finally, we discuss the implications of our work
(Section 7), we place it in the context of current research (Section 8),
and we conclude (Section 9).
2 BACKGROUND
In this section we provide required background information, in
particular focusing on EM side-channel attacks and the challenges
associated with mixed-signal circuits. We defer the detailed review
of the electronic effects explaining our new side channel to Sec-
tion 5.
2.1 Side channels
Cryptographic algorithms are generally subject to extensive analy-
sis. Before an algorithm is deployed, care has to be taken that the
security properties it claims actually hold. While there is rarely an
unconditional proof that a given system is secure, the algorithms
in mainstream use today are considered sound under certain as-
sumptions, one of which being that potential attackers might be
able to observe inputs and outputs of an algorithm but not its inter-
nal state. It is this very assumption that does not hold in the case
of side-channel attacks, which can compromise a cryptosystem’s
integrity.
Consider the example of a symmetric cipher using an unknown
key, implemented in software. An attacker may send arbitrary
plaintexts to the system and observe the corresponding ciphertexts;
the goal of the attack is to reveal the key. A secure system should
be designed to thwart such attacks. However, suppose that the
attacker gains some degree of insight into the execution of the
cryptosystem’s implementation, for example, the ability to observe
the data used by the processor when executing machine code. Under
such conditions it is trivial for the attacker to recover the key
simply by observing the operands of the computation at the right
moments. While the example is rather contrived and grants the
attacker an unreasonable degree of power, it exemplifies the general
principle of side-channel attacks: when the implementation of a
system inadvertently leaks information about its internal state,
attackers who recover such information may be able to break the
system’s security guarantees.
Research on the topic of side channels has revealed a variety
of ways for system internals to leak to the outside. The ones most
relevant to our work analyze the correlation of electromagnetic
emanations with computational activity. Quisquater et al. [44] have
shown that electrical switching in digital circuits induces electro-
magnetic emanations correlated with the data processed in the
circuits. Several techniques have been developed for recovering

to the chip we use in our experiments.
secrets on the basis of such correlation, notably Differential EM
Analysis (DEMA) and Template EM Analysis (TEMA) [5].
EM emissions are very weak in general, and exploiting them re-
quires close proximity to the target circuit. While high-power chips
(e.g., PC-class CPUs) allow side-channel attacks from distances of
less than a meter [14, 23, 25, 46] this is not the case for low-power
devices because the leakage is too weak. Typically, probes must be
placed within millimeters of an exposed chip to capture exploitable
information. The side channels we describe are very similar to
EM side channels (see Section 5), but more powerful; the great
advantage of screaming-channel attacks is that weak leakages are
re-transmitted by the device’s own transmitter and can therefore
be detected and exploited from much larger distances.
2.2 Mixed-signal circuits
Though modern electronic systems rely on digital components and
software to process information, they also employ analog circuitry
for power and communication with the outside world. With the
growth of the mobile and telecommunication markets, and with
the more recent development of automotive and Internet of Things
(IoT) applications, radio communications are an increasingly vital
application field of analog circuitry. Though modern protocols
are digital, and most of their layers are implemented in the digital
domain, the generation, amplification, and radiation of radio signals
are inherently analog operations. Moreover, these signals are at
Radio Frequency (RF) and have particular physical properties.
Market pressure for cheaper, smaller devices and advances in
microelectronics have popularized so-called mixed-signal chips,
which combine the digital and analog/RF domain on a single chip
2
(also called Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits (RFICs)). Many
commercial devices use this technology, ranging from WiFi, 3G,
and Bluetooth transceivers to GPS and TV receivers. Figure 1 shows
a labeled die picture of a typical mixed-design Bluetooth chip, the
nRF51822 from Nordic Semiconductor.
Integrating digital and analog microelectronic components on
the same silicon die introduces design and validation challenges at
multiple layers. For the purpose of this paper, the most important
one is dealing with noise. Digital circuits are characterized by an
intense switching activity (i.e., logic gates taking “0” and “1” values).
As a consequence, sharp current variations generate noise in a
wide range of frequencies. Analog/RF circuits, which operate with
continuous signals, are extremely sensitive to noise. The physical
proximity of digital and analog/RF components in mixed-signal
circuits naturally leads to noise issues, with the digital part that acts
as an aggressor of the analog one (the victim), strongly impacting
its performance.1 One of the main reasons for noise propagation
is substrate coupling, where the substrate is the “bulk” silicon on
which both digital and analog components are built. Designing
mixed-signal chips is therefore difficult and, as a consequence, the
literature on the topic is broad (see Section 8).
The side-channel attack we introduce here is based on the idea
that noise coupling propagates sensitive information from the digi-
tal domain to the radio transmission chain, which broadcasts it at
a much larger distance than normal EM leaks. It is interesting to
note that in a mixed-signal design, the transmitter is often more
exposed to noise than other analog/RF components. The reason
is that radio receiver chains are very sensitive to noise and are
therefore typically placed in a corner of the silicon chip, as far as
possible from digital noise[49]; on the other hand, the transmit
chain deals with more powerful signals that are strong enough to
present a good signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) even in the presence of
digital noise. However, we will show that this noise leaks sensitive
information and is powerful enough to make remote side channel
attacks possible.
3 SCREAMING CHANNELS
We now introduce screaming channels by presenting the high-level
concept and our observations before showing a concrete exploit in
Section 4 and explaining the mechanisms underlying the channel
in Section 5.
The basic intuition of screaming channels is that, when an RF cir-
cuit is placed in close proximity to digital circuitry, information on
the digital circuit’s operation leaks into the RF part and is broadcast
along with regular transmissions. If the digital component carries
out sensitive computations (e.g., cryptographic operations) the leak-
ing information that is transmitted by the analog radio component
can be sufficient to render the system vulnerable to side-channel
attacks, as visualized in Figure 2.
We use a simple experiment to demonstrate the presence of the
leak: While capturing the radio output of a mixed-signal chip we
first configure the radio to transmit an arbitrary Bluetooth packet
repeatedly; the digital part of the device is idle in this first step of the
experiment. Then we start running AES, again on arbitrary data, on

Compability (EMC) [41].
