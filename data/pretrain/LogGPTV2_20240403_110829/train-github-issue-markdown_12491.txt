### Proposed new feature or change:
Tensorflow and jax extend the numpy dtype system to include bfloat16. (see:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/lib/core/bfloat16.cc)
I'm trying to scope out the possibility of upstreaming this into numpy.
There is currently an eigen dependency, but I think this could probably be
avoided because it is only use to convert to and from float32 and check for
nans.
Is this the sort of change that numpy would be interested in accepting?
There are more accelerator floating point datatypes coming in the future, and
we would probably want to add them to numpy as well.  
eg:
  * E4M3 with 4 exponent bits, 3 mantissa bits, and 1 sign bit.
  * E5M2, with 5 exponent bits, 2 mantissa bits, and 1 sign bit
