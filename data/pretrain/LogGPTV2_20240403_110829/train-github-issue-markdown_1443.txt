I have two textfields, both of them have a onChange func waiting to be called
each time the func is called a validation occurs and if some error is found
using setState update the `errorText` property where is need.
the problem is the webkit-autofil (on chrome) fills both fields the onChange
event is trigger for the first one but not for the second one leaving the
error on the second field and this last one have the focus
my business logic disable the submit button if there's errors. any advice how
to sort this issue?
