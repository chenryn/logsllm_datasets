Proxy receives a Class[] that contains the interfaces to be supported by the
proxy. The order of classes in the array are significant to Proxy as it uses
that ordering to resolve method signature conflicts.
AdvisedSupport returns an Array of interfaces supported, but the ordering is
undefined. This can lead to unpredictable behaviour of the proxy class.
