ﬂows passing through its customer; and in the PP group, the
predictor is estimating ﬂows passing through a peer.
The results are shown in Figure 17. The differences be-
tween the three cases is sharp. The least opportunity for tar-
geted completion occurs when estimating a provider’s ﬂows;
only about 10% can estimate any provider trafﬁc. The situa-
tion is slightly better for peers: about 20% can estimate some
peer ﬂows, and a small percentage can estimate all of a peer’s
ﬂows. However, the situation is very different for customer
ﬂows. Most providers can estimate a signiﬁcant fraction of
their customer’s ﬂows; and 30% can recover all of the ﬂows
passing through their customers.

6. ESTIMATION ACCURACY
Our results so far are in fact somewhat conservative: AICMC
identiﬁes when an element is surely estimable, but this does
not mean that estimation of other elements is necessarily in-
accurate in practice, particularly when using estimation algo-
rithms other than ICMC. In general, it is important to conﬁrm
that the trends observed when using AICMC to analyze vis-
ibility matrices in fact agree with the results obtained when
actually performing TM completion.
6.1 Approach
In order to conﬁrm that our results are valid in practice, we
perform actual matrix completion as it would be done by each
AS. We provide each AS with only the knowledge of the TM
entries as determined by its visibility matrix. We then perform
matrix completion to estimate the entries that are invisible to
that AS. Note that the fraction of the 30 million matrix ele-
ments visible to any AS varies from 0.3% (for the small num-
ber of ASes with highest density) down to 0.001% and lower
for the vast majority of ASes.
Our focus is on evaluating how AS’s visibility affects its TM
completion ability, so it is important that we use similar trafﬁc
for studying each AS. We do not want our results to be affected
by the differing nature of trafﬁc in each AS (and obtaining
actual trafﬁc measures for each of the ASes in our dataset is
out of the question in any case). Hence we take a single trafﬁc
matrix R (of real trafﬁc, measured in the Géant network) and
use it to populate each AS’s TM. The trafﬁc matrix R is a 54
× 54 submatrix of the entire Geant TM, and we have chosen
rows and columns for R such that all 2,916 elements are visible
to Geant (and therefore represent valid measurements). The
elements of R consist of trafﬁc ﬂowing from ASes to preﬁxes,
which matches the organization of our visibility matrices. We
then populate an experimental TM D of size 133 × 225,041 by
tiling D with copies of R. Although R is a rank of 54 matrix,
our analysis of R (not shown) estimates its effective rank as 2
(95% of the variation in R can be captured in a rank-2 matrix),
and so the rank of D is 54 and effective rank of D is 2 as well.
Since one of our goals in this section is to validate previ-
ous results that relied on ICMC, it is important that we use a
different matrix completion algorithm for these experiments.
For that reason we turn to an algorithm that works very differ-
ently from ICMC, namely LMaFit [25]. While ICMC works
by incrementally constructing the matrix factors X and Y at
full accuracy, LMaFit works by computing progressively more
accurate versions of X and Y (in their entirety) via successive
over-relaxation. LMaFit terminates when it (1) converges to
a solution, meaning that visible elements are accurately repre-
sented in the solution or (2) detects an inability to converge, in
which case LMaFit reports failure.
For each AS, we proceed as follows: First, we identify the
visible elements of D (using the same visibility matrices as
in Section 4). We next set the invisible elements in D to be
zero. We then apply LMaFit to estimate the missing elements
of D (using D’s effective rank of 2 as the input value of k for
LMaFit) yielding either failure, or a completed matrix ˆD.
We evaluate the results using two metrics: ﬁrst, we want
to know whether matrix completion can succeed: for this we
note whether LMaFit succeeds in each case. Second, we want
to know the accuracy of estimation that is possible in each
case, which we measure using Normalized Mean Absolute Er-
ror (NMAE):
NMAE =
∑(i,j) /∈Ω |Dij − ˆDij |
∑(i,j) /∈Ω Dij
.
Note that the accuracy metric only applies to those cases where
TM completion is successful.
6.2 Results
Our results compare number of preﬁxes announced by an
AS’s customers with its estimation failure rate and estimation
accuracy. We sample 20 ASes in logarithmically spaced bins
across the entire range of number of preﬁxes. In Figures 18
and 19, each point is the bin average, and 95% conﬁdence in-
tervals are shown in Figure 19.
Figure 18 shows that there is a strong relationship between
number of customer preﬁxes and success rate of LMaFit. This
is entirely consistent with the results in Section 4 and conﬁrms
that the ASes with large customer set can successfully perform
TM completion. Figure 19 shows that the accuracy of TM
completion can be quite good — generally between 0.5 and
1. Thus, as long as TM completion is possible, it can be done
with high accuracy.
In fact, we ﬁnd this last point to be true across all the exper-
iments, i.e. regardless of the metric used to characterize ASes,
410average NMAE is consistently in the range of 0.5 to 1, and
there is no signiﬁcant change in NMAE across metric values.
This applies not just to number of customer preﬁxes, but to
k-shell number and degree. In all cases, as long as TM com-
pletion is possible, it can be done with relatively high accuracy.
Thus, the metric that gives the most insight into TM comple-
tion ability is failure rate. We ﬁnd that k-shell number is not a
good indicator of low failure rate, whereas node-degree is (re-
sults not shown). This conﬁrms our results from Section 4, and
underscores that ASes with good ability to complete their TMs
are generally those whose customers advertise large numbers
of preﬁxes.
7. DISCUSSION
While the results in this study are suggestive, they do not
precisely identify the TM completion ability of ASes. One
reason is that in Sections 4 and 5 we are only working with a
portion of each AS’s visibility matrix. Although the visibility
matrices we use have over 30 million elements, this is only
about 0.5% of the full visibility matrix of an AS. That said, we
have no reason to believe that the matrix portions we study are
unusual.
Additionally, our results start from the assumption that TMs
have low effective rank. While this fact has been empirically
observed in numerous studies (as described in Section 2.2), all
such observations to date have been at limited scale (hundreds
or thousands of rows or columns). When considering TMs of
the size in this paper (hundreds of thousands of columns) it is
an open question whether and to what degree the property of
low effective rank holds. However, this is a concern only if the
AS seeks to complete its entire TM. For the results in Section 5
(including the business case described in Section 1) an AS is
only concerned with completing a relatively small portion of
its TM.
Broadly, the analytic and empirical sides of our study com-
bine to yield a number of insights. In particular, our results
suggest that:
• ASes in the innermost k-shell of Internet are not neces-
sarily effective at TM completion. Proposition 3.4 showed
that densely-meshed nodes can do TM completion, but
only to a rank limited by the number of their customers.
Empirically we ﬁnd that densely-meshed ASes are not
uniformly strong at TM completion (Figure 9(a)).
In
particular, the ASes that have the most peers are not es-
pecially well suited to complete their TMs (Figure 11(a)).
• ASes with many single-homed customers are best suited
to perform TM completion. Propositions 3.5 and 3.8
show that it is good to have a large single-parent cus-
tomer tree, and it is better for those nodes to be ar-
ranged in a wide tree rather than a deep tree. Empirically
we ﬁnd ASes with many customers are most effective
at TM completion (Figure 11(a),(b)) and that an AS’s
customers contribute a large number of visible elements
useful for TM completion (Figure 11(b)).
• ASes are most effective at completing matrix entries that
correspond to ‘nearby’ ﬂows. Flows that pass through
neighboring ASes are more easily estimated than ﬂows
that do not pass through neighboring ASes (Figure 15).
It seems that typical routing structures imply that ﬂows
that pass through neighbor ASes are more likely to have
sources or destinations in common with visible ﬂows,
thus making recovery more likely.
• When targeting speciﬁc ASes for completion, customer
trafﬁc is most readily estimated. Among (predictor, tar-
get) AS pairs, the greatest completion ability exists when
the predictor and target are neighbors (Figure 16) and in
particular when the target is the customer of the predic-
tor (Figure 17). Thus, not only do customers provide
important information for completing TMs, but they are
particularly good targets for TM completion.
The picture that emerges is that ASes with many direct single-
homed customers have a particularly advantageous platform
for performing TM completion. This suggests that ASes with
many customers have a perhaps-underappreciated resource: not
only do customers provide revenue, but the patterns of trafﬁc
that they send contain considerable information about trafﬁc
in other, more distant parts of the Internet.
8. CONCLUSION
In this paper we have investigated the application of the
emerging concept of matrix completion to the speciﬁc case of
Internet trafﬁc matrices. The ability to perform matrix com-
pletion on TMs would provide considerable beneﬁt spanning
scientiﬁc, engineering, and commercial domains. Our goal is
to understand how the structure of Internet routing and topol-
ogy affects the ability of a given AS to estimate trafﬁc ﬂows
that it cannot measure. We start by building intuition through
analysis and we then deepen and extend our understanding us-
ing measurements of actual Internet routing.
We ﬁnd that many ASes have the ability to perform at least
partial TM completion. However which ASes are best at com-
pletion, and which elements they can recover, depends strongly
on the local topology of the network. In particular, our study
focuses attention on an AS’s customers as its most important
resource for TM completion. Customers provide rich informa-
tion about trafﬁc patterns; for example, a large array of single-
homed stub customers provides an AS with the ability to in-
fer invisible trafﬁc even when the missing trafﬁc is relatively
complex (high rank). This suggests that many ASes scattered
throughout the Internet have visibility into local trafﬁc patterns
that is well suited to inferring the nature of more distant, un-
measurable trafﬁc.
