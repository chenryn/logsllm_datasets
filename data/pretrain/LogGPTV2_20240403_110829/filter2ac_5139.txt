### ATT&CK ID: T1458
### ATT&CK Technique Name: Replication Through Removable Media

Adversaries may propagate malware or gain access to systems by exploiting or copying malicious code to devices connected via USB. This technique can be used for both Lateral Movement and Initial Access.

**Lateral Movement:**
In the context of Lateral Movement, adversaries may take advantage of the physical connection between a device and a compromised or malicious charging station or PC. By doing so, they can bypass application store requirements and install malicious applications directly onto the device. This method allows them to spread their malware across multiple devices without the need for user interaction or approval.

**Initial Access:**
For Initial Access, adversaries may attempt to exploit the device through the USB connection to gain unauthorized access to data stored on the device. This can include:

- **Data Exfiltration:** Stealing sensitive information such as personal data, credentials, or corporate files.
- **Malware Infection:** Installing malware that can further compromise the device or provide a backdoor for future attacks.
- **Device Control:** Gaining control over the device to perform additional malicious activities, such as spying on the user or using the device as part of a botnet.

By leveraging removable media, adversaries can effectively extend their reach and maintain persistence within a network, making this a significant threat vector in both personal and organizational contexts.
