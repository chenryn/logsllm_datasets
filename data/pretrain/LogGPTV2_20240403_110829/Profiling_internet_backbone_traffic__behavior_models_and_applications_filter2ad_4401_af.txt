# Cluster Analysis and Traffic Behavior Profiles

## 1. Introduction
This document provides a detailed analysis of network traffic behavior, focusing on the identification and characterization of different types of traffic clusters. The analysis is based on data-mining and information-theoretic techniques applied to link-level traffic data. The goal is to detect and interpret significant behavior patterns, particularly those that may indicate unwanted traffic or anomalies.

## 2. Cluster Size Distributions
### Figure 7: Average Cluster Size Distributions
- **Clusters within Four Groups of BCs for srcIP Clusters on L1**
  - **(a) BC6, BC7, BC8**: These clusters are associated with Web, DNS, or Email servers.
  - **(b) BC18, BC19**: These clusters represent heavy-hitter hosts, typically clients sending a large number of flows to a few servers.
  - **(c) BC2, BC20**: These clusters exhibit scan/exploit behavior.
  - **(d) Other BCs**: Miscellaneous clusters with various characteristics.

- **Note**: In (c) and (d), the flow count and packet count lines are indistinguishable because most flows in these clusters contain a single packet.

## 3. Time-Based Cluster Analysis
### Figure 8: Cluster Sizes and RU Measures Over Time
- **Cluster Sizes (in Flow, Packet, and Byte Counts)**
  - **dstPrt TCP 80 Cluster**: Represents aggregate web server behavior over a 24-hour period.
  - **RU Measures**: Relative usage (RU) of source port, source IP, and destination IP over time.

- **Observations**:
  - The dstPrt TCP port 80 cluster is highly persistent, observed in every time slot.
  - The number of srcIPs (web servers) remains fairly stable over time.
  - The cluster size shows a diurnal pattern but does not fluctuate dramatically.
  - Packet and byte counts are significantly larger than the total number of flows, indicating that each flow contains multiple packets and several hundred bytes on average.

## 4. Behavioral Characteristics of srcIP Clusters
- **BC6, BC7, BC8**: Predominantly Web, DNS, or Email servers.
  - **Behavior**: Stable with high frequency and diverse packet/byte counts.
  - **Other Clusters**: Associated with alternative HTTP services, HTTPS, real audio/video servers, IRC servers, and P2P servers.
  - **Novel Services**: Three srcIP clusters with service ports 56192, 56193, and 60638, likely running on unusual high ports.

## 5. Heavy Hitter Host Profile
- **Definition**: Hosts (typically clients) that send a large number of flows to a single or a few other hosts (typically servers) in a short period.
- **BCs**: srcIP BC18 [2,0,0] or BC19 [2,0,1], dstIP BC6 [0,2,0] and BC7 [0,2,1].
- **Characteristics**:
  - Medium frequency and stability.
  - Associated with well-known service ports.
  - Diverse packet and byte counts.
  - Examples include NAT boxes, web proxies, cache servers, and web crawlers.

- **Example**: 
  - 392 and 429 unique srcIP clusters from datasets L1 and L2 belong to BC18 and BC19.
  - Most frequent ports: TCP port 80 (70%), UDP port 53 (15%), TCP port 443 (10%), and TCP port 1080 (3%).

## 6. Scan/Exploit Profile
- **Behavioral Characteristics**:
  - Highly volatile, appearing and disappearing quickly.
  - Flows contain one or two packets with fixed sizes.
  - Failed TCP connections on known exploit ports.
  - Fixed-size UDP and ICMP packets matching known exploit signatures.

- **BCs**: 
  - srcIP clusters: BC2 [0,0,2] and BC20 [2,0,2].
  - dstIP clusters: BC2 [0,0,2] and BC8 [0,2,2].

- **Examples**:
  - Scanning activity on UDP port 12827.
  - Potential new forms of remote access trojans (RATs).

## 7. Deviant or Rare Behaviors
- **Rare Behavior Classes**:
  - Atypical behavioral patterns, such as sudden appearance and disappearance of clusters.
  - Example: dstPrt clusters (TCP ports 6667, 113, and 8083) in rare dstPrt BC15 [1,2,0], suggesting DDoS attacks.

- **Behavioral Changes**:
  - Unstable behaviors, such as jumping between BCs.
  - Example: A Yahoo web server transitioning from BC8 to BC6, indicating suspicious client behavior.

- **Unusual Profiles for Popular Service Ports**:
  - Common service ports exhibiting non-canonical behavior.
  - Example: Scanning activities on ports 25, 53, 80, etc., with small packet and byte counts.

## 8. Conclusions
- **Significance**: Extracting significant events from vast internet traffic is crucial for detecting cyber attacks and new disruptive applications.
- **Methodology**: Data-mining and information-theoretic techniques were used to discover and interpret behavior patterns.
- **Future Work**: Implementing an online anomaly detection system, evaluating false positives and negatives, and extending the profiling approach to application-level payload.
