User: I'm wondering if it is possible to run another file:
    os.startfile('File.py')
and have that file return a value to the file that called the other file.
For example, you have File1. Is it possible for File1 to call and run File2 and have File2 return a value to File1?
Assistant: Not with os.startfile(), no; it provides no way of communicating with the launched process. You could use the subprocess module, though; this will allow you to send data to and receive data from the launched process through standard in/out. Or, since the thing you want to call is another Python script, simply import the other file and call its functions directly, or use execfile().
