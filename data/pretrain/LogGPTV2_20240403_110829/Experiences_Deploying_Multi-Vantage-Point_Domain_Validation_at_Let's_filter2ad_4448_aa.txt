## Abstract
An attacker can obtain a valid TLS certificate for a domain by hijacking communication between a Certificate Authority (CA) and the victim domain. Performing domain validation from multiple vantage points can defend against these attacks. We explore the design space of multi-vantage-point domain validation to achieve:
1. **Security**: Sufficiently diverse vantage points to ensure some can reach the legitimate domain.
2. **Performance**: Low latency and overhead in certificate issuance.
3. **Manageability**: Compliance with CA/Browser Forum requirements and minimal changes to CA operations.
4. **Low benign failure rate**: Minimal false negatives for legitimate requests.

Our open-source implementation was deployed by Let's Encrypt in February 2020, securing over half a billion certificates in its first year. Using real-world operational data, we show that our approach has negligible latency and communication overhead, with a benign failure rate comparable to conventional single-vantage-point designs. We evaluate security improvements using ethically conducted BGP hijacks, Internet-scale traceroute experiments, and a novel BGP simulation framework, demonstrating that multi-vantage-point domain validation can thwart the vast majority of BGP attacks. Our work motivates the deployment of this approach across the CA ecosystem to strengthen TLS certificate issuance and user privacy.

## 1. Introduction
Certificate Authorities (CAs) establish trust on the Internet by associating domains with correct public keys through digitally signed certificates. CAs must ensure that a certificate is only issued to the legitimate domain owner. Otherwise, an adversary with a bogus certificate could circumvent HTTPS assurances and decrypt or modify sensitive user data (e.g., logins, financial information, cryptocurrency credentials). To prevent these attacks, CAs perform domain control validation, requiring the domain owner to demonstrate control of a core resource associated with the domain (e.g., a web server, email address, or DNS record).

### 1.1 Domain Validation Attacks and Defenses
Domain control validation is vulnerable to localized and targeted Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) attacks, allowing adversaries to obtain bogus certificates. These attacks are possible because validation is often performed over insecure HTTP connections. The BGP attack places the adversary on the path between the CA and the victim domain, enabling the adversary to maliciously answer the validation request (Figure 1). Successful validation allows the adversary to obtain a certificate for the domain. These attacks are particularly effective because they can be localized and short-lived but lead to the adversary obtaining a universally-valid multi-year certificate for the victim’s domain. Such attacks are within the capability of repressive regimes, which have been accused of launching BGP attacks and intercepting encrypted communications.

### 1.2 MultiVA Design, Deployment, & Analysis
This paper presents the design and evaluation of MultiVA, the first real-world deployment of the multi-vantage-point countermeasure to secure domain control validation. Creating a production-grade system is challenging due to competing trade-offs:

- **Security**: Vantage points must offer diverse perspectives on routing, and the quorum policy must be strong enough to thwart attacks without sacrificing performance and robustness.
- **Manageability**: Multiple vantage points require more server and network resources, potentially involving multiple cloud providers and compliance with CA/Browser forum requirements.
- **Performance**: Additional vantage points should not significantly slow down the domain control validation process or introduce high communication overhead.
- **Benign Failure**: Non-malicious validation failures caused by external factors like DNS propagation delays and configuration errors should be minimized.

We explore the design space to balance these challenges, proposing a deployment within a single cloud provider for good performance and manageability. We carefully select vantage points across diverse geographic locations and connect them to existing CA components using mutually-authenticated TLS. Our design balances the number and location of vantage points to control the trade-off between security, manageability, performance, and benign failures.

![Localized BGP Attack](path_to_figure_2)

To mitigate these attacks, CAs need to defend themselves from routing attacks on domain control validation. A promising approach is to perform validation from multiple diverse vantage points, making it hard for the adversary to fool all (or many) of the vantage points. Vantage points unaffected by the BGP attack reach the legitimate victim domain and observe that domain control validation has not been completed (Figure 2), stopping the CA from issuing a certificate to the adversary. With effective multi-vantage-point validation, an adversary capable of launching localized BGP attacks will have significant difficulty obtaining a bogus certificate, as they cannot have topological proximity to all of the CA’s diverse vantage points. Successful attacks would require announcing BGP routes with broad scope, which is infeasible for /24 IP prefixes.

### 1.3 MultiVA Design, Deployment, & Analysis
This paper presents the design and evaluation of MultiVA, the first real-world deployment of the multi-vantage-point countermeasure to secure domain control validation. We develop a fully open-source implementation that does not require any changes to the Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME). Our implementation builds upon the Boulder ACME implementation and was deployed by Let's Encrypt in February 2020. Since then, it has secured the issuance of over half a billion TLS certificates during the first year of its deployment, validating domain control for approximately 1.5 million certificates a day. This demonstrates the feasibility of the MultiVA approach at Internet scale and represents a major step in strengthening the Internet PKI against BGP attacks.

#### Evaluating System Performance and Benign Failures
We obtained operational data for the MultiVA deployment from Let's Encrypt and used it to analyze system performance and benign failures. We found that the system incurs negligible latency overhead, as validations from multiple vantage points occur in parallel and validation time from well-connected cloud-based vantage points is much faster than from the existing CA vantage point. The communication overhead for typical certificate issuance rates is 0.5 Mbps per remote vantage point, far below the saturation point of 100 Mbps upstream links. The rate of benign failures is around 1%, typically caused by DNS propagation delays and configuration issues, which can be overcome by retrying the certificate issuance request.

#### Evaluating System Security
Unlike performance metrics, the security offered by multi-vantage-point domain validation cannot be understood from deployment data alone. We analyze MultiVA holistically across various analytical frameworks, including ethically conducted real-world attacks, deployment metrics, Internet-scale traceroute measurements, and novel BGP attack simulations. By comparing the data produced in these different settings, we can reason holistically about how to optimally evaluate and deploy multi-vantage-point validation. Our MultiVA deployment using a single cloud provider can successfully mitigate a vast majority of BGP attacks. We also make recommendations for further enhancing the deployment via additional diverse vantage points.

We hope our work motivates industry-wide adoption of MultiVA in the CA ecosystem to strengthen the PKI and protect user privacy. We have released our multi-vantage-point domain validation implementation as open-source software and are working on standardizing it.

## 2. Let's Encrypt Certificate Management
Let's Encrypt is an automated CA that requires no human interaction to request or renew a certificate. According to CloudFlare, Let's Encrypt accounts for over 70% of daily certificate transparency log entries, making it a major influence in the CA market. Let's Encrypt exposes a standardized API—the Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME)—for third-party clients (e.g., EFF’s Certbot) to access.

### The Boulder ACME Implementation
Let's Encrypt is powered by an open-source ACME implementation called Boulder, designed for security, reliability, and performance. Boulder has issued over a billion trusted certificates. It is subdivided into components based on their role in the certificate issuance process and to minimize the attack surface between components and the global Internet. Each component is deployed in isolated network segments with strict firewall rules limiting ingress/egress traffic based on the API exposed by the components.

As shown in Figure 4 (A), the primary system components of Boulder include the Web Front End (WFE), Registration Authority (RA), Validation Authority (VA), and Certificate Authority (CA). Only the WFE requires inbound traffic from the wider Internet for the ACME API interface, and only the VA requires outbound traffic to arbitrary hosts on the wider Internet to perform domain validation.

During certificate issuance, ACME clients interact with the WFE to submit a to-be-signed certificate, following the process described in the ACME RFC. The WFE interacts with the RA to associate accounts with authorizations and other resources. The RA in turn interacts with the VA to request domain validation. The VA performs the validation and sends the result to the RA.

**Lesson Learned:**
- **Design and Deployment**: Requiring successful domain validation from the primary VA satisfies CA/Browser Forum requirements. A phased deployment helps understand and address failure scenarios before enforcement.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Benign failures are uncommon and usually mitigated by the quorum policy. DNS synchronization delays are responsible for a large fraction of benign failures. Packet filters that block domain validation requests lead to some benign failures.

**Note:** Some websites inaccurately show low market share for Let's Encrypt (e.g., 0.2%) because they only count certificates that chain directly to Let's Encrypt’s ISRG root. In fact, the vast majority of certificates Let's Encrypt issues are chained through IdenTrust’s DST X3 root certificate.
