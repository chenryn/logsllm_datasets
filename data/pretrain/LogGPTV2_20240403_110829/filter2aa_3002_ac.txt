### MGM, Inc. v. Copyright Infringement Remedies

In *MGM, Inc., 772 F.2d 505, 512 n.5 (9th Cir. 1985)*, the court outlined several key remedies available under copyright law. First, copyright law provides for injunctive relief, seizure of infringing articles, and the awarding of costs and attorneys' fees. See 17 U.S.C. §§ 502-03, 505. Second, as highlighted by the amicus Software & Information Industry Association, copyright law allows copyright owners to seek remedies against "downstream" infringers, even if they are not in privity of contract. See *ProCD, Inc. v. Zeidenberg*, 86 F.3d at 1454. Third, a licensee may commit copyright infringement by continuing to use the licensed work while failing to make required payments, even though such a failure might not otherwise be directly linked to the licensor's exclusive statutory rights. However, we consider payment obligations as sui generis due to their unique connection to all commercial copyright licenses, not just those concerning software.

### MDY Industries v. Blizzard Entertainment: Analysis of DMCA Violations

**Case Background**

In *MDY Industries v. Blizzard Entertainment*, the court addressed whether MDY was liable under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) for programming its bot, Glider, to avoid detection by Blizzard’s anti-cheat technology, Warden. 

**Warden Technology**

Warden has two components:
1. **Scan.dll**: This module scans a player's RAM before allowing them to connect to World of Warcraft (WoW) servers. If it detects a bot, such as Glider, it prevents the player from connecting.
2. **Resident Component**: This runs in the background while the player is connected to WoW servers. It periodically checks for known bot or cheat code patterns and boots players if such patterns are detected, halting the copying of copyrighted code into RAM.

**Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)**

The DMCA, enacted in 1998, aligns U.S. copyright law with international treaties and addresses the challenges of digital copyright enforcement. The DMCA includes three key provisions:
1. **17 U.S.C. § 1201(a)(1)(A)**: Prohibits circumventing technological measures that control access to protected works.
2. **17 U.S.C. § 1201(a)(2)**: Prohibits trafficking in technology that circumvents access controls.
3. **17 U.S.C. § 1201(b)(1)**: Prohibits trafficking in technology that circumvents measures protecting a copyright owner's rights.

**District Court Decision**

The district court evaluated MDY's liability under the DMCA with respect to three aspects of WoW:
1. **Literal Elements**: Source code stored on players' hard drives.
2. **Non-Literal Elements**: Individual visual and audible components.
3. **Dynamic Non-Literal Elements**: Real-time gameplay experience.

The court granted partial summary judgment to MDY regarding the literal and individual non-literal elements, finding that Warden did not effectively control access to these elements. However, the court ruled in favor of Blizzard regarding the dynamic non-literal elements, concluding that Warden effectively controlled access to the real-time gameplay experience.

**Analysis of DMCA Provisions**

The court analyzed the interplay between the DMCA provisions and the Copyright Act. Section 1201(a) creates a new right to prevent circumvention of access controls, while Section 1201(b) strengthens traditional copyright protections against infringement. Key differences include:
1. **Textual Differences**: Section 1201(a) focuses on access controls, while Section 1201(b) protects traditional exclusive rights.
2. **Circumvention Definitions**: Section 1201(a) includes descrambling and decrypting, which do not necessarily infringe on traditional rights.
3. **Prohibition Scope**: Section 1201(a) prohibits circumvention itself, whereas Section 1201(b) targets trafficking in circumvention devices.
4. **Library of Congress Exemptions**: Section 1201(a) allows the Library of Congress to exempt certain circumventions, balancing public access with copyright protection.

**Conclusion**

The court concluded that MDY violated the DMCA by programming Glider to circumvent Warden, thereby allowing users to access WoW's dynamic non-literal elements. The decision underscores the importance of the DMCA in protecting both access controls and traditional copyright rights.
