MGM, Inc., 772 F.2d 505, 512 n.5 (9th Cir. 1985). Second, copyright law
offers injunctive relief, seizure of infringing articles, and awards of costs
and attorneys’ fees. 17 U.S.C. §§ 502-03, 505. Third, as amicus Software
& Information Industry Association highlights, copyright law allows
copyright owners a remedy against “downstream” infringers with whom
they are not in privity of contract. See ProCD, Inc., 86 F.3d at 1454. 
4A licensee arguably may commit copyright infringement by continuing
to use the licensed work while failing to make required payments, even
though a failure to make payments otherwise lacks a nexus to the licen-
sor’s exclusive statutory rights. We view payment as sui generis, however,
because of the distinct nexus between payment and all commercial copy-
right licenses, not just those concerning software.

claims. Accordingly, we must also vacate the portion of the
district court’s permanent injunction that barred MDY and
Donnelly from “infringing, or contributing to the infringement
of, Blizzard’s copyrights in WoW software.”
V.
After MDY began selling Glider, Blizzard launched War-
den, its technology designed to prevent players who used bots
from connecting to the WoW servers. Blizzard used Warden
to ban most Glider users in September 2005. Blizzard claims
that MDY is liable under DMCA §§ 1201(a)(2) and (b)(1)
because it thereafter programmed Glider to avoid detection by
Warden. 
A. The Warden technology
Warden has two components. The first is a software mod-
ule called “scan.dll,” which scans a computer’s RAM prior to
allowing the player to connect to WoW’s servers. If scan.dll
detects that a bot is running, such as Glider, it will not allow
the player to connect and play. After Blizzard launched War-
den, MDY reconfigured Glider to circumvent scan.dll by not
loading itself until after scan.dll completed its check. War-
den’s second component is a “resident” component that runs
periodically in the background on a player’s computer when
it is connected to WoW’s servers. It asks the computer to
report portions of the WoW code running in RAM, and it
looks for patterns of code associated with known bots or
cheats. If it detects a bot or cheat, it boots the player from the
game, which halts the computer’s copying of copyrighted
code into RAM. 
B. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act
Congress enacted the DMCA in 1998 to conform United
States copyright law to its obligations under two World Intel-
lectual Property Organization (“WIPO”) treaties, which

require contracting parties to provide effective legal remedies
against the circumvention of protective technological mea-
sures used by copyright owners. See Universal City Studios,
Inc. v. Corley, 273 F.3d 429, 440 (2d Cir. 2001). In enacting
the DMCA, Congress sought to mitigate the problems pre-
sented by copyright enforcement in the digital age. Id. The
DMCA contains three provisions directed at the circumven-
tion of copyright owners’ technological measures. The
Supreme Court has yet to construe these provisions, and they
raise questions of first impression in this circuit.
The first provision, 17 U.S.C. § 1201(a)(1)(A), is a general
prohibition against “circumventing a technological measure
that effectively controls access to a work protected under [the
Copyright Act].” The second prohibits trafficking in technol-
ogy that circumvents a technological measure that “effec-
tively controls access” to a copyrighted work. 17 U.S.C.
§ 1201(a)(2). The third prohibits trafficking in technology that
circumvents a technological measure that “effectively pro-
tects” a copyright owner’s right. 17 U.S.C. § 1201(b)(1).
C. The district court’s decision
The district court assessed whether MDY violated DMCA
§§ 1201(a)(2) and (b)(1) with respect to three WoW compo-
nents. First, the district court considered the game client soft-
ware’s literal elements: the source code stored on players’
hard drives. Second, the district court considered the game
client software’s individual non-literal elements: the
400,000+ discrete visual and audible components of the
game, such as a visual image of a monster or its audible roar.
Finally, it considered the game’s dynamic non-literal ele-
ments: that is, the “real-time experience of traveling through
different worlds, hearing their sounds, viewing their struc-
tures, encountering their inhabitants and monsters, and
encountering other players.”
The district court granted MDY partial summary judgment
as to Blizzard’s § 1201(a)(2) claim with respect to WoW’s lit-

Case: 09-16044   12/14/2010   Page: 19 of 47    ID: 7579806   DktEntry: 54-1
eral elements. The district court reasoned that Warden does
not effectively control access to the literal elements because
WoW players can access the literal elements without connect-
ing to a game server and encountering Warden; they need
only install the game client software on their computers. The
district court also ruled for MDY following trial as to Bliz-
zard’s § 1201(a)(2) claim with respect to WoW’s individual
non-literal elements, reasoning that these elements could also
be accessed on a player’s hard drive without encountering
Warden.
The district court, however, ruled for Blizzard following
trial as to its §§ 1201(a)(2) and (b)(1) claims with respect to
WoW’s dynamic non-literal elements, or the “real-time expe-
rience” of playing WoW. It reasoned that Warden effectively
controlled access to these elements, which could not be
accessed without connecting to Blizzard’s servers. It also
found that Glider allowed its users to circumvent Warden by
avoiding or bypassing its detection features, and that MDY
marketed Glider for use in circumventing Warden. 
We turn to consider whether Glider violates DMCA
§§ 1201(a)(2) and (b)(1) by allowing users to circumvent
Warden to access WoW’s various elements. MDY contends
that Warden’s scan.dll and resident components are separate,
and only scan.dll should be considered as a potential access
control measure under § 1201(a)(2). However, in our view, an
access control measure can both (1) attempt to block initial
access and (2) revoke access if a secondary check determines
that access was unauthorized. Our analysis considers War-
den’s scan.dll and resident components together because the
two components have the same purpose: to prevent players
using detectable bots from continuing to access WoW soft-
ware.
D. Construction of § 1201
One of the issues raised by this appeal is whether certain
provisions of § 1201 prohibit circumvention of access con-

trols when access does not constitute copyright infringement.
To answer this question and others presented by this appeal,
we address the nature and interrelationship of the various pro-
visions of § 1201 in the overall context of the Copyright Act.
We begin by considering the scope of DMCA § 1201’s
three operative provisions, §§ 1201(a)(1), 1201(a)(2), and
1201(b)(1). We consider them side-by-side, because “[w]e do
not . . . construe statutory phrases in isolation; we read stat-
utes as a whole. Thus, the [term to be construed] must be read
in light of the immediately following phrase . . . .” United
States v. Morton, 467 U.S. 822, 828 (1984); see also Padash
v. I.N.S., 358 F.3d 1161, 1170 (9th Cir. 2004) (we analyze the
statutory provision to be construed “in the context of the gov-
erning statute as a whole, presuming congressional intent to
create a coherent regulatory scheme”).
1. Text of the operative provisions
“We begin, as always, with the text of the statute.” Hawaii
v. Office of Hawaiian Affairs, 129 S. Ct. 1436, 1443 (2009)
(quoting Permanent Mission of India to United Nations v.
City of New York, 551 U.S. 193, 197 (2007)). Section
1201(a)(1)(A) prohibits “circumvent[ing] a technological
measure that effectively controls access to a work protected
under this title.” Sections 1201(a)(2) and (b)(1) provide that
“[n]o person shall manufacture, import, offer to the public,
provide, or otherwise traffic in any technology, product, ser-
vice, device, component, or part thereof, that —

(emphasis added).
2. Our harmonization of the DMCA’s operative 
provisions
[13] For the reasons set forth below, we believe that
§ 1201 is best understood to create two distinct types of
claims. First, § 1201(a) prohibits the circumvention of any
technological measure that effectively controls access to a
protected work and grants copyright owners the right to
enforce that prohibition. Cf. Corley, 273 F.3d at 441 (“[T]he
focus of subsection 1201(a)(2) is circumvention of technolo-
gies designed to prevent access to a work”). Second, and in
contrast to § 1201(a), § 1201(b)(1) prohibits trafficking in
technologies that circumvent technological measures that
effectively protect “a right of a copyright owner.” Section
1201(b)(1)’s prohibition is thus aimed at circumventions of

measures that protect the copyright itself: it entitles copyright
owners to protect their existing exclusive rights under the
Copyright Act. Those exclusive rights are reproduction, distri-
bution, public performance, public display, and creation of
derivative works. 17 U.S.C. § 106. Historically speaking, pre-
venting “access” to a protected work in itself has not been a
right of a copyright owner arising from the Copyright Act.
5
[14] Our construction of § 1201 is compelled by the four
significant textual differences between §§ 1201(a) and (b).
First, § 1201(a)(2) prohibits the circumvention of a measure
that “effectively controls access to a work protected under
this title,” whereas § 1201(b)(1) concerns a measure that “ef-
fectively protects a right of a copyright owner under this title
in a work or portion thereof.” (emphasis added). We read
§ 1201(b)(1)’s language — “right of a copyright owner under
this title” — to reinforce copyright owners’ traditional exclu-
sive rights under § 106 by granting them an additional cause
of action against those who traffic in circumventing devices
that facilitate infringement. Sections 1201(a)(1) and (a)(2),
however, use the term “work protected under this title.” Nei-
ther of these two subsections explicitly refers to traditional
copyright infringement under § 106. Accordingly, we read
this term as extending a new form of protection, i.e., the right
to prevent circumvention of access controls, broadly to works
protected under Title 17, i.e., copyrighted works.
Second, as used in § 1201(a), to “circumvent a technologi-
cal measure” means “to descramble a scrambled work, to
decrypt an encrypted work, or otherwise to avoid, bypass,
remove, deactivate, or impair a technological measure, with-
out the authority of the copyright owner.” 17 U.S.C.
517 U.S.C. § 106; see also Jay Dratler, Cyberlaw: Intellectual Prop. in
the Digital Millennium, § 1.02 (2009) (stating that the DMCA’s “protec-
tion is also quite different from the traditional exclusive rights of the copy-
right holder . . . [where the] exclusive rights never implicated access to the
work, as such”). 
20004
MDY INDUSTRIES v. BLIZZARD ENTERTAINMENT
Case: 09-16044   12/14/2010   Page: 23 of 47    ID: 7579806   DktEntry: 54-1
§ 1201(a)(3)(A). These two specific examples of unlawful cir-
cumvention under § 1201(a) — descrambling a scrambled
work and decrypting an encrypted work — are acts that do
not necessarily infringe or facilitate infringement of a copy-
right.
6 Descrambling or decrypting only enables someone to
watch or listen to a work without authorization, which is not
necessarily an infringement of a copyright owner’s traditional
exclusive rights under § 106. Put differently, descrambling
and decrypting do not necessarily result in someone’s repro-
ducing, distributing, publicly performing, or publicly display-
ing the copyrighted work, or creating derivative works based
on the copyrighted work. 
The third significant difference between the subsections is
that § 1201(a)(1)(A) prohibits circumventing an effective
access control measure, whereas § 1201(b) prohibits traffick-
ing in circumventing devices, but does not prohibit circum-
vention itself because such conduct was already outlawed as
copyright infringement. The Senate Judiciary Committee
explained:
This . . . is the reason there is no prohibition on con-
duct in 1201(b) akin to the prohibition on circum-
vention conduct in 1201(a)(1). The prohibition in
1201(a)(1) is necessary because prior to this Act, the
conduct of circumvention was never before made
unlawful. The device limitation on 1201(a)(2)
enforces this new prohibition on conduct. The copy-
right law has long forbidden copyright infringe-
ments, so no new prohibition was necessary. 
S. Rep. No. 105-90, at 11 (1998). This difference reinforces
our reading of § 1201(b) as strengthening copyright owners’
traditional rights against copyright infringement and of
6Perhaps for this reason, Congress did not list descrambling and decryp-
ting as circumventing acts that would violate § 1201(b)(1). See 17 U.S.C.
§ 1201(b)(2)(A).

MDY INDUSTRIES v. BLIZZARD ENTERTAINMENT
Case: 09-16044   12/14/2010   Page: 24 of 47    ID: 7579806   DktEntry: 54-1
§ 1201(a) as granting copyright owners a new anti-
circumvention right.
Fourth, in § 1201(a)(1)(B)-(D), Congress directs the
Library of Congress (“Library”) to identify classes of copy-
righted works for which “noninfringing uses by persons who
are users of a copyrighted work are, or are likely to be,
adversely affected, and the [anti-circumvention] prohibition
contained in [§ 1201(a)(1)(A)] shall not apply to such users
with respect to such classes of works for the ensuing 3-year
period.” There is no analogous provision in § 1201(b). We
impute this lack of symmetry to Congress’ need to balance
copyright owners’ new anti-circumvention right with the pub-
lic’s right to access the work. Cf. H.R. Rep. No. 105-551, pt.
2, at 26 (1998) (specifying that the House Commerce Com-
mittee “endeavored to specify, with as much clarity as possi-
ble, how the right against anti-circumvention (sic) would be
qualified to maintain balance between the interests of content
creators and information users.”). Sections 1201(a)(1)(B)-(D)
thus promote the public’s right to access by allowing the
Library to exempt circumvention of effective access control
measures in particular situations where it concludes that the
public’s right to access outweighs the owner’s interest in
restricting access.
7 In limiting the owner’s right to control
access, the Library does not, and is not permitted to, authorize
infringement of a copyright owner’s traditional exclusive
rights under the copyright. Rather, the Library is only entitled
to moderate the new anti-circumvention right created by, and
hence subject to the limitations in, DMCA § 1201(a)(1).
