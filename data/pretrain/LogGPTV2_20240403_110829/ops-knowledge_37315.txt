User: How to achieve load balancing and failover in distributed systems?
Assistant: In a distributed system, load balancing and failover are two very important aspects because they can improve the performance and reliability of the system. The following are several common methods to achieve load balancing and failover: 1. Load balancing (1) Hardware load balancer: distribute incoming network traffic to multiple servers to ensure that each server is load balanced. (2) Software load balancer: distributes incoming network traffic to multiple application servers to ensure that each server is load balanced. (3) DNS polling: Use DNS servers to return different IP addresses, which correspond to a group of servers, and requests are randomly distributed on these servers. (4) IP dynamic routing: The network switch selects the best path through the load balancing algorithm, and forwards the incoming traffic to different servers. 2. Failover (1) Active/standby mode: Select a primary server and a standby server. When the primary server fails, the standby server will take over the work. (2) Diversified failover: Multiple standby servers are assigned to each service. Once a server fails, the traffic will be automatically transferred to another available server. (3) Cold backup: The standby server does not run while waiting for the primary server to fail. In the event of a primary server failure, a backup server will be brought up and traffic will be passed. (4) Hot backup: The backup server is always running while the main server is running normally, and it can immediately take over the traffic if the main server fails. In short, to achieve load balancing and failover in a distributed system, you need to choose a method that suits your needs, and implement a reliable monitoring and management mechanism to ensure high performance and reliability of the system.
