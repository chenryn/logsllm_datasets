## Why Look for Cyber Threats?

### Aggressive Data Collection
- **Exfiltration of Sensitive User Data to China (Adups):** Adups, a Chinese firm, has been found to exfiltrate sensitive user data from Android devices.
- **Sensitive Data Collection (OnePlus 5):** The OnePlus 5 was discovered to be collecting sensitive user data without proper disclosure.

### Remote System Compromise
- **System Compromise from Insecure Network Communications (Ragentek):** Ragentek, a Chinese software company, was responsible for insecure network communications that led to system compromises.

### User Data Disclosure Due to Vendor Modifications
- **Samsung Leaking Log Data (CVE-2017-7978):** A vulnerability in Samsung devices allowed for the leakage of log data.
- **MediaTek Leaking Log Data (CVE-2016-10135):** MediaTek chipsets were found to leak log data, exposing sensitive information.

### Local Privilege Escalation to the "Root" User
- **Alcatel A30 (Former Amazon Prime Exclusive Device):** This device was vulnerable to local privilege escalation.
- **Leagoo P1:** Similar vulnerabilities were found in the Leagoo P1.
- **Privileged EngineerMode App (OnePlus 5):** The OnePlus 5 included a privileged app that could be exploited for local privilege escalation.
- **Android 4.4 Devices with a MediaTek Chipset:** These devices were also susceptible to local privilege escalation.

## Pre-installed Apps and Vendor OS Modification

### Pre-installed Apps
- **Pre-installed Apps on Android Devices:** These apps may not be available on Google Play and some cannot be disabled.
- **Potential Malicious or Insecure Apps:** Insecure pre-installed apps can be locally or remotely exploited, while malicious apps can provide backdoor functionality and exfiltrate sensitive user data.

### Vendor Modifications
- **Custom Behavior through Modified Code:** Vendors often modify Google’s official Android code to provide custom behavior, which can unintentionally expose sensitive capabilities and privileged platform apps.

## App Components

### Fundamental Functional Blocks
- **Activity, Broadcast Receiver, Service, Content Provider:** These are the fundamental functional blocks of an Android app, declared in the app’s manifest file.
- **Intent Communication:** Intents are message-like abstractions for communication within and between apps, containing intent-specific fields and potentially embedded data.

### Exported Application Components
- **Accessibility and Regulation:** Exported components are accessible to any process on the device, regulated by the `android:exported` and `android:permission` attributes. By default, the Android OS exports components if the `android:exported` attribute is not used and at least one intent-filter is declared.

## DMInstallerService
- **Default Exported Component:** The `DMInstallerService` will be exported by default, making it accessible to other processes on the device.

## Threat Model
- **Low-Privilege Third-Party App Installation:** A low-privilege third-party app can be installed on the device via app repackaging, phishing, or remote exploit. It may need the `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission but does not require any malicious permissions.

## US Carrier Android Devices - Vulnerabilities

### AT&T
- **ZTE Blade Spark:**
  - Write modem and logcat logs to external storage.
- **LG Phoenix 2:**
  - Write logcat logs to the app’s private directory.
  - Lock the user out of their device.

### Verizon
- **Asus ZenFone V Live:**
  - Command execution as the system user.
  - Take and write a screenshot to external storage.
- **ZTE Blade Vantage:**
  - Write modem and logcat logs to external storage.

### Sprint
- **Essential Phone:**
  - Programmatic factory reset.

### T-Mobile
- **Coolpad Defiant:**
  - Send, read, and modify text messages.
  - Programmatic factory reset.
  - Obtain the number of contacts.
- **T-Mobile Revvl Plus (Coolpad):**
  - Same vulnerabilities as the Coolpad Defiant.
- **ZTE ZMAX Pro:**
  - Same vulnerabilities as the Coolpad Defiant.
  - Write modem and logcat logs to external storage.

### Multiple Carriers
- **LG G6:**
  - Lock the user out of their device.
  - Get logcat log and kernel logs.

### Cricket Wireless
- **Coolpad Canvas:**
  - Write logcat log, kernel log, and tcpdump to external storage.
  - Set properties as the phone user.

### Total Wireless
- **ZTE ZMAX Champ:**
  - Write modem and logcat logs to external storage.
  - Programmatic factory reset.
  - Make the device continually crash in recovery mode.

## ZTE - Modem Log and Logcat Log
- **Vulnerability Description:** Any app can access text messages, call data, and logcat logs, activated by any app on the device and transparent to the user.
- **Log Storage:** Logs are written to `/sdcard/sd_logs`, with modem logs stored in qmdl format and logcat logs in plaintext.
- **Affected Devices:** ZTE Blade Spark, ZTE Blade Vantage, ZTE ZMAX Pro, ZTE ZMAX Champ.

## Exposing User Data Through Logcat Logs
- **Third-Party App Limitations:** Since Android 4.1, third-party apps cannot read the system-wide logcat log due to its sensitive nature.
- **Pre-installed App Risks:** Pre-installed apps can expose log data to other apps, generally written to external storage (SD card). Any app with the `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission can read from external storage, including user pictures, downloads, and arbitrary files.

## Sample Data Leaked Through Logcat
- **Data Types:** Login credentials, tokens, text message bodies, phone numbers, GPS coordinates, email addresses, cell tower IDs, MAC addresses, serial numbers, IMEI, IMSI, and URLs.

## LG Vulnerabilities
- **Obtain System-Wide Logcat Log:** Affects LG G6, LG Q6, LG X Power 2, and LG Phoenix 2. Logs can be written to the attacking app’s private directory using path traversal.
- **Lock User Out of Their Device:** Affects the same devices, allowing only emergency calls.
- **Dump Hidden Database:** Affects LG G6 and LG Q6, dumping logcat and kernel logs to external storage.

## Programmatic Factory Reset
- **Description:** A factory reset wipes all user data and apps from the device, facilitated by privileged pre-installed apps. It requires a co-located zero-permission app and no user intervention.
- **Affected Devices:** Essential Phone (Sprint), Coolpad Defiant (T-Mobile), T-Mobile Revvl Plus (T-Mobile), ZTE ZMAX Champ (Total Wireless), Leagoo Z5C (Unlocked), Leagoo P1 (Unlocked), Plum Compass (Unlocked), Orbic Wonder (Unlocked), MXQ TV Box 4.4.2 (N/A).

## Example Code Snippet
```java
private void asus_zenfone_V_live_command_execution_as_system_user() {
    Intent i = new Intent();
    i.setClassName("com.asus.splendidcommandagent", "com.asus.splendidcommandagent.SplendidCommandAgentService");
    SplendidServiceConnection servConn = new SplendidServiceConnection();
    boolean ret = bindService(i, servConn, BIND_AUTO_CREATE);
    Log.i(TAG, "initService() bound with " + ret);
}

class SplendidServiceConnection implements ServiceConnection {
    // Implementation details
}
```

This comprehensive evaluation highlights the various vulnerabilities and risks associated with pre-installed apps and vendor modifications in Android carrier devices.
