Wireless Devices
•
PDA
– Palm & iPAQ
– Strong Growth in 2000 
• Slowly shrinking thereafter
– Renewed interest due to advances
– New suppliers entering the market
•
Converged Devices
– PDA & Phone combined into one
– All the features w/ all the connectivity
– Designed for size not security
•
Wireless (Security) Cameras
•
RFID devices
Defining Wireless Threats

Slide 11
Defcon 11
Defining the wireless threats
•
WarDriving
– Searching and Logging
•
Data Snooping
– Capturing data
•
Jamming
– Disrupting legitimate signals
•
Insertion Attacks
– Unauthorized clients and APs

Defining the wireless threats
•
Malicious Code
– Virus
• A piece of code that can replicate itself
– SMS - URLs & Attachments
– Worm
• A program that can copy itself to other disks
– Masquerades as valid program
– Trojan
• A program that launches other programs or code
– Masquerades as valid program

Emerging threats
•
Liberty Trojan (PLAM) - September 2000
– Deleted applications and was unable to replicate itself
•
Timophonica (Spain) - January 2001
– First automatic dialer
•
911 - April 2001
– Caused phones to repeatedly dial 911
– Sent to over 100,000 phones
•
Flooder - August 2001
– Sends unwanted SMS messages
•
Phage & Vapor – September 2001
– Deleted files and hid applications
Why Malicious Code will spread

Why Malicious Code will spread…
•
In nature, viruses infect all organisms, even the tiniest bacteria.
– Small Pox, Plague, SARS
•
Likewise, computer viruses infect all platforms that reach a any
level of sophistication.
– Melissa, LoveBug, Klez

Four main factors
1) Protection is poor or non-existent
2) Power of new devices
3) Standardization of networks
4) Increased connection of devices

Slide 17
Defcon 11
Protection is poor or non-existent
•
Very little built in protection
– Nokia 9000 series has malicious code protection
•
Data transmissions are protected but unchecked
– Currently no carrier has the ability to scan SMS or MMS 
delivery servers for malicious code.
– Current security only offers limited protection and next to no 
scanning abilities

Slide 18

Power of new devices
•
PDAs are now able to run PC like applications
– Increased power means increased automation
• Automation is often targeted by virus writers.
•
Devices are often synchronized on a regular basis
– Thus opening a door for the spread of malicious code
•
Common language for developing apps
– Makes it easier to create malicious code

Slide 19

Standardization of networks
•
The more standard the easier malicious code will spread
– Same as in the wired world
•
Trend is moving away from proprietary standards and is focusing 
more on TCP/IP related standards
•
Email messaging brought us Melissa and LuvBug
– Standardized wireless networks are sure to do the same

Slide 20

Increased connection of devices
•
More connectivity than ever
– Bluetooth
– WiFi 802.11
– Cellular
•
Allows for multiple ways to the internet and email
•
Increased SMS/MMS popularity and exposure due to links and 
attachments
Economic Impact and Potential Damages
7/13/2002
Slide 22
Defcon 11
Damages
•
Users receive unwanted messages
•
Some devices send unwanted messages
•
Data in devices is erased, deleted or stolen
•
Device becomes unusable
•
Network slowdowns (congestion)
•
Network performance suffers
•
Network intrusion
7/13/2002
Slide 23

Impact
•
Customer complaints
•
Higher turnover from unhappy customers
•
Cost from unwanted traffic
– May not be just dollars
•
Dropped calls
•
Un-infecting or cleaning devices & servers/network
•
Purchasing new technology

So what needs to be done?

Slide 26

Protecting against malicious threats
•
Protection must be implemented at every point possible
– Devices, Switches, Towers, COs, etc.
•
Mobile operators need to start offering scanning services to their 
clients and need to start scanning their servers and data streams.
•
Delivering a solution now rather than latter could save millions of 
dollars in lost revenue and expenses.
– AV Vendors need to start step up to the plate
•
Mobile operators and device manufactures need to have plans for 
addressing thousands if not millions of simultaneous infections on 
their networks.

Conclusion
•
Top four reasons malicious code will spread
1. Current protection of wireless networks/devices is minimal
2. Increased computing power
3. Standardization
4. Growing connectivity
•
Not changing security could result in large economic losses
–
$471 Million per 5 Million users estimated for 2005
•
Mobile Operators, Administrators, Manufactures and Developers 
should act now and think proactively in a effort to better protect 
their systems.
