User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Cisco Asa 5506 Public IP's in DMZ I am running an ASA 5506 (9.6).
I have two IP Ranges 1.35.133.88/29 and 1.35.135.176/29.
I have setup in my router the routes.
I have an outside interface with 1.35.133.90.
I have an DMZ interface with 1.35.135.178.

Below you can find the configuration:

I want to use public IP addresses on the hosts, but I cannot figure why it is failing. If I run a ping command from my Cisco C881 Router it does not retreive the public IP Address through the ASA. 

What am I doing wrong here?

Assistant: Ok, I have found the problem to all the issues. The ISP routed the 2nd IP range to their WAN Address instead of to the internal ASA gateway.
