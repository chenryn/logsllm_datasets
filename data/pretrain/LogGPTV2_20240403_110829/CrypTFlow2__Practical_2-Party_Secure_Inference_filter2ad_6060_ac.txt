3 MILLIONAIRES’ AND DReLU PROTOCOLS
In this section, we provide our protocols for millionaires’ problem
and DReLU(𝑎) when the inputs are ℓ bit signed integers as well as
elements in general rings of the form Z𝑛 (including prime fields).
Our protocol for millionaires’ problem invokes instances of FAND
that take as input boolean shares of values 𝑥, 𝑦 ∈ {0, 1} and returns
boolean shares of 𝑥 ∧ 𝑦. We discuss efficient protocols for FAND in
Appendix A.1 and A.2.
3.1 Protocol for Millionaires’
In the Yao millionaires’ problem, party 𝑃0 holds 𝑥 and party 𝑃1
holds 𝑦 and they wish to learn boolean shares of 1{𝑥 
2ℓ−1 − 1}. Then, MSB(𝑎) = msb0 ⊕ msb1 ⊕ carry. We compute
boolean shares of carry by invoking an instance of F ℓ−1
MILL.

Communication complexity In Algorithm 2, we communicate the
same as in Πℓ−1
MILL, that is < (𝜆 + 14)(ℓ − 1) by using 𝑚 = 4.
