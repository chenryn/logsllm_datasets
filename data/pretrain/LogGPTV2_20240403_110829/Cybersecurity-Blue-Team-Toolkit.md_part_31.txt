interviewing that person.
One of the best tools we have in social engineering is to smile. Smiling
has been shown to be a psychological signal of altruism. Altruism is the
concept that you want to help others because of a concern for their
happiness, not your own. Smiling even makes you look younger, giving you
a mini facelift because it lifts your cheeks, jowls, and neck. Every
time you smile, dopamine, []{#c13.xhtml#Page_190 .pagebreak title="190"
role="doc-pagebreak"}endorphins, and serotonin throw a little party in
your brain. For most people, smiles are contagious, so they respond to a
smile with a smile of their own, having their own little brain party,
making you seem likable and competent. Try it. The next time you have to
deal with a difficult person, make eye contact and smile.
As for consensus, marketing and politicians do this all the time. Ninety
percent of dentists recommend this toothpaste. If you\'re a good and
intelligent person like us, you will vote this way. When individuals
don't have a strong opinion, they can be easily swayed and follow
others. In cybersecurity, it can be dangerous for people to trust but
not verify.
"Trust, but verify" is an old Russian proverb. The phrase became popular
during the late 1980s when U.S. President Ronald Reagan was negotiating
nuclear disarmament with the Soviet Union\'s General Secretary Mikhail
Gorbachev. I believe it fits the mind‐set of a cybersecurity
professional. When an outcome matters more than a relationship, you have
to trust, but verify. In IT, safety and security are of utmost
importance with outcome‐critical parameters. If a relationship matters
more than an outcome, then this philosophy doesn\'t fit as well.
To add to Professor Caildini\'s six principles of persuasion, when you
are crafting a social engineering campaign, there are six human truths I
have learned over the past 20 years. These have helped me social
engineer both professionally and personally.
-   [Most people want to be helpful.]{#c13.xhtml#c13-li-0011}
-   [Humans want instant gratification.]{#c13.xhtml#c13-li-0012}
-   [Never use the words "obviously" and "but."]{#c13.xhtml#c13-li-0013}
-   [The brain wants ease and order and dislikes
    change.]{#c13.xhtml#c13-li-0014}
-   [Most people, including my students, have a limited attention
    span.]{#c13.xhtml#c13-li-0015}
-   [Humans respond to beauty and emotion.]{#c13.xhtml#c13-li-0016}
Men have dominated my cybersecurity classes over the past 20 years. I
have not kept up with the numbers, but in my personal experience, I\'m
lucky to have one female in up to 20 men in a technical class. Men
dominate the ranks of developers, administrators, researchers, and
hackers. Chris Hadnagy of
[Social‐Engineer.org](http://Social-Engineer.org) and one of my favorite
authors says, "Unfortunately, there is a chauvinist consensus that
females don\'t get security. The truth is, as social engineers, women do
better. We\'ve seen hacktivists like Anonymous and LulzSec use females
as part of their attacks."
David Kennedy, founder of TrustedSec and DerbyCon, says because of this
attitude in our culture, women aren\'t thought to be technical or
disingenuous. He also says it is helpful to have a Southern accent. A
Southern accent is []{#c13.xhtml#Page_191 .pagebreak title="191"
role="doc-pagebreak"}synonymous with warmth and hospitality, whereas a
New York accent can be fast and harsh. It is my goal one day to
participate in the Social Engineering CTF in Vegas. As a technically
adequate female who was born and raised in Louisiana, I feel that I have
a bit of an advantage, especially if I ask for help. I have had the
doors held for me in a secure location because I had my arms full of
books, ignoring the RFID badge reader and the mantrap.
Humans want instant gratification. We are hardwired to want what we want
without any delay or denial. It\'s evolutionary. Humans survive when
they take the smaller reward but skip the bigger yet delayed reward. If
you have children, experiment with them. They can have this one
marshmallow now, but if they can wait 5 minutes, they can have two. Mine
never wait for two.
I met Deidre Diamond about a year ago when she gave the keynote at EC
Councils Hacker Halter conference in Atlanta. In her keynote, she said
we have to choose our words with care. There was a list of several words
you ought not to use, but the two that burned into my brain are
"obviously" and "but." Try using "obviously" in a sentence and not sound
condescending. If you are attempting a role that is arrogant or
patronizing, by all means it might work for you. She also suggested
using "and" instead of "but." No one hears anything past "but." "I love
this idea, but can we do this instead?" That sentence sounds a lot
different than "I love this idea, and what do you think about this
instead?" "But" will start an argument or stop the conversation. "And"
will engage.
The brain wants ease and order and dislikes change. I think this becomes
even more pronounced the older we get. If you are attempting a social
engineering campaign, you have to build it around something that is
believable and not out of the ordinary.
Most people, including my students, have a limited attention span. When
I was studying for my CompTIA Certified Technical Trainer certification,
my instructor told the class that we had 20 minutes to engage students
with a lecture before they started thinking about what was for dinner or
what movie they were going to this weekend. If you need someone\'s
attention for more than 20 minutes, you will have to change the
delivery. In training, we can show a video or give a hands‐on exercise.
In penetration testing, you don\'t normally want a long personal
engagement. You want to get in, do what you need to do, and get out.
Humans respond to beauty and emotion. I believe this is
self‐explanatory. People are attracted to what they find beautiful or
what makes them feel great emotion. The movie *Oceans 8* made me chuckle
when Rhianna social‐engineered the video security engineer with a
compromised site about the Wheaten breed of dogs. I\'m not sure I could
drop a Meterpreter shell as fast as she did in the movie and turn on his
webcam, but yes, that\'s exactly how it\'s done. Appeal to your targets'
interests, what they feel is beautiful, and you have a great start to a
campaign.[]{#c13.xhtml#Page_192 .pagebreak title="192"

## Human Attacks {#c13.xhtml#head-2-98}
Before I talk about different type of social engineering attacks, I
would like to take a quote from Chris Hadnagy's book, *The Science of
Human Hacking*. He says, "A professional social engineer\'s goal is to
educate and assist rather than humiliate to win." The whole purpose of
this chapter is for you to understand the way most people make decisions
and how to help organizations educate their end users how to recognize
if someone is trying to take advantage of them for gain. Education and
training is one of the most important things you can do to secure your
organization, but unfortunately, one of the first things to get cut out
of a budget.
If you are doing any social engineering campaign, just like any
penetration test, it must be documented and permission must be given.
You also have to be careful with any type of impersonation. I had a
student take my Metasploit class as a result of a decision he made to
internally phish his organization and impersonate a three‐letter agency.
The campaign was discovered because the comptroller of the company he
worked for was married to an agent for this three‐letter agency. She
made a phone call to ask him if the agency was indeed being audited.
Phishing is one of the most popular ways to gain access into an
organization. Through open‐source intelligence (OSINT), you know who
works for the organization and the positions they are in. You know from
different press releases what the company is excited about. Sometimes
penetration testers use phishing for knowledge and sometimes for gain.
If we are able to compromise a system with stolen credentials from a
phish because we successfully extracted information from an end user, we
can attempt to elevate those privileges to administrative levels, just
like a bad actor would. The purpose of this type of phishing test is to
leverage what we can find into what else we can find. Phishing will
often take advantage of things going on either within the organization
or other popular current events or disasters.
Vishing (voice phishing) is still popular, which surprises me. I never
answer the phone. In fact, most people will text me if they are about to
call me. Vishers use the telephone to gain access to personal or
financial information. One vish I have seen in the news lately targets
older people with college‐age grandchildren. With enough OSINT,
criminals know enough to impersonate the grandchild and call the
grandparent because they\'ve gotten into trouble and need them to send
money. If the grandchild is off to school, odds are the parents are not
in constant contact. Smishing (social media phishing) sends a text
message to a mobile phone to attempt to gain access to personal
information with the same intention as phishing or
vishing.[]{#c13.xhtml#Page_193 .pagebreak title="193"

## Education {#c13.xhtml#head-2-99}
Criminals are familiar with human nature. They will use whatever is in
their arsenal to attack your organization and the people who work with
you. No one who interacts with others is immune. You must educate your
end users to
-   [Be very suspicious of any phone calls, visits, or email messages
    that they did not initiate. If you get requests for information
    about other employees, try to verify the identity of the requesters.
    If it\'s legitimate, they will provide credentials. If they have
    malicious intent, they will usually give up and try to find easier
    prey.]{#c13.xhtml#c13-li-0017}
-   [Do not ever reveal personal or financial information in email, and
    do not respond to email solicitations requesting this information.
    This includes clicking the links sent in an email. Banks will never
    ask for your PIN. The IRS will never call
    you.]{#c13.xhtml#c13-li-0018}
-   [Pay close attention to the URL of a website linked in the email or
    SMS message. Malicious websites may look very similar to a
    legitimate site. If you know the URL of the site they want you to
    visit, type it in yourself. Do not click the
    link.]{#c13.xhtml#c13-li-0019}
-   [If you are unsure whether an email request is legitimate, forward
    it to your IT incident and response team. Do not use contact
    information provided on a website connected to the
    request.]{#c13.xhtml#c13-li-0020}
-   [Install and maintain antivirus software, firewalls, and email
    filters.]{#c13.xhtml#c13-li-0021}
-   [Block ads and pop‐ups whenever possible. When you click an ad, you
    are susceptible to a number of attacks like downloading malware or
    clickjacking.]{#c13.xhtml#c13-li-0022}
Another of my favorite resources is Lance Spitzner, director of SANS
Security Awareness. He says, "People are not the weakest link today,
they are the most common attack vector." One of the biggest takeaways
that SANS offers to everyone are its OUCH! newsletters. If you have not
subscribed, then I highly recommend you put this book down long enough
to Google ***SANS OUCH!*** OUCH! is a free security‐awareness newsletter
designed for everyone, not just IT professionals. These newsletters are
published every month in multiple languages and are scrupulously
reviewed by other SANS instructors. You can go back several years or
search for a specific category.
A couple years back, I was tasked with coming up with some security
awareness training for a software security company I worked for. I would
print out the SANS OUCH! newsletters and put them above the coffee pot
in the breakroom, on the mirror between the sinks in the bathroom, or
above the copier. I put them []{#c13.xhtml#Page_194 .pagebreak
title="194" role="doc-pagebreak"}wherever I knew people congregated or
were a captive audience. Every other month, I would have a contest that
would involve some of the information in the newsletter, and the reward
could be a day off or some type of recognition. People started paying
attention. When IT periodically phished our internal employees, they
recognized the telltale signs and were able to send that phishing to the
proper authorities at the company.
If you think you\'ve been a victim of a social engineering campaign and
have revealed sensitive information, report it to the right
people---including network administrators. They have tools and can be on
the alert for any suspicious behavior. If you believe you have financial
accounts that have been compromised, contact that organization
immediately. Close that account and watch for anything unexplainable.
Watch your credit reports for any accounts that are opened that you did
not authorize. I have my credit and my children\'s credit accounts
locked down. Unfortunately, I was a victim a few years ago in the U.S.
Office of Personnel Management hack, and in my clearance paperwork was
all the personally identifiable information about my family.
Lastly, password hygiene is a fiercely debated topic in IT. If you think
you\'re compromised, immediately change any passwords you might have
revealed. If you use the same password on multiple sites for different
accounts, change those as well, and don\'t ever use that password again.
Some sites require the password to be a certain length with uppercase,
lowercase, and special characters. Some people swear by using password
managers like LastPass, Keeper, and Dashlane. A password manager is a
tool that does the work of creating and remembering all the passwords
for your accounts. For me, it sounds great but is a single point of
failure.
To make accounts safer, you should make sure your passwords are
-   [Long and complicated. Ideally, your password should be totally
    randomized with uppercase and lowercase letters, making it very
    difficult to remember. Try to create a long password out of one of
    your favorite books---for example,
    Wh0i\$J0hnG@1t!]{#c13.xhtml#c13-li-0023}
-   [Do not write them down or use birthdays.]{#c13.xhtml#c13-li-0024}
-   [Always use multifactor authentication, whenever
    possible.]{#c13.xhtml#c13-li-0025}
-   [Don\'t be too terribly social on social media. Nearly 90 million
    Facebook accounts had their profile information shared by
    researchers using a third‐party quiz app. If you aren\'t paying for
    it, you are the product. Nothing is ever truly private on social
    media.]{#c13.xhtml#c13-li-0026}
Lastly, if you have chosen to create your passwords yourself, you do
have another option. A friend of mine, Michael Hawkins of Wantegrity,
has a site he built especially for his customers but has made it
available to anyone who would like to play with it. If you visit
`www.wantegrity.com/passwords.php`, you can use your regular‐sized
normal password as the master key and the account you are
[]{#c13.xhtml#Page_195 .pagebreak title="195" role="doc-pagebreak"}using
it on as the site key. As you see in [Figure
13.1](#c13.xhtml#c13-fig-0001){#c13.xhtml#R_c13-fig-0001}, you enter
your password and account and generate a unique complicated password for
that credential pair. If you\'re concerned about password‐harvesting,
right‐click and review the code. What\'s typed on the page stays on the
page.

## The Social Engineer Toolkit {#c13.xhtml#head-2-100}
According to the global statistics provided by `gs.statcounter.com` (see
[Figure 13.2](#c13.xhtml#c13-fig-0002){#c13.xhtml#R_c13-fig-0002}),
70.22 percent of all global desktop users are using Windows---more than
50 percent of those users are on Windows 10, and interestingly enough,
2.22 percent are on Windows XP. According to this graph, there are more
global users of Windows XP than Linux, statistically speaking. I have
done my best to show you mainly tools of the Windows persuasion.
However, we\'ve gotten to a tool that only runs on Linux and macOS. But
I may have a few tricks.

Windows 10 has an interesting tool called the Windows Subsystem for
Linux (WSL). It is a compatibility layer for running a Linux‐compatible
kernel interface that can then run GNU on top of it. GNU is actually not
an acronym---it is an antelope this project was named after. GNU is an
operating system composed wholly of free software like Ubuntu, openSUSE,
Debian, or Kali Linux. This type of user space will allow you to use a
bash shell or programming languages like Ruby or Python.
