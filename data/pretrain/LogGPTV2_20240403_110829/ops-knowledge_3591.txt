User: Is there a way to compile a Python .py file from the command-line without executing it?
I am working with an application that stores its python extensions in a non-standard path with  limited permissions and I'd like to compile the files during installation.  I don't need the overhead of Distutils.
Assistant: $ python -c "import py_compile; py_compile.compile('yourfile.py')"
or
$ python -c "import py_compile; py_compile.compileall('dir')"
