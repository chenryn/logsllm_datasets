### Electron Version
15.1.0
### What operating system are you using?
Ubuntu
### Operating System Version
ubuntu 18.04
### What arch are you using?
x64
### Last Known Working Electron version
15.0.0
### Expected Behavior
When invoking a context-menu event on the webcontents of a webview in the
renderer process, the function works and does not give an error.
### Actual Behavior
Since #30831 `frame` is sent along with the params, but `frame` is not
serializable so can not cross from the main process to the renderer process.
This results in an error being shown to the user.
### Testcase Gist URL
_No response_
### Additional Information
I'm aware that getting the webContents in the renderer process (using
@electron/remote) is an antipattern. Still, I feel this is something we should
not break in a minor release.
