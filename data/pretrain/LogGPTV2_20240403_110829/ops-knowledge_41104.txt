User: Please give a crawler program based on Python to crawl the information of a specified website and perform data analysis.
Assistant: The following is a crawler program based on Python, which is used to crawl the questions and answers under the Python label on the Zhihu website, and perform data analysis: ``` import requests from bs4 import BeautifulSoup import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Crawl the questions and answers under the Python label on Zhihu url = "https://www.zhihu.com/topic/19552832/hot" response = requests.get(url) soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, " html.parser") questions = soup.find_all("div", class_="QuestionItem") # data processing, save questions, answers, likes and other information to dataframe data = [] for question in questions: q_title = question.find("a", class_="question_link").text.strip() q_link = "https://www.zhihu.com" + question.find("a", class_="question_link")[" href"] q_answer_count = question.find("div", class_="AnswerItem").find("button", class_="Button--plain").text.strip() q_follow_count = question.find("div" , class_="QuestionItem-meta").find_all("div")[1].text.strip() answers = question.find_all("div", class_="ContentItem AnswerItem") for answer in answers: a_content = answer .find("div", class_="RichContent-inner").text.strip() a_vote_count = answer.find("button", class_="Button VoteButton VoteButton--up").find("span", class_ ="count").text.strip() data.append([q_title, q_link, q_follow_count, q_answer_count, a_content, a_vote_count]) df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=["Question Title", "Question Link", "Number of questions followed", "Number of answers to questions", "Answer content", "Number of likes for answers"]) # Count the number of questions, the number of answers, the number of likes and other information, and perform data visualization print("Python tags share %d questions, %d answers, %d likes" % (len(df["question title"].unique()), len(df), df["answer likes"].sum( ))) df_count = pd.DataFrame({"Number of Questions": [len(df["Question Title"].unique())], "Number of Answers": [len(df)], "Number of Likes": [df["answer likes"].sum()]}) ax = df_count.plot(kind="bar") ax.set_xticklabels(["statistics"]) plt.xticks(rotation=0) plt.show () ``` This program uses the requests library to send HTTP requests, uses the BeautifulSoup library to parse the HTML, then uses the pandas library to convert the data into dataframe format, and finally uses the matplotlib library for visual analysis of the data. This program can crawl the questions and answers under the Python label on Zhihu, and count the number of questions, answers, likes and other information, and present them visually.
