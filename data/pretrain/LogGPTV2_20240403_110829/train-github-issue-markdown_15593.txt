Subject: Assistance Required - Celery Not Responding After Restart

Dear Team,

I am currently using Celery version 3.1.2 (Cipater) along with Kombu 3.0.21. Recently, I encountered an issue where Celery was in a hung state. In an attempt to resolve this, I tried to restart the service. However, after the restart, Celery produced the following log output and subsequently stopped responding:

```

Traceback (most recent call last):

```

Could someone please advise on how to properly restart Celery without having to kill the process? Any insights or solutions would be greatly appreciated.
