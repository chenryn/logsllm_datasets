### Recommendations and Findings

1. **Key Management**: 
   - Developers are advised to retrieve keys from remote servers [3]. Without dynamic analysis, we could not infer their values. Some apps use cryptographic functions to protect strings, which static analysis cannot resolve.

2. **Vulnerability Identification**:
   - With the identified keys and strings, our third component, Vulnerability Identification, detects vulnerabilities based on zero-data-leakage policies. A total of 17,299 vulnerabilities were identified. Note that one app may have multiple data leakage vulnerabilities, counted based on the vulnerable services.

3. **Key Misuse Vulnerabilities**:
   - These vulnerabilities primarily exist in Azure and AWS clouds. In Azure, 186 out of 907 non-obfuscated apps (20.51%) and 30 out of 216 obfuscated apps (13.89%) misused keys. For AWS, 477 out of 5,988 non-obfuscated apps (7.97%) and 92 out of 798 obfuscated apps (11.53%) misused root keys.

4. **Permission Misconfiguration Vulnerabilities**:
   - This type of vulnerability is mainly found in AWS and Firebase. For AWS, 916 out of 5,988 non-obfuscated apps (15.30%) and 195 out of 798 obfuscated apps (24.44%) had misconfigured "Open" S3 storage. For Firebase, 5,166 out of 80,087 non-obfuscated apps (6.45%) and 1,214 out of 21,293 obfuscated apps (5.70%) had an "Open" database. Additionally, 6,855 out of 80,087 non-obfuscated apps (8.56%) and 2,168 out of 21,293 obfuscated apps (10.18%) lacked permission checks.

### Severity Analysis

- We studied the severity of the vulnerabilities by analyzing the number of downloads of the vulnerable apps. The higher the number of downloads, the more severe the vulnerability. For very popular apps (over one million downloads), 569 were subject to data leakage attacks. Among these, 10 had 100 million to 500 million downloads, 14 had 50 million to 100 million, and 80 had 10 million to 50 million. If exploited, billions of sensitive data records could be leaked.

### Obfuscation vs. Non-Obfuscation

- We observed that obfuscation is typically applied to top-downloaded apps. As shown in Table VII, the higher the number of downloads, the more likely the app is to be obfuscated.
