Figures 19.08 through 19.34 on the following pages display the results from these providers when searching 
Wrigley Field in Chicago, using the search tool to generate each result. Remember to allow pop-ups within your 
browser if you want all of die data to populate within new tabs automatically.
The first portion of this tool allows entry of a physical address in traditional format which can execute several 
searches previously mentioned. The first field presents a mapping API page which includes the GPS coordinates 
of your target. These will be used in the second portion of the page. This area allows entry of GPS coordinates 
for several mapping options. The "Populate All" simplifies entry into the query' options. Each search will open 
results in a new tab, or the final "Submit AH" will display all satellite imagery’ from multiple providers within new 
tabs. It currently fetches images from all options mentioned in this chapter which allow a static URL with GPS 
tor submission. Figure 19.07 displays a partial view of the tool. I use it during practically every investigation 
where satellite views have relevance. Having multiple unique views of an individual location would have seemed 
unimaginable in decades past. Today, we take it for granted.

Map Shadows
322 Chapter 19
If you look closely at the previous images, you can see many shadows. We can use these to make a guess at the 
date and time of capture. In fact, analyzing shadows within any images, even those which do not originate with 
satellite imagery, can help identify the date and time of capture. There is no exact science to this (yet), but we 
have online tools available to assist our efforts. Consider the image in Figure 19.32 above. The shadow of Wrigley 
Field is due west of the building and does not appear to project north or south of the building. We can use 
Shade Map (shademap.app) to identify the most likelv date and time of this satellite capture. After loading the 
site, search for Wrigley Field and allow the location to load. Next, we can begin manipulating the map.

While this book is printed with black ink, hopefully you can match the overall shadows. Replicate this on your 
own computer to see the true value. This technique could also be used when you identify a photograph posted 
to social media. If you know the approximate location and time of year, it should be fairly easy to establish the 
approximate time of capture.

Click the date in the lower-left and drag the month bar until the shadows seem to match the horizontal position 
within our target image in Figure 19.32. In my attempts, the month of March displayed shadows which did not 
extend north or south of the building at an angle. This month displayed shadows which extended directly cast 
and west. Next, choose the time of day which matches the position of the shadows. My attempts identified 6:28 
am Mountain (7:28 am Central) as the ideal match. Therefore, my best guess is that the satellite image captured 
in this example was approximately 7:30 am local time in late March. Figure 19.35 displays my result. I would 
never document an assumption of an exact date and time, but a range could be appropriate. Documenting that 
the shadows indicate capture between February and April from 7:00 to 8:00 am could suffice.
The default view of your new map at Scribble Maps will display the entire world and a menu of basic options. I 
close this menu by clicking the small "x" in the upper right corner. You can then manually zoom into an area of 
interest or type in an address in the location bar at the top of the map. This will present you with a manageable 
area of the map. The lower right corner will allow you to switch from a traditional map view’ to a satellite or 
hybrid view’.
The default view of mapping sen ices such as Google and Bing may be enough for your situation. Occasionally, 
you may want to modify or customize a map for your needs. Law enforcement may want to create a map to be 
used in a court case; a private investigator may want to customize a map to present to a client, or a security 
director may want to use this sen-ice to document the inappropriate Tweets that were found during the previous 
instructions. Scribble Maps offers one of the easiest ways to create your own map and add any type of visual 
aids to the final product.

The menu at the top of the map will allow you to add shapes, lines, text, and images to your map. Practicing on 
this map can never be replaced with any instruction printed here. Mastering the basics of this application will 
make occasional use of it easy. Figure 19.36 displays a quick sample map that shows a title, a line, a marker, and 
graphics. The menu can be seen in the upper left portion. When finished, the "Menu" button will present many 
options to print, save, or export your map. 1 also highly recommend Free Map Tools (freemaptools.com). This 
service provides multiple advanced options such as mapping a radius around a point of interest.

If you wanted to search for a specific person's name within any spreadsheets, such as John Doe, you would type 
the following single query’.
DOC, DOCX
XLS, XLSX, CSV
PPT, PPTX
PDF
TXT, RTF
ODT, ODS, ODG, ODP

If you wanted to search all of these file types at once, the following string in Google or Bing would find most 
documents on the topic of OSINT. You could change that term to anything else of interest.
If you wanted to locate all documents that reference a specific topic, you can use the filetype operator without 
a specific website listed. An example of a search query’ for all Excel spreadsheets that contain the acronym 
OSINT would be the following.
A very’ basic way of locating documents that are publicly available on a specific website, or related to a specific 
topic, is to use Google. The "filetype:" (or easier "ext:") search operators previously explained can be used for 
this task. An example of search queries for all Microsoft Word documents stored on the domain of 
inteltechniques.com would be the following.
The following table includes the most common document file types and the associated file extensions. As 
previously explained, both Google and Bing are capable of searching any file type regardless of the file 
association. Remember that Bing demands "filetype" while Google seems to prefer "ext". Please note that this 
is a partial list, and 1 identify new possibilities constantly.
The open source intelligence discussed up to this point has focused on websites which include valuable 
information about a target. A category’ of intelligence that is often missed during OSINT research is documents. 
This type of data usually falls into one of three classes. The first is documents that include information about 
the target within the contents of the file. These can include online PDF files that the target may not know exist 
The second class is documents that were actually’ created by the target. These files can make their way into public 
view unintentionally. Finally, the third class includes the metadata stored within a document that can include 
vital information about the true source of the document. The following techniques explain manual searching 
and retrieving of these documents and automated software solutions for analysis of found content

In 2013, Google began placing some user generated documents on the "drive.google.com" domain. Therefore, 
any search that you conduct with the method described previously should be repeated with "drive" in place of 
"docs". The previous search for the telephone number would be the following.
users take advantage of Google's free service for document storage called Google 
a document is created, it is private by default and not visible to the public. 
However, when people want to share documents with friends or coworkers, the sharing properties must be 
changed. While it is possible to privately share files with individual Google users, many people find it easier to 
make the documents public. Most of these users probably assume that the files will not be seen by anyone other 
than the intended recipients. After all, who would go out searching for other people's documents? We will.
The Google Docs and Google Drive websites do not offer the option to search these public files, but you can 
do this using Google search. Now that Google allows search engines to index most of the public files, you 
should be able to find them with some specific search methods. The following search examples will explain a 
few of the options that would be conducted on google.com. The exact search is listed with the expected result 
These should be used as a starting point for the many possibilities of document searching.
The idea of storing user created documents on the internet is gaining a lot of popularity. Keeping these files "in 
the cloud" eliminates the need for personal storage on a device such as a CD or flash drive. In addition, storing 
files on the internet allows the author to access and edit them from any computer with an internet connection. 
A common use of these document-hosting sites is to store them only during the editing phase. Once the 
document is finished and no longer needed, the user may forget to remove it from public view. Google is one 
of the most popular document storage websites. It allows users to embed the stored documents into their own 
websites if desired. Searching the site is relatively easy.
"OSINT" filetype:pdf OR filetypeidoc OR filetype:xls OR filetype:xlsx OR filetype:docx OR filetype:ppt OR 
filetype:pptx OR filetypeiwpd OR filetype:txt
This query basically tells the search engine to look for any reference to the term OSINT inside of a PD1‘, 
Microsoft Word, and other documents, and display all of die results. The Google Custom Search Engine (CSE) 
described in Chapter Nine is a great resource for this exact type of search. However, I highly recommend having 
an understanding of the manual search process. It will give you much more control than any automated solution. 
Additionally, Google CSEs limit the number of results. Therefore, I no longer recommend exclusively relying 
on it for a Document search. It simply cannot compete with a properly structured Google or " 
custom search tools presented at the end of the chapter will further simplify all of this.

This is Google's response to Amazon's AWS. It is a premium file storage web service for storing and accessing 
data on the Google Cloud Platform infrastructure. It is heavily used by all types of businesses and tech-sawy 
individuals. The number of publicly available sensitive documents is growing at an alarming rate. Below are a 
few examples.
Similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Docs offers that ability to store and share documents. The sendee is not as 
popular as Google Drive. However, there are thousands of publicly visible documents waiting to be found. The 
shared files are stored on the docs.microsoft.com domain. A query for resumes would be as follows. This search 
could be conducted on Google or Bing. The result on Google was 63,400 resume files with personal information.
