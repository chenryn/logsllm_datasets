### Online Maps

Figures 19.08 through 19.34 on the following pages display the results from various providers when searching for Wrigley Field in Chicago using the search tool. Ensure that pop-ups are allowed in your browser to automatically open all data in new tabs.

#### Search Tool Features
1. **Physical Address Entry:**
   - Enter a physical address in traditional format to execute multiple searches.
   - The first field presents a mapping API page with GPS coordinates of your target.

2. **GPS Coordinates Entry:**
   - Use the GPS coordinates in the second portion of the page for various mapping options.
   - The "Populate All" feature simplifies the entry into query options.
   - Each search will open results in a new tab, or you can use "Submit All" to display all satellite imagery from multiple providers in new tabs.

### Analyzing Shadows in Satellite Imagery

If you look closely at the images, you can see many shadows. These can help estimate the date and time of capture. While there is no exact science to this yet, online tools like Shade Map (shademap.app) can assist in identifying the most likely date and time.

#### Example: Wrigley Field
- **Shadow Analysis:**
  - The shadow of Wrigley Field is due west of the building, indicating a specific time of day.
  - Use Shade Map to identify the most likely date and time by matching the shadows.
  - For the example in Figure 19.32, the best guess is that the satellite image was captured around 7:30 am local time in late March.

### Customizing Maps with Scribble Maps

2. **Zoom and Navigate:**
   - Manually zoom into an area of interest or type an address in the location bar at the top of the map.
   - Switch from a traditional map view to a satellite or hybrid view using the lower right corner options.

3. **Add Visual Aids:**
   - Use the top menu to add shapes, lines, text, and images to your map.
