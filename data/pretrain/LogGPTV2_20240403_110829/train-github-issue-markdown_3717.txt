I get these errors pretty frequently:
    Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded /Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/node_modules/emissary/lib/behavior.js:44
EDIT: Restarting atom fixes this, of course. Thankfully, I'm still able to
save my files too. I just can't really move the cursor or select text anymore.
