According to the golang-nuts discussion, I am attempting to set up vendoring with submodules as per the guidelines in s/go15vender. While the building process works without issues, I'm encountering a problem with the "go get" command.

To illustrate the issue, I created a test repository by following these steps:

1. Created a new test package.
2. Added a submodule using the command:
   ```
   git submodule add https://github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go vendor/github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go
   ```
3. Committed all changes.

When executing the following command:
```
GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=1 go get github.com/StephanDollberg/govendorsubmodulestest
```

I receive the following error message:
```
# cd .; git --git-dir=/$GOPATH/src/github.com/StephanDollberg/govendorsubmodulestest/.git submodule update --init --recursive
No submodule mapping found in .gitmodules for path 'vendor/github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go'
package github.com/StephanDollberg/govendorsubmodulestest: exit status 1
```

Interestingly, if I run `go get -u` after this, the submodule is checked out correctly. Based on the error and my examination of the Go command's source code, it seems that the `--git-dir` flag might not be compatible with the submodule command.

I have tested this on Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux (all 64-bit Intel) using Go version 1.5.1 and various Git versions (2.3, 2.4, 2.5).
