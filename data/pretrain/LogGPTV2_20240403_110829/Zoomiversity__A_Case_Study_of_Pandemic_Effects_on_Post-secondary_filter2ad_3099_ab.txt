### 3.3 Active Measurement
Active measurement involves establishing connections and sending data packets to identify entities in the network, characterize traffic, or measure various metrics. In this study, we employed active measurement techniques to identify hosts and servers associated with organizations and autonomous systems under investigation, as well as their traffic attributes, such as port numbers. This information is crucial for network traffic measurement and workload characterization studies.

For our purposes, we conducted simple experiments using basic network tools like `nslookup` and `traceroute`, and captured packet-level traffic using Wireshark. We then analyzed the captured logs to extract required fields, such as IP addresses associated with the target organizations and the port numbers used by applications. This information can also be utilized in passive measurement when needed.

### 3.4 Challenges and Limitations
As with any network traffic measurement study, there are several challenges and limitations that affect the completeness of our data and, consequently, the interpretation of results. We discuss these issues below.

**Visibility of Traffic:**
Our monitoring infrastructure is configured to observe traffic strictly between the university and the Internet. It does not capture traffic that remains entirely within the campus network (e.g., a student in residence connecting to an internal server) or traffic that is completely external (e.g., a home user directly accessing Netflix). The pandemic has altered the visibility into Internet usage by our campus community. Some previously invisible traffic (e.g., accessing a university web server while at work) is now visible when people work and learn from home. Conversely, some previously visible traffic (e.g., YouTube accessed from the campus WiFi network) is no longer visible when users directly access the Internet from home. For VPN, remote users obtain a campus IP address from the BYOD subnet, which contributes to both incoming and outgoing connection counts as seen by the monitor.

**Data Collection Disruptions:**
Another challenge arises from unexpected events that disrupt data collection. During the 2020 study period, several such incidents occurred, including aggressive scanning attacks (horizontal and vertical) that exhausted the memory resources on our monitor, causing system crashes. These outages are evident in several time-series graphs presented in the paper.

To mitigate this problem, we disabled the scanning module in Zeek and reconfigured our monitor to perform a software restart every three hours. While this strategy prevents substantial data loss due to crashes, it limits visibility into long-duration connections. We experimented with shorter (one hour) and longer (six hours) restart intervals, ultimately settling on six-hour intervals starting in July 2020 (see Appendix for more details). The effects of these configuration changes are also apparent in several of our traffic plots.

**Videoconferencing Applications:**
Unlike on-site proprietary solutions, we have limited information about the infrastructure and behavior of videoconferencing applications. In many cases, we had to reverse-engineer their behavior based on available documents. Additionally, their deployments may have changed during the pandemic. However, given the widespread adoption and availability of these applications, our analysis and results should be generalizable to other similar environments.

Despite these issues, we believe our empirical dataset offers significant research value. Where appropriate, we exercise caution in interpreting results and contextualize them accordingly.

### 3.5 Ethical Considerations
Permission to capture network traffic data was authorized through the ethics review process at UCalgary and was carried out in cooperation with the IT center. Our network monitor is housed in a secure data center with restricted physical access. A limited amount of traffic data is stored on the monitor at any given time, with data summarization and transfer to a secure storage server occurring daily. All data is stored in logs as per-connection summaries, and analysis is performed at an aggregate level, not individually. Most users receive transient IP addresses from DHCP and/or NAT when connected to the campus network. Identification processes in active or passive measurement are limited to hosts and servers associated with organizations and applications under study, not individual users. Access to log data is restricted to those specifically authorized to conduct networking and security research. Any security-related vulnerabilities detected in the summarized data are reported to the campus IT team for follow-up.

### 4. Measurement Results
This section presents the results from our empirical network traffic study. We start with an overview of the traffic on a year-to-year basis, followed by a focus on specific applications and services, including authentication, learning management systems, and VPN.

#### 4.1 Traffic Overview
Figure 1 provides a high-level overview of our campus network traffic volume, in Terabytes (TB) of data per day for calendar years 2019 and 2020. The horizontal axis shows the time in months, while the vertical axis shows inbound data on the upper part of the plot and outbound data on the lower (negative y-axis) part of the plot. The green lines represent the baseline pre-pandemic year 2019, while the red lines represent the pandemic-affected year 2020.

Several structural patterns are evident in Figure 1:
1. **Higher Network Activity:** There is generally higher network activity during the main semesters (January-April and September-December) than during the Spring/Summer period (May-August).
2. **Weekly Cycles:** Distinctive weekly cycles are present.
3. **Net Consumer of Data:** Our campus is a net consumer of data, with inbound traffic far exceeding outbound traffic.
4. **Holiday Season Decline:** There is a general decline in network traffic in late December when the university is closed for the holiday season, and few people are on campus.

Pandemic-related effects are also evident in Figure 1:
- **Sharp Decline in March 2020:** There is a sharp decline in traffic volumes in mid-March 2020, when classes were canceled, and remote learning began.
- **Fall 2020 Reduction:** Inbound traffic for Fall 2020 (September-December) is about 25% below that observed for Fall 2019. This is the first time in over a decade of monitoring that we have observed a reduction in network traffic volume from one academic year to the next.
- **Winter Semester Growth:** In the Winter semester (January-April), 2020 traffic prior to the lockdown exceeds that of 2019, with about 84% growth in overall traffic.

These dynamics in Fall 2020 reflect the fact that most people were still away from campus, working and learning from home. This observation is further supported by the increases in outbound traffic volume in Fall 2020 (almost 50% increase compared to the prior year). As explained earlier, a connection to the campus VPN generates an incoming connection to the VPN server and outgoing connections to the userâ€™s target hosts on the Internet, resulting in symmetry between outbound and inbound traffic volume due to a VPN connection. Therefore, VPN connections do not affect the overall asymmetry of the campus traffic observed.
