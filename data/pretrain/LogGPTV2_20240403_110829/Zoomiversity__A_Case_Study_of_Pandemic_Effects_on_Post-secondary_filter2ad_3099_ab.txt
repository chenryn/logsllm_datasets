3.3 Active Measurement
Active measurement refers to establishing connections and sending data packets
to identify entities in the network, characterize traﬃc, or measure diﬀerent met-
rics. In this study, we used active measurement techniques judiciously to identify
hosts and servers associated with organizations and autonomous systems under
study, and their traﬃc attributes, such as port numbers. This information is
most often essential in network traﬃc measurement and workload characteriza-
tion studies. For this purpose, we mainly conducted simple experiments using
basic network tools like nslookup and traceroute and used Wireshark to cap-
ture packet-level traﬃc. We then analyzed the captured logs and extracted the
required ﬁelds, such as IP addresses associated with the target organizations and
the port numbers used by applications. This information may also be utilized in
the passive measurement when required.
3.4 Challenges and Limitations
As with any network traﬃc measurement study, there are challenges and limi-
tations that aﬀect the completeness of our data, and hence the interpretation of
results. We discuss these issues here.
First and foremost, it is important to note that our monitoring infrastruc-
ture is set up to observe packet traﬃc that is strictly between the university
and the Internet. Speciﬁcally, the monitor does not see traﬃc that stays com-
pletely within the campus network (e.g., a student in residence connecting to an
internal server), nor traﬃc that is completely external (e.g., a home residential
user directly accessing Netﬂix). The pandemic has thus changed the visibility
into Internet usage by our campus community. Some traﬃc that was not visible
previously (e.g., accessing a university Web server while at work) is now visible
when people work and learn from home. Conversely, some traﬃc that was visible
previously (e.g., YouTube accessed from the campus WiFi network) is no longer
visible when these users directly access the Internet from home. For VPN, how-
ever, remote users actually obtain a campus IP address from the BYOD subnet,
which is then used to connect to the Internet. Therefore, a connection to the
campus VPN contributes to both incoming and outgoing connection counts as
seen by the monitor.
A second challenge, as in any longitudinal traﬃc study, arises from unex-
pected events that disrupt data collection. Several such incidents occurred dur-
ing the 2020 year under study. The most pernicious of these were aggressive
scanning attacks (horizontal and vertical) that exhausted the memory resources
on our monitor, and crashed the system. These outages in data collection are
visible in several of the time-series graphs presented in the paper.
To mitigate the foregoing problem, we disabled the scanning module in Zeek,
and reconﬁgured our monitor to do a software restart every 3 h. While this strat-
egy avoids crashes that lose substantial amounts of data, it does limit visibility
into long-duration connections. We subsequently experimented with shorter (1 h)
and longer (6 h) restart intervals as well, prior to settling on 6-h intervals since

July 2020 (see Appendix for more details). The eﬀects of these conﬁguration
changes are also apparent in several of our traﬃc plots.
Another challenge regarding the videoconferencing applications is that
(unlike the on-site proprietary solutions such as the case for Favale et al. [10]) we
have limited information available about their infrastructure and how the appli-
cations behave. In many cases, we had to reverse engineer their behavior based
on a few documents. Furthermore, their deployments may have been changed
during the pandemic. However, due to the wide adoption and availability of these
applications across the globe, our analysis and results should be generalizable to
other environments with similar contexts.
Despite these issues, we still believe that our empirical dataset oﬀers great
research value. Where appropriate, we exercise caution in our interpretations of
results, and contextualize them accordingly.
3.5 Ethical Considerations
Permission to capture network traﬃc data was authorized via the ethics review
process at UCalgary and was carried out with the cooperation of the IT center.
Our network monitor is mounted in a secure data center with restricted physical
access. A limited amount of traﬃc data is stored on the monitor at a time, with
data summarization and transfer to a secure storage server happening on a daily
basis. All data is stored in logs as per-connection summaries. Data analysis is
done at an aggregate level, and not individually. Furthermore, most users get
transient IP addresses from DHCP and/or NAT when connected to the cam-
pus network. Any identiﬁcation process in the active or passive measurement
is limited to the hosts and servers associated with organizations and applica-
tions under study, not individual users. Access to the log data is restricted
to those speciﬁcally authorized to conduct networking and security research.
Any security-related vulnerabilities (e.g., compromised machines, ampliﬁcation
attacks) detected in these summarized data are reported to the campus IT team
for subsequent follow-up.
4 Measurement Results
This section presents the results from our empirical network traﬃc study. We
start with an overview of the traﬃc on a year-to-year basis, and then focus
on speciﬁc applications and services, including authentication, learning manage-
ment system, and VPN.
4.1 Traﬃc Overview
Figure 11 provides a high-level overview of our campus network traﬃc volume, in
Terabytes (TB) of data per day for calendar years 2019 and 2020. The horizontal
1 This ﬁgure uses the direct information from DAGstats and not the logs captured by
Zeek. Therefore, it is not aﬀected by the monitor restarts and the reconﬁguration in
mid-July. However, it is aﬀected by the monitor crash in late March.

axis is inbound traﬃc; lower axis is outbound traﬃc. (Color ﬁgure online)
axis shows the time in months, while the vertical axis shows inbound data on
the upper part of the plot, and outbound data on the lower (negative y axis)
part of the plot. The green lines are for the baseline pre-pandemic year 2019,
while the red lines are for the pandemic-aﬀected year 2020.
There are several structural patterns evident in Fig. 1. First, there is gener-
ally higher network activity during the main semesters (Jan-Apr and Sept-Dec)
than during the Spring/Summer period (May-Aug). Second, there are distinctive
weekly cycles. Third, our campus is a net consumer of data, with inbound traf-
ﬁc far exceeding outbound traﬃc. Fourth, there is a general decline in network
traﬃc in late December when the university is closed for the holiday season, and
few people are on campus.
There are also several pandemic-related eﬀects evident in Fig. 1. The most
prominent of these is the sharp decline in traﬃc volumes in mid-March 2020,
when classes were cancelled, people were asked to stay home, and remote learning
began. Also notable is how the inbound traﬃc for Fall 2020 (Sept-Dec) is about
25% below that observed for Fall 2019. In over a decade of monitoring our campus
network, this is the ﬁrst time that we have observed a reduction in network traﬃc
volume from one academic year to the next. Furthermore, this decline diﬀers
starkly from the Winter semester (Jan-Apr), in which the 2020 traﬃc prior to
the lockdown exceeds that of 2019, for both inbound and outbound (with about
84% growth in overall traﬃc).
These dynamics in Fall 2020 reﬂect the fact that most people were still away
from campus, working and learning from home. This observation is further sup-
ported by the increases in outbound traﬃc volume in Fall 2020 (almost 50%
increase with respect to the prior year). As explained earlier, a connection to
the campus VPN generates an incoming connection to the VPN server, as well as
outgoing connections to the user’s target hosts on the Internet. It results in the
symmetry between outbound and inbound traﬃc volume due to a VPN connec-
tion. Therefore, VPN connections have no net eﬀect on the overall asymmetry
of the campus traﬃc observed.
