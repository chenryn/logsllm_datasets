Question: In a system where confidentiality is as crucial as integrity and authenticity, which MAC function design would be most appropriate?
"A": "A MAC function that includes a part of the plaintext within the MAC to increase complexity.",
"B": "A MAC function that uses a deterministic algorithm based on a secret key without including the plaintext.",
"C": "A MAC function that tags each message with a random number before applying the MAC algorithm.",
"D": "A MAC function that applies multiple rounds of hashing to the message before generating the MAC."
Answer: B
