## Expected Behavior
I am trying to override the Grid item style, specifically the padding, using
the classes prop.
## Current Behavior
They way the object key is generated for the grid item padding it makes it
very difficult to override it.
## Context
I want to use the grid system to generate 2 rows AppBar. The padding of the
Grid item makes the AppBar not resize in height as the standard AppBar would
do when the width changes.
