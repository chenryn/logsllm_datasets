Abstract—State estimation plays a critically important role in
ensuring the secure and reliable operation of the power grid.
However, recent works have shown that the widely used weighted
least squares (WLS) estimator, which uses several system wide
measurements, is vulnerable to cyber attacks wherein an adver-
sary can alter certain measurements to corrupt the estimator’s
solution, but evade the estimator’s existing bad data detection
algorithms and thus remain invisible to the system operator.
Realistically, such a stealthy attack in its most general form
has several constraints, particularly in terms of an adversary’s
knowledge and resources for achieving a desired attack outcome.
In this light, we present a formal framework to systematically
investigate the feasibility of stealthy attacks considering con-
straints of the adversary. In addition, unlike prior works, our
approach allows the modeling of attacks on topology mappings,
where an adversary can drastically strengthen stealthy attacks by
intentionally introducing topology errors. Moreover, we show that
this framework allows an operator to synthesize cost-effective
countermeasures based on given resource constraints and security
requirements in order to resist stealthy attacks. The proposed
approach is illustrated on standard IEEE test cases.

I. INTRODUCTION
In the power grid, state estimation (SE) is the process of
ﬁnding the best estimate for the system state in a weighted
least square sense, given a measurement model and a set of
measurements acquired through a Supervisory Control and
Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. The state corresponds
to the vector of bus (or node) voltages, from which line
(or branch) currents and power ﬂows can be computed. The
results from state estimation aid system operators in assessing
security, initiating corrective control measures, and enabling
pricing calculations for real-time electricity markets. Hence,
state estimation is a critical and inherent part of energy
management system (EMS) applications for the power grid.
However, critical
infrastructures relying on SCADA based
measurements are vulnerable to cyber-attacks [1]. It is im-
portant to note that while Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs)
are gradually being deployed, still the current grid largely
relies on extensive SCADA measurements for several EMS
applications, including state estimation.
Recent work, particularly by [2], has revealed that state
estimation is vulnerable to a special type of cyber-attacks,
where an adversary can alter certain measurements by in-
jecting false data to corrupt
the estimator’s result, while
remain invisible to the system operator by evading the existing
bad data detection algorithms. These attacks are known as
Undetected False Data Injection (UFDI) attacks. The idea
behind these attacks is interesting. The state estimation process
widely uses weighted least squares (WLS) to estimate states.
The process uses high measurement redundancy to detect and
ﬁlter bad data (i.e., noisy meter measurements) by checking
whether the measurement residual, which is the l2-norm of the
difference between observed and estimated measurements, is
below a certain threshold [3], [4]. An adversary who knows
the complete measurement model can then inject or manipulate
meter measurements consistent with the measurement model
to bypass the bad data detection (BDD) process [2], [5]. It is
shown in [6], [7] that such UFDI attacks can be defended if
a strategically chosen set of measurements are secured. The
algorithms to identify such a measurement set was also shown
to be equivalent to the NP-complete hitting set problem.
In contrast, we propose a security threat analytical frame-
work, which considers a UFDI attack against state estimation
in its most generic and broadest form by casting the entire
problem into a formal veriﬁcation, particularly a constraint
satisfaction model. The framework is built using SMT (Satisﬁ-
ability Modulo Theories), which is a powerful tool for solving
constraint satisfaction problems with thousands of variables
and millions of clauses [8].
Contributions: In this work, we deﬁne the UFDI attack model
comprehensively in terms of different attack attributes, which
model an adversary’s knowledge, resources, and attack goals.
Moreover, our approach allows one to model attacks on the
topology processor, which is responsible to map the grid
topology based on statuses of switches and circuit breakers
across the system. This topology is used in state estimation.
An attack on this unit introduces topology errors by excluding
lines actually in service and including lines not in service. An
attack on the topology is often known as topology poisoning.
Since there are topology error detection algorithms [4], it
is important to examine if an adversary can strengthen the
potency of UFDI attacks by introducing topology errors. Our
framework captures all possible interrelations between attack
variables, along with topology poisoning, to determine the

feasibility and outcomes of an attack, i.e., the states under
attack and the corresponding attack vector. More importantly,
with this framework, we propose a mechanism for automatic
synthesis of a security architecture (i.e., the set of measure-
ments or buses) that need to be secured, with respect to a
list of security requirements (i.e., expected attack model) and
the grid operator’s constraints. In summary, our contribution
is twofold: (i) developing a formal framework for verifying
potential UFDI attack threats, which includes the modeling of
a comprehensive set of attack attributes as well as the modeling
of topology poisoning attacks; and (ii) developing a mech-
anism for automatic synthesis of countermeasures to resist
UFDI attacks under speciﬁed requirements and constraints.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section II,
we provide the necessary background and our motivation.
We present our formal model in Section III. The security
architecture synthesis mechanism is described in Section IV
followed by evaluations on test cases. We brieﬂy discuss the
related work in Section VI and conclude in Section VII.
II. BACKGROUND
The stealthy attacks on state estimation (e.g.,
[2], [5])
are based on the DC power ﬂow model. This DC model is
simplistic, but popular and useful for preliminary analytical
power systems studies.
A. DC Power Flow Model
In the DC power ﬂow model, the power balance equations
in a power system are expressed by assuming the impedance
of a transmission line purely in terms of its reactance [9]. The
voltage magnitudes at all buses are taken ﬁxed at 1 per unit
and only the phase angles are treated as the variables. Thus,
the voltage phasor at bus i is expressed by 1∠θi. Denoting
the admittance of the line between buses i and j by Yij, the
real power-ﬂow (Pij) across a transmission line is given by:
Pij = Yij(θi − θj). Yij is the reciprocal of the reactance.
The power-balance constraint that equates the algebraic sum
of powers incident at every bus to zero creates a linear system
of equations of the form: [B][θ] = [P].
B. State Estimation and UFDI Attack
The state estimation problem is to estimate n number of
power system state variables x = (x1, x2,··· , xn)T based
on m (m > n) number of meter measurements z =
(z1, z2,··· , zm)T , according to the relationship: z = h(x)+e,
where h(x) = (h1(x1,··· , xn),··· , hm(x1,··· , xn))T and
e is the vector of measurement errors [3], [4]. In the case
of the linearized estimation model, i.e., according to the DC
power ﬂow model, we have:
z = Hx + e, where H = (hi,j)m×n
H is known as the Jacobian matrix. When the measurement
errors are normally distributed with zero mean,
the state
estimate ˆx is calculated as:
ˆx = (HT WH)−1HT Wz
(1)
157157157
Here, W is a diagonal matrix whose elements are reciprocals
of variances of the meter errors. Thus, estimated measurements
are calculated as Hˆx and the residual ||z − Hˆx|| is used to
identify bad data. Under these assumptions, it can be shown
that the residual follows a χ2 distribution with m− n degrees
of freedom. A threshold τ is set using a hypothesis test at
a signiﬁcance level such that the condition ||z − Hˆx|| > τ
implies the presence of bad data [4]. UFDI attacks [2] are
based on the idea that if the attack vector a follows from
H, such that a = Hc, where c is the vector of changes in
states due to a, then the residual remains unchanged. Since
z + a = H(ˆx + c), the residual ||(z + a) − H(ˆx + c)|| is
still ||z − Hˆx||. Thus, the implicit assumption here is that the
adversary has full knowledge of the measurement model H.
Topology Processor: Instead of using a ﬁxed a priori model of
the system to generate H, the EMS uses a topology processor
to map the grid topology [3]. This processor analyzes the
statuses of various switches and circuit-breakers in the system
and determines the connectivity among different electrical
nodes (i.e., buses). These topology statuses from the switches
and circuit-breakers are periodically telemetered to the control
center. Once the grid connectivity matrix A and the branch
admittance matrix D are known, the measurement matrix H
is computed as follows [10]:
⎡
⎣ DA−DA
(2)
Matrices DA (i.e., multiplication of D and A) and −DA
represent
the line power ﬂows in forward and backward
directions, respectively. Matrix AT DA (i.e., multiplication of
AT and DA) represents power consumption at the buses.
⎤
⎦
H =
AT DA
The state estimated solution (from Equation (1)) provides
the estimate of bus voltages from which the system power-
ﬂows can be computed. Summing up the net power ﬂows
incident on a bus then yields the estimated power (or load)
at that bus.
C. Attack Model
Our approach is to model a UFDI attack in its most generic
form to allow the evaluation of the feasibility of an attack
under various scenarios. The attack attributes that represent
the attack model are discussed in the following:
Accessibility: An attacker may not have access to all of the
measurements, when physical or remote access to substations
is restricted or when certain measurements are already secured.
For example, in order to inject false data to the measurements
taken at a substation (i.e., bus), an attacker needs to have
the access to that substation (or to the corresponding Remote
Terminal Unit) [10].
Resource Constraint: An adversary may be constrained in
cost or effort to mount attacks on vastly distributed mea-
surements. In such cases, an adversary is constrained to
compromising or altering a limited subset of measurements
at a time. It is useful to represent this resource limitation with
respect to buses. Because, if the measurements required for

the false data injection in an attack are distributed in many
substations, i.e., buses, then it would be harder for an attacker
to inject false data to those measurements compared to the set
of measurements distributed in a small number of substations.
Grid Topology and Knowledge: State estimation of a power
system is done based on the given topology (i.e., connectivity
among the buses) of the grid. This topology is mapped by the
topology processor. For a successful UFDI attack, an attacker
needs to know the grid topology and the electrical parameters
of the transmission lines, which is not
trivial [2]. In the
case of partial knowledge, the attacker’s capability becomes
restricted. On the other hand, an attacker can inﬂict novel
UFDI attacks against SE by conveying false status information
at the transmitting devices or media, such that the topology
generated by the processor includes one or more open lines
(i.e., non-existing in the true topology), or excludes one or
more closed lines (i.e., existing in the true topology).
Attack Goal: An attacker may choose to inject false data on
certain chosen measurements with a speciﬁc aim of corrupting
a certain set of state estimated solutions, or target a speciﬁc
portion of the system.
As the prior works (e.g., [2], [5], [11]) address UFDI attacks
considering these attack attributes in isolation, we take the
challenge to assess the attack feasibility when these attributes,
particularly topology poisoning attacks, are all considered
simultaneously, in which case the interrelation between these
attack variables has an integral impact. We model the UFDI
attack on state estimation as a constraint satisfaction problem,
the solution to which answers whether a UFDI attack can be
launched in a particular attack scenario with respect to a given
set of attack constraints. Our formal model framework allows
a grid operator to analyze and explore potential threats under
different attack scenarios and initiate appropriate security mea-
sures. The proposed framework is described in the following
section. In addition, we also propose an automated mechanism
to synthesize a security architecture (i.e., measurements that
need to be secured) satisfying given security requirements,
which actually specify the protection of state estimation from
UFDI attacks with respect to a given attack model.
III. FORMAL MODEL OF UNDETECTED FALSE DATA
INJECTION ATTACK
In this section, we present our modeling of verifying poten-
tial undetected false data injection attacks. In order to model
UFDI attack, we need a number of parameters to denote differ-
ent system properties and attack attributes. These parameters
are shown in Table I. In this paper, we use two-letter notations
to denote many parameters. We expect that these two-letter
notations will help the readers to recall them. Also note that, in
this paper, no multiplication of two parameters is represented
without the multiplication sign.
A. Preliminaries
According to the DC power ﬂow model, the admittance of a
line or branch is computed from its reactance. The direction of
the line is taken based on the current ﬂow direction, i.e., from
a end-bus to another end-bus. The two end-buses of line i are
denoted using lf i (from-bus) and lt i (to-bus), where 1 ≤ i ≤ l,
1 ≤ lf i, lt i ≤ b, and b is the number of buses. The admittance
of the line is denoted by ld i.
Each row of H corresponds to a power equation. The ﬁrst l
rows correspond to the forward line power ﬂow measurements.
The second l rows are the backward line power ﬂow measure-
ments, which are the same as the ﬁrst l except the direction of
the power ﬂows are opposite. We use P L
to denote the power
i
ﬂow through line i, while P B
j denote the power consumption
at bus j, and θj to denote the state value (i.e., the voltage
phase angle at bus j). Then, we have the following relation
between the line power ﬂow of line i (P L
i ) and the states at
the connected buses (lf i and lt i):
(3)
i = ld i(θlf i
∀1≤i≤l P L
− θlt i)
Equation (3) speciﬁes that power ﬂow P L
i depends on the
difference of the connected buses’ phase angles and the line
admittance. The last b rows of H correspond to the bus power
consumptions. The power consumption of a bus j is simply
the summation of the power ﬂows of the lines connected to
this bus. Let Lj,in and Lj,out be the sets of incoming lines
and outgoing lines of bus j, respectively. Then, the following
equation represents the power consumption at bus j:
(cid:6)
i∈Lj,in
(cid:6)
i∈Lj,out
∀1≤j≤b P B
j =
i −
P L
P L
i
(4)
Basically, state estimation with the DC ﬂow model reduces
to ﬁnding the voltage phase angle (θ) at each bus by solving
an overdetermined linear system of equations given the mea-
surement conﬁguration and line parameters in a weighted least
square sense as stated in Section II.
B. Parameters for Modeling UFDI Attack
We use cx j to denote whether state xj (1 ≤ j ≤ n) is
affected (i.e., changed to an incorrect value) due to false data
injection. Note that, in the DC model, each state corresponds
to a bus. Thus, n is equal to b. Parameter cz i denotes whether
measurement zi (1 ≤ i ≤ m) is required to be altered (by
injecting false data) for the attack. If any measurement at bus j
is required to be changed, cbj becomes true.
Here, we model incomplete information with respect to line
admittance only and use the variable bd i to denote whether
the attacker knows the admittance of line i. Note that if the
end-buses of a line are unknown, the corresponding row in A
is fully unknown to the attacker. In this case, there is no way
for an adversary to launch UFDI attacks on the system. In the
DC model, two measurements can be taken (i.e., recorded and
reported by meters) for each line: the forward and backward
current ﬂows. For each bus, a measurement can be taken for
the power consumption at the bus. Therefore, for a power
system with l number of lines and b number of buses, there
are 2l + b number of potential measurements (zis). Though
a signiﬁcantly smaller number of measurements are sufﬁcient
for state estimation, redundancy is provided to identify and
ﬁlter bad data. We use mz i
to denote whether potential
