encapsulating the notion of malicious interference as an ad-
ditional vector of noise that maps to each stage of a sensor’s
signal conditioning chain and related support circuitry. Our
systematization of knowledge addresses the challenge of how
to capture security characteristics in the existing representation
of transfer functions by modeling transduction attacks as a
vector of malicious noise.
Our simple sensor security model for transduction attacks
consists of a series of cascading transfer functions followed
by a formulaic set of basic steps that are sufﬁcient to describe
the predictive space of imaginable future transduction attacks
against sensor security.
Speciﬁcally, two categories of basic steps comprise the main
ingredients of present and future transduction attacks:
(i) Signal injection steps describe key methods to inject ma-
licious analog signals into sensors by emitting malicious
physical signals and are vital to all transduction attacks.
(ii) Measurement shaping steps describe key methods to shape
injected analog signals to beneﬁt the adversary and may be
optional depending on the target sensor and attacker goal.
B. Simple Sensor Security Model
In this section, we introduce the traditional sensor model
and base the formalization of transduction attacks on the tradi-
tional model (Fig. 2). Table I summarizes established notation
and our minimal additions to capture security properties.
Fig. 2: A generalized sensor schematic (top), the traditional and established
way of modeling a sensor (middle), and our adaptation to model a transduction
attack (bottom). The signal processing community models a sensor as cascad-
ing transfer functions. Each transfer function (e.g., fi) has two inputs—the
legitimate signal xi and the noise signal ni. The output signal xi+1 becomes
the input to the next transfer function fi+1. x1 is the stimulus to the transducer
(f1), and it is either pre-existing or transformed from a probing signal x0
generated by the sensor if it is an active one. The noise ni may come from the
electrical circuit or the external environment. The transduction attack model
consists of a simple adaptation of established practices by representing analog
security exploits as a vector of intentional noise [a1, a2, . . . , am] that leads
the output y to an attacker-desired value of ˆy.
1) Sensor Model: Our approach models each sensor com-
ponent as a transfer function, which characterizes its input-
output relationship. Transfer functions are normally expressed
in the Laplace domain for analysis of
the dynamic re-
sponse [60], [64] and in the time domain for analysis of the
static response [61], [65], [66]. Here, we use the time-domain
representation of transfer functions, because transduction at-
tacks usually damage or exploit the static characteristics of
sensors, e.g., accuracy and nonlinearity.
As shown in the middle of Fig. 2, traditional approaches
characterize the ith sensor component as a mathematical
transfer function fi:
xi+1 = fi(xi, ni)
(1)
where the inputs consist of a legitimate signal xi and a noise
signal ni, and the output signal is xi+1. Note that xi+1 is
also the input to the (i + 1)th component. All signals are
time-varying, and here we omit the time variable t in xi(t)
for simplicity. The noise ni is an unwanted disturbance to
xi and may come from the electrical circuit itself (electronic
noise) or the external environment (coupled noise). In practice,
the noise signal ni and legitimate signal xi are mixed and
cannot be separated easily [67]. Our conceptual model serves
to emphasize that noise inputs can affect the outputs of the
components and introduce errors to the measurement.
Examples. We ﬁrst review a few examples of established
transfer functions when the noise is additive, which is the most
widely used noise model.

(i) A linear transfer function is deﬁned as xi+1 = c0 +c1(xi +
ni), where c0 is the intercept and c1 is the slope. The linear
relationship is expected for many components in their ideal
states, such as position transducers and ampliﬁers [61].
(ii) Nonlinear relationships apply to most components in prac-
tice. Common transfer functions include [61]: logarithmic
function xi+1 = c0 +c1 ln(xi +ni) (e.g., photodiodes), ex-
ponential function xi+1 = c1ek(xi+ni) (e.g., thermistors),
and power function xi+1 = c0 + c1(xi + ni) + c2(xi + ni)2
(e.g., silicon resistive sensors). Higher-order polynomial
functions may be employed for other cases.
As shown in the middle of Fig. 2, traditional signal pro-
cessing formalizes the transfer function of a sensor as the
cascading components’ functions:
y = fm(··· f2(f1(x1, n1), n2)··· , nm)
(2)
where the output y is the sensor measurement and m is the
number of components. The inputs to a sensor include the
physical stimulus x1 at the transducer and the noise signals
at each component. Let a vector of the noise signals be n =
[n1, n2, . . . , nm] and the overall transfer function of the sensor
be f, Eq. (2) simpliﬁes to:
y = f (x1, n)
(3)
2) Transduction Attack Formalization: Although noise re-
duction with signal processing circuits is a common practice,
sensor designers typically do not expect the intentional noise
injected by transduction attacks. The goal of a transduction
attack is to modify a sensor’s measurement y by injecting
intentional noise to the legitimate physical or analog input xi.
Formally, we deﬁne transduction attacks as follows:
Deﬁnition 1. A transduction attack alters the measurement
of a sensor to approach an attacker-desired value ˆy by injecting
intentional interference to the sensor. The measurement under
a transduction attack can be represented as
y = f (x1, n + a(cid:48))
(4)
where a(cid:48) = [a(cid:48)
m] = [h1(a1), h2(a2), . . . , hm(am)]

2, . . . , nm + a(cid:48)
m]. hi is the unintended transfer function of
noise that is hidden before the ith component and models the
propagation and coupling of external noise. We omit them
from the traditional sensor model for simplicity.
We demonstrate the attack at
the injected signal a(cid:48)
the bottom of Fig. 2. In
our model,
is of the same type as
the original noise ni. The combination of the injected signal
a(cid:48)
i and noise ni may affect the output of components and
the sensor measurement eventually, because subsequent signal
conditioning components blindly trust inputs. A vector of the
malicious physical signals emitted by the attacker can be
formalized by an adversary transfer function g:
a = [a1, a2, . . . , am] = g(ˆy, k,(cid:102)x1,(cid:102)x0)
(5)
where ˆy is the desired sensor measurement, k is the knowledge
of the sensor model, (cid:102)x1 is the measured stimulus from the
measurand, and (cid:102)x0 is the measured stimulus from the victim
sensor if it is active. Independently, attackers may measure
both x1 and x0. Knowledge of the existing stimulus x1
is necessary to achieve accurate control over the sensor’s
measurement, and measuring the stimulus x0 emitted by active
sensors is optional, e.g., in spooﬁng sensors such as lidars [45]
and ultrasonic sensors [68].
3) Case Study—Microphone Audio Spooﬁng: We demon-
strate how to model transduction attacks with transfer func-
tions using a high-level example from previous work [47].
In this simpliﬁed example, an adversary’s goal is to cause a
spoofed sound measurement ˆy in the audible frequency range
(20 Hz to 20 kHz) at a microphone’s output in a quiet envi-
ronment (x1 ≈ 0, n ≈ 0). To achieve this goal, the adversary
exploits the conducting wire at the input of an ampliﬁer (f2) as
an unintended transducer (h2), which can unintentionally con-
vert the adversary’s electromagnetic signal a2 to an electrical
noise a(cid:48)
2 via electromagnetic coupling modeled by h2 (acting
as an antenna). h2 determines the optimal frequency (fa2) of
the electromagnetic signal a2. Given the nonlinear property
of an ampliﬁer’s transfer function, the adversary modulates
the desired output ˆy on a carrier of fa2 and recovers ˆy at
the ampliﬁer’s output through intermodulation distortion [69].
The demodulated signal may survive in the signal conditioning
chain and spoof the microphone’s output as desired.
4) Discussion: Without transfer functions, designing a vi-
able physical signal for transduction attacks is empirical
and requires trial and error. With the transfer functions, we
envision that the simple sensor security model facilitates the
design of malicious physical signals a that can modify the
sensor measurements to a given value and quantifying the
effectiveness. In particular, given the desired sensor measure-
ment ˆy, an attacker can derive a by mathematically solving
an optimization problem1. We can quantify the effectiveness
1An attacker may acquire the transfer functions from public datasheets or
by conducting sensor assessment. If accurate modeling of a transfer function
is challenging, e.g., the unintended EM coupling effect, approximate solutions
are applicable. Though inaccurate transfer functions may degrade our model,
they seldom impair the effectiveness of attacks, especially when an attacker
does not demand a highly accurate control over the sensor output.
of an attack by the expected error, i.e., e = |(cid:101)y− ˆy|, where(cid:101)y is
the real sensor measurement. An attacker’s goal is to minimize
the expected error e by optimizing the emitted physical signals
a. Conversely, sensor designers tasked with threat mitigation
may consider methods to attenuate undesirable signals injected
through each transducer, including unintended transducers. In
addition, designers should validate that real components match
their theoretical behavior, even for abnormal input.
To construct a transduction attack, the simple sensor security
model indicates two categories of basic steps.
(i) The signal injection steps involve determining the neces-
sary characteristics of the malicious physical signals that
can inject noise to the signal conditioning path efﬁciently,
including the injection point and signal parameters.
(ii) In the measurement shaping steps, we consider how an at-
tacker can construct physical signals such that the injected
analog signals (“injected signals” hereafter) can shape the
sensor measurement to desired values.
In the following, we elaborate on the two categories of steps.
C. Signal Injection Steps
To successfully and efﬁciently inject malicious analog sig-
nals into a sensor, an attacker must consider (1) the injection
point, i.e., before or after the intended transducer, and (2)
which signal types, amplitudes, and frequencies of the emitted
physical signals are most efﬁcient.
1) Injection Point and Signal Type: Since transducers are
by design the only component that intends to accept exter-
nal physical inputs, we divide the injection point into pre-
transducer (at or before the intended transducer) and post-
transducer (after the intended transducer). The injection point
determines the required signal type.
Pre-Transducer. Attackers may exploit how transducers
are designed to be sensitive to at least one type of physi-
cal signal (Section II-B). Most existing transduction attacks
exploit injection points at or before the intended transducers.
Intuitively, the malicious physical signal a1 can be the same
type of signal as the legitimate stimulus x1 so that they are
inherently noise inputs without conversion. For example, Petit
et al. [46] and Shin et al. [45] succeeded in attacking lidars
with light. Yan et al. [70] managed to jam and spoof ultrasonic
sensors with ultrasound. Attackers can also use acoustic waves
to attack sensors that measure movement vibrations, e.g.,
MEMS gyroscopes [42]–[44] and accelerometers [43], [59].
Post-Transducer. Components after the intended transducer
may act as unintended transducers, converting noise or an
attacker’s physical signal ai into an electrical signal inside
the sensor despite not being designed to do so. For example,
wires in a circuit may act as unintended antennas by converting
electromagnetic waves into analog electrical signals in the
sensor via inductive or capacitive coupling [71]. Since the
injected signal a(cid:48)
i is usually weak after conversion, injection
points before the pre-ampliﬁer are typically preferred so that
the injected signal may have a more dominant effect on the
output than the legitimate input xi.
Rasmussen et al. [72] ﬁrst suggested adversarial usage of
wires being unintended antennas, but as a possible path-
way for wormhole attack [73] rather than in the context of
transduction attacks. Foo Kune et al. [47] ﬁrst exploited this
effect for a transduction attack by injecting a voice signal
into a Bluetooth headset. This attack employed intentional
electromagnetic interference (EMI) on the conducting wire
between the microphone and ampliﬁer. Later work employed
electromagnetic coupling from outside [48] and inside [74] a
smartphone to inject malicious signals to its microphone, and
compromised actuator control signals [75]–[77].
Attackers must consider how injection using a wave or ﬁeld
may affect several sensor components simultaneously, as it
may complicate the attack in terms of the needed measurement
shaping steps. For example, sound can vibrate all sensor com-
ponents besides the transducer, and electromagnetic injection
may induce currents at many parts of a circuit. However, as
we will discuss later, an attacker with knowledge of the sensor
may choose the malicious physical signal’s frequency to affect
targeted components more than others.
2) Efﬁcient Injection and Signal Frequency: The effective-
ness and efﬁciency of signal injection depend on the physical
signal’s form, especially the amplitude and frequency.
Amplitude. An injection is likely to be more effective
with physical signals of higher amplitudes. Shorter attack
distances or increased transmission power may result in higher
physical signal amplitudes at the target sensor due to the
power-attenuation law for physical signals, e.g., sound and
electromagnetic waves [78]. However, in practice, one cannot
easily increase the power indeﬁnitely. For example, a high-
power radio frequency signal, laser, or sound may cause dam-
age to human bodies [79]. Inaudible ultrasound at high power
may create audible byproducts [80], [81] due to nonlinear
acoustics [82], [83], which makes inaudible attacks audible.
Frequency. Resonant frequencies widely exist for many
mechanical and electrical components, e.g., MEMS transduc-
ers [84] and wires (antennas) [85]. At these frequencies, the
injected signal can reach relative maximum intensities. An
attacker may increase the efﬁciency of injection at the resonant
frequencies of the target injection point. A standard method to
ﬁnd the resonant frequency is to conduct a frequency sweep
and search for the highest amplitude response [42], [43],
[47], [59], [86]. In addition to using a resonant frequency,
an attacker may choose speciﬁc frequencies to satisfy the
special requirement of attacks, e.g., to be hidden. For example,
attacks that employ ultrasound (> 20 kHz) are inaudible to
humans. Similarly, injecting infrared to cameras makes the
attack invisible. Depending on the frequency, signals can be
divided into two categories: in-band and out-of-band.
3) In-Band and Out-of-Band Signals: Signals with frequen-
cies within the intended frequency band are in-band signals,
and otherwise are out-of-band signals. For example, ultrasound
is out-of-band for microphones that are expected to record
audible sounds between 20 Hz and 20 kHz. Most MEMS
accelerometers are expected to capture movement (mechanical
vibration) under 750 Hz [59]; therefore, frequencies in the
kHz range may be out-of-band. Typically, injecting an out-of-
band signal can have two problems. (1) Out-of-band signals
do not directly interfere with ordinary inputs because they
are at different frequencies. For example, one cannot discern
ultrasonic noises in audible sounds. (2) Out-of-band signals
are often attenuated by ﬁlters designed to remove signals
outside the expected frequency band. For an injected out-of-
band signal to affect measurement, an attacker will require
measurement shaping steps to convert the injected signals to
the expected frequency range, i.e., in-band.
D. Measurement Shaping Steps
Signal injection alone may be insufﬁcient to meet all at-
tacker goals; thus, an attacker may have to take additional steps
to shape the injected analog signals to DoS or spoof the sensor.
A common example being how an attacker may use step(s)
to shape out-of-band signals to in-band for sensor spooﬁng.
To shape the signal between transduction and digitization, an
attacker may exploit speciﬁc properties of sensor components
by properly designing the malicious physical signals. We
deﬁne measurement shaping steps as these exploits of sensor
component properties that shape the injected signals. In the
following, we elaborate on how one can group several common
measurement shaping steps across a wide variety of sensor
types and existing studies, and show how these may be
mathematically abstracted to ﬁt into our model.
