User: I want to schedule a task for 9:00 AM in every country. (basically 9:00 AM in every time zone). How can I schedule that in google appengine? 
Will it take multiple timezones for time zone parameter?
Thanks in advance
Assistant: You can schedule a cron job to run every hour, because every hour there is 9 am somewhere.
