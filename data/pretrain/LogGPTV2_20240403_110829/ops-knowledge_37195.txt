User: I have Eclipse setup with PyDev and love being able to debug my scripts/apps.  I've just started playing around with Pylons and was wondering if there is a way to start up the paster server through Eclipse so I can debug my webapp?
Assistant: Create a new launch configuration (Python Run)
Main tab
Use paster-script.py as main module (you can find it in the Scripts sub-directory in your python installation directory)
Don't forget to add the root folder of your application in the PYTHONPATH zone
Arguments
Set the base directory to the root folder also.
As Program Arguments use "serve development.ini" (or whatever you use to debug your app")
Common Tab
Check allocate console and launch in background
