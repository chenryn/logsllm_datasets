Subject: Tooltip Visibility Issue within Modal

Hello,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention an issue with the tooltip display when it is contained within a modal. Specifically, the tooltip gets cut off and does not fully appear as expected.

To better illustrate the problem, please refer to the following JSFiddle link, which demonstrates the current behavior:
- [JSFiddle Example](http://jsfiddle.net/zk7dF/38/)

In the example, you will notice that the tooltip is being clipped by the modal's boundaries. Ideally, the tooltip should be visible in its entirety, even if it extends beyond the modalâ€™s shadow or overlay.

Could you please take a look into this and let me know if there are any adjustments or solutions we can implement to ensure the tooltip displays correctly?

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,  
Andrew
