### Table X: The List of Unique Downloaded Binaries Collected After Filling Out Surveys in Survey Publishers

| Binary | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Somoto | 350   | 13.4%      |
| Sport Score | 94  | 3.6%       |
| Search by Zooms | 255 | 9.8%     |
| Zeus   | 325   | 12.4%      |
| Total  | 69    | 2.7%       |
| PUP    | 23    | 1%         |
| Banking Trojan | 59  | 2.3%      |
| Extension | 161  | 6.2%      |
| PUP    | 875   | 33.7%      |
| Ransomware | 98  | 3.8%       |
| Extension | 162  | 6.2%      |
| Malware | 138   | 5.3%       |
| **Total** | **2,612** | **100%**  |

### Types of Binaries Obtained During the Analysis of Detected Survey Scams

- **PUP (Potentially Unwanted Program)**: Somoto, amonetize, opencandy, loadmoney
- **Malware**: Zbot (Zeus Trojan), kovter (ransomware)
- **Extensions**: Various malicious extensions

### Security Threats from Survey Scams

Survey scams expose victims to a wide range of security threats. As shown in Table X, survey scammers tend to distribute malicious binaries, PUPs, and redirect users to other survey pages and adult content to monetize their operations. Additionally, they steal sensitive user information. We collected 2,612 unique binaries (unique MD5s) by visiting 22,057 URLs that delivered a binary, yielding 954 distinct polymorphic files. Of these, 521 samples were not previously submitted to AV scanners in VirusTotal.

### Labeling Schema and Consistency

The labeling schema for these binaries is not always consistent among AV scanners. For example, two scanners may generate different labels for the same instance of a PUP family. To address this, we used majority voting to label each sample. As shown, 75% of all the samples belong to PUPs, such as somoto, amonetize, opencandy, and loadmoney. While we observed other types of binaries, such as malicious extensions and malware like zbot (Zeus Trojan) or kovter (ransomware), the number of these instances was not significant compared to PUPs.

### Discussions and Limitations

In this paper, we completed 131,277 survey scams using different browser settings, performed over 390,000 browser visits, and analyzed more than 1.2 TB of web traffic. Our analysis empirically shows that scammers use online survey scams to distribute malware, PUPs, and other attacks. The distribution of PUPs is more prevalent than other types of malicious programs, which aligns with prior work by Nelms et al. [24].

#### Practical Deployment Scenarios for SURVEYLANCE

SURVEYLANCE can be deployed in multiple scenarios to disrupt the operation of online survey scams:
- **Blacklists and Anti-Malware Mechanisms**: The output list of survey gateways can be used to augment blacklists or anti-malware mechanisms in major browsers.
- **Browser Extension**: The trained model can be incorporated into a browser extension that monitors visited websites and notifies users if a website is detected as a survey scam gateway.

#### Limitations of SURVEYLANCE

1. **Supervised Learning Evasion**: Attackers can change their web design strategies to evade detection features. This is a fundamental limitation of supervised learning techniques, and the detection model needs constant retraining.
2. **Seed Selection**: Our initial seed selection relies on Google Trends, which may not be representative of the entire web. The effectiveness of our approach depends on the quantity and diversity of search items.
3. **Monetary Gain Estimation**: Providing an estimate of scammers' financial gain is out of the scope of this paper. A deeper understanding of how adversaries make revenue is required.
4. **Interaction Between Parties**: SURVEYLANCE cannot provide thorough information on the interaction between survey gateways and survey publishers. Further investigation is needed to understand how collected data is utilized.

### Related Work

Social engineering techniques are commonly used in survey-based attacks. Previous work has focused on technical mechanisms to spread malware. In contrast, our work studies the launch and recruitment phases of online survey scams and provides a detection approach. Our research aligns with recent work on online scams, scareware, PUPs, and the identification of risky websites.

### Conclusion

This paper presents SURVEYLANCE, a novel approach for detecting online survey scam websites. Our large-scale analysis confirms that survey scams are popular among attackers, who aim to steal sensitive information and deliver malware and PUPs. SURVEYLANCE successfully detects a significant number of scam websites, potentially disrupting malicious operations. We hope this approach will be useful for blacklist operators, search engine providers, and endpoint security vendors in protecting users against online survey scams.
