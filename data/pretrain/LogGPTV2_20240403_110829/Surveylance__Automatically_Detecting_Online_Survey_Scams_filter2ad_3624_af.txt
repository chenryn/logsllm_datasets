scams expose victims to a wide range of security threats. As
shown in Table VIII, given the signiﬁcance of the discovered
abuses, it is evident that survey scammers tend to distribute
malicious binaries, PUPs, and redirect users to other survey
pages and adult content to monetize their operations in ad-
dition to stealing a user’s sensitive information. As shown in
Table IX, we collected 2,612 unique binaries (unique MD5s)
by visiting 22,057 URLs that delivered a binary, yielding 954
distinct polymorphic ﬁles. Of the distinct ﬁles, 521 samples
were not previously submitted to AV scanners in VirusTotal.
Table X shows the type of binaries obtained during the analysis
of the detected survey scams. As mentioned earlier in this
section, the labeling schema is not always consistent among
AV scanners. For example, two scanners may generate labels of
PUP.Optional.LoadMoney and PUP.Gen!pac for the
same instance of the loadmoney PUP family. To avoid such
inconsistencies, we used majority voting to label a sample.
As shown, 75% of all the samples belong to PUPs, such
as somoto, amonetize, opencandy, and loadmoney.
While we observed other types of binaries such as malicious
extensions and malware such as zbot (Zeus Trojan) or
kovter (ransomware), the number of these instances was not
signiﬁcant compared to PUPs.
VII. DISCUSSIONS AND LIMITATIONS
In this paper, we completed 131,277 survey scams us-
ing different browser settings, performed more than 390,000
browser visits to these websites, and analyzed more than
1.2 TB of web trafﬁc. Our analysis empirically shows that
scammers, unsurprisingly, use online survey scams to dis-
tribute malware, PUPs, and other attacks. The analysis of the
downloaded binaries shows that the distribution of PUPs is
more popular than other types of malicious programs. This
ﬁnding, in fact, is in agreement with prior work from Nelms
et al. [24] where the authors analyzed a large number of social
engineering attacks in the network trafﬁc of their organiza-
tion. Furthermore, our evaluation in Section V demonstrates
that SURVEYLANCE achieves practical and useful detection
results on a large, real-world dataset. Given the extent of the
observed abuse, we envision multiple deployment scenarios for
SURVEYLANCE which can potentially disrupt the operation of
online survey scams in the wild. For example, SURVEYLANCE
produces as output a list of survey gateways by passively
crawling websites, collecting network traces, and performing
the classiﬁcation. The output can be used to augment blacklists
or anti-malware mechanisms (e.g., Google Safe Browsing)
in major browsers to reduce the exposure of users to these
websites. The trained model can also be incorporated as a
browser extension that monitors the content of the visited
websites, and notiﬁes the user if the website is detected as a
survey scam gateway. For an attentive user, this information is
likely sufﬁcient to help determine whether the website presents
a threat. Such deployment scenarios of SURVEYLANCE would
potentially raise the difﬁculty bar for scammers, and increase
the development costs of such attacks.
it
Although our survey scam detection technique works well
in practice,
is possible that scammers may observe the
advances in defenses, and adapt their attacks accordingly. In
the following, we discuss the limitations of SURVEYLANCE,
and the resulting implications.
First, recall that SURVEYLANCE is a supervised learning
approach where attackers can change their web design strate-
gies to evade the detection features of the detection model.
Unfortunately, this is a limitation of all supervised learning
techniques, including our approach where the detection model
needs to be trained constantly (see Section V-C3). For example,
all the false negative cases we observed in the large-scale
experiment were using images that we had not observed in our
training phase. Hence, adversaries can potentially exploit this
fundamental limitation, and develop websites that signiﬁcantly
differ from the current types of survey gateways which we
used in the training phase. For example, attackers may try
to evade content-based features, the features with the highest
relative contribution, by utilizing less textual content and
more images in creating survey gateway websites. The current
implementation of the system is less likely to detect these
scenarios. In fact, while the nature of online survey scams
is not as diverse as other web-based social engineering attacks
(e.g. phishing websites), adversaries are still able to utilize a
set of tricks to evade some of the speciﬁc features used in the
learning process of SURVEYLANCE. However, we have not
explored how these evasions may impact the practicality of
the attacks, or how the corresponding websites are perceived
by normal users in order to draw a concrete conclusion about
their responses to such cases.
Second, note that our initial seed selection approach to
obtain survey gateways relies on the Google Trends service.
In our analysis, we selected a set of popular terms that real
users usually incorporate in their search queries everyday.
However, our seed selection was done during a limited time
period, and included only a subset of major categories in the
Google Trend service. Therefore, our results are based on a
sampling of web pages from different categories, which is
not necessarily representative of the entire web. In fact, we
tried to explore what we believe are interesting parts of the
web from a scammer’s perspective. However, we cannot prove
that this is a comprehensive sample of everything that a real-
user would encounter on the web. Moreover, in this paper, we
did not explore the possible effects of different sets of initial

seeds on the detection results. At a high level, the effectiveness
of our approach depends on the quantity and diversity of
search items that we used to generate queries. In a real-world
deployment, the seed selection strategy should be improved by
considering a larger and more diverse set of items for which a
user would typically search for. Furthermore, recall that our
approach to collect the labeled dataset of survey gateways
relies on search engine results. However, search engines try
to comply with copyright violation laws, and hence might
not index all potentially interesting candidates. These cases
can occur in scenarios where the survey gateways use well-
known logos or trademarks to convince visitors to participate
in completing a survey. While our approach to collect the
labeled survey gateways may be extended by incorporating
other sources, such as popular social network websites that
have millions of active users, we are not aware of their exact
copyright violation strategy, nor have we investigated enough
other sources to collect a set of survey gateway pages.
Fourth, note that providing an estimate on scammers’
monetary gain is out of the scope of this paper. In this work,
we mainly focused on identifying the entities and operations
in survey scam ecosystem as well as analyzing the malicious
practices used by adversaries to monetize those operations.
However, we do not have enough data to quantify a reliable
estimate of the adversaries’ ﬁnancial gain through survey
scams. Note that this is a multi-variate problem, and a scientiﬁc
approach to estimate the ﬁnancial revenue requires a deeper
understanding on how adversaries make revenue by delivering
PUPs, collecting user information, and delivering malicious
extensions.
Finally, another limitation of our study is that SURVEY-
LANCE cannot provide thorough information on the interaction
between survey gateways and survey publishers. While adver-
saries behind survey scams, similar to other scammers, have
signiﬁcant freedom to use the collected user information, we
cannot provide any accurate insights on how they may utilize
the collected data. In fact, the information about the users can
be collected by survey gateways, survey publishers, and third-
party scripts. We have not investigated enough the interaction
of these parties to make statistically signiﬁcant claims about
particular types of personal information misuse.
VIII. RELATED WORK
Analogous to other scam-based attacks, social engineering
techniques are a popular means to trick and recruit victims
into participating in survey scams. There is a large body of
work studying social engineering and deceptive attacks [1],
[6], [19], [48], [16], [7], [51]. In most of this work, the focus
is on the technical mechanisms used by attackers to spread
malware. In our work, we also observed deceptive techniques
used by attackers to lure victims into downloading malware.
However, in contrast to existing work, we do not solely explore
the infection phase in a malware-related attack. Rather, we
study in depth how online survey scams are launched, what
the attackers aim to achieve, and how victims are tricked and
recruited. An additional important contribution of our work
is the description and implementation of a detection approach
that can identify online survey scam websites.
There is also a signiﬁcant amount of prior work on the
security and privacy of Internet users on the web. Similar to
this existing work, the primary focus of our research is the
analysis of the speciﬁc techniques scammers use in the wild
to attack the security and privacy of Internet users. Therefore,
the goals of our research are in-line with recent work that has
investigated other types of online scams [23], scareware [17],
[15], [53], PUPs [18], [46], [24], and the identiﬁcation of risky
websites [49], [12]. Furthermore, existing research that focuses
on analyzing deceptive techniques in malicious advertisements,
online fraud [21], [11], [38], [4], ad injection [52], [45], [3],
and adversarial actions for monetary gains [43], [25] are also
related to our work. These studies, however, target a different
class of attacks. While parts of our work incorporate some
of the features (e.g. extracting redirection chains) used in the
context of online advertisements and malware detection, we
note that our work differs signiﬁcantly from existing work as
survey scams have not been explored in depth before.
The most relevant work to ours in the literature is presented
by Clark et al. [8], an independent work which provided
the ﬁrst analysis on survey scams by looking into Facebook
spam URLs. The authors identiﬁed 283 survey scam URLs
and manually interacted with those pages. They concluded
that ad networks are active participants in this ecosystem.
Compared to this work, we introduced SURVEYLANCE, an
automated tool that is speciﬁcally designed to detect such
malicious actions. With the use of SURVEYLANCE, we were
able to studying more than 8,600 survey gateways and 318,000
survey publishers, and thereby perform a more comprehensive
analysis on this ecosystem. Furthermore, we provide insights
into several malicious practices that scammers use to monetize
their operations.
IX. CONCLUSION
This paper presented SURVEYLANCE, a novel approach
for detecting online survey scam websites. We implemented
a prototype of SURVEYLANCE and performed a large-scale
analysis of online survey scam websites. Our analysis conﬁrms
the existing anecdotal evidence that online survey scams are
popular among attackers, showing that attackers aim to steal
sensitive information from victims as well as deliver malware
and PUPs. Our results show that SURVEYLANCE is able to
successfully detect a signiﬁcant number of scam websites,
and potentially disrupt
the malicious operations of survey
scammers. We hope that the approach we present in this paper
will be useful for blacklist operators, search engine providers,
and endpoint security vendors in protecting their users against
online survey scams.
