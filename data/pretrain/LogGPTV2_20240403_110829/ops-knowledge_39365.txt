User:  Please explain how container technology like Docker works.
Assistant: Container technology is a virtualization technology that implements the operating environment of applications by isolating them at the operating system level. Docker is an implementation of container technology, and its working principle is as follows: 1. Docker uses virtualization technology to create an isolated container environment on the host operating system, which contains some basic operating system components, libraries, and applications . 2. Docker can package the application and all the components it depends on into a mirror through the mirror management system, and pass this mirror to the Docker client on other machines, so that other clients can run in their local Docker environment run this image on . 3. When running a program in a Docker container, Docker will automatically generate an independent file system according to the configuration information of the container, and run the application in it. This file system contains only the components and files required by the application, and does not contain any redundant algorithms or files. 4. Docker containers are isolated from each other, and each container has its own namespace, process, network, and file system. This high degree of isolation and portability means that Docker can run applications on different operating systems and hardware. In short, Docker technology realizes the operation and management of applications by creating an isolated container environment. This technology can also solve the packaging and delivery problems of applications through the image management system, thus providing a more efficient, portable and easy-to-manage application deployment scenarios.
