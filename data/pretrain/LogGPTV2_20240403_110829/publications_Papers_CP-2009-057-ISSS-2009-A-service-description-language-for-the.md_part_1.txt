Abstract: Services currently govern economies and will unquestionably become even
more significant in the near future. This trend is supported by the launch of a proposal for
a Directive on Services in the Internal Market1 from the European Commission. Informa-
tion and communication technology are presently being explored to provide infrastructures
to support the notion of the Internet of Services which will enable providers to sell and
consumers to purchase services. Such infrastructures will require research and develop-
ment of new theories, concepts, models and technologies. As such, in this paper, we pre-
sent a Universal Service Description Language (USDL), an approach to model service
descriptions to enable the publication, discovery, selection, contracting and monitoring of
service.
1 Introduction
Services currently govern economies and will unquestionably become even more significant in
the near future. Outsourcing is one of the main reasons behind the growing number of service
available since it allows companies to concentrate on their core competencies, reduce costs and
take advantage of highly specialized external expertise. IBM, for example, which is a main
producer of goods, has generated in 1998 more than half its revenues from services [IBM98].
The European directive for services1 promises to increase the trade of services in the future.
In business, a service is the non-material equivalent of a good. It is considered to be an activity
which is intangible by nature which is provided by a service provider to a service consumer to
create a value possibly for both parties. Services normally provide a human value in the form of
work, information, advice, skills and expertise. In traditional economies, services are typically
discovered and invoked manually, but their realization maybe performed by automated or ma-
nual means (or a combination of both). Services can also be defined as a diverse group of eco-
nomic activities not directly associated with the manufacture of goods, mining or agriculture
[OEC00]. Examples of services include hair cutting, house painting or letter typing.
Services can be categorized according to their economic area. For example, engineering servic-
es, healthcare services, telecommunications services, distribution services and retailing services.
We use the term universal services to refer to any type of services independently of their eco-
nomic area. The term Internet of Services (IoS) [ST07] refers to the infrastructure that enables

the provision of universal services to consumers. The IoS describes an infrastructure that uses
the Internet as a medium for offering and selling services. As a result, services become tradable
goods. Service marketplaces, where service consumers and providers are brought together to
trade services and engage in business interactions, are a fundamental building block for the IoS
vision [CVW08].
Services are considerably different from products primarily due to their intangible nature. Most
products can be described physically based on observable properties, such as size, color, and
weight. On the other hand, services lack of concrete characteristics. Thus, services must often
be defined indirectly in terms of the effects they have on consumers. Therefore, the IoS can
only achieve its full potential when services can be described in a suitable form to enable their
publication, discovery, selection, contracting and monitoring. Compared to Web services, the
challenge goes beyond a technical description and adds the requirement to also describe busi-
ness and operational aspects.
The remaining of this paper is structured in four main sections. In Section 2 we describe the
nature of universal services. This study and characterization provide a better understanding on
the challenges that are needed to address in order to model universal services. Section 3
presents the description language devised to represent universal services. In Section 4, we dis-
cuss the approach that was taken to formally model services. Section 5 shows the importance of
establishing a close relationship between service description languages with service level
agreements. Finally, Section 6 presents our conclusions.
2 The Nature of Universal Services
Compared to Web services [Cur01], developing solutions for the IoS is more elaborate since
services are generally intangible, often inseparable, immersive, bipolar, variable, ostensible
with respect to ownership, have long-running interactions and are decoupled.
(1) Intangible. Services are intangible since they do not have a material existence. As a result, it
is difficult to create suitable standards to model them and to define attributes to objectively
measure them. One of the main questions that this paper will answer is: what are the fundamen-
tal aspects and characteristics of universal services?
(2) Inseparable. The execution and consumption of services occurs frequently in parallel. This
implies that a rigorous match between supply and demand must be achieved. This leads to a
challenging question: how can the IoS provide description mechanisms to match between supply
and demand efficiently?
(3) Immersive. Services are often executed in collaboration with consumers. This implies that in
many cases it is difficult to determine the parties responsible for the degree of success or failure
of a service. Therefore, when distributed services are invoked and executed using process mod-
els and involve providers and consumers, how can SLA be specified and monitored?
(4) Bipolar. Services are often executed by a blend of human and technological resources. Solu-
tions to monitor human involvement in servicesâ€™ execution and the complex relationship be-
tween the human and technological dimensions have not been studied in the context of Internet

services. As a result, the following question arises: how to create universal monitoring mechan-
isms that account for the monitoring of technological resources with the individual monitoring
of human resources?
(5) Variable. Products have a high degree of standardization, while services are very often tai-
lor-made. The variations between similar products of different producers are less prominent
than the variations between services. The following question arises, how to describe the high
variability of services?
(6) Ostensible ownership. The ownership between products and services is distinct. Typically,
when a product transaction is completed, the ownership is transferred to the consumer. On the
other hand, it is not possible to own a service. Its possession is termed as an ostensible owner-
ship. The following question arises, how to represent at a given time the ostensible ownership
of a service?
(7) Long-running interaction. Services are often executed by a back-end business process which
involves human interaction over time until the service is completed. For example, a service
contracted to translate a book from German to English may run for several weeks and require a
significant interaction between the translator and the writer. Therefore, services may require
more personal contact between the provider and consumers. How can long-running interactions
involving relationships between people, processes and activities be associated with services?
(8) Decoupled. The lifecycle of any service includes four main phases: discovery, selection,
invocation and execution [CS05]. In order to capture the full potential of services, consumers
must have access to dynamic discovery mechanisms. Once a set of services is discovered, a
selection is made and the selected service is invoked. Finally, the service is executed. These
four phases can be carried out only with human involvement, with a conjunction of humans and
automated devices, or resorting purely on automated machines. How can the phases of the life-
cycle of services be described and represented?
The first step to enable the development of technological infrastructures to support the concept
of the IoS is to study how the most relevant characteristics and particularities of universal ser-
vices can be abstracted and formally modeled. Such an abstraction will enable the formalization
and normalization of the intangible, often inseparable, immersive, bipolar, variable, ostensible
with respect to ownership, long-running interactions and decoupling of universal services.
Therefore, this paper presents a conceptual structure to model universal services. The language
proposed to describe services is called Universal Service Description Language (USDL).
3 Universal Service Description Language
Products have usually a well defined set of possible variants for customization. For example, if
a consumer requires a faster laptop, a more powerful CPU can be designed, built and attached to
the motherboard. If a consumer (e.g. Yellow Cab Co.) desires yellow cars, a manufacturer only
needs to notify the production chain to select a new color. The same cannot be easily achieved
for services. This makes the description of services one of the most important undertakings for
the IoS. While Web services (e.g. SOAP/WSDL or REST Web services) are usually seen main-

ly as technological entities, the IoS will also embrace what we call universal services and re-
quires combining and correlating business, operational and IT aspects into service descriptions.
3.1 Limitation of WSDL for the IoS
The Web Service Description Language (WSDL) was developed to describe the technical de-
tails of how a Web service can be accessed and invoked remotely over the Web. It details tech-
nical requirements such as Internet addresses, ports, method names, arguments, and data types
used by a Web service. The emphasis of WSDL is on technical and implementation aspects of
services. WSDL was made to be used by computers. USDL has a different goal since it is also
to be used in the IoS by people and organizations.
The IoS has different requirements from the ones fulfilled with WSDL. While the technical
description of services is important for SOA, the business and operational perspectives on ser-
vices have a significant importance for the IoS. Therefore, the USDL aims at bridging the busi-
ness, operational and the technical perspectives. The business description includes the formal
specification of legal, marketing and bundling aspects. The operational description includes
functional and behavioral characteristics, and resource requirements. Finally, the technical de-
scription specifies how a service can be invoked and relies on references to WS-* protocols.
3.2 Enabling the IoS with USDL
With the proliferation of services in marketplaces as a business solution for enterprises and
consumers in general, the features of services offered will become of the highest importance. A
better description of the business and operational perspectives will bring to a marketplace an
advantage over competitive platforms by being an added value for service providers and con-
sumers. USDL enables to describe business characteristics exposed by an organization for the
purpose of providing a way for consumers to invoke and use services. The USDL schema de-
fines three core clusters of information that provide descriptions that a consumer can use to
discover, select, invoke services and have a view on servicesâ€™ behavior at execution time. These
three groups are the business, operational and technical clusters. Figure 1 shows an overview of
the USDL metamodel. As it can be seen from the figure, USDL has a strong emphasis on busi-
ness and operations. The technical perspective is reduced.
3.3 Business, Operations and Technical Perspectives
USDL brings together the business, operational and technical perspectives. The business pers-
pective describes properties that are fundamental for the characterization of a service. We rely
on a set of non-functional properties such as availability, payment, pricing, obligations, rights,
penalties, bundling, security and quality [OSu05]. In order to provide a suitable language that

can be understood by business stakeholders and consumers, the properties have been clustered
into seven groups (each group is called a subperspective and subperspectives contain proper-
ties): roles (providers and consumers), service level, marketing, legal, interaction, bundling and
an extension mechanism.

Figure 1. The formal model behind the USDL
The operational perspective describes the operations executed by services. It provides an un-
derstanding of what the service is providing from an operational perspective and, thus, what a
consumer can expect from a service. Important aspects modeled include operations, functionali-
ty, classifications, milestones and phases. USDL approach to the functional description of ser-
vices is multifaceted since it allows using natural language, keywords (i.e., tagging) and ontolo-
gies as fundamental structures to express the functionality of a service. This perspective in-
cludes concepts borrowed from the area of project management. For example, phases allow
creating groupings to provide a high level description of the business process associated with a
service. This implicit process description using phases can serve as a basis for service discovery
and indirect functional description and indicate the achievement of an important stage. Miles-
tones provide a way to express the major states that a service will reach during its execution.
