### Introduction to Remote Game Access and Web Server Vulnerabilities

Clients can remotely access a game through various web server solutions, such as the Apache Web Server, which is limited to HTTP, or the BEA WebLogic Application Server, which supports HTTP and additional protocols. Network servers are typically configured to handle large volumes of client requests, necessitating enhanced processing power, memory, and storage. These resources make them valuable targets for hackers. Since organizations often manage servers remotely without active monitoring, minor performance drops or other signs of compromise may go unnoticed. It is common for malicious users to exploit compromised servers for extended periods before the vulnerabilities are identified.

This chapter will focus on identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in web application servers. We will begin by exploring the tools available in Kali Linux for vulnerability identification, followed by methods for exploiting these vulnerabilities to gain access to web application servers. Finally, we will discuss other techniques for accessing web application services.

### Server-Side Attacks and Vulnerability Assessment

Server-side attacks involve finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in services, ports, and applications running on a server. For example, a web server has multiple attack vectors, including the operating system, software, and open TCP ports. Each of these vectors can harbor vulnerabilities that an attacker can exploit to gain unauthorized access and obtain sensitive information. Many server protocols use unencrypted, readable text, further increasing the risk of exploitation.

### Tools for Identifying Vulnerabilities in Kali Linux

#### Webshag

**Webshag** is a multi-threaded, multi-platform tool designed for auditing web servers. It offers functionalities such as port scanning, URL scanning, and file fuzzing. Webshag can scan web servers over HTTP or HTTPS, through a proxy, and with HTTP authentication (basic or digest). It also includes IDS evasion capabilities to complicate the correlation between requests.

**Key Features:**
- **Domain Name Retrieval:** Retrieves the list of domain names hosted on a target machine.
- **Dynamic Fuzzing:** Uses dynamically generated filenames for fuzzing.
- **Fingerprinting:** Resistant to content changes, designed to reduce false positives.
- **Export Options:** Data can be exported in XML, HTML, and TXT formats.

**Usage:**
- **GUI and Command-Line:** Available on both Linux and Windows platforms.
- **Tabs:** Each feature (Port Scanning, Spider, URL Scan, Fuzzing) has a dedicated tab.
- **Execution:** Enter the target URL, select the desired feature, and click OK to execute.

**Example:**
- **Screenshots:** The following screenshots demonstrate Webshag performing a port scan, web spider crawl, URL scan, and file fuzz on `www.thesecurityblogger.com`.

#### Skipfish

**Skipfish** is a web application security reconnaissance tool that creates an interactive sitemap using recursive crawling and dictionary-based probes. The resulting map is then scanned for security vulnerabilities.

**Key Features:**
- **Interactive Sitemap:** Provides a detailed map of the target.
- **Custom Dictionaries:** Supports built-in and customizable dictionaries for vulnerability assessment.
- **Output Formats:** Generates reports in a logical format, suitable for standalone documents or penetration test reports.

**Usage:**
- **Command Line:** Run from the Terminal.
- **Options:** Use the `-o` option to specify the output directory and the `-W` option to specify the wordlist location.
- **Example Command:**
  ```bash
  skipfish -o /root/Desktop/Skipfishoutput -W /root/Desktop/complete.wl http://www.thesecurityblogger.com
  ```

**Note:**
- **Default Dictionaries:** Default dictionaries may not run with the `-W` command. You can copy a default wordlist and remove the read-only flag to use it as a custom wordlist.

#### ProxyStrike

**ProxyStrike** is a web application proxy designed to identify vulnerabilities while browsing an application. It listens on port 8008 by default and requires browser configuration to route traffic through it.

**Key Features:**
- **Request Analysis:** Analyzes all parameters in the background while you browse the target's website.
- **Crawler Features:** Scans for SQL, SSL, and XSS plugin vulnerabilities.
- **Log and Crawler Tabs:** Provide detailed logs and lists of unique web links associated with the target.

**Usage:**
- **Browser Configuration:** Configure your browser (e.g., Firefox) to use ProxyStrike as a proxy.
- **Crawler Setup:** Enable plugins, enter the target website, and start the crawler.

#### Vega

**Vega** is a security testing tool that crawls a website and analyzes page content to find links and form parameters.

**Key Features:**
- **Scanner and Proxy Tabs:** Allows for both scanning and proxy functionalities.
- **Scan Options:** Offers various options for injection and response processing.
- **Detailed Reports:** Provides detailed explanations of vulnerabilities found.

**Usage:**
- **Launch Vega:** Go to Web Applications | Web Vulnerability Scanners and select Vega.
- **Start a New Scan:** Enter the target, select scan options, and start the scan.

#### OWASP ZAP

**OWASP ZAP (Zaproxy)** is an intercept proxy designed for the security testing of web applications.

**Key Features:**
- **SSL Root CA Certificate:** Allows interception of HTTPS traffic.
- **Proxy Configuration:** Routes browser traffic through Zaproxy.
- **Automatic Authentication:** Can be set up to automatically log in to websites during scans.

**Usage:**
- **Launch ZAP:** Go to Web Applications | Web Application Fuzzers and select owasp-zap.
- **Generate and Import Certificate:** Follow the prompts to generate and import the SSL certificate.
- **Configure Browser:** Set your browser to use Zaproxy as a proxy.

#### Websploit

**Websploit** is an open-source project for scanning and analyzing remote systems to find vulnerabilities.

**Key Features:**
- **Module-Based:** Uses modules for different types of attacks.
- **Terminal Interface:** Operates via a Terminal window.

**Usage:**
- **Access Websploit:** Go to Web Applications | Web Application Fuzzers and select websploit.
- **Run Modules:** Use the `show modules` command to see available modules, and `use` to select and run a specific module.

### Exploitation Using Metasploit

If a Penetration Tester invests the proper time and resources during the reconnaissance phase, they should end up with a list of potential vulnerabilities. The next step is to prioritize each target's value, estimate the effort required to exploit vulnerabilities, and assess the associated risks.

**Metasploit Framework:**
- **Popular Tool:** One of the most widely used tools for exploiting server-side vulnerabilities.
- **Created by HD Moore:** Launched in 2003, it is used for legitimate penetration testing and unauthorized exploitation.

**Usage:**
- **Start Services:** Ensure Postgres SQL and Metasploit services are started.
- **Launch Metasploit:** Open a console and type `msfconsole` to launch Metasploit.
- **Basic Commands:** Use `help` and `show` to navigate through the framework.
- **Nmap Integration:** Use `nmap` to scan the local network and import results into Metasploit.

**Example Command:**
```bash
nmap -n -oX my.xml network
```

**Import Results:**
- **XML File:** Import the results from the `nmap` scan into Metasploit using the XML file.
