to the world while clients would access the game remotely. There are various forms
of providing services to clients such as an Apache Web Server limited to HTTP or a
BEA WebLogic Application Server that does HTTP plus more.
Network servers are typically configured to handle the load of servicing large
volumes of clients. This means adding additional processing, memory and
storage making these assets valuable targets for hackers. Organizations typically
manage servers remotely and don't actively monitor activity, meaning small hits
in performance or other indicators of being compromised may go unnoticed. It's
common to find malicious users have accessed compromised servers for long periods
of time prior to the owners identifying the vulnerability used to access the system.
This chapter will focus on identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in web
application servers. We will start out with showcasing tools available in Kali used
to identify vulnerabilities. Next, we will focus on exploiting vulnerabilities to gain
access to web application servers. We will conclude with other methods to access
web application services.

Server-side Attacks
Vulnerability assessment
Server-side attacks are exploiting and finding vulnerabilities in services, ports,
and applications running on a server. For example, a web server has several attack
vectors. It is a server running an operating system and running various pieces of
software to provide web functionality. It has many open TCP ports. Each one of
these vectors could harvest a vulnerability that an attacker could exploit to get into
the system and obtain valuable information. Many protocols on servers are handled
through readable non-encrypted text.
Let's take a look at some tools available in Kali for identifying vulnerabilities
on servers.
Webshag
Webshag is a multi-threaded, multi-platform tool used to audit web servers.
Webshag gathers commonly useful functionalities for web servers such as port
scanning, URL scanning and file fuzzing. It can be used to scan a web server in
HTTP or HTTPS, through a proxy and using HTTP authentication (basic or digest).
In addition, Webshag can use IDS evasion capabilities aimed at making correlation
between requests more complicated.
Webshag provides additional innovative capabilities such as retrieving the list of
domain names hosted on a target machine as well as fuzzing using dynamically
generated filenames. Webshag can perform fingerprinting of web pages while being
resistant to content changes. This feature is designed as a false positive removal
algorithm aimed at dealing with "soft 404" server responses.
Webshag is accessed through a GUI or a command-line console and available with
the Linux and Windows platforms. Webshag can be found under Web Applications
| Web Vulnerability Scanners as webshag-gui.
Webshag is easy to use. Each feature has a tab on the top. Select the desired feature
tab, enter in your target URL under the target space and click on OK to execute. You
can run multiple tabs simultaneously. Features include Port Scanning, Spider, URL
Scan, and Fuzzing. The next four screenshots show Webshag performing a port scan,
web spider crawl, URL scan, and file Fuzz of www.thesecurityblogger.com:

Webshag offers exporting all data found during an audit in the XML, HTML, and
TXT file formats. Webshag's final report is organized in a logical format making it
worthy of use as a standalone document or article of reference for a Penetration Test
delivery report. The next two screenshots show exporting options and the top of a
audit report:

Skipfish
Skipfish is a web application security Reconnaissance tool. Skipfish prepares an
interactive sitemap for the target using recursive crawl and dictionary-based probes.
The resulting map provides output after being scanned by security checks.
Skipfish can be found under Web Applications | Web Vulnerability Scanners as
skipfish. When you first open Skipfish, a Terminal window will pop up showcasing
the Skipfish commands. Skipfish can use built-in or customizable dictionaries for
vulnerability assessment.
Note that some dictionaries may not be found in Kali. You can
download the latest version of Skipfish and default dictionaries
from https://code.google.com/p/skipfish/.
The available dictionaries are located in the dictionary file.
There are various command options available in Skipfish. To run Skipfish against a
target website using a custom wordlist, enter skipfish, select your wordlist using
the -W option followed by the location of the wordlist, select your output directory
using -o followed by the location, and finally the target website.
Skipfish –o (output location) –W (location of wordlist) (target website)
The following example shows a scan using a wordlist called complete.wl on
securityblogger.com. Skipfish will create a folder called Skipfishoutput
on the desktop. This is run using the keyword skipfish, –o /root/Desktop/
Skipfishoutput to specify the location to which send the output, -W /root/
Desktop/complete.wl to specify the location of the dictionary and http://
www.thesecuirtyblogger.com as the target to scan against.
[ 78 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Chapter 3
Note that the default skipfish dictionaries will not run when using the
–W command. You can copy a default wordlist and remove the read-only
in the first line of the list (#ro) to run as a custom wordlist. This is shown
in the following screenshot:
If there are no compiling errors, you will be presented with a launch screen that
states the scan will start in 60 seconds or on pressing any key.
[ 79 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Server-side Attacks
You can press the Spacebar to see the details on the scan or watch the default numbers
run. Scanning a target can take anywhere from 30 seconds to a few hours to complete
the process. You can end a scan early by typing Ctrl + C.
Once the scan is complete or if you end it early, Skipfish will generate a ton of output
files in the location specified when using the –o option to designate an output folder.
To see the results, click on the index.html file, which will bring up an Internet
browser. You can click through the drop-down boxes to see your results. See the
example reports section for more information.

ProxyStrike
ProxyStrike is a web application proxy built to identify vulnerabilities while browsing
an application. It runs like a proxy listening on port 8008 by default, meaning you
have to configure your Internet browser to run through ProxyStrike so that it can
analyze all the parameters in the background while your surf the target's website.
The proxy features are great for identifying, intercepting, and modifying requests.
To configure an Internet browser such as Firefox to use ProxyStrike, select in FireFox
Preferences | Advanced | Network and select Settings. Select Manual Proxy and
enter the IP address of your Kali server followed by the port of 8008 (unless you plan
to change the ProxyStrike default port).
[ 81 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Server-side Attacks
To use ProxyStrike, go to Web Applications | Web Vulnerability Scanners and
select ProxyStrike. Assuming your Internet browser is sending traffic to ProxyStrike,
you should see captured traffic in the Comms tab. We will spend more time using
Proxies in Chapter 6, Web Attacks.
The crawler features are an easy way to scan a target website for SQL or SSL and
XSS plugin vulnerabilities. You do not have to have ProxyStrike set up as a proxy to
use the crawler features. To run the crawler feature on a website with XSS plugins,
click on the Plugins tab, scroll to the XSS plugs, and select to enable the plugins
using the checkbox. Next, select the crawler tab. Enter the target website including
http://, check the crawl using the plugins box and click on the large Stop button
to change it to Running. Adding the plugins will increase the time to complete a
scan. ProxyStrike will display a status bar providing an estimate on how long a scan
should take.

You can set up automatic login using Zaproxy; however, you will have to first
manually log into a website while Zaproxy is enabled, tell Zaproxy where the
login and logout requests are and enable the auto-login feature. The GET requests
will appear in the Sites window and you must highlight both the login and logout
responses under the Responses tab by right-clicking on the response, clicking on
Flag as Content and selecting if it's the login or logout.
An icon with a brown line will appear on the toolbar representing automatic
authentication. Click on that icon to enable automatic authentication so that
Zaproxy can automatically log in to any authentication request while doing an
automated assessment of a target. This feature is helpful to auto-explore a website
that requires authentication.

Server-side Attacks
Exploitation
If a Penetration Tester invests the proper time and resources during the
Reconnaissance of a target, the Penetration Tester should end up with a list of targets
with possible vulnerabilities. The next step is prioritizing each target's value to your
mission, approximating the level of effort required to exploit potential vulnerabilities,
and judging the associated risk with performing the attack. The vulnerability and
exploitation available in Kali are ideal for identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities
found during the Reconnaissance of web application servers.
Metasploit
The Metasploit framework is one of the most popular tools for exploiting server-side
attacks. It is considered one of the most useful tools for Penetration Testers. HD Moore
created it in 2003. It is used as a legitimate Penetration Testing tool, as well as a tool
used by attackers to conduct unauthorized exploitation of systems.
There are a plenty of sources dedicated to teaching how to use the Metasploit
framework. In the context of this book, we will examine how Metasploit is used
for server-side exploitation for testing potential web applications.
Note to make sure Postgres SQL and Metasploit services are started.
You can do so by typing service postgres start and service
metasploit start in the Terminal window as root.
The first step is to open up a console and type in msfconsole to launch Metsaploit.
msfconsole is the most popular way to launch Metasploit. It provides a user
interface to access the entire Metasploit framework. Basic commands such as
help and show will allow you to navigate through Metasploit.
Note that there are other methods to launch Metasploit such as
msfgui (GUI-based) and msfcli (command line-based).
In addition to Metasploit commands, msfconsole will allow you to invoke
underlying OS commands such as ping or nmap. This is helpful because it
allows an attacker to execute routine tasks without leaving the console.
In our first step, we will use nmap to scan the local network. The results can
be automatically added into Metasploit using an XML file.
[ 96 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Chapter 3
The command we issue is:
nmap -n -oX my.xml network
We will import our results from nmap into Metasploit using the XML file we created.
