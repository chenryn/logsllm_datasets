### Issue with `with-firebase-hosting` Project

**Description:**
When I run `npm run serve` and navigate to `localhost:5000/`, I encounter a 404 page. I have searched the issues in this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.

**Expected Behavior:**
- The server should start, and the home page should be displayed.

**Current Behavior:**
- A 404 page is shown instead of the expected home page.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the project dependencies and configure it with my Firebase project name.
3. Run `npm run serve`.
4. Navigate to `localhost:5000/` in the browser.

If you need any additional information or logs, please let me know.

Thank you!
