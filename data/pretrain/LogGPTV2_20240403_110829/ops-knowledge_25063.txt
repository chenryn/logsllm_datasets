Certainly! Here is a more refined and professional version of the log line template:

```
Connection request from old client /<IP_ADDRESS>:<PORT>; will be dropped if server is in read-only mode
```

In this template:
- `<IP_ADDRESS>` represents the IP address (e.g., `10.10.34.37`).
- `<PORT>` represents the port number (e.g., `34701`).
- "read-only mode" is used to clearly indicate the server's state.
