User: As soon as Airflow starts, None of the dag runs for a particular dag are executed and reaches maximum active dags. Even after setting the dag run state to success, Scheduler doesn't seem to move the newly scheduled task to execution state. All the active dag runs remain in 'running' state. This happens for some dags alone. Can someone please help on this?
Assistant: This means that the dag_concurrency is set to a smaller number of concurrent task than you are trying to use. there is a file called airflow.cfg where you can change some execution configurations, one is the dag_concurrency, it is probably set to '6' increase it to your necessity, just make sure it doesn't exceed the number of parallelism that may cause problems.
