### Control Descriptions and Rationale

| Control | Severity | Automated Fix Script | Description & Rationale |
|---------|----------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| **No Public IPs on ExpressRoute-Connected VMs** | High | Yes | Public IP addresses on an ExpressRoute-connected virtual network can expose the corporate network to security threats from the internet. |
| **No Multiple NICs on ExpressRoute-Connected VMs** | Medium | Yes | Using multiple NICs can route traffic between the ExpressRoute-connected virtual network and another non-ExpressRoute-connected virtual network, potentially putting the corporate network at risk. In advanced scenarios where multi-NIC VMs are required, a review by the network security team is necessary. |
| **Disable IP Forwarding for NICs in ExpressRoute-Connected vNet** | High | Yes | Enabling IP forwarding can alter the routing of packets, leading to bypassing network protections essential for corporate network traffic. IP forwarding may be required in advanced scenarios like Network Virtual Appliances, but such cases should be reviewed by the network security team. |
| **No NSGs on GatewaySubnet of ExpressRoute-Connected vNet** | Medium | Yes | Applying Network Security Groups (NSGs) to the Gateway subnet of an ExpressRoute-connected virtual network can disrupt the connection and impact availability. |
| **No UDR on Any Subnet in ExpressRoute-Connected vNet** | High | Yes | User-Defined Routes (UDRs) on any subnet of an ExpressRoute-connected virtual network can lead to security vulnerabilities by allowing traffic to evade inspection from network security scanners. |
| **No Other Virtual Network Gateways in ExpressRoute-Connected vNet** | High | Yes | Using other gateway types (e.g., GatewayType = Vpn) on an ExpressRoute-connected virtual network can create pathways for corporate network traffic that may be exposed to the internet or bypass security inspections, posing a direct risk to corporate network security. |
| **No Virtual Network Peerings on ExpressRoute-Connected vNet** | High | Yes | Virtual network peerings on an ExpressRoute-connected circuit can establish links to other virtual networks, allowing traffic to evade inspection from network security appliances, thus creating a direct risk to corporate network security. |
| **Only Internal Load Balancers (ILBs) in ExpressRoute-Connected vNet** | High | Yes | External load balancers on an ExpressRoute-connected virtual network can expose the corporate network to security threats from the internet. Only internal load balancers should be used. |
| **Only Microsoft.Network/* Resources in ERNetwork Resource Group** | High | Yes | The ERNetwork resource group is a critical component for provisioning an ExpressRoute connection. It should only contain resources of type `Microsoft.Network/*` and should not be used as a general-purpose resource group. Unauthorized use can impact the ExpressRoute connectivity of your subscription. |
| **Protect ERNetwork Resource Group with a Resource Lock** | High | Yes | The ERNetwork resource group is crucial for maintaining ExpressRoute connectivity. A resource lock is deployed to prevent accidental deletion. Removing this lock increases the risk of unintentional modifications, which can affect the ExpressRoute connectivity of your subscription. |
| **Deploy ARM Policies to Protect ERNetwork Setup** | High | Yes | ARM policies should be deployed to ensure the protection of the ERNetwork setup. |

This table provides a clear and structured overview of the controls, their severity, whether an automated fix script is available, and the rationale behind each control.
