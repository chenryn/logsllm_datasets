ERvNetDescription & RationaleControlSeverityAutomatedFix ScriptThere must not be any Public IPs (i.e., NICs with PublicIP) on ExpressRoute-connected VMsPublic IP addresses on an ER-connected virtual network can expose the corporate network to security attacks from the internet.HighYesNoThere must not be multiple NICs on ExpressRoute-connected VMsUsing multiple NICs, one can route traffic between the ER-connected virtual network and another non-ER-connected virtual network. This can put the corporate network at risk. (Multi-NIC VMs on an ER-connected virtual network may be required in some advanced scenarios. You should engage the network security team for a review in such cases.)MediumYesNoThe 'EnableIPForwarding' flag must not be set to true for NICs in the ExpressRoute-connected vNetUsing IP Forwarding one can change the routing of packets from an ER-connected virtual network. This can lead to bypass of network protections that are required and applicable for corpnet traffic. (IP Forwarding on an ER-connected virtual network may be required only in advanced scenarios such as Network Virtual Applicances. You should engage the network security team for a review in such cases.)HighYesNoThere must not be any NSGs on the GatewaySubnet of the ExpressRoute-connected vNetUsing NSGs on the Gateway subnet of an ER-connected virtual network can cause the connection to stop functioning and may impact availability.MediumYesNoThere must not be a UDR on *any* subnet in an ExpressRoute-connected vNetUsing UDRs on any subnet of an ER-connected virtual network can lead to security exposure for corpnet traffic by allowing it to be routed in a way that evades inspection from network security scanners.HighYesNoThere must not be another virtual network gateway (GatewayType = Vpn) in an ExpressRoute-connected vNetUsing other gateway types on an ER-connected virtual network can lead to pathways for corpnet traffic where the traffic can get exposed to the internet or evade inspection from network security scanners. This creates a direct risk to corpnet security.HighYesNoThere must not be any virtual network peerings on an ExpressRoute-connected vNetA virtual network peering on an ER-connected circuit establishes a link to another virtual network whereby traffic egress and ingress can evade inspection from network security appliances. This creates a direct risk to corpnet security.HighYesNoOnly internal load balancers (ILBs) may be used inside an ExpressRoute-connected vNetExternal load balancers on an ER-connected vNet can expose the corporate network to security attacks from the internet.HighYesNoOnly resources of type Microsoft.Network/* must be added in the ERNetwork resource groupThe ERNetwork resource group is a critical component that facilitates provisioning of an ER-connection for your subscription. This resource group is deployed and managed by the networking team and should not be used as a general purpose resource group or as a container for non-networking resources as it can impact the ER-connectivity of your subscription.HighYesNoEnsure that the ERNetwork resource group is protected with a resource lockThe ERNetwork resource group is a critical component that facilitates provisioning of an ER-connection for your subscription. A resource lock is deployed on the ERNetwork resource group to keep you from deleting it accidentally. Removing this lock increases the chances of accidental write/delete of this resource group and that can impact ER-connectivity of your subscription.HighYesNoEnsure that ARM policies are deployed to protect the ERNetwork setupHighYesNo
