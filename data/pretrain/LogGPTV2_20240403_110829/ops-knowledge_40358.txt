User: Macs return a Posixpath when the user enters a path. Windows returns a WindowsPath object when the user does the same thing. Is there a way for me to check whether the input is valid depending on the machine?
Assistant: os.path.sep gives you the path separator for the platform, \\ for windows and / for unix. 
But the thing is if you need this to implement a if else, then don't do that way. The os.path functions are aware of platform specific behavior and they will take care of it.
