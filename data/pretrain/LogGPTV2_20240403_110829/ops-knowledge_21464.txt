User: In a Linux system, how to use an SSH key pair to implement password-free login to facilitate the execution of automated scripts?
Assistant: The following are the steps for using an SSH key pair to implement password-free login: 1. Generate a public key and a private key: Open a terminal on the local machine, and use the ssh-keygen command to generate a public key and a private key. Press Enter to select the default path and default name. ``` ssh-keygen ``` 2. Transfer the public key to the target host: To transfer the public key file to the target host, you can use the ssh-copy-id command, or manually copy the public key to ~/ on the target host .ssh/authorized_keys file. ``` ssh-copy-id username@remote_host ``` 3. Test password-free login: Now you can try to log in to the target host from the local machine without entering a password. ``` ssh username@remote_host ``` 4. Use of automated scripts: When using ssh commands in automated scripts, just specify the private key file. ``` ssh -i /path/to/private_key username@remote_host ``` Precautions: - Make sure the permission of the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file of the target host is 600, otherwise the login may fail. - The private key file of the SSH key pair should not be seen by others and should be kept properly.
