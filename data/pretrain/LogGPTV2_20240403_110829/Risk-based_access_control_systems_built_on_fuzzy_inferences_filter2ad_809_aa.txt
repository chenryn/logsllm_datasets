Abstract: Most current access control models are rigid, as they are designed using static policies
that always give the same outcome in diﬀerent circumstances. In addition, they cannot adapt to
environmental changes and unpredicted situations. With dynamic systems such as the Internet of
Things (IoT) with billions of things that are distributed everywhere, these access control models are
obsolete. Hence, dynamic access control models are required. These models utilize not only access
policies but also contextual and real-time information to determine the access decision. One of these
dynamic models is the risk-based access control model. This model estimates the security risk value
related to the access request dynamically to determine the access decision. Recently, the risk-based
access control model has attracted the attention of several organizations and researchers to provide
more ﬂexibility in accessing system resources. Therefore, this paper provides a systematic review
and examination of the state-of-the-art of the risk-based access control model to provide a detailed
understanding of the topic. Based on the selected search strategy, 44 articles (of 1044 articles) were
chosen for a closer examination. Out of these articles, the contributions of the selected articles were
summarized. In addition, the risk factors used to build the risk-based access control model were
extracted and analyzed. Besides, the risk estimation techniques used to evaluate the risks of access
control operations were identiﬁed.

1. Introduction
Security is the nightmare for almost all new technologies. Providing a secure system is not an
easy task. One of the signiﬁcant components to resolve security challenges is to build an eﬃcient and
eﬀective access control model. This model is utilized to manage access to system resources by allowing
only authorized users who have been authenticated successfully. An access control model comprises
three main items: subject, target and rules. Subjects are system users who make the access request to
access system resources (targets). Rules are utilized to make the access decision, whether granting

or denying access [1,2]. The main purpose of the access control is to decline unauthorized users and
reduce the tasks of authorized users on a certain device. In addition, it prevents the action that could
trigger a security violation [3].
There are two classes of access control approaches: traditional and dynamic. Traditional access
control approaches utilize rigid and predetermined policies to determine the access decision. These static
policies provide the same decision in diﬀerent circumstances. Therefore, this inﬂexible approach cannot
provide a robust security method for various dynamic and distributed systems such as the Internet
of Things (IoT) and cloud computing [4]. Alternatively, dynamic access control methods employ not
only static policies but also dynamic and real-time features to make access decisions. These dynamic
features can involve context, trust, history events, location, time, and security risk [5].
Risk-based access control model is one of the dynamic methods that utilize the security risk value
related to each access request as a criterion to determine access decisions [1]. A risk-based access
control model provides several beneﬁts over current access models. For example, it delivers more
ﬂexibility and resilience while accessing system resources by utilizing dynamic and contextual features
to determine the access decision. In addition, it considers the exceptional and unpredicted access
requests that are essential for some applications such as healthcare and the military, where granting
access can literally save thousands of lives [6]. The ultimate goal of the risk-based access control model
is to produce a scheme that promotes information sharing to increase the organization’s beneﬁt and
at the same time keeps users responsible for their activities and stops the anticipated damage due to
sensitive information disclosure [4].
The objective of the paper is to present a systematic literature review and investigate the
state-of-the-art of the risk-based access control model, which is one of the pillars toward designing a
dynamic and adaptive access control model for distributed systems. Based on the selected search plan,
44 articles (of 1044 articles) were chosen for closer investigation. Out of the retrieved and analyzed
articles, the risk factors utilized to design the risk-based access control model were extracted and
analyzed. Besides, the risk estimation techniques used to evaluate security risks were identiﬁed.
In addition, the contributions of the selected articles were summarized. As compared to other surveys,
to the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the ﬁrst paper that provides a systematic literature review
for the risk-based access control model.

2. An Overview of Access Control
The key objective of the access control is to limit operations performed by authorized users.
In addition, it prohibits any action that could trigger a security violation [1]. An eﬀective access
control model should fulﬁll the security demands of conﬁdentiality, integrity, and availability [3]. It is
essential to make a reasonable distinction between authentication, authorization, and access control.
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user [7], while allowing or denying access
to an authenticated user to carry out particular tasks on particular resources is called authorization.
Access control is the process of enforcing authorization policies. Once a user is authenticated and
Future Internet 2020, 12, 103

the authorization level is identiﬁed, access control is used to enforce user permissions to prevent the
user/subject from accessing anything that he/she should not be able to [3].
The history of the phrase “Access Control” has started in transportation in the ﬁrst half of the
20th century. The concept of the limited-access road was suggested in 1907 to control fast-growing
motor traﬃc. Although early cars were not as fast as today’s standard, car drivers were enforced to
control their speed on highways. They were enforced to enter and exit via one-way ramps to control the
access to highways, which led to a reduction in the probability of cross-traﬃc accidents and increases
the speed of traﬃc ﬂows [8].
Currently, access control is applied at diverse levels in several domains such as database
management systems and operating systems to control resources and allow only legal users/subjects to
use system resources in an authorized way. An access control model comprises of ﬁve core elements:
subjects, actions, objects, privileges, and access policies [9].
•
Subjects: represents various entities that can be user, agents, or processes that make an access
request to access system resources (objects).
• Objects: describes system resources encompassing data or information that needed to be accessed
•
•
•
by subjects/users.
Actions: represents various types of actions or activities that subjects can perform on a particular
object such as read, write, execute, etc.
Privileges: These are the permissions that are granted to subjects to be able to carry out a particular
action on a particular object.
Access policies: These are a group of rules or procedures that specify the criteria needed to
determine the access decision whether granting or denying access for each access request.
The ﬂow of an access control process can be shown in Figure 1. The ﬂow begins when a subject/user
sends an access request to the access control manager to access a particular object. Then, the access
control manager compares the subject’s credentials against access policies to decide whether granting
or denying access. If the access is granted, the access control manager will allow the user to access the
object. While if the access is denied, the access control manager will send a warning message due to
insuﬃcient credentials and ask the subject to use suﬃcient credentials to be able to access the requested
object [9].

There are many access control approaches, which can be categorized into two main groups:
traditional and dynamic access control approaches.
2.1. Traditional Access Control Models
Traditional access control (also called classical or static) approaches utilize rigid and predetermined
policies to determine the access decision. These static and rigid policies provide the same decision in
diﬀerent circumstances. Although traditional access control approaches were successfully applied
in diﬀerent environments to solve various problems, these approaches are designed to provide a
relationship between information associated with an access control rule logic and a resource for which
access is requested. The implementation of an access control approach is subject to manipulation,
which can range from an unexpected situation, including poorly written access policies to several
malicious entities acquiring access to a set of existing accounts. Therefore, traditional access control
approaches provide a set of advantages, but they also have drawbacks. One of these drawbacks is
that it cannot handle unpredicted situations as they are based on static and predeﬁned policies [10].
This inﬂexible approach cannot provide a robust security method for various dynamic and distributed
systems such as IoT and Cloud Computing, which need more ﬂexibility in accessing system resources.
Instead, this static approach can be the best solution in situations where there is no way to collect a
contextual feature/attribute while making the access request, for example the operating system.
There are various traditional access control approaches including Access Control List (ACL),
Discretionary Access Control (DAC), Mandatory Access Control (MAC), and Role-Based Access
Control (RBAC). ACL is a list of speciﬁc objects that involve lawful users together with their access
permissions. ACLs are utilized in various systems, for example, UNIX systems. Although ACL is
an eﬃcient and eﬀective model, it is not scalable, in which it cannot cope with a huge list of objects
and subjects. For DAC, it is mainly built for multi-user databases and systems with few previously
known users. Granting access in DAC is mainly based on the subject identity and authorization that
are determined using open policies. This enables the object’s owner to allow access to this object to any
subject. For MAC, the level of sensitivity of objects is used to categorize objects into several sensitivity
levels—for example, sensitive, not sensitive, conﬁdential, etc. Each object has a label that speciﬁes the
sensitivity level of that object. In addition, each subject has a label that speciﬁes the object the subject
can access [11,12]. For RBAC, it involves three main components: users or subjects, roles (collections of
permissions), and actions (activities performed on target resources) [13]. The basis of RBAC depends
on roles, in which each role is accompanied by a set of access permissions. Each organization has
several roles—for example, client, employee, manager, administrator, etc. A user can be a member of
one or more roles, and a role can involve one or more users [14].
2.2. Dynamic Access Control Models
The core principle of dynamic access control models is that they consider not only access policies
but also dynamic and contextual features that are collected at the time of the access request to
make access decisions [15]. This provides more ﬂexibility and can adjust to various situations and
circumstances while making the access decision.
The need to adopt dynamic access control approaches should be one of the essential priorities
to provide eﬃcient and ﬂexible access control model. However, most existing access methods are
relying on static and rigid access policies and manual processes. These approaches are unable to
provide a roadmap to improve automation signiﬁcantly. This absence of automation results in a heavy
involvement of human analysis that is error-prone and susceptible to various types of attacks based
on social engineering. Additionally, current classical approaches have issues with resolving risks
and threats in real time, especially when handling a previously unidentiﬁed threat. This is because
these approaches make their access decision based on a set of policies built by a security analyst, who
cannot resolve diﬀerent access control situations in real time but can deal only with problems that were
recognized before [16].
Future Internet 2020, 12, 103

Instead of static policies, dynamic access methods use dynamic and real-time features to provide
access decisions. These dynamic features can include trust, context, history, risk and operational
need. Besides, these dynamic methods can adapt to diﬀerent situations and circumstances at the
time of deciding access decisions [5,17]. This dynamic access control approach can be valuable for
several applications such as healthcare and the military, where considering exceptional access requests
to provide the access can literally save thousands of lives. Table 1 provides a comparison between
traditional and dynamic access control approaches.

3. Risk-Based Access Control Model
Commonly, the risk is the possibility of loss or injury. It is about some incident that may arise
in the future and cause losses. According to Elky [18], the risk is deﬁned as “the possible damage that
may arise from the existing operation or from some upcoming incident”. The risk is found in numerous
domains of our life. From the information technology security perspective, the security risk is deﬁned
as the damage that undesirably aﬀects operation and its related information, while the process of
understanding and mitigating against issues that may result in a breach of conﬁdentiality, integrity,
or availability of an information system is called risk management [18].
Security risk in the access control context can be deﬁned as the possibility of information leakage
and the value of this information that may occur from accessing system resources [1]. Risk-based
access control model utilizes the security risk as a criterion to make the access decision for each access
request. This model is based on estimating the security risk value associated with each access request
dynamically, and it then uses the estimated risk value to decide whether granting or denying access [4].
Mathematically, the most popular formula to represent the risk in a quantitative form is the likelihood/
probability of an incident to occur multiplied by the impact regarding that incident [19].
There are several methods to build a risk-based access control model. These methods have certain
common features from diﬀerent models. The main elements of a risk-based access control model
are shown in Figure 2. The risk-based access control model comprises three key modules. The risk
estimation is the main module, which gets access requests from users, analyzes them, collects the
required information of risk factors, and estimates the security risk value related to each access request.
Then, the estimated risk value is compared against access policies to decide the access decision whether
granting or denying the access [20].

4. Methodology
The risk-based access control model has several advantages in terms of ﬂexibility and ability to
provide an eﬀective security model for dynamic systems. This systematic literature review is conducted
to examine and investigate current research regarding risk-based access control models and explain
the ﬁndings of the conducted review. A systematic literature review is mainly conducted as a way
to specify, evaluate, and interpret all available research related to speciﬁc research questions, certain
subjects, or phenomenon of interest [21].

Conducting a systematic literature review passed through ﬁve stages, as depicted in Figure 3.
The ﬁrst stage aims to formulate the research questions that the current review paper attempts to
answer and then decide the criteria to include or exclude articles in the second stage to make sure that
the selected articles are the best and most appropriate regarding the review objectives. The third stage
is the main stage that discusses at length which diﬀerent databases will be searched to locate relevant
articles. The fourth stage analyzes the results and then in the ﬁfth stage, the results of each research
question will be discussed.
Figure 3. Stages of the current systematic literature review.
This approach/methodology was adopted to make the reader fully aware of the stages of conducting
this systematic literature review. The methodology was started by deﬁning the research questions to
have a speciﬁc target while reviewing multiple publications. Then, inclusion and exclusion criteria
were presented to show how the retrieved publication are ﬁltered to reach the target of the study. Data
sources where publications were retrieved are also presented to show the digital libraries utilized to
collect these publications. In addition, the selection of relevant articles is discussed. The adopted
methodology has several advantages in which it aims to describe the full process utilized to reach the
target of the study to make the reader fully aware of all the procedures conducted by the researcher.
In addition, this approach was adopted in several previous systematic literature reviews. On the other
hand, this approach produces some drawbacks in which it limits the scope of the review/study, which
may not give all the information about a certain topic to the reader.
