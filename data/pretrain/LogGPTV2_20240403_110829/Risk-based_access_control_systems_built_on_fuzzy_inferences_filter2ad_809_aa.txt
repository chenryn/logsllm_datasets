## Abstract
Most current access control models are inflexible, as they rely on static policies that produce the same outcomes regardless of context. These models fail to adapt to environmental changes and unforeseen circumstances, making them unsuitable for dynamic systems like the Internet of Things (IoT). Dynamic access control models, such as risk-based access control, address these limitations by incorporating contextual and real-time information into the decision-making process. This paper provides a systematic review of the state-of-the-art in risk-based access control models, summarizing the contributions of 44 selected articles from a pool of 1044. The review identifies and analyzes the risk factors and estimation techniques used in these models.

## 1. Introduction
Security is a critical concern for emerging technologies. Building an effective access control model is essential for addressing security challenges. Traditional access control models use rigid, predetermined policies, which are inadequate for dynamic and distributed systems like IoT and cloud computing. In contrast, dynamic access control models, such as risk-based access control, utilize both static policies and dynamic, real-time information to make access decisions. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the risk-based access control model, summarizing the contributions of recent studies, identifying risk factors, and examining risk estimation techniques.

## 2. Overview of Access Control
Access control is designed to manage user access to system resources, ensuring that only authorized users can perform specific actions. Effective access control must balance the security principles of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Key components of an access control model include subjects, objects, actions, privileges, and access policies.

### 2.1. Traditional Access Control Models
Traditional access control models, such as Access Control Lists (ACL), Discretionary Access Control (DAC), Mandatory Access Control (MAC), and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), use static, predefined policies. While these models are straightforward and easy to maintain, they lack flexibility and cannot adapt to changing conditions or handle unexpected situations.

### 2.2. Dynamic Access Control Models
Dynamic access control models incorporate real-time, contextual information to make more flexible and adaptive access decisions. These models are better suited for dynamic and distributed systems, where the ability to respond to changing conditions and handle exceptional cases is crucial. Examples of dynamic access control models include risk-based and trust-based access control.

## 3. Risk-Based Access Control Model
Risk-based access control models use the estimated security risk associated with an access request to determine whether to grant or deny access. The security risk is typically calculated as the likelihood of an incident multiplied by its potential impact. This model enhances flexibility and adaptability, making it suitable for dynamic environments.

### 3.1. Main Elements of a Risk-Based Access Control Model
A risk-based access control model consists of three key modules:
1. **Risk Estimation:** Analyzes access requests, collects relevant risk factors, and estimates the security risk.
2. **Policy Evaluation:** Compares the estimated risk value against predefined access policies to make an access decision.
3. **Access Decision:** Grants or denies access based on the comparison.
