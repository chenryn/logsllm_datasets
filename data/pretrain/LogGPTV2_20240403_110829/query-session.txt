### Query Session

**Applies to:**
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
The `query session` command displays information about sessions on a Remote Desktop Session Host (RDSH) server. This includes both active and other sessions that the server is running.

**Note:**
To learn about new features in the latest version, see [What's New in Remote Desktop Services in Windows Server](#).

**Syntax:**
```shell
query session [SessionName | UserName | SessionID] [/server:<ServerName>] [/mode] [/flow] [/connect] [/counter]
```

**Parameters:**

- **SessionName:** Specifies the name of the session you want to query.
- **UserName:** Specifies the name of the user whose sessions you want to query.
- **SessionID:** Specifies the ID of the session you want to query.
- **/server:<ServerName>:** Identifies the RDSH server to query. The default is the current server.
- **/mode:** Displays the current line settings.
- **/flow:** Displays the current flow-control settings.
- **/connect:** Displays the current connect settings.
- **/counter:** Displays the current counters information, including the total number of sessions created, disconnected, and reconnected.
- **/? :** Displays help at the command prompt.

**Remarks:**
- A user can always query the session to which they are currently logged on. To query other sessions, the user must have special access permissions.
- If you do not specify a session using the `SessionName`, `UserName`, or `SessionID` parameters, the query will display information about all active sessions in the system.
- When `query session` returns information, a greater than (>) symbol is displayed before the current session. For example:
  ```shell
  C:\>query session
      SESSIONNAME     USERNAME        ID   STATE    TYPE    DEVICE
      console         Administrator1  0    active   wdcon
      >rdp-tcp#1      User1           1    active   wdtshare
      rdp-tcp                          2    listen   wdtshare
                                      4    idle
                                      5    idle
  ```

**Examples:**
- To display information about all active sessions on server `Server2`:
  ```shell
  query session /server:Server2
  ```
- To display information about the active session `modeM02`:
  ```shell
  query session modeM02
  ```

This command is useful for administrators who need to monitor and manage sessions on an RDSH server.
