### Analysis of Malicious QR Codes and Web Category Changes

#### Introduction
Our study focused on the analysis of malicious QR codes, particularly those that cause changes in web categories. We observed significant category shifts between "personal/business" and "free download," as well as between "news" and "personal/business." These shifts often occur when a user scans a malicious QR code, leading them to a landing page in a different web category.

#### Methodology
To understand the impact of these category changes, we analyzed how many malicious QR codes interconnect different web categories. Specifically, we examined whether scanning a malicious QR code from one category would lead the user to a landing page in another category, resulting in an outgoing category change during the attack.

**Key Findings:**
- **Category Change Frequency:** For 53% of the malicious QR codes, the category of the extracted URL differed from the category where the QR code was originally found.
- **Personal/Business Category:** This category showed approximately 14% category changes, interacting with all other categories.
- **Attack Vectors:** Some attackers posted malicious QR codes on websites where users typically share posts or links, luring them to download pages for resources hosted in the "free download" category.

#### Attack Strategies
We identified five main attack strategies used by attackers:
1. **Malware Delivery:** Malicious QR codes can deliver malware for both Windows and mobile platforms via direct download links.
2. **Phishing Sites:** Users are directed to phishing sites designed to steal authentication credentials or payment information.
3. **Intermediate Sites:** These sites have known vulnerabilities that are exploited to host malicious dynamic scripts, which then redirect users to phishing or exploit sites.
4. **Exploit Sites:** These sites host exploit kits that automatically detect and compromise vulnerable applications on the victim's device.
5. **Trust Abuse:** Attackers use QR codes to leverage trust in known brands or websites, directing victims to fake versions of popular sites.

#### Detailed Analysis
**B. Distributing Malware**
1. **Directing Users to Exploit or Intermediate Sites:**
   - **Injection of Malicious Code:** Attackers inject malicious code into intermediate websites, redirecting victims to landing pages designed to initiate drive-by download attacks.
   - **URL Classification:** We classified malicious QR codes by comparing their URLs with our archive of known malicious URLs. URLs ending in .htm, .html, or .php were manually inspected to determine their redirection patterns.
   - **Statistics:**
     - **Intermediate Sites:** 8.8% of all attacks involved directing users to intermediate sites, primarily in the "free download" category.
     - **Compromised Websites:** These sites often run outdated versions of WordPress or plugins with known vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to inject hidden iframes with obfuscated JavaScript.
     - **Exploit Sites:** 32% of total QR codes directed users to exploit websites. The lifetime of these URLs was very short, with only five successfully resolved at the time of writing.

**C. Phishing**
1. **Fake Business Websites:**
   - **Google Play Impersonation:** We identified 11 malicious QR codes leading to fake versions of Google Play, offering malicious Android apps. These URLs were designed to mimic the legitimate site, making it difficult for users to detect the deception.
   - **Example Scenario:** Figure 12a shows a website from the "free downloads" category hosting a malicious QR code with a spoofed Google Play URL.

2. **Fake Password-protected or Payment-related Websites:**
   - **Credential Theft:** 37 QR codes redirected users to fake password-protected or payment-related websites aimed at stealing user credentials or payment information.
   - **Facebook Phishing:** Facebook was one of the most abused brands, with 48% of total phishing attacks involving fake Facebook accounts.
   - **Typical Scenario:** Figure 12b illustrates a scenario where users are encouraged to "like" a page on a fake Facebook page, followed by a request to enter their credentials.

#### Geographical and Top-Level Domain (TLD) Analysis
- **Top TLDs and Countries:**
  - **TLDs:** .com (42.1%), .net (11.7%), .org (7.60%), .biz (6.21%), .ru (13.1%), .br (8.96%), .info (1.38%), Others (8.97%)
  - **Countries:** US (33.8%), Russia (14.9%), Netherlands (13.1%), China (11.0%), Brazil (9.66%), Germany (8.28%), France (6.90%), Vietnam (2.76%)

**Conclusion:**
The analysis of malicious QR codes reveals a significant threat landscape, with attackers using various strategies to exploit user trust and deliver malware or steal sensitive information. Understanding these attack vectors is crucial for developing effective countermeasures and enhancing user awareness.
