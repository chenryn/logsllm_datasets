I was attempting to install Python 2.6 using `pyenv`, but encountered the following error when running `pyenv install 2.6.9`:

```
checking MACHDEP... darwin
checking EXTRAPLATDIR... $(PLATMACDIRS)
checking machine type as reported by uname -m... x86_64
checking for --without-gcc... no
checking for gcc... gcc
checking whether the C compiler works... no
configure: error: in `/var/folders/r9/771hsm9931sd81ppz31384p80000gn/T/python-build.20150213191018.2121/Python-2.6.9':
configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables
```

I had already installed Xcode 4.6.3 and the Command Line Tools, but the issue persisted.

**Solution:**

After further investigation, I identified the problem. The error was related to the missing `ld` library for `-lgcc_ext.10.5`. The GCC version provided by Xcode 4.6.3 on Mac OS X Lion is 4.6, which is not compatible with the installation process.

To resolve this, I followed these steps:

1. **Install a newer version of GCC via Homebrew:**
   ```sh
   brew install gcc
   ```

2. **Create a symbolic link to the new GCC version:**
   ```sh
   ln -s /usr/local/bin/gcc /usr/local/bin/gcc-4.9
   ```

3. **Ensure that `/usr/local/bin` is listed before `/usr/bin` in your `PATH`:**
   You can check this by running:
   ```sh
   echo $PATH
   ```
   If necessary, update your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file to include:
   ```sh
   export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
   ```

4. **Verify that the correct GCC version is being used:**
   ```sh
   ls -l `which gcc`
   ```

Once these steps were completed, the required libraries were found, and I was able to successfully install Python 2.6 using `pyenv`.

Best regards,
