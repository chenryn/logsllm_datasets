Brief history.... 
Yes, we know who we're talking to......
“Hand scanning”
•Very slow.... 
•Pick up the phone dial and listen.
•Can be accurate,  but that largely depends on the 
“hand scanners” knowledge base.
•Still a popular pass time for phreaks. 
•(See http://www.handscan.net)
Automated Wardialing (Old School)
•1980's .....
Made you this guy....
Historical Problems with Automatic Wardialing
•Typically relied on standard PSTN/POTS connections.  
Telcos monitor for over utilization of their service and 
“flag” the line for further investigation.
•In some cases they'd shut down your POTS line leaving 
you to explain what you where doing. 
•Modems are lame.  Scan for carriers (data) or tones/fax. 
 Multiple scans.  You are limited by your hardware. 
•Later generation CTI hardware? Cost prohibited then, 
now obsolete (ISA boards!) and need PRI. 
•Sure – things like randomly dialing/random timing help,  
but still you end up missing a lot.   
Still the 80' but enter the AppleCat
Could generate and detect tones.  Good for boxing and 
for this talk War dialing. 
Software like Cat's Meow/Phantom Access.
Expensive and proprietary API (Later Firmware 
emulated Hayes command set.
We'll talk about his later...
2002'ish.  We can do it better. Sorta....
Enter VoIP: Less problems/different 
headaches. (The good) 
•The world is your oyster. Cheap calls even if they 
supervise. If they don't, free or next to nothing. 
•No longer bound to physical POTS lines. 
•Less monitoring (in most cases). 
•More calls and more “lines”. 
•Still interesting things out there! (Routers, X.25 
networks (you read that right), SCADA systems, Old 
school BBS's). Yup.
Enter VoIP: Less problems/different 
headaches. (The bad)
•Still bound to a crappy modem. 
•Don't care how good it is......Do you really want to 
sit and listen to a modem? 
•Not everything interesting has a carrier or tone.
•What software will you use? 
•Sure, THC-SCAN and TONELOC rock... but what if 
you want to store to a database? Or lookup data on 
the tubes?
… and now a side note ...
•2004'ish I was doing a pentest which I 
needed some war dialing foo. 
•Most *nix based “War dialers” blow. 
•Didn't want to load a DOS emulator to run 
TONELOC. 
•I'm certainly not going to “buy” commerical 
software.
•Besides, it's a war dialer. It'll only take me a 
week or so to complete.. Right?
iWar (Intelligent Wardialer - 2005)
•*nix based (OpenBSD/Linux/etc...)
•Written in C/ncurses frontend
•Tone location (like Toneloc)
•No limitation on the number of devices.
•MySQL/PostgreSQL/ASCII output support
•All your standard 80's bells/whistles.
•FTW! Errrr.. not quite... 
ATA+Modem = Your technique is weaksauce.  
This is the way we roll...errr.. rolled...
•An Old School wardialer with some chest hair!
T1/DS1 + Asterisk + VoIP ==
48+ line modem bank in your face.
•Standard Asterisk –> Internet setup. 
T100P/Asterisk supplies the “telco” to the 
AS5200 (24 channels). 
•*2 T100P == 48 channels.
•T100P connects via T1 loopback cable to 
AS5200.  AS5200 is “fooled” into have PRI.
•iWar connects to AS5200 via TCP/IP. 
Modems are on different ports. 
T1/DS1 + Asterisk + VoIP ==
48 line modem bank in your face (The good)
•48+ modems in one box. Shotgun methodology!
•No crazy cabling!
•iWar get TCP/IP functionality!  
•The fact that we're using a AS5200 isn't important.  
•When ISP's fail your modem capacity goes up ($20.00 
bucks for a AS5200).
•iWar uses local & remote modems all the same! Doesn't 
matter if the modem bank is local or across the Internet 
in Russia!
T1/DS1 + Asterisk + VoIP ==
48 line modem bank in your face (The bad)
•Limited by bandwidth for VoIP 
•– but you always will be.
•
•
•YOU'RE STILL USING F*CKING MODEMS! 
•JUST MORE OF THEM!
But maybe there's a smarter way.
(what the Applecat did right)
•It allowed you to scan for modems and tones 
at the same time. 
•It had rudimentary voice detection and could 
detect clicks, beeps and buzzes. 
•One NPA scan and you were fairly done 
•(no rinse and repeat). 
VoIP + DSP == PIMP
•VoIP + DSP isn't a new idea. We've seen lots 
of semi-working and poor implementation. 
•For example, trying to tie VoIP raw audio 
with software based modem. Cool idea, more 
than modems out there. 
•iWar has had IAX2 support, but it's been 
weak (no real DSP).
•Then we ran into HD Moore (of Metasploit 
fame) and his Warvox project......
VoIP + DSP == PIMP
•Warvox uses a dialer (IAX2 protocol) to 
dial/record calls. 
•A Ruby backend does the analysis (to look 
for tones/fax/modem/etc). 
•Works as part of the Metasploit frame work.
•Working with HD Moore, iWar does the same 
thing – Just in C, and without the really nice 
GUI frontend/graphics. (iWar is curses, 
remember?)
Warvox Screen Shot (job)
Warvox Screen Shot (analysis)
VoIP + DSP == PIMP
•With iWar we decided to use a “signature” based 
system. 
•Basically a configuration file to tell iWar “what to 
listen for”. 
•Uses KissFFT (Fast Fourier Transform) – like 
Warvox, for back end signal processing.
•Since both write to “raw” files, it's easy to move 
iWar generated audio files to Warvox for reporting. 
iWar Screen shot
iWar/Warvox.
•You no longer need hardware! 
•All VoIP/DSP work is now done in software!
•Detect modems, fax, clicks, tones... 
whatever......
iWar: Where do we go now?
•Limited to IAX2.  
•Adding SIP support for both iWar and Warvox.   
Shouldnt be that bad. (PJSIP).  Just need to 
dedicate the time.
•Backspoofing?  iWar can do CNAM lookups via the 
Internet,  which varies in accuracy.  True 
backspoofing for real CNAM lookups.
•Speech to Text technology.  Lumenvox,  for 
example (“Hello?”... “Domino's Pizza”).  HD has 
played with this.... easy enough...
•Software based “modem”..  to connect and banner 
analysis....
Improving Your Hit Ratio
•Backspoofing/CNAM dips/NANPA lookups:
•Know before you dial.
•Business/Residential/Government.
•Able to identify Telco owned lines and 
Cellular carriers.
Improving Your Hit Ratio
•Better Tools = Better Results:
•VoIP carriers allow multiple outbound trunks.
•iWar/Warvox – One Scan == Multiple Results
•Speech to Text processing way better now…
•Database Backend = Ablility to “Data mine”
Improving Your Hit Ratio
•Better Hardware:
•Just carriers?  Setup a modem bank!
•Asterisk + chan_mobile: Use those free 
nights and weekends! (Bluetooth  DAHDI)
•Any FPGA/Embedded Hackers out there?  
Massive DSP processing power now…
Highway to hell passes through Capital Hill.
•Legislation against “CID spoofing” ongoing in 
various states and federal levels 
(iWar/Warvox supported). 
•Single party consent and recording. 
iWar/Warvox “record” the call then analyze 
the audio. Violation? 
•“Do Not Call” list / VSP’s terminating service 
– Go International!  (Globalization)

w/o authentication)
HTTP based logging (log 
numbers over the tubes)

Save state/load state
Random/Seq. Dialing.
Random Timing between 
dials
