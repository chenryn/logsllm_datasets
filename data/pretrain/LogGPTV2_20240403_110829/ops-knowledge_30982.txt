User: I'm on windows, but I'm using a putty shell to connect to a linux machine, and want to install python 2.7. Can't figure out how to do it. How can I download python from command line?
Assistant: Well if you are getting into a linux machine you can use the package manager of that linux distro.
If you are using Ubuntu just use apt-get search python, check the list and do apt-get install python2.7 (not sure if python2.7 or python-2.7, check the list)
You could use yum in fedora and do the same.
if you want to install it on your windows machine i dont know any package manager, i would download the wget for windows, donwload the package from python.org and install it
