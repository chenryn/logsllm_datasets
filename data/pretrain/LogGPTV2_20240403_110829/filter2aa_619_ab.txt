## Table 10-4: Types of Actions in syslog.conf

| /some/pipe | Log to specified pipe |
| /dev/some/tty_or_console | Log to specified console |
| @remote.hostname.or.IP | Log to specified remote host |
| username1, username2, etc. | Log to these users’ screens |
| * | Log to all users’ screens |

## Running syslogd

The default `syslog.conf` may or may not meet your needs, and the default startup mode of `syslogd` might also require adjustments. The following table and subsequent paragraphs discuss some `syslogd` startup flags that are particularly relevant to security. For a complete list, refer to the `sysklogd(8)` manpage.

When changing and testing `syslog`'s configuration and startup options, it is usually best to start and stop `syslogd` and `klogd` together. I recommend using your system's `syslog/klogd` startup script for this purpose.

On most Linux systems, both facilities are controlled by the same startup script, typically named `/etc/init.d/syslog` or `/etc/init.d/sysklog` ("sysklog" is shorthand for "syslog and klogd"). See the table below for a list of some `syslogd` flags.

### Table 10-5: Some Useful `syslogd` Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| -m minutes_btwn_marks | Minutes between "mark" messages (timestamp-only messages). A value of 0 signifies "no marks". |
| -a /additional/socket | Used to specify additional sockets, besides `/dev/log`, on which `syslogd` should listen for messages. |
| -f /path/to/syslog.conf | Used to provide the path/name of `syslog.conf`, if different from `/etc/syslog.conf`. |
| -r | Listens for syslog messages from remote hosts. |

### Example Configurations

#### Example 10-6: `syslog.conf` Selector for Mark Messages
```plaintext
mark.* -/var/log/messages
```

#### Example 10-7: Invoking `syslogd` with 30-Minute Marks
```sh
mylinuxbox:/etc/init.d# ./syslogd -m 30
```

#### Example 10-8: `init.d/syslog` Line Invoking `syslogd` to Read Messages from a Chroot Jail
```sh
daemon syslogd -m 0 -a /var/named/dev/log
```

#### Example 10-9: Invoking `syslogd` with Multiple "Additional Log Device" Directives
```sh
syslogd -a /var/named/dev/log -a /var/otherchroot/dev/log -a /additional/dev/log
```

#### Example 10-10: Specifying the Path to `syslogd`'s Configuration File
```sh
mylinuxbox:/etc/init.d# ./syslogd -f ./syslog.conf.test
```

### Security Considerations

While centralizing logs can enhance security, it also introduces risks. If log messages traverse untrusted networks, the inner workings of the servers sending those messages may be exposed. In such cases, consider using `Syslog-ng`, which supports TCP and can be used with tools like `stunnel` and `ssh` to enhance security.

If you decide to use `syslog` with the `-r` flag, consider using `TCPwrappers` to control which hosts can connect to your log server. This provides a simple means of defining allowed hosts and protocols, though it can be tricked by source-IP-spoofing.

### Syslog-ng

`Syslog-ng` is a more modern and flexible alternative to `syslog`. It offers better message filtering, forwarding, and eventually, message integrity and encryption. `Syslog-ng` supports remote logging over both TCP and UDP and is maintained by Balazs Scheidler.

#### Compiling and Installing `Syslog-ng` from Source Code

1. **Obtain the Latest `Syslog-ng` Source Code:**
   - Stable branch: Version 1.4
   - Experimental branch: Version 1.5 (includes field expansion feature)

2. **Download `Syslog-ng` and `libol`:**
   - From Bazsi Scheidler’s website: http://www.balabit.hu
   - From Freshmeat project site: http://freshmeat.net/projects/syslog-ng/

3. **Compile and Install:**
   ```sh
   cd packagename
   ./configure
   make
   make install
   ```

   To install in a custom directory:
   ```sh
   ./configure --prefix=/your/dir/here
   ```

4. **Set Up `Syslog-ng` Environment:**
   - Create the directory `/etc/syslog-ng`.
   - Copy example `syslog-ng.conf` files from the source distribution.
   - Create a startup script in `/etc/init.d` and symbolic links in appropriate runlevel directories.

#### Running `Syslog-ng`

Before starting `Syslog-ng`, ensure you have a configuration file. The supported `syslog-ng` daemon flags are:

- `-d`: Print debugging messages.
- `-v`: Print even more debugging messages.
- `-f filename`: Use `filename` as the configuration file (default: `/etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf`).
- `-V`: Print version number.
- `-p pidfilename`: Name process-ID-file `pidfilename` (default: `/var/run/syslog-ng.pid`).

This completes the setup and configuration for `Syslog-ng`.
