called Stingray, is an active radio attack device in 3GPP networks
that impersonate a base station to force disclosure of the sub-
scriber’s IMSI [20, 23, 29, 30, 33]. The device can collect user data
from all phones within coverage and listen to the calls. Stingray
has been used primarily by government monitoring agencies for
law enforcement purposes to track and locate suspects [12]. If an
attacker can get the IMSI of a user, the attacker can also find the
actual phone number through paid web services [14].
In addition, an attacker can intercept, manipulate, and analyze
the messages containing private user data transferred during the
handshake (authentication) phase of Wi-Fi Calling. As shown in
(3) and (4) of Figure 2(b), the cryptographic certificates are not an
essential requirement but it can be optionally used for protecting
the IMSI. This weak specification makes a server impersonation
attack, which reveals the IMSI, possible, even when the IMSI it is
encrypted. An attacker can set up his own IPSec server to imper-
sonate the ePDG server, which would be capable of participating
in the IMSI authentication process. Consequently, the attacker can
acquire users’ IMSI information.

Furthermore, IMSI leakages by a server impersonation attack can
cause more serious privacy problems. For instance, if an attacker
could acquire other additional information, such as the UE’s hard-
ware MAC address, he can track the victim more efficiently even
without the IMSI. In this way, attackers are able to track people and
record their movements, hence violating users’ privacy.
3.2 Availability of Services
In Wi-Fi networks, first, an attacker can attempt to bypass the access
control and authentication mechanisms to obtain the service for
free. In other words, an attacker can impersonate a legitimate user
to have free access to Wi-Fi services and the victim gets charged
instead. Second, an attacker can transmit malicious messages to
interfere with the Wi-Fi services because anyone can access the
Wi-Fi link layer without any permission. Lastly, if correct mutual
authentication is not deployed between two communicating par-
ties, the attacker can perform eavesdropping or man-in-the-middle
attacks by setting up a rogue access point, which relays messages
between them.
3.3 Attacks Originating From Victim’s UE and
Attacker’s AP
Malware residing in the UE can steal the credentials stored on SIM
card of victim’s UE. A UE infected by malware can also be used to
perform Distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks simultaneously against a
target. Also, it is possible to interfere with the victim’s UE to make
it connect to different APs.
An attacker can leverage a rogue AP masqueraded as a legitimate
AP or UE using IP/MAC address spoofing. Once a victim’s UE
connects to the rogue AP (due to various reasons including weak
LTE signal, Wi-Fi auto-connection option turned on, or deliberate
connection by the victim), an attacker can easily eavesdrop on
the traffic between a user and an AP. The attacker can also act
as a Man-in-the-Middle during the authentication procedure and
impersonate servers in the network such as a DNS or a DHCP
server.
Moreover, the attacker can also perform DoS attacks against
UEs and legitimate APs easily sending attack packets to them. The
messages an attacker can forge or manipulate the following packets
to cause DoS as listed below:
(1) DNS response packet: When the target UE attempts to con-
nect to an ePDG, it first looks for an ePDG by broadcasting
DNS query. The attacker can compromise availability of LTE
service on the target UE by forging DNS response packets
containing IP address of the ePDG. In this way, the target
UE cannot connect to LTE and is forced to connect to Wi-Fi
AP. From this point, the attacker can perform server imper-
sonation attack by introducing a rogue AP.
(2) IKE_SA_INIT message: Since the attacker can eavesdrop
the IKE_SA_INIT packets during the SA negotiation, the
attacker can easily impersonate a legitimate user or ePDG.
Thus, attacker’s capability to sniff those IKE_SA_INIT mes-
sages provides a base for server impersonation attack to the
adversary.
(3) Deauthentication frame: In LTE network, a session can be
closed upon receiving deauthentication frame from either
serving gateway or UE. The attacker uses forged deauthenti-
cation frame to disconnect the target UE from the current
network. This attack is called detach attack in LTE [15]. Sim-
ilarly, deauthentication frame can be used to drop on-going
Wi-Fi call of the victim by simply sending it to either the
target UE or the AP to which the victim is connected to. In
addition, the attacker can send the deauthentication frame
to detach the victim from a legitimate AP and force him to
connect to a rogue AP.
Please refer to Section 5 for details on how those messages are
used in actual attacks.
4 IMSI PRIVACY ATTACK
In this section, we present how the UE’s IMSI can be revealed by
using server (ePDG) impersonation attack. To this end, we first
describe the attack scenario and discuss its impacts. As shown in
Figure 3, we design the attack using a rogue AP and a fake IPSec
server.
4.1 Attack Scenario
The IMSI privacy attack scenario starts with sniffing Wi-Fi channel
and monitoring the ongoing Wi-Fi Calling communication caused
by target UEs. The procedural steps to execute the privacy attacks
using the server impersonation technique are described as follows
and in Figure 4:
(1) The attacker places the rogue AP equipped with the fake
IPSec server within Wi-Fi coverage of the victim UE. After
the victim connects to the rogue AP through messages 1○ and

2○, the attacker can capture and manipulate all the packets
of the victim’s UE.
(2) The attacker takes advantage of the UE’s ePDG lookup re-
sponse packet 3○ to obtain the IP address and port number
of the ePDG. The attacker can then deceive the UE as if the
rogue AP were an ePDG server.
(3) When the attacker captures the IKE_SA_INIT_REQ packet
5○ transmitted by the UE, the attacker relays it to the fake
IPSec server. The fake IPSec server generates the Session
Keys (SK_e: encryption, SK_a: authentication) with the UE’s
D-H and N, then responds to the UE with its own D-H and
N 6○.
(4) The UE generates the session key with D-H and N in the
response packets, and then sends the IKE_AUTH_REQ packet
7○ to the rogue AP by encrypting the payload including the
IMSI with the ready-made session key.
(5) The attacker intercepts this encrypted packet, decrypts it
with the session keys generated in the previous step, and
obtains the IMSI and APN.
With this procedure, the encrypted IKE_AUTH_REQ packet can be
decrypted with the session keys generated by the fake IPSec server.
The session keys used to decrypt the packet are extracted during
the security association process in the fake IPSec server. With
these keys and cryptography information negotiated in security
association, we leverage IKEv2 decryption table to obtain decrypted
payloads, which have IMSI, APN, etc.
4.2 Attack Setup
To execute the attack, the adversary must lie in the coverage of
the target network. To sniff the wireless channel of a target UE,
we created a softAP on a Linux laptop (Intel i5 processor and Kali
2017-12-04) and configure the Wi-Fi interface card to use monitor
mode (or promiscuous mode). We also utilized the libpcap-based
live packet capturing of Wireshark 3 and the sniff APIs of Scapy
module [28]. Scapy is a packet manipulation tool for computer
networks, written in Python. It can forge or decode packets, send
them on the wire, capture them, and match requests and replies.
We implement a rogue AP equipped with IPSec server to per-
form the attacks against UE’s registered with a live LTE network.
In particular, we integrated the IPSec server to the rogue AP to
impersonate the ePDG’s behavior. The process of building a rogue
AP is described below.
Building rogue AP. To successfully deploy a rogue AP, we
utilize a laptop running Kali Linux with a Wi-Fi interface which
is capable of working in a monitor mode. The five components
that comprise the rogue AP are shown in Figure 5 along with their
respective capabilities.
(1) SoftAP: Access Point module using hostapd, dnsmasq, and
iptables which enables the laptop to function as an AP.
(2) Sniffer: Capturing module using Scapy APIs to capture the
packets.
(3) Extractor: Extracting module using Scapy APIs to extract the
payload value for crafting fake packets.
(4) Crafter: Crafting module using Scapy APIs to masquerade it
as a legitimate packet in the network.
(5) Fake IPSec server: Impersonated ePDG server module using
Strong Swan to handshake with a UE instead of the real ePDG
server.
Implementation. Among the five components, Sniffer, Extrac-
tor and Crafter functionalities are implemented with Scapy module
functions. Algorithm 1 describes pseudo code used for manipulating
packets with Scapy, and the components numbers in the comments
and interface names such as "wlan, eth0, vmnet8" are referenced
in Figure 5. The command sniff() captures packets at designated

concatenating packets between each layer.
4.3 Results of Attacks
To identify devices and MNOs vulnerable to this attack, we test
4 major MNOs in the U.S. (T-Mobile, Sprint, AT&T, Verizon) and
their particular 10 devices (Samsung Galaxy-Note-4/5, Samsung
Galaxy-5/6 and iPhone 6/6s/7/8+). Through the experiments, we
confirmed that these devices are affected by our attacks to obtain
the subscriber’s IMSI and Access Point Name (APN) as shown in
Figure 6. In summary, as shown in Table 2, a successful attack would
expose additional privacy information such as an ePDG IP address,
Security association (SA) messages, etc.
In particular, we found that the certificates (CERT) are not used in
all MNO’s devices to protect the IMSI exchange. Certificate payloads
should be included in an exchange if certificates are available to
the sender. To verify, we crafted and sent the certificate request
packet to the UEs. However, all UEs respond to the request without
certificates. According to the standards, deploying certificates in
the IKE exchange is not an essential requirement but an optional
requirement [18]. Because of this weak specification, an attacker
can set up the rogue AP and send the forged packets to the victim
UE without the ePDG server authentication in the UE. In addition,
the attacker could decrypt the encrypted packet with self-generated
session keys.
