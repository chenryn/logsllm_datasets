User: I could not find any pointers on how to create a menubar icon on OSX using wx. I originally thought that the wxTaskBarIcon class would do, but it actually creates an icon on the Dock. On Windows, wxTaskBarIcon creates a Systray icon and associated menu, and I would think that on mac osx it would create a menubar icon, I guess not.
Assistant: As of wxPython 2.9.2.0 wx.TaskBarIcon will create a menubar icon now instead on OSX, so long as you call SetIcon.
