# Environment
    Windows build number: [Version 10.0.18362.267] Windows 10 Professional Version 1903
    Windows Terminal version (if applicable): whatever is out-of-the-box
    Any other software?
  * Ubuntu 18.04.LTS from the Microsoft Store fully updated with  
`sudo apt update ; sudo apt upgrade`
  * The joe editor installed in Ubuntu with  
`sudo apt install joe`
# Steps to reproduce
  1. Start the joe editor with a new file without specifying a filename
  2. Type 3 lines at least to see what happens, e.g.:
    line1
    line2
    line3
  3. Go back with the cursor to the beginning of line2.
  4. Press the ENTER key.
# Expected behavior
A new line should be inserted in the place of the cursor and the part of the
file starting with the cursor position was in should be scrolled down on the
screen and the last shown line should scroll out (disappear) and the cursor
should move one line down.
I.e. you should see
    line1
    line2
    line3
and the new cursor position should be at the beginning of line2
**Note that after saving the file, the expected behavior is what correctly
happens in the file data, only the display behavior is incorrect.**
**Note, that this worked correctly in Windows 1803 with the same Ubuntu 18.04
LTS and joe versions. The upgrade to Windows 1903 broke this, and reinstalling
joe and reinstalling the entire Ubuntu 18.04 LTS distribution did not fix this
either.**
# Actual behavior
No scrolling of the part after the cursor happens, instead the line the cursor
was in is cleared (becomes empty, not disappear), and the cursor (correctly)
moves down to the beginning of the next line.
I.e. you see
    line1
    line3
and the cursor position is at the beginning of line3.
**Note that after saving the file, the expected behavior is what correctly
happens to the file data, only the display behavior is incorrect.**
