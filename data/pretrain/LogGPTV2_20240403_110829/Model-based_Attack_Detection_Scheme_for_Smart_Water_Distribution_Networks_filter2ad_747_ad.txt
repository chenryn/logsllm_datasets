### Figure 9: Degradation of \(\hat{y}(k)\) Due to a Zero-Alarm Attack in Scenario 2

**Figure 6 and Figure 7** illustrate the degradation of the state estimate under zero-alarm attacks for both the CUSUM procedure and the bad-data detection method. In these figures, it is observed that the residual under the zero-alarm attack converges to \(b_i\) after the attack starts. For both procedures, the state estimate remains bounded, indicating that it converges to a steady state. This behavior is expected in Scenario 1, where \(\rho(A) < 1\), which implies that \(\|E[e_k]\|\) diverges. Similar results are obtained for the CUSUM (see **Figure 11**).

**Figure 9** compares the output estimate degradation between the bad-data and CUSUM procedures under zero-alarm attacks. Although both estimates diverge, the CUSUM method exhibits a slower divergence rate compared to the bad-data procedure.

### Alarm Rates for Scenarios 1 and 2

**Tables 1 and 2** present the alarm rates for Scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. Each column in the tables shows the rate of alarms produced by sensor measurements for both detectors. Outputs 1-4 represent the pressure sensors at the four consumer nodes (Nodes 4-7), while Output 5 is the level sensor in the storage tank. Each row label in **Table 1** presents a key1:key2 pair, where key1 is the detection method and key2 is the attack scenario. For example, "bad-data:bias attack" represents the results for the bad-data detector under a bias attack.

#### Scenario 1 (Table 1)
In Scenario 1, the attack involves the addition of a bias value to the output measurement from the level sensor, starting at time slot \(k = 150\). In the no-attack scenario, the performance of the bad-data and CUSUM detectors is as expected, with an alarm rate equal to the false alarm rate of 1%. Under a bias attack, the alarm rate increases to 79%, indicating that such attacks are easily detected based on the detector alarms. The first 20% of the measurements correspond to normal operation, allowing for visualization of the attack's effects. The rest of the attacked readings result in alarms, confirming that the bias attack is easily detected by these schemes. For zero-alarm attacks, the alarm rate is very small, as these attacks are designed not to raise alarms. If the attack starts from the beginning of the measurements, the alarm rate is 0%.

#### Scenario 2 (Table 2)
In Scenario 2, the system is under attack, and the alarm rate is higher than in normal operation. The attack targets the control inputs, and the exact start and end times are unknown. Thresholds are set for a 1% false alarm rate, but for attacks on inputs, the alarm rate reaches 20%, significantly higher than the normal false alarm rate. This indicates that the system is under attack. The results also suggest that input attacks can be detected using output measurements of the system. Zero-alarm attacks, designed for sensor attacks, do not apply to actuator attacks, so it is not surprising that we can detect when attacks are initiated on the inputs.

### Conclusion

In this manuscript, we have detailed the construction of model-based attack detectors for identifying compromised sensors and actuators in a water distribution network. Specifically, a Kalman filter is proposed to estimate the state of the physical process, and these estimates are used to construct residual variables that drive the CUSUM procedure. For a class of zero-alarm attacks, we have characterized the performance of the proposed detection procedures in terms of the effect that the attack sequence can induce on the system dynamics, particularly in the output estimate. We have compared the performance of the CUSUM and Bad-Data methods, showing that bias attacks (and likely any output-injection attack) are easily detected using fault-detection techniques, provided the statistics of the residuals in the attack-free case are well characterized. Additionally, input-injection attacks are also easily detected using the proposed methods. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods against different classes of attacks.

### Appendix A: State Space Matrices for Scenarios 1 and 2

The state space matrices \((A, B, C)\) are obtained using subspace system identification. For Scenario 2, more than 70% accuracy is achieved with a 10th-order model, and for Scenario 1, a 20th-order model is used. Therefore, the system matrix \(A_2\) is a \(10 \times 10\) matrix, and \(A_1\) is a \(20 \times 20\) matrix. For 6 inputs (4 user demands, flow at the pumping station, ON/OFF status of the pumping station), the dimensions for \(B_2\) are \(10 \times 6\) and for \(B_1\) are \(20 \times 6\). For 5 outputs, the dimensions for \(C_2\) are \(5 \times 10\) and for \(C_1\) are \(5 \times 20\). Using these state space matrices and the system model, one can determine the dynamics of the system evolution.
