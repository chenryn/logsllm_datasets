After upgrading to React 15.0.1 or 15.1.0, I encountered an issue with using `printWasted` from the Perf tools.

In React 15.0.1, the following error is thrown:
```
ReactDefaultPerfAnalysis.js:177 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'forEach' of undefined
```

In React 15.1.0, the error message is:
```
warning.js:44 Warning: There is an internal error in the React performance measurement code. We did not expect componentDidMount timer to stop while no timer is still in progress for another instance. Please report this as a bug in React.
```

I have identified that the issue is related to components that return `null` in their `render` method. Many of my components have a structure similar to the following:

```javascript
render: function() {
  if (!this.props.visible) {
    return null;
  }
  // ...
}
```

When I attempt to measure the performance of one of these components, the aforementioned errors occur. Removing the conditional logic that returns `null` resolves the problem.
