After upgrading to React 15.0.1 or 15.1.0 I'm not able to use printWasted from
Perf tools.
React 15.0.1 throws error:  
`ReactDefaultPerfAnalysis.js:177 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property
'forEach' of undefined(â€¦)`
React 15.1.0  
`warning.js:44 Warning: There is an internal error in the React performance
measurement code. We did not expect componentDidMount timer to stop while no
timer is still in progress for another instance. Please report this as a bug
in React`
I discovered that error is connected with returning `null`. A lot of my
components have something like that
    render: function() {
      if (!this.props.visible) {
        return null;
      }
      // ...
    }
And when I try to measure one of those components I will get above error.
Removing conditions from components fixes problem.
