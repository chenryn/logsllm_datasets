A.3 Ethical Considerations
The Internet-wide scans were performed through a set of dedicated IP address provided in the University network. The motivation to perform
our own scans with ZMap is because some networks blocklist Shodan, Censys and other scanning services. However, we wanted to include
datasets from scanning-services to cover the networks that may have blocked our scanning IP. Furthermore, because of the CoAP and the
UPnP protocols in our scanning portfolio, we ran custom scripts to fetch specific response from the hosts that helps us in identification of
misconfigured devices. Moreover a recent study shows the impact of location on Internet-wide scans, which presents certain limitations of
scanning services [97]. We were motivated by this study to perform our own scans.
Information regarding the misconfigured devices, like the source IP addresses are not shared or disclosed. The data will be stored for
a period of three months from the date of collection, followed by anonymization of IP addresses to follow the local privacy regulations.
Furthermore, a webpage stating the purpose of the scan and research was setup to ensure transparency and indicate intent of the scanning
process. The scans included a default blocklist from the ZMap repository [100] and the European blocklisted provided by the FireHOL project
[25].
The samples identified by Virustotal as malware will be shared on online threat repositories like Malpedia [37] and Malware Bazaar [2] to
facilitate research from the open source community. Lastly, the destination IP addresses in the UCSD CAIDA network telescope have not
been disclosed or shared and are anonymized in our database to facilitate the purposes of the telescope.
A.3.1 Honeypot sandboxing. We want to emphasize that our setting focused only on collecting attacks from the Internet and in principle
did not allow for honeypots to attack back a system or entity. Furthermore, we use state of the art honeypots (HosTaGe, Conpot, Cowrie,
Dionaea, ThingPot and U-Pot) for which, to the best of our knowledge, there is no scientific publication suggesting the possibility of an
adversary being able to hack their way out of them and attack systems on the Internet through them. Moreover, we want to highlight that
we are only utilizing low/medium interaction honeypots. In contrast to high interaction honeypots, which are real systems and thus may be
compromised, low/medium interaction honeypots only partially emulate protocols. Adding to this, each honeypot (except HosTaGe that
runs on a mobile device) was deployed as a container for better managing and as an additional security layer. HosTaGe is safeguarded by
the device’s firmware (Samsung’s Linux Container (LXC) sandboxing). Furthermore, HosTaGe’s implementation of the various protocols
does not allow the attacker for a lot of interaction (the reason for this, as with most low interaction honeypots, is the utilization of protocol
emulation libraries that are incomplete it terms of capabilities). In regards to measures against reflection attacks (i.e., on CoAP and UPnP)
we would like to note the following. The CoAP implementation of HosTaGe is implemented using the JAVA mbed-coap library and only
responds to service discovery requests with static information. Hence, it does not allow for an attacker to attack other devices. Similarly, for
U-Pot we utilized a low interaction image of the IoT device that responds to only service discovery requests (by using a limited UPnP library,
i.e., GUPNP).
In addition, for all the honeypots, we performed continuous monitoring on a daily basis. That is, we examined what kind of attacks and
communication was taking place and whether anything looked overly suspicious. Moreover, note that all containers had egress rules to limit
any traffic attempting to leave the network. As we write on the paper, the majority of the observed attacks come as the result of automated
attacks (e.g. via malware). Lastly, the IP space used for the honeypots is part of our monitored university network; we can confirm that we
have not received any complaints with regard to the IP addresses of the honeypots neither from our NOC nor our ISP.
