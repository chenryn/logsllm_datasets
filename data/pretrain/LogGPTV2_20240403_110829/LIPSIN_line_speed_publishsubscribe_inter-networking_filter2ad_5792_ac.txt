completely accurate, they are a common (best) practice to
experiment with new forwarding schemes in real world sce-
narios2. A second useful data set is SNDlib [28], from where
we selected the largest network (TA2 ). The most important
properties of these networks are shown in Table 1.
Using ns-3, we implemented a zFilter-based forwarding
layer and a simple topology module, which computes zFil-
ters based on publisher and subscriber locations and the
actual network map; the selected tree is always deﬁned by
the shortest paths between the publisher and each of the
subscribers. We set m, the size of the BF to 248 bits; a
fair comparison to the IPv6 source and destination ﬁelds
(2 · 128). We brieﬂy considered m = 120 and m = 504, but
abandoned the former due to poor performance and the lat-
ter due to relatively small overall gains compared to the per-
packet cost. A more ﬂexible design, allowing m to vary per
packet, is left for further study. We investigated the eﬀect
of diﬀerent numbers of forwarding tables (d), the number
of subscribers (n), and the diﬀerent LIT-sets for the nodes
(constant k = 5, variable k ∈ [3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6] ), as well as
diﬀerent BF-selection strategies.
Stateless forwarding: We present the essence of our
simulation results on Tables 2 and 3. Table 2 contains results
using the fpa selection criteria with the variable distribution
2Recent studies [35] have pointed out some limitations in
Rocketfuel data, suggesting that the number of actual phys-
ical routing elements may be less than inferred by their mea-
surement technique. However, this particular inaccuracy in
the present data places more stress on our mechanism than
the suggested corrected scheme would place.
