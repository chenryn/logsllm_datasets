### Explanation:
- **APT29**: A well-known advanced persistent threat (APT) group.
- **ISO and VHDX Files**: These are disk image formats that can be used to store and distribute data or entire operating systems.
- **Mark-of-the-Web (MotW)**: A security feature in Windows that marks files downloaded from the internet as potentially unsafe, triggering additional security checks when these files are accessed.
- **Evading MotW**: By embedding these files within HTML, APT29 aims to bypass the MotW, allowing the files to execute without triggering the usual security warnings.

This technique demonstrates the sophistication of APT29 in circumventing common security measures to deliver malicious payloads.
