One case is line card boot up mode for different PIC\n                              type  does not match to pre-configured PIC type.  There two modes of the line card : ICMTS&RPHY and Kobal-R can work with\n                              DPIC-G1 or DPIC-G2 with different FW.  Eg. if the card is pre-configured as RPHY with the command  'card /0 cBR-CCAP-LC-40G\n                              r-phy'  but a rf-pic card was inserted to the same slot. Or the card is pre-configured as ICMTS with the command  'card /0\n                              cBR-CCAP-LC-40G'  but a dpic card was inserted to the same slot. Or DPIC type is pre-configured as DPIC-G2 with the command\n                              'card /0 CBR-CCAP-LC-G2-R r-phy DPIC-G2-'  but a DPIC-G1 card was inserted to the same slot. Or DPIC type\n                              is pre-configured as DPIC-G1 with the command  'card /0 CBR-CCAP-LC-G2-R r-phy'  but a DPIC-G2 card was inserted\n                              to the same slot. Another case is Kobal-R working ifmod mismatch to precfg.  Eg. if system reload with card pre-configured\n                              as DPIC-G2-10GE  'card /0 CBR-CCAP-LC-G2-R r-phy DPIC-G2-10GE'  while .board.conf was saved as DPIC-G2 100GE mode\n                              and Kobal boot up before card precfg parsing  then this error message will be reported however  it can be recovered by CLC\n                              auto reloading."
