User: Can one write a hybrid Go-Python/Java application and run it on Google App Engine as one application, or do they need to be split into two apps and communicate with each other through HTTP calls? Is there any tutorial or example on something like this being done?
Assistant: You can deploy several "versions" of the same application at once. Each version will be accessible using a fully qualified URL, and they can all be in different languages.
