User: How to use Ansible for automated setup and configuration management to deploy a web application on multiple servers?
Assistant: 1. Install Ansible: First, you need to install Ansible on the control node. If you use Ubuntu or Debian system, you can use the following command to install: ``` sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install ansible ``` If you use Red Hat or CentOS system, you can use the following command to install: ``` sudo yum install ansible ``` 2. Configure Ansible: After the installation is successful, we need to configure Ansible on the control node. This includes defining host inventory files and setting up SSH key authentication. The host inventory file is usually located at /etc/ansible/hosts and lists all the hosts that need to be managed. Host inventory files can be set up in the following format: ``` [web] webserver1.example.com webserver2.example.com [database] dbserver.example.com ``` Before setting up SSH key authentication, make sure that the SSH connections have been established between all managed hosts, and password or SSH key authentication is possible. SSH key authentication can be setup using the following command: ``` ssh-copy-id username@host ``` 3. Create Ansible Playbook: Once Ansible has been configured, we can create an Ansible Playbook to install and configure the web application . Playbook is a YAML file that defines a series of tasks and hosts. As follows: ``` - name: Install and Configure Web Application hosts: web become: yes tasks: - name: Install Apache apt: name=apache2 state=present - name: Configure Virtual Host template: src: /path/to /virtualhost.conf.j2 dest: /etc/apache2/sites-available/myapp.conf notify: - restart apache ``` In the above Playbook, we first define a Playbook with a task named "Install and Configure Web Application" . Then specify the host in the web group to execute the Playbook. Since we need to install packages and write system files on the host machine, we need to use sudo privileges, so we set the become property to yes. In the task list, we define two tasks. The first task is to install the Apache package. Packages can be installed using the apt module. The second task is to write the Apache virtual host configuration file. Template files can be written using the template module. When the file is written, we also need to notify the apache service to restart. 4. Run Ansible Playbook: To run Ansible Playbook, you can use the ansible-playbook command. Open a terminal on the control node, change to the directory containing the Playbook file and execute the following command: ``` ansible-playbook webapp.yml ``` In the above command, "webapp.yml" is the name of the Playbook file we created earlier. Ansible will execute the playbook on all hosts listed in the host inventory we defined earlier. As Ansible executes, it will display the status of each task, and whether the task succeeded or failed. If desired, specific hosts on which to run the Playbook can be specified using the --limit option. For example: ``` ansible-playbook webapp.yml --limit webserver1.example.com ``` This command will only run the Playbook on the host named webserver1.example.com.
