An indexing task might fail due to various reasons, and one of them is node
failures. If an indexing task fails due to node failures, it might be
completed by reissuing the failed task on another node. In this case, it would
be better if the overlord can resubmit failed tasks automatically without
manual handling.
I'm thinking to introduce a new taskContext, called `retryCount`, to specify
how many times each task should be retried on failures.
