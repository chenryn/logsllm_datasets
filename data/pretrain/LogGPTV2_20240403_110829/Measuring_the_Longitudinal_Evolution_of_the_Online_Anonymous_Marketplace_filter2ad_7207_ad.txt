egories. Only “Misc” is occasionally confused with Dig-
ital Goods and Prescriptions are occasionally confused
with Benzos (which in fact is not necessarily surprising).
We believe that these errors are most likely caused by
mislabeled test samples. Although we drew our samples
from Evolution and Agora which provide a speciﬁc label
for each listing, the label is selected by the vendor and
may be erroneous, particularly for listings that are hard
to place. Manual inspection revealed that several of the
errors came from item listings that offered US $100 Bills
in exchange for Bitcoin.
We then applied the classiﬁer to the aggregate analy-
sis performed earlier. In addition to placing a particu-
lar feedback in time, and pairing it with an item listing
observation to derive the price, we predicted the class
label of that listing and aggregated the price by class la-
bel. Figure 7 shows the normalized market aggregate by
category. Drug paraphernalia, weapons, electronics, to-
bacco, sildenaﬁl, and steroids were collapsed into a cat-
egory called ‘Other’ for clarity.
Over time the fraction of market share that belongs to
each category is relatively stable. However, around Oc-
tober of 2013, December 2013, March 2014, and January
2015, cannabis spikes up to as much as half of the market
share. These spikes correspond to the earlier mentioned

Figure 7: Fractions of sales per item category.
Reloaded and Sheep scam, 3) Silk Road 2.0 theft [5],
and 4) Operation Onymous respectively. These are all
events that generated substantial doubts in both vendors
and consumers regarding the safety and security of oper-
ating on these marketplaces. At these times the perceived
risk of operation was higher, which may have exerted
pressure towards buying and selling cannabis as opposed
to other products for which the punishment if caught is
much more severe. We can also see that digital goods
take an unusually high market share in times of uncer-
tainty, which is most obvious around October 2013: this
is not surprising as digital goods are often a good way to
quickly accumulate large numbers of listings on a new
marketplace.
Figure 7 shows that after an event such as a take-down
or large scale scam occurs, it takes about 2–3 months
before consumer and vendor conﬁdence is restored and
the markets converge back to equilibrium. At equilib-
rium, cannabis and MDMA (ecstasy) are about 25%
of market demand each with stimulants closely behind
at about 20%. Psychedelics, opioids, and prescription
drugs are a little less than 10% of market demand each,
although starting in November 2014, prescription drugs
have gained signiﬁcant traction—perhaps making anony-
mous marketplaces a viable alternative to unlicensed on-
line pharmacies.
4.3 Vendors
Online anonymous marketplaces are only successful
when they manage to attract a large enough vendor pop-

ulation to provide a critical mass of offerings. At the
same time, vendors are not bound to a speciﬁc market-
place. Anecdotal evidence shows that certain sellers list
products on several marketplaces at once; likewise, cer-
tain sellers “move” from marketplace to marketplace in
response to law enforcement take-down or other market-
place failures. Here, we try to provide a good picture of
the vendor dynamics across the entire ecosystem.
Number of sellers Figure 8 shows, over time, the evo-
lution of the number of active sellers on all the market-
places we considered. For each marketplace, a seller
is deﬁned as active at time T is we observed her hav-
ing at least one active listing at time t ≤ T , and at least
one active listing (potentially the same) at a time t ≥ T .
This is a slightly different deﬁnition from that used in
Christin [13] which required an active listing at time t to
count a seller as active. For us, active sellers include sell-
ers that may be on vacation but will come back, whereas
Christin did not include such sellers. As a result, our re-
sults for Silk Road are very slightly higher than his.
The main takeaway from Figure 8 is that the number of
sellers overall has considerably increased since the days
of Silk Road. By the time Silk Road stopped activities in
2013, it featured around 1,400 sellers; its leading com-
petitors, Atlantis and Black Market Reloaded (BMR)
were much smaller. After the Silk Road take-down (Oc-
tober 2013) and Atlantis closure, we observe that both
BMR and the Sheep marketplace rapidly pick up a large

inﬂux of sellers. In parallel, Silk Road 2.0 also grows at
a very rapid pace. Successful newcomers like Pandora,
Agora, and Evolution also see quick rises in the num-
ber of sellers. After a certain amount of time, however,
per-marketplace population tends to stabilize, even in the
most popular marketplaces. On the other hand, we also
observe that some marketplaces never took off: The Mar-
ketplace, Hydra, Deepbay, and Tor Bazaar, for instance,
consistently have a small number of vendors. In other
words, we see very strong network effects: Either mar-
ketplaces manage to get initial traction and then rapidly
ﬂourish, or they never manage to take off.

a number of sellers reportedly moved to Black Market
