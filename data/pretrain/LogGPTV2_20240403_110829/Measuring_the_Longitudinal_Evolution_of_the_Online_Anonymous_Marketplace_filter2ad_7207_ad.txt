### Classifier Confusion Matrix Analysis

The confusion matrix (Figure 6) provides a detailed breakdown of the classifier's performance across different categories. The categories include:

- **BNZ**: Benzos
- **DG**: Digital Goods
- **DIS**: Dissociatives
- **ELEC**: Electronics
- **MISC**: Miscellaneous
- **OP**: Opioids
- **PAR**: Drug Paraphernalia
- **PSY**: Psychedelics
- **RX**: Prescription Drugs
- **SL**: Sildenafil
- **STI**: Stimulants
- **STR**: Steroids
- **THC**: Cannabis
- **TOB**: Tobacco
- **WPN**: Weapons
- **X**: Ecstasy

The confusion matrix indicates that the "Miscellaneous" category is occasionally misclassified as "Digital Goods," and "Prescription Drugs" are sometimes confused with "Benzos." These errors are likely due to mislabeled test samples, as vendors on platforms like Evolution and Agora may select incorrect labels, especially for ambiguous listings. Manual inspection revealed that some of these errors were from listings offering US $100 bills in exchange for Bitcoin.

### Aggregate Market Analysis

We applied the classifier to the aggregate analysis to predict the class label of each listing and then aggregated the prices by class label. Figure 7 shows the normalized market share by category over time. For clarity, drug paraphernalia, weapons, electronics, tobacco, sildenafil, and steroids were grouped into a single "Other" category.

#### Key Observations:
- The market share for each category remains relatively stable over time.
- Notable spikes in cannabis sales occur around October 2013, December 2013, March 2014, and January 2015. These spikes correspond to significant events such as the take-down of Silk Road, the closure of Black Market Reloaded, the theft at Silk Road 2.0, and Operation Onymous.
- During periods of uncertainty, digital goods also see an increase in market share, likely due to their ease of listing and accumulation on new marketplaces.

After such events, it typically takes about 2-3 months for the market to return to equilibrium. At equilibrium, cannabis and MDMA (ecstasy) each account for approximately 25% of the market demand, followed closely by stimulants at around 20%. Psychedelics, opioids, and prescription drugs each make up less than 10% of the market demand, though prescription drugs have gained significant traction since November 2014.

### Vendor Dynamics

Online anonymous marketplaces rely on a critical mass of vendors to be successful. Vendors are not bound to a specific marketplace and often list products across multiple platforms. To understand vendor dynamics, we analyzed the number of active sellers over time (Figure 8).

#### Key Findings:
- The number of active sellers has significantly increased since the days of Silk Road. By 2013, Silk Road had around 1,400 sellers, while its competitors, Atlantis and Black Market Reloaded, were much smaller.
- After the Silk Road take-down in October 2013 and the closure of Atlantis, both Black Market Reloaded and the Sheep Marketplace saw a rapid influx of new sellers. Similarly, new marketplaces like Pandora, Agora, and Evolution experienced quick growth.
- Over time, the number of sellers in popular marketplaces tends to stabilize, while some marketplaces, such as The Marketplace, Hydra, Deepbay, and Tor Bazaar, never gain significant traction.

#### Seller Aliases
Figure 9 shows the evolution of the number of aliases per seller across all marketplaces. This plot indicates that many vendors use multiple aliases, which can complicate the tracking of their activities. Some vendors moved to other marketplaces after the take-down of Silk Road, and there is no restriction preventing a vendor from operating on multiple platforms simultaneously.

### Conclusion

The analysis of the classifier's performance and the aggregate market data provides valuable insights into the dynamics of online anonymous marketplaces. The stability and shifts in market share, particularly during times of uncertainty, highlight the resilience and adaptability of these markets. Understanding vendor behavior, including the use of multiple aliases and the movement between marketplaces, is crucial for comprehending the broader ecosystem of these platforms.
