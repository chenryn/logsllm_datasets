[Vue warn]: Duplicate presence of slot "default" found in the same render tree
- this will likely cause render errors.
* * *
I have a component `B` which accepts a scopedSlot, and a component `A` which
accepts a slot. `A` is passing in it's slot into the scopedSlot of `B`
When the component `B` gets rerendered, I see this warning in the console. `B`
passes a method to the scoped slot which will cause it to rerender when
called.
