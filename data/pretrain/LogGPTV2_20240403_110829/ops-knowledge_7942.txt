To effectively implement CIS Control 14.5, which focuses on training workforce members on the causes of unintentional data exposure, an organization should follow these key procedures:

1. **Develop a Comprehensive Training Program:**
   - Create a structured training program that covers the common causes of unintentional data exposure. This should include:
     - Mis-delivery of sensitive information (e.g., sending emails to the wrong recipients).
     - Loss or theft of portable devices (e.g., laptops, USB drives) containing sensitive data.
     - Accidental publication of sensitive data to unintended audiences (e.g., posting confidential information on public platforms).

2. **Regular Training Sessions:**
   - Conduct regular training sessions for all employees, including new hires and existing staff. These sessions should be mandatory and scheduled at least annually, with additional refreshers as needed.

3. **Use Real-World Examples and Scenarios:**
   - Incorporate real-world examples and scenarios into the training to make it more relatable and engaging. This can help employees better understand the potential consequences of unintentional data exposure.

4. **Interactive and Engaging Content:**
   - Use interactive and engaging training methods such as quizzes, simulations, and case studies to enhance learning and retention.

5. **Documentation and Record-Keeping:**
   - Maintain detailed records of all training activities, including attendance, topics covered, and any assessments. This documentation is essential for compliance and continuous improvement.

6. **Feedback and Continuous Improvement:**
   - Gather feedback from participants to identify areas for improvement in the training program. Regularly update the content to address new threats and emerging trends.

7. **Integration with Security Policies:**
   - Ensure that the training aligns with the organization's overall security policies and procedures. Emphasize the importance of adhering to these policies to prevent unintentional data exposure.

**Additional Information:**
- **Asset Type:** N/A
- **Security Function:** Protect

By following these procedures, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of unintentional data exposure and enhance their overall data security posture.
