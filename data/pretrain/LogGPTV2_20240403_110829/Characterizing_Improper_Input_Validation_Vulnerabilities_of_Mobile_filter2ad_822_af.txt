### Geo-locating Drivers: A Study of Sensitive Data Leakage in Ride-Hailing Services

Presented at the Annual Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS 2019) in February 2019.

### A. Other Services

#### Fitbit
Fitbit is a popular fitness tracking service with over 10,000,000 Android app installations. It allows users to record walks, hikes, and runs, share their achievements, participate in challenges, and earn badges for their activities. An adversary can exploit this by faking activities to earn badges and win challenges. To demonstrate Fitbit's vulnerability to improper input injections, we spoofed network requests to the Fitbit service. We successfully posted activities that appeared to come from a real device and user account. To verify the injection, we used the response from the spoofed requests and manually verified some randomly chosen requests on a real device. 

To characterize the Improper Input Validation (IIV) attack surface of Fitbit, we followed the Network Vulnerability Exploration (NVE) approach (see Section 3). We studied the successful injection boundaries for an activity’s distance and duration for three activities: walk, hike, and run. Our findings showed that no negative or zero values for distance or duration are allowed. Distance can be added from 1 km to 1609.344 km (equivalent to 10,000 miles). For duration, there was no positive range restriction, allowing us to inject durations from 1 second to 2,147,483,647 seconds (the maximum positive value for a 32-bit signed binary integer, or 2^31 − 1).

#### Map My Run
Map My Run is another fitness tracking service with over 10,000,000 Android app installations. It offers similar features to Fitbit, including tracking and sharing activities, participating in challenges, and earning rewards. Some challenges are sponsored and offer real in-kind rewards. For example, the "You VS the Year 2020" challenge asked users to "Cover 1,020KM in 2020 and be eligible for exclusive prizes from Under Armour."

We reverse-engineered the service’s API and successfully spoofed network requests, which appeared to come from a real device and user. To characterize the adversary’s reach, we performed experiments on the distance and duration of a running activity using the NVE strategy. The minimum duration that can be added is 0. For the maximum value, the remote service accepts arbitrarily large values, but these are always rounded within the constraints of a single day (i.e., x mod 86400). This is concerning because any input validation happens on the client-side, while the values are stored non-validated on the server. Thus, even though we do not know whether the stored values are sanitized, this would require extensive ad-hoc validation checks whenever the value is used, leading to a design prone to errors.

In terms of distance, the minimum accepted distance is 0, and the maximum allowed distance can be arbitrarily large. We were able to increase it up to 100,051.4 miles, which is approximately four times the Earth’s perimeter.

#### ToiFi (Toilet Finder)
ToiFi is a location-based mobile crowdsourcing service (MCS) that helps users find public restrooms when needed. It allows participants to add, edit, or remove Points of Interest (PoIs). The Android app has been installed over 50,000 times. We successfully added and removed PoIs at arbitrary locations. To systematically characterize the attack surface, we used a GPS coordinates exploration strategy to discover the range of coordinates that can be used to fake a public toilet. We identified the API through our Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) proxy and crafted network requests to trigger the API, spoofing the mobile app and a service user. The success of the injection was determined by spoofing a second request targeting a different exposed API to search for the presence of a PoI.

We found that out-of-bound longitude and latitude values (CE-O) are rejected. However, all trials on CE-Long, CE-Lat, and CE-2D were successful, allowing us to inject PoIs anywhere on the Earth's surface. For CE-Prec, we could inject POIs up to a precision of 7 decimal places for both longitude and latitude. There was no check preventing two points from being too close on the map. This can be exploited for fun, pranks, or harm, such as injecting toilets in the middle of the desert or in isolated areas. We marked all PoIs added by our experiments as non-existent by spoofing another API call to avoid harming the service or its users.

### C. Ethical Considerations

#### C.1 IRB Approval
We applied for an Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval at the University of Southern California, which can be verified by study ID: IIR00003094. The following is an excerpt from the response we received: "This study is considered Not Human Subjects Research* and is not subject to 45 CFR 46 regulations, including informed consent requirements or further IRB review." Our study does not qualify for IRB approval because we do not collect data through interaction with humans and do not collect personally identifiable information.

Further details from the IRB response email are provided below:
The University Park Institutional Review Board (UPIRB) designee reviewed the information submitted and determined on 12/10/2019 that the project does not qualify as Human Subjects Research. According to 45 CFR 46.102, Human Subject Research involves a living individual from whom data is obtained through intervention or interaction, or identifiable private information. Research is defined as a systematic investigation designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge.

Nonetheless, we integrated various measures in the design of our experiments to protect users and apps from harm. Below, we elaborate on some of those measures.

#### C.2 Basket Savings
Experiments were conducted after midnight when grocery stores were closed. Item prices were reverted to their original values immediately after each experiment.

#### C.3 Fitbit
Added fake activities were deleted right after the experiments. The fake accounts did not add any real people as friends on the app to minimize interaction with actual users, and we did not participate in any real challenges to win rewards from leaderboards.

#### C.4 Police Detector
The vast majority of inserted POIs were positioned in the ocean or away from human populations, making it unlikely that people were misled. All POIs were deleted right after insertion, ensuring they were only visible for a couple of seconds.

#### C.5 Transit
Experiments targeted the same bus route (18 km) in a rural area during off-peak hours. We verified that only our observer devices were affected, and no actual users were impacted.

#### C.6 Neighbors by Ring
We set our location in Death Valley to limit the number of inhabitants and checked for no activity within the app at and around that location. Accepted posts were removed within 8 minutes of being published. We only interacted with the algorithms and the service itself, collecting openly available and non-identifiable data.

#### C.7 Strava
We did not participate in any real challenges to win real rewards from leaderboards. We did not add any friends on the app, ensuring no other user was notified or could view our fake activities. Added fake accounts and activities were deleted right after the experiments.

#### C.8 Map My Run
Similar to Strava, we did not participate in any real challenges to win real rewards from leaderboards. We did not add any friends on the app, and the added fake accounts and activities were deleted right after the experiments.

#### C.9 ToiFi (Toilet Finder)
The majority of inserted POIs were located in the ocean or away from human populations. All POIs were deleted immediately after insertion, ensuring they were only visible for a couple of seconds at most.

#### C.10 Google Maps
Experiments were conducted within the university campus and after midnight to minimize the effect on users. We were physically present to ensure no people were present and could abort the experiment if necessary.

#### C.11 Gas Buddy
Prices were reverted to normal right after changing them, ensuring they were visible on the app for only a couple of seconds. All experiments took place after midnight to further minimize potential exposure of users to the fake prices.
