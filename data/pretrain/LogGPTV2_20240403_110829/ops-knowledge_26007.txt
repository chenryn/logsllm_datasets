User: I have a bash script that I've defined to run in startup, which runs a python script that waits for a command from another process, and when it gets it, it should open a chromium window with a certain URL.
When I run this script manually it works fine, but when the script runs from startup, I get an error (displayed in syslog): 

Gtk: Can't open display

I guess that's because it's running in a startup mode so it doesn't actually have a display to "lean" on...
I was wondering if there's any way to get this work, anyway?
Thanks in advance
Assistant: In your script that runs on startup try DISPLAY=:0 <command> &
To clarify DISPLAY=:0 simply sets which monitor your window opens on with 0 representing the first monitor of the local machine.
