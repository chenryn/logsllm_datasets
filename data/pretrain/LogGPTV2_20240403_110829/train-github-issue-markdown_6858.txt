I am currently using a jQuery plugin for dropdown menus, but it seems to be preventing the mouse wheel from functioning properly. My goal is to have both the dropdown functionality and the ability to scroll with the mouse wheel.

Here are the details of my setup:
- Operating System: Windows XP
- Browser: Firefox 19.0.2
- jQuery Version: 1.7.1

Could you please provide guidance on how to achieve this?
