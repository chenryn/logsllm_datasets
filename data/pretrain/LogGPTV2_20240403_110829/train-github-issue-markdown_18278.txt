I know we're not talking release quality code, that this is still beta...but I
do wonder if `Insiders.app/Contents/Resources/app/extensions/jrieken.vscode-
omnisharp/bin/omnisharp' with process id 47120...` should be there. The error
is that Omnisharp is not starting "[ERROR:OmniSharp.Dnx.DesignTimeHostManager]
Failed to launch DesignTimeHost in a timely fashion."  
But the main question is if code should include developers' names or be more
generically named.
