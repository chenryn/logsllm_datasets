### NSA Playset Series
#### What is the NSA Playset?
The NSA Playset aims to make cutting-edge security tools more accessible, easier to understand, and harder to forget.

#### NSA Playset Talks
- **RF Retroreflector**: Friday, 12:00 PM, Penn & Teller
- **DIY Hardware Implant**: Sunday, 11:00 AM, Penn & Teller
- **GSM Sniffing**: Sunday, 12:00 PM, Penn & Teller
- **PCIe**: Sunday, 2:00 PM, Penn & Teller

---

### Inspired by the NSA
The NSA reportedly has a hardware hacking catalog, similar to SkyMall but for spies, minus the Bigfoot.

- **Example**: "Oh look honey, there’s an I2C controller board we can get. It attaches to a computer and is modular, so you can add a GSM cell phone for exfiltration."
- **Response**: "That's nice, dear. I wonder how that works..."

---

### Requirements for the Implant
- **Reverse-Engineered Requirements**:
  - Must attach over I2C to the target.
  - Must include GSM reachback to the implant.
- **Our Requirements**:
  - Easy to use.
  - Use as much commodity hardware as possible.
  - Fun.

### Background: What is I2C?
- **Serial Bus**: Two-wire interface (plus power and ground).
- **Data Line (SDA)** and **Clock Line (SCL)**.
- **Multi-master and Multi-slave**.
- **Addressable**.
- **Standard Speed**: 100kHz (100kbps), High Speed: 3.2Mbps (theoretical max).
- **Voltage**: Typically 5V or 3.3V.
- **Note**: The term "slave" is the technically correct term in this context.

---

### I2C Attack Surfaces
- EEPROMs
- PCI and PCIe
- Battery Controllers
- Video Interfaces

---

### Video I2C
- **Question**: Why is there I2C on your monitor adapter?
- **Answer**: Your computer uses I2C to automatically detect monitor resolution via EDID (Extended Display Identification Data) and DDC (Data Display Channel, a.k.a. 5V I2C).

---

### EDID
- **Description**: Extended Display Identification Data.
- **Tools**:
  - `edid-decode`
  - `ioreg -lw0 -r -c "IODisplayConnect"`

---

### EDID Extension Blocks
- **Tag Number** | **Extension Block Description**
  - 00h: Timing Extension
  - 02h: CEA-EXT: CEA 861 Series Extension
  - 10h: VTB-EXT: Video Timing Block Extension
  - 20h: EDID 2.0 Extension
  - 40h: DI-EXT: Display Information Extension
  - 50h: LS-EXT: Localized String Extension
  - 60h: DPVL-EXT: Digital Packet Video Link Extension
  - A7h, AFh, BFh: DTCDB-EXT: Display Transfer Characteristics
  - F0h: EXTENSION Block Map
  - FFh: EXTENSIONS defined by the OEM
- **Parsing**: Implemented by the OS-supplied VESA driver or GPU driver manufacturer.

### Exploiting EDID/EDID Extension Parsing
- **Reference**: "Hacking Displays Made Interesting" by Andy Davis at Blackhat EU 2012.
- **Tools**:
  - [EDIDFuzzer](https://github.com/nccgroup/EDIDFuzzer)
  - Simple adaptation for BeagleBone implemented in Python (BBIO): [bone-edidfuzzer](https://github.com/theopolis/bone-edidfuzzer)
- **Goals**:
  - Discover proprietary EDID extensions.
  - More fuzzing.
  - Assume a-priori software control.

---

### I2C Everywhere
- **Video Cards**: May have multiple I2C buses and devices, such as:
  - EEPROM for encrypted HDCP keys
  - Onboard voltage regulator
  - Thermal sensor
  - TV decoder chip (older cards)

---

### Exploring VGA I2C
- **VGA Pinout**:
  - Pin 1: RED (Red Video)
  - Pin 2: GREEN (Green Video)
  - Pin 3: BLUE (Blue Video)
  - ...
  - Pin 5: GND (Ground)
  - Pin 9: KEY (Optional +5V output from graphics card)
  - Pin 12: SDA (I2C data)
  - Pin 15: SCL (I2C data clock)

---

### Controller Selection
- **BeagleBone Black**:
  - 1GHz AM3358 ARM® Cortex-A8
  - 512MB DDR3 RAM
  - Two independent Programmable Real-Time Units (32-bit)
  - Crypto accelerators for AES, SHA, MD5
  - UARTs, PWM, LCD, GPMC, SPI, ADC, CAN, Timers
  - Two I2C buses

---

### CryptoCape
- **Hardware Security ICs**:
  - Authenticators: ECC & MAC (SHA256)
  - Encrypted EEPROM (AES-128-CCM)
  - Battery-backed Real-time Clock
  - Trusted Platform Module
  - ATmega328p (Arduino-compatible)
