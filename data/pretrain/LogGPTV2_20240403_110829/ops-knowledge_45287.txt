I am currently testing my application using the terminal, which is quite convenient during the pre-development phase. So far, I have been using `spotipy.Spotify(client_credentials_manager=client_credentials_manager)` in my Python scripts to access data. The `SpotifyClientCredentials()` function requires `client_id` and `client_secret` as parameters.

Now, I need to access the `analysis_url` data, which requires an access token. Is there a way to include this access token requirement directly in my Python script that runs from the command line, or do I need to build a web application just for this simple test?

Thank you in advance for your help.

**Response:**

To obtain the access token, you can use the `SpotifyOAuth` class from the Spotipy library, which handles the authentication process and caches the access token. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. **Set up SpotifyOAuth:**
   ```python
   from spotipy.oauth2 import SpotifyOAuth

   sp_oauth = SpotifyOAuth(
       client_id='your_client_id',
       client_secret='your_client_secret',
       redirect_uri='your_redirect_uri',
       scope='user-read-recently-played'
   )
   ```

2. **Get the authorization URL and open it in your browser:**
   ```python
   auth_url = sp_oauth.get_authorize_url()
   print(f"Please visit this URL to authorize: {auth_url}")
   ```

3. **Copy and paste the entire redirect URI from your browser to the terminal (when prompted) after successful authentication.** Your access token will be cached in the directory (look for `.cache.<username>`).

4. **Use the cached token to create a Spotify object:**
   ```python
   token_info = sp_oauth.get_cached_token()
   if token_info:
       access_token = token_info['access_token']
       sp = spotipy.Spotify(auth=access_token)
   else:
       print("Failed to retrieve access token.")
   ```

This approach allows you to handle the authentication and token retrieval directly from your command-line script without needing to build a full web application.
