User: I am testing my app using the terminal, which is quite handy in a pre-development phase.
so far, I have used spotipy.Spotify(client_credentials_manager=client_credentials_manager) within my python scripts in order to access data. 
SpotifyClientCredentials() requires client_idand client_secret as parameters.
now I need to access analysis_url data, which requires an access token.
Is there a way to include this access token requirement via my python script ran at command line or do I have to build an app on the browser just to do a simple test?
many thanks on advance.
Assistant: Copy and paste the entire redirect URI from your browser to the terminal (when prompted) after successful authentication.  Your access token will be cached in the directory (look for .cache.<username>)
