4. CASE STUDY: UAGS FROM IHEART
This section presents the deﬁning features of UAGs ob-
served in our most popular application, iHeart. As men-
tioned in Section 3.1, iHeart shares structure and design
with other gifting applications on Facebook. We build our
algorithm to simulate iHeart’s UAGs ﬁrst, and then test it
on our other gifting applications. We use the activity peri-
ods listed in Table 1 for this analysis.
Our ﬁndings suggest graph metrics do not stabilize in
hourly or daily activity traces. We measure convergence
times for the key graph metrics to gauge the minimum pe-
riod required for metric stability in our UAGs.
4.1 Convergence of Key Graph Metrics
We deﬁne the convergence time Z as the amount of time
it takes for metric values to stabilize for our UAGs. More
speciﬁcally, Z = min z such that f(z + 1) − f(z) ≈ 0, where
f(z) represents metric values measured from a UAG of the
ﬁrst z days in a given time period.
Degree Distributions: We measured Z for in- and out-
degree distributions on iHeart by comparing aggregated user
activity (starting at Sunday) for the 10 time periods listed
in Table 1. The function f(z) represents the CDF of user
activity over z days for the in- or out-degree distribution.

Figure 2: The number of connected components and clustering coeﬃcients over 14 days of aggregated user
activity for iHeart, starting at Sunday for weeks 34-2009 (pre-peak), 50-2009 (peak) and 26-2010 (post-peak).
The resulting f(z + 1)− f(z) values, or Euclidean Distances
(EDs) indicate a small distance between f(2) and f(1) (i.e.,
one and two days’ aggregate user activity) for both in- and
out-degrees, and that this diﬀerence decreases monotonically
as z increases. The in- and out-degree distributions stabilize
roughly at z = 7 days, with ED ≤ 2.5% for all 10 weekly
activity periods. An exception occurs when new content is
introduced during week days, where out-degree distribution
EDs spike to up to 34%. However, we observe ED ≤ 2.5%
as we approach the end of the week.
Connected Components: We look at two metrics with
regards to connected components in our UAGs: the number
of connected components and the percentage of users in the
largest connected component.
In general, we ﬁnd that as more users interact through
ARs, the number of distinct connected components grows.
However, unlike degree distributions, in our applications the
number of connected components behaves diﬀerently for pre-
peak, peak and post-peak activity periods.
In the peak
activity period the number stabilizes over the course of a
week, but it does not converge in either pre-peak or post-
peak activity periods. Figure 2(a) shows this behavior for
the representative periods on iHeart. More speciﬁcally, the
number of connected components declines when z increases
for pre-peak activity periods, indicating that increasing AR
activity between users merges the largest component with
smaller, fragmented components. In post-peak activity pe-
riods, in contrast, the number of connected components in-
creases as z increases. User fatigue is a possible explanation
for this phenomenon, i.e., users take longer to return to the
application leading to formation of small (up to 110 node)
components that do not connect with the largest component
as quickly as in the pre-peak periods.
The percentage of users in the largest component, how-
ever, does stabilize for our UAGs.
If f(z) represents the
percentage of users in the largest connected component, we
ﬁnd that f(z + 1)− f(z) ≤ 0.5% where z ≥ 6 for all time pe-
riods considered (Table 1). For diﬀerent time periods, how-
ever, f(7) varies between 90.17% and 94.89%. Note that
the second largest components for our weekly UAGs are of
negligible size (less than 20 nodes).
Clustering Coeﬃcients (CC): Figure 2(b) shows the
CC for undirected iHeart UAGs for three representative pe-
riods 14 days of activity. We have previously discussed the
eﬀect of user engagement on CCs in UAGs from social appli-
cations in [16], where we showed a highly engaging gaming
application exhibited high node clustering (CC = 0.8). In
contrast, Figure 2(b) shows the CC is very small for iHeart,
but that increasing z results in slightly higher CC. Note that
the aim of this study is to provide a growth model that ap-
proximates gifting UAGs as a ﬁrst step. Therefore, we seek
to generate synthetic graphs with low or no clustering of
nodes rather than graphs with precisely the same number of
clusters as in our empirical UAGs.
A weekly snapshot of user activity captures a full cycle of
low and high user activity for OSN-based applications [16].
Moreover, since gifting applications are non-recurrent (com-
pared to social gaming applications), less than 10% of users
return in a consecutive week. This high churn of users means
every week’s user activity can almost be treated indepen-
dently. Our results show both degree distributions and per-
centage of users in the largest connected components stabi-
lize within 7 days of user activity. Therefore, we focus only
on weekly time periods for our ﬁrst UAG growth model.
4.2 Approximating Degree Distributions
Existing research indicates power laws may partially ex-
plain degree distributions in OSN graphs [15, 19]. However,
our measurements indicate that known parametrized distri-
butions do not accurately ﬁt the full range of the degree dis-
tributions for gifting UAGs. Unfortunately, this means that
the simple growth mechanisms known to give rise to the pa-
rameterized distributions (such as preferential attachment
which leads to power laws, or multiplication of independent
random variables with leads to log-normal distributions) do
not suﬃce to explain growth of our UAGs. To demonstrate
the lack of ﬁt, we attempt to ﬁt the candidate distributions
shown in Table 2 to our real user activity data.
We perform Goodness of Fit (GoF) tests for potential can-
didate distributions (Table 2) for iHeart UAGs. We use the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic between the data and
parametric ﬁts to measure applicability of the distributions
to our UAGs. The KS statistic is suggested as a reliable GoF
measure for heavy-tailed distribution approximation [4]. We
do an exhaustive search of the parameter space to ﬁnd the
best ﬁt that minimizes the error for a given distribution.
First, consider in-degree distributions. The KS statistic
indicates that both PL and PLED provide ﬁts with good
statistical accuracy, while LN, SE and EXP are orders of
magnitude higher for all weekly UAGs (see Table 3). Be-

decay with exponent γo and tail with LN with mean
µ and standard deviation σ.
tween PL and PLED, the latter is more accurate for the
early portion of the distribution, yet PL captures tail events
better, is a simpler distribution, and achieves overall accu-
racy very close to the PLED ﬁt. Figure 3 shows an example
PL ﬁt (starting at k = 12) to the week 34-2009 UAG from
iHeart, and Table 6 shows the best-ﬁt distribution parame-
ter values for the three representative weeks.
Now consider out-degree distributions. Figure 3 shows an
example out-degree distribution for week 34-2009. The alge-
braic ‘steps’ in weekly out-degree distributions occur at mul-
tiples of daily AR limits (shown as M in Table 1). Note that
more than 88% of AR senders in any week have out-degrees
less than the daily AR limit, i.e., only a small fraction of
users send 20 or more ARs in a given week.
We ﬁnd that the out-degree distributions are best ﬁt by
splitting the data into two parts at the daily AR limit: we
call the data up to the daily AR limit the bulk of the distri-
bution, while degrees above the daily AR limit are the tail of
the distribution. This is because the behavior exhibited by
the bulk diﬀers signiﬁcantly from the tail, highlighting the
fact that 1) most users do not exhaust the daily AR limit,
and 2) most users visit gifting applications once a week due
to low engagement [16]. The KS statistic indicates the out-
degree distributions for the bulk are explained best by an
algebraic decay (PL), followed by PLED, SE, EXP and LN,
in that order, whereas the tail can be reasonably ﬁt using
either an LN or PL distribution, as shown in Tables 4 and
5. The KS statistic is not extremely sensitive to tail events,
and visual inspection conﬁrms that LN provides a better ﬁt
to the tail for all weeks studied. Figure 3 shows an example
best ﬁt for out-degrees, and Table 6 shows the best-ﬁt distri-
bution parameter values for the three representative weeks.
We performed these ﬁts by removing all multiples of daily
AR limits to reduce distortion in KS values.
Thus a power law can reasonably ﬁt the in-degree dis-
tribution, but no simple parametric distribution describes
the full out-degree distribution. Even when ﬁtting the out-
degree with two diﬀerent distributions, the values of the pa-
rameters for these distributions vary considerably as seen in
Table 6. As such, we cannot explain UAG growth via a sim-
ple mechanism like preferential attachment or multiplicative
growth. Our ﬁndings are valid for all other weekly periods
(Table 1) as well.
