User: When I type python into the command line, the command prompt says python is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program, or batch file. What should I do?
Note: I have Python 2.7 and Python 3.2 installed on my computer.
Assistant: Just go with the command py. I'm running python 3.6.2 on windows 7 and it works just fine.

I removed all the python paths from the system directory and the paths don't show up when I run the command echo %path% in cmd. Python is still working fine.

I ran into this by accidentally pressing enter while typing python...
EDIT: I didn't mention that I installed python to a custom folder C:\Python\
