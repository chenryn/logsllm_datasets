User: Suppose your company has a cluster of 5 servers, and load balancing is performed among the servers. Please give a solution to avoid single point of failure.
Assistant: One solution is to use a multi-host load balancer (LB). This LB will load balance across all servers, ensuring that no single point of failure occurs by checking the availability of each server. If one of the servers becomes unavailable for some reason, LB can redistribute the load to other available servers, thus ensuring service continuity and availability. At the same time, the solution should also consider the use of redundant power supply and network connections to ensure high availability of the network, and to achieve fast switching of emergency backup servers to overcome single point of failure.
