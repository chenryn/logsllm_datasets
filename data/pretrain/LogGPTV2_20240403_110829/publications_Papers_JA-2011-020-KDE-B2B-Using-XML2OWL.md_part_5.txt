### Optimized Text

If the elements have already been previously mapped, it is possible to achieve an automatic, transaction-based integration. The reuse of these mappings is important for several reasons:

1. **Enhanced Reliability**: Reusing tested and proven mappings increases the reliability of the mapping quality.
2. **Increased Speed**: Reusing a mapping significantly reduces the time required to establish new mappings, as the work does not need to be repeated.
3. **Efficient Change Management**: If an external or internal specification changes, the mapping only needs to be updated once, and the change is automatically applied to all reuse cases, making the change process highly efficient.

In our future work, we will focus on applying the concept of XML to OWL mappings to integrate patient information in the healthcare sector. Specifically, we aim to provide surgeons with integrated patient information in operative situations. Given that the XML-based DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine) standard is widely used in hospitals to ensure interoperability between devices from different vendors, and medical ontologies have proven to be valuable in many medical scenarios, we believe that integrating these two healthcare domains (syntactic and semantic) can produce significant synergies. This integration will support the development of new medical systems and solutions.

**Listing 4: Simplified Version of the OWL Ontology for Hiltrix Corporation's Purchasing Orders**

The ontology has three main classes: `Order`, `Part`, and `Manufacturer`.

```owl
...
<owl:Class rdf:about="http://.../Order">
  ...
</owl:Class>
<owl:Class rdf:about="http://.../Part">
  ...
</owl:Class>
<owl:Class rdf:about="http://.../Manufacturer">
  ...
</owl:Class>
...
```

**Listing 5: Mappings Established Between the cXML Purchase Order and the Hiltrix Corporation's Purchase Order Ontology**

The following six mappings were stored internally in JXML2OWL in XML format, as described in Section 4.2.

```xml
<mapping>
  <source>http://.../cXML-OR-Patagonia-Corp.xml</source>
  <target>http://.../Hitrix-Corp-InternalOrder.owl</target>
  <element>Order</element>
  ...
</mapping>
```

This structured and detailed approach ensures clarity and coherence, making the text more professional and easier to understand.
