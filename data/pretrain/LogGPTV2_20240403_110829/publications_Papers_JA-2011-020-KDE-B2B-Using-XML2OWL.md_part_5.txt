an automatic transaction-based integration.
The reuse of mappings is important for many reasons. First, it increases the
reliability of the quality of the mapping as already tested and proven mappings
are reused. Second, the speed of establishing mappings increases as reusing a
mapping means that the work does not have to be done again. Thirdly, if an
external or internal specification is changed, a mapping has to be changed only
onceandthechangethenisappliedtoallreusecasesautomatically,makingthe
change process very efficient.
Our future work will have a particular emphasis on applying the concept of
XML to OWL mappings to integrate patient information in the area of health-
care.Moreprecisely,weenvisionprovidingsurgeonswithintegratedinformation
about patients in operative situations. Since the XML-based DICOM (Digital
Imaging and Communication in Medicine) standard has become widely used in
hospitals to ensure the interoperability between devices manufactured by dif-
ferent vendors and, at the same time, medical ontologies have proven to be an
important asset in many medical scenarios, we believe that the integration of
these two healthcare worlds (syntactic and semantic) can produce important
synergies that will support the development of new medical systems and solu-
tions.

Listing 4 shows a simplified version of the OWL ontology used to represent
purchasing orders received by the Hiltrix Corporation. The ontology has three
main classes: Order, Part and Manufacturer.
