This would constitute an addition of two new formatting flags, `{:e}` and
`{:E}` and corresponding traits (e.g `LowerSci` and `UpperSci`). Here's the
output I envision based on how Rust handles floating point and signs today.
Notably, this differs from how C does it (Rust already differs from C, see
#1375):
    format!("{:e}", 1.0) == "1e0";
    format!("{:e}", 10.0) == "1e1";
    format!("{:+e}", 10.0) == "+1e+1";
    format!("{:e}", 1.1234567) == "1.123457e0";
    format!("{:e}", 1.3e-1) == "1.3e-1";
    format!("{:.2e}", 1.3e-1) == "1.30e-1";
    format!("{:E}", 1.3e-1) == "1.3E-1";
