## Abstract
Post-quantum secure communication has garnered significant attention in recent years. While known computationally secure post-quantum key agreement protocols are resource-intensive for small devices, these devices often need to securely transmit frequent, short messages, such as sensor measurements. Secure communication using physical assumptions offers information-theoretic security (and thus quantum-safe) with minimal computational overhead. However, the security and efficiency analysis of these systems is typically asymptotic. In this poster, we examine two secure message communication systems and derive and compare their security and efficiency for finite-length messages. Our results indicate that these systems provide a compelling alternative for post-quantum security.

## 1. Introduction
The Internet of Things (IoT) promises universal connectivity for billions of sensors that will monitor our environment and automate many aspects of our lives [14]. In many scenarios, the data collected by these sensors and exchanged among devices is highly sensitive and must be protected over a long period. Most current cryptographic algorithms and protocols assume a computationally bounded adversary, relying on the difficulty of solving problems like discrete logarithm (DL) and integer factorization. These problems underpin the security of the Diffie-Hellman (DH) key agreement protocol and RSA cryptosystem. Peter Shor [11] proposed efficient (polynomial-time) quantum algorithms for both DL and integer factorization, which would effectively break down the cryptographic infrastructure if a quantum computer is developed. Recent advancements in quantum technologies have led security agencies [12] to recommend moving to quantum-safe algorithms, followed by standardization efforts [6].

To provide post-quantum security, one can use computational assumptions such as Learning With Errors (LWE) [9], for which no quantum algorithm is known, and employ secure key agreement protocols based on these assumptions. However, many such protocols, including those in [1] and [3], are not suitable for resource-constrained devices common in IoT systems. For example, establishing a key with 144 bits of classical security and 130 bits of quantum security using Frodo (a LWE-based key exchange) protocol requires approximately 22.5 Kbytes of communication [3], while a practical RSA key agreement protocol with 128 bits of claimed classical security and no quantum security requires only about 0.7 Kbytes of communication.

An alternative approach to providing post-quantum private communication is to use physical layer assumptions to ensure secrecy. Physical layer security adds a layer of security that is accessible to small devices and can be complemented by traditional cryptographic systems [7]. The use of physical layer assumptions for securing communication dates back to Wyner's pioneering work [15], which showed that environmental noise can be used as a cryptographic resource. In the Wyner wiretap model and its extension by Csiszár and Körner [4], the sender is connected to the receiver and the eavesdropper through two noisy channels: the main channel (T) and the wiretapper channel (W). These works proved that secure communication with asymptotic perfect secrecy and reliability is possible without a shared secret key, provided the wiretapper channel is "noisier" than the main channel. This model captures wireless communication systems where a transmitted message can be intercepted by an eavesdropper, albeit in a weaker form. The model has attracted the research community and system developers interested in lightweight but strong cryptographic solutions, as it promises information-theoretic security with long-term guarantees without a shared secret key. Designing a wiretap protocol requires accurate estimation of the noise over communication channels, which can be challenging. In an IoT setting, however, since many sensors monitor the environment, building a robust model of the environment and communication channel noise is feasible. Wiretap codes are traditionally analyzed in the asymptotic regime, but for real-world applications, concrete performance parameters in the finite-length regime must be estimated. To compare the efficiency of wiretap codes in practice, the rate of secure communication for finite-length messages must be determined. This involves estimating the decoding error (reliability error) and the secrecy level offered by the code for finite-length messages, a challenging problem that has received significant attention in recent years [8]. In this poster, we outline an approach for evaluating the security of modular wiretap codes and use it to compare two constructions.

## 2. Approach
A capacity-achieving wiretap code is an encoding scheme for a wiretap channel that achieves the highest theoretically possible rate of secure message transmission (number of securely transmitted message bits per channel use). Explicit constructions of wiretap codes can be divided into those based on specific error-correcting codes (ECCs) [5] and those that separate coding for security from coding for reliability, making them more flexible in the choice of ECCs. The latter, called modular constructions, are attractive for practical use due to their flexibility. These constructions are seeded encryption systems, requiring a random seed to be shared by the transmitter and the receiver. The seed can be sent by the sender to the receiver over the main channel using an ECC to ensure reliability. The seed length does not affect the asymptotic efficiency of the system because it can be reused for encrypting multiple blocks. The only two constructions that provide semantic security are in [2] and [10]. We focus on these constructions.

In this work, we first propose a framework for comparing the efficiency of modular constructions by defining the finite-length rate (FLR) and then compare the FLR for the two modular constructions: Hash-then-Encode (HtE) [10] and Invert-then-Encode (ItE) [2].

### Finite-length Efficiency
In [10], the effective communication rate of a seeded wiretap coding is introduced, which takes into account the length of the seed. This rate is used to define and compare the FLR of the security coding components of the two known seeded wiretap constructions, HtE and ItE.

**Definition 2.1.** The effective communication rate of a seeded encryption system, taking into account the transmission cost of the seed, is given by:
\[ R = \frac{\text{encryption block length} + \text{seed length}}{\text{message length}} \]

For finite-length messages, security and reliability losses are non-zero values and must be estimated for a given message length and eavesdropper channel. This analysis is generally complex and requires finite-length analysis of the specific ECC used for correcting errors in the receiver channel or obtaining general bounds on the decoding error for a finite-length ECC [8]. The following definition of FLR considers the security and reliability of finite-length wiretap codes.

**Definition 2.2.** For a wiretap channel \( W(\cdot) \) and a single message block \( m \) of length \( b \), a wiretap code with encoder \( \text{WtEnc}(\cdot) \) has a finite-length rate \((\epsilon, \delta)\)-FLR if:

1. For any \( m_0 \) and \( m_1 \):
   \[ \text{SD}[W(\text{WtEnc}(m_0)), W(\text{WtEnc}(m_1))] \leq \epsilon \]
2. For any message \( m_A \) sent by Alice, the corresponding \( m_B \) received by Bob satisfies:
   \[ \Pr[m_A \neq m_B] \leq \delta \]
3. For any message \( m \) of length \( b \), the encoding rate satisfies:
   \[ \frac{\text{length of encoded message}}{\text{length of original message}} \]

This framework allows us to evaluate and compare the security and efficiency of different wiretap code constructions in the finite-length regime.
