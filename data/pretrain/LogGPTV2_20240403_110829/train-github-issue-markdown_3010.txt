# Environment
    Windows 10 188995
    Latest nightly terminal build as-of 10/6
# Steps to reproduce
Install PowerShell Core as a .NET Core global tool. `dotnet tool install -g
powershell`. Confirm it works when you use `pwsh.exe`.
Create a new PowerShell Core profile and set "source": to
"Windows.Terminal.PowershellCore". And open a new shell. Doesn't work.
Commenting out `source` and using `"commandLine": "pwsh.exe"` works, as it is
in the path.
# Expected behavior
PowerShell Core should load.
# Actual behavior
Profile is skipped or doesn't load.
