User: I am writing a script that will be polling a directory looking for new files. 
In this scenario, is it necessary to do some sort of error checking to make sure the files are completely written prior to accessing them?  
I don't want to work with a file before it has been written completely to disk, but because the info I want from the file is near the beginning, it seems like it could be possible to pull the data I need without realizing the file isn't done being written.
Is that something I should worry about, or will the file be locked because the OS is writing to the hard drive?
This is on a Linux system.
Assistant: Yes it will. 
I prefer the "file naming convention" and renaming solution described by Donal.
