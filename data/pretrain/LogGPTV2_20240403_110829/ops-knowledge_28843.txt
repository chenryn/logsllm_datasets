User: Is it possible to render any kind of 3D images in Google App Engine (with Backends)?
I'm looking for a Python solution, but I will learn Java if needed.
Assistant: App Engine doesn't currently support C modules on the Python runtime. As a result, any rendering code would have to be written entirely in Python, and would be very, very slow. You couldn't take advantage of a GPU, either, since the runtime doesn't supply one.
Your best option, if you care at all about efficiency, is to call out to a server that does the rendering for you.
