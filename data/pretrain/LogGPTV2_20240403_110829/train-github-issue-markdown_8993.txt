When attempting to build using `make full-source-dist`, the process fails during the second stage. The issue arises because `deps/pcre.mk` attempts to fetch PCRE2 from `ftp.pcre.org`, which is no longer available. Specifically, the following line in `deps/pcre.mk` is problematic:

```plaintext
https://ftp.pcre.org/pub/pcre/pcre2-$(PCRE_VER).tar.bz2
```

The website `https://pcre.org` (last updated on Thu, 04 Nov 2021 23:13:21 GMT) states:

> Note that the former `ftp.pcre.org` FTP site is no longer available. You will need to update any scripts that download PCRE source code to download via HTTPS, Git, or Subversion from the new home on GitHub instead.

Additionally, `pcre.org` no longer officially provides version 10.36. Here is the relevant information from the PCRE2 ChangeLog and an example of the failure when using a system-installed PCRE version 10.39 while building `julia-git-1.8.0.DEV.r51086.gdd0c14ba1d0` with `USE_SYSTEM_PCRE:=1`:

```plaintext
PCRE2_jll (1) | started at 2022-01-18T20:06:00.377
PCRE2_jll (1) | failed at 2022-01-18T20:06:15.913
Test Failed at aur/julia-git/src/julia/usr/share/julia/stdlib/v1.8/PCRE2_jll/test/runtests.jl
Expression: vn == v"10.36.0"
Evaluated: v"10.39.0" == v"10.36.0"
```

This test failure occurs due to a version string assertion check, indicating that the expected version (10.36.0) does not match the installed version (10.39.0).

To resolve this issue, the script should be updated to download PCRE2 from the new location on GitHub and ensure compatibility with the latest available version.
