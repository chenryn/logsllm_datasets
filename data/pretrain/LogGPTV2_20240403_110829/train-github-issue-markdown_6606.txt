### Title: Support for Non-Page JS/JSX Files in the `pages` Directory

This is a frequently requested feature, with multiple related issues reported, including #3508, #1914, #1689, #1545, and #988. There may be additional issues as well (e.g., #3183).

The feature was initially implemented in Pull Request #3195. However, at some point, the `pagesGlobPattern` configuration became non-functional, and it was subsequently removed in Pull Request #3578.

Enabling this feature would allow developers to place supporting files, such as tests, components, and utilities, directly within the `pages` directory alongside the pages they support. This would significantly enhance the file organization of applications, particularly for large-scale projects.
