 _Original title: Support having non-page js/jsx files in pages dir_
This is an often requested feature. See issues #3508 #1914 #1689 #1545 #988
and there are likely more. _edit: Also#3183._
This issue was fixed in PR #3195 but somewhere along the way the
`pagesGlobPattern` config became broken, and was cleaned out in PR #3578.
This feature would allow us to place files that support specific pages, _with
the pages that they support_. These "support" files could be tests,
components, utilities, and more. This would improve the application's file
organization, especially for large projects.
