Subject: Issue with Uploading CSV to Superset via New Postgres Database

Hello GitHub Community,

I have successfully configured a new PostgreSQL database and connected it to Superset. However, I am encountering an issue when trying to use the "Upload CSV" option. The system returns the following error message: 

> ERROR: Failed to fetch schemas allowed for CSV upload in this database! Please contact your Superset Admin!

I have already enabled the "Allow CSV Upload" option in the EXTRA tab of the database configuration. Despite this, the problem persists.

As a temporary workaround, I created dummy data in the database and then imported it into Superset using an SQL query.

Could you please provide any suggestions or insights on how to resolve this issue?

Thank you for your help.

Best regards,
Gaurang M
