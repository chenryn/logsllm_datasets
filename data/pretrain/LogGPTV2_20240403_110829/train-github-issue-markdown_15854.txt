Hi Github Fam,
I am now successfully able to configure new Postgres database and able to
connect to SuperSet via it but I am still not able to use upload CSV option,
it gives me error that "ERROR: Failed to fetch schemas allowed for csv upload
in this database! Please contact your Superset Admin!". I have already
selected "allowed CSV upload" option from EXTRA tab. Please suggest.
Alternate solution - I created dummy data in database and then pulled it via
SQL in Superset.
Warm Regards,
Gaurang M
