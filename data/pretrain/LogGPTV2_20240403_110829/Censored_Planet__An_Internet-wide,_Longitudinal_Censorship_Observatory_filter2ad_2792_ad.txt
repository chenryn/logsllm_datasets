Net-
censorship remained unusually high through April, and then spiked
again in the week of May 12, 2019. This contrasts most reports
claiming that the social media ban was lifted by May 1st [3, 70].
Our observations stress the importance of continuous and repetitive
longitudinal measurements.
7.1.2 Uncovering New Events: DNS Blocking in Norway. Norway
is ranked #1 (Most Free) in the Reporters Without Border Press
Freedom Index [88]. However, recent laws passed in the coun-
try encourage the blocking of websites featuring gambling and
pornography [23, 40], which led ISPs to start performing DNS
blocking [23, 60]. Our anomaly detection alerted us to high scores
in DNS blocking starting from December 2019 until March 2020
(cf. Table 1). We therefore analyze Satellite data during that period.
Censored Planet data reveals extremely aggressive DNS blocking
of many domains in Norway, with many blocks being consistent in
all of our vantage points. During the four month period of increased
censorship, 25 ASes observed blocking of more than 10 domains in
at least six categories. We observed the most rigorous activity in
AS 2116 (CATCHCOM), where more than 50 domains were blocked.
The large number of categories being targeted shows that ISPs
in Norway are not only restricting pornography and gambling
websites, as previously thought. Indeed, the most blocked domains
included search engines (163.com), online dating sites (match.com),
and the website of the Human Rights Watch (hrw.org). The DNS
blocking in Norway also shows a highly increasing trend from
the beginning of our measurements. Our observations show the
importance of measurements in countries previously thought as free.
7.2 Trend Analysis
In this section, we discuss some primary findings from our trend
analysis of censorship data.
7.2.1 Trends in Methods. First, we consider the trends in censor-
ship methods. Our key findings are as follows (cf. Figure 8):
Figure 7: Social Networking Censorship in Sri Lanka.
timeframe of ICLab measurements overlaps with only the first two
months of Censored Planet measurements. Only one event (India–6
September 2018) in Table 1 falls under this timeframe, and we did
not find evidence of any DNS blocking in India in ICLab data during
that time. We next describe two events from Table 1 in detail.
7.1.1 Extending Events: Social Media Blocking in Sri Lanka. On
April 21, 2019, several bomb blasts targeting churches and hotels
resulted in the death of more than 250 people in Sri Lanka [16, 55]. In
response to these deadly attacks, the government declared a state
of emergency, enforced curfews, and blocked access to popular
social media, allegedly to prevent the spread of misinformation
and panic [55, 101]. NetBlocks and AccessNow found seven social
media websites including Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram to
be blocked [70, 101].
Censored Planet detected a large increase in HTTP(S) censorship
(from 0.1 % to 2 %) first on the week of April 21, 2019 (the day of
the attack) for social media content (cf. Figure 7). We observed
22 domains (compared to 7 reported previously) being blocked,
including domains like twitter.com that were not reported. Five out
of these 22 domains were only from the Alexa test list, showing
that variety in test lists is important. After the initial peak, HTTPS

shows (number of countries with upward trend, number of coun-
tries with downward trend). Countries with no statistically signif-
icant trend are excluded. DNS censorship slope for China is not
included, as the value is extremely high (0.93).
• DNS censorship is heavily used in countries like Iran (Fig-
ure 8 trend line slope - 0.048), China (slope - 0.93), and Russia
(slope - 0.003) because of the ease of blocking [8, 9, 38, 41,
78, 85]. Recent reports suggest the export of their censorship
models to more than 100 countries [108] including countries
like Turkmenistan (slope - 0.15), and hence we observe an
overall increase in DNS censorship in 123 countries in total.
• HTTPS censorship also observed an increasing trend. Fully
encrypted traffic has been cited as the reason for decreasing
censorship in the past [7], but new methods for blocking
fully encrypted traffic leads to an increasing number of coun-
tries with higher blocking [100]. The country with the most
increasing HTTPS censorship is Uzbekistan (slope - 0.041).
• Discard measures censorship in one direction (Measure-
ment machine→ Vantage Point). An increase in the observed
rates indicate blocking independent from the direction of
measurement [100, 106]. Countries like Portugal have shown
a high increase in Discard censorship (slope - 0.045).
The increasing trend in multiple censorship methods encourages di-
verse measurements and highlights the importance of a unified plat-
form measuring censorship on multiple protocols synchronously.
7.2.2 Trends in Domains. We analyze trends in the categories of
domains blocked to find whether some type of content is more
increasingly blocked than others.
• News media censorship shows a surprising upward trend.
The countries with the highest increase in news censorship
include Pakistan and Albania.
• Benign categories such as gaming, media sharing, and host-
ing and blogging platforms also experience an upward trend
in addition to sensitive topics like provocative attire and
human rights issues.
The increasing trend in blocking of benign categories highlights the
importance of repetitively testing all types of content for a compre-
hensive picture of global censorship.

weeks across our measurement period. NC–Not Considered.
Freedom on the Net Report. The annual Freedom on the
7.2.3
Net Report provides a qualitative ranking of countries in three
categories (Free, Partly Free, Not Free) [46]. The annual reports have
been used by numerous studies in the past as an authoritative source
to select countries for measurement and to compare results [7, 78, 95,
100, 106]. However, the reports are qualitative and often cover only
a small number of countries. The quantitative results of Censored
Planet extend the insights of this report by significantly increasing
the number of countries covered, and by providing concrete results
on the extent of access limitations. For example, the 2019 Freedom
on the Net report covers only 65 countries which is around 28 % of
the countries tested by Censored Planet. We apply our trend and
censorship analysis to the Freedom House categories (cf. Figure 9):
• Not Free countries have the highest censorship rates, mainly
caused by the restrictive policies of Iran and China [9, 38].
Our results confirm the qualitative assessment.
• Free countries show an upward trend in censorship. Exam-
ples of this are Australia and the United Kingdom [12, 63].
• Not Considered countries also show a non-negligible amount
of censorship and a comparatively more upward trend, which
suggests that the scale of Censored Planet can complement
manually-compiled reports significantly.
7.3 Case Study: Turkmenistan
Turkmenistan, a country that has been ramping up its censorship at
an alarming rate, is ranked second-to-worst in the 2019 Reporters
without Borders Press Freedom Index [89], and was recently in
the limelight for censoring media regarding the COVID-19 pan-
demic [72, 87]. In mid-April 2020, we received requests from a major
circumvention tool to investigate suspected IP blocking of DNS-
over-HTTPS (DoH) servers used by its system in Turkmenistan.
One of these DoH servers was operated by Cloudflare and since
any Cloudflare IP allows users to reach its DoH service, we sus-
pected that all Cloudflare IP addresses were being blocked which
would restrict access to a wide range of services. We used Censored
Planet’s rapid focus capabilities to run custom Augur measurements
in Turkmenistan on April 17 2020, where we tested the reachability

34 vantage points. Our results confirm that all tested Cloudflare IPs
were blocked in at least 18 vantage points. We found interference
in both directions of communication (inbound on anycasted IPs,
outbound on non-anycasted IPs), which primarily took place in
the state-owned AS 20661 (TURKMENTELECOM-AS). This affects
more than 90 % of the public IP address space in Turkmenistan [35].
In addition to the Cloudflare IPs, the DoH server hosted by Snopyta,
a non-profit service provider was also blocked. This rapid focus case
study shows the ability of Censored Planet to run custom measure-
ments or increase scale when investigating censorship events.
8 RELATED WORK
An abundance of work in censorship has focused on exploring
censorship policies in specific countries, either using volunteers or
accessible vantage points inside the country. The Great Firewall
of China and Iran’s censorship regime are two of the most studied
censorship phenomena [8, 9, 13, 26, 30, 38, 61, 113, 116, 121]. Recent
increases in censorship in other countries have also prompted fo-
cused studies, such as in Russia [84, 85], Thailand [47], India [118]
and others [6, 25, 52, 65, 81]. There has also been a long line of work
on measuring Internet shutdowns, which have been increasing in
many countries [31, 53, 96, 112].
Censorship measurement platforms that focus on coverage in
multiple countries have also been proposed. In addition to ICLab [7]
and OONI [104], there are other platforms that have been active
in the past, but few are still active and collect longitudinal data.
Encore [20] induced web clients around the world to perform cross-
origin requests when users visit certain websites, and the approach
has spurred a long line of discussion on the ethics of censorship
measurement [34, 56, 76, 106]. The OpenNet Initiative (ONI) [73]
published several reports on Internet censorship in different coun-
tries before becoming defunct in 2011 [74, 75]. UBICA [4] and
CensMon [95] used distributed PlanetLab nodes [80] and volun-
teer deployments to perform censorship measurements in different
countries, but have not been used longitudinally.
An important component of these censorship measurement stud-
ies is the test list of URLs and several studies have focused on
generating an optimal list of domains for testing [27, 92, 110]. The
literature on censorship circumvention is also rich with work on
both long-standing systems such as Tor [33], and newer systems us-
ing packet manipulation strategies [18, 83, 107], crowdsourcing [67],
and strategies to disguise the destination [42, 49, 114, 115].
9 LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK
Like the remote measurement techniques on which our data is
based, Censored Planet has a few inherent limitations. Even with
our large global coverage, our vantage points are not fine-grained
enough to measure every local instance of censorship, especially
those applied very close to end-users, such as in schools or work-
places. Some of the remote measurement techniques have more
specific technical limitations: some cannot detect unidirectional
blocking (Hyperquack, Quack-Discard) or blocking of domains
that normally are anycasted (Augur), though we note that recent
studies have claimed that it is challenging for censors to block
network traffic in a specific direction, especially at the national
level [77, 100, 106]. Finally, like all previous work [77, 78, 104, 106],
we use off-the-shelf geolocation databases that are known to some-
times be inaccurate. We have used independent data sources to
confirm location accuracy in particularly critical case studies.
We are aware that a sophisticated censor might attempt to block
or evade our techniques, maybe by detecting and dropping traffic
from our machines, or by poisoning probe responses with mislead-
ing data. Due to our control measurements (e.g., testing for benign
domains, and tracking changes in each network’s behavior over
time and across multiple vantage points), Censored Planet can avoid
some of these countermeasures, but not all of them. So far, we have
no reason to believe that any country or network has engaged in
active evasion of Censored Planet measurements in order to hide
censorship, although a few small network prefixes have blacklisted
our probe traffic.
While Censored Planet provides a powerful platform for un-
derstanding censorship phenomena, fully leveraging the data will
require much additional work, including collaboration with in-
country experts and researchers from the social and political sci-
ences and other domains. Further application of methods such as
machine learning and data visualization will undoubtedly expose
more insights from the data. All of these represent opportunities
for future collaboration, both inside and outside computer science,
and are exciting avenues to explore. Our roadmap includes several
features that we hope will facilitate such collaborations. We are
building a Censored Planet search interface and API that provides
interactive queries and integration with other platforms.
10 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we introduced Censored Planet, a global censorship
observatory that overcomes the scale, coverage, and continuity lim-
itations of existing platforms. Using multiple remote measurement
techniques, Censored Planet has collected more than 21 billion data
points over 20 months of operation. We built representative metrics
and time series analysis techniques to discover 15 key censorship
events and analyze trends in censorship methods and censored
content, and we used Censored Planet’s rapid focus capabilities
for case studies of particular censorship events. We hope that Cen-
sored Planet can enhance Internet freedom by helping to bring
transparency to censorship practices and supporting research, tool
development, and advocacy that seeks to protect the human rights
of Internet users around the world.
