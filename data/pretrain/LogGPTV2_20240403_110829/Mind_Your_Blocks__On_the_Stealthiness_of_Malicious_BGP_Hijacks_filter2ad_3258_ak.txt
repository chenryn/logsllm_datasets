We also mined archives of the NANOG [7] and RIPE
Working Groups [9] mailing lists for public reports related
to ASes or IP address blocks identiﬁed in our hijacks. We
found only one thread [4] reporting the hijack of the block
91.220.85.0/24 and its legitimate BGP origin AS51888 via the
invalid direct upstream provider AS42989.
We further observed that the 64 hijacked IP address blocks
were advertised from only seven invalid distinct BGP ori-
gin ASes (preﬁx hijacks) and via only three invalid distinct
upstream ASes (AS hijacks). Based on this observation we
used the archived routing information bases (RIBs) from
RouteViews and RIPE RIS to extract all IP address ranges
originated by the same seven invalid BGP origin ASes or
advertised via the same three invalid upstream provider ASes
during the same 18 month time period. Surprisingly no less
than 2,591 additional IP ranges were uncovered, all of them
matching the exact same hijack signature as the other 64 IP
address blocks. While we observed spam coming from the 64
hijacked IP address ranges identiﬁed by our system, we did not
ﬁnd any spam sent from the new 2,591 ranges in our spamtrap
logs. In the remainder of this section we thus investigate a total
of 2,655 IP address ranges supposedly hijacked between
January 2013 and June 2014.
Figure 4 shows the distribution of the 2,655 observed
hijacks across time. We can see that 95.3% of the observed
hijacks have occurred after July 2013. From that point the
distribution becomes almost uniform, showing that hijacks
were performed on a regular basis for more than one year.
With an average of 4.82 hijacks per day, we note that BGP
hijacks have been an ongoing and recurring threat in the past
18 months (and possibly before or after).
We now focus on another key characteristic of the identiﬁed
hijacks: their duration. In [35] Ramachandran et al. report
on spam coming from IP preﬁxes involved in BGP routing
announcements lasting less than one day. In our case, 85.5%
lasted less than one day, from 29 minutes to 23 hours 47
minutes, 94.6% lasted no more than 2 days and 98.7% lasted
no more than one week. A large fraction of hijacks are thus

that records are purged when the cases are considered to be solved.

similar in duration to those reported in [35], i.e., less than one
day. All in all the majority of hijacks are rather short-lived.
Additionally, 1.3% of hijacks are long-lived, i.e., lasted more
than one week in our observations, with a maximum duration
of 8 months and 20 days.
Though short-lived and long-lived hijacks share some
characteristics, we consider them to be due to two distinct
phenomena. In fact, short-lived hijacks can be used by an
attacker to circumvent traceback and avoid blacklisting by
hopping between IP addresses in a range until the range itself
gets blacklisted and then move to another range. Long-lived
hijacks however make it harder for the attacker to remain
undetected. We prove this later when checking the list of
hijacked IP address ranges against several blacklists. Such
long-lived hijacks have already been observed in the wild,
for instance in 2011 a couple of IP preﬁxes belonging to
the company Link Telecom were hijacked for 5 months and
used to perform various malicious activities such as sending
spam and hosting services but also exploiting remote hosts and
originating suspicious IRC trafﬁc [39].
In the remainder of this Section we investigate short-lived
(≤ 1 week) and long-lived (> 1 week) hijacks separately to
