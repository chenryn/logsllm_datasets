We also mined the archives of the NANOG [7] and RIPE Working Groups [9] mailing lists for public reports related to Autonomous Systems (ASes) or IP address blocks identified in our hijack incidents. We found only one thread [4] reporting the hijack of the 91.220.85.0/24 block, with its legitimate BGP origin AS51888 being rerouted through the invalid direct upstream provider AS42989.

Our analysis further revealed that the 64 hijacked IP address blocks were advertised from only seven distinct, invalid BGP origin ASes (prefix hijacks) and via only three distinct, invalid upstream ASes (AS hijacks). Based on this observation, we used archived routing information bases (RIBs) from RouteViews and RIPE RIS to extract all IP address ranges originated by the same seven invalid BGP origin ASes or advertised via the same three invalid upstream provider ASes during the same 18-month period. Surprisingly, we uncovered an additional 2,591 IP ranges, all matching the exact same hijack signature as the initial 64 IP address blocks. While spam was observed from the 64 hijacked IP address ranges identified by our system, no spam was detected from the new 2,591 ranges in our spamtrap logs. Therefore, we investigate a total of 2,655 IP address ranges, supposedly hijacked between January 2013 and June 2014.

Figure 4 illustrates the distribution of the 2,655 observed hijacks over time. It is evident that 95.3% of the hijacks occurred after July 2013, with the distribution becoming almost uniform thereafter, indicating that hijacks were carried out regularly for over a year. With an average of 4.82 hijacks per day, it is clear that BGP hijacks have been a persistent and recurring threat over the past 18 months, and possibly beyond.

Next, we focus on another key characteristic of the identified hijacks: their duration. In [35], Ramachandran et al. reported on spam originating from IP prefixes involved in BGP routing announcements lasting less than one day. In our case, 85.5% of the hijacks lasted less than one day, ranging from 29 minutes to 23 hours and 47 minutes. Additionally, 94.6% lasted no more than two days, and 98.7% lasted no more than one week. Thus, a large fraction of hijacks are similar in duration to those reported in [35], i.e., less than one day, making the majority of hijacks relatively short-lived. However, 1.3% of hijacks were long-lived, lasting more than one week, with the longest duration being 8 months and 20 days.

Although short-lived and long-lived hijacks share some characteristics, we consider them to be the result of two distinct phenomena. Short-lived hijacks can be used by attackers to evade traceback and avoid blacklisting by frequently switching between IP addresses within a range until the range itself is blacklisted, at which point they move to another range. In contrast, long-lived hijacks make it more difficult for attackers to remain undetected. This is supported by our later checks against various blacklists. Long-lived hijacks have been observed in the wild, such as in 2011 when several IP prefixes belonging to Link Telecom were hijacked for 5 months and used for malicious activities, including spam, hosting services, exploiting remote hosts, and generating suspicious IRC traffic [39].

In the remainder of this section, we will separately investigate short-lived (â‰¤ 1 week) and long-lived (> 1 week) hijacks to better understand their unique characteristics and implications.
