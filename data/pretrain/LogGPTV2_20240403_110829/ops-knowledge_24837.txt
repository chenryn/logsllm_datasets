User: I installed Python Anaconda on Mac (OS Mavericks). I wanted to revert to the default version of Python on my Mac. What's the best way to do this? Should I delete the ~/anaconda directory? Any other changes required? 
Currently when I run which python I get this path:
/Users/username/anaconda/bin/python
Assistant: To uninstall Anaconda Fully from your System :

Open Terminal 
rm -rf ~/miniconda
rm -rf ~/.condarc ~/.conda ~/.continuum
