To revert to the default version of Python on your Mac after installing Anaconda, follow these steps:

1. **Uninstall Anaconda:**
   - Open Terminal.
   - Remove the Anaconda installation directory:
     ```sh
     rm -rf ~/anaconda
     ```
   - Additionally, remove any configuration files and directories related to Anaconda:
     ```sh
     rm -rf ~/.condarc ~/.conda ~/.continuum
     ```

2. **Update Your Shell Configuration:**
   - If you added Anaconda to your shell configuration (e.g., `.bash_profile`, `.zshrc`, or `.bashrc`), you need to remove the lines that update your `PATH` to include Anaconda. Open your shell configuration file in a text editor:
     ```sh
     open -e ~/.bash_profile  # or .zshrc, .bashrc, etc.
     ```
   - Look for lines similar to the following and remove them:
     ```sh
     export PATH="/Users/username/anaconda/bin:$PATH"
     ```

3. **Verify the Default Python Version:**
   - After removing Anaconda and updating your `PATH`, you can verify that your system is using the default Python by running:
     ```sh
     which python
     ```
   - This should return the path to the default Python installation, typically something like:
     ```sh
     /usr/bin/python
     ```

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully revert to the default version of Python on your Mac.
