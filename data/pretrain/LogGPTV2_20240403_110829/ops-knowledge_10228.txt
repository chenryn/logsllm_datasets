User: Write a Python script to connect to the remote server through ssh, and get the file names and modification times of all files in the specified directory.
Assistant: The following is a Python script that can use the paramiko library to connect to a remote server and obtain the file names and modification times of all files in the specified directory: ```python import paramiko import os # remote server IP ip = "your_ip_address" # remote server username and password username = "your_username" password = "your_password" # Remote server directory to be queried remote_path = "/path/to/remote/directory" # Establish ssh connection ssh = paramiko.SSHClient() ssh.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy()) ssh .connect(hostname=ip, username=username, password=password) # Execute the ls command to get all file names and modification times in the directory stdin, stdout, stderr = ssh.exec_command("ls -la --full-time " + remote_path) files_info = stdout.read().decode("utf-8").split("\n")[1:-1] # Output the file name and modification time to the local console for file_info in files_info: file_info_list = file_info. split() # The file type is not d (directory) if file_info_list[0][0] != "d": print("File name:", file_info_list[-1]) print("Modification time:", file_info_list[- 2]) # Close the ssh connection ssh.close() ``` When using it, you need to replace the following content with your own content: - `ip`: remote server IP; - `username`: remote server username; - `password` : remote server password; - `remote_path`: directory to be queried. Before using the script, you need to ensure that the paramiko library has been installed locally. You can use the following command to install it: ``` pip install paramiko ```
