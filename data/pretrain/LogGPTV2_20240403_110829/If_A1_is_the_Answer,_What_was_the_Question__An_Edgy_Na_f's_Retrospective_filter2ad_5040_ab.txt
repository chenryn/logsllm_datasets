### Task Force on Safeguarding Classified Information

The primary objective was to study and recommend both hardware and software safeguards that would effectively protect classified information in multi-access, resource-sharing computer systems. Willis Ware of the RAND Corporation was appointed as the chair of the Task Force under the authority of the Defense Science Board, and the first meeting was held in October.

The Task Force and its panels included several future security visionaries and colleagues, such as E.L. (Ted) Glaser, Pat Haverty, Art Bushkin, Bob Mosier, Jerry Moskowitz, Larry Roberts, Bob von Buelow, Roy McCabe, Barry Wessler, James P. Anderson, Ed Bensley, Dan Edwards, Jerry Saltzer, Hilda Faust [later Mathieu], Bob Balzer, and Clark Weissman. 

### The Landmark Report

Their landmark report, "Security Controls for Computer Systems" [27], was published as a classified CONFIDENTIAL RAND report in February 1970. Despite its continued relevance, the report's findings were not widely disseminated at the time due to its classification. 

#### Representation and Impact
SDC was well-represented on the Task Force by Mosier, von Buelow, McCabe, and Weissman, which ultimately benefited my education in computer security. In the preface to the publicly reissued version of the report, Ware stated: "At that time, it was felt that because representatives from government agencies participated in the work of the Task Force, the information in the report would appear to be of an official nature, suggestive of the policies and guidelines that would eventually be established. Consequently, it was felt prudent to classify the report CONFIDENTIAL overall…."

### Key Findings of the Ware Report

1. **Security Risks and Vulnerabilities:**
   - The report detailed the nature of security vulnerabilities, including hardware and software failures, emanations, wiretaps, crosstalk, sabotage by operators, maintenance staff, systems programmers, and subtle software modifications by users.
   - It also identified the difficulty of securing a computer system, especially in environments ranging from local-access batch to remote-access time-shared systems.

2. **Challenges of Security Controls:**
   - The report considered the complexity of security controls across various processing environments, from the most easily controlled (local-access batch) to the most difficult (remote-access time-shared systems).
   - It addressed the increasing user capability and the complexity of security controls, from template-based file query systems to full-programming capabilities.

3. **Access Control Policy:**
   - Specifics of access control policy were based on system-confirmed authentication of the user’s identity and clearance, the clearance of the facility, and the clearances of designated output devices.

4. **Adaptive Access Control Policies:**
   - The report highlighted the need for adaptive access control policies in the face of degraded operation or national emergency, and discussed the costs, both financial and mission-specific, of implementing these controls.

5. **Hardware and Software Integration:**
   - Hardware and software were to provide isolation from user programs, including the audit trail. The emerging design of Multics was used as an example of how this could be reliably achieved.

6. **Necessary Hardware Features:**
   - Specific hardware features, such as a supervisor state and a user state, program isolation mechanisms, and machine fault detection, were identified as necessary for access control.

7. **Operating System Complexity:**
   - The report recognized that operating system complexity was an impediment to proving the correctness of the design and implementation. To address this, it called for detailed documentation and flowcharts of the modules on which access control was based.

8. **Penetration Testing:**
   - Periodic penetration testing was required, with some tests to be conducted by outside personnel not connected with the design or implementation of the system.

### Development of Secure Systems

The technical recommendations in the Ware Report came from the research community. Many ideas, including segmented virtual memory and privilege states, are reflected in the Task Force’s conclusions. Two significant systems developed as a result of the Task Force’s work were the refined security design of Multics at MIT and the multilevel time-sharing system ADEPT-50 at SDC.

#### Multics

The Multics project introduced several security principles to the technology. Designed as a collaboration between MIT, General Electric, and Bell Labs, the system ran on a modified GE 635 computer, renamed the GE 645. Key contributors included Fernando “Corby” Corbató, Ed Vance, Vic Vyssotsky, Peter Neumann, Jerry Saltzer, Ted Glaser, Butler Lampson, Tom Van Vleck, and Charlie Clingen. The system incorporated concepts like segmented virtual memory, protection and privilege rings, and modular design with least privilege.

#### ADEPT-50

In 1966, ARPA awarded a contract to SDC to implement a Time Shared Database Management System (TDMS) on an IBM S/360 model 50 computer. The underlying operating system reflected a multilevel security design created by Clark Weissman. In 1967, Weissman asked me to prepare a formal mathematical interpretation of the military security policy-based model described in the Ware Report. This model addressed clearance, compartments/categories, franchise (specific permissions), and need-to-know for authenticated users, implementing a dynamic user-specific High Water-Mark (HWM) access policy.

### The Anderson Report

In 1972, the U.S. Air Force awarded a contract to the James P. Anderson Company to produce a computer security planning study. A panel of experts, chaired by E.L. “Ted” Glaser, met between February and September 1972 to produce an UNCLASSIFIED two-volume report [2]. Additional participants included Eldred Nelson, Bruce Peters, Dan Edwards, Hilda Faust, Steve Lipner, Roger Schell, Clark Weissman, and Chuck Rose. The Anderson Report outlined a sound approach to the development of multiuser multilevel computer systems, emphasizing the use of formalisms in addressing controlled sharing through an access control policy model.

### Conclusion

The contributions of the Ware Report and the Anderson Report laid the foundation for modern computer security practices. Their emphasis on formal models, detailed documentation, and the integration of hardware and software safeguards continue to be relevant today.
