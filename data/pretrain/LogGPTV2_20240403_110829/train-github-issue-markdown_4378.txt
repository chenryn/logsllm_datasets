**Error Summary:**

1. **Deprecation Warning for `set` Constructor:**
   - **File:** `/home/fesun/.cache/bazel/_bazel_fesun/c44abb322eef8ca1d3dd1c34fcda8c3a/external/io_bazel_rules_closure/closure/private/defs.bzl`
   - **Line:** 27
   - **Message:** The `set` constructor for `depsets` is deprecated and will be removed. Use the `depset` constructor instead. You can temporarily enable the deprecated `set` constructor by passing the flag `--incompatible_disallow_set_constructor=false`.

2. **Package Loading Errors:**
   - **File:** `closure/private/defs.bzl`
   - **Message:** The extension file `closure/private/defs.bzl` contains errors.

**Debugging Steps:**

- I added the flag `--incompatible_disallow_set_constructor=false` to all Bazel command calls. After this, the following debug messages were observed:

  1. **Attribute Renaming in `pkg_tar`:**
     - **File:** `/home/fesun/.cache/bazel/_bazel_fesun/c44abb322eef8ca1d3dd1c34fcda8c3a/external/bazel_tools/tools/build_defs/pkg/pkg.bzl`
     - **Line:** 197
     - **Targets Affected:**
       - `@//tensorflow/tools/lib_package:libtensorflow_jni`
       - `@//tensorflow/tools/lib_package:cheaders`
       - `@//tensorflow/tools/lib_package:clib`
       - `@//tensorflow/tools/lib_package:clicenses`
     - **Message:** The `files` attribute in `pkg_tar` has been renamed to `srcs`. Consider renaming it in your `BUILD` file.

  2. **Duplicated Key Error:**
     - **File:** `/home/fesun/tensorflow/tensorflow/core/kernels/BUILD`
     - **Line:** 59
     - **Message:** Duplicated key "define" when creating the dictionary.
     - **Code Snippet:**
       ```python
       config_setting(
           name = "xsmm_backward",
           values = {"define": "tensorflow_xsmm=1", "define": "tensorflow_xsmm_backward=1"}
       )
       ```
     - **Error:** The `values` dictionary contains a duplicated key `"define"`.

**Errors:**

- **Package Loading Errors:**
  - **Package:** `tensorflow/core/kernels`
  - **Message:** The package `tensorflow/core/kernels` contains errors.

**Solution Request:**

I am looking for a solution to address these issues. Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.
