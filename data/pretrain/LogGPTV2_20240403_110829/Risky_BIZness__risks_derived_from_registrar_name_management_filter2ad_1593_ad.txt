#### Figure 3: New Hijackable Domains per Month (April 2011 to September 2020)
This figure illustrates the number of new hijackable domains discovered each month from April 2011 to September 2020.

#### Figure 5: Scatter Plot of Delegated Domains and Hijack Value
This scatter plot shows the relationship between the number of domains delegated (capped at 1,000) and the hijack value of both hijackable and hijacked sacrificial nameservers. The x-axis is on a log scale, and the y-axis is capped at 1,000 domain delegations for clarity. The data indicates that hijackers tend to register sacrificial nameservers with the highest hijack value and the largest number of delegated domains.

#### Figure 4: New Hijacked Domains per Month (April 2011 to September 2020)
This figure illustrates the number of new hijacked domains discovered each month from April 2011 to September 2020.

### Hijack Value Calculation
The hijack value of a sacrificial nameserver is calculated as the sum of the days during which domains delegated to it were hijackable. For example, if a sacrificial nameserver has one domain delegated to it for 30 days and another for 50 days, the hijack value is 80 days.

### Time to Exploit
We next characterize the speed at which hijackers exploit sacrificial nameservers. For each hijacked sacrificial nameserver, we count the number of days from its creation until it was registered. Figure 6 shows the distribution of these counts using two CDFs. The bottom CDF represents the time to exploit for sacrificial nameservers, while the top CDF represents the time to exploit for their associated domains. The results indicate that hijackers move quickly: 50% of vulnerable domains are hijacked within 5 days of a sacrificial nameserver's creation, and more than 70% within a month. This rapid turnaround suggests that hijackers routinely monitor for these opportunities and exploit them promptly.

Moreover, the comparison of the two CDFs highlights that hijackers are selective when registering sacrificial nameservers. The most valuable sacrificial nameservers are those associated with many domains, and this difference is reflected in the CDFs: the CDF for sacrificial nameservers shows a longer time to exploit compared to the CDF for their associated domains. For instance, while 50% of vulnerable domains are registered within a week, only 35% of sacrificial nameservers are registered in the same timeframe.

### Duration of Hijacking
Finally, we examine the durations for which domains are hijacked, revealing interesting hijacking behaviors. Figure 7 compares the durations for which domains are hijacked with the durations they are hijackable. The green and red curves show the CDFs of the number of days for which domains were at risk of being hijacked: the green CDF for domains that were never hijacked, and the red CDF for domains that were hijacked at least once. For hijacked domains, the blue CDF shows the number of days for which they were hijacked.

Comparing the green and red CDFs indicates that hijackers select domains that are hijackable for longer durations. For non-hijacked domains, 15% are hijackable for less than a week, whereas 15% of hijacked domains are hijackable for a month. The steps in the curve for hijacked domains correspond to domain registrations expiring after one and two years: 10% of hijacked domains are hijacked for one year, and 5% for two years, after which they are not renewed. This suggests that hijackers are sensitive to the return on investment, particularly the cost of registering the sacrificial domain name.

### Nature of Hijacked Domains
Examining the nature of hijacked domains can provide insights into the hijackers' intent. Most hijacked domains are completely delegated to a hijacked nameserver, providing the hijacker complete control over the domain's resolution. However, this also means the domain likely loses all nameservice during the transition. These "fully hijacked" domains are often unpopular or moribund and not in regular use. We believe the most prolific hijackers treat these domains primarily as a source of cheap traffic or reputation. As of September 11, 2020, only about 500 domains on the Alexa Top 1M list were hijackable at some point before September 2020 due to renaming.

### Characterizing Hijackers
Sacrificial nameservers are clearly being registered to hijack the domains that delegate to them. To explore the use of hijacked domains, we conducted a controlled experiment and analyzed bulk hijackers.

#### Controlled Experiment
We registered five sacrificial nameserver domains without issue and confirmed that we observed incoming queries for these domains, including unexpected queries for .edu and .gov domains. This revealed that the renaming operation affects all TLDs managed on the same shared EPP repository of a registry. We then updated our infrastructure to respond to queries for a hijackable .edu domain but only for queries from a /24 network we controlled, confirming that we could truly hijack resolution for a restricted TLD domain.

#### Bulk Hijackers
Bulk hijackers often use hijacked domains to host traditional parking sites or redirect to other monetization strategies. Table 4 shows the most popular controlling nameserver domains over the course of our study. Manually visiting these domains in September 2020 confirmed our hypothesis about their underlying motivation. The most prevalent use is to host parking sites with topic links designed to drive low-quality advertising clicks. For example, sacrificial nameservers controlled by mpower.nl direct their domains in this manner. A mass monetization strategy is offered by phonesear.ch, which uses its thousands of hijacked domains to support an SEO strategy for attracting traffic, monetizing visitors via an affiliate relationship with Spokeo.

### Notification and Remediation
Beginning in September 2020, we initiated a broad outreach effort to communicate our findings to the registrar community. The goals were to remediate affected domains and prevent new domains from being exposed. There was considerable surprise and concern, leading to various efforts to address the issue. We assess the impact of these actions, characterizing the remediation of existing hijackable domains and the effects of new renaming practices on the creation of new hijackable domains. Finally, we propose potential modifications to the EPP standard and registrar operational practices to form a more robust permanent solution.
