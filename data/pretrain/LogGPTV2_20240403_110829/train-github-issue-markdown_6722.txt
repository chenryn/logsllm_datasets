When I provide `dataSource` values in form of array with objects instead of
strings with duplicated `text` values, for example:
    [
      { text: 'Some Text', value: {someFirstValue} },
      { text: 'Some Text', value: {someSecondValue} }
    ]
`AutoComplete` component renders only one item in `Menu` because Menu children
keys are not unique. It also logs a React error with `flattenChildren(...)`
warning.
I know that providing duplicated `text` values to `dataSource` is not
something normal but I believe that it should be possible. For example I
discovered this bug when trying to implement `AutoComplete` for searching for
Facebook fanpages, there could be several fanpages with the same name and I
would like to show them all in `Menu` and provide some additional context for
helping user to find desired fanpage. By additional context I mean something
like id, photo, maybe link to fanpage.
I've tracked down fragment of `AutoComplete` component code that causes this
error link:
    if (typeof request.text === 'string') {
      return React.cloneElement(request.value, {
        key: request.text,
        disableFocusRipple: this.props.disableFocusRipple,
      });
    }
And I would be more than happy to provide a PR with fix.
