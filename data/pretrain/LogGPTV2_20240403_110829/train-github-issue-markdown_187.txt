I am currently developing an extension that utilizes an output channel to display live logs from an Azure Website via the Kudu APIs. At present, the HTTP request for the log stream will only terminate after a 20-minute timeout set by the API service. 

To improve this, I would like to implement an `onHide` event for the `outputChannel`. This way, when the user hides or closes the output channel, the request would stop processing. This approach would prevent further messages from being pushed into the channel when it is not visible, and the user could simply re-invoke the extension to start receiving new log messages again.

This enhancement would provide a more efficient and user-friendly experience.
