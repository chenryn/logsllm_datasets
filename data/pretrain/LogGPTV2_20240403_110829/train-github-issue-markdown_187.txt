I am currently in the process of writing an extension that uses an output
channel that is outputting live logs from an Azure Website from their Kudu
APIs.
Currently the only way that the HTTP request will end is when the logstream
API service times out after 20 minutes, I would much prefer to have the
`outputChannel` have an event for `onHide` so that when the user hides/closes
the outputChannel that the request stops processing, rather than further
messages being pushed into it when it is not visible & that the user will need
to re-invoke the extension to get new log messages
