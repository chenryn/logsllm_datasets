The mathtext rendered in the 1.3.1 release does't work with the bundled
pyparsing.py module (1.5.0).
Simply installing the latest version of the pyparsing.py module with easy
install doesn't work. It does if the matplotlib\pyparsing.py file is
overvritten with the newer version (2.0.1).
I don't know why the pyparsing.py module comes with the matplotlib source, but
it could be useful to provide an option to allow using that installed
manually.
Thank you!
