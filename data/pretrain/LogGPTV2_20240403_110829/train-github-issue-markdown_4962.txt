In the 1.3.1 release, the mathtext rendering is incompatible with the bundled `pyparsing.py` module (version 1.5.0). Simply upgrading to the latest version of `pyparsing.py` using `easy_install` does not resolve the issue. However, overwriting the `matplotlib\pyparsing.py` file with the newer version (2.0.1) does fix the problem.

It is unclear why `pyparsing.py` is included in the matplotlib source distribution. It would be beneficial to provide an option that allows users to utilize a manually installed version of `pyparsing.py`.

Thank you!
