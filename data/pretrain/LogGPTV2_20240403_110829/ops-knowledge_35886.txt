Log in as a new user: ``` ssh [username]@[IP] ``` Among them, [username] is the username of the new user, [IP ] is the IP address of the Linux system. 8. Modify the permissions of the new user: ``` sudo visudo ``` will open the /etc/sudoers file, which is used to manage sudo permissions. 9.

Now that the new user has been successfully created and has sudo privileges, you can use the sudo command to perform operations that require administrator privileges.
