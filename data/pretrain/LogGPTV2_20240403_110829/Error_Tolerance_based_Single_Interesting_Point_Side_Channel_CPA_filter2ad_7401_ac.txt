We randomly select 200 power traces from a total number

The parameter k
is also set to 2000 so that all time sam-
ples are in the time sample threshold. Then, we have statis-
tics on the distribution of correlation coeﬃcients correspond-
ing to the correct key and divide the correlation coeﬃcients
into three thresholds( greater than 0.2, greater than 0.3 and
greater than 0.35). We calculate the average number of time
samples for each threshold k(= T H). Finally, we obtain
three correlation coeﬃcient thresholds 21, 71 and 218 (as
shown in Figure 10).
The frequency of each interesting point are shown in Fig-
ure 11. The extracted time samples are located in regions
with high correlation coeﬃcients, which indicates that our
SIP-CPA accurately extracts interesting points. The accu-
racy of frequency based interesting points selection can be
improved by appropriately increasing the threshold k.
The sorted frequencies of all interesting points are shown
in Figure 12. The number of interesting points with high-
est frequencies is 1, 6 and 49 if the correlation coeﬃcient
threshold k are set to 21, 71 and 218 respectively . The
total number of successful repetitions is 104 and the corre-
sponding frequency is 85,103 and 104 respectively (as shown
in Figure 12). These interesting points are not necessarily
in the same clock cycle. We can still use the mean of corre-
lation coeﬃcients of them to perform SIP-CPA.
We only use the ﬁrst 200 power traces from a total number

By using the interesting points with highest frequencies
in Figure 12, our SIP-CPA is performed. With diﬀerent
number of power traces being used, the ﬁrst order success
rate are shown in Figure 13. We randomly select 200 power
traces from a total number of 5000 and repeat the operation
200 times. The ﬁrst order success rate is about 0.74.
In order to get a success rate of 0.74, our SIP-CPA only
needs about 85 power traces. That’s to say, our SIP-CPA
saves about 57.5% power traces. Our SIP-CPA can achieve
success rate about 99% when about 140 power traces are
used. However, the success rate is only about 30% when
about average 140 power traces are used.
The average guessing entropy of CPA is 32.65 when 10
power traces are used (as shown in Figure 14). The guess-
ing entropy of our SIP-CPA is only 21.41, 23.38 and 23.89
respectively when the same number of power traces are used.
With the increase number of power traces, guessing entropy
of CPA declines slowly. When 60 power traces are used, the

guessing entropy of CPA drops to 20.7. The guessing en-
tropy of our SIP-CPA drops to about 4.23 if the correlation
coeﬃcient threshold k is set to 21, 71 or 218. When aver-
age 140 power traces are used, the guessing entropy of CPA
is equal to 6.42. The guessing entropy of our SIP-CPA is
smaller than 6 when more than 50 power traces are used.
Both success rate and guessing entropy of our SIP-CPA
are very similar under the three correlation coeﬃcient thresh-
olds 21, 71 and 218. The success rate will not signiﬁcantly
increase if we choose a larger threshold k. The attacker can
consider using fewer interesting points to achieve the same
success rate.
We get a conclusion that our SIP-CPA can signiﬁcantly
improve the eﬃciency of traditional CPA from the above two
experiments on AES algorithm implemented on an AT 89S52
single chip and DES algorithm implemented on SASEBO.
5. CONCLUSION
It’s diﬃcult for the attacker to accurately choose interest-
ing points to enhance traditional CPA if he only has a small
number of power traces. To solve this problem, we propose
a Frequency based Interesting Points Selection algorithm
(FIPS) in this paper. Moreover, We propose an error tol-
erant Single Interesting Point based CPA (SIP-CPA) com-
bined with our FIPS to enhance CPA. Experimental results
on AES implemented on an AT 89S52 single chip and DES
algorithm implemented on SASEBO show that our SIP-CPA
can signiﬁcantly improve the eﬃciency of CPA.
