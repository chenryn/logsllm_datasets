Hi,  
I like typesctipt a lot and recently I updated my compiler to version 1.6.  
I have some classes that were "abstract" and now I want to use the new keywork
`abstract`  
My question is as follow:  
In order to scope the ``this` variable I used the following type of methods
when calling them from JQuary/Angular promise:
    export class SomeClass {
        public handleCallback = () => { 
            this.whatEver();
            //... 
        }
    }
This will make sure that if I use this callback for an async operation the
`this` variable will be correct.  
How do I the same with abstract classes since I can't specify an abstract
property?
