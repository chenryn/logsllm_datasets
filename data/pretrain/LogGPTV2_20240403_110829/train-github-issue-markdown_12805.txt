### Issue with `app.test_client()` in a Multi-Threaded Environment

When using `app.test_client()` in a multi-threaded environment, the following code will fail:

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
from flask import Flask, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/info")
def info():
    return jsonify({"status": "success"})

app.testing = True

with app.test_client() as client:
    def check(*args):
        return client.get("/info")

    with ThreadPoolExecutor(5) as tpe:
        print(list(tpe.map(check, range(5))))
```

#### Error Traceback

The error traceback is as follows:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/X/.pyenv/versions/flow-venv-3.9/lib/python3.9/site-packages/flask/ctx.py", line 399, in pop
    self.app.do_teardown_request(exc)
  File "/Users/X/.pyenv/versions/flow-venv-3.9/lib/python3.9/site-packages/flask/app.py", line 2370, in do_teardown_request
    for name in chain(request.blueprints, (None,)):
  File "/Users/X/.pyenv/versions/flow-venv-3.9/lib/python3.9/site-packages/werkzeug/local.py", line 316, in __get__
    obj = instance._get_current_object()  # type: ignore[misc]
  File "/Users/X/.pyenv/versions/flow-venv-3.9/lib/python3.9/site-packages/werkzeug/local.py", line 513, in _get_current_object
    raise RuntimeError(unbound_message) from None
RuntimeError: Working outside of request context.
```

#### Analysis

The error occurs because `app.test_client()` is not designed to handle multiple threads simultaneously. Each thread tries to access the request context, which is not properly managed in this setup, leading to the `RuntimeError`.

#### Potential Solution

One possible solution is to run the Flask application in standalone mode, as described in [this blog post](http://www.prschmid.com/2013/01/multi-threaded-unit-test-for-flask-rest.html). However, this approach has some drawbacks:

- **Manual Error Handling:** You need to implement custom error handling, which can be cumbersome.
- **Lack of Proper Tracebacks:** The tracebacks during testing may not be as informative.
- **Code Coverage:** Code coverage metrics may not be accurately captured.

#### Conclusion

While running the Flask application in standalone mode can resolve the issue, it introduces additional complexity and potential loss of testing benefits. A more robust solution would be to ensure that the `app.test_client()` is used in a way that is compatible with multi-threading, or to find an alternative testing strategy that maintains the integrity of the request context.
