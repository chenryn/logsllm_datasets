User: Please describe the role of PXE in IT operation and maintenance, and provide a method for building a PXE server
Assistant: PXE stands for Preboot eXecution Environment, which is a technology to start the computer operating system through the network. In IT operation and maintenance, the role of PXE is mainly to facilitate administrators to remotely install and deploy operating systems, software programs and patches, and it can also be used to diagnose and restore system failures. The method of setting up a PXE server is as follows: 1. Install the PXE server software, commonly used are TFTP Server, ISC DHCP Server, and Syslinux. 2. Configure the TFTP server, and put the system boot files and operating system images into the root directory specified by the TFTP server. 3. Configure the ISC DHCP Server, start the DHCP service and specify the IP address of the PXE server, the IP address of the TFTP server, and the name of the startup file. 4. Configure the PXE boot file. Use Syslinux to make a PXE boot file (such as pxelinux.0), and put it into the root directory of the TFTP Server. 5. Boot the target computer and select PXE from the boot device list in the BIOS setup. In this way, when the target computer selects PXE boot at startup, it will connect to the PXE server and obtain files such as the operating system image, and finally complete the operating system installation.
