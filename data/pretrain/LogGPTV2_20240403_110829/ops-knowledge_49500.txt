User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Exchange 2010 Online Archive Not Showing Up in Outlook 2010 I currently activated the Online Archive feature for Exchange 2010 but for some reason it won't show up for Exchange users using Outlook 2010 client.  If I log into OWA, it will appear there but not in Outlook 2010 client.  How exactly do you activate this feature to appear for Outlook client users?  I've read somewhere that you need a VLK version of Outlook 2010 and not a retail/OEM copy.  Is this true?

Can you guys recommend some troubleshooting steps on how to resolve this issue?  Autodiscovery is working fine to my current knowledge.

Thanks in advance,

-- UPDATE --
I found my answer to my problem.  The client PC isn't registered on Active Directory and also because Office Pro Plus isn't installed either.  I hope you guys find this useful.

Assistant: The solution we found was to edit the "Full Access Permission" on the affected mailbox, delete the "NT Authority\Self" entry, save that, then readd the same "SELF" entry and restart Outlook about 5 times.
