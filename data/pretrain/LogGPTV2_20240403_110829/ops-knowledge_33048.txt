User: Am trying to implement retries in one of my celery tasks which works fine on my local development environment but doesn't execute retries when deployed to AWS beanstalk.
Assistant: Knoob mistake:
Turns out that I had another environment with similar code consuming from the same rabbitMQ server. Seems this other environment was picking up the retries.
