I was attempting to implement retries for one of my Celery tasks. The retries worked as expected in my local development environment, but they did not execute when the application was deployed to AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

Upon further investigation, I discovered that the issue was due to another environment running similar code and consuming messages from the same RabbitMQ server. This other environment was inadvertently picking up the retry messages, causing the retries to fail in the intended environment.

To resolve this, I need to ensure that each environment is configured to use a separate RabbitMQ queue or server, or implement a more robust message routing mechanism to prevent such conflicts.
