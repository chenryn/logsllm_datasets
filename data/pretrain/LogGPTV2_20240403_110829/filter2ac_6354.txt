**ATT&CK ID:** T0839  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Module Firmware

Adversaries may install malicious or vulnerable firmware onto modular hardware components. Many control system devices incorporate modular hardware, which often has its own distinct firmware that is separate from the main control system's firmware. This technique allows attackers to compromise the functionality and security of these modular components, potentially leading to broader system vulnerabilities.
