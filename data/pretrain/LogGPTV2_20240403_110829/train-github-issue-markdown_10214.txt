Hey,  
So I'm a fairly new developer who had a working app until version v0.14.8, and
just updated to v15.0.1 today. The update did remove a few errors/warnings I
was struggling with (so a great relief there), but brought up this issue.
Specifically, the app itself renders fine, with all the pages looking fine
(all components, text, etc. in the right places), but is just "frozen" -
completely non-functional, not allowing me to click on anything etc.
The error message I see are as follows (from Chrome and Firefox):

I back-tracked it to where I could and found this being the part where the
"node" is coming off as null:

So I have absolutely no clue what's going on and there seems to be no hint as
to what exactly is causing this issue. I will try ripping the app apart and do
a thorough debugging, but wouldn't expect much from it (due to my
unfamiliarity with development yet...).  
I really really appreciate the help in advance, and hope that this problem can
contribute somewhat to improving the React ecosystem!
