Hack the crimeware
Got a link
• http://pastie.org/pastes/888690 from 
www.malwaredomainlist.com
Its features
From the pastie link, it includes the following features:
•
It is undetectable from anti-virus scanner
•
Obfuscate the PDF payload randomly
•
Checking whether the domain is on the blacklist
•
Prevent Wepatweb, Jsunpack and other Javascript unpackers to decode 
the page.
•
To guarantee high level of penetration and successful exploit, it could offer 
various exploits, which are shown below:
– Adobe Acrobat Reader Exploits (including CVE-2010-0188) 
– JRE (GSB & SERIALIZE) 
– MDAC (IE) 
– MS09-032 (IE)

Aha … I love the evil feeling
