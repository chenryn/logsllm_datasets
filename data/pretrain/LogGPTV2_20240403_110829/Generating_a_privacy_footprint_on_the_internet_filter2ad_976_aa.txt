ABSTRACT
As a follow up to characterizing traﬃc deemed as unwanted
by Web clients such as advertisements, we examine how in-
formation related to individual users is aggregated as a result
of browsing seemingly unrelated Web sites. We examine the
privacy diﬀusion on the Internet, hidden transactions, and
the potential for a few sites to be able to construct a pro-
ﬁle of individual users. We deﬁne and generate a privacy
footprint allowing us to assess and compare the diﬀusion of
privacy information across a wide variety of sites. We ex-
amine the eﬀectiveness of existing and new techniques to
reduce this diﬀusion. Our results show that the size of the
privacy footprint is a legitimate cause for concern across the
sets of sites that we study.

INTRODUCTION
Users on the Internet increasingly manage their daily in-
teractions by accessing various Web applications that re-
quire them to supply private information such as credit card
and bank account numbers. A necessary requirement on
such sites is the safeguarding of all information that might
be deemed as private to the users. Most users do not have
an idea if any of the various bits of private information that
add up to their identity is disseminated to parties other than
the sites directly visited. The privacy implications of data
gathered when users access Web sites needs to be examined
closely.
Earlier [5] we examined non-primary content traﬃc (pri-
marily advertisements) obtained as a result of visiting pop-
ular Web sites, and the resulting increase in objects, bytes
and latency. Here, as part of constructing a privacy foot-
print metric measuring the dissemination of user-related in-

formation, we examine how browsing information related to
individual users is tracked and aggregated across seemingly
unrelated Web sites. We deﬁne the privacy footprint based
on the set of sites visited by them, as the degree of inter-
connectedness seen through aggregator nodes. A large foot-
print indicates more privacy information leaked to aggrega-
tor nodes. Aggregator nodes in possession of information
that can be tracked to individual users could potentially use
it in a manner that violates the legitimate privacy expecta-
tions of users. Knowing the degree of potential leakage of
private information may allow users to tailor their Internet
activities, enable Web sites to be more circumspect about
potential linkage of data, and allow for the emergence of new
standards for protecting privacy.
Our privacy footprint metric can be computed in a straight-
forward manner, is augmentable over time, and comparable
across individuals and organizations. Our goal goes beyond
the issue of privacy: we can also measure the unwanted traf-
ﬁc involved in contacting third-party servers and the corre-
sponding latency cost.
As a starting point, the study described in this paper,
examines the rich set of interconnections between sites di-
rectly visited by the user and the additional sites caused
to be downloaded as a result. Some of the downloads may
be visible; many are not. The third-party sites visited in-
directly often act as aggregators of information about the
user’s traversals through the Web. While some of the data
gathered as a result is harmless, information about certain
subsets of sites such as those related to managing personal
ﬁduciary information (ﬁnance, health, insurance, mortgage
etc.) raises stronger privacy concerns.
Our work is closely related to the concept of re-identiﬁcation:
the ability to relate supposedly anonymous data with actual
identities. A collection of anonymous datasets can be com-
bined with unanonymized datasets that were released sepa-
rately in order to extract useful identiﬁcation information.
A canonical example is that of a dataset of medical records
with just date of birth, gender, and geographical location in-
formation combined with another dataset of motor vehicle
department which may have similar information. By merg-
ing the two, the more private information in the medical
records leads to re-identiﬁcation. In our study, the proﬁle
that could be captured by hidden nodes of a user’s visit al-
lows for such re-identiﬁcation. If there is cookie information
present then a hidden node, for example, could track a user
who periodically visits a subset of their ﬁduciary sites with
some predictable frequency. Such a proﬁle could then be
sold to other visible sites who may be interested in speciﬁc
demographics.
The leakage of privacy is not a new concern and thus pre-
vention techniques have been studied. Prevention of privacy
leaks can be accomplished via blocking of unnecessary ac-
cesses to third party servers, use of intermediaries, etc. We
thus study the role of how techniques used to block down-
loading of unwanted traﬃc can be combined with the goal
of preserving privacy. The work described here is simply a
starting point; the set of questions and concerns are broader
and ongoing work will examine other aspects of the privacy
issue.
2. STUDY
As a basis for investigating the privacy footprint for a set
of Web sites we look at the connection between the directly
(visible) visited servers and the hidden servers that are ac-
cessed as a by-product of visiting visible servers. Using a
graph representation with nodes corresponding to servers,
an edge connects a visible node to a hidden node when the
access of the visible node causes the hidden node to be ac-
cessed.
As an example, when a user visits the page speciﬁed by
http://www.cnn.com/, the server www.cnn.com is accessed
along with servers i.a.cnn.net, m.2mdn.net, m.doubleclick.
net and cnn.122.2o7.net. Diﬀerent visible nodes often
have an edge to the same hidden node, such as m.doubleclick.
net, indicating that the server m.doubleclick.net is a po-
tential aggregation point to track and correlate knowledge
about a user’s actions.
We say that visible nodes are associated with each other
when they share one or more edges to a common hidden
node. In some cases multiple hidden nodes within the same
DNS domain are used. For example, the hidden nodes cnn.
122.2o7.net and dowjones.122.2o7.net are part of the
same 2o7.net domain. We explore the impact of merging all
hidden nodes with the same DNS domain. Another aspect
is the characteristics of edges. Edges are assigned between
visible and hidden nodes if at least one object is accessed,
but the total number of objects is not important in terms of
privacy. We distinguish between edges that lead to hidden
nodes supplying cookies and those edges that do not.
Similar to [5], we start by gathering the list of all ob-
jects retrieved when a user visits a page speciﬁed by a URL.
Extraneous content is often retrieved when Javascript is en-
abled. To gather realistic data about page downloads we
used the Firefox browser augmented by the “Pagestats”
Javascript extension [3], which records information about
when each HTTP request was made and the response is re-
ceived in an in-memory table and writing it out to a log
ﬁle. The interface allows the extension to run the browser
in batch mode where a list of sites is speciﬁed. The exten-
sion works well to eﬃciently and realistically retrieve over
a thousand Web pages in a single batch. As in our previ-
ous work [5], we chose sites across various categories from
Alexa’s popular sites in the English language [2] with 100
pages in each of 13 diﬀerent categories resulting in 1075
unique servers. These pages were retrieved from a single
location in April/May 2006.
Since privacy has diﬀerent connotations for diﬀerent seg-
ments of users, we characterize information aggregation in
tracking user activity across a broad range of Web sites. We
also examine the speciﬁc role of cookies. We then narrow our
examination to one important sub-category of sites: ﬁdu-
ciary sites involving personal ﬁnancial information of users.
We ﬁnally examine the eﬀectiveness of methods to defeating
tracking of users.
3. RESULTS
Our initial work on generating a privacy footprint for a
set of pages focused on the dataset of popular sites from 13
Alexa categories. The pages in this set are served by 1075
servers (visible), which when accessed, cause an additional
2926 unique (hidden) servers to be accessed.
We ﬁrst compute the number of associated visible nodes
for each visible node to get an idea of connectedness in the
graph. Two visible nodes are associated if they each are con-
nected via an edge to a common hidden node. This “server”
approach of using the server name for each hidden node
fails to capture obvious organizational relationships amongst
the hidden nodes. In our “domain” approach, hidden node
servers with the same 2nd-level domain are merged into a
single hidden node1. Visible nodes are not merged.
Using the 2nd-level name for combining servers within the
same organization does not correctly capture all such rela-
tionships. Two frequently occurring hidden domain nodes
are google-analytics.com and googlesyndication.com—
nodes from the same organization, but not the same second
level domain. We also found cases where what appeared
to be a server in one organization (e.g. lads.myspace.com)
was actually a DNS CNAME alias to a server (e.g. lads.
myspace.com.edgesuite.net) in another organization (e.g.
Akamai). We found these type relationships could be cap-
tured with an “adns” approach where all hidden nodes shar-
ing the same set of authoritative DNS servers (ADNSs) were
merged into a single hidden node.
To better understand whether this adns approach cor-
rectly groups servers of the same organization or if it leads
to false positive errors, we examined the servers contained
within the top-15 most frequently occurring ADNSs. The
top-15 account for more than half of the ADNSs handling
multiple servers. Doing spot checks on servers from these
top-15 ADNSs using DNS lookup tools, WHOIS, traceroute
and clustering analysis we observed an error rate of around
5% where servers from diﬀerent organizations use the same
ADNS.
Using the three approaches, Figure 1 shows a comple-
mentary CDF with the number of associations for all 1075
visible nodes. Along the y-axis, the results show that 61%
of these visible nodes are associated with at least one other
visible node using hidden nodes denoted by individual server
names. When these hidden nodes are merged according to
their domain then 72% of the visible nodes are associated
with at least one other visible node, and when hidden nodes
are merged according to their ADNS then this percentage
grows to 82%. Along the x-axis, the results show a max-
imum of 338 (31%) associations for a single visible node
under the server approach, a maximum of 443 (41%) asso-
ciations under the domain approach and a maximum of 609
(57%) associations under the ADNS approach. The graph
shows that over 60% of all visible nodes have associations
with more than 100 other visible nodes using the ADNS ap-
proach. The breadth and the depth of these results indicates
a signiﬁcant number of relationships between popular Web
sites visited by users that can be tracked via common, but
typically hidden, servers in the Internet.
We next examine hidden nodes and the degree to which

domain hidden nodes have edges to 559 (52%) of the visible
nodes with associations. The top-10 ADNS nodes are con-
nected to 682 (63%) of the visible nodes with associations.
These results indicate that focusing on the top hidden nodes
for analysis is appropriate.
