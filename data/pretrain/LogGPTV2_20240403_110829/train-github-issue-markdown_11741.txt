 **Symfony version(s) affected** : 4.1.8
**Description**
My app base on laravel 5.6, when I upgrade composer libs, symfony http-
foundation is update from 4.1.7 to 4.1.8. And laravel feature test is crash,
it can not simulate request to url, all return 404 code.
I think a minor version should not broke compatibility in other libs.
**How to reproduce**
  1. make a laravel 5.6 app.
  2. make a feature test.
  3. try to test some api like:
            $response   = $this->json('GET', '/some/path');
            dd($response->exception);
