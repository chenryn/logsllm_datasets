## Abstract
Over 8 million users rely on the Tor network daily to protect their online anonymity. However, Tor is vulnerable to website fingerprinting attacks, which allow an attacker to deduce the website a user is visiting based on traffic patterns. State-of-the-art attacks use deep learning to achieve high classification accuracy with raw packet information. Previous work has focused primarily on web pages, particularly home pages. In this study, we investigate the fingerprintability of video content served over Tor. We collected a new dataset of network traces for 50 YouTube videos of similar length. Preliminary experiments using a convolutional neural network model achieved up to 55% accuracy, indicating the potential to unmask individual videos viewed over Tor and creating additional privacy challenges.

## 1. Introduction
Tor is a widely used anonymity system, with over 8 million daily users [8]. It protects users' privacy by routing traffic through three encrypted nodes: entry, middle, and exit. This design hinders an attacker from associating a client's identity with the websites they visit. However, Tor is vulnerable to website fingerprinting (WF) attacks, where a local passive eavesdropper can deduce the visited website by analyzing encrypted traffic features [4, 9–11, 13, 16].

Recent research shows that deep learning (DL) classifiers operating on raw packet information achieve the best results, with less than 2% error in a closed-world setting [4, 16]. Prior work in WF has focused on web page loading, often only the home page. However, video streaming, which accounts for 57% of global downstream traffic, is also significant [14]. While Tor is slower than regular browsing, it is often fast enough for video streaming, even in high definition. Current WF attacks on Tor only reveal that a user is visiting a video hosting site like YouTube. With video fingerprinting, an attacker could identify specific videos, making it more privacy-invasive. Videos cover controversial topics, making it crucial to investigate Tor's resistance to video fingerprinting. To evaluate this, we collected a new Tor video traffic dataset and performed video fingerprinting (VF) experiments.

## 2. Background and Related Work
Several prior works have examined the fingerprintability of video streams under typical browsing conditions (HTTPS) [5, 7, 12, 15]. These studies highlight the dynamic nature of video streaming traffic due to Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) [6], which divides videos into small time segments and serves them with variable encoding bitrates based on available bandwidth. This results in significant variance in packet sequences for the same video, complicating fingerprinting.

## 3. Experimental Setup and Results
### 3.1 Dataset Collection
We collected a large dataset of network traces for 50 YouTube videos of similar length using the Tor Browser Bundle, YouTube API, and Selenium.

### 3.2 Data Representation
We considered two types of data representation: 
- Packet direction only
- Tik-Tok (direction and time)

### 3.3 Model and Experiments
We adopted the Deep Fingerprinting (DF) attack, which performs well against web pages, and tuned it for our dataset. Despite not addressing the differences between video data and web pages, we achieved nearly 55% accuracy. Table 1 summarizes the results:

| Length of Features | Traffic Information Direction [16] | Tik-Tok [11] |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------|
| 5000               | 28.60%                            | 34.10%       |
| 10000              | 47.80%                            | 47.90%       |
| 20000              | 52.20%                            | 52.60%       |
| 30000              | 53.70%                            | 54.10%       |
| 40000              | 54.30%                            | 54.70%       |

The Tik-Tok data representation provided slightly better accuracy, with the highest at 40,000-length input vectors. The minimal accuracy gain beyond 20,000 packets suggests that later portions of traces may be less valuable for classification or that larger traces perform poorly.

### 3.4 Discussion
The DF model's performance on our VF dataset is interesting but likely inadequate for realistic attacks. This is due to the differences between typical WF traffic and VF traffic. Webpage traffic is static within a single dataset, favoring fingerprintability. Video streaming traffic, however, is dynamic due to DASH, resulting in varying packet sequences for the same video. This variance causes issues for the DF attack, as it does not perform additional data processing on raw packet sequences.

## 4. Conclusion and Future Work
In this work, we investigated the fingerprintability of video traffic protected by Tor. Despite not addressing the significant differences between video data and web pages, we achieved nearly 55% accuracy, indicating the potential for stronger attacks to unmask users' video viewing habits.

In future work, we will develop different processing techniques to normalize the appearance of video traffic captured at different bitrates and explore different deep learning models. If these attempts improve the attack, we will need to capture an additional dataset to evaluate the performance of VF in a more realistic open-world setting. Additionally, we will determine the effectiveness of existing padding defenses for WF in the VF domain, as video length is a distinguishing characteristic that is hard to hide without significant bandwidth overhead.
