User: How to deploy a multi-container application using Docker Compose?
Assistant: 1. Write the docker-compose file: The docker-compose file is a file in yaml format, which describes the configuration and connection method of each container in the application. At least the service name, image, port mapping, data volume and other information of all containers need to be listed in the file. For example: ``` version: '3' services: web: image: nginx ports: - "8080:80" api: image: node:latest ports: - "3000:3000" volumes: - ./api:/app ` `` 2. Run docker-compose: Run the docker-compose up command, and Docker will build and start the required containers according to the configuration in the docker-compose file. ``` $ docker-compose up -d ``` 3. View container status: Run the docker-compose ps command to view the status of all containers in the application. ``` $ docker-compose ps ``` 4. Access the application: By using the port mapped by the container, the container in the application can be accessed in the local browser. For example, in the above example, you can enter http://localhost:8080 in your browser to access the Nginx container. 5. Shut down the application: Run the docker-compose down command to stop and delete all containers. ``` $ docker-compose down ```
