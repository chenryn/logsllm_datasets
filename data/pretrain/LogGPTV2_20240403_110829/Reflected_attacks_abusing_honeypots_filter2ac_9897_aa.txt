## Abstract
This paper presents an analysis of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that exploit the reflection of flooding traffic off reflectors. This type of attack was notably used in a series of large-scale attacks against the internet infrastructure of the Czech Republic in March 2013. In addition to common hosts, honeypots were also abused as reflectors, leading to false positive incident detections and aiding the attackers. By default, honeypots are configured to accept any incoming network connection, which unintentionally amplified the effect of the reflection. We analyze the attack from the perspective of honeypots and highlight the risks associated with their responsiveness to any incoming traffic. We also discuss potential methods for detecting and mitigating such attacks and share lessons learned from handling this specific incident. The lack of communication and data sharing during the attack is also addressed.

## 1. Introduction
Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks pose a significant threat to modern networks. They are relatively easy to execute, difficult to defend against, and the attackers often remain undetected due to the use of IP spoofing techniques and the distributed nature of the attacks.

Distributed Reflected Denial-of-Service (DRDoS) attacks do not directly contact the victim. Instead, they spoof the victim's source IP address and bounce traffic off reflectors. This causes the reflectors to appear as the attackers, while the real attacker remains hidden. Reflectors do not need to amplify the attack; even a response with the same or smaller amount of data can be sufficient. Any host in the network, including servers, workstations, and honeypots, can be abused as a reflector.

In our observation, honeypots unintentionally aided the attackers. Honeypots, by design, are not meant to be accessed by legitimate users. If a honeypot's network traffic is monitored and it is abused as a reflector, we may detect an attempt to contact it and mark the source IP as a potential attacker. While this is a standard procedure for detecting malicious behavior, in the case of DRDoS, the spoofed address is marked as the attacker. Although any traffic destined for a honeypot is suspicious, we cannot be certain if we have identified the real attacker or a victim.

The involvement of honeypots in DRDoS attacks is often overlooked. For example, in the massive DDoS attacks against the Czech Republic in March 2013, honeypots were abused as reflectors. Another incident in April 2013 involved an IP address part of a DDoS mitigation service, where the actual victim was reported as an attacker initiating unsolicited connections to honeypots.

This paper is organized into six sections. Section 2 provides an overview of recent DDoS attacks and the role of honeypots. Section 3 discusses the importance of proper configuration of honeypots to prevent reflection. Sections 4 and 5 explore detection and mitigation strategies and the issues organizations should be prepared to handle. The paper concludes in Section 6.

## 2. DDoS Attacks Against the Czech Republic

In March 2013, the Czech Republic experienced a series of DDoS attacks lasting four consecutive days. This was the first time the entire country faced an attack of such magnitude. Online media, banks, and mobile operators were targeted from Monday, March 4, to Thursday, March 7, during working hours (8 AM to 5 PM CET).

The attacker used two types of DDoS attacks, with volumes up to 1 Gbps. The initial attacks on Monday and Tuesday were SYN flood attacks aimed at more than a dozen online media sites and the popular Czech search engine Seznam.cz. According to the DDoS taxonomy, these were brute-force attacks using randomly spoofed source IP addresses with fluctuating rates. Despite the simplicity and low bandwidth, the overload on virtual hosting denied access to many web pages, likely to attract media attention.

On Wednesday and Thursday, the attacks continued as reflected SYN floods targeting major Czech banks and two mobile operators. These were brute-force attacks using fixed spoofed source IP addresses with fluctuating rates, known as DRDoS attacks. As shown in Figure 1, DRDoS attacks bounce flooding traffic off reflectors by spoofing requests from the victim to Internet hosts, which then send replies to the victim. These attacks rely on improperly configured servers and computers responding to incoming packets, making them harder to trace and filter.

According to CESNET, the Czech National Research and Education Network (NREN), 68% of connections on random destination ports were accepted and responded to with SYN+ACK. This amounted to approximately 1.5 million packets per 5 minutes.

**Figure 1: Schema of the Reflected Attack**

Honeypots were particularly effective reflectors in the DRDoS attack. We observed that honeypots from another Czech university reflected 93% of all incoming packets. At Masaryk University, hosts reflected about 5% of incoming packets, while honeypots alone reflected 16%. Figure 2 shows a traffic peak from honeypots that was stopped shortly after the false positive detection and filtering of the actual victim.

## 3. Honeypot Settings and Vulnerabilities

Honeypots are typically implemented in two ways: high-interaction and low-interaction. High-interaction honeypots are deployed as virtual machines with a real operating system and applications, making them indistinguishable from real hosts. They are less commonly deployed in large numbers. Low-interaction honeypots, on the other hand, are emulators of systems or their parts. Their settings and possible countermeasures are limited, but they are cost-effective and often deployed in large numbers.
