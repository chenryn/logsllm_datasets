ABSTRACT
We present the observation of distributed denial-of-service
attacks that use re(cid:13)ection of the (cid:13)ooding traﬃc oﬀ re(cid:13)ec-
tors. This type of attack was used in massive attacks against
internet infrastructure of Czech Republic in March, 2013.
Apart from common hosts in the network, honeypots were
abused as the re(cid:13)ectors.
It caused the false positive inci-
dent detection and helped attackers. Honeypots, which are
by default set to accept any incoming network connection,
unintentionally ampli(cid:12)ed the eﬀect of re(cid:13)ection. We present
an analysis of the attack from the point of view of honey-
pots and show the risks of having honeypots respond to any
incoming traﬃc. We also discuss the possibilities of attack
detection and mitigation and present lessons learned from
handling the attack. We point out a lack of communication
and data sharing during the observed attack.

INTRODUCTION
Denial-of-service attacks are a major threat to today’s net-
works. They are relatively easy to perform, hard to defend
against, and the attacker is rarely traced back due to com-
mon usage of IP spoo(cid:12)ng techniques and a distributed form
of the attack.
The Distributed Re(cid:13)ected Denial-of-Service (DRDoS) at-
tacks do not contact the victim directly, they rather spoof
source IP address of the victim and use bouncing of traf-
(cid:12)c oﬀ re(cid:13)ectors instead. The spoo(cid:12)ng of victims’ IP address
causes the re(cid:13)ectors to appear as the attackers while the real
attacker is often above suspicion. Re(cid:13)ectors do not need to

amplify an attack, response with the same or even smaller
amount of data is suﬃcient for a successful attack. In addi-
tion, any host in the network can be abused as a re(cid:13)ector,
i. e., server, workstation or honeypot.
We have observed a situation where honeypots uninten-
tionally helped the attacker. Honeypots, by their nature, are
not meant to be accessed by legitimate users. If a network
traﬃc of a honeypot is monitored and a honeypot is abused
as a re(cid:13)ector, we can see an attempt to contact it and mark
the source IP as a potential attacker. This is natural and
legitimate procedure of malicious behavior detection but,
in case of DRDoS, we have marked spoofed address as an
attacker. Even though any network traﬃc destined to hon-
eypot is suspicious, we cannot be sure if we have detected
the real attacker or a victim.
The involvement of honeypots in DRDoS is often ignored,
as we have observed in several attacks recently. To name
a few, abuse of honeypots was associated with the massive
DDoS attacks against Czech Republic in March, 2013. An-
other example of this type of attack was an incident from
April, 2013, when we detected an IP address, which was
part of a DDoS mitigation service. In both cases, the actual
victim was reported and as an attacker initiating unsolicited
connections to honeypots.
This paper is organized in six sections. We recount the
recent DDoS attacks and the role of honeypots in them in
Section 2. We point out the importance of proper con(cid:12)g-
uration of honeypots to eliminate the re(cid:13)ection in Section
3. The possibilities of detection and mitigation of the at-
tacks and handling issues for which organizations should be
prepared are described in Section 4 and 5. The paper is
concluded in Section 6.
2. DDOS ATTACKS AGAINST CZECH RE-
PUBLIC
In March 2013, Czech Republic was a target of DDoS
attacks which lasted 4 consecutive days.
It was the (cid:12)rst
time the entire country had to face an attack of this volume.
Online media, banks and mobile operators were gradually
under DDoS attacks from Monday, March 4 to Thursday,
March 7 in working hours between 8 AM and 5 PM (CET).
The attacker used two types of DDoS attack with volume
up to 1 Gbps [1] and initiated the attack with the knowledge
of the Czech internet. The reason for the attack is unknown
but it has shown how prepared the Czech community is for
these attacks.
The attacks started with a SYN (cid:13)ood attack on Monday
and Tuesday and were aimed against more than a dozen on-
1449line media virtually hosted on a few servers, and the most
popular Czech search engine Seznam.cz. According to DDoS
attacks taxonomy [5], it was a brute-force attack using ran-
domly spoofed source IP addresses with (cid:13)uctuating rate.
Even though the attack was simple and the bandwidth was
low, overload of the virtual hosting denied access to many
web pages. We believe that the goal of these attacks was to
attract the attention of media.
On Wednesday and Thursday the attack continued with
re(cid:13)ected SYN (cid:13)ood attack. The attacks were aimed against
websites of major Czech banks and two mobile operators.
According to the taxonomy [5], it was a brute-force attack
using (cid:12)xed spoofed source IP address with (cid:13)uctuating rate
known as the DRDoS attack. As shown in Figure 1, it is a
form of a DDoS attack that bounces the (cid:13)ooding traﬃc oﬀ
of re(cid:13)ectors by spoo(cid:12)ng requests from the victim to Internet
hosts that will send replies to the victim [6]. These attacks
are based on willingness of improperly con(cid:12)gured servers
and computers to respond to incoming packets. Re(cid:13)ected
attacks due to their nature are harder to trace and (cid:12)lter.
According to CESNET, the Czech NREN1, 68 % connections
on random destination port were accepted and responded to
with SYN+ACK. It was approximately 1.5 million packets
per 5 minutes.
Figure 1: Schema of the re(cid:13)ected attack
Honeypots became great re(cid:13)ectors for the DRDoS attack.
We observed that honeypots from another Czech university
re(cid:13)ected 93 % of all incoming packets. Hosts in the network
of Masaryk University re(cid:13)ected approximately 5 % of incom-
ing packets while honeypots alone re(cid:13)ected 16 % of incoming
packets. Figure 2 shows a traﬃc peak from honeypots that
was stopped shortly after the false positive detection and
(cid:12)ltering of the actual victim.
3. HONEYPOT SETTINGS AND VULNER-
ABILITIES
Traditionally, there are two approaches to honeypot im-
plementation, high-interaction and low-interaction honey-
pots [2]. These implementations diﬀer in a level of possi-
ble interaction between a honeypot and an attacker. High-
interaction honeypots are usually deployed as the virtual
machines with a real operating system and applications.
They do not diﬀer from the real hosts on the network and
they are not often deployed in large numbers. The low-
interaction honeypots are usually emulators of systems or
their parts. The settings of these honeypots are limited
as well as the possible countermeasures while they are cheap
to deploy and often deployed in large numbers.
