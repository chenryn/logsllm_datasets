A Radiation Dose Assessment
The Secure 1000 generates low-energy X-rays (50 kVp at
5 mA tube accelerating potential) to construct its images.
Although this output is low, the machine still produces
ionizing radiation, and careful assessment is necessary to
ensure public safety.
The imparted dose has been scrutinized recently by
various agencies applying a number of experimental de-
signs [2, 14, 53]. These ﬁndings have been consistent with
manufacturer claims [38] that per-scan radiation exposure
to subjects is nonzero, but is near natural background
levels. Additionally, there have been claims and counter-
claims surrounding the distribution of dose within the
body, with some groups raising concerns that the scanner
might impart a minimal deep dose but an overly large skin
dose to the subject [5, 40, 43].
To shed light on this question, we executed a brief as-
sessment of the radiological output of the scanner using
Landauer Inc.’s InLight whole body dosimeters. These
dosimeters give a shallow dose equivalent (SDE), a deep
dose equivalent (DDE), and an eye lens dose equivalent.
They are analyzed using optically stimulated lumines-
cence (OSL), an established dosimeter technology [9, 20].
We read the results using Landauer’s proprietary Mi-
croStar dosimeter reader.
We used a simple experimental design to quantify the
dose output: we arranged 21 dosimeters on a RANDO
chest phantom positioned upright on a wooden table with
a neck-to-ﬂoor distance of 144 cm and a source-to-detec-
tor distance of 66 cm, approximating the conditions of a
normal scan. The dosimeters give a more accurate dose
representation if the incident beam is perpendicular to
the detector material. In this case, the dosimeters were
attached to the chest phantom without regard for beam
angle, and so no correction factors were implemented;
geometry issues were expected in the results.
The InLight dosimeters require a total dose of at least
50 µSv to be accurate. To irradiate them sufﬁciently, we
performed 4033 consecutive single scans in the machine’s
normal operating mode. (Each screening consists of at
least two such scans: one front and one rear.) A scan was
automatically triggered every 12 s and lasted 5.7 s, for a
total beam-on time of 6 h 23 min.
We read the dosimeters the following day. A small loss
of dose due to fade is expected, but for the purpose of this
study we regard this decrease as negligible. We applied
the standard low-dose Cs-137 calibration suggested by
Landauer. Initially, we were concerned that the low en-
ergy output of the scanner (50 kVp tube potential emits
an X-ray spectrum centered roughly in 16 keV–25 keV)
would lead to inaccurate readings on the InLights, but
since the dosimeters are equipped with ﬁlters, the dose
equation algorithm in the MicroStar reader can deduce
beam energy without a correction factor applied to the
662 keV energy from the original calibration.
The average DDE per scan for all the dosimeters was
calculated to be 73.8 nSv. The average SDE per scan
was 70.6 nSv, and the average eye-lens dose per scan was
77.9 nSv. The standard deviation (σ) and the coefﬁcient
of variation (CV) value of all the dosimeters for the DDE
were 0.75 and 0.10 (generally low variance) respectively.
For the SDE and lens dose, σ and the CV were 1.26 and
0.16, and 2.08 and 0.29, respectively.
An unexpected aspect of our results is that the measured
DDE is higher than the SDE, and this occurrence is worth
further examination. The irradiation geometry of the
dosimeters could possibly explain this irregularity.
It
might be productive to conduct further experiments that
account for this effect.
The doses we measured are several times higher than
those found in the recent AAPM Task Group 217 re-
port [2], but they still equate to only nominal exposure:
approximately equal to 24 minutes of natural background
radiation and below the recommendation of 250 nSv per
screening established by the applicable ANSI/HPS stan-
dard [3]. A person would have to undergo approximately
3200 scans per year to exceed the standard’s annual expo-
sure limit of 250 µSv/year, a circumstance unlikely even
for transportation workers and very frequent ﬂiers.
