### Summary
When using `import_tasks` within a file that is included via `include_tasks`, an incorrect error message is generated.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Create a playbook with the following content:
    ```yaml
    - include_tasks: "os/{{ ansible_distribution }}/main.yml"
    ```

2. Inside the `main.yml` file, add the following task:
    ```yaml
    - import_tasks: "firewall.yml"
    ```

### Expected Results
- An appropriate error or linting warning should be generated, indicating that `import_tasks` is not allowed inside an `include_tasks` file.

### Actual Results
- The following fatal error is observed:
    ```json
    fatal: [node1]: FAILED! => {
        "reason": "'ansible_distribution' is undefined"
    }
    ```

This error message is misleading, as the actual issue is the use of `import_tasks` within an `include_tasks` file.
