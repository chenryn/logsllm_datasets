4. WHO SENDS IBR?
We investigate how many and what type of networks send IBR.
In all our datasets we observe trafﬁc from a non-trivial number
of IP addresses (> 100M), /24 blocks (> 2.6M) and preﬁxes (>
170k), and trafﬁc from almost all countries and most large networks
(including non-enterprise ASes). As a result, we can potentially
use IBR to characterize many hosts and /24 blocks, and provide
Internet-wide analysis at the AS or country-code level.
4.1 How many sources are observed?
Table 1 reports the absolute number of sources (IP addresses,
/24 blocks, preﬁxes, ASes and countries) observed through our
datasets. Compared to the total address space announced in BGP,
we observe a few IP addresses, more than a quarter of /24 blocks,
close to half of all preﬁxes and ASes, and almost all country codes.
However, a large fraction of address space announced in BGP may
not actually be “used”, which we deﬁne as generating trafﬁc on the
global Internet [21, 50]. Based on previous literature, we observe
about half of the inferred used /24 blocks: using seven different
data sources, Dainotti et al. found 5.3M actually used /24 blocks
in 2013 [21], while Zander et al. estimated that a total of 6.2M to
6.3M /24 blocks were used in June 2014 [50].
While the numbers in Table 1 are consistent across all four datasets,
we ﬁnd considerably fewer sources (except at country-level granu-
larity) with shorter measurement intervals. Figure 1 shows statis-
tics on the fraction of sources observed in a minute, hour, or day
for UCSD-13 (the other datasets show similar values for all source
and time granularities). As expected, by lengthening the observa-
tion period, we capture additional sources. However, due to re-
peated contact, the growth in number of sources observed is less
than linear.
At the time granularities depicted in Figure 1, the number of
observed sources is highly variable. Diurnal patterns in IBR [48]
are one cause of variability, especially for small source granularity
(i.e., IP addresses and /24 blocks). The changing composition of
IBR (Section 5) contributes to the variance on longer time scales.
Section 7.1 describes this aspect, based on variations observed over
years.
4.2 What types of networks are observed?
We observe trafﬁc from diverse locations. In the UCSD-13 dataset,
we miss only three countries that announce /24 blocks. All three
countries are small islands or collections of islands, each with a
population of under 4,000 people [18].
Many ASes do not send IBR to our darknets: we observe about
half of ASes announced in BGP. However, most missed ASes are
small. Figure 2 shows, for UCSD-13, the distribution of observed
ASes in terms of /24 blocks announced. Of the 20.6k unobserved
ASes in UCSD-13, almost half announce a single /24 block, and
90% announce the equivalent of 8 or fewer /24 blocks. Conversely,
we observe 86% of ASes that advertise the equivalent of at least a
/16 block – we call these ASes large. ASes belonging to the US De-
partment of Defense account for a ﬁfth of unobserved large ASes,
which appears to have many routed but “unused” /24 blocks [21].
In terms of AS type, we miss 26% of large ASes classiﬁed as enter-
prise, and about 4% of the large ASes classiﬁed as transit/access or
content. The comprehensiveness of IBR’s coverage of large ASes
implies that it originates from diverse set of networks. In Section
6, we analyze how often the same ASes are observed over time.
4.3 Lessons learned
The number of sources captured by a network telescope is depen-
dent on the duration of observation, the time of day, and the size of
the network. Across our datasets, we consistently observe a sig-
niﬁcant fraction of the observably “used” IPv4 address space, and
in particular nearly all large transit/access and content ASes. As a
result, IBR has the potential to provide an Internet-wide view.

Figure 3: Top protocols. Most IP addresses send UDP trafﬁc. At the /24 block, preﬁx, AS and country levels we observe a similar percentage
of sources sending TCP and UDP. TCP accounts for most packets.
5. WHAT IS IBR MADE OF?
Most often, only a certain type of trafﬁc is helpful in inferring
a property of a network. For example, the authors of a previous
study [12] use the retransmission behavior of TCP to infer packet-
loss. It is thus important to understand the composition of IBR with
respect to its potential information content. Enumerating all types
of IBR-derivable information is a daunting, and probably impossi-
ble task. Instead, we characterize IBR along two basic dimensions:
transport layer protocol and application, since the information en-
coded in IBR is a function of them.
5.1 How many sources use TCP vs. UDP?
Figure 3 reports the fraction (out of the total observed in the re-
spective dataset) of IP addresses, /24 blocks, preﬁxes, ASes, and
country codes observed through the most popular transport layer
protocols. We observe most IP addresses via UDP trafﬁc. Both
TCP and UDP packets provide high visibility into /24 blocks and
ASes, although neither provides complete coverage. All transport
layer protocols provide excellent coverage of countries.
Wustrow et al. [48] characterize IBR based on the volume of
packets, and not the number of sources. They ﬁnd that from 2006–
2010 TCP was the dominant protocol (above 75% of packets) for all
years except 2008. Although our datasets are not directly compa-
rable (they do not remove spoofed packets), we also ﬁnd that TCP
is the dominant protocol by number of packets (Figure 3f). Since
UDP is the dominant protocol in terms of source IP addresses and
TCP is the dominant protocol in terms of packets, the protocols
may have different strengths when inferring network properties:
UDP is more likely to provide wide coverage, while TCP is more
likely to support analyses requiring repeated contact (Section 6).
5.2 Which applications contribute the most?
Here we classify IBR in terms of the process that generates the
trafﬁc. Port-based analysis, used in previous characterizations of
IBR [48], is insufﬁcient to analyze application-layer data [23]. For
example, Qihoo 360 Safe trafﬁc is the dominant application for all
top-10 UDP destination ports.
Unlike Pang et al. who responded to unsolicited trafﬁc [41], we
passively collect IBR. With limited information, we perform a best-
effort classiﬁcation of IBR into components (that is, classes of phe-
nomena responsible for different trafﬁc) based on observations of
initial communication attempts. For well-studied phenomena, we
leverage known properties (e.g., the ranges of addresses of Con-
ﬁcker targets and the decryption algorithm for Sality’s command-
and-control packets [17,27]). The “Bro Scanner” category is based
on Bro’s deﬁnition of a scanner: contacting at least 25 unique des-
tinations on the same port within 5 minutes [46]. We assign to the
“Encrypted” category trafﬁc with packets where entropy(payload) ≈
log2(len(payload)). We then manually look for abnormalities in
the number of observed source /24 blocks and derive a packet or
ﬂow-level ﬁlter matching the responsible trafﬁc. We investigate and
identify new phenomena based on TCP/UDP ports, UDP payloads,
packet lengths, TCP ﬂags, and number of packets. We complete the
analysis in time (e.g., why a certain hour captures many /24 blocks)
and space (e.g., why a darknet /16 block receives many /24 blocks).
We perform this analysis iteratively: once we identify a component,
we remove it from our data and ﬁnd additional components causing
abnormalities.
Table 2 reports the components that contribute a signiﬁcant num-
ber of source /24 blocks. We aggregate some small components and
all unclassiﬁed components into the “Other” category. We group
the components based on the reason they appear in IBR: acciden-
tally (i.e., due to bugs or misconﬁgurations), as part of a scan, as
a by-product of spoofed trafﬁc, such as DoS attacks, received by a
network (which sends backscatter to the darknet), and for unknown
reasons. Our classiﬁcation process discovers some interesting large
Internet phenomena. For example, most BitTorrent trafﬁc appears
to be the result of index-poisoning attacks that pollute the DHT

/24 blocks observed by IBR component.
Table 2:
IBR is composed of many different types of trafﬁc. File-sharing trafﬁc con-
tributes the highest number of /24 blocks in all datasets, but there are variations based on time (UCSD-13 vs UCSD-12) and position
(partial-UCSD-13 vs MERIT-13). We observe most /24 blocks through multiple IBR components, implying that insight into a network
is not dependent on a single type of trafﬁc.
with bogus IP addresses. We determine a UDP payload was sent
from Qihoo 360 Safe by investigating some live hosts at UC San
Diego responsible for it. A byte-order bug, triggered when a host
receives updates via a P2P network, causes this trafﬁc. In Section
7, we link trends of the individual components to changes in IBR
properties over time.
When studying 2010-era IBR reaching four /8 networks, Wus-
trow et al. ﬁnd that scanning accounts for the majority of packets in
all but 1.0.0.0/8 [48]. In our datasets, many well-studied, malicious
IBR phenomena—scanning (including Conﬁcker), backscatter—
also account for most of the packets (collectively contributing about
83% of all packets in UCSD-13). But, surprisingly, malicious traf-
ﬁc is not the largest component of IBR in terms of sources. Packets
with a P2P ﬁle-sharing payload contribute over 1.9M /24 blocks
in all datasets, accounting for over two-thirds of all /24 blocks ob-
served; Qihoo 360 Safe trafﬁc alone contributes about 100M IP
addresses.
We observe most /24 blocks through multiple IBR components,
implying that many types of IBR can provide insight into the same
networks.
In particular, even without the top IBR components,
the “Other” component alone, contributes with 1.4M /24 blocks.
The “Unique” column of Table 2 reports the number of /24 blocks
observed through a single IBR component. For each component,
the number of unique /24 blocks is at least an order of magnitude
smaller than the total number of /24 blocks observed through that
component. As a result, if the composition of IBR changes slightly
we would still observe many of the same networks.
5.3 Lessons learned
Some IBR-based inferences require a certain type of trafﬁc; other
network properties can be inferred regardless of the underlying ap-
plication, but their success is dependent on the composition of IBR.
Fortunately, IBR is made up of many components, each of which
contributes relatively few unique /24 blocks (implying some anal-
yses may be robust to ﬂuctuations in IBR composition). While
most packets are TCP (due to scanning and backscatter), we ob-
serve more IP addresses from UDP trafﬁc (due to P2P and bugs).
IBR is commonly known as malicious trafﬁc. However, we ﬁnd
that the phenomena that contribute the highest number of sources
(over 1M /24 blocks) appear to be of benign nature.
6. HOW OFTEN DO WE RECEIVE IBR?
In this section, we consider inferences that require multiple ob-
servations of a given host/network. For example, Benson et al. [12]
determine that the path from hosts in an AS to a darknet changed
by observing the behavior of the TTL ﬁeld. In addition to look-
ing for changes in given ﬁelds, we can leverage the timing between
packets (e.g., to infer uptime [32]) and the predictability of repeated
contacts (e.g., to infer outages [24]).
To study repeated contact from IBR sources, we report (1) how
often a host/network is observed, (2) the length of time between the
ﬁrst and last observation of a source, and (3) the timing between
contacts. Our approach is to partition our dataset into 1-minute,
1-hour, and 1-day time bins and record the sources sending IBR
in each bin. In mathematical notation, let S and T be the set of
