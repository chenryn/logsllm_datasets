### TACACS+ Server Configuration

**Usage:**
You can configure up to two TACACS+ servers. The servers are used in the order they are added to the configuration. The first server you add is considered the primary server, and the second server is the secondary (backup) server. Enter a separate command for each server. The secondary server is only used if the primary server does not respond.

**Examples:**

1. **Adding a TACACS+ Server with Shared Secret:**
   ```shell
   ACOS(config)# tacacs-server host 192.168.3.45 secret SharedSecret
   ```

2. **Adding a TACACS+ Server with Additional Parameters:**
   ```shell
   ACOS(config)# tacacs-server host 192.168.3.72 secret NewSecret port 1980 timeout 6
   ```

3. **Deleting a TACACS+ Server:**
   ```shell
   ACOS(config)# no tacacs-server host 192.168.3.45
   ```

4. **Deleting All TACACS+ Servers:**
   ```shell
   ACOS(config)# no tacacs-server
   ```

### TACACS+ Server Monitoring

**Description:**
Check the status of TACACS+ servers.

**Syntax:**
```shell
[no] tacacs-server monitor [interval seconds]
```

**Parameters:**
- `seconds`: Frequency (in seconds) for checking the status of the TACACS+ server. You can specify 1-120 seconds.
- **Default:** Status checking is not enabled. When enabled, the default interval is 60 seconds.

**Mode:**
Global configuration

**Usage:**
When TACACS+ server monitoring is configured, the ACOS device sends a TACACS+ monitor request, which includes the user name and password to log into the device and check if the server is available. If the server is available, the `last_available_timestamp` is updated with the current time.

- If a user login authentication request arrives at the ACOS device, it will send the request to the TACACS+ server with the most recent `last_available_timestamp` value.
- If the user's login attempt is successful, the timestamp for that server is updated to the current time.
- If the user authentication request fails, the ACOS device will send the request to the secondary TACACS+ server.
- To enable this feature, you must configure the user name and password for the TACACS+ server’s administrative account. A simple server port "ping" is not recommended as it could cause the ACOS device to be mistakenly seen as an attacker and added to the ACL.

### Techreport

**Description:**
Configure automated collection of system information. Technical Support may ask for these reports to diagnose system issues.

**Syntax:**
```shell
[no] techreport
{interval minutes | disable | priority-partition name}
```

**Parameters:**
- `interval minutes`: Specifies how often to collect new information (15-120 minutes). Default is 15 minutes.
- `disable`: Disables automated collection of system information.
- `priority-partition name`: Configures the specified partition to automatically collect system information.

**Default:**
Automated collection of system information is enabled by default with a 15-minute interval.

**Mode:**
Configuration mode

**Usage:**
The ACOS device saves all techreport information for a given day in a single file, with timestamps identifying when each set of information is gathered. The device saves techreport files for the most recent 31 days, with each day’s reports saved in a separate file. Techreports are a light version of the output generated by the `show techsupport` command. To export the information, use the `show techsupport` command. If the ACOS device is part of an aVCS virtual chassis, use the `device-context` command to specify the device in the chassis to which to apply this command.

### Terminal Configuration

**Description:**
Set the terminal configuration.

**Syntax:**
```shell
[no] terminal
{
auto-size |
editing |
gslb-prompt options |
history [size number] |
idle-timeout minutes |
length number |
prompt options |
width lines
}
```

**Parameters:**
- `auto-size`: Automatically adjusts the length and width of the terminal display. Enabled by default.
- `gslb-prompt options`: Enables display of the ACOS device’s role within a GSLB group at the CLI prompt.
  - `disable`: Disables display of the GSLB group status.
  - `group-role symbol`: Displays "Member" or "Master" in the CLI prompt.
  - `symbol`: Displays "gslb" in the CLI prompt after the name of the ACOS device.
- `editing`: Enables command editing. Enabled by default.
- `history [size number]`: Enables the command history and specifies the number of commands it can contain (0-1000). Default is 256 commands.
- `idle-timeout minutes`: Specifies the number of minutes a CLI session can be idle before it times out and is terminated (0-60 minutes). Default is 15 minutes.
- `length number`: Specifies the number of lines to display per page (0-512). Default is 24 lines.
- `prompt options`: See “Using the CLI” on page 1.
- `width lines`: Specifies the number of columns to display (0-512). Default is 80 columns.

**Default:**
See descriptions.

**Mode:**
Configuration mode

**Example:**
```shell
ACOS(config)# terminal idle-timeout 30
```

### TFTP Block Size

**Description:**
Change the TFTP block size.

**Syntax:**
```shell
[no] tftp blksize bytes
```

**Parameters:**
- `bytes`: Maximum packet length the ACOS TFTP client can use when sending or receiving files to or from a TFTP server (512-32768 bytes).

**Default:**
512 bytes

**Mode:**
Configuration mode

**Usage:**
Increasing the TFTP block size can provide the following benefits:
- TFTP file transfers can occur more quickly, as fewer blocks are required to send a file.
- File transfer errors due to the server reaching its maximum block size before a file is transferred can be eliminated.

To determine the maximum file size a block size will allow, use the formula:
- 1K-blocksize = 64MB-filesize

**Examples:**
- Block Size: 1024, Maximum File Size: 64 MB
- Block Size: 8192, Maximum File Size: 512 MB
- Block Size: 32768, Maximum File Size: 2048 MB

Increasing the TFTP block size of the ACOS device only increases the maximum block size supported by the ACOS device. The TFTP server must also support larger block sizes. If the block size is larger than the TFTP server supports, the file transfer will fail, and a communication error will be displayed on the CLI terminal.

If the TFTP block size is larger than the IP Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) on any device involved in the file transfer, the TFTP packets will be fragmented to fit within the MTU. Fragmentation will not increase the number of blocks but can add some overhead to the overall file transmission speed.

**Example:**
```shell
ACOS(config)# show tftp
TFTP client block size is set to 512
ACOS(config)# tftp blksize 4096
ACOS(config)# show tftp
TFTP client block size is set to 4096
```

### Timezone Configuration

**Description:**
Configure the time zone on your system.

**Syntax:**
```shell

**Parameters:**
- `zone`: Specify the time zone. Enter `timezone ?` at the CLI prompt to see a list of available time zones.
- `nodst`: Disable daylight savings time adjustments for the system time.

**Default:**
GMT

**Mode:**
Configuration mode

**Usage:**
If you change the ACOS timezone or system time using the GUI or CLI, the statistical database is cleared. This database contains general system statistics (performance, CPU, memory, and disk utilization) and SLB statistics.

**Example:**
```shell
ACOS(config)# timezone America/Los_Angeles
```

### TX Congestion Control

**Description:**
Configure looping on the polling driver, on applicable models.

### ACOS Virtual Chassis System (aVCS)

**Description:**
Configure ACOS Virtual Chassis System (aVCS).

**Note:**
The `vcs` commands are available only when aVCS is enabled. To enable aVCS, use the `vcs enable` command.

**For more information:**
See “aVCS CLI Commands” in Configuring ACOS Virtual Chassis Systems.

### VE Statistics

**Description:**
Enable statistics collection for Virtual Ethernet (VE) interfaces.

**Note:**
This command does not work in L3V partitions.

**Syntax:**
```shell
[no] ve-stats enable
```

**Default:**
Disabled

**Mode:**
Configuration mode

**Usage:**
If the ACOS device is a member of an aVCS virtual chassis, use the `device-context` command to specify the device in the chassis to which to apply this command.

### VLAN Configuration

**Description:**
Configure a virtual LAN (VLAN). This command changes the CLI to the configuration level for the VLAN.

**Syntax:**
```shell
[no] vlan vlan-id
```

**Parameters:**
- `vlan-id`: ID of the VLAN (2-4094). If the ACOS device is a member of an aVCS virtual chassis, specify the `vlan-id` as follows: `DeviceID/vlan-id`.

**Default:**
VLAN 1 is configured by default. All Ethernet data ports are members of VLAN 1 by default.

**Mode:**
Configuration mode

**Usage:**
You can add or remove ports in VLAN 1 but cannot delete VLAN 1 itself. For information about the commands available at the VLAN configuration level, see the “Config Commands: VLAN” chapter in the Network Configuration Guide.

**Example:**
```shell
ACOS(config)# vlan 69
ACOS(config-vlan:69)#
```

**Note:**
You cannot have duplicate VLANs configured across partitions. In the following example, VLAN 10 is configured in the shared partition:

```shell
ACOS(config)# vlan 10
ACOS(config-vlan:10)# exit
ACOS(config)#
```

If you attempt to configure VLAN 10 in an L3V partition, you will receive an error message:

```shell
ACOS(config)# active-partition p2
Current active partition: p2
ACOS[p2]# configure
ACOS[p2](config)# vlan 10
This VLAN or Port is owned by another partition.
```

### Enable Layer 2 Forwarding on Default VLAN

**Description:**
Enable Layer 2 forwarding on the default VLAN (VLAN 1).

**Syntax:**
```shell
[no] vlan-global enable-def-vlan-l2-forwarding
```

**Default:**
Layer 2 forwarding is disabled on VLAN 1, on ACOS devices deployed in route mode.

**Usage:**
This command applies only to routed mode deployments. On a new or unconfigured ACOS device, as soon as you configure an IP interface on any individual Ethernet data port or trunk interface, Layer 2 forwarding on VLAN 1 is disabled.

When Layer 2 forwarding on VLAN 1 is disabled, broadcast, multicast, and unknown unicast packets are dropped instead of being forwarded. Learning is also disabled on the VLAN. However, packets for the ACOS device itself (e.g., LACP) are not dropped.

**Note:**
Configuring an IP interface on an individual Ethernet interface indicates you are deploying in route mode (also called “gateway mode”). If you deploy in transparent mode, in which the ACOS device has a single IP address for all data interfaces, Layer 2 forwarding is left enabled by default on VLAN 1.

### Globally Disable Layer 3 Forwarding Between VLANs

**Description:**
Globally disable Layer 3 forwarding between VLANs.

**Syntax:**
```shell
[no] vlan-global l3-vlan-fwd-disable
```

**Default:**
By default, the ACOS device can forward Layer 3 traffic between VLANs.

**Usage:**
This option is applicable only on ACOS devices deployed in gateway (route) mode. If the option to disable Layer 3 forwarding between VLANs is configured at any level, the ACOS device cannot be changed from gateway mode to transparent mode until the option is removed.

- Depending on the granularity of control required for your deployment, you can disable Layer 3 forwarding between VLANs at any of the following configuration levels:
  - Global: Layer 3 forwarding between VLANs is disabled globally, for all VLANs. (Use this command at the Configuration mode level.)
  - Individual interfaces: Layer 3 forwarding between VLANs is disabled for incoming traffic on specific interfaces.
  - Access Control Lists (ACLs): Layer 3 forwarding between VLANs is disabled for all traffic that matches ACL rules that use the `l3-vlan-fwd-disable` action.
