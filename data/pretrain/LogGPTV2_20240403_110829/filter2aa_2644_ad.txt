### Impact of Site or System Compromise on Generation Capacity and Reliability

**Q1: Can a site or system compromise negatively affect generation capacity or reliability?**

Answering Q1 is relatively straightforward and depends on how an organization defines a cyber device or cyber asset, as discussed in Section 4.3.1.2.

**Q2: What is the extent of the impact on the plant and other systems if a total system loss occurs?**

Answering Q2 typically involves approximating the effect of a total system loss on the plant and other systems. This process can be somewhat subjective and should be conducted by knowledgeable plant personnel, with verification to ensure accuracy. While most governing authorities do not provide a precise methodology for determining the critical nature of a system, they often recommend some form of device grouping. It is important to integrate new processes and requirements with existing ones as much as possible. For examples, see Appendix A.

### Cyber Devices Classification

| Level of Importance | Q1 (Cyber Device) | Q2 (Impact on Plant) | Classification | Implications |
|---------------------|-------------------|----------------------|----------------|--------------|
| 4                   | No                | No                   | Non-Critical Non-Cyber System | Least critical systems, usually outside the scope of compliance but still require minimal protection. |
| 3                   | No                | Yes                  | Critical Non-Cyber System | Requires physical security controls and management if feasible. |
| 2                   | Yes               | No                   | Non-Critical Cyber System | Requires electronic security controls and management. Physical security controls are highly recommended and often required under certain scenarios. |
| 1                   | Yes               | Yes                  | Critical Cyber System | The most critical systems, requiring the application of all organizational security policies and processes. |

### Examples of Cyber Devices

Typical cyber devices include Distributed Control Systems (DCS), Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), Single-Loop Controllers (SLCs), modern switchgear and relays, recorders, analyzers, and other Ethernet devices. Devices such as digital meters, indicators, and process transmitters, whose software functions are only validated by calibration and whose primary programming interface is a local manual keypad or do not have digital communications connections, are generally not included. Cyber devices must be assigned to a system and documented on the device list prior to classification.

### Additional Classification Criteria

**Q3: Severity of an Attack**
- Does the device directly support the reliable operation of a critical cyber system (Level 4 system)?
- Would the device disrupt operations of a critical site (Level 1 site) or critical cyber system if compromised (Level 4 system)?

**Q4: Likeliness of Attack**
- Is the device used for physical or electronic access control or monitoring of a Power System Protection (PSP) or an Energy System Protection (ESP)?
- Does the device perform system or plant control via Human Machine Interfaces (HMI) (Level 2 & 3 systems)?

**Q5: Ease of Attack**
- Does the device use routable protocol to communicate outside an ESP?
- Does the device use routable protocol inside a control center?
- Is the device dial-up accessible (Level 3 & 4 systems)?

| Level of Importance | Q3 | Q4 | Q5 | Risk | Classification | Implications |
|---------------------|----|----|----|------|----------------|--------------|
| 4                   | No | No | No | Low  | Non-Critical Cyber Devices | Least critical devices. |
| 3                   | No | No | Yes| Medium | Level 3 Critical Cyber Device | - |
| 3                   | No | Yes| No | Medium | Level 3 Critical Cyber Device | - |
| 2                   | No | Yes| Yes| High | Level 2 Critical Cyber Device | - |
| 3                   | Yes| No | No | Medium | Level 3 Critical Cyber Device | - |
| 2                   | Yes| No | Yes| High | Level 2 Critical Cyber Device | - |
| 2                   | Yes| Yes| No | High | Level 2 Critical Cyber Device | - |
| 1                   | Yes| Yes| Yes| Highest | Level 1 Critical Cyber Devices | Most critical devices. |

*Levels of criticality can guide network design to ensure the highest levels of criticality are inherently addressed first and protected and audited the most.

### Information Categorization

Confidentiality, integrity, and availability are key goals for information. All information should be classified based on low, medium, and high levels of potential impact on these security goals. The following table provides a risk-based approach to information categorization, based on FIPS 199.

| Risk | Confidentiality | Integrity | Availability |
|------|-----------------|-----------|--------------|
| Low  | Unintended or malicious release of information is predicted to have a limited adverse effect. | Unintended or malicious modification of information is predicted to have a limited adverse effect. | Interruption of access to information is predicted to have a limited adverse effect. |
| Medium | Unintended or malicious release of information is predicted to have a serious adverse effect. | Unintended or malicious modification of information is predicted to have a serious adverse effect. | Interruption of access to information is predicted to have a serious adverse effect. |
| High | Unintended or malicious release of information is predicted to have a severe or catastrophic adverse effect. | Unintended or malicious modification of information is predicted to have a severe or catastrophic adverse effect. | Interruption of access to information is predicted to have a severe or catastrophic adverse effect. |

### Classification Summary and Utilization

The following table provides guidance on which devices, sites, and systems need to be addressed in which order, as indicated by the alphabetical order of the letter designations. This is just one example of how classifications can be utilized.

| Cyber Device Level | Critical Sites | Non-Critical Sites | System Level |
|--------------------|----------------|--------------------|--------------|
| 1                  | a              | q                  | 1            |

| 3                  | g              | -                  | -            |
| 4                  | h              | -                  | -            |
| 1                  | i              | -                  | -            |
| 2                  | -              | -                  | -            |
| 3                  | -              | -                  | -            |
| 4                  | -              | -                  | -            |

Designing a comprehensive and open-ended classification system allows for automated and tracked classification assignments through database systems. New regulations, which are always anticipated, should not significantly alter current operations. The goal is to effectively and responsibly protect cyber systems, making the nuances of compliance standards less relevant. For example, any new regulations requiring additional controls can be more easily integrated into the existing framework.
