site or can system compromise negatively affect generation capacity or reliability? 
Answering Q1 is relatively straightforward and only depends on how an organization 
defines a cyber device or cyber asset (as discussed in section  4.3.1.2). Answering Q2 
will usually involve approximating the effect of total system loss to the plant and other 
systems; it will be a somewhat subjective process and should be answered by 
knowledgeable plant personnel and verified. Precise methodology to determine the 
critical nature of a system has not been given by most governing authorities, however, 
most authorities recognize or recommend some form of device grouping; remember, 
new processes and requirements should be merged with existing processes to as 
much extent as possible. See Appendix A: Examples.

Examples of cyber devices typically include a DCS, PLCs, SLCs, modern 
switchgear and relays, recorders, analyzers, and other Ethernet devices. Digital 
meters, indicators, process transmitters, and other such devices whose software 
functions are only validated by calibration, devices whose primary programming 
interface is a local manual keypad or devices without digital communications 
connections should not be included generally. Cyber devices need to be assigned to a 
system and documented on the device list prior to classification. 
Scheme: 
Q3 - severity of an attack: Does the device directly support the reliable operation of 
a critical cyber system (level 4 system) or would the device disrupt operations of a 
critical site (level 1 site) or critical cyber system if compromised (level 4 system)? 
Q4 - likeliness of attack: Is the device used for physical or electronic access control 
or monitoring of a PSP or an ESP or does the device perform system or plant 
control via human machine interfaces (level 2 & 3 systems)? 
Q5 - ease of attack: Does the device use routable protocol to communicate outside 
an ESP, does the device use routable protocol inside a control center, or is the 
device dial-up accessible (level 3 & 4 systems)?

* Levels of criticality can be used as a guide during network design, to ensure the 
highest levels of criticality are inherently addressed first and protected and audited the 
most. 
Q3, Q4 and Q5 are not difficult to answer so long as the evaluator is familiar with the 
systems involved. Q3, Q4 and Q5 inherit some logic from the systems and sites 
classifications which ties the three classifications together. Precise methodology to 
determine the critical nature of a device has not been given by most governing 
authorities, however, most authorities require or recommend some form of risk based 
and/or tiered approach. In regards to a tiered approach it is often cheaper to apply one 
class of security control across all devices regardless of the classification than to apply 
multiple requirements to various classes of devices. See Appendix A: Examples. 
4.4.1.4. Information Categorization 
Confidentiality, integrity and availability are key goals for information. All information 
should be classified based on low, medium and high levels of potential impact to any of 
these information security goals. The following table provides a recommended risk-
based approach to information categorization, which is highly based on FIPS 199.

Confidentiality: 
Ensures information 
is accessible only to 
those authorized to 
have access 
Unintended or 
malicious release of

effect.

SC information type = {(confidentiality, impact), (integrity, impact), (availability, 
impact)}, where the acceptable values for potential impact are LOW, MODERATE, 
HIGH, or NOT APPLICABLE; information type is administrative, public, investigative, 
process control data, etc. 15
4.4.1.5.   Classification Summary & Utilization 
The following table is based on previously developed classifications and provides 
guidance regarding which devices, sites and systems need to be addressed in which 
order, as indicated by the alphabetical order of the letter designations. This is just one 
example of how classifications can be made of use.

The benefit of designing a comprehensive and open ended classification system is 
that classification assignments can be automated and tracked by database systems 
and assigned based on user input to specific questions. New regulations, which are 
always anticipated, should not significantly alter current operations. The idea is simple, 
truly protect cyber systems effectively and responsibly and the nuances of compliance 
standards become somewhat irrelevant. For example, any new regulations requiring
