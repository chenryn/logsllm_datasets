period of congestion tend to aﬀect jitter signatures too. We observed
a negative correlation between the increment of RTT values during periods of
congestion and the visibility of changes in jitter signatures. We suppose this
decrement in the contrast of RTT latency values between periods of elevated
latency and other periods is related to the size of router buﬀers. We speculate
that modern recommendations to keep buﬀers small [5] will likely aﬀect jitter
time series.
5. The contribution of other random components of RTT latency can
reveal congestion dynamics . Some traces contain random contributions
that mask queueing delay ﬂuctuations in the jitter time series during periods
of elevated latency. Although this is not a widespread phenomenon, it could
compromise Jitterbug’s ability to infer congestion, especially with the KS-test
method.
6. Limitations of change point detection methodologies to detect all
periods of elevated latency. None of the change point detection algo-
rithms we examined could identify all change points in the min time series in
our data. There is a wide variety of signal proﬁles in RTT latency measure-
ments and several types of congestion signatures, including periods of elevated
latency with ﬂat, smooth and spiky signatures. We suppose that change point
detection algorithms may not be able to capture change points for all types of
signatures in this large set of proﬁles. To be able to identify all periods of ele-
vated latency is crucial since the accuracy of Jitterbug congestion inferences
mostly relies on detecting these intervals.
7. Change point detection is expensive. The BCP and HMM methods
required signiﬁcant time to execute on the 15-day traces we analyzed for this
study, typically between 60 and 90 seconds. Optimizing performance of these
methods will be critical for operational utility.
8. The KS-test method only captures a limited type of congestion
event signature. But it is a simple and clean congestion inference approach,
cost-eﬀective for many scenarios beyond those we studied, and can inform
further research in this area.

8 Related Work
Inferring Network Congestion with RTT Measurements. Previous research
eﬀorts focused on interdomain congestion inference leveraging from recurrent
periods of elevated latency [12,23]. To generate these inferences, these works
relied on a set of CAIDA’s (Ark) [1] to run RTT latency measurements
to all visible IP-level interconnection links [24]. Time Series Latency Probes
(TSLP) [12,23] is the result of these latency measurement campaigns. An auto-
correlation method is apply to traces on the TSLP data collection to ﬁnd multi-
day repetition of elevated delays around the same times, i.e., driven by diur-
nal demand. However, this method to detect congestion requires some level of
manual inspection. With a similar approach, Fontugne et al. [15] proposed a
latency-based methodology to detect congestion in last-mile access networks.
They used RIPE Atlas probes to run traceroute measurements campaigns and
inferred congestion applying a methodology to detect latency deviations.
Anomaly Detection on Network Paths. RTT time series has been also used to
detect a wide range of network events, such as path anomalies [13,14] and route
changes [17,30].
Change Point Detection. Change Point Detection algorithms aim to detect
change point detection (also known as time series segmentation) as abrupt
changes in a sequence of observations (e.g., a time series) to divide a sequence
into a ﬁnite number of non-overlapping partitions [3]. These algorithms are typi-
cally based on mathematical or machine learning models [3,4,11,31,36]. Another
study found that some unsupervised anomaly detection tools for change point
are notably time consuming [32]. Even though these methods are eﬀective in
capturing change points in the time series [9], event classiﬁcation still requires
human inspection.
Mathematical Approaches for Congestion Detection. Another type of studies
brought sophisticated mathematical and statistical concepts to investigate con-
gestion events. Mouchet et al. [27] proposed to use Hidden Markov Models
(HMM) to identify diﬀerent states in RTT latency time series, however, these
states correspond to diﬀerent latency values and do not report discriminate
events caused by diﬀerent types of events (e.g., route change vs congestion event).
More recently, Spang et al. [34] proposed to use A/B tests in TCP lab measure-
ments to generate unbiased evaluations of TCP Congestion Control Algorithms
(CCA). However, the applicability of this approach relies on the assumption on
independent traﬃc ﬂows, which in practice may be compromised by the syn-
chronization of TCP ﬂow and short-lived TCP transfers. In addition, engineers
typically used more pragmatic evaluations to test the impact of their changes.
9 Open Challenges
Other approaches not covered in this paper may be useful to extract informa-
tion embedded in jitter signals. Early in this project we proposed and tested at
176
E. Carisimo et al.
least other four diﬀerent approaches to jitter-based congestion inference. One
aimed to capture the jitter variability at the beginning of a period, and another
applied the same concept of the KS-test method but using j-min (deﬁnition
in Sect. 3.1) instead. A third alternative used anomaly detection techniques to
detect changes in jitter volatility. The fourth alternative used parametric mod-
els, including Normal and Levy-Stable distributions, to ﬁt jitter behavior. These
alternative approaches are promising and it is worth exploring them as part of
future work.
In the future we also expect ﬂuctuations of queueing delay to become more
challenging to distinguish in RTT latency measurements as a consequence of
smaller router buﬀers following modern buﬀer sizing recommendations [5,16].
Jitterbug central assumption is that a period of congestion is a period of ele-
vated latency, however, if latency signatures show imperceptible queueing delays,
this may comprise the accuracy of change point detection algorithms to detect
periods of elevated latency. In addition, the rise of delay-sensitive real-time appli-
cations (e.g., videocalls, online gaming, etc.) could also incentivize the reduction
of router buﬀer sizes. We observed (Sect. 2.2) a correlation between jitter sig-
natures and buﬀer sizes and recognize that smaller buﬀer sizes could impede
Jitterbug congestion inferences.
More demanding requirements of jitter-sensitive applications (e.g. live video
streaming) could also modify traﬃc patterns and latency signatures. Today’s
HTTP-based video delivery relies on playback modulation to mitigate jitter
impact on video ﬂow [28,29]. However, in the future, real-time video broadcast-
ing may requiere shorter playback jitters—and consequently dedicated traﬃc
engineering strategies—that could modify the shape of the jitter curve and thus
Jitterbug inferences.
Foreseeable changes in the foundational protocols of the TCP/IP stack could
modify traﬃc dynamics and the nature of latency signatures. New latency-based
Congestion Control Algorithms could modify latency signatures and buﬀer occu-
pancy. The rollout of QUIC [8,18,22,33] could spread new features in the net-
work potentially reshaping the nature of traﬃc dynamics. For example, QUIC
proposes to aggregate and multiplex multiple short-lived web data transfers—
typically run in parallel per-resource TCP sessions [8]—into a single transport-
layer protocol session.
We expect that future work from ML/AI communities develop more cost-
eﬀective change point detection tools. The growing necessity of monitoring large-
scale time series databases to generate (near) real-time anomaly detection is
likely to be the driver of optimization in this space [32]. We expect that in the
coming years we are going to count with more rapid and optimized supervised
and unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms to detect change points.

gestion combining pre-existing approaches with information embedded in jitter

signals. We found that jitter allowed us to expand congestion inference beyond
scenarios of recurrent congestion patterns, such as one-time congestion events.
We discovered that jitter (and jitter-derived signals) time series is useful to dis-
criminate periods of elevated latency caused by congestion from route changes.
We have also learned about the various challenges of inferring network conges-
tion with RTT latency measurements. The vastly heterogeneous structure of the
network is reﬂected in diverse latency signatures showing large and short buﬀer
sizes, remarkable presence of randomness unrelated from congestion events, etc.
We have also learned about limitations of change point detection algorithms in
detecting all beginning and ending points of periods of elevated latency as well
as the time required to obtain results from these algorithms.
Applying Jitterbug to the cases in our dataset, we obtained similar results
to recent autocorrelation methods [12]. However, in contrast to that method,
which is based on the repetitiveness of the signal and uses information of near-
and far-side RTT latency measurements, Jitterbug is fully based on far-side
RTT latency measurements and does not rely on repetitiveness to discern the
congestion status of a period.
We hope that this work will encourage studies focused on network congestion
inference, jitter analysis and change point detection algorithms. In the future, we
would like to investigate how sampling rates (higher and lower) aﬀect congestion
inferences and proﬁles of RTT latency signatures. For example, studies in ﬁnan-
cial time series have found that the distribution of assets returns vary depending
on the scaling factor (i.e. time elapsed between samples) [20,25], we would like
to investigate if this also happens on jitter time series. We are also interested
in studying whether we could develop purely jitter-based congestion inference
methods. Another topic that we would like to investigate is if inter-packet delay
in back-to-back measurements, for example using FAST probing tool [26], could
allow us to infer congestion.
