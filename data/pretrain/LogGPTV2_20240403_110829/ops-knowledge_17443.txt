I have identified UltraMySQL as a potential solution for my needs, but it lacks documentation and a Windows binary package. My program involves a significant amount of internet downloads and MySQL insertions. To handle multiple download tasks, I am using gevent. After downloading and parsing the web pages, I need to insert the data into MySQL.

My question is: Does `monkey.patch_all()` make MySQL operations asynchronous? Can someone guide me on the correct approach?

**Response:**

One possible solution is to use `pymysql`. Since `pymysql` utilizes Python's socket, after applying `monkey.patch_all()`, it should work seamlessly with gevent, enabling asynchronous MySQL operations.
