[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer analyzer-name output vlan vlan-ID
For example, specify the remote-analyzer VLAN as the output for the analyzer:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor output vlan 999
4. Specify mirroring properties.
a. Specify the mirroring rate—that is, the number of packets to be mirrored per second:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor input rate number
The valid range is 1 through 65,535.
b. Specify the length to which mirrored packets are to be truncated:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor input maximum-packet-length number
The valid range is 0 through 9216. The default value is 0, which means the mirrored packets are not
truncated.
Binding Statistical Analyzers to Ports Grouped at the FPC Level
You can bind a statistical analyzer to a specific FPC in the switch, that is, you can bind the statistical
analyzer instance at the FPC level of the switch. The mirroring properties specified in the statistical
analyzer are applied to all physical ports associated with all Packet Forwarding Engines on the specified
FPC.
To bind a named instance of Layer 2 analyzer to an FPC:
1033
1. Enable configuration of switch chassis properties:
[edit]
user@switch# edit chassis
2. Enable configuration of an FPC (and its installed PICs):
[edit chassis]
user@switch# edit fpc slot-number
3. Bind a statistical analyzer instance to the FPC:
[edit chassis fpc slot-number]
user@switch# set port-mirror-instance stats_analyzer-1
4. (Optional) To bind a second statistical analyzer instance of Layer 2 mirroring to the same FPC, repeat
Step 3 and specify a different statistical analyzer name:
[edit chassis fpc slot-number]
user@switch# set port-mirror-instance stats_analyzer-2
5. Verify the minimum configuration of the binding:
[edit chassis fpc slot-number port-mirror-instance analyzer_name]
user@switch# top
[edit]
user@switch# show chassis
chassis {
fpc slot-number { # Bind two statistical analyzers or port mirroring
named instances at the FPC level.
port-mirror-instance stats_analyzer-1;
port-mirror-instance stats_analyzer-2;
}
}
1034
NOTE: On binding a second instance (stats_analyzer-2 in this example), the mirroring properties of
this session, if configured, overrides any default analyzer.
Configuring an Analyzer with Multiple Destinations by Using Next-Hop Groups
You can mirror traffic to multiple destinations by configuring next-hop groups as analyzer output. The
mirroring of packets to multiple destinations is also known as multipacket port mirroring.
To mirror interface traffic or VLAN traffic on the switch to an interface on the switch (by using
analyzers):
1. Choose a name for the analyzer and specify the input:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer analyzer-name input ingress interface interface-name
For example, create an analyzer called employee-monitor for which the input traffic comprises packets
entering interfaces ge-0/0/0.0 and ge-0/0/1.0:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor input ingress interface ge–0/0/0.0
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor input ingress interface ge–0/0/1.0
2. Configure the destination interface for the mirrored packets:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer analyzer-name output next-hop-group next-hop-group-name
For example, configure the next-hop group nhg as the destination for the employee-monitor analyzer:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor output next-hop-group nhg
1035
Defining a Next-Hop Group for Layer 2 Mirroring
The next-hop group configuration at the [edit forwarding-options] configuration level enables you to
define a next-hop group name, the type of addresses to be used in the next-hop group, and the logical
interfaces that form the multiple destinations to which traffic can be mirrored. By default, the next-hop
group is specified using Layer 3 addresses using the [edit forwarding-options next-hop-group next-hop-group-
name group-type inet] statement. To specify a next-hop group using Layer 2 addresses instead, include the
[edit forwarding-options next-hop-group next-hop-group-name group-type layer-2] statement.
To define a next-hop group for Layer 2 mirroring:
1. Enable configuration of a next-hop group for Layer 2 mirroring:
[edit forwarding-options ]
user@switch# set next-hop-group next-hop-group-name
For example, configure next-hop-group with name nhg:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set next-hop-group nhg
2. Specify the type of addresses to be used in the next-hop group configuration:
[edit forwarding-options next-hop-group next-hop-group-name]
user@switch# set group-type layer-2
For example, configure next-hop-group type as layer-2 because the analyzer output must be layer-2 only:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set next-hop-group nhg group-type layer-2
3. Specify the logical interfaces of the next-hop group:
[edit forwarding-options next-hop-group next-hop-group-name]
user@switch# set interface logical-interface-name-1
user@switch# set interface logical-interface-name-2
1036
For example, to specify ge-0/0/10.0 and ge-0/0/11.0 as the logical interfaces of the next-hop group
nhg:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set next-hop-group nhg interface ge-0/0/10.0
user@switch# set next-hop-group nhg interface ge-0/0/11.0
Configuring Mirroring on EX4300 Switches to Analyze Traffic (CLI Procedure)
IN THIS SECTION
Configuring an Analyzer for Local Traffic Analysis | 1037
Configuring an Analyzer for Remote Traffic Analysis | 1038
Configuring Port Mirroring | 1039
NOTE: This task uses Junos OS for EX Series switches with support for the Enhanced Layer 2
Software (ELS) configuration style.
EX4300 switches enable you to configure mirroring to send copies of packets to either a local interface
for local monitoring or to a VLAN for remote monitoring. You can use mirroring to copy these packets:
• Packets entering or exiting a port
• Packets entering a VLAN
BEST PRACTICE: Mirror only necessary packets to reduce potential performance impact. We
recommend that you:
• Disable your configured mirroring configurations when you are not using them.
• Specify individual interfaces as input to analyzers rather than specifying all interfaces as
input.
• Limit the amount of mirrored traffic by using firewall filters.
1037
NOTE: If you want to create additional analyzers without deleting the existing analyzers, then
disable the existing analyzers by using the disable analyzer analyzer-name statement from the
command-line interface or the J-Web configuration page for mirroring.
NOTE: Interfaces used as output for an analyzer must be configured under the ethernet-switching
family.
Configuring an Analyzer for Local Traffic Analysis
To mirror interface traffic or VLAN traffic on the switch to an interface on the switch (by using
analyzers):
1. Choose a name for the analyzer and specify the input:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer analyzer-name input ingress interface interface-name
For example, create an analyzer called employee-monitor for which the input traffic is packets entering
interfaces ge-0/0/0.0 and ge-0/0/1.0:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor input ingress interface ge–0/0/0.0
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor input ingress interface ge–0/0/1.0
2. Configure the destination interface for the mirrored packets:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer analyzer-name output interface interface-name
For example, configure ge-0/0/10.0 as the destination interface for the employee-monitor analyzer:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor output interface ge-0/0/10.0
1038
Configuring an Analyzer for Remote Traffic Analysis
To mirror traffic that is traversing interfaces or a VLAN on the switch to a VLAN for analysis from a
remote location (by using analyzers):
1. Configure a VLAN to carry the mirrored traffic:
[edit]
user@switch# set vlans analyzer-name vlan-id vlan-ID
For example, define an analyzer VLAN called remote-analyzer and assign it a VLAN ID of 999:
[edit]
user@switch# set vlans remote-analyzer vlan-id 999
2. Set the uplink module interface that is connected to the distribution switch to trunk mode and
associate it with the analyzer VLAN:
[edit]
user@switch# set interfaces interface-name unit 0 family ethernet-switching interface-mode
trunk vlan members vlan-ID
For example, set the interface ge-0/1/1 to trunk mode and associate it with the analyzer VLAN ID
999:
[edit]
user@switch# set interfaces ge-0/1/1 unit 0 family ethernet-switching interface-mode trunk
vlan members 999
3. Configure the analyzer:
a. Define an analyzer and specify the traffic to be mirrored:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer analyzer-name input ingress interface interface-name
1039
For example, define the employee-monitor analyzer for which traffic to be mirrored is packets
entering interfaces ge-0/0/0.0 and ge-0/0/1.0:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor input ingress interface ge-0/0/0.0
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor input ingress interface ge-0/0/1.0
b. Specify the analyzer VLAN as the output for the analyzer:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer analyzer-name output vlan vlan-ID
For example, specify the remote-analyzer VLAN as the output analyzer for the employee-monitor
analyzer:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor output vlan 999
Configuring Port Mirroring
To filter packets to be mirrored to a port-mirroring instance, create the instance and then use it as the
action in the firewall filter. You can use firewall filters in both local and remote mirroring configurations.
If the same port-mirroring instance is used in multiple filters or terms, the packets are copied to the
analyzer output port or analyzer VLAN only once.
To filter mirrored traffic, create a port-mirroring instance under the [edit forwarding-options] hierarchy
level, and then create a firewall filter. The filter can use any of the available match conditions and must
have port-mirror-instance instance-name as an action. This action in the firewall filter configuration provides
the input to the port-mirroring instance.
To configure a port-mirroring instance with firewall filters:
1. Configure the port-mirroring instance name (here, employee-monitor) and the output:
1040
a. For local analysis, set the output to the local interface where you will connect the computer
running the protocol analyzer:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set port-mirroring instance employee-monitor output interface ge-0/0/10.0
b. For remote analysis, set the output to the remote-analyzer VLAN:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set port-mirroring instance employee-monitor output vlan 999
2. Create a firewall filter by using any of the available match conditions and assign employee-monitor to the
port-mirror-instance action:
This step shows a firewall filter example-filter, with two terms (no-analyzer and to-analyzer):
a. Create the first term to define the traffic that should not pass through to the port-mirroring
instance employee-monitor:
[edit firewall family ethernet-switching
user@switch# set filter example-filter term no-analyzer from source-address ip-address
user@switch# set filter example-filter term no-analyzer from destination-address ip-address
user@switch# set filter example-filter term no-analyzer then accept
b. Create the second term to define the traffic that should pass through to the port-mirroring
instance employee-monitor:
[edit firewall family ethernet-switching]
user@switch# set filter example-filter term to-analyzer from destination-port 80
user@switch# set filter example-filter term to-analyzer then port-mirror-instance employee–
monitor
user@switch# set filter example-filter term to-analyzer then accept
3. Apply the firewall filter to the interfaces or VLAN that provide input to the port-mirroring instance:
[edit]
user@switch# set interfaces ge-0/0/0 unit 0 family ethernet-switching filter input example-
filter
ser@switch# set vlan remote-analyzer filter input example-filter
1041
Configuring Port Mirroring to Analyze Traffic (CLI Procedure)
IN THIS SECTION
Configuring Port Mirroring for Local Traffic Analysis | 1042
Configuring Port Mirroring for Remote Traffic Analysis | 1043
Filtering the Traffic Entering an Analyzer | 1044
This configuration task uses Junos OS for EX Series switches that do not support the Enhanced Layer 2
Software (ELS) configuration style.
EX Series switches allow you to configure port mirroring to send copies of packets to either a local
interface for local monitoring or to a VLAN for remote monitoring. You can use port mirroring to copy
these packets:
• Packets entering or exiting a port
• Packets entering a VLAN on EX2200, EX3200, EX3300, EX4200, EX4500, or EX6200 switches
• Packets exiting a VLAN on EX8200 switches
BEST PRACTICE: Mirror only necessary packets to reduce potential performance impact. We
recommend that you:
• Disable your configured port mirroring analyzers when you are not using them.
• Specify individual interfaces as input to analyzers rather than specifying all interfaces as
input.
• Limit the amount of mirrored traffic by:
• Using statistical sampling.
• Setting ratios to select statistical samples.
• Using firewall filters.
Before you begin to configure port mirroring, note the following limitations for analyzer output
interfaces:
• Cannot also be a source port.
1042
• Cannot be used for switching.
• Do not participate in Layer 2 protocols (such as RSTP) when part of a port mirroring configuration.
• Do not retain any VLAN associations they held before they were configured as analyzer output
interfaces.
NOTE: If you want to create additional analyzers without deleting the existing analyzer, first
disable the existing analyzer using the disable analyzer analyzer-name command or the J-Web
configuration page for port mirroring.
NOTE: Interfaces used as output for an analyzer must be configured as family ethernet-switching.
Configuring Port Mirroring for Local Traffic Analysis
To mirror interface traffic or VLAN traffic on the switch to another interface on the switch:
1. Choose a name for the analyzer—in this case employee-monitor—and specify the input—in this case,
packets entering ge-0/0/0 and ge-0/0/1:
[edit ethernet-switching-options]
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor ingress interface ge–0/0/0.0
[edit ethernet-switching-options]
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor input ingress interface ge–0/0/1.0
2. Optionally, you can specify a statistical sampling of the packets by setting a ratio:
[edit ethernet-switching-options]
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor ratio 200
When the ratio is set to 200, 1 of every 200 packets is mirrored to the analyzer. You can use
statistical sampling to reduce the volume of mirrored traffic, as a high volume of mirrored traffic can
be performance intensive for the switch. On EX8200 switches, you can set a ratio only for ingress
packets.
1043
3. Configure the destination interface for the mirrored packets:
[edit ethernet-switching-options]
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor output interface ge-0/0/10.0
Configuring Port Mirroring for Remote Traffic Analysis
To mirror traffic that is traversing interfaces or a VLAN on the switch to a VLAN for analysis from a
remote location:
1. Configure a VLAN to carry the mirrored traffic. This VLAN is called remote-analyzer and given the ID of
999 by convention in this documentation:
[edit]
user@switch# set vlans remote-analyzer vlan-id 999
2. Set the uplink module interface that is connected to the distribution switch to trunk mode and
associate it with the remote-analyzer VLAN:
[edit]
user@switch# set interfaces ge-0/1/1 unit 0 family ethernet-switching port-mode trunk vlan
members 999
3. Configure the analyzer:
a. Choose a name and set the loss priority to high. Loss priority should always be set to high when
configuring for remote port mirroring:
[edit ethernet-switching-options]
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor loss-priority high
b. Specify the traffic to be mirrored—in this example the packets entering ports ge-0/0/0 and ge-0/0/1:
[edit ethernet-switching-options]
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor input ingress interface ge-0/0/0.0
[edit ethernet-switching-options]
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor input ingress interface ge-0/0/1.0
1044
c. Specify the remote-analyzer VLAN as the output for the analyzer:
[edit ethernet-switching-options]
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor output vlan 999
4. Optionally, you can specify a statistical sampling of the packets by setting a ratio:
[edit ethernet-switching-options]
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor ratio 200
When the ratio is set to 200, 1 out of every 200 packets is mirrored to the analyzer. You can use this
to reduce the volume of mirrored traffic as a very high volume of mirrored traffic can be performance
intensive for the switch.
Filtering the Traffic Entering an Analyzer
To filter which packets are mirrored to an analyzer, create the analyzer and then use it as the action in
the firewall filter. You can use firewall filters in both local and remote port mirroring configurations.
If the same analyzer is used in multiple filters or terms, the packets are copied to the analyzer output
port or analyzer VLAN only once.
To filter mirrored traffic, create an analyzer and then create a firewall filter. The filter can use any of the
available match conditions and must have an action of analyzer. The action of the firewall filter provides
the input to the analyzer.
To configure port mirroring with filters:
1. Configure the analyzer name (here, employee-monitor) and the output:
a. For local analysis, set the output to the local interface to which you will connect the computer
running the protocol analyzer application:
[edit ethernet-switching-options]
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor output interface ge-0/0/10.0
b. For remote analysis, set the loss priority to high and set the output to the remote-analyzer VLAN:
[edit ethernet-switching-options]
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor loss-priority high output vlan 999
2. Create a firewall filter using any of the available match conditions and specify the action as analyzer:
1045
This step shows a firewall filter called example-filter, with two terms:
a. Create the first term to define the traffic that should not pass through to the analyzer:
[edit firewall family ethernet-switching]
user@switch# set filter example-filter term no-analyzer from source-address ip-address
[edit firewall family ethernet-switching]
user@switch# set filter example-filter term no-analyzer from destination-address ip-address
[edit firewall family ethernet-switching]
user@switch# set filter example-filter term no-analyzer then accept
b. Create the second term to define the traffic that should pass through to the analyzer:
[edit firewall family ethernet-switching]
user@switch# set filter example-filter term to-analyzer from destination-port 80
[edit firewall family ethernet-switching]
user@switch# set filter example-filter term to-analyzer then analyzer employee–monitor
[edit firewall family ethernet-switching]
user@switch# set filter example-filter term to-analyzer then accept
3. Apply the firewall filter to the interfaces or VLAN that are input to the analyzer:
[edit]
user@switch# set interfaces ge-0/0/0 unit 0 family ethernet-switching filter input example-
filter
[edit]
user@switch# set vlan remote-analyzer filter input example-filter
