User: List several common attack methods and provide corresponding defense measures.
Assistant: 1. SQL injection attack: The attacker uses malicious SQL statements to insert into the input field of the application, thereby accessing or modifying the database by executing malicious SQL commands. Defensive measures: Use prepared statements or stored procedures to limit the database operation rights of application users, and avoid directly entering user-provided data in the program. 2. Cross-site scripting attack (XSS): The attacker inserts malicious code into the web page and executes it on the user terminal through the browser. Defense measures: data filtering and escaping, prohibiting the execution of external scripts and frameworks introduced in the page, using CSP to prevent XSS 3. Buffer overflow attack: the attacker increases or modifies the buffer in the input data to execute malicious code or destroy the program running. Defensive measures: limit the size of the input data, use code to verify that the input allocates the correct space, use code reduction, etc. 4. Session hijacking attack: By stealing the user's session token, the attacker can access protected resources or impersonate the user to perform illegal operations. Defensive measures: Strengthen the session token or authentication mechanism, and periodically update the session token to make it time-sensitive. 5. Malware attack: Attackers use malware to infect user terminals, so that they can access any resources on the machine, including user accounts and passwords. Defense measures: Install multiple defense mechanisms, such as anti-virus software, use trusted software, update system and program security patches, and use network isolation and other means.
