According to Eq. (6), the multi-stack RCS is the sum of cosines
of the spacings between the individual stacks. Each cosine term
can be viewed as a single tone at frequency |𝑑𝑘 −𝑑𝑙 |
0.5𝜆 . We perform a
Fourier Transform over 𝑢, and define the result as the RCS frequency
spectrum:
𝑅𝑆 (𝑣) = 𝑅𝑇 (𝑣) ∗  𝑀 +𝑘 ≠𝑙
𝛿 (cid:18)𝑣 −
𝑑𝑘 − 𝑑𝑙
0.5𝜆 (cid:19)! ,
(7)
The Dirac Delta function 𝛿 (𝑥) peaks at 𝑥 = 0. Therefore, the spacing
between any two stacks, 𝑑𝑘 −𝑑𝑙 , can be resolved by identifying the peak
position 𝑑𝑘 −𝑑𝑙
0.5𝜆 in the frequency spectrum 𝑅𝑆 (𝑣). Since 𝑢 ∈ [−1, 1]
has a range of 2, the frequency resolution of 𝑅𝑆 (𝑣) is 1
2 . Also note
that the spacing between stacks is proportional to the frequency 𝑣
with a scaling factor of
0.5𝜆 . The resultant spacing resolution is as
small as 0.25𝜆 (e.g., 0.95 mm for 79 GHz signals). In other words,
we can map the geometrical layout of the multi-stack PSVAAs to the
RCS frequency spectrum, with sub-wavelength spatial resolution!

5.2 Spatial Coding
While 𝑀 PSVAA stacks have 𝑀 (𝑀 − 1) pairwise spacings, they
are mutually dependent and can be uniquely determined by a set
of 𝑀 − 1 values. For example, given {𝑑𝑘 − 𝑑0}𝑀−1
𝑘 =1 , the relative
location between an arbitrary pair of stacks (e.g., 𝑘-th and 𝑙-th)
can be calculated as 𝑑𝑘 − 𝑑𝑙 = (𝑑𝑘 − 𝑑0) − (𝑑𝑙 − 𝑑0). We term the
0-th stack with 𝑑0 = 0 as the reference stack and the rest as the
coding stacks. Thus, 𝑀 stacks of PSVAAs can convey at most 𝑀 − 1
independent coding bits, corresponding to 𝑀 − 1 peaks in the RCS
frequency spectrum. Position of each peak is determined by the
relative location between one coding stack and the reference stack,
i.e., 𝑑𝑘 − 𝑑0. We use the presence (bit ł1ž) or absence (bit ł0ž) of each
coding stack to encode information. With a maximum of 𝑀 stacks on
the tag, 𝑀 − 1 bits can be encoded.
Unfortunately, according to Eq. (6), the 𝑀 − 1 frequency peaks at
{ |𝑑𝑘 |
}𝑀−1
𝑘 =1 designated for coding may collide with the rest (𝑀 − 1)2
0.5𝜆
secondary frequency peaks created by pairs of coding stacks. For
example, given two coding peaks at 𝑑1 = 𝜆 and 𝑑2 = 2𝜆, a secondary
peak at 𝑑2 − 𝑑1 = 𝜆 also appears and causes interference with the
coding peak at 𝑑1 = 𝜆. To avoid such interference, we separate
the coding peaks from the secondary peaks in the frequency domain.
Specifically, we set the spacing between adjacent coding stacks to
be equal, and place the 𝑘-th coding stack at 𝑑𝑘 = 𝑠𝑘 (𝑀 + 𝑘 − 2)𝛿𝑐 ,
where 𝛿𝑐 is the basic unit spacing between coding stacks. The sign
𝑠𝑘 ∈ {1, −1} indicates whether the 𝑘-th stack is on the left side
(i.e., 𝑠𝑘 = −1) or the right side (i.e., 𝑠𝑘 = 1) of the reference stack.
Therefore, the distance between any 𝑘-th and 𝑙-th coding stacks on
the same side of the reference stack satisfies |𝑑𝑘 − 𝑑𝑙 |  𝑑𝑀−1. Consequently,
all the secondary peaks are out of the coding band from 𝑑1 to 𝑑𝑀−1
where the coding peaks are located.
To verify the design, we conduct 3D EM field simulation in
HFSS for an example tag with 𝑀 = 5 and 𝛿𝑐 = 1.5𝜆. Fig. 10 shows
the layout, RCS, and the RCS frequency spectrum of the tag. The
4 coding stacks are placed at 6𝜆, −7.5𝜆, 9𝜆 and −10.5𝜆 relative
to the reference stack. We see that 4 prominent peaks appear at
the locations of the coding stacks encoding 4 bits “1111ž. All the
secondary peaks are separated from the coding peaks in frequency
and can be omitted. Note that the RoS tag can be easily configured to
encode other bits by adding or removing coding stacks. For example,
to encode bits “1010ž, we can simply remove the two stacks at −7.5𝜆
and −10.5𝜆 in Fig. 10.
5.3 Modeling Performance Limit and Design
Tradeoffs
Encoding capacity. Given a tag with 𝑀 − 1 coding bits and a
𝛿𝑐 = 𝑐𝜆, the width of the tag, 𝐷, can be calculated as, 𝐷 = |𝑑𝑀−1 | +
|𝑑𝑀−2 | + 3𝜆 = ((4𝑀 − 7)𝑐 + 3)𝜆. Two factors limit 𝐷 and ultimately
the number of coding bits (i.e., 𝑀 − 1) that a single tag can achieve.
First, the above multi-stack RCS model assumes that the radar is
within the far field region of the tag where propagation paths from
the PSVAA stacks to the radar are approximately parallel, i.e.,
𝑑 ≥
2𝐷 2
𝜆
,
(8)
where 𝑑 is the radar-to-tag distance. Second, the maximum fre-
quency peak appears at 𝐷
0.5𝜆 . Since the radar is moving, two consec-
utive radar frames are collected at different locations. Suppose their
spatial interval is 𝛿𝑠 . According to the Nyquist sampling theorem,
𝛿𝑠 should satisfy:
sin
𝛿𝑠
𝑑
≤
2𝜆
0.5𝐷
.
(9)
An example tag with 4 coding bits in our RoS implementation is
shown in Fig. 10. With a tag width of 𝐷 = 22.5𝜆, the far field distance
of the tag would be 𝑑 = 2.9 m according to Eq. (8) . Therefore, the
spatial encoding is most effective when the tag-to-radar distance
exceeds 2.9 m. Denoting the radar frame rate by 𝐹𝑠 , the maximum
vehicle speed 𝑣 supported by the tag is 𝑣 = 𝛿𝐹𝑠 ≈
𝐷 according
to Eq. (9). Modern mmWave radars (e.g., the TI radar [22]) can
easily achieve 𝐹𝑠 ≥ 1 kHz. Ideally, the tag can be decoded when the
moving speed of the vehicle is below 38.5 m/s (i.e., 86 mph).

If more than 4 bits are encoded within a single tag, the far field
distance is extended farther which in turn requires higher radar
sensitivity. For example, for a tag with 6 coding bits and a spacing
𝛿𝑐 = 1.5𝜆, the tag width is 𝐷 = 34.5𝜆. The far field distance would
be 9 m. To encode more bits at practical distances, RoS can instead
place multiple tags side by side similar to advertising boards. This
would require that the radar isolates the signals from adjacent tags,
i.e., two tags having an angular separation larger than the radar’s
half beam width, i.e., 1/𝑁𝑎, according to Sec. 3.2. Typical mmWave
radars, such as the TI radar, have at least 𝑁𝑟 = 4 Rx antennas. The
minimum distance between two tags at 𝑑 = 6 m should be at least
1.53 m following trigonometry.
Link budget and detection range. According to Eq. (1), the
communication distance 𝑑 between the radar and the tag is 𝑑 =
(cid:16) 𝑃𝑡 𝐺𝑡 𝐺𝑟 𝜆2𝜎
(4𝜋 ) 3𝑃𝑟
(cid:17) 1/4
. To decode the tag, the RSS at the radar should
exceed the noise floor, i.e., 𝑃𝑟 ≥ 𝐿𝑜 which limits the maximum
communication distance of the tag. The noise floor is calculated
as 𝐿𝑜 = 𝑐0𝑁𝑁 𝐹 𝐵𝐼 𝐹 𝐺𝑟𝑎𝐺𝑟𝑠 , where 𝑐0 = −173.9 dBm is the thermal
noise constant; 𝑁𝑁 𝐹 , 𝐵𝐼 𝐹 , 𝐺𝑟𝑎, 𝐺𝑟𝑠 are the noise figure, intermediate
frequency (IF) bandwidth, the receive antenna gain, and the signal
processing gain by combining multiple antennas. Specific to our
implementation, on the dB scale, the TI radar [22] has 𝑁𝑁 𝐹 = 15 dB,
𝐵𝐼 𝐹 = 37.5 MHz, 𝐺𝑟𝑎 = 9 dB and 𝐺𝑟𝑠 = 12 dB with 4 receive
antennas. With that, the minimum RSS level is 𝑃𝑟 = −62 dBm. Given
that the RCS of an RoS 32-array tag is 𝜎 = −23 dBsm according to
the Ansys HFSS simulation result, and that the TI radar has a radar
EIRP of 𝑃𝑡 +𝐺𝑡 = 21 dBm, an Rx gain of 𝐺𝑟 = 𝐺𝑟𝑎 +𝐺𝑟𝑙 +𝐺𝑟𝑠 = 55 dB,
where 𝐺𝑟𝑙 = 34 dB, then the maximum achievable distance is
𝑑 ≈ 6.9 m which covers vehicle radars approximately two roadway
lanes away from the tag.
6 INTERROGATING THE ROS TAG WITH AN
AUTOMOTIVE RADAR
A vehicle passing by an RoS tag can measure its RCS, convert it
into the RCS spectrum 𝑅𝑆 (𝑣) (Sec. 5.1), and decode the embedded
information following Sec. 5.2. Traditionally, RCS measurements
are conducted to measure the electromagnetic signatures of objects.
Thus, it is usually controlled in an anechoic chamber where the
transceiver is fixed and the object rotates at a constant speed [12].
In contrast, RoS works in the more dynamic and open driving
scenario. The relative location/orientation between the radar and
the tag may continuously change, which renders the traditional
RCS measurement procedure infeasible. In addition, RoS has to
discriminate the signals reflected by the tag in the presence of
irrelevant objects. Fig. 11a illustrates a typical scenario with two
tripods where one of them is mounted with a tag. We use this setup
as an example to showcase how the radar can accurately sample
the tag’s RCS in RoS.
To measure the RCS of roadside objects, RoS uses the radar to
continuously localize them. Meanwhile, the radar applies beamform-
ing with the polarization switched Tx antenna to obtain reflection
signal strengths across different angles. Specifically, for each radar
frame, RoS uses the standard processing flow in Sec. 3.2 (also c.f.
[42]) to generate a point cloud representing the dominant reflectors
visible to the radar. After all frames are processed, RoS merges
their point clouds based on the relative radar locations where the

frames are transmitted. Such relative location information can be
easily obtained by interpolating the measurements from the inertial
motion sensors and speed sensors on board. Intuitively, dominant
reflectors are visible in most frames and their points tend to be
dense. Thus, RoS applies the classical density-based clustering al-
gorithm, i.e., DBSCAN [15], to cluster the points. It calculates the
point density of each cluster and keeps those with density larger
than a predefined threshold for further RCS measurement. Specific
to our example setup, Fig. 11b shows the two clusters representing
the tag and the tripod with prominent point densities.
For each cluster, RoS calculates its center of gravity and assigns
it as the location of the corresponding object. Now that the relative
location between the object and the sampling position of each radar
frame is known, RoS applies beamforming weights to the returned
signals to “spotlightž on each object and estimate its total RSS
contribution. Such beamforming mechanism is a standard practice
in MIMO radar [42]. The RSS reflected from the RoS tag and the
tripod in our experiment are shown in Fig. 11c.
We further leverage two representative features to differentiate
the RoS tag from other objects on the road to avoid misdetection.
First, as different types of objects vary in size, we calculate the
sizes of the point clusters corresponding to the objects. Second,
while most objects on the road reflect signals with the original
polarization, RoS changes the polarization of the reflected signals.
Since RoS tags tend to have a smaller RSS loss of the polarization
switching Tx relative to the original Tx of the radar, we can use
the calculated RSS loss as a second feature. In Sec. 7, we show that
the features of RoS tags are statistically different from the other
rod-shaped objects on the road, verifying the effectiveness of using
the two features to detect RoS tags.
Now that the tag’s RSS contribution can be isolated from other
