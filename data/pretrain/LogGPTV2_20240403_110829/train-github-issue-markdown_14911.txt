There needs to be a waypoint or a series of waypoints that explain how to
properly use GitHub in general, and how to search for and report issues in
particular, since people are posting a lot of duplicate issues (see #1062, and
it's 7 duplicates, about a bug that was already fixed in `staging`).
I think I have seen this mentioned already, but my inability to find a
relevant issue, if there is one, sort of just strengthens my point.
