User:  How to monitor Linux server performance and improve its efficiency?
Assistant: 1. Use performance monitoring tools: Common performance monitoring tools include top, htop, sar, iostat, and vmstat. Through these tools, performance indicators such as CPU, memory, disk IO, and network traffic can be monitored in real time. 2. Optimize the system kernel parameters: The kernel parameters of the Linux system can be adjusted through the /proc directory and the sysctl command. You can optimize system performance by adjusting TCP parameters, memory allocation strategies, and disk scheduling algorithms. 3. Reasonably set the swap partition: the swap partition is the virtual memory used by the system when the memory is insufficient, but too much swap usage will also affect the system performance. System performance can be improved by reasonably setting the swap partition size and optimizing the swap usage strategy. 4. Use cache and proxy: Use cache and proxy to reduce access to disk, network and other resources and improve system performance. For example, use tools such as Squid proxy and Varnish cache. 5. Regularly clean up useless processes and resources: After running for a period of time, the system often accumulates many useless processes and resources, resulting in system performance degradation. You can improve system performance by using crontab to periodically clean up useless processes and release memory. 6. Use efficient programming languages and frameworks: The efficiency of an application also affects system performance. Using efficient programming languages and frameworks can reduce problems such as CPU usage and memory usage, and improve system performance. 7. Strengthen security control: Security control can not only prevent malicious intrusion and attack, but also reduce illegal access and resource consumption, and improve system performance. Tools such as iptables, SELinux, and SSH security can be used to strengthen system security controls.
