### Summary of the System Log

This log chunk, spanning from 18:08:43 to 18:08:48 on October 18th, indicates several recurring issues within the Hadoop system:

1. **Lease Renewal Failures**:
   - The `LeaseRenewer` component is failing to renew a lease for the client `DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1`.
   - The failure duration increases from 226 seconds to 231 seconds over the time period.
   - The system logs a warning and indicates that it will retry shortly.

2. **Address Changes**:
   - The `org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Client` component detects multiple address changes for the server `msra-sa-41`.
   - The old address is `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000`, and the new address is `msra-sa-41:9000`.
   - Similar address changes are detected for port `8030`.

3. **Resource Manager (RM) Communication Issues**:
   - The `RMCommunicator Allocator` is attempting to connect to the server at `msra-sa-41:8030`.
   - The connection attempts are failing, and the system logs an error indicating that it cannot contact the Resource Manager (RM).
   - The retry policy is set to `RetryUpToMaximumCountWithFixedSleep` with a maximum of 10 retries and a sleep time of 1000 milliseconds between each attempt.

### Detailed Breakdown

- **Lease Renewal Warnings**:
  - The `LeaseRenewer` component logs warnings at 18:08:43, 18:08:44, 18:08:45, 18:08:46, 18:08:47, and 18:08:48, indicating that it failed to renew the lease for the specified client. The failure duration increases by one second in each subsequent log entry.

- **Address Change Warnings**:
  - The `org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Client` component logs warnings at 18:08:43, 18:08:44, 18:08:45, 18:08:46, 18:08:47, and 18:08:48, detecting address changes from `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000` to `msra-sa-41:9000`.
  - Similar address change warnings are logged for port `8030` at 18:08:45, 18:08:47, and 18:08:48.

- **RM Communication Errors**:
  - The `RMCommunicator Allocator` logs errors at 18:08:44, 18:08:46, and 18:08:48, indicating that it failed to contact the RM at `msra-sa-41:8030`.
  - The `org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.v2.app.rm.RMContainerAllocator` component logs the specific error message "ERROR IN CONTACTING RM."

### Conclusion

The log entries suggest that there are ongoing issues with lease renewal and network connectivity. The system is repeatedly trying to renew the lease and connect to the RM, but these attempts are failing. The address changes may be contributing to the communication issues. Further investigation into the network configuration and the state of the RM is recommended to resolve these issues.
