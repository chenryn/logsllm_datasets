The option `app.conf.worker_pool` is not honored. As I've been requested in
previous issues to follow the template, I will try to.

## Minimally Reproducible Test Case
    from celery import Celery
    app = Celery(
        'worker',
    )
    app.conf.update(
        worker_concurrency=1,
        worker_pool='solo',
    )
# Expected Behavior
The banner displayed by `celery -A worker worker` should contain `concurrency:
1 (solo)`
# Actual Behavior
The banner contains `concurrency: 1 (prefork)`. The parameter
`worker_concurrency` is honored, but `worker_pool` is ignored.
The problem apparently comes from `01651d2`
