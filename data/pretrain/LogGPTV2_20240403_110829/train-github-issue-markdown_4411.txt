A popover with the trigger set to "focus" does not appear in Safari. This issue has been observed on Safari 7.0.6 for macOS 10.9.4 and on Safari for iOS 7. 

To provide a more comprehensive context, it would be helpful to include details such as whether this behavior is consistent across all web pages or specific to certain elements, and if any error messages are displayed in the console. Additionally, testing on other versions of Safari and different operating systems could help determine the scope of the problem.
