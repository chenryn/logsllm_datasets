User: I need to know a way to call a function defined in the exe from a python script.
I know how to call entire exe from py file.
Assistant: Unless the said executable takes command line arguments which will specify which function to use, I don't think this is possible.
With that being said, if you created the EXE, command line arguments are a good way to implement the functionality you're looking for.
