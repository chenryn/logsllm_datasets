User: I am running a Python script from Linux command line, and the script itself, on the first line, import several modules. I got some error message and searched online. Here is a reply from the author of the Python script:
it appears that you are running dexseq_count.py as if it were a shell script, rather than from Python. As a consequence, the first line of the script is interpreted as the Linux command 'import' rather than as Python code, leading to the error you report.
I am curious if the first line of import in Python has been mis-interpretated in Linux, and if so, how can I solve this problem? I have to run in the cmd line instead of in Python.
Thanks so much!
Assistant: Two solutions here:
You can run the script using python like this: python my_program.py or  add this at the top of the file: #!/usr/bin/env python which will switch from bash to python to run this script
