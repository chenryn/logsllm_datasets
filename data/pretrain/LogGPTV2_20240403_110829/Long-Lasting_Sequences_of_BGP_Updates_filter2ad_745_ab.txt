of the levels of the scalogram there is any amount of power. This means that

instant k is not interesting for us since there is no signal. (2) That in all the
levels there is the same amount of power. This corresponds just to white noise,
that, again, is not interesting for us, since it is memory-less and it is completely

non-correlated in time. At a second k a value of variance σ2

Hence, we consider the time series of the σ2
and look for intervals of time [ks, ke] such that for all k with ks ≤ k ≤ ke we
Xk > 0. We say that such an interval is a sequence if the time elapsed

between ke and ks is at least one week. We consider a week a span suﬃciently
large to solve temporary network outages.
An Eﬃciency-Accuracy Trade-Oﬀ. As described above, analysing a time
series with k updates with maximum frequency M would require to compute
the DWT on a signal with 2kM pulses. Since we analyse time series lasting one
year k = |end(ucp,ρ) − start(ucp,ρ)| = 31 536 000. Also, following a study of the
updates captured by the CPs, we estimate that the typical value for M is around
10. Hence, in order to analyse each time series we have to process a signal with
about 600 million pulses. If we consider that we have to analyse a total amount
CP-preﬁx pairs that is given by the multiplication of the ∼800 000 announced
preﬁxes by 172 CPs (see Sect. 4) and that for each pair we have to perform a
DWT of a signal with 600 million pulses, we have that this could be unfeasible.
Hence, we use a slightly diﬀerent approach. Namely, we apply a low pass ﬁlter
on each wcp,ρ before performing the DWT. The ﬁlter is set to a cutoﬀ frequency
(maximum cut frequency) of 1 Hz. Also, before computing the DWT we perform
a downsampling of the series of a 1
M factor.
This is equivalent to redeﬁne ucp,ρ(n) as follows:
ucp,ρ(n) =
(cid:3)
0
1
if |Ucp,ρ(n)| = 0,
if |Ucp,ρ(n)| > 0,
adding a zero after each sample. The eﬀects of applying the low pass ﬁlter and
the downsampling before performing the DWT are to set M = 1 and to have
an uncertainty in the order of seconds in detecting the start and the end of a
sequence. We see later how a larger uncertainty is due to the DWT itself.
As an example, the upper part of Fig. 1 shows a time series ucp,ρ with M = 1
and the lower part shows the corresponding scalogram with 5 frequency band-
width levels. Warmer colors correspond to larger percentages of energy.
We do also another choice. We compute the DWT with 1 ≤ j ≤ 15. Setting
(cid:12)
to 15 the lowest bandwidth level of the DWT allows us to detect sequences whose
.
lowest frequency is at the smallest edge of the interval Δf 15 =
Since M = 1, we have that our method is able to spot frequencies ranging from
one update per second to one update per 9 h. This is a reasonable choice for
detecting sequences that last at least one week.
Uncertainty in Determining Start and End Times of Sequences. A side-
eﬀect of the joint time-frequency analysis of the DWT is that it is not possible
to deﬁne a mother wavelet function ψ that has both the following features: it has

energy that is highly localized in time, and it has a Fourier transform (cid:13)ψ having
energy concentrated in a small frequency interval. In fact, time and frequency
energy concentrations are ruled by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle [28]
stating that if the resolution of ψ is sharp in time, then the energy of (cid:13)ψ must
be spread over a relatively large domain and vice versa. More formally, the
uncertainty principle theorem proves the following: σ2

surface that limits the joint time-frequency resolution: the larger σt, the more
uncertainty there is concerning the time localization; and the larger σω, the more
uncertainty there is concerning its frequency distribution. At the equality, one
of the two measures is exactly inversely proportional to the other one. However,
this can be achieved only when the mother wavelet function ψ is chosen in the
Gaussian kernel functions set. Since we are not using this family of functions, we
are not able to match this limit case, so the uncertainty given by the Haar basis

Long-Lasting Sequences of BGP Updates

4 One Year of BGP Sequences
We exploited the techniques of Sect. 3 to process the updates collected in the
entire Year 2019 by RIPE RIS’ RRC00 from all its 172 CPs (∼1.2 TB of data).
We choose RRC00 because it is both the largest in number of updates and the
only one that has its CPs spread around the world in multihop peerings (see
Appendix B for a list with locations). Notice that the number of RRC00 CPs
reported in [5] is diﬀerent from 172, for two reasons: (1) the set of the CPs
changes over time and 172 is the number of CPs that were working in 2019 (not
necessarily for the entire year); and (2) ﬁve of the CPs changed their AS number
in 2019. Hence, the number of unique IPs of the considered CPs is 167.
We isolate 434 790 sequences containing more than 8 billion updates (i.e.,
7 946 086 559 announcements and 368 546 514 withdrawals), which are a consid-
erable 28.36% of all the updates collected by the RRC00 CPs in 2019.
Visualization. We present the extracted sequences in the Web site [7], publicly
released to the research community.
First, for each sequence we show: (1) The involved preﬁx and the CP (IP, AS
pair) that observed the sequence. (2) The start- and end-time. (3) The number of
announcements and withdrawals. (4) The ASes that originated the preﬁx during
the sequence. (5) The number of observed distinct AS-paths during the sequence.
(6) The length of the longest common AS-path suﬃx, that gives a hint on how
distant from the origin AS is the event that caused the sequence. (7) The number
of occurrences of the most frequent announcement and its frequency, that gives
an idea of the frequency of the event that originated the sequence. (8) A ﬂag
that says if the preﬁx corresponds to a known beacon. Beacons are BGP speakers
that periodically announce and withdraw preﬁxes (widely used in experiments).
The RIS beacons [2] and the RFD beacons [20] are well-known examples. (9) A
ﬂag that says if one or more updates have a value in the aggregator ﬁeld (e.g., to
check if all the announcements were sent from the same router of the origin AS).
(10) Links to external resources to get more information on the sequence and its
components (e.g., AsRank [1] and RIPEstat [4]).
Second, for each sequence, we display a chart that we call sequence chart,
where the x-axis represents the time, the y-axis the number of updates over
time, and vertical red lines are the start- and the end-time identiﬁed for the
sequence. The same chart can show other sequences that we spot for the same
CP-preﬁx pair, with gray lines. A sequence chart allows to easily understand if
the sequence has been correctly identiﬁed.
Third, for each sequence, we visualize the AS tree, an alluvial diagram [32]
showing the AS-paths involved in the sequence. The AS tree highlights the com-
mon suﬃx of the AS-paths. Also, each path has a thickness that is proportional
to the number of updates containing that path.
Fourth, for each CP cp we show a chart, called segment chart, whose x-
axis represents the time and each sequence detected from cp corresponds to
a horizontal segment whose initial and ﬁnal x-coordinates are its start- and
end-times. The segments of sequences involving the same preﬁx have the same
222
L. Ariemma et al.
y-coordinate. Segment charts highlight sequences that start and end at the same
time, and that could be originated by the same event. Also, they allow to spot
reboots (white vertical lines) and outages (white vertical strips) of the CPs.
Finally, we provide the AB-BA-chart, which shows the sequences containing
updates with special types of AS-paths. Namely, in several papers (e.g., [14,22])
it has been observed that if a sequence of updates contains both AS-paths of the
form xAyBz and AS-paths of the form uBvAw (where A and B are ASes and
x, y, z, u, v, and w are, possibly empty, AS-paths), then that sequence might be
caused by a so called dispute wheel. We call such sequences AB-BA-sequences. As
an example, consider sequence with ID 5f070547a276df766c139bb3 reported in
the Web site [7]. It contains the alternation of two AS-paths. One is 3333, 12859,
2914, 1299, 7473, 4761, 17451, 17451, 58495, 58495, 58495, 138068, 38527 and
the other is 3333, 1273, 1299, 2914, 58463, 17451, 17451, 58495, 58495, 58495,
138068, 38527. In this case A is 2914 and B is 1299. Since ﬁnding dispute wheels
in the wild is well-known to be a diﬃcult task, we oﬀer the community a method
for visualizing the AB-BA-sequences with a temporal diagram which shows with
a certain symbol the updates with xAyBz AS-paths and with another symbol
the updates with uBvAw AS-paths.
Validation. We have given both a deﬁnition of long-lasting sequences and a
method to ﬁnd them (Sect. 3). Then, we applied such method on the 2019 BGP
updates. However, in order to verify if our deﬁnition and method characterize
what we expect from a long-lasting sequence, we manually inspect a random
subset of the sequences. To do that we assign an ID to each sequence and ran-
domize a sample of 280 IDs (∼0.6‰ of the sequences). For the randomization
we use the MongoDB function called $sample [3]. For each sampled sequence
found by the method, having start time ks and end time ke, we perform the fol-
lowing checks, also exploiting the possibility of the sequence charts to be zoomed
up to 5 min updates resolution: (1) Is the sequence correctly detected? Else, is
the sequence a fragment of a longer sequence that has been incorrectly split into
sub-sequences by the algorithm? If yes, how many fragments? If yes, what is
the frequency of the updates between the fragments? (2) Does the preﬁx of the
sequence correspond to a beacon? (3) If the sequence is correctly detected, are
ks and ke the times of the ﬁrst and of the last update of the sequence (with a
tolerance of 136 min; see discussion in Sect. 3), respectively? If not, what is the
absolute value of the time-distance between the actual starting (resp., ending)
time of the sequence and ks (resp., ke)?
The sampled sequences and the results of the check performed on them are
detailed in the Web site, what follows is a summary of the results: 91.7% of
the sequences are correctly detected while 5.7% of them are fragments of a
longer sequence that, on average, is split into 4.7 fragments. The remaining
2.6% of the sequences are just a portion of a partially detected sequence. None
of the checked sequence is classiﬁed as a false-positive. In 78.9% of the correctly
detected sequences, ks is within the 136 min with respect to the correct start
time; in the remaining cases it is on the average 189 min far from the correct
start time. In 84% of the correctly detected sequences, ke is within the 136 min
Long-Lasting Sequences of BGP Updates
223
with respect to the correct end time; in the other cases it is on the average
204 min far from the correct end time. Also, 31.2% of the fragmented sequences
correspond to beacons. Detecting sequences originated by such beacons is a
challenge for our technique. In fact all the RIPE RIS beacons have period of
4 h and a duty cycle of 50%, while the RFD beacons have a period of 4 h and
a more complex behaviour within the period. Hence, beacons have a frequency
that is in the lowest bandwidth levels of our DWT decomposition (Sect. 3). The
validation indicates that our method does not produce false positives. Instead,
we do not have an estimation of the total amount of false negatives. Our goal
is the discovery of a phenomenon, a possible underestimation induced by false
negatives does not aﬀect our conclusions. In order to identify false negatives we
would have to manually analyse terabytes of data, which would not be feasible.
However, such analysis can be done in a known subset of unstable preﬁxes, the
beacons. We are able to capture sequences for 60 of the 67 available beacons (39
RIS and 28 RFD). On average we ﬁnd 118 sequences per beacon. We manually
inspect the data for the undetected 7 beacons: 2 (RIS) were not active, 2 (RIS)
were not visible from RRC00, 1 (RIS) was visible from only one RRC00 CP from
Nov. 16 to Dec. and from 5 CPs from Dec. 20 to Dec. 30, and 2 (RFD) were
active only from mid Sept. We consider the last three as false negatives.
Analysis. The analysis of the sequences shows what follows.
(i) (a) 59.86% of the sequences involve an IPv4 preﬁx, while 40.14% involve an
IPv6 preﬁx. (b) Most of the sequences with an IPv4 preﬁx (55.3%) involve a
/24 while most of the sequences with an IPv6 preﬁx (45.0%) involve a /48.
Also, IPv4 /16 appear in 1.2% of all the sequences. (c) Fig. 2a shows how
the sequences are distributed among such preﬁxes. We have that 90% of the
222 285 preﬁxes involved in sequences appear in at most 3 of them. Since
our observation points are 172, the oscillation of a preﬁx is very often a phe-
nomenon whose visibility is quite local. (d) Fig. 2b is a CDF showing the frac-
tion of the preﬁxes announced by ASes that is involved in at least one sequence.
For example, 64.7% of the ASes that announced at least one preﬁx in the Inter-
net during year 2019 have no preﬁxes in any sequence, while, 85% of the ASes
have less than 40% of the announced preﬁxes in a sequence.
(ii) (a) A fair amount of sequences – in the (200; 2 000) range – has been found
in most CPs (see Fig. 2c), independently from their location. Two CPs
(2a02:38::2 in AS 6881 and 194.50.19.4 in AS 202365) are outliers since they
observed a large bulk of sequences. (b) On the other hand, the number of
updates involved in the sequences (see Fig. 2c) is distributed evenly with most
CPs having a number of updates in their sequences in the (1M; 100M) range.
(iii) Fig. 2d shows the distribution of the duration of the sequences. We have
that 47% of them last at most two weeks, and that 81% last less than 85
days. Also, 170 last the whole year. Notice the steps visible between 7 and
8 days and between 87 and 95 days. The ﬁrst is due to ∼100 000 sequences
of about 8 days starting at mid March. All these sequences are visible from
the above mentioned CP 194.50.19.4 of AS 202365 as it is apparent from
the segment chart of this CP. The second step is due to ∼65 000 sequences

of about 90 days starting after the beginning of Oct. and ending at the end
of the Year (when our data set ﬁnishes). All these sequences are visible from
the above mentioned CP 2a02:38::2 of AS 6881 as it is apparent from the
segment chart of this CP.
(iv) (a) The announcements involved in sequences were originated by 25 494
distinct ASes. (b) Additionally, in Fig. 2e we report the longest common
Long-Lasting Sequences of BGP Updates
225
AS-path the identiﬁed instabilities have in common. We can see that 93%
of the sequences involved in instabilities have less than 3 AS-hops in com-
mon, and that 40% have at least 1 AS-hop in common. The AS-paths do
not include prepending. This may suggest that in several cases the events
originating the sequences are far from the origin AS of the preﬁx. See, e.g.,
Sect. 4 in [12]. (c) In Fig. 2f we show the CDF of the number of the distinct
AS-paths encountered in each sequence. We have that 80% of the sequences
have less than 16 distinct AS-paths. On the other hand, there are sequences
having an extremely high number of AS-paths.
(v) (a) We compute for each sequence the average frequency of the updates.
The distribution of such frequencies is in Fig. 2g. We have that 18% of the
sequences have an average frequency of 0.002 Hz, while 3.5% have more than
0.03 Hz. Notice the two sharp increases at around 0.02 Hz and at around
0.045 Hz. They are due to the two mentioned bulks of sequences. In each of
these two large sets of updates, the sequences have almost the same average
frequency. (b) We compute, for each sequence (Fig. 2h), the frequency of
the announcement that appears more often. This may give a hint on the
frequency of the event that caused the sequence. In fact, if the routing has
one stable state periodically interleaved with some type of instability we
may have that the most frequent announcement is the one corresponding
to the stable state.
(vi) We ﬁnd that only a few sequences (7 125, around 1.64%) correspond to
beacons. Such sequences contain only 0.17% of the total sequences’ updates.
(vii) We also count the sequences with special features. First, we ﬁnd 31 602
AB-BA-sequences that may constitute an interesting data set for research
on dispute wheels. Second, we ﬁnd 44 302 sequences that contain at least
one announcement where the BGP path aggregator attribute is populated,
and 23 739 sequences that contain at least two announcement with diﬀerent
values for the aggregator attribute. This can be interesting from several
points of view: (a) the announcements performed by beacons have such an
attribute; and (b) the availability of diﬀerent values for such attributes, for
non beacons, might be used to distinguish updates exiting from diﬀerent
routers of the origin AS.
5 Conclusions
We release to the scientiﬁc community [7] a large set of long lasting sequences of
BGP updates visible from the observation points of RIPE RIS during 2019. Such
sequences can be individually analysed with the several visualization tools we
developed. The sequences have been discovered with a Discrete Wavelet Trans-
form based method that we devised and empirically validated.
Reproducibility. The data used in this study is publicly available at [6]. An
indexed collection of sequences for the entire Year 2019 is available at [7]. The
source code needed to reproduce the entire analysis is available on GitLab [37].
