APPENDIX
A. Validating the Russian Blocklist
To validate our source of historical blocklists at [63], we
obtained access to a small set of blocklists digitally signed
by Roskomnadzor through a few different anonymous sources.
To get the corresponding historical blocklists from the Zapret
source, we searched it for the date and timestamp closest to
that in the anonymously-supplied blocklists. None of the date
and timestamps were a perfect match between the two sources,
leading us to believe that the Zapret information has a different
source than the small set of blocklists we obtained from our
anonymous sources.
Using the closest version of the Zapret source, we pre-
processed the contents of both blocklists. This included
extracting all IP addresses and all domains in each of the
ﬁles, resulting in sets of IP addresses and domains to compare
between the two different sets of blocklists.
We compared the two sources’ sets of IP addresses and
domains using the Jaccard index of similarity, which is
calculated by taking the size of the intersection of the two
sets and dividing by the size of the union of the two sets. The
Jaccard index is a number between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0
represents no similarity and 1.0 represents completely similar
sets.

blacklists’
similarity
Applying the Jaccard index to our blocklists from different
sources (which was signed by Roskomnadzor), we found
that the Zapret blocklists are extremely similar to the signed
blocklists. Our results are shown in Table VI. We analyzed the
similarity of the sets of IP addresses, domains, and the entire
set of all IP addresses and domains combined. All sampled
blocklists have a similarity greater than 0.99 for any given
content type (IP, domain, or IP & domain). Based on these
ﬁndings, we conclude that the Zapret source of blocklists is
representative of the list produced by Roskomnadzor, and is
both correct and complete, and thus sufﬁcient for our analysis
in the paper.
B. Analysis of RUBL
Figure 8a shows how the number of unique IPs added
per day outpaces the number of unique IPs removed per day,
further displaying the rapid growth of RUBL. In addition, the
time series plot shows signiﬁcant volatility. Signiﬁcant events
such as court rulings restricting a certain service will lead to
a spike in number of IPs added. On the other hand, media
traction of speciﬁc collateral damage instances will lead to a
spike in number of IPs removed. Regardless, days without any
signiﬁcant activity is prevalent, leading to many downturns
in the graph. Since the blacklisting of speciﬁc sites require
no court ruling, IP address additions rarely fall to zero. The
opposite is true for address removals, which often fall to zero
due to the degree of time and difﬁculty involved for content
owners to initiate an ofﬁcial removal procedure. Similar to
Figure 2, Figure 8a also shows a rise in addition of unique
IPs and decrease in removal of unique IPs in 2019, suggesting
that the blocklist is being handled more carefully recently. We
observe the same trends with domains in Figure 8b, although
there is more variability.
C. Blockpages observed through DNS Poisoning
Figure 10 shows three block pages received at Probe 9,
Probe 14, and VPS 6 due to DNS poisoning, as discussed in
Section VI-B.
D. RUBLsub Measurements
As we mentioned in Section V-A, the RUBLsub consists of
39 subnets, ranging from /16s to /24s. 31 out of 39 of these
subnets contain at least one IP reachable to one of our controls.
Of the remaining eight subnets completely unreachable from our
controls, seven belong to Telegram and all eight are geolocated
to Moscow.
Figure 9 shows the percentage of blocking in each of the
31 subnets in RUBLsub that were reachable in our controls,

(a) IPs Added vs. IPs Removed.
(b) Domains Added vs. Domains Removed.
Figure 8: Blocklist volatility over 7 years—The two subﬁgures
shows the volatility of the blocklist, with many spikes and
downturns in response to real world events. (cid:5)
where percentage of blocking is the number of IPs unreachable
out of total number of IPs in the reachable subnets. Two
subnets, Subnet 16 and 27, see much lower rates of blocking
at most of our probes. These subnets belong to Cloud South,
a U.S.-based hosting provider, and UK2, a UK-based hosting
provider. Several of the other subnets belong to providers such
as DigitalOcean, so it is unclear why these two subnets see
less residential blocking, though it might pertain to collateral
damage associated with blocking them. Another interesting
feature of this analysis is that blocking appears to be correlated
with the size of the subnet: larger subnets are blocked more,
by both probes and VPSes.
E. Consent form
