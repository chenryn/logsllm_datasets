User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题VMWare vCenter Converter does not continue I've been trying to clone a vm with the vCenter Converter 5.1 software, but I am having trouble with the 2nd vm I tried to do. The first completed with no errors. The second however, will not let me continue on the Destination Location screen on the wizard for converting. 

I select the correct datastore, but it does not allow me to continue (the "Next" button is grayed out). However, it does not tell me why, nor does it show anything special in the logs. Anyone out there with experience with this?

The weird thing is, I was able to clone the VM to a different server, but I am still not able to clone it to the server I want it to clone to.

Assistant: The cloning works in the older version, 4.0. No idea why, but it does work perfectly.

Edit: this seems to be because of a compatibility issue with ESXi 3.5, vCenter Converter 5 does not support it.
