a non-encrypted system.  Users should con-
tact JPS for recommendations if encryption 
is an issue for their jurisdiction.  
3.2 Deployment Options 
One of the greatest strengths of the TRP-
1000 system is its nearly limitless capability 
to interconnect virtually any device that pro-
duces an audio signal to another device.  
This provides an overwhelming number of 
configuration and deployment options that 
can be daunting when deciding how the unit 
should best be used in the field.  Initially 
most jurisdictions use the out-of-the-box 
configuration to see how the system oper-
ates and then experiment with various set-
up options to determine how the equipment 
can best enhance their unique require-
ments. 
3.2.1 Frequencies to Install 
Once jurisdictions have conducted sufficient 
testing to assure themselves that the TRP-
1000 will actually work well in their system, 
the question arises regarding what agencies 
should be programmed into the system for 
"daily" use - and what radios should be 
added to the system to obtain the maximum 
benefit from the unit. 
As noted, the basic configuration for the 
TRP-1000 includes 10 multi-frequency ra-
dios that can be programmed to cover sev-
eral radio bands.  Most jurisdictions that 
have 800 MHz capability have added an 
800 MHz radio to the TRP-1000 (or re-
placed one of the units provided) to obtain 
interoperability with their existing frequen-
cies.  
Other radios can be connected to the TRP-
1000 to allow communication with virtually 
any agency.  Jurisdictions should carefully 
consider all of the agencies that would re-
spond at major incident scenes and pre-
plan capabilities to allow interoperability, 
ACU/TRP-1000 Handbook 
Page 3-3 
such as frequency lists, private line tones, 
and emergency contact information. 
3.2.2 Connecting Portable Radios 
While many jurisdictions have purchased 
mobile radios to add to the ACU/TRP-1000 
system, other agencies have chosen the 
option of connecting a portable radio to the 
ACU/TRP-1000 to accommodate other ju-
risdiction's frequencies once on the scene.  
While the flexibility of adding the portable 
radios is a valuable option, if a jurisdiction 
plans to operate with another agency for 
any prolonged period, it should consider 
acquiring mobile radios to accommodate the 
frequency used by that agency.  This would 
reduce problems with battery replacement, 
limited range, and operating multiple port-
able radios inside a communications or 
command van. 
In addition, finding an available portable ra-
dio once on the scene may be problematic.  
If a specific frequency cannot be pro-
grammed into the multi-frequency radios 
supplied with the TRP-1000 unit, an older 
mobile unit can be quickly setup for use, 
negating the need for costly new units that 
may have minimal use.  
3.3 Mobile Options - Trailer, Vehi-
cle, Command Post 
Jurisdictions have implemented many mo-
bile deployment options.  The most common 
include mounting the TRP-1000 in an en-
closed trailer, placing it in a small utility ve-
hicle, or installing it in a mobile command 
post.  All of these options address a re-
quirement for maintaining the mobility of the 
TRP-1000, and most provide for a platform 
from which to operate the unit. 
Using a trailer to transport the TRP-1000 
(as shown in Figure 3-2) is a low cost 
means of moving the unit from storage to 
event.  Trailer configurations have been as 
simple as storing the unit in the back of an 
enclosed trailer with generators, a stash of 
radios, and the appropriate cabling.  Some 
agencies have included a tent, folding table, 
and chairs in the trailer for extended opera-
tions.  
One of the drawbacks to a trailer mounted 
TRP-1000 is the need for a prime mover.  
Deployment plans for this arrangement 
must ensure that the designated prime 
mover is not already assigned to another 
task during an event.  With this type of in-
stallation, the TRP-1000 must be configured 
either prior to departure, or on-site at the 
event.  
Special consideration should also be given 
to the fact that the unit gives off a significant 
amount of heat, and it may not work cor-
rectly if used while still inside an enclosed 
trailer during a hot summer day.  Use of an 
enclosed trailer as an operating platform 
should take into consideration the need for 
the operator of the unit to have a comfort-
able working environment, either in ex-
tremely hot or cold weather.  The power 
supply should also be capable of providing 
supporting power to heat or air conditioning 
units inside the trailer. 
Many jurisdictions have opted to place the 
TRP-1000 inside a dedicated communica-
tions vehicle using a van, command vehicle, 
or even converting a reserve ambulance as 
shown in Figure 3-3.  Many configurations 
are possible with this arrangement and this 
can be an ideal solution if an agency has a 
spare vehicle to dedicate solely to TRP-
1000 deployment.  
Figure 3-2  Example of enclosed trailer 
used to store and transport the TRP-1000. 
ACU/TRP-1000 Handbook 
Page 3-4 
Most of the vehicle configurations include 
strapping the TRP-1000 to the floor or side 
of the vehicle with a jump seat or bench for 
a technician to set-up and program the unit 
en-route.  Some jurisdictions have designed 
the vehicle to supplement their command 
vehicle by moving their primary communica-
tions component from the command vehicle 
to the smaller TRP-1000 communications 
vehicle, and connecting the two via an inter-
com system. 
Commanders would likely benefit from mov-
ing the distraction of multiple radios operat-
ing simultaneously to an adjacent vehicle.  
One particular advantage to these designs 
is that they are typically airconditioned/ 
heated vehicles, especially an ambulance 
that has supplemental air conditioning.  This 
makes operating the TRP-1000 much easier 
in the summer as the unit generates con-
siderable heat when in operation.  
One jurisdiction discovered having heat in 
the vehicle is also important as the TRP-
1000 and radios did not put off sufficient 
heat to warm the van during a cold night-
time deployment.  Some communications 
technicians also indicated operating the 
various radios over a wide temperature 
range caused frequency "drift" and recom-
mended keeping the vehicle at a constant 
temperature, or checking the radios occa-
sionally for drift.  They emphasized that 
temperature changes do not affect the TRP-
1000, but do affect the radios mounted in 
the unit. 
The third common mobile deployment op-
tion involves placing the unit on a mobile 
command vehicle, typically a bus, motor 
home or large trailer as shown in Figure 
3-4.  Although space may be a considera-
tion when deciding to implement this option, 
the co-location of the TRP-1000 with the 
other incident command resources can 
prove invaluable when manpower is at a 
premium.  Since many mobile command 
vehicles already include communications 
and dispatch capabilities along with the 
necessary technicians and operators to run 
them, the TRP-1000 could easily be con-
nected to and managed by these existing 
resources. 
Deployment plans for this arrangement can 
be restrictive, as it is necessary to deploy 
the entire command vehicle.  There may be 
difficulties deploying the TRP-1000 to 
smaller events, or to long-term mutual aid 
assignments.  One jurisdiction indicated that 
mounting the TRP-1000 in a command van 
would limit the ability to deploy the system 
off-road.  However, like the previous option, 
this configuration allows for rapid deploy-
ment and on-the-fly set-up and program-
ming while enroute to an incident.

mounted in the back of a converted ambu-
lance.  The inside has been reconfigured 
with counters and chairs for communica-
tions technicians.

hicle.  A bigger vehicle allows more commu-
nications equipment to be carried to the 
scene alongside the TRP-1000.

3.3.1 Fixed-Site Operation - Com-
munications Center, Backup 
EOC, and Dispatch 
Some jurisdictions have integrated the TRP-
1000 into their fixed communications and 
dispatch facility as shown in Figure 3-5.  
Others plan to use the unit as part of a 
backup 
emergency 
operations 
center.  
Since the TRP-1000 was designed as an 
interoperability solution, it does allow for the 
establishment of talk groups and patches 
between frequencies. 
Some agencies that dispatch by tone have 
worked on connecting their encoders to the 
unit as part of a backup dispatch package 
with varying degrees of success.  However, 
since the TRP-1000 is restricted to ana-
logue audio signals, it cannot facilitate com-
puter-aided dispatch and other digital com-
munications.  
Although the TRP-1000 has many applica-
tions that benefit these arrangements, JPS 
Communications 
offers 
less 
expensive 
equipment to meet the needs of a fixed-site 
facility; the ACU-1000, which is essentially 
the internal components of the TRP-1000 
without all the protective mounting and cas-
ings required for mobile operation.  
Some jurisdictions have considered leaving 
the TRP-1000 in a mobile format and sta-
tioning it at the backup Office of Emergency 
Communications (EOC) or backup dispatch 
center where it would be connected to a 
suitable antenna system and power supply 
ready for immediate use.  This configuration 
leaves the option of quickly disconnecting 
the system for rapid deployment.  
Other jurisdictions are installing a power 
supply and antenna system at a pre-
selected site to allow the installation of the 
TRP-1000 within minutes into a backup dis-
patch/repeater site.  Still other jurisdictions 
are planning to use an existing fire station 
and radio tower to mount the antennas or to 
locate the antenna on a rooftop location in 
the downtown area to provide the greatest 
area of coverage in a backup configuration. 
3.3.2 Mutual-Aid - Manned or Un-
manned Deployment 
Since most jurisdictions have mutual-aid 
agreements with neighboring jurisdictions, it 
makes sense to develop procedures and 
protocols for deploying the TRP-1000 to 
outside jurisdictions as needed.  Some 
agencies have easily accomplished this by 
making additional units available for tempo-
rary or permanent loan to neighboring juris-
dictions.   
Other jurisdictions have opted to set-up the 
TRP-1000 for mobile configurations, and 
are working on creating plans to send the 
Figure 3-5  Example of fixed-site installa-
tion of TRP-1000 package. 
ACU/TRP-1000 Handbook 
Page 3-6 
unit to neighboring jurisdictions as needed.  
When considering the latter option, a juris-
diction must decide if they are going to de-
ploy the TRP-1000 with trained operators 
and technicians, or simply drop-off the unit 
with all necessary equipment and provide a 
quick training session.  If operators and 
technicians are not included in the mutual-
aid package, then personnel from receiving 
jurisdictions should be included in relevant 
training and exercises.  Agreements should 
be made ahead of time as to which jurisdic-
tions will supply the necessary personnel, 
radios, connection wires, generator/power 
supply, etc.   
Ideally, the trained operators and techni-
cians from either jurisdiction would already 
have the necessary frequencies and radio 
information on hand, and could quickly pro-
gram the unit to meet the needs of the 
event.  Jurisdictions have mixed feelings on 
this issue.  Some see their role as supplying 
the equipment and training to get the recipi-
ent jurisdiction up and running, while others 
feel leaving the system without a trained 
technician would be unacceptable. 
3.3.3 Set-Up and Deployment En-
route 
Some jurisdictions have installed a mobile 
phone and fax capability in their TRP-1000 
transport vehicles (typically in vans or com-
mand vehicles) so that a communications 
technician can contact the other jurisdictions 
and agencies while en-route to the event to 
obtain their radio frequencies and other in-
formation.  In this scenario, the TRP-1000 
can then be programmed with the correct 
frequencies and private line (PL) tones 
while another technician or operator is driv-
ing the unit to the incident.  This also gives 
the technicians the ability to contact JPS 
Communications, Inc., or the radio manu-
facturers 
for 
technical 
information 
as 
needed.  
Mobile phones can also be connected to the 
TRP-1000 for further interoperability capa-
bility.  For example, mobile phone capability 
would let another local, state, or federal 
agency monitor scene communications from 
any location over their regular phone line, or 
allow the Incident Commander to speak with 
anyone by phone, simply by using their 
portable radio and having the TRP-1000 
operator create the patch to the mobile 
phone.  
Deployment plans can be relatively rapid in 
nature, as the necessary programming can 
literally be done on the move.  If the system 
can be powered by an on-board power sup-
ply, direct current (DC), built in generator or 
similar system, the system could be opera-
tional even prior to arrival on the scene. 
Note: 
Additional electronic communication 
equipment compatible with the ACU-1000 
Gateway Switch are: telephones, Internet 
audio transmissions, dispatch tones, ma-
rine radios, and aviation radios. 
Because the TRP-1000 will accommodate 
virtually any device that produces or trans-
mits audio, the potential of adding landline 
phones or some mobile phones to the sys-
tem exists.  For example, this allows the 
system to connect the Incident Com-
mander's (IC) radio to any telephone in the 
world, simply by having the TRP-1000 op-
erator patch the radio to the telephone 
module.  JPS provides phone modules for 
the TRP-1000 system as part of the stan-
dard system. 
Each jurisdiction needs to evaluate the 
methods available to communicate with all 
of the agencies that may be responding to 
an incident and plan to acquire appropriate 
radios or frequency/private line information 
to allow for interconnection capabilities. 
JPS is finalizing development of their Vi-
perNet system that will allow the TRP-
1000 to be connected to an Internet system, 
vastly increasing the number of deployment 
and control options. 
3.3.4 Creating On-Scene Talk 
Groups 
An ideal usage of the TRP-1000 system is 
to allow similar units (such as HazMat 
ACU/TRP-1000 Handbook 
Page 3-7 
teams) from several jurisdictions, operating 
on separate radio systems, to be joined into 
a Talk Group, thus allowing the various tac-
tical frequencies on the portable radios to 
be joined.  This allows better communica-
tions on-scene, and takes radio traffic off 
the primary frequencies. 
3.3.5 Making the IC's Job Easier 
Ultimately, it is the ability of the TRP-1000 
system to make the IC's job easier, which is 
its most desirable feature.  The system,
