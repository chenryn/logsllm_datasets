 "A": "The system successfully identifies a previously unknown attack pattern by comparing it against established models of normal behavior."
 "B": "The system frequently flags legitimate user behavior as suspicious due to slight variations in data entry, causing disruptions in normal operations."
 "C": "The system fails to detect malicious activity because the attack was included in the dataset used to define normal behavior."
