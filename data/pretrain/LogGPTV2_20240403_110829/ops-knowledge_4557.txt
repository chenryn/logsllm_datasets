User: What is load balancing technology? Please provide an Nginx-based load balancing solution to achieve high server availability and performance optimization.
Assistant: Load balancing technology is a technology that distributes network traffic requests to multiple servers to optimize the performance, availability and stability of the entire server cluster. The load balancer distributes user requests to multiple back-end servers according to a certain strategy, and performs dynamic scheduling and load balancing according to the status and load of the servers to achieve the purpose of improving performance and ensuring availability. The following is a Nginx-based load balancing solution to achieve server high availability and performance optimization steps: 1. Install and configure the Nginx server, and realize request forwarding and load balancing by configuring a reverse proxy (Nginx supports multiple load balancing algorithms, Such as round robin, weighted round robin, ip_hash, etc.). 2. Configure the same service environment (such as Tomcat, Apache, Nginx, etc.) in multiple back-end servers, and ensure that their services can run normally. 3. In the Nginx server, configure upstream, and add the IP addresses and corresponding port numbers of multiple back-end servers to upstream to realize access to the back-end servers. 4. Configure the corresponding location path, bind it to the upstream, and distribute the request to different backend servers according to the path and load balancing strategy. 5. Use the health check mechanism to monitor the back-end server. When the health check of the back-end server fails, Nginx will automatically remove it from the load balancing list to avoid request retry. 6. For high-concurrency scenarios, use Nginx's caching mechanism to cache header information, data packets, and request results to improve the response speed of website access. 7. For cross-domain AJAX requests, you can configure proxy cross-domain requests through Nginx to solve cross-domain problems under the same-origin policy of browsers. The above is the Nginx-based load balancing solution to achieve high availability and performance optimization of the server.
