**Current behavior**
I have an angular app where am using a webcomponent based on custom elements
V0 specification.
        This is child element inside my custom page
Unable to get access to child elements of custom element "custom-page" in
attachedCallBack (lifecylce callback of webcomponents custom element) in the
webcomponent.
**Expected behavior**
Angular needs to provide a way for the webcomponent to access its child
elements.
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**

On the first preview, it might look like the node references are resolved,
please stop and re-run the plunker preview to reproduce the issue
