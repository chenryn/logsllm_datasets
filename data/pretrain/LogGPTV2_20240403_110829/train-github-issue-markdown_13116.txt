### Current Behavior
In my Angular application, I am using a web component based on the Custom Elements V0 specification. This web component is a child element within a custom page. However, I am unable to access the child elements of the `custom-page` web component within the `attachedCallback` lifecycle method.

### Expected Behavior
Angular should provide a mechanism for web components to access their child elements during the `attachedCallback` lifecycle phase.

### Minimal Reproduction
To reproduce the issue, please follow these steps:

1. Visit the following Plunker: [Minimal Reproduction](https://plnkr.co/edit/SGndyIXp8alqaSP4Av5F?p=preview)
2. Open the browser's developer console.
3. Look for the console message "Accessing child Nodes."
4. On the first preview, it may appear that the node references are resolved. To reproduce the issue, stop and re-run the Plunker preview.

### Additional Information
- **Angular Version:** 2.0.X
