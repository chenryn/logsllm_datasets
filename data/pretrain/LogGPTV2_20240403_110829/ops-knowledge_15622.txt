User:  Is this log an error log? [Sun Dec 04 17:43:08 2005] [error] jk2_init() Can't find child 1566 in scoreboard
Assistant: Whether there is an exception: There is an exception Exception type: Web server application exception Exception reason/solution: This error log is the error log during the running of the Apache Web server, indicating that Apache's mod_jk cannot find the child process whose process ID is 1566. Possible causes are that the child process exited unexpectedly or was killed by the hypervisor. The system and process management program should be checked to confirm whether the child process has been exited or killed. When such problems occur, it is usually necessary to restart the application process to ensure the normal operation of the server or to avoid similar problems from happening again.
