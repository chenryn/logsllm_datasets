**Analysis:**

- **Exception Type:** Web server application error
- **Description:** This log entry indicates an error encountered during the operation of the Apache Web server. Specifically, it suggests that the `mod_jk` module is unable to locate a child process with the process ID (PID) 1566 in the scoreboard.
- **Possible Causes:**
  - The child process may have terminated unexpectedly.
  - The child process might have been terminated by the system or a higher-level process manager.
- **Suggested Actions:**
  - Verify the status of the child process using system and process management tools to confirm if it has exited or been killed.
