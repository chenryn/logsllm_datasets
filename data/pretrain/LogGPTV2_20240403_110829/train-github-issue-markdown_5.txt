.valid would apply the normal ("successful") input/textarea/select styles when
applied to those input types while within a .control-group.error.
The use case for this is a .control-group section with a "multi-part" input
(ex: time entry with hour and minute fields). If minutes was valid, but hour
was not the .control-group should still have .error applied.
This would give users a more obvious indication of what was left to fix--since
only input/textarea/select's without the .valid class would be marked in the
.error styles.
.valid could inherit direction form the default input/textarea/select styles.
