# What I'm doing
Trying to estimate the emotion of tweets using
https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-emotion
# The error
`RuntimeError: The expanded size of the tensor (601) must match the existing
size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1. Target sizes: [1, 601]. Tensor sizes:
[1, 514]`
Does anyone what the problem might be? I tried `truncating=True` as well
