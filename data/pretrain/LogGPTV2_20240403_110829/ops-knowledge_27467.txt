**Reinstalling NumPy on Windows 8.1 with a .whl File**

I recently attempted to reinstall NumPy for Python 3.4 on my new computer, but I'm encountering some difficulties. I am using Windows 8.1, and in the past, I used an `.exe` file that handled the installation process for me. This time, however, I was provided with a `.whl` file (a "Wheel" file), and I am unsure how to proceed with the installation.

Other resources have suggested using `pip` for the installation, but the instructions I found were not very clear. When I tried commands like `python -m pip install numpy` or `pip install numpy`, I received errors such as:
- "python is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file"
- "pip is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file"

I also tried variations like `python3.4`, `python.exe`, and others, but none of them worked. The filename of the NumPy `.whl` file I downloaded is `numpy-1.9.2+mkl-cp34-none-win_amd64.whl`.

Could someone provide a detailed tutorial on how to install this `.whl` file? It seems that many modules are now distributed in this format. Additionally, I'm curious why the use of `.exe` files for module installation has been discontinued. They were much easier to use.

**Solution: Manually Installing the .whl File**

The easiest solution is to manually extract and install the `.whl` file. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:

1. **Download and Install 7-Zip:**
   - If you don't already have 7-Zip installed, download and install it from the official website: [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/).

2. **Extract the .whl File:**
   - Right-click on the `.whl` file (`numpy-1.9.2+mkl-cp34-none-win_amd64.whl`) and select "7-Zip" > "Extract Here" or "Extract to...". This will create a folder containing the extracted files.

3. **Locate the Python Site-Packages Directory:**
   - Open File Explorer and navigate to your Python installation directory. For Python 3.4, this is typically `C:\Python34\Lib\site-packages\`.

4. **Copy the Extracted Files:**
   - Copy the contents of the extracted folder (which should include the NumPy module) and paste them into the `site-packages` directory.

5. **Verify the Installation:**
   - Open a Command Prompt and type `python` to start the Python interpreter.
   - Type `import numpy` and press Enter. If there are no errors, the installation was successful.

**Why Use .whl Files?**

`.whl` files, or Wheel files, are a more modern and efficient way to distribute Python packages. They are designed to be faster and more reliable than traditional `.exe` files, especially for complex packages with multiple dependencies. While they may require a bit more manual intervention, they offer better compatibility and performance across different environments.

If you continue to experience issues, please let me know, and I can provide further assistance.
