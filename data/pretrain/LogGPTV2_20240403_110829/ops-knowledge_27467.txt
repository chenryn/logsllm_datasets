User: I recently tried to re-install numpy for python 3.4, since I got a new computer, and am struggling. I am on windows 8.1, and from what I remember I previously used a .exe file that did everything for me. However, this time I was given a .whl file (apparently this is a "Wheel" file), which I cannot figure out how to install.
Other posts have explained that I have to use PIP, however the explanations of how to install these files that I have been able to find are dreadful. The command "python install pip" or "pip install numpy" or all the other various commands I have seen only return an error that "python is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file", or "pip is not recognised as an internal...." ect.
I have also tried "python3.4", "python.exe" and many others since it does not like python. The file name of the numpy file that I downloaded is "numpy-1.9.2+mkl-cp34-none-win_amd64.whl".
So can anybody give me a Detailed tutorial of how to use these, as by the looks of things all modules are using these now. Also, why did people stop using .exe files to install these? It was so much easier!
Assistant: See the easiest solution is to unzip the .whl file using 7-zip. Then in the unzipped directory you will find the module which you can copy and paste in the directory C:/Python34/Lib/site-packages/ (or wherever else you have installed Python).
