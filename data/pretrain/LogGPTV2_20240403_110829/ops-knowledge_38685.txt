User: How to implement data synchronization and backup of distributed databases?
Assistant: 1. Data synchronization scheme: (1) Master-slave replication mode: The master database distributes updates to one or more slave databases, and the slave databases periodically asynchronously synchronize data to the local, generally using asynchronous data transmission. (2) Peer-to-peer replication mode: each node can receive and distribute data, and can freely synchronize data between nodes. (3) Shared disk mode: multiple nodes realize data synchronization through shared storage area. After one of the multiple nodes modifies the data, other nodes can see it immediately. 2. Data backup scheme: (1) Data fragmentation backup mode: store data in multiple nodes, and each node only backs up the data stored by itself, reducing the burden of backup and improving backup efficiency. (2) Centralized backup mode: select a node as the backup node, and other nodes back up data to this node. (3) Off-site backup mode: Backup data is stored in different regions or data centers to avoid data loss caused by single point of failure and natural disasters.
