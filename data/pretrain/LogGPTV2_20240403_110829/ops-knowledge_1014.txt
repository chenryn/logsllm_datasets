User: I want to know if it is possible to add the path to a directory to the environment variables permanently using python. I have seen other questions that relate to mine but the answers there only add the path temporarily,I want to know if there's a way to add it permanently
Assistant: While using bash add this 
~/.bashrc
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:/Home/dev/path
Make sure the directory you point to has at the topmost init.py file in your directory structure
