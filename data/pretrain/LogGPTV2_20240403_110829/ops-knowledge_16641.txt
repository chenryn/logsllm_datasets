User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Increase precision of apache 2.2 log timestamp to include microseconds A similar question was already asked on StackOverflow 
but there was no helpful answer given and I think it fits better here.

I need to log the microseconds or milliseconds of the first response time.
I followed the format given in the documentation for apache 2.2 http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_log_config.html (I'm using apache 2.2.3) but it wont work. I changed the log format in /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf to:

LogFormat "%h %l %u %t %{usec_frac}t \"%r\" %&gt;s %b %D" test


The output I get is:

IPaddress - - [10/Oct/2015:19:47:46 +0200] usec_frac "GET /w/images/thumb/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg/35px-Wikiquote-logo.svg.png HTTP/1.1" 200 1931 86


So usec_frac is not resolved but it is listed in the documentation as a possible format for %{format}t. I'm using CentOS release 5.8 (Final) and I edited the httpd.conf with vi. What could be the problem here?

Assistant: As wrote in the official documentation you linked :

%{UNIT}T    



  The time taken to serve the request, in a time unit given by UNIT.
  Valid units are ms for milliseconds, us for microseconds, and s for
  seconds. Using s gives the same result as %T without any format; using
  us gives the same result as %D. Combining %T with a unit is available
  in 2.2.30 and later.
