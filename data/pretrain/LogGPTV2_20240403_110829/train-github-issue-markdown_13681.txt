It is necessary to verify the availability of the document before proceeding. If this check is not performed, an error stating "document is undefined" may be thrown on the server.

For reference, please see the relevant code in the `overlay.jsx` file at lines 57-59:
[Link to the code](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/blob/47bf496d977d0ff1ef9e1a7615c405b49e81ac2a/src/overlay.jsx#L57-L59)

To avoid this issue, you should add a conditional check to ensure that the `document` object is defined before using it. For example:

```javascript
if (typeof document !== 'undefined') {
  // Your code here
}
```

This will prevent the "document is undefined" error from occurring when the code is executed on the server.
