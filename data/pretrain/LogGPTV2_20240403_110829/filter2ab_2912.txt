**ATT&CK ID:** T1499.001  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** OS Exhaustion Flood

Adversaries may launch a denial of service (DoS) attack specifically targeting the operating system (OS) of an endpoint. The OS is responsible for managing the finite resources of the system and preventing it from being overwhelmed by excessive demands on its capacity. In these attacks, adversaries aim to exhaust the limits and available resources that the OS self-imposes, rather than necessarily depleting the actual physical resources of the system. This can result in the system becoming unresponsive or unavailable, effectively disrupting normal operations.
