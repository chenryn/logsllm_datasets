### Relationship Between C&C Abuse and Structural Characteristics of Providers

In the following section, we will examine the 'average C&C uptime' as a proxy for the security efforts of providers. We categorize the variables that characterize the structural properties of providers into three main groups: those that capture size, regulatory aspects of the country in which providers operate, and those that capture the business model characteristics of providers. A summary of these variables is provided in Table 2.

### 4.1 Structural Characteristics of Providers

#### 4.1.1 Size

- **Allocated IP Space**: This refers to the size of the IP address net-block(s) assigned to a hosting provider, as recorded in WHOIS data from Regional Internet Registries (RIRs). We use this information as an indicator of the attack surface, assuming that a larger IP range correlates with more server infrastructure, and thus a higher probability of abuse. The variable ranges from one IP address to many thousands, indicating significant heterogeneity in the market for hosting services.
  
- **Webhosting IP Space**: This is the number of IP addresses hosting domain names, calculated using passive DNS data. It reflects the extent to which a provider's allocated IP space is used for web hosting. Providers with a large portion of their IP space dedicated to web hosting are likely to have a business model focused on this service, as opposed to other services like VPS, collocation, or access services.
  
- **Domain Name Space**: This is the number of domains hosted by a particular provider, also calculated using passive DNS data. It indicates the scale of the provider's web hosting operations. Due to the high variance and skewed distribution of these variables, we use a log-transformation (Log10) for analysis.
  
- **Proportion of Shared Hosting**: This measures the ratio of domains hosted on shared IP addresses to the total domain name space. An IP address is considered shared if it hosts more than 10 domain names. This variable provides insight into the provider's business model, particularly the extent to which it relies on low-cost shared hosting services.

#### 4.1.2 Regulation

- **Rule of Law**: This index serves as a proxy for the effectiveness of law enforcement against illegal activities within a country. It is based on a well-established indicator from the World Justice Project, which uses surveys to measure the practical experience of the rule of law by the general public. The index includes indicators such as constraints on government powers, absence of corruption, order and security, civil and criminal justice, open government, fundamental rights, regulatory enforcement, and justice experienced by ordinary people. Lower index values indicate a stronger rule of law.

#### 4.1.3 Business Model

- **Popularity Index**: This proxies the online popularity of a hosting provider, calculated using Alexa's top one million ranked domains. The index is calculated by summing the base-10 logarithm of the reverse Alexa rank of all hosted domains. This score reflects both the popularity of the provider's customer base and the density of popular domains hosted by the provider.
  
- **Time in Business**: This is a proxy for the provider's experience, measured by the number of years the provider has been operating. More experienced providers are hypothesized to be less exploited due to learning effects. Data is collected by querying the WHOIS database for the registration date of the provider's website, cross-checked with the Internet Archive database.
  
- **Best Price**: This is the least expensive hosting plan offered by the provider. Our hypothesis is that providers with lower prices are more likely to host C&C domains, either through malicious registrations or compromised domains, as they may allocate fewer resources to security. All prices are converted to US dollars using the 2015 average exchange rate.
  
- **Vulnerable Software Ratio**: This is the proportion of domains running vulnerable software installations, such as WordPress, hosted by the provider. We use WPScan, a WordPress vulnerability scanner, to collect data for a random sample of 2% of the provider's hosted domains. The ratio is calculated by dividing the number of scanned domains with WordPress installations by the total number of scanned domains, excluding those that could not be scanned.

### 4.2 Effect of Providers’ Structural Characteristics

To analyze the impact of various structural characteristics on the concentration of C&Cs, we employ a generalized linear model (GLM) with a log-linear link function:

\[ \ln(\lambda_i) = \beta_1 \text{AllocatedIP Size} + \beta_2 \text{WebhostingIP Size} + \beta_3 \text{DomainSize} + \beta_4 \text{SharedHosting} + \beta_5 \text{RuleofLaw} \]

where the dependent variable, the count of C&C domains, follows a Poisson distribution with parameter \(\lambda \geq 0\), and \(\beta\)s are the estimated coefficients for the explanatory variables. Subscript \(i\) refers to measurements across different hosting providers.

We construct several models using the variables outlined above, aiming to maximize the explained variance and identify the most influential variables. The results of our regression models are displayed in Table 3.

It is important to note that multiple models are built to compare goodness-of-fit values while adding new variables. We use Log-likelihood, AIC, and pseudo R-squared to assess the performance of the models. The pseudo R-squared is calculated using the formula:

\[ R^2 = 1 - \frac{D(y, \hat{\lambda}) + k \cdot \hat{\phi}}{D(y, \bar{Y})} \]

where \(D(y, \hat{\lambda})\) is the deviance of the fitted model, \(D(y, \bar{Y})\) is the deviance of the intercept-only model, \(\hat{\phi}\) is the estimated dispersion parameter, and \(k\) is the number of covariates fitted (excluding the intercept).

By examining Table 3, Model 1 is the intercept-only model with the count of C&C domains as the dependent variable. In Model 2, we include the size variables—'Allocated IP space size' and 'Webhosting IP space size'. The model shows a significant negative relationship between 'Allocated IP space size' and C&C abuse counts, and a positive relationship for 'Webhosting IP space size'. This is expected, as these variables together determine the extent to which the provider uses its allocated IP space for web hosting services. Additionally, our manual inspection of the hosting data shows that providers with very large allocated IP space are often broadband providers who use only a small portion for hosting. The goodness-of-fit criteria indicate that adding these two size variables substantially reduces the log-likelihood, AIC, and dispersion values, explaining approximately 58% of the variance in abuse counts.

Building on Model 2, we include additional variables in Model 4, such as 'Size of the domain names space' and the extent of shared hosting. The results show that a larger domain name space and a higher proportion of shared hosting significantly correlate with more C&C abuse. For perspective, a unit increase in 'Size of the domain names space' multiplies the number of C&Cs by \(e^{1.300} = 3.7\).

In addition to the size variables analyzed in Models 1 to 4, we further explore the influence of regulatory and business model variables.
