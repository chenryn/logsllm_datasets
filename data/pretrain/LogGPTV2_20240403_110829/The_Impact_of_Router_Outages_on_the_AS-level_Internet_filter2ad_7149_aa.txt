## Abstract
We introduce and evaluate a new metric for assessing the dependence of the AS-level Internet on individual routers. Previous studies have relied on extensive reachability probes to infer outages, but we have developed an efficient active probing technique that directly and unambiguously identifies router restarts. Over 2.5 years, we surveyed 149,560 routers across the Internet, finding that 59,175 (40%) experienced at least one reboot. We quantified the impact of each router outage on global IPv4 and IPv6 BGP reachability.

Our method complements existing data and control plane outage analysis by providing a causal link from BGP reachability failures to the responsible router(s) and multi-homing configurations. While the Internet core is largely robust, we identified specific routers that were single points of failure for the prefixes they advertised. In total, 2,385 routers (4.0% of those that restarted over 2.5 years) were single points of failure for 3,396 IPv6 prefixes announced by 1,708 ASes. We inferred that 59% of these routers were customer-edge border routers. Additionally, 2,374 (70%) of the withdrawn prefixes were not covered by a less specific prefix, indicating that 1,726 routers (2.9%) of those that restarted were single points of failure for at least one network. However, a covering route did not guarantee reachability during a router outage, as no previously responsive address in a withdrawn more specific prefix responded during a one-week sample. We validated our reboot and single point of failure inference techniques with four networks, finding no false positives or negatives in reboots, but some false negatives in our single point of failure inferences.

## 1. Introduction
The Internet is critical infrastructure, but its complex ecosystem of systems, users, applications, and service providers makes it challenging to accurately assess its resilience. At the infrastructure level, networks may use routing protocols, multiple routers, links, and providers to achieve diversity, redundancy, and resilience to failure. This paper takes a new step towards understanding Internet reliability by examining individual router reboots and measuring their broader global impact.

Graph-theoretic approaches to understanding and characterizing resilience are notoriously fragile due to the difficulty in obtaining accurate Internet topologies. While a router may appear central to a network's connectivity, significant redundancy may be invisible to measurement. Despite the need for complete and sound data on Internet infrastructure resilience, the inherently global, unregulated, complex, and decentralized nature of the Internet makes obtaining such data challenging. Prior research has attempted to quantify network resilience by inferring outages, attacks, and their causes from noisy and incomplete data. For instance, high-volume probing of edge devices can expose more reachability failures than control-plane analysis alone, and control plane analysis can identify failures and tomography can isolate their causes.

In contrast, we aim to empirically quantify the dependence of interdomain routing on individual routers. We employ an efficient active probing technique that elicits IPv6 fragment identifiers from routers. These 32-bit fragment identifiers are commonly monotonic, unambiguously and directly exposing router reboots when there is a discontinuity in the sampled sequence. While our restart inference technique is only effective for routers with an IPv6 control plane, we show that the restart events we find also frequently manifest as IPv4 BGP churn and withdrawals due to the prevalence of IPv4/IPv6 infrastructure sharing.

We surveyed 149,560 distinct routers over 2.5 years. We associated each router with a set of destinations (IPv4 and IPv6 network prefixes) reachable via that router, as indicated by analysis of CAIDA’s traceroute topology data. We correlated each observed router outage with BGP control plane activity, shedding light on the impact of more than 2.5 years of such events on global IPv4 and IPv6 BGP reachability.

In addition to localizing BGP reachability failures to responsible routers and configurations, we identified specific routers that are single points of failure for their networks. Surprisingly, 4.0% of the surveyed routers were relied on by their AS to announce a prefix in BGP. Our contributions include:

1. A new perspective on characterizing the importance of individual routers on Internet resilience.
2. An Internet-wide large-scale measurement campaign to identify and characterize router restarts over 2.5 years.
3. Correlation of restarts against ≈12M BGP update messages to quantify their global IPv4 and IPv6 reachability impact.
4. Identification of 2,385 individual routers in the global topology that represented single points of failure for 1,708 ASes.
5. Week-long high-frequency active probing of networks behind rebooting routers to assess the impact of the reboot on the data-plane.
6. Public release of the source code for our adaptive probing engine as part of scamper [32].

The remainder of this work is organized as follows. Section 2 provides background and context, while Section 3 gives an overview of the extensive prior work in measuring and mitigating network outages. Section 4 details our methodology and data, while Section 5 provides the results of our extended, Internet-wide measurement study. We conclude in Section 6 with a discussion on the broader implications of our findings and suggestions for future research.

## 2. Background
### 2.1 Router Restarts
Unlike previous efforts that indirectly localize outages, blackholes, and reachability faults (e.g., via traceroutes, topology atlases, tomography, etc.), we directly interrogate the control-plane IPv6 stack on routers to unambiguously determine whether the router has restarted. At a high level, we construct a per-router time series of IP Identifier (IPID) values from fragmented IPv6 response packets and use discontinuities in the series to infer that the router restarted during the polling interval.

We focus on IPv6 routers for two reasons. First, probing routers affords significant efficiencies compared to probing edge systems, where even finding a stable set of edge IPv6 addresses presents a practical difficulty. Second, probing IPv6 routers allows us to unambiguously determine that a router rebooted, rather than relying on fragile tomography inferences. Only IPv6 routers provide a clean signal that allows us to reliably infer that a restart occurred. While the IPv4 stack on routers also has an IPID field, it is both small (16-bits) and has natural velocity since every control packet the router originates must have an IPID in case the packet is fragmented in the network. In contrast, the IPv6 IPID field is 32-bits in size with no natural velocity because routers rarely send fragmented packets, and only the sender can fragment a packet. The small size of the IPv4 IPID field, combined with the fact that a router may send packets in bursts due to operational and control traffic, makes it infeasible to distinguish an IPv4 router restart from a counter wrap.

The IPID field is an optional IPv6 extension header. To obtain fragmented responses, we use our method from [7] and send 1300-byte ICMP6 echo request packets to router interfaces. Upon receipt of an ICMP6 echo reply larger than 1280 bytes, we respond with an ICMP6 packet too big message asking the receiver to reduce its packet size to 1280 bytes. This process induces the router to fragment subsequent ICMP6 echo replies, exposing the router’s IPv6 IPID counter values. In our data, 27.1% of router interfaces that responded for at least 14 days during our 2.5 years of probing assigned IPID values from a counter; others assigned values from a pseudo-random number generator, did not send fragmented responses to our probes, had fragments blocked along the reverse path, or ICMP packet too big messages were blocked along the forward path. A responsive router with a monotonic sequence that resets therefore represents a restart. Section 4.1 provides our full algorithm for inferring a router outage.

### 2.2 BGP
The Border Gateway Protocol version 4 (BGP) is the protocol used by ASes to organize interdomain routing [40, 41]. To quantify the impact of an inferred router outage, we examine the sequence of BGP messages received at the Routeviews looking glass. In this section, we discuss subtleties of BGP that manifest in the BGP update and withdrawal messages we can observe, and how they can impact our ability to correlate BGP activity with router outages.

An AS exchanges network-layer reachability information with neighboring ASes according to the configuration applied by the router’s operator. An AS establishes a session with a neighbor using TCP, and each peer keeps state regarding which prefixes are reachable; a neighbor may announce new routes, withdraw existing routes, or update routes.

**Ending a BGP Session:**
A router may end a BGP session gracefully by notifying the peer that it is closing the session, or by closing the TCP connection. A graceful shutdown occurs when an operator halts, reboots, or changes the configuration of a router to remove the peer. A router will not shut down a BGP session gracefully if the neighbor router crashes or fails, or if a physical link between the peers is broken and the router does not detect the link failure. A router infers that a peer has failed if it does not receive a BGP keep-alive message from the peer within the hold time period agreed by the peers using the BGP protocol [41]. The BGP specification suggests that routers send keep-alive messages at 30-second intervals and wait 90 seconds after receiving a keep-alive message before deciding the BGP session has failed. However, the Cisco default is to send keep-alive messages at 60-second intervals and wait 180 seconds before deciding the BGP session has failed. A router may infer a BGP session with a peer has failed more quickly if the operator configures a shorter hold time for the peer or if the operator configures Bidirectional Forwarding Detection [25], which allows the router to verify the peer is responsive at the network layer.

**Path Hunting:**
When a router’s BGP session with a peer fails or is gracefully shut down, the router removes the routes it received from that peer from its Routing Information Base (RIB). The router then runs a decision process to select alternative routes for the withdrawn routes that were previously the best available for the prefixes. If the router has no other route available for a prefix, it sends a withdrawal notice to its peers, causing them to remove the route from their RIBs and to run the BGP route decision process. Depending on the availability of alternative routes, routers may begin path hunting or path exploration, where a router replaces the withdrawn route with what it believes to be a valid route with a different path. However, if the replacement route is via a path affected by the same failure, the replacement route may also be subsequently withdrawn or updated as routing information converges. This activity typically induces a burst of withdrawal and update messages to propagate through the Internet, known as "churn."

**Route Flap Damping:**
Excessive BGP control traffic and churn can be a source of instability in the network if BGP routers are unable to process BGP control traffic at the same rate it arrives. The BGP specifications [40, 41] recommend that BGP routers use a Minimum Route Advertisement Interval (MRAI) of 30 seconds for routes exchanged between ASes. The initial BGP specification recommends that the MRAI not apply to withdrawn routes [40], but an update to the specification includes withdrawn routes in the MRAI [41]. In practice, the MRAI is applied per-neighbor rather than per-prefix. To further reduce the impact of unstable routes sustained over long time scales, the IETF standardized a protocol for route flap damping [47]. A router that uses route flap damping (RFD) scores each prefix according to recent activity, penalizing prefixes that contribute significant BGP load by suppressing updated routes for the prefix at increasingly long durations, up to one hour. Individual network operators make their own decisions about the configuration and deployment of MRAI and RFD.

### 2.3 Network Redundancy
Network redundancy is implemented in a wide variety of ways, and the resulting control-plane artifacts and failure modes can be both subtle and complex. A customer, which we informally define as an entity at the network edge that pays for access from a service provider, can have redundant i) routers, ii) links, and iii) providers. This redundancy may be utilized via load-balancing, only during failures, or deployed in more complex configurations (e.g., via selective advertisement of more specific prefix announcements) [3]. In this work, we focus on the role routers play in providing network resilience and ignore failures of links connecting routers (e.g., a severed long-haul optical link).

The types of customer connectivity range from the cross-product of single versus multiple customer edge routers, single versus multiple provider edge routers, and the use of a single or multiple providers. In the most basic case, no redundancy exists: a single customer edge router connects to a single provider edge router, and requires neither BGP nor provider-independent address space. We expect outages of these customer edge routers to have no impact or discernible effect on the global BGP control-plane.

The more interesting case, and the focus of this paper, involves a customer with their own AS and address space. Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) require a multi-homing plan for an organization to obtain an AS number. Surprisingly, we uncovered a non-trivial number of singly-homed customers in this class. An outage of such a customer or their provider’s router will manifest as a series of withdrawal and update messages in the global BGP system during path exploration. Eventually, we observe all Routeviews peers withdrawing the customer’s prefix. A significant component of our work is determining, for a given customer’s network prefix, the provider and customer edge routers (see §4.2).

More complex scenarios invoke more subtle behaviors. While we do not know the cause of a router reboot, a single router outage should not cause a complete prefix withdrawal if the network is properly configured with redundancy.
