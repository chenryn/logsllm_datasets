The goal of the workshop is to give a hands-on experience on analyzing the behavior of malware and botnet traffic in the network by studying their web patterns and their traffic behavior. The workshop will use both pcap files of real malware captures and real normal captures. Participants will learn a proven approach on how to do their traffic analysis, how to recognize malicious connections, how to separate normal behaviors from malicious behaviors, how to recognize anomalous patterns and how to deal with large amounts of traffic.
