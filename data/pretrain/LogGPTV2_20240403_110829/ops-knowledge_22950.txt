User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Can a card issuing company store CVV number, expiry date and 16 digits card number? I have a limited amount plastic card issued by a certain company. When I log into my online account of the same company, I can see complete details - 16 digits card number, name, expiry date and CVV number visible there. 

The login is protected via OTP as well.

My question is: can the card issuer store complete information about my card in their portal?

Assistant: Yes.

A payment handler (e.g. Amazon, Netflix, Thames Water, Comcast) must not store CVV and must mask the PAN (card number), assuming that they are contractually bound to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) by their bank.

The card issuer, however, has no such restrictions. They issued the card and they are ultimately responsible for storing its information safely. In all likelihood the card's funds will be protected by a mandatory insurance policy (either private or governmental), such as the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) in the UK, and the bank will be liable for damages in the event of card fraud caused by their negligence.

Local law, however, may override this, though I am entirely unaware of any law governing the data security practices of financial institutes at this level of detail.
