User: How to use Linux commands to check the disk space usage of the current system?
Assistant: You can use the following commands to view the disk space usage of the current system: 1. df command: List the total amount, usage, available amount, and mount point of disk partitions. ``` df -h ``` The -h option is used to display disk usage in a human-readable manner, for example: ``` Filesystem Size Used Avail Use% Mounted on /dev/sda1 464G 45G 396G 11% / none 4.0K 0 4.0K 0% /sys/fs/cgroup udev 7.8G 4.0K 7.8G 1% /dev tmpfs 1.6G 1.8M 1.6G 1% /run none 5.0M 0 5.0M 0% /run/lock none 7.9G 196K 7.9 G 1% /run/shm none 100M 24K 100M 1% /run/user /dev/sdb1 917G 367G 504G 42% /home ``` Among them, Size indicates the total space of the disk partition, Used indicates the used space, and Avail indicates Available space, Use% indicates the used percentage, Mounted on indicates the mount point of the disk partition. 2. du command: Calculate the disk space occupied by a file or directory. ``` du -sh /path/to/dir/ ``` The -s option is used to display only the total size, the -h option is used to display the size in a human-readable manner, for example: ``` 4.2G /path/to /dir/```
