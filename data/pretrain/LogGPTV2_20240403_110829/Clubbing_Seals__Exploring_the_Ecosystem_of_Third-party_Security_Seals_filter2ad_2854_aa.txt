# Authors: Tom Van Goethem, Frank Piessens, Wouter Joosen, Nick Nikiforakis
## Abstract
In today's web environment, characterized by distrust, malware, and server compromises, convincing online consumers that a website is secure can be the deciding factor between a visitor and a buyer. Third-party security seals aim to address this issue by having a trusted external company vouch for a website's security, which is then communicated to visitors through an embedded seal.

This paper explores the ecosystem of third-party security seals, focusing on their security claims and the gap between these claims and reality. Through a series of automated and manual experiments, we uncover a significant lack of thoroughness from seal providers, resulting in obviously insecure websites being certified as secure. We also demonstrate how malware can easily evade detection by seal providers and detail several attacks facilitated by the current architecture of third-party security seals. These include how seals can inadvertently lend credibility to phishing attacks and how they can be used as a passive vulnerability oracle, allowing attackers to focus on websites with known vulnerabilities.

## 1. Introduction
In recent years, it has become increasingly common to hear about major security incidents, whether due to bugs in cryptographic libraries, malware on point-of-sale terminals, exploitation of web application vulnerabilities, or social engineering. Databases containing credentials and personal details of millions of users are frequently compromised, leading to substantial monetary losses. According to a recent report, cybercrime and cyber espionage cost the United States alone $100 billion annually [24]. These losses include not only direct financial impacts but also indirect ones, such as the opportunity cost to businesses due to reduced trust in online services.

Trust has always been a critical barrier to the adoption and use of new technology. In the context of the web, users are often required to trust online companies with their sensitive personal and financial information. Surveys have shown that many online shoppers are hesitant to provide credit card and personal information online [13, 9]. In such an environment of distrust, companies can distinguish themselves by not only securing their infrastructure but also convincing users of their security measures. This is especially important for smaller companies that do not benefit from the implicit trust associated with well-known brands.

One way to achieve this is through the use of third-party security seals. A security seal is an image embedded in a website's HTML code, indicating that the site has been scanned by a security company and found to be free of vulnerabilities and malware. These seals are typically provided by large security firms like McAfee and Symantec, and they leverage the credibility of these companies to enhance trust in the certified site. The cost of these seals can range from hundreds to thousands of dollars per year, representing a significant recurring security investment, particularly for smaller companies.

Previous research on third-party security seals has primarily focused on user recognition and the impact on consumer confidence and sales [4, 10, 15, 18]. In this paper, we take a different approach by analyzing whether these seals should be trusted in the first place. Our three-pronged analysis includes:

1. **Certification Methods**: We compile a list of ten popular seal providers and analyze their certification methods. We find that the security checks are often conducted in a black-box manner, using automated scans. By deploying a known vulnerable web application, we demonstrate the inaccuracy and haphazardness of these scanners, with the best one detecting less than half of the known vulnerabilities.

2. **Security Practices of Certified Websites**: We examine over 8,000 websites certified by the studied seal providers. By comparing security features such as the use of HttpOnly cookies and Anti-CSRF tokens, we show that seal-using websites do not exhibit better security practices compared to non-seal-using sites of similar nature and popularity. Additionally, through manual penetration tests on nine seal-using websites, we reveal that moderately motivated attackers can discover high-risk vulnerabilities in most certified sites within a single working day.

3. **Attacks Facilitated by Security Seals**: We detail several attacks that are enabled by the use of third-party security seals. For example, we describe the architecture of a completely passive vulnerability oracle that allows attackers to identify exploitable websites by monitoring the appearance and disappearance of security seals.

Our main contributions are:
- **First Study of Security Guarantees**: We perform the first study that tests the claimed security guarantees of third-party security seals, exposing a lack of thoroughness and sophistication.
- **Comparison of Security Practices**: We show that seal-certified websites do not have different security practices compared to other equivalent non-seal-using websites.
- **Vulnerability Discovery**: We demonstrate that even moderately motivated attackers can easily find critical vulnerabilities in websites certified as secure.
- **Abuse of Security Seals**: We describe how attackers can abuse third-party security seals, including the creation of a completely passive vulnerability oracle that takes advantage of the way seal providers react to detected vulnerabilities.

### 2.1 General Architecture
Third-party security seals generally follow the architecture shown in Figure 1, which consists of two main components. We derived this architecture through the analysis of all ten investigated providers and the identification of common features.

#### 2.1.1 Security Assessment
To provide meaningful security certifications, seal providers must assess the security stance of their clients' websites. This is typically done using an automated scanner that periodically checks for security issues, such as vulnerabilities and, in some cases, malware. The scanning frequency varies depending on the provider and the version of the seal purchased, but it is usually daily or weekly. Clients are given access to a web-based control panel where they can review the findings of the latest scan. If vulnerabilities are discovered, the client is provided with a description, location, and generic guidance for remediation. They are also given a grace period to correct the issues before the seal is affected.

#### 2.1.2 Seal Display
When a website owner subscribes to a third-party security seal, they receive an HTML or JavaScript snippet to embed in their page. The general format is as follows:
```html
<img src="https://seal-provider.com/seal?client=example.com" alt="Secure Site">
```
This snippet dynamically requests an image from the seal provider's server. If the website is secure, the server responds with an image of the seal, which includes the provider's logo and is meant to be recognizable and credible to visitors. The image is often wrapped in an anchor tag that links to the seal provider's domain, providing additional information about the seal and the last scan date.

Interestingly, for most seal providers, if a vulnerability is discovered and not corrected within the grace period, the seal simply becomes invisible. Visitors will not see a "negative" seal, and the only way to detect this is by examining the HTML source code.
