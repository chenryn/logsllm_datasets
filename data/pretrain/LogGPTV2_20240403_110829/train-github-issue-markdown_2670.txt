The form implementation class
org.springframework.web.servlet.tags.form.FormTag doesn't implement support
for all the attributes it claims to support in the spring-form.tld. Specially,
the attributes supported by code in the AbstractHtmlElementTag class are
missing. This isn't a major problem on Tomcat, where things work fine until
you try to use one of the unsupported attributes, like cssClass, and then the
JSP fails to compile with the following error:  
Unable to find setter method for attribute: cssClass
But the situation is worse on WebLogic 8.1, which appears to validate the TLD
just by including the taglib on a page. I have a common taglibs.jsp page that
includes all the taglibs needed by my app, even if they aren't used on a
particular page. So I can't view any page in my application when using the
spring form taglib and this "global include" type of approach, because all
pages will display the following error:  
Error in using tag library uri='http://www.springframework.org/tags/form'
prefix='form': The Tag class
'org.springframework.web.servlet.tags.form.FormTag ' has no setter method
corresponding to TLD declared attribute 'cssClass', (JSP 1.1 spec, 5.4.1)
I think ideally the FormTag class would extend from AbstractHtmlElementTag
like most of the other tags, but this class in turn extends from
AbstractDataBoundFormElementTag, which contains behavior that doesn't apply to
the form tag. So I guess you might need to rework the inheritence hierarchy
slightly?
I don't need these attributes so as a temporary workaround I removed them from
my spring-forms.tld.
