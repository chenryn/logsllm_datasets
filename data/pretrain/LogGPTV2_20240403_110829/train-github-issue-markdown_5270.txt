When using a proxy server on Windows, I can successfully retrieve the list of available extensions for installation. However, each time I attempt to install one, I encounter an error stating that the proxy server cannot be found. 

In the error message, I have replaced the actual proxy address with "proxyAddress" for privacy. Additionally, I noticed that the port number is appended twice in some parts of the message.

I have tried setting the `http_proxy` and `https_proxy` environment variables both at the system level and within the `settings.json` file in Visual Studio Code. Unfortunately, I receive the same error in both scenarios.

Here is the full error message:
```
getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND proxyAddress:911 proxyAddress:911:911
Error: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND proxyAddress:911 proxyAddress:911:911
    at errnoException (dns.js:25:10)
    at GetAddrInfoReqWrap.onlookup [as oncomplete] (dns.js:76:26)
```

For reference, here is the version information from the "About" screen:

If you have any suggestions or solutions, I would greatly appreciate your assistance.
