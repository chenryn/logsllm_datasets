On Windows, when I am behind a proxy server I am able to get the list of
possible extensions to install but every time I try to install one of them it
gives an error that it can't find the proxy server.
Note in the error message that I replaced the real address with the text
proxyAddress. I did notice that some of the message has the port number
appended twice.
I tried using both the system environment variable for http_proxy and
https_proxy as well as setting it just in the VS Code settings.json file. Same
error on both.
    getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND proxyAddress:911 proxyAddress:911:911: Error: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND proxyAddress:911 proxyAddress:911:911,    at errnoException (dns.js:25:10),    at GetAddrInfoReqWrap.onlookup [as oncomplete] (dns.js:76:26)
