Question: "You are securing a Windows server and need to ensure that all files are only accessible via their long filenames to prevent unauthorized access through alternate naming schemes. Which of the following actions should you take to mitigate the risks associated with path equivalence issues, and what is a potential consequence of this action?"
 "A": "Enable support for 8.3 filenames in the Windows registry to standardize file naming and prevent alternate name creation."
 "B": "Disable Windows from supporting 8.3 filenames by editing the Windows registry, but understand that this will not remove previously generated 8.3 filenames."
 "C": "Rename all files to have 8.3 compliant names to avoid any path equivalence issues."
 "D": "Implement a file monitoring system that alerts administrators when a file is accessed using an 8.3 filename."
