**ATT&CK ID:** T1546.011  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Application Shimming

Adversaries may use application shimming to establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content. The Microsoft Windows Application Compatibility Infrastructure (also known as the Application Shim) was designed to ensure backward compatibility of software as the operating system's codebase evolves over time. For instance, this feature enables developers to apply fixes to applications—without modifying the original code—so that software originally written for Windows XP can run on newer versions of the operating system, such as Windows 10. By leveraging this mechanism, attackers can inject and execute malicious code, thereby maintaining a foothold in the system or gaining elevated privileges.
