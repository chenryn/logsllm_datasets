### Summary
Hello,

I encountered an issue while attempting to install the Verteego Data Suite, an open-source project, using the Ansible Playbook command. The installation failed with the following error message:

```
TASK [Make boot disk]
**********************************************************
fatal: [localhost]: FAILED! => {"changed": false, "failed": true, "msg": "No CA Certificates were found in CA_CERTS_PATH. For information on how to get required certificate files, please visit https://libcloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/other/ssl-certificate-validation.html"}
to retry, use: --limit @/Users/derkrikorian/vds/deployment/ansible/setup_gc_instance.retry
PLAY RECAP
*********************************************************************
localhost : ok=4 changed=1 unreachable=0 failed=1
```

When I tried to retry the playbook with the `--limit` option, I received another error:

```
MacBook-Pro-de-Der:~ derkrikorian$ ansible-playbook -i vds/deployment/ansible/hosts --private-key=.ssh/google_compute_engine vds/deployment/ansible/setup_gc_instance.yml --limit @/Users/derkrikorian/vds/deployment/ansible/setup_gc_instance.retry
ERROR! Specified --limit does not match any hosts
```

I am using a MacBook with macOS Sierra and trying to set up a Google Cloud instance.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,  
Lionel
