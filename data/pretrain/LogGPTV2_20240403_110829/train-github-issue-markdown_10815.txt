I am looking a way to lock down windows/webviews and I was testing the
inheritance of nodeintegration settings from parents to child. According to PR
#4897 this was fixed. But after testing it on my test app, i can still create
a webview with nodeintegration enabled, even if the parent has Nodeintegration
disabled.
I need this because my app receive data from users (IM's) and XSS could
happen.
main.js:
    function createWindow () {
      // Create the browser window.
      mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
        webPreferences: { nodeIntegration: false }
    });
index.html:
`
`
If I am not wrong there is a typo in the file spec/webview-spec.js line 100:
app. **once** ('browser-window-created', function (event, window) {
I am expecting the Webview to have nodeintegration disabled.
