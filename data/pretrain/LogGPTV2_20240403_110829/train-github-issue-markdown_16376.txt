When you're passing multiple files/globs to babel that will be built into a
single file, is it possible to eliminate duplicate file paths in the resulting
build rather than duplicating the contents?
I'm trying to influence the ordering of some files where the order is
important, so I have a command that looks like this:
    babel -s -c false --out-file tmp/built.js --ignore *.spec.js src/module.js "src/**/*.js"
At the moment, `module.js` would be included as the first file, then
duplicated again when the second glob matches it. Ideally, the file would only
be included the first time it was encountered.
