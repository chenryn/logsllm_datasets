As before we can have a private filed with unsupported named type, but in
recently update(gomobile version +24a199a Wed Jan 13), it breaks this rule,
that makes a huge impact to code, and make all types which want to be used for
mobile narrows down to supported basic type....
Before:
The following type is working
type ABC struct {  
WSClient  
}
type WSClient struct {  
conn *websocket.Conn  
}
ABC is the struct exported for use in android.
After:  
it is not working with an error message:  
gomobile: unsupported named type xxxx
