**Title: Botconf 2017 - Hunting Down Gooligan**

This presentation offers a detailed retrospective on the collaborative efforts of Check Point and Google in 2017 to dismantle Gooligan, one of the largest Android botnets at the time. What made Gooligan particularly noteworthy was its extensive use of stolen OAuth tokens to attack Google Play's API, a technique that had not been previously observed in malware.

The talk begins with an in-depth analysis of Gooligan's kill chain, covering the entire process from initial infection and exploitation to system-wide compromise. We will then leverage various telemetry data to highlight which devices were infected and how the botnet attempted to monetize the stolen OAuth tokens.

Next, we will discuss the methods used to uncover the Gooligan infrastructure and the connections we discovered between Gooligan and another prominent malware family, Ghostpush. Finally, we will share our strategies for re-securing affected users and the steps taken to dismantle the botnet's infrastructure.
