# Messages
## RSVP
* PATH - From originator to terminating GW
* RESVs - in response
* PATHs again to originator from terminator
* RESVs in response
* ResvConfs in response from terminator
* PHOP recorded (previous hop) put in Path messages to point return path for next device
* Periodic refresh messages
# Concepts
* TxQueue or Tx Ring on interface
 * FIFO
 * No effect from IOS tools
 * Shrinks to small length when tools exist
 * `tx-ring-limit 1`
* Queueing on Ints versus Subifs and VCs
 * Shaping function queues packets, by default in fifo queue  
# Packet formats
* IP header
* 802.1p
* FR Header
* ATM Cell Priority
## IP Header and DSCP
* RFC791 defined 1 byte ToS field
 * High order 3 bytes IPP
  * Routine, Priority, Immediate, Flash, Flash Override, Critical, Internetwork Control, Network Control
 * 3 to 6 - flags, 7 not defined
* ToS byte renamed DiffServ
 * 6 bit field instead of IPP (0-5 bits)
  * Replaces precedence and ToS
  * ToS byte and DS field same length
### DSCP
* Decimal 46 - EF
* Class Selector
 * RFC 2475
 * CS0 - Binary 000000
 * CS1 - Binary 001000
 * CS2 - Binary 010000
 * Etc up to CS7
* AF PHB
 * Three levels of drop prob
 * 4 Classes
 * 4xy, X being queue, Y being priority
  * Higher X, better treatment
  * Higher Y worse drop
  * AF11, 12 and 13 - 001010, 001100, 001110
  * AF21, 22 and 23 - 010010, 010100, 010110
  * AF31, 32 and 33 - 011010, 011100, 011110
  * AF41, 42 and 43 - 100010, 100100, 100110
  * Decimal from name - 8x + 2y
  * Still IPP compatible
### LAN CoS
* 3 bit QoS Field
* Only with .1q or ISL
* 3 most sig bits in tag control, user priority in 1q
* 3 least sig from 1 byte user field, called CoS in ISL
### WAN
* FR and ATM have single bit for drop probablity
* DE for FR, CLP for ATM
* Can be set by rotuer or ATM/FR switch
* MPLS EXP bit, remarks DSCP or IPP usually
# Trivia
* Classify on ingress only, mark on egress only
## Bandwidth Delay Product
* Product of capacity and round trip delay
* Equiv to max data amount on a circuit at any given time
* long fat network - 12500 bytes or more
 * High bw, not great delay
 * geosatellite for example
* TCP Window scaling can help (send more bandwidth before requiring ack)
* Calc with bw x round trip
## MQC
* All MQC tools "Class Based"
* Class map matches
 * Can match QoS Fields, ACLs, macs
 * Case sensitive
 * match protocol - nbar
 * Match any - all packets
 * Up to four IPP or 8 DSCP in single match CoS, Prec or DSCP
  * matches any, not all
 * Can define to match any or match all for multiple matches
 * Match class matches another class map (so can match all in one, then match any in another)
* Policy map applies actions
* service policy binds to interface
### NBAR
* Can refer to hostname, URL, mime type etc
* Citrix
* RTP matching on even number only, can classify payload (odd numbers are contro)
* `ip nbar protocol discovery` - Not required after 12.2T/12.3
* Upgrade PDLMs, add with `ip nbar pdlm NAME`
### CB Marking
* CEF required
* Processed sequentially, onced match no further
* Multiple sets allowed
* Class-default for unmatch
* Load interval sub command defines how often IOS measures packets/rates on interface
 * lower quick, default 5 mins, lowest 30s
### Pre-Classification
* For traffic to be encrypted
* ToS byte to tunnel header (in IPSec transport, tunnel and GRE)
* Can't use NBAR for this
* Pre-classification instead, keeps traffic in memory
* Use `qos pre-classify` on tunnel, VT or crypto map
* See with show interface and show crypto-map
 * Int tunnel for GRE and IPIP
 * VT - L2F and L2TP
 * Crypto map - IPSec
### Policy routing
* Mark IPP or ToS on ingress packets
## Auto QoS
### VoIP
**Switches**
* Enabled per int
* CDP detects phone (soft or hardware)
 * auto qos voip {cisco-phone | cisco-softphone}
 * If no phone found, DSCP 0
 * If phone, trust QoS markings
 * Voice/video control, real time video, voice, routing and STP BPDUs in priority queue
 * All others in normal
 * On egress, voice in priority, rest on others
* On uplinks/trusts, trusts CoS/DSCP, sets up int qos
 * auto qos voip trust - Trusts DSCP and CoS
* Globally enables QoS
* CoS-DSCP and reverse maps created
* Priority queues
* CoS/DSCP values mapped to queues/thresholds
* Class maps and policy maps identify/prioritize/police voice
**Routers**
* auto qos voip [trust]
* Need int bandwidth setting
 * Below 768kbps - compression and frag, PPP encap, PPP multilink, LFI
 * Traffic shaping and service policy at all bandwidths
* If trust, class maps group traffic on DSCP
* If not, ACLs match voice, data and control, rest DSCP0
### Enterprise
* auto discovery qos [trust]
* CEF required, bandwidth config'd
* Trust for traffic marked already
* NBAR discovery
* Run it long enough, then apply
 * Routing - CS6 - Routing protos
 * VoIP - EF - RTP
 * Interactive Video - AF41 - RTP
 * Streaming video - CS4 - real audio, netshow
 * Control - CS4 - RTCP, H323, SIP
 * Transaction - AF21 - SAP, Citrix, telnet, SSH
 * Bulk - AF11 - FTP, SMTP, POP3, exchange
 * Scavenger - CS1 - P2P
 * Management - CS2 - SNMP, SYSLOG, DHCP, DNS
 * Best Effort - Everything else
* `auto qos` in interface
 * DLCI - Applies to FR map class, class to DLCI
 * Turn off NBAR with `no auto discovery qos`
## CBWFQ and LLQ
* CBWFQ reserves bandwidth for each queue
* WFQ in default queue
* LLQ - Priority with bw limit
* Bandwidth in CBWFQ
* priority in LLQ
* 64 queues/classes
* Max queue length can be changed
* Class-default always exists
* If all queues with large number of packets, percentage of bandwidth as implied by config
 * If some empty, distributed proportionally
* FIFO on 63 queues, WFQ on class-default (Cisco 7500 can be WFQ on all)
* Schedules among all - Percentages of guaranteed bandwidth
### Defining and limiting bandwidth
* Pre IOS 15 - checked to make sure too much not allocated, service policy rejected
 * Based on bandwidth and max-reserved-bandwidth
* No max-reserved in IOS bw, based on int-bw
* bandwidth percent - based on int-bw
* If remaining percent, percentage of classes reserved bandwidth (from bandwidth percent)
* Explicit bw - sum of values lt or eq to max-res x int-bw
* Percent - lt or eq to max res
* remaining - lt or eq to 100
### LLQ
* Scheduled first
* `priority {bandwidth-kbps | percentage PERCENTAGE} [burst]` - Guaranteed min and policed max
 * burst 20% by default
* Actual bw from LLQ and nonLLQ not exceed max-res x int-bw
* LLQ took from remaining bw, meaning rest can total 100
* Bandwidth under class default - reserved
 * if not set, whatevers left
* Congestion = full hw queue
## WRED
* Monitors queue length - discards more when longer
* Average queue depth compared to min and max threshold
* If Avrg lt min - NO DROP
* Min lt Avrg lt Max - Random Drop
* Avrg gt Max - Full drop 
 * Not tail drop, as max thresh might not be full queue size
* MPD - Mark Probability denominator
 * Discard percentage at max threshold is 1/MPD
* Min Thresh 20, max 40, MPD of 10
* Between min and max, random drops
* At max, 10% discard
* Over max, 100% discard
### Weighting
* Each profile has min, max and MPD
* Higher MPD = lower drops during time b/w thresholds
* Defaults - DSCP, Min Thresh, max Thresh, MPD, 1/MPD
 * AFx1 - 33, 40, 10, 10%
 * AFx2 - 28, 40, 10, 10%
 * AFx3 - 24, 40, 10, 10%
 * EF - 37, 40, 10, 10%
## MDRR
* 12000 only
* 7 round robins (0-6), 1 priority
* When none in priority, each queue used once per cycle
* When in priority, strict or alternate
 * Strict - served first always - can get more than config'd bw
 * Alternate, 0, P, 1 P etc
* Quantum Value and Deficit
* QV - number of bytes
* Any extra bytes are deficit (can't take half packets)
* Each queue gets a guaranteed bw
## LAN Switch Congestion Management and Avoidance
### Ingress
* 3560 - Two Ingress queues, one can be PQ
* WTD has discard thresholds per queue
* SRR schedules
* Rate packets from ingress to switch fabric
 * In shared, bw shared between two queues according to weights
 * Bw guaranteed, not limitied
* If one queue emptry, other gets all bw
* Relative weights rather than absolutes (ratios), like CBWFQ with percentages
### Congestion Avoidance
* WTD on by default when QoS on switch
* Three thresh per queue (CoS based) - tail drop when particular percentage
* Defaut drop at 100% of queue
 * works for priority
* Could do Thresh 1 drops traffic for values 0-3 when reach 40%, 2 with Cos 4 and 5 at 60%, 3 for 6 and 7, 100%
* Thresh 3 always 100%
* Separate from queues config
## Egress Queuing
* Four queues
* Configure CoS/DSCP to queue
* Weights
* Drop threshold
* PQ always queue 1
* WTD config'd like ingress
* Commands at int level, not global
* Can shape to slow egress traffic
## Traffic Shaping
* Queues packets to delay
* release oer time
* Routers only send at clock rate
* Lowers rate by alternating between sending and silence
* Static time interval set (Tc)
* Bits per Tc = Bc (committed burst)
* Tc = Bc/CIR (in ms)
* Bc = committed burst in bits
* Shaped rate - Bps
* Be - excess burst, bits over Bc after inactivity
### Mechanics
* Tc = BC/Shape rate
* Token buckets
* Bucket filled every Tc start
* Each token 1 bit
* At start, shaping can release Bc bits
* Overflow - Used for Be if exists (can send more at next Tc)
### Generic Traffic Shaping
* `traffic-shape rate RATE [bc] [be] [buffer-limit]`
* Buffer = max queue buffer in Bps
* Only shaped rate required, Bc and Be then quarter of Rate
### CB Shaping
* Class for different shape rates
* `shape [average | peak] MEAN-RATE [[burst-size][excess-burst-size]]`
* On 320kbps or less
 * 8000 bits Bc and BE
 * Tc = Bc/shape rate
* On more
 * BC = shape rate by tc
 * Be=Bc
 * Tc = 25ms
**Bandwidth Percent**
* Sees bw of int or subint
* Sub ints don't inherit phy bw, 1544 default
