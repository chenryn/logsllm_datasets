Trace collection. We used saturatr [64] to collect network link
traces in various environments. Figure 15a–15b are two examples
of our traces that we collected for our extreme mobility evaluation.
In our multi-path experiment, we always replayed different traces
collected in the same environment on different paths. Figure 15c
shows an example of a pair of multi-path traces.
Experiments with Mahimahi. In order to compare with other
multi-path protocols with Mahimahi, we implemented a simple
“video player” in C, which sequentially requested data chunks from
a web-server and consumed received data at a constant bit-rate,
which was configurable (to emulate playing videos with different
resolutions). The video player ran inside mpshell, accessed our web-
server via emulated links. Both the player and the web-server could
be configured to run on top of different transport schemes (e.g.,
XLINK, vanilla-MPQUIC, and MPTCP). With this setup, we were
able to evaluate XLINK and other schemes with consistent metrics.

EVALUATION
In addition to tests in real-world deployment, we used the multi-
path extension of Mahimahi, mpshell [63], as our network emulator
to understand the inner dynamics of multi-path transport. Thanks
to its highly accurate network link emulation based on packet
delivery traces collected in realistic networks, we were able to unveil
the low-level details about why vanilla-MPQUIC failed to timely
adapt to network changes. We could also quickly verify the results
of XLINK’s QoE-driven multi-path scheduling and management
