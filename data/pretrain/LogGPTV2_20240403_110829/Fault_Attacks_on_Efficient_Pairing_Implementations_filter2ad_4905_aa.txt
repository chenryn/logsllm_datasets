## Abstract
This paper investigates the security of efficient pairing implementations, both with compressed and standard representations, against fault attacks. We demonstrate that these attacks can solve the Fixed Argument Pairing Inversion (FAPI) problem and recover the first or second argument of the pairing inputs by injecting double-faults on the loop counters. This work extends the initial attack by Page and Vercauteren on supersingular elliptic curves in characteristic three, addressing efficient pairing implementations for the first time.

Most efficient Tate pairings are computed using a Miller loop followed by a Final Exponentiation. Previous research has shown how to invert only the Miller loop, and a recent paper by Lashermes et al. at CHES 2013 demonstrated how to invert only the final exponentiation. However, the CHES attack is not effective against efficient and concrete implementations, as it requires very expensive inversions, which are typically avoided in practice.

We show that our fault attacks can solve the FAPI-1 and FAPI-2 problems for both compressed and standard pairing implementations. The efficiency of our attacks is demonstrated through simulations using Sage on concrete implementations.

## 1. Introduction
Pairing-based cryptography is a significant area in public-key cryptography, with many cryptosystems defined and deployed due to their appealing properties. Efficient implementations of pairings in various environments (software, hardware, constrained hardware) have been proposed, including Tate, Eta, and Ate pairings. Given the deployment of these schemes, it is crucial to study their resistance to physical attacks, especially in smartcard implementations.

A pairing is a bilinear function \( e(·,·) \) that maps two elliptic curve groups to a finite subgroup of a finite field, such that \( e(aP, bQ) = e(P, Q)^{ab} \). It was first introduced to attack the discrete log problem in some elliptic curves. Later, Joux and others showed its utility in building efficient cryptographic protocols, such as tripartite Diffie-Hellman and Identity-Based Encryption (IBE).

The fixed argument pairing inversion problem (FAPI) was defined by Galbraith et al. and is particularly relevant for attacking IBE schemes. In such schemes, users compute the pairing \( e(d_{ID}, u) \) between the secret key \( d_{ID} = sQ_{ID} \) and the first element of the ciphertext \( (u, v) \), where \( u = rP \). Depending on the implementation, the secret input \( d_{ID} \) can be the first or second argument.

Efficient pairings, such as variants of the Tate pairing, are computed in two steps: the Miller loop followed by the Final Exponentiation. Different pairings, including Weil, Tate, Ate, Eta, and Optimal Ate, have been implemented efficiently, with Barreto-Naehrig (BN) curves being among the most efficient.

## 2. Related Work
In 2006, Page and Vercauteren proposed the first fault attack to invert pairing computations, solving the FAPI-1 and FAPI-2 problems for the Duursma and Lee implementation on supersingular curves. Since then, several attacks have targeted the Miller Loop, with El Mrabet proposing techniques to invert it. These attacks exploit the square-and-multiply algorithm used in the Miller loop.

However, inverting the Final Exponentiation has proven more challenging. Whelan and Scott concluded that the final exponentiation is difficult to invert, protecting the output of the Miller Loop. The Final Exponentiation involves computing \( f^{(q^k-1)/r} \), which is split into three exponentiations for BN curves with an embedding degree of 12. The first two exponentiations use the Frobenius map, while the final one uses a square-and-multiply algorithm. Efficient implementations avoid expensive inversions by using conjugates.

Lashermes et al. at CHES 2013 showed a technique to invert the final exponentiation, but their method is not practical for efficient implementations. They proposed countermeasures, including using Frobenius or compressed pairing. Recent work by Blömer et al. also addresses inverting the pairing computation, but their fault model is specific to their own implementation.

## 3. Our Contributions
In this paper, we present fault attacks on efficient and compressed pairing implementations. We describe attacks that fully invert the Tate pairing and the Final Exponentiation for both standard and compressed representations. For standard representations, we reduce the problem to inverting pairing with compressed representations. Our attacks are efficient and can recover the secret elements, solving the FAPI-1 and FAPI-2 problems. We provide Sage code to demonstrate the effectiveness of our attacks.

Our fault model is similar to Page and Vercauteren's, where the adversary injects faults in the loop counters to stop the Miller loop and Final Exponentiation before their expected end. We use double faults, which are recognized as efficient in practice. We target concrete implementations of compressed pairings, specifically those using Barreto-Naehrig curves, and show that even the most efficient pairing implementations are vulnerable to our attacks.

## 5. Preliminaries
### 5.1 Pairing on Elliptic Curves
We consider an elliptic curve \( E(F_p) \) defined over a finite field \( F_p \) of large characteristic \( p > 5 \). Let \( n \) be the order of \( E(F_p) \), \( r \) a large prime divisor of \( n \), and \( k \) the smallest integer such that \( r \) divides \( p^k - 1 \). The integer \( k \) is called the embedding degree of \( E \) with respect to \( r \).

A pairing is a bilinear function \( e(·,·) \) that maps two elliptic curve groups to a finite subgroup of a finite field. The degree of a divisor \( A \) is zero if the sum of the coefficients is zero. A divisor \( A \) is principal if there exists a function \( f \) such that \( (f) = A \).

### 5.2 Divisors and Functions
Let \( G_1, G_2, \) and \( G_3 \) be three finite groups, typically with \( G_1 \) and \( G_2 \) being additive and \( G_3 \) being multiplicative. The scalar multiplication between a point \( P \in E \) and an integer \( a \) is denoted by \( [a]P \). A divisor is a formal sum of points on the curve \( E(F_p) \).

## Conclusion
This paper presents novel fault attacks on efficient pairing implementations, demonstrating the vulnerability of both compressed and standard representations. Our attacks solve the FAPI-1 and FAPI-2 problems and are efficient in practice, as shown through simulations. Future work should focus on developing robust countermeasures against these attacks.
