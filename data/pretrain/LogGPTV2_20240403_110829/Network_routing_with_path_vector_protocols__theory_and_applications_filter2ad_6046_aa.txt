ABSTRACT
Path vector protocols are currently in the limelight, mainly
because the inter-domain routing protocol of the Internet,
BGP (Border Gateway Protocol), belongs to this class. In
this paper, we cast the operation of path vector protocols
into a broad algebraic framework and relate the convergence
of the protocol, and the characteristics of the paths to which
it converges, with the monotonicity and isotonicity proper-
ties of its path compositional operation. Here, monotonicity
means that the weight of a path cannot decrease when it is
extended, and isotonicity means that the relationship be-
tween the weights of any two paths with the same origin
is preserved when both are extended to the same node. We
show that path vector protocols can be made to converge for
every network if and only if the algebra is monotone, and
that the resulting paths selected by the nodes are optimal if
and only if the algebra is isotone as well.
Many practical conclusions can be drawn from instances
of the generic algebra. For performance-oriented routing,
typical in intra-domain routing, we conclude that path vec-
tor protocols can be made to converge to widest or widest-
shortest paths, but that the composite metric of IGRP (In-
terior Gateway Protocol), for example, does not guarantee
convergence to optimal paths. For policy-based routing, typ-
ical in inter-domain routing, we formulate existing guide-
lines as instances of the generic algebra and we propose new
ones. We also show how a particular instance of the alge-
bra yields a suﬃcient condition for signaling correctness of
internal BGP.

INTRODUCTION
Path vector protocols have recently attracted much atten-
tion, mostly because the only protocol for inter-domain rout-
ing in the Internet, BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) [13, 16,
9], belongs to this class of protocols. Other protocols seem
to follow suit, such as those for optical inter-networking [1]
and telephony routing over IP [14].
We feel that current analysis of path vector protocols have
been too tied to the speciﬁcs of particular systems hindering
a broad understanding of what can and cannot be accom-
plished with those protocols in terms of convergence and
characteristics of the paths the protocols converge to.
In
this work, we provide a modern algebraic theory of path
vector protocols. The algebra comprises a set of labels, a
set of signatures, and a set of weights. There is an op-
eration to obtain the signature of a path from the labels
of its constituent links, and a function mapping signatures
into weights. Ultimately, each path will have a weight, and
these weights are ordered so that any set of paths with the
same origin and destination can be compared. The concept
of optimal path follows naturally from this framework, and
we adjoin it with the more general concept of local-optimal
path.
The challenge in this approach is to ﬁnd exactly the prim-
itive properties that should be imposed on the algebra so
that deﬁnite and general statements about protocol conver-
gence can be made. Monotonicity and isotonicity are the
two such properties. Monotonicity means that the weight of
a path does not decrease when it is extended, and isotonic-
ity means that the relationship between the weights of any
two paths with the same origin is preserved when both are
extended to the same node. We conclude that path vector
protocols can be made to converge robustly, for every net-
work, if and only if the algebra is monotone. In this case,
the set of paths the protocol converges to are local-optimal
paths. The local-optimal paths become optimal paths if and
only if the algebra is isotone as well as monotone.
Many applications can be drawn from the general theory.
For environments where routing performance is the main
concern, we conclude, for example, that path vector pro-
tocols can be used to make packets travel over widest or
widest-shortest paths, but that the composite metric used
by IGRP (Interior Gateway Routing Protocol) [2] does not
make them travel over optimal paths. The most immediate
practical application of the generic framework, however, is
to policy-based routing and BGP. We formulate the guide-
lines of Gao and Rexford [4] and Gao, Griﬃn and Rexford [3]
in algebraic terms, showing that the ﬁrst can be regarded as
an optimal path problem but the latter cannot. The frame-
work is also used to present new guidelines for policy-based
routing with BGP, to discuss QoS (Quality-of-Service) ex-
tensions to BGP [17], and to derive a suﬃcient condition for
signaling correctness of iBGP (internal BGP).
We discuss related work in the next section. The network
model and some deﬁnitions are given in Section 3. The
properties of the algebra and the concepts of optimal and
local-optimal paths are presented in Section 4. The path
vector protocol used as reference appears in Section 5, and
the convergence results are stated and discussed in Section 6.
Section 7 is dedicated to applications and counter-examples,
leaving the proof of the main convergence result to Section 8.
Section 9 discusses the use of the algebraic framework in a
BGP context, just before the paper ends, in Section 10.
2. RELATED WORK
Besides the work on guidelines for policy-based routing
with BGP and QoS extensions to BGP, already referred to
in the introduction, our work relates with two other research
areas: algebras for network routing; convergence of path
vector protocols.
The application of modern algebraic concepts to network
routing problems seems to have been initiated by Sobrinho
[15], with a study on optimal path routing supported on
link-state protocols. The algebra in the present work con-
templates both optimal and local-optimal path routing and
is the one algebra suited to path vector protocols, as opposed
to link-state protocols.
The convergence of generic path vector protocols was ﬁrst
studied by Griﬃn, Shepherd, and Wilfong [6, 7] using a com-
binatorial model. In this model, the problem is represented
by sets of ordered paths, one set per node, leading to a
representation whose size may be exponential in the size of
the network. This cardinality is carried through to the size
of the data structures used to verify convergence, exacting
a computational toll on such a veriﬁcation. The algebraic
model presented here is positioned at a higher level of ab-
straction than the combinatorial model bringing two main
advantages. On the one hand, an algebra provides a seman-
tic context for the design and speciﬁcation of routing strate-
gies. On the other hand, the monotonicity and isotonicity
of an algebra, properties which can typically be checked at
low computational complexity (see Section 6.3), completely
determine the convergence properties of path vector proto-
cols.
3. NETWORK MODEL AND TERMINOL-
OGY
A network is modelled as a directed graph. Given link
(u, v) in the network, we say that node u is the head of the
link, that node v is an out-neighbor of node u, and that node
u is an in-neighbor of node v. In general, the presence of
link (u, v) in the network means that packets can ﬂow from
u to v and that signaling routing messages may be sent in
the opposite direction, from v to u.
A path is a directed graph with node and link sets of the
form {un, un−1,·· · , u1} and {(un, un−1),··· , (u2, u1)}, re-

spectively. This path is represented by unun−1 ··· u1, with
un and u1 being its origin and destination, respectively.
Given two paths Q and P , if their nodes are distinct ex-
cept for the destination of Q and the origin of P , then their
union is also a path which we denote by Q ◦ P .
In par-
ticular, if uv is a path with only two nodes, then the path
uv ◦ P is called the extension of path P to node u. If link
(u1, un) is added to path un ··· u2u1, we obtain a cycle. This
cycle is represented as unun−1 ··· u1u0 with the understand-
ing that u0 = un. An in-tree is a directed graph with the
following three properties: there is only one node, called the
root, without out-neighbors; all nodes other than the root
have one and only one out-neighbor; there is a path from
every node to the root. Figure 1 shows an in-tree rooted
at node 0. In-trees are the graph structures one expects to
ﬁnd when forwarding packets based only on their destination
addresses.
4. ALGEBRA
4.1 Properties
The algebra is a seven-tuple (W,(cid:5), L, Σ, φ,⊕, f ). It com-
prises a set weights, W , a set of labels, L, and a set of sig-
natures, Σ, with special signature φ. The set of weights is
totally ordered by the relation (cid:5). The operation ⊕ has do-
main L×Σ and range Σ, and the function f maps signatures
to weights. Properties of the algebra are given next:
Maximality ∀α∈Σ−{φ}
Absorption ∀l∈L l ⊕ φ = φ
Monotonicity ∀l∈L∀α∈Σ f (α) (cid:5) f (l ⊕ α)
Isotonicity ∀l∈L∀α,β∈Σ f (α) (cid:5) f (β)
f (α) ≺ f (φ)
⇒ f (l ⊕ α) (cid:5) f (l ⊕ β)
Maximality and absorption are trivial properties, which
we assume always hold. The interesting properties, on which
we center our study, are monotonicity and isotonicity. Mono-
tonicity is important for convergence of path vector proto-
cols, and the conjunction of monotonicity and isotonicity is
important for convergence to optimal paths.
The relation ≺ is deﬁned such that a ≺ b if a (cid:5) b and
a (cid:11)= b, and the relation (cid:12) is deﬁned such that a (cid:12) b if
b ≺ a. We make the distinction between monotonicity, as
just deﬁned, and its stronger kin, called strict monotonicity:
Strict monotonicity ∀l∈L∀α∈Σ−{φ}
f (α) ≺ f (l ⊕ α)
4.2 Optimal and local-optimal paths
Each network link carries a label, and each network path
has a signature. The label of link (u, v) is denoted by l(u, v).
The signature of the trivial path composed of node d alone
is denoted by s(d). The signature of the non-trivial path
uv ◦ Q is deﬁned inductively as follows:
s(uv ◦ Q) = l(u, v) ⊕ s(Q).
The operation s is well-deﬁned since path Q has one less
node than path uv ◦ Q. We refer to f (s(P )) as the weight of
path P . Monotonicity implies that f (s(P )) (cid:5) f (s(Q ◦ P )),
that is, the weight of a path cannot decrease when it is
preﬁxed by another path. On the other hand, isotonicity
yields that f (s(P )) (cid:5) f (s(R)) implies f (s(Q◦P )) (cid:5) f (s(Q◦
R)), that is, the weight relationship between two paths with
the same origin is preserved when both are preﬁxed by a
common, third, path.
A path is usable if its signature is diﬀerent from φ. An
optimal path from node u to d is a usable path with weight
less than or equal, according to the order (cid:5), to the weight of
any other path from u to d. An optimal-paths in-tree rooted
at node d is an in-tree rooted at d which satisﬁes the next
two conditions:
• if node u belongs to the in-tree, then the only path in
the in-tree from u to d is an optimal path;
• if node u does not belong to the in-tree, then there is
no optimal path from u to d.
Contrary to the concept of optimal path, the concept of
local-optimal path from node u to node d exists only with
respect to a set of paths, each with origin in an out-neighbor
of node u and destination at node d. Let V be a set of such
paths, and let V be the extensions of the paths in V to node
u.
V = {uv ◦ P : P ∈ V, u is not a node of P}.
A local-optimal path with respect to the set V is a usable
path of V with weight less than or equal to the weight of
any other path in V. Given an in-tree rooted at node d, Td,
we deﬁne Vu(Td) as the set of in-tree paths which have an
out-neighbor of node u for origin and node d for destination.
For instance, in the in-tree T0 of Figure 1, we have V1(T0) =
{0, 3 0, 4 1 3 0}. The in-tree Td is a local-optimal-paths
in-tree if it satisﬁes the next two conditions:
• if node u belongs to the in-tree, then the only path
in the in-tree from u to d is a local-optimal path with
respect to Vu(Td);
• if node u does not belong to the in-tree, then there
is no local-optimal path from u to d with respect to
Vu(Td).
So, in a local-optimal-paths in-tree, the in-tree path from
node u to the destination is local-optimal with respect to
the in-tree paths with origin at the out-neighbors of node u.
We will now establish that, given a monotonic algebra,
a local-optimal-paths in-tree is an optimal-paths in-tree if
and if the algebra is isotone. First, we need the following
proposition.
Proposition 1. If the algebra is isotone as well as mono-
tone, then there is an optimal path from node u to node d
such that all of its subpaths with destination at d are optimal
paths on their own.
Proof. We sketch a proof by contradiction. Suppose the
algebra is both monotone and isotone and that for every
path from u to d there is a node along this path such that
the subpath with origin at that node and destination at d is
not an optimal path. Let u1u2 · ·· uk ◦ P be an optimal path
from u = u1 to d for which u1u2 ··· uk is a maximal subpath
(i.e., k is maximal) such that the subpath with origin at ui,
1 ≤ i  1, be the smallest index such that either ui does
not belong to Td or Pi is not an optimal path. In the lat-
ter case, we have f (s(uiui−1 ·· · u1)) ≺ f (s(Pi)). Both Pi−1
and ui−1 ··· u1 are optimal paths, Pi−1 ∈ Vui (Td) and, from
monotonicity, Pi−1 does not contain ui. From isotonicity,
f (s(ui−1 ··· u1)) = f (s(Pi−1)) implies f (s(uiui−1 ··· u1)) =
f (s(uiui−1 ◦ Pi−1)).
In particular, s(uiui−1 ◦ Pi−1) (cid:11)= φ,
so that node ui has to belong Td. But then f (s(uiui−1 ◦
Pi−1)) ≺ f (s(Pi)) which contradicts the assumption of Pi
