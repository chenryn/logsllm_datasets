vices, and therefore does not consider the integrity and
authenticity of provenance-aware applications.
Provenance collection is a form of information ﬂow
monitoring that is related, but fundamentally distinct,
from past areas of study. Due to space constraints, our
discussion of Information Flow Control (IFC) systems
has been relegated to our technical report [8].
9 Conclusion
In this work, we have presented LPM, a platform for
the creation of trusted provenance-aware execution en-
vironments. Our system imposes as little as 2.7% per-
formance overhead on normal system operation, and can
respond to queries about data object ancestry in tens of
milliseconds. We have used LPM as the foundation of
a provenance-based data loss prevention system that can
scan ﬁle transmissions to detect the presence of sensitive
ancestors in just tenths of a second. The Linux Prove-
nance Module Framework is an exciting step forward for
both provenance- and security-conscious communities.
