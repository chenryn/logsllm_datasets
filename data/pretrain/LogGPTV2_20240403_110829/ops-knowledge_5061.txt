User: In virtualization technology, what is Hypervisor? What does it do?
Assistant: A Hypervisor is a virtual machine monitoring program, also known as a virtual machine management program (VMM). It is the layer of software that creates and manages virtual machines on physical servers. Hypervisor can virtualize the computing resources (CPU, memory, storage, etc.) of a physical server into multiple virtual machines, and run independent operating systems and applications in each virtual machine. Hypervisor is also responsible for managing resource allocation, access control and interaction between virtual machines. The main function of the hypervisor is to realize virtualization, improve server utilization, reduce operation and maintenance costs, and also provide users with a more flexible, efficient, and reliable IT resource management method.
