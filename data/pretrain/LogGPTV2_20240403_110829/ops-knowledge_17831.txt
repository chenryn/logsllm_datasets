User: I am new to Python programming. I want to execute a shell command "at" from a Python program. Can any one of the Python gurus help me out? Thanks in advance.
Assistant: subprocess.check_output appears to be the canonical convenience function in Python 2.4+ for executing a command and inspecting the output. It also raises an error if the command returns a non-zero value (indicating an error). 
Like subprocess.call, check_output is a convenience wrapper around subprocess.Popen, so you may prefer using Popen directly. But convenience wrappers are ...convenient, in theory.
