I have such code:
    new webpack.NormalModuleReplacementPlugin(
                REG_EXP_FOR_FILES,
                function (result) {
                    const matches = result.request.match(REG_EXP_FOR_FILES);
                    const routes = `${matches[1]}/index.js`;
                    if (fs.existsSync(path.resolve(__dirname, routes))) {
                        result.request = routes;
                    }
                }
            ),
But in case of file doesn't exist I have error `Module is not found`. But I
need to have no errors and have no hook files like `empty.js`.
Ho can skip file resolving with normal modules resolver?
