User: So I have a C program to interface with an i2c device. I need to interface to that device from python. I'm just wondering if it's worth porting the program into a python module or if the amount of effort involved in porting won't outweigh just executing the program using subprocess. I know I'm sure it's different for every application, but I'd like to know if it's even worth my time to learn the python C extensions and port this program.
Update: I have full access to the source of both the C as well as the python. But there is already substantial work done on the python side and I'd like to keep changes to that as minimal is possible, if that matters. And I'd also like to minimize the changes that have to be made to the C. It's doable, but I didn't write it and it involves a lot of by addressing that I'd rather not have to redo.
Assistant: I've had good luck using ctypes. Whatever you choose, though, you may not gain any time this time but the next time around your effort will be much faster than doing the whole thing in C.
