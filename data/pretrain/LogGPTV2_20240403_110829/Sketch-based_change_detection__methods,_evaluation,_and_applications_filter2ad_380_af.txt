to explore combining sampling techniques with our approach
for increased scalability.
• Better guidelines for choosing parameters: Given the wide
range of parameters we have, it would be useful to have rea-
sonable guidance for selecting proper and justiﬁable values
for them. The full factorial method [5] in the statistical ex-
perimental design domain can help in narrowing the number
of levels (or ”versions”) for the various variables. We are
exploring such techniques to see which parameters are inde-
pendent of each other and move towards identifying reason-
able values overall based on the similarity. For example, H
has overall impact independent of other parameters. The te-
dium related to having multiple runs can also be reduced for
example by using Yates algorithm [5].
7. SUMMARY
In this paper, we presented a sketch-based change detection tech-
nique. Our work is motivated by anomaly detection and other ap-
plications that can beneﬁt from having a quick and efﬁcient change
detection mechanism. The scheme is capable of detecting signiﬁ-
cant changes in massive data streams with a large number of net-
work time series. As part of the technique, we designed a variant
of the sketch data structure, called k-ary sketch, which uses a con-
stant, small amount of memory, and has constant per-record up-
date and reconstruction cost. We implemented a variety of time
series forecast models (ARIMA, Holt-Winters, etc.) on top of such
summaries and detect signiﬁcant changes by looking for ﬂows with
large forecast errors. We also presented heuristics for automatically
conﬁguring the forecast model parameters.
We demonstrate using a large amount of real Internet trafﬁc data
that our sketch-based change detection method is highly accurate
when compared with per-ﬂow analysis, and can be implemented at
low computation and memory costs. Our preliminary results are
promising and point to the potential of using our technique as a
building block for network anomaly detection and trafﬁc measure-
ment in large networks.
