User: Need to know what's the difference between setup.py and setup.cfg. Both are used prominently in openstack projects
Assistant: setup.py is an integral part of a python package which includes details or information about the files that should be a package. This includes the required dependencies for installation and functioning of your Python package, entry points, license, etc. 
setup.cfg on the other hand is more about the settings for any plug-ins or the type of distribution you wish to create. bdist/sdist and further classification of universal or core-python wheel. It can also be used to configure some meta-data of the setup.py.
