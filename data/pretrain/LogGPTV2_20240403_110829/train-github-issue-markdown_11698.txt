==  
When plotting numpy's maskedarray with plot(), I could not see some data
points.  
A simple code follows. If I savefig() to png file, it works. If I savefig() to
pdf (or eps) file, it does not.
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np
    arr = np.array([1, 5, -3, -3, 5, -3, -3, 2, -3, -3, 7, -3, -3, 2])
    arrm = np.ma.masked_less(arr, 0)
    plt.figure()
    plt.plot(arrm, 'o')
    plt.savefig('a.png')
    plt.savefig('a.pdf')
