### User Profile Analysis Over a Week of Activity

**Table I: Logistic Regression Model for Account Compromise Detection**

A logistic regression model [7] is inherently suitable for single dichotomous label classification. The model is defined as \( L = \sum B_i X_i \), where \( L \) represents the natural logarithm of the odds that an account is compromised: \( L = \ln \left( \frac{\hat{p}}{1 - \hat{p}} \right) \). Here, \( \hat{p} \) is the estimated probability that the account is compromised. A higher value of \( L \) indicates a higher likelihood of the account being compromised. Each feature \( X_i \) has a corresponding coefficient \( B_i \), which means that a one-unit change in \( X_i \) results in a change of \( B_i \) in \( L \). The final classification uses a threshold to categorize accounts as either benign or possibly compromised.

### IV. Evaluation

#### A. Datasets and Ground Truth

We used two empirical datasets to evaluate UCAAS: a training set for feature tuning and model testing, and a validation set. A critical and challenging step in building the training set is obtaining the ground truth. We addressed this challenge through close collaboration with the security teams, who have extensive experience in dealing with compromised accounts over the past several years.

The first step was to collect known incident tickets from 2009 to 2011, which represent a subset of the total compromised accounts, as many are never identified. Therefore, we needed further manual checking of the dataset. However, the large volume of logs (around 6 million) made manual validation impractical. To address this, we ran heuristics discussed in Section III-B1 with conservative parameters to minimize false negatives. The flagged accounts were then sent to the security team, who examined each account and contacted the owners via email and telephone to assess whether the suspicious activity was indeed illegitimate. This validation often involved asking if the user had traveled to the foreign country identified in the data or if they shared credentials with others. For alumni or previous employees at UofM who could not be reached, the security team provided expert judgment. Finally, we manually examined the authentication activities of those compromised accounts and labeled their feature vectors as compromised during the days when we had high confidence in the illegitimate activity. We continuously refined the ground truth with the latest detection results during the evaluation process. We believe that most accounts were correctly labeled. It should be noted that users who shared their credentials with family and friends living abroad were excluded from our dataset, as these accounts, though matching the behavior of compromised accounts, were not actually compromised. Including them would negatively impact the classifier's accuracy. Although detecting shared credential accounts is not a goal of UCAAS, we did not count them as false positives if flagged by UCAAS, as sharing credentials is discouraged by the universities.

At UofM, the training data were collected from June 14 to June 28, 2011, and included 108,366 unique users with 2,129,275 authentication attempts. After filtering out users without VPN-related activities and conducting the validation process, we obtained a final training set of 2,441 benign and 87 compromised accounts. The empirical evaluation was done on a different validation set collected from September 14 to October 2, 2011, consisting of 6,562,153 login sessions from 127,316 unique users. At UIUC, the training data were collected from June 19 to July 2, 2011, with 104,172 successful logins from 25,530 users. After filtering and validation, we obtained a final training set of 4,692 benign and 6 compromised accounts. The evaluation set was collected from July 9 to July 23, 2011, and consisted of 106,477 logins from 24,979 unique users. The limited number of compromised accounts at UIUC led us to add 10 incidents detected by the security team during the first half of 2011. We carefully examined the impact of adding these incidents to ensure they improved model accuracy without affecting the false positive rate.

#### B. Feature Evaluation

In this subsection, we analyze the effectiveness of the feature set by comparing the proportions of benign and compromised accounts flagged by each feature. We also list the coefficients for significant features, as calculated by Weka when building the model. The coefficients represent the contribution of each feature to the model, so the presence of features with high coefficients indicates accounts that were likely compromised.

**Table II: Proportions of Authentication Attempts Flagged as Suspicious**

| Institution | Suspicious Behavior | Temporal-Spatial Violation | Suspicious IP Addresses | Suspicious Usage Pattern |
|-------------|---------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| UofM        | 42.08%              | 42.08%                     | 0                        | 37.60%                   |
| UIUC        | 11.88%              | 2.43%                      | 75.10%                   | 72.97%                   |

For both institutions, a higher proportion of compromised accounts exhibited suspicious behavior. Interestingly, no compromised account at UofM was reported as having a suspicious IP address in the training set, indicating a drastic evolution of the threat model, as half of the incidents in 2010 were linked to suspicious IP addresses. The coefficients for the features at UofM are: temporal-spatial violation (6.81), suspicious IP addresses (8.11), and suspicious usage pattern (-35.39). This aligns with our observations that suspicious IP addresses were highly negatively correlated with compromises, while the other two behaviors were positive indicators.

**Table VII: Service Usage Distribution**

| Institution | Service | % of Benign | % of Compromised |
|-------------|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| UofM        | Web-based services | 46.26%      | 28.39%            |
|             | VPN     | 53.74%      | 71.61%            |
| UIUC        | Web-based services | 4.24%       | 2.50%             |
|             | VPN     | 95.76%      | 97.50%            |

Compromised accounts were more likely to use the VPN rather than web-based services for both universities. The coefficients for the features of web-based service and VPN service at UofM are -0.37 and 0.38, respectively. However, the low proportion of web-based service usage at UIUC prevented us from computing meaningful performance results for website usage. Thus, Table VIII presents results only for UofM.
