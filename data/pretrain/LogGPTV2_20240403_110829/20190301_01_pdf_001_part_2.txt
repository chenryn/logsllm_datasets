* uniCores, or universal cores, mean either of the following: (i) a processor core in a single or multi-core processor chip or (ii) a virtual core
processor (“Virtual Core” also known as a “vCore”, “virtual CPU”, or “vCPU”) used to assign computing resources to a virtual machine.
In addition, Oracle charges separately for popular features that are commonly used or necessary such
as high availability configurations or geo-spatial capabilities. This places a burden on buyers to guess
well in advance what their applications’ requirements will be for years to come – a very difficult task
given the unpredictable nature of application development, expansion of data, changes in usage, and its
changing importance to the business over time. As circumstances change, you risk ending up with a lot
of expensive shelfware, a maze of ad hoc licenses, or worse, expensive Unlimited License Agreements
you don’t fully understand.
To complicate matters, Oracle makes all of its unbundled, for-pay features easily available and usable in
the software without restriction. This consistently results in unsuspecting users taking advantage of the
features as needs arise without realizing that they haven’t actually purchased the feature.
The combination of unbundled feature costs and easy access to non-purchased features creates a
potent mixture for explosive price increases at maintenance renewal time, at Certification time for an
Oracle ULA, or if you are audited by Oracle’s License Management Services group.
Oracle’s feature promiscuity and their customers’ lack of control are insightfully described in this blog
post by Craig Guarente, president of Palisade Consulting Group and former Global Vice President of
Contracts, Business Practices, and Migrations at Oracle.

RENEWAL POLICIES
As noted in Craig Guarente’s blog post above, customers more often than not do not fully understand
Oracle’s licensing policies.
EDB’s subscription-based business model provides many benefits to organizations compared to Oracle’s
perpetual licensing model and business practices. Generally EDB subscriptions are purchased and renew
on an annual or three-year basis although other terms are also available. The amount of software you may
deploy and use is measured by the number of uniCores you purchase for the annual or three-year term.
At renewal time you have a choice. You may purchase another one- or three-year subscription or you
may choose not to renew your subscription.
EDB renewals are treated in many ways like a new purchase. Prior to renewal time, you and EDB assess
your current needs, determine a quantity of uniCore usage that you require for the coming term and
then execute a new transaction. Furthermore, there is no automatic price increase built into an EDB
subscription renewal like the 3% annual price increases built into Oracle maintenance contracts.
When you choose to renew, you may purchase the same quantity of uniCores, more uniCores or even
fewer uniCores than originally purchased. EDB recognizes that there are many reasons why customers
may actually need to reduce their core usage (e.g., retiring applications, transitioning operational
databases to an archival status, database consolidation, and others). You pay no penalties of any kind for
reducing your consumption of EDB software.
If you choose not to renew, then you must decommission the software on all the cores you previously
purchased and discontinue using the software. You pay no penalties of any kind to discontinue use of
the software.
With Oracle, if you want to reduce your maintenance costs because you no longer need as many cores
as you purchased previously, you often run afoul of Oracles discount policies. Prior to getting your

discount, Oracle tries to combine as many items onto an order document as possible and then provides
the customer a consolidated discount. This will also determine your annual maintenance costs (22%)
which you may be trying to reduce.
However, the fine print of your contract states that the discount is based on the entire order and that any
changes in the future to the order document’s product configuration (i.e. core counts) allow Oracle to re-
price its discounts that will affect the future maintenance you were hoping to decrease.
The net result is that Oracle customers are rarely able to achieve real savings by reducing their usage.
While you may succeed in reducing your core count used to price your future maintenance costs, Oracle
will reduce your discount, often cancelling any savings you expect. This is a stark contrast to EDB’s
renewal policy described above that allows customers to choose to renew or not – without penalties.

Another key difference between Oracle and EDB renewals deals with out-of-compliance usage during
the maintenance term. EDB recognizes that organizations need to track their software usage and be
responsible customers, but also realizes that it can be a difficult or unintentional task.

During the term of your EDB subscription it is often the case that additional deployments of EDB
Postgres occur in the organization as it demonstrates its ability as a cost-effective Oracle alternative. As
the number of deployments increases, you may inadvertently begin using more uniCores than were
originally purchased.
Rather than take a punitive approach to compliance, EDB helps customers remain compliant by asking
customers to perform an annual accounting of their usage of EDB software and make any additional
purchase adjustments if needed. However, EDB customers that regularly account for their software usage
and true-up their costs with EDB are not charged retroactively for any overage in usage that occurs. Any
EDB true-up cost increases due to increased usage are applied against new subscription renewals and
not retroactively.
With Oracle, if your usage exceeds the number of cores you purchased, Oracle may charge you
retroactively for the overage, often resulting in a significant unplanned cost. If you are especially
unlucky, you may be submitted to an official software audit by Oracle’s License Management Services
organization. As noted in public articles, these events can be extremely stressful and distracting to an
Oracle customer:
Law firm warns of Oracle’s licensing ‘traps,’ Computerworld, Oct. 13, 2015, Responding to a License
Review Request from Oracle License Management Services, Scott & Scott, LLP.
Typically, if you ever get audited by Oracle, it is almost certain that they will find you out of compliance.
Being out of compliance then becomes a weapon that is frequently used as leverage in Oracle either
raising your prices or getting you to move onto other products, and especially cloud services, that serve
their business interests.
Finally, while you may own a perpetual license entitling you to use Oracle essentially forever, if you
should ever discontinue maintenance and then decide to reinstate it, Oracle will often charge you
retroactively for all the time you didn’t have a maintenance contract in place. EDB has no such policy.
It is easy to do business with EDB and there are no traps.

VIRTUAL LICENSING
POLICIES
Virtualization is now part of the foundation of most enterprise information and business systems.
Virtualization provides a wide variety of options to enterprises for deploying their applications, including
small scale virtualization on single machines, large scale virtualization or fabrics across the enterprise,
public service cloud providers, and private on-premises cloud environments.
The simplest (and most dramatic) way to compare EDB’s and Oracle’s virtual pricing is with a picture that
shows which hardware cores must be counted toward a purchase for a virtual deployment. As shown
in the image below, Oracle insists that every hardware core in your virtual infrastructure be counted
towards a purchase whereas EDB only requires those cores actually assigned to database virtual
machines to be counted.

The only way out of this all-or-nothing approach is to dedicate a virtualized machine or cluster of
machines to Oracle, which for many organizations reduces the flexibility and benefits they have with their
virtualization strategies. Oracle’s all-or-nothing policy applies to single database servers, sub-capacity
virtual use of a database server, a vSphere Cluster (if using VMWare), and all other clusters even though
they may not be running any database VMs but are part of your virtual fabric.

EDB’s uniCore pricing model is specifically designed to make it easier to use your database purchase
across any environment you choose: on-premises hardware, on-premises virtual (small or large scale),
on-premises cloud and public cloud. Once you purchase a uniCore, you can deploy it freely to any
environment. And should your deployment needs change, such as transitioning from on-premises
hardware to virtual machines offered in a public infrastructure, you may simply decommission your
uniCores from one environment and re-deploy them in the new one.
Oracle, however, has developed licensing policies that seem designed to make it difficult to impossible to
use any virtualization at all unless it’s a virtualization product owned by Oracle.

SOFTWARE COSTS
COMPARISON
Databases can be expensive and for good reason: they often hold the mission-critical information for
most businesses – operational data, sales transaction details, financial information, customer profiles,
purchasing patterns, product information, marketing data, research data, and much more. However, since
the inception of SQL in 1974, many SQL databases have entered the market from large companies like
Oracle, IBM, Microsoft, and many smaller companies as well. With so many players and a maturity based
on over 40 years of development, it is no wonder that for the vast majority of applications, databases may
be considered a commodity.
While databases from the big three mentioned above certainly have their place in many business-critical
applications, they may be considered overbuilt and overpriced for the vast majority of applications within
a large enterprise. This fact has been well captured by Gartner and noted in the opening paragraph of
this eBook.
