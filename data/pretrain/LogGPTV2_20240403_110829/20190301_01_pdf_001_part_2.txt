### A Business Practices Comparison of EDB PostgresTM and Oracle®

#### 1. Business Model
| Feature | Oracle Enterprise | EDB Postgres Enterprise |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| **Unit of Measure** | Cores | uniCores* |
| **Perpetual License Fee** | Yes (License included in maintenance-like subscription) | No |
| **Yearly Maintenance** | Yes | Yes |
| **Subscription** | CapEx + OpEx | OpEx |
| **Extra Costs for Accidental Usage of Features?** | All features are included in the subscription at no extra cost. | No |
| **Extra Costs for Other Tools?** | Yes | All tools are included in the subscription at no extra cost. |

*uniCores, or universal cores, refer to: (i) a processor core in a single or multi-core processor chip, or (ii) a virtual core processor (“Virtual Core” also known as a “vCore”, “virtual CPU”, or “vCPU”) used to assign computing resources to a virtual machine.

Oracle charges separately for popular features such as high availability configurations or geo-spatial capabilities. This places a burden on buyers to predict their future application requirements, which is challenging due to the unpredictable nature of application development, data expansion, usage changes, and evolving business needs. As circumstances change, customers may end up with expensive, unused licenses or complex licensing agreements.

Additionally, Oracle makes all unbundled, for-pay features easily accessible without restriction, leading to unsuspecting users utilizing these features without realizing they have not purchased them. This can result in significant price increases at maintenance renewal, certification, or during an audit by Oracle’s License Management Services group.

#### 2. Renewal Policies
| Feature | Oracle Enterprise | EDB Postgres Enterprise |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| **Automatic Maintenance Cost Increase** | 3% per year | 0% |
| **Continue Using Database Without Maintenance Contract?** | Yes | No |
| **Re-pricing Penalties if Core Count is Reduced?** | Original Order Document is re-negotiated, often with minimal or no savings realized. | No |
| **Retroactive True-up Costs?** | Yes | No |
| **Retroactive Costs for Restarting Maintenance?** | Must pay for all years lapsed. | No |
| **Special Business Division Compensated to Find Unreported Use of Software and Features?** | Yes (Oracle License Management Services) | No |

EDB's subscription-based model offers several advantages over Oracle's perpetual licensing model. EDB subscriptions are typically purchased and renewed annually or every three years, with other terms available. The amount of software you can deploy is based on the number of uniCores purchased.

At renewal, you have the option to purchase another one- or three-year subscription or discontinue your subscription without penalties. EDB renewals are treated like new purchases, with no automatic price increases. You can choose to purchase the same, more, or fewer uniCores, and there are no penalties for reducing your consumption.

In contrast, Oracle's discount policies make it difficult to achieve real savings by reducing core usage. Any changes to the order document's product configuration can lead to re-pricing, often negating any expected savings.

#### 3. Virtual Licensing Policies
| Feature | Oracle Enterprise | EDB Postgres Enterprise |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| **Flexible and Fair Virtual Pricing?** | Pay for all cores in the virtual infrastructure touched by a database VM. | Pay only for cores assigned to database VMs. |
| **Sub-capacity Virtualization Pricing (Single Machine Small Scale Virtualization)?** | Only for ‘hard-partitioned’ hardware environments. | Yes |
| **Free Movement of Licenses Between Private and Public Virtual Deployment Environments?** | No | Yes |

EDB's uniCore pricing model allows for flexible deployment across various environments, including on-premises hardware, on-premises virtual (small or large scale), on-premises cloud, and public cloud. Once purchased, uniCores can be deployed freely and redeployed as needed.

Oracle, on the other hand, has policies that make it difficult to use virtualization unless it is a product owned by Oracle. For example, Oracle requires that all hardware cores in the virtual infrastructure be counted towards a purchase, reducing the flexibility and benefits of virtualization strategies.

#### 4. Other Services
| Service | Oracle Enterprise | EDB Postgres Enterprise |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| **24x7 Technical Support** | Yes | Yes |
| **Support Ticket Portal** | Yes | Yes |
| **Software Maintenance Updates** | Yes | Yes |
| **Technical/Security Alerts** | Yes | Yes |
| **Severity 1 Bug Escalation and Hot Fixes** | Yes | Yes |
| **Technical Account Management** | Yes | Yes |
| **RemoteDBA** | Yes | Yes |
| **Training** | Live On Site, Live Online, On-demand | Live On Site, Live Online, On-demand |
| **Unlimited Training Subscription** | Yes | Yes |
| **Online eLearning Portal** | Yes | Yes |
| **Certification Programs** | Yes | Yes |
| **Professional Services** | Yes | Yes |

#### 5. Software Costs Comparison
Databases are often expensive because they hold mission-critical information for businesses, such as operational data, sales transactions, financial information, customer profiles, and more. While databases from major players like Oracle, IBM, and Microsoft are well-suited for many business-critical applications, they can be overbuilt and overpriced for most enterprise applications. This trend has been noted by Gartner and is a key consideration for organizations looking to optimize their database costs.

EDB Postgres provides a cost-effective alternative with a more flexible and transparent licensing model, making it easier for organizations to manage their database deployments and costs effectively.
