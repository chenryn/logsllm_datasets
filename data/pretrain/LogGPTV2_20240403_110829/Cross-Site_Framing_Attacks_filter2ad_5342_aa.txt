ABSTRACT
We identify the threat of cross-site framing attacks, which
involves planting false evidence that incriminates computer
users, without requiring access to their computer. We fur-
ther show that a variety of framing-evidence can be planted
using only modest framing-attacker capabilities. The at-
tacker can plant evidence in both the logs of popular rep-
utable sites and in the computer of the victim, without re-
quiring client-side malware and without leaving traces.
To infect the records of several of the most popular sites,
we identiﬁed operations that are often considered benign and
hence not protected from cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
attacks. We demonstrate the attacks on the largest search
engines: Google, Bing, and Yahoo!, on Youtube and Face-
book, and on the e-commerce sites: Amazon, eBay, and
Craigslist.
To plant pieces of framing evidence on the computer, we
abused the vulnerabilities of browsers and weaknesses in the
examination procedure done by forensic software. Speciﬁ-
cally, we show that it is possible to manipulate the common
NTFS ﬁle system and to plant ﬁles on the hard disk of the
victim, without leaving any traces indicating that these ﬁles
were created via the browser.
We validated the eﬀectiveness of the framing evidence
with the assistance of law authorities, in addition to using
prominent forensic software. This work also discusses tactics
for defense against cross-site framing and its applicability to
web-services, browsers, and forensic software.

Computers oﬀer high reliability for data retention, and
indeed, computer records are considered reliable and trust-
worthy. In many countries, computer records are often used
in criminal investigations and admitted as legal evidence.
Digital, computer, and network forensics, the science of col-
lecting forensic evidence related to the use of computers
and networks and to crimes involving them, is an impor-
tant and well-established discipline. It has many practition-
ers, methodologies, tools, and publications (e.g., [8, 18]). It
is not surprising that law-enforcement authorities spend a
considerable amount of eﬀort collecting computer-forensic
records for investigation and prosecution purposes.
Usually, computer records accurately reﬂect the actions
of the user, even when these actions are illegal or violate
social, business, or ethical codes. These records serve as
conﬁrmation even when the user denies any involvement
in these actions when confronted with these records. How-
ever, there are several known incidents in which computer
records were manipulated intentionally to cause a false im-
pression of wrongdoing, i.e., to frame the user. For exam-
ple, Spencer [27] presents case-studies of sophisticated, high-
proﬁle forgeries, with very signiﬁcant repercussions, which
were exposed only using advanced forensic techniques. Nev-
ertheless, only limited attention has been given by the re-
search community to the risk of forged digital evidence and
its potential use in framing users. In fact, this threat is rarely
even mentioned. This is in contrast to the related area of
digital image and video, where there is substantial eﬀort to
develop techniques that detect forgery. See survey [25].
While such computer-framing incidents are hopefully rare,
the damage can be signiﬁcant. For example, consider the
case of Michael Fiola [6].
In 2007, a technician (acciden-
tally) found child pornography in the browser-cache of Fi-
ola’s computer. Fiola was ﬁred and charged with possession
of child pornography, which carries up to ﬁve years in prison.
He endured death threats, his car tires were slashed, and he
was shunned by friends. The charge was dropped only a year
after the case was ﬁled, when an inspection for his defense
revealed that the laptop was severely infected. Fiola suf-
fered tremendous amount of ﬁnancial, emotional, and even
physical damages.
A major argument for Fiola’s vindication was the iden-
tiﬁcation of viruses on Fiola’s computer. Furthermore, the
evidence against Fiola consisted mostly of ﬁles containing
illegal content, and the web-history did not support search
and access to these ﬁles. Experts concluded that the illegal
ﬁles were downloaded by malware, which was controlled re-
motely by an unknown agent for his own purposes. What
161
would have happened if Fiola was intentionally framed and
the investigation would not have identiﬁed any malware on
his computer? Suppose further that an investigation would
have found seemingly-supportive evidence, such as a web-
history full of visits to pedophile sites, purchases and sales of
suspect content on eBay, search history of pedophile-related
terms in sites including Google, Facebook, Yahoo!, Bing,
Youtube, and Craigslist. What would have been the out-
come?
Computer-forensics has become an integral part of crimi-
nal investigations and the resulting evidence is used in many
trials. Defendants often argue that they were not responsi-
ble for the illegal content, which was collected by a virus or
otherwise without their awareness. This argument is often
ridiculed and referred to as ‘the dog ate my homework’ ex-
cuse. The common view among experts is that these claims
are mostly false. However, it is conceivable that some pieces
of evidence are due to intentional framing. They may also be
a result of ‘unintentional framing’, e.g., to hide traces of the
real criminal. Alternatively, the evidence may simply be due
to the operation of malware on the computer (for other pur-
poses). Unfortunately, in most courts and jurisdictions, the
burden of proof in such cases shifts to the defendant, who is
expected to show that a virus or other malware exists in the
system, and that the incriminating evidence is likely to have
resulted from its operation [9]. Providing such vindicating
proof can be challenging or infeasible, especially if the mal-
ware was designed to hide traces. And what if there simply
is no malware?
In this paper, we present the threat of cross-site framing
attacks, in which a computer user is intentionally framed by
a malicious adversary, using only cross-site communication
with the victim’s computer, and in particular, without re-
quiring the adversary to control the computer via malware
or otherwise. Such attacks can be deployed using limited
capabilities and resources. We believe our work can help mo-
tivate further study of such attacks, the adoption of appro-
priate defensive measures, and increased caution by forensic
analysts. We discuss defenses (as well as attacks), but signif-
icant challenges remain. Improved defenses against framing
attacks are vital for preventing wrongful convictions, as well
as preventing the real culprits from casting doubt over the
computer-forensics evidence against them.
Cross-site framing attacks only require that the victim
visits a malicious website. This is a relatively modest re-
quirement that the attacker can often ensure. We show how
such framing attacks allow attackers to ‘plant’ a wide va-
riety of incriminating evidence involving alleged-activity in
many diﬀerent and popular sites. The fact that the diﬀerent
pieces of evidence are of diﬀerent forms, and involve multi-
ple popular sites, makes the overall set of (framed) evidence
a formidable argument for incrimination.
We separate the discussion between framing evidence that
is planted in the logs and history-records of websites (fram-
ing web-services evidence), and evidence that is planted on
a device (framing computer evidence).
When investigating web-services evidence, we exclude at-
tacks that exploit ‘regular’ site or browser vulnerabilities.
This includes vulnerabilities that allow the attacker to take
over the victim’s account, or allow the attacker to run a
malicious script that the victim’s browser thinks is com-
ing from the third-party web-service (i.e., XSS). These are

known risks and there is no dispute about the need to block
them.
In spite of this limitation, we found that it is possible to
‘plant’ fake ‘evidence’ of diﬀerent types, in most popular
sites, as shown in Table 1. Some examples of web-service
evidence are as follows:
Search history. The terms a user searched for reﬂect
her interests and can be vulnerable to manipulation.
Relevant items history. Watched videos, watched
items, and clicked advertisements are examples of data that
the attacker can easily manipulate to forge the interests of
her victim.
We also show several types of evidence that an attacker
may be able to ‘plant’ in the victim’s computer, speciﬁcally:
Browser cache. Files can be planted in the browser
cache without leaving traces.
File download and browser history. Exploiting the
browser’s features, it is possible to automatically download
ﬁles to the computer of the victim and to add entries in the
browser’s history.
File system manipulations. We show how to manip-
ulate the common NTFS ﬁle system, which is used in all
the latest Windows operating systems, to plant ﬁles on the
hard disk of the victim’s computer. Our technique plants
the ﬁles such that they are not linked to the web. Namely,
the forensic software indicates a ﬁle found on the hard disk,
without linking it to browser-related folders.
The types of digital evidence we planted were used in legal
cases. Examples can be seen in Table 2. In addition to the
use of framing in the legal context, an adversary may also
use framing to discredit a victim in the social, workplace,
business, or political context. In particular, the adversary
can plant evidence to cause false beliefs about an individ-
ual, which may harm that individual and potentially beneﬁt
the adversary. For example, an adversary may plant false-
evidence about sexual orientation, inﬁdelity, or other issues.
Evaluation by Government Forensic Experts
We approached the National Cyber Unit of the National
Crime Unit (Lahav 433) in the Israel Police, and the Com-
puter Forensics Lab within the Department of Investigations
162
in the Israeli Law, Information and Technology Authority
(ILITA) of the Israel Ministry of Justice. We asked for their
help in evaluating how the (fake) evidence produced by our
attacks aﬀected their forensic investigation process. Both
organizations agreed to cooperate under their limitations.
We created two virtual machines (VMs) containing the re-
sults of our framing attack. We asked them to run their stan-
dard forensic procedure and let us know the results. Specif-
ically, we wanted to know whether their procedure detected
the framing evidence and whether there was any indication
or warning that the evidence may be fake.
The ﬁrst VM was framed with the following evidence: (1)
visiting a terrorist’s website, (2) search history and followed
links in Google, (3) search history in YouTube, and (4) au-
tomatically downloaded ﬁle. We used our ‘trace covering’
methods as described in Section 6.1. On the second VM
machine we planted an image on the hard disk, as described
in Section 5.2.
Both departments could not disclose the details of the
forensic investigation procedure, but gave us important feed-
back. The forensic experts in ILITA evaluated the computer
based framing attacks in the ﬁrst VM, and reported that
all the planted pieces of evidence were found by their ad-
vanced forensic software. However, they mentioned that in
one of the examined attacks (they could not specify), their
experts, following their extensive forensic procedure, identi-
ﬁed an anomaly, which would have resulted in careful further
investigation and evaluation of additional evidence.
The police helped us evaluate the attacks using two ad-
vanced and expensive forensic software tools: Encase and
IEF (unavailable to us). The police experts also told us
