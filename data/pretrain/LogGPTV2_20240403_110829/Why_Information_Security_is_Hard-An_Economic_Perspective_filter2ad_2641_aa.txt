## Abstract
A common view holds that information security can be achieved through technical measures such as improved access control policies, formal proofs of cryptographic protocols, and better tools for system evaluation. However, this paper argues that information insecurity is often due to perverse economic incentives. Many security problems can be more clearly and convincingly explained using microeconomic concepts like network externalities, asymmetric information, moral hazard, adverse selection, liability dumping, and the tragedy of the commons.

## 1. Introduction
In a study of fraud against automated teller machines (ATMs), it was found that patterns of fraud varied based on liability. In the United States, if a customer disputed a transaction, the bank had to prove the customer's mistake or dishonesty, incentivizing U.S. banks to secure their systems. Conversely, in countries like Britain, Norway, and the Netherlands, the burden of proof lay with the customer, making it almost impossible for them to challenge fraudulent transactions. This led to complacency among these banks, resulting in widespread fraud. U.S. banks, despite spending less on security, were more effective in preventing fraud [4].

Similar examples abound. Medical payment systems funded by insurers rather than hospitals often fail to protect patient privacy when it conflicts with the insurer's need for client data. Digital signature laws transfer the risk of forgery from the bank (which built the system) to the individual, while Common Criteria evaluations are conducted by commercial facilities paid by vendors, not by the relying party. Generally, when the party responsible for protecting a system is not the one bearing the consequences of a security failure, problems are likely to arise.

Another type of incentive failure became evident in early 2000 with distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on high-profile websites. These attacks use multiple compromised machines to flood a target with traffic, making it difficult to stop. While individual users might be willing to spend $100 on antivirus software to protect themselves, they are unlikely to spend even $1 on software to prevent their machines from being used to attack others. This exemplifies the "Tragedy of the Commons," where individuals act in their own self-interest, leading to collective harm. Varian proposed that the costs of DDoS attacks should fall on network operators, who can then pressure users to install defensive software or provide it as part of their subscription package [20].

These observations highlight the interaction between economics and computer security, prompting further exploration.

## 2. Network Externalities
Economists have extensively studied networks operated by phone companies, airlines, and credit card companies. The value of a network increases with the number of users, a principle known as Metcalfe's law. For example, the more people use the Internet, the more valuable it becomes. Similarly, the more merchants accept credit cards, the more useful they become to customers, and vice versa. This positive feedback loop can lead to rapid growth, as seen with the telegraph, telephone, fax machine, and the Internet.

The same principles apply to virtual networks, such as the user community of a popular software architecture. When developers believed the PC would outsell the Mac, they prioritized developing for the PC, reinforcing its market dominance. High fixed costs and low marginal costs in technology mean that pure price competition drives revenues down towards the marginal cost of production, which is zero for information. Therefore, businesses must sell on value rather than cost. Additionally, switching costs can lock users into a particular technology, even if competitors offer cheaper alternatives.

Network effects often lead to "winner-take-all" market structures dominated by a few firms. It is crucial to enter the market quickly and appeal to complementary suppliers, such as developers of "killer apps." Once customers have invested in complementary assets, they are locked in.

These network effects have significant implications for security engineers. For instance, the "Microsoft philosophy" of releasing products quickly and fixing them later is rational in markets with strong positive feedback. Another example is the lack of security support in software platforms like Windows 95/98, where mandatory security would make development more difficult. Network owners often shift support costs to users to attract developers, even if it compromises security. Public key cryptography, for example, simplifies development but places an administrative burden on users. Efforts to make security more user-friendly have met with mixed success, and constructing an authentication system that benefits from network effects, like Microsoft Passport, is a more subtle approach.

Governments are beginning to recognize the economic aspects of security failures, as seen in recent EU proposals to address market imperfections in network security [11].

## 3. Competitive Applications and Corporate Warfare
Network economics also influences security engineering in other ways. Companies often choose proprietary, obscure architectures to increase customer lock-in and raise the investment required for competitors to create compatible products. Patented algorithms, even if suboptimal, can impose licensing conditions on manufacturers, as seen with the DVD Content Scrambling System. Efforts to promote non-open standards continue in various applications, from SDMI and CPRM to completely proprietary systems like game consoles.

Differentiated pricing is another common objective, where products or services are priced based on their value to the customer rather than their cost. This is familiar in air travel, where prices vary widely between coach, business, and first class. Economists have long recognized the importance of value-based pricing, as noted by Jules Dupuit in 1849.
