Abstract
According to one common view, information secu-
rity comes down to technical measures. Given better
access control policy models, formal proofs of crypto-
graphic protocols, approved ﬁrewalls, better ways of de-
tecting intrusions and malicious code, and better tools
for system evaluation and assurance, the problems can
be solved.
In this note, I put forward a contrary view: infor-
mation insecurity is at least as much due to perverse
incentives. Many of the problems can be explained
more clearly and convincingly using the language of
microeconomics: network externalities, asymmetric
information, moral hazard, adverse selection, liability
dumping and the tragedy of the commons.
1 Introduction
In a survey of fraud against autoteller machines [4],
it was found that patterns of fraud depended on who
was liable for them. In the USA, if a customer dis-
puted a transaction, the onus was on the bank to prove
that the customer was mistaken or lying; this gave US
banks a motive to protect their systems properly. But
in Britain, Norway and the Netherlands, the burden
of proof lay on the customer: the bank was right un-
less the customer could prove it wrong. Since this
was almost impossible, the banks in these countries
became careless. Eventually, epidemics of fraud de-
molished their complacency. US banks, meanwhile,
suﬀered much less fraud; although they actually spent
less money on security than their European counter-
parts, they spent it more eﬀectively [4].
There are many other examples. Medical payment
systems that are paid for by insurers rather then by
hospitals fail to protect patient privacy whenever this
conﬂicts with the insurer’s wish to collect information
about its clients. Digital signature laws transfer the
risk of forged signatures from the bank that relies on
the signature (and that built the system) to the person
alleged to have made the signature. Common Criteria
evaluations are not made by the relying party, as Or-
ange Book evaluations were, but by a commercial fa-
cility paid by the vendor. In general, where the party
who is in a position to protect a system is not the
party who would suﬀer the results of security failure,
then problems may be expected.
A diﬀerent kind of incentive failure surfaced in early
2000, with distributed denial of service attacks against
a number of high-proﬁle web sites. These exploit a
number of subverted machines to launch a large coor-
dinated packet ﬂood at a target. Since many of them
ﬂood the victim at the same time, the traﬃc is more
than the target can cope with, and because it comes
from many diﬀerent sources, it can be very diﬃcult to
stop [7]. Varian pointed out that this was also a case of
incentive failure [20]. While individual computer users
might be happy to spend $100 on anti-virus software
to protect themselves against attack, they are unlikely
to spend even $1 on software to prevent their machines
being used to attack Amazon or Microsoft.
This is an example of what economists refer to as
the ‘Tragedy of the Commons’ [15]. If a hundred peas-
ants graze their sheep on the village common, then
whenever another sheep is added its owner gets almost
the full beneﬁt – while the other ninety-nine suﬀer only
a small decline in the quality of the grazing. So they
aren’t motivated to object, but rather to add another
sheep of their own and get as much of the grazing as
they can. The result is a dustbowl; and the solution
is regulatory rather than technical. A typical tenth-
century Saxon village had community mechanisms to
deal with this problem; the world of computer secu-
rity still doesn’t. Varian’s proposal is that the costs
of distributed denial-of-service attacks should fall on
the operators of the networks from which the ﬂood-

ing traﬃc originates; they can then exert pressure on
their users to install suitable defensive software, or,
for that matter, supply it themselves as part of the
subscription package.
These observations prompted us to look for other
ways in which economics and computer security inter-
act.
2 Network Externalities
Economists have devoted much eﬀort to the study
of networks such as those operated by phone compa-
nies, airlines and credit card companies.
The more people use a typical network, the more
valuable it becomes. The more people use the phone
system – or the Internet – more people there are to
talk to and so the more useful it is to each user. This
is sometimes referred to as Metcalfe’s law, and is not
limited to communication systems. The more mer-
chants take credit cards, the more useful they are to
customers, and so the more customers will buy them;
and the more customers have them, the more mer-
chants will want to accept them. So while that net-
works can grow very slowly at ﬁrst – credit cards took
almost two decades to take oﬀ – once positive feed-
back gets established, they can grow very rapidly. The
telegraph, the telephone, the fax machine and most re-
cently the Internet have all followed this model.
As well as these physical networks, the same prin-
ciples apply to virtual networks, such as the commu-
nity of users of a mass-market software architecture.
When software developers started to believe that the
PC would outsell the Mac, they started developing
their products for the PC ﬁrst, and for the Mac only
later (if at all). This eﬀect was reinforced by the fact
that the PC was easier for developers to work with.
The growing volume of software available for the PC
but not the Mac made customers more likely to buy
a PC than a Mac, and the resulting positive feedback
squeezed the Mac out of most markets. A similar eﬀect
made Microsoft Word the dominant word processor.
A good introduction to network economics is by
Shapiro and Varian [17]. For our present purposes,
there are three particularly important features of in-
formation technology markets.
(cid:127) First, the value of a product to a user depends on
how many other users adopt it.
(cid:127) Second, technology often has high ﬁxed costs and
low marginal costs. The ﬁrst copy of a chip or
a software package may cost millions, but subse-
quent copies may cost very little to manufacture.
This isn’t unique to information markets; it’s also
seen in business sectors such as airlines and ho-
tels. In all such sectors, pure price competition
will tend to drive revenues steadily down towards
the marginal cost of production (which in the case
of information is zero). So businesses need ways
of selling on value rather than on cost.
(cid:127) Third, there are often large costs to users from
switching technologies, which leads to lock-in.
Such markets may remain very proﬁtable, even
where (incompatible) competitors are very cheap
to produce.
In fact, one of the main results of
network economic theory is that the net present
value of the customer base should equal the total
costs of their switching their business to a com-
petitor [19].
All three of these eﬀects tend to lead to ”winner
take all” market structures with dominant ﬁrms. So
it is extremely important to get into markets quickly.
Once in, a vendor will try to appeal to complementary
suppliers, as with the software vendors whose band-
wagon eﬀect carried Microsoft to victory over Apple.
In fact, successful networks tend to appeal to comple-
mentary suppliers even more than to users: the po-
tential creators of “killer apps” need to be courted.
Once the customers have a substantial investment in
complementary assets, they will be locked in. (There
are a number of complexities and controversies; see for
example [14]. But the above simpliﬁed discussion will
take us far enough for now.)
These network eﬀects have signiﬁcant consequences
for the security engineer, and consequences that are of-
ten misunderstood or misattributed. Consultants of-
ten explain that the reason a design broke for which
they were responsible was that the circumstances were
impossible:
‘the client didn’t want a secure system,
but just the most security I could ﬁt on his product
in one week on a budget of $10,000’. It is important
to realize that this is not just management stupid-
ity. The huge ﬁrst-mover advantages that can arise
in economic systems with strong positive feedback are
the origin of the so-called “Microsoft philosophy” of
‘we’ll ship it on Tuesday and get it right by version
3’. Although sometimes attributed by cynics to a per-
sonal moral failing on the part of Bill Gates, this is
perfectly rational behaviour in many markets where
network economics apply.
Another common complaint is that software plat-
forms are shipped with little or no security support, as
with Windows 95/98; and even where access control
mechanisms are supplied, as with Windows NT, they

are easy for application developers to bypass. In fact,
the access controls in Windows NT are often irrele-
vant, as most applications either run with adminis-
trator privilege (or, equivalently, require dangerously
powerful operating system services to be enabled).
This is also explained simply from the viewpoint of
network economics: mandatory security would sub-
tract value, as it would make life more diﬃcult for the
application developers. Indeed, Odlyzko observes that
much of the lack of user-friendliness of both Microsoft
software and the Internet is due to the fact that both
Microsoft and the Internet achieved success by appeal-
ing to developers. The support costs that Microsoft
dumps on users – and in fact even the cost of the time
wasted waiting for PCs to boot up and shut down –
greatly exceed its turnover [16].
Network owners and builders will also appeal to the
developers of the next generation of applications by
arranging for the bulk of the support costs to fall on
users rather than developers, even if this makes eﬀec-
tive security administration impractical. One reason
for the current appeal of public key cryptography may
be that it can simplify development – even at the cost
of placing an unreasonable administrative burden on
users who are neither able nor willing to undertake
it [9]. The technical way to try to ﬁx this problem is
to make security administration more ‘user-friendly’ or
‘plug-and-play’; many attempts in this direction have
met with mixed success. The more subtle approach
is to try to construct an authentication system whose
operators beneﬁt from network eﬀects; this is what
Microsoft Passport does, and we’ll discuss it further
below.
In passing, it is worth mentioning that (thanks to
distributed denial of service attacks) the economic as-
pects of security failure are starting to get noticed by
government. A recent EU proposal recommends ac-
tion by governments in response to market imperfec-
tions, where market prices do not accurately reﬂect
the costs and beneﬁts of improvemed network secu-
rity [11]. However, this is only the beginning of the
story.
3 Competitive applications and corpo-
rate warfare
Network economics has many other eﬀects on secu-
rity engineering. Rather than using a standard, well
analyzed and tested architecture, companies often go
for a proprietary obscure one – to increase customer
lock-in and increase the investment that competitors
have to make to create compatible products. Where
possible, they will use patented algorithms (even if
these are not much good) as a means of imposing li-
censing conditions on manufacturers. For example,
the DVD Content Scrambling System was used as a
means of insisting that manufacturers of compatible
equipment signed up to a whole list of copyright pro-
tection measures [5]. This may have come under severe
pressure, as it could prevent the Linux operating sys-
tem from running on next-generation PCs; but eﬀorts
to foist non-open standards continue in many appli-
cations from SDMI and CPRM to completely propri-
etary systems such as games consoles.
A very common objective is diﬀerentiated pricing.
This is usually critical to ﬁrms that price a product or
service not to its cost but to its value to the customer.
This is familiar from the world of air travel: you can
spend $200 to ﬂy the Atlantic in coach class, $2000 in
business class or $5000 in ﬁrst. Some commentators
are surprised by the size of this gap; yet a French
economist, Jules Dupuit, had already written in 1849:
