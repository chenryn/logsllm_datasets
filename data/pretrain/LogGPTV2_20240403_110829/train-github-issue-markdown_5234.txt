  * [x ] I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Current Behavior
I just upgraded from verstion 1.0.0-beta.3 to 1.0.0-beta.8 and now I'm getting
**"Module not found: can't resolve jss"** error when running `npm start`. I
can confirm that I have jss and react-jss installed.
    ./~/react-jss/lib/jss.js
    Module not found: Can't resolve 'jss' in '/...project_path.../node_modules/react-jss/lib'
