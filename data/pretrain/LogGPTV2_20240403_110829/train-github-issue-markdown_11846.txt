### Expected Behavior
When I open a dialog box like Save, SaveAs or Open, I expect it to be scaled
according to the DPI setting of the monitor the dialog box was opened on.
### Actual Behavior
I have two monitors, primary display: 3840 x 2160 @ 225% scaling and a
secondary display 2560x1440 @ 100% scaling. When I use my Electron app (VSCode
in this case), the main window of the application is scaled to the right size
(and displayed crisp and clear). The dialog boxes are scaled correctly on the
225% scaled monitor, but on the 100% scaled monitor, the dialog boxes are
rendered way too big. As if they were drawn with the 225% scale which applies
to the other monitor. The same goes for the context menu of the title bar, it
is drawn too big on the 100% monitor.
### To Reproduce
Have your primary display set to 225% scaling, and a secondary display to
100%. Open an Electron app (VSCode, MSTeams), and right-click the title of the
window. The context menu will be drawn in the scale of the primary display,
whether its parent is on the primary or on the secondary display.
