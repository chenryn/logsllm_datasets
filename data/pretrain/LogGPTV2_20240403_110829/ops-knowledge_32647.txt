User: Please design a load balancing solution to deal with high concurrent access requests
Assistant: The following is a simple load balancing solution: 1. Use an Nginx reverse proxy to achieve load balancing. Nginx can set different load balancing algorithms through configuration files, such as round robin, weighted round robin, least connection, etc. 2. Use multiple servers to host applications, and each server runs the same application, and you can use automatic expansion or manual increase of servers to deal with high concurrent traffic. 3. Ensure the consistency and availability of data, and realize data synchronization between multiple servers by using technologies such as distributed cache or database replication. 4. Use monitoring tools to monitor server status and traffic conditions. For example, use monitoring tools such as Zabbix, Nagios, or OpenNMS to monitor the status of the server's CPU, memory, disk, and network, as well as the access volume of applications. 5. Use CDN to speed up access to static resources, such as images, CSS and JavaScript files. CDN can help reduce the load on the server and improve the access speed and stability of the website. 6. Set up the failover function of the load balancer to ensure that when the load balancer fails or the application server fails, it can quickly switch to other available servers.
