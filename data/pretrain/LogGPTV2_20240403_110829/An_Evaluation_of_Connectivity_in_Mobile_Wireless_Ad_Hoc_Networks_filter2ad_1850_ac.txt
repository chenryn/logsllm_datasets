Combining  the  result  stated  in  Theorem  4  with  the 
bound  of  Theorem  3,  we  conclude  this  section  with  the 
following theorem. 
Theorem 5. Suppose n nodes are placed in [0,l] according 
to  the  uniform  distribution,  and  assume  1<<r<<l.  The 
communication  graph  is  a.a.s.  connected  if  and  only  if 
rn∈Ω(l log l). 
The result stated in Theorem 5, for random distribution 
of  nodes,  should  be  compared  to  the  transmitting  ranges 
necessary  with  worst-case  and  best-case  placements.    To 
illustrate this, consider the case where the number of nodes 
is  linear  with  the  length  of  the  line, l.  In  the  worst-case, 
nodes  are  clustered  at  either  end  of  the  line  and  the 
transmitting  range  must  be  Ω(l)  for  the  network  to  be 
connected.  In the best-case placement, nodes are equally 
spaced at intervals of l/n, which in this case is a constant.  
Hence,  a  constant  transmitting  range  is  sufficient  in  the 
best case. Theorem 5’s result yields a transmitting range of 
Ω(log  l)  with  random  placement.  Thus,  there  is  a 
substantial reduction in transmitting range from the worst-
case but also a significant increase compared to the best-
case. 
4  Evaluation of MTR for mobile networks 
In this section, we consider the mobile version of MTR, 
which can be formulated as follows: 
MINIMUM TRANSMITTING RANGE MOBILE (MTRM):  
Suppose  n  nodes  are  placed  in  [0,l]d,  and  assume  that 
nodes  are  allowed  to  move  during  a  time  interval  [0,T]. 
What  is  the  minimum  value  of  r  such  that  the  resulting 
communication graph is connected during some fraction, f, 
of the interval? 
is  used 
for  safety-critical  or 
A formal analysis of MTRM is much more complicated 
than that of MTR and is beyond the scope of this paper. In 
this  section,  we  study  MTRM  by  means  of  extensive 
simulations. The goal is to study the relationship between 
the value of r ensuring connected graphs in the stationary 
case (denoted rstationary) and the values of the transmitting 
range  ensuring connected  graphs during some  fraction of 
the  operational  time.  In  this  paper,  we  focus  on  the 
transmitting ranges needed to ensure connectedness during 
100%, 90% and 10% of the simulation time (denoted r100, 
r90  and  r10,  respectively).  These  values  are  chosen  as 
indicative  of  three  different  dependability  scenarios  that 
the  ad  hoc  network  must  satisfy.  In  the  first  case,  the 
network 
life-critical 
applications (e.g., systems to detect physical intrusions in a 
home or business), and network connectedness during the 
entire  operational  time  is  a  vital  requirement.  In  this 
scenario, the potentially high price (expressed in terms of 
increased  energy  consumption)  to  be  paid  to  keep  the 
network  always  connected  is  a  secondary  issue.  In  the 
second  case,  temporary  network  disconnections  can  be 
tolerated,  especially  if  this  is  counterbalanced  by  a 
significant  decrease  of  the  energy  consumption  with 
respect  to  the  case  of  continuous  connectedness.  This 
scenario  is  plausible  in  many  applications  of  wireless  ad 
hoc networks, e.g. when the network is used to connect a 
squad of workers in an oil platform. In the latter case, the 
network  stays  disconnected  most  of 
time,  but 
temporary  connection  periods  can  be  used  to  exchange 
data  among  nodes.  This  could  be  the  case  of  wireless 
sensor  networks  [8]  used  for  environmental  monitoring 
[13],  where  environmental  data 
temperature, 
pressure,  air  pollution  levels)  are  gathered  by  sensors, 
which  periodically  exchange  these  data  with  the  other 
nodes  in  order  to  build  a  global  view  of  the  monitored

4.1   Simulation models 
To generate the results of this section, we extended the 
simulator  used  in  [1,11]  for  the  stationary  case  by 
implementing 
two  mobility  models.  The  simulator 
distributes  n  nodes  in  [0,l]d  according  to  the  uniform 
distribution,  then  generates  the  communication  graph 
assuming that all nodes have the same transmitting range r. 
Parameters r, n, l and d are given as input to the simulator, 
along with the number of iterations to run and the number, 
#steps,  of  mobility  steps  for  each  iteration.  Setting 
#steps=1 corresponds to the stationary case. The simulator 
returns the percentage of connected graphs generated, the 
average size of the largest connected component (averaged 
over  the  runs  that  yield  a  disconnected  graph)  and  the 
minimum size of the largest connected component. All of 
these  parameters  are  reported  with  reference  both  to  a 
single iteration (in this case, the averages are over all the 
mobility steps) and to all the iterations. In all simulations 
reported herein, we set d=2, as the two-dimensional setting 
is an appropriate model for many applications of wireless 
ad hoc networks.  
Two mobility models have been implemented. The first 
model is the classical random waypoint model [2], and is 
used to model intentional movement: every node chooses 
uniformly  at  random  a  destination  in  [0,l]d,  and  moves 
toward  it  with  a  velocity  chosen  uniformly  at  random  in 
the interval [vmin,vmax]. When it reaches the destination, it 
remains  stationary  for  a  predefined  pause  time  tpause, and 
then it starts moving again according to the same rule. In 
the simulator, tpause is expressed as the number of mobility 
steps for which the node must remain stationary. We have 
also included a further parameter in the model, namely the 
probability pstationary that a node remains stationary during 
the entire simulation time. Hence, only (1-pstationary)n nodes 
(on  the  average)  will  move.  Introducing  pstationary  in  the 
model accounts for those situations in which some nodes 
are not able to move. For example, this could be the case 
when sensors are spread from a moving vehicle, and some 
of them remain entangled, say, in a bush or tree. This can 
also model a situation where two types of nodes are used, 
one type that is stationary and another type that is mobile. 
The  second  mobility  model  resembles  a  drunkard-like 
(i.e.,  non-intentional)  motion.  Mobility  is  modeled  using 
parameters  pstationary,  ppause  and  m.  Parameter  pstationary  is 
defined as above. Parameter ppause is the probability that a 
node  remains  stationary  at  a  given  step.  This  parameter 
accounts  for  heterogeneous  mobility  patterns,  in  which 
nodes may move at different times. Intuitively, the higher 
is  the  value  of  ppause,  the  more  heterogeneous  is  the 
mobility pattern. However, values of ppause close to 1 result 
in an almost stationary network. If a node is moving at step 
i, its position in step i+1 is chosen uniformly at random in 
the disk of radius m centered at the current node location. 
Parameter m models, to a certain extent, the velocity of the 
nodes:  the  larger  m  is,  the  more  likely  it  is  that  a  node 
moves far away from its position in the previous step.  
4.2  Simulation results for increasing system size 
The first set of simulations was aimed at investigating 
the value of the ratio of r100 (respectively, of r90 and r10) to 
rstationary for values of l ranging from 256 to 16384. We also 
considered  the  largest  value  r0  of  the  transmitting  range 
that yields no connected graphs. In both mobility models, n 
l . The value of rstationary is obtained from the 
was set to 
simulation results for the stationary case reported in [1,11], 
while  those  for  r100,  r90,  r10  and  r0  are  averaged  over  50 
simulations of 10000 steps of mobility each. 
First, we considered the random waypoint model, with 
parameters set as follows: pstationary=0, vmin=0.1, vmax=0.01l, 
and  tpause=2000.  This  setting  models a  moderate mobility 
scenario,  in  which  all  the  nodes  are  moving,  but  their 
velocity is rather low. The effect of different choices of the 
mobility  parameters  on  the  values  of  r100,  r90  and  r10  is 
studied in the next sub-section. The values of the ratios are 
reported  in  Figure  2.  Figure  3  reports  the  same  graphic 
obtained  for  the  drunkard  model,  with  pstationary=0.1, 
ppause=0.3  and  m=0.01l.  This  is  also  a  moderate  mobility 
scenario,  but  more  heterogeneous  than  the  other:  a small 
percentage  of  the  nodes  remain  stationary,  and  mobile 
nodes  are  stationary  for  30%  of  the  simulation  time  (on 
average). 
The  graphics  show  the same qualitative behavior: as l 
increases, the ratio of the different transmitting ranges for 
mobility to rstationary tends to increase, and this increasing 
behavior is more pronounced for the case of r100. However, 
even  when  the  system  is  large,  a  modest  increase  to 
rstationary  (about  21%  in  the  random  waypoint  and  about 
25%  in  the  drunkard  model)  is  sufficient  to  ensure 
connectedness  during 
time. 
Comparing the results for the two mobility models, we can 
see somewhat higher values of the ratios for the drunkard 
model,  especially  for  the  case  of  r100.  This  seems  to 
indicate that more homogeneous mobility patterns help in 
maintaining connectedness.  However, it is surprising that 
the results for the two mobility models are so similar. This 
indicates  that  it  is  more  the  existence  of  mobility  rather 
than  the  precise  details  of  how  nodes  move  that  is 
significant,  at  least  as  far  as  network  connectedness  is 
concerned. 
the  entire 
simulation 
It should also be observed that r90 is far smaller than r100 
in  both  mobility  models, 
(about  35-40%  smaller)

independently  of  the  system  size.  Hence,  substantial 
energy  savings  can  be  achieved  under  both  models  if 
temporary  disconnections  can  be  tolerated.  When  the 
requirement  for  connectedness  is  only  10%  of  the 
operational time, the decrease in the transmitting range is 
about 55-60%, enabling further energy savings. However, 
if  r  is  reduced  to  about  25%  to  40%  of  rstationary,  the 
network  becomes  disconnected  during 
the  entire 
simulation time. 
The  average  size  of  the  largest  connected  component 
when the transmitting range is set to r90, r10 and r0 was also 
investigated. Simulation results are displayed in Figures 4 
and  5.  Once  again,  the  graphics  show  very  similar 
behaviors:  the  ratio  of  the  average  size  of  the  largest 
connected component to n increases as l increases. When 
the  transmitting  range  is  set  to  r90  and  l  is  sufficiently 
large,  this  ratio  is  very  close  to  1  (about  0.98  in  both 
mobility models). This means that during the short time in 
which the network  is disconnected, a vast majority  of its 
nodes forms a large connected component. Hence, on the 
average  disconnection  is  caused  by  only  a  few  isolated 
nodes.  This  fact  is  confirmed  by  the  plots  for  r10:  even 
when the network is disconnected most of the time, a large
