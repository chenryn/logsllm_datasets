Certainly! Here's a more structured and professional version of the log entry:

```
Log ID: 2568643
Node: node-70
Component: action
State: start
Timestamp: 1074119817
Flag: 1
Command: clusterAddMember (command 1902)
```

This format clearly separates each piece of information, making it easier to read and understand.
