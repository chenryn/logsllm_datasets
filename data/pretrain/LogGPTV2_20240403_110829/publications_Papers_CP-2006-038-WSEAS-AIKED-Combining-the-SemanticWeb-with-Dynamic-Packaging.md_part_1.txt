Abstract: - With the growth of demand for customized tourism itineraries, agencies seek technology that provides
their customers the flexibility to put together unique dynamic packages from a range of alternatives, without
having to be aware of the intricacy of contract rules and pricing issues. In recent years, one important type of
e-tourism applications that has surfaced to support these requirements is dynamic packaging systems. Our
objective is to develop a platform to enable the development of dynamic packaging systems using the latest
semantic Web technologies, since it has been recognize that the tourism industry is a perfect application area for
the semantic Web since information dissemination and exchange are the key backbones of the travel industry.
Key-Words: - Semantic Web, Ontologies, Semantic Information Integration, Dynamic Packaging, Travel
