User: Create a new user on the Linux system and authorize access to the specified directory.
Assistant: 1. Create a new user: Use the adduser command to add a new user and set the login password: ``` sudo adduser username ``` 2. Authorize access to the specified directory: In the Linux system, each file and directory has its own user and owner authority. Therefore, we need to change the owner and permissions of the specified directory to authorize the new user. Assuming that the directory we want to authorize access to is /data/test, we need to execute the following command: ``` sudo chown -R username:username /data/test ``` Among them, the -R parameter indicates recursive processing of the directory and its subdirectories and files , and username:username indicates that the directory ownership belongs to the new user. Then, change the directory permission to 755 (rwxr-xr-x), so that the user has read, write and execute permissions: ``` sudo chmod -R 755 /data/test ``` In this way, the new user can access and operate The directory is up.
