User: Currently I have a website on the Google App Engine written in Google's webapp framework. What I want to know is what are the benefits of converting my app to run with django? And what are the downsides? Also how did you guys code your GAE apps? Did you use webapp or django? Or did you go an entirely different route and use the Java api?
Thanks
Assistant: I prefer webapp. It scales better according to Google and seems to better integrated with the App Engine infrastructure. Plus it's more lightweight.
