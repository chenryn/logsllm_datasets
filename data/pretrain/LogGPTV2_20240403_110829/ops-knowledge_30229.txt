User: How to design a scalable architecture for an Internet enterprise website system with high concurrency and large data volume? Please provide a design and explain how to scale horizontally and vertically.
Assistant: Design scheme: In the Internet enterprise website system with high concurrency and large data volume, the following schemes can be adopted: 1. Adopt a distributed architecture and split the system into multiple modules to improve the maintainability and scalability of the system. 2. Use load balancing technology to distribute requests to different servers to avoid single point of failure and system overload. 3. Use caching technology to reduce the frequency of database reading and improve system concurrency. 4. The database adopts master-slave replication or sub-database sub-table technology to improve database read and write capabilities and load balancing. 5. Improve system stability and fault tolerance, adopt disaster recovery backup technology and data synchronization technology. 6. Adopt asynchronous message queue technology to separate business logic from real-time stream processing and improve system response speed. Achieve horizontal expansion: Horizontal expansion is to expand the performance of the entire system by increasing the number of servers. To achieve horizontal expansion, the following points need to be considered: 1. The database adopts distributed database technology to increase the number of database nodes. 2. Use distributed cache technology to increase the number of cache nodes. 3. A distributed task scheduling system is used to distribute tasks to multiple nodes for execution. 4. Distribute requests to multiple servers through load balancing technology to avoid single point of failure and system overload. Realize vertical expansion: Vertical expansion is to expand the performance of the entire system by adding hardware facilities such as the server's CPU, memory, and hard disk. To achieve vertical expansion, the following points need to be considered: 1. Use cluster technology to form a cluster of multiple servers to jointly process user requests. 2. Use virtualization technology to split a physical server into multiple virtual servers to improve server utilization efficiency. 3. Use container technology to package applications into containers, and run multiple containers on one server at the same time to improve server usage efficiency. 4. Use distributed storage technology to store data on different nodes to improve data read and write capabilities. Summary: When designing a scalable architecture, you need to consider many factors, including distributed architecture, load balancing, caching technology, disaster recovery backup technology, etc. It is necessary to choose an appropriate expansion method based on actual business needs, such as horizontal expansion and vertical expansion. At the same time, adequate testing and optimization are required to ensure the stability and performance of the system.
