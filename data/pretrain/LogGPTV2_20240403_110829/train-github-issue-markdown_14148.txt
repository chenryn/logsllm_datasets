### Issue Details
  * **Electron Version:**
    * 8.0.2
  * **Operating System:**
    * Ubuntu 18.04/19.10 (kernel 4.15 and 5.3)
  * **Last Known Working Electron version:**
    * Electron 7
### Expected Behavior
Not to crash on start up.
### Actual Behavior
Several (but not all) users are reporting that our Electron app segfaults
immediately on startup. Please see keybase/client#23018 (comment), which
includes a link to a coredump, though I couldn't find anything super useful in
there myself.
### To Reproduce
Unfortunately we can't reproduce this ourselves on Ubuntu 18.04, but several
users are reporting this issue.
### Screenshots
### Additional Information
I found #22215, which could be relevant but I didn't see much of a resolution
or diagnosis there, plus the issue we have is that it crashes immediately on
startup, not after a while. In addition, while there are some comments there
indicating that linux kernel 5.5 may be the culprit, our users are reporting
issues on kernel 4.15 and 5.3.
Any help debugging this greatly appreciated. Thanks!
