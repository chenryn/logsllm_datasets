achieve a range between 2 and 8 m, (with the key fob in the
person’s pocket which corresponds to the typical key place-
ment). We note that the distance achieved between the relay
antenna and the key depends on the strength of the collected
signal from the car side and the sensitivity of the key. On
the car side, the signal strength depends on the sensitivity
of our antenna and its placement as close as possible to the
car’s antennas. The differences in the distances between the
vehicles for the open or start actions are likely to depend on
the signal level at which the key accepts the messages 9. Fi-
nally, the values reported here show that the attack is practi-
cal as the key can be activated up to 8 meters away from the
antenna and the distance from the key to the car can be ex-
tended up to 60 meters. It is likely that using more powerful
ampliﬁers would only further increase these distances.
4.2 Maximum Acceptable Delay
In order to know the maximum theoretical distance of
a physical layer relay we computed for each tested PKES
system the maximum acceptable delay by relaying LF mes-
sages with a variable delay. For this purpose we used a
USRP1 from Ettus Research [5] with LFRX and LFTX
boards. This allowed us to receive and send messages at
135 KHz. However, we found that the minimal processing
delay achievable by this software radio platform was be-
tween 10 and 20 ms. This proved to be too slow on all but
one PKES we tested.
The delay in a software deﬁned radio device is mainly
due to buffering and sending data over the USB to (resp.
from) the computer for processing and the software pro-
cessing. To reduce this delay we modiﬁed the USRP FPGA
to bypass the RX (resp. TX) buffers and the communica-
tions with the computer. With this modiﬁcation and appro-
priate conﬁguration of the USRP the digitized signals were
directly relayed by the FPGA from the receiving path to the
transmitting path. We experimentally measured the result-
ing minimal delay to be 4 μs. To insert an additional, tun-
able, delay we added a FIFO between the RX and TX path.
Changing the depth of this FIFO, and the decimation rate,
allowed us to accurately test delays between 4 μs and 8 ms.
However, the memory on the FPGA was limited which lim-
ited the FIFO depth and the maximal delay achievable. To
achieve delays above 8 ms we had to use an unmodiﬁed
USRP with a tunable delay in software. This allowed us to
increase delay above 8 ms but with less maximum delay
precision.
Table 5 shows the measured maximum delays on the ve-
hicles on which we were able to make those tests. Large
delays allow to relay messages over large distances with a
physical-layer relay. The maximum delays were measured
to be within 35 μs to tens of ms depending on the car model.
This leads to a theoretical distance of a physical relay over-
the-air between 10 and 3000 km 10. Additionally, the mod-
els with higher tolerance to delays would allow relays at
higher levels than the physical layer, i.e. relays that demod-
9This level can be set by a conﬁguration parameter on some chips [45].

ulate the signals (e.g., LF and UHF) and transmit them e.g.,
over UDP. As explained above, the Software Deﬁned Radio
(SDR) we used in our experiments has signiﬁcant delays,
which would make such relays difﬁcult. However, recently
SDR was developed that have low delays [44]. This plat-
form would allow to achieve relays with sub micro second
delays.
4.3 Key Response Time and Spread
Other characteristics of the smart key that are relevant to
the physical-layer relay performance are the key response
time and spread. The key response time is the elapsed time
between the moment when the challenge is sent by the car
and the beginning of the response from the smart key. The
key response time spread is the difference between the min-
imum and maximum key response times that we have ob-
served. The computation of these two measures allows us
to estimate (i) how much delay could the physical-layer re-
lay attack exploit without any practical detection being pos-
sible (ii) what is the design decision behind the maximum
acceptable delays allowed by the evaluated systems. We
note that the numerical differences of these two measures
between car models are due to the hardware used as well as
the implementation of the secure protocols (e.g., message
size, type of encryption).
In order to measure the key response time and spread,
we recorded the protocol message exchanges between the
car and key at radio frequency (RF) with an oscilloscope
using high sampling rate (from 20 to 50 MS/s depending
on the PKES system). This allowed us to have a precise
estimation (within tens of nanoseconds) of the start and end
of transmitted messages. Table 5 summarizes the average
key response time with its standard deviation and the key
response time spread computed from 10 different message
exchanges during car open.
The results show large differences between different car
models. The key response standard deviations vary from 4
to 196 μs, and the maximum spread - from 11 to 436 μs.
These values show that the current implementations exhibit
large variance. That is, possible solutions that rely on mea-
surements of the average key response time in order to de-
tect the time delay introduced by our attack would be infea-
sible; even the smallest key response time spread of 11 μs
(Model 5) is already too large to be used for the detection
of our attack. We recall that our 30 meter wireless physical-
layer relay requires only approximately 120 ns in one di-
rection (Table 3).
Moreover, we also observe that higher key response
spread leads to higher acceptable delay. The manufacturers
seem to ﬁx the maximum acceptable delay at 20 to 50 times
of the measured spread (except for Model 10). The reason is
most likely to provide high reliability of the system as any
smaller delays could occasionally make car owners being
denied access to the car and/or authorization to drive.

Implications of the Relay Attack on PKES
Systems
In this section we describe different attack scenarios and
discuss the implications of relay attacks on PKES systems.
Common Scenario: Parking Lot.
In this scenario, the
attackers can install their relay setup in an underground
parking, placing one relay antenna close to the passage
point (a corridor, a payment machine, an elevator). When
the user parks and leaves his car, the Passive Keyless Entry
System will lock the car. The user then exits the parking

often provided to the owner with indicator lights or horn).
Once the car is out of user’s sight, the attackers can place
the second antenna to the door handle. The signals will now
be relayed between the passage point and the car. When the
