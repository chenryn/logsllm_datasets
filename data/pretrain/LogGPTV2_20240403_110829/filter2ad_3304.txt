Identity-Based Encryption  
From Algorithm to Enterprise Deployment 
Abstract 
Identity-Based  encryption  is  an  asymmetric  encryption  system  where  identifiers  such  as  email 
addresses, server names or phone numbers, can be used as public keys. Originally proposed by Adi 
Shamir in 1984, the first practical algorithm became available in 2001. Since then IBE has not only 
generated  huge  interest  in  academia,  it  has  seen  wide-scale  adoption  in  industry,  is  used  by 
hundreds of thousands of users and is in the process of being standardized by the IEEE.  
In this talk we will give an overview of the state of IBE, and reflect on what led to its rapid success. 
Unlike many encryption protocols, IBE is a new cryptographic paradigm that can not be built from 
existing  encryption  algorithms.  As  a  new  primitive,  IBE  directly  solves  some  of  the  existing 
problems with classic public key systems. Specifically it enables the use of short-lived public keys, 
removes the overhead of certificate management and enables keys to be centrally managed. As a 
result IBE systems require less state and are much more lightweight and scalable than traditional 
PKI systems. 
In this talk we will give an overview over the IBE algorithms and standardization activities. We 
will  describe  a  secure  email  systems  based  on  IBE,  and  by  examining  the  example  of  a  live 
enterprise deployment of IBE discuss advantages and differences to traditional PKI.
