JM: Exactly.
RT: The universe is nothing but a structure of information and energy manifesting itself
in what I think of metaphorically as “folds,” manifesting itself as various kinds of beings,
species, material forms. Does that make sense?
JM: Absolutely. I have a great deal of agreement with that. So when you’re talking about
“extraterrestrial aliens” you’re really talking about an extension of self. We lie
somewhere between those building blocks, and I think that’s what’s happening. There
may be a certain level of sophistication which once reached opens doorways of
communication of some kind. I think that’s what’s going on. I don’t think it’s like
throwing a light switch but something that of necessity you build over a long period of
time. If they threw a light switch and we were suddenly in full communication with
another race of beings and we found them to be superior, our reaction would be one of
great fear. I think it’s over a long period of time that that communication becomes
realized.
RT: Ants don’t know that dogs exist. You can’t deal with the UFO phenomena without
moving in the direction of the nature of consciousness and how communication happens.
JM: Right. People want to talk about a whole lot of different things but no one seems to
address the commonality we share with other sentient beings regarding a creator, a
beginning, morality issues, those kinds of things.
RT: They would have to be emergent realities in any complex species or civilization. 
JM: Exactly. Those are my thoughts.
RT: (Described to him a spontaneous experience in which I found myself as it were in
another place and having an encounter with an “alien being” that I experienced
communicating from a higher plane of consciousness about deeper truths which I could
only translate as all the different ways we humans talk about love but which was in fact
about principles of coherence.)
JM: We want to put boundaries around things and put issues to bed but when you’re
faced with something so new that there are no boundaries or definitions, then we have a
tendency to leap to conclusions and assign things to them that are not necessarily
accurate.
RT: We impose a pattern prematurely on the data. 
JM: One example of that is the near-death experience. The first time it happened to me, I
was engulfed by the “white light” and my first assumption was that this must be what
God is. It was a feeling of completeness, wholeness, being in the absolute home, and I
had nothing to relate it to, nothing in my experience that overwhelming and perfect, so I
assumed this must be what God is. For a long time I told people God’s a white light, you
can’t die, you can’t cease to exist as an entity, that sort of thing. But then I had a second
NDE that was slightly different. In that one I was what I called kept local, not allowed to
wander off, because I was actively seeking this white light and I was allowed to see it but
not go through it. This created a huge philosophical problem for me because the light had
edges and my definition of God did not include boundaries. So the light had to be
something other than what I had assumed. I concluded that it must have something to do
with the mortality of self and what we identify as self. Maybe my conceptualization of
what God is must be changed. I concluded as a result of that exercise that there was no
way I could define God because in my quest for an unbounded principle, I can’t put
boundaries on it, so the best I can do is see some shadow or reflection on the wall. I was
looking for what constitutes the right thing in the human condition and I find that not just
in humanity but in many of the contacts with a lot of these entities. It’s an expansion of
the conceptualization of “sentient beings.” I think there is something very dynamic and
specific about these experiences and I think they’re a teaching or learning tool for
expanding the sophistication of how we view sentient beings or the universe at large. 
RT: (Described to him the essence of my short story Species, Lost in Apple-eating Time
(included in MIND GAMES) published at anotherealm.com) 
JM: Exactly right. The conclusion I have come to is that we have sort of gone full circle.
We have realized that the pragmatic side of humankind will not give us the answer we are
looking for, because it’s insufficient, and all the things put down over the years – arts,
literature – are the other side of the coin. You could describe sentience as having both a
requirement to be spiritual and at the same time pragmatic with one foot in reality. It’s
the only way you can understand it. We’ve been flip-flopping form one side to another
for thousands of years trying to figure out that secret. We may be entering an age in
which humankind at large is realizing that we aren’t getting answers from either side.
There has to be a blend. It’s almost as if we are acknowledging that magic is possible and
that’s where the answer will be lying. 
RT: Simultaneously, not either/or.
JM: Exactly. 
RT: You have to have followed a particular path to arrive at the point where this kind of
conversation makes sense. You have to have been lucky or blessed –
JM: Yes, and to reject the need to come to conclusions. That has come out of the remote
viewing side of me, I think. In order to do remote viewing, you have to reject
conclusions, so I have pretty much disciplined or instructed myself to be able to at least
evaluate some of these things in a different light.
RT: And remain agnostic in regards to your own experience and hold it all lightly.
JM: Right. Exactly. 
RT: You watch your mind begin to form patterns, and it forms them more quickly when
anxious or afraid, and you have to step back and observe your reaction as one more
interesting input into the whole experience.
JM: Exactly.
RT: Are you still working privately with companies as a remote viewer?
JM: Oh yeah. I sure am. 
RT: How do people find out about you?
JM: Word of mouth., I still have too much work and can not get everything done.
RT: It does take a lot of energy to do this work.
JM: When you look at the hours it takes compared to what you can charge for it, it
doesn’t pay the bills. I don’t charge anything at all for pain. When someone is in pain, I
don’t charge. Police departments, attorney general offices contact me in relationship to
kidnappings, for example, and I never charge for that. I have worked extensively with
people at the FBI. It’s almost always one-on-one for specific individuals or department
heads. I develop those relationships over many years, and there is mutual trust. I never
divulge what I am doing for them, and they are never embarrassed by it.
RT: In terms of helping others understand what you do, you have to be appropriate and
confidential. How do you communicate the details that disclose possibilities to others, in
light of the mentoring we were discussing, how do you let people know something
concretely?
JM: I can give you an example. I have decided to demonstrate it in public. I have done
seventeen live remote viewings on camera in four countries. I do those live within
double-blind protocols so there is no way it can be faked. Thirteen of those seventeen
have been eminently successful and put people in a situation in which they could not
deny it. In Japan last year, for example, I did two live remote viewings on national
television. The head of the Department of Physics at the University of Tokyo is a skeptic
and he said if he could not identify the trick I used, he would resign his position at the
University of Tokyo. I not only did his double-blind target but a double-blind target live
on the show involving sending a woman off in a bullet train for three hours. Both were
judged by the audience as being near 95% accurate. The professor has been back in to
review the film – he came in three days in a row – and the only pictures are of me
sleeping in the green room. I lay down on the tatami mat and went to sleep. So he has
never been able to identify the “trick” I used. This has generated a huge amount of
conversation in Japan.
I did two live remote viewings in England. One was the brand-new MI6 Building, a
supersecret building, and that created such a row that they were not allowed to use the
material on international television, which they pointed out. As to having an impact on
peoples’ beliefs, I get calls from Norway, Stockholm, Russia, from very professional
business people who are very serious asking for remote viewing support, which I try to
do as best I can. So I am making an inroad very slowly that way.
RT: Is there any organizational support for this? A friend was speaking to Russell Targ
which is where he learned that the NSA as well as the CIA had done remote viewing –
JM: Uh-huh.
RT: Conversations like that around the edge is where we learn. Any think tank support?
JM: No, it’s people having to do it as I am doing it, and it’s really unfortunate. What
would really make the difference is when a company one day says yes, we’ve been using
remote viewing for ten years, and it’s made us a quarter of a billion dollars. That’s the
kind of thing that will change peoples’ minds. 
RT: Any clients willing to talk about the work so we could make a solid case?
JM: No. That’s the problem. For example .
RT: It’s just not mainstream enough yet.
JM: Right, and clients are very careful within their own company, what people know I do
or don’t do. I am always introduced as an information officer, head of CI or something. 
RT: Is there more acceptance within CI itself of remote viewing?
JM: Absolutely. I know of at least three countries using remote viewers for competitive
intelligence. The Russians are very much using it. The Hungarians as well I would bet. I
have met my counterparts in most of those countries. I was in Russia for three and a half
weeks last year and met my enemies, so to speak. In fact, I did a remote viewing with the
best they had and we targeted one another and did a drawing that was a mirror image
drawing which even blew them out of the box. Which is kind of funny, because their
head remote viewer and I got along very very well, I think because neither of us buy into
politics. The spirituality of it is identical. 
RT: Once you’ve gone to the places you’ve gone, it changes you. You can’t pretend you
don’t know what you know.
JM: Exactly. It’s like opening a door, it’s impossible after that to back out and shut the
door again. 
RT: Do you have enough people to talk to? I do interviews like this so I can have
conversations like this. Otherwise it gets lonely!
JM: Oh yeah, I understand exactly what you’re saying. No, probably not. I seldom ever
have a conversation like this, in fact, not without either being at great risk or finding
someone who will talk at this level.
RT: This is wonderful, and I appreciate it on all the levels. So thanks very much.
JM: You’re welcome.
