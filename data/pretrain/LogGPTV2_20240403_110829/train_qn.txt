wordexp.3
wprintf.3
    mtk
        added/updated feature test macro requirements for
        glibc; see feature_test_macros.7 for details.
changes to individual pages
---------------------------
mq_notify.2
mq_open.2
mq_timedreceive.2
mq_timedsend.2
mq_unlink.2
    mtk
        fix broken link
setpgid.2
    mtk
        fairly substantial changes and corrections, including adding
        coverage of all of the interfaces that get/set pgids.
syscalls.2
    mtk / aeb
        various rewordings; clear up some imprecisions.
lgamma.3
    mtk
        added 'signgam' to synopsis and name line.
strerror.3
    mtk
        note that the xpg version is provided since glibc 2.3.4.
        the page formerly said that the gnu-specific version
        is provided by default.  that certainly isn't true
        nowadays, since _posix_c_source is set to 200112l by
        default, so that the xsi-compliant version is supplied
        by default.
man-pages.7
    mtk
        added note pointing to feature_test_macros.7 for a description
        of how feature test macro requirements should be specified in
        manual pages.  various other minor fixes and changes.
feature_test_macros.7
    mtk
        added note about how feature test macros are specified
        in manual pages.
        many other corrections, improvements, additions, and
        details about differences across glibc versions.

-------------
fdatasync.2
    mtk
        somehow, over time, material on fdatasync(2) crept into
        fsync.2, and fdatasync also got added to the name section
        of fsync.2.  all of the material in fdatasync.2 that was
        not already in fsync.2 has now been moved there, and
        the former page has been removed.
        in place of the content there, is now a link to fsync.2.

changes to individual pages
---------------------------
makefile
    mike frysinger
        make the install target of man-pages respect the standard
        "destdir" variable as well as check the exit status of the
        install command so errors aren't ignored.
get_mempolicy.2
    lee schermerhorn
        changed the "policy" parameter to "mode" through out the
        descriptions in an attempt to promote the concept that the memory

        added requirement to link '-lnuma' to synopsis
        rewrite portions of description for clarification.
        added all errors currently returned by sys call.
        removed cautionary note that use of mpol_f_node|mpol_f_addr

        added mmap(2) to see also list.
getitimer.2

        replace discussion of timer* macros with a pointer
        to new page timeradd.3.

        rewrite portions of description for clarification.
            clarify interaction of policy with mmap()'d files and shared
            memory regions, including shm_huge regions.
            defined how "empty set of nodes" specified and what this
            means for mpol_preferred.
            mention what happens if local/target node contains no
            free memory.
            clarify semantics of multiple nodes to bind policy.
            note:  subject to change.  we'll fix the man pages when/if
                   this happens.
        added all errors currently returned by sys call.

proc.5
    mtk
        improve description of num_threads field under /proc/pid/stat.
    maxime vaudequin
        fix path error (s%proc/sys%proc/sys/kernel%) in mentions of
        /proc/sys/ostype, /proc/sys/osrelease and proc/sys/version.
    maxime vaudequin
        i noticed things to correct and to clarify in subsection
        "/proc/filesystems" of proc.5:
        - clarify filesystems listing: not only fs compiled
          into the kernel, also fs kernel modules currently loaded
        - add a reference to fs(5)
        - add an explanation for fs marked with "nodev"
        - s/mount(1)/mount(8)/, also corrected in section "see also"
        - clarify usage by mount: the current wording may lead to
          think /proc/filesystems is always used by mount when no fs
          is specified. so, usage of "may" which imho is more
          appropriate + additional explanations
          in mount(8) we can see:
               if no -t option is given, or if the auto type is
               specified, mount will try to guess the desired type.
               if mount was compiled with the blkid library, the
               guessing is done by this library. otherwise, mount
               guesses itself by probing the superblock; if that
               does not turn up anything that looks familiar,
               mount will try to read the file /etc/filesystems,
               or, if that does not exist, /proc/filesystems.
               all of the filesystem types listed there will be
               tried, except for those that are labeled "nodev"
               (e.g., devpts, proc and nfs). if /etc/filesystems
               ends in a line with a single * only, mount will
               read /proc/filesystems afterwards.
    samuel thibault
        since linux 2.6.11, /proc/stat has an eighth value for cpu
        lines: stolen time, which is the time spent in other operating
        systems when running in a virtualized environment.
arp.7
        updated bugs text referring to jiffies; refer to time.7 instead.
credentials.7
    mtk
        add words to note that file system id is linux specific.
hier.7
    maxime vaudequin
        this is some corrections for hier.7:
        - missing period for /media and /mnt
        - /mnt description is not totally correct, it is true for some
          distributions but in others /mnt is used as a temporary fs
          mount point, as it is specified by fhs:
          http://www.pathname.com/fhs/pub/fhs-2.3.html#mntmountpointforatemporarilymount
        - s/x-windows/x-window/ (3 occurrences)
        - section "see also": s/mount(1)/mount(8)/
man-pages.7

        (nptl vs linuxthreads).
socket.7
    mtk, after a note by andi kleen
        clarify that so_sndtimeo and so_rcvtimeo only have effect for
