User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to get Let's Encrypt to give challenge text for all domains at once? I'm using Let's Encrypt for my Google App Engine site, so I'm generating certificates only, and while it's working, the process for verifying multiple domains seems clunky. I presume I'm doing something wrong, maybe I'm missing an optional argument? I'm following this guide, and starting as:

sudo ./letsencrypt-auto -a manual certonly

In the GUI I enter two domains

mydomain.com www.mydomain.com

The process from there, as far as I can tell is..


GUI prompts me to agree to something
The command line shows me the challenge request and response for mydomain.com
I deploy the challenge response code to my site
I hit Enter
A challenge request is made to mydomain.com (I can see from my logs)
The GUI again prompts me to agree to something
The command line shows me the challenge request and response for www.mydomain.com
I deploy the challenge response code to my site
I hit Enter
A challenge request is made to www.mydomain.com (I can see from my logs)


Then my certificates are made, and everything works. But I had to deploy twice, at step 3 and step 8. In my case www.mydomain.com and mydomain.com are served by exactly the same request handlers, so I'd much rather be told the challenge request/response text for both domains at step 2, so I can add both request/responses to my code at once, and then deploy once. This problem (and variants of it) get worse with a greater number of domains. 

Is there a way to get LetsEncrypt to give all the challenge text at once? If not, I'll file this as a feature request, but right now I'm assuming I've just missed something. 

thanks

This is how Let's Encrypt is designed to work. Let's Encrypt certificates are SAN certificates, hence you can bundle several hostnames in a single certificate. Hostnames can belong to the same domain, or completely different domains.

Regardless their correlation, Let's Encrypt validation mechanism requires you to create an authorization (and then validate it with one of the corresponding challenges) for each single hostname in the system.

Since the process is designed to be fully automated, this is generally not an issue. However, in your case you are handling the process manually (which is the opposite direction than the one suggested by LE) hence the process can be very verbose and annoying.

Not that I know. 


  My site is hosted on google app engine, and far as I know, this is the only way to do it on GAE (based on the research I've done, and the article linked to in the first paragraph). But if there is an easier way to do it then I'd love to know! 


One possible alternative is to use the DNS based validation. The official LE client doesn't support it yet, however there are several third party clients you can use.

One of my favourite is the Go client LEGO. Lego has built-in supports for DNS providers. It means you can request a certificate via Lego, and easily use Lego to create the DNS records required for the validation process without doing it manually.

This is a good alternative in your case, because it works very well with your Google App Engine (assuming your current DNS provider supports API-based DNS record changes).
