User: I'm a newbie to SCons and also using pydev. Can someone help me with instructions on how to debug scons scripts using Eclipse and pydev? Is it even possible considering the fact that SCons is a seperate app and not an extension to python?
Assistant: On MAC to debug scons through pydev follow Lennart's answer but with one simply addition.
Using Finder (or terminal) browse to where scons is installed. You can find this with the "which" command.
e.g. which scons
-> /usr/local/bin/scons
Make a copy of the scons file and call it scons.py.
Now when you create the Debug Configuration in Eclipse use scons.py as the "Main Module".
PS: To add a scons project to Eclipse I found it easier to use a "Linked Folder" pointing at /usr/local/bin/. i.e. Because I was getting a read-only error when trying to add the directory itself.
