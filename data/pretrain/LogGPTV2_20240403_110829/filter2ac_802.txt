### Title: BlackHat Asia 2022: SideWinder Uncoils to Strike

**Abstract:**

The SideWinder threat actor, also known as RattleSnake and T-APT-04, has emerged as one of the most aggressive and persistent Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups in recent years. This group is distinguished by the high volume, frequency, and persistence of its attacks, as well as its extensive use of encrypted and obfuscated malicious components. Since April 2020, we have detected over a thousand attacks attributed to this APT actor.

SideWinder maintains a substantial infrastructure, comprising hundreds of domains and subdomains, which are used for both downloading and command and control (C2) operations. The group has been active since at least 2012, initially targeting police, military, maritime, and naval forces in Central Asian countries. In recent years, their target profile has expanded to include foreign affairs departments, scientific and defense organizations, aviation, IT industries, and legal firms. Recent domain registrations and spear-phishing documents suggest that SideWinder is broadening its geographical reach to new countries and regions.

This APT actor demonstrates a high level of sophistication, employing a variety of infection vectors and advanced attack techniques. These techniques include multiple obfuscation routines, unique encryption keys for each malicious file, multi-layered malware, memory-resident malware, and the splitting of infrastructure strings across different malware components.

In this talk, we will delve into the infection chain, toolset, and obfuscation techniques employed by the SideWinder threat actor. We will also provide an in-depth analysis of their infrastructure and its evolution over the past few years. Additionally, we will discuss the methods and techniques used to investigate high-volume attacks involving large numbers of obfuscated malware samples and multi-stage infection chains.

Finally, the talk will conclude with practical recommendations on how to leverage Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) and other security measures to protect user systems against this sophisticated APT actor.

- Overview of SideWinder's historical and current activities.
- Detailed analysis of their infection chain and toolset.
- Examination of their obfuscation and encryption techniques.
- Infrastructure analysis and evolution.
- Investigation methods for high-volume, multi-stage attacks.
- Best practices for using IoCs and other security measures to defend against SideWinder.
