title:blackhat:asia-22 SideWinder Uncoils to Strike
SideWinder threat actor also known as RattleSnake and  T-APT-04, has been one of the most aggressive threat actors in the past couple of years. Some of the main characteristics of this threat actor that make it stand out among the others, are the sheer number, high frequency and persistence of their attacks and the large collection of encrypted and obfuscated malicious components used in their operations. We have detected over a thousand attacks by this APT actor since April  2020. They also maintain a large infrastructure base with hundreds of domains and subdomains used as Download and Command and Control Servers. SideWinder has been active since at least 2012 and for several years, their main target profile included Police, Military, Maritime and the Naval forces of Central Asian countries. In recent years, they have also targeted departments of Foreign Affairs, Scientific and Defence organisations, Aviation, IT industry and Legal firms. Some of their newly registered domains and spearphishing documents indicate this threat actor is expanding the geography of its targets to other countries and regions. This threat actor has a relatively high level of sophistication using various infection vectors and advanced attack techniques. These techniques include multiple obfuscation routines, encryption with unique keys for each malicious file, multi-layer malwares, memory-resident malwares and splitting infrastructure strings into different malware components. This talk will give details of the SideWinder threat actorâ€™s infection chain, toolset, obfuscation techniques, infrastructure analysis and their evolution over the past few years. The talk will also give an overview of the techniques and methods used in the investigation of high volume attacks that utilise large numbers of obfuscated malware samples and multi-stage infection chains. The talk will conclude by touching on how to use IoCs together with other security measures to protect user systems against this APT actor.
