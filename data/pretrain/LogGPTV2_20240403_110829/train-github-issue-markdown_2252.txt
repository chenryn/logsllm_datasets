Hello,
I created a two columns forms, the first column has an input and the second, a
static field. As you can see on the screenshot below, the two values are not
aligned.

But when I set this, it is ok.
    .form-control-static {
        padding-top : 7px
    }

However, the padding can be strange when no input on the same line. So should
we solve this ?
Best regards
