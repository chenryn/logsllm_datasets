**Abstract:**

In our work, we take an interdisciplinary approach by applying mathematical techniques based on graph theory and propositional logic to solve a problem from computer science. Our primary goal is to provide a new theoretical mathematical foundation that can describe and analyze workflows.

A workflow is the formal definition of a process used to manage business processes, consisting of one or more tasks to be executed to reach a final goal. The tasks are represented as vertices, and the partial ordering of tasks is modeled using arcs, known as transitions. Workflows are typically defined using a graph structure with a single starting point and a single endpoint. Their execution can involve human participants and software applications responsible for carrying out activities. Accurate modeling is essential to ensure that workflows perform according to initial specifications. For example, it is crucial to verify if a workflow, such as sales order processing, will eventually terminate and be completed.

Workflows have been successfully deployed in various domains, including bioinformatics, healthcare, telecommunications, military, insurance, and school administration. Other areas, such as mobile computing, the Internet, application development, object technology, operating systems, and transaction management, have also benefited from the use of workflow technology.

While numerous papers in the literature investigate various formal aspects of workflows, further research is needed, particularly in the areas of modeling and analyzing workflows using graph theory. To address this gap, we model and analyze the behavior of workflows using tri-logic acyclic directed graphs. Our approach, which we call snapshot-based theory, is novel and has the advantage of capturing the different behaviors of each task in a workflow. This formalism allows us to verify an important structural property of workflows—logical termination.
