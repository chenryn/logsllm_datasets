of applicable rules, where the subject expressions contain
generic conditions only, and Alp ⊆ A be the set of appli-

subj expr(r) evaluates to true, then the access is granted
and the evaluation process ends. For instance, suppose that
the subject expression of an applicable rule r ∈ Ag is of the
form (user.Company=ACME ∧ user.Job=employee) and the
requestor is an employee. In this case, the subject expres-
sion is evaluated to true and the access is granted.
In the second phase, for each rule r ∈ Alp, the Ac-
cess Control Engine simpliﬁes subj expr(r) applying the
usual rules of propositional calculus. More precisely, sub-
ject expression subj expr(r) is ﬁrst simpliﬁed by evaluat-
ing all the generic conditions. For instance, suppose that
the subject expression of an applicable rule r ∈ Alp is
of the form (user.Citizenship=EU ∧ inarea(sim, Venice))
In this case, the residual

subject expression is (True ∧ inarea(sim,Venice)), that is,
inarea(sim,Venice). This condition, called residual condi-
tion, cannot be further simpliﬁed and the access request
cannot be immediately granted or denied. Consequently,
the Access Control Engine proceeds evaluating location-
based conditions. More precisely, for each predicate pred-
name(p1, . . . , pn), the Access Control Engine determines the
Location Service LS involved and calls function Solve(pred-
name(p1, . . . , pn),LS).8
In the third phase, all conditions’ outcomes are put to-
gether to reach the ﬁnal access control decision. There
is a slight complication here: the resolution of predicates
in the subject expression can have three possible values,
namely True, False, Undefined. The boolean expression

sidering one authorization at the time (stopping the process
when an authorization is satisﬁed).

truth tables of propositional connectives ∨, ¬, and ∧ de-

False=False, Undefined ∨ True=True. Other disjunctions
or conjunctions involving Undefined, as well as the negation
of Undefined itself, have as result Undefined.
Access is granted, if for an applicable rule, the subject
expression evaluates to True; it is denied otherwise.
Example 4. Let Alice be a user and Alice-sim her
SIM’s number. Assume now that Alice requests Read data
access to the MNC (Mobile Network Console). Let P be the
set of policies described in Table 2.
The access control proceeds as follows. First, the set of
applicable rules A is retrieved. This is the set containing
authorizations 2 and 3, both of which fall in Alp. Then, the
authorizations are simpliﬁed to retrieve residual (location-
based) conditions.
Consequently,
Suppose Alice’s active role is Admin and that Alice
is connected with a valid account.
the
generic conditions in authorization 3 evaluate to False;
making the whole authorization evaluate to False.
In
contrast, the generic conditions in authorization 2 eval-
uate to True, resulting in the residual condition to be
evaluated as: “ local density(Alice-sim,Close By,1,1) ∧ ve-
locity(Alice-sim,0,3) ∧ inarea(Alice-sim, Inf.
System
Dept.)”
For each of the predicates in the residual condition, func-
tion Solve is called. Assume function Solve to follow the
process illustrated in Example 3, producing:
• Solve(local density(Alice-sim, Close By, 1, 1), LS) =
Undefined
• Solve(inarea(Alice-sim, Inf.
= True
System Dept.), LS)
• Solve(velocity(Alice-sim, 0, 3), LS) = True
Hence, Undefined ∧ True ∧ True = Undefined and the
access is denied.
6. RELATED WORK
The diﬀusion and reliability that mobile technologies have
reached provide a means to exploit location information for
improving current access control systems in a novel way.
To this end, the deﬁnition of a LBAC model is an emerg-
ing research issue that has not been yet addressed by the
security and access control research community. The no-
tion of location-based access control is however in itself not
new. Some early mobile networking protocols already in-
corporated the notion of linking the physical position of a
terminal device and its capability of accessing network re-
sources [1]. Widespread adoption of wireless local networks
has triggered new interest in this topic. Some recent studies
focused on location-based information for monitoring users
movements on Wireless Lan [8] and 802.11 Networks [9],
while Myllymaki and Edlund [19] described a methodology
for aggregating location data from multiple sources and im-
prove this way location tracking features. Other researchers
chose a line closer to our approach by describing the archi-
tecture and operation of an access server module for LBAC
0
in local wireless networks [20, 27]. Access control to wire-
less networks complying with IEEE 802.11 family of proto-
cols is currently being standardized. However, these contri-
butions were aimed at strengthen the well-known security
weaknesses of wireless network protocol rather than deﬁn-
ing a general, protocol-independent model for LBAC. The
need for a protocol-independent location technique has been
underlined by an interesting study exploiting heterogeneous
positioning sources like GPS, Bluetooth, and WaveLAN for
designing location aware application [20]. Location-based
information and their management are also the topics of a
recent study by Varshney [27] in the area of mobile com-
merce applications. This is a related research area that has
strong connection with location systems and is a promising
source of requirements for LBAC models, for example, when
particular purchase options or taxation exemptions must be
applied to customers of a speciﬁc region or country.
Few papers, instead, consider location information as a
means for improving security. Sastry et al. [24] exploit
location-based access control in sensor networks. Zhang and
Parashar [29] proposed a location-aware extension to Role-
Based Access Control (RBAC) suitable for grid-based dis-
tributed applications. Many papers take into account time
variant information for querying database containing loca-
tion information [14, 18]. Typically, in such approaches a
user location is treated as a single point without explicitly
consider the intrinsic uncertainty of each location measure-
ment.
Other papers present some methods to track a user in
motion. These methods are based over a user habits proﬁle
and, again, consider the users as a single point. For instance,
in [23], a framework for user mobility prediction is presented.
It can predict the traveling trajectory and destination using
knowledge of user’s preferences, goals, and analyzed spatial
information without imposing any assumptions about the
availability of users’ movements history. This framework
thus incorporates the notion of combining user context and
spatial conceptual maps in the prediction process. All these
contributions, however, do not address the uncertainty in-
trinsic in location information.
Other works took a diﬀerent approach with respect to lo-
cation information as resources to protect against unautho-
rized access. For instance, in [12], a mechanism to protect
a user’s location information by means of electronic certiﬁ-
cate negotiation, delegation and trusted location-based ser-
vices is described. The same problem is addressed in [11]
by proposing a privacy-aware architecture for a global Loca-
tion Service, which should allow users to deﬁne rules that
will be evaluated to manage accesses to location informa-
tion. Mix zones is the method developed in [4] to enhance
privacy in location-based services that make use of a trusted
middleware service. Some basic concepts for the deﬁnition
of privacy policies in location-based environments are dis-
cussed in [25], while [5] presents a preliminary investigation
of the privacy issues raised by location-based services. Fi-
nally, the idea of enabling users to write their own privacy
policies to control the disclosure of their location informa-
tion is developed in [3]. Such feature will be integrated in
our LBAC model.
7. CONCLUSIONS
sulates time-dependency and uncertainty of location mea-
surements as important features of location information in
a small set of semantically uniform service level agreement
(SLA) parameters based on the notions of conﬁdence level
and temporal validity of each access request. These param-
eters are aimed at achieving a clean separation of the access
control evaluation engine from the protocol-dependent Lo-
cation Services made available by the network operators.
Using policy conditions based on these shared parameters
rather than on protocol-speciﬁc entities will ensure consis-
tent access decisions regardless of the available location tech-
nology and of the environment’s transient conditions. For-
mal deﬁnitions of a number of location-based predicates have
been provided, together with a discussion of their manage-
ment, evaluation and enforcement. Also, we proposed an ar-
chitecture to integrate our LBAC evaluation with traditional
identity-based access control. Our proposed architecture can
support a broad variety of location-based policies and a rich
set of predicates. Finally, we presented a worked-out exam-
ple of a LBAC policy applied to a relevant industrial scenario
where new security requirements can be met by exploiting
our location-based predicates. Several open issues still re-
main. A particularly interesting issue concerns the speciﬁ-
cation and enforcement of security (and privacy) constraints
on location-based information. In particular, in this paper
we have assumed that the Location Service always returns
location information. We plan to extend our approach to
the consideration of policies constraining to whom and how
location information is to be provided. Such policies can
come, for example, from user’s privacy preferences or legis-
lations.
