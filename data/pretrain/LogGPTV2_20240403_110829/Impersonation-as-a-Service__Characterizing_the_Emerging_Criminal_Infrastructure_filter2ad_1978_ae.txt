the subject. A user’s ‘virtual identity’ seems to be worth between
less than 1 USD and approximately 100 USD. This value changes
significantly depending on the wealth of the country where the
user (appears to be) located; a rule-of-thumb indication seems to be
that for a tenfold increase of the a user’s ‘expected wealth’ (approx-
imated by a country’s GDP), a profile value increases on average by
approximately 1 USD. Cybercriminals seem to particularly value
profiles with access to Cryptocurrency and Money transfer plat-
forms, whose prices are respectively 10 and 6 USD higher than
profiles with no access to platforms of these types. To put this in
perspective, these represent respectively a 150% and 90% markup
over the price of the average profile, a clear sign of the relevance
of resources of these types for cybercriminal activities. By con-
trast, access to Social and other services does not seem to be (in
comparison) highly valued by cybercriminals.
6.1 Implications for victimization
The systematization of impersonation attacks enabled by the IMPaaS
model allows attackers to select and target specific victim profiles,
and to automate the attack procedure by means of dedicated soft-
ware bundles replicating a victim’s browsing conditions on the
environment of the attacker. Differently from traditional phishing-
based attacks, IMPaaS provides an attacker with access to several
platforms on which a user is active, effectively allowing the attacker
to both mitigate security measures (e.g., by monitoring email for
authentication codes or activity notifications), as well as extending
the attack surface to different services (e.g. banking, social, etc.).
Attackers leveraging an IMPaaS platform can rely on an auto-
mated source for credentials to conduct sophisticated attacks at
scale. In addition to obtaining access to banking websites, cryptocur-
rency exchange platforms and e-commerce websites, an attacker
may compromise multiple accounts to gain control over the identity
of the victim. The capability of selecting victim characteristics be-
fore the acquisition of a profile is also a potential enabler of targeted
attacks against organizations or communities for which a victim is
an employee, or a registered member. The attacker may employ that
advantage point to facilitate lateral movement attacks, for exam-
ple targeting colleagues or family members of the victim by using
their legitimate contact details. Furthermore, the attacker could in-
tegrate additional information about a victim gathered through the
accessed platforms (part of a corporation, subscription to meeting
websites, etc.) to further escalate the attack to other victims.
6.2 Examples of (alleged) criminal operations
enabled by ImpaaS.ru
To informally investigate how attackers are weaponizing capa-
bilities enabled by IMPaaS, we collected a number of examples
provided by users of ImpaaS.ru on a Telegram channel linked to
the platform, to which we have gained access through ImpaaS.ru.
Many attacks reported there appear to focus on Money transfer
and Commerce services. For example, a user shared that they were
(allegedly) able to cash-out from a US bank using a synthetic fin-
gerprint acquired on ImpaaS.ru and with the support of a geo-
graphically accurate SOCKS5 proxy. The user further suggested
to rely on 911.re as the marketplace where to buy proxies linked
to specific ZIP codes and/or ISPs. On a similar line, a second user
reported to have managed issuing a new debit card on behalf of the
victim, with the aim of cashing it out through ATMs. Interestingly,
some ImpaaS.ru users report performing multi-stage attacks de-
ployed through the obtained user profiles and exploiting multiple
platforms. For example, an attacker describes setting filters to a
victim’s email mailboxes accessed through the victim’s user pro-
file, with the aim of hiding notifications from Amazon related to
purchases the attacker made using the victim’s Amazon account.
Overall, whereas of course none of these examples can be veri-
fied and the threats described above are not new per-se, the mix
of infrastructural support for profile acquisition, selection, and en-
forcement enabled by IMPaaS opens to the systematization of threat
scenarios such as the ones described above, on a global scale.
7 CONCLUSION
In this paper we presented the emergence of the Impersonation-as-a-
Service criminal infrastructure, which provides user impersonation
capabilities for attackers at large. IMPaaS allows attackers to bypass
risk-based authentication systems by automatically simulating the
victim’s environment on the attacker’s system. In this study we
characterise the largest currently operating IMPaaS infrastructure,
ImpaaS.ru, by performing an extensive data collection spanning
more than 260 thousand stolen user profiles collected worldwide.
ImpaaS.ru infiltration and data collection required substantial ef-
forts to collect multiple accounts, needed to fine-tune the data
collection as platform operators seemed to monitor crawling activi-
ties and blacklist related accounts. From our analysis, ImpaaS.ru
emerges as a mature, expanding infrastructure with a clear pricing
structure, suggesting a well-established criminal business model.
Impersonation-as-a-Service represents an additional component of
the cybercrime economy, providing a systematic model to monetize
stolen user credentials and profiles.
Lesson learned. Our data collection efforts provide supporting
evidence that underground platform operators are actively mon-
itoring crawling activities, and take measures to limit them. This
may prevent future research activities and significantly impact the
possibility of designing large-scale studies studying cybercriminal
online venues. Specific sampling strategies and analysis techniques
will have to be devised to further develop research in this domain.

APPENDIX
A MARKET FEATURES
Figure 10: View on the advanced search functionality.
Figure 10 and Figure 11 report screenshots from the market. Fig-
ure 10 depicts the search function of the market. Attackers can
access a fine grained research tool that enables them to search
for profiles with specific resource composition, number of avail-
able browser fingerprints, and other information. In Figure 11, an
overview of the details for each profile is provided. On the left,
from top to bottom, the name of the profile and the installation and
update dates of the profile are listed. On top, in the center, the list
of the available browsers (here only Microsoft Edge). The superim-
posed number indicates the number of fingerprints available for
that specific browser and the superimposed icon whether cookies
are available (green) or not (red). On the top-right is reported the
number of resources available (here 76). In the center, an overview
of the websites for which resources are present. On the right, de-
tails about the country, IP prefix and operating system are provided.
Finally, to the right-most, there’s the price expressed in USD and
buttons to respectively buy, reserve or add the profile to the cart.
B FURTHER DATA INSIGHTS
Table 6 shows correlation coefficients for the logistic model 𝑠𝑎𝑙𝑒 =
𝛽0 + 𝛽1𝑅𝑒𝑠𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑠 + 𝛽2𝑌𝑒𝑎𝑟 + 𝛽3𝐶𝑜𝑜𝑘𝑖𝑒𝑠 + 𝛽4𝐵𝑟𝑜𝑤𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑠 (binary re-
sponse variable). Whereas Resources, Year, and Browsers are sig-
nificant predictors, the effect is very small with the unsurprising
exception of Year, suggesting that profiles recently acquired are less
likely to be put on ‘sale’. The coefficient for 𝛽4 shows a positive,
albeit small, effect of the no. of browsers provided in a profile on
the likelihood of profile sale. As indicated by the small 𝑅2, we do
not find a clear rationale explaining this effect.
Table 7 reports correlation coefficients between Resources types
in our dataset. No high correlation is found, suggesting that no auto-
correlation problem should affect the regression analysis provided
in Section 5.2.
Table 8 reports all regression models on the expected (full) profile
price. The main insight is that model coefficients are relatively
stable as Resources are added in. When including bots on sale
in the regression (Table 9), coefficients appear relatively stable
and in line with those reported in Table 8, both in terms of trend
and magnitude. An exception is log (𝐺𝐷𝑃) in Model 5a, where the
respective coefficient is not significant and drops in value when
compared to Model 4a and Model 6a. This may suggest a correlation
between log (𝐺𝐷𝑃) and presence of Commerce resources for profiles
on sale, that is not present or weaker for profiles at full price.
