User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Is there a way to keep ClamAV updated on Debian 8? Since upgrading to Debian 8 my syslog is full of 

...freshclam[17851]: WARNING: Your ClamAV installation is OUTDATED!
...freshclam[17851]: WARNING: Local version: 0.98.7 Recommended version: 0.99
...freshclam[17851]: DON'T PANIC! Read http://www.clamav.net/support/faq


While trying not to panic, as instructed, I followed the link. Which goes to a 404! Panic! [joke. EDIT: this link is now working.]

Virus scanners need to be updated regularly, and these updates do not make it into Debian stable frequently. In days gone by we had a "volatile" repo for virus checkers etc. in Debian, then we had workarounds for Wheezy. What about Debian 8, Jessie?

Ideally I'd like to stick with apt for package management, especially as I have unattended upgrades running for security updates.

Assistant: Just to be sure... there is difference between virus definitions version and program version. Program version is always a bit behind on debian, but if you have virus updates working fine, there is no reason to panic. In fact, there's not much reason to do anything IMHO. :)
