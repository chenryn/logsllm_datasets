When editing the the settings, I have tried to chang the default starting
directory for the Ubuntu WSL Terminal profile as follows  
`"startingDirectory": "/mnt/D/Folder/SubFolder/",`  
and while it doesnt cause any issues or causes the Terminal to resort to
default configuration, it does not set the default starting directory to the
specified path.
Also it seems that most settings for the profile do literally nothing when
changing them, from color, to acrylic or scheme settings.
Note: changing the setting for power shell, cmd, of Kali-Linux does work and
change things respectively
