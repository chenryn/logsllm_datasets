Assistant: At 20:10:55, the storage.BlockManager found five blocks (rdd_2_0, rdd_2_4, rdd_2_3, rdd_2_2, and rdd_2_1) locally. The python.PythonRunner reported times for total, boot, init, and finish. The executor.Executor finished four tasks (0.0, 4.0, 2.0, and 1.0) in stage 13.0 and sent the results to the driver. The executor.CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend assigned three tasks (562, 576, and 590) to the executor.Executor in stage 14.0.
