Please se attached class ApplicationContextReaderImpl.java .  
Testcase:  
We tried to get this class `@Autowired` into a consumer of the class (The
consumer declares `@Autowired` on the interface).
Observations:
  1. If used as is - Spring finds no match (expecting 1 unique bean - finds none).
  2. If it's not defined in the spring context as a `@Component` but defined in xml - it will be found!
  3. If the inner Cache class is defined as a static class - autowiring ( 1) ) will succeed.
So this clearly has to be an autowiring bug.
