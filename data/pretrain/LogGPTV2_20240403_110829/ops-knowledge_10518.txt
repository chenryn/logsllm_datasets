I am attempting to read the output of `pexpect.send(cmd)`, but I am encountering a specific issue. I am sending multiple commands in sequence and need to read or expect the output only after a certain set of commands. The condition is that only the output of the last command should be considered. However, `expect` matches from the point where it last read, which causes problems.

I have tried several methods:
1. Matching for an EOF before sending the command whose output I need, but this terminates the child process.
2. Reading until a timeout and then sending the command, but the timeout itself causes the child process to terminate.
3. Reading from the end or the last line of the output, but there doesn't seem to be a reliable way to do this.
4. Considering reading a fixed number of bytes to a file or string and then manipulating the output to get the information I need, but the number of bytes is not consistent.

Could anyone help me resolve this issue?

### Possible Solutions

There are three potential ways to handle this problem, although none of them involve flushing the buffer:

1. **Matching Each `send` with `expect`:**
   - In Pexpect, every `send` call should be matched with a corresponding `expect` call. This ensures that the file pointer has moved ahead of the previous `send`.
   
2. **Using a Unique Expect Pattern:**
   - If there is a series of `send` calls before a single `expect`, you need to provide a way to move the file pointer to the location of the last `send`. This can be done by adding an extra `send` whose `expect` output is unique. The uniqueness should be such that none of the `send` commands in the series produce that output.

3. **Using a Log File:**
   - Set `logfile_read` to a file. All the output will be logged to this file. Before the `send` for which the `expect` is used, get the position of the file pointer. After the `send`, get the new position of the file pointer. Search for the expected pattern in the file between the first and second pointers.

The first method is the ideal approach, as it ensures that each `send` is properly matched with an `expect` call, maintaining the correct file pointer position.
