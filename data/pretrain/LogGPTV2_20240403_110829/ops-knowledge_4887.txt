Certainly! Here's a more polished and professional version of your text:

I have a daemon that utilizes a connection pool for handling connections to `handlerSocket`. The daemon needs to support two types of clients, each with its own distinct protocol. My goal is to set up two listeners, each handling one of the protocols, while sharing the same connection pool between them.

In Twisted, this can be achieved relatively easily, but I'm struggling to find a way to accomplish this in Gevent. 

Thank you for any assistance!

**Response:**

I believe the main challenge will arise from the `StreamServer`'s `stop()` method. When you call `stop()`, it terminates the connection pool, which would result in all connections being dropped, regardless of which listener initiated the stop. If this behavior is acceptable, you can simply pass the same `Pool` object to both `StreamServers` and run each server in a separate greenlet.
