that you use, you must allow pop-ups in order for the tool to work. You can also use any of the search operators 
discussed previously within this tool, including quotation marks. I present a similar search tool at the end of 
most chapters which summarizes and simplifies the query’ processes for the techniques explained. I encourage 
you to become familiar with each of these. Once proficient, you can query’ target data across all options within 
a few minutes. This saves me several hours every week.

August 3rd, 2019, 12:38 pm ET: Facebook began blocking my new web server.
Official Facebook Options
2022: Over the past year, many search methods have disappeared, reappeared, and disappeared again. You have 
been warned that some of the techniques here may no longer work by the time you read this.

June 17lh, 2019: Various researchers developed online search tools and browser extensions which brought back 
most of the Facebook Graph functionality. Hundreds of OSINT researchers flocked to these and we restored 
our missing techniques.
August 1st, 2019: On this date, all browser-based extensions which leveraged the Facebook Graph stopped 
working. Facebook implemented new encryption which terminated all functionality.
September 8,h, 2019: On this date, we saw methods such as using the Facebook Messenger application to seard 
telephone numbers disappear, as well as most email search options. This appeared deliberate, and more evidence 
of Facebook’s desire to lock down the platform.
August 2nd, 2019: The Facebook username to user ID conversion tool on my website stopped working. It 
appeared that my web server was being blocked by Facebook. I switched the user ID conversion tool to a new 
web server, and all appeared to be working again.
I hesitate writing anything within this chapter. It seems that most valuable Facebook search techniques 
disappeared in 2019. There are still many methods we can apply, but the future outlook for targeted queries is 
dim. I worry this chapter will become outdated before anything else, but there are some stable searches which 
should have longevity. Before we dive in, let's take a look at the recent Facebook search timeline.
2020: Facebook drastically changed their layout, removed the wildcard (*) search operator, blocked some of the 
"base64" methods (explained in a moment), and continued to aggressively monitor the OSINT community's 
response to their actions.
Facebook's redesign in 2020 presented many new search options which can benefit online investigators. Once 
logged in, a simple search field will be present at the top of any Facebook page. This is a generic starting point. 
1 encourage you to think of Facebook's current search landscape in two parts. The KEYWORD search is any 
generic term, name, location, or entity of interest. The FILTER search is the options which eliminate unwanted 
results. Let's start with a demonstration where we are looking for a profile of a person.
Fortunately, many people still share intimate details of their lives within social networks such as Facebook. 
Information that was once held privately within a small group of friends or family is now broadcasted to the 
world via public profiles. This chapter should identify new techniques which can be applied to any Facebook 
target. It will explain numerous ways to obtain user information which is public data, even if not visible within 
their official profile.
June 6‘h, 2019: This was the big date which began the decline of the Facebook graph. Previous profile queries 
all failed, and everything seemed doomed. Our ability to view "hidden" content via URL modifications was gone 
and we all scrambled for new techniques.

This indicates his Facebook username is "zuck". We can apply this to the following URLs, each which connect 
directly to the associated public information page. These direct URLs will be beneficial to our Facebook tool 
presented at the end of the chapter.
Figure 10.01 displays my keyword search for "Tom Johnson" who lives in Chicago, Illinois, attended Vashon 
High School, and currently works at Foot Locker. This located only one result, as this was a ven' targeted query. 
The filters helped me get from thousands of targets to only one. However, this is not as easy as it sounds. There 
are multiple Vashon high schools and dozens of Foot Locker Facebook pages. In a moment, we will force 
Facebook to focus on specific entities.

If your target's name is Tom Johnson, you have your work cut out for you. This does not mean that you will 
never find his Facebook page, but you will need to take additional steps to get to your target. When searching 
the name, several possibilities may appear in the results. This is obviously not the complete list of Tom Johnsons 
that are present on Facebook. At the bottom of this list is an option to "See All" the profiles with your target 
name. This is also not the complete list. Scrolling down should automatically populate more 
look through these and hope to identify your target based on the photo, location, or 
displayed in this view. Instead, consider adding filters within the left menu.
Once a user's profile is located, the default view is the "timeline" tab. This will include basic information such 
as gender, location, family members, friends, relationship status, interests, education, and work background. 
This page will also commonly have a photo of the user and any recent posts on their page. Clicking through this 
data may uncover valuable evidence, but you may be missing other data. I will explain numerous methods 
throughout this chapter which should help identify all available content relevant to your investigation.
First, consider using the traditional filter options available on most Facebook pages. Figure 10.02 displays the 
main filter bar on the top of ever}’ Facebook profile page. This will seek Photos, Videos, Places, Groups, and 
other options associated with the profile. You may be able to click through the various sections in order to 
reveal all publicly available content. My preference is to query via direct URL so that I know I did not miss 
anything. Assume that your target is Mark Zuckerberg. His profile is available at the following URL.
Typing in a target's real name should lead to results, many of which are unrelated to your investigation. Unlike 
other social networks, Facebook users typically use their real name when creating a profile. This profile is usually 
linked to an employer, graduating high school class, college alumni, or general interests. With billions of active 
users, it will be likely that you will locate several user profiles under the same name as your target. There arc a 
few things that you can do to find the right person.

Let’s conduct another keyword search within the official site. Assume you wanted to find any posts including 
the term "OS1NT". After conducting the basic search, you should scroll to the end of the limited results and 
click "See all public posts for OSINT". This expands the search and opens the Posts filter options. From there, 
you can filter by year or location. You could also click through the other categories such as Videos or Groups. 
All basic Facebook filters can be applied using direct URLs. Considering an interest in the term "OSINT", the 
following addresses replicate each of the filters of a standard Facebook search.
This method was sloppy since I am forcing Facebook to include the keyword of "photos" within my search. It 
likely has no impact since we are seeking photos, but it could limit our search. If my target was posts, I would 
have begun my search with that term. /\t the time of this writing, there is no way to search Facebook's site by 
filters only. You must include a search term. In a moment, our tool will bypass this restriction with a new 
method. Photos can also be searched by generic location. Figure 10.04 demonstrates the "Photos" option after 
searching "Chicago". The filter on the left can filter results based on author, type, location, and date.
The Facebook search tool presented in a moment will allow you to execute all of these URL queries easily in 
order to minimize the effort to explore a profile. Let's conduct another example of searching through Facebook's 
official channels. /Xssume you want to see photos posted by Mark Zuckerberg while he was in San Francisco in 
2015. First, we need to obtain access to Facebook's filters, which are not visible when looking at a target's profile. 
My preferred way to do this is to conduct a search on Facebook for "photos" (without the quotes). This confuses 
Facebook a bit and tells it to present the "top" photos, but also presents the filter menu to the left. I can now 
click on "Photos" and enter the desired filters. Figure 10.03 displays my results.

This presents the end of basic Facebook search techniques through the official site. Every thing presented until 
now should apply for a while, and these URL structures should not change soon. Analyzing all of the evidence 
identified through these URLs should present substantial information. Many of these pages, such as a person's 
timeline, will load continuously. Pressing the space bar on your keyboard should load everything until the end.

Prior to June of 2019, a simple URL would display content posted by an individual. As an example, the following 
URL would display all photos posted by a specific user (4).
In order to conduct the following detailed searches, you must know the user number of your target. This number 
is a unique identifier that will allow us to search otherwise hidden information from Facebook. Prior to mid- 
2015, the easiest way to identify the user number of any Facebook user was through the Graph API. While you 
were on a user's main profile, you could replace "www" in the address with "graph" and receive the profile ID 
number of that user. This no longer works because Facebook removed the ability to search their graph API by 
username. However, we can still obtain this powerful number through a manual search option.
In this example, the user ID of this profile is 4. We will use this number for numerous searches within the next 
instruction. Some users prefer to look at the URLs of a target's photos in order to identify the user ID, but I 
believe this is bad practice. If a user has no photos, this will not work. Also, Facebook's photo displays often 
hide this information from plain sight. 1 prefer to rely on the source code view or my Facebook tools for this 
identification. This number will allow us to obtain many more details about the account. Until July of 2019, 
there were dozens of online search tools which would identify the user ID number (4) when supplied a username 
(zuck). Almost all of these stopped functioning, including my own, when Facebook began aggressively blocking 
these search tools.
This technique involves viewing the source code of any user's Facebook profile. The process for this will vary 
by browser. In Firefox and Chrome, simply right-click on a Facebook profile page and select "View Page 
Source". Be sure not to hover on any hyperlinks during the right-click. A new tab should open with the text- 
only view of the source code of that individual profile. Within the browser, conduct a search on this page for 
"userID". This will identify a portion of the code within this page that contains that specific term. As an example 
the following is the source code visible in Zuck's profile.
While you may' find an online option which still functions, we should not rely’ on these. If you are exhausted 
from searching within each profile's source code in order to locate the user ID, 1 reluctandy offer three sites 
which currently attempt to automatically replicate this process.
This technique no longer works, and the replacement method is much more difficult. Instead of 
"facebook.com/search", our base URL is as follows. Note a search term (q=photos) is required.
At this point, you should be able to locate a target's profile by name with filters; analyze the publicly available 
content; and search by topic. That is just the tip of the iceberg. Facebook collects a lot of additional information 
from everyone's activity on the social network. Every time someone "Likes" something or is tagged in a photo, 
Facebook stores that information. Extracting these details can be difficult.
1 have found taping down the space bar helpful for long pages. From here, we 
and apply some fairly technical methods in order to get to the next level.

This is followed by the structure of the following.
{'’rp_author":"{\"name\":\"author\",\"args\":\"[USERlD]\"}"}
However, it must be presented in Base64 format, which would be the following.
eyJycF9hdXRob3IiOiJ7XCJuYWllXCI6XCJhdXRob3JcIixcImFyZ3NdjpcIjRcInOifQ
Therefore, the entire URL would be the following.
Previously, 1 presented the following

Let's break this down. The following explains each section of this URL

&epa=FILTERS&filters=
Confused? I sure was. It took me a while to process what was going on here. Let's start over, and approach the 
creation of a custom URL in three phases. First, let's tackle the Facebook search URL. In the previous example, 
I displayed the following.
cyJycF9hdXRob3IiOiJ7XCJuY\VllXCI6XCJhdXRob3JclixdmFyZ3NcIjpcIjRcInOifQ==
The final two "==" are optional, and not necessary. When I paste this value into the decoder on this website, I 
receive the exact data originally entered. Let's take a look at the screen captures. Figure 10.05 (top) displays the 
desired text data, including my target's user ID number. Figure 10.05 (bottom) displays the result coded in 
Base64. Figure 10.06 (top) displays the opposite technique by converting the previous Base64 result back to the 
original desired data in Figure 10.06 (bottom). 1 realize this is confusing, but our search tools will simplify all of 
this in a moment.
Next, we must formulate our target data and convert it to a specific type of encoding called Base64. This is likely 
used because it is extremely common and can be generated by any browser. T ' 
r"”
data.
{ ,rp_author":"{\"name\":\"author\",\”args\’':\"[USERID]\"}"}
This tells Facebook that we are searching for information from a specific profile (author), and the [USERID] 
should contain your target s user ID number as determined earlier. If we were targeting "zuck", and knew his 
user number was "4", we would have the following data.
{"rp_author":"{\"name\":\"author\",\"args\":\"4\"}"}
Notice the position of "4" as the user number. Now, we must convert this data into Base64.1 prefer the website 
https.//codebeautify.org/base64-encode and we can check our work at the decoding version at 
https.//codebeautify.org/base64-decode. When I copy and paste the previous data into this website, I receive 
the following.
