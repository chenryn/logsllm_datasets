### 4.2 Results

The recognition rates for the four articles in our experiments are shown in Figure 6. The first row presents the recognition rates without HMM-based post-processing, which corresponds to the output of the matching phase. For illustration, the rate at which the correct word was among the top three highest-ranked words is provided in parentheses. The second row shows the recognition rates after applying post-processing with HMMs based on 3-grams.

| Text   | Basic Top 1 (Top 3) | HMM 3-gram |
|--------|---------------------|-------------|
| Text 1 | 60.5% (75.1%)       | 69.9%       |
| Text 2 | 66.5% (79.2%)       | 71.2%       |
| Text 3 | 62.8% (78.7%)       | 66.7%       |
| Text 4 | 61.5% (77.9%)       | 71.8%       |
| Overall| 62.9% (78.0%)       | 69.0%       |

The recognition rates for the two additional documents containing living-will declarations, using domain-specific HMM-based post-processing, are depicted in Figure 7. The first row shows the results without HMM-based post-processing, the second row shows the results with general-purpose HMM-based post-processing, and the third row shows the results with domain-specific HMM-based post-processing.

| Declaration  | Basic Top 1 (Top 3) | HMM 3-gram (General) | HMM 3-gram (Domain-Specific) |
|--------------|---------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------|
| Declaration 1| 59.5% (77.8%)       | 68.3%                 | 95.2%                         |
| Declaration 2| 57.5% (72.6%)       | 60.8%                 | 72.5%                         |

We achieve recognition rates between 67% and 72% for the four articles when using HMM-based post-processing with a general-purpose corpus. However, using domain-specific corpora yields even better results, with recognition rates of 95.2% and 72.5% for the two living-will declarations, respectively.

### 4.3 Discussion and Supplemental Experiments

We evaluated the influence of various parameters on the recognition rate, including different microphones, printers, and fonts. Our findings can be summarized as follows:

#### 4.3.1 Using Different Microphones

Our experiments indicate that relevant information is carried in the frequency range above approximately 20 kHz. While microphones with a nominal frequency range higher than 20 kHz are expensive, some microphones with a nominal frequency range of 20 kHz can still capture higher frequencies. Figure 8 shows the recognition rates for one sample article using different microphone models.

**Figure 8: Reconstruction Results with Different Microphone Models and Printer Models**

| Microphone/Printer Model         | Top 1 (Top 3)     |
|----------------------------------|-------------------|
| Sennheiser MKH-8040 + Epson LQ-300+II | 62% (78%)        |
| Behringer B-5 + Epson LQ-300+II  | 59% (85%)        |
| Sennheiser ME 2 + Epson LQ-300+II| 57% (72%)        |
| OKI Microline 1190               | 41% (51%)        |
| Another Epson LQ-300+II          | 54% (72%)        |
| Proportional Font                | 57% (71%)        |

#### 4.3.2 Using Different Dot-Matrix Printers

We also evaluated the impact of different dot-matrix printer models on the recognition rate. The fourth row of Figure 8 shows the recognition rates for an article printed with an OKI Microline 1190 printer. The recognition rate is slightly lower but still acceptable. Additionally, we found that using a different printer of the same model for the training phase only slightly decreases the recognition rate.

#### 4.3.3 Using Proportional Fonts

Monospaced fonts are commonly used in dot-matrix printers, but proportional fonts can also be used. Our experiments show that the recognition still works well with proportional fonts, albeit at a slightly lower rate (see Figure 8).

#### 4.3.4 On Attacking Other Printer Technologies

While dot-matrix printers are still used in some security-critical applications, they have been largely replaced by ink-jet and laser printers. Ink-jet printers might be susceptible to similar attacks due to the shock-waves produced by ink bubbles and piezo-electric elements. However, our experiments did not capture these emanations, likely due to the dominance of mechanical noise. Laser printers, on the other hand, do not appear to leak information about the printed text.

### 4.4 Countermeasures

Countermeasures aim to suppress acoustic emanations to make reconstruction difficult in practical scenarios.

- **Acoustic Shielding Foam:** The specific printer model used in most experiments has an optional cover with embedded acoustic shielding foam. Closing this cover significantly reduces acoustic emanations. We also tested a foam box, which surprisingly had a good recognition rate of 51%.
- **Distance:** Increasing the distance between the printer and the microphone substantially reduces the recognition rate. At 2 meters, the recognition rate drops to approximately 4%.
- **Closed Door:** With the door closed, no reconstruction was possible, indicating that ensuring the absence of microphones in the printer’s room is sufficient to protect privacy.

### 5 In-Field Attack

We successfully conducted the attack in a doctor's practice to recover the content of medical prescriptions. The setup is shown in Figure 13. For privacy reasons, we obtained permission and used an artificial client. The attack was conducted during rush hour, with many people in the waiting room. We recorded the sounds of printing seven different prescriptions and provided the sound recordings, printouts of six prescriptions, and a printer of the same type to one of the authors. The author followed these steps:

1. Identified the position of the prescribed medication, the direction of printing, and the font from the available printouts.
2. Determined the correct length and white-space positions using a suitable threshold.
3. Matched the lengths to a publicly available medication directory, narrowing down to 29 candidates.
4. Selected the correct medication, "Müller’sche Tabletten bei Halsschmerzen," from the remaining candidates.

The attack was easier in this practical scenario due to the ability to narrow down the list of candidates.
