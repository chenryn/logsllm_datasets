of the printer obtaining the threshold values is straight-
forward, as they can be determined directly from the
intensity plots.
In case of a more blurred signal (e.g.,
due to a larger distance), we iteratively determined suit-
able values, essentially by trial-and-error. The training
phase takes a one-time effort of several hours for build-
ing up the sound feature database for the words in the
dictionary. The recognition phase takes approximately
2 hours for matching one page of text, including full
HMM-based post-processing. Memory usage of the pro-
cedure is substantial, because the feature database and
the HMM-related information are kept in main memory
to speed up computation. Trade-offs with less memory
consumption but larger execution times can easily be re-
alized.

cur in the dictionary can be achieved using several techniques: Using
contextual knowledge to reduce the number of words that are likely to
appear in the text, training a larger dictionary, or using feedback-based
learning to subsequently add missing words to the dictionary.

ond row depicts the recognition rates after applying post-
processing with HMMs based on 3-grams. We thus
achieve recognition rates between 67 % and 72 % for
the four articles.
While the aforementioned results employ HMM-
based post-processing using a general-purpose corpus,
our experiments indicate that domain-speciﬁc corpora
yield even better results. Recall that we considered two
additional documents containing living-will declarations
that we intended to analyze using a domain-speciﬁc cor-
pus. The recognition rates for the two living-will decla-
rations are depicted in Figure 7. The ﬁrst / second row

HMM-based post-processing; the third row shows the re-

and 72.5 % for the two documents, respectively. Text
examples for the reconstruction using a general-purpose
corpus and a domain-speciﬁc corpus are provided in Ap-
pendix A and Appendix B, respectively.
We also experimented with 4-gram and 5-gram lan-
guage models.
In addition to encountering even more
severe problems of memory consumptions, our experi-
ments indicated that the recognition rates do not improve
over 3-grams. While this behavior might be surprising at
a ﬁrst glance, it can be explained by the sparseness of the
training data: The number of 5-grams that we can extract
from our corpus is approx. 107, but the transition matrix
of an HMM based on 5-grams on a dictionary of 1,000
words has 1015 entries; thus the number of 5-grams is
too small compared to the number of entries. For similar
reasons 4-grams and 5-grams are rarely used in natural
language processing.
4.3 Discussion and Supplemental Experi-
ments
We have evaluated the inﬂuence on the recognition rate
of using different microphones, different printers, pro-
portional fonts, etc., and we investigated why the recon-
struction works from a conceptual perspective. In a nut-
shell, the results can be summarized as follows (details
are given below): Several parameters of modiﬁed set-ups
did not affect the recognition rate and gave comparable
results, e.g., using cheaper microphones or using differ-
ent printers (of the same model) for the training phase
and the recognition phase. Using proportional instead
of mono-spaced fonts or using different printer models
only slightly decreased the recognition rate. Some con-
siderably stronger modiﬁcations, however, did not work
out at all, and they can be seen as conceptual limitations
of our attack. This comprises using completely differ-
ent printer technologies such as ink-jet or laser printers
(because of the absence of suitable sound emissions that
can be used to mount the attack). We provide statistical
results on these modiﬁcations below. Furthermore, we
evaluate countermeasures.
4.3.1 Using different microphones
Our experiments have indicated that information that is
relevant for us is carried in the frequency range above
approximately 20 kHz, see Section 3. Microphones with
nominal frequency range higher than 20 kHz are rather
expensive, e.g., the Sennheiser microphone referred to
in Section 4.1 has a frequency range up to 50 kHz and
costs approximately 1,300 dollars. However, our experi-
ments have shown that some microphones with a nomi-
nal frequency range of 20 kHz are sensitive to higher fre-

processing was applied.)
quencies as well (possibly with less accurate frequency
response, but this had no noticeable inﬂuence on the
recognition rate as long as we use the same microphone
for recording both the training data and the attack data).
Figure 8 shows in the second row the recognition rates
of one sample article if a Behringer B-5 microphone is
used, which has a nominal frequency range up to 20 kHz
and costs approximately 80 dollars. The results obtained
with the Behringer microphone are only slightly worse
than the results using the Sennheiser microphone.
We also conducted an experiment using a small clip-
on microphone – a Sennheiser ME 2 with nominal fre-
quency range up to 18 kHz, which costs approximately
130 dollars. The recognition rates of one sample ar-
ticle are shown in the third row of Figure 8; they are
again only slightly worse than the rates with the larger
Sennheiser microphone.
4.3.2 Using different dot-matrix printers
We also evaluated if the printer model inﬂuences the
recognition rate. The fourth row of Figure 8 shows the
recognition rates of one article printed with an OKI Mi-
croline 1190 printer. The recognition rate is not as good
as for the Epson printer, but it is still good.
So far we always considered the set-up that training
data and the attacked text are printed on the same printer.
In a realistic attack scenario, however, it is unlikely
that the attacker can print the training data on the same
printer, but instead arranges access to another printer of
the same printer model that he places in an acoustically
similar environment. Our in-ﬁeld attack described in de-
tail in Section 5 is of this kind.
We demonstrate that the recognition rate only de-
creases slightly when using a different printer in the
training phase. For this experiment we used the feature
database that we previously recorded in the experiment
described in Section 4.2, and printed one article on an-
other Epson LQ-300+II printer that we bought from a
different vendor. The recognition rate is shown in Fig-
Figure 9: Ink-jet printer, disassembled for analysis.
ure 8, indicating a decrease of recognition rate of about
8 % compared with the results from Section 4.2.
This shows that it is practical to train a large dictionary
ofﬂine. In the in-ﬁeld attack described in Section 5 we
use this result and train a dictionary on a separate printer.
4.3.3 Using proportional fonts
Monospaced fonts are commonly used in many appli-
cations of dot-matrix printers; in particular, the in-built
fonts are monospaced, and most applications seem to use
these in-built fonts. Using proportional fonts instead in-
tuitively relies on a more compact depiction of words that
ampliﬁes the effect of blurring. However, our experi-
ments demonstrate that the recognition still works well,
at a slightly lower rate (see Figure 8).
4.3.4 On attacking other printer technologies
While dot-matrix printers are still deployed in some
security-critical applications (see Figure 1), they have
been replaced by other printer technologies such as ink-
jet printers (see Figure 9) and laser printers in other ap-
plications. Ink-jet printers might be susceptible to simi-
lar attacks, as they construct the printout from individ-

ual dots, as dot-matrix printers do. On the one hand,
the bubbles of ink might produce shock-waves in the air
that potentially can be captured by a microphone; on the
other hand, the piezo-electric elements used in some ink-
jet printers might produce noise that can be measured.
However, we were not able to capture these emanations.
One reason might be that these faint sounds, if they ex-
ist, are dominated by the noise emitted by the mechani-
cal parts of a printer. For laser printers, one expects that
no information about the printed text is leaked, and our
experiments support this view. Thus, to the best of our
knowledge, these printer technologies seem to be unaf-
fected by this kind of attack.

4.4 Countermeasures
The (obvious) idea that underlies all countermeasures is
to suppress the acoustic emanations so far that recon-
struction becomes hard in practical scenarios.
Acoustic shielding foam: The speciﬁc printer model that
we used in most experiments has an optional printer
cover with embedded acoustic shielding foam. Closing
this cover absorbs a substantial amount of the acoustic
emanation (see Figure 11). To further evaluate this idea,
we built a box out of ordinary acoustic foam and placed
the printer inside (shown in Figure 12). In contrast to the
results with the cover, the recognition rate for the foam
box was surprisingly good; 51 % of the words were re-
constructed successfully. We believe that the shielding
characteristics of the two types of foam suppress differ-
ent ranges of the acoustic spectrum and thus have differ-
ent effects on the reconstruction rate.
11
Figure 12: Printer in foam box for shielding evaluation.
Figure 13: The setup of the in-ﬁeld attack.
Distance: Our experiments indicate that the recogni-
tion rate drops substantially if the distance between the
printer and the microphone is increased. From a distance
of 2 meters, the recognition rate drops to approximately
4 % (see Figure 11). From this distance our algorithm for
splitting the signal into words requires manual interven-
tion, as the audio signal contains more noise. However,
we stress that this limitation can be circumvented in an
in-ﬁeld attack by placing a miniaturized wireless bug in
close proximity to (or even in) the printer.
Closed door: We also tested the reconstruction from out-
side the printer’s room with the door closed; the over-
all distance between the printer and the microphone was
4 meters. As expected, we found that in this setup no
reconstruction was possible at all.
Our results indicate that ensuring the absence of mi-
crophones in the printer’s room is sufﬁcient to protect
privacy. Unfortunately, this evaluation is not guaran-
teed to be complete; we merely state that our attack does
not work under these circumstances. However, we be-
lieve that the potential for improvement is limited; thus
the above discussion still provides reasonable estimates.
As future work, we furthermore plan to investigate addi-
tional countermeasures such as introducing randomness
into the printer’s sound through software changes, e.g.,
by letting the printer print individual letters in a (some-
what) randomized order instead of always proceeding
left-to-right.
5 In-ﬁeld Attack
We have successfully mounted the attack in-ﬁeld in a
doctor’s practice to recover the content of medical pre-
scriptions (the setup of the attack is shown in Figure 13).
For privacy reasons, we asked for permission upfront and
let the secretary print fresh prescriptions of an artiﬁcial
client. The attack was conducted under realistic – and
arguably even pessimistic – circumstances: during rush
hour, with many people chatting in the waiting room.
We recorded the emitted sounds of printing seven dif-
ferent prescriptions. We handed over all sound record-
ings, the printouts of six prescriptions, and a printer of
the same type (an Epson LQ-570) that we bought at Ebay
to one of the authors of this paper. The printouts were
only used to determine which parts of the sound record-
ing correspond to which parts of the prescription. The
attack was carried out blindly, i.e, this author obtained
no information about the seventh prescription except for
its recorded sound.
The author carrying out the attack took the following
steps:
1. From the available printouts, he ﬁrst identiﬁed the
position of the prescribed medication, the direction
of printing, and the used font.
2. Using a suitable threshold, he subsequently deter-
mined the correct length and the white-space posi-
tions.
3. From a publicly available medication directory with
about 14,000 different medications, he then de-
termined possible candidates that matched these
lengths. Here, abbreviations of words were also
taken into account. The list of remaining candidates
consisted of 29 entries.
4. The selection of candidate words (without HMM-
based post-processing) then already revealed the
correct medication out of the remaining 29 candi-
dates.
The correct medication was “M¨uller’sche Tablet-
ten bei Halsschmerzen”, a medication against sore
throat. The printing was even abbreviated on the
prescription as
M¨uller’sche Tabletten bei
Halsschm.
12
The attack was actually easier to conduct in this practi-
cal scenario compared to the experiments in Section 4,
because we were able to substantially narrow down the
list of candidates by taking into account length informa-
tion of the medication. Admittedly, the secretary herself
unintentionally simpliﬁed this task by selecting a long
