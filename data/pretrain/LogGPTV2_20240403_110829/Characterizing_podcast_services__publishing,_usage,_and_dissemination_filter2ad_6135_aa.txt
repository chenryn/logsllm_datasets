ABSTRACT
In this paper, we aim at characterizing podcast services both
from publishers’ and users’ perspectives, and at analyzing
the implications of these characteristics on the design of eﬃ-
cient dissemination systems. Speciﬁcally, our goal is to char-
acterize how podcasting content is generated and published,
and how users subscribe and consume podcasts. We are
also interested in understanding whether podcast episodes
are eﬃciently disseminated to users just using a sporadic
direct access to the Internet (which is the current way of
downloading podcast episodes), or whether the use of peer-
to-peer mobile device-to-device dissemination systems could
help enhancing the performance of podcast services.
Our study is based on traces of podcast episode releases,
subscriptions, and play times from major podcast service
providers. An extensive analysis of the traces allows us to
develop a comprehensive model of current podcast services,
and provide statistics about the type and content of the typ-
ical podcasts, the size and the release frequencies of their
episodes, as well as their popularity. By studying podcast
usage, we show that the service is delay-tolerant, as users
may well play podcast episodes a long time after their ac-
tual release. An interesting consequence of this delay toler-
ance is that mobile device-to-device dissemination systems
would not be very useful for the current typical podcasts,
while they may become more attractive for future interac-
tive podcast services.

INTRODUCTION
Podcasting has evolved into one of the mainstream In-
ternet services. Podcasts refer to series of ﬁles (i.e., feeds),
typically of media type such as audio or video, that are dis-
tributed through web syndication mechanisms such as RSS
(Really Simple Syndication). Users subscribing to a podcast
retrieve the corresponding ﬁles or episodes when they are
made available by accessing a centrally-maintained web feed.
The episodes are thus automatically downloaded and then
stored locally on the user’s computer or other mobile device,
for oﬄine use. Recent studies suggest that the podcast audi-
ence comprises at least one in ten Internet users today while
it is expected to double over the next ﬁve years [1]. Tra-
ditional popular media and content providers expand their
audiences through podcasts, and online marketers use pod-
casting to increase sales as correlation between podcast lis-
teners and online shopping has been observed [2]. However,
despite this widespread growth, studies of the characteristics
of podcasting services have been limited, see for example [3].
This work is a step towards advancing our understanding
of podcasting services along three dimensions: Publishing,
usage and dissemination. In particular, our analysis provides
answers to the following questions.
Q1. Publishing: Who are the main podcast creators? Where
are podcast episodes typically published? What are
the typical content and size of podcast episodes? What
are the underlying dynamics of podcast content gener-
ation?
Q2. Usage: How do users subscribe to podcasts and con-
sume content? What are the most popular podcasts?
Can we identify potential models explaining how users
subscribe to the diﬀerent podcasts and leading to the
observed discrepancy in their popularity?
Q3. Dissemination: What is the typical delay between the
times podcast episodes are released and played by users
on their PC or mobile device? Given this delay and
the statistical characteristics of podcasts, what are the
most natural and eﬃcient ways to disseminate the pod-
cast episodes to users? When could ad-hoc mobile
device-to-device dissemination be of interest?
Our analysis is based on a 70-day dataset, comprising logs
from one of the major podcast provider services. In contrast
to previous works that focused on properties of content gen-
eration through crawled data, our dataset further captures
user actions such as subscription, unsubscription and pod-
cast consumption (i.e., play) events. This is important as
209it allows us to distinguish “true” user interest by examin-
ing which of the user subscribed podcasts are actually con-
sumed. Additionally, our data provides visibility into the
evolution of podcast popularity both from a user subscrip-
tion (i.e., What’s popular? ), and from a user play perspective
(i.e., What’s hot? ). To stress-test the representativeness of
our data, we also crawl additional podcast provider services.
Analyzing the podcast services from the publishers’ per-
spective, we ﬁnd that podcasters may either be traditional
broadcasters such as TV and radio channels, but may also
be independent creators publishing their podcasts via one
of the main podcast portals, e.g., Google’s feedburner. We
also observe that podcast content is generated periodically,
with the most prominent periods being the weekly and daily
content generation. The median episode size is roughly 15
Mbytes for audio and 30 Mbytes for video, and the median
rate of content released per podcast is about 20 Mbytes per
week, but both episode size and rate depend on the type of
podcast (i.e., audio or video). We further ﬁnd that content
does not appear to be released uniformly throughout the
day.
Regarding podcast usage, we ﬁnd that while the popu-
larity of podcasts across diﬀerent perspectives (podcast vs.
play) follows in general the Pareto principle (i.e., 80-20 rule),
only roughly 20% of the rankings of podcasts based on sub-
scriptions and plays coincide. This eﬀect appears invariant
across the set of most popular feeds, and holds for roughly
the top-100 most popular podcasts. This ﬁnding implies
that subscription popularity does not necessarily imply con-
sumption of the podcast content.
In general, we observe
that users subscribe to roughly 6 podcasts on average, while
at the same time consume less than 4 per week. Subscrip-
tions per podcast on the other hand appear to grow linearly
in the number of existing subscriptions. Our observations
suggest existence of “rich-get-richer” type of popularity re-
inforcements, which might be the eﬀect of selective pod-
cast promotion through the user interface (i.e., display of a
“what’s popular” or “what’s hot” list). Content consumption
exhibits a dichotomy with respect to the device used, with
users playing podcasts typically on a single type of device,
a PC or a mobile device, but not on both. This observation
suggests that users develop a consistent way of interacting
with the service.
Finally, concerning podcast dissemination, one of our main
ﬁndings is that podcasts currently constitute a delay-tolerant
service. Speciﬁcally, the median delay between the times
episodes are released and played by users is about 10 days
and that this delay is 1 day or shorter for only as few as
1% of podcasts. Given this delay-tolerance and the statisti-
cal characteristics of podcasts, it seems that for most of the
podcasts, it would suﬃce to synchronize podcast contents
on mobile devices a few times a day. Thus, given the cur-
rent nature of the podcasts, their dissemination may be done
through sporadic access to the Internet (e.g., while the de-
vice is connected to a PC when the user is at home or oﬃce).
Mobile device-to-device dissemination would be of interest
for podcasts whose delay tolerance is less than a day (as
otherwise, the content can be synchronized while connected
to the Internet). While we didn’t ﬁnd such podcasts to be
typical, they may well become popular in the future. This is
indeed suggested by the rising trend towards more interac-
tive podcasting-like services, e.g., twitter. Device-to-device
dissemination could also be of interest in scenarios where the
Internet access is limited, e.g., while on travel or at places
with limited infrastructure.
Our contributions can be summarized in the following
points:
• We provide an extensive characterization of a popular
podcast provider service based on a 70-day dataset.
This analysis allows us to suggest generic models for
the creation and the publication of podcasts, as well
as for the way episodes belonging to the same podcast
are released (Section 3).
• We describe possible models for user-to-content match-
ing by examining how users may subscribe to podcasts
and play their episodes. The analysis reveals that pop-
ularity reinforcements are in place (Section 4).
• We provide an initial discussion on the implications of
our ﬁndings for podcast dissemination systems. Specif-
ically, it seems that disseminating podcasts through
classical sporadic access to the Internet suﬃces given
their current delay-tolerant nature. Ad-hoc mobile
device-to-device dissemination could become more ap-
propriate for future interactive podcasting services (Sec-
tion 5).
We believe that our study is among the ﬁrst to provide
guidelines for eﬃcient design of large scale podcast services
by examining several properties, both from a service and
also from a user perspective. Our ﬁndings are further infor-
mative for the design of dissemination systems, such as ad
hoc podcast services [4], and in general, for modeling and
simulations in performance evaluation studies in the context
of publish-subscribe systems.
2. DATA SETS AND METHODOLOGY
The results presented in this work are mainly based on a
70-day trace from the Zune Social service [5]. The service
provides a web interface for users to discover, download, play
and purchase media items, such as songs or videos, games,
audiobooks and podcasts. The service also oﬀers social net-
working features, such as exposing playlists to friends. Me-
dia items can be played either on regular PCs through the
Zune software, or could be uploaded to and played on the
Zune device.
Our focus is on podcasts. Fig. 1 presents a snapshot of
the Zune Social user interface for the podcasting service.
Users are presented with featured podcasts in three main
lists (i.e., what’s hot?, most subscribed, new additions), and
additionally they may browse available podcasts classiﬁed
under a number of categories or through a search service.
Users may subscribe or unsubscribe to podcasts, and are
allowed to sync and play podcasts to which they have sub-
scribed. Our data captures all such actions. Speciﬁcally,
each log entry speciﬁes a timestamp, a user and a media id
(both ids are hashes), and the corresponding action (sub-
scribe, unsubscribe and play). For play actions, our data
further indicates whether plays occur on the PC client or on
the Zune device. Overall, in our dataset, we observe a to-
tal number of podcast users in the order of several hundred
thousands and more than 8 thousands podcasts.
To infer the media type (e.g., audio or video) as well as
acquire information regarding the ﬁles released per podcast
(henceforth referred to also as episodes), we perform a crawl
210Figure 1: A snapshot of the Zune Social podcasting service. Users can subscribe to podcasts by choosing
from three pre-compiled lists, namely, “what’s hot?”, “most subscribed”, and “new additions”. Additionally,
users can browse podcasts by category or search for podcasts by keywords.
of the Zune Social service. Crawling provides speciﬁc pod-
cast information from the RSS xml ﬁle, such as the mime
type, title and generation time of podcast episodes, ﬁle size,
etc. The media id allows us to correlate trace entries with
the information crawled. However, care needs to be taken
as we observed several discrepancies in the xml ﬁelds, espe-
cially regarding the episode size with missing or incorrect
values. The size ﬁeld appears to be manually entered by the
podcaster operating the feed. To correct for such discrepan-
cies we further infer the size of podcast episodes by actually
downloading the episodes. We observe a signiﬁcant fraction
of incorrectly reported ﬁle sizes (about 35%), and for about
13% of the ﬁles the relative error is larger than 10%. We
further manually categorize podcasts by extracting frequent
keywords from the xml ﬁles, following the categories pro-
vided by the Zune service (see Fig. 1, i.e., Arts, Business,
Education, Entertainment, Health, International, Lifestyle,
Mediacasts, Music, News & Politics, Religion & Spirituality,
Science, Technology, Sports and Travel).
Since our dataset is a 70-day snapshot of the service, we
cannot observe events that took place before the tracing
period. This creates some inconsistencies in user action se-
quences, by, for example, observing a play action or an un-
subscribe event without observing a corresponding subscrip-
tion event. To account for these inconsistencies, we identify
all such actions, and insert subscription events for all such
users and the corresponding media ids at the beginning of
the trace (i.e., at time 0). This correction allows us to in-
fer the true subscription popularity per podcast. Note that
when examining dynamics such as the subscription rate per
podcast in the following sections, we leave all such inserted
subscriptions out of the analysis, as they could bias ﬁndings
(e.g., creating a spike of subscriptions at time 0).
Finally, to examine the representativeness of the Zune
data set, we crawl the top-100 podcasts from additional pod-
cast provider services, namely iTunes US and UK. However,
note that this comparison is essentially feasible only for char-
acteristics that are visible through the RSS xml ﬁles, such
as the podcast episode release times, ﬁle sizes, etc.
