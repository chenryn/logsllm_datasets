Hello,
I've came to notice that I have the following console log:  
`THREE.WebGLRenderer 84`
I haven't found any issues, however, it is mandatory that this specific site
does not have any console logs.
Is it possible to hide/disable this log?
I've noticed other issues where people have had the same log (suggesting the
log is related to Chrome or graphics cards), although I haven't seen any
solutions.
Thank you.
