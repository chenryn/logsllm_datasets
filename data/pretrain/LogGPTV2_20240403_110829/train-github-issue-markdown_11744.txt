### Issue: Disabling Code Splitting in Webpack for Library Build

**Goal:**
I want to disable code splitting in my Webpack configuration to build a single output file for a library.

**Approach:**
I added the `LimitChunkCountPlugin` to the Webpack configuration as follows:

```javascript
plugins: [
  new webpack.optimize.LimitChunkCountPlugin({
    maxChunks: 1,
  }),
]
```

**Error:**
When I run the build, I encounter the following error:

```
ERROR in webpack/runtime/runtimeId
RuntimeIdRuntimeModule must be in a single runtime
Error: RuntimeIdRuntimeModule must be in a single runtime

```

**Observation:**
The build works fine without the `LimitChunkCountPlugin`.

**Environment:**
- Node.js: v14.19.0
- Webpack: 5.69.1

### Possible Solutions

1. **Check Webpack Configuration:**
   Ensure that your Webpack configuration does not have conflicting settings. For example, make sure there are no other plugins or configurations that might interfere with the `LimitChunkCountPlugin`.

2. **Update Dependencies:**
   Consider updating your Node.js and Webpack versions to the latest stable releases. This might resolve any compatibility issues.

3. **Alternative Approach:**
   If the `LimitChunkCountPlugin` continues to cause issues, you can try using the `optimization.splitChunks` option to disable code splitting:

   ```javascript
   optimization: {
     splitChunks: false,
   }
   ```

4. **Community and Documentation:**
   Check the Webpack documentation and community forums for similar issues and potential solutions. The error message suggests a problem with the `RuntimeIdRuntimeModule`, which might be related to how Webpack handles runtime modules in your specific setup.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue with disabling code splitting in your Webpack configuration.
