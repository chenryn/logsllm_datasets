In the bootstrap.css file used on the demo site, at line 97 there are
selectors for body, a and a:hover. In the downloadable version accessible from
http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/download.html these are missing. Currently
scaffolding.less (commit `7f32d15`) contains these lines and nothing else.
Seems like this .less file might be missing from the build generated via the
Customize page.
