User: So, I have looked around stack overflow + other sites, but havent been able to solve this problem: hence posting this question! 
I have recently started learning django... and am now trying to run it on ec2.
I have an ec2 instance of this format: ec2-xx-xxx-xx-xxx.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com on which I have a django app running. I changed the security group of this instance to allow http port 80 connections. 
I did try to run it the django app the following ways: python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000 and python manage.py runserver ec2-xx-xxx-xx-xxx.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8000 and that doesnt seem to be helping either!
To make sure that there is nothing faulty from django's side, I opened another terminal window and ssh'ed into the instance and did a curl GET request to localhost:8000/admin which went through successfully.
Where am I going wrong? Will appreciate any help!
