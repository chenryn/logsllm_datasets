User: I'm searching for a single function to convert RGB tuple (255, 255, 255) or HTML hex (#FFFFFF) to X11 color (0...255 int) to manage colors in Unix terminal. I've looked over the internet but I didn't find anything like that, so I'm asking for code or link to a website that contains code or information about how I can do this in Python.
Assistant: You can't convert to x11 colors automatically.
x11 colors are basically just names mapped to arbitrary RGB values, so the only way to get from RGB to x11 is to reverse the map.
If you want to convert an RGB color that isn't in x11 to the closest match in x11 that would be pretty difficult.
