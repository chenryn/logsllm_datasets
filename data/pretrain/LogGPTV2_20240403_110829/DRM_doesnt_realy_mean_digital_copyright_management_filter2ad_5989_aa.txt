## Abstract
Copyright is a legal system embedded within a broader technological framework. To fully understand the functions of copyright, it is essential to examine its larger technological context, particularly analog media and printed paper. The copyright system encompasses both explicit mechanisms implemented by law and implicit mechanisms resulting from the technological characteristics of paper and print. To avoid confusion between the legal, technical, and economic elements, I refer to the entire system as "copy accuracy."

Designing digital rights management (DRM) systems should explicitly address the legal issues in copyright, the economics of paper, the technology of mass-produced analog media, and print culture. An examination of this entire system (copy accuracy) leads to a return to first principles for the design of DRM systems.

## 1. Introduction
In a world where paper is no longer the primary medium, copyright no longer protects the message. Gradual extensions of copyright have accommodated changes in media, such as wax, vinyl, and magnetic tape recordings. However, digital media represent a fundamental shift—a change in kind rather than degree.

When designing systems to implement copyright in the digital age, this change in medium must be considered. Currently, the shift in media is often addressed by identifying potential revenue losses or threats to digital content owners. Digital Rights Management (DRM) standards are being developed, but the question remains: what problems are these systems trying to solve? Most DRM systems are modeled on copyright, using metaphors of piracy and authors' moral rights. The debate needs to expand beyond the boundaries of copyright. This examination takes a utilitarian approach, focusing on the functions of copyright law when embedded in the economics of analog media and the technologically determined features of the press. To consider copyright for the digital realm, we must also consider the nature of printed paper.

This paper is framed by the Western European experience of copyright, but by focusing on function rather than motivation, the results may be more widely applicable. Paper and analog mass reproduction technologies bind attribution to content, enabling referencing and attribution. Mass-produced analog content also has high levels of integrity due to the difficulty of altering analog content and its widespread distribution. This combination of technology and law enabled epistemological surety and literacy, as well as a functioning information market for the reward of authors. To avoid confusion between copyright (a legal regime) and the combination of law, economics, and technology at the dawn of the print age, I refer to the set of functions they create together as "copy accuracy."

After illuminating the utilitarian aspects of the copyright system, I propose a set of functional requirements corresponding to these functions. I then use these functional requirements to examine three digital rights management systems: Giovanni, the Content Scrambling System (CSS), and the Adobe E-book. The well-known tools that break CSS and Adobe E-book are also included in this discussion.

I conclude that while each of the DRM systems and the systems that defeat DRM have elements of the copyright system, none solve the set of problems that the copyright system solved for the dawn of the print age. I further argue that if information were entirely free, the information market might fail. "Copy accuracy" consists of the legal principles of the copyright system (circa 1710), the technologically deterministic elements of printing press technology, and the economics of mass-produced analog content, all embedded in print culture. I close by proposing a return to copy accuracy as a basis for DRM design.

## 2. Background and Motivation
Ownership systems for information are inherently social and political. Critics of digital rights management (DRM) systems have raised concerns about their democratic implications, including fair use, conflicts between property rights and speech rights, the dangers of anti-circumvention laws, and threats to privacy. Others have criticized the underlying economics of the extensions of copyright.

I do not trace the history of the trade-off between increasingly broad information protection and more specific definitions of fair use. Nor do I address the sources of intellectual property. The various ideological arguments over the theoretical economic models that underlie copyright are of tangential interest.

A critical and often ignored issue is that copyright is a legal regime embedded in a technological system, much like motor vehicle controls are embedded in an automobile. This copyright system (as opposed to copyright per se) includes technical, economic, and legal elements that serve more purposes than the law alone.

Given the fundamental technological constraints on the current debate, this work begins with a brief consideration of the nature of printing and paper. Readers are urged to examine the dominant primary sources for this work. Here, I argue for the conception of copyright as part of a larger technological and legal system, rather than a legal system alone, for copy accuracy.

In the second section, I argue that copy accuracy includes binding reputation to document, content integrity, document persistence, and intrinsically enabling availability and archiving. I then consider the new technological and economic system in which copyright is failing. The fourth section applies the assertions from Sections 2 and 3 to selected DRM systems. I conclude that while "free as in beer" may not be ideal for digital content markets, the current DRM designs are far from serving the functions of copy accuracy.

## 3. Copyright and Its Context
Copyright as a legal construct was created during a period of dramatic changes in the economics and technology of information, particularly after the diffusion of the movable type press. In this section, I focus on the three sets of changes—technical, legal, and economic—to extract the critical functions that have made copyright successful.

Once the fundamental contours of copyright were established, the form proved so potent that it swept the globe along with the movable type press. Copyright has been significantly altered over the past 300 years. To avoid debates on the legitimacy, wisdom, or efficacy of incremental changes, I focus on the moment of creation in 1710, when the technology of mass-produced analog content had passed the point of incubation and been widely diffused.

I argue implicitly (by method) and explicitly that a new approach is needed, one that performs the critically important functions of copy accuracy but in the fundamentally new information market.

### 3.1 Technical
Technological change has long been the driver for alterations in copyright. In fact, technological change is the basis for the creation of copyright. As a class of policies, information property is a product of the industrial revolution. Previously, all information belonged to the Crown or Church, with rare authors receiving some ownership. The ability for individual, tradable ownership of authorship and information rights was hotly contested and explicitly part of the debates and revolutions that raged across Europe in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Individual ownership of ideas is in direct opposition to the absolute state.

Before the invention of the press, authoring was simple compared to copying. Copying enabled the survival of information from the Sumerians through the Roman and Byzantine empires, Arab universities, and finally to Europe. To copy a work was not theft but the only way to save a manuscript. Without laborious copying, any authored document would be lost. Each book copied consisted of a set of articles selected by the copier. To copy was to edit, in that modern editing involves the selection and ordering of material for inclusion.

Copyright was created at a moment of great discontinuity. Before the printing press, content was very expensive to produce and even more expensive to distribute. Effectively, there was no distribution, except for occasional loans for copying. Before the printing press, to copy was to preserve. Every document was unique in the content between the covers. To fail to copy a document was to resign it to decay and loss.

The printing press enabled mass creation and necessitated distribution. Distribution and reproduction were intimately related in the nature of duplication via the printing press. Like Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) today, the printing press changed the economics and politics of information in early modern Europe. Any literate middle-class person could author and publish a leaflet and have it distributed across London, Paris, or Berlin. The nobility decried the opinionated chatter of the merchant classes to no avail. After the defeat of the Royalists in England, those who controlled the equipment for data reproduction no longer had exclusive rights. Competition reigned, and control of content was also lost.

Before the press, media was relatively expensive, isolated copies meant ease of loss, and isolated handwritten copies could be altered more easily than printed, widely archived copies. The expense of making multiple copies made archiving knowledge difficult, and the nature of hand-selected copies resulted in difficulty in referencing and validation. Every copy was less accurate than the original, as scribal drift created a centuries-long decay of content, not unlike the modern parlor game of telephone.

Even the most basic ordering—alphabetical order—was not standard in Europe before the printing press. "Amo comes before bibo because a is the first letter of the former and b is the first letter of the latter, and a comes before b….by the Grace of God working in me, I have devised this order." To copy was to be the agent of the author, serving the author’s greatest interest. Not to copy was to resign the author’s words to certain destruction. Only after the printing press was invented was there a conflict between copier and author.

Printing creates multiple identical copies. Once distributed, making changes in every copy is extremely difficult. Additionally, the physical nature of paper makes changing each individual copy difficult to detect. To make a convincing change, it would be necessary to locate multiple (perhaps most) copies and alter them in an identical manner. Increased distribution increases surety. For example, to create reliable timestamps, hash trees are intermittently published in the New York Times. As the New York Times is widely archived, it would be inconceivably difficult to alter all copies.
