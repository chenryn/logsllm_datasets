ABSTRACT 
Copyright  is  a  legal  system  embedded  in  a  larger  technological 
system.    In  order  to  examine  the  functions  of  copyright  it  is 
critical to examine the larger technological context of copyright: 
analog  media  and  printed  paper  in  particular.    The  copyright 
system includes both the explicit mechanisms implemented by law 
and  the  implicit  mechanisms  resulting  from  the  technologically 
determinant  features  of  paper  and  print.    In  order  to  prevent 
confusion between the legal, technical, and economic elements I 
refer to the whole as “copy accurate”.   
Digital rights management design should explicitly address legal 
issue  in  copyright  and  economics  of  paper,  technology  of  mass 
produced analog media, and print culture.  An examination of that 
entire system (copy accurate) yields a return to first principles for 
the design of digital rights management systems.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
In  a  world  where  paper  is  no  longer  the  medium  copyright  no 
longer  protects  the  message.    Changes  in  that  medium  to  other 
analog media – wax recordings, vinyl recordings, magnetic analog 
tape  recordings  -  have  been  by  gradual  extensions  of  copyright.  
Yet  digital  media  are  different  in  a  fundamental  manner  –  a 
change in kind as opposed to a change in degree. 
 In  designing  systems  to  implement  copyright  in  the  digital  age, 
that change in medium should be taken in account.  Currently the 
change  in  media  is  taken  into  account  when  those  things  either 
potentially lost or inherently threatened are identified as revenue 
schemes for digital content owner [1].   
Digital  Rights  Management  standards  are  being  developed  for 
digital content.  Yet the question remains, what problems are the 
systems trying to solve? Most systems are explicitly modeled on 
copyright;  those  that  use  the  metaphors  of  piracy  and  author's 
moral  rights  to  define or defend the design goals depend on the 
underlying  philosophical  support  of  copyright.  [2],  [3],  [4]  The 
debate  needs  to  be  expanded  beyond  the  borders  of  copyright.  
Thus  this  examination  is  a  utilitarian  one,  with  a  focus  on  the 
functions  of  copyright  law  when  embedded  in  the  economics  of 
analog  media  and  based  on  the  technologically  determined 
features of the press.  To consider copyright for the digital right 
requires considering the nature of printed paper.   
This  paper  is  framed  by  the  Western  European  experience  of 
copyright; yet by focusing on function rather than motivation the 
results may be more widely useful.   
Paper and analog mass reproduction technologies bind attribution 
to  content,  thus  enabling  referencing  and  attribution.    Mass-
produced analog content also has high levels of integrity not only 
because  of  the  difficulty  of  altering  analog  content  but  also 
because  of  the  widespread  distribution.    This  combination  of 
technology  and  law  enabled  epistemological  surety  and  literacy, 
as  well  as  a  functioning  information  market  for  the  reward  of 
authors.  In order to prevent confusion between copyright (a legal 
regime) and the combination of law, economics and technology at 
the dawn of the print age I refer to the set of functions the three 
create together as copy accuracy. 
After illuminating the utilitarian aspects of the copyright system, I 
propose  a  set  of  functional  requirements  corresponding  to  these 
functions.  I then use these function requirements to examine three 
digital  rights  management  systems:  Giovanni, 
the  Content 
Scrambling  System,  and  the  Adobe  E-book.    The  well-known 
tools that break both CSS and Adobe E-book are also included in 
this discussion.   
78I conclude that while each of the DRM systems and the systems 
that  defeat  DRM  has  elements  of  the  copyright  system,  none 
solves  the  set  of  problems  the  copyright  system  solved  for  the 
dawn  of  the  print age.  I further argue that were information all 
free, the information market might fail.  “Copy accuracy” consists 
of  the  legal  principles  of  the  copyright  system  in  (1710),  the 
technologically  deterministic 
elements  of  printing  press 
technology, the economics of mass-produced analog content all of 
which  are  embedded  in  print  culture.    I  close  by  proposing  a 
return to copy accuracy as a basis for DRM design. 
2.  BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION 
Ownership  systems  for  information  are  inherently  social  and 
political.  [5]    Critics  of  digital  rights  management  systems 
copyright have been concerned with the democratic implications 
of  DRM  Democratic  concerns  include  fair  use  [1],  conflict 
between property rights and speech rights [6], [7], [8], the dangers 
of  anti-circumvention  laws  [9],  [10],  and  the  threat  to  privacy 
[11].    Others  have  criticized  the  underlying  economics  of  the 
extensions of copyright.  [12], [13], [14]   
I also do not trace the history of the trade-off between ever more 
broad information protection and ever more specific definitions of 
fair  use.    [15].    Nor  am  I  addressing  the  sources  of  intellectual 
property  [16].    The  various  ideological  arguments  over  the 
theoretical  economic  models  that  underlie  copyright  are  of 
tangential interest [8].   
A  critical  issue  and  ignored  issue  is  that  copyright is and was a 
legal regime embedded in a technological system, just as deeply 
as  motor  vehicle  controls  embed 
the 
automobile.  This copyright system (as opposed to copyright per 
se) includes technical, economic, and legal elements that together 
serve more purposes than the law alone serves. 
Given  the  fundamental  technological  blinkers  on  the  current 
debate, this work begins with an extremely brief consideration of 
the  nature  of  printing and paper.  Readers are urged to examine 
the dominant primary sources for this work [17], [18], [19].  Here 
I  argue  for  the  conception  of  copyright  as  part  of  a  larger 
technological and legal system, rather than a legal system alone, 
for copy accuracy. 
In the second section I argue that copy accuracy includes binding 
of 
integrity,  document 
persistence,  intrinsically  enabling  availability  and  archiving.    I 
then  consider  the  new  technological  and  economic  system  in 
which copyright is failing..  The fourth section is concerned with 
applications  of  the  assertions  in  Section  2  and  Section  3  on 
selected DRM systems.  I conclude that while free as in beer may 
not be ideal for digital content markets, the current DRM designs 
are far from serving the functions of copy accuracy.

3.  COPYRIGHT AND ITS CONTEXT 
Copyright as a legal construct was created at a time of dramatic 
changes  in  the  economics  and  technology  of  information.    In 
particular copyright was created after the diffusion of the movable 
type  press.    In  this  section  I  focus  on  the  three  sets  of  changes 
technical, legal and economic.  I do so in order extract from the 
technical  and  economic  discontinuity  the  critical  functions  that 
have made copyright successful.   
Once the fundamental contours of copyright had been sculpted the 
form  proved  so  potent  as  to  sweep  the  globe,  along  with  the 
movable type press. 
Copyright has been altered significantly in the past 300 years.  In 
order to avoid the debates on the legitimacy, wisdom or efficacy 
of  the  incremental  changes  I  focus  on  the  moment  on  creation: 
(1710).    At  that  time  the  technology  of  mass-produced  analog 
content  had  passed  the  point  of  incubation  and  been  widely 
diffused.   
I argue implicitly (by method) and explicitly that a new approach 
is  needed,  one  which  performs  the critically important functions 
of  copy  accuracy  but  in  the  fundamentally  new  information 
market. 
3.1  Technical 
Technological  change  has  long  been  the  driver  for  alteration  of 
copyright.  In fact, technological change is the basis of creation of 
copyright.    As  a  class  of  policies,  information  property  is  the 
creation  of  the  industrial  revolution.    Previously  all  information 
belonged  to  Crown  or  Church,  with  the  rare  author  receiving 
some  ownership.  [20]    The  ability  for  individual  tradable 
ownership  of  authorship  and  information  rights  were  hotly 
contested and explicitly part of the debates and revolutions which 
raged  across  Europe  in  the  eighteenth  and  nineteenth  century.  
Individual  ownership  of  ideas  is  in  direct  opposition  to  the 
absolute state. 
Before the invention of the press, authoring was simple compared 
to copying.  Copying enabled the survival of information from the 
Summarians, through the Roman and Byzantine empires, through 
Arab universities and finally to Europe.  To copy a work was in 
no  way  theft  but  rather  the  only  way  to  save  a  manuscript.  
Without laborious copying any authored document would be lost.  
Each  book  copied  consisted  of  a  set  of  articles  selected  by  the 
copier.    To  copy  was  to  edit,  in  that  modern  editing  is  the 
selection and ordering of material for inclusion.  [17], [21] 
Copyright  was  created  a  moment  of  great  discontinuity.    Before 
the  printing  press,  content  was  very  expensive  to  produce  and 
even  more  expensive  to  distribute.    Effectively  there  was  no 
distribution, excluding the occasion loan for copying.  Before the 
printing  press,  to  copy  was  to  preserve.    Every  document  was 
unique  in  the  content  between  the  covers.    To  fail  to  copy  a 
document was to resign it to decay and loss. 
The  printing  press  enabled  mass  creation  and  necessitated 
distribution.    Distribution  and  reproduction  were  intimately 
related in the nature of duplication via printing press. 
Like  ICTs  today,  the  printing  press  changed  the  economics  and 
politics  of  information  in  early  modern  Europe.    Any  literate 
middle-class person could author and publish a leaflet and have it 
distributed across London, Paris, or Berlin.  The nobility decried 
the opinionated chatter of the merchant classes to no avail.  After 
the defeat of the Royalists in England, those who controlled the 
equipment  for  data  reproduction  no  longer  had  exclusive  rights.  
Competition reigned the control of content was also lost.  [22]  
Before  the  press  the  media  was  relatively  expensive,  isolated 
copies meant ease of loss, and isolated handwritten copies could 
be altered more easily than printed widely archived copies.  The 
expense  of  making  multiple  copies  made  archiving  knowledge 
difficult,  and  the  nature  of  hand  selected  copies  resulted  in 
difficulty in referencing and validation.  Every copy was less than 
79timestamps 
[23] 
the  outputs  of  hash 
the  original  as  scribal  drift  created  a  centuries-long  decay  of 
content not unlike the modern parlor game of telephone. 
Even  that  most  basic  ordering  –  alphabetical  order  –  was  in  no 
way  standard in Europe before the printing press.  “Amo comes 
before bibo because a is the first letter of the former and b is the 
first letter of the latter and a comes before b ….by the Grace of 
God working in me, I have devised this order.” [17]  To copy was 
to  be  the  agent  of  the  author,  to  serve  the  author’s  greatest 
interest.  Not to copy was to resign the authors’ words to certain 
destruction.  Only after the printing press was invented was there 
a conflict between copier and author. 
Printing  creates  multiple  identical  copies.    Once  distributed 
making changes in every copy is extremely difficult.  In addition 
the physical nature of paper makes changing each individual copy 
difficult  to  change.    In  the  parlance  of  computer  security  paper 
presents a high work factor to change in a manner that is difficult 
to  detect.    In  order  to  make  a  convincing  change  it  would 
necessary to locate multiple (perhaps most) copies and alter them 
in an identical manner.   
Increased  distribution  increases  surety.    For  example,  to  create 
reliable 
trees  are 
intermittently  published  in  the  NY  Times.    As  the  NY  Times  is 
widely  archived,  it  would  be  inconceivably  difficult  to  alter  all
