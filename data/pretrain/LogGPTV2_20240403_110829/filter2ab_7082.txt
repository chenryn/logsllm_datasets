titleblackhat:us-21 Internal Affairs: Hacking File System Access from the Web
The File System Access API deployed to browsers this year is the current version of a W3C draft to give websites, with user approval, the ability to read, write, and edit files and folders the user selects on their devices, an outgrowth of an earlier proposal called Native File System. It has been released and deployed in many Chromium-based browsers. Despite a number of security features implemented in the API, this presentation will show several ways in which a hostile website may gain arbitrary code execution and slip malicious code past operating system and security product scans, or even detailed, manual inspection.
