Table 6: Hour-long high loss periods, by routing method. Much of the beneﬁt from reactive routing comes from avoiding longer
periods of high loss, and mesh routing successfully improves losses when the overall loss rate is low. There were an equal number of
total sampling periods for each method.

Table 5: One-way loss percentages. Items marked with an as-
terisk were inferred from the ﬁrst packet of a two-packet pair.
1lp and 2lp are the percent chances of losing the ﬁrst and sec-
ond packets. Totlp is the chance of losing both. Clp is the con-
ditional loss probability percentage for the second packet. Lat
is the average one-way latency in milliseconds. The 2002 direct
direct data was extracted from the Rwide dataset, and lacks
comparable one-way loss and latency data.
For these periods of more serious loss, Table 6 examines the distri-
bution of loss rates over one-hour windows.2 Comparing the loss
and direct rand rows in the table shows that mesh based routing is
much more effective at reducing small amounts of loss, but as the
loss rate grows more serious, probe-based methods begin to equal
or outperform meshing.
4.4 Conditional loss probabilities
In the Rwide and R2003 datasets, we examined a wider
number of probe types,
including back-to-back direct packets.
Bolot [7] examined packets separated by 8 ms, and found that their
conditional loss probability was 60%. Paxson [26] examined TCP
packets that queued together at a router, ﬁnding their conditional
loss probability to be about 50%.
In our experiments, back-to-
back packets had a higher conditional loss probability—72.7% in
2002 and 72.15% in 2003—probably because we sent them with
no intervening delay. The conditional loss probability of a packet
sent through a random intermediate node was only 50% in 2002
and 62% in 2003. Taken relative to two direct packets, this in-
dicates an appreciable difference in conditional loss probabilities
when traversing an intermediate host, but these ﬁgures are more
understandable when we consider the conditional loss probabilities
of delayed packets. With a 10-ms delay, we observe a 66% condi-
tional loss probability, similar to Bolot’s 60%, which bridges half
of the gap between back-to-back packets and those sent through an
intermediate node.
Figure 4 shows the cumulative distribution of conditional loss prob-
abilities across hosts, on the 115 paths on which we observed ﬁrst-
packet losses. With back-to-back packets, half of the hosts had a
100% conditional loss probability. This data suggests that redun-
dant routing on the same path is likely to fall prey to burst losses in
a way that multi-path avoids.3
The conditional loss probabilities of packets sent indirectly changed
considerably from our 2002 to 2003 datasets, but the CLP for back-
to-back packets on the same path was virtually identical. This sug-
gests that the back-to-back loss probabilities may be more a func-
tion of router behavior and queuing dynamics, and that the indirect
2We used one hour windows to ensure that we had sufﬁcient sam-
ples to detect the loss rate with ﬁne granularity.
3These numbers are derived from relatively few losses, so there are
likely excessive samples at 100% that should be in the 90s.

Latency (ms)
Figure 4: Cumulative distribution of conditional loss probabil-
ities for the second packet in a back-to-back packet transmis-
sion. Two back-to-back direct packets have a higher CLP than
two back-to-back packets where one is sent through a random
intermediate. The highest average loss rate for a direct path
was 4–6%; the conditional loss probabilities are much higher.
probabilities are more subject to variance based on changes in net-
work topology.
4.5 Effects on latency
Figure 5 shows the cumulative distribution of one-way latencies
in R2003 for paths whose latency is over 50 ms (30% of the
paths we measure). For paths with shorter latencies, the differences
between routing methods are mostly insigniﬁcant. Overall, the av-
erage direct Internet path latency is 54.13 ms. Latency optimized
routing reduces this by 11%, primarily by improving exceptionally
bad paths. Many of the largest latency improvements we observed
came from a period around 6 May 2003 when many of the paths to
the Cornell node experienced latencies of up to 1 second. This ex-
plains why the 2003 dataset shows more latency improvement than
the 2002 dataset, which was too short to observe many pathologies.
Interestingly, the improvement from mesh routing (2–3 ms over-
all) is mostly the same, regardless if the technique is used with or
without reactive routing. Like the loss optimization case, this sug-
gests that these two techniques improve latency by avoiding differ-
ent sources of delays. Overall, mesh routing also made improve-
ments to the pathological cases (Cornell and Korea), but the
beneﬁts were spread more evenly across a wider selection of paths.
4.6 Other combinations of methods
Rwide’s broader examination conﬁrmed that the three routing
methods upon which we focused—loss, direct rand, and lat loss—
are the most interesting. Some other methods had a few noteworthy
features, however. The loss probability for rand rand was as
low as direct rand, though its latency was far worse. The latency of
direct lat was better than any other method, by several milliseconds.
Table 7 shows the results of this more broad examination.
Figure 5: Cumulative distribution of packet one-way latencies
for higher-latency paths. Note that the CDF begins at 70%; the
remainder of the paths had latencies under 50 ms.

Implications
What do our results say about the design of improved routing
schemes? This section considers the cost, theoretical beneﬁts, and
realized beneﬁts from these schemes to understand the trade-offs
involved in their use.
Applications using improved routing schemes have certain require-
ments from the network, much like a service level agreement: a
certain average loss rate, average latency, maximum latency, and
