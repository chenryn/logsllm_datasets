User: How to install and run a Docker container on a new cloud computing virtual machine?
Assistant: The steps to install and run a Docker container are as follows: 1. Install Docker on a new cloud computing virtual machine. The specific installation method can be different according to the operating system of the virtual machine. For example, Debian or Ubuntu users can install with the following command: ``` sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install docker.io ``` Centos or Fedora users can install with the following command: ``` sudo yum update sudo yum install docker ``` 2. Start the Docker service after the installation is complete: ``` sudo systemctl start docker ``` 3. Confirm that Docker has been successfully run: ``` sudo docker run hello-world ``` If all goes well, run the command line Details about the Docker hello-world will appear. 4. Get the Docker image you want to run, and start the container with the following command: ``` docker run <image name> ``` For example, to start an official Nginx image named nginx, you can enter the following command: ``` docker run nginx ``` 5. View the output from the container: ``` docker attach <container id> ``` If you need to exit, use CTRL-P CTRL-Q instead of CTRL-C directly Force quit. 6. Stop the container: ``` docker stop <container id> ``` 7. Remove the container: ``` docker rm <container id> ``` The container must be in the stopped state to be removed. If you want to remove the container along with its data volume, add the -v parameter: ``` docker rm -v <container id> ``` By following these steps to install and run Docker containers, you have A basic Docker environment has been successfully configured on the cloud computing virtual machine, through which containers can be deployed and managed quickly and efficiently.
