### Monitoring and Security of Public Water Systems

#### 1. Contaminant Permeation
- **Contamination Requirement**: The amount of contaminant required to permeate the entire source water system, after accounting for dilution, would either be too large to handle or far more expensive than other terrorist weapons.

#### 2. Water Treatment Plant
- **Typical Process**:
  - Source water
  - Intake and raw water pumps
  - Raw water well
  - Coagulation
  - Flocculation
  - Chemical addition
  - Filtration
  - Chlorination
  - Clearwell and finished water pumps
  - Distribution system
- **Monitoring and Control**: 
  - Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems
  - Instrumentation: flow meters, chemical addition pumps, variable frequency pumps, and chemical sensors
  - Security: Buildings are typically alarmed and fenced, though some plants, like one in Florida, do not have buildings.
  - **Vulnerability**: The clearwell is the most vulnerable point as it directly feeds into the distribution system. However, dilution would occur as contaminated water passes through the distribution system.

#### 3. Finished Water Storage
- **Types of Storage**:
  - Tanks (steel, concrete)
  - Reservoirs (covered, uncovered)
- **Security Measures**:
  - Fences, locks, video cameras, and alarms (implemented since 9/11)
  - Telemetry to monitor water levels, connected to SCADA via phone, radio, or internet
- **Vulnerability**: Post-treatment storage is highly vulnerable, but dilution would require massive amounts of toxins, making it difficult to contaminate effectively.

#### 4. Water Distribution System
- **Components**:
  - Distribution mains (4” – 24” diameter, materials: iron, ductile iron, plastic, prestressed concrete, asbestos cement)
  - Transmission mains (12” – 30” diameter)
  - Fire hydrants
  - Valves and gates
  - Blow-offs
- **Statistics**:
  - 1.8 million miles of water pipes in the US
  - 6-12 million fire hydrants in the US
- **Vulnerabilities**:
  - Contaminants can be introduced via hydrants or end-user homes using pressure tanks.
  - Hydrants can be locked, which may impede fire protection and provide a false sense of security.
  - Backflow prevention devices (BFPD) can protect buildings unless bypassed.
  - Some systems have remote monitoring of water quality, especially chlorine residual.
  - The distribution system is the most vulnerable component of the water system.

#### 5. Water Commissioners' Day-to-Day Problems
- **Common Issues**:
  - Water main breaks
  - Discolored water
  - Unpaid water bills
  - Aging infrastructure
  - Maintenance
  - New regulations
  - Vandalism
  - Funding
- **Terrorism**: Not a top priority, often not even in the top ten concerns.

#### 6. SCADA - System Operation
- **Overview**:
  - Upgraded from electro-mechanical process control to SCADA
  - Central control via Windows XP or Server 2003
  - Input from Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) in plants and remote facilities
  - Connected through Ethernet wire, routers, and switches
  - Internet connectivity for remote sites (pump stations, wells, tanks)

#### 7. SCADA: Vulnerabilities
- **Survey Results**:
  - 76% of respondents with SCADA/ICS responsibilities reported their networks were connected to an IP network or the internet.
  - 47% admitted this connection created unresolved security issues.
- **Threats**:
  - SCADA ports are being scanned globally.
  - Test bed studies show external attackers can penetrate and disable systems.
  - A Chinese researcher detailed how an attack on the US power grid could cause cascading failures.

#### 8. SCADA Cybersecurity Incidents
- **Increasing Incidents**:
  - Majority of cybersecurity incidents in critical infrastructure.
  - Water/wastewater incidents increased by 367%.
  - 22% are targeted attacks, with the rest mostly malware.
  - Severe cyber attacks have caused multi-city power outages outside the US.
  - The US electric grid has been repeatedly penetrated.

#### 9. W32.Stuxnet - First SCADA-Specific Malware
- **Characteristics**:
  - Exploits hard-coded default passwords and Windows .Lnk files.
  - Propagates via USB flash drives and possibly network shares.
  - Targets Siemens’ SIMATIC WinCC and PCS7 SCADA software.
  - Used in drinking water treatment plants, electrical, and manufacturing.
  - Extracts process data, HMI screens, and gives attacker control over the system.
  - Hit thousands of computers worldwide.
  - Siemens distributed Sysclean from TrendMicro to detect and clean the malware.

#### 10. Potential Impacts of a Cyber Attack on Public Water System SCADA
- **Possible Consequences**:
  - Interference with operations
  - Unauthorized changes to programmed instructions
  - Blocking of data
  - Sending false information
  - Changing alarm thresholds
  - Preventing access to account information

#### 11. Extent of Cyber and Kinetic Risk to Public Water Systems
- **Summary**:
  - Too big and too exposed to protect 100%.
  - Fragmentation limits the effects of any attack to a single system.
  - Many redundancies, but some single points of failure.
  - National shortfall of $350 billion for infrastructure improvements.
  - Frequent unintentional contamination, but few intentional due to difficulty.
  - More concern about bombs than cyber attacks, but cannot rule out cyber attacks.
  - Most incidents are from vandalism, not terrorism.

#### 12. Protection Efforts for Public Drinking Water Systems
- **Initiatives**:
  - Bioterrorism Act of 2002
  - Vulnerability Assessments
  - Homeland Security grant programs
  - Water Infrastructure Security Enhancements (WISE) Program
  - Water Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC)
  - Infragard
  - Open SCADA Security Project
  - SCADA Honeypot
  - SCADA Testbeds
  - SANS
  - Cyber Shockwave

#### 13. Further Actions Needed
- **Funding**:
  - At least $1 - $1.6 billion needed for security improvements.
  - Real-time monitoring of water in the distribution system.
- **Standards and Practices**:
  - EPA-required federal standards for readiness, response, and recovery.
  - Incorporate “21 Steps to Improve Cyber Security of SCADA Networks.”
- **Regulatory Authority**:
  - Homeland Security Department needs authority to enforce protection, more staff, and continuity of leadership.

#### 14. Conclusions
- **Public Water Systems**:
  - Attractive targets for attack.
  - Terrorists have and will continue to threaten US public water supplies.
  - Terrorists have cyber capabilities and use the internet.
  - There have been cyber attacks on water systems and many incidents on SCADA in critical infrastructure.
  - Concentration of chlorine production is a strategic vulnerability.
  - SCADA systems have numerous vulnerabilities.
  - A kinetic and/or cyber attack can shut down or alter water quality.
  - The distribution system is the most vulnerable and difficult to defend.
  - Progress has been made, but more than $1 billion is needed for security upgrades and federal authority.
  - A cyber terrorist attack does not appear imminent but cannot be ruled out in the future.
