monitored 
•
“The amount of contaminant required to permeate the 
whole [source water] system would, after taking dilution 
into account, either be too large to handle…or far more 
expensive than other terrorist weapons.” 
17 
Water Treatment Plant 
•
Typical water treatment process: 
-
From source water 
-
Intake, raw water pumps 
-
Raw water well 
-
Coagulation 
-
Flocculation 
-
Chemical addition 
-
Filtration 
-
Chlorination 
-
Clearwell, finished water pumps 
-
To distribution system 
•
Monitored and controlled by SCADA 
•
Instrumentation includes flow meters, 
chemical addition pumps, variable 
frequency pumps, chemical sensors 
•
Usually in buildings, alarmed, with fencing  - 
except for this plant in Florida, no building! 
•
Each plant is unique 
•
Clearwell is most vulnerable spot; water 
goes directly into the distribution system, so 
this is the most vulnerable point in 
treatment.  
•
However, dilution would occur as the slug of 
contaminated water passed through the 
distribution system 
18 
Finished Water Storage 
• Types of water storage: 
- tanks (steel, concrete) 
- reservoirs (covered, uncovered) 
• Remote facilities 
• Since 9/11, most have fences, locks, 
video cameras, alarms 
• Since its after treatment, one of 
most vulnerable points 
• Dilution factor still would require 
massive amounts of toxin, dropped 
in from top of tank, difficult 
• Instrumentation- telemetry to 
monitor height of water in tank, 
connected to SCADA by phone, 
radio, or internet 
19 
Water Distribution System 
•
Distribution system includes: 
-
distribution mains (4” – 24” diameter, iron, ductile 
iron, plastic, prestressed concrete, asbestos 
cement) 
-
transmission mains (12” – 30” diameter) 
-
fire hydrants 
-
valves & gates 
-
blow offs 
•
1.8 million miles of water pipes in the US 
•
6 - 12 million Fire Hydrants in US (best estimate) 
•
Contaminants could be pumped into hydrants, or from 
end user homes or hydrants,  via pressure tanks for 
lawn chemicals; cost only 80 cents per lethal dose; best 
for targeted attack 
•
Various ways to lock hydrants, could impede fire 
protection response, give false sense of security. 
•
Install check valve to block input into the hydrant 
•
Backflow prevention devices (BFPD) in building can 
protect them, unless the BFPD is bypassed 
•
Instrumentation: some have remote monitoring of 
water quality, especially chlorine residual 
•
Most vulnerable component of water system 
20 
Water Commissioners 
day to day problems 
• Water main breaks 
• Discolored water 
• Unpaid water bills 
• Aging infrastructure 
• Maintenance 
• New regulations 
• Vandalism 
• Getting more money 
• …. terrorism is not even 
in the top ten! 
21 
SCADA - System Operation 
•
In my system we upgraded a few 
years ago from the old-fashioned 
electro-mechanical process 
control system to SCADA 
•
Supervisory Control And Data 
Acquisition 
•
Central control is usually from a 
Windows XP or Server 2003 box 
•
Takes input from PLCs in plants & 
remote facilities 
•
Usually connected through off the 
shelf Ethernet wire, routers, 
switches, etc. 
•
Usually has some internet 
connectivity for the SCADA 
network, to remote sites like 
pump stations, wells, tanks 
22 
SCADA: Vulnerabilities 
• 76% of respondents with 
SCADA/ICS responsibilities said 
their networks were “connected 
to an IP network or the Internet.”  
• 47% admitted that the 
connection created an 
“unresolved security issue.” 
• SCADA ports are being scanned 
from all over the world – why? 
• Test bed studies show that 
external attackers can penetrate 
systems, brick the box, etc. 
• Chinese researcher has detailed 
how attack on US power grid 
could cause cascading failure to 
shut entire grid down! 
23 
SCADA cybersecurity incidents 
• Cybersecurity SCADA 
incidents are increasing 
• Majority of cybersecurity 
incidents occur in critical 
infrastructure 
• Water/wastewater 
incidents increased 367% 
• 22% are targeted attacks, 
rest are mostly malware 
• Cyber attacks sometimes 
severe – caused multi-city 
power outages outside US 
• US electric grid known to 
be repeatedly penetrated 
24 
The first SCADA-specific malware 
•
W32.Stuxnet 
•
Exploits hard coded default password 
•
Exploits Windows .Lnk files 
•
Propagates via USB flash drives, maybe 
network shares 
•
Targets are Siemens’ SIMATIC WinCC 
and PCS7 SCADA software 
•
Used in drinking water treatment 
plants, electrical, manufacturing, 
others 
•
Don’t know extent of potential 
exposure to drinking water systems 
•
Appears to be industrial espionage; 
malware extracts process data, maybe 
HMI screens, also gives attacker control 
over the system. 
•
Hit thousands of computers worldwide 
•
Siemens is distributing Sysclean, from 
TrendMicro, which detects and cleans 
the malware 
25 
Potential impacts of a cyber attack on 
a public water system SCADA 
• Interfere with operations 
• Make unauthorized 
changes to programmed 
instructions 
• Block data 
• Send false information 
• Change alarm thresholds 
• Prevent access to account 
information 
26 
What is the extent of the cyber & 
kinetic risk to public water systems? 
•
Bottom line: it is too big and too exposed to 
protect 100% 
•
Fragmentation limits effects of any attack to 
a single system; no cascade as in electric grid 
•
Has many redundancies, but there are some 
‘single points of failure’ 
•
Major $350B national shortfall in funds for 
improvements for the crumbling 
infrastructure 
•
There are frequent unintentional 
contamination of water systems, but few 
intentional, because of the difficulty 
•
I’d be more worried about bombs than cyber 
attacks, but can’t rule cyber attacks out 
•
While vulnerabilities exist, most incidents 
are from vandalism, not terrorism 
27 
What is being done to protect public 
drinking water systems? 
•
Bioterrorism Act of 2002 
•
Vulnerability Assessments 
•
Homeland Security grant 
programs 
•
Water Infrastructure Security 
Enhancements (WISE) Program 
•
Water Information Sharing and 
Analysis Center (ISAC) 
•
Infragard 
•
Open SCADA Security Project 
•
SCADA Honeypot 
•
SCADA Testbeds 
•
SANS 
•
Cyber Shockwave 
28 
What still needs to be done? 
•
At least $1 - $1.6 Billion is needed for 
public water systems to implement 
recommended security 
improvements.  
•
All water systems need funding to 
implement real-time monitoring of 
water in the distribution system. 
•
There must be EPA-required federal 
standards or agreed upon industry 
practices regarding readiness, 
response to incidents, or recovery, for 
public water systems. 
•
These standards should incorporate 
the “21 Steps to Improve Cyber 
Security of SCADA Networks” 
•
The Homeland Security Department 
branch that monitors cyber attacks 
needs the authority to force other 
agencies to protect their systems, 
needs more staff, and needs 
continuity of leadership. 
29 
Conclusions 
•
Public water systems are attractive targets of attack. 
•
Terrorist have, and can be expected to continue to, 
threaten to attack US public water supplies. 
•
Terrorists have cyber capability and use the internet. 
•
There have been cyber attacks on water systems, and 
many cyber incidents on SCADA on critical 
infrastructure. 
•
The concentration of chlorine production in the US is 
a strategic vulnerability affecting all public water 
systems. 
•
SCADA systems have numerous vulnerabilities. 
•
A kinetic and/or cyber attack on a water system 
SCADA system can shut it down or alter water quality. 
•
Distribution system is the most vulnerable 
component, relatively easy to attack and difficult to 
defend against. 
•
While progress has been made in hardening public 
water systems, more than $1 billion is needed to 
fund needed security upgrades and federal authority 
to require cyber and physical improvements needs to 
be established. 
•
A cyber terrorist attack on public water systems does 
not appear imminent, but cannot be ruled out in the 
future.
