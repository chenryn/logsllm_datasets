ABSTRACT
The  highly  successful  architecture  and  protocols  of  today’s
Internet may operate poorly in environments characterized by very
long delay paths and frequent network partitions.  These problems
are  exacerbated  by  end  nodes  with  limited  power  or  memory
resources.    Often  deployed  in  mobile  and  extreme  environments
lacking continuous connectivity,  many such networks have their
own  specialized    protocols,  and  do  not  utilize  IP.    To  achieve
interoperability between them, we propose a network architecture
and  application  interface  structured  around  optionally-reliable
asynchronous  message  forwarding,  with  limited  expectations  of
end-to-end  connectivity  and  node  resources.    The  architecture
operates as an overlay above the transport layers of the networks it
interconnects, and provides key services such as in-network data
storage  and  retransmission,  interoperable  naming,  authenticated
forwarding and a coarse-grained class of service.

1. INTRODUCTION
The  existing  TCP/IP  based  Internet  service  model  provides
end-to-end inter-process communication using a concatenation
of  potentially  dissimilar 
  The
standardization  of  the  IP  protocol  and  its  mapping  into
network-specific link-layer data frames at each router supports
interoperability  using  a  packet-switched  model  of  service.
Although  often  not  explicitly  stated,  a  number  of  key
assumptions  are  made  regarding  the  overall  performance
characteristics of the underlying links in order to achieve this
service:  an end-to-end path exists between a data source and
its  peer(s),  the  maximum  round-trip  time  between  any  node
pairs in the network is not excessive, and the end-to-end packet
drop probability is small.  Unfortunately, a class of challenged
networks, which may violate one or more of the assumptions,
are  becoming  important  and  may  not  be  well  served  by  the
current end-to-end TCP/IP model.  Examples include:
(cid:127)  Terrestrial  Mobile  Networks :    Some  of  these  networks  may
become  unexpectedly  partitioned  due  to  node  mobility  or
changes in signal strength (e.g. RF interference), while others
may  be  partitioned  in  a  periodic,  predictable  manner.    For
example,  a  commuter  bus  could  act  as  a  store  and  forward
message  switch  with  only  limited-range  RF  communication
capability.  As it travels from place to place, it provides a form
of  message  switching  service

communicate with distant parties it will visit in the future.

communications  with  light  propagation  delays  in  the  seconds
or minutes), acoustic links in air or water, and some free-space
optical  communications.    These  systems  may  be  subject  to
high  latencies  with  predictable  interruption  (e.g.  due  to
planetary  dynamics  or  the  passing  of  a  scheduled  ship),  may
suffer  outage  due  to  environmental  conditions  (e.g.  weather),
or  may  provide  a  predictably-available  store-and-forward
network  service  that  is  only  occasionally  available  (e.g.  low-
earth orbiting satellites that “pass” by periodically each day).
(cid:127)  Military  Ad-Hoc  Networks :    These  systems  may  operate  in
hostile environments where mobility, environmental factors, or
intentional  jamming  may  be  cause  for  disconnection.    In
addition, data traffic on these networks may have to compete
for  bandwidth  with  other  services  at  higher  priority.    As  an
example,  data  traffic  may  have  to  unexpectedly  wait  several
seconds or more while high-priority voice traffic is carried on
the  same  underlying  links.    Such  systems  also  may  also  have
especially strong infrastructure protection requirements.
(cid:127)  Sensor/Actuator  Networks :    These  networks  are  frequently
characterized by extremely limited end-node power, memory,
and CPU capability.  In addition, they are envisioned to exist
at  tremendous  scale,  with  possibly  thousands  or  millions  of
nodes  per  network.    Communication  within  these  networks  is
often  scheduled  to  conserve  power,  and  sets  of  nodes  are
frequently  named  (or  addressed)  only  in  aggregate.    They
typically employ “proxy” nodes to translate Internet protocols
to the sensor network native protocols.
Given  the  large  accumulated  experience  and  number  of
systems compatible with the TCP/IP protocols, it is natural to
apply  the  highly  successful  Internet  architectural  concepts  to
these  new  or  unusual  types  of  networks.    While  such  an
application is conceivable, the effects of very significant link
delay,  non-existence  of  end-to-end  routing  paths,  and  lack  of
continuous  power  or  large  memory  at  end  nodes  present
substantial operational and performance challenges to such an
approach.    In  some  cases,  unusually  large  bandwidth-delay
products  can  also  present  difficulties,  especially  when  high
bandwidth efficiency is required.
In  an  effort  to  adapt  Internet  to  unusual  environments,  one
class  of  approaches  attempts  to  engineer  problem  links  to
appear more similar to the types of links for which TCP/IP was
designed.  In  effect,  these  approaches,  which  we  term  link-
repair approaches, “fool” the Internet protocols into believing
they  are  operating  over  a  comparatively  well-performing
physical infrastructure.  They strive to maintain the end-to-end
reliability  and  fate  sharing  model  of  Internet,  and  generally
require the use of IP in all participating systems.
Another common approach to deal with challenged networks is
to attach them to only the edge of the Internet  by means of a
special  proxy  agent.    This  provides  access  to  and  from
challenged networks from the Internet, but does not provide a
general  way  to  use  such  networks  for  data  transit.    Without
supporting transit, the full capabilities of these networks may
go unrealized.  Indeed, supporting transit is often of particular
interest  because  remotely-deployed  conventional  networks
(e.g.  Intranets)  may  only  be  accessible  through  challenged
intermediate networks for economic reasons.
In  this  paper,  and  its  extended  version  [8],  we  argue  that  to
achieve 
interoperability  between  very  diverse  networks,
especially  those  engineered  for  extreme  environments  or  that
often suffer from network partitioning, link-repair approaches
alone  will  not  suffice  and  network-specific  proxies  are
undesirable.    Instead,  we  suggest  a  general  purpose  message-

“internetwork  of  challenged  internets.”    The  approach,  which
provides  the  service  semantics  of  asynchronous  message
delivery,  may  be  used  in  combination  with  TCP/IP  where
appropriate.    Its  design  is  influenced  by  the  interoperability
properties  of  the  classical  Internet  design,  the  robust  non-
interactive delivery semantics of electronic mail, and a subset
of  the  classes  of  service  provided  by  the  US  Postal  System.

2. CHALLENGED INTERNETS
Qualitatively,  challenged  internetworks  are  characterized  by
latency,  bandwidth 
limitations,  error  probability,  node
longevity, or path stability that are substantially worse than is
typical of today’s Internet.  We use the Internet’s performance
as  a  baseline  due  to  its  enormous  scale  and  influence.    This
section explores the path properties, network architectures and
end node resources found across the broad range of challenge
networks introduced above and how they influence the design
of a network architecture designed to accommodate them.
2.1 Path and Link Characteristics
High  Latency,  Low  Data  Rate:    If  we  temporarily  disregard
processing  and  queuing  delays  (we  return  to  queuing  delays
shortly), the transmission and propagation delays of a link are
directly affected by the underlying transmission medium.  For
some  challenged  networks,  transmission 
  rates  may  be
comparatively  small  (e.g.  about  10kbps  for  underwater
acoustic  modems  and  low-power  radios  in  sensor  nodes)  and
latencies  may  be  comparatively  large  (to  about  a  second  or
two).  Also, data rates may be largely asymmetric (e.g. remote
instruments  may  have  a  comparatively  high  rate  downlink
channel  for  relaying  telemetry  but  a  small  uplink  used  for
device  control).    In  some  extreme  cases,  no  return  channel  at
all  may  be  available  (e.g.  communication  with  some  military
assets requiring covert operation such as submarines).
Disconnection.    In  many  challenged  networks,  end-to-end
disconnection  may  be  more  common 
than  connection.
Generally speaking, disconnection may be broadly categorized
as due to a fault or not.  Faults have been studied extensively
for conventional networks, and will not be further considered
here.    Non-faulty  disconnections  arise  most  frequently  in
wireless  environments,  from  primarily  two  sources:    motion
and  low-duty-cycle  system  operation.    Disconnection  due  to
motion may be highly predictable  (e.g. satellite passes, busses
that  act  as  data  routers,  etc)  or  opportunistic  (nodes  arrive  in
communication range due to random walk) and may arise due
to motion of either end-nodes, routers, or some other object or
signal that obscures the communication.  Disconnection due to
low-duty-cycle  operation  is  common  among  low-capability
devices  (e.g.  sensor  networks),  and  is  often  predictable.
Exceptional  conditions  requiring  immediate  attention  (event
responses)  can  perturb  the  otherwise  periodic  low-duty-cycle
operation at unpredictable times.
Long  Queuing  Times.    For  multi-hop  paths  in  conventional
packet networks with statistical multiplexing, the queuing time
often  dominates  the  transmission  and  propagation  delays.
Queuing  time  rarely  exceeds  a  second  (and  is  typically  much
less) and packets are discarded at routers if next-hop neighbors
are  not  instantaneously  reachable.    In  contrast  for  networks
where disconnection may be common, the queuing time could
be  extremely  large  by  comparison  (hours,  perhaps  days).
Furthermore, source-initiated retransmission may be extremely
expensive  due 
transmission
opportunities.    Combined,  these  issues  suggest  that  messages
may  need  to  be  stored  for  potentially  long  periods  of  time  at
(message) routers.

2.2 Network Architectures
Interoperability Considerations  In most challenged networks,
the  network  “architectures”  consist  primarily  of  a  link  and
media-access  control  protocol,  and  are  not  designed  with
interoperability (or very large scale) in mind.  The reason for
this  is  that  in  many  cases,  merely  communicating  at  all  over
some links is still an active area for research, and the desire to
use such links in an internetwork has not yet become a primary
focus.  Thus, these networks tend to be comparatively simple
and  local  in  scope,  and  may  fail  to  provide  even  the  baseline
abstractions  that  are  well-matched  for  supporting  layered
protocol 
Implementations
frequently  “cut  corners”  when  targeted  for  deployment  on
memory and power-limited devices, mixing together data from
various  system  functional  blocks  into  messages  that  are
difficult  to  dis-aggregate.    They  also  frequently  fail  to
implement reliability, congestion control, and security.
Security.  In challenged networks where communication media
is  frequently  oversubscribed,  link  capacity  is  a  precious
resource and access to the “service” of data forwarding should
be  protected  by  some  authentication  and  access  control
mechanism,  at  least  at  critical  points  in  the  topology.    If
multiple  classes  of  service  (CoS)  are  available,  some
mechanism  to  control  access  to  them  is  also  likely  to  be
required.    In  such  cases,  an  approach  to  security  which  only
involves  the  endpoints  is  not  very  attractive,  stemming  from
two issues.  First, end-to-end-only approaches typically require
some  exchange  of  challenges  or  keys,  which  would  be
undesirable for high-delay and disconnection-prone networks.
Secondly, it is undesirable to carry unwanted traffic all the way
to  its  destination  before  an  authentication  and  access  control
