### Methodology for Analyzing and Testing Device Security

#### Specific Additions to Handle Additional I/O Needs
- **Specific Additions**: Recognize the need for specific additions, such as an ARM chip on a hard disk controller, to handle additional I/O requirements. This understanding will greatly assist in analyzing the security of the device, especially when you are unsure about the type of component running the software.

#### Software Attack: Taking Apart the Software
- **Tool of Choice**: IDA Pro is the preferred tool for most reverse engineers.
- **Importance of Chip Layout and I/O Peripheral Regions**: Knowing the chip's layout and I/O peripheral regions is crucial. IDA Pro will prompt you for this information if it recognizes the processor.
- **Demo**: You may need to write software to extract portions of the firmware before running it through IDA Pro. We are dealing with bare metal here, and some hardware developers are quite inventive, often using custom loader/linker formats that no one else uses.
- **Skill Level**: Your own reverse engineering skill level is essential in these situations.

#### Methodical Analysis of Hardware by Debug Interface
- **JTAG and Other Interfaces**: Use JTAG or other interfaces to enumerate interconnections on devices that are otherwise inaccessible (e.g., BGA/SMT with through-holes under components).
- **Switching IO Lines**: JTAG allows the switching of individual IO lines on and off.
- **Document Interconnections**: Build a document about relevant interconnections, such as:
  - Connections from the main processor unit (MPU) to a flash chip.
  - Connections from the MPU to a solid-state or switching relay.
  - Connections from the MPU to any sub-processors.
  - Connections from sub-processors to their controlled devices.
  - Bus interconnections for SPI/I2C/CAN/Single-Wire devices.

#### Identifying Major Modes of Operation
- **Basic Modes**:
  - Powered On
  - Standby
  - Powered Off

#### Identifying Major Functional Software Groups
- **Functional Groups**:
  - Hardware I/O routines
  - Main program logic
  - User interaction routines
  - Configuration routines
  - Encryption routines

#### Enumerate the Device’s Major Functional States
- **Device-Specific States**:
  - An encryption device might have states like:
    - Not Imprinted / Blank
    - Provisioned by corporate owner, ready for personalization
    - Personal Key generated, device in "secure mode," device Locked, not operating
    - Personal Key generated, device in "secure mode," device Unlocked and operating
    - Device Tampered
    - Device needs provisioning due to Certificate expiration
    - Device in Debug Mode
  - A simple device like a "fan on, fan off" device might have states like:
    - Get packet, turn fan on or off

#### Theory of Operation
- **Analysis**:
  - Now that we have a great deal of information, we can analyze it.
  - We know how the device operates, how it gets input and output, and have a rough idea of how it will respond to various stimuli.
- **Visualization**:
  - State transition and flow diagrams are helpful to visualize possible points of weakness.
  - Summary listing of software and hardware functions, including:
    - List of software methods and descriptions.
    - List of hardware "transactions" on a SPI Flash ROM.
    - Microchip diagram.

#### Test the Theory of Operation
- **Validation**:
  - Set up tests to validate your theory.
  - Test for confirmation of function.
  - If you see something unusual, that’s a good place to start looking for a weakness.
- **Breaking Stuff**:
  - Direct tests of tampering with information as it flows in and out of the device.
  - Altering I/O states on devices.
  - Changing the contents of flash devices or EEPROM.
  - Causing power state changes (brownout) to reset fuses or cause a portion of the device to reset while leaving the rest running.
  - Feeding bad network information into the device.
  - Using the TTL serial port to halt the processor and cause timeout states on I/O peripheral devices.
  - Changing device programming to do abnormal behaviors under certain conditions.
  - Attempting to extract keying material from the device.

#### Record the Results
- **Complexity**:
  - Taking apart hardware and software is complex.
  - Detailed recording of details as they are noticed will make final analysis much easier.
- **Documentation**:
  - The parts on the device.
  - The interconnection of major components.
  - The methods that the software uses to interact with these components.
  - A general theory of operation about the device.

#### Final Report
- **Professional Evaluation**:
  - If done professionally, include an executive summary, a list of tests performed, a list of vulnerabilities located, and appendices with all relevant details.
- **Celebration**:
  - If not, go have a beer! You’ve earned it!
