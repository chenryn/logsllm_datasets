### Electron Version
12.0.5
### What operating system are you using?
Other Linux
### Operating System Version
Arch Linux
### What arch are you using?
Other (specify below)
### Last Known Working Electron version
_No response_
### Expected Behavior
Electron shouldn't change the default behavior of apps, launched by electron
### Actual Behavior
All electron apps will start additional 3rd party apps in xwayland mode. This
results in a conflict for some of them. Like firefox, if firefox is already
launched and you press a link in an electron app, firefox will respond with a
message "Firefox is already running, but is not responding. To use Firefox,
you must first close the existing Firefox process, restart your device, or use
a different profile.", because firefox xwayland can not run inside a native
wayland firefox.
### Testcase Gist URL
_No response_
### Additional Information
Steps to reproduce:
  1. Be on a wayland session (with xwayland support, like GNOME; check with `echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE`)
  2. Launch firefox in wayland mode: `MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1 firefox` (could be default on your distro anyways, you can check after launch in _about:support_.)
  3. make sure that firefox is your default browser.
  4. Launch an Electron app
  5. Click a link in this electron app
