### System info
  * Playwright Version: [v1.32.0]
  * Operating System: [Windows 11]
  * Browser: [Chromium]
  * Other info:
### Source code
  * I provided exact source code that allows reproducing the issue locally.
I used a template with electron, vite and playwright set up. Running one test
passes no problems, but running multiple ones fails with this error ` Error:
electron.launch: Process failed to launch!`. I prepared a simple repo which
has the same test duplicated.  
Here is a test snippet:
    import { test, expect, _electron as electron } from "@playwright/test";
    test("homepage has title and links to intro page", async () => {
      const app = await electron.launch({ args: [".", "--no-sandbox"] });
      const page = await app.firstWindow();
      expect(await page.title()).toBe("Electron + Vite + React");
      await page.screenshot({ path: "e2e/screenshots/example.png" });
      await app.close();
    });

**Steps**

  * yarn e2e
**Expected**
All tests run and pass
**Actual**
A test is failing because of electron.launch()
