User: What is a proven method for installing pydotplus for Python 3.5 on a 64-bit Windows(10) system? So far I haven't had any luck using conda or a number of other approaches.
It appears there are several viable options for both Linux Ubuntu and Windows for Python 2.7. Unfortunately it's necessary for me to use this particular configuration, so any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!
Assistant: Try running anaconda prompt as 'administrator', then use:

conda install -c conda-forge pydotplus
