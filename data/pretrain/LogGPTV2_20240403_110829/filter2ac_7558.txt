titleblackhat:eu-21 They Hacked Thousands of Cloud Accounts Then Sent Us Weird GIFs
As organizations migrate their computing resources to cloud and container environments, attackers are taking notice -- and following. In August 2020, we discovered the first crypto-mining worm stealing AWS credentials. The attackers are now well known for their cloud-specific attacks. Recently, we discovered they had expanded their toolkit to both steal more credentials from compromised cloud systems and deploy some innovative techniques to exploit containerised Kubernetes systems and more cloud providers.In this session, we will discuss the cloud-specific nature of the real-world attacks we've seen, sharing insights and details that have not yet been published. We will walk attendees through the overall attack group operation and their most recent innovations to be on the lookout for. Finally, we will highlight the attack group's recent movements, operational security mistakes and provide a behind the scenes look at how they manage compromised cloud accounts.
