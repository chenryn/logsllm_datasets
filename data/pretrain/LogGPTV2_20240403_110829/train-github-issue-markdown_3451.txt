There seems to be a bug while using hessian in combination with spring
framework for remoting.  
Outputstream is not closed correctly, and part of the serialized output data
gets lost.
This does not occur while doing the same with hessian-only remoting, so this
should probably be resolved within spring.
The missing "close" method should be placed in:  
org.springframework.remoting.caucho.Hessian2SkeletonInvoker  
Close method on output stream needs to be applied after method:  
this.skeleton.invoke(in, out);
A test client & server is included for simulation. Batch file launches the
client, and war needs to be deployed in servlet engine running on 8080 (both
on 1 computer). All source code is located in the "SpringHessianIssue.jar"
file
