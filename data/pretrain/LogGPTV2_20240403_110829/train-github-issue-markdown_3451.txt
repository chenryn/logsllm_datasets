**Marieke Vandamme** opened **SPR-5046** and provided the following comments:

There appears to be a bug when using Hessian in conjunction with the Spring Framework for remoting. Specifically, the `OutputStream` is not being properly closed, resulting in the loss of part of the serialized output data.

This issue does not occur when using Hessian for remoting without Spring, suggesting that the problem likely resides within the Spring codebase. The missing `close` method should be added to the `org.springframework.remoting.caucho.Hessian2SkeletonInvoker` class, specifically after the invocation of `this.skeleton.invoke(in, out);`.

To facilitate testing, a sample client and server are included. The batch file can be used to launch the client, and the WAR file should be deployed on a servlet engine running on port 8080 (both components need to be on the same machine). All source code is contained within the "SpringHessianIssue.jar" file.
