The results indicate that the risk factors used in implementing risk-based access control models are significantly influenced by the context in which the model will be deployed. However, several risk factors can be applied across various contexts. An analysis of the risk factors used in the retrieved publications reveals that "Risk History" was the most dominant factor, appearing in 18 publications (Figure 7). This is expected, as any risk model should use past risk values to assess current and future access. Additionally, "Context" was a significant factor in 14 publications. Incorporating context into risk-based access control models customizes the model to specific applications and enhances its adaptability. "Resource Sensitivity" and "Trust" were adopted in 12 and 11 publications, respectively. 

In conclusion, selecting appropriate risk factors for a risk-based access control model depends on the application and environment where the model will be deployed, as well as the availability of data to calculate the overall security risk value for access decisions.

### RQ3: What are the risk estimation techniques employed in risk-based access control models?

A crucial step in implementing a risk-based access control model is the risk estimation process. This process involves estimating the likelihood of information leakage and the value of that information. The primary goal is to prioritize risks and use these values to make access decisions based on the specific context. Several challenges are associated with this process, such as forecasting the future likelihood of information leakage and its impact on system resources, which is not straightforward [60]. Inaccurate or incomplete information can complicate the identification of information value [31].

Selecting an appropriate risk estimation technique for building a risk-based access control model is challenging. It requires considering the availability of data describing risk likelihood and impact, as well as the need for precise quantitative risk values to determine access decisions. This section addresses the third research question by reviewing various risk estimation techniques used in the analyzed publications (Table 6).

One of the main challenges in implementing a reliable and effective risk-based access control model is determining a risk estimation technique that produces accurate and precise risk values. Due to the unavailability of datasets that describe risk likelihood and impact, 18 out of the retrieved papers did not include a clear risk estimation process.

Eight publications proposed mathematical equations based on relationships between input and output variables to estimate risk. However, these equations are highly dependent on specific variables and cannot be easily adapted to different environments. Seven publications used fuzzy logic systems for risk estimation, but this method is subjective and requires domain experts to define fuzzy variables and rules. Another seven publications utilized risk assessment to determine and prioritize risks, but this approach does not provide a numeric risk value suitable for making access decisions. A few publications discussed machine learning and game theory as risk estimation methods, but these are limited by the lack of necessary datasets for training and testing.

Providing a dataset that describes risk likelihood and impact in a specific context is a key issue in implementing risk-based access control models. We encourage researchers to build and share diverse datasets that can improve the performance and learning ability of current risk-based models. These datasets should provide quantitative values of risk likelihood and impact for various access control scenarios, along with specified risk factors.
