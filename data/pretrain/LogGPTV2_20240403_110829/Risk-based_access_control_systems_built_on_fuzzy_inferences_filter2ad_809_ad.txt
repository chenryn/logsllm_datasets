The results show that risk factors used to implement risk-based access control models are
signiﬁcantly based on the context where the risk-based access control model will be deployed.
However, several risk factors can be applied in various contexts. Reviewing risk factors used in
risk-based access control models of retrieved publications reveal that “Risk History” was the dominant
risk factor in most risk-based access control models in which it was adopted in 18 publications,
as depicted in Figure 7. This should be normal or expected, as any risk model would or should use
their previous risk values given to a user/subject to assess their current and future access. In addition,
the context was one of the signiﬁcant risk factors used in 14 publications. Using the context as a risk
factor in risk-based access control models customizes the risk model to a speciﬁc application and adds
the ﬂexibility needed for these access control models to be able to adapt to their environment. Resource
sensitivity and trust were adopted in 12 and 11 risk-based models, respectively. As a conclusion,
determining the appropriate risk factors for building a risk-based access control model is signiﬁcantly
based on the application and environment where this model will be deployed. It also depends on the
availability of data for such a risk factor to be able to use it to calculate the overall security risk value
associated with the access request to determine the access decision.

RQ3: What are risk estimation techniques employed in risk-based access control models?
The vital stage of implementing a risk-based access control model is the risk estimation process.
This process is based on estimating the likelihood of information leakage and the value of that

information. The main purpose of the risk estimation process is to build a method to arrange risks
based on their priorities and use risk values to make access decisions following a speciﬁc context.
There are several challenges associated with the risk estimation process. For example, the key
purpose of the risk estimation process is to forecast the future likelihood of information leakage and
the impact of such leakage on system resources. Deﬁning such a likelihood is not an easy job [60].
Moreover, if the risk estimation process is based on imprecise or incomplete information, it will result
in complications and problems to identify the value of information [31].
Determining the suitable risk estimation technique for building a risk-based access control models
is not an easy task, as there are many things that should be taken into consideration: for instance, the
availability of data that describe the risk likelihood and its impact. In addition, in the access control
context, the security risk value will be used to determine the access decision whether granting or
denying access, which requires having a precise and accurate quantitative/numeric risk value.
This section answers the third research question by investigating and reviewing various risk
estimation techniques utilized in risk-based access control models of retrieved/analyzed publications,
as shown in Table 6.
As discussed earlier, one of the challenges of implementing a reliable and eﬀective risk-based
access control model is to determine the risk estimation technique that produces accurate and precise
risk values to determine the access decision. However, due to the unavailability of datasets that
describe risk likelihood and its impact, most publications did not discuss a clear method to assess the
security risks of each access request. This reﬂected on having 18 publications from retrieved papers
without a risk estimation process.
On the other hand, there are 8 publications that proposed a mathematical equation based on
relationships between input and output variables to estimate the risk. However, these mathematical
equations are variable dependent and cannot be adopted in diﬀerent environments. In the same way,
there are 7 publications that proposed the fuzzy logic system for the risk estimation process. However,
the major issue in that method is the subjectivity and the need for domain experts to deﬁne fuzzy
variables and build fuzzy rules. In addition, there are 7 publications that utilized the risk assessment
to determine risks and assign them priorities. However, the risk assessment itself cannot provide a
numeric risk value that can be used to make the access decision. For the machine learning and game
theory as risk estimation methods, there are a few publications that discussed these methods. This is
due to the lack of datasets that are required for training and testing phases in machine learning and for
building appropriate strategies in game theory.
As discussed, providing a dataset that describe risk likelihood and its impact on a speciﬁc context
is one of the key issues of implementing risk-based access control models. We encourage various
researchers to build and share diﬀerent datasets regarding risk-based access control models that can
improve the performance and add learning ability to current risk-based access control models. Having
datasets that consider diﬀerent risk factors in diﬀerent domains can help researchers improve and
optimize their current risk-based models. There are no speciﬁc criteria for a dataset for the risk-based
access control model except it should provide quantitative values of risk likelihood and its impact for a
set of access control scenarios in a speciﬁc context with the specifying risk factors adopted.
