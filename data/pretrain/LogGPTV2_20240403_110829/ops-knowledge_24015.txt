User: i'm looking for a way in python to run an external binary and watch it's output for: "up to date" If "up to date" isn't returned i want to run the original command again, once "up to date" is displayed i would like to be able to run another script. So far I've figured out how to run the binary with options using subprocess but thats as far as I've gotten. Thanks!
Assistant: Use Popen from subprocess like this
process = Popen("cmd", shell=True, bufsize=bufsize, stdout=PIPE)
Then use process.stdout to read from program's stdout (like reading from any other file like object).
