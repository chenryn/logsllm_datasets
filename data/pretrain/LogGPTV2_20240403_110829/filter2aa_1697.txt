IPv6: No Longer Optional 
John Curran 
ARIN President & CEO 
Quick History of the Internet Protocol 
2 
•  Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4, or just “IP”) 
–  First developed for the original Internet (ARPANET) in spring 1978 
–  Deployed globally with growth of the Internet 
–  Total of 4 billion IP addresses available 
–  Well entrenched and used by every ISP and hosting company 
to connect customers to the Internet 
–  Allocated based on documented need 
•  Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) 
–  Design started in 1993 when IETF forecasts showed IPv4 
depletion between 2010 and 2017 
–  Completed, tested, and available for production since 1999 
–  Total of 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 IP 
addresses available 
–  Used and managed similar to IPv4

Available IPv4 Space in /8s

In 2010, RIRs have been allocated ten /8s blocks as of  
2 June, leaving sixteen /8s unallocated (16/256 = 6.25%)

In 2010, RIRs have been allocated ten/8s blocks as of  
2 June. 
IPv4 Depletion Situation Report 
•  The RIRs have needed between 8 
and 12 /8s each year worldwide. 
•  There are 16 /8s remaining in the 
available pool as of 2 June 2010. 
•  Demand for IPv4 continues to grow 
from organizations around the world.

IPv4 & IPv6 - The Bottom Line 
•  We’re running out of IPv4 
address space. 
•  IPv6 must be adopted for 
continued Internet growth. 
•  IPv6 is not backwards 
compatible with IPv4. 
•  We must maintain IPv4 and 
IPv6 simultaneously for many 
years. 
•  IPv6 deployment has begun. 
8 
RIRs have been allocating 
IPv6 address space since 1999. 
Thousands of organizations have 
received an IPv6 allocation to date. 
ARIN has IPv6 distribution policies for  
service providers, community networks,  
and end-user organizations. 
9 
IPv6 Deployment has begun 
Today, the Internet is predominantly based 
on IPv4. 
For the foreseeable future, the Internet must 
run both IP versions (IPv4 & IPv6) at the same 
time. (When done on a single device, this is 
called the “dual-stack” approach.) 
Deployment is already underway:  Today, 
there are organizations attempting to reach 
your mail, web, and application servers via 
IPv6...

Action Plans 
What does this mean for: 
•  Broadband Access Providers?  
•  Internet Service Providers? 
•  Internet Content Providers? 
•  Enterprise Customers? 
•  Equipment Vendors? 
•  Government Organizations? 
11 
Call to Action 
Broadband Access Providers 
Your customers want access to the entire 
Internet, and this means IPv4 and IPv6 
websites.  Offering full access will require 
running IPv4/IPv6 transition services and is a 
significant engineering project. 
Multiple transition technologies are available, 
and each provider needs to make its own 
architectural decisions. 
12 
Call to Action 
Internet Service Providers 
Plan out how to connect businesses via IPv6-
only and IPv4/IPv6 in addition to IPv4-only.   
Businesses are beginning to ask for IPv6 over 
their existing Internet connections and for 
their co-located servers.  
Communicate with your peers and vendors 
about IPv6, and confirm their timelines for 
production IPv6 services. 
13 
Call to Action 
Internet Content Providers 
Content must be reachable to newer 
Internet customers connected via IPv6. 
Access to your IPv4 only content will be 
dependent upon translation solutions run 
by the access providers. 
Plan on serving content via IPv6 in 
addition to IPv4 as soon as possible. 
14 
Call to Action  
Enterprise Customers 
Mail, web, and application servers must be 
reachable via IPv6 in addition to IPv4. 
Open a dialogue with your Internet Service 
Provider about providing IPv6 services. 
Each organization must decide on timelines, 
and investment level will vary. 
15 
Call to Action 
Equipment Vendors 
There was probably limited demand for IPv6 in 
the past. 
Demand for IPv6 support will become 
mandatory very, very quickly. 
Introduce IPv6 support into your product cycle 
as soon as possible. 
16 
Awareness 
Coordinate with industry 
Adopt incentives 
• 
 Regulatory 
• 
 Economic 
Support and promote awareness and educational 
activities 
Require IPv6-compatibility in procurement procedures 
Officially adopt IPv6 
17 
Call to Action 
Government Organizations 
IPv6 Adoption Needs 
IPv6 address space  
IPv6 connectivity (native or tunneled) 
Operating systems, software, and network 
management tool upgrades 
Router, firewall, and other hardware upgrades 
IT staff and customer service training
