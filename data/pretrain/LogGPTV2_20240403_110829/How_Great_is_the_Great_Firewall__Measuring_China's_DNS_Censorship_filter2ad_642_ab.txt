### Censored Domains within China

GFWatch is designed to probe using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which is stateless and unreliable. Consequently, packets may be lost due to factors beyond our control, such as network congestion. Additionally, previous studies have shown that the Great Firewall (GFW) sometimes fails to block access when under heavy load [21, 45]. To mitigate these issues, GFWatch tests each domain at least three times a day.

For this study, we used data collected from April to December 2020. As of the writing of this paper, GFWatch continues to run and collect data daily. The collected data will be made publicly available through a dedicated web service.

### 4. Censored Domains

Over the nine-month study period, we tested a total of 534 million distinct domains, identifying 311,000 domains that triggered the GFW's DNS censorship. Figure 3 summarizes the cumulative number of censored domains over time, along with the daily additions and removals. A notable spike in censored domains occurred on August 31st, primarily due to the addition of more than 30,000 subdomains from previously censored namespaces (e.g., *.googlevideo.com, *.appspot.com).

In this section, we describe our method for identifying specific strings that trigger the GFW's DNS censorship (Section 4.1). We use this method to remove unrelated domains that match the blocking rules ("overblocked" domains) and then characterize the censored domains in Section 4.2.

#### 4.1 Identifying Blocking Rules

Many of the domains filtered by the GFW share common second-level and top-level domains (e.g., numerous blocked domains of the form *.blogspot.com or *.tumblr.com). This observation led us to develop a clustering method for domains blocked based on the same underlying rule. For example, if subdomain.example.com and all subdomains of example.com are blocked, we consider example.com as the blocked domain. It is important to note that when a subdomain is blocked, the covering domains may not be blocked (e.g., cs.colorado.edu is blocked, whereas colorado.edu is not).

Inspired by a previous study of the GFW's DNS censorship [22], we use the following technique to identify the strings that trigger blocking (i.e., the most general string such that all domains containing this string are blocked). For a given domain, we test the following permutations:

- **Rule 0:** `censored_domain`
- **Rule 1:** `censored_domain{.rnd_str}`
- **Rule 2:** `censored_domain{rnd_str}`
- **Rule 3:** `{rnd_str.}censored_domain`
- **Rule 4:** `{rnd_str}censored_domain`
- **Rule 5:** `{rnd_str.}censored_domain{.rnd_str}`
- **Rule 6:** `{rnd_str.}censored_domain{rnd_str}`
- **Rule 7:** `{rnd_str}censored_domain{.rnd_str}`
- **Rule 8:** `{rnd_str}censored_domain{rnd_str}`

Among these rules, only Rules 1 and 3 are correct forms of a domain with a different top-level domain (Rule 1) or subdomain (Rule 3). The rest represent unrelated (or non-existent) domains that happen to contain the censored domain string. Censored domains grouped with a shorter domain string via rules other than Rules 1 or 3 are considered "overblocked" because they are not subdomains of the shorter domain but are textually similar (e.g., the censored domain `mentorproject.org` contains the shorter domain string `torproject.org` that triggers censorship).

Using these rules to generate and test domains, we identify the most general form of each censored domain that triggers censorship. We refer to these shortest censored domains as the "base domain" from which the blocking rule is generated. We discovered a total of 138,700 base domains from the set of 311,000 censored domains.

Focusing on base domains allows us to observe the growth in underlying blocking rules rather than the raw number of domains. We also observe fewer new base domains over time and avoid sudden jumps in censored domains when large numbers of subdomains of an existing base domain are observed. Figure 4 shows the cumulative number of base domains discovered over the nine-month period and the daily addition and removal of these domains. As of December 31st, 126,000 base domains were still being censored.

Of the 138,700 base domains, 11,800 are censored independently (Rule 0). In ascending order of severity, we find that 4, 113,800, 10,900, 1,400, and 696 distinct base domains are blocked under Rules 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8, respectively. There are no domains for Rules 1, 5, and 7, as domains blocked under these rules are already covered by more general rules. While the vast majority of base censored domains fall under Rule 3, more than 13,000 base domains are blocked under other rules, causing unrelated domains to be overblocked.

We use base domains to identify cases of overblocking, where an unrelated domain matches a more general censored domain string. Specifically, we consider domains that match a base domain but are not subdomains of the base domain as overblocked. With this definition, we find that 41,000 of the 331,000 censored domains are overblocked. The top three base domains causing the most overblocking are 919.com, jetos.com, and 33a.com. These three domains are responsible for a total of 15,000 unrelated domains being blocked because they end with one of these three base domains (and are not subdomains of them). Table 4 in Appendix A provides more details on the base domains responsible for the most overblocking. Domain owners may consider avoiding registering domain names containing these base domains to prevent inadvertent blocking by the GFW.

#### 4.2 Characterizing Censored Domains

We now characterize the 138,700 base domains identified in Section 4.1. Focusing on base domains avoids the impact of domains with numerous blocked subdomains on our results and allows us to avoid analyzing innocuous domains that are overblocked based on our previous analysis.

**Popularity of Censored Domains:**
Most domains blocked by the GFW are unpopular and do not appear on lists of the most popular websites. We use the rankings provided by the Tranco list [66], which combines four top lists (Alexa [1], Majestic [15], Umbrella [3], and Quantcast [10]) in a way that makes it more stable and robust against malicious manipulations [76]. The daily Tranco list contains about 7 million domains ranked by the Dowdall rule [48].

Figure 5 shows the CDF of the popularity ranking for the 138,700 blocked base domains. Only 1.3% of them are among the top 100,000 most popular domains, which is the statistically significant threshold of the popularity ranking as suggested by both top-list providers and previous studies [20, 83]. Even when considering all domains ranked by the Tranco list, only 13.3% of the base censored domains fall within the list’s ranking range, while the remaining are unranked. This finding highlights the importance of GFWatch's use of TLD zone files to enumerate the set of potentially censored domains.

**Types of Censored Content:**
For domain categorization, we use a service provided by FortiGuard [4], which has also been used by other censorship measurement studies [21, 71, 78], to make our analysis comparable. Figure 6 shows the top-ten domain categories censored by the GFW. We find that nearly half of the domains we observe are not currently categorized by FortiGuard, with 40% categorized as "newly observed domain," and 5.5% categorized as "not rated." This is a result of the large number of domains in our dataset, many of which may not be currently active (Section 7.3).

Apart from the "newly observed domain" and "not rated" categories, we find that "business," "pornography," and "information technology" are within the top-five dominant categories. This finding differs from the results reported by the most recent related work to ours [21], which observed "proxy avoidance" and "personal websites and blogs" as the most blocked categories. This difference stems from the counting process used in [21], which does not aggregate subdomains, while their test list is a fixed snapshot of 1 million domains from the Alexa list, which contains many subdomains of *.tumblr.com and *.blogspot.com.

**COVID-19 Related Domains:**
On December 19th, 2020, the New York Times reported that the Chinese Government issued instructions for suppressing the free flow of information related to the COVID-19 pandemic [81]. GFWatch has detected numerous domains related to COVID-19 being censored by the GFW through DNS tampering, including `covid19classaction.it`, `covid19song.info`, `covidcon.org`, `ccpcoronavirus.com`, `covidhaber.net`, and `covid-19truth.info`.

While most censored domains are discovered to be blocked soon after they appear in our set of test domains, we found some delay in blocking `ccpcoronavirus.com`, `covidhaber.net`, and `covid-19truth.info`. Specifically, `ccpcoronavirus.com` and `covidhaber.net` first appeared on our test lists in April but were not blocked until July and September, respectively. Similarly, `covid-19truth.info` appeared in our dataset in September but was not censored until October. The large difference in the time the GFW takes to censor different domains suggests that the blocklist is likely curated by both automated tools and manual efforts.

**Educational Domains:**
In 2002, Zittrain et al. [95] reported DNS-based filtering of several institutions of higher education in the US, including `mit.edu`, `umich.edu`, and `gwu.edu`. While "education" is not one of the top censored categories, we find numerous blocked education-related domains, including `armstrong.edu`, `brookings.edu`, `citizenlab.ca`, `feitian.edu`, `languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu`, `pori.hk`, `soas.ac.uk`, `scratch.mit.edu`, and `cs.colorado.edu`.

Although censorship against some of these domains is not surprising, since they belong to institutions well-known for conducting political science research and may host content deemed unwanted, we are puzzled by the blocking of `cs.colorado.edu`. While the University of Colorado’s computer science department is not currently using this domain to host their homepage, the blocking of this domain and its entire namespace `*.cs.colorado.edu` would prevent students in China from accessing other department resources (e.g., `moodle.cs.colorado.edu`). This is another evidence of the overblocking policy of the GFW, especially during the difficult time of the COVID-19 pandemic when most students need to take classes remotely.

### 5. Forged IP Addresses

The use of publicly routable IPs owned by foreign entities not only confuses impacted users and misleads their interpretation of the GFW's censorship but also hinders straightforward detection and circumvention [54]. Therefore, knowing the forged IPs and the pattern in which they are injected (if any) is essential. In this section, we analyze the IPs collected by GFWatch to examine whether there exists any specific injection pattern based on which we can develop strategies to effectively detect and bypass the GFW's DNS censorship.

#### 5.1 Forged IP Addresses Over Time

Extracting the forged IPs from all poisoned DNS responses captured by GFWatch, we find a total of 1,781 and 1,799 unique forged IPv4 and IPv6 addresses from poisoned type-A and type-AAAA responses, respectively. The forged IPv4 addresses are mapped to multiple ASes owned by numerous non-Chinese entities, including 783 (44%) IPs of Facebook, 277 (15.6%) IPs of WZ Communications Inc., 200 (11.2%) IPs of Twitter, and 180 (10.1%) IPs of Dropbox. On the other hand, all IPv6 addresses are bogus and belong to the same subnet of the predefined Teredo prefix [62], 2001::/32. Therefore, we will focus our analysis on the forged IPv4 addresses hereafter because the pattern of IPv6 injection is obvious and thus should be trivial to detect and circumvent.

Figure 7 shows the number of unique IPv4 addresses that GFWatch has discovered over the measurement period considered in this paper. The gray bar plot shows the number of unique IPs observed daily, and the blue bar plot shows the number of new IPs that were not observed previously. We add a second y-axis on the right side of the figure for better visibility of the blue bars.

Our initially collected data overlaps with the data collected during the final month of [21], which is the most recent related work to our study. During this period, our observation aligns with the result reported in Figure 2 of [21], i.e., the number of unique forged IPs is about 200 with no new IPs detected. However, starting in May, GFWatch began to detect more forged IPs every day until September, with about 10–20 new IPs added daily. These gradual daily additions, together with a significant increase of more than 300 previously unobserved IPs at the end of August, have brought the total number of forged IPs to more than 1,500. The number of forged IPs converges to 1,700 over the last four months of 2020.

Comparing the IPs observed by GFWatch with those reported in [21], we find that all IPs observed by [21] have been used again in poisoned DNS responses, regardless of the major drop reported on November 23rd, 2019. Additionally, we find 188 new IPs that were not observed previously in [21]. Given how close the timeline is between our work and [21], this finding of the unpredictable fluctuation in the number of forged IPs emphasizes the importance of having a large-scale longitudinal measurement system to keep track of erratic changes in the GFW's blocking behavior.
