censored inside China.
Since GFWatch is designed to probe using UDP, which
is a stateless and unreliable protocol, packets may get lost
due to factors that are not under our control (e.g., network
congestion). Moreover, previous studies have reported that the
GFW sometimes fails to block access when it is under heavy
load [21, 45]. Therefore, to minimize the impact of these
factors on our data collection, GFWatch tests each domain
at least three times a day.
For this paper, we use data collected during the last nine
months of 2020, from April to December. As of this writing,
GFWatch is still running and collecting data every day. The
data collected will be made available to the public on a daily
basis through a dedicated web service.

DNS censoring capability. Figure 3 summarizes the cumu-
lative number of censored domains over time, as well as the
number of domains added and removed from the set of cen-
sored domains each day. We note a sharp increase in domains
on August 31st because of the addition of more than 30K
subdomains from the previously censored namespaces (e.g.,
*.googlevideo.com, *.appspot.com) to our test domains.
In this section, we describe our technique for identifying the
speciﬁc strings that trigger GFW’s DNS censorship (§4.1).
We use this technique to remove unrelated domains that match
the blocking rules (“overblocked” domains) and then charac-
terize domains censored by the GFW in Section 4.2.
Identifying Blocking Rules
4.1
When considering the domains ﬁltered by the GFW, there are
many with common second-level and top-level domains (e.g.,
numerous blocked domains of the form *.blogspot.com or
*.tumblr.com). This observation led us to develop a cluster-
ing method for domains that are blocked based on the same
underlying rule. For example, if subdomain.example.com
and all subdomains of example.com are blocked, we con-
sider example.com as the blocked domain. We note that
when a subdomain is blocked, the covering domains may
not be blocked (e.g., cs.colorado.edu is blocked, whereas
colorado.edu is not (§4.2)).
Inspired by a previous study of GFW’s DNS censor-
ship [22], we use the following technique to identify the
strings that trigger blocking (i.e., the most general string such
that all domains containing this string are blocked). For a
given domain, we test the following permutations of each
censored domain and random strings:
• Rule 0 censored_domain
• Rule 1 censored_domain{.rnd_str}
• Rule 2 censored_domain{rnd_str}
• Rule 3 {rnd_str.}censored_domain
• Rule 4 {rnd_str}censored_domain
• Rule 5 {rnd_str.}censored_domain{.rnd_str}
• Rule 6 {rnd_str.}censored_domain{rnd_str}
• Rule 7 {rnd_str}censored_domain{.rnd_str}
• Rule 8 {rnd_str}censored_domain{rnd_str}
Among these rules, only Rules 1 and 3 are correct forms
of a domain with a different top-level domain (Rule 1) or
subdomain (Rule 3). In contrast, the rest represents unre-
lated (or non-existent) domains that happen to contain the
censored domain string. We refer to censored domains that
are grouped with a shorter domain string via rules other
than Rules 1 or 3 as being overblocked, because they are
not subdomains of the shorter domain, but are actually un-
related domains that are textually similar (e.g., the censored
domain mentorproject.org contains the shorter domain
string torproject.org that actually triggers censorship).
Using these rules to generate domains and testing them with
GFWatch, we identify the most general form of each cen-
sored domain that triggers censorship. We refer to these short-
est censored domains as the “base domain” from which the
blocking rule is generated. We discovered a total of 138.7K
base domains from the set of 311K censored domains.
Considering base domains allows us to observe growth in
the underlying blocking rules as opposed to the raw number
of domains. We also observe fewer new base domains over
time and avoid sudden jumps in censored domains when
large numbers of subdomains of an existing base domain
are observed. Figure 4 shows the cumulative number of base
domains discovered over the nine-month period and the daily
addition and removal of these domains. As of December 31st,
126K base domains are still being censored.
Of 138.7K base domains, 11.8K are censored indepen-
dently (Rule 0). In other words, these domains are censored
as they are, but do not trigger GFW’s DNS censorship when
concatenated with random strings. However, in an ascending
order of severity, we ﬁnd that 4, 113.8K, 10.9K, 1.4K, and
696 distinct base domains are blocked under Rules 2, 3, 4,
6, and 8, respectively. There are no domains for Rules 1, 5,
and 7, since domains blocked under these rules are already
covered by other more general rules. While the vast majority
of base censored domains fall under Rule 3, there are more
than 13K base domains blocked under other rules, causing

unrelated domains to be overblocked.
We utilize the base domains to identify cases of overblock-
ing, where an unrelated domain matches a more general cen-
sored domain string. Speciﬁcally, we consider domains that
match a base domain, but are not subdomains of the base do-
main, as being overblocked. This is because these domains are
unrelated to the base domain despite being textually similar.
With this deﬁnition, we ﬁnd that 41K of the 331K censored
domains are overblocked. The top three base domains that
cause the most overblocking are 919.com, jetos.com, and
33a.com. These three domains are responsible for a total of
15K unrelated domains being blocked because they end with
one of these three base domains (and are not subdomains
of them). Table 4 in Appendix A provides more details on
the base domains responsible for the most overblocking. Do-
main owners may consider refraining from registering domain
names containing these base domains to avoid them being
inadvertently blocked by the GFW.
4.2 Characterizing Censored Domains
We now characterize the 138.7K base domains identiﬁed
in §4.1. We focus on these base domains to avoid the im-
pact of domains with numerous blocked subdomains on our
results. Focusing on base domains also allows us to avoid
analyzing innocuous domains that are overblocked based on
our previous analysis.
Popularity of censored domains. We ﬁnd that most do-
mains blocked by the GFW are unpopular and do not appear
on lists of most popular websites. We use the rankings pro-
vided by the Tranco list [66], which combines four top lists
(Alexa [1], Majestic [15], Umbrella [3], and Quantcast [10])
in a way that makes it more stable and robust against mali-
cious manipulations [76]. The daily Tranco list contains about
7M domains ranked by the Dowdall rule [48].
Figure 5 shows the CDF of the popularity ranking for the
138.7K blocked base domains. Only 1.3% of them are among
the top 100K most popular domains, which is the statistically
signiﬁcant threshold of the popularity ranking as suggested
by both top-list providers and previous studies [20, 83]. Even
when considering all domains ranked by the Tranco list, only
Figure 6: Top ten categories of domains censored by the GFW.
13.3% of the base censored domains fall within the list’s
ranking range, while the remaining are unranked. This ﬁnding
highlights the importance of GFWatch’s use of TLD zone
ﬁles to enumerate the set of potentially censored domains.
Types of censored content. For domain categorization, we
use a service provided by FortiGuard [4], which has also been
used by other censorship measurement studies [21, 71, 78],
to make our analysis comparable. Figure 6 shows the top-ten
domain categories censored by the GFW. We ﬁnd that nearly
half of the domains we observe are not currently categorized
by FortiGuard, with 40% categorized as “newly observed
domain,” and 5.5% categorized as “not rated.” This is a result
of the large number of domains in our dataset, many of which
may not be currently active (§7.3).
Apart from the “newly observed domain” and “not rated”
categories, we ﬁnd that “business,” “pornography,” and “in-
formation technology” are within the top-ﬁve dominant cate-
gories. This ﬁnding is different from the results reported by
the most recent related work to ours [21], which observed
“proxy avoidance” and “personal websites and blogs” as the
most blocked categories. This difference stems from the count-
ing process used in [21], which does not aggregate subdo-
mains, while their test list is a ﬁxed snapshot of 1M domains
from the Alexa list, which contains many subdomains of
*.tumblr.com and *.blogspot.com.
COVID-19 related domains. On December 19th, 2020,
the New York Times reported that the Chinese Govern-
ment issued instructions for suppressing the free ﬂow
of information related to the COVID-19 pandemic [81].
GFWatch has detected numerous domains related to COVID-
19 being censored by the GFW through DNS tampering,
including covid19classaction.it, covid19song.info
covidcon.org, ccpcoronavirus.com, covidhaber.net,
and covid-19truth.info.
While most censored domains are discovered to be blocked
soon after they appear in our set of test domains, we found
that there was some delay in blocking ccpcoronavirus.com,
covidhaber.net, and covid-19truth.info. Speciﬁcally,
ccpcoronavirus.com and covidhaber.net ﬁrst appeared

September, respectively. Similarly, covid-19truth.info ap-
peared in our dataset in September but was not censored until
October. The large difference in the time the GFW takes to
censor different domains shows that the blocklist is likely to
be curated by both automated tools and manual efforts.
Educational domains.
In 2002, Zittrain et al. [95] reported
DNS-based ﬁltering of several institutions of higher education
in the US, including mit.edu, umich.edu, and gwu.edu.
While “education” is not one of the top censored categories,
we ﬁnd numerous blocked education-related domains, in-
cluding armstrong.edu, brookings.edu, citizenlab.ca,
feitian.edu, languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu, pori.hk,
soas.ac.uk, scratch.mit.edu, and cs.colorado.edu.
Although censorship against some of these domains is
not surprising, since they belong to institutions well-known
for conducting political science research and may host con-
tent deemed as unwanted, we are puzzled by the blocking of
cs.colorado.edu. While the University of Colorado’s com-
puter science department is not currently using this domain
to host their homepage, the blocking of this domain and its
entire namespace *.cs.colorado.edu would prevent stu-
dents in China from accessing other department resources
(e.g., moodle.cs.colorado.edu). This is another evidence
of the overblocking policy of the GFW, especially during the
difﬁcult time of the COVID-19 pandemic when most students
need to take classes remotely.
5 Forged IP Addresses
The use of publicly routable IPs owned by foreign entities not
only confuses the impacted users and misleads their interpreta-
tion of the GFW’s censorship, but also hinders straightforward
detection and circumvention [54]. Therefore, knowing the
forged IPs and the pattern in which they are injected (if any)
is essential. In this section, we analyze the IPs collected by
GFWatch to examine whether there exists any speciﬁc in-
jection pattern based on which we can develop strategies to
effectively detect and bypass the GFW’s DNS censorship.
5.1 Forged IP Addresses over Time
Extracting the forged IPs from all poisoned DNS responses
captured by GFWatch, we ﬁnd a total of 1,781 and 1,799
unique forged IPv4 and IPv6 addresses from poisoned type-
A and type-AAAA responses, respectively. The forged IPv4
addresses are mapped to multiple ASes owned by numerous
non-Chinese entities, including 783 (44%) IPs of Facebook,
277 (15.6%) IPs of WZ Communications Inc., 200 (11.2%)
IPs of Twitter, and 180 (10.1%) IPs of Dropbox. On the other
hand, all IPv6 addresses are bogus and belong to the same sub-
net of the predeﬁned Teredo preﬁx [62], 2001::/32. There-
fore, we will focus our analysis on the forged IPv4 addresses

by GFWatch.
hereafter because the pattern of IPv6 injection is obvious and
thus should be trivial to detect and circumvent.
Figure 7 shows the number of unique IPv4 addresses that
GFWatch has discovered over the measurement period con-
sidered in this paper. The gray bar plot shows the number of
unique IPs observed daily, and the blue bar plot shows the
number of new IPs that were not observed previously. We
add a second y-axis on the right side of the ﬁgure for better
visibility of the blue bars.
Our initially collected data overlaps with the data collected
during the ﬁnal month of [21], which is the most recent related
work to our study. During this period, our observation aligns
with the result reported in Figure 2 of [21], i.e., the number
of unique forged IPs is about 200 with no new IPs detected.
However, starting in May, GFWatch began to detect more
forged IPs every day until September, with about 10–20 new
IPs added daily. These gradual daily additions, together with
a signiﬁcant increase of more than 300 previously unobserved
IPs at the end of August, have brought the total number of
forged IPs to more than 1.5K. The number of forged IPs
converges to 1.7K over the last four months of 2020.
Comparing the IPs observed by GFWatch with the ones
reported in [21], we ﬁnd that all IPs observed by [21] have
been used again in poisoned DNS responses, regardless of the
major drop reported on November 23rd, 2019. In addition, we
ﬁnd 188 new IPs that were not observed previously in [21].
Given how close the timeline is between our work and [21],
this ﬁnding of the unpredictable ﬂuctuation in the number
of forged IPs emphasizes the importance of having a large-
scale longitudinal measurement system to keep track of erratic
changes in the GFW’s blocking behavior. Therefore, we are
