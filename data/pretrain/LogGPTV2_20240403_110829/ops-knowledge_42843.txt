User: I am trying to access a MySQL database with python through Pydev Eclipse. I have installed the necessary files to access MysQL from python and I can access the database only when I write code in Python IDLE environment and run it from command prompt. However I am not able to run my applications from Pydev. 
when I use this "import MysqlDB"  i get an error, but in IDLE no errors and my code runs very smoothly.
Does anyone know were the problem is?
Thanks

From Eclipse, choose Window / Preferences / PyDev / Interpreters / Python Interpreter, click on Manage with pip and enter the command:
install mysql-connector-python
