User: The following is 20 lines of a system log. Each line consists of a timestamp, log level, process id, relevant software component, and the log content. Think step-by-step and step and summarize this log chunk:

Assistant: This log chunk shows the spark.CacheManager attempting to compute a partition (rdd_11_1) that was not found, and the storage.BlockManager finding several blocks (rdd_2_0, rdd_2_4, rdd_2_3, rdd_2_2, rdd_2_1) locally. The python.PythonRunner then records the total, boot, init, and finish times for several processes, and the storage.MemoryStore stores several blocks (rdd_11_0, rdd_11_3, rdd_11_4, rdd_11_2, rdd_11_1) as bytes in memory.
