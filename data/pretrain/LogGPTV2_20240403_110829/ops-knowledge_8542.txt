User: I have installed (or so I think) python 2.7.5. When I type "Python --version" I get python2.7.5
I've narrowed this down to:

When I run "python" in a terminal in my /Home/UsrName/ directory it is version 2.7.5
However when I run "python" in a terminal in /Home/UserName/Downloads/Ipython directory I get 2.6.6

I went into the Ipython folder to run the Ipython Setup file. I think I need to add python27 to a system path so that when I am inside the /Home/UserName/Downloads/Ipython directory and run the install file Ipython knows I am using a required version of python.
I am not sure how to add python27 to the system on redhat linux 6.5 (Also I am not even sure that this will fix it).
Assistant: I think I know what is happening - abarnert pointed out that the cwd (".") may be in your path which is why you get the local python when you're running in that directory. Because the cwd is not normally setup in the global bashrc file (/etc/bashrc) it's probably in your local ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile. So edit those files and look for something like PATH=$PATH:. and remove that line. Then open a new window (or logout and log back in) to refresh the path setting and you should be OK.
