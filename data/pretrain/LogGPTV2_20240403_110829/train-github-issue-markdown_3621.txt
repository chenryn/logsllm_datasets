# Bug report
I wanted to create a new next app using `npx create-next-app` with typescript.
I followed all the steps and renamed .js files to .tsx and ran `yarn dev`.
According to this blogpost: https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9#built-in-zero-
config-typescript-support it should detect that the project is using
typescript and add what's necessary but it didn't.
