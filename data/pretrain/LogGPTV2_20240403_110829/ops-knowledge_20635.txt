User: I have created two eggs using bdist and egg_A is defines as a dependency  of egg_B.
I check both egg using the command unzip and both are ok, however when I try to insall the egg using easy_install I get the following stack trace :
Installed c:\virtualenv\lib\site-packages\pymarketdata-1.0-py2.7.egg
Reading file:C:/python_nest/
Processing dependencies for PyMarketData==1.0
zipimport.ZipImportError: bad local file header in c:\yoan\yoyo\lib\site-packages\PyMarketData-1.0-py2.7.egg
Any idea where it could come from ?
Assistant: This error:

bad local file header

seems to say that the file header (which usually determines the filetype) isn't passing Python's test. It could be the zipping program you used.
Try 7-Zip (free) or a different program when creating your egg. I haven't made them before, but I think there is even a way to do it with plain 'ol Python.
