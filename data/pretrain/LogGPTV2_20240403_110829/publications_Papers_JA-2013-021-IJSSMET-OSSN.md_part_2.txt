### Open Semantic Service Networks: Design Principles and Approaches

Open semantic service networks (OSSNs) are designed to support the digital representation, modeling, and reasoning about business service networks. These networks aim to facilitate communication with business model stakeholders and enable the manual analysis of networks with relatively stable boundaries. The overarching objective is to achieve global and automatic re(construction) of potentially unknown service networks, thereby enabling large-scale processing of service information. This goal is underpinned by underlying assumptions and normative rules. The design of OSSNs is guided by the following seven principles:

1. **Service vs. Web Service**:
   - A business or real-world service is a system that aggregates, structures, and configures people, resources, and information to create new value for consumers.
   - A Web service, on the other hand, is a computational entity and software artifact that can be invoked remotely to achieve a user goal.
   - OSSNs encompass the former, focusing on real-world services.

2. **Social Process**:
   - The (re)construction of OSSNs is the result of a peer-to-peer social process.
   - Firms, groups, and individuals (the community) are equal participants who freely cooperate to provide information on services and their relationships, ultimately creating a unique, global, large-scale service network.

3. **Self-Governance**:
   - OSSNs are a common good created and governed by the community through distributed decision-making and autonomy.
   - Governance is not centralized but rather managed by the participants themselves, without an external central authority or hierarchical management structure.

4. **Openness and Free-Access**:
   - The OSSNs created by the community are freely accessible on a universal basis.
   - Individual authorship and contributions of services and relationships are recognized and traced back to their originators.

5. **Autonomy and Distribution**:
   - Community participants (firms, groups, and individuals) have the autonomy to advertise their know-how, capabilities, and skills in the form of services.
   - Services are distributed over space and time, forming new services as networks.

6. **Semantic Networks**:
   - OSSNs are semantic because they explicitly describe their services and relationships using a conceptual domain model, shared vocabularies, and ideally, Semantic Web standards and techniques.

7. **Decoupling**:
   - Decoupling in OSSNs means that service descriptions and service relationships are defined independently of each other.
   - Each relationship is specified without regard to any specific service description language, and vice versa.

### Hybrid Services

Recently, services are increasingly seen as hybrid entities that, while being invoked through a digital interface, can be fulfilled by a mix of human and automatic activities. Amazon’s Mechanical Turk is a prime example, where a web interface is used to provision or procure work in the form of Human Intelligence Tasks (HITs). Activities like tagging images, finding specific information on the web, or translating text are carried out by humans behind a digital facade. This involvement of people in processes has been previously addressed by BPEL extensions such as BPEL4People, but new initiatives like the Social Compute Unit (Dustdar & Truong, 2012) aim to integrate human-based computing and software services into one composite system.

### Approach to Open Semantic Service Networks

Our long-term goal is to develop rich, open service networks, which involves four main activities:

1. **Service Modeling**:
   - Creating an ontology by identifying and modeling business service concepts.
   - Using Semantic Web ontologies to enrich service descriptions and make the underlying information available to both humans and remote software applications.

2. **Expressing Rich Service Relationships**:
   - Developing a model for specifying connections between services.
   - Encoding relationships to be rich, include business information, and be computer-understandable, allowing for automatic extraction and construction of service networks.

3. **Populating Service and Relationship Models**:
   - Bootstrapping service networks with up-to-date services and relationship instances.
   - Utilizing methods like crawling, web mining, and crowdsourcing to create initial service descriptions, traces, and inferencing.

4. **Service Network Construction**:
   - Constructing globally distributed service networks requires accessing, retrieving, storing, and integrating service models.
   - New research on parallel approaches and scalable, distributed storage systems is essential.

### Service Modeling

#### Describing Services with USDL

In the field of service modeling, we have developed the Unified Service Description Language (USDL) to describe business services. Our previous work has shown that the quality of services can be represented and controlled using guiding specifications. However, service modeling often faces an impedance mismatch between different modeling perspectives, which USDL aims to integrate into a single specification.

#### Describing Services with Linked USDL

The initial version of USDL was finalized in 2009 and later renamed to α-USDL. Based on industry feedback, a W3C Incubator group was created, and USDL was adapted and extended. The second version, called Linked USDL, uses semantic Web principles and is still in development. Linked USDL aims to develop an ontology to represent services by establishing explicit ontological links to other existing ontologies from Linked Data initiatives.

### Expressing Rich Service Relationships

To connect service models hosted in marketplaces, corporate websites, and procurement systems, a computer-understandable format is necessary. Research from business management and supply chain networks is required to develop a model for rich service relationships. For example, Weill and Vitale (2001) introduced schematics for analyzing and designing business initiatives based on participants, relationships, and flows, which can serve as a baseline for service network modeling.

### Conclusion

The development of open semantic service networks is a multifaceted endeavor that integrates various modeling perspectives and leverages the power of community-driven and distributed governance. By adhering to the seven design principles and focusing on the four main activities, we aim to create a robust and scalable framework for service networks that can support the digital transformation of business services.
