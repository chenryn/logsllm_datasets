User:  Please describe the distributed storage system, including its advantages, disadvantages and commonly used distributed storage systems.
Assistant: distributed storage system is a storage system composed of multiple computer networks. Data is distributed on different nodes, and each node retains a part of the data. The biggest advantage of a distributed storage system is that it can provide high availability, high performance and scalability. Because the data of the distributed storage system is scattered on multiple nodes, as long as one of the nodes has a problem, other nodes can continue to provide services without affecting the operation of the entire system. In addition, since the data has been distributed across multiple nodes, the read and write load is also distributed across multiple nodes, thus providing better performance and scalability. However, distributed storage systems also have some disadvantages. First, the implementation of distributed storage systems requires complex algorithms and protocols, so the development and maintenance costs are relatively high. In addition, since data is stored on multiple nodes, it is very difficult to ensure data consistency, and a special synchronization mechanism must be used to ensure data consistency. Finally, since these nodes are all running on different computers, the performance of network communication may also become the bottleneck of system performance. Currently commonly used distributed storage systems include: 1. Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS): It is a distributed file system for big data processing, which is characterized by high availability, high reliability and high data throughput. 2. GlusterFS: A distributed file system and object storage system that uses software-defined storage to divide different computers into a shared storage pool. 3. Ceph: It is a powerful distributed object storage system with high availability, scalability and high performance, suitable for providing storage services under the cloud. 4. Apache Cassandra: It is a distributed NoSQL database that can store data with high concurrency and high availability. Its main features are scalability, high throughput, and high reliability. To sum up, the advantages of a distributed storage system are high availability, high performance and scalability, but its disadvantages include high cost of development, difficulty in ensuring data consistency and network communication performance. Commonly used distributed storage systems include HDFS, GlusterFS, Ceph, and Apache Cassandra.
