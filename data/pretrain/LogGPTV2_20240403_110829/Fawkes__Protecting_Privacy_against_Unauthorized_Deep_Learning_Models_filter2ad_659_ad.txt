### Protection Performance and Cloaking Effectiveness

**Figure 6: Impact of the Number of Labels on Protection Performance**
- **Description**: The figure illustrates how the protection performance improves as the number of labels in the tracker's model increases. (User/Tracker: Web-Incept)
- **Y-Axis**: Protection Success Rate
- **X-Axis**: Number of Labels in Student Dataset
- **Key Observations**:
  - As the number of labels increases, the protection success rate also increases.
  - This suggests that a more diverse and comprehensive training set enhances the effectiveness of the cloaking method.

**Figure 7: Effectiveness of Cloaking with Different Feature Extractors**
- **Description**: The figure shows that cloaking is less effective when users and trackers use different feature extractors. (User: VGG2-Dense, Tracker: Web-Incept)
- **Y-Axis**: Normal Classification Accuracy
- **X-Axis**: Various Image Types (Original, Other, Target, Cloaked)
- **Key Observations**:
  - Cloaking is significantly less effective when the user and tracker use different feature extractors.
  - This highlights the importance of understanding the feature extractor used by the tracker for optimal cloaking.

**Figure 8: Transferability of Cloaks Between Feature Extractors**
- **Description**: The figure demonstrates that cloaks generated on robust models transfer better between different feature extractors. (User: VGG2-Dense, Tracker: Web-Incept)
- **Y-Axis**: Dimension 1
- **X-Axis**: Dimension 2
- **Key Observations**:
  - Cloaks generated on robust models are more effective across different feature extractors.
  - This indicates that robust cloaks can provide broader protection against various tracking systems.

### Evaluation of Cloaking Techniques Against Popular Facial Recognition APIs

**Microsoft Azure Face API**
- **Description**: Microsoft's Azure Face API uses transfer learning to train a model on user-submitted images.
- **Cloaking Effectiveness**:
  - Normal cloaking: 100% effective
  - Robust cloaking: 100% effective
- **Conclusion**: Both normal and robust cloaking methods provide complete protection against the Azure Face API.

**Amazon Rekognition Face Verification**
- **Description**: Amazon Rekognition computes an image similarity score rather than classifying images.
- **Cloaking Effectiveness**:
  - Normal cloaking: 34% effective
  - Robust cloaking: 100% effective
- **Conclusion**: While normal cloaking is only partially effective, robust cloaking provides full protection against Amazon Rekognition.

**Face++**
- **Description**: Face++ is a robust face recognition system widely used by financial services and security-sensitive applications.
- **Cloaking Effectiveness**:
  - Normal cloaking: 0% effective
  - Robust cloaking: 100% effective
- **Conclusion**: Normal cloaking is ineffective against Face++, but robust cloaking achieves complete protection.

### Summary
- **Findings**: The Fawkes cloaking techniques are highly effective against popular and widely deployed facial recognition systems.
- **Future Outlook**: As these systems improve, cloaking techniques will need to evolve to maintain their effectiveness.

### Trackers with Uncloaked Image Access

**Impact of Uncloaked Images**
- **Description**: Evaluates the impact of adding uncloaked images to the tracker’s model training data.
- **Key Observations**:
  - The protection success rate drops below 39% when more than 15% of the user’s images are uncloaked.
  - This highlights the vulnerability of cloaking when uncloaked images are available to the tracker.

**Proactive Mitigation Strategies**
- **Flood with Cloaked Images**: Intentionally release more cloaked images to dominate any leaked uncloaked images.
- **Sybil Accounts**: Use secondary identities to confuse the tracker’s model.

**Sybil Accounts**
- **Description**: Sybil accounts are separate, controlled accounts that exist in the same online community.
- **Creating Sybil Images**:
  - Add a specially designed cloak to a set of candidate images.
  - Optimize to minimize the feature space separation between Sybil and original images.
- **Effectiveness**:
  - Sybil images help increase the protection success rate by complicating the model’s decision boundary.
  - Even with a small number of uncloaked images, Sybil accounts can significantly enhance protection.

**Figure 9: Intuition Behind Sybil Integration**
- **Description**: Visualizes the impact of Sybil images in a 2D feature space.
- **Key Observations**:
  - Without Sybils, the tracker’s model easily classifies images correctly.
  - With Sybils, the model must create additional decision boundaries, leading to misclassification of the user’s images.

### Experimental Validation
- **Setup**: Choose a label from the tracker’s dataset to be the Sybil account and split the user’s images into two sets: cloaked and uncloaked.
- **Results**: Sybil accounts effectively increase the protection success rate when the tracker has access to a small number of uncloaked images.

This structured and detailed approach provides a clear and professional overview of the cloaking effectiveness and the impact of various factors on the protection success rate.
