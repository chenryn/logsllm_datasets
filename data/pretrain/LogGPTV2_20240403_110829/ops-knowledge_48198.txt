User:  company needs to set up a secure remote access method to manage their servers, can you provide a secure and feasible solution?
Assistant: Consider using a virtual private network (VPN) for remote access. A VPN can provide a secure encrypted connection so that data accessed from a server over a public network can be protected. Alternatively, use two-step verification (such as using an authenticator app or text message) for added security to prevent unauthorized access. At the same time, the server can be regularly scanned for security vulnerabilities and updated with all security patches to ensure server security.
