User: How to do branch management and merging in Git repository?
Assistant: Git's branch management and merging functions are very important in project development, which can help multiple developers work independently in a warehouse at the same time, and finally merge their work results. The following are some key steps: 1. Create a branch: In a Git project, you can use the "git branch" command to create a new branch. For example, "git branch my_branch" creates a new branch called "my_branch". 2. Switch branch: Use the "git checkout" command to switch to a new branch and start working. For example, "git checkout my_branch" will switch the user to the branch named "my_branch". 3. Commit changes: After making modifications on the new branch, you can use the "git add" and "git commit" commands to commit the changes. This is done on a new branch and will not affect the master branch. 4. Merge branch: When the user's new branch is modified and passed the test, you can use the "git checkout" command to return to the main branch, and then use the "git merge" command to merge the new branch into the main branch. For example, "git merge my_branch" merges the branch named "my_branch" into the branch you are currently on (probably the master branch). 5. Resolve conflicts: If a conflict occurs when merging branches, Git will prompt the user to manually resolve the conflict. You can use the "git status" command to view conflicting files and manually modify the conflicting parts of the file. After the conflict is resolved, you can use the "git add" command to add the modified file to the temporary storage area, and then use the "git commit" command to submit the newly added modification. 6. Delete branch: When a branch is no longer needed, you can use the "git branch -d" command to delete it. For example, "git branch -d my_branch" will delete the branch named "my_branch". In general, Git's branch management and merging functions are very powerful and flexible, which can help users collaborate more easily in project development.
