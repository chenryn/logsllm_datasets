When installing a package using `sudo pip-python` (specifically, the `python-pip-0.8-1.el6.noarch` package on CentOS 6), I occasionally encounter permission issues where the installed packages are only readable by the root user. Reinstalling the package one or two more times typically resolves the issue. Has anyone else experienced this problem? Additionally, could anyone provide troubleshooting steps to help identify the root cause?

**Assistant:**
When using `sudo` with `pip`, it is recommended to use the `-H` flag. The `-H` flag sets the `HOME` environment variable to the home directory of the target user, which can help avoid permission issues.

For example:
```sh
sudo -H pip install virtualenv
```

This approach ensures that the installation process has the correct environment settings and may prevent the permission issues you are encountering.
