User: When installing a package via sudo pip-python (CentOS 6 package: python-pip-0.8-1.el6.noarch), I sometimes get permission issues with the installed packages being readable only by root.
Re-installing again one or two times usually fixes the problem. Has anyone experienced this? Or can anyone suggest any troubleshooting steps to nail down the cause?
Assistant: If executing pip with sudo, you may want sudo's -H flag
-H, --set-home              set HOME variable to target user's home dir
e.g
sudo -H pip install virtualenv
