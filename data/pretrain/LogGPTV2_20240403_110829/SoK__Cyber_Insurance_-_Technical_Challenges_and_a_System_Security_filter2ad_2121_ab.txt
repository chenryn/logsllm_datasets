measures, the presence of sensitive data and how it is stored and
processed, and any other information that can affect the global
security posture of the company under investigation [37], [38].
A deeper analysis can be carried out to tailor the product to the
specific customer based on its characteristics and requirements:
a monitoring software equipment together with an overhaul of
preexisting security logs and telemetry serve this purpose. Finally,
some deficiencies and precautions are often advised to the client
in order to comply with the best-known security practices [39].
Assessing the cyber risk of organizations or individuals is an
overly challenging problem due to a number of reasons including
the existence of asymmetric information, the dynamic nature of
the cyber ecosystem, and the indirect risk that might be propagated
from the relations with the third parties (we will come back to
these points in more details later in the paper). Although with
the traditional meticulous risk assessment methodologies the
underwriters could draw an approximate picture of the customer’s
risk exposure, they might not be aware of the residual risks that
might be known to the counterparts. The possession of a greater
material knowledge by one of two parties involved in an economic
transaction creates the problem of carrying asymmetric information
and this represents a major issue in cyber insurance [5], [16],
[40]–[42]. A risk assessment that is made by analyzing asymmetric
information can lead to adverse selection [43], [44]. For example,
unfair risk scores might be assigned to a company whose private
and inaccessible information may reveal a severe exposure to risk
compared to another with a better security hygiene.
The existence of asymmetric information also impacts negatively
the customer side as insurance firms may raise premium prices
due to incomplete knowledge and risk overestimation, leading to
an expensive, niche, and not-appealing product [45], [46]. High
premiums are also the result of insufficient criteria to reduce them:
even if a company holds security certifications and profusely invests
in self-protection, the effectiveness of these actions against the wide
variety of cyber attacks is not clear, making, in turn, difficult to assess
to what extent they are useful to reduce the overall risk [45]. A timid
step in this direction is the one of some carriers who reduce premi-
ums or deductibles if the client uses risk assessment tools, security
technologies, and breach response services of specific vendors [47].
The interdependent nature of the cyber ecosystem makes the
risk estimation even more complicated. Nowadays, when cloud
computing and outsourcing are two mainstream phenomena, cyber
risk is intertwined among all entities that depend on one another [5],
[41], [48]. Companies may indirectly get damaged because they
use external services that are targeted by a cyber attack: an example
is the recent DDoS attack against DynDNS – which impacted
more than sixty of its customers [49]. Thus, a firm’s measures and
expenditures in self-protection may not proportionally increase its
security level when making use of services from third parties that do
not invest as well [5], [18]. In the pre-binding phase, risk exposure
must be then identified from a holistic standpoint, preferring a
due diligence approach to a simple checklist and including in the
review all internal and external threat vectors that could potentially

compromise pre-insured’s security [50].
Actuarial and Pricing – The actuarial approach based on statistical
models described above does not fit the cyber domain where
historical data of claims and compensations are still scant [16], [41],
[43], [45], [51], [52]. Enterprises experiencing a cyber incident have
a strong incentive not to publicly disclose it as this would tarnish
their image. As a result, the few available databases [53]–[55]
contain records which are often vague, missing details, and biased
towards large and serious incidents, whose disclosure is unavoidable
due to their resonance or due to mandatory-notification laws [56],
[57]. The infeasibility of the actuarial approach alone for an accurate
risk estimation is corroborated by its ever-evolving components:
cyber threats and attack methods swiftly evolve alike defense
methods and strategies do [18], [38], [41].
Portfolio Management – As briefly discussed before, a fundamen-
tal requirement of traditional insurance schemes is that the insurer
should strive to obtain a portfolio of policies with an independent
probability of claim submission. This diversification can reduce the
likelihood that a single incident could harm a considerable portion of
clients – a catastrophic event that can have severe consequences and
cause the bankruptcy of the insurer [58]–[60]. Unfortunately, it is
harder to obtain such diversified portfolio in the cyber domain, due
to the monoculture of software and hardware products [61]–[64]. Al-
though deploying different configurations is possible, recent events
have shown that the business continuity of a large set of possible
clients – independently of their size, sector, and assets to protect – is
simultaneously undermined when a piece of a broadly-used software
or hardware is found to suffer from a severe vulnerability [65]–[72].
In other domains, a common way insurers protect themselves
against catastrophic events such as wildfire and hurricanes is by
purchasing policies from other insurance companies. Sadly, the
current lack of re-insurers in the cyber domain further exacerbates
this problem [41], [73]–[75].
Post-Binding Phase – Due to the complications in both the policy
underwriting and claiming phases, an additional post-binding phase
is introduced, which does not exist in other forms of insurance [50].
In fact, in traditional insurances, the relationship between the firm
providing coverage and the policyholder ends once the contract has
been signed and the two parties interact again only in case of a claim
submission. On the contrary, a cyber insurance may require periodic
risk assessment after the underwriting is completed, to allow the
insurer and the policyholder to collect updated information related
to new threats and evolved risks. Indeed, many cyber-insurance
policies already bring supplemental value through the inclusion of
risk mitigation, tracking and loss-prevention tools [76]. Clients, in
particular small organizations that lack experience, can benefit from
this continuous interaction to better ponder their measures towards
higher-priority situations [46]. The post-binding phase also helps to
prevent the well-known issue of moral hazard [18], [43], [77], [78]
— a form of post-underwriting opportunism by the policyholder,
who undertakes incautious actions knowing that, in case of incidents,
there exists a counterpart who will bear the brunt and will not be
able to verify the presence of negligent and fraudulent actions. In
this regard, insurers have to conduct continuous risk assessments to
resize the set of inaccessible information of the insured and mitigate
its unfair behaviors.
Claim Submission and Validation – Cyber-insurance policies
usually cover the costs of incident response and forensic investiga-
tions, including the identification of stolen or compromised data and
the extent to which third parties have to be informed according to
the current regulations. Despite this, a precise quantification of the
involved and compromised assets is complicated by their intangible
nature [41], [43]. In addition, since jurisdictions may apply different
notification laws, each case must be accurately evaluated according
to the localization of the indirectly-damaged third party.
The insurer as well compensates for economic losses related to
the event. In particular, cyber insurance may refund losses due to
business interruption caused by an attack, as well as cyber extortion
and stolen assets. This approach is insufficient in the cyber scenario
where the above primary losses are often followed by secondary
ones that result from a loss of reputation whenever the incident is
publicly disclosed [40].
Time is also a key component when it comes to claim submission.
Some attacks may silently compromise a system and remain
undiscovered for a considerable time-frame. The validity of claims
in such situations is a more arduous issue to formalize in cyber
policies. Furthermore, carriers may require forensic investigations
prior to claim submission to verify its validity, resulting in an initial
disbursement from the insured and a reputation damage due to the
disclosed incident.
III. LITERATURE ON CYBER INSURANCE
A. Categorization and Source Selection
Since its first appearance in the late 90s [18], cyber insurance
has been the focus of researchers from different disciplines.
For our study, we selected and analyzed 93 works among
academic papers, standards, and frameworks. As shown in Figure 2,
we grouped these works in four main categories and fourteen
sub-categories. In particular, we found that previous research
has mainly focused on two areas: cyber risk management, which
tries to estimate attack probabilities and possible damages, and
mathematical modeling and game theory simulations, which
aim at deriving interesting properties on the consequences of
cyber-insurance adoption. Two additional areas complete the picture:
research conducted by the economics community reporting figures
from past incidents or discussing the costs of possible scenarios, and
research focusing on the prediction of future cybersecurity events.
Since these four macro categories refer to very different research
domains, we adopted distinct criteria to select and present the
contributions from each of them. Risk management is a very wide
topic that covers a wide range of domains, ranging from pharma-
ceutical products to natural disasters. We reported all methodologies
and frameworks that are currently used in IT, together with those
academic papers presenting risk aggregation techniques. Regarding
the contribution from the economics community, as an exhaustive
discussion would be out of scope for a security conference, we
focused on the papers needed to emphasize research problems,
existing tools, and on the major findings that can affect the work of
security researchers. For this reason, we comprehensively reported

all of the attempts made in quantifying economic losses following
cyber incidents. The works employing mathematical modeling
and game theory have already been deeply analyzed by Marotta
et al. in [19]. Therefore, in Section III-C, we decided to offer a
different systematization that focuses on which property the authors
were interested to prove, along with the choice of the simulation
parameters —e.g., the market model, the presence of asymmetric
information, and the network topology. Finally, since our ultimate
goal is a call to actions for security researchers to provide data-driven
solutions for the cyber-insurance domain, our study comprehensively
presents and compares previous prediction attempts in section III-E.
B. Approaches and techniques for cyber risk management
According to the ISO standard 31000, a risk management
process can be described as a set of tasks whereby it is possible to
measure the risk and subsequently develop strategies to monitor
and control its evolution [132]. As a result, the first phase of risk
management is dedicated to the identification of the valuable assets
and of the related threats that represent the main components of
risk. Each threat is then analyzed by evaluating its likelihood and
possible impact from both a qualitative and quantitative perspective,
and results are then aggregated to obtain an overview of the whole
risk. These two phases, grouped and referred to as risk assessment,
are usually followed by a risk treatment step, which covers the
choice of non-exclusive countermeasures that can be adopted to
tackle each of the risk components. Finally, as risks may suddenly
change, causing the previous estimations to become incorrect and
countermeasure ineffective, a number of monitoring and reviewing
actions are required to continuously update the risk estimation.
Risk management is an important process when it comes
to information technologies. Therefore, the literature is rich of
guidelines, frameworks, and techniques that contextualize it to the
digital world. As depicted in Figure 2, we grouped under the risk
management sub-category the studies that provide a walk-through
of the entire procedure [32]–[34], [95]–[98], defining terms and
providing a helpful documentation of how to address issues on risk
assessment and treatment, as well as insights on risk monitoring
and reviewing. Other works often inherit or revisit a previous
risk management methodology and introduce new techniques to
implement a specific sub-component. In this respect, we created
two different sub-categories in which we respectively list the works
addressing the whole risk assessment [36], [99]–[101] and those
narrowing down the discussion on risk analysis [35], [102], [103].
Although widely used standards (such as ISO 27005 [95])
and tools (e.g., NIST SP 800-30 [32], Magerit [33], OCTAVE
Allegro [34], Clusif [36] and the one proposed by Microsoft [97])
handle the single stages of the management procedure in a different
way, they share a common underlying workflow for assessing
individual risks. According to it, the process typically starts by
brainstorming which and how cyber-based threats could prevent
the company from reaching business goals and team objectives.
In this respect, real-life cyber events previously occurred to other
companies can be used as source of inspiration. In addition, frame-
works often provide guidelines on how to identify this collection,
including checklists or questionnaires, and advising to adopt a
what-if approach to understand what could go wrong and what
the possible consequences are. The outcome of this process is the

creation of a risk register, whose structure, together with some
examples, is reported in Table I. Once each row has been filled with
a description of the threat, including its possible triggers and effects,
the impact and likelihood of its materialization are assessed to define
the inherent risk. Two approaches exist for scoring these factors and
the choice of one rather than the other depends on the company itself.
Indeed, some tools provide a table of decipherable words with a
