### Measures and Considerations for Enhancing Global Security Posture

To effectively evaluate and enhance the global security posture of a company, it is essential to consider several key factors. These include the presence of sensitive data, how it is stored and processed, and any other information that could impact the overall security. A deeper analysis can be conducted to tailor security solutions to the specific needs and characteristics of the customer. This involves deploying monitoring software, reviewing existing security logs, and leveraging telemetry data.

Additionally, it is often necessary to advise clients on addressing deficiencies and implementing precautions to align with best-known security practices. The assessment of cyber risk for organizations or individuals is a complex challenge due to various factors, including asymmetric information, the dynamic nature of the cyber ecosystem, and the indirect risk propagated through third-party relationships. Traditional risk assessment methodologies may provide an approximate picture of the customer's risk exposure but may not account for residual risks known only to the counterparties.

### Asymmetric Information and Its Impact

Asymmetric information, where one party in an economic transaction possesses more material knowledge than the other, is a significant issue in cyber insurance. This can lead to adverse selection, where companies with higher risk profiles may be unfairly assessed. For example, a company with severe, yet private, risk exposures might receive a lower risk score compared to another with better security hygiene.

From the customer's perspective, asymmetric information can also result in higher premiums due to incomplete knowledge and risk overestimation. Even if a company holds security certifications and invests heavily in self-protection, the effectiveness of these measures against a wide variety of cyber attacks is not always clear, making it difficult to assess their true value in reducing overall risk. Some insurers offer premium reductions or deductible decreases for clients who use specific risk assessment tools, security technologies, and breach response services.

### Interdependent Nature of the Cyber Ecosystem

The interdependent nature of the modern cyber ecosystem further complicates risk estimation. With the widespread adoption of cloud computing and outsourcing, cyber risk is interconnected among all entities. A company may be indirectly affected by a cyber attack on a third-party service provider. For instance, the 2016 DDoS attack on DynDNS impacted over sixty of its customers. Therefore, a firm's self-protection measures may not proportionally increase its security level if third parties do not invest similarly in security. In the pre-binding phase, a holistic approach to due diligence is essential, considering both internal and external threat vectors that could compromise the pre-insured's security.

### Actuarial and Pricing Challenges

Traditional actuarial approaches based on statistical models are not well-suited for the cyber domain, where historical claims and compensation data are limited. Companies experiencing cyber incidents have strong incentives to avoid public disclosure, leading to databases that are often vague, missing details, and biased towards large, serious incidents. The rapid evolution of cyber threats and defense methods further complicates accurate risk estimation.

### Portfolio Management and Diversification

A fundamental requirement of traditional insurance is diversifying the portfolio to reduce the likelihood of a single incident affecting a large portion of clients. However, this is challenging in the cyber domain due to the monoculture of software and hardware products. Recent events have shown that a severe vulnerability in widely-used software or hardware can simultaneously undermine the business continuity of many clients, regardless of their size or sector. The lack of re-insurers in the cyber domain exacerbates this problem.

### Post-Binding Phase and Continuous Risk Assessment

Due to the complexities in underwriting and claiming, an additional post-binding phase is introduced in cyber insurance. Unlike traditional insurance, the relationship between the insurer and the policyholder continues beyond the contract signing, with periodic risk assessments to update information on new threats and evolved risks. Many cyber insurance policies include risk mitigation, tracking, and loss-prevention tools, which can be particularly beneficial for small organizations. The post-binding phase also helps prevent moral hazard, where policyholders may engage in incautious behavior, knowing that the insurer will bear the brunt of any incidents.

### Claim Submission and Validation

Cyber insurance policies typically cover the costs of incident response and forensic investigations, including the identification of stolen or compromised data and the extent of third-party notifications required by regulations. Quantifying the involved and compromised assets is complicated by their intangible nature. Jurisdictional differences in notification laws further complicate claim evaluation. Insurers also compensate for economic losses, such as business interruption, cyber extortion, and stolen assets. However, secondary losses from reputation damage following public disclosure of an incident are often not fully covered.

Time is a critical factor in claim submission. Some attacks may remain undetected for extended periods, complicating the validity of claims. Carriers may require forensic investigations before claim submission, leading to initial disbursements and potential reputation damage.

### Literature on Cyber Insurance

#### Categorization and Source Selection

Since its emergence in the late 1990s, cyber insurance has been a focus of research across multiple disciplines. For our study, we selected and analyzed 93 works, including academic papers, standards, and frameworks. These works were grouped into four main categories and fourteen sub-categories, as shown in Figure 2. The primary areas of focus are cyber risk management, mathematical modeling and game theory, economics, and prediction of future cybersecurity events.

#### Approaches and Techniques for Cyber Risk Management

According to the ISO standard 31000, risk management involves measuring risk and developing strategies to monitor and control its evolution. The process includes identifying valuable assets and related threats, analyzing their likelihood and impact, and aggregating results to provide an overview of the entire risk. This is followed by a risk treatment step, where countermeasures are chosen, and continuous monitoring and reviewing actions to update the risk estimation.

Risk management in information technology is well-documented, with numerous guidelines, frameworks, and techniques. These include studies providing a comprehensive walk-through of the risk management procedure, defining terms, and offering insights on risk assessment, treatment, monitoring, and reviewing. Commonly used standards and tools, such as ISO 27005, NIST SP 800-30, Magerit, OCTAVE Allegro, Clusif, and Microsoft's framework, share a common workflow for assessing individual risks. The process typically begins with brainstorming potential cyber threats and their impacts, using real-life examples and what-if scenarios. The outcome is a risk register, which documents each threat, its triggers, effects, and inherent risk scores.
