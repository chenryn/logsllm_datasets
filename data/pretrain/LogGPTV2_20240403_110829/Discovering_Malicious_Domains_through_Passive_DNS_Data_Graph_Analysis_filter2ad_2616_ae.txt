(a) False positive rate vs. True positive rate for all conﬁgurations

Figure 8: Expansion of conﬁgurations with high true positive rates and low false positive rates for the two-week dataset
is much worse than our approach.
We emphasize that this result does not contradict with
that in [7], as their approach is designed for inference over a
completely diﬀerent type of data. Instead, it simply means
that the inference intuition for host-domain graphs does not
hold in domain resolution graphs. Therefore, though belief
propagation works well to discover malicious domains over
host-domain graphs, it performs poorly when dealing with
passive DNS data.
4.2.5 Evaluation beyond VirusTotal
To further evaluate the feasibility and the accuracy of
our approach, we have manually cross-checked our detec-
tion results against other third party public services about
malicious domains, including MacAfee Site Advisor, mul-
tirbl.valli.org, MXToolBox, DBL-Update, and the German
inps.de-DNSBL. Speciﬁcally, we use all the malicious ground
truth from VirusTotal as the seed set for the one week data
(a total of above 6000 malicious domains), and then manu-
ally check samples of those domains whose malicious scores
are over a certain threshold. Our manual inspection reveals
that, based on a 10% sample, 98% of domains with scores
over 0.9 are reported to be malicious or suspicious by at
least one of the above public services, which means that
the potentially malicious domains discovered by our scheme
is highly accurate.
5. DISCUSSION
Our currently approach adopts a simple technique to iden-
tify public IPs, which, though eﬀective, is by no means ex-
haustive. It would be possible to develop more sophisticated
algorithms to classify public/private IPs by considering ad-
vanced features (e.g., domain distributions, traﬃc patterns,
etc.), which will further help us improve the accuracy of
malicious domain inferences.
One potential issue with our approach is that an attacker
may “taint” a benign domain D by letting a known malicious
domain D(cid:48) point to the IPs of D, forming a fake association
between D(cid:48) and D. We do not believe this is a serious issue
as it is more to the beneﬁt of attackers to deploy stealthy
and agile malicious domains rather than “framing” innocent
domains. Nevertheless, such attacks can be thwarted par-
tially through white listing of popular benign domains. For
the case that D is benign but unpopular, if D is hosted in
public IPs (as many such domains nowadays choose to do
so), our approach ensures that even if a malicious domain

hand, if D is hosted in its own private IPs, it is unlikely
that those IPs belong to diﬀerent ASNs, and therefore no
strong association formed between D(cid:48) and D, causing the
“tainting” attack ineﬀective.
6. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we propose a new technique to discover
malicious domains by analyzing passive DNS data. Our
approach takes advantage of the dynamic nature of mali-
cious domains to discover strong associations among them,
which are further used to infer malicious domains from a
set of existing known malicious ones. We further propose
heuristics to handle complicated practical issues (such as
web hosting) to improve both the eﬀectiveness and eﬃciency
of the proposed technique. Experimental results show that
our technique can achieve high true positive rates and low
false positive rates with good expansion, i.e., discovering a
signiﬁcantly large set of potentially malicious domains with
a small set of seeds.
There are a number of avenues for extending this work.
One main focus is to integrate passive DNS data with other
network and application data to enrich mechanisms for ﬁnd-
ing robust associations between domains. It would also be
interesting to investigate other inference mechanisms (e.g.,
diﬀerent methods to compute malicious scores from multiple
seeds). To deploy our scheme in practice, it is also important
to study incremental malicious score updates when passive
DNS data are constantly updated with new domain resolu-
tions as well as when new malicious domains are added to
the set of seeds.
