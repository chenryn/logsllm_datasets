### Version
2.5.21
### Reproduction link
https://github.com/phil294/vue-hackernews-ssr-alternative-data-fetching
### Steps to reproduce
In SSR docs, option 2, Fetch data after the matched view is rendered, calls
`asyncData` in `beforeMount`.
The pseudo-syntax is
    if (asyncData)
      asyncData()
This does not check if `asyncData` was already called by the server. Thus,
guided by the official docs, this leads to duplicate fetches. In the case of
dynamic module registration, even to duplicate modules.
In the linked repro, I cloned vue-hackernews and changed the fetch method
accordingly. I also added a console.log to when `fetchIdsByType` is called
which happens when `asyncData` is called.
### What is expected?
Data is fetched on server, client does not fetch it again (as is the case with
the usual `router.beforeResolve` solution (step 1).
### What is actually happening?
Data is fetched twice, also on client, because there is no check on whether
the data is already there, effectively making option 2 unusable.
