CRITICALITY ANALYSIS 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Enterprises should complete a criticality analysis as a prerequisite input 
to assessments of cybersecurity supply chain risk management activities. First, enterprises should complete 
a criticality analysis as part of the Frame step of the C-SCRM Risk Management Process. Then, findings 
generated in the Assess step activities (e.g., criticality analysis, threat analysis, vulnerability analysis, and 
mitigation strategies) update and tailor the criticality analysis. A symbiotic relationship exists between the 
criticality analysis and other Assess step activities in that they inform and enhance one another. For a high-
quality criticality analysis, enterprises should employ it iteratively throughout the SLDC and concurrently 
across the three levels. Enterprises should require their prime contractors to implement this control and 
flow down this requirement to relevant sub-tier contractors. Departments and agencies should also refer to 
Appendix F to supplement this guidance in accordance with Executive Order 14028, Improving the 
Nation’s Cybersecurity. 
Level(s): 1, 2, 3  
RA-10 THREAT HUNTING 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: The C-SCRM threat hunting activities should supplement the 
enterprise’s internal threat hunting activities. As a critical part of the cybersecurity supply chain risk 
management process, enterprises should actively monitor for threats to their supply chain. This requires a 
collaborative effort between C-SCRM and other cyber defense-oriented functions within the enterprise. 
Threat hunting capabilities may also be provided via a shared services enterprise, especially when an 
enterprise lacks the resources to perform threat hunting activities themselves. Typical activities include 
information sharing with peer enterprises and actively consuming threat intelligence sources (e.g., like 
those available from Information Assurance and Analysis Centers [ISAC[ and Information Assurance and 
Analysis Organizations [ISAO]). These activities can help identify and flag indicators of increased 
cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain that may be of concern, such as cyber incidents, mergers 
and acquisitions, and Foreign Ownership, Control, or Influence (FOCI). Supply chain threat intelligence 
should seek out threats to the enterprise’s suppliers, as well as information systems, system components, 
and the raw inputs that they provide. The intelligence gathered enables enterprises to proactively identify 
and respond to threats emanating from the supply chain.

FAMILY: SYSTEM AND SERVICES ACQUISITION 
[FIPS 200] specifies the System and Services Acquisition minimum security requirement as 
follows: 
Organizations must: (i) allocate sufficient resources to adequately protect 
organizational information systems; (ii) employ system development life cycle 
processes that incorporate information security considerations; (iii) employ software 
usage and installation restrictions; and (iv) ensure that third-party providers employ 
adequate security measures to protect information, applications, and/or services 
outsourced from the organization.  
Enterprises acquire ICT/OT products and services through system and services acquisition. 
These controls address the activities of acquirers, suppliers, developers, system integrators, 
external system service providers, other ICT/OT-related service providers, and related 
upstream supply chain relationships. They address both the physical and logical aspects of 
supply chain security, from detection to SDLC and security engineering principles. C-SCRM 
concerns are already prominently addressed in [NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5]. This document adds 
further detail and refinement to these controls.  
SA-1 
POLICY AND PROCEDURES 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: The system and services acquisition policy and procedures should 
address C-SCRM throughout the acquisition management life cycle process, to include purchases made via 
charge cards. C-SCRM procurement actions and the resultant contracts should include requirements 
language or clauses that address which controls are mandatory or desirable and may include 
implementation specifications, state what is accepted as evidence that the requirement is satisfied, and how 
conformance to requirements will be verified and validated. C-SCRM should also be included as an 
evaluation factor.  
These applicable procurements should not be limited to those that are directly related to providing an 
ICT/OT product or service. While C-SCRM considerations must be applied to these purchases, C-SCRM 
should also be considered for any and all procurements of products or services in which there may be an 
unacceptable risk of a supplied product or service contractor compromising the integrity, availability, or 
confidentiality of an enterprise’s information. This initial assessment should occur during the acquisition 
planning phase and will be minimally informed by an identification and understanding of the criticality of 
the enterprise’s mission functions, its high value assets, and the sensitivity of the information that may be 
accessible by the supplied product or service provider.  
In addition, enterprises should develop policies and procedures that address supply chain risks that may 
arise during contract performance, such as a change of ownership or control of the business or when 
actionable information is learned that indicates that a supplier or a product is a target of a supply chain 
threat. Supply chains evolve continuously through mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures, and other 
partnership agreements. The policy should help enterprises understand these changes and use the obtained 
information to inform their C-SCRM activities. Enterprises can obtain the status of such changes through, 
for example, monitoring public announcements about company activities or any communications initiated 
by suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related 
service providers.

enterprise and for applicable suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, 
and other ICT/OT-related service providers. In addition to traditional SDLC activities, such as requirements 
and design, the SDLC includes activities such as inventory management, acquisition and procurement, and 
the logical delivery of systems and components. See Section 2 and Appendix C for further guidance on 
SDLC. Departments and agencies should refer to Appendix F to implement this guidance in accordance 
with Executive Order 14028, Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity.

ACQUISITION PROCESS 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Enterprises are to include C-SCRM requirements, descriptions, and 
criteria in applicable contractual agreements.  
1. Enterprises are to establish baseline and tailorable C-SCRM requirements to apply and incorporate 
into contractual agreements when procuring a product or service from suppliers, developers, 
system integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers. 
These include but are not limited to:   
a. 
C-SCRM requirements that cover regulatory mandates (e.g., the prohibition of certain 
ICT/OT or suppliers) address identified and selected controls that are applicable to reducing 
cyber supply chain risk that may be introduced by a procured product or service and that 
provide assurance that the contractor is sufficiently responsible, capable, and trustworthy. 
b. Requirements for critical elements in the supply chain to demonstrate the capability to 
remediate emerging vulnerabilities based on open source information and other sources. 
c. 
Requirements for managing intellectual property ownership and responsibilities for elements 
such as software code; data and information; the manufacturing, development, or integration 
environment; designs; and proprietary processes when provided to the enterprise for review or 
use. 
d. Requirements that address the expected life span of the product or system, any element(s) that 
may be in a critical path based on their life span, and what is required when end-of-life is near 
or has been reached. Enterprises should conduct research or solicit information from bidders 
or existing providers under contract to understand what end-of-life options exist (e.g., replace, 
upgrade, migrate to a new system, etc.).  
e. 
Articulate any circumstances when secondary market components may be permitted.

f. 
Requirements for functional properties, configuration, and implementation information, as 
well as any development methods, techniques, or practices that may be relevant. Identify and 
specify C-SCRM evaluation criteria, to include the weighting of such criteria.  
2. Enterprises should: 
a. 
Establish a plan for the acquisition of spare parts to ensure adequate supply, and execute the 
plan if or when applicable; 
b. Establish a plan for the acquisition of alternative sources of supply as may be necessary 
during continuity events or if/when a disruption to the supply chain occurs;  
c. 
Work with suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and 
other ICT/OT-related service providers to identify and define existing and acceptable incident 
response and information-sharing processes, including inputs on vulnerabilities from other 
enterprises within their supply chains. 
3. Establish and maintain verification procedures and acceptance criteria for delivered products and 
services, which include but are not limited to: 
a. 
Accepting COTS and GOTS products without verification, as authorized by the enterprise 
(e.g., approved products lists) 
b. Supplier validation of developmental and COTS software and hardware information system 
vulnerabilities 
4. Ensure that the continuous monitoring plan includes supply chain aspects in its criteria, such as 
including the monitoring of functions, ports, and protocols in use. See Section 2 and Appendix C. 
5. Ensure that the contract addresses the monitoring of suppliers, developers, system integrators, 
external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers’ information 
systems located within the supply chain infrastructure. Monitor and evaluate the acquired work 
processes and work products where applicable. These include but are not limited to monitoring 
software development infrastructure for vulnerabilities (e.g., DevSecOps pipelines, software 
containers, and code repositories/shares).  
6. Communicate processes for reporting information security weaknesses and vulnerabilities detected 
during the use of ICT/OT products or services, and ensure reporting to appropriate stakeholders, 
including OEMs where relevant. 
7. Review and confirm sustained compliance with the terms and conditions of the agreement on an 
ongoing basis. 
Departments and agencies should refer to Appendix F to implement this guidance in accordance with 
Executive Order 14028, Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity.

SECURITY AND PRIVACY ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: The following security engineering techniques are helpful for managing 
cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain. 
a. 
Anticipate the maximum possible ways that the ICT/OT product or service can be misused or 
abused in order to help identify how to protect the product or system from such uses. Address 
intended and unintended use scenarios in architecture and design.  
b. Design network and security architectures, systems, and components based on the enterprise’s risk 
tolerance, as determined by risk assessments (see Section 2 and Appendix C).  
c. 
Document and gain management acceptance and approval for risk that is not fully mitigated.  
d. Limit the number, size, and privilege levels of critical elements. Using criticality analysis will aid 
in determining which elements or functions are critical. See criticality analysis in Appendix C and 
NISTIR 8179, Criticality Analysis Process Model: Prioritizing Systems and Components.  
e. 
Use security mechanisms that help to reduce opportunities to exploit supply chain cybersecurity 
vulnerabilities, such as encryption, access control, identity management, and malware or 
tampering discovery.  
f. 
Design information system components and elements to be difficult to disable (e.g., tamper-
proofing techniques), and if they are disabled, trigger notification methods such as audit trails, 
tamper evidence, or alarms.  
g. Design delivery mechanisms (e.g., downloads for software) to avoid unnecessary exposure or 
access to the supply chain and the systems/components traversing the supply chain during 
delivery. 
h. Design relevant validation mechanisms to be used during implementation and operation.

The requirements definition is complete and reviewed for accuracy and completeness, including 
the assignment of criticality to various components and defining operational concepts and 
associated scenarios for intended and unintended use.  
b. Requirements are based on needs, relevant compliance drivers, criticality analysis, and 
assessments of cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain. 
c. 
Cyber supply chain threats, vulnerabilities, and associated risks are identified and documented. 
d. Enterprise data and information integrity, confidentiality, and availability requirements are defined 
and shared with the system suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service 
providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers as appropriate.  
e. 
The consequences of non-compliance with C-SCRM requirements and information system 
security requirements are defined and documented.   
f. 
There is a clear delineation of accountabilities, roles, and responsibilities between contractors 
when multiple disparate providers are engaged in supporting a system or mission and business 
function.  
g. The requirements detail service contract completion and what defines the end of the suppliers, 
developers, system integrators, external system service providers, or other ICT/OT-related service 
providers’ relationship. This is important to know for re-compete, potential change in provider, 
and to manage system end-of-life processes.  
h. Establish negotiated agreements for relationship termination to ensure a safe and secure 
termination, such as removing data from cloud environments.

SA-11  DEVELOPER TESTING AND EVALUATION 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Depending on the origins of components, this control may be 
implemented differently. For OTS (off-the-shelf) components, the acquirer should conduct research (e.g., 
via publicly available resources) or request proof to determine whether the supplier (OEM) has performed 
such testing as part of their quality or security processes. When the acquirer has control over the application 
and development processes, they should require this testing as part of the SDLC. In addition to the specific 
types of testing activities described in the enhancements, examples of C-SCRM-relevant testing include 
testing for counterfeits, verifying the origins of components, examining configuration settings prior to 
integration, and testing interfaces. These types of tests may require significant resources and should be 
prioritized based on criticality, threat, and vulnerability analyses (described in Section 2 and Appendix C), 
as well as the effectiveness of testing techniques. Enterprises may also require third-party testing as part of 
developer security testing. Departments and agencies should refer to Appendix F to implement this 
guidance in accordance with Executive Order 14028, Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity.

SA-15 DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, STANDARDS, AND TOOLS 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Providing documented and formalized development processes to guide 
internal and system integrator developers is critical to the enterprise’s efforts to effectively mitigate 
cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain. The enterprise should apply national and international 
standards and best practices when implementing this control. Using existing standards promotes 
consistency of implementation, reliable and defendable processes, and interoperability. The enterprise’s 
development, maintenance, test, and deployment environments should all be covered by this control. The 
tools included in this control can be manual or automated. The use of automated tools aids thoroughness, 
efficiency, and the scale of analysis that helps address cybersecurity risks that arise in relation to the 
development process throughout the supply chain. Additionally, the output of such activities and tools 
provides useful inputs for C-SCRM processes, as described in Section 2 and Appendix C. This control has 
applicability to the internal enterprise’s processes, information systems, and networks as well as applicable 
system integrators’ processes, systems, and networks. Departments and agencies should refer to Appendix
