### Title: Certified Pre-Owned: Abusing Active Directory Certificate Services

**Abstract:**

Microsoft's Active Directory Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) implementation, known as Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS), has often been overlooked by both offensive and defensive cybersecurity professionals. Despite its widespread deployment, AD CS presents significant opportunities for attackers to engage in credential theft, maintain machine persistence, escalate domain privileges, and achieve subtle domain persistence.

In this presentation, we will cover the following key areas:

1. **Background on Certificates in Active Directory:**
   - We will provide a comprehensive overview of how certificates function within an Active Directory environment, including their role in authentication and authorization.

2. **Abuse of AD CS:**
   - We will detail the methods by which attackers can exploit AD CS through certificate theft and malicious enrollment. This includes techniques for maintaining user and machine persistence within the network.

3. **Common Certificate Template Misconfigurations:**
   - We will discuss a set of common misconfigurations in certificate templates that can lead to domain escalation. These misconfigurations can be exploited to gain higher levels of access and control within the network.

4. **Stealing a Certificate Authority's Private Key:**
   - We will explain a method for stealing the private key of a Certificate Authority (CA). This stolen key can then be used to forge new "golden" certificates, which can be leveraged for further attacks and persistent access.

By highlighting the security implications of AD CS, our goal is to raise awareness among both attackers and defenders about the potential vulnerabilities and risks associated with this complex and widely deployed system. Understanding these issues is crucial for enhancing the overall security posture of organizations that rely on AD CS.
