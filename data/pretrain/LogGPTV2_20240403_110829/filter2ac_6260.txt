**ATT&CK ID:** T0889  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Modify Program

Adversaries may modify or add programs on a controller to alter its interaction with the physical process, peripheral devices, and other hosts on the network. These modifications can be achieved through various methods, including:

- **Program Download:** Replacing the existing program on the controller with a new, modified version.
- **Online Edit:** Making real-time changes to the program while the controller is in operation.
- **Program Append:** Adding new code or functionality to the existing program without completely replacing it.

These techniques allow adversaries to manipulate the controller's behavior, potentially leading to disruptions or unauthorized control of the system.
