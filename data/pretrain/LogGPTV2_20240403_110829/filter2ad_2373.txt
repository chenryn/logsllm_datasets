ABSTRACT
End-to-End programmability across radio, transport and
compute resources is a key enabler for the ﬁfth gener-
ation of mobile communication networks (5G). In our
work we look into how SDN can realize the required
cross-domain programmability, as well as slicing of re-
sources towards multiple clients. We present design
and implementation of a hierarchical, modular and pro-
grammable orchestration architecture across radio ac-
cess networks and transport networks. We demonstrate
how the developed multi-domain orchestration improves
the service creation as well as resource utilization across
the domains using real-time monitoring.

INTRODUCTION
The 5G system will enable new services and challeng-
ing applications as deﬁned by e.g. Next Generation Mo-
bile Network (NGMN). Low-latency and highly reliable
machine-type applications will be supported, and new
radio features and deployment scenarios are introduced,
e.g. cooperative cells. Programmability is key to enable
new services and meeting short time to market require-
ments [1]. Furthermore, virtualization of network func-
tions means that this programmability should span all
relevant technology domains, including radio access net-
work (RAN), transport networks and distributed cloud.

Software-deﬁned networking (SDN) is a promising
approach to bring the required programmability into
networking. Most SDN research has dealt with ﬁxed
networks, but recently there have also been eﬀorts in
wireless networks. Nevertheless, little has been achieved
for coordinated resource control and service creation
across all interconnected domains, which is a key en-
abler of 5G, and is the main focus of our work. Specif-
ically, we apply SDN principles like abstraction and
programmability to create an orchestration across RAN
and transport networks. The orchestration enables end-
to-end programmability and dynamic network control
through a single interface, something which is hard to
realize, if at all possible, with the rigid architecture of
current networks.
2. MULTI-DOMAIN ORCHESTRATION
ARCHITECTURE
i.e.
To fulﬁll 5G requirements on programmability and
operational scalability we propose a hierarchical, multi-
domain control and orchestration architecture (Figure
1). At the bottom layer we have heterogeneous re-
sources,
radio, transport and cloud, distributed
across diﬀerent domains. Resources within individual
domains are controlled through a domain-speciﬁc con-
troller in a programmable way. A key aspect of the
architecture is to specify the abstractions and inter-
faces between diﬀerent control and orchestration lay-
ers. While there are many approaches for abstracting
resources of individual domains, designing combined ab-
straction models for heterogeneous resources is a chal-
lenge, and is subject of ongoing research. For example,
the European FP7 project UNIFY proposes a joint ab-
straction of networking and compute resources in form
of a big-switch big-software (BiS-BiS), which presents a
virtualization of a networking element connected with
a compute node. In this model, requests to the orches-
tration layers can recursively be expressed as network
function forwarding graphs (NF-FG), where an NF-FG
presents a mapping of a set of speciﬁc NFs and their cor-
responding forwarding overlay into the abstract view of
the infrastructure resources (i.e. BiS-BiS) [2].
In the
next section, we explain how we adopt this concept for
abstracting radio and transport resources.

3. PROOF OF CONCEPT
To demonstrate feasibility and beneﬁts of the pre-
sented architecture in Figure 1, we created a testbed
for orchestration across RAN and transport networks.
Our testbed is composed of:
Radio Domain: provides broadband services to mo-
bile users. While focusing on RAN-Transport orches-
tration to fulﬁll 5G requirements, here we utilize exist-
ing 4G LTE network elements (access points and packet
core) for the sake of simplicity. The domain is deployed
according to the centralized RAN (C-RAN) architec-
ture, where the RAN functionality is split between re-
mote radio units (RRUs) and pooled baseband process-
ing units (BBUs), which are interconnected using op-
tical circuit-switched connectivity services of the trans-
port domain.
Optical Transport Domain: is a dynamic wavelength
routed network and provides programmable fronthaul
services to the mobile domain at the wavelength level.
The transport domain is controlled by the OpenDay-
light (ODL) controller, which is customized to support
circuit-switched network control and optical path com-
putation. Also, an abstraction layer is implemented
on top of the ODL to expose the transport domain as
a large switch. For controlling the radio domain we
use a CLI-based manager that centrally controls RAN
resources. The RAN control functions include acti-
vation and conﬁguration of cells, assignment of BBU
processors to RRUs, and management of user’s han-
dovers among cells. We abstract the BBUs and RRUs
in the RAN as individual NFs, which allows us to ap-
ply the BiS-BiS/NF-FG model and create a joint re-
source orchestrator across the domains. Both north-
and southbound interfaces of the orchestrator, and the
northbound interfaces of domain controllers are imple-
mented based on the NF-FG and the associated open-
source library [2]. Additionally, as part of the orchestra-
tion layer we have implemented a layer of virtualization,
which creates slices of joint RAN-transport resources.
In our demonstration we present a use-case of the
RAN-transport orchestration, where a RAN infrastruc-
ture is shared between two service providers (SPs). Each
SP gets a slice composed of RAN and transport re-
sources, where the radio resources are RRUs and BBUs.
Figure 2: RAN-transport orchestration PoC.
Figure 2 illustrates an example of the overall view of
the infrastructure resources, and virtualized views pre-
sented to SPs. There are two types of virtual resources,
dedicated (denoted with blue in Figure 2) and shared
(denoted with red). While dedicated resources are guar-
anteed to be at the disposal of an SP at all service oper-
ation times, the shared resources can be used by either
of the SPs at any time. The orchestrator ensures the
isolation between the dedicated resources of each SP
and also resolves possible conﬂicts for using the shared
resources according to a sharing policy. On top of the
orchestration, each SP can program a customized opti-
mization of radio and transport resources within its allo-
cated slice. We have implemented network applications
for each SP, which dynamically and automatically scale
the mobile broadband service capacity up and down–
when and where needed. The trigger for scaling the
service comes from live monitoring of active cells. This
leads to improved resource eﬃciency both in RAN and
transport. Simulation results (not shown here) demon-
strate that in a realistic-scale scenario the savings in
both transport and RAN resources is around 30%.
We have implemented the complete chain of control,
orchestration and the tenant’s network applications for
the two SPs, and tested them on real hardware plat-
forms in the lab. However, for logistical reasons, we
will run the control plane of the testbed on top of an
emulated platform using realistic data-traces and trig-
gers collected from the hardware-testbed.
In summary, we demonstrate i) how SDN is applied
to orchestrate and virtualize resources across radio and
transport domains in future mobile networks, and ii)
how the joint programmatic interface can be utilized
for agile and resource-optimized service creation.
