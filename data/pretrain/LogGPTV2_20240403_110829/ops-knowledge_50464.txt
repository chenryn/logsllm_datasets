User: Hey I'm just starting out with Eric6. Is it possible to change the shell to use python 2.* instead of python3? can't find anything related to that in the preferences?
thanks
Assistant: Usually python2 interpreter is opened with the python command, and the python3 interpreter is opened with the python3 command. On linux, you may want to put #!/usr/bin/env python at the top of your code.
