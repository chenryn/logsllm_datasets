CFM Support for CCC Encapsulated Packets

IEEE 802.1ag CFM OAM Support for CCC Encapsulated Packets Overview
Layer 2 virtual private network (L2VPN) is a type of virtual private network service used to transport
customer's private Layer 2 traffic (for example, Ethernet, ATM or Frame Relay) over the service
provider's shared IP/MPLS infrastructure. The service provider edge (PE) router must have an interface
with circuit cross-connect (CCC) encapsulation to switch the customer edge (CE) traffic to the public
network.
The IEEE 802.1ag Ethernet Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) is an OAM standard used to perform
fault detection, isolation, and verification on virtual bridge LANs. M120 and MX Series routers provide
CFM support for bridge/VPLS/routed interfaces and support 802.1ag Ethernet OAM for CCC
encapsulated packets.
CFM Features Supported on Layer 2 VPN Circuits
CFM features supported on L2VPN circuits are as follows:
• Creation of up/down MEPs at any level on the CE-facing logical interfaces.
• Creation of MIPs at any level on the CE-facing logical interfaces.
• Support for continuity check, loopback, and linkrace protocol.
• Support for the Y1731 Ethernet Delay measurement protocol.
• Support for action profiles to bring the CE-facing logical interfaces down when loss of connectivity is
detected.
74
Figure 6: Layer 2 VPN Topology
To monitor the L2VPN circuit, a CFM up MEP (Level 6 in Figure 6 on page 74) can be configured on the
CE-facing logical interfaces of provider edge routers PE1 and PE2. To monitor the CE-PE attachment
circuit, a CFM down MEP can be configured on the customer logical interfaces of CE1-PE1 and CE2-
PE2 (Level 0 in Figure 6 on page 74).
Configure CFM for CCC Encapsulated Packets
The only change from the existing CLI configuration is the introduction of a new command to create a
MIP on the CE-facing interface of the PE router.

Configure Unified ISSU for 802.1ag CFM
A unified in-service software upgrade (ISSU) enables you to upgrade between two different Junos OS
releases with no disruption on the control plane and with minimal disruption of traffic. Unified ISSU is
automatically enabled for the Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) protocols and interoperates
between local and remote maintenance endpoints (MEPs).
The Junos OS provides support for unified ISSU using the loss threshold type length value (TLV), which
is automatically enabled for CFM. TLVs are described in the IEEE 802.1ag standard for CFM as a method
of encoding variable-length and optional information in a protocol data unit (PDU). The loss threshold
TLV indicates the loss threshold value of a remote MEP. The loss threshold TLV is transmitted as part of
the CFM continuity check messages.
NOTE: Starting in Junos OS Release 15.1, configuring ISSU with CFM (802.1ag) is supported only
on MX and PTX routers that support TLV. Interoperation with other vendors is not supported.
During a unified ISSU, the control plane may go down for several seconds and cause CFM continuity
check packets to get dropped. This may cause the remote MEP to detect a connectivity loss and mark
the MEP as down. To keep the MEP active during a unified ISSU, the loss threshold TLV communicates
the minimum threshold value the receiving MEP requires to keep the MEP active. The receiving MEP
parses the TLV and updates the loss threshold value, but only if the new threshold value is greater than
the locally configured threshold value.
An overview of CFM is described starting in "IEEE 802.1ag OAM Connectivity Fault Management
Overview" on page 21, and you should further observe the additional requirements described in this
topic.
Table 6 on page 76 shows the Loss Threshold TLV format.

Table 6: Loss Threshold TLV Format
Parameter Octet (sequence) Description
Type=31 1 Required. Required. If 0, no Length or Value fields follow. If not 0,
at least the Length field follows the Type field.
Length=12 2 Required if the Type field is not 0. Not present if the Type field is
0. The 16 bits of the Length field indicate the size, in octets, of the
Value field. 0 in the Length field indicates that there is no Value
field.
OUI 3 Optional. Organization unique identifier (OUI), which is controlled
by the IEEE and is typically the first three bytes of a MAC address
(Juniper OUI 0x009069).
Subtype 1 Optional. Organizationally defined subtype.
Value 4 Optional. Loss threshold value.
Flag 4 Optional. Bit0 (identifies an ISSU is in progress)
Bit1-31 (reserved)
Junos OS provides configuration support for the convey-loss-threshold statement, allowing you to control
the transmission of the loss threshold TLV in continuity check messages PDUs. The convey-loss-threshold
statement specifies that the loss threshold TLV must be transmitted as part of the continuity check
messages. If the convey-loss-threshold statement is not specified, continuity check messages transmit this
TLV only when a unified ISSU is in progress. The Junos OS provides this configuration at the continuity-
check level. By default, continuity check messages do not include the loss threshold TLV.
To configure the convey loss threshold, use the convey-loss-threshold statement at the [edit protocols oam
ethernet connectivity-fault-management maintenance-domain identifier maintenance-association identifier
continuity-check] hierarchy level.
For the remote MEP, the loss threshold TLV is transmitted only during the unified ISSU if the convey-loss-
threshold statement is not configured. The remote MEP switches back to the default loss threshold if no
loss threshold TLV is received or the TLV has a default threshold value of 3.
77
An example of the ISSU configuration statements follows:
protocols {
oam {
ethernet {
connectivity-fault-management {
maintenance-domain identifier {
level number;
maintenance-association identifier {
continuity-check {
convey-loss-threshold;
interval number;
loss-threshold number;
hold-interval number;
}
}
}
}
}
}
}
The Junos OS saves the last received loss threshold TLV from the remote MEP. You can display the last
saved loss threshold TLV that is received by the remote MEP, using the show oam ethernet connectivity-
fault-management mep-database maintenance-domain identifier maintenance-association identifier local-mep
identifier remote-mep identifier command, as in the following example:

the show oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management mep-database maintenance-domain identifier maintenance-
association identifier local-mep identifier remote-mep identifier command, as in the following example:
