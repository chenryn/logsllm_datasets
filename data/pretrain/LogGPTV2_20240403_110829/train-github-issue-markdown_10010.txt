## üìù Provide a description of the new feature
## _What is the expected behavior of the proposed feature? What is the
scenario this would be used?_
This is for the Fancy Zones module. This feature would let users assign
shortcuts to move the active window to a specific zone of a layout.  
For example: If a layout has four zones that are divided right at the center
of the screen, and having assigned four shortcuts,  
for example:  
ctrl + alt + 9 for top right  
ctrl + alt + 7 for top left  
ctrl + alt + 3 for bottom right  
ctrl + alt + 1 for bottom left  
pressing any of the above shortcut would move the active window the zone
specific to that shortcut.
