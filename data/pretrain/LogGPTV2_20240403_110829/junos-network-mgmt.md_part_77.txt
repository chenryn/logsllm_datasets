analytics status commands to view the global interface configuration and status and that of specific
interfaces. The output that is displayed depends on your configuration at the global interface and
specific interface levels. For example:
• A global interface configuration (for all interfaces) to disable monitoring supersedes the configuration
to enable it on an interface.
• The interface configuration to enable or disable monitoring supersedes the global interface
configuration, unless monitoring had been disabled globally for all interfaces.
• If there is no configuration, whether for all interfaces or a specific interface, monitoring is disabled by
default (see Table 115 on page 953).
Table 115 on page 953 describes the correlation between the user configuration and the settings that
are displayed.

Configure Queue and Traffic Monitoring
Network analytics queue and traffic monitoring provides visibility into the performance and behavior of
the data center infrastructure. This feature collects data from the switch, analyzes the data using
955
sophisticated algorithms, and captures the results in reports. You can use the reports to help
troubleshoot problems, make decisions, and adjust resources as needed.
You enable queue and traffic monitoring by first defining a resource profile template, and then applying
the profile to the system (for a global configuration) or to individual interfaces.
NOTE: You can configure queue and traffic monitoring on physical network interfaces only;
logical interfaces and Virtual Chassis physical (VCP) interfaces are not supported.
NOTE: The procedure to configure queue and traffic monitoring on a QFX Series standalone
switch requires Junos OS Release 13.2X51-D15 or later to be installed on your device.
To configure queue monitoring on a QFX Series standalone switch:
1. Configure the queue monitoring polling interval (in milliseconds) globally (for the system):
[edit]
set services analytics resource system polling-interval queue-monitoring interval
2. Configure a resource profile for the system, and enable queue monitoring:
[edit]
set services analytics resource-profiles profile-name queue-monitoring
3. Configure high and low values of the depth-threshold (in bytes) for queue monitoring in the system
profile:
[edit]
set services analytics resource-profiles profile-name depth-threshold high number low number
For both high and low values, the range is from 1 to 1,250,000,000 bytes, and the default value is 0
bytes.
NOTE: You can configure either the depth-threshold or latency threshold for the system, but
not both.
956
4. Apply the resource profile template to the system for a global configuration:
[edit]
set services analytics resource system resource-profile profile-name
5. Configure an interface-specific resource profile and enable queue monitoring for the interface:
[edit]
set services analytics resource-profiles profile-name queue-monitoring
6. Configure the latency-threshold (high and low values) for queue monitoring in the interface-specific
profile:
[edit]
set services analytics resource-profiles profile-name latency-threshold high number low number
For both high and low values, the range is from 1 to 100,000,000 nanoseconds, and the default value
is 1,000,000 nanoseconds.
NOTE: You can configure either the depth-threshold or latency threshold for interfaces, but
not both.
7. Apply the resource profile template for interfaces to one or more interfaces:
[edit]
set services analytics resource interfaces interface-name resource-profile profile-name
NOTE: If a conflict arises between the system and interface configurations, the interface-
specific configuration supersedes the global (system) configuration.
To configure traffic monitoring on a QFX Series standalone switch:
957
1. Configure the traffic monitoring polling interval (in seconds) for the system:
[edit]
set services analytics resource system polling-interval traffic-monitoring interval
2. Configure a resource profile for the system, and enable traffic monitoring in the profile:
[edit]
set services analytics resource-profiles profile-name traffic-monitoring
3. Apply the resource profile to the system for a global configuration:
[edit]
set services analytics resource system resource-profile profile-name
4. Configure a resource profile for interfaces, and enable traffic monitoring in the profile:
[edit]
set services analytics resource-profiles profile-name traffic-monitoring
NOTE: If a conflict arises between the system and interface configurations, the interface-
specific configuration supersedes the global (system) configuration.
5. Apply the resource profile template to one or more interfaces:
[edit]
set services analytics resource interfaces interface-name resource-profile profile-name
Configure a Local File for Network Analytics Data
The network analytics feature provides visibility into the performance and behavior of the data center
infrastructure. This feature collects data from the switch, analyzes the data using sophisticated
algorithms, and captures the results in reports. Network administrators can use the reports to help
troubleshoot problems, make decisions, and adjust resources as needed.
958
To save the queue and traffic statistics data in a local file, you must configure a filename to store it.
NOTE: The procedure to configure a local file for storing queue and traffic monitoring statistics
requires Junos OS Release 13.2X51-D15 or later to be installed on your device.
To configure a local file for storing queue and traffic monitoring statistics:
1. Configure a filename:
[edit]
set services analytics collector local file filename
There is no default filename. If you do not configure a filename, network analytics statistics are not
saved locally.
2. Configure the number of files (from 2 to 1000 files):
[edit]
set services analytics collector local file filename files number
3. Configure the file size (from 10 to 4095 MB) in the format of xm:
[edit]
set services analytics collector local file an size size
Configure a Remote Collector for Streaming Analytics Data
The network analytics feature provides visibility into the performance and behavior of the data center
infrastructure. This feature collects data from the switch, analyzes the data using sophisticated
algorithms, and captures the results in reports. Network administrators can use the reports to help
troubleshoot problems, make decisions, and adjust resources as needed.
You can configure an export profile to define the stream format and type of data, and one or more
remote servers (collectors) to receive streaming network analytics data.
959
NOTE: The procedure to configure a collector for receiving streamed analytics data requires
Junos OS Release 13.2X51-D15 or later to be installed on your device.
To configure a collector for receiving streamed analytics data:
1. Create an export profile and specify the stream format:
[edit]
set services analytics export-profiles profile-name stream-format format
2. Configure the export profile to include interface information:
[edit]
set services analytics export-profiles profile-name interface information
3. Configure the export profile to include interface queue statistics:
[edit]
set services analytics export-profiles profile-name interface statistics queue
4. Configure the export profile to include interface traffic statistics:
[edit]
set services analytics export-profiles profile-name interface statistics traffic
5. Configure the export profile to include interface status link information:
[edit]
set services analytics export-profiles profile-name interface status link
6. Configure the export profile to include system information:
[edit]
set services analytics export-profiles profile-name system information
960
7. Configure the export profile to include system queue status:
[edit]
set services analytics export-profiles profile-name system status queue
8. Configure the export profile to include system traffic status:
[edit]
set services analytics export-profiles profile-name system status traffic
9. Configure the transport protocol for the collector addresses and apply the export profile:
[edit]
set services analytics collector address ip-address port port transport protocol export-
profile profile-name
set services analytics collector address ip-address port port transport protocol export-
profile profile-name
NOTE: If you configure the tcp or udp option for the JSON, CSV, and TSV formats, you must
also set up the TCP or UDP client software on the remote collector to process records that
are separated by the newline character (\n) on the remote server.
If you configure the tcp or udp option for the GPB format, you must also set up the TCP or
UDP build streaming server using the analytics.proto file.
