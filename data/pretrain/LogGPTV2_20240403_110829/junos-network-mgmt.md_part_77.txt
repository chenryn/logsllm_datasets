### Analytics Status Commands and Configuration

#### Overview
Analytics status commands are used to view the global interface configuration and status, as well as the status of specific interfaces. The output displayed depends on the configuration at both the global and specific interface levels.

#### Configuration Precedence
- **Global Interface Configuration**: A global configuration to disable monitoring supersedes any configuration to enable it on a specific interface.
- **Specific Interface Configuration**: The configuration to enable or disable monitoring on a specific interface supersedes the global interface configuration, unless monitoring is disabled globally for all interfaces.
- **Default Setting**: If there is no configuration, whether for all interfaces or a specific interface, monitoring is disabled by default.

#### Network Analytics Queue and Traffic Monitoring

**Overview**
Network analytics queue and traffic monitoring provides visibility into the performance and behavior of the data center infrastructure. This feature collects data from the switch, analyzes the data using sophisticated algorithms, and captures the results in reports. These reports can be used to troubleshoot problems, make decisions, and adjust resources as needed.

**Configuration Steps**

1. **Queue Monitoring on a QFX Series Standalone Switch:**
   - **Step 1**: Configure the queue monitoring polling interval (in milliseconds) globally:
     ```shell
     [edit]
     set services analytics resource system polling-interval queue-monitoring interval
     ```
   - **Step 2**: Create a resource profile for the system and enable queue monitoring:
     ```shell
     [edit]
     set services analytics resource-profiles profile-name queue-monitoring
     ```
   - **Step 3**: Set high and low values of the depth-threshold (in bytes) for queue monitoring in the system profile:
     ```shell
     [edit]
     set services analytics resource-profiles profile-name depth-threshold high number low number
     ```
     - Range: 1 to 1,250,000,000 bytes
     - Default: 0 bytes
   - **Step 4**: Apply the resource profile template to the system for a global configuration:
     ```shell
     [edit]
     set services analytics resource system resource-profile profile-name
     ```
   - **Step 5**: Create an interface-specific resource profile and enable queue monitoring for the interface:
     ```shell
     [edit]
     set services analytics resource-profiles profile-name queue-monitoring
     ```
   - **Step 6**: Set the latency-threshold (high and low values) for queue monitoring in the interface-specific profile:
     ```shell
     [edit]
     set services analytics resource-profiles profile-name latency-threshold high number low number
     ```
     - Range: 1 to 100,000,000 nanoseconds
     - Default: 1,000,000 nanoseconds
   - **Step 7**: Apply the resource profile template for interfaces to one or more interfaces:
     ```shell
     [edit]
     set services analytics resource interfaces interface-name resource-profile profile-name
     ```

2. **Traffic Monitoring on a QFX Series Standalone Switch:**
   - **Step 1**: Configure the traffic monitoring polling interval (in seconds) for the system:
     ```shell
     [edit]
     set services analytics resource system polling-interval traffic-monitoring interval
     ```
   - **Step 2**: Create a resource profile for the system and enable traffic monitoring in the profile:
     ```shell
     [edit]
     set services analytics resource-profiles profile-name traffic-monitoring
     ```
   - **Step 3**: Apply the resource profile to the system for a global configuration:
     ```shell
     [edit]
     set services analytics resource system resource-profile profile-name
     ```
   - **Step 4**: Create a resource profile for interfaces and enable traffic monitoring in the profile:
     ```shell
     [edit]
     set services analytics resource-profiles profile-name traffic-monitoring
     ```
   - **Step 5**: Apply the resource profile template to one or more interfaces:
     ```shell
     [edit]
     set services analytics resource interfaces interface-name resource-profile profile-name
     ```

#### Local File Configuration for Network Analytics Data

**Overview**
To save queue and traffic statistics data in a local file, you must configure a filename to store it.

**Configuration Steps**

1. **Configure a Filename:**
   ```shell
   [edit]
   set services analytics collector local file filename
   ```
   - There is no default filename. If not configured, network analytics statistics are not saved locally.

2. **Configure the Number of Files:**
   ```shell
   [edit]
   set services analytics collector local file filename files number
   ```
   - Range: 2 to 1000 files

3. **Configure the File Size:**
   ```shell
   [edit]
   set services analytics collector local file filename size size
   ```
   - Range: 10 to 4095 MB
   - Format: `xm`

#### Remote Collector Configuration for Streaming Analytics Data

**Overview**
You can configure an export profile to define the stream format and type of data, and one or more remote servers (collectors) to receive streaming network analytics data.

**Configuration Steps**

1. **Create an Export Profile and Specify the Stream Format:**
   ```shell
   [edit]
   set services analytics export-profiles profile-name stream-format format
   ```

2. **Include Interface Information in the Export Profile:**
   ```shell
   [edit]
   set services analytics export-profiles profile-name interface information
   ```

3. **Include Interface Queue Statistics in the Export Profile:**
   ```shell
   [edit]
   set services analytics export-profiles profile-name interface statistics queue
   ```

4. **Include Interface Traffic Statistics in the Export Profile:**
   ```shell
   [edit]
   set services analytics export-profiles profile-name interface statistics traffic
   ```

5. **Include Interface Status Link Information in the Export Profile:**
   ```shell
   [edit]
   set services analytics export-profiles profile-name interface status link
   ```

6. **Include System Information in the Export Profile:**
   ```shell
   [edit]
   set services analytics export-profiles profile-name system information
   ```

7. **Include System Queue Status in the Export Profile:**
   ```shell
   [edit]
   set services analytics export-profiles profile-name system status queue
   ```

8. **Include System Traffic Status in the Export Profile:**
   ```shell
   [edit]
   set services analytics export-profiles profile-name system status traffic
   ```

9. **Configure the Transport Protocol for the Collector Addresses and Apply the Export Profile:**
   ```shell
   [edit]
   set services analytics collector address ip-address port port transport protocol export-profile profile-name
   ```
   - For JSON, CSV, and TSV formats, if TCP or UDP is configured, set up the TCP or UDP client software on the remote collector to process records separated by the newline character (\n).
   - For GPB format, set up the TCP or UDP build streaming server using the `analytics.proto` file.
