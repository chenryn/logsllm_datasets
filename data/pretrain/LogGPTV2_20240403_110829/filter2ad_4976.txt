ABSTRACT
A social news site presents user-curated content, ranked
by popularity. Popular curators like Reddit, or Facebook
have become eﬀective way of crowdsourcing news or shar-
ing for personal opinions. Traditionally, these services re-
quire a centralized authority to aggregate data and deter-
mine what to display. However, the trust issues that arise
from a centralized system are particularly damaging to the
“Web democracy” that social news sites are meant to pro-
vide.
In this poster, we present cliq, a decentralized social news
curator. cliq is a P2P based social news curator that pro-
vides private and unbiased reporting. All users in cliq share
responsibility for tracking and providing popular content.
Any user data that cliq needs to store is also managed across
the network. We ﬁrst inform our design of cliq through an
analysis of Reddit. We design a way to provide content cu-
ration without a persistent moderator, or usernames.

1. MOTIVATION
Unlike other media, content shown on social media sites is
determined by a “Web democracy”, open to anyone. How-
ever, the trust issues that arise from a centralized system
are particularly damaging to this goal. Users must accept
that owners of these sites have the power to present content
aligned with their own agenda. For example, BBC news
recently reported that moderators of the subreddit “tech-
nology” were censoring posts that included banned words
such as “bitcoin” or “net neutrality”1.

Further, centralized management of user data leads to
concerns of personal information being sold or intruded upon.
In recent years, citizens have learned of government pro-
grams in multiple countries that crawl the web and archive
information oﬀ of such websites. In fact, there exist multi-
ple public services that given a username, scrape reddit and
analyze the user’s behavior; even showing the topics most
participated in and “Fun Guessed Data” such as if the user
supports Occupy Wall Street2. Oppressive governments may
act on such data, tracking individuals. Such a threat can af-
fect a user’s willingness to share content that is political or
controversial.
An eﬀective, fair and safe Web democracy should (i) present
content that is relevant to the user’s interests and (ii) pop-
ular, be (iii) resilience to biased reporting and (iv) to user
data aggregation. Existing social news sites have provided
an eﬀective way to accomplish the ﬁrst two goals. However,
their centralized nature raises concerns about content bias
and users privacy. cliq leverages the anonymity and auton-
omy that a decentralized systems provides to fulﬁll these
additional requirements.
2. CLIQ ARCHITECTURE
We now present the design of cliq, a fully-distributed so-
cial news site. By using a P2P model, the responsibility
of tracking content and popularity is randomly distributed
among peers. We remove the need for a (potentially biased)
dedicated moderator. To provide anonymity, Cliq users do
not have usernames. Any user information collected is dis-
tributed among random nodes and will naturally expire as
the network experiences churn. A fully decentralized user
content curator, however, presents its own challenges.
2.1 Managing content
We organize content through cliq similarly to what is com-
mon in most social news sites; each post is associated with
one or more category tags (e.g. politics, sports, or travel).
We build cliq over Kademlia [1] a popular DHT. In the DHT,
nodes use content tags as keys to store and ﬁnd content in
the network. For each tag, a subset of nodes with similar IDs
are collectively responsible for managing its content. These
duties include storing, ranking and disseminating links up-
loaded by users with that tag, as well as monitoring for
malicious nodes.

Without registered users or the vantage point of a central-
ized system, we cannot use traditional methods of detecting
spammers. Instead, we take advantage of the fact that in
the Kademlia P2P model, a node will be routed to a tag
along the same nodes each time. Nodes along this path
can collectively enforce good behavior from the users. For
example, each node can store the set of IPs it has person-
ally seen promote each link. If a user attempts to promote
the same URL multiple times, the request will be dropped.
Many of the randomly selected nodes along the path would
need to be malicious to allow a single IP post many times.
Promoters would not have to be shared among nodes but
to further preserve privacy, storing promoters can be done
probabilistically.
2.5 Replication
As we previously saw, nodes need to be able to dynami-
cally oﬄoad responsibilities to other nodes. In cliq, a node
can request a neighbor to replicate its most popular content.
Therefore, when looking for content, a user is more likely to
ﬁnd popular posts. However, a malicious node could eas-
ily spam cliq with the ability to direct others to replicate
arbitrary data. To account for this, if a node is asked to
replicate data, it does not do so immediately. It ﬁrst waits
until it personally receives an upvote for the link to verify
that it is indeed popular content.
Upon replicating, approval rating of the post starts back
at 0. Therefore, even if enough nodes are colluding to induce
replication, we would still not expect the post to get popular.
Meanwhile, a post which is actually a trending will be able
to regain its high ratio quickly.

2.2 Load on users
As with any P2P system, we need to consider the po-
tential load placed on cliq users. To do this, we monitor
and measure activity on the social news site, reddit. We
choose reddit because of its popularity (ranked 61 globally
on Alexa) and very active user base.
Reddit is organized into user-created, topic-based “subred-
dit” communities. Subreddits serve a similar function that
tags do in cliq. We look at the distribution of the sizes of
the most popular subreddits. Among over 300,000 subred-
dits, only 212 have over 100,000 subscribers. 12 subreddits
have over 1,000,000. Although the rate of activity is small
compared to the number of subscribers, we ﬁnd that average
sized subreddits (>100,000 subscribers) can expect a pop-
ular post to gain thousands of votes within two days. We
therefore expect to perform dynamic load balancing in cliq
to account for a large variance in tag activity.
2.3 Determining popularity
In order to ﬁnd an eﬀective way for ranking content, we
analyze popular posts of multiple subreddits. Here, popular
posts refers to content on the ﬁrst four pages (100 posts)
of a subreddit. We ﬁnd that popularity of reddit posts are
strongly correlated with age of the post and it’s voting score.
Fig. 1 shows the age and score (normalized by the subreddit
size) of popular posts of the “Politics” subreddit. Among the
100 most popular posts, we rarely see posts older than two
days. This is fairly consistent among subreddits with over
100,000 subscribers.
However, ranking by score is not as straightforward, espe-
cially in cliq. Cliq tags diﬀer from subreddits in that posts
can be linked to multiple tags. However, we ﬁnd that unnor-
malized scores of popular content vary drastically between
subreddits. Therefore, a clliq node keeps track of a post’s
score and how many times it has shown this post to users.
In eﬀect, we rank posts by their “approval rate” rather than
raw score to account for varying amounts of exposure. This
feature will also be important to cliq’s resilience to spam.
