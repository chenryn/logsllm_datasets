User: I am running command-line Python scripts from the Windows taskbar by having a shortcut pointing to the Python interpreter with the actual script as a parameter.
After the script has been processed, the interpreter terminates and the output window is closed which makes it impossible to read script output.
What is the most straightforward way to keep the interpreter window open until any key is pressed?
In batch files, one can end the script with pause. The closest thing to this I found in python is raw_input() which is sub-optimal because it requires pressing the return key (instead of any key).
Assistant: The best option: os.system('pause') <-- this will actually display a message saying 'press any key to continue' whereas adding just raw_input('') will print no message, just the cursor will be available. 
not related to answer:
os.system("some cmd command") is a really great command as the command can execute any batch file/cmd commands.
