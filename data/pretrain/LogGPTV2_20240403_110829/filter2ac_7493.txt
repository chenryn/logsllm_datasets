**ATT&CK ID:** S0635  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** BoomBox

BoomBox can achieve persistence by creating a Registry value named `MicroNativeCacheSvc` under the `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` key. This ensures that the malicious payload is executed every time the user logs in. [48]

In this optimized version, I have:
1. Clearly separated the ATT&CK ID and Technique Name.
2. Improved the sentence structure for better readability.
3. Added a brief explanation of the impact of the Registry value creation.
