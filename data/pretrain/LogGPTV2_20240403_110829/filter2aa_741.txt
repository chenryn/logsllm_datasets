## Biometrics
Biometrics are unique and relatively permanent physical or behavioral characteristics used to identify or authenticate a user. Examples include:
- Fingerprints
- Hand geometry
- Vascular patterns
- Retina
- Iris
- Voice patterns

### Advantages
- Unique
- Inherent to the user
- Difficult to forget or lose
- Provides reliable authentication

### Disadvantages and Problems
- Cannot be kept secret
- Some can be copied or stolen
- Cannot be reset or revoked
- Make insecure cryptographic keys
- Common across multiple systems/organizations
- System accuracy depends on enrollment verification
- The system can be manipulated if more than one person has access to the reader or resource

## Basic Biometric Process
1. **Collection at the Biometric Sensor**: The system captures a physical or behavioral characteristic.
2. **Feature Extraction**: A template is created.
3. **Comparison**: The new template is compared with stored templates to produce a matching score.
4. **Result**: The system returns a match or non-match result.

## Identification vs. Authentication
- **Identification** tells who someone is.
- **Authentication** verifies that someone is who they claim to be.

### Types of Authentication
- Something you know (e.g., password, PIN)
- Something you have (e.g., token, card)
- Something you are (e.g., biometric)

### Template Verification
- **Identification** (One-to-many search): Does the system recognize you?
  1. User presents a characteristic to the system.
  2. User template is compared to each template in the database for a match.
- **Authentication (Verification or Positive Matching)** (One-to-one search): Are you who you claim to be?
  1. User provides a username, PIN, or other form of identification.
  2. User presents a characteristic to the system.
  3. User template is compared only to the template associated with that specific user.

### Template Matching
- Matching is approximate.
- Problems:
  - Cannot give a categorical yes or no.
  - Can only say that templates match with a confidence level (e.g., 99%).
  - Also known as loose equality or close equality.

### Error Rates
- **Type I – FRR (False Reject Rate)**: Rate at which the system denies access to a legitimate user.
- **Type II – FAR (False Acceptance Rate)**: Rate at which the system authenticates an un-enrolled user.
- **CER (Cross-over Error Rate or Equal Error Rate)**: Point at which Type I and Type II errors are equal. This is the most realistic and reasonable rate to use when comparing biometric systems.

## Attacking Biometric Systems
### General Attack Information
- Security is only as good as the weakest link.
- Try traditional attacks first (e.g., traffic replay, spoofing, password guessing, brute force).
- Examine system connections for security.
- Proprietary systems often rely on security through obscurity; download vendor’s documents and look for default passwords, SNMP strings, etc.
- Attack Windows and Unix systems part of the biometric system as you would any other.
- Know the OEM: Research known exploits against their products and those of other manufacturers sourcing from the same OEM.

### Words of Caution
- Some systems are fragile; even a simple port scan can crash them.
- Approach readers and panels with caution.
- System instability can be caused by misconfiguration (e.g., misconfigured Lantronix Micro100 serial server).
- Recommend excluding port 30718 from port scans.
- Test attacks in a lab or non-production environment if possible.

### Nine Generic Attack Points
- **Overview**: Where to attack a biometric system.
- **General Methodology**: Can be applied to all biometric systems.
- **References**: N.M. Ratha, J.H. Connell, and R.M. Bolle: “An Analysis of Minutiae Matching Strength” (8 attack points) + Ninth point.

#### Attack Points
1. **Attacking the Biometric Sensor**
   - Present a fake biometric to the sensor (e.g., gelatin fingers, iris picture, voice recording).

2. **Attacking Communications from the Biometric Sensor**
   - Intercept data sent by the sensor.
   - Send malicious data to the feature extractor.
   - Replay attack.
   - Examples: Hill Climbing attack, decoding intercepted WSQ files, injecting malicious WSQ files.

3. **Manipulating/Overriding Feature Extraction and Template Creation Process**
   - Usually an attack on software or firmware.
   - Generate a preselected template or steal generated templates.

4. **Attacking the Communication Channel Between Template Creation Unit and Comparison Unit**
   - Large threat when templates are compared on a remote system.
   - Intercept valid user templates, inject malicious templates, or perform brute force attacks.

5. **Attacking the Template Comparison Unit**
   - Modify matching software to produce artificially low or high scores.
   - Change the threshold for a successful match.
   - Can make spoofing attacks easier.

6. **Attack or Tamper with Stored Templates**
   - Steal a template, associate a malicious template with an enrolled user, or enroll a malicious user.
   - Four ways to store templates: on reader/device, central server, access card/token, or hybrid.

7. **Attacking the Transmission of Stored Templates**
   - Data can be corrupted, intercepted, or modified.
   - Sniff traffic to steal templates or inject templates to falsely authenticate a malicious user.

8. **Overriding the Final Decision**
   - If the final match decision can be overridden by an attacker, the system is defeated.

9. **Attacking the Transmission of Enrollment Templates to the Storage Location**
   - Similar to attacks at point 4 but with potentially longer-lasting effects.
   - Could permanently add a malicious template into the system.

## Example Attacks
### Simple Biometric Access Control System
- **Common Setup**: Many biometric readers store templates on the reader.
- **Steps to Authenticate a User**:
  1. User presents card or enters PIN.
  2. PIN or card number is sent to the biometric reader.
  3. Reader finds the template for the user.
  4. Reader compares templates.
  5. If they match, the PIN or card number is sent to the access control panel.
  6. If the user has access, the control panel unlocks the door.

### Using Wiegand Injection
- **Inject the Card Number of a Legitimate User**:
  - Using a Wiegand magcard reader or RS-232 to Wiegand converter.
  - Gain access to the Wiegand line, connect the reader, and send the card number.

### Defenses
- Install tamper switches on readers.
- Monitor for communication errors.
- Use high-security locks to secure readers and panels.
- Protect all Wiegand lines using hard conduit.
- Have camera coverage on all readers.

## Biometric System with Templates at a Central Location
- **Steps to Authenticate a User**:
  1. User presents card.
  2. Card number is sent to the biometric reader.
  3. Reader requests template for the user.
  4. Server sends template to the reader.
  5. Reader compares templates.
  6. If templates match, the card number is sent to the access control panel.
  7. If the user has access, the control panel unlocks the door.

### Attacking the Central Server
- **MSDE Used to Store Templates**:
  - Unpatched by default, weak SA password.
  - Steps to attack:
    1. Gain access to the database using known vulnerabilities.
    2. Locate the templates.
    3. Associate an already enrolled user template with a user who has higher access privileges.

### Defenses
- Patch and harden the system used to store templates.
- Monitor for intrusions.
- Note: PIN or card number stored in the clear in the database.
- Beware of injecting duress templates.

## Defenses: Things You Can Do
- Test systems to know their weaknesses.
- Use man traps to allow only one person to have access to the biometric reader at once.
- Monitor for false readings/failed authentication attempts.
- Harden and patch all servers and workstations in the biometric system.
- Install tamper switches on all readers.
- Activate liveliness detection on all readers.
- Combine biometrics with a second or third form of authentication.

## Defenses: Vendor Action
- Add timestamp and sequence number to data to prevent replay attacks.
- Output matching scores in wider increments to protect against Hill Climbing attacks.
- Mutually authenticate readers and panels/backend servers.
- Encrypt all data transmissions using proven encryption algorithms.
- Install server and workstation software as secure by default.

## Conclusion
- Use the nine attack types to locate weak points in a system.
- Try traditional attacks first.
- The only way to determine how secure a biometric system is to test it, attack it, and break it yourself.
- Physical security people will need help to do this.
