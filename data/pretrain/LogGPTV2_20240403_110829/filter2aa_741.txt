Biometrics
 Unique and (relatively) permanent physical or 
behavioral characteristic that can be used to identify 
or authenticate a user
 Examples:
 Finger prints
 Hand geometry
 Vascular patterns
 Retina
 Iris
 Voice pattern
 Advantages
 Unique
 Part of the user
 Very hard to forgot or lose
 Can provide reliable authentication
Disadvantages & Problems
 Cannot be kept secret
 Some can be copied or stolen
 Cannot be reset or revoked
 Make insecure cryptographic keys
 Common across multiple systems/organizations
 System accuracy is dependent on enrollment verification
 System can be manipulated if more than one person has 
access to the reader or resource
Basic Biometric Process
1.
Collection at the Biometric Sensor: System 
captures physical or behavioral 
characteristic
2.
Feature Extraction: Template is created
3.
Comparison: New template is compared 
with stored templates to produce a 
matching score
4.
Result: System returns a match or non-
match result
Basic Biometric Process
Identification vs. Authentication
 Identification tells who someone is
 Authentication verifies that someone is 
who he/she claims to be
 Types of authentication:
Something you know
Something you have
Something you are
Template Verification
 Identification
 One-to-many search
 Does the system recognize you?
 Steps:
 1) User presents a characteristic to the system
 2) User template is compared to each template in the database for 
a match
 Authentication (Verification or positive matching)
 One-to-one search
 Are you who you claim to be?
 Steps:
 1) User provides user name, PIN or other form of identification
 2)  User presents a characteristic to the system
 3) User template is only compared to template associated with that 
specific user
Template Matching
 Matching is approximate
 Problems with this
Can not give a categorical yes or no
Can only say that templates match with a 
confidence level of 99%
 AKA: Loose equality or close equality
Error Rates
 Type I – FRR (False Reject Rate)
 Rate at which system denies access to a 
legitimate user
 Type II – FAR (False Acceptance Rate)
 Rate at which system authenticates an un-enrolled 
user
 Important: Even without an intruder a system 
could wrongly authenticate a user
 CER: Cross-over Error Rate (Equal Error 
Rate)
 Point at which Type I and Type II errors are equal
 Most realistic and reasonable rate to use when 
comparing biometric systems
Attacking Biometric 
Systems
General Attack Information
Security is only as good as the weakest link
Try traditional attacks first
 Traffic replay
 Spoofing
 Password guessing
 Bruteforce
Examine system connections
 How secure are the connections?
Proprietary systems: security through obscurity
 Download vendor’s docs and look for default passwords, SNMP strings, etc
 Often vulnerable to traditional attacks
Attack Windows and Unix systems which are part of the biometric system 
like you would any other Windows or Unix box
Know the OEM
 Find the OEM for the device; research known exploits against their products
 Find other manufactures that source from that OEM and research exploits 
against their products
Words of Caution
 Some systems are fragile
 Even a simple portscan can crash some systems
 Approach readers and panels with caution
 System instability could be caused by 
misconfiguration
 Very common: misconfigured Lantronix Micro100 serial 
server
 Recommend excluding port 30718 from port scans
 Others are intrinsic product flaws
 If possible test attacks first in a lab or non-
production environment
Nine Generic Attack Points
 Overview of where to attack a biometric system
 General methodology can be applied to all 
biometric systems
 N.M. Ratha, J.H. Connell and R.M. Bolle: “An 
Analysis of Minutiae Matching Strength”
 8 attack points
 Ninth point
Attack Points
Type 1 Attack
Type 1 Attack
 Attacking the biometric sensor
 Present a fake biometric to the sensor that 
mimics an authorized user.
 Examples:
Fake gelatin fingers
Picture of an iris
Voice recording
Type 2 Attack
Type 2 Attack
 Attacking communications from the biometric sensor
 Not always an option: biometric sensor and feature 
extractor are sometimes combined
 Attacker can intercept data sent by sensor
 Attacker could send malicious data to the feature 
extractor
 Replay attack
 Examples:
 Hill Climbing attack
 Decoding intercepted WSQ files to make fake fingerprints
 Injecting malicious WSQ files into the system
Type 3 Attack
Type 3 Attack
 Manipulating/overriding feature extraction 
and template creation process
 Usually an attack on software or firmware
 Examples:
Generating a template preselected by the 
attacker
Steal templates generated by the system
Type 4 Attack
Type 4 Attack
 Attacking the communication channel between template 
creation unit and the comparison unit
 Large threat when templates are compared on a remote 
system
 Examples:
 Intercept a valid user template for later use
 Inject a malicious template
 Inject malicious templates to bruteforce the system
 Easier to inject bruteforce traffic here than when it leaves the 
biometric sensor
 Templates are simpler than unprocessed biometric
 Smaller keyspace
 Not a very useful attack without knowing template format
Type 5 Attack
Type 5 Attack
 Attacking the template comparison unit
 Close equality makes some attacks possible here
 Templates must be in the clear when they are compared
 Can be an attack on software, firmware or configuration
 Examples:
 Modify matching software to produce artificially low or high 
scores
 Change the threshold for a successful match
 Can make spoofing attacks easier
 End users will not notice this change because system will continue 
to authenticate them
 Some systems have a lower limit on the matching score threshold
 On some systems the setting is configurable over the network or 
configurable locally with the appropriate software package and a
PDA.
Type 6 Attack
Type 6 Attack
 Attack or tamper with stored templates
 Some systems support more than one 
template per user
Beware of duress templates(!)
 Examples:
Steal a template
Associate a malicious template with an 
already enrolled user
Enroll a malicious user
Four Ways to Store Templates
 On Reader or Device
 Quick
 No network access required
 Limited storage space
 Inconvenient manual loading
 Central Server
 Efficient management of multiple users across multiple systems
 Dependant on a network
 Backend server can be attacked
 Transportation and storage security a concern
 Access Card or Token
 Quick
 User controls the template
 Token or access card can be stolen
 Need to worry about secure storage and transmission
 Hybrid – Combination of the above
 Examples:
 Templates stored on a central server but cached on the reader
 Templates stored on a smartcard and stored on central server to make 
rebadging easier
Type 6 (Cont.)
 Central server:
 Template usually stored in a database or flat file
 Try traditional attacks 
 Access card or token
 Attacks on proximity cards
 Poor read/write protection RFID
 Acquiring a template to inject
 Steal from a central server, card or reader
 Buy a reader and create your own templates
 Template created on company X, model Y systems will work 
on all model Y system by company X
Type 7 Attack
Type 7 Attack
 Attacking the transmission of stored templates
 Data can be corrupted, intercepted or modified
 Traffic is often unencrypted when send over Ethernet or serial 
networks
 Templates stored on cards or tokens:
 RFID usually transmits in the clear
 Parts of Mifare and HID iClass transmissions are encrypted
 Recent attack on the Texas Instruments DST chips
 Replay attacks on proximity cards
 Examples:
 Sniffing traffic to steal templates
 Injecting templates to falsely authenticate a malicious user
Type 8 Attack
Type 8 Attack
 Overriding the final decision
 If the final match decision can be 
overridden by an attacker than the system 
has been defeated
Type 9 Attack
Type 9 Attack
 Attacking the transmission of enrollment 
templates to the storage location
 Similar to attacks at point 4 but with 
potential longer lasting affects
Could permanently add malicious template 
into the system

Simple Biometric Access Control 
System
Common setup used by many 
biometric readers that store 
templates on the reader
Step to authenticate a user:
1.
User presents card or enters PIN
2.
PIN or card number is sent to the 
biometric reader
3.
Reader finds template for the user
4.
Reader compares templates
5.
If they match the PIN or card 
number are send to the access 
control panel
6.
If that user has access to that door 
the control panel unlocks the door
Using Wiegand Injection
 Inject the card number of a legitimate user into a 
Wiegand line
 Using a Wiegand magcard reader
1. Gain access to the Wiegand line for the Biometric reading
 Remove Biometric reader from wall
 Access wires in drop ceiling or other non-secure area
2. Connect the Wiegand magcard reader to the Wiegand line
3. Create a custom magcard with the card number of the user you 
wish to impersonate
4. Swipe card through reader to send card number
5. Open door
 Using a RS-232 to Wiegand converter
1. Gain access to the Wiegand line for the Biometric reading
 Remove Biometric reader from wall
 Access wires in drop ceiling or other non-secure area
2. Connect the RS-232 to Wiegand converter
3. Send card number
4. Open door
Using Wiegand Injection Defenses
 Defense:
 Install tamper switches on readers
 Monitor for communication errors from readers
 Change keycode on locks used to secure readers
 If possible use high security locks to secure readers 
and panels
 Protect all Wiegand lines using hard conduit
 Have camera coverage on all readers
Biometric System with Templates 
at a Central Location
 Step to authenticate a user:
1. User presents card
2. Card number is sent to the 
biometric reader
3. Reader request template for 
that user
4. Server sends template to the 
reader
5. Reader compares templates
6. If templates match, the card 
number is send to access 
control panel
7. If that user has access to that 
door control panel unlocks the 
door
Attacking the Central Server
MSDE used to store the templates
Unpatched by default
Weak SA password
Steps to attack the templates on the server
1.
Gain access to the database using know vulnerability
2.
Locate the templates
3.
Associate an already enrolled user template with a user who has higher 
access privileges
Defenses:
Patch and harden the system used to store the templates
Monitor for intrusions on the system
Note: PIN or card number stored in the clear in the database
Beware of injecting duress templates
Defenses: Things You Can Do
 Test systems to know their weakness so threats can be 
better mitigated
 Use man traps to allow only one person to have access 
to the biometric reader at once.
 Monitor for false readings/failed authentication attempts
 Have a camera covering each reader
 Harden and patch all servers and workstations in the 
biometric system
 Install tamper switches on all readers
 Activate liveliness detection on all readers
 Combine biometrics with a second or third form of 
authentication
Defenses: Vendor Action
 Add time stamp and sequence number to data in 
order to prevent reply attacks
 Output matching scores in wider increments to 
protect against Hill Climbing attacks
 Mutually authenticate readers and 
panels/backend servers
 Encrypt all data transmissions using proven 
encryption algorithms
 Install server and workstation software as secure 
by default
Conclusion
 Use the nine attack types to locate weak points 
in a system
 Try traditional attacks first
 Only way to determine how secure a biometric 
systems is to:
 Test it yourself
 Attack it yourself
 Break it yourself
 Physical security people will need help to do this
