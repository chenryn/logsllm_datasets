We note that Equations 2 and 3 are the same except for the ap-
proximation
λ , which is satisﬁed when the receive an-
tennas are at some distance from the source. Eq. 3 is more intuitive
since it directly articulates the spatial angle to the source, θ. Hence,
we use this form in the rest of the section for our explanation. How-
ever, Eq. 2 is more accurate at close distances from the source and
could be used directly in the implementation to avoid unnecessary
approximation noise. Indeed, the precise formulation in Eq. 2 is a
standard equation representing one or a set of hyperbolas. When
the distance is large, a hyperbola reduces to a ray pointing towards
a speciﬁc spatial direction.
2373.2 Grating Lobes
There is a tradeoff between increasing the resolution and remov-
ing the ambiguity in detecting a signal’s angle of arrival. As Fig. 3
shows, when the separation between the two antennas is greater
than λ/2, the beam pattern exhibits multiple beams, although there
is only one direction along which the signal arrives. The additional
beams are often referred to as grating lobes [24].
Here we explain the cause and characteristics of grating lobes
in the context of angle of arrival. For a particular phase difference
measured ∆φj,i, there are one or a set of spatial angles θ that satisfy
Eq. 3. Speciﬁcally, since cos θ ∈ [−1, 1], when D ≤ λ/2, k can
take only one value which is 0. Thus, in this case, we can derive a
∆φj,i
unique angle of arrival θ = arccos( λ
2π ), which means we will
D
observe a single beam in the antenna pair’s beam pattern.
∆φj,i

As D increases, the number of possible k values increases. For
D = K λ
2 , the number of possible values k can take is K. Hence,
there are K different values of θ that will satisfy Eq. 3: θ =
arccos( λ
D ), only one of which refers to the actual angle of
D
arrival. This is where ambiguity arises. We will see multiple beams
(i.e., grating lobes) in the antenna pair’s beam pattern correspond-
ing to the multiple spatial angles. In summary, each grating lobe
corresponds to one spatial direction θ, and the number of grating
lobes increases linearly with the antenna separation D.
3.3 Resolution and Robustness to Noise
Since grating lobes cause ambiguity in deciding the actual angle
of arrival, they are typically considered detrimental and past RF
localization systems try to avoid them by imposing the constraint
that adjacent antennas must be separated by no more than λ
2 [41,
39]. However, while grating lobes introduce ambiguity, there are
two properties about grating lobes that are highly desirable in the
context of localization: high resolution and robustness to noise.
Resolution: Let us ﬁrst look at the resolution of the spatial angle of
arrival as computed by an antenna pair with D separation. We can
rewrite Eq. 3 as
cos θ =
λ

(4)
Recall that the value we can measure is the signal’s phase differ-
ence, ∆φj,i, and the value we intend to compute is the signal’s spa-
tial angle of arrival θ. Any hardware has some resolution, δ, for how
it expresses φj,i and hence ∆φj,i. The value of δ deﬁnes the mini-
mum measurable change in ∆φj,i, and hence the ﬁnest quantization
of cos θ, i.e., its resolution. In particular, the ﬁnest quantization we
δ
have in computing cos θ is λ
2π . As the antenna separation D in-
D
creases (i.e., more grating lobes), the minimum quantization level
for expressing cos θ decreases, leading to a ﬁner resolution in esti-
mating the spatial angle θ.
Robustness to Noise: In addition to providing high resolution, grat-
ing lobes of antenna pairs with a large separation also prove to be
more robust to wireless noise. Eq. 4 represents the noise-free case.
Now let us take into consideration a phase noise term φn in the
measured phase difference:
cos θ =
λ
D
∆φj,i + φn

(5)
Eq. 5 shows that as D increases, cos θ’s sensitivity to phase noise
φn decreases linearly. To put this into perspective, when the phase
difference measurement has a φn = π
5 noise, that translates into 0.2
additive error in cos θ if D = λ
2 . But if we increase the separation
to D = 8λ, the same signal phase noise of φn = π
5 would only lead
to 0.0125 additive error in cos θ, which is minimal. Thus, the larger
the antenna pair separation is, the less effect wireless noise has on
the spatial angle of arrival, i.e., the more resilient the system is.
3.4
Intersecting Grating Lobes for Positioning
The discussion above shows that grating lobes of a widely sepa-
rated antenna pair offer high resolution and noise resilience in de-
tecting the spatial angle of a signal source. To actually localize an
RF source, we need to translate knowledge about the spatial angle
of the source into information about the source position. To do so,
we can intersect the grating lobes of multiple antenna pairs.
Consider the example in Fig. 6(a) with antennas 1, 2, 3, and 4
placed at the four corners of a square of size 8λ × 8λ.2 The goal
here is to localize the RF source marked in blue based on the phases
measured at the antennas. The 4 antennas form a total of 6 pairs as
indicated by the red lines in Fig. 6(a). Based on the phase difference
measured at each antenna pair, we can obtain a set of grating lobes
for each antenna pair. We can then intersect these grating lobes to
identify candidate point locations for the source as indicated by the
white dots in Fig. 6(a). One of these candidate locations matches
the exact location of the source (the white dot is covered by the
blue dot in the ﬁgure).
3.5 Resolving Ambiguity
Although each dot in Fig. 6(a) is very ﬁne (i.e., high resolution),
there are a number of them and we cannot tell which one includes
the actual position of the source. The challenge is to resolve the
ambiguity in positioning while maintaining the high resolution.
Multi-Resolution Filtering: One interesting observation is that in
Fig. 6(a), the intersections (i.e., white dots) are fairly sparse, i.e.,
they are far away from each other. This means that if we can ap-
ply a coarse spatial ﬁlter to them, we will be able to eliminate the
undesired intersections and resolve ambiguity.
Thus, our design of RF-IDraw adopts a multi-resolution ap-
proach – we create coarse spatial ﬁlters by leveraging the unique,
low-resolution beams of antenna pairs with small separation to re-
solve the position ambiguity caused by the high-resolution grating
lobes of the widely-separated antenna pairs. Speciﬁcally, in addi-
tion to the widely spaced antennas, we use a second set of antenna
pairs that are spaced by λ/2. Our implementation uses four addi-
tional antennas organized in two pairs  and . Since the
spacing is λ/2, each pair produces one unique wide beam. Inter-
secting the two wide beams leads to a coarse spatial ﬁlter indicated
as the white region in Fig. 6(b). We can further reﬁne this ﬁlter to
Fig. 6(c) by also utilizing all other antenna pairs, namely ,
, , and . Finally, when we overlay Fig. 6(c) as a
ﬁlter on Fig. 6(a), ambiguity is resolved and the correct position of
the RF source is uncovered, as shown in Fig. 6(d) (again, the white
dot is covered by the blue mark representing the source).
This demonstrates how RF-IDraw’s multi-resolution design
leverages the unambiguous coarse ﬁlter produced by antenna pairs
with small separation to effectively reduce the ambiguity caused by
the high-resolution grating lobes.
We note that our implementation of RF-IDraw uses two RFID
readers each equipped with 4 antennas. The ﬁrst reader is used for
the widely spaced antenna pairs, while the second reader is used for
the tightly spaced antenna pairs. We only measure the AoA using
antenna pairs that belong to the same reader. While using antenna
pairs across the two readers could further improve the resolution
of the system, in practice that would add complexity and potential
2Today’s commercial RFID reader typically has four antenna ports
and there is no phase offset between the received signals on these
ports. Hence, one can properly compare the phases measured at any
pair of antennas on the same reader.

errors because the phase offset between the two readers will need
to be calibrated or removed. Hence, in our implementation, we only
use antenna pairs within the same reader.
4. THE POWER OF GRATING LOBES FOR TRA-
JECTORY TRACING
Instead of just localizing a static device, many applications in
gaming, smart homes, and healthcare are more interested in track-
ing the trajectory of an RF source as it moves. The unique property
of RF-IDraw’s grating lobe based approach is its ability to accu-
rately detect the shape of a trajectory. In fact, this is true even in
the case where there are errors in the absolute positioning along
the trajectory. For example, one may get the initial point of where
the trajectory starts wrong by a small offset, yet the shape of RF-
IDraw’s reconstructed trajectory will still match the actual shape
of the trajectory with very high ﬁdelity. This property is desirable
for many applications, such as gesture recognition and virtual touch
screen. In these applications, it is important to recognize the gesture
or writing of the user, while a small offset in the exact location of
the gesture is tolerable.
To provide an intuition for why RF-IDraw’s design has this prop-
erty, let us start with the basic case of a standard antenna array.
Consider the scenario where the RF source is moving along a con-
tinuous trajectory. In the case of an antenna array, tracing the tra-
jectory of this source means that the antenna array’s beam will ro-
tate accordingly with the movement of the source such that it keeps
pointing towards the source. Now consider what happens when we
have grating lobes. The actual source will be on one of these grat-
ing lobes. As the source moves, the correct grating lobe will rotate
such that it continues to track the source direction. However, since
all grating lobes rotate together, they will all follow the movement
of the source. Hence, even if one makes the wrong assumption that
the source lies on a particular grating lobe which differs from the
correct one, this wrong grating lobe’s motion (i.e., rotation in par-
ticular) does not fundamentally differ from the motion of the correct
grating lobe as it tracks the source direction.
To illustrate this property, Fig. 7(a) shows what happens when we
pick the correct grating lobe and also for the cases where we pick
wrong grating lobes adjacent to the correct one. Speciﬁcally, this
ﬁgure shows a trajectory that follows the handwriting of the letter
’q’, the ground truth of which is shown in black. Fig. 7(a) shows
the reconstructed trajectories for nine different sets of grating lobes.
The trajectory in the center is reconstructed by tracking the motion
of the correct set of grating lobes. The other eight trajectories are
reconstructed by using wrong grating lobes adjacent to the correct
ones. As we can see, although the absolute positions have an offset,
the shapes of the trajectories remain accurate and the letter ’q’ can
still be easily recognized. This demonstrates the point that even if
we end up tracking the motion of a wrong grating lobe, which is not
too far away from the correct one, the shape of the reconstructed
trajectory will still remain similar to the ground truth.
It is important to note that, the further the correct grating lobe is
from the one we pick, the more distortion there is in the shape of the
reconstructed trajectory. The reason is as follows. While all grating
lobes rotate together, (i.e., if the correct one turns with the source,
the others will turn accordingly), they do not have exactly the same
forms. Let us refer to the grating lobes in Fig. 3(c) again to better
understand this point. There we can see that the grating lobes close
to each other tend to have similar forms, while further apart grating
lobes’ forms are more different. Thus, although all grating lobes ro-
tate together, their form differences will introduce distortion to the
shape of the reconstructed trajectory, and this distortion increases
as we pick a grating lobe further away from the correct one. For
instance, Fig. 7(b) shows the reconstructed trajectory of the hand-
written ’q’ by using a set of grating lobes far away from the correct
ones. As we can see, the shape of this reconstructed trajectory is
less similar to the ground truth than the trajectories in Fig. 7(a).
This emphasizes the importance of using the multi-resolution
system in §3. Although it may not completely eliminate the am-
biguity among grating lobes in certain cases, it helps conﬁne us to a
region very close to the correct set of grating lobes, which ensures
good shape ﬁdelity.
5. ALGORITHM
In this section, we describe the algorithm behind RF-IDraw’s
multi-resolution positioning and trajectory tracing.
5.1 Multi-Resolution Positioning Algorithm
RF-IDraw’s multi-resolution positioning design is implemented
as a two-stage voting algorithm to identify the position of an RF
source. In stage 1, each antenna pair with small separation casts
one vote on each point in space, based on its belief that the RF
source is at that position. Then, the points with high total votes
from all antenna pairs with small separation will form the candidate
region to be used in stage 2. In stage 2, each antenna pair with
large separation casts one vote on each point within the candidate
region, based on its belief that the RF source is at this position.
Then the points with higher total votes from all antenna pairs will
be considered as the more likely positions for the RF source.
Now the only question is how to deﬁne the vote. First, let us con-
2 separation. Recall
sider the vote cast by each antenna pair with λ

Figure 7—Effect of Choosing Wrong Grating Lobes in Trajec-
tory Tracing: The ground truth trajectory is a handwritten ’q’ as
shown in black. When we pick a wrong grating lobe adjacent to the
correct one to track, the reconstructed trajectory has a very similar
shape as the actual shape, despite the absolute position offset, as (a)
shows. However, if we end up tracking a wrong set of grating lobes
far away from the correct ones, the distortion in the shape will be
large, rendering the letter difﬁcult to recognize, as (b) shows.
that an antenna pair with λ
2 separation has one beam. We let the an-
tenna pair vote on a point in space based on how far the point is from
the antenna pair’s beam center. In particular, the vote is designed to
be less or equal to 0. When the point lies along the direction of the
center of the beam, the vote is 0; as it gets further away from the
beam center, the vote becomes lower (i.e., more negative).
For example, consider the beam of an antenna pair in Fig. 8,
whose center is shown as the red solid line. This antenna pair’s
votes on P1 and P2 will both be 0 because they lie along the beam
center, while P3 and P4 will have a lower vote because they are
