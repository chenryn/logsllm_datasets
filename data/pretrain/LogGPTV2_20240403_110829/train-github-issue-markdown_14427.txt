Many comments in the .less-Files start with `//**` which in a lot of
programming languages is equal to a multi-column comment (`/* ... */`).
Therefore any IDE not perfectly adjusted to LESS syntax highlighting (such as
VisualStudio) tend to interpret these comments as multi-column, which is in
the case of the bootstrap sources basically _every_ following line, making the
code more or less unreadable.
Sure, an answer to this request could be "go and set up a proper highlighting"
ðŸ˜‰ But in the end this would be a _very minor change without drawbacks_ (afaik)
but nevertheless improving usability of the bootstrap sources.
An example of what I mean is in _variables.less_ , line 27:  
`//** Background color for ``.`  
which without any effort could be changed to  
`// ** Background color for ``.` (note the added space in col 3)
