User: I wrote python software that requires both german and english input. Currently, I am using the Mac shortcut cmd-space to quickly change keyboard layouts, but I need to do this hundreds of times, which slows things down. Since I know exactly when English vs German input is needed, is there a way to programmatically change the keyboard language in python? 
I am using Mac OS X Yosemite.
Assistant: Calling xkbswitch from python using subprocess would probably be easier than the other solutions you find here.
