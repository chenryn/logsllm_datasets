Question: "In reviewing a web application's client-side code, you have encountered an ActionScript function that interacts with external resources. Based on security best practices, which of the following approaches would be most secure to prevent exploitation through unsafe methods like `getURL()`?"
 "A": "Using `getURL(_root.URI, '_targetFrame');` where `_root.URI` is a variable populated from a query string parameter."
 "B": "Implementing server-side validation of all URIs before they are passed to `getURL()`."
 "C": "Restricting the `getURL()` function to only load URIs that lead to static content hosted on the same domain."
 "D": "Replacing `getURL()` with `navigateToURL()` and using URIs provided by the client as parameters without additional validation."
Answer: B
