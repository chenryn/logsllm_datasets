After experimenting with Flutter on my personal computer, I have concluded that it is a powerful tool for developing enterprise mobile applications. However, I encountered an issue when attempting to use Flutter in an environment where all users are behind a firewall and the internal network uses a self-signed certificate.

### Problem Description
When running `flutter doctor -v` or `flutter create -v flutter_test_app`, I receive the following error:
```
> flutter doctor -v  
>  Updating flutter tool...  
>  Got TLS error trying to find package archive at https://pub.dartlang.org.  
>  Error: Unable to 'pub upgrade' flutter tool. Retrying in five seconds...  
>  timeout: invalid time interval '/t'
```

This problem arises because the self-signed certificate used internally by the client's network is not recognized by Flutter. This is a common issue in many organizations, especially those with strict security policies.

### Common Solutions in Other Tools
Many open-source tools, such as npm, provide a workaround for this issue. For example, in npm, you can set the environment variable `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` to bypass certificate checking during installation. This solution is widely accepted and used in the open-source community.

### Security Considerations
While bypassing certificate checks might seem risky, it is important to note that the self-signed certificate is only a potential vulnerability within the firewall. If a bad actor is already inside the firewall, a man-in-the-middle attack is the least of the organization's concerns. The risk of a malicious entity between my computer and the firewall is minimal compared to the overall security of the internal network.

### Previous Attempts to Address the Issue
In previous reports, the Flutter team has responded that they will not allow bypassing certificate checks, citing their commitment to security best practices. They suggested downloading the Flutter tools entirely, which should eliminate the need for online package retrieval. However, I have not been able to successfully implement this solution and have not found clear instructions on the Flutter documentation.

### Request for a Solution
I would like to know if there is a viable solution to this issue. My inability to resolve it may be due to my lack of expertise, but I believe a practical workaround could benefit many developers working in similar environments.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Sit behind a firewall where self-signed certificates are used internally.
2. Download and install Flutter.
3. Run either:
   - `flutter doctor -v`
   - `flutter create -v flutter_test_app`

### Logs
```

>  Updating flutter tool...

>  Error: Unable to 'pub upgrade' flutter tool. Retrying in five seconds...

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
