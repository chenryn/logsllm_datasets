After having played with Flutter a bit from my home computer, I have decided
that it is a great tool for developing Enterprise mobile apps for a client.
The client has all its users behind a firewall, and they use a self-signed
certificate on the inside of said firewall.
This means flutter doesn't work. You get the following output
> flutter doctor -v  
>  Updating flutter tool...  
>  Got TLS error trying to find package archive at https://pub.dartlang.org.  
>  Error: Unable to 'pub upgrade' flutter tool. Retrying in five seconds...  
>  timeout: invalid time interval '/t'
Now, this is quite a common problem, and there is no possible way you can
convince some of the companies and government agencies using this method that
they are wrong. Whether they are or not is also debatable. The self-signed
certificate is only a "voulnerability" on the inside of the firewall, and if
you have a bad actor on the inside of your firewall, a man in the middle
attack is the least of your worries.
All other teams in the OSS community has solved this problem by allowing their
tools to bypass this kind of certificate checking during installation. In npm
you can set the environment variable NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 and you
are fine.
Is this crazy? Certainly not. The only "danger" area is if there is a bad
actor somewhere between my computer and the firewall, and as I said, then I
have far more severe problems
When previously reporting this I have received a response along the lines of
"we will never allow this with flutter since the flutter team of developers
are the only sane developers in the world, and all others are blithering
idiots, particularly the node and git teams who have no problems with enabling
word-destroying, no, universe-melting insane solutions like this".
Also, in my previous report of this issue, it was said it was solved because
you can download the flutter tools entirely, removing the need for... I have
not been able to do anything to solve this, and have not found any information
on flutter.io that explains how I can get around this. My inability may
certainly be a result of me being a blithering idiot, a lot of my problems
are, but is there a solution for this? I would like to know.
## Steps to Reproduce
  1. Sit behind a firewall where self-signed certificates are used on the inside
  2. Download and install flutter  
3a. Run flutter doctor -v or  
3b. Run flutter create -v flutter_test_app
