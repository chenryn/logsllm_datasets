creating component to recreate the descriptor via R0. After
recreation, the server stub replays the previous invocation
using the recovered descriptor.
This mechanism is a case where SuperGlue not only orches-
trates recovery through interfaces, but also uses additional
logic in those interfaces that is cognizant of erroneous return
values to interact with the storage component. In C3, explicit
code to interact with storage components was required. With
SuperGlue, such code is not required.
• G1: Recovery with Resource Data. When there is resource
data (Dr (cid:4)= ∅) it is redundantly stored within a storage
component that needs to be introspected to restore the data
for the resource. For example, a ﬁle’s data (shared buffer
references) can be stored in a storage component, and retrieved
when the ﬁle is accessed and not found.
Though the same trick as for G0 can be used to recreate
the ﬁle using an erroneous return value-aware server stub,
thus completely automating the interactions with the storage
component, a race condition exists: when writing to a ﬁle it
is non-atomically added to the data-structures in the RamFS
and the storage component. Another thread could thus see
the RamFS’s ﬁle data, and the system could crash before the
data is saved in the storage component. Though that thread
saw the ﬁle data, upon recovery, it would be gone. Thus,
we manually add storage component interactions within the
critical region that modiﬁes the RamFS data-structures. Future
work may integrate locking into the stubs to thus make storage
component interactions automated.
Recovery with Upcalls
• U0: Recovery using Upcalls. When a descriptor is global
(Gdr), recovery uses upcalls into client components to set up
the initial state of descriptors as detailed in G0.
D. Server Recovery
Given the above taxonomy of interfaces, component model,
to the underlying system
and the mapping of the model
mechanisms, the steps for SuperGlue-assisted recovery of a
server component cr follow. They are also depicted in the top
of Figure 2 for the scheduler, ﬁle system (RamFS) and event
manager components.
1 A transient fault corrupts and crashes the component cr.
2 The hardware exception handler is vectored to the booter
component.
3 The booter micro-reboots [19] the faulty component to
memcpy a good image and bring cr into a safe state.
4 An upcall is made into the newly rebooted cr for compo-
nent re-initialization.
5 Blocked threads are woken up in the component cr eagerly
(T0) by calling the interface function I wakeup
for each
thread while inheriting the highest priority of those threads.
6 When the system switches to a thread (according to its
priority), and it attempts to execute in cr, or utilize a de-

scriptor, the client stub is activated. Here R0 conducts the
state machine-directed recovery at the executing thread’s
priority using on-demand recovery (T1). Any depended-on
descriptors are recovered (D1) ﬁrst. Dependent descriptors
are recovered (D0) when the current descriptor is termi-
nated through a function ∈ I terminate
If the executing thread ﬁnds that
is
accessing is not yet available in the server, the thread
queries the storage component to retrieve the resource data
(G1). Furthermore, if the server relies on global descriptors
that are missing, they will also be recovered (G0) from
storage components.

8 An upcall is made into the client component that originally

priorities calling I create

IV. SUPERGLUE IDL AND COMPILER
In this section, we discuss SuperGlue IDL and compiler for
producing interface-driven recovery code from the declarative
interface speciﬁcations to bridge the gap between the high-
level model of a component-based OS and the low-level
interface recovery code.
A. SuperGlue IDL
The model-based syntax for the SuperGlue IDL is intro-
duced in Table I. Syntax derived from the descriptor-resource
model uses a Boolean expression for the corresponding spec-
iﬁcation. For the speciﬁcations based on the descriptor state
machine, syntax is deﬁned using an interface function for
transitioning the descriptor state.
Syntax for the descriptor state tracking is applied directly
to the function prototypes in the header ﬁle for each server
component to enable SuperGlue to derive the tracking data
structure. This syntax indicates how to track descriptors
including what information to track, which descriptor is the
parent descriptor, and how to look up the descriptor.
Figure 3 depicts a complete example of a SuperGlue IDL
ﬁle that describes the event notiﬁcation component’s interface.
A few important notes about the language: The state machines
in the current language are implicit. Pairs of functions are used
to describe the different possible routes execution can take.
Though states could be made explicit, we leaned toward the
side of simplicity in the current SuperGlue implementation.
The descriptor and resource data are not speciﬁed in a single
location. Instead arguments and return values from interface
functions are annotated as being tracked either in the descrip-
tor, or for the resource. In each case, the compiler internally
constructs the states, and the tracking structures.
B. SuperGlue compiler
The SuperGlue IDL compiler is factored into a pipeline.
To leverage existing, well-tested code-bases, the ﬁrst stage
uses the C preprocessor. First, a normal C header (.h) ﬁle

int evt_free ( componentid_t compid , desc ( long evtid ));

is generated by deﬁning many of the SuperGlue language
syntactic features as nil. Second, the preprocessor is used to
tokenize each aspect of the SuperGlue ﬁle, adding attributes
to variables and functions. A front end parser1 parses the
resulting ﬁle, then extracts the speciﬁcations from the abstract
syntax tree into an intermediate representation that encodes
the resource-descriptor and state machine models. With this
representation, the shortest path through the state machine is
found to each state. The back end is implemented as a network
of templates associated with predicates. The templates imple-
ment the logic of the recovery mechanisms, and include calls
to other templates. The predicates encode those aspects of the
model that map to the recovery mechanisms as discussed in
Section III-C. Templates are only included in the generated
code if the predicate evaluates to true given the intermediate
representation of the models. The SuperGlue compiler uses
code templates to keep the back end easy to understand and
maintain. The back-end is executed twice with two different
sets of template inputs, once to generate the client stub, and
one to generate the server. In total, the SuperGlue compiler
includes 72 template-predicate pairs.
