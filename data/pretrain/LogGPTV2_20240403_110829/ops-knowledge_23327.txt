User: I'm under the impressions that Python runs in the Triforce smoothly. A program that runs in Windows will run in Linux. Is this sentiment correct?
Having said that, if I create my application in QT For Windows, will it run flawlessly in Linux/Mac as well?
Thanks.
Assistant: As the others said, everything which is done using Qt-Functionality will most likely run quite flawlessly, WHEN you dont use platform specific functionality of qt.
There isnt that much (most of it has to do with window-manager stuff) , but some things might not work on other systems. 
But such things are surely mentiond in the documentation of Qt.
Still there are things which cant be done using Qt, so you will have to do that yourself using plain Python...
Yeah "Python" itself is platform-independent (well it should), but there are lots of other things involved ... well mainly the OS.
And how the OS reacts you will plainly have to findout yourself by testing the application on all target OS.
Recently i wrote an quite simple GUI-application, while it ran flawlessy on Windows, it didnt run on Linux, because on Linux Python interpreted files encoded in unicode differently than on Windows.
Additionally a small script which should return the hostname of the machine, which it did on Windows, only returned "localhost" on Linux, which was obviously not what i wanted.
