This issue appears to be very similar to issue #1263 .
I'm running celery 3.0.21 on both a Window XP and Linux virtual machine.
Whenever a task is dispatched to the Windows VM, I will get the same error as
reported in #1263, which was reported fixed in 3.0.18. When the same task is
dispatched to the Linux VM, no error occurs.
Here's some output from the Windows VM:
    [2013-08-07 22:24:32,887: DEBUG/MainProcess] Task accepted: scanworker.tasks.pan
    da[ca2db5cc-37a6-4b61-b5a0-c7a414494b10] pid:3700
    [2013-08-07 22:24:32,887: ERROR/MainProcess] Task scanworker.tasks.panda[ca2db5c
    c-37a6-4b61-b5a0-c7a414494b10] raised exception: Task of kind 'scanworker.tasks.
    panda' is not registered, please make sure it's imported.
    Traceback (most recent call last):

        raise self.NotRegistered(key)
    NotRegistered: 'scanworker.tasks.panda'
celeryctl believes that the task is, in fact, registered on the Windows VM, so
there's a discrepancy here. vmuser-1c6d67f6 in the following printout refers
to the Windows VM.
    (msvirtualenv)vagrant@precise64:~/MassScan$ DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=scaggr.settings_dev celeryctl inspect registered --config=masterceleryconfig
    [ SNIP ] 
    -> vmuser-1c6d67f6: OK
    [ SNIP ]
        * scanworker.tasks.panda [routing_key=panda]
    [ SNIP ]
The same output appears in the terminal window for both the VM generating the
tasks (a Linux VM) as well as the terminal window on the Windows VM that is
receiving the tasks. All outputs resulting from celeryctl indicate that the
"scanworker.tasks.panda" task is registered.
Thanks for taking a look!
