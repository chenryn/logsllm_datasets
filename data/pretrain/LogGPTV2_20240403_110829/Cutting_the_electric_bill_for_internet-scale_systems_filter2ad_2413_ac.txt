# 3.3 Price Differentials

## Overview
Figure 9 illustrates the hourly price differentials for two pairs of locations over an eight-day period. Both pairs have mean differentials close to zero. The three locations are geographically distant and belong to different Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs). We observe significant price spikes (with some extending far off the scale, the largest being $1,900) and extended periods of price asymmetry. This suggests that a pre-determined assignment of clients to servers is not optimal.

### Differential Distributions
To achieve substantial savings with a dynamic approach compared to a static solution, the price differential between two locations must vary over time. Ideally, this distribution should have a zero mean and a reasonably high variance. Such a distribution implies that neither site is strictly better than the other, but a dynamic solution, always buying from the least expensive site, could yield meaningful savings. Additionally, the dynamic approach can be beneficial when dealing with uncorrelated periods of price elevation in different locations.

### Examples and Analysis
- **Palo Alto - Virginia**: The California-Virginia distribution (Figure 10a) has a zero mean and high variance.
- **Austin - Virginia**: The Texas-Virginia distribution (Figure 10b) also has a zero mean and high variance.
- **Boston - NYC**: This distribution is skewed, as Boston tends to be cheaper than NYC, but NYC is less expensive 36% of the time. Savings greater than $10/MWh occur 18% of the time, indicating an opportunity for dynamic exploitation.
- **Chicago - Virginia**: Virginia is less expensive only 8% of the time, and the savings almost never exceed $10/MWh, making dynamic adaptation unnecessary.
- **Chicago - Peoria**: The distribution shows the dispersion introduced by a market boundary, making it dynamically exploitable.

### Evolution Over Time
Price differential distributions are not static and change over time. Figure 11 shows the monthly variations in the PaloAlto-Virginia distribution, revealing sustained price asymmetries that may last for many months before reversing. The spread of prices can also double from one month to the next.

### Time-of-Day Dependencies
Price differentials also depend on the time of day. For example, peak demand in California and Virginia does not overlap due to different time zones, which significantly shapes the price differential. Figure 12 illustrates the hourly dependency for three location pairs:
- **PaloAlto - Virginia**: Before 5 AM (Eastern), Virginia has a significant edge; by 6 AM, the situation reverses; from 1 PM to 4 PM, neither location is better.
- **Boston - NYC**: From 1 AM to 7 AM, neither site is better; at other times, Boston has the edge.
- **Chicago - Peoria**: The effect of the hour of day is less clear.

### Differential Duration
The duration of a sustained price differential is defined as the number of hours one location is favored over another by more than $5/MWh. Figure 13 shows that short-lived differentials (<3 hours) are more frequent, while medium-length differentials (<9 hours) are common. Differentials lasting longer than a day are rare for balanced pairs like PaloAlto-Virginia.

# 4. AKAMAI: TRAFFIC AND BANDWIDTH

## Overview
To understand the interaction of real workloads with electricity prices, we acquired a dataset detailing traffic on Akamai’s infrastructure. This data covers 24 days of traffic on a large subset of Akamai’s servers, with a peak of over 2 million hits per second. The 9-region traffic is a subset of servers for which we have electricity price data.

### Traffic Data
- **Data Collection**: Traffic data was collected at 5-minute intervals on servers in Akamai’s public clusters. Public clusters are generally located in commercial co-location centers and can serve any users worldwide. Private clusters, located inside universities, large companies, and ISPs, serve specific user bases.
- **Content**: The data includes the number of hits and bytes served, a rough geography of client origins, and cluster load. We also surveyed the hardware used in different clusters and collected values for observed server power usage.

### Bandwidth Costs
Bandwidth is a significant cost for Akamai, and their system is optimized to reduce these costs. Changing Akamai’s current assignments to reduce energy costs could increase bandwidth costs. The relative cost of energy versus bandwidth has been rising, primarily due to decreases in bandwidth costs. Our analysis will estimate 95th percentiles from the traffic data and constrain energy-price rerouting to avoid increasing the 95th percentile bandwidth for any location.

### Client-Server Distances
We use geographic distance as a proxy for network performance in our simulations. While there is some evidence of geo-locality in the Akamai traffic data, many clients are not mapped to the nearest cluster geographically. This can be due to factors such as network performance, keeping clients on the same network, or 95/5 bandwidth constraints.

# 5. MODELING ENERGY CONSUMPTION

To estimate potential energy cost reductions, we must model the system’s energy consumption for each cluster. We use data from the Akamai CDN as a representative real-world workload. This data is used to develop a comprehensive model of energy consumption, which will inform our strategies for reducing costs.
