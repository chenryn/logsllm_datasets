a surprising lack of diversity within some regions: LA and
Palo Alto have a coeﬃcient of 0.94.
Hourly prices are not correlated at short time-scales, but
we should not expect prices to be independent. Natural gas
prices, for example, will introduce some coupling (see ﬁgure
3) between distant locations.
3.3 Price Differentials
Figure 9 shows hourly price diﬀerentials for two pairs of
locations over an eight day period (both pairs have mean
diﬀerentials close to zero). The three locations are far from
each other and in diﬀerent RTOs. We see price spikes (some
extend far oﬀ the scale, the largest is $1900) and extended
periods of price asymmetry. Sometimes the asymmetry favours
one, sometimes the other. This suggests that a pre-determined
assignment of clients to servers is not optimal.
Diﬀerential Distributions. Consider two locations. In
order for our dynamic approach to yield substantial savings
over a static solution, the price diﬀerential between those
locations must vary in time, and the distribution of this dif-
ferential should ideally have a zero mean and a reasonably
high variance. Such a distribution would imply that neither
site is strictly better than the other, but also that a dynamic
solution, always buying from whichever site is least expen-
sive that hour, could yield meaningful savings. Additionally,
the dynamic approach could win when presented with two
locations having uncorrelated periods of price elevation.

Figure 11: PaloAlto-Virginia price diﬀerential distribu-
tions for each month. The monthly median prices and
inter-quartile range are shown.
Figure 10 shows the pairwise diﬀerential distributions for
some locations, for the 2006-2009 data. The California-
Virginia (ﬁgure 10a) and Texas-Virginia (ﬁgure 10b) dis-
tributions are zero-mean with a high variance. There are
many other such pairs9.
Boston-NYC (ﬁgure 10c) is skewed, since Boston tends
to be cheaper than NYC, but NYC is less expensive 36%
of the time (the savings are greater than $10/MWh 18% of
the time). Thus, even with such a skewed distribution, there
exists an opportunity to dynamically exploit diﬀerentials for
meaningful savings.
Unsurprisingly, a number of pairs exist where one location
is strictly better than the other, and dynamic adaptation is
unnecessary. Chicago-Virginia (ﬁgure 10d) is an example:
Virginia is less expensive 8% of the time, but the savings
almost never exceed $10/MWh.
The dispersion introduced by a market boundary can be
seen in the dynamically exploitable Chicago-Peoria distribu-
tion (ﬁgure 10e).
Evolution in Time. The price diﬀerential distributions
do not remain static in time. Figure 11 shows how the
PaloAlto-Virginia distribution changed from month to month.
A sustained price asymmetry may exist for many months,
before reversing itself. The spread of prices in one month
may double the next month.
Time-of-Day Price diﬀerentials depend on the time-of-
day. For instance, because California and Virginia are in
diﬀerent time zones, peak demand does not overlap. This is
likely an important factor shaping the price diﬀerential.
Figure 12 shows how the hour of day aﬀects the diﬀer-
entials for three location pairs. For PaloAlto-Virginia, we
see a strong dependency on the hour. Before 5am (eastern),
Virginia has a signiﬁcant edge; by 6am the situation has re-
versed; from 1-4pm neither is better. For Boston-NYC we
see a diﬀerent kind of dependency: from 1am-7am neither

site is better, at all other times Boston has the edge. The
eﬀect of hour-of-day on Chicago-Peoria is less clear.
Diﬀerential Duration. We deﬁne the duration of a sus-
tained price diﬀerential as the number of hours one location
is favoured over another by more than $5/MWh. As soon
as the diﬀerential falls below this threshold, or reverses to
favour the other location, we mark the end of the diﬀerential.
Figure 13 shows how much time was spent in short-duration
price-diﬀerentials, for PaloAlto-Virginia. Short diﬀerentials
(<3 hrs) are more frequent than other types. Medium length
diﬀerentials (<9 hrs) are common. Diﬀerentials that last
longer than a day are rare, for a balanced pair like this.
4. AKAMAI: TRAFFIC AND BANDWIDTH
In order to understand the interaction of real workloads
with electricity prices, we acquired a data set detailing traﬃc
on Akamai’s infrastructure. The data covers 24 days worth
of traﬃc on a large subset of Akamai’s servers, with a peak
of over 2 million hits/sec (ﬁgure 14). The 9-region traﬃc is
the subset of servers for which we have electricity price data.
We use the Akamai traﬃc because it is a realistic work-
load. Akamai has over 2000 content provider customers in
the US. Hence, the traﬃc represents a broad user base.

Figure 14: Traﬃc in the Akamai data set. We see a peak hit rate of over 2 million hits per second. Of this, about
1.25 million hits come from the US. The traﬃc in this data set comes from roughly half of the servers Akamai runs.
In comparison, in total, Akamai sees around 275 billion hits/day.
However, Akamai does not use aggressive server power
management, their CDN is sensitive to latency and their
workload contains a large fraction of computationally triv-
ial hits (e.g., fetches of well cached objects). So our work
is far less relevant to Akamai than to systems where more
energy elasticity exists and workloads are computationally
intensive. Furthermore, in mapping clients to servers, Aka-
mai’s system balances a number of concerns—trying to opti-
mize performance, handle partially replicated CDN objects,
optimize network bandwidth costs, etc.
Traﬃc Data. Traﬃc data was collected at 5-minute in-
tervals on servers housed in Akamai’s public clusters. Aka-
mai has two types of clusters: public, and private. Pri-
vate clusters are typically located inside of universities, large
companies, small ISPs, and ISPs outside the US. These clus-
ters are dedicated to serving a speciﬁc user base, e.g., the
members of a university community, and no others. Pub-
lic clusters are generally located in commercial co-location
centers and can serve any users world-wide. For any user
not served by a private cluster, Akamai has the freedom to
choose which of its public clusters to direct the user. Clients
that end up at public clusters tend to see longer network
paths than clients that can be served at private clusters.
The 5-minute data contains, for each public cluster: the
number of hits and bytes served to clients; a rough geogra-
phy of where those clients originated; and the load in each of
the clusters. In addition, we surveyed the hardware used in
the diﬀerent clusters and collected values for observed server
power usage. We also looked at the top-level mapping sys-
tem to see how name-servers were mapped to clusters.
In the data we collected, the geographic localization of
clients is coarse: they are mapped to states in the US, or
countries. If multiple clusters exist in a city, we aggregate
them together and treat them as a single cluster. This aﬀects
our calculation of client-server distances in §6.
Bandwidth Costs. An important contributor to data
center costs is bandwidth, and there may be large diﬀer-
ences between costs on diﬀerent networks, and sometimes
on the same network over time. Bandwidth costs are signif-
icant for Akamai, and thus their system is aggressively op-
timized to reduce bandwidth costs. We note that changing
Akamai’s current assignments of clients to clusters to reduce
energy costs could increase its bandwidth costs (since they
have been optimized already). Right now the portion of co-
location cost attributable to energy is less than but still a
signiﬁcant fraction of the cost of bandwidth. The relative
cost of energy versus bandwidth has been rising. This is
primarily due to decreases in bandwidth costs.
We cannot cannot ignore bandwidth costs in our analysis.
The complication is that the bandwidth pricing speciﬁcs are
considered to be proprietary information. Therefore, our
treatment of bandwidth costs in this paper will be relatively
abstract.
Akamai does not view bandwidth prices as being geo-
graphically diﬀerentiated.
In some instances, a company
as large as Akamai can negotiate contracts with carriers on
a nationwide basis. Smaller regional providers may provide
transit for free. Prices are usually set per network port, us-
ing the basic 95/5 billing model: traﬃc is divided into ﬁve
minute intervals and the 95th percentile is used for billing.
Our approach in this paper is to estimate 95th percentiles
from the traﬃc data, and then to constrain our energy-price
rerouting so that it does not increase the 95th percentile
bandwidth for any location.
Client-Server Distances. Lacking any network level
data on clients, we use geographic distance as a coarse proxy
for network performance in our simulations. We see some
evidence of geo-locality in the Akamai traﬃc data, but there
are many cases where clients are not mapped to the near-
est cluster geographically. One reason is that geographical
distance does not always correspond to optimal network per-
formance. Another possibility is that the system is trying
to keep those clients on the same network, even if Akamai’s
servers on that network are geographically far away. Yet
another possibility is that clients are being moved to distant
clusters because of 95/5 bandwidth constraints.
5. MODELING ENERGY CONSUMPTION
In order to estimate by how much we can reduce energy
costs, we must ﬁrst model the system’s energy consumption
for each cluster. We use data from the Akamai CDN as a
representative real-world workload. This data is used to de-
