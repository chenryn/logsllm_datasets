User: Is Python generally slower on Windows vs. a *nix machine?  Python seems to blaze on my Mac OS X machine whereas it seems to run slower on my Window's Vista machine. The machines are similar in processing power and the vista machine has 1GBs more memory. 
I particularly notice this in Mercurial but I figure this may simply be how Mercurial is packaged on windows.
Assistant: I run Python locally on Windows XP and 7 as well as OSX on my Macbook.  I've seen no noticable performance differences in the command line interpreter, wx widget apps run the same, and Django apps also perform virtually identically.
One thing I noticed at work was that the Kaspersky virus scanner tended to slow the python interpreter WAY down.  It would take 3-5 seconds for the python prompt to properly appear and 7-10 seconds for Django's test server to fully load.  Properly disabling its active scanning brought the start up times back to 0 seconds.
