User: Got a problem with my project on OpenSUSE 12.1:
somehow it ignores the path to libs provided in $LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
The structure of calls is as follows:
My python module adds the path to libs to $LD_LIBRARY_PATH,
then imports cython module (interface.so) depending on some other corefuncs.so file.
It worked fine on Ubuntu 11.04.
Now it starts loading the cython module, but then throws an ImportError: corefuncs.so: no such file or directory.
I can solve the problem by modifying /etc/ld.so.conf and running ldconfig, but can not make Python search through $LD_LIBRARY_PATH, modified within a terminal session.
Are there any suggestions?
Thanks!
Assistant: Use PYTHONPATH instead of LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
