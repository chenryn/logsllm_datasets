**ATT&CK Technique Name:** User Account Management

To enhance security, it is essential to enforce role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that user accounts have the minimum privileges necessary for their roles. This practice minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and potential misuse of resources.

For cloud environments, a Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) can be utilized to establish and enforce usage policies, as well as manage user permissions across cloud applications. This helps prevent unauthorized access to application access tokens, thereby reducing the risk of data breaches and other security incidents.

In Kubernetes, for pods that do not require access to service account tokens, set `automountServiceAccountToken: false` in the pod's YAML specification. This configuration ensures that these pods do not have unnecessary access to sensitive information, further enhancing the overall security posture of the Kubernetes environment.
