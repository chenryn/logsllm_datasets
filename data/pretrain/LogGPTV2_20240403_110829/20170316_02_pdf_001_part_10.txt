### Performance and Changes Overview

#### Performance Metrics
The following table summarizes the performance metrics for various operations, conducted on an IBM X41T Tablet PC (Pentium M, 1.5GHz, 1.5GB RAM) under Windows XP Tablet Edition with SP2. The modules were compiled using GCC version 3.4.4 with optimization settings -O3 -march=i686.

| Operation | Input 1 | Input 2 | Description |
|-----------|---------|---------|-------------|
| Subtract (Different-Signs Addition) | 457 | - | 34-digit, unaligned, rounded, borrow |
| Compare | 187 | 1125 | 34-digit, unaligned, mismatch at end |
| CompareTotal | 238 | 778 | 34-digit, unaligned, mismatch at end |
| Divide | 2018 | 3172 | 34- by 34-digit (rounded) |
| FMA (Fused Multiply-Add) | 1622 | 2707 | 34-digit, subtraction, rounded |
| LogB (Returns a decQuad) | 58 | 299 | Negative result |
| MaxNum/MinNum | 241 | 857 | 34-digit, unaligned, mismatch at end |
| Multiply | 821 | 2235 | 34×34-digit, round needed |
| Quantize | 209 | 670 | 34-digit, round all-nines |
| ScaleB (from decQuads) | 263 | 553 | Underflow |
| To Integral Value | 233 | 886 | 34-digit, round all-nines |

#### Notes
1. **System Configuration**: All timings were made on an IBM X41T Tablet PC (Pentium M, 1.5GHz, 1.5GB RAM) under Windows XP Tablet Edition with SP2. The modules were compiled using GCC version 3.4.4 with optimization settings -O3 -march=i686.
2. **Default Tuning Parameters**: Default tuning parameters were used (e.g., DECUSE64=1, DECDPUN=3), which may affect decNumber.
3. **Timing Inclusions**: Timings include call/return overhead and, for the decNumber module, the costs of converting operands to decNumbers and results back to the appropriate format using the decimal64 or decimal128 module.
4. **BCD Representation**: For decNumber, BCD is Packed BCD using the decPacked module; for decFloats, it is 8-bit BCD.
5. **Worst Case Scenarios**: The worst case for each operation can be implementation-dependent. Unusual cases may be slower than the listed counts.
6. **String-to-Number Conversion**: Theoretically, a string-to-number conversion can have an arbitrarily large worst case due to leading, trailing, or embedded zeros. The timings measured cases where the input string’s coefficient had up to eight more digits than the precision of the destination format.
