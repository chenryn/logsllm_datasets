### Current Behavior
I have a project using NPM 7 workspaces. One package is named `button`.
If I run `npm -w button version minor`, then the version number in button's
`package.json` gets incremented as I would expect. However, the root-level
`package-lock.json` does not get modified.
If I later run an `npm -w button install` then the value in
`packages.button.version` gets updated to reflect the current version.
### Expected Behavior
I would expect the value at `packages.button.version` in the root-level
`package-lock.json` file to get updated at the same time as button's
`package.json`, when the `npm version` command is run.
### Steps To Reproduce
  1. Set up a project with one package, run `npm --workspaces install` to generate basic `package-lock.json`
  2. Run `npm -w [package name] version minor`
  3. See that the package's `package.json` has been updated but the root level `package-lock.json` has not
  4. Run `npm -w [package name] install`
  5. See that the root level `package-lock.json` has one change in it: the sub-package's version number.
### Environment
  * OS: macOS 11.5.2
  * Node: 16.7.0
  * npm: 7.20.3
