hello, when i downloaded "script auto setup" and ran it to create cluster on
AWS, and got this error:  
./cluster/../cluster/../cluster/aws/../../cluster/common.sh: line 518:
KUBE_MANIFESTS_TAR_URL: unbound variable
I don't see this on older version, and don't know variable
"KUBE_MANIFESTS_TAR_URL", does anyone explain this ?.
Thanks so much!!
