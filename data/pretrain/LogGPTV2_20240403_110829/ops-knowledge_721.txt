User: When I'm in ipython and try to import keras, I get the error No space left on device: /home/username/.keras. How can I change this so that Keras does not use my HOME directory, and instead use /data/username/? I did the same for the directory ~/.ipython. I moved it to the desired location and then did export IPYTHONDIR=/data/username/.ipython, can I do something similar with Keras? More generally, how can I do this for any app that wants to use HOME?
Note: Please don't give answers like "you can clean your home" etc. I am asking this for a reason. Thanks!
Assistant: I don't think keras is the only problem. If you are using theano as a backend, it will create $HOME/.theano/ as well.
One dirty trick is to export HOME=/data/username/, but other program than keras or ipython will also treat /data/username/ as $HONE. To avoid that, you can do this locally by calling HOME=/data/username/ ipython or HOME=/data/username/ python kerasProgram.py.
