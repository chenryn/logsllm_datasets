### Experimental Setup and Results

We selected Baidu, Taobao, and Amazon as representative schemes for our experiments. For each experiment, we used 500 randomly collected CAPTCHAs as a sample set and another 500 randomly chosen samples as a test set.

#### 1. Overlapping
Overlapping removes the space between characters, making them overlap. This is considered one of the most secure anti-segmentation techniques [5].

**Case Study: Baidu Scheme**
- **Experiment:** We modified the original CAPTCHAs by increasing character overlapping by 1, 2, and 3 pixels, respectively, and then ran our attack on them.
- **Results:**
  - Original success rate: 44.2%
  - New success rates: 21.2% (1-pixel overlap), 15.2% (2-pixel overlap), 8.4% (3-pixel overlap)
- **Conclusion:** Increasing character overlap significantly reduces the success rate of our attack.

#### 2. Rotating
Rotating characters can make adjacent strokes of different characters connect or overlap, while keeping the CAPTCHA length and characters unchanged.

**Case Study: Taobao Scheme**
- **Experiment:** We rotated one or more characters to create connections or overlaps.
- **Results:**
  - Success rate on the hardened test set: 7.8%
  - Original success rate: [Original value missing, please provide]
- **Conclusion:** Rotating characters enhances security by reducing the success rate of our attack.

#### 3. Warping
Warping can be either global, affecting the entire CAPTCHA string, or local, affecting only some characters.

**Case Study: Amazon Scheme**
- **Experiment:** We tested both global and local warping.
- **Results:**
  - Original success rate: 25.8%
  - Global warping success rate: 5.4%
  - Local warping success rate: 8.8%
- **Conclusion:** Both forms of warping significantly reduce the success rate of our attack.

#### 4. Combining Countermeasures
We performed additional experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of various combinations of countermeasures.

- **Experiment Setup:**
  - Sample set size: 500
  - Test set size: 500
  - Chosen scheme: Amazon
- **Results:**
  - Table XI summarizes the results, showing the influence of each countermeasure and combination on the CAPTCHA's resistance to our attack.
- **Conclusion:**
  - The combination of two countermeasures is more secure than any single countermeasure.
  - The combination of three countermeasures provides the best defense.
  - Among single countermeasures, warping is the most secure.
  - However, excessive warping can significantly decrease usability, so finding the right balance is crucial.

### Summary and Conclusion
We have proposed a simple attack on text CAPTCHAs, which has been tested on real-world CAPTCHAs from top 20 popular websites and several other challenging CAPTCHAs. Our attack has successfully broken all these CAPTCHAs, with varying degrees of success.

- **Key Findings:**
  - Although our success rates on some schemes are relatively low, the general applicability of our attack is its strength.
  - Ad hoc attacks might achieve better success rates on specific schemes, but our generic attack is more cost-effective when targeting multiple schemes.
  - Our attack uses a single segmentation method and a single recognition strategy, making it simple, fast, and generic.
  - The key innovation is the use of 2D Log-Gabor filters, which effectively break CAPTCHA images into meaningful pieces, allowing for accurate character reconstruction.

### Future Directions
- **Open Problem:** A full defense against our attack remains an interesting and challenging open problem.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Encourage the research community and industry to explore new designs and alternative solutions, such as image recognition CAPTCHAs.
  - Balance security and usability in CAPTCHA design.
