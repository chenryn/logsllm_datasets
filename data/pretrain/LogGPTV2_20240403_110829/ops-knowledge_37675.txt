I have installed the Designate client on the same server where the Designate service is running, as part of an OpenStack Juno deployment. After activating the virtual environment with `.venv/bin/activate` and setting the Keystone environment variables using the `keystonerc_admin` script, I encountered an issue when attempting to run the `designate --debug server-list` command. The error message I received was:

```
EndpointNotFound: public endpoint for hpext:dns service in RegionOne region not found
```

I managed to resolve this issue. It turned out to be a configuration mistake on my part. I had exported the `hpext:dns` service in both the `keystone_admin` and `.bashrc` files. This value is specific to HP Cloud environments, particularly when logging into their geos.

If you are also using HP Cloud and encountering a similar issue, ensure that the `hpext:dns` service is correctly configured in your environment.
