User: I have installed designate client on the same box where designate server is running with OpenStack Juno. After setting environment by issuing . .venv/bin/activate and keystone variables by issuing this command keystonerc_admin.
When I try to run designate --debug server-list command I am getting this error:
EndpointNotFound: public endpoint for hpext:dns service in RegionOne region not found
Please help me out.
Assistant: I was able to solve this. This was my mistake. I have exported hpext:dns in keystone_admin and .bashrc file.
This value is very much specific if anyone is using hp cloud and they are logging into their geos.
