User: Suppose you need to expand the capacity of a large database without affecting its normal operation. Please provide a database online expansion plan.
Assistant: An online database expansion solution can be divided into the following steps: 1. Adjust the database storage architecture: switch to a distributed architecture. Change the original stand-alone deployment method to a multi-node distributed deployment method to improve system reliability and scalability. 2. Increase the number of nodes: According to business needs and load conditions, increase the number of database nodes to increase available storage and computing power. 3. Data migration: Use data synchronization tools to migrate the original data to the expanded system to achieve seamless data migration. 4. Load balancing: introduce a load balancing mechanism to avoid single point of failure and load concentration to ensure high availability and scalability of the system. 5. Testing and verification: Carry out comprehensive testing and verification of the new environment to ensure the stability and reliability of the system. 6. Completion of online database expansion: After all operations are completed, the process of online database expansion is complete. Subsequent optimization and maintenance work can be carried out to ensure the stability and reliability of the system.
