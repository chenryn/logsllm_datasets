probability a station transmits, regardless of slot, backoﬀ stage or other factors.
This assumption is particularly evident in models based on [2] as we see the
same probability of collision used in the Markov chain at the end of each backoﬀ
stage. However similar assumptions are present in other models. It is the collision
probability at the end of each backoﬀ stage that we will consider in this section.
We might reasonably expect these sort of assumptions to better approximate
the network when the number of stations is large. This is because the backoﬀ
stage of any one station is then a small part of the state of the network. Con-
versely, we expect that a network with only a small number stations may provide
a challenge to the modeling assumptions.
Figure 4(a) shows measured collision probabilities for a station in a network
of two stations. Each station has Poisson arrivals of packets at the same rate.

Fig. 4. Measured collision probabilities as oﬀered load is varied. Measurements are
shown of the average collision probability (the fraction of transmission attempts re-
sulting in a collision), the ﬁrst backoﬀ stage collision probability (the fraction of ﬁrst
transmission attempts that result in a collision) and the second backoﬀ stage collision
probabilities (the fraction of second transmission attempts that result in a collision).
We show the probability of collision on any transmission, the probability of
collision at the ﬁrst backoﬀ stage (i.e. the probability of a collision on the ﬁrst
transmission attempt for a given packet) and the probability of collision at the
second backoﬀ stage (i.e. the probability of collision at the second transmission
√
attempt for a given packet, providing the ﬁrst attempt was unsuccessful). Error
N, where N is
bars are conservatively estimated for each probability using 1/
the number of events used to estimate the probability.
The ﬁrst thing to note is that the overall collision probability is very close to
the collision probability for the ﬁrst backoﬀ stage alone. This is because collisions
are overwhelmingly at the ﬁrst backoﬀ stage: to have a collision at a subsequent
stage a station must have a ﬁrst collision and then a second collision, but we see
that less than 4% of colliding packets have a collision at the second stage.
As we expect, both overall collision probability and ﬁrst state collision proba-
bility increase as the oﬀered load is increased. However, we observe that collisions
at the second backoﬀ stage show a diﬀerent behaviour. Indeed, within the range
of the error bars shown, this probability is nearly constant with oﬀered load.
This diﬀerence in behaviour can be understood in terms of the close coupling
of the two stations in the system. First consider the situation when the load
is low. On a station’s ﬁrst attempt to transmit a packet, the other station is
unlikely to have a packet to transmit and so the probability of collision is very
low. Indeed, we would expect that the chance of collision to become almost zero
as the arrival rate becomes zero.
Now consider the second backoﬀ stage when the load is low. As we are be-
ginning the second backoﬀ attempt, the other station must have had a packet
to transmit to have caused a collision in the ﬁrst place. So, it is likely that both
stations are on their second backoﬀ stage. Two stations beginning a stage-two

backoﬀ at the same time will collide on their next transmission with probability
1/(2 ∗ CW min) = 1/64 (marked on Figure 4(a)). If there is no collision, it
is possible that the ﬁrst station to transmit will have another packet available
for transmission, and could collide on its next transmission, however as we are
considering a low arrival rate, this should not be common.
On the other hand, if the load is heavy, it is highly likely that the other station
has packets to send, regardless of backoﬀ stage. This explains the increasing trend
in all the collision probabilities shown. However, at the second backoﬀ stage we
know that both stations are have recently doubled their CW value. These larger
than typical CW values result in smaller collision collision probability, and so
we expect a lower collision rate on the second backoﬀ stage compared to the
ﬁrst.
Figure 4(b) shows the same experiment, but now conducted with 10 stations
in the network. Here, explicitly reasoning about the behaviour of the network is
more diﬃcult, but we see the same trends as for 2 stations: the ﬁrst-stage and
overall collision probabilities are very similar; collision probabilities increase as
the load increases; collision probabilities at the second stage are higher than at
ﬁrst stage when the load is low, but vice versa when the load is high. The relative
values of the collision probabilities are closer than in the case of 2 stations, but
the error bars suggest they are still statistically diﬀerent.
In contrast to the relatively gradual increase for two stations, we see a much
sharper increase for 10 stations. Accurately capturing any sharp transition can
be a challenge for a model.
In summary, while analytic models typically assume that the collision proba-
bility is the same for all backoﬀ stages, our measurements indicate that this is
generally not the case. However, collisions are dominated by collisions at the ﬁrst
backoﬀ stage, and so the overall collision probability is a reasonable approxima-
tion to this. Adjustments to later-stage collision probabilities would represent
second-order corrections when calculating mean-behaviour quantities (e.g. long
term throughput). However, based on these measurements it is not clear if distri-
butions or higher-order statistics, such as variances, predicted by existing models
will always accurately reﬂect real networks.
6 Saturated Network Relationships
In this section we will consider the relationship between the average collision
probability and the transmission probability. The relationship between these
quantities plays a key role in many models, where it is assumed that
p = 1 − (1 − τ)n−1.
(2)
Models will typically calculate τ based on mean backoﬀ window or use a self-
consistent approach, where a second relationship between p and τ gives a pair
of equations that can be solved for both.
70
D. Malone, I. Dangerﬁeld, and D. Leith
Once τ is known, the throughput of a system is usually calculated by cal-
culating the the average time spent transmitting payload data in a slot by the
average length of a slot. That is,
S =
σ(1 − τ)n + Tsnτ(1 − τ)n−1 + (1 − (1 − τ)n − nτ(1 − τ)n−1)Tc
Epnτ(1 − τ)n−1
.
(3)
Here Ep is the time spent transmitting payload, σ is the time between counter
decrements when the medium is idle, Ts is the time before a counter decrement
after a successful transmission begins and Tc is the time before a counter decre-
ment after a collision begins.
The pair of equations 2 and 3 are based on assuming that each station trans-
mits independently in any slot. These equations can be tested independently of
the rest of the model based on our measurements. Speciﬁcally, using our mea-
surements of collision probability p, we may derive τ using equation 2 and then
compare the predicted throughput given by equation 3 to the actual throughput.

Fig. 5. Predicted and measured collision probability (left) and throughput (right) in
in a network of saturated stations as the number of stations is varied
Figure 5(a) shows the predictions made by a model described in [10] for the
collision probabilities in a network of saturated stations and compares them to
values measured in our testbed. We see that the model overestimates the collision
probabilities by a few percent.
Figure 5(b) shows the corresponding measured throughput, together with
model-based predictions of throughput made in several diﬀerent ways. First, p
and τ are predicted using the model described in [10] and throughput derived
using equation 3. We take values Ts = 907.8μs and Tc = 963.8μs which would
be valid if the 802.11b standard was followed exactly. It can be seen that, other
than for very small numbers of stations, the model prediction consistently un-
derestimates the throughput by around 10%.
Further investigation reveals that the value used for Tc appears to signiﬁcantly
overestimate the Tc value used in the hardware. While the standard requires that,
Veriﬁcation of Common 802.11 MAC Model Assumptions
71
following a collision, stations must pause for the length of time it would take to
transmit an ACK at 1Mbps our measurements indicate that the hardware seems
to resume the backoﬀ procedure more quickly. In particular, values of Ts = 916μs
and Tc = 677μs are estimated from test bed measurements. Using once again the
model values for p and τ, but now plugging in our measured values for Ts and Tc,
we see in Figure 5 that this produces signiﬁcantly better throughput predictions,
suggesting that the estimated values for Ts and Tc are probably closer to what is
in use. In particular, we note that for larger numbers of nodes, where collisions
are more common, the estimated throughput now closely matches the measured
throughput.
Finally, instead of predicting p using a model, we use the measured value of
p and estimate τ using equation 2. We continue to use the values of Ts and
Tc based on testbed measurements. We can see from Figure 5 that for larger
numbers of stations the throughput predictions are very similar to the previ-
ous situation. This suggests that equation 3 is rather insensitive to the small
discrepancies seen in Figure 5 for larger numbers of stations. However, for two
stations we see a signiﬁcantly larger discrepancy in throughput prediction. This
may indicate that the independence assumptions made by equations 2 and 3
are being strained by the strongly coupled nature of a network of two saturated
stations.
7 Conclusion
In this paper we have investigated a number of common assumptions used in
modeling 802.11 using an experimental testbed. We present the ﬁrst published
measurements of conditional packet collision probabilities from an experimental
testbed and compare these with model assumptions. We also present one of the
ﬁrst detailed comparison of measured and predicted behaviour.
We ﬁnd that collision probabilities are not constant when conditioned on a
station’s backoﬀ stage. However, collisions are dominated by collisions at the ﬁrst
backoﬀ stage, and so the overall collision probability is a reasonable approxima-
tion to this. Adjustments to later-stage collision probabilities would represent
second-order corrections when calculating mean-behaviour quantities (e.g. long
term throughput). However, based on these measurements it is not clear if dis-
tributions or higher-order statistics, such as variances, predicted by these models
will always accurately reﬂect real networks.
We also ﬁnd that throughput predictions are somewhat insensitive to small
errors in predictions of collision probabilities when a moderate number of stations
are in a saturated network. In all our tests, we see that two station networks
pose a challenge to the modeling assumptions that we consider.
In future work we may explore the level of synchronisation between stations,
the eﬀect of more realistic traﬃc on the assumptions we have studied and the
impact of non-ﬁxed collision probabilities on other statistics, such as delay.
