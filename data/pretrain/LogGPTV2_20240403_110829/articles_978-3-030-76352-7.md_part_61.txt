extensions. In general, we observe that the flow of messages in, i.e., incoming
eventsfromthestream,andtheflowofmessagesconsumed,i.e.,processedevents,
overlaps much more for the DSC version compared to the PL version. Hence,
the consumer lag of the DSC version is significantly lower compared to the PL
version. This shows that the two proposed extensions significantly reduce the
computational effort.
6 Conclusion
In this paper, we presented an implementation for scalable online conformance
checkingbasedonincrementalprefix-alignmentcalculation.Theproposedimple-
mentation is based on Apache Kafka, a streaming platform that is widely used
within industry. Therefore, the paper offers an important basis for the indus-
trial application of online conformance checking techniques. Moreover, we pre-
sented two extensions that significantly reduce the computational effort. Our
conducted experiments show that the proposed implementation combined with
the presented extensions is capable to efficiently process real-life event streams.

Web accessibility
1 Introduction
Accessing the Web has long relied on users to correctly process and interpret
visual cues in order to have a proper user experience. Web browsers as well as
information and services on the Web are optimised to make full use of user’s
visual perceptive capabilities for organising, delivering and fulfilling their goals.
This introduces problems for blind and visually impaired people (BVIP) who
due to genetic, health or age-related conditions are not able to effectively rely
on their visual perception [6].
Assistive technology such as screen readers have traditionally supported
BVIP users in interacting with visual interfaces. These tools exploit the acces-
sibility tags used by Web developers and content creators in order to facilitate
access to information and services online, typically by reading out the elements
of the website sequentially from top to bottom (see Fig.1). They are usually
controlled with a keyboard, offering shortcuts to navigate and access content.
The challenges faced by BVIP in browsing the Web with this type of support
is well documented in the literature, ranging from websites not designed for
accessibility [10,18] to limitations of screen reading technology [3,21,29].

Cognitive augmentation has been regarded as a promising direction to
empower populations challenged by the traditional interaction paradigm for
accessing information and services [7]. Conversational browsing is an emerg-
ing interaction paradigm for the Web that builds on this promise to enable
BVIP, as well as regular users, to access the contents and services provided
by websites through dialog-based interactions with a conversational agent [4].
Insteadofrelyingonthesequentialnavigation andkeyboardshortcutsprovided
by screen readers, this approach would enable BVIP to express their goals by
directly “talking to websites”. The first step towards this vision was to identify
the conceptual vocabulary for augmenting websites with conversational capabil-
ities and explore techniques for generating chatbots out of websites equipped
with bot-specific annotations [13].
In this paper we take a deeper dive into the opportunities of cognitive aug-
mentation for BVIP by building a conceptual framework that takes the lessons
learnedfromtheliterature,ourpriorworkandprototypingexercisestohighlight
areas for conversational support. We then focus on the specific tasks that are
currently served rather poorly by screen readers, and describe our early work
towards a heuristic-based approach that would leverage visual and structural
propertiesofwebsitestotranslatetheexperienceofgraphicaluserinterfaceinto
a conversational medium.
2 Conceptual Framework
2.1 Motivating Scenario
Before introducing the main concepts, we illustrate our vision by describing an
example interaction of a BVIP looking for information on COVID-19 on a local

newspaper. Peter, 72, is a visually impaired man affected by Parkinson disease,
who keeps hearing about the new virus COVID-19 on TV and wants to be
updated constantly about the recent news from his favorite local newspaper,
The Tambury Gazette. However, his experience with screen readers has been
poor and frustrating, often requiring assistance from others to get informed.
The vision is to enable users like Peter to browse the Web by directly “talk-
ing” to websites. As seen in Fig.2, the user interacts with the website in dialog-
based voice-based interactions with a conversational agent (e.g., Google Assis-
tant). The user can start the session by searching for the website, or opening it
up directly if already bookmarked. Once open, the user can inquire about the
relevant actions that are available in its current context (e.g., “What can I do
in this website”), which are automatically derived by the conversational agent
based on heuristics. Instead of sequentially going through the website, the user
can lookup for specific information within the website matching his interests
(e.g., “Lookup COVID”). The user can then follow up on the list of resulting
articles and chose one to be read out. As part of these interactions, the user can
use the voice commands to navigate and get oriented in the website.
The above illustrates the experience of browsing a website by leveraging
natural language commands that improve over the keyboard-based sequential
navigation of websites. As we will see, more advanced support can be provided
byleveragingthecontentsandapplication-specificdomainknowledge,butinthis
work we focus on improving on the features provided by screen readers, making
noassumptionsaboutcompliancewithaccessibilityandbot-specificannotations.

2.2 Characterising Conversational Browsing Support
Enabling conversational browsing requires first and foremost to understand the
type of support that is needed to meet BVIP needs. Informed by previous
research, our own work and prototyping experiences, we highlight a few rele-
vant areas in Table1 and describe them below.
Table 1. Categories of support for engaging BVIP in conversations with websites
Category Skills Examples
Metadata&content Overview “Whatisthiswebsiteabout?”
ContentQ&A “Whenaresportscomingback?”
Summary “Summarisethearticle?”
About “Whoaretheauthorsofthisarticle?”
Yes/No “IsthearticlewritteninEnglish?”
Browsing Outline “WhatcanIdointhiswebsite?”
Orientation “WhereamI?”
Navigation “Gotothemainpage”;“Nextarticle”
Lookup “LookupCOVID”
Reading “Readarticle”;“Stopreading”
Workflows Element-specific “Fillouttheform”
App-specific “Postanewcommentonthenewsarticle”
Operations Open “OpenTheTamburyGazette”
Search “SearchforTheTamburyGazette”
Bookmark “BookmarkpageTheTamburyGazette”
Speech “Increasespeechrate”
Verbosity “Turnonshortinteractions”
Conversational Access to Content and Metadata. BVIP should be able
to satisfy their information needs without having to sequentially go through all
the website content and structure – a process that can be time consuming and
frustrating for screen reader users [18]. This support is rooted in the ongoing
efforts in conversational Q&A [12] and document-centered digital assistant [17].
The idea is to support BVIP users to perform natural language queries (NLQ)
on the contents of websites, and to inquire about the properties defined in the
website’smetadata.Forexample,aBVIPusermightrequestanoverview ofthe
website (e.g., “What is this website about?”), engage in question & answering,
with questions that can be answered by referring directly to the contents of the
website(e.g.,“Whenarethesportscomingback?”),andaskforsummaries ofthe
contents of the website, its parts or responses from the agent (e.g., “Summarise
the article”). Users might also ask about the properties and metadata of the
artefacts,suchaslastmodification,language,authors(e.g.,“Whoaretheauthors
ofthisarticle?”),orsimplyengageinyes/no questionsonmetadataandcontent
(e.g., “Is the document written in English?”).
Bringing Cognitive Augmentation to Web Browsing Accessibility 399
Conversational Browsing. BVIP should be allowed to explore and navigate
the artefacts using natural language, so as to support more traditional informa-
tion seeking tasks. The idea is to improve on the navigation provided by tradi-
tional screen readers, which often require learning complex shortcuts and lower
level knowledge about the structure of artefact (e.g., to move between different
sections),byallowinguserstouttersimplerhighlevelcommandsinnaturallan-
guage. This category of support is inspired by the work in Web accessibility, in
usingspokencommandstointeractwithnonvisualwebbrowsers[3,28]andcon-
versational search [26,27]. For example, BVIP should be able to inquire about
the website organization and get an outline (e.g., “What can I do in this web-
site?”),andnavigate throughthestructureofthewebsiteandevenacrosslinked
webpages (e.g., “Go to the main page”), and being able to get oriented during
this exploratory process (e.g., “Where am I?”). The user should also be able to
lookup for relevant content to avoid sequentially navigating the page structure
(e.g., “Lookup COVID”).
Conversational User Workflows. BVIP should also be able to enact user
workflows by leveraging the features provided by the website. This is typi-
cally done by the users, enacting their plan by following links, filling out forms
and pressing buttons. This low level interactions have been explored by speech-
enabledscreenreaderssuchasCapti-Speak[3],enablingusertouttercommands
(e.g.,“pressthecartbutton”,“movetothesearchbox”).Wecalltheseelement-
specific intents. In our previous work we highlighted the need for supporting
application-specific intents, i.e., intents that are specific to the offerings of a
website (e.g., “Post a new comment on the news article”) and that would trig-
ger a series of low-level actions as a result. In our approach such experience
required bot-specific annotations [13]. The automation of such workflows has
also been explored in the context of Web accessibility. For example, Bigham et
al. [9] introduced the trailblazer system, which focused on facilitating the pro-
cess of creating web automation macros, by providing step by step suggestions
based on CoScript [19]. It is also the focus of the research in robotic process
automation [20].
Conversational Control Operations. BVIP should be able to easily access

support the main browsing experience, such as searching and opening websites
and managing the bookmarks, to personalising properties of the voice-based
interactions. Recent works in this context have highlighted the importance of
providing BVIP with higher control over the experience. Abdolrahmani et al.
