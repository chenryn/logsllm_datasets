I have a TextField inside a stacked scafold (the outer one contains a
bottombar and the inner one a tabbar with a pageView below it containing the
textfield), I've had to set `resizeToAvoidBottomPadding: false` in order to
keep the textfield from disappearing when the keyboard pops-up.  
I need to have the textfield occupy the whole available pageview's area, which
I can accomplish visually with `maxLines = null` and
`InputDecoration.collapsed`, The issue that I have (might be related to the
scafold flag) is that when the keyboard pops-up, the textview does not resize,
so the keyboard appears over what you're writing.  
I tried Enveloping the Textfield in a container with a `BoxConstraints.loose`
and that allows me to limit it's height, but then it never spans the rest of
the pageview.
What's the correct way to have the TextField occupy the whole pageView and
have it resize when the keyboard pops-up? is the container approach the
appropriate one? Maybe there's a way to change the boxContraints when the
keyboard pops-up, although that seems a lot of work.
