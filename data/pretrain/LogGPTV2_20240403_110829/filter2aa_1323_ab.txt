critical user organizations.  Such low-powered use should be coordinated and authorized “by 
rule” as opposed to individually licensing users or allowing for Part 15 unlicensed uses.  This 
approach would be consistent with the First R&O’s decision to prohibit unlicensed use of these 
channels.  In addition, the Commission should consider adopting rules for pre-emptive access for 
public safety and other critical users over some portion of the TV band to ensure adequate 
8 
spectrum capabilities during emergency response situations.  These issues are more fully 
discussed below. 
II. 
TV WHITE SPACE FOR PUBLIC SAFETY AND OTHER CRITICAL 
OPERATIONS. 
Motorola believes that this proceeding offers opportunities for the development of 
technologies that can support and augment existing licensed public safety operations in the VHF 
and UHF portions of the spectrum.  While unlicensed devices are not suitable substitutes for 
mission critical licensed systems, the TV white space spectrum will likely serve as a useful 
supplement for public safety and other critical users, particularly for data transmissions, as 
cognitive technology develops and matures.  Such data operations could complement existing 
VHF or UHF voice systems at an incident scene, a nuclear power plant, a water treatment plant, 
a petroleum refinery or a transportation depot facility, which are all high risk targets for breaches 
of homeland security.18   
The unique nature of broadcast television as a one-way service with a relatively stable 
environment allows for shared use in ways that fully protect the priority users of the spectrum by 
using properly designed cognitive equipment.  These same conditions or opportunities do not 
necessarily apply, however, in bands that are widely used for mobile services.  Accordingly, it 
should not be assumed that sharing techniques used in the TV band can be easily imported into 
18  
While not all of the communications at these facilities are officially defined as public 
safety under the Commission’s rules, Motorola believes they are nonetheless critical, especially 
given potential manmade or natural disasters and possible terrorist attacks.  Disruption of the 
nation’s or even a region’s power, water supply, source of petroleum or transportation/delivery 
could potentially cripple the economy and have devastating effects on the public.

other bands for sharing with other services.19  Motorola believes, however, that sharing can be 
successful in the TV white space and that the Commission should consider policies that would 
further promote the development and deployment of these technologies for public safety and 
other critical users within the TV white space spectrum.  To this end, Motorola offers the 
following two recommendations.  
A. 
TV Channels 14-20. 
In general, public safety and other critical users are wary about using unlicensed devices 
for mission critical applications in a band that is also available to commercial and consumer 
users because of the potential for unintended interference especially during times of emergency.  
This concern was the principal reason behind the FCC’s allocation of spectrum in the 4.9 GHz 
band for public safety uses despite the commercial availability of similar spectrum bands at 2.4 
GHz and 5 GHz bands.20  Motorola believes that the Commission has a similar opportunity to 
satisfy some of the requirements of public safety and other critical users in the TV white space 
without adversely affecting the commercial and consumer markets.   
19  
Also, the nature of the primary use of the band must be considered.  For example, the 
impact of interference would be significantly more devastating if it occurs to public safety 
communications as opposed to bands used for non-safety of life applications.  Accordingly, 
proposals to allow cognitive radio devices to operate in dedicated public safety spectrum as 
proposed in other Commission proceedings should be approached with extreme caution.  See 
FCC No. 06-181, rel. December 22, 2006 (“9th NPRM in WT No. Docket 96-86”). 
20  
See FCC 02-47, rel. February 27, 2002 (“4.9 GHz Allocation Order”). 
10 
In the First R&O, the Commission disallowed use of unlicensed personal/portable 
devices on TV channels 14-20 principally to protect two-way communications systems operating 
in 13 markets across the county.  The Further Notice seeks comment on whether this spectrum 
should be opened to unlicensed fixed use.   
Motorola appreciates and supports the Commission’s decision to prohibit portable 
devices in the 470-512 MHz band in order to protect public safety operations.  To date, much of 
the discussion and focus of the technical work in this proceeding has been directed at protecting 
broadcast operations and little, if any, work has been done to ensure that public safety, business, 
industrial and commercial mobile operations on channels 14-20 will be protected from potential 
interference.  Because the interference impact to emergency responders could have disastrous 
consequences, Motorola agrees with the Commission’s fundamental view that unlicensed use of 
the 470-512 MHz band should not be allowed until the technology to ensure proper protection of 
incumbent public safety licensees has been fully developed, tested and proven. 
Motorola believes, however, that this decision presents an opportunity for public safety 
and other critical users.  Motorola recommends that the Commission consider allowing some 
limited and controlled use of the 470-512 MHz band by low powered devices to help meet the 
needs of public safety and other critical uses.  This would also allow public safety and other 
critical users, and the industry that serves them, to gain experience and understanding of the 
application of cognitive radio equipment in that environment.  More specifically, Motorola 
recommends that the Commission allow public safety agencies and other critical users to deploy 
11 
fixed and personal/portable low power devices within the 470-512 MHz band that are consistent 
with the technical standards established in this proceeding on a nationwide basis.  Such devices 
will be required to rely on appropriate mechanisms that ensure interference protection to 
incumbent broadcast and land mobile services.  This will contribute valuable information on the 
capabilities and requirements of spectrum access methods, such as control signal beacons.  As 
further experience with the technology is applied, the Commission can review whether these 
eligibility restrictions continue to be warranted.21 
Use of the 470-512 MHz band by public safety and other critical users should be 
controlled and monitored.  While Motorola does not recommend individually licensing users and 
agencies for these devices given the relatively low power allowed, users should be required to 
register and coordinate unlicensed use with an appropriate Commission frequency coordinating 
committee.  Also, similar to the authorization “by rule” of radiolocation speed determining 
devices (“radar guns”), authority to operate these low-powered devices can be provided through 
the entity’s general land mobile license.22  This approach would be consistent with the 
21  
Motorola notes that out-of-band emissions from low-power devices operating on channel 
14 could interfere with incumbent land mobile base receivers operating immediately below 470 
MHz.  For low power/unlicensed devices operating within 100 meters of a land mobile base 
receiver, the radiated emission limits of 47 C.F.R. § 15.209 exceed the current protection levels 
described in 47 C.F.R. § 73.687(e) that are applicable to a TV transmitter operating on TV 
channel 14.  Based on typical performance parameters of land mobile systems operating below 
470 MHz, the received level of Part 15 emissions could exceed land mobile base receiver noise 
floor and degrade performance up to 0.5 km for conventional land mobile operations and 1.5 km 
for trunked land mobile operations.  There is similar interference potential into Federal land 
mobile operations below TV channel 7 (174 MHz).  The FCC should consider ways to protect 
these adjacent band land mobile systems from such interference.

See 47 C.F.R. § 90.20(f)(4) of the FCC’s Rules.

Commissions decision in the First Report and Order to prohibit unlicensed portable use on these 
channels.   
Allowing even limited use of 470-512 MHz for low-power devices requires the 
establishment of exclusion zones around public safety and other mobile system operations 
similar to Commission provisions for protecting TV operations.  Developing the appropriate 
zones for the 13 affected markets23 requires certain assumptions about the maximum technical 
parameters (e.g., power spectral density and antenna heights) that would be applicable to the 
low-powered/unlicensed transmitters.  More specifically, this task requires that the Commission:  
1) define a power spectral density limit relevant to narrow band victim receivers, 2) consider 
antenna height and terrain variations, and 3) consider an interference level of 21 dBu/25 kHz.  As 
shown in the attached appendix, Motorola recommends that the Commission proscribe in its 
rules a power spectral density of 8 dBm/3 kHz bandwidth, which is consistent with existing Part 
15 rules.24 This yields an exclusion zone of approximately 15 kilometers beyond the 130 km land 
mobile operational zone.25  Motorola therefore recommends that the FCC adopt a 145 kilometer

See 47 C.F.R. §§ 15.247(a)(2), 15.247(a)(3) and 15.247(e) of the FCC’s Rules. 
25  
Under Section 90.305 of the FCC’s Rules, land mobile base stations operating on TV 
channels 14-20 may not be located more than 50 miles from the cities’ specified geographic 
coordinates, and mobile stations must be within 30 miles of their associated base station yielding 
an effective 80 mile (approximately 130 km) operational area for land mobile systems.

exclusion zone around the 13 markets where land mobile services are able to access frequencies 
in the 470-512 MHz band on a licensed basis.26   
B. 
Public Safety and Critical User Priority Access. 
In addition to establishing 470-512 MHz for public safety low powered devices, the 
Commission should also consider adopting priority access requirements for devices that operate 
in other portions of the TV spectrum to help ensure that public safety and other critical users 
have adequate spectrum capacity.  As explained in more detail below, public safety and other 
critical users should be provided unconditional priority access to two VHF and two UHF 
channels in TV channels 7-25.  In addition, during emergency situations, public safety and other 
critical users should have the ability to preempt users on other channels with this range if 
necessary to meet critical communications requirements.   
Aside from channels 14-20, most of this TV band spectrum should be available with the 
least amount of constraints possible to encourage rapid deployment of lower priced applications 
and provide adequate protection of incumbents.27  Though cognitive techniques offer flexibility, 
there are significant advantages to allowing public safety and other critical uses unconditional 
preemption for some channels.  Providing public safety and other critical users with priority 
26  
Systems that have been authorized by waiver to operate beyond the normal 80 mile limit 
would also need to be protected with incrementally larger protection zones. 
27  
Beyond the obvious issues of protecting the authorized incumbents, it will be important 
to manage the co-existence of multiple users in the same channels.  Given the propagation 
characteristics and large coverage areas of UHF signals, the potential for multiple applications 
simultaneously using the same white space in the same area requires some contention 
management techniques. 
14 
access to two VHF and two UHF channels on a routine basis when channels 14-20 are not 
available would help ensure reliable access to spectrum.  When not needed by priority users, 
these four channels would be available for use by other commercial or consumer uses.   
In emergencies, public safety and other critical users should also have priority access to 
additional channels below TV channel 26 to meet requirements in time of crisis.  Examination of 
spectrum availability in a post-DTV transition environment shows that there are a number of 
places in the country where only minimal channels within 14-20 would be accessible by public 
safety and other critical users.  Therefore, Motorola believes that priority access to two additional 
VHF and two additional UHF channels below Channel 26 and, where not used for full power 
digital TV would be critical to serving these needs, with expanded priority to channels below TV 
channel 26 during emergencies.   
Access to additional channels in this range will integrate well with existing public safety 
and other critical uses of spectrum.  Typically, VHF and UHF spectrum is used by smaller public 
safety agencies and other critical operations for its large coverage area and its ability to support 
unit to unit voice communications over significant distances and through many obstructions such 
as buildings and dense trees.  Large cities, such as New York, LA and Chicago depend on UHF 
for enhanced in-building penetration and States such as Virginia, Alaska, and Vermont depend 
on VHF for coverage over wide areas of rugged terrain.  Other public safety and other critical 
users also deploy systems on VHF and UHF spectrum to the extent that any capacity is available. 
Unfortunately all too often there is insufficient spectrum to fully meet the communications needs 
15 
of these entities.  TV white space spectrum would provide these public safety and critical users 
supplemental options for data at VHF and UHF and would be complementary to actions to 
deploy data systems in 700 MHz and above. 
Cognitive equipment designed for public safety and other critical uses should be capable 
of operating on any channel within TV channels 7-25.  This will assist public safety and other 
critical users in deploying products capable of utilizing any of the channels that might be 
available in a given area without the need for multiple radios.  To this end, Motorola 
recommends that devices operating in the TV white space support the ability for public safety 
and other critical users to pre-empt non-critical users, when necessary, on channels 7-25.  
Devices operating on TV channels 26-51 would not have this restraint, but devices that work 
below channel 26 should be required to support the monitoring necessary to be pre-empted.28   
In summary, Motorola believes that Public Safety and other critical users should have 
exclusive access to TV channels 14-20 for low powered devices and priority access to two 
additional VHF and two additional UHF channels from channels 7-25.  Given the flexibility of 
the technology necessary to make effective use of TV white space spectrum, we believe this is a 
workable approach for public safety and other critical users as well as commercial/consumer 
operations.  As experience is gained and products improved, it may be desirable to redefine these 
proposed preemption requirements in the future.  Given the flexibility of cognitive radios, 
28  
Motorola supports the use of disabling beacons to implement this recommendation.  See 
pages 18-19, infra. 
16 
redefining established pre-emption priorities should not require equipment modifications or 
trade-out.29 
III. 
SPECTRUM ACCESS METHODS. 
The Further Notice seeks additional comment on three methods for enabling interference 
free operation in the TV white space spectrum:  geolocation and database lookup, beacons or 
control signals, and spectrum sensing.  With regard to the use of geolocation and database 
lookup approaches, the Further Notice seeks specific comment on the development, 
maintenance, and availability of a comprehensive database of all TV and other incumbent 
stations.  The Commission asks whether third-party providers are willing and able to maintain 
such a database and also on the parameters that should be included in the database.  The 
Commission also seeks comment on the technical requirements for relying on the geo-
location/database approach, including the appropriate method of geo-location (GPS, professional 
installation, or other method) and for determining the required separation from authorized users 
in the TV bands.   
As for the use of control signals to regulate device transmissions, the Further Notice 
notes that many of the same issues surrounding the development of a database for geolocation 
techniques also apply to use of the control signals.  However, the Further Notice also seeks 
comment on the format and content of the control signal and asks how beacons can protect other

The FCC could require devices operating in channels 7-25 to have over-the-air 
programming technology to enable this flexibility although it is possible that market forces might 
obviate the need for regulation. 
17 
authorized services, such as wireless microphones, whose location may not be included in the 
databases.   
In previously filed comments, Motorola supported the use of beacons and geolocation 
database lookup techniques to avoid interference to incumbent users and offered specific 
recommendations for the implementation of these techniques.30  Motorola recommended that the 
Commission specify location accuracy rather than mandate use of a particular location 
technology such as GPS to encourage innovation in the field of location technology.  In addition, 
channel availability information sent by control signals to fixed and handheld units must be in a 
standard format and include a validity period for which the channel is available.  The device 
must also include fail-safe methods to cease operation if the control signal or database 
information cannot be updated or accessed.  Finally, Motorola noted that third party providers of 
vacant channel information (e.g., a frequency coordinator, industry association, local broadcast 
group) should be held liable for the accuracy of location data.   
With regard to spectrum sensing, the Commission has stated that its experience with 
Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS) implemented in the 5 GHz U-NII rules leads it to believe 
that similar spectrum sensing rules can be applied to TV band devices.  The Further Notice 
provides extensive discussion and numerous proposals for appropriate spectrum sensing rules for 
TV band devices including proposed rules for the appropriate detection threshold, channel 
30  
See, n. 6 supra. 
18 
availability check time, move time and non-occupancy period, bandwidth and antenna 
considerations and other issues.   
Motorola previously stated that it is premature to rely on such methods because of the 
difficulties involved in implementing sensing technology in this environment and continues to 
recommend that database and location information should be the final source for determination 
on whether or not to transmit.  While Motorola believes that cognitive radios will inherently have 
sensing capabilities for determining which candidate channels provide the best communications 
opportunities, it is not clear at this time whether those capabilities can be used for independent 
identification and protection of licensed incumbents. 
As the Commission moves forward in its studies and evaluation of techniques to open the 
TV white space it must consider the interaction between sensing techniques and how it 
corresponds to information contained in their database.  Issues include defining which 
information source may have precedence, what measures to take if a TV signal is sensed and is 
not part of the database, how frequently the database needs to be accessed if sensing is 
employed, and measures to take if the database could not be accessed.  Particularly in the early 
stages of this effort, the Commission should proceed conservatively to ensure protection of 
incumbent services and users. 
19 
For some licensed or other protected users, a static database is not practical.  For 
example, some wireless microphone usage can be predictable and hence protected via the 
database (e.g., studios, sporting events, political conventions).  Some uses such as news 
gathering are not as predictable and difficult to protect via a static database.  For this problem, 
Motorola sees three possible solutions: 
Sensing the licensed or otherwise protected user.  Sensing alone can be difficult. 
When considering lower power operations, identification of that signal is even 
more difficult.  For a wireless microphone, any detection from a discrete spectral
