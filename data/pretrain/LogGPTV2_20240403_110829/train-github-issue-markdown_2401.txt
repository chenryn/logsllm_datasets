  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
Using the `npm-name` module outputs `true` or `false` in a next project.
## Current Behavior
Attempts to use `npm-name` result in the error:
    This dependency was not found:  
    * electron in ./node_modules/npm-name/node_modules/got/index.js  
    To install it, you can run: npm install --save electron
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
In a Next.JS project:
    import npmName from 'npm-name'
    npmName('npm-name') // throws the error
## Context
Trying to use the `npm-name` module results in Next throwing an error because
electron is not installed. I don't want to introduce electron to the project
obviously, and looking through the source of `got`, I'm not sure why it's
being required.
