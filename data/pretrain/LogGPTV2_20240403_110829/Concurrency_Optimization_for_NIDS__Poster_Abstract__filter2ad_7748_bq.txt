PRESENTING AUTHOR: Chunping Tang, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China
CO-AUTHORS: Shuai-Zhen Zhou, Chang-Qiang Ke, Yang Ye
Natural products have been a major resource of new drugs due to their highly diverse structures and biological activities Searching for natural 
products with the potential to be lead compounds from traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) have drawn more and more attention A metabolomics 
investigation was carried out on a commonly used TCM Radix Stemonae, from which an array of alkaloids reflecting its therapeutic effects were 
discovered Radix Stemonae, known as Baibu in Chinese, is a commonly used antitussive agent The Chinese pharmacopeia documents three 
species, Stemona tuberosa, S sessilifolia and S japonica as its original plants, and spring and autumn as the collecting seasons Our previous 
investigations have revealed that the Stemona alkaloids are the characteristic secondary metabolites responsible for the therapeutic effects 
In this study, a metabolite profiling method based on the UPLC-QTof technique was established and applied for 218 samples of crude alkaloids 
prepared from three Stemona species collected in different localities and seasons PCA and PLS-DA models were used to analyze the data The 
results showed that the alkaloidal constituents vary greatly with species and localities while little with harvesting seasons The PCA model can be 
successfully applied to identify the species of unknown Stemona samples Chemical markers of each species were identified by using an PLS-DA 
model The results further revealed that the characteristic alkaloid of S sessilifolia collected in Shandong province is different from that collected in 
Anhui province The findings provide scientific evidence to support traditional descriptions of Baibu in medicinal books

An evaluation of different ripening conditions and postharvest treatments in mangosteen (Garcinia mangostana) using 
metabolomics approach
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Anjaritha Aulia Rizky Parijadi, Osaka University, Japan
CO-AUTHORS: Sobir Ridwani, Fenny M. Dwivany, Sastia P. Putri, Eiichiro Fukusaki
Mangosteen is a tropical fruit with a high market value but a relatively short shelf-life Despite being one of the most important tropical fruits, 
evaluation of different ripening condition and evaluation the effect after postharvest treatment to prolong shelf-life using metabolomics approach 
in mangosteen have never been studied The aims of this study were to evaluate the metabolic changes between different harvesting and ripening 
condition and to evaluate the effect of postharvest treatment in mangosteen Mangosteen ripening stage were collected with several different 
conditions (“on-tree”, and “off-tree”) The metabolite changes were investigated for each ripening condition Additionally, fruit was harvested in 
stage 2 and was treated with several different treatments (storage at low temperature (LT; 123 ± 14 °C) and stress inducer treatment (SI; methyl 
jasmonate and salicylic acid) in comparison with control treatment (normal temperature storage) and the metabolite changes were monitored over 
the course of 10 days after treatment Our findings clearly indicate that there is a similar trend of metabolic changes (the accumulation of some 
aroma precursor metabolites and firmness-related metabolites in the flesh and peel part, respectively) between two ripening conditions although 
the progression of “off-tree” ripening process observed through color changes occurred faster compared to “on-tree” ripening Additionally, the 
metabolome data and color changes observation showed that LT treatment could prolong shelf-life among all treatments in all fruit part It is the first 
report of the utilization of metabolomics to support postharvest development strategies in mangosteen

Effect of water restriction and rehydration on flavonoid profile in leaves of Eucalyptus urophylla
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Hana Karina Pereira da Silva, University of São Paulo, Brazil
CO-AUTHORS: Thaís Regiani Cataldi, Carlos Alberto Labate
Eucalyptus plantations have a great economic and environmental importance in Brazil Considering the climate change scenario and the cumulative 
precipitation deviations observed in these plantation areas in recent years, it is essential to understand how plants respond to stressful conditions 
Drought is one of the main factors limiting plant yield and survival Plants under water deficit can increase their reactive oxygen species content 
culminating in cell death Under such conditions, the biosynthesis of flavonoids is induced, suggesting their important role as an auxiliary antioxidant 
system This system is very important in plants under severe or multiple stresses once it can help these organisms cope with the given situation 
In this work, leaves of two commercial clones (AEC144 and IPB1) of Eucalyptus urophylla under water restriction and rehydration were evaluated 
in terms of physiological and biochemical parameters In addition, flavonoids profiles were analyzed combining a flavonoid enrichment extraction 
method and LC-MS/MS approach Water limitation provoked alterations in relative water content and in lipidic peroxidation On the other hand, 
alterations in these two parameters were not significant when both rehydrated and control plants were compared When plants under distinct 
water conditions and genotypes were compared (by volcano plot - MetaboAnalyst), we found differentially abundant metabolites (DAMs) The exact 
mass of these DAMs corresponding to the target flavonoids (quercetin, luteolin, kaempferol, apigenin and their derivatives) At this moment, we are 
working on the structural elucidation of these target metabolites by MS/MS

Large-scale screening of carotenoid and chlorophyll content in tomato cultivars by using the simple, rapid and  
quantitative method
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Yusuke Aono, University of Tsukuba, Japan
CO-AUTHORS: Yonathan Asikin, Ning Wang, Harry J Klee, Miyako Kusano
Tomato is one of the highest-value crops worldwide Modern tomato cultivars head to add commercially attractive factors, including flavors Wild 
tomato species, eg, Solanum lycopersicum ver cerasiforme and S pimpinellifolium, have a great potential to produce useful volatiles because 
of their large genomic diversities Previous study revealed that presence of volatiles in tomato fruits can be improved for taste of sweetness 
and sourness Furthermore, it contributes to add favorite flavors for tomato consumers Of these, apocarotenoid volatiles, which are one of the 
carotenoid derivatives, are enzymatically cleaved by carotenoid cleavage oxygenases Additionally, these volatiles have a large impact on the 
perception of flavor Therefore, it is important to investigate novel factors in the biosynthetic pathway for production of apocarotenoid volatiles 
However, it remains unclear what kinds of key enzymes and/or transcription factors contributing to produce apocarotenoid volatiles that have 
useful aroma In this study, we focused on the extent of chemical diversities in tomato cultivars to possess great potential to produce useful 
volatiles derived from carotenoid pathway To achieve it, we developed the high-throughput screening method to quantify important pigments, ie, 
lycopene and total carotenoid by using microplate reader We also quantified chlorophylls because it is expected that we could be predict tomato 
ripening stages We assayed 362 tomato cultivars including S lycopersicum, S lycopersicum ver cerasiforme, and S pimpinellifolium by using our 
developed system We will present what kinds of tomato cultivars contain specific content of total carotenoids, lycopene and chlorophylls in the 
assayed tomato fruits

PRESENTING AUTHOR: Sandrien Desmet, VIB, Belgium
CO-AUTHORS: Yvan Saeys, Rebecca Dauwe, Hoon Kim, Geert Goeminne, Ruben Vanholme, John Ralph, Kris Morreel, Wout Boerjan
The importance of maize for the production of food and industrially relevant products, eg bio-ethanol, as well as the enormous genetic diversity, 
a vast collection of mutant stocks and the high degree of genomic collinearity with other cereal crops, has led to the construction of several 
gene/transcript and protein databases, such as gramene and MaizeGDB However, Mass Spectrometry (MS) spectral databases of especially 
the secondary metabolome of maize are lagging behind Here, we present the DynLib MS spectral database for maize that was generated using 
different tissues (stem, leaf, ear, tassel and cob) The database contains both Quadrupole-Time-of-Flight-based MS/MS and Fourier Transform-
Ion Cyclotron Resonance-Ion Trap-based MSn spectra from both the known and unknown Liquid Chromatography (LC)-profiled compounds The 
RDynLib package was used to associate MS/MS and MSn spectra belonging to the same compound Implementing RDynLib into our structural 
elucidation pipeline led to the characterization of 428 compounds Based on this set of characterized compounds, we putatively annotated the 
maize- and tissue-specific conversions that are responsible for the prevailing mass differences that were picked from the LC-MS data

Study on anti-depressive constituents and mechanism of Herbal medicine, Chai-hu Shu Gan San
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Zhong-Mei Zou, Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, China
CO-AUTHORS: Zhong-Mei Zou, Meng Yu, Hong-Mei Jia
It is universally acknowledged that the complexity of TCMs makes the identification of the chemical constituents related to the efficacy and 
definition of their mechanism of action challenging Novel approaches are in great demand to provide deeper mechanistic insight into the clinical 
valuable effects Metabolomics, as one of the ‘omics’ technologies of systems biology, is the comparative analysis of metabolites and their dynamic 
flux associated with the response of living systems to pathophysiological stimuli or genetic modification By means of advanced analytical tools, 
including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and mass spectrometry (MS), in conjunction with the multivariate data analysis (MVA), metabolomics 
approach has been extensively applied in many areas such as diagnosis and treatment of disease, drug toxicity, biomarker discovery, and 
exploration of pathogenesis Chai-hu Shu Gan San Chaihu-Shu-Gan-San (CSGS), a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula containing seven 
herbal medicines, has been used in treatment of gastritis, peptic ulcer, irritable bowel syndrome and depression clinically This presentation will 
focus on investigation into its active constituents and mechanism of anti-depressive effect by using LC-MS/MS and HNMR metabolomics

EcoMetEoR - An enlightning platform for eco-metabolomic research
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Henriette Uthe, Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Germany
CO-AUTHORS: Alexander Weinhold, Fredd Vergara, Nicole M. van Dam
EcoMetEoR - An enlightning platform for eco-metabolomic research Eco-Metabolomics is a relatively new research discipline and describes the 
application of metabolomics techniques to ecology with the aim to characterize biochemical interactions of organisms across different spatial 
and temporal scales 1 Changes in metabolite concentrations can provide mechanistic evidence for biochemical processes that are relevant at 
ecological scales These include physiological, phenotypical and morphological responses of plants and communities to environmental changes 
and interactions with other organisms, too Although, eco-metabolomics is a powerful tool to combine extrinsic ecological research and intrinsic 
biochemical research, biodiversity researchers are often limited in applying metabolomics due to lack of facilities and expertise In addition, 
ecological research, especially in the field comes along with challenging sample quality and data analysis To overcome this lack the EcoMetEoR 
platform uniquely focuses on supporting and teaching ecologists and biodiversity researchers to implement metabolomics analyses in their 
research programs This support covers the experimental design, the accsess to the analytical equipment, sample preparation and data analysis 
and teaching during workshops and individual research stays

CO-AUTHORS: Anas Kamleh, Marit Almvik, Nina Elisabeth Nagy, Hans Ragnar Norli, Ari Hietala, Sven-Roar Odenmarck, Monica Fongen,  
Claire Dauly
Every fourth tree in the Scandinavian forest is infected with rot Root and butt rot fungi attack trees through the root and successively grow into 
the trunk degrading the core wood The infected log can no longer be used as construction materials, damaging its value We have employed tree 
metabolome analyses to differentiate and identify defense metabolites in Norwegian Spruce for new fungicide discovery as well as discovery of 
novel pathways that could be targeted by pesticides Wood cores from healthy and white rot infected (Heterobasidion parviporum) spruce trees 
were sampled at trunk heights 0, 16 and 32 meters and from different zones of the core A total of 73 samples were extracted and analyzed using 
LC connected to Q-Exactive(TM) and Orbitrap-IDX(TM) Mass spectrometers Data were processed using Compound Discoverer(TM) software which 
allows the pre-processing and statistical analysis of data within the same platform as well as including tools for compound identification such as 
database and library matching Compound identification was carried out by matching MS2 spectra and retention time to authentic standards, when 
feasible, or were tentatively annotated based on molecular formula search against compound databases or MSMS matching against mzCloud 
spectral library We also looked at compounds that displayed high abundance in the fungal infected core wood as opposed to the reaction zone and 
found a new compound in spruce with composition C12H8O7, tentatively identified as purpurogallin-4-carboxylic acid, which we believe is a product 
from the fungal detoxification of wood defense compounds

Metabolomic studies on conservation in response of cereal secondary metabolism to fungal infection
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Natalia Witaszak, Institute of Plant Genetics Polish Academy Sciences, Poland
CO-AUTHORS: Anna Piasecka
Several Fusarium spp, are economically devastating pathogens of cereals causing Fusarium head blight (FHB) which leads to reduction in 
crop yield world-wide In addition, production of mycotoxins in cereal grain can be harmful to animals and humans Elaboration of strategies for 
engineering resistance in cereal crops has to be boost by detailed knowledge about plant response against FHB at the molecular level Untargeted 
metabolomics based on LC-MS was applied for studying the conservation of plant immunity response on pathogen infection at metabolomic 
level among economically important crops barley and wheat as well as taxonomically related model plant Brachypodium distachyon MZmine2, 
MetaboAnalyst and MarVis software were used for defining the immunity-related secondary metabolites Response of metabolomics signals 
was highly species-specific Only small percent of differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) were common for all studied species However, 
conservation of cereals immune system manifested in the similarity of metabolic pathways responding to infection The most significant changes 
were observed for compounds annotated to metabolic pathway of tryptophan, especially in Brachypodium In addition, metabolism of alkaloid 
gramine and polyamines was re-programmed during infection in all studied plants Phenylpropanoids, mainly ferulic and p-coumaric acids and its 
conjugates with polyamines were the most numerous DAMs common among species LC-MS - based metabolomics proved to be excellent tools for 
studying the basics of plant immunity reactions to fungal pathogens in closely related species This study was supported by the National Science 
Centre grant Sonata 2015/17/D/NZ9/03347

Effect of growing conditions on the tomato root exudate and its associated root microbiome
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Bora Kim, University of Amsterdam, Netherlands
CO-AUTHORS: Bora Kim, Marco Bentlage, Benjamin Thiombiano, Harro Bouwmeester, Anouk Zancarini
The host-microbiome interaction is important for host functions and health While many endeavors were made to understand how the host shapes 
its microbiome in the human gut, the effect of plant metabolite exudation on the rhizosphere and root microbiome is still unclear due to the 
technically challenging root exudate collection and analysis Indeed, plant root exudates are mostly studied under artificial conditions, such as in 
hydroponics, to avoid unwanted contaminants from natural soils However, several questions are often arising with regard to the similarity of root 
exudate profiles under artificial and natural conditions To answer these questions, we compared plant root exudate composition under aeroponics 
and two natural soil conditions using an untargeted metabolomics approach The results showed that up to 29% of compounds in the root exudate 
were quantitatively different depending on the growing condition indicating that this has a significant impact on the root exudate composition In 
addition, we also analyzed the corresponding root and rhizosphere bacterial communities using 16S rRNA metabarcoding analysis The advanced 
statistical analyses used to link the root exudate profile to the microbiome composition to find molecular mechanisms involved in microbiome 
recruitment by plants will be discussed

Sting nematodes modify metabolomic profiles of host plants
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Denis Willett, Cornell University, United States
CO-AUTHORS: Camila C. Filgueiras
Many nematode endoparasites of plants have sophisticated means of modifying host metabolomes Root knot and cyst nematodes can create 
sophisticated feeding cells that co-opt host cellular machinery to upregulate amino acid and sugar production Given their lifecycle and long history 
of co-evolution with hosts, it makes some sense that endoparasitic plant nematodes can modify host metabolomes Here, we show that, based on 
global metabolomic profiling, nematode ectoparasites of plants can also modify host plant metabolomes Susceptible, moderately tolerant, and 
tolerant varieties displayed distinct metabolomic profiles in response to sting nematode feeding Specifically, sting nematodes suppress amino 
acids in susceptible varieties Upregulation of compounds linked to plant defense have negative impacts on sting nematode populations Pipecolic 
acid, linked to systemic acquired resistance induction, seems to play a large role in protecting tolerant varieties from sting nematode feeding and 
could be targeted in breeding programs

Metabolomic profiling defines key signals and antibiotics in drought-induced resistance to Cochliobolus heterostrophus
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Shawn Christensen, USDA-ARS, United States
CO-AUTHORS: Casey A. Chamberlain, Charles Hunter, Anna Block
In nature, plants are simultaneously challenged by multiple forms of biotic and abiotic stress that combine for diverse effects on crop production 
Here we examined disease resistance under drought stress conditions and observed that the magnitude of fungal-elicited maize responses are 
quantitatively dependent on the duration of drought prior to inoculation (DPI) Comparative analysis of watered and drought stressed Cochliobolus 
heterostrophus-infected plants using metabolomic fingerprinting resulted in complete multivariate separation of the two global metabolomes 
with 2,367 significant molecular features Among these features, phytohormones, amino acids, sugars, and oxylipins were strongly elicited by C 
heterostrophus infection in plants undergoing DPI, including the drought responsive signal 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid The phytohormone abscisic 
acid predictably increased in response to drought stress but was curiously suppressed in C heterostrophus-infected tissues vs damaged controls 
Examination of ent-kaurene-, β-macrocarpene- and benzoxazinoid-related antibiotics in fungal-elicited tissues displayed drought-dependent increases 
in production over an eight-day time course Transcript accumulation of the 1,3-β-glucanase PR6mb, pathogenesis-related 4 (PR4), and chitinase genes 
also demonstrated positive relationships between pathogen elicitation and the duration of DPI Collectively, our results indicate that drought stress 
potentiates maize defense mechanisms, contributing to heightened resistance against the common maize pathogen C heterostrophus

Adaptive metabolomes: defense-related reprogramming in Sorghum bicolor
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Ian Dubery, University of Johannesburg, South Africa
CO-AUTHORS: Charity Mareya, Fidele Tugizimana
Background: Burkholderia andropogonis is the causal agent of bacterial leaf stripe, one of the three major bacterial diseases affecting Sorghum 
bicolor However, the biochemical aspects of the pathophysiological host responses are not well understood An untargeted metabolomics 
approach was designed to understand molecular mechanisms underlying S bicolor–B andropogonis interactions At the 4-leaf stage two sorghum 
cultivars (NS 5511 and NS 5655), differing in disease susceptibility/resistance, were infected with B andropogonis, and the metabolic changes 
monitored over time Results: The NS 5511 cultivar displayed delayed signs of wilting and lesion progression compared to the NS 5655 cultivar, 
indicative of enhanced resistance The metabolomics results identified statistically significant metabolites as biomarkers associated with the 
sorghum defence These include the phytohormones salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and zeatin Moreover, metabolic reprogramming in an array of 
chemically diverse metabolites that span a wide range of metabolic pathways was associated with the defense response Signatory biomarkers 
included aromatic amino acids, shikimic acid, metabolites from the phenylpropanoid and flavonoid pathways, as well as fatty acids Enhanced 
synthesis and accumulation of apigenin and derivatives thereof, was a prominent feature of the altered metabolomes Conclusions: The analyses 
revealed an intricate and dynamic network metabolic pathways and metabolites comprisingthe sorghum defence arsenal towards B andropogonis 
in establishing an enhanced defensive capacity in support of resistance and disease suppression

Isotope assisted profiling of plant defense metabolites
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Maria Doppler, IFA-Tulln, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna (BOKU), Austria
CO-AUTHORS: Christoph Bueschl, Bernhard Kluger, Rainer Schuhmacher
Application of classical LC-MS based untargeted metabolomics workflows for the comparison of control and stress-treated plants results in the 
detection of numerous defense related metabolites Although a large number of metabolites can be detected and classified to be of biological 
interest, the majority remains unknown or unidentified, which complicates biological interpretation With our stable isotope labeling workflow we 
are not only able to effectively and reliably filter biologically relevant metabolites from background compounds, but also to obtain the number 
of labeling atoms (eg C and N) for all detected metabolites Furthermore, the application of isotopically labeled tracers allows us to detect 
submetabolomes that only consist of metabolites descending from the applied tracer (ie a biological pathway) In the presented study, global-
labeling as well as tracer-fate approaches were applied and combined in order to investigate the metabolic response of flowering wheat plants upon 
treatment with the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol The detected phenylalanine-derived submetabolome consisted of 172 metabolites and up to 30% of 
them were classified as defense related The substance class of hydroxycinnamic acid amides (HCAAs) turned out to be highly involved in the plants 
defense response as many of these metabolites’ abundances were significantly increased under deoxynivalenol stress conditions Based on these 
representative metabolites, the potential of SIL approaches for the annotation and identification of unknown metabolites is demonstrated for sum 
formula generation, database search and further characterization on the fullscan as well as on the MS2 level

Comparative host-parasite and within-colony metabolomics: Cerithideopsis californica trematode guild
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Zdenek Kamenik, Institute of Microbiology, Czech Republic
CO-AUTHORS: Daniel Metz, Ryan Hechinger, Martin Kurecka, Petr Marsik
Despite the vast diversity of trematodes and their medical importance, we still lack basic knowledge about the biology of these parasites in their 
first intermediate host The fact that these parasites are ‘phenotype hijackers’ (parasitic castrators), coupled with the recent discovery of social 
organization in some trematode species, makes the gastropod-trematode host-parasite system an attractive target for studies leveraging the 
power of comparative metabolomics with the experimental tractability of these organisms In this study, we used the potamidid snail Cerithideopsis 
californica and selected trematodes from the diverse guild exploiting it to answer three questions using untargeted mass spectrometry-based
