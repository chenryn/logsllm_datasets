**P-427: Metabolomics Profiling of a Traditional Chinese Medicine, Radix Stemonae**
- **Presenting Author**: Chunping Tang, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China
- **Co-Authors**: Shuai-Zhen Zhou, Chang-Qiang Ke, Yang Ye

**Abstract:**
Natural products are a significant source of new drugs due to their diverse structures and biological activities. The search for natural products with the potential to be lead compounds from traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) has gained increasing attention. This study conducted a metabolomics investigation of Radix Stemonae, a commonly used TCM known as Baibu in Chinese, which is an antitussive agent. The Chinese pharmacopeia lists three species—Stemona tuberosa, S. sessilifolia, and S. japonica—as the original plants, with spring and autumn as the recommended collecting seasons. Previous studies have shown that Stemona alkaloids are the characteristic secondary metabolites responsible for its therapeutic effects.

In this study, a metabolite profiling method based on UPLC-QTof was established and applied to 218 samples of crude alkaloids prepared from three Stemona species collected in different localities and seasons. PCA and PLS-DA models were used to analyze the data. The results indicated that the alkaloidal constituents vary significantly with species and localities but less so with harvesting seasons. The PCA model successfully identified the species of unknown Stemona samples. Chemical markers for each species were identified using a PLS-DA model. Notably, the characteristic alkaloid of S. sessilifolia collected in Shandong province differed from that collected in Anhui province. These findings provide scientific evidence supporting traditional descriptions of Baibu in medicinal books.

**P-428: Evaluation of Different Ripening Conditions and Postharvest Treatments in Mangosteen Using a Metabolomics Approach**
- **Presenting Author**: Anjaritha Aulia Rizky Parijadi, Osaka University, Japan
- **Co-Authors**: Sobir Ridwani, Fenny M. Dwivany, Sastia P. Putri, Eiichiro Fukusaki

**Abstract:**
Mangosteen, a high-value tropical fruit with a short shelf-life, has not been extensively studied using metabolomics to evaluate ripening conditions and postharvest treatments. This study aimed to evaluate metabolic changes under different harvesting and ripening conditions and to assess the effects of postharvest treatments. Mangosteen fruits at various ripening stages ("on-tree" and "off-tree") were collected, and their metabolite changes were investigated. Additionally, fruits harvested at stage 2 were treated with low-temperature storage (LT; 12.3 ± 1.4 °C) and stress inducer treatment (SI; methyl jasmonate and salicylic acid), and compared with control (normal temperature storage). Metabolite changes were monitored over 10 days after treatment.

The results showed a similar trend of metabolic changes (accumulation of aroma precursor metabolites and firmness-related metabolites in the flesh and peel, respectively) between the two ripening conditions, although "off-tree" ripening occurred faster. LT treatment was found to prolong shelf-life more effectively than other treatments. This study is the first to use metabolomics to support postharvest development strategies in mangosteen.

**P-429: Effect of Water Restriction and Rehydration on Flavonoid Profile in Leaves of Eucalyptus urophylla**
- **Presenting Author**: Hana Karina Pereira da Silva, University of São Paulo, Brazil
- **Co-Authors**: Thaís Regiani Cataldi, Carlos Alberto Labate

**Abstract:**
Eucalyptus plantations are economically and environmentally important in Brazil. Understanding how plants respond to stressful conditions, such as drought, is crucial given the climate change scenario and recent cumulative precipitation deviations. Drought can increase reactive oxygen species content, leading to cell death. Under water deficit, flavonoid biosynthesis is induced, suggesting their role as an auxiliary antioxidant system. This study evaluated the physiological and biochemical parameters of two commercial clones (AEC144 and IPB1) of Eucalyptus urophylla under water restriction and rehydration. Flavonoid profiles were analyzed using a flavonoid enrichment extraction method and LC-MS/MS approach.

Water limitation altered relative water content and lipid peroxidation, while these parameters did not differ significantly between rehydrated and control plants. Volcano plot analysis (MetaboAnalyst) revealed differentially abundant metabolites (DAMs) corresponding to target flavonoids (quercetin, luteolin, kaempferol, apigenin, and their derivatives). Structural elucidation of these target metabolites by MS/MS is ongoing.

**P-430: Large-Scale Screening of Carotenoid and Chlorophyll Content in Tomato Cultivars Using a Simple, Rapid, and Quantitative Method**
- **Presenting Author**: Yusuke Aono, University of Tsukuba, Japan
- **Co-Authors**: Yonathan Asikin, Ning Wang, Harry J Klee, Miyako Kusano

**Abstract:**
Tomato is one of the highest-value crops globally, with modern cultivars aiming to enhance commercially attractive factors, including flavors. Wild tomato species, such as Solanum lycopersicum var. cerasiforme and S. pimpinellifolium, have the potential to produce useful volatiles due to their large genomic diversity. Previous studies have shown that the presence of volatiles in tomatoes can improve taste and flavor perception. Apocarotenoid volatiles, derived from carotenoids, play a significant role in flavor. However, the key enzymes and transcription factors involved in their biosynthesis remain unclear.

This study developed a high-throughput screening method to quantify lycopene, total carotenoids, and chlorophylls in 362 tomato cultivars using a microplate reader. The results will present the specific content of these pigments in the assayed tomato fruits, providing insights into the potential for producing useful volatiles.

**P-431: Creating the DynLib Mass Spectrometry Database of the Maize Secondary Metabolome Using the RDynLib Package**
- **Presenting Author**: Sandrien Desmet, VIB, Belgium
- **Co-Authors**: Yvan Saeys, Rebecca Dauwe, Hoon Kim, Geert Goeminne, Ruben Vanholme, John Ralph, Kris Morreel, Wout Boerjan

**Abstract:**
Maize is essential for food and industrial product production, and its genetic diversity and genomic collinearity with other cereal crops have led to the creation of several gene/transcript and protein databases. However, mass spectrometry (MS) spectral databases for the maize secondary metabolome are lagging behind. This study presents the DynLib MS spectral database for maize, generated from different tissues (stem, leaf, ear, tassel, and cob). The database includes Quadrupole-Time-of-Flight-based MS/MS and Fourier Transform-Ion Cyclotron Resonance-Ion Trap-based MSn spectra from both known and unknown Liquid Chromatography (LC)-profiled compounds.

The RDynLib package was used to associate MS/MS and MSn spectra belonging to the same compound. Implementing RDynLib into the structural elucidation pipeline led to the characterization of 428 compounds. Based on this set, we putatively annotated maize- and tissue-specific conversions responsible for the prevailing mass differences picked from the LC-MS data.

**P-432: Study on Anti-Depressive Constituents and Mechanism of the Herbal Medicine, Chai-hu Shu Gan San**
- **Presenting Author**: Zhong-Mei Zou, Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, China
- **Co-Authors**: Meng Yu, Hong-Mei Jia

**Abstract:**
Traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) are complex, making it challenging to identify the chemical constituents related to their efficacy and mechanisms of action. Metabolomics, a systems biology approach, involves the comparative analysis of metabolites and their dynamic flux in response to pathophysiological stimuli or genetic modification. Advanced analytical tools, such as NMR and MS, combined with multivariate data analysis (MVA), have been widely applied in areas like disease diagnosis, drug toxicity, biomarker discovery, and pathogenesis exploration.

Chai-hu Shu Gan San (CSGS), a TCM formula containing seven herbal medicines, is used to treat gastritis, peptic ulcer, irritable bowel syndrome, and depression. This presentation focuses on investigating the active constituents and anti-depressive mechanism of CSGS using LC-MS/MS and HNMR metabolomics.

**P-433: EcoMetEoR - An Enlightening Platform for Eco-Metabolomic Research**
- **Presenting Author**: Henriette Uthe, Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Germany
- **Co-Authors**: Alexander Weinhold, Fredd Vergara, Nicole M. van Dam

**Abstract:**
Eco-metabolomics is a relatively new research discipline that applies metabolomics techniques to ecology to characterize biochemical interactions across different spatial and temporal scales. Changes in metabolite concentrations can provide mechanistic evidence for biochemical processes relevant at ecological scales, including physiological, phenotypical, and morphological responses of plants and communities to environmental changes and interactions with other organisms.

Despite its potential, eco-metabolomics is often limited by a lack of facilities and expertise. The EcoMetEoR platform supports and teaches ecologists and biodiversity researchers to implement metabolomics analyses in their research programs. This support covers experimental design, access to analytical equipment, sample preparation, data analysis, and teaching during workshops and individual research stays.

**P-434: Metabolomics as a Discovery Tool for Bioprospecting and Detection of Defense Compounds During Fungal Infection of Spruce Wood**
- **Presenting Author**: Marie-Pierre Pavageau, Thermo Fisher Scientific, France
- **Co-Authors**: Anas Kamleh, Marit Almvik, Nina Elisabeth Nagy, Hans Ragnar Norli, Ari Hietala, Sven-Roar Odenmarck, Monica Fongen, Claire Dauly

**Abstract:**
Root and butt rot fungi, such as Heterobasidion parviporum, infect trees through the roots and degrade the core wood, reducing its value. This study employed tree metabolome analyses to differentiate and identify defense metabolites in Norwegian Spruce for new fungicide discovery and to discover novel pathways that could be targeted by pesticides. Wood cores from healthy and white rot infected spruce trees were sampled at different trunk heights and zones. A total of 73 samples were extracted and analyzed using LC connected to Q-Exactive™ and Orbitrap-IDX™ Mass spectrometers.

Data were processed using Compound Discoverer™ software, allowing pre-processing and statistical analysis within the same platform. Compound identification was carried out by matching MS2 spectra and retention time to authentic standards or tentatively annotated based on molecular formula search against compound databases or MSMS matching against mzCloud spectral library. A new compound, tentatively identified as purpurogallin-4-carboxylic acid, was found in fungal-infected core wood, believed to be a product of fungal detoxification of wood defense compounds.

**P-435: Metabolomic Studies on Conservation in Response of Cereal Secondary Metabolism to Fungal Infection**
- **Presenting Author**: Natalia Witaszak, Institute of Plant Genetics, Polish Academy of Sciences, Poland
- **Co-Authors**: Anna Piasecka

**Abstract:**
Fusarium spp. are economically devastating pathogens of cereals, causing Fusarium head blight (FHB) and producing mycotoxins harmful to animals and humans. Detailed knowledge about plant responses to FHB at the molecular level is essential for engineering resistance in cereal crops. Untargeted metabolomics based on LC-MS was applied to study the conservation of plant immunity responses to pathogen infection among barley, wheat, and the model plant Brachypodium distachyon.

MZmine2, MetaboAnalyst, and MarVis software were used to define immunity-related secondary metabolites. The response of metabolomics signals was highly species-specific, with only a small percentage of differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) common to all species. However, the conservation of cereal immune systems was evident in the similarity of metabolic pathways responding to infection. Significant changes were observed in the tryptophan metabolic pathway, especially in Brachypodium. Metabolism of the alkaloid gramine and polyamines was reprogrammed during infection in all studied plants. Phenylpropanoids, mainly ferulic and p-coumaric acids and their conjugates with polyamines, were the most numerous DAMs common among species. LC-MS-based metabolomics proved to be an excellent tool for studying the basics of plant immunity reactions to fungal pathogens in closely related species.

**P-436: Effect of Growing Conditions on the Tomato Root Exudate and Its Associated Root Microbiome**
- **Presenting Author**: Bora Kim, University of Amsterdam, Netherlands
- **Co-Authors**: Marco Bentlage, Benjamin Thiombiano, Harro Bouwmeester, Anouk Zancarini

**Abstract:**
Host-microbiome interactions are crucial for host functions and health. While much effort has been made to understand how the human gut shapes its microbiome, the effect of plant metabolite exudation on the rhizosphere and root microbiome remains unclear due to the technical challenges of root exudate collection and analysis. Plant root exudates are often studied under artificial conditions, such as hydroponics, to avoid contaminants from natural soils. However, questions arise regarding the similarity of root exudate profiles under artificial and natural conditions.

This study compared plant root exudate composition under aeroponics and two natural soil conditions using an untargeted metabolomics approach. Up to 29% of compounds in the root exudate were quantitatively different depending on the growing condition, indicating a significant impact on the root exudate composition. The corresponding root and rhizosphere bacterial communities were also analyzed using 16S rRNA metabarcoding. Advanced statistical analyses were used to link the root exudate profile to the microbiome composition, revealing molecular mechanisms involved in microbiome recruitment by plants.

**P-437: Sting Nematodes Modify Metabolomic Profiles of Host Plants**
- **Presenting Author**: Denis Willett, Cornell University, United States
- **Co-Authors**: Camila C. Filgueiras

**Abstract:**
Many nematode endoparasites of plants modify host metabolomes by creating sophisticated feeding cells that co-opt host cellular machinery to upregulate amino acid and sugar production. This study shows that nematode ectoparasites, such as sting nematodes, can also modify host plant metabolomes. Susceptible, moderately tolerant, and tolerant varieties displayed distinct metabolomic profiles in response to sting nematode feeding. Specifically, sting nematodes suppress amino acids in susceptible varieties. Upregulation of compounds linked to plant defense negatively impacts sting nematode populations. Pipecolic acid, linked to systemic acquired resistance induction, plays a significant role in protecting tolerant varieties from sting nematode feeding and could be targeted in breeding programs.

**P-438: Metabolomic Profiling Defines Key Signals and Antibiotics in Drought-Induced Resistance to Cochliobolus heterostrophus**
- **Presenting Author**: Shawn Christensen, USDA-ARS, United States
- **Co-Authors**: Casey A. Chamberlain, Charles Hunter, Anna Block

**Abstract:**
Plants face multiple biotic and abiotic stresses simultaneously, affecting crop production. This study examined disease resistance under drought stress conditions and found that the magnitude of fungal-elicited maize responses is quantitatively dependent on the duration of drought prior to inoculation (DPI). Comparative analysis of watered and drought-stressed Cochliobolus heterostrophus-infected plants using metabolomic fingerprinting resulted in complete multivariate separation of the two global metabolomes, with 2,367 significant molecular features. Among these, phytohormones, amino acids, sugars, and oxylipins were strongly elicited by C. heterostrophus infection in plants undergoing DPI, including the drought-responsive signal 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid. The phytohormone abscisic acid increased predictably in response to drought stress but was curiously suppressed in C. heterostrophus-infected tissues. Examination of ent-kaurene-, β-macrocarpene-, and benzoxazinoid-related antibiotics in fungal-elicited tissues displayed drought-dependent increases over an eight-day time course. Transcript accumulation of the 1,3-β-glucanase PR6mb, pathogenesis-related 4 (PR4), and chitinase genes also demonstrated positive relationships between pathogen elicitation and the duration of DPI. Collectively, our results indicate that drought stress potentiates maize defense mechanisms, contributing to heightened resistance against C. heterostrophus.

**P-439: Adaptive Metabolomes: Defense-Related Reprogramming in Sorghum bicolor**
- **Presenting Author**: Ian Dubery, University of Johannesburg, South Africa
- **Co-Authors**: Charity Mareya, Fidele Tugizimana

**Abstract:**
Burkholderia andropogonis is the causal agent of bacterial leaf stripe, one of the major diseases affecting Sorghum bicolor. The biochemical aspects of the pathophysiological host responses are not well understood. An untargeted metabolomics approach was designed to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying S. bicolor–B. andropogonis interactions. Two sorghum cultivars (NS 5511 and NS 5655), differing in disease susceptibility/resistance, were infected with B. andropogonis, and the metabolic changes were monitored over time.

The NS 5511 cultivar displayed delayed signs of wilting and lesion progression compared to the NS 5655 cultivar, indicative of enhanced resistance. The metabolomics results identified statistically significant metabolites as biomarkers associated with sorghum defense, including the phytohormones salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and zeatin. Metabolic reprogramming in an array of chemically diverse metabolites spanning a wide range of metabolic pathways was associated with the defense response. Signatory biomarkers included aromatic amino acids, shikimic acid, metabolites from the phenylpropanoid and flavonoid pathways, and fatty acids. Enhanced synthesis and accumulation of apigenin and its derivatives were prominent features of the altered metabolomes. The analyses revealed an intricate and dynamic network of metabolic pathways and metabolites comprising the sorghum defense arsenal, supporting resistance and disease suppression.

**P-440: Isotope-Assisted Profiling of Plant Defense Metabolites**
- **Presenting Author**: Maria Doppler, IFA-Tulln, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna (BOKU), Austria
- **Co-Authors**: Christoph Bueschl, Bernhard Kluger, Rainer Schuhmacher

**Abstract:**
Classical LC-MS-based untargeted metabolomics workflows for comparing control and stress-treated plants result in the detection of numerous defense-related metabolites. However, the majority of these remain unknown or unidentified, complicating biological interpretation. Our stable isotope labeling workflow not only filters biologically relevant metabolites from background compounds but also provides the number of labeling atoms (e.g., C and N) for all detected metabolites. Furthermore, the application of isotopically labeled tracers allows us to detect submetabolomes consisting of metabolites descending from the applied tracer (i.e., a biological pathway).

In this study, global-labeling and tracer-fate approaches were combined to investigate the metabolic response of flowering wheat plants upon treatment with the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol. The detected phenylalanine-derived submetabolome consisted of 172 metabolites, with up to 30% classified as defense-related. Hydroxycinnamic acid amides (HCAAs) were highly involved in the plant's defense response, with many of these metabolites' abundances significantly increased under deoxynivalenol stress conditions. The potential of SIL approaches for the annotation and identification of unknown metabolites is demonstrated for sum formula generation, database search, and further characterization on the fullscan and MS2 levels.

**P-441: Comparative Host-Parasite and Within-Colony Metabolomics: Cerithideopsis californica Trematode Guild**
- **Presenting Author**: Zdenek Kamenik, Institute of Microbiology, Czech Republic
- **Co-Authors**: Daniel Metz, Ryan Hechinger, Martin Kurecka, Petr Marsik

**Abstract:**
Despite the vast diversity and medical importance of trematodes, basic knowledge about their biology in their first intermediate host is lacking. The fact that these parasites are "phenotype hijackers" (parasitic castrators) and the recent discovery of social organization in some trematode species make the gastropod-trematode host-parasite system an attractive target for studies leveraging the power of comparative metabolomics. This study used the potamidid snail Cerithideopsis californica and selected trematodes from the diverse guild exploiting it to answer three questions using untargeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomics.
