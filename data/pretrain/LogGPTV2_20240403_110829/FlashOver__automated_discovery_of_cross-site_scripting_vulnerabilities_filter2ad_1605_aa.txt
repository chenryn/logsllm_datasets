## Abstract
The modern internet is replete with dynamic web applications that attract a vast number of users. During their browsing sessions, users frequently interact with Rich Internet Applications (RIAs) such as Flash banners and media players. While it is well-documented that Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities can be exploited in HTML-based web applications to steal credentials or cause other malicious activities, the academic community has largely overlooked the presence of XSS vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash applications. These vulnerabilities are particularly concerning because they do not require an enclosing HTML ecosystem to be exploited.

In this paper, we introduce FlashOver, a system designed to automatically detect XSS vulnerabilities in RIAs by combining static and dynamic code analysis. FlashOver ensures no false positives in its reports. We conducted a large-scale experiment using FlashOver to analyze Flash applications on the top 1,000 internet sites, revealing XSS vulnerabilities in 64 of these sites, including six in the top 50.

## 1. Introduction
Over the past fifteen years, the web has transformed from a simple set of protocols for exchanging static documents to an integral part of daily life for billions of users. This transformation has been driven by open standards like HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, as well as proprietary plugins such as Adobe Flash and Microsoft Silverlight. Flash, in particular, has become the most common way to deliver Rich Internet Applications (RIAs) to desktop users, with near-complete market penetration.

This rapid evolution has not gone unnoticed by attackers, who have shifted their focus from server-side infrastructure to client-side attacks. Client-side attacks, which target the web application, browser, or user, often result in the theft of user credentials or the installation of malware.

Flash, being a key technology in the web experience, is also a significant attack vector. XSS vulnerabilities in Flash applications can be exploited if interactions between the Flash application and the DOM or browser are not adequately protected. Such vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code, which can then be executed in the context of the website hosting the vulnerable Flash application.

In this paper, we present FlashOver, a system capable of automated detection of XSS vulnerabilities in Flash applications. FlashOver combines static and dynamic analysis to identify and test potentially exploitable variables. Our evaluation, conducted on the top 1,000 internet sites, revealed XSS vulnerabilities in many well-known websites, including ebay.com, skype.com, mozilla.org, and apple.com.

The main contributions of this paper are:
- A detailed analysis of an often-overlooked XSS attack vector in web application development.
- The design and implementation of FlashOver, a fully automated system that uses a combination of static and dynamic analysis to identify Flash applications vulnerable to code injection attacks.
- An evaluation of our system using Flash applications from the top internet websites, demonstrating the prevalence of this vulnerability and the effectiveness of FlashOver in detecting it.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides background on XSS attacks and the Adobe Flash platform. Section 3 describes the general architecture of FlashOver, followed by our implementation choices and rationale in Section 4. In Section 5, we evaluate our prototype by discovering previously unreported vulnerabilities in Flash applications from the top 1,000 Alexa sites. Section 6 discusses ethical considerations, Section 7 reviews related work, and Section 8 concludes the paper.

## 2. Background
### 2.1 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
XSS attacks are a type of code injection attack where an attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a web page. When a victim visits the vulnerable page, the injected code is executed in the context of the website, allowing the attacker to steal session cookies, perform phishing, or alter the page's appearance.

### 2.2 Adobe Flash
Adobe Flash is a proprietary multimedia platform used to create RIAs. Flash applications are embedded in SWF files, which contain multimedia elements and byte-code-compiled ActionScript (AS) code. ActionScript allows developers to handle events, design interactions, and communicate with the embedding browser and remote servers.

### 2.3 Using SWF Files
SWF files are typically embedded in HTML using `<object>` or `<embed>` tags. Flash supports two methods for passing values to Flash objects:
- **FlashVars directive**: Values can be passed to specific variables when embedding a SWF file using the `FlashVars` parameter.
- **GET parameters**: Values can also be passed via GET parameters in the URL.

These methods allow for dynamic data to be provided at load-time, making Flash applications flexible but also potentially vulnerable to XSS attacks if not properly secured.
