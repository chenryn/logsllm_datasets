User: I would like to know if there is any Linux distribution where you can easily install and use Python 3. This means a distribution that will provide not only Python 3 binaries and updates but also python modules.
I know that probably we are not going to see any python 3 as the default python interpretor so soon but at least I would like to see latest 2.x as default (2.6+) one and the alternative one already installed.
Probably it is a question between major distributions: Ubuntu, Fedora or Suse?
Assistant: Gentoo has Python3 (I have 2.6.4-r1 and 3.1.2-r3 installed, 2.6 being the default). A quick search reveals that ebuilds of python libraries tested on both 2.x and 3.x have already been built for both versions on my machine (thank God for python-updater, obviously).
Gentoo + Python developing is a very nice combination (if you do like the way Gentoo works, that is).
