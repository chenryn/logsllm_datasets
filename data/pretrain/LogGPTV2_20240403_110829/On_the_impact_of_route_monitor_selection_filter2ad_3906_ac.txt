ternet as possible. Figure 6 shows the fraction of BGP routing
events observed by the set of vantage points selected. Notice there
is a huge difference between random selection and the other three
schemes, indicating that vantage points associated with core net-
works (i.e., with high degree and many links, and originating many
addresses) are more likely to observe network instabilities.
IP preﬁx hijacking detection: Intuitively, more monitors enable
more diverse paths to be observed. Therefore, the IP preﬁx hijack-
ing detection system has a higher chance of detecting all hijacks.
However, based on our simulations, we observe there still exist
attacker-victim pairs that can evade detection even using all the
monitoring feeds we have access to. Studying to what extent at-
tackers can evade detection is important for knowing the limitation
of current detection systems due to visibility constraints.
The main metric we study is the number of attacker-victim pairs
that can evade detection. As shown in Figure 7(a), with 10 nodes
deployed in the random scheme, 0.35% of all possible attacker-
victim pairs can evade the detection, which is the worst case we
observe from our simulation. We also show changes in the average
number of evading attackers for each victim in Figure 7(b), and in
the average number of victims an attacker can attack without being
detected in Figure 7(c). Overall, address block scheme performs
similar to the random scheme, while greedy performs the best in
most cases.
4.4 Inference of network properties
In the following we analyze the effect of vantage point selection
on inference of AS relationships and AS-level paths. We study two
algorithms for path inference.

Figure 9: Number of matched top degree AS in all observed AS
paths
Figure 10: Sampled path prediction accuracy: exact matching
(new algorithm)
We ﬁrst study commonly used path inference algorithms relying
on AS relationships as indicated in Table 1. In particular, we ap-
ply Gao’s degree-based relationship inference scheme [8] and then
predict paths enforcing the AS relationships. Figure 8 shows that,
surprisingly, as the number of monitors increases, the accuracy may
decrease compared with observed AS paths.
We conjecture this may be caused by the nature of the degree-
based relationship inference algorithm. The algorithm determines
the AS relationships based on the relative degree values of AS
nodes within an AS path. The topology obtained from the vantage
points tends to be quite complete already in terms of relative degree
information. As more vantage points are added, more noise may be
introduced causing inaccuracies in inferred AS relationships.
To further understand this, we analyze the changes in the top
degree node per path to explain why the increase in number of van-
tage points does not always result in increased accuracy. Based
on the degree of each node observed in the topology using all data
available, we identify the top degree AS for each observed AS path.
From each set of vantage points we also locate the top-degree node.
We then examine for each monitor data set, the fraction of matched
top ASes for all AS paths compared with the case for the complete
topology, as shown in Figure 9. The ﬂuctuation in the graph indi-
cates that additional BGP data does not consistently improve the
estimation of the top-degree nodes in each path.
We emphasize that we have made an important observation:
BGP data from more vantage points may not necessarily increase
the accuracy of inferred network properties. The inference algo-
rithm [8] is based on degree, which may vary in different selection
of monitors: the further away an AS is to the monitor, the more
incomplete the observed degree is. We point out that developing
inference algorithms that are less sensitive to available data feeds
but also more fully utilize the data is important in this area. We
also observe that proﬁt-driven path prediction as shown in Figure 8
actually performs worse than length-driven prediction. This could
be due to the fact that proﬁt-driven path selection is more sensitive
to the impact caused by inaccurate AS relationship inference.
Besides accuracy, we also perform other sanity checks for in-
ferred relationships. Two metrics are used: ﬁrst, some observed
paths are considered as invalid based on the inferred relationships.
The fraction of such invalid paths can be used as an indication of
inaccurate AS relationship inference. We found that the number
of observed invalid paths slightly decreases as the number of van-
tage point increases. Second, for some node pairs no valid paths
are predicted. Such disconnected node pairs can be used as another
metric of relationship inference inaccuracy. The number of invalid
paths generally decreases with more vantage points as expected;
similarly, the number of AS pairs with valid paths increases with
vantage point. Greedy is again observed to be the best for identify-
ing valid paths.
4.4.2 AS-relationship-independent path prediction
In the following, we study the behavior of a recent proposed path
prediction algorithm [23] that does not rely on AS relationships for
prediction. For each deployment scenario, we use all observed AS
paths to construct an initial topology model, and then use observed
AS paths of 50 random preﬁxes to iteratively train the topology
model using the reﬁnement algorithm speciﬁed. The trained model
is used to predict the paths from any AS to the same 50 preﬁxes.
To evaluate the accuracy of the predicted paths, we consider
three sets of paths. The ﬁrst set, total, is the AS paths to the
50 preﬁxes observed from the total default-free 165 vantage point
ASes. The second set observed is the AS paths to the 50 preﬁxes
observed from all the monitors a particular deployment scenario.
The third set unobserved is the complementary set of observed
in total. The algorithm always produces a perfect match on the
observed set. Therefore, we use the other two sets for evalua-
tion. Note that the path prediction in Section 4.4.1 is evaluated on
observed instead.
Figure 10 shows the fraction of paths in total and unobserved
that match the predicted paths. Overall, all schemes accurately pre-
dict 28% ∼ 60% of the unobserved paths in all scenarios. This
number is lower than those in [10] because we do not include suf-
ﬁx subpaths in the evaluation sets, and hence do not give partial
credits to the paths that partially match the prediction. The match
percentage on unobserved generally does not increase with more
monitors. The above observations show the difﬁculty of path pre-
diction: predicting an unobserved path does not beneﬁt much from
observing its subpaths or its reverse path. The ﬁgure also shows
that the accuracy on the total set improves with more monitors,
which is a result of more paths being observed. Greedy performs
best on the total set because this scheme observes most paths.
5. CONCLUSIONS
In this work we illustrate the importance of route monitor se-
lection on various applications relying on BGP data: discovery of
static network properties, discovery of dynamic network proper-
ties and inference of network properties. For the ﬁrst class, more
vantage points generally improve completeness and accuracy of the
topological properties studied. We show that it is important to take
into consideration possibility of evasion due to visibility constraints
for detecting routing attacks. The coverage of routing instability
monitoring varies signiﬁcantly across different monitor selection.
Finally, we take the ﬁrst step at analyzing how various AS path
inference algorithms and a commonly used AS relationship infer-
ence algorithm are impacted. Our work motivates future work in
the area of identifying algorithms less sensitive to the input routing
data set.
