User: Please explain the principles of distributed storage systems, and list several common distributed storage systems.
Assistant: distributed storage system refers to a storage system that improves storage performance and reliability by storing data on multiple nodes. The principles of the distributed storage system include the following aspects: 1. Data segmentation and distribution: the data is divided into multiple parts, and then these data are stored on different nodes to realize distributed storage. 2. Data replication and synchronization: Data replication is stored on multiple nodes to ensure data reliability and high availability. When a node fails, data recovery can be achieved through replicated data. 3. Load balancing: Evenly distribute access requests to multiple nodes to achieve load balancing and prevent a node from being overloaded. 4. Data consistency: ensure the synchronization of data on multiple nodes, and when the data changes, it can be synchronized to other nodes in time. Common distributed storage systems include: 1. Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS): It is a part of Apache Hadoop, a distributed file system for storing large-scale data. 2. Ceph: It is a distributed storage system that provides the ability to store objects, blocks and files. 3. GlusterFS: It is an open source distributed file system that can store large-scale data on multiple nodes. 4. Cassandra: It is a distributed NoSQL database that can provide high-availability and scalable data storage services. 5. Riak: It is a vector clock-based distributed key-value storage system that can provide high availability and reliability data storage services.
