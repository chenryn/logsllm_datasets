I am currently working with Symfony 2.3 and have implemented a custom voter, following the guidelines provided in the official documentation (http://symfony.com/doc/2.3/cookbook/security/voters.html). While my issue appears to be similar to #8467, I believe the use case is different as I do not use a user provider and anonymous authentication is sufficient for my needs.

The problem I'm encountering is that when access is denied by my custom voter, an `InsufficientAuthenticationException` is thrown, which contains an `AccessDeniedException` as its previous exception. My expectation was to simply return a 403 Forbidden response, rather than a 500 Internal Server Error.

Here are some additional details about my setup:
- I have two firewalls defined.
  - The first (`dev`) firewall ignores all development-related paths and has security disabled.
  - The second (`default`) firewall allows anonymous users.
- Here is my `security.yml` configuration:

```yaml
security:
    encoders:
        Acme\DemoBundle\Entity\Person:
            id: acme.demo.blowfish_password_encoder

    providers:
        in_memory:
            memory: ~

    firewalls:
        dev:
            pattern: ^/(_(profiler|wdt)|css|images|js)/
            security: false

        default:
            anonymous: ~

    access_control:
        - { path: ^/, roles: IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY }

    access_decision_manager:
        strategy: unanimous
```

Could someone provide insight into why the `InsufficientAuthenticationException` is being thrown and how I can ensure that a 403 Forbidden response is returned instead of a 500 Internal Server Error?
