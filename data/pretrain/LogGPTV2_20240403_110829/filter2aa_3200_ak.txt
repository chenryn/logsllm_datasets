Current Interoperable Communications Initiatives 
• 
Beginning in 2005, Pennsylvania, through 
the Philadelphia UASI, was the lead state 
coordinating the development of a new tri-
state interoperable communications system 
impacting the states of Delaware, New 
Jersey, and Pennsylvania, approximately a 
dozen county governments and the federal government.  This state-of-the art system will provide 
voice and data interoperability to identify and manage incident responses that cross state and 
municipal boundaries.   
• 
Pennsylvania is completing the roll out of statewide voice and data interoperability across the 
state’s 800 MHz Public Safety Radio Network.  This network connects key state agency 
headquarters and field operations, the 67 county emergency managers and 9-1-1 centers.  It also 
includes digital voice units at the county 9-1-1 centers to allow legacy first responder radio 
systems to communicate with state agencies and neighboring county emergency operations 
centers.   
• 
Pennsylvania is upgrading a 
satellite-based interoperable 
voice and data network 
connecting the Pennsylvania 
Emergency Management 
Agency, the 67 county 
emergency management 
agencies and 9-1-1 centers 
to include; state health 
department locations, and 
Pennsylvania State Police 
consolidated dispatch 
centers across the state.

• Puerto Rico is in the process of establishing a command post 
radio interoperability system that will initially link twelve 
public safety agencies and will be further broadened to 
include additional sites. 
• FY 2004: $4,000,000 to the Puerto Rico Power Authority to develop fiber optic links, 
install broadband communication equipment and intruder detection and access control 
systems as security for 84 
power stations.

South Dakota is working to ensure that they have interoperable 
communications throughout the state by updating their equipment and 
placing towers/repeaters.  Their major concern is that with rural nature of 
their state. As a result, they have been creative is setting up their systems. 
South Dakota continues to 
improve their communications 
to ensure that they can 
communicate within the 
counties as well as throughout 
the state.
