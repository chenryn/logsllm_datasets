User: I want to have jupyter notebook installed. But on my MacBook Pro (OS X El Capitan) and my web server (Debian 7), I get the same error: jupyter notebook is not a jupyter command. 
I just follow the official installation instruction. And no error occurs during installation. 
I searched for solutions but none of them works. What should I do now?
Assistant: After trying a bunch of solution, I found the quickest solution: using conda instead of pip.   Or just use anaconda, which provides jupyter, too.
