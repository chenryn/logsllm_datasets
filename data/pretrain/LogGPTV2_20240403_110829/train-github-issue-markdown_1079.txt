Hello,
the only thing keeping me away from atom is the fact that it's crashing
everytime I try to open a large file, jquery.min.js for example. In
comparision to sublime, this is pretty bad because when atom doesn't crash, it
takes up to 10 seconds to load the syntax highlighter.
Is there an issue similar to this or is this already tracked?
I'm using OSX Yosemite and Windows 8.1
