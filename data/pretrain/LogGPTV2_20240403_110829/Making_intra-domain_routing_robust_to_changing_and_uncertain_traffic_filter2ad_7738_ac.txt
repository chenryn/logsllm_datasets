Figure 2: Cumulative fraction of networks/TMs for which a performance ratio of under 1.05% or 1.25% was
obtained below a certain error margin.
metric networks can grow logarithmically as they scale up.
Some supporting evidence, however, for the “asymptotics”
of our observation is that two natural and very diﬀerent fam-
ilies of graphs: the cliques (all complete graphs on n nodes)
and the cycles (all cyclic paths on n nodes), have optimal
oblivious ratio of 2 − 2/n, that is, the optimal oblivious ra-
tio remains smaller than 2 when the network sizes grow (see
Section 6).
Performance under link failures. We performed a pre-
liminary evaluation of the performance of diﬀerent routings
under link failures. Since each PoP to PoP link typically
corresponds to several physical links, we simulated link fail-
ures where a random link “loses” 50% or 80% of its capacity.
Table 3 shows the performance ratio of diﬀerent routings on
the “failed” network. The set of TMs considered are the
gravity TMs with an error margin of 2.5. The routings con-
sidered are (i) the optimal routing on the failed network,
(ii) the optimal routing on the original network, where only
ﬂow that traverses a failed link is rerouted, and the rerouted
ﬂow is routed proportionally to the unaﬀected part of the
routing of the same OD pair, (iii) the OSPF routing. These
results indicate that the optimal routing for the non-failed
network, although not optimized for failures, typically out-
performs OSPF routing under failures. The explanation is
that a good “oblivious” routing tends to use many avail-
able paths for each OD pair, a property that increases its
resilience to failures. An interesting open question is to de-
sign and evaluate routings that have guaranteed restoration
performance (eg, optimize performance under the constraint
that only aﬀected ﬂows are rerouted).
5. LP MODELS
We start by stating some lemmas we used for reducing the
size of the LP model. We then summarize a recent result [3]
which established that an optimal oblivious routing (and the
oblivious ratio) of a network can be computed in polynomial
time in the size of the network. We then develop a simpliﬁed
LP model that achieves considerably faster running times,
and adapt this model to handle interval restrictions on OD-
pair demands.
