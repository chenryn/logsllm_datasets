APPENDIX J: RESOURCES 
RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER PROGRAMS AND PUBLICATIONS  
This revision to NIST SP 800-161 builds upon concepts described in a number of NIST and 
other publications to facilitate integration with the agencies’ existing enterprise-wide activities, 
as well as a series of legislative developments following its initial release. These resources are 
complementary and help enterprises build risk-based information security programs to protect 
their operations and assets against a range of diverse and increasingly sophisticated threats. This 
publication will be revised to remain consistent with the NIST SP 800-53 security controls 
catalog using an iterative process as the C-SCRM discipline continues to mature.
