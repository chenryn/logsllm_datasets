User: Please write a Python script to download images from specified websites in batches and save them to the local file system.
Assistant: The following is a Python script that can batch download images from a specified website and save them to the local file system. You need to pass the URL of the website, the path where the file is stored and the number of downloads to the script as parameters. ```python import requests import os from bs4 import BeautifulSoup import sys url = sys.argv[1] # Website URL directory = sys.argv[2] # File storage path limit = int(sys.argv[3]) # Number of downloads if not os.path.exists(directory): os.makedirs(directory) response = requests.get(url) soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser') img_tags = soup.find_all('img' ) count = 0 for img in img_tags: if count == limit: break img_url = img['src'] img_response = requests.get(img_url) filename = os.path.join(directory, img_url.split('/') [-1]) with open(filename, "wb") as f: f.write(img_response.content) count += 1 print(f"Downloaded {img_url} to {filename}") print(f"Downloaded {count } images to {directory}") ``` How to use: Run the following command in the terminal: ``` python download_images.py <url> <directory> <limit> ``` where `<url>` is to download The URL address of the image website, `<directory>` is the path to the folder where the downloaded images will be saved, and `<limit>` is the limit on the number of images to be downloaded. Note: This script only supports downloading image links obtained from img tags. For other image links, you need to add corresponding parsing codes in the script.
