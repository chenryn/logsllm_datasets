User:  Explain what RAID is, and how are the different RAID levels different?
Assistant: RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) is a technology that uses multiple hard disks to improve data read and write speed and fault tolerance by distributing and copying data among multiple hard disks. Different RAID levels have different characteristics and uses: 1. RAID 0: Data is stored scattered on multiple hard disks, which can improve read and write speeds, but does not have fault tolerance, and any hard disk failure will result in data loss. 2. RAID 1: Through mirror backup, the exact same data is stored on two hard disks, which can provide redundant backup of data. When one hard disk fails, the other hard disk can continue to work. But capacity utilization is only 50%. 3. RAID 5: Distribute data and parity on multiple hard disks, which can provide high read and write speed and fault tolerance performance. When a hard disk fails, the system can recover data through parity. But it needs at least three hard drives to achieve. 4. RAID 6: Similar to RAID 5, but using two parity checks, it can tolerate the failure of two hard disks at the same time, providing higher data security. But at least four hard drives are required. 5. RAID 10: Combining RAID 1 and RAID 0, it can provide high read and write speed and fault tolerance performance by dispersely storing data on multiple hard disks and performing mirror backup. But at least four hard drives are required.
