User: I wonder if is possible to create a bash replacement but in python. I have done REPLs before, know about subprocess and that kind of stuff, but wonder how use my python-like-bash replacement in the OSX terminal as if were a native shell environment (with limitations). 
Or simply run ipython as is... 
P.D. The majority of the google answer are related to create shell scripts. I'm interested in create a shell..
Assistant: Yes, of course. You can simply make an executable Python script, call it /usr/bin/pysh, add this filename to /etc/shells and then set it as your user's default login shell with chsh.
