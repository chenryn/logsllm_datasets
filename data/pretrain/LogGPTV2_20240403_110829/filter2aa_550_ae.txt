Countries robust in international network infrastructure, such as Canada and Tai-
wan, will always appear in network traffic. Connections to or from more isolated 
countries, especially when no logical business relationship can be identified, require 
close scrutiny.

Unfortunately for the analyst, most computer network logs contain many potential 
threats to investigate.
The IP addresses listed in a log file are not always the true source of network traf-
fic. Obtaining reliable “attribution” is one of the most frustrating aspects of cyber 
attacks, as hackers often forge or “spoof” the IP address of an unwitting, third party 
network. This is possible because Internet routers, for the sake of efficiency, nor-
mally only use a data packet’s destination address to forward it across the Internet 
and disregard the source address.
How to improve attribution is one of the hottest topics in cyber defense research. At 
a minimum, security analysts must use a combination of technical databases such 
as WHOIS,95 non-technical Web tools such as a good Internet search engine, and 
common sense, which helps to verify whether the discovered network traffic cor-
responds logically to real life activity.

WHOIS can tell you the owner of an Internet Protocol (IP) address.

Cyber Security: A Technical Primer
Firewalls are designed to block many types of suspicious traffic automatically, and 
often they will prohibit everything that a user does not specifically allow. For ex-
ample, there are over 65,000 computer “ports,” or points of entry, into an operating 
system. By default, my firewall blocked access to the following notorious ports that 
are associated with “trojans,” or hacker programs that allow illicit remote access to 
a victim computer.

Blocking known malicious traffic seems easy enough, but hackers are adept at sub-
verting whatever connections are allowed onto your computer. For example, the 
Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), commonly used for network manage-
ment, is fairly simple in design and would seem amenable to security observation. 
However, hackers routinely use it for target reconnaissance, Denial of Service (DoS) 
attacks, and even as a covert channel for communications.
Analyzing outbound traffic is just as important as inbound traffic, if not more so. 
To begin, a security analyst should sort outbound firewall log data by the names 
of the programs installed on the computer. He or she should verify that legitimate 
programs are only contacting legitimate IP addresses, e.g., Microsoft Word should 
only contact Microsoft.
All unrecognizable programs should be examined closely. Often, quick Internet 
searches will suffice. However, if there is no proper (and reassuring) description for 
it on the Web, the program should be disallowed from contacting the Internet, if not 
uninstalled from the computer altogether.
My firewall log showed that one unidentifiable program, ISA v 1.0, had tried to con-
tact a remote computer in both China and France. I could not find any information 
about the program on the Web, so deleted it from the system.

Another program, WINSIP32.EXE, had tried three times to connect to a U.S. govern-
ment agency, the General Services Administration (GSA).96 A further red flag was 
that the name of the program was suspiciously close to WINZIP, a common program 
used to minimize file size for transmission via the Internet. I tried unsuccessfully to 
discuss the issue with a GSA system administrator, who almost certainly managed 
a hacked network.

The level of technical expertise and experience required to thoroughly evaluate 
computer network security is high. An analyst must understand hardware and soft-
ware, as well as Internet protocols, standards, and services. Security is an art as well 
as a science that involves common sense, original research, risk management, and 
a willingness to pick up the phone and speak with unknown system administrators.
In fact, the problem of attribution is the most complicating factor in cyber threat 
analysis. If the attacker is careless and leaves a large digital footprint (e.g., his home 
IP address), law enforcement may be able to take quick action. If the cyber attacker 
is smart and covers his digital tracks, then deterrence, evidence collection, and pros-
ecution become major challenges.
In almost all cases, computer log files alone do not suffice. Unmasking a cyber at-
tacker requires the fusion of cyber and non-cyber data points. Investigators must 
enter the real world if they want to arrest a computer hacker. There will always be 
clues. If the goal is extortion, where is the money to be paid, and is there a point-
of-contact? If the threat is Denial of Service, the target could ask for a proof of ca-
pability. The point is to generate a level of interactivity with the cyber threat actor 
that might be used against it. Further, cross-checking suspect information against 
trusted sources is always one of the best defenses.
In this chapter, the author has tried to make clear that catching a computer hacker is 
not a simple chore. Cyber attackers are often able to hide in network traffic and remain 
anonymous to their victims. Still, this does not mean that cyber attacks can easily 
rise to the level of a strategic threat; but it does mean that, when they do, national se-
curity leaders can be in the awkward position of not knowing who is attacking them. 
This is the topic of the next chapter.

Cyber Security: A Technical Primer
Macro-Scale Hacking
If one successfully attacked computer can pose a security threat, what if an adver-
sary could secretly command thousands or even millions of computers at once? At 
what point does a tactical cyber attack become a strategic cyber attack?
In fact, these are no longer academic questions. The Conficker worm is now esti-
mated to have compromised at least seven million computers worldwide,97 leaving 
an unknown cyber attacker, in theory, in control of their aggregated computer pro-
cessing power.
“Botnets” are networks of hacker-controlled computers that are organized within a 
common Command and Control (C2) infrastructure.98 Hackers often use botnets to 
send spam, spread malicious code, steal data, and conduct Denial of Service (DoS) 
attacks against other computers and networks around the world.
In the future, botnets may be used to conduct more complex and far-reaching at-
tacks, some of which could have national security ramifications. One scenario, dem-
onstrated in 2009 by the author and Roelof Temmingh,99 envisioned a “semantic 
botnet,” composed of a virtual army of randomly-generated and/or stolen human 
identities,100 which could be used to support any personal, political, military, or ter-
rorist agenda.101
Such a cyber attack is possible because humans now communicate via ubiquitous 
software that is by nature impersonal and non-interactive. A botnet made up of 
thousands or millions of computers could be used to post a wide range of informa-
tion, opinions, arguments, or threats across the Internet. These could target a per-
son, an organization, or a nation-state and promote any political or criminal cause. 
The amplification power of the Internet guarantees that not every victim must fall 
for the scam; a certain percentage will suffice.
Most of the information found on the Internet is open to theft and/or abuse. Hack-
ers can steal any type of file, text, or graphics and alter it for nefarious purposes. 
Although effective authentication technologies such as digital signatures exist, they 
are rarely used for common communications.

BIRTH OF A CONCEPT: STRATEGIC CYBER SECURITY
The calculated, political manipulation of information, which is today most often 
found in the form of computer data, is not uncommon. In 2006, Reuters news ser-
vice, prior to publishing a photo, darkened the sky over Beirut to make an Israeli air 
raid appear more dramatic;102 in 2008, newspapers published a photo of an Iranian 
missile test in which an extra missile had been added;103 and in 2010, Al-Ahram 
newspaper in Cairo printed a photo after it had switched the places of Presidents 
Obama and Mubarak at the White House.104 Without some kind of technical means 
of verification, it can be difficult even for writers and photographers to know that 
their own work has not been modified.
Distinguishing fact from fiction – and humans from robots – is difficult online, espe-
cially in a timely and accurate way. Hackers will exploit the maze-like architecture 
of the Internet, and the anonymity it offers, to make threat evaluation slow and 
labor-intensive. In short, there is no quick way to determine whether a virtual person 
really exists. Over time, a fraudulent virtual identity would even come to have a “life” 
of its own as it posts a variety of information to the Web.
Historically, computers have had great difficulty impersonating a human being. In 
1950, Alan Turing wrote that even the “dullest” human could outperform a com-
puter in a conversation with another human, and that a machine could not provide 
a “meaningful answer” to a truly wide variety of questions. The celebrated Turing 
Test was born.105
However, Internet communications are increasingly impersonal conversations. This 
creates an attack space for a hacker because there is normally insufficient content 
and interactivity to evaluate whether a particular message was posted by a human 
or a machine.
The average computer programmer could never pass the Turing Test, but he or she 
could write a program to update the world via Twitter on how a fraudulent Web user 
is spending her day, or what she thinks about a political leader.
Every day, email is losing ground to new media such as YouTube, Facebook, and 
Twitter. Although the opportunity to cross-examine someone by email is limited, 
it does exist; email is typically interactive, one-to-one correspondence.106 The new 
communication models are not one-to-one, but one-to-many or many-to-one. Users 
feel empowered as they quickly become a prolific producer of digital information;

106 Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is also interactive, but it was never a mainstream form of communication.

Cyber Security: A Technical Primer
however, much of the output is trivial, and there is a loss of intimacy and interactiv-
ity. This benefits a cyber attacker, who can push information to the Web that would 
not be subject to serious cross-examination.
Due to the speed of modern communications, humans do not have much time to 
analyze what they read on the Web. Was a message posted by a human or a ma-
chine? It will be hard to know when even highly idiomatic language can be stolen 
and repackaged by a hacker. And Natural Language Processing, or the computer 
analysis of human languages, is still unproven technology that requires significant 
human oversight to be effective.107
It is increasingly difficult to separate cyberspace from what we think of as the real 
world; human beings respond to stimuli from both. If a botnet were used to promote 
a political or military goal, once a certain momentum toward the desired goal were 
attained – that is, if real people began to follow the robots – the attacker could then 
begin to scale back the Artificial Intelligence (AI) and reprogram the botnet for its 
next assignment.
It may not matter if the botnet campaign could eventually be discovered and dis-
credited. In time-sensitive contexts such as an election it might be too late. The at-
tacker may desire to sway public opinion only for a short period of time. In the week 
before an election, what if both left and right-wing blogs were seeded with false but 
credible information about one of the candidates? It could tip the balance in a close 
race to determine the winner. Consider the enormous impact of the 2004 Madrid 
train bombings on Spain’s national elections, which took place three days later.108
Roelof Temmingh, who is a brilliant programmer, wrote a complex, copy-and-paste 
algorithm to collect biographical information and facial images from various web-
sites and used them to construct skeletons of randomized, artificial personalities. 
Personal profiles, including categories such “favorite movie,” were added based on 
details from popular news sites. In future versions of the software, these fraudulent 
identities would begin to interact with the Web. This is the most difficult step, but far 
from impossible to implement. Over time, each new identity would assume a virtual 
“life” of its own.
Phishing attacks are successful even though they normally employ only one layer of 
deceit – the website itself. Intelligent attackers can weave a much more intricate web 
of deception than that; an entire organization could successfully be faked if the time 
were taken to invest in enough third-party references.

BIRTH OF A CONCEPT: STRATEGIC CYBER SECURITY
One of the primary reasons that such a cyber attack could succeed is the growing 
power of Web-enabled Open Source Intelligence (OSINT). The average Web user to-
day has access to a staggering amount of information. Beginning with only a name, 
a good OSINT researcher can quickly obtain date-of-birth, address, education, medi-
cal records, and much more. Via social networking sites, the attacker may even dis-
cover intimate details of a person’s life, including where he or she might physically 
be at any given moment. Eventually, a web of connections to other people, places, 
and things can be constructed.
Computer hackers are not only able to conduct OSINT via the Web, but also exploit 
the technical vulnerabilities of the Web to target their victims. Hackers “enumerate,” 
or conduct in-depth technical reconnaissance, against cyber targets, for information 
such as an IP address, a timestamp, or other “metadata” that can be exploited in the
