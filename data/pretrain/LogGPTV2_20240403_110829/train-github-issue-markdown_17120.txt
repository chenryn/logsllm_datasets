Please add support for searching and opening .msc files like `gpedit.msc`.  
I want to open the gpedit.msc by typing `gpedit.msc` or `Group Policy Editor`.
**crutkas note:**  
This would add in items like device manager and other MMC items
### Additional hint
In start menu this command is marked as type "control panel" (de:
"Systemsteuerung").
