| 0 | (P) Preparation | (I) Identiﬁcation | (C) Containment           |  |  |
| 1 | 1.
Patch asset vulnerabilities
2.
Perform routine inspections of controls/weapons
3.
Maintain Antivirus/EDR application updates
4.
Create network segmentation
5.
Log traﬃc between network segments
6.
Incorporate threat intelligence
7.
Perform routine inspections of asset backups
8.
Conduct user security awareness training
9.
Conduct response training (this PBC)
10. Use network appliances to ﬁlter ingress or egress traﬃc and perform
protocol-based ﬁltering. Conﬁgure software on endpoints to ﬁlter network traﬃc [2]
11.
Network intrusion detection and prevention systems that use network signatures to
identify traﬃc for speciﬁc adversary malware can be used to mitigate activity at the
network level
[3]                 | 1.
Monitor for:
a.
newly constructed network connections that are sent or received by
untrusted hosts [4]
b.
network data exhibiting uncommon data ﬂows. Processes utilizing the
network that do not normally have network communication or have
never been seen before are suspicious [4]
2.
Investigate and clear ALL alerts associated with the impacted assets or accounts
3.
Routinely check ﬁrewall,
IDS,
IPS, and SIEM logs for any unusual activity
4.
Monitor and analyze traﬃc patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s)
that do not follow the expected protocol standards and traﬃc ﬂows [4]                   | 1.
Inventory (enumerate & assess)
2.
Detect | Deny | Disrupt | Degrade | Deceive | Destroy
3.
Observe -> Orient -> Decide -> Act
4.
Issue perimeter enforcement for known threat actor locations
5.
Archive scanning related artifacts such as IP addresses, user agents, and requests
6.
Determine the source and pathway of the attack
7.
Fortify non-impacted critical assets                           |  |  |
| 2 | (E) Eradication | (R) Recovery      | (L) Lessons/Opportunities |  |  |
| 3 | 1.
Close the attack vector by applying the Preparation steps listed above
2.
Perform endpoint/AV scans on targeted systems
3.
Reset any compromised passwords
4.
Inspect ALL assets and user activity for IOC consistent with the attack proﬁle
5.
Inspect backups for IOC consistent with the attack proﬁle PRIOR to system recovery
6.
Patch asset vulnerabilities                 | 1.
Restore to the RPO (Recovery Point Objective) within the RTO (Recovery Time
Objective)
2.
Address any collateral damage by assessing exposed technologies
3.
Resolve any related security incidents
4.
Restore aﬀected systems to their last clean backup                   | 1.
Perform routine cyber hygiene due diligence
2.
Engage external cybersecurity-as-a-service providers and response professionals
3.
Implement policy changes to reduce future risk
4.
Utilize newly obtained threat signatures
5.
Remember that data and events should not be viewed in isolation but as part of a
chain of behavior that could lead to other activities                           |  |  |
