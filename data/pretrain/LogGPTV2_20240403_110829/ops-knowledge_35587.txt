User: I would like to create an subprocess.Popen object from an already running process... Is that possible somehow?
Another idea would be to serialize (pickle) the subprocess object and write it to a database so that if the main process restarts it could get the subprocess.Popen objects back from the database. I'm unsure if that works.

Do you mean from an already running sub-process? The only way I know of to pass objects between processes is to pickle them and write them out either to a file or a database as you suggested.
Typically, sub-processes cannot be spawned from already running sub-processes, but you can keep a reference to the new process you want to create and spawn it from the main process. This could get really ugly, and I suggest against it strongly. Why, specifically do you need to further your process tree past two-deep? This info might lead to a better answer.
