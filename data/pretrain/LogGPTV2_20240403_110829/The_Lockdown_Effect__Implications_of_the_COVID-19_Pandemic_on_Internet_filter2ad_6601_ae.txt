advances in network automation and deployment, e.g., automated
configuration management and robots installing cross connects at
IXPs without human involvement, it was possible to cope with the
increased demand. For example, DE-CIX Dubai managed to quickly
enable new ports within a week for Microsoft which was selected
as the country’s remote teaching solution for high schools [21]. In
summary, our study demonstrates that over-provisioning, network
management, and automation are key to provide resilient networks
that can sustain drastic and unexpected shifts in demand such as
those experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Taming the traffic increase. In this paper, we report an increase
in traffic in the order of 15-20% within days after the lockdown
began. This is in line with reports of ISPs and CDNs [18, 36, 42, 43]
as well as IXPs [56]. Typically, ISPs and CDNs are prepared for a
traffic increase of 30% in a single year period [7, 14, 39]. While these
are yearly plannings, the pandemic created substantial shifts within
only a few days. As a result, ISPs either needed to benefit from
over-provisioned capacity—e.g., to handle unexpected traffic spikes
such as attacks or flash-crowd events—or add capacity very quickly.
We observed port capacity increases in the order of 1,500 Gbps (3%)
across many IXP members at the IXP-CE alone (see Section 3.1).
Beyond our datasets, some networks publicly reported that traffic
shifts due to the pandemic resulted in partial connectivity issues
and required new interconnections [22, 57]. When we turn our
attention to traffic peaks, we notice that the increase is even smaller.
Traffic engineering focuses on peak traffic increase as this requires
more network resources. The effect of the pandemic fills the valleys
during the working hours and has a moderate increase in the peak
traffic, which can be handled by well-provisioned networks that
are prepared for sudden surges of peak traffic by 30% or more,
due to attacks, flash-crowds, and link failures that shift traffic to
other links. One concern that network operators raised in March
brought awareness to network instabilities that might occur due to
traffic shifts [61]. While on the one hand we find no evidence that
the traffic shifts due to the pandemic impact network operation of
our vantage points, individual links experience drastic increases
in traffic—way beyond the overall 15-20%. Such increases arise
unexpectedly to some network operators and may create a need
for port upgrades. On the other hand, the vantage points in this
paper range from extremely large to moderate sizes with sufficient
resources and a lot of experience in network provisioning and
resilience. In general, smaller networks with limited resources may
not be able to plan with sufficient spare capacities and fast enough
reaction times to compensate for such sudden changes in demand.
Substantial shift in traffic pattern. From a network operator
perspective, coping with the pandemic has required some port ca-
pacity upgrades but otherwise does not appear to impact operation.
The ability of network operators to quickly add capacity when
needed highlights that the Internet infrastructure works well at
large, despite some challenges to access data centers imposed by the
lockdown. From the perspective of the traffic mix, the pandemic,
however, results in substantial changes in traffic, ranging from
shifted diurnal pattern to traffic composition. This represents a re-
markable shift in Internet traffic that is, based on our observations,
handled surprisingly well by the Internet core at large supposedly
because many operators are prepared and can react quickly to new
demands. While the pandemic represents a rather extreme and ex-
ceptional case, one may argue that with the growing intertwining
of the Internet and our modern society such events can occur more
often. In any case, the COVID-19 pandemic highlights that user
behavior can change quickly and network operators need to be
prepared for sudden demand changes.
10 CONCLUSION
The COVID-19 pandemic is a—hopefully once in a lifetime—event
that drastically changed working and social habits for billions of
people. Yet, life continued thanks to the increased digitization and
resilience of our societies, with the Internet playing a critical sup-
port role for businesses, education, entertainment, and social inter-
actions. In this paper, we analyzed network flow data from multiple
vantage points, including a large academic network and a large ISP
at the edge, and, at the core, three IXPs located in Europe and the
US. Together, they allow us to gain a good understanding of the
lockdown effect on Internet traffic in more developed countries.
Our study reveals the importance of using different lenses to
fully understand the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact at the traffic
level: Mornings and late evening hours see more traffic. Workday
traffic patterns are rapidly changing and the relative difference to
weekend patterns is disappearing. Applications for remote working
and education, including VPN and video conferencing, see traffic
increases beyond 200%. For other parts of the Internet, such as edu-
cational networks serving university campuses, we find decreasing
traffic demands due to the absence of users but a drastic increase
in certain applications enabling remote working and lecturing. For
some networks, we observe that traffic ratios—including sources
and destinations—, are radically different from a pre-COVID-19
pandemic scenario. These observations highlight the importance
of approaching traffic engineering with a focus that looks beyond
hypergiant traffic and popular traffic classes to consider “essential”
applications for remote working.
With the evidence provided in this paper, we conclude that the
Internet—from the perspective of our vantage points—did its job
and coped well with unseen and rapid traffic shifts. Related work,
however, reported performance degradation in less developed re-
gions [3]. The unseen traffic shifts we observe due to the imple-
mentation of confinement measures underline the importance of
the Internet’s distributed nature to react amicably to such events
and enhance society’s resilience.
