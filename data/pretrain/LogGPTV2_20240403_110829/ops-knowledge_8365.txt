User: I installed Python a while ago from the official python-2.5.4.msi, but I can't remember what else I might have done. On my disk, I have C:\Program Files\Python 2.5.4 and I also have C:\Python25.  These directory contents look almost identical.  The Program Files folder contains about 39 MB, the Python25 folder contains about 25 MB.  Where did these come from?
In my start menu I have a Python 2.5 folder with a IDLE (Python GUI) shortcut and a few other things.
These two disk locations are really confusing me. I'm trying to install modules and it's getting messed up.  When I ran ez_setup.py to install easy_install, it went into the Python25 directory, but Python seems to be searching for modules in the Program Files location. Or some awful mess like that. What did I do wrong?
Assistant: Do you have any other application using Python?
It's also possible that applications install python for themself.
An example could be a game, which uses Python for the AI.
As far as i know, Panda3d installs its "own" Python...
