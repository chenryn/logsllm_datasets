### Bug summary
When using symlog scale for an axis, a false warning is initially generated -
independant of the data to plot - as soon as the mouse is moved over the axes.
### Code for reproduction
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    ax = plt.figure().add_subplot()
    ax.set_yscale('symlog')
    plt.show()
### Actual outcome
UserWarning: All values for SymLogScale are below linthresh, making it
effectively linear. You likely should lower the value of linthresh.
### Expected outcome
"Nothing"
