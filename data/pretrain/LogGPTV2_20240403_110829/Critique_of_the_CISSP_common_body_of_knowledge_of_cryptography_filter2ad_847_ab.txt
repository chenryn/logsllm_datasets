If RC4 is used with a key length of at least 128
bits, there are currently no practical ways to at-
tack it; the published successful attacks against
the use of RC4 in WEP applications are related
to problems with the implementation of the al-
gorithm, not the algorithm itself.
To cite just one example of many, the Fluhrer-Mantin-Shamir
attack [3] is now 12 years old, and while it also attacked
WEP, it identiﬁed “a large number of weak keys”, that were
then used to “mount related key attacks with practical com-
plexities”. Since then, other attacks have come to light; thus
all use of RC4 is banned in the Microsoft Secure Software
Development Lifecycle [5] since at least 20075 because it is
too diﬃcult to use securely.
3. COMMUNITY REACTIONS
The CISSP certiﬁcation (as opposed to the CBK) has
been criticised from many angles for many years; it has even
spawned a humorous YouTube video in which a CISSP uses
his plastic CISSP card like a police badge and storms into
rooms shouting “everyone step away from the encryption
keys and put the server down!”6. We will not go into that
and focus on criticisms of the CBK.
At Def Con 20, Timmay gave a talk entitled “Why You
Should Not Get a CISSP” [6]. In this talk, the presenter ar-
gued that the CBK was not up-to-date, but didn’t comment
on the accuracy of its oﬃcial guide.
Factual criticism of the CBK is nonexistent; we couldn’t
even ﬁnd an independent review of the book, not even on
Rob Slade’s otherwise excellent “CISSP by domain” pages7.
4. CONCLUSIONS
It is very tempting to ignore these mistakes on the grounds
that they fall outside the area of specialisation of a typical
CCS attendee and are thus properly someone else’s problem.
But such complacency would be wrong.
First of all, formulations like “relevant security qualiﬁca-
tions (CISSP) are considered an advantage” are commonly

found in security job ads8910. While certainly not all CIS-
SPs believe in or endorse the mistakes that are found in the
CBK, some undoubtedly do, since that’s what they read in
the (ISC)2’s oﬃcial guide (a point to which we will return
later). And these people might get the jobs that you or
your graduates aren’t getting, simply because they have a
certiﬁcate that is based at least in part on dangerous errors.
How big is the problem? The (ISC)2 has grown to be
internationally recognized, as stated on their webpage:
We provide [. . . ] Gold Standard credentials to
professionals in more than 135 countries.
[. . . ]
And we’re proud of our membership—an elite
network of nearly 90,000 certiﬁed industry pro-
fessionals worldwide.
We couldn’t ﬁnd the exact reasons for this recognition, other
than historical: the U.S. DoD Directive 8570.1 of 2004 [2,
AP2.1.3] encouraged that DoD employees working in infor-
mation assurance should have certiﬁcations from bodies that
have been ANSI/ISO/IEC 17024 accredited. Also in 2004,
(ISC)2’s CISSP was one of the ﬁrst certiﬁcations to be thusly
accredited. However, this accreditation is just a standard of
managing personnel certiﬁcation programmes and gives no
indication about the quality of the technical content.
According to Robert Half’s 2012 Salary Guide11, security
professionals are in the top ﬁve most wanted professionals
in the US, and certiﬁcation is required for positions such as
Chief Security Oﬃcer or Information Systems Security Man-
ager. Given that it is used by the US Department of Labor
to forecast the job market12, certiﬁcation has a deﬁnite im-
pact on hiring of graduates.
Also, certiﬁcate holders earn more: the job search engine
SimplyHired notes that CISSP holders can earn between
$80000 and $87000 on average, while in related jobs the
average is only $7800013.
To see how many CISSP employees are there from an-
other angle, we used LinkedIn data from simple queries
when logged in. We queried for keywords (CISSP, and other
acronyms for security certiﬁcations), locations and names
of well known companies, and also tried to see how many
people had additional certiﬁcations; see Table 1. We found
that around 25,000 people had some certiﬁcations other than
CISSP. The numbers suggest that few professionals only
have a CISSP, and conﬁrm that public bodies tend to ask
for certiﬁcations more than other employees.
Informally however, we found lots of forum discussions on
the topic of security certiﬁcations. They are esentially split
in two categories: those discussions where someone who has
already gained a security certiﬁcation asks the world “what’s
the next certiﬁcation to beef up my CV?”, and the discus-
sions on the utility of CISSP-like credentials.
In this last
case, we found that professionals with system administra-
tion experience dismiss the relevance of screening just for

CISSP when hiring security staﬀ, for the reason that CISSP
training does not touch upon aspects such as operating sys-
tem security, or technical security details. We even found a
blog entry [1] where the CISSP-holding author explains that
CISSP has failed at both measuring technical competence,
as well as measuring the grasp of security principles. The
irony of this situation is in that people who do not believe
in the technical value of this certiﬁcation still take it, and
defend its code of ethics as its only advantage compared to
other security certiﬁcations. But the only real hurdle to get-
ting the CISSP is the test, and not adherence to the code of
ethics, which is ambiguous in any case [6].
Two editing cycles have gone by, allowing ample time to
check the material (or have it checked) and to react to re-
ports of inaccuracies. But this opportunity was passed up.
The material we have surveyed is not just any publica-
tion by the (ISC)2; it is their oﬃcial guide to the CISSP
CBK, and is thus endorsed by them. From this review of
the crypto chapter, it follows that the (ISC)2 endorses rub-
bish. We believe that the (ISC)2 should revise the entire
section thoroughly, and probably the rest of the CBK, while
they’re at it.
