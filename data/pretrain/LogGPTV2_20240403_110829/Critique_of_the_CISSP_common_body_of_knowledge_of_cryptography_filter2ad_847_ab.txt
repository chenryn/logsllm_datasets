### RC4 and Its Security Implications

When RC4 is used with a key length of at least 128 bits, there are currently no practical methods to attack it. The successful attacks on RC4 in WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) applications have primarily been due to implementation flaws rather than inherent weaknesses in the algorithm itself. For example, the Fluhrer-Mantin-Shamir (FMS) attack, which was published over a decade ago, identified a large number of weak keys that could be exploited to mount related-key attacks with practical complexities. Since then, additional vulnerabilities have been discovered, leading Microsoft to ban the use of RC4 in its Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SDL) as early as 2007, due to the difficulty of using it securely.

### Community Reactions to CISSP Certification

The Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) certification has faced criticism from various angles for many years. One humorous take on this criticism is a YouTube video where a CISSP holder uses his certification card like a police badge, storming into rooms and shouting, "Everyone step away from the encryption keys and put the server down!" However, we will focus on the criticisms of the Common Body of Knowledge (CBK) rather than the certification itself.

At Def Con 20, Timmay gave a talk titled "Why You Should Not Get a CISSP," arguing that the CBK is not up-to-date. Despite this, there is a lack of factual criticism of the CBK, and independent reviews of the official guide are scarce, even on Rob Slade's otherwise comprehensive "CISSP by domain" pages.

### Consequences of Ignoring These Issues

It is tempting to dismiss these issues as outside the expertise of typical cybersecurity professionals, but such complacency would be misguided. Job advertisements often list relevant security qualifications, such as CISSP, as an advantage. While not all CISSP holders endorse the errors found in the CBK, some do, as they rely on the (ISC)²'s official guide. This can result in less qualified individuals securing jobs over more technically competent candidates simply because they hold a certification based on flawed information.

The (ISC)² is internationally recognized, boasting nearly 90,000 certified professionals across more than 135 countries. This recognition is partly historical, as the U.S. Department of Defense Directive 8570.1 of 2004 encouraged DoD employees in information assurance roles to obtain certifications from ANSI/ISO/IEC 17024 accredited bodies. The CISSP was one of the first to achieve this accreditation, although it only ensures a standard for managing certification programs and does not guarantee the quality of the technical content.

According to Robert Half's 2012 Salary Guide, security professionals are among the top five most sought-after professionals in the U.S., and certification is often required for positions such as Chief Security Officer or Information Systems Security Manager. Additionally, CISSP holders tend to earn higher salaries, with SimplyHired reporting average earnings between $80,000 and $87,000, compared to $78,000 for similar roles without the certification.

LinkedIn data from simple queries shows that around 25,000 people hold other certifications in addition to CISSP. This suggests that few professionals have only a CISSP, and public bodies are more likely to require certifications than private companies.

Informal discussions on forums about security certifications often fall into two categories: those seeking advice on the next certification to enhance their CV and those debating the utility of CISSP-like credentials. Professionals with system administration experience often dismiss the relevance of CISSP for hiring security staff, as the training does not cover essential topics such as operating system security or technical security details. A blog post by a CISSP holder even argues that the certification fails to measure both technical competence and understanding of security principles. The irony is that many still pursue the CISSP, defending its code of ethics as its primary value, despite the ambiguity and the fact that passing the test is the main hurdle.

Two editing cycles have passed without addressing the inaccuracies in the material. Given that the (ISC)² endorses the official guide to the CISSP CBK, it is clear that they are endorsing flawed content. We recommend a thorough revision of the entire section, and possibly the rest of the CBK, to ensure the material is accurate and up-to-date.
