Hello
Periodically/frequently the PowerToy context menu periodically will not show
or open when I right click the icon from the notification area or attempt to
access it from search dialog. I must kill the process and restart in order to
get into settings when this happens.
# Environment
Windows 10 1909 April 2020 CU
    Windows build number: [run "ver" at a command prompt]
    PowerToys version: v0.17.0
    PowerToy module for which you are reporting the bug (if applicable): Main UI control
# Steps to reproduce
Not sure what causes this. At times, it does appear that PowerToys is hanging
and I see an hour glass but that does not happen everytime. I do notice that
that FZ zones are not work at a 100% when this occurs although it does seem to
eventually work. I suspect some sort of hang situation underneath the covers.
When FZ isn't working, I notice that the regular Windows Snap behavior will
start to get mixed into the select zone layout so when I start to switch
between zones the window will move between all regular windows snap and the
select zones.
# Expected behavior
I expect that when I want to access the "settings" from the context menu that
it always comes up.
# Actual behavior
