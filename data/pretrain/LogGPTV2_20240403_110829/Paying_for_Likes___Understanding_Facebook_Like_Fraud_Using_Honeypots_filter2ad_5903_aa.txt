ABSTRACT
Facebook pages offer an easy way to reach out to a very large audi-
ence as they can easily be promoted using Facebook’s advertising
platform. Recently, the number of likes of a Facebook page has
become a measure of its popularity and proﬁtability, and an under-
ground market of services boosting page likes, aka like farms, has
emerged. Some reports have suggested that like farms use a net-
work of proﬁles that also like other pages to elude fraud protection
algorithms, however, to the best of our knowledge, there has been
no systematic analysis of Facebook pages’ promotion methods.
This paper presents a comparative measurement study of page
likes garnered via Facebook ads and by a few like farms. We de-
ploy a set of honeypot pages, promote them using both methods,
and analyze garnered likes based on likers’ demographic, temporal,
and social characteristics. We highlight a few interesting ﬁndings,
including that some farms seem to be operated by bots and do not
really try to hide the nature of their operations, while others follow
a stealthier approach, mimicking regular users’ behavior.

INTRODUCTION
Online Social Networks (OSNs) such as Facebook have become
one of the primary outlets for businesses and enterprises to adver-
tise and communicate with their customers. Just in 2013, Face-
book’s net ad revenue amounted to $6.7B, i.e., 5.64% of the global
market [12]. One feature offered by Facebook is the concept of
pages, which business can create, e.g., to display information about
products and events. Users can like them to receive updates, post
messages, or connect with other customers. Page likes also become

part of the user’s proﬁle. The number of likes for a given page is
often considered a measure of its popularity: ChompOn estimates
the expected revenue from each like to be $8, while other estimates
range between $3.60, $136.38, and $214.81 [6].
To reach out to their potential audience, businesses can promote
their Facebook page using targeted ads, via page like ads. Based on
the advertiser’s preferences, ads can be targeted to users from a spe-
ciﬁc age or location group, or to users who have certain interests.
As per Facebook’s guidelines, this is the only legitimate way to col-
lect page likes [13]. However, a growing underground industry has
emerged that provides paid services, aka like farms, to inﬂate the
number of Facebook page likes. Some recent press articles [3, 7,
14, 18] have started to look into Facebook page promotion meth-
ods and speculated that like farms use fake proﬁles trying to imitate
real users’ behavior. As these likes – which we call fake likes – do
not correspond to a genuine interest in the advertised page, they
are less valuable to businesses in terms of potential customer en-
gagement and revenue. Other reports [19, 20, 22] have suggested
that promoting pages using legitimate Facebook ad campaigns may
also garner signiﬁcant amounts of fake likes. One possible explana-
tion is that fake proﬁles attempt to diversify their liking activities to
avoid Facebook’s fraud detection algorithms. To do so, they need
to click on ads and like pages other than those they are paid for.
However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no system-
atic analysis of Facebook pages’ promotion methods, even though
the understanding of fake likes is arguably crucial to improve algo-
rithms for fraud detection/mitigation in OSNs.
In this paper, we start addressing this gap with a comparative
measurement study of Facebook likes garnered by means of legiti-
mate Facebook page like ads and by using a few underground like
farms. We set up thirteen Facebook honeypot pages and promote
them using both methods. We monitor the likes garnered by these
pages, collect information about the likers (e.g., gender, age, loca-
tion, friend list, etc.), and perform a comparative analysis based on
demographic, temporal, and social characteristics of the likers.
Our study highlights a few interesting ﬁndings. When targeting
Facebook users worldwide, we obtain likes from only a few coun-
tries. Likers’ proﬁles also seem to be skewed toward male pro-
ﬁles. We found evidence that different like farms (with different
pricing schemes) garner likes from a similar set of users and may
be managed by the same operator. We also identiﬁed two main
modi operandi of the like farms. Our results suggest that a ﬁrst
set of farms is operated by bots and do not really try to hide the
nature of their operations, delivering likes in bursts and forming
disconnected social sub-graphs. Other farms follow a stealthier ap-
proach, mimicking regular users’ behavior, and rely on a large and
well-connected network structure to gradually deliver likes while
129keeping a small count of likes per user. The ﬁrst strategy reﬂects a
“quick and dirty” approach where likes from disposable fake users
(as also indicated by the number of terminated accounts) are deliv-
ered rapidly, as opposed to the second one, which exhibits a stealth-
ier approach that leverages the underlying social graph, where real
users (or well-masked fake users) trickle their likes.
We did not ﬁnd direct evidence that the likes garnered by the
Facebook campaigns also originate from like farms. However,
when comparing proﬁles attracted by the Facebook campaigns to
those associated with like farms, we did identify a noticeable over-
lap in the pages they liked overall. We also observed that likers
from Facebook campaigns liked a lot more pages than typical Face-
book users, and much closer to that observed for like farm users.
2. RELATED WORK
Prior work has studied and detected sybil and/or fake OSN ac-
counts by relying on tightly-knit community structures [5, 10, 28,
29, 30]. Findings revealed by our work also highlight several char-
acteristics about the social structure and activity of fake proﬁles
attracted by the honeypot pages, e.g., their interconnected nature
or the activity bursts. In fact, our analysis does not only conﬁrm a
few insights used by sybil detection algorithms but also reveals new
patterns that could complement them. A few passive measurement
studies have also focused on characterizing fake user accounts and
their activity. Nazir et al. [21] studied phantom proﬁles in Face-
book gaming applications, while Thomas et al. [25] analyzed over
1.1 million accounts suspended by Twitter. Gao et al. [15] stud-
ied spam campaigns on Facebook originating from approximately
57,000 user accounts. Yang et al. [27] performed an empirical anal-
ysis of social relationships between spam accounts on Twitter, and
Dave et al. [11] proposed a methodology to measure and ﬁnger-
print click-spam in ad networks. Our work differs from these stud-
ies as they all conduct passive measurements, whereas we rely on
the deployment of several honeypot pages and (paid) campaigns to
actively engage with fake proﬁles.
Stringhini et al. [23] and Lee et al. [17] created honeypot pro-
ﬁles in Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter to detect spammers. Their
work differs from ours in that (1) their honeypot proﬁles were de-
signed to look legitimate, while our honeypot pages explicitly in-
dicated they were not “real” (to deﬂect real proﬁles), and (2) our
honeypot pages actively attracted fake proﬁles by means of paid
campaigns, as opposed to passive honeypot proﬁles. Also, Thomas
et al. [26] analyzed trafﬁcking of fake accounts in Twitter. They
bought fake proﬁles from 27 merchants and developed a classi-
ﬁer to detect these fake accounts. In a similar study, Stringhini et
al. [24] analyzed the market of Twitter followers, which, akin to
Facebook like farms, provide Twitter followers for sale. Note that
Twitter follower markets differ from Facebook like farms as Twitter
entails a follower-followee relationship among users, while Face-
book friendships imply a bidirectional relationships. Also, there is
no equivalent of liking a Facebook page in the Twitter ecosystem.
Beutel et al. [4] proposed a technique to detect fake likes based
on identifying groups of users who liked a set of pages within
a given time period. However, their technique does not rely on
ground truth data, so it is unclear whether or not the detection
mechanism blocks all fake likes, or actually only those exhibiting
a certain pattern. By contrast, we focus on actively measuring like
fraud activities by means of honeypots, i.e., attracting fake likes to
empty pages, through payment. We elicit and study ground truth
data, and highlight how some like farms actually try to emulate be-
havior of regular users and thereby stay below the detection radar.
Nonetheless, our work serves as the starting point for improved
fake like detection and can complement techniques from [4].
Finally, a few investigative press reports [3, 7, 14, 20] have also
looked into Facebook page ads and underground like farms, how-
ever, without any systematic analysis of Facebook pages’ promo-
tion methods.
3. METHODOLOGY
This section presents the methodology used to deploy and moni-
tor Facebook honeypot pages and to promote them using both Face-
book page like ads and like farms.
Honeypot Pages. We created 13 Facebook pages called “Virtual
Electricity” and intentionally kept them empty (i.e., no posts or
pictures). Their description included: “This is not a real page,
so please do not like it.” 5 pages were promoted using legitimate
Facebook (FB) ad campaigns targeting users, respectively, in USA,
France, India, Egypt, and worldwide. The remaining 8 pages were
promoted using 4 popular like farms BoostLikes.com (BL), Social-
Formula.com (SF), AuthenticLikes.com (AL), and MammothSo-
cials.com (MS), targeting worldwide or USA users.
In Table 1, we provide details of the honeypot pages, along with
the corresponding ad campaigns. All campaigns were launched on
March 12, 2014, using a different administrator account (owner) for
each page. Each Facebook campaign was budgeted at a maximum
of $6/day to a total of $90 for 15 days. The price for buying likes
varied across likes farms: BoostLikes charged the highest price for
“100% real likes” ($70 and $190 for 1000 likes in 15 days from,
respectively, worldwide and USA). Other like farms also claimed
to deliver likes from “genuine”, “real”, and “active” proﬁles, but
promised to deliver them in fewer days. Overall, the price of 1000
likes varied between $14.99–$70 for worldwide users and $59.95–
$190 for USA users.
Data Collection. We monitored the “liking” activity on the honey-
pot pages by crawling them, using Selenium web driver [2], every
2 hours to check for new likes. At the end of the campaigns, we
reduced the monitoring frequency to once a day, and stopped mon-
itoring when a page did not receive a like for more than a week. We
used Facebook’s reports tool for page administrators, which pro-
vides a variety of aggregated statistics about attributes and proﬁles
of page likers. Facebook also provides these statistics for the global
Facebook population. Since a majority of Facebook users do not set
the visibility of their age and location to public [8], we used these
reports to collect statistics about likers’ gender, age, country, home
and current town.1 Later, in Section 4, we will use these statistics
to compare distributions of our honeypot pages’ likers to that of the
overall Facebook population. We also crawled public information
from the likers’ proﬁles, obtaining the lists of liked pages as well
as friend lists, which are not provided in the reports. Overall, we
identiﬁed more than 6.3 millions total likes by users who liked our
honeypot pages and more than 1 million friendship relations.
We acknowledge that our limited budget allows us to only mon-
itor 13 honeypots for a few weeks. Note, however, that our work
is a ﬁrst-of-a-kind, exploratory study of like fraud practices – as it
will become clear in the rest of the paper, our methodology actually
allows us to derive several interest ﬁndings (which could be further
explored, in future work, with larger/more diverse campaigns).
Campaign Summary. In Table 1, we report the total number of
likes garnered by each campaign, along with the number of days
we monitored the honeypot pages. Note that the BL-ALL and MS-
ALL campaigns remained inactive, i.e., they did not result in any

provide aggregated statistics about users who clicked on page like
ads, e.g., current location is determined based on IP address.
