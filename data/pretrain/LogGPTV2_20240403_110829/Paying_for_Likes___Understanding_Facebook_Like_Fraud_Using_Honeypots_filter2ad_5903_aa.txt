## Abstract
Facebook pages offer a straightforward way to reach a large audience through the platform's advertising system. The number of likes on a Facebook page has become a key metric for its popularity and profitability, leading to the emergence of an underground market for services that artificially boost page likes, known as "like farms." Some reports suggest that these like farms use networks of profiles that also like other pages to evade fraud detection algorithms. However, to our knowledge, there has been no systematic analysis of the methods used to promote Facebook pages. This paper presents a comparative measurement study of page likes acquired through Facebook ads and from several like farms. We deployed a set of honeypot pages, promoted them using both methods, and analyzed the likes based on the demographic, temporal, and social characteristics of the likers. Our findings reveal that some like farms are operated by bots and do not attempt to hide their operations, while others adopt a more stealthy approach, mimicking regular user behavior.

## 1. Introduction
Online Social Networks (OSNs) such as Facebook have become primary platforms for businesses to advertise and communicate with customers. In 2013, Facebook's net ad revenue was $6.7 billion, representing 5.64% of the global market. One feature offered by Facebook is the creation of pages, which businesses can use to share information about products and events. Users can like these pages to receive updates, post messages, or connect with other customers. The number of likes for a page is often considered a measure of its popularity, with estimates suggesting that each like can generate between $3.60 and $214.81 in revenue.

To reach their target audience, businesses can promote their Facebook pages using targeted ads. According to Facebook's guidelines, this is the only legitimate way to collect page likes. However, an underground industry has emerged that provides paid services, known as like farms, to inflate the number of likes. Recent press articles have suggested that like farms use fake profiles to imitate real users' behavior. These fake likes, which do not represent genuine interest, are less valuable to businesses. Other reports indicate that even legitimate Facebook ad campaigns may attract significant numbers of fake likes, possibly because fake profiles diversify their activities to avoid detection.

In this paper, we address this gap with a comparative measurement study of Facebook likes garnered through legitimate Facebook page like ads and via several underground like farms. We set up thirteen Facebook honeypot pages and promoted them using both methods. We monitored the likes, collected information about the likers, and performed a comparative analysis based on demographic, temporal, and social characteristics.

Our study highlights several interesting findings. When targeting Facebook users worldwide, we received likes from only a few countries, and the likers' profiles were predominantly male. We found evidence that different like farms, with varying pricing schemes, garner likes from a similar set of users and may be managed by the same operator. We identified two main strategies used by like farms: one operated by bots, delivering likes in bursts and forming disconnected social sub-graphs, and another following a stealthier approach, mimicking regular users' behavior and relying on a well-connected network structure to gradually deliver likes.

We did not find direct evidence that the likes from Facebook campaigns originated from like farms. However, when comparing profiles attracted by the Facebook campaigns to those associated with like farms, we observed a noticeable overlap in the pages they liked. Additionally, likers from Facebook campaigns liked many more pages than typical Facebook users, similar to the behavior of like farm users.

## 2. Related Work
Previous studies have focused on detecting sybil and fake OSN accounts by analyzing community structures. Our work confirms some insights used by sybil detection algorithms and reveals new patterns. Several passive measurement studies have characterized fake user accounts and their activity, but our work differs as it relies on the deployment of honeypot pages and paid campaigns to actively engage with fake profiles.

Stringhini et al. and Lee et al. created honeypot profiles in Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter to detect spammers. Their work differs from ours in that their profiles were designed to look legitimate, while our honeypot pages explicitly indicated they were not real. Thomas et al. analyzed the trafficking of fake accounts in Twitter, and Stringhini et al. studied the market of Twitter followers, which is similar to Facebook like farms but operates differently due to the follower-followee relationship in Twitter.

Beutel et al. proposed a technique to detect fake likes based on identifying groups of users who liked a set of pages within a given time period. However, their technique does not rely on ground truth data. By contrast, we focus on actively measuring like fraud activities by attracting fake likes to empty pages through payment and studying ground truth data.

Finally, investigative press reports have looked into Facebook page ads and underground like farms, but without a systematic analysis of promotion methods.

## 3. Methodology
This section describes the methodology used to deploy and monitor Facebook honeypot pages and to promote them using both Facebook page like ads and like farms.

### Honeypot Pages
We created 13 Facebook pages called "Virtual Electricity" and kept them empty, with a description stating, "This is not a real page, so please do not like it." Five pages were promoted using legitimate Facebook ad campaigns targeting users in the USA, France, India, Egypt, and worldwide. The remaining eight pages were promoted using four popular like farms: BoostLikes.com, SocialFormula.com, AuthenticLikes.com, and MammothSocials.com, targeting worldwide or USA users.

### Data Collection
We monitored the liking activity on the honeypot pages by crawling them every 2 hours using Selenium web driver. At the end of the campaigns, we reduced the monitoring frequency to once a day and stopped when a page did not receive a like for more than a week. We used Facebook’s reports tool for page administrators to collect statistics about the attributes and profiles of page likers, including gender, age, country, home, and current town. We also crawled public information from the likers’ profiles, obtaining the lists of liked pages and friend lists. Overall, we identified more than 6.3 million total likes and over 1 million friendship relations.

### Campaign Summary
Table 1 summarizes the total number of likes garnered by each campaign and the number of days we monitored the honeypot pages. Note that the BL-ALL and MS-ALL campaigns remained inactive.

| Campaign ID | Location | Description | Provider |
|-------------|----------|-------------|----------|
| FB-USA      | USA      | Page like ads | Facebook.com |
| FB-FRA      | France   | Page like ads | Facebook.com |
| FB-IND      | India    | Page like ads | Facebook.com |
| FB-EGY      | Egypt    | Page like ads | Facebook.com |
| FB-ALL      | Worldwide | Page like ads | Facebook.com |
| BL-ALL      | Worldwide | 1000 likes | BoostLikes.com |
| BL-USA      | USA      | 1000 likes | BoostLikes.com |
| SF-ALL      | Worldwide | 1000 likes | SocialFormula.com |
| SF-USA      | USA      | 1000 likes | SocialFormula.com |
| AL-ALL      | Worldwide | 1000 likes | AuthenticLikes.com |
| AL-USA      | USA      | 1000 likes | AuthenticLikes.com |
| MS-ALL      | Worldwide | 1000 likes | MammothSocials.com |
| MS-USA      | USA      | 1000 likes | MammothSocials.com |

We acknowledge that our limited budget allowed us to monitor only 13 honeypots for a few weeks. However, our exploratory study provides valuable insights into like fraud practices, which can be further explored in future work with larger and more diverse campaigns.
