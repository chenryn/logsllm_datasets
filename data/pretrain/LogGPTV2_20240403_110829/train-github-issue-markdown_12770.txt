Currently, both `` and `small` are set to a `font-size` of 85% _fixed_.
The `@font-size-small` is _not_ used to set it.
See `~/less/variables.less` on L#50 for `@font-size-small`.
See `~/less/types.less` on L#80 for `small, .small` definitions.

Additional to that: `h1, h2, h3, .h1, .h2, .h3, h4, h5, h6, .h4, .h5, .h6` all
have a `.small, small` setting as well: Are you sure that `65%` and `75%` is
the correct assumption?
