Currently, both the `small` element and the `.small` class are set to a fixed `font-size` of 85%. The variable `@font-size-small` is not being used to define this size. You can find the definition of `@font-size-small` in `~/less/variables.less` on line 50. The definitions for `small` and `.small` can be found in `~/less/types.less` on line 80.

Additionally, the elements and classes `h1, h2, h3, .h1, .h2, .h3, h4, h5, h6, .h4, .h5, .h6` also have settings for `.small` and `small`. Please verify if the assumed font sizes of 65% and 75% for these elements and classes are correct.
