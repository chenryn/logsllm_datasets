Abstract 
Different  applications  require  different  levels  of 
fault tolerance. Therefore, it is important to create a 
flexible architecture that allows a customer to choose 
the  appropriate  amount  of  fault tolerance,  a concept 
we call “RAS by the yard.” In this paper we describe a 
next  generation  supercomputer  and 
the  design 
flexibility that allows us to offer a range of alternatives 
for  RAS  (reliability,  availability,  serviceability).  In 
particular we explain how checkpointing can provide 
an  availability  continuum.  Design  alternatives  that 
improve RAS may be expensive, so it is important to do 
cost/benefit  studies  of  the  alternatives.  For  a  fixed 
budget  and  specified  system  balance  ratios,  such  as 
Bytes/FLOPS,  we  analyze  the  system  performance 
impact of alternative RAS strategies. We show how to 
optimize  the  amount  of  RAS  purchased  by  using  a  
performability measure.

When  making  a  computer  system  purchase, 
customers  compare  system 
their 
requirements and budget. Features considered include 
functionality,  performance,  security,  and  reliability/ 
availability/serviceability 
system 
features,  such  as  functionality,  are  fairly  constant 
while others, such as performance, are highly scalable 
by simply purchasing more hardware. In most current 
systems,  RAS 
is  a  constant  feature  without  a 
significant expenditure such as buying backup systems 
and using clustering technology. The authors propose 
that  RAS  should  be  scalable  and  that  computer 
systems  should  have  the  architectural  flexibility  to 
permit the purchase of variable levels of RAS. We call 
this concept RAS “by the yard”.  
There are many types of systems that permit users 
to purchase additional RAS. RAID  or mirrored disks 
are  an  example  in  which  consumers  purchase  more 
reliable storage with built-in redundancy.   However, 
this  provides  only  two  levels  of  RAS  (the  system 
either  has  the  feature  or  it  does  not)  rather  than  a 
continuum. In this paper we describe a next generation

the  standard 
cost/benefit  analysis  in  which  the  cost  required  to 
purchase additional RAS is compared with the benefits 
from the RAS improvement. The second approach is to 
assume that the customer has a fixed budget and that 
purchasing  additional  RAS  means  that  the  customer 
will  purchase  less  performance  or  other  features.  We 
show how consumers can use this analysis to optimize

The  “grand  challenge”  problems, 
such  as 
simulating 
the  universe,  require  a 
supercomputer  an  order  of  magnitude  more  powerful 
than  the  current  supercomputers:  a  machine  that 
provides 
[1]. 
Supercomputer applications often run for long periods 
of time, so failures can cause lengthy recomputing of 
results  that  were  not  preserved  when  the  failure 
occurred.  However,  current  supercomputers  are  not 
focussed  on  high  availability  [2,  3],  making  them  a 
natural area in which to examine the RAS by the yard 
concept.  
performance 
A  system  architecture  is  defined  by  various 
balance  ratios,  e.g.,  the  amount  of  memory  and  I/O 
bandwidth  per  unit  of  compute  performance.  These 
system  balance  ratios  are  generally  derived  from 
application  performance  evaluations  and  can  be 
changed  to  accommodate  different  workloads.  An 
1 FLOPS is floating point operations per second, a measure of peak 
computer  performance.  Current  supercomputers  are  measured  in 
TeraFLOPS, where Tera is a billion or 1012. Peta is 1015, 3 orders of 
magnitude larger.

supercomputing  applications  is  shown  in  Table  1. 
Commercial  systems  would  have 
less  bisection 
bandwidth2,  probably  more  I/O  bandwidth,  and 
possibly  more  memory  or  disk  storage  depending  on 
the application. For example, data mining applications 
would require significantly more disk storage.  
System  balance  ratios  provide  a  way  to  make 
apples-to-apples  comparisons  of  system  design  and 
configuration  alternatives.  The  ratios  are  selected  to 
balance  the  amount  of  resources  required  to  support 
raw  compute  power  in  a  cost-effective  way.  For 
example,  if  an  application  cannot  fit  in  memory, 
continual reads from disk are necessary, which impacts 
performance.  If  memory  or  other  bandwidth  is  not 
sufficient,  the  processors  may  stall,  waiting  for  data. 
The ratios may represent a compromise among a set of 
applications,  and 
they  change,  one  or  more 
applications may be impacted. Thus, when comparing 
systems, it is important to keep these ratios constant.

The values in Table 1 drive system cost. Table 2 
shows example costs for those parameters (in percent 
to  avoid  confidentiality  concerns).  Processor  cost  is 
primarily driven by compute performance, which may 
be peak performance as shown in Table 1 or based on 
benchmarks. It is driven to a lesser degree by memory 
bandwidth  and 
interconnect  bandwidth.  Memory 
subsystem  cost  is  primarily  driven  by  memory  size

component in a system. It is driven to a lesser extent by 
memory  bandwidth,  unless  the  memory  size  must 
increase  to  accommodate  the  memory  bandwidth 
requirement.  System  interconnect  cost  is  driven  by 
bisection bandwidth. Storage and I/O subsystem cost is 
mainly driven by disk bandwidth because disk capacity 
has  grown  much  faster  than  disk  bandwidth  and 
because supercomputers generally have comparatively 
less  networking  connectivity 
than 
commercial systems.

3. Cost/Benefit Analysis 
The  cost  data  in  Table  2  can  be  combined  with 
system  RAS  calculations  to  perform  cost/benefit 
studies. Consider a peta-scale supercomputer with a 6 
hour mean-time-to-failure (MTTF) [2, 3]. Assuming a 
2  hour  mean-time-to-repair  (MTTR),  steady-state 
system  availability  =  MTTF/(MTTF+MTTR)  = 
6/(6+2)  = 75%.  A  job  that takes  several hours might 
never complete, which is why application availability 
and  checkpoints,  described  in  the  next  section,  are 
important.  In  this  example,  we  consider  just  simple 
system availability to illustrate the concepts. 
Our  experience  and  calculations  indicate  that  the 
memory subsystem is the main reliability inhibitor. A 
method for protecting against memory channel failures 
is  memory  RAID,  in  which  an  extra  (fifth)  memory 
channel  is  added  [4,5].  Assume  that  memory  RAID 
increases the system MTTF from 6 hours to 12 hours. 
System  availability  is  improved  from  75%  to  86% 
(12/12+2).  The  cost  of  memory  RAID  is  a  25% 
increase in the memory subsystem cost to pay for the 
fifth memory channel, which is a 7% increase in total 
system cost as shown in Column 4 of Table 3. In this 
example,  paying  an  additional  7%  for  the  system 
doubles the MTTF and increases system availability by 
11%,  which  seems  like  a  very  good  tradeoff.  If  the 
system MTTF only increased from 6 hours to 8 hours, 
system availability would only increase by 5%, and the

looking  at  application  availability,  operations  and 
administrative cost, user perception, and so forth. 
Many  customers  have  a  fixed  budget  and  could 
not  pay  for  additional  RAS  even  if  it  seems  very 
beneficial  as  in  the  previous  example.  For  those 
customers, it is possible to purchase the increased RAS 
by  purchasing  a  slightly  smaller  system.  Table  3 
contains  the  appropriate  calculations.  Since  the  fifth 
memory  channel  adds  7%  to  the  system  cost,  each 
subsystem cost is divided by 1.07 to get the rebalanced 
cost  shown 
in  column  5.  The  original  system 
parameters  are  also  divided  by  1.07  to  get  the  new 
system  parameters  shown  in  column  6.  The  new 
system parameters preserve the system balance ratios 
from  Table  1,  which  is  important  for  comparing 
system  alternatives  as  described  in  Section  2.  Also, 
since the new system has less processor hardware, the 
MTTF is 12.8 hours, 7% more than the 12 hour MTTF 
for  the  original  system  with  a  fifth memory  channel. 
Peak  system  performance  is  lower  in  the  rebalanced 
system,  but  the  increased  availability  more  than 
compensates as shown in Section 6. 
The  original  system  is  a  1  PetaFLOPS  system 
with a 6 hour MTTF and 75% system availability. The 
rebalanced system is a 0.93 PetaFLOPS system with a 
12.8 hour MTTF and 86.5% system availability. The 
customer  can  select  either  system  for  the  same  total 
procurement  cost.  As  shown  in  Section  5,  the  same 
type  of  analysis  can  also  provide  a  range  of  options 
rather than a binary choice.
