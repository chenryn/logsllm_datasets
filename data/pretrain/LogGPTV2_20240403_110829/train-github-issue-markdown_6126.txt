In the latest 2.5 development branch, as well as in v2.5.0-BETA1, it is no longer possible to serialize a `FormView` instance. Attempting to do so results in the following exception: 

```
Exception: Serialization of 'Closure' is not allowed
```

For more details, please refer to the Travis CI build: [Build #24253905](https://travis-ci.org/craue/TwigExtensionsBundle/builds/24253905).

This functionality is required for the code at the following location to work properly:

- [FormExtension.php, Line 73](https://github.com/craue/TwigExtensionsBundle/blob/dc4ffd5e5239c50c5d7b0fa7fe10fae40ebe653b/Twig/Extension/FormExtension.php#L73)

We need to address this issue to ensure that the `FormView` serialization works as expected.
