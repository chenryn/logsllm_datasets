With the latest 2.5 dev branch (but also with v2.5.0-BETA1), it's no longer
possible to serialize a FormView instance. When trying, `Exception:
Serialization of 'Closure' is not allowed` is thrown, see https://travis-
ci.org/craue/TwigExtensionsBundle/builds/24253905.
This would be needed for
https://github.com/craue/TwigExtensionsBundle/blob/dc4ffd5e5239c50c5d7b0fa7fe10fae40ebe653b/Twig/Extension/FormExtension.php#L73
to work.
