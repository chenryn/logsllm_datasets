majority (≈ 80%) of ASes are doomed, and only a tiny frac-
tion are protectable; the same holds when security is 2nd
(Figure 5). Therefore, in these models, S*BGP can do little
to blunt attacks on Tier 1 destinations.
How can it be that Tier 1s, the largest and best connected
(at least in terms of customer-provider edges) ASes in our
AS graph, are the most vulnerable to attacks? Ironically, it

is the Tier 1s’ very connectivity that harms their security.
Because the Tier 1s are so well-connected, they can charge
most of their neighbors for Internet service. As a result,
most ASes reach the Tier 1s via costly provider paths that
are the least preferred type of path according to the LP
step in our routing policy models. Meanwhile, it turns out
that when a Tier 1 destination is attacked, most source ASes
will learn a bogus path to the attacker that is not through
a provider, and is therefore preferred over the (possibly se-
cure) provider route to the T1 destination in the security 2nd
or 3rd models. In fact, this is exactly what lead to the pro-
tocol downgrade attack on the Tier 1 destination AS 3356
in Figure 2. We will later (Section 5.3.1) ﬁnd that this is a
serious hurdle to protecting Tier 1 destinations.
4.7 Which attackers cause the most damage?
Next, we break things down by the type of the attacker, to
get a sense of type of attackers that S*BGP is best equipped
to defend against.
Figure 6. We bucket our counts of doomed, protectable,
and immune ASes for the security 3rd model by the attacker
type in Table 1, for all |V |2 possible attacker-destination
pairs. As the degree of the attacker increases, it’s attack be-
comes more eﬀective; the number of immune ASes steadily
decreases, and the number of doomed ASes correspondingly
increases, as the the tier of the attacker grows from stub to
Tier 2. Meanwhile, the number of protectable ASes remains
roughly constant across tiers. The striking exception to this
trend is that the the Tier 1 attacker is signiﬁcantly less ef-
fective than even the lowest degree (stub) attackers. While
at this observation might seem unnatural at ﬁrst, there is a
perfectly reasonable explanation: when a Tier 1 attacks, its
bogus route will look like a provider route from the perspec-
tive of most other source ASes in the graph. Because the
LP step of our routing model depreferences provider routes
relative to peer and customer routes, the Tier 1 attacker’s
bogus route will be less attractive than any legitimate route
through a peer or provider, and as such most ASes will be
immune to the attack. The same observations hold when
security is 2nd.
Tier 1s can still be protected as sources. However,
before we completely give up on the Tier 1s obtaining any
beneﬁt from S*BGP, we reproduced Figures 4 - 5 but this
time, bucketing the results by the tier of source. (Figure
omitted.) We found that each source tier, including the Tier
1s, has roughly the same average number of doomed (25%),
immune (60%), and protectable (15%) ASes. It follows that,
while S*BGP cannot protect Tier 1 destinations from attack,
S*BGP still has the potential to prevent a Tier 1 sources
from choosing a bogus route.
Robustness of results. We repeated this analysis on
our IXP-augmented graph (Appendix J) and using diﬀerent
routing policies (Appendix K). Please see the appendices
for details.
5. DEPLOYMENT SCENARIOS
In Section 4.4 we presented upper bounds on the improve-
ments in security from S*BGP deployment for choice of se-
cure ASes S. We found that while only meagre improve-
ments over origin authentication are possible in the security
3rd model, better results are possible in the security 2nd and
1st models. However, achieving the bounds in Section 4.4
could require full S*BGP deployment at every AS. What
happens in more realistic deployment scenarios? First, we
ﬁnd that the security 2nd model often behaves disappoint-
ingly like the security 3rd model. We also ﬁnd that Tier 1
destinations remain most vulnerable to attacks when secu-
rity is 2nd or 3rd. We conclude the section by presenting
prescriptive guidelines for partial S*BGP deployment.
Robustness to missing IXP edges. We repeated the
analysis in Section 5.2-5.3 over the AS graph augmented
with IXP peering edges and saw almost identical trends. We
see a slightly higher baseline of happy ASes when S = ∅ (Sec-
tion 4.4), which almost always causes the improvement in
the metric (over the baseline scenario) to be slightly smaller
for this graph. (Plots in Appendix J.)
