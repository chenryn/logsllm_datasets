### Title: Site Isolation in Chrome: Confining Untrustworthy Code in the Web Browser

In the late 2000s, web browsers transitioned from single-process to multi-process architectures, introducing a sandbox boundary between untrustworthy web content and local resources. While this was effective at the time, the evolving security landscape now demands a more robust architecture.

In this presentation, we will discuss our deployment of the Site Isolation architecture to Chrome users. This advancement significantly enhances browser security by mitigating a wide range of attacks, including same-process Spectre exploits, Universal Cross-Site Scripting (UXSS), and arbitrary code execution within the renderer sandbox.

We will delve into the changes in the browser's architecture, the security benefits it provides, and the remaining limitations. Additionally, we will explain how we maintained compatibility and performance, enabling the successful rollout to all Chrome desktop users.

Finally, we will present examples of new types of Site Isolation bypass vulnerabilities that are eligible for rewards through Chrome's Vulnerability Rewards Program. We encourage security researchers to help us strengthen this defense mechanism.
