User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Is it possible to cache subversion? Is it possible to cache subversion at all? May be any commercial solution?

Any help would by highly appreciated.

Assistant: The context of your question is unclear, but I would suggest using git-svn instead of Subversion.  The git-svn bridge gives you an interface and user experience like Git, while retaining Subversion as the official repository.  Basically, you start by running git svn clone URL, which creates a local Git repository that contains the entire repository history, with some Subversion metadata so that you can resynchronize later.  The Subversion repository is treated by Git as a special kind of remote repository.  Git-svn has multiple advantages over the usual Subversion workflow:


Git is simply a more powerful tool than Subversion.
Operations that Subversion would normally query the server for, such as svn log, happen locally.  git log is much faster than svn log.  (If you want the output to look like svn log, then run git svn log instead.)
You have the option to make local Git branches, commit to them, rewrite history in them, etc., before pushing them into the remote Subversion repository.
Road warriors can work offline except when syncing.


The main caveats are:


Git is more difficult to learn than Subversion.
The multiple steps to commit (git commit -a followed by git svn dcommit) can be confusing to some users.
Some Subversion concepts are not well supported.  For example, Git does not handle keyword expansion well.
Subversion lets you check out portions of a repository, whereas Git operations always work on the entire repository.  If your Subversion repository has per-directory access control, then git-svn won't work well.
