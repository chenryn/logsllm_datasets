User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Are there security advantages gained from forcing a website to be available from just one tab at a time? I just found that a website of one Polish bank forces the users to open it in one browser tab only. You cannot for example check your transfer history while  looking for an account number that you want to send money to. I cannot think of any good reasons for doing this except possible security reasons. Are there security advantages to limiting a site to only one site? If so, what are they?

Assistant: Generally, no, it's not reasonable to force users to a single tab. There are no technical security reasons for making a website available to a single tab only. This is generally common just due to poor system design.

Forcing a single tab also means that when you log out, you won't leave your sensitive information plastered in twenty other tabs. This is poor reason though, as a site that is bothered about this can use localStorage or websocket to simultaneously clear all tabs when logging out from one tab.

The human factor of security is a marginal reason why some sites might deliberately restrict itself to a single tab. By forcing a single tab, you force people to focus on one thing at a time, and this makes you less likely to forget something. IMO, this is a poor reason, as the drawbacks outweighs the advantages.
