I seem to be getting setFunctionBreakpoints requests after the launch request
whereas setBreakpoints requests come in before the launch request. Should I be
using the configurationDone request or something here? BTW the extension is
configured to send the initialized event in the processing of the initialize
request but before the initialize response is sent. Could that be causing
this?
