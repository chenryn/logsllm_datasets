    [✗] iOS toolchain - develop for iOS devices
        ✗ Xcode installation is incomplete; a full installation is necessary for iOS development.
          Download at: https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download/
          Or install Xcode via the App Store.
          Once installed, run:
            sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
        ✗ libimobiledevice and ideviceinstaller are not installed. To install with Brew, run:
            brew update
            brew install --HEAD usbmuxd
            brew link usbmuxd
            brew install --HEAD libimobiledevice
            brew install ideviceinstaller
        ✗ ios-deploy not installed. To install with Brew:
            brew install ios-deploy
        ✗ CocoaPods not installed.
            CocoaPods is used to retrieve the iOS platform side's plugin code that responds to your plugin usage on the Dart side.
            Without resolving iOS dependencies with CocoaPods, plugins will not work on iOS.
            For more info, see https://flutter.io/platform-plugins
          To install:
            brew install cocoapods
