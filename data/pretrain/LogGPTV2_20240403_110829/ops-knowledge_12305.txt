User: I am absolute beginner using google app engine with python 2.7. I was successful with creating helloworld app, but then any changes I do to the original app doesn't show in localhost:8080. Is there a way to reset/refresh the localhost. I tried to create new projects/directories with different content but my localhost constantly shows the old "Hello world!" I get the following in the log window:

WARNING  2012-05-13 20:54:25,536 rdbms_mysqldb.py:74] The rdbms API is not available because the MySQLdb library could not be loaded.
