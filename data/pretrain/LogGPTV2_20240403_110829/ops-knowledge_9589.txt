User: Is there any way of attaching a console's STDIN/STDOUT to an already running process?
Use Case:
I have a python script which runs another python script on the command line using popen. 
Let's say foo.py runs popen to run python bar.py.
Then bar.py blocks on input. I can get the PID of python bar.py. Is there any way to attach a new console to the running python instance in order to be able to work interactively with it? This is specifically useful because I want to run pdb inside of bar.py.
Assistant: You cannot redirect stdin or stdout for a running process.  You can, however, add code to your caller -- foo.py -- that will read from foo.py's stdin and send it to bar.py's stdout, and vice-versa.
In this model, foo.py would connect bar.py's stdin and stdout to pipes and would be responsible for shuttling data between those pipes and the real stdin/stdout.
