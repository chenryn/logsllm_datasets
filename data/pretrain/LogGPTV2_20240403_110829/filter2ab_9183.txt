titleblackhat:us-21 Bam the BAM - Electromagnetic Fault Injection & Automotive Systems
This talk introduces an example of how electromagnetic fault injection (EMFI) can be used to bypass security used to prevent ECU modifications on a recent (tested on a 2019 model year) automotive ECU. This attack requires extensive physical access to the ECU, but does not require modifications to the ECU. It's sufficient to simply open the ECU to expose the main microcontroller, which allows the fault injection attack to succeed.This talk further shows how you can perform such validation yourself on other devices - using tools such as power analysis to determine if there are potentially vulnerable locations, and using fault injection to try and validate the vulnerabilities. This also allows you to experiment with ways of improving the resilience of a given device in case you are already using it somewhere critical - here an example will be given of several configurations which are more resilient to EMFI attacks.
