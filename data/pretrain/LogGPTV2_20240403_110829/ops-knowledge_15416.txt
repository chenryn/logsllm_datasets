User: I have been using NotePAD++ for editing Python scripts.
I recently downloaded the PyDEV IDE (for Eclipse).
The problem is that when I wrote the scripts in NotePad++ I used "TAB" for indentation, and now when I open them with PyDEV, every time I try to write a new line instead of "TABS" PyDEV inserts spaces. (even if I click the "TAB" key Eclipse inserts 4 spaces instead of one tab).
This raises indentation error.
Is there anyway to fix this thing?
Thanks!
Assistant: Putting aside the tabs vs spaces argument. 
To fix this you need to
chose 'toggle force tabs' in preferences for eclipse to use tabs instead of the default spaces.
