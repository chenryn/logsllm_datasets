I am part of a team that is preparing to launch the beta version of a web application, built using Python (specifically Django), along with an associated suite of backend tools. Our team has recently grown from two to four members and we anticipate further expansion in the coming months. As our team grows, one challenge we are facing is ensuring that all members have their development environments properly set up, including the installation of necessary packages.

To streamline this process and reduce potential errors, I am exploring different options. Both zc.buildout and virtualenv appear to be suitable tools for addressing these issues, but they primarily focus on Python-specific concerns. Our project also includes smaller sub-projects written in other languages such as Java and Ruby, alongside various Python extensions that require native compilation (e.g., lxml, MySQL drivers). One of the most significant challenges we've encountered is ensuring that these extensions are compiled against the correct versions of shared libraries, to avoid segmentation faults, memory allocation errors, and similar issues. This is compounded by the fact that our four team members use four distinct development environments: one Mac OS X Leopard on PowerPC, one Mac OS X Leopard on Intel, one Ubuntu, and one Windows.

An ideal solution would allow us to execute a command sequence like the following from the command line:
```
$ git clone [repository URL]
...
$ python setup-env.py
...
```
This script would perform the functions of zc.buildout or virtualenv (such as copying or symlinking the Python interpreter and providing a clean environment for installing packages) and would also handle the installation of all required Python packages, including any necessary native shared library dependencies. Additionally, it should be capable of setting up the Java and Ruby projects. Such a tool would not only facilitate the setup of development environments but also aid in the deployment to staging and production servers.

While I prefer a solution that can be implemented or extended using Python, given its status as our team's primary language, I am open to considering solutions in other languages.

Does anyone have suggestions for better alternatives or experiences to share regarding the use of these or similar solutions for managing more extensive or diverse installation requirements?

One approach I've found effective is to create a `develop.py` file at the root of the project. This file, along with a `packages` directory containing all the .tar.gz files from PyPI needed for the project, and an unpacked copy of virtualenv, is included in the version control system. By checking out the project and running `develop.py`, developers can quickly set up a virtual environment with all the necessary dependencies at the exact versions used by the rest of the team. This method also ensures that the setup process works even if PyPI is unavailable, which can be particularly useful given the occasional instability of the service.
