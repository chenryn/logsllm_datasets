User: I have a couple of smaller asset files (text templates typically 100 - a few K bytes) in my app that I'm considering caching using memcached. But does anyone here know if loading a local file or requesting it from memcache is the fastest/most resource efficient?
(I'll be using the Python version of App Engine)
Assistant: If they are just few kbytes I would load them on the instance memory; amongst the storage choices (Memcache, Datastore, Blobstore and so on) on Google App Engine , instance memory option shoud be the fastest.
