Just before the 3.1 release, having div class="visible-sm visible-xs" together
on a div would show the div when it hit both breakpoints. Now, it only works
on one breakpoint. They both work individually, but when there's more than one
declared on a div, only one class gets triggered. Does the same for hidden.
I checked the issues log and didn't notice this. Hopefully i am not the only
one finding this.
