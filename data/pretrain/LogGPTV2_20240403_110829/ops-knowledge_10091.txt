User: I know it is possible to create a process on a remote windows machine using the WMI module but I wish to know if the same can be said for ending a process. I havent been able to find a thread or any documentation for this so please if you can help me It would be greatly appreciated.
Assistant: I figured out the answer in case anybody else runs into a similar issue; You actually dont even need WMI and can be run directly from command prompt:
if you are in the same network you can issue a command via command prompt with the following format:
taskkill /s [Computer name or IP] /u [USER or DOMAIN\USER] /p Password /pid [The process to kill i.e. notepad.exe]
This will take a few moments but will eventuall kill the process that is running.
