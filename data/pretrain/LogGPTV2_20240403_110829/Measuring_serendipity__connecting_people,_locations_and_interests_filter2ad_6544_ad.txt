and become sources in early evening(6 PM-7 PM). They are
dominated by people at work, who reside at their oﬃces
during business hours.
Noon hotspots. These locations become sinks during
the afternoon (12 AM-1 PM) and sources shortly after (2
PM-3 PM). They are dominated by people taking a noon
(lunch) break.
Evening hotspots. These locations are sinks during
the evening (7 PM-8 PM) and sources shortly after(10 PM-
11 PM). They are dominated by people going out in the
evening.
Night hotspots. These locations are sinks in early evening
(6 PM-8 PM), stationary locations during the night and be-
come sources in the early morning (7 AM-9 AM). They are
dominated by the people at their homes during night.
By applying the above analysis we identify 23 day hotspots,
28 noon hotspots, 8 evening hotspots, and 62 night hotspots.
A majority (95%) of hotspots get classiﬁed by one label only.
Our next goal is to understand what online applications do
people access at these locations. More precisely, we want
to answer the following related questions: (i) What gen-
eral application aﬃliations do people who gather in these
hotspots have, i.e., what is the hotspots’ userbase; and (ii)
what applications do users access when they are present at
hotspots?
First, we deﬁne the userbase of a hotspot (or, any loca-
tion) as the breakdown in applications accessed by the users
who were present at the hotspot, while considering all the
applications that they have accessed during the seven day
trace period, i.e., not necessarily just the applications they
accessed while they were present at the hotspot. Figure

Figure 8: Hotspots application statistics
8(a) shows the results regarding hotspots’ userbase. It plots
the normalized user aﬃliation for given applications at dif-
ferent hotspots. For example, the ﬁgure for noon hotspots
shows that 50% of users present at noon hotspots use e-
mail (during the seven day interval, not necessarily in the
given hotspot), 30% access music, etc. Because users can
have more than one application aﬃliation, the sum of nor-
malized aﬃliations does not equal to one. The key insight
from the ﬁgure is that all hotspots have exactly the same
userbase. The majority of people at these locations access
e-mail on their mobile phones, and the least number engages
in dating. Indeed, the trend over all locations (hotspots and
non-hotspots) is exactly the same (the result not shown in
the ﬁgure). Hence, it appears that there is nothing speciﬁc
about users who enter these hotspots relative to those who
do not access them.
However, on considering the actual applications accessed
at the hotspots, things are quite diﬀerent (see Figure 8(b)).
The ﬁgure clearly shows that there is a strong correlation
between the hotspot type and the primary application that
people access at these hotspots. In other words, people with
the same general application aﬃliations show highly skewed
and biased group behavior towards a single application at
the considered hotspots.
In particular, social networking
is the dominant application among those at noon hotspots;
music among those at night hotspots; e-mail among those at
oﬃce hotspots; and dating among those at evening hotspots.
Thus, the given locations are not hotspots only in terms of
a signiﬁcant number of users present at them at a speciﬁc
time. Stunningly, these locations are application hotspots as
well — large groups of people show common ‘cyber’ behavior
at them.
4.1 Time(cid:173)of(cid:173)day or Location?
Given that hotspots happen at detected locations, yet
hotspots are time-of-day dependent, the next question is:
what determines the bias shown by hotspots’ users: time-
of-day eﬀects or the locations themselves?
Figure 8(c) shows the time of-day eﬀect; we plot the ap-
plication accesses by clients outside the hotspots, yet at
the same time periods when a hotspot happens. For ex-
ample, consider the locations which are not a hotspot at
noon, thereafter referred to as noon non-hotspots. For these
noon non-hotspots, we collect statistics about user accesses
in the same time period, 12-2 PM. We can see a diﬀerent
trend than the one shown in Figure 8(b). As an example,
at noon, social networking is not accessed as frequently at
the noon non-hotspots. In the evening, dating is the least
accessed application outside evening hot spots, etc. Hence,
we conclude that time-of-day does not dominantly aﬀect the
accesses at hotspots.
Figure 8(d) shows that location itself dominantly deter-
mines the bias in application accesses observed at hotspots.
In particular, we plot the number of accesses at the hotspot
locations outside the time period that characterizes the given
hotspot. The results clearly show the same trends as ob-
served at hotspots in Figure 8(b).
In particular, music is
the leading application at locations corresponding to night
hotspots even during the daytime as well; social networking
is the leading application at locations corresponding at noon
hotspots even outside noon intervals; dating is the leading
application at locations corresponding to evening hotspots
even during non-evening periods. Only in the case of day
(oﬃce) hotspots, the leading application is no longer e-mail,
275but music. Music prevails in these areas as they are domi-
nated by residential customers during nights.
Algorithm 1 Multi-partitioning users and locations in to k
clusters each.
5. REGIONAL ANALYSIS
Individual users do not span the entire metropolitan area.
Hence, the probability for one user to meet another user
from a diﬀerent part of the area might be small. Thus,
to fully understand the potential for serendipitous location-
based services, we ﬁrst attempt to split the metropolitan
area into smaller regions, i.e., by clustering groups of peo-
ple who access the network from similar locations (base-
stations). Then, we explore the interactions within these
regions. In this context we study three user interests which
are representative of serendipitous location-based services:
dating, social networking, and music. We currently only use
broad interest identiﬁers, assuming this can be a suﬃcient
trigger for users to meet up, e.g., users interested in mu-
sic may be prompted when they are in proximity and may
decide to meet up. We leave an exploration of ﬁne-grained
interests, e.g., users interested in classic rock likely to meet
up, to future work. Regardless, the broad interest categories
allow us to provide an important upper-bound on likelihood
for users with similar interests to meet up.
Our ﬁrst task is to identify regions (composed of loca-
tions) and also to determine people belonging to a certain
region based on the time they spend in it. We model this
problem as a bipartite graph between users and locations,
and then perform a co-clustering across users and locations
such that there is a one-to-one correspondence between a
cluster of users and that of locations. In this regards, co-
clustering can be thought of as a graph partitioning problem.
To solve this NP-hard graph partitioning problem, several
heuristics such as Kernighan-Lin [18] have been proposed,
which, however, only consider the local minima while parti-
tioning. In contrast, spectral clustering has been shown to
be global and can obtain a semi-optimal cut [14]. Authors
in [11, 14] show that the second eigenvector of a graph’s
Laplacian matrix gives a guaranteed approximation to the
optimal cut. Other approaches [21, 12] use multiple eigen-
vectors to obtain a k-way partitioning of a graph. We adopt
one such multi-way partitioning approach that was proposed
to obtain a co-clustering of words and documents [12].
We begin by deﬁning a bipartite graph G between users
and locations. Let u = 281, 394 be the total number of users,
and let l = 1, 196 be total number of locations. The vertices
of graph G comprise of all users and locations, for a total of
(u+l) vertices. In the graph G, an edge connects a user i to a
location j if the user has spent time in that location (936,280
edges). Each edge is given a weight W (i, j) as the amount
of time (seconds) spent by a user in that location and a
weight 0 if a user has never visited a location. By deﬁnition
of the bipartite graph, there are no edges between vertices
of the same type i.e., between users or between locations.
Denote A as the user-by-location matrix of dimension u × l
with values A(i, j) = W (i, j). The multi-partitioning algo-
rithm for co-clustering users and locations is as described in
Algorithm 1.
The number of connected components in the graph G is
given by the number of trivial singular vectors of the graph
Laplacian [12]. We obtain only one trivial singular vector,
implying that the dynamics of human movement connects
the entire metropolitan area in to one giant connected com-
ponent. Still within this giant connected component, loca-
tion clusters exist on account of the fact that a correspond-
ing cluster of users spends majority of its time within a

location cluster. We run the multi-partitioning algorithm 1
with diﬀerent values for the number of desired clusters k and
across multiple runs of the algorithm, we always identiﬁed
the same ﬁve signiﬁcant regions.
Table 3 presents the ﬁve regions (clusters) and the corre-
sponding statistics. Cluster 4 is the largest. It covers the
downtown area, and it clusters together around 82k users.
Cluster 1 and Cluster 3 are suburbs that immediately border
the downtown, with cluster 1 being more urban. Clusters 2
and 4 are suburbs located farther away from the downtown.
Indeed, the average number of users per base-station clearly
reveals the more urban nature of clusters 4 and 1 relative to
other clusters. The average number of users per base-station
in these two clusters is above 320, while for the other three
clusters it is below 200 on average. Indeed, the density of
users is higher in urban areas.
The urban nature of clusters 4 and 1 is further revealed
via the number of hotspots that occur in these regions. For
example, as many as 55 and 39 hotspots reside in clusters 4
and 1, respectively. To the contrary, less than 10 hotspots
on average reside in the other three regions. Interestingly
enough, the number of day hotspots is as high as 15 in region
4, while it is zero in region 1. As we mentioned above, cluster
4 covers the business part of the downtown area, and all day
hotspots reside there. Although cluster 1 is urban, it is more
residential; hence, no day hotspots occur.
Table 4 presents the statistics for inner- and outer-cluster
user movement, as given by the binary rule Deﬁnition 1 in
Section 3.
Inner- and outer-cluster movement are deﬁned
by whether the two endpoints involved in a movement rule
belong to the same cluster or not, respectively. Our obser-
vations are the following. First, as expected, the majority
of users move within their clusters, as the percents on the
