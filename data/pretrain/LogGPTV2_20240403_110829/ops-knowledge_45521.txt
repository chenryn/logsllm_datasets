To identify patterns in the log, we can generalize the information as follows:

**Original Log Entry:**
- "Received block blk_3587508140051953248 of size 67108864 from /10.251.42.84"

**Generalized Pattern:**
- "Received block blk_<block_id> of size <size> from /<ip_address>"

Where:
- `<block_id>` represents a unique identifier for the block (e.g., `3587508140051953248`).
- `<size>` represents the size of the block in bytes (e.g., `67108864`).
- `<ip_address>` represents the IP address from which the block was received (e.g., `10.251.42.84`).

This pattern allows you to easily recognize and extract the relevant information from similar log entries.
