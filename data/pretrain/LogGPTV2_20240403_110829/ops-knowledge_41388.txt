User: I'm trying to access a usb device through python but I'm unsure how to find the path to it.
The example I'm going from is:
pipe = open('/dev/input/js0','r')
In which case this is either a mac or linux path. I don't know how to find the path for windows.
Could someone steer me in the proper direction? I've sifted through the forums but couldn't quite find my answer.
Thanks,

Assistant: "Everything is a file" is one of the core ideas of Unix.  Windows does not share this philosophy and, as far as I know, doesn't provide an equivalent interface.  You're going to have to find a different way.
The first way would to be to continue handling everything at a low level & have your code use a different code path under Windows.  The only real reason to do this is if your goal is to learn about USB programming at a low level.
The other way is to find a library that's already abstracted out the differences between platforms.  PySDL immediately comes to mind (followed by PyGame, which is a higher level wrapper around that) but, as that's a gaming/multimedia library, it might be overkill for what you're doing.  Google tells me that PyUSB exists and appears to just focus on handing USB devices.  PySDL/PyGame have been around a while & are probably more mature so, unless you've got a particular aversion to them, I'd probably stick with them.
