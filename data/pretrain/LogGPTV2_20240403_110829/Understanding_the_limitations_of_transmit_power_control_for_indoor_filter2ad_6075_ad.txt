Figure 9: Normalized Kullback-Leibler Divergence
(NKLD) for the four representative traces. Clearly
for NLOS-heavy trace, NKLD decreases sharply
with the increase in number of packets, reaching
a value of 1 for a sample size of the order of 5000
packets. For LOS-light however, this value is around
30,000 packets.
Figure 10: Comparison between distributions ob-
tained from n packets (as determined by the online
algorithm) and the true distributions obtained from
long term traces. The two distributions are remark-
ably similar thereby indicating the eﬃcacy of our
online mechanism
measure the corresponding NKLD for each q(x) (with p(x)
as the reference long term distribution).
Figure 9 shows the NKLD curve obtained for the repre-
sentative traces from the four categories discussed before.
NKLD is a decreasing function of n, although the exact
shape of the curve varies as per the environment. We assume
without the loss of generality, the tolerable error or relative
distance between actual distribution and distribution ob-
tained by sampling n packets be 10%. Figure 9 can be used
to calculate the length of packet sequence required to achieve
the error bound under varying scenarios. While LOS-light
and NLOS-light require about 20,000 packets each, LOS-
heavy and NLOS-heavy scenarios require less than 10,000
packets as shown in Table 1.
Summary: The number of packets required to determine a
close approximation for RSSI distribution is especially high
for the LOS-light scenario while for a NLOS-heavy scenario
the number is relatively lower. The accuracy of an RSSI dis-
tribution varies directly with the number of bursts captured.
Since, the NLOS-trace trace seen has short burst sizes we
can obtain large number of bursts using a smaller trace to
accurately model the RSSI distribution while the trace re-
quired for LOS-light scenario is larger owing to longer burst
sizes. This analysis shows that sampling very large number
of packets (≈ 100000) to obtain RSSI distribution is not re-
quired in majority of traces, with the notable exception of
LOS-light scenario.
3.5 Algorithm Online-RSSI
Based on the above analysis, we describe an online algo-
rithm to compute the RSSI distribution in an online fashion
by predicting the number of packets needed in order to ac-
curately characterize the distribution in any environment.
As shown in Figure 9, initially NKLD (or error) decreases
rapidly with the increase in n, but stabilizes after a threshold
T, slowly tending to zero. It implies, that beyond a certain
Online-RSSI(burst size,tolerance)
initialize n to 1
sample(n) = Sample Random Sequence(n)
q(x) = Compute RSSI Distribution(sample(n))
do
n’ = n + k * burst size
sample(n’) = sample(n) + Sample Random Sequence(k *
burst size)
q’(x) = Compute RSSI Distribution(sample(n’))
if Compute NKLD(q(cid:4)(x)||q(x)) ≤ tolerance
return q(x)
update n = n’, q(x) = q’(x) and continue
Figure 11: Algorithm to ﬁnd length sequence n for
which the RSSI distribution stabilizes
length of packet sequence, the decrease in NKLD(or error)
is minimal and hence there is not much gain in sampling
longer packet sequences. The online algorithm is shown in
Figure 11. The enabling observation for the above algo-
rithm is that after the NKLD curve stabilizes, increasing
the length of packet sequence does not change the distri-
bution substantially. So we compute the RSSI distribution
for n and n + burst size for varying values of n and return
the value for which both the distributions have relative dis-
tance less than the tolerance level. We use burst size as
an increment, as RSSI varies signiﬁcantly across bursts and
we need to consider at least a gap of more than burst size
to conclude that the RSSI distribution has stabilized. For
our experiments we ﬁnd that typically an increment of one
burst size is suﬃcient to yield correct results using the on-
line mechanism. Table 1 shows the values of n obtained for
the four representative traces shown in ﬁgure 5. The value of
n obtained using an online mechanism is close to the value
obtained using oﬄine analysis of the traces.
In order to
evaluate the eﬃcacy of our online mechanism (to determine
n) we compare the distribution obtained using a packet se-
quence of length n with the distribution obtained using large
traces (≈ 100, 000). Figure 10 shows that the distribution
obtained using n as determined by the online mechanism
closely approximates the true distribution for all the traces.

old for determining the packet length sequence in
the oﬄine mechanism. Burst sizes corresponding to

Validating Eﬃciency of Online-RSSI : We validate the
eﬃciency of Online-RSSI by using the traces collected in our
indoor WLAN deployment as described in Section 3.1. Us-
ing those traces, we ﬁrst build an accurate estimate of the
signal strength distribution for each scenario for diﬀerent
power levels. These distributions are computed over large
traces (comprising of ≈ 100, 000 packets) and act as a base-
line against which we compare the distribution generated by
Online-RSSI. Figure 10 shows the accuracy of Online-RSSI
for a given power level in diﬀerent scenarios. The results for
diﬀerent power levels are similar in nature to the ones pre-
sented here. The base line distributions for diﬀerent scenar-
ios are shown in dotted lines and the real time distribution
generated by Online-RSSI is shown in solid lines. As shown
in the ﬁgure, Online-RSSI is able to accurately estimate sig-
nal strength distribution and the errors (NKLD distance be-
tween baseline and estimated) are found to be within 5%
for LOS-light, NLOS-light and NLOS-light, while for NLOS
heavy it was found to be with 20 %. This indicates that the
algorithm has reasonable accuracy in estimating the RSSI
distribution in an online fashion for diﬀerent scenarios.
4. EMPIRICAL MODEL FOR POWER
CONTROL
As discussed in Section 2.1, RSSI values of neighboring
power levels tend to overlap signiﬁcantly in indoor scenar-
ios, with some indoor settings more prone to multipath ef-
fects (like cubicles) than others (like large conference halls).
Similarly the interference and other factors that determine
the extent of RSSI variations will be diﬀerent for diﬀerent
indoor environments. Hence, it is possible that some in-
door environments may allow more power levels to be dis-
tinguishable (where RSSI variations are low) as compared to
others (where RSSI variation is high). Based on our online
mechanism to dynamically determine the number of packets
required to characterize RSSI distribution in any environ-
ment, we present an empirical model for transmit power
control, Model-TPC, that outputs the set of feasible (non-
overlapping distribution) power levels for a given indoor set-
ting.

Figure 12: Probability distribution function for
RSSI values received at varying power levels at the
transmitter. The plots represent the distributions at
receiver RB-10, RB-11, RB-12 and RB-8, in order
from top to bottom. The exact positions of these re-
ceivers with respect to the transmitter can be seen
in ﬁgure 2. The amount of overlap varies with the
location and only 2-3 power levels are distinguish-
able at most of the receivers.
Figure 13: Steps involved in construction of Model-
TPC. The receiver estimates the RSSI distribution
using our Online-RSSI and computes set of feasible
power levels as applicable to itself. This information
is then sent to the transmitter to be used in power
control
4.1 Model-TPC
Construction of our model proceeds through the following
important steps, also shown in Figure 13. Assume we are
operating in the context of a wireless node X.
1. Estimating RSSI distribution: The RSSI distribu-
tion for any given power level is estimated using the
Online-RSSI algorithm described in Section 11. Note
that the RSSI distribution is captured at the receiver
and communicated back to the sender as a feedback,
as shown in Figure 13. Many proposed approaches
(such as [2]) already incorporate protocol-level con-
structs to implement such functionality. Ongoing data
communication between the participating nodes can
be leveraged to gather this information. This process
is repeated for diﬀerent power levels available in the
hardware. Note that for our experiments, this proce-
dure is repeated for diﬀerent hardware available power
levels (6 for Cisco Aironet). In future, if the wireless
hardware supports a large number of power levels, the

Figure 14: Cumulative distribution of throughput
achieved by the wireless clients with/without the
empirical model for adaptation at location T1. The
average throughput for the adaptation process is
also shown in the ﬁgure
cost for this step can be limited through a combina-
tion of sampling and simple approximation techniques
to determine the RSSI distribution of power levels. We
leave such extensions as directions for future work.
2. Deciding the feasible power levels: At comple-
tion of Step 1, the wireless node X would have built
an empirically tuned model for the diﬀerent power lev-
els, much like Figure 12. At this point, if the NKLD of
distributions of any two power levels is greater then a
threshold N KLDthresh, then the two power levels are
considered to be distinct and can be used simultane-
ously. In theory, dynamic programming can be used to
determine the largest set of feasible power levels sat-
isfying above condition. For simplicity, we scan from
maximum power level to lowest power level, picking all
the power levels that satisfy the N KLDthresh criteria.
Figure 12 shows the distribution of RSSI for various re-
ceivers in our indoor WLAN deployment (Figure 2), when
T1 is used as a transmitter and power level is varied at
the granularity of 10mW. The power levels are not shown
in the graph for the sake of clarity. The top most plot is
for receiver RB-10, followed by RB-11, RB-12 and RB-8 in
that particular order. We use the steps outlined above to
determine the feasible power levels for the aforementioned
receivers. The distributions corresponding to these feasible
power levels are marked in black in Figure 12. As can be
seen, the selected power levels overlap minimally (NKLD ≥
4). We also computed the error (captured by the NKLD
function) between the accurate distributions and the distri-
butions estimated by Online-RSSI. For each of these power
levels, we found the error to be within 10 % of the desired
maximum error. Clearly the amount of overlap (and hence
the number of distinguishable power levels) depends on the
location of the receiver, with RB-10 observing less overlap as
compared to RB-11, which practically observes only a single
power level. These results clearly indicate that the set of
feasible power levels is highly correlated with the location of
the receiver and motivates the case for location-based power
control, where the transmitter uses a diﬀerent set of power
levels for each client depending on client’s location.
4.2 Summary
For a given a wireless environment, our proposed model
and its associated algorithms were able to accurately deter-
mine a good and useful set of power levels. The set of useful
power levels as computed by Model-TPC are valid till traﬃc
characteristics (other interference source) and wireless envi-
ronments (physical obstacles etc) remain similar. Using our
Online-RSSI algorithm, we already sample suﬃcient packets
