Question: A web server is experiencing a SYN flood attack, where the attacker is sending a large number of SYN packets with spoofed IP addresses and not completing the handshake. Considering the attack's impact, which of the following are viable defenses the server could employ to mitigate the attack? Choose all that apply.
"A": "Increase the server's memory capacity (overprovisioning) to handle a larger number of incomplete TCP sessions.",
"B": "Implement SYN cookies to prevent the allocation of server memory for connections until the handshake is complete.",
"C": "Introduce a delay in processing SYN packets to slow down the rate of incoming connections.",
"D": "Enable stateful packet inspection on the network firewall to block connections from spoofed IP addresses."
Answer: AB
