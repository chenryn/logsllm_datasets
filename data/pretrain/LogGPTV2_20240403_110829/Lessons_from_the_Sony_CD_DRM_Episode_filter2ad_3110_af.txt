### Access to Protected CDs and DRM Updates

To gain access to her protected CDs, a user might be prompted to update the software. This approach could convince some users to update, thereby extending the effectiveness of the Digital Rights Management (DRM) system for those users. However, this method has several drawbacks. If the computer is not connected to the internet, the software will eventually lock down because it cannot obtain the necessary certificates. Allowing the software to continue functioning without updates would enable users to bypass the DRM by preventing network connections. A software bug could also lead to an irreversible lockdown. Additionally, if the vendor's internet site is shut down, such as in the case of bankruptcy, the software could lock itself down.

### Drawbacks of Forced Updates

Forced updates can be counterproductive, giving users more reasons to defeat or remove the DRM software. Users are more likely to keep the software if it does not behave annoyingly. Forcing updates may reduce the DRM system's overall effectiveness if it convinces users to remove the DRM entirely. From the user's perspective, every software update poses a security risk, potentially introducing hostile or buggy code. Given these issues and the potential user backlash, it is not surprising that neither XCP nor MediaMax attempted to force updates.

### User Outrage and Control over Computers

One notable aspect of the Sony CD DRM episode was the level of outrage expressed by users. Typically, bugs in popular software products that endanger security or privacy result in users grumbling and updating their software. However, the anger over the CD DRM issue was much more intense. What made this issue different?

There are three key reasons:
1. **Unexpected Software Inclusion**: Many users did not expect audio CDs to contain software. Unlike complex software like email clients, which inherently include components that might have bugs, CDs do not need to include software. Therefore, users are less willing to accept the risk of security problems.
2. **Deliberate Choices by Vendors**: Some harmful aspects of the CD DRM software were deliberate choices by the vendors, including Sony-BMG. Users who might forgive implementation errors will not accept the intentional introduction of security and privacy risks. The rootkit functionality, installation without consent, lack of uninstallers, and phone-home behavior were all deliberately implemented.
3. **Compounded Implementation Errors**: When the vendors made implementation errors, these were exacerbated by aggressive installation and reluctant uninstallation mechanisms. For example, the file permission problem discovered by Burns and Stamos was difficult to fix because the MediaMax autorun program reset permissions to dangerous values every time a disc was inserted, without user consent. Similarly, the vendors' desire to limit the use of their uninstallers led to designs that relied on downloading code using ActiveX controls, leaving users vulnerable to critical code-download vulnerabilities.

These factors led some users to conclude that Sony-BMG and the DRM vendors prioritized their business interests over their customers' security and privacy. Users who might have forgiven a few mistakes by a well-intentioned vendor were less forgiving when they felt the vulnerabilities were intentional.

### Future Implications

While Sony-BMG and other copyright owners may tread more carefully in the future, there remains a fundamental tension between DRM vendors' desire to control and limit how computers are used and users' need to manage their own systems. The struggle for control over users' computers will likely continue.

### Conclusion

Our analysis of Sony-BMG’s CD DRM offers broader lessons for content companies, DRM vendors, policymakers, end-users, and the security community. We draw six main conclusions:

1. **Incentive Alignment**: The design of DRM systems is driven by the incentives of content distributors and DRM vendors, but these incentives are not always aligned. Where they differ, the DRM design may not serve the interests of copyright owners or artists.
2. **Security and Privacy Risks**: Even with the backing of a major content distributor, DRM can expose users to significant security and privacy risks. The drive for aggressive platform building often leads vendors to adopt spyware tactics that exacerbate these risks.
3. **Inverse Relationship Between Efficacy and Security**: There can be an inverse relationship between the efficacy of DRM and the user’s ability to defend their computer from unrelated security and privacy risks. Effective defense requires understanding and controlling installed software, but many DRM systems undermine this.
4. **Ineffectiveness of CD DRM Systems**: CD DRM systems are largely ineffective at controlling content use. Increased complexity has not improved their effectiveness and may have created more avenues for attack. It is unlikely that future CD DRM systems will perform better.
5. **Weak Connection to Copyright Law**: The design of DRM systems is only weakly connected to the contours of copyright law. These systems do not enforce copyright law as written but instead seek to enforce rules dictated by the label’s and vendor’s business models, implicating other public policy concerns like privacy and security.
6. **High Stakes**: Poor DRM design choices can seriously harm users, create major liability for copyright owners and DRM vendors, and ultimately reduce artists' incentive to create.

### Notes

1. As news of the rootkit spread, we added to the public discussion with a series of 27 blog posts analyzing XCP and MediaMax. This paper provides a more systematic analysis, along with much new information. Our original blog entries can be read at [http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/?cat=30&m=2005](http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/?cat=30&m=2005).
2. Music industry rhetoric about DRM often focuses on P2P, and some in the industry probably still think that DRM can stop P2P sharing. We believe that industry decision-makers know otherwise. The design of the systems we studied supports this view.
3. Similar application blacklisting techniques have been used in other security contexts. The client software for World of Warcraft, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game, checks running applications against a regularly updated blacklist of programs used to cheat in the game [12].
4. An extreme extension of this would be to adopt rootkit-like techniques to conceal the copying application’s presence, just as XCP hides its active protection software.
5. Forging a mark is probably not copyright infringement. Unlike the musical work in which it is embedded, the mark itself is functional and contains little or no expression, and therefore seems unlikely to qualify for copyright protection. In principle, the mark recognition process could be covered by a patent, but we are unaware of any such patent relating to XCP or MediaMax. Even if the vendor does have a legal remedy, it seems worthwhile to design the mark to prevent forgery if the cost of doing so is low.
6. By locating the watermark nearly five seconds after the start of the track rather than at the very beginning, MediaMax reduces the likelihood that it will occur in a very quiet passage (where it might be more audible) and makes cropping it out more destructive.
7. This design seems to be intended to lessen the audible distortion caused by setting one of the bits to the watermark value. The change in the other two bits reduces the magnitude of the difference from the original audio sample, but it also introduces a highly uneven distribution in the three least significant bits that makes the watermark easier to detect or remove.
8. The restrictions imposed by the DRM players only loosely track the contours of copyright law. Some uses that could be prohibited under copyright—such as burning three copies to give to friends—are allowed by the software, while some perfectly legal uses—like transferring the music to one’s iPod—are prevented.
9. This file is hidden and protected by the XCP rootkit. Before the user can access the file, the rootkit must be disabled, as described in Section 7.2. We did not determine how the MediaMax player stores the number of copies remaining.
10. The rootkit also hooks NtOpenKey but does not alter its behavior.
11. Users could also mislead the DRM software about the date and time, but most users with the inclination to do that would probably just remove the DRM software altogether.
