He holds a PhD in Information Engineering from the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia.

### Introduction

Traditional search techniques rely on a direct connection between the user's query and the information retrieved by the search engine. Users are limited to specifying keywords that are syntactically matched against a database of keywords and references. This approach has several limitations, including low precision (the ratio of relevant results to the total number of results) and low recall (the ratio of relevant results retrieved to the total number of relevant results in the reference base). These issues are often exacerbated by polysemy (where a word can have multiple meanings) and synonymy (where different words can refer to the same concept).

To address these challenges, a new generation of search engines, known as "semantic-based search engines," has been developed. These engines aim to find resources based on similar concepts and logical relationships rather than just similar words. They typically utilize metadata, controlled vocabularies, thesauri, taxonomies, and ontologies to describe searchable resources, ensuring that the most relevant information is returned.

### Objectives of the Special Issue

This special issue aims to compile recent research and developments in the creation of a new paradigm for search engines that leverages metadata, semantics, and ontologies. It provides readers with a comprehensive overview of the key issues and advancements in semantic search engines.

### Contributions

One of the main challenges in semantic search engines is the recognition of items of interest in web documents. The first three papers in this issue address this issue from different perspectives.

**First Paper: Data Extraction and Machine Learning**  
Xu and Embey present a method that combines techniques from data extraction, information retrieval, and machine learning. Their approach uses an ontology to describe the information of interest to users, which is then used to extract data from web documents. Statistical measures derived from the extracted data are used to determine the relevance of documents through machine-learned rules.

**Second Paper: CORE Module for Incremental Searching**  
The second paper introduces the CORE module, which enables incremental searching based on the co-occurrence of entities, ranking, and tracking trends and popularity timelines. CORE extends the KIM platform for semantic annotation, indexing, and retrieval, providing an infrastructure for the automatic extraction of named entity references and descriptions from text documents. The module evaluates associative relations between entities based on their frequency in specific contexts and tracks trends over time.

**Third Paper: Sindice for Semantic Web Data Sources**  
The third paper presents Sindice, a lookup index for resources crawled on the semantic web. Sindice collects RDF documents and indexes them based on resource URIs, inverse functional properties, and keywords. A web front-end and a public API allow users to look up resources and search full-text descriptions, retrieving the URLs of sources where the resources occur.

### Additional Papers

**Fourth Paper: Thesaurus-Based Indexing**  
In the fourth paper, the authors discuss the use of thesaurus-based indexes to improve document retrieval, particularly by addressing the problems of synonyms and homonyms. They highlight the importance of the quality of the thesaurus used for indexing and evaluate a method that combines statistical and visualization techniques to detect potential issues in the thesaurus.

**Fifth Paper: Expressive Power of Query Languages**  
The fifth paper addresses the expressive power of query languages used in current search engines. Schellhase and Lukasiewicz propose a new search query paradigm for literature searches, leveraging metadata about research publications, authors, organizations, and scientific events. Their approach uses a query language based on description logics and variable-strength conditional preferences, with a domain-independent theoretical foundation.

**Sixth Paper: Optimization for RDF Stores**  
Finally, Battré introduces an optimization approach for RDF stores using distributed hash tables. This approach caches and reuses intermediate results from previous queries to enable quick processing of new queries. The paper includes an evaluation section comparing different caching strategies.
