Variation of prediction error across diﬀerent paths
and traces: Figure 5 shows the median, as well as the
10/90-th percentiles, of the relative prediction error on a per
path basis (recall that we have 7×150 measurements from
each path). There are three paths that we did not include
in this graph because they have excessive prediction errors.
With the exception of 4-5 paths that mostly give smaller
underestimation errors, the rest of the paths give mainly
overestimation errors. Another interesting point is that dif-
ferent paths exhibit widely diﬀerent predictability. About 10
out of the 35 paths have much larger prediction errors as
well as wider error ranges than the rest of the paths, ex-
tending up to E=10 or higher. This implies that, not only
is it hard to predict TCP throughput with an FB method,
but also it is hard to bound the prediction error that should
be anticipated.
Figure 5 raises the following question: which paths have
the largest prediction errors? Figure 6 is a scatter plot that
shows the relation between the actual throughput R of each
transfer and the corresponding prediction error E. Clearly,
most of the large overestimation errors occur in transfers
that have very small throughput. Speciﬁcally, 42% of the

samples with R ≤ 0.5Mbps have E > 10, compared to 0.2%
for samples with R ≥ 0.5Mbps.2
Further analysis of the 10 paths with the largest median
prediction errors in Figure 5 reveals that 2 of them are
Europe-to-US paths, while the rest are within the US. 77%
of the predictions for these paths are based on the PFTK
model. This percentage is larger than that among all paths
(56%). This implies that very large prediction errors are
more likely in lossy paths. For most of the PFTK-based
predictions in these 10 paths, the loss rate increases signif-
icantly after the target ﬂow starts, while the RTT does not
show a large increase. These observations agree with the
hypothesis that the bottleneck link was already congested
before the target transfer. For most of the predictions based
on avail-bw, on the other hand, the loss rate remains negli-
gible during the ﬂow, while the RTT increases slightly after
the ﬂow starts. We do not know whether the errors in those
cases are due to avail-bw overestimation, or due to bursty
losses experienced by TCP but not by our periodic probes.
We also found that, with the exception of a single path,
the variation of E across diﬀerent traces of the same path is
not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent. Consequently, the “time-of-day”,
which diﬀerentiates traces of the same path, does not seem
to be a major factor in determining the FB prediction error.
Predictability of window-limited ﬂows: Another inter-
esting question is whether the FB predictor would be more
accurate for window-limited ﬂows (i.e., W/ ˆT < ˆA), given
that those ﬂows do not attempt to saturate the network
path. To answer this question, we extended each epoch
with another IPerf TCP transfer with W =20KB. We ver-
iﬁed that this transfer was window-limited on 18 of the 35
paths, and the ratio W/( ˆT ˆA) varied between 0.02 to 0.81.
Figure 7 compares the RMSRE between the transfers with a
large maximum window (W =1MB) and a small maximum
window (W =20KB). Note the log-scale of the Y-axis.
In
all paths, the prediction error of window-limited ﬂows was
lower, often by a large factor. In particular, 14 out of the
18 paths have an RMSRE that is less than 1.0 for window-
limited ﬂows. We anticipate that for many applications a
TCP throughput prediction that is accurate within a factor
2The exponentially decreasing patterns shown in Figure 6
are caused by sets of almost equal predictions (due to similar
RTT and loss rate estimates) for individual paths, while the
corresponding throughput measurements varied uniformly
in a certain range.

of two would be acceptable. Consequently, if predictability
is more important than throughput maximization, the TCP
ﬂow should have a limited advertised window such that it
does not attempt to saturate the underlying avail-bw.
4.3 Summary
The results of this section showed that FB prediction can
be signiﬁcantly inaccurate, mostly in congested paths and
when the target ﬂow attempts to saturate the underlying
avail-bw. The major cause of prediction errors is that the
RTT and/or loss rate before the transfer are signiﬁcantly dif-
ferent than while the transfer is in progress. We note again
that this cause of prediction errors is not speciﬁc to the
PFTK formula. So, it is unlikely that other TCP through-
put models would have produced more accurate FB predic-
tions. Other important causes of prediction errors are the
diﬀerence between periodic and TCP sampling of the RTT
and loss rate processes, and the diﬀerence between TCP
throughput and avail-bw.
5. HISTORY-BASED PREDICTION
A fundamentally diﬀerent approach to predicting the TCP
throughput of a large transfer is to use throughput measure-
ments of previous transfers in the same path. This History-
Based (HB) prediction method is similar to traditional time
series forecasting, where past samples of an unknown ran-
dom process are used to predict the value of the process
in the future. The HB approach is possible in applications
where large TCP transfers are performed repeatedly over
the same path.
In this section, we ﬁrst introduce three families of simple
linear predictors (Moving Average, Exponential Weighted
Moving Average, and non-seasonal Holt-Winters). We do
not examine more complex linear predictors such as ARMA
or ARIMA because selecting their order and linear coeﬃ-
cients requires a large number of past measurements [13];
instead, we expect that applications will have to perform
TCP throughput HB prediction based on a limited num-
ber of past transfers (say 10-20). We then show that two
distinct time series “pathologies”, namely outliers and level
shifts, can have a major impact on the prediction error, and
propose simple heuristics that can deal with these patholo-
gies eﬀectively.
5.1 Linear Predictors
Moving Average (MA): Given a time series X, the one-
step n-order MA (n-MA) predictor is:
iX
ˆXi+1 =
1
n
Xk
k=i−n+1
where ˆXi is the predicted value and Xi is the actual (ob-
served) value at time i. If n is too small, the predictor can-
not smooth out the noise in the underlying measurements.
On the other hand, if n is too large the predictor cannot
aptly adapt to non-stationarities (e.g., level shifts due to
load variations or routing changes).
Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA):
The one-step EWMA predictor is
ˆXi+1 = αXi + (1 − α) ˆXi
where α is the weight of the last measurement (0< α <1).
Similar to the MA predictor, a higher α cannot smooth out
the measurement noise, while a lower α is slow in adapting
to changes in the time series.
Holt-Winters (HW): The non-seasonal Holt-Winters pre-
dictor is a variation of EWMA that attempts to capture
the trend in the underlying time series, if such a trend ex-
ists.This predictor is more appropriate than EWMA for non-
stationary processes, especially if the latter exhibit a linear
trend. A non-seasonal HW predictor maintains a separate
smoothing component ˆX s
i , and it
depends on two parameters α and β, both in (0, 1). Specif-
ically, the predicted value at time i is
i + ˆX t
i and a trend component ˆX t
i = ˆX s
ˆX f
i
where
and
i+1 = αXi + (1 − α) ˆX f
ˆX s
i
ˆX t
i+1 = β( ˆX s
i − ˆX s
i−1) + (1 − β) ˆX t
i−1.
The initial values of ˆX s and ˆX t are X0 and X1 − X0, re-
spectively, assuming that the time series starts at i=0.
5.2 Detection of Level Shifts and Outliers
While experimenting with various predictors, we found
that the largest prediction errors are often caused by level
shifts and outliers in the observed time series. Further-
more, if we manage to avoid these two characteristics in the
throughput time series, the exact choice of the predictor, or
of its parameters, does not make a signiﬁcant diﬀerence.
A level shift is a type of non-stationarity, and it causes a
signiﬁcant and typically sudden change in the mean of the
observed time series. An outlier is a measurement that is
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent, beyond the typical level of statistical
variations, relative to nearby measurements. Both outliers
and level shifts have been studied extensively in the theory
of forecasting [17]. In Figures 8(a), 8(b) and 8(c) we show
examples of traces that exhibit both outliers and level shifts,
observed in our TCP throughput measurements. One way
to deal with level shifts, after they are detected, is to restart
the predictor, ignoring all previous history. Outliers, on the
other hand, can be just ignored.
We next describe simple heuristics to detect level shifts
and outliers. Suppose that {X1, ...Xn} is the sequence of
