**Issue: Running Python in Interactive Mode within Windows PowerShell**

I am trying to run `python.exe` in interactive mode within Windows PowerShell. I have added `C:\Python27` to my system's PATH. However, when I type `python` into the shell, a new Command Prompt window opens and runs Python, instead of running it directly within PowerShell. This is problematic because when I try to run commands like `python --version`, a new Command Prompt window opens and then immediately closes, making it impossible for me to read the output.

**Background:**
- This issue started after I installed `pip`, `easy_install`, and `virtualenv` this morning.
- Previously, Python was running correctly within PowerShell.

**Solution:**

After much troubleshooting, I found a solution that resolved the issue. In Windows, you can access the environment variables through the following steps:

1. Open **System Properties**:
   - Right-click on **This PC** (or **Computer** in older versions) and select **Properties**.
   - Click on **Advanced system settings**.
   - In the **System Properties** window, click on the **Environment Variables** button.

2. Update the **PATH** variable:
   - There are two sections in the **Environment Variables** window: **User variables** and **System variables**.
   - Add `;C:\Python27` to the end of the **PATH** value in both the **User variables** and **System variables** sections.

3. Apply the changes:
   - Click **OK** to close all windows and apply the changes.
   - Restart PowerShell to ensure the changes take effect.

After making these adjustments, Python should now run in interactive mode directly within PowerShell, and commands like `python --version` will display the output as expected.

I hope this helps! If you have any further issues or questions, feel free to ask.
