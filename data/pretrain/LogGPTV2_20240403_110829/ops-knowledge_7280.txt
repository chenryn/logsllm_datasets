User: I am trying to get python.exe to run in interactive mode in windows powershell. I have added c:\python27 to my PATH and when I type "python" in into the shell a new command prompt window opens running python, rather than running within powershell. This is a problem as when I run things like "python --version" it launches the new command prompt window and then closes before I can read it. Does anyone know how to get python to run in powershell?
Note: this used to work before I started to install pip, easy_install and virtualenv this morning.
Thanks
Assistant: I just solved this issue after nearly pulling my hair out. Thought I would share. In windows system > advanced system settings > environment variables there are two places to change the PATH, user variables and system variables. I added ";c:\python27" as the value for PATH in both. It now works
