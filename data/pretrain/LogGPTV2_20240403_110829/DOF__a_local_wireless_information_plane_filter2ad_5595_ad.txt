DOF is implemented in C using a fast FFT implementation from
FFTW [1] on a PC with an Intel Core i7 980x processor and 8GB of
RAM. We use a wideband radio [18] (shown in Fig. 5) with a frontend
bandwidth of 100MHz spanning the entire ISM band. The wideband
radio is a modiﬁed channel sounder that was originally designed for
taking channel measurements by sending user speciﬁed pilots. We
modify the frontend to be able to send and receive arbitrary wave-
forms in the entire 100MHz ISM band. The frontend has a carrier
1a generalization for MIMO signals of the Spectral Correlation Func-
tion deﬁned in earlier sections for single signals

ever, similar to other SDR platforms such as USRP2s, the intercon-
nect between the SDR frontend and the PC does not meet the latency
requirements needed to implement timing sensitive MAC functions
such as ACKs. DOF’s algorithms operate on the raw digital samples
collected by the wideband frontend. We provide a microbenchmark
for our implementation in Sec. 5.1.
5.1 Complexity
In this section we discuss the computational complexity of DOF.
We compare DOF’s complexity against the simple and widely used
PSD based edge/energy detector [28, 16, 22]. For AoA estimation,
we compare it against the MUSIC algorithm [23] used in prior work
such as SecureAngle [27].
Computational Complexity: The main computationally intensive
task in DOF is the feature extraction step, which involves comput-
ing Eq. 3 for every component in the feature vector. The complex-
ity is dictated by the choice of the FFT length N and the averaging
window L. Higher values of N and L provide better resolution for
the FFT and SCF respectively [9] and consequently higher accuracy
for DOF, but also increase complexity. In our current implementa-
tion, we ﬁnd that N = 512 and L = 16 sufﬁces for DOF to work
accurately over the 100MHz ISM band. Prior energy/edge based ap-
proaches [28] use a 256 point FFT, but were implemented over nar-
rowband USRP2 radios with at most 10MHz bandwidth, while DOF
works over a wideband radio with 100MHz bandwidth. We believe
that prior work would have to use at least a 512 length FFT to oper-
ate over such widebands, otherwise the spectral resolution would be
too low resulting in inaccuracy. (we veriﬁed the inaccuracy with 256
length FFTs experimentally for one prior approach [28]).
DOF and edge/energy detection share the same FFT complexity [2]
of 5N log N = 20384 ﬂoating point operations per window. Next,
DOF computes the K = 80 feature vector components by averaging
over 16 windows, which costs another 4 (cid:3) 16 (cid:3) 80 = 5120 ﬂoat-
ing point operations. Note that prior FFT based approaches [28, 22]
also have to perform this averaging to smooth the FFT and avoid
false positives. Our radio type classiﬁer has an l0 norm estimator
and equalizer, that require K + N (cid:25) 600 comparisons. The SVM
classiﬁers require K = 80 real multiplications, while the spectrum
occupancy estimation algorithm requires a small number of extra op-
erations equal to the number of signal types detected. Thus in total,
DOF requires 6000 extra ﬂoating point operations, in addition to the
20384 ﬂoating point operations that the FFT requires. Hence DOF’s
extra complexity is less than 30% over a standard FFT which we be-
lieve is reasonably modest.
Energy detection of course cannot compute AoAs, hence we com-
pare DOF’s complexity with the MUSIC algorithm [23] that is used
in prior work [27]. The order computational complexity of MUSIC
as well as DOF’s AoA estimation algorithm is O(P M 3), where M is
the number of antennas and P is the number of distinct AoAs. How-
ever, we ﬁnd empirically that the constant in the order notation is
signiﬁcantly smaller for DOF. This is because the MUSIC algorithm
involves computing eigenvectors for a series of matrices as it con-
verges to the correct AoAs. DOF on the other hand has to compute
the eigenvectors only once as described in Section 4.4.
To summarize, DOF has modestly higher if not similar compu-
tational complexity compared to traditional energy/edge detectors,
and actually lower complexity than other AoA methods. However,
Figure 5: Testbed layout and wideband software radio
as we will see in the next section, DOF signiﬁcantly outperforms
energy/edge based approaches and has additional features such as
signal type detection that energy/edge based detectors do not pro-
vide. Hence, we believe that the additional complexity is a reasonable
tradeoff given the signiﬁcant gains in functionality and accuracy.
Micro-benchmark: Table 2 provides benchmark results for DOF’s
current software implementation. We calculate the normalized time
by dividing the wall clock time used by our system divided by the
actual signal time on the air. The goal is to see how close to “realtime"
our system is. We provide benchmarks as we vary the bandwidth of
the radio from 20MHz to 100MHz in increments of 20MHz. A larger
bandwidth naturally means a faster stream of data to keep up with.
DOF performs in realtime for radios with bandwidths of up to
40MHz and starts falling behind with higher bandwidths. However,
this is a software based implementation of the FFT (which requires
the most computation), and we believe a hardware implementation
would be signiﬁcantly faster and be able to handle higher bandwidths.
Further these benchmarks compare favorably with prior work [16].
6. EVALUATION
In this section we evaluate the accuracy of DOF and determine
how different factors such as signal SNR, the number of interfering
signals impact its performance using testbed experiments. Our cur-
rent implementation is geared towards 5 common signal types in the
ISM band - WiFi, Zigbee, Bluetooth, analog/digital cordless phones
and microwave signals.
We ﬁrst summarize our ﬁndings:
(cid:15) DOF’s performance is robust to the SNR of the detected sig-
nals. We ﬁnd that DOF achieves greater than 85% accuracy
even when the SNR of the detected signals is as low as 0dB.
The best known prior approach have errors greater than 40%
for SNRs below 8dB. [16]
(cid:15) DOF’s performance is robust to interference between detected
signals. We ﬁnd that DOF accurately classiﬁes all component
signals with greater than 82% accuracy even with 3 interfering
signals. Prior approaches do not work with interfered signals.
(cid:15) DOF’s spectrum occupancy estimates are at least 85% accu-
rate, at SNRs as low as 0dB and in the presence of multiple
overlapping and interfering signals. The best known prior ap-
proach achieves an accuracy of 65% under similar conditions.
(cid:15) DOF’s AoA estimation is as accurate as the best known prior
technique [23]. Further, unlike prior work it accurately asso-
ciates the estimated AoAs with the correct type for the signal
arriving at that angle.
Compared Approaches: We compare against the best known im-
plemented systems for each component in DOF. First we compare
against RFDump [16] which uses timing and phase analysis for de-
tecting radio types. Second, we compare against Jello [28] which
uses edge detection on the FFT to detect occupied spectrum. Finally,
we compare against SecureAngle’s [27] MUSIC technique [23] for
computing AoA.
Testbed: The testbed for the experimental results consists of an in-
door ofﬁce environment with cubicle-style ofﬁce rooms (see Fig.5).
The total ofﬁce size was 105ft (cid:2) 48ft, the ceiling height was 10ft, and
RX 2 RX 3 TX 1 RX 1 236Figure 6: DOF has high classiﬁcation accuracy over a large range of SNRs and for multiple interfered signals.
the height of the cubicle partitions was 5.5ft. Our wideband radio was
placed at three different locations as shown by the shaded circles in
Fig. 5, while the radios that we wish to detect (WiFi, Zigbee, cord-
less phones, bluetooth devices and microwaves) are placed randomly
in the ofﬁce and allowed to transmit. The measurements were taken
when the ofﬁce was empty, and ambient interference from sources
outside our control (the departmental WiFi network, microwaves etc)
was absent. While the design of DOF was tested using data from
a 100 MHz channel sounder, note that conceptually DOF will work
with any stream of raw data which can be obtained via commodity
software radios such as USRPs. We used the channel sounder as op-
posed to USRPs because we wanted to demonstrate the full breadth
of DOF’s capabilities and did not want the range of our tests to be
curbed by the limitations of the data acquisition device.
Training Data: The DOF SVM classiﬁers are ﬁrst trained with la-
beled data generated via controlled experiments in the testbed. The
training signals are generated by randomly turning on one of the ﬁve
radios at a random location with randomly picked PHY parameters
when applicable (bitrate, channel etc). Turning on means continu-
ously transmitting packets for WiFi, Zigbee and Bluetooth radios,
making a continuous call for the cordless phone and powering on for
the microwave oven. We generate 30 labeled points for each radio
type. The SVMs for detecting multiple signal types are trained by
synthetically combining the single signal labeled data as described in
Sec. 4.2. Hence the training complexity of DOF is relatively mod-
est. Note that once DOF is trained, the training data allows DOF to
operate in any physical environment so long as the training is repre-
sentative of all possible parameters that a signal could have (bitrate,
modulations, etc.). But for signals which aren’t FCC-certiﬁed (e.g.
microwaves), training has to be done speciﬁc to each instance since
those protocols are not governed by a uniform speciﬁcation.
Calculating SNR: In our plots, the reader will often see measure-
ments at SNRs as low as (cid:0)5dB. The reason we are able to calculate
such low SNRs is our wideband radio, which is a modiﬁed channel
sounder. Speciﬁcally, the sounder was initially designed to conduct
wide area surveying for a WiMax network deployment. In such sce-
narios, such low SNRs need to be measured and the sounder comes
equipped with a proprietary technique that allows two sounders to
be placed at separate locations and yet accurately measure the SNR
between them even when it is as low as (cid:0)5dB. We leverage this ca-
pability to measure the SNRs in our experiments.
6.1 Estimating Signal Types
We evaluate DOF’s accuracy in detecting component signal types
in the received signal and compare it to the accuracy of RFDump [16],
deﬁning accuracy as the probability of correct classiﬁcation.
Method: For each run, we pick a random subset of the ﬁve different
radio types. We place the corresponding radios at a random loca-
tion, randomly set their PHY parameters (bitrate, channel etc) in the
testbed and allow them to transmit. We also measure the SNR of the
channel from each location. The same received samples are passed
to the DOF detector and the RFDump detector - both algorithms are
run at the same bandwidth. Because RFDump was not designed for
such a large bandwidth, it does not work if there are multiple signals
overlapping in time and for legacy radios such as cordless phones
and microwave ovens. Hence for RFDump, we eliminate traces with
multiple interfered signals, or if they have analog phone or microwave
signals in them and compute its accuracy only for the remaining three
signal types. Fig. 6 plots the accuracy of DOF and RFDump against
SNR when there is a single signal. Because SNR doesn’t work as a
metric when there are multiple interfered signals, we plot the CDF of
the error across all experimental runs in Fig. 6.
Analysis: Figs. 6(a) and 6(b) show that DOF has high classiﬁcation
accuracy over a large range of SNRs and for multiple interfered sig-
nals. DOF achieves an accuracy ranging from 85 (cid:0) 100%, even for
SNRs as low as 0dB when there is a single signal present. For multi-
ple interfered signals, DOF achieves an accuracy greater than 85% at
least 90% of the time even when there are three interfered signals in
the trace. DOF is robust to SNR because our feature vector compo-
nents are calculated by correlating and integrating repeated patterns
over long intervals, hence even if individual samples have low power,
the integration over the entire interval yields very prominent features.
Also since the repeating patterns are unique to each signal and uncor-
related with other signal types, they are quite robust to the presence
of interfering signals.
RFDump achieves an accuracy of at most 60% when the SNR of
the detected signal is between between (cid:0)5 to 8dB. RFDump uses
two techniques, timing analysis and phase analysis to classify signal
types. Timing analysis is based on detecting start and end of pack-
ets using energy detection, while the phase analysis component is
dependent on computing statistics of the phases of received samples
which use phase modulation such as Zigbee and Bluetooth. Both
operations are error prone at medium to low SNRs, since noise sig-
niﬁcantly affects the accuracy of energy detection, and distorts the
received phases affecting the phase statistics. Finally, RFDump fails
to work in the presence of multiple interfering signals, since it cannot
detect start or end of packets reliably when signals overlap in time,
and phases are distorted when there is a strong additive interferer.
Why is accuracy slightly lower for interfering signals? DOF’s ac-
curacy is slightly lower when there are multiple interfering signals
present in the received signal. Because DOF’s ability to classify
multiple interfering signals hinges on how well it is able to exploit
asynchrony, at ﬁrst glance it seems like this may be the root of the
problem. Upon closer inspection, we found that while asynchrony
