I understand you're trying to set up Tesseract OCR and pytesseract on Windows 7, but you're encountering an issue where the `tesseract` command is not recognized. Let's go through a few steps to troubleshoot and resolve this problem.

### Steps to Resolve the Issue

1. **Verify Tesseract Installation:**
   - Ensure that Tesseract-OCR is correctly installed in the directory `C:\Program Files (x86)\Tesseract-OCR`.
   - You can verify the installation by navigating to the directory in the Command Prompt and running:
     ```sh
     C:\Program Files (x86)\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe -v
     ```
   - If this command returns the version information, Tesseract is installed correctly.

2. **Check the PATH Environment Variable:**
   - The PATH environment variable should include the directory containing `tesseract.exe`, not the full path to the executable.
   - Open the System Properties (right-click on "Computer" or "This PC", select "Properties", then "Advanced system settings", and finally "Environment Variables").
   - In the "System variables" section, find the `Path` variable and edit it.
   - Add the following directory to the PATH:
     ```
     C:\Program Files (x86)\Tesseract-OCR
     ```
   - Ensure there are no trailing semicolons or extra spaces in the PATH.

3. **Update the PATH Variable:**
   - After updating the PATH, close any open Command Prompt windows and open a new one to ensure the changes take effect.
   - Run the following command to check if `tesseract` is now recognized:
     ```sh
     tesseract -v
     ```

4. **Check for Conflicting Entries:**
   - Your current PATH includes `C:\Users\Moondra\Anaconda_related\Anaconda\geckodriver.exe;`. This should be the directory, not the full path to the executable.
   - Correct this entry to:
     ```
     C:\Users\Moondra\Anaconda_related\Anaconda
     ```

5. **Test Tesseract from Any Directory:**
   - Once the PATH is correctly set, you should be able to run `tesseract` from any directory in the Command Prompt. For example:
     ```sh
     tesseract DMTX_screenshot.png out
     ```

### Example of Corrected PATH
Your PATH should look something like this:
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Tesseract-OCR;C:\Users\Moondra\Anaconda_related\Anaconda;... (other paths)
```

### Additional Tips
- Make sure there are no typos in the directory paths.
- Avoid including the full path to executables in the PATH. Only include the directories.
- Restart your computer if the changes do not take effect immediately.
