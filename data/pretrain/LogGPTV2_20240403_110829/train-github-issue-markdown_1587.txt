  1. After setting syntax or file encoding from the menus in the status bar, the cursor focus stays in the status bar, and to move focus back to the file with keyboard only, you need to press Tab key twice (after setting syntax) or thrice (after setting encoding). Imho it would be better to move the cursor focus to its last position in the file window.
  2. Even though the focus is retained (coloured outline) after completing syntax/encoding change, there is no way to bring up these menus with Enter key (or other key combinations that I've tried).
If you decide to move cursor focus to file, the status bar menu outline should
be removed.
If you decide to keep the focus in the status bar, the focus appearance could
be improved in appearance. Currently it doesn't look bad, but it could at
least use some padding on the sides of the focused item.

Lastly, setting syntax/encoding should be available from the Command Palette.
Perhaps the same way as in Sublime Text (showing all entries prefixed
appropriately) or just a way to trigger the selection menus as they exist now.
