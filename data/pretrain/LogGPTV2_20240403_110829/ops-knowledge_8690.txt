User: I am making a python program for a Minecraft server that automatically bids on items up to a certain price. In appdata/roaming/.minecraft/logs there is a chat log called "latest.log". This log is constantly being updated with what everyone on my server is saying over chat. If I open it and view the text, the log doesn't automatically update (obviously). How would I use a python script to print every line in my log and automatically update?
I am on Windows 8.1 with Python 2.7.9
Assistant: The data isn't written to the latest.log file until the process writing it (probably the server) fills or flushes the buffer. There probably isn't any way to change that from within Python. The best bet is to see if you can configure the writing process to flush after each line.
