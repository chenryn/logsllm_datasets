User: Usually I use my .bashrc file to load some functions for my bash environment. When I call these functions (that I created based on some frameworks I use). So, I play around with variables such as PATH and PYTHONPATH when I use the functions depending on the environment I'm working on.
So far so well with the terminal. The problem is that when I use emacs these functions and these environmental variables that I activate with my functions, they don't exist. .bashrc is not read by emacs, and therefore I don't have the functions loaded by .bashrc don't work. I would like them to work.
Any Ideas?
Assistant: The issue might be that emacs, as many other programs you run, reads your login shell rc files, such as ~/.bash_login or ~/.profile, but not ~/.bashrc, where as your terminal also reads you user shell rc file: ~/.bashrc.
