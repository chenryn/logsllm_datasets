can be still used in the new system.
This paper can be seen as an attempt to ﬁll a part of the
gap between the two ends of the credential systems spec-
trum, namely standard signatures and pseudonym systems,
with the former oﬀering merely the basic security properties
and the latter oﬀering ultimate security and privacy protec-
tion. For many purposes, the full protection guaranteed in
pseudonym systems are not needed. Hence, properly deﬁn-
ing and securely designing new schemes which give up parts
of such full protection for better eﬃciency still remains a
challenging open problem.

query mi, if X is embedded in H(mi). Furthermore, AGQ is
able to properly respond to all the interaction requests of
A: when A asks to interact with a clone holding a signature
on a message m, where X is not embedded in H(m), since
AGQ already knows the signature on the message (σ = r),
it is able to play the role of the requested clone for A. On
the other hand, if A asks to interact with a clone holding a
signature on a message m, where X is embedded in H(m),
AGQ will use its ability to request interaction with an honest
GQ prover clone to simulate the interaction for A. Since the
honest GQ prover clone supplies AGQ with a z, such that
ze = Y · X c mod N , by relaying the same Y and c, AGQ will
be able to respond to A with ζ ← rc · z mod N , such that
ζ e = Y · X c · rec = Y · [H(m)]c mod N , which convinces A.
When A declares that the ﬁrst phase of the attack is over and
enters the second phase, again similar to Coron’s method, if
A chooses a target message ˙m, where X is not embedded in
H( ˙m), AGQ fails. But if A chooses a target message, where
X is embedded in H( ˙m), AGQ will be able to impersonate
the GQ prover using a similar method as before: since A is
able to provide AGQ a ζ, such that ζ e = Y · [H( ˙m)]c mod N ,
by relaying the same Y and c, AGQ will be able to respond
with z ← ζ/ ˙rc mod N , such that
ze =
ζ e
˙rce =
Y · [H( ˙m)]c
Y · (X c · ˙rce)
=
˙rce
˙rce
= Y ·X c mod N,
which convinces the honest GQ veriﬁer. Similar to Coron’s
analysis, here A’s success probability can be calculated and
the claimed bound can be proved. The full proof is presented
in Appendix E.
Combining this theorem and [5, Theorem 4.1], we will simply
have the following.
Corollary 2. In the random oracle model, RSA-COP is
cop-imp-ca-secure if one-more RSA inversion problem is
hard for moduli generated by GenRSA and the challenge space
. Quantitatively speaking, we have

where qs is the number of credentials the issuer signs and ‘
is the challenge length in RSA-COP.
6.3 Efﬁciency of the Scheme
We have showed that GQ provides a cop-imp-ca-secure
credential ownership proof for RSA-FDH credentials. As
mentioned before, GQ is only known to be HVZK. This can
be considered as a clue that RSA-COP fulﬁlls our motivating
initial to design COP protocols that can be implemented
more eﬃciently than ZK proofs. A thorough examination
of the scheme reveals that this indeed is the case. In Ta-
ble 3 RSA-COP is compared with some of the most eﬃcient
constructions of ZK for widely-used cryptographic relations,
to the best of our knowledge. The compared protocols are
two ZK proofs of knowledge of discrete logarithm (denoted
ZK-PoK-DL) and one ZK proof of knowledge of eth root
(denoted ZK-PoK-RSA) from [15, 13]. As the table shows,
ZK solution to our problem takes up to four rounds of in-
teraction and costs the credential holder up to four group
operations, while employing GQ as RSA-COP reduces the
interaction rounds to three and credential holder cost to
only two group operations. This property makes our solu-
tion desirable for light-weight implementations of credential
systems with the mentioned security requirements.

an RSA modulus N and two values e and d such that e·d = 1
mod ϕ (N ), where ϕ is the Euler function.
D. PROOF OF THEOREM 1
tacking IBE from a cop-imp-ca adversary A = A.(cid:0)ˆP, ˆV(cid:1) at-
Proof. We construct an owe-id-cca adversary AIBE at-
tacking IBE-COP and show that AIBE is able to mount a
successful attack if A succeeds.
In the ﬁrst phase of the owe-id-cca attack, AIBE is given
the public parameters of IBE and oracle access to the extrac-
tion and decryption oracles. At the end of this phase, AIBE
is expected to decide on the identity it is going to attack.
AIBE does this running A as a subroutine.
AIBE ﬁrst runs A.ˆV on the public parameters given to it as
input. While running, A.ˆV will make two kinds of requests:
signing oracle queries and requests to interact with a clone
of honest prover holding a signature on a message of A.ˆV’s
choice. AIBE answers the signing oracle queries using the
extraction oracle provided to it, as signing in IBE-COP is in
correspondence with extraction in IBE.
When A.ˆV asks to have an interaction with a signature
holder clone on a message mi, AIBE sets IDi ← mi and waits
for the ﬁrst message of interaction. A.ˆV will send an en-
crypted challenge and expect to receive the correct decryp-
tion. AIBE answers to the challenge Ci using its decryption
oracle, i.e. queries (IDi, Ci) to the decryption oracle and
relays the oracle response back to A.ˆV. This way, A.ˆV will
receive what it expects, i.e. the decryption of Ci.
After A.ˆV has gathered enough information to be able to
impersonate, it decides on a target message ˙m, declaring
that it wants to impersonate a prover holding a signature
˙ID as
on the message ˙m. AIBE now sets
the target identity it wishes to attack, and declares that the
ﬁrst phase of the owe-id-cca attack is over.
˙ID ← ˙m, outputs
In the second phase of the owe-id-cca attack, AIBE is
given a challenge ciphertext C and oracle access to the ex-
traction and decryption oracles and is expected to be able
to decrypt the challenge. To do so, AIBE runs A.ˆP in the
second phase of the (simulated) cop-imp-ca attack. At this
stage, the successful A.ˆP is supposed to be able to imperson-
ate, i.e. to be able to properly respond to a challenge given
to it. AIBE simply sends the challenge ciphertext C to A.ˆP
and outputs the obtained response R. If A.ˆP is successful in
impersonation, this response must be the correct decryption
of C, which in turn means that AIBE will be successful in the
owe-id-cca attack.
AIBE does not query the decryption oracle in the second
phase of the attack, hence there is no Dec2
query.
Besides, it only queries the extraction oracle when A asks
a sugning oracle query. Therefore, it can be easily seen
that the success probability of AIBE is equal to that of A.
Furthermore, the running times of AIBE and A are equal.
Hence, AIBE is also poly-time and we have:
