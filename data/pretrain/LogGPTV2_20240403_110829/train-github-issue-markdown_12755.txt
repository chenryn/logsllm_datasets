### Expected Behavior
I expected to be able to set a proxy IP successfully.

### Actual Behavior
When I attempt to set the proxy, I encounter the following error: `err_NO_SUPPORTED_PROXIES`. How can I resolve this issue?

The code I am using is:
```javascript
app.commandLine.appendSwitch('proxy-server', 'socks5://username:password@ip:port');
win.webContents.session.setProxy({ proxyRules: 'socks5://username:password@ip:port' });
```

Thank you for your assistance!
