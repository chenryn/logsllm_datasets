### Impact on Congestion Controllers
Our current experience indicates that TACK (Transport Acknowledgment Control Kit) has a minimal impact on the performance of congestion controllers. However, we believe that more comprehensive investigations are necessary to fully understand how TACK interacts with various congestion control algorithms, such as CUBIC, Vegas, and Compound TCP.

### TCP Splitting
TCP splitting is a potential method to reduce the complexity of TACK-based protocol design. This approach leverages the fact that last-mile wireless networks typically have lower delays and faster convergence. In TCP splitting, a proxy access node divides the end-to-end TCP connection, which requires modifications to the access point (router). One well-known issue with TCP splitting is that it can compromise the reliability and security of the split TCP connection. For instance, a server failure may lead the client to incorrectly assume that data has been successfully received. The cost-performance trade-offs of TACK with and without TCP splitting warrant further study.

### Evaluation of TCP Friendliness
**Figure 15: Evaluation of TCP Friendliness.**
- **Bandwidth:** Randomly sampled between 1 and 100 Mbps.
- **Round-Trip Time (RTT):** Randomly sampled between 1 and 200 ms.
- **Bottleneck Buffer Size:** Randomly sampled between 0.5 and 5 BDP (Bandwidth-Delay Product).
- **Experiment Duration:** 60 seconds.
- **Metric:** Average ratio of throughput achieved by each flow to its ideal fair share for all tested algorithms.

### Conclusion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to present a complete protocol design that minimizes the ACK frequency required on the transport layer. The TACK-based acknowledgment mechanism introduces additional types of ACKs and enriches the information carried in ACKs, thereby reducing the number of ACKs needed. Specifically, IACKs (Immediate ACKs) expedite feedback for various instant events (e.g., packet losses), while TACK ensures robust feedback by periodically carrying detailed information in ACKs. TACK-based protocols are thus capable of achieving robust loss recovery, accurate round-trip timing, and effective send rate control. A TACK-based protocol is an excellent replacement for traditional TCP in scenarios where acknowledgment overhead is significant (e.g., WLAN environments) and also performs well in WAN scenarios. This serves as strong validation for the effectiveness of TACK.

This work does not raise any ethical issues.
