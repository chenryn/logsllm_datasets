User: I have a CGI script (pwyky) that I called index.cgi, put in directory wiki/, and setup Apache to call localhost/wiki/index.cgi when I access localhost/wiki.
I'm getting errors when I'm trying to use this application -- it creates a page with links like "http://localhost/wiki/@edit/index", but when I click that link, Apace is trying to serve "wiki/@edit/index" as a file. I suspect that I need to get Apache to pass /@edit/index into index.cgi.
In particular, looking through index.cgi, its looking for strings like "@edit" in REQUEST_URI environment variable.
Any idea how to fix this?
Assistant: You'd need to show your apache configuration to say for certain, but it seems that Apache isn't actually using mod_cgi to serve the index.cgi script. In your configuration there should be something like 'LoadModule mod_cgi'. It should be uncommented (i.e., it shouldn't have a '#' at the beginning of the line). 
If you want to test this, then write a 'Hello World' cgi script and put it (temporarily) in place of index.cgi and see if you can get that to run. Let us know the results.
