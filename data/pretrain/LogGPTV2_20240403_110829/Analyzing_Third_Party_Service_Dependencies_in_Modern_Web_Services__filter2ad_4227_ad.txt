### HTTPS Adoption and OCSP Stapling Trends

In 2020, the number of websites that adopted HTTPS increased to 69,725. Additionally, 23,196 new websites adopted HTTPS, with 11.9% of these supporting OCSP Stapling. In 2016, 5% of the top-100 websites, including haosou.com and naver.com, supported OCSP stapling.

However, 9.7% of the websites that supported HTTPS in 2016 dropped support for OCSP Stapling by 2020, as shown in Table 5. This includes popular websites such as dropbox.com, wordpress.com, and microsoft.com. The trend is more pronounced across ranks, with 7.5% of the top-100 websites dropping support compared to 9.7% in the top-100K. Conversely, 9.9% of the websites that supported HTTPS but did not have OCSP stapling in 2016 enabled it by 2020. Overall, there was no significant change in critical dependencies among the top-100K websites, but an increase in critical dependency was observed in more popular websites.

### Provider Concentration

#### Observation 7
Four out of 10,000 DNS providers critically serve 50% of the top-100K websites, two out of 86 CDNs critically serve 50% of the websites using CDNs, and two out of 59 CAs are critical dependencies for 50% of the websites that support HTTPS.

#### DNS Provider Concentration
Figure 5a illustrates the concentration and impact of major third-party DNS providers for the top 100K websites. The DNS ecosystem is heavily concentrated, with one DNS provider covering 23% and the top-3 DNS providers serving approximately 40% of the top 100K websites. 

There are subtle differences across popularity ranges. For example, CloudFlare critically serves 23% of the top 100K websites but is not a major provider for more popular websites. Dyn, on the other hand, is the most popular in the top-100, with 17% of the websites using Dyn and only 2% critically dependent on it. The difference in concentration and impact indicates the degree of redundancy. For instance, CloudFlare has a 1% redundancy (C-I = 24-23) because it requires DNS traffic to be routed through its network, which does not allow secondary DNS providers. Providers like Dyn, NS1, UltraDNS, and DNSMadeEasy encourage the use of secondary DNS providers, leading to higher redundancy.

#### CDN Provider Concentration
Figure 5b shows the major third-party CDN providers in the top 100K websites. Amazon CloudFront supports 30% of the websites using a CDN, and the top 3 cover 56% of the websites using a CDN, which is 18.6% of the top-100K websites. Akamai, which covers 18% of the top 100K websites, is more dominant in popular (top 100) websites compared to Amazon CloudFront.

Redundancy per provider, calculated by subtracting impact from concentration, shows that very few websites using CloudFront and CloudFlare are redundantly provisioned compared to customers of Akamai or Fastly. Akamai and Fastly support multi-CDN strategies, providing specific guidelines to enable it. Unlike DNS, using multiple CDNs does not always require provider support, leading to a higher degree of redundancy in CDN consumers.

#### CA Provider Concentration
Figure 5c shows significant concentration among CAs. 60% of the websites that support HTTPS (46.25% of the top 100K websites) are critically dependent on the top 3 CAs. DigiCert covers 32% of the top-100K websites and 44% of the top 100 websites that support HTTPS, making it equally popular across all ranks. Websites using Let’s Encrypt and Sectigo have higher support for OCSP stapling compared to other top providers like DigiCert, Amazon, and GlobalSign.

#### Observation 8
Between 2016 and 2020, the concentration in DNS and CA providers increased, while the concentration in CDN providers decreased. Figure 6a shows that 54 DNS providers serve 80% of the websites in 2020, compared to 2705 in 2016. The top 3 DNS providers impacted 29.3% of the top-100K websites in 2016, increasing to 40% in 2020. The major DNS providers remain largely the same, with CloudFlare, AWS DNS, and GoDaddy being the top 3 in both years. Following the Dyn incident, Dyn's footprint decreased from serving 2% of the top-100K websites in 2016 to 0.6% in 2020.

Figure 6b shows that the concentration in CDNs marginally decreased in 2020, with 5 CDNs serving 80% of the top-100K websites compared to 3 in 2016. The top 3 CDNs in 2020 cover 18.6% of the websites, down from 20.8% in 2016. The set of popular providers saw some churn, with Cloudfront becoming the most popular in 2020, replacing CloudFlare.

Figure 6c shows that the concentration in CAs increased in 2020, with 3 CAs serving 80% of the websites compared to 5 in 2016. The top 3 CAs in 2016 impacted 26% of the top 100K websites, increasing to 46.25% in 2020. The top 3 providers changed, with Symantec dropping off the list and Let’s Encrypt becoming the second most popular provider, increasing its impact from 2.4% in 2016 to 15% in 2020. Sectigo, formerly Comodo, saw a decrease in its impact from 15% in 2016 to 9% in 2020.

### Indirect Dependencies

#### CA to DNS Dependency
Out of 59 CAs, 27 (48.3%) use a third-party DNS provider, with 18 (66.67%) using a third-party DNS provider exclusively, including top-3 CA providers DigiCert, Let’s Encrypt, and GlobalSign. The use of specific third-party DNS providers by these 18 CAs is less concentrated: 4 use Comodo DNS, 3 use Akamai, and 3 use AWS DNS.

Three additional websites are dependent on a third party as they use a private CA, which itself uses a third-party DNS. These include godaddy.com, trustwave.com, and wisekey.com.

Observation 9: 72% of the websites are critically dependent on 3 DNS providers when considering direct CA to DNS dependency, compared to 40% when only accounting for website to DNS dependency.

Figure 7a shows that the concentration of providers has increased when considering CA to DNS dependency. For example, CloudFlare's concentration increased by 18% due to its use by Let’s Encrypt, the second major CA. Similarly, DNSMadeEasy's concentration increased from 2% to 27% because it is used by DigiCert, which serves 32% of the top-100K websites. Figure 7b highlights the change in impact, with 72% of the websites critically dependent on just 3 DNS providers compared to 40% when only considering direct website to DNS dependencies.

#### 2016 vs. 2020
We observe a decrease in the critical dependency of CAs in 2020. Out of the 70 CAs in 2016, 33 (47%) used a third-party DNS provider, and 24 (34.2%) were critically dependent on it. In 2020, 9 of these critically dependent CAs (e.g., GeoTrust, Symantec) moved to a private DNS, and 1 CA (Trust Asia) moved to a single third-party DNS provider from using a private DNS. Additionally, 2 redundantly provisioned CAs (DigiCert, Internet2) moved to a single third-party DNS. Overall, critical dependency decreased by 8.6% because 9 critically dependent CAs in 2016 shifted to a private DNS in 2020, while 3 became critically dependent.

#### CA to CDN Dependency
Out of the 59 CAs, 24 (40.6%) use CDNs, and 21 (35.6%) use a third-party CDN exclusively. These include major CAs such as DigiCert, Let’s Encrypt, Sectigo, and GlobalSign. The critically dependent CAs cover 73.8% of the websites using HTTPS. Akamai and CloudFlare are the dominant CDNs, each used by 5 CAs. As a result, 32 additional websites now have a third-party dependency, even though they use a private CA, which in turn uses a third-party CDN. This set includes popular websites such as microsoft.com, godaddy.com, and xbox.com.

Observation 10: 56% of the websites are critically dependent on 3 CDNs when considering CA to CDN dependency, compared to 18% when only considering website to CDN dependency.

Figure 8a shows that the concentration of CDNs has increased when considering CA to CDN dependency. For example, Cloudflare now covers 30% of the top-100K websites compared to 7% when only considering website to CDN dependency, due to its use by Let’s Encrypt. Similarly, Incapsula's concentration increased from 1% to 27% because it serves DigiCert, which is used by 32% of the sites. Stackpath, serving Sectigo, the third major CA, saw an increase in concentration from 2% to 16%. Figure 8b shows that the impact of CDNs also increases significantly. Overall, the top 3 CDNs in terms of impact have changed, previously covering 18% of the websites and now critically serving 56% of the websites.

#### 2016 vs. 2020
In 2016, 70 distinct CAs were observed, with 21 (30%) using a CDN. Of these, 18 (25.7%) CAs used a third-party CDN exclusively, including major CAs such as GeoTrust, GlobalSign, Symantec, and GoDaddy. In 2020, TeliaSonera CA moved from a third-party CDN to a private one, while three CAs (not specified) moved from no CDN to a third-party CDN.
