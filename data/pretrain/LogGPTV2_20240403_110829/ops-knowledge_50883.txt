I recently installed `python-mode` for Vim on my Mac OSX system and decided to try one of the Python motion commands. When I pressed `[C`, which I thought would take me to the next class, the screen changed to display only the class names in gray highlighting. I have reviewed the `python-mode` documentation but couldn't find any information about this behavior or how to revert it.

Initially, I assumed that quitting and reloading the file would resolve the issue, but when I reopened the file, it still displayed only the class names, highlighted in gray, with line numbers indicated.

How can I exit this "mode" or whatever state I am currently in?

It seems like you've encountered the "folding" feature in Vim. Here are some commands to help you manage folds:

- `zo`: Open the fold under the cursor.
- `zO`: Open all folds under the cursor.
- `zv`: Open enough folds to see the current cursor line.
- `zR`: Open all folds in the file.

For more detailed information, you can refer to the Vim documentation by typing `:help folding` in the command mode.
