User: I installed python-mode for vim on my Mac OSX system. I decided to try one of the python motion commands. I hit [C which I thought would go to the next class. But the screen also switched, to show ONLY class names in gray highlighting. I've searched the python-mode documentation, and I can't see anything about this happening, and therefore no way to undo it.
Well, I thought, I will just quit and reload, and everything will be fine. But no! When I come back in to the file, it opens as I left it, with just the class names showing, highlighted in gray, and indications of line numbers.
How do I get out of this "mode" or whatever I am stuck in?
Assistant: It sounds like you've discovered the "folding" feature of Vim. Press zo to open one fold under the cursor. zO opens all folds under the cursor. zv opens just enough folds to see the cursor line. zR opens all folds. See :help folding for details.
