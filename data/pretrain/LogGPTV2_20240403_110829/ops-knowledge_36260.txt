User: Is there a way that eclipse (edit: under windows) folds all comments and docstrings automatically when I open a python file?
Assistant: By default the loop and condition folds are disabled, to enable them go to Window -> Preferences -> PyDev -> Editor -> Code Folding. Apply code folding to all entries
