I was wondering if something like the following is possible.
Given the data structure:
  * docs 
    * doc1.json
    * doc2.json
And the following code:
    function loadDoc(name, cb) {
        require.ensure([], function (require) {
            cb(require("./docs/" + name));
        });
    } 
If I understand the current behaviour would be that doc1.json and doc2.json
both end up in one chunk together (one external JS file that will be loaded
dynamic). But is there any way to change the code so that doc1.json and
doc2.json get there individual bundle without having to hardcode for each file
a require.ensure?
