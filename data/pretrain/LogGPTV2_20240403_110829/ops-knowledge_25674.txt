The provided system log indicates several recurring issues within a Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) environment. Here is a step-by-step summary of the log:

1. **Lease Renewal Failures:**
   - The `LeaseRenewer` process, identified as `msrabi@msra-sa-41:9000`, repeatedly fails to renew the lease for the client `DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1`.
   - The failures occur over a period of 56 to 63 seconds, with each failure followed by a message indicating that the system will retry shortly.

2. **Address Changes:**
   - Multiple warnings are logged about address changes detected by the `org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Client` component.
   - The old address is `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000`, and the new address is `msra-sa-41:9000`.

3. **ReadProcessor Performance Issues:**
   - A warning is logged by the `ResponseProcessor` for block `BP-1347369012-10.190.173.170-1444972147527:blk_1073743512_2731` in the `org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.DFSClient` component.
   - The `ReadProcessor` took 65,020 milliseconds to read fields, which exceeds the threshold of 30,000 milliseconds.
   - This is followed by an exception in the `DFSOutputStream ResponseProcessor` for the same block.

4. **DataStreamer Errors:**
   - The `DataStreamer` for a file located at `/tmp/hadoop-yarn/staging/msrabi/.staging/job_1445144423722_0020/job_1445144423722_0020_1.jhist` logs an error recovery attempt for the same block.
   - The error is attributed to a bad datanode at `10.190.173.170:50010` in the pipeline.
   - An additional `DataStreamer Exception` is logged, indicating further issues with the data streaming process.

### Summary:
- **Lease Renewal Failures:** The `LeaseRenewer` process fails to renew the lease for `DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1` multiple times, with the system indicating it will retry.
- **Address Changes:** Frequent address changes from `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000` to `msra-sa-41:9000` are detected.
- **Performance and Data Issues:** There are performance issues with the `ReadProcessor` and errors in the `DataStreamer` due to a bad datanode, leading to exceptions and error recovery attempts.

These logs suggest potential network or configuration issues, as well as possible problems with the datanode at `10.190.173.170:50010`. Further investigation into these components and their configurations may be necessary to resolve the issues.
