User: I installed Python Anaconda on Mac (OS Mavericks). I wanted to revert to the default version of Python on my Mac. What's the best way to do this? Should I delete the ~/anaconda directory? Any other changes required? 
Currently when I run which python I get this path:
/Users/username/anaconda/bin/python
Assistant: In case you have multiple version of anaconda,
rm -rf ~/anaconda2 [for version 2]
rm -rf ~/anaconda3 [for version 3]
Open .bashrc file in a text editor
vim .bashrc
remove anaconda directory from your PATH.
export PATH="/home/{username}/anaconda2/bin:$PATH" [for version 2]
export PATH="/home/{username}/anaconda3/bin:$PATH" [for version 3]
