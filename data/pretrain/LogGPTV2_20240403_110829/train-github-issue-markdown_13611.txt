I am attempting to run three.js within rogerwang/node-webkit. The `canvas_` examples work without any issues, but I encounter a `Uncaught TypeError: Type error` when I try to open the `webgl_` examples.

The specific line of code that triggers this error is:
```javascript
_gl.uniformMatrix4fv(p_uniforms.projectionMatrix, false, camera._projectionMatrixArray);
```

Even after commenting out this line, other calls to `_gl.uniformMatrix4fv` continue to throw type errors.

Since three.js functions correctly in Chromium, I suspect that the issue might be due to missing or unsupported features in node-webkit. Could you provide some insights into what might be causing this error?

Thank you.
