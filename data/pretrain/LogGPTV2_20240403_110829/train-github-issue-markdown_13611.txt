I'm trying to get three.js to run in rogerwang/node-webkit, the `canvas_`
examples are all fine, but I got a `Uncaught TypeError: Type error` when
opening the `webgl_` examples.
The line that caused this problem is:
    _gl.uniformMatrix4fv( p_uniforms.projectionMatrix, false, camera._projectionMatrixArray );
After commenting this line, other calls to `_gl.uniformMatrix4fv` will still
throw type errors.
Since three.js is fine under Chromium, so I think it's caused by absence of
some features in node-webkit, what reasons do you think may have caused this
error?
Thanks.
