 **Bug summary**  
When using Pyinstaller in version 3.3.1, I get an error message that
"defaultParams" is not defined.  
The dictionary is located in __ init __.py @ line # 563 (Version 3.3.1).
In Version 3.2.2, "defaultParams" was imported from rcsetup at beginning of
file, but in version 3.3.1 it is not present
Version 3.2.2 ==> **from matplotlib.rcsetup import defaultParams,
validate_backend, cycler**  
Version 3.3.1 ==> **from matplotlib.rcsetup import validate_backend, cycler**
The only other location where "defaultParams" can be brought into __ init
__.py is @ line # 916, but maybe it is too far down for program to see.
I tried adding the import back, but does not work :)
**Code for reproduction**  
No code, just regular freezing in Pyinstaller
