**Bug Summary**

When using PyInstaller version 3.3.1, I encounter an error message stating that `defaultParams` is not defined. The dictionary `defaultParams` is referenced in `__init__.py` at line 563 (version 3.3.1). In the previous version 3.2.2, `defaultParams` was imported from `rcsetup` at the beginning of the file, but this import is missing in version 3.3.1.

- **Version 3.2.2:**
  ```python
  from matplotlib.rcsetup import defaultParams, validate_backend, cycler
  ```

- **Version 3.3.1:**
  ```python
  from matplotlib.rcsetup import validate_backend, cycler
  ```

The only other location where `defaultParams` could be imported into `__init__.py` is at line 916, but it may be too far down for the program to recognize it. I attempted to re-add the import, but it did not resolve the issue.

**Code for Reproduction**

No specific code is required; the error occurs during the regular freezing process with PyInstaller.
