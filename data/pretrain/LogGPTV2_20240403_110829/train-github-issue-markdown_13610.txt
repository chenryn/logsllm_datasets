Jasmine poses a problem since it relies on injecting variables into the local
scope of a module.
Here's what I want to accomplish.
  * Create my dev/production server bundle as usual in one file
  * Create a separate bundle for running via Jasmine whose modules can `require` any module out of the main server bundle.
  * None of those modules should be duplicated in the test bundle -- it should be able to access the same modules containing the realtime state of the server.
  * It must work with `target: 'node'`. I tried using CommonsChunkPlugin to do this but it doesn't seem to work with `target: 'node'`?
Is there a way to do this?
