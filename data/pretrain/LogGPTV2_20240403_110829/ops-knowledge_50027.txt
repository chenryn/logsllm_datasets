User: I want to send an email alert using the linux os when user delete python setup file. i made a screenshot program using python, unfortunately if user uninstall python setup file.I want to send an email to the admin. if you know the processing steps kindly share with me or please give any suggestions.
Assistant: The easiest way is to not allow the user delete the script. Put the script in one of the non-core bin directories, e.g. into /usr/local/bin as root and regular user will not be able to remove it.
