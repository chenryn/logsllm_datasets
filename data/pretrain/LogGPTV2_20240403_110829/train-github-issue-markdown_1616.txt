In my experience, there are few places in data work where problems with data
are more evident than when merging datasets -- something that is both a
problem (if you think you're doing a one-to-one merge and one of the keys
isn't unique in one dataset, you can introduce huge problems) and an
opportunity (checking that a merge works as expected is a great way to catch
problems).
With that in mind, I'd like to propose adding a `check_merge` argument that
accepts strings `one_to_one`, `one_to_many`, `may_to_one`, and `many_to_many`.
If one of those strings is passed, the `merge` function would then check
uniqueness of merge variables before running the merge, and if for example the
merge key for the first dataset has duplicates in a `one_to_many` merge, it
would throw an (informative) exception.
(Stata made a similar move to bake this functionality into its merge command
around Stata 12 using `1:1`, `1:m`, `m:1` syntax, which I'm also open to).
Though this functionality can be replicated with user tests, it gets tiring to
write them every time...
