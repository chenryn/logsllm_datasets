User: Sometimes I can save a script by using Ctrl+S when using IDLE, but then other times it fails to save for no reason, as haven't changed anything. Is this a bug of some kind? It's starting to irritate me.
Platform: Windows 7 Professional
Assistant: I've found that use of character æ, ø, å, even as it is comment out, Python 2.7 IDE won't save the file.
