ABSTRACT
Diagnostic Imaging System like X-Ray and CT are widely used in
hospitals. And for the reason that health data of patients is stored
and transferred digitally, security and privacy on diagnostic imaging
systems are of great significance to both patients and hospitals.
Although many works on diagnostic imaging system have been
studied currently, it’s hard to find a detailed analysis on current
research progress or a thorough survey on the security controls
that should be implemented on diagnostic imaging system. In this
paper, we evaluate medical devices from different vendors by the
model above. Finally, we conclude the evaluation and analysed the
future research directions. The survey of results shows that most
of diagnostic imaging systems are under risk and their information
security should be further improved.

compelled to process health data digitally. For example, as diagnos-
tician decides to take an X-Ray to patients, X-Ray image-acquisition
devices will execute corresponding commands and transfer X-Ray
images to its workstations. And diagnostician can edit the images
and save in PACS. And doctors can view patients’ X-Ray images
on PACS remotely. As is shown in Figure. 1, different systems are
connected by medical data protocols such as Digital Imaging and
Communications in Medicine (DICOM) [6].
Though many works in this field have been studied in academia,
most of vendors pay little attention on information security of
diagnostic imaging systems, which put health data under potential
risk.
In summary, our main contributions are:
• We design a checklist to examine diagnostic imaging system.
• We evaluate some radiologic device from different vendors.
• We conclude the survey of results and analyzed the future
research directions.
2 BACKGROUND
2.1 Diagnostic Imaging System
Diagnostic imaging (DI) system is a technique that creates visual
representations of the interior of a body for clinical analysis and
medical intervention (such as MRI, x-ray, ultrasound, CT and PET).

tional diagnostic imaging systems have been replaced to computer-
assisted ones. Novel diagnostic imaging systems electronically pro-
cess patient radiology images in digital format, which allows en-
tirely filmless operation. Then doctors can view images on PACS.
Figure. 1 shows the workflow in brief and Caterina et al. detailedly
described the x-ray workflow in Reference[5].
Diagnostician controls image-acquisition devices by worksta-
tions which run customized operating system. According to our
investigation, however, most of workstations have security vulner-
abilities such as OpenSSH (CVE-2016-10010), which may lead to
attackers’ intrusion.
Besides, standard organizations published a serious standards
such as IEC TR 80001-2-2:2012[2] and HIMSS/NEMA Standard HN
1-2013 "Manufacturer Disclosure Statement for Medical Device
Security"[3] to protect diagnostic imaging systems from intrusion.
2.2 DICOM and its security mechanisms
Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) is an
international standard to transmit, store, retrieve, print, process,
and display medical imaging information. And, DICOM makes
medical imaging information interoperable and integrates devices
from different vendors.
In terms of communication security of DICOM protocol, when
DICOM was first published in 1980s, on one concerned with infor-
mation security and DICOM encoding methods has become the only
data protection for nearly 20 years[8]. Obviously, it’s impossible
to defense every threat only with encryption methods. As DICOM
becomes an international standard for medical diagnostic image,
security and privacy of health data are strongly needed in the whole
lifecycle. Hence, in its latest edition, it addresses security issues in
Part 15[7]. However, there is still some room for improvement in
the approaches proposed in DICOM[4].
3 METHODOLOGY
We refer to some medical device standard such as [1] and design a
checklist to evaluate different aspects of diagnostic imaging system,
including confidentiality, integrity, availability, auditing and other
supplementary requirements. This evaluation involves underlying
hardware, operating system, software and network. And here goes
detailed evaluation methodology.
3.1 Confidentiality
Confidentiality of diagnostic imaging system consists storage con-
fidentiality, transmission confidentiality and protection of patient
private data.
• Storage Confidentiality: If devices storage health data,
manufacturers should provide sufficiently strong encryption
methods and disclosure detailed information of encryption
methods and categories of encrypted data. Besides, manu-
facturers are supposed to avoid use acknowledged insecure
algorithms, such as DES and RC4.
• Transmission Confidentiality: Any transmission of health
data should be based on secure communication protocol, in-
cluding HTTPS. And node authentication or white-list mech-
anism should be applied to avoid man-in-middle attack.
• Private Data Protection: If devices can export imaging
data, manufacturers should provide deidentification mecha-
nism.
3.2 Integrity
Integrity of diagnostic imaging system focuses on access control
and authentication.
• Access Control: Devices should implement role-based ac-
cess control mechanisms to prevent non-authorized access
and administrator can configure the authority of each role.
• Authentication: Devices should implement safeguards (such
as password, biometrics and identification card) to prevent
access of unauthorized users login.
• Auto Logoff: Devices should enforce logoff after a speci-
fied period of inactivity. Administrator can set the time of
inactivity period and manually logoff.
3.3 Availability
Availability of diagnostic imaging system focuses on application
availability, data restore and emergency access.
thorized users can access applications and data.
• Application Availability: Devices should ensure that au-
• Data Restore: Devices should implement data backup and
restore mechanism in case of data corruption. And encryp-
tion and validation mechanism should be implemented to
prevent data modification and breaches.
• Emergency Access: Device should incorporate an ability
for user to access and store private data in case of emergency
situation.
3.4 Auditing
Auditing of diagnostic imaging system focuses on non-repudiation,
verifiability and audit trail.
• Non-repudiation: Devices should ensure that any opera-
tion to health data can’t be denied by digital signature or
timestamp.
• Verifiability: Health data should contain a unique identifier
• Audit Trail: Devices should establish audit trail to record
user operation including User Login/off, Create-Read-Update-
Delete (CRUD) to health data, health data export/import and
transmission.
for tracing to the source.
3.5 Supplementary Requirement
Supplementary requirement of diagnostic imaging system includes
physical safeguard, system reinforcement and security guide.
• Physical Safeguard: Devices should ensure that any oper-
ation to health data can’t be denied by digital signature or
timestamp.
• System Reinforcement: Devices should provide certain
system reinforcement technique to prevent privilege promo-
tion and data breach, such as firewall, port closure, purview
control and shortcut closure.

We test 15 devices from 6 of the world’s biggest medical device
vendors. To protect corresponding commercial secrets, we have to
keep vendors anonymous. The results are listed in Table. 1. "High"
refers to that most of devices accords to requirements; "Medium"
refers to that part of devices accord to requirements or most devices
accord to part of requirements; and "Low" refers to that most of
devices don’t accord to requirements.
Generally, most of devices only implement basic security mech-
anisms and remain to be improved. It’s obvious that there is a
dichotomy between academic world and industrial world in this
field. Though many works have been done to encrypt health data,
most devices still suffers from the risk of data exposure and ven-
dors largely turn a blind eye to it. In terms of integrity, devices
majorly conform to requirements. Some small prints in "Auto Lo-
goff" such as inactivity period configuration is not supported by
most devices. The process of "Data Restore" is vulnerable as well.
Most backup data is stored in plain text and doesn’t implement
validation mechanisms. Hence, the confidentiality and integrity of
backup data cannot be guaranteed. It may be corrupted, sniffed
or has been tampered with. Besides, devices do not fully met with
in "Auditing". The digital signature is not applied in health data,
though many researches have been done to ensure non-requdiation.
However, thank to DICOM standard, health data contains times-
tamp in its header. Despite the fact that timestamp can be easily
modified, this mechanism exactly protects health data to some ex-
tend. There are problems in "Verifiability" as well. Most devices
use "UID" which is a built-in tag in DICOM standard to indentify
unique health data. However, practical tracing mechanism is not
provided. As for "Audit Trail", most devices can’t fully log every
specified operation. Most devices enable physical safeguards to
protect workstations. Nevertheless, system reinforcement needs
to be further enhanced. For example, attackers can escape from
current interface and start malicious process by shortcuts. (Such as
"Shift+Ctrl+Del" in Windows)
5 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTION
The survey of results demonstrates that diagnostic imaging system
are under enormous potential security risk. Most system stores pa-
tient demographic information and lacks in plenitudinous security
implement to ensure data confidentiality, availability and integrity.
The paper shows the strengths and weaknesses of information
security on diagnostic imaging systems. Manufacturers can develop
and upgrade their system according to our research. We suggest that
health data oriented encryption approach and difference privacy
method should be studied, and more flexible and secure access
control mechanism should be applied to protect health data. Besides,
system security on diagnostic imaging system should be regarded
with more attention. Malware and vulnerabilities on these platform
are one of the burning issues on diagnostic imaging system.
