## Abstract
Diagnostic imaging systems, such as X-Ray and CT, are widely used in hospitals. As patient health data is stored and transferred digitally, the security and privacy of these systems are of paramount importance to both patients and healthcare providers. Despite extensive research on diagnostic imaging systems, there is a lack of detailed analysis on current research progress and a comprehensive survey of the security controls that should be implemented. In this paper, we evaluate medical devices from different vendors using a structured model. Our findings indicate that most diagnostic imaging systems are at risk, and their information security needs significant improvement.

## 1. Introduction
With the advent of Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS), diagnostic imaging systems like X-Ray and CT have transitioned to digital processing of health data. For example, when a diagnostician orders an X-Ray, the image-acquisition device executes the command, transfers the images to workstations, and the diagnostician can edit and save the images in PACS. Doctors can then view these images remotely. Different systems are interconnected using medical data protocols such as Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) [6].

Despite academic advancements, many vendors pay little attention to the information security of diagnostic imaging systems, putting health data at risk.

Our main contributions are:
- Designing a checklist to evaluate diagnostic imaging systems.
- Evaluating radiologic devices from various vendors.
- Concluding the survey results and analyzing future research directions.

## 2. Background

### 2.1 Diagnostic Imaging System
A diagnostic imaging (DI) system creates visual representations of the body's interior for clinical analysis and medical intervention (e.g., MRI, X-Ray, ultrasound, CT, and PET). Over the past few decades, traditional DI systems have been replaced by computer-assisted ones, enabling entirely filmless operation. However, our investigation reveals that most workstations have security vulnerabilities, such as OpenSSH (CVE-2016-10010), which can lead to unauthorized access.

Standard organizations have published guidelines, such as IEC TR 80001-2-2:2012 [2] and HIMSS/NEMA Standard HN 1-2013 "Manufacturer Disclosure Statement for Medical Device Security" [3], to protect these systems.

### 2.2 DICOM and Its Security Mechanisms
Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) is an international standard for transmitting, storing, retrieving, printing, processing, and displaying medical imaging information. It ensures interoperability and integrates devices from different vendors.

Initially, DICOM did not address information security, relying solely on encryption methods. In its latest edition, it addresses security issues in Part 15 [7], but there is still room for improvement [4].

## 3. Methodology
We designed a checklist based on medical device standards [1] to evaluate different aspects of diagnostic imaging systems, including confidentiality, integrity, availability, auditing, and supplementary requirements. The evaluation covers underlying hardware, operating systems, software, and networks.

### 3.1 Confidentiality
- **Storage Confidentiality**: Manufacturers should provide strong encryption methods and avoid insecure algorithms like DES and RC4.
- **Transmission Confidentiality**: Secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS) and node authentication or white-list mechanisms should be used.
- **Private Data Protection**: De-identification mechanisms should be provided if devices can export imaging data.

### 3.2 Integrity
- **Access Control**: Role-based access control mechanisms should prevent unauthorized access.
- **Authentication**: Safeguards such as passwords, biometrics, and identification cards should be implemented.
- **Auto Logoff**: Devices should enforce logoff after a specified period of inactivity.

### 3.3 Availability
- **Application Availability**: Devices should ensure authorized users can access applications and data.
- **Data Restore**: Data backup and restore mechanisms should be implemented with encryption and validation to prevent data modification and breaches.
- **Emergency Access**: Users should be able to access and store private data in emergency situations.

### 3.4 Auditing
- **Non-repudiation**: Operations on health data should be non-deniable through digital signatures or timestamps.
- **Verifiability**: Health data should contain unique identifiers for tracing.
- **Audit Trail**: Devices should record user operations, including login/off, CRUD actions, data export/import, and transmission.

### 3.5 Supplementary Requirements
- **Physical Safeguard**: Devices should ensure physical security.
- **System Reinforcement**: Techniques such as firewalls, port closures, and purview control should be implemented to prevent privilege promotion and data breaches.

## 4. Results
We tested 15 devices from six major medical device vendors, keeping vendor identities anonymous to protect commercial secrets. The results are summarized in Table 1. "High" indicates that most devices meet the requirements, "Medium" indicates partial compliance, and "Low" indicates that most devices do not meet the requirements.

Generally, most devices only implement basic security mechanisms and need significant improvements. There is a clear gap between academic research and industrial practices. While many studies have focused on encrypting health data, most devices still face the risk of data exposure. Vendors often overlook these risks. In terms of integrity, most devices comply with the requirements, but some specific features like auto-logoff and data restore are vulnerable. Auditing is also a concern, as digital signatures are not widely applied, and verifiability mechanisms are lacking.

## 5. Conclusion and Future Directions
Our survey highlights that diagnostic imaging systems are at significant security risk. Most systems store patient demographic information without adequate security measures to ensure data confidentiality, availability, and integrity. We recommend further research into health data-oriented encryption approaches, differential privacy methods, and more flexible and secure access control mechanisms. Additionally, system security should be prioritized, as malware and vulnerabilities remain critical issues in diagnostic imaging systems.
