User: Suppose you are an operation and maintenance engineer of an Internet company. Recently, the company's main website has experienced a surge in visits, but the performance of the server has not improved significantly, and even the service is unavailable due to excessive load. Please provide an optimization to resolve this issue.
Assistant: 1. Optimize the database 1. Database index optimization: add indexes for frequently queried fields to speed up the query. 2. Database sub-table: sub-table for large tables, reduce the amount of data in a single table, and improve query efficiency. 3. Write appropriate SQL statements: Use the most effective SQL statements to query the database, thereby reducing unnecessary query overhead and improving query efficiency. 2. Optimize the web server 1. NGINX cache optimization: Use the nginx reverse proxy cache mechanism to cache the same page in memory to reduce the number of page requests. 2. Reduce HTTP requests: Combine multiple small pictures into one big picture, and use CSS sprite technology. 3. Compress files: Use gzip to reduce the size of the transfer and speed up page loading. 3. Use a high-performance server 1. Use a high-performance CPU: choose a multi-core, high-speed CPU to improve the ability to process requests. 2. Memory adjustment: adjust the server memory so that it can carry more threads and processes, and improve the ability to process requests. 3. RAID configuration: Use RAID auxiliary storage device to improve read and write speed and increase hard disk fault tolerance. 4. Use a load balancing cluster 1. Use a load balancer: Use a load balancer to distribute traffic to multiple servers to increase the operating capacity of the server. 2. Cluster configuration: use the cluster configuration to complete the rapid expansion of the server, so that the system can dynamically expand the capacity on demand. V. Cache optimization 1. Use local cache: cache data in the local cache, reducing dependence on remote servers. 2. Use remote cache: Use efficient remote cache such as Redis to reduce database IO operations and improve server performance. 3. Static page caching: Use the caching mechanism to cache static pages in memory to quickly respond to user access requests. 6. Enabling CDN Enabling CDN can accelerate the speed of users' access to static resources, and at the same time reduce the traffic pressure and load pressure on the back-end server. 7. Monitoring and diagnosis 1. Establish a monitoring platform: establish a comprehensive operation and maintenance monitoring platform to detect and deal with faults in time to avoid service unavailability. 2. Log analysis: analyze the website logs, find out the page and logic where the problem occurs, and optimize the bottleneck. The above are some optimization schemes, which ultimately need to be implemented according to the actual situation.
