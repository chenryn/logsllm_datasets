### Overview

#### What Does It Do?
Our sleep lab is designed to collect data for later interpretation. The primary data collection includes:

- **Electroencephalogram (EEG)**: To monitor brain activity.
- **Heart Rate Monitor (HRM)**: To track the user's heart rate.
- **Electronic Ocular Monitor (EOM)**: To detect eye movements.
- **Infrared Camera**: To capture visual data in low-light conditions.

#### What Does It Not Do?
- **Breathing Measurements**
- **Skin Response on Face**

**Why Not?**
Restless leg syndrome and sleep apnea are often obvious to an external observer, making additional sensors for these conditions less critical.

- **Cost**: Less than $200 to build.
- **Availability**: Prebuilt PCBs available.
- **Interface**: Connects to a desktop PC via RS-232 serial port.

#### Microcontroller Data Collection Device
- **Atmel Atmega128**: Used to collect other signals.
- **Interface**: Also connects to a desktop PC via serial port.

#### Infrared Webcam
- **USB Webcam**: Modified to capture only infrared images.

### Sensor Choices

#### EEG
- **ModularEEG from OpenEEG Project**
  - **Cost**: Affordable (less than $200).
  - **Testing**: Well tested since its initial release in 2003.
  - **Prebuilt PCBs**: Available for easier assembly.
  - **Purpose**: Essential for detecting different stages of sleep.

#### Heart Rate Monitor
- **Wireless Heart Rate Monitor by Oregon Scientific**
  - **Cost**: Super cheap (less than $20 on eBay).
  - **Signal**: Relatively simple to interpret.
  - **Purpose**: Verifies that the monitored user is calm.

#### Electronic Ocular Monitor (EOM)
- **Fairchild QRB1134**
  - **Cost**: Very cheap.
  - **Documentation**: Well-documented.
  - **Simplicity**: Easy to use.
  - **Purpose**: Verifies Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep.

### Construction Tips and Pitfalls

#### ModularEEG
- **Recommendation**: Buy it preassembled!
- **Pitfalls**:
  - Hours of cramped soldering.
  - Risk of creating solder bridges or short circuits to the ground plane.
  - Easy to place ICs backwards.
  - No included power supply.

#### Construction Highlights
- **On-the-Fly Construction**:
  - Op-amp to boost HRM signal from 1Vpp to 5Vpp.
  - First-order filters to remove noise from incoming circuits.
  - Creative uses for soldering irons.

### Initial Data

#### Testing and Verification
- **EEG**: Successfully captured data when the subject was asked about their favorite topic.
- **HRM and EOM**: Verified to be working correctly.

#### Disclaimer
- **Safety Warning**: We are not medical professionals. There is a rare but possible risk of electric shock with this equipment.
- **Warranty**: No explicit or implied warranty. We are not responsible for any consequences of attempting to duplicate our efforts.

#### Data Analysis
- **EEG and EOM**: Can verify that the user is entering all stages of sleep.
- **Camera Stills**: Show fitful sleep, sleepwalking, and restless leg.
- **Heart Rate**: Elevated heart rate can indicate stress.

#### Future Expansion
- **Additional Sensors**:
  - Muscle sensors on the face.
  - Volume and temperature of airflow to/from the lungs.
- **Data Processing**:
  - Automatic identification and categorization of data.
