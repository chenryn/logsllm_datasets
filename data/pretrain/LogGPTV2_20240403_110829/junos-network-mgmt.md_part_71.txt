### Preparing for Ethernet Tests and Script Execution

Before running the Ethernet tests and scripts, complete the following tasks:

1. **Externally Loop Back All Ethernet Connections (QSFP) on the QFX-PFA-4Q Module:**
   - Attach copper loopback modules to the four QSFP+ interfaces (ports 10 through port 13) installed on the QFX5100-24Q-AA switch.
   - Attach copper loopback modules to the four QSFP+ interfaces installed on the QFX-PFA-4Q module.

2. **Channelize Ports 10 through 13 on the QFX5100-24Q-AA Switch:**
   - Use the Junos CLI to configure ports 10 through 13 on PIC 1 to operate as 10-Gigabit Ethernet ports.
     ```shell
     [edit chassis fpc 0 pic 1]
     user@switch# set port-range 10 13 channel-speed 10g
     ```
   - Review your configuration and issue the commit command.
     ```shell
     [edit]
     user@switch# commit
     commit complete
     ```

3. **Pair Each of the 16 ikonDiag Lanes with the Corresponding Junos OS Interfaces:**
   - Pair each of the 16 ikonDiag lanes using the equivalent Junos OS interface names with the corresponding Junos OS interfaces that were channelized from ports 10 through 13 on the QFX5100-24Q-AA switch.

**Note:** Each VLAN must be independent and contain exactly two associated portsâ€”one 10-Gigabit Ethernet port that is an F-port, and one 10-Gigabit Ethernet port that is an A-port.

   [edit]
   user@switch# commit
   commit complete
   ```

### Stress Tests

The stress tests exercise all high-speed I/Os in parallel. The stress tests require the same external media as you used for the Ethernet tests.

#### Table 93: Stress Tests

| Test Name | Description | Details | Optional Test Sets | Failure Behavior |
|-----------|-------------|---------|--------------------|------------------|
| Stress    | Exercises all high-speed I/Os in parallel, including DRAM, QDR, and Ethernet. | -i (number of iterations, default = 1 for quick-test, 1,000 for burn-in) | varied quick-test, default burn-in | If any one subsystem fails, the test is stopped. The first failed subsystem is reported. If multiple subsystems fail, only the first failed subsystem is reported. |

### PTP Tests

You can run PTP for hardware used with PTP. These tests are helpful if you are creating timing applications. To run the tests, connect SubMiniature version B (SMB) cables, Ethernet loopback cables, and ToD loopback cables for the clocking I/O, ToD serial port, and 1-Gigabit Ethernet connectors. Connect the SMB, Ethernet, and ToD loopback cables between the 10M and PPS output and input connectors. The ToD loopback cable is a standard RJ45 cable with Pin 3 (Tx Data) connected to Pin 6 (Rx Data).

In addition to the PTP tests, you can run scripts included in the Packet Flow Accelerator Diagnostics software to test PTP. See Table 95 for information on the PTP scripts. The PTP scripts require you to have a Junos OS image with Enhanced Automation installed on the QFX5100-24Q-AA switch.

#### Table 94: PTP Tests

| Test Name | Description | Details | Optional Test Sets | Failure Behavior |
|-----------|-------------|---------|--------------------|------------------|
| PTP       | Checks the functionality of various FPGA-attached time-synchronizing features of the QFX-PFA-4Q module. | None. | quick-test, burn-in | A failure in any of the subsystems causes the entire test to fail and generates a report at the end of the test that indicates the pass and fail status of the sub-tests. |

#### Table 95: PTP Script

| Script Name | Description | Details | Optional Test Sets | Failure Behavior |
|-------------|-------------|---------|--------------------|------------------|
| ./run_ptp_test | Checks the functionality of various FPGA-attached time-synchronizing features of the QFX-PFA-4Q module. | None. | None. | A failure in any of the subsystems causes the entire test to fail and generates a report at the end of the test that indicates the pass and fail status of the sub-tests. This script must be run manually. |

### QFX-PFA-4Q Module LED Tests

The LED tests examine the LEDs on the QFX-PFA-4Q module.

To run the LED test, issue the `ikon_led_toggle` command. The test might take a few seconds to start because the FPGA is being configured. When you see the message "Toggling LEDs. Send SIGINT (^C) to exit," the test begins. To terminate the test, type `Ctrl-C`.

#### Table 96: QFX-PFA-4Q Module LED Test

| Test Name | Description | Details | Optional Test Sets | Failure Behavior |
|-----------|-------------|---------|--------------------|------------------|
| ikon_led_toggle | Flashes the LEDs on the QFX-PFA-4Q module for visual inspection. | The following LEDs on the QFX-PFA-4Q module will repeatedly cycle through the following patterns: - The sixteen bicolor LEDs for QSFP status cycle through green, orange, and off. - S0 and S1 LEDs cycle through green and off. - Bottom-left RJ-45 PTP status LED cycles through green, orange, and off. - Bottom-right RJ-45 PTP status LED cycles through green and off rapidly. - Alarm LEDs cycle through orange, red, and off. | None. | This test must be run manually. LEDs might not flash. |

### Packet Flow Accelerator Diagnostics Utilities

In addition to the Packet Flow Accelerator Diagnostic software tests, there are utilities included in the Packet Flow Accelerator Diagnostics software that you can use to further diagnose issues on the QFX-PFA-4Q module.

**Note:** Before you can run the utilities, you need to connect to the console of the guest VM. For more information on how to access the guest VM, see [No Link Title].

#### Table 97: Utilities

| Test Name | Descriptions | Details | Expected Output and Behavior |
|-----------|--------------|---------|------------------------------|
| maxtop    | Reports FPGA status. Displays information about the currently configured status of the FPGA module and whether the module is in operation. Checks to make sure very basic driver and FPGA PCI Express link operations are working correctly. | If this utility exits with errors, it is very unlikely that any further FPGA operations will work. | Output should be similar to the following. If this output is not shown, there might be a critical failure in the diagnostic software environment, or the PCI Express link to the FPGA is nonfunctional. <pre>MaxTop Tool 2015.1 Found 1 card(s) running MaxelerOS 2015.1 Card 0: QFX-PFA-4Q (P/N: 241124) S/N: 96362301684266423 Mem: 24GB Load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00 DFE %BUSY TEMP MAXFILE PID USER TIME COMMAND 0 0.0% - 2fcf249cc7... - - - -</pre> |
| ikon_snake | Enables snake connectivity between all 10-Gigabit Ethernet channels. Connects the Rx channel of all 32 x 10-Gigabit Ethernet channels on the FPGA module (QSFP interfaces) to the Tx channel of the respective neighboring connection. This allows all 32 channels to be tested using just a 10-Gigabit Ethernet interface, external packet generator, copper loopback modules, and a QSFP 4xSFP breakout cable. | After issuing this test, all data will be forwarded after the message "Snake tool loaded. hit 'enter' to exit" is displayed. During the time before the operating message is printed, the FPGA module might be in the process of being configured, so no data is forwarded. Pressing 'enter' will exit the utility. After the test has finished, packet data continues to be forwarded until another Ethernet utility or test is run. | None. |
| ikon_eth_util all --digitalloopback | Enables digital-loopback on all 10-Gigabit Ethernet interfaces on the QFX-PFA-4Q module. Connects the Rx side of all 32x 10-Gigabit Ethernet channels on the FPGA module (QSFP) to the Tx side of the same channel. | After issuing this test, all data will be forwarded as described after the message "running press return key to exit" is displayed. Before the operating message is displayed, the FPGA module might be in the process of being configured, and no data will be forwarded. Pressing Enter exits the utility. After the test has finished, packet data continues to be forwarded until another Ethernet utility or test is run. | None. |
| ikon_eth_util | Enables data to pass through QFX-PFA-4Q module QSFP ports. Allows data to pass through the QFX-PFA-4Q module QSFP ports on the QFX-PFA-4Q module. | Because all of the QSFP ports are channelized to 10-Gigabit Ethernet, you must use SFP breakout cables when connecting external media. | After issuing this test, all data is forwarded as described after the message "running press return key to exit" is displayed. Before the operating message is displayed, the FPGA module might be in the process of being configured, and no data will be forwarded. Pressing Enter exits the utility. After the test has finished, packet data continues to be forwarded until another Ethernet utility or test is run. | None. |
