Before you can run the Ethernet tests and script successfully, you need to perform the following tasks:
• Externally loop back all of the Ethernet connections (QSFP) on the QFX-PFA-4Q module.
To loop back the QSFP interfaces on the QFX-PFA-4Q module, attach copper loopback modules on
the four QSFP+ interfaces installed on the QFX-PFA-4Q module.
Attach copper loopback modules on the QSFP+ interfaces (ports 10 through port 13) installed on the
QFX5100-24Q-AA switch.
• Channelize ports 10 through 13 on the QFX5100-24Q-AA switch.
• Pair each of the 16 ikonDiag lanes using the equivalent Junos OS interface names with each of the
corresponding Junos OS interfaces that were channelized from ports 10 through 13 on the
QFX5100-24Q-AA switch.
NOTE: Each VLAN must be independent contain exactly two associated ports—one 10-
Gigabit Ethernet port that is an F-port, and one 10-Gigabit Ethernet port that is an A-port.
Table 90 on page 871 shows the mappings for the 10-Gigabit Ethernet channels on the QFX-
PFA-4Q module F-ports.

Stress Tests
The stress tests exercise all high-speed I/Os in parallel. The stress tests require the same external media
as you used for the Ethernet tests.Table 93 on page 876 lists the name of the test and its functions.

PTP Tests
You can run PTP for hardware used with PTP. These tests are helpful if you are creating timing
applications. To run the tests, you need to connect SubMiniature version B (SMB) cables, Ethernet
loopback cables, and ToD loopback cables for the clocking I/O, ToD serial port, and 1-Gigabit Ethernet
connectors. You must connect the SMB, Ethernet, ToD loopback cables between the 10M and PPS
output and input connectors. The ToD loopback cable is a standard RJ45 cable with Pin 3 (Tx Data)
877
connected to Pin 6 (Rx Data). In addition to the PTP tests, you can run scripts included the Packet Flow
Accelerator Diagnostics software to test PTP. See Table 95 on page 878 for information on the PTP
scripts. The PTP scripts require you to have a Junos OS image with Enhanced Automation installed on
the QFX5100-24Q-AA switch. For information on how to install the scripts, see No Link Title.
Table 94 on page 877 lists the names of the PTP tests and their functions:

QFX-PFA-4Q Module LED Tests
The LED tests examine the LEDs on the QFX-PFA-4Q module.
To run the LED test, issue the ikon_led_toggle command. The test might take a few seconds to start
because the FPGA is being configured. When you see the message Toggling LEDs. Send SIGINT (^C) to exit,
the test begins. To terminate the test, type Ctrl-C. Table 96 on page 879 lists the name of the test and
its function.

Packet Flow Accelerator Diagnostics Utilities
In addition to the Packet Flow Accelerator Diagnostic software tests, there are utilities included in the
Packet Flow Accelerator Diagnostics software that you can use to further diagnose issues on the QFX-
PFA-4Q module.
NOTE: Before you can run the utilities, you need to connect to the console of the guest VM. For
more information on how to access the guest VM, see No Link Title.
