##### Issue Type:
Bug Report
##### Ansible Version:
1.6.2
##### Environment:
Ansible running on Fedora 20. EC2 API is the target.
##### Summary:
If you have a wide open security rule for a group (-1 for proto, from_port and
to_port with a cidr of 0.0.0.0/0) it can only be run once. Subsequent run will
fail.
##### Steps To Reproduce:
I have the following as part of a playbook that makes sure we have the  
appropriate security groups setup and all of them work just fine  
except this one:
    - name: Create wide-open testing security group
      local_action:
        module: ec2_group
        name: 'WIDE OPEN'
        description: 'WIDE OPEN for TESTING ONLY!'
        vpc_id: "{{ vpc_id }}"
        region: "{{ aws_region }}"
        state: present
        rules:
          # everything from anywhere
          - proto: -1
            from_port: -1
            to_port: -1
            cidr_ip: 0.0.0.0/0
The first time I run the playbook with this task it works just fine.  
But every time it's run after that it fails. Other rules in other ec2_group
tasks in this same playbook execute as expected when run multiple times.
##### Expected Results:
It should recognize that the rule already exists like it does every other rule
and just skip it.
##### Actual Results:
It fails with the following error:
    failed: [localhost] => {"failed": true, "parsed": false}
