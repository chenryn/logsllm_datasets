ABSTRACT
With the booming deployment of smart homes, concerns about user
privacy keep growing. Recent research has shown that encrypted
wireless traffic of IoT devices can be exploited by packet-sniffing
attacks to reveal users’ privacy-sensitive information (e.g., the time
when residents leave their home and go to work), which may be
used to launch further attacks (e.g., a break-in). To address the grow-
ing concerns, we propose SniffMislead, a non-intrusive (i.e., with-
out modifying IoT devices, hubs, or platforms) privacy-protecting
approach, based on packet injection, against wireless packet sniffers.
Instead of randomly injecting packets, which is ineffective against
a smarter attacker, SniffMislead proposes the notion of phantom
users, “people” who do not exist in the physical world. From an
attacker’s perspective, however, they are perceived as real users.
SniffMislead places multiple phantom users in a smart home,
which can effectively prevent an attacker from inferring useful in-
formation. We design a top-down approach to synthesize phantom
users’ behaviors, construct the sequence of decoy device events
and commands, and then inject corresponding packets into the
home. We show how SniffMislead ensures logical integrity and
contextual consistency of injected packets, as well as how it makes
a phantom user indistinguishable from a real user. Our evaluation
results from a smart home testbed demonstrate that SniffMislead
significantly reduces an attacker’s privacy-inferring capabilities,
bringing the accuracy from 94.8% down to 3.5%.

1 INTRODUCTION
The development of smart homes is flourishing, as inexpensive IoT
devices become prevalent and IoT integration platforms, such as
SmartThings, Google, and Amazon, emerge to enable interoper-
ability between devices. As IoT devices usually communicate with
hubs or clouds via wireless protocols such as ZigBee, BLE, Z-Wave,
and WiFi, they are prone to wireless packet sniffing attacks.
Although encryption is used to protect wireless communica-
tion, recent works [1, 8, 9, 19, 57, 64, 79] have shown that privacy-
sensitive information, such as device states and user behaviors,
can be inferred from wireless packets. Packets of different IoT
devices and their events and commands tend to show different
patterns, called packet-level signatures [64, 79], from which a wire-
less packet sniffer can infer device types, actions, and states (e.g.,
OPEN/CLOSED of a contact sensor on a door), without knowing the
encryption key. As IoT devices and users become increasingly cou-
pled, it is feasible to infer user behaviors (e.g., the time she leaves
home) [1, 18, 27, 41, 72, 73]. The privacy-sensitive information can
facilitate further attacks, such as breaks-in when no one is home,
crimes targeting users who live alone, selling personal information
to criminals for profits, and blackmail [21, 25]. Such side-channel
attacks are easy to launch, though difficult to detect.

Many countermeasures against these side-channel attacks have
been proposed, which we group into two main categories. The first
includes traffic shaping and packet padding to reduce the traffic
variability among different devices [6, 9, 44, 64, 65, 71]. Counter-
measures in this category suffer from the following limitations:
1) They require modifications of IoT firmware; 2) Changes in pro-
tocols (e.g., number of padding packets) may cause compatibility
issues among IoT devices, hubs, and backend servers; 3) The redun-
dant packets and padding bytes impose significant communication
and energy overheads on resource-constrained IoT devices [9]. The
second category of countermeasures is event spoofing via packet
injection [1, 7, 64], which simulates decoy events of IoT devices to
confuse an attacker from being able to distinguish between real and
decoy events. However, a robust, efficient, and automated method
for event spoofing is still an open research problem [7], especially
since packet injection from IoT devices also requires modifications
to IoT firmware and/or an extension to the protocols by adding a
decoy-event flag [1].
Therefore, one may propose a non-intrusive solution, i.e., with-
out modifying IoT firmware or underlying communication pro-
tocols, by implementing one of the aforementioned countermea-
sure approaches using a stand-alone device. However, this intu-
itive method will not work for the following reasons. First, it is
unknown how a stand-alone device can predict upcoming traffic
and then proactively perform shaping, and it is unlikely to pad en-
crypted packets, using a stand-alone device, without knowing the
session keys. Second, the defense of injecting random packets from
a stand-alone device is weak, as existing traffic analysis is resilient
to noises [1, 39, 40]. Finally, the stand-alone device may purposely
inject traffic to simulate some IoT events in order to fool attackers.
However, for example, if a security defense injects traffic simulating
motion-active events even after users have left their homes, then
based on logical conflicts [7], an attacker can detect they are fake
events, by using either causal relationship analysis [2, 10, 69] or
context and integrity detection [26, 32, 37, 52]. As another exam-
ple, assume the motion sensor regularly triggers light-on events in
the presence of real users. Then based on missing light-on events,
an attacker can infer the motion-active events are fake. Similarly,
assuming a door is unlocked only when a presence sensor has been
reported on, a fake door-unlock event can be easily recognized by
attackers, presuming the presence-on state is false.
We propose a novel and effective defense, called SniffMislead,
against wireless packet sniffers: a non-intrusive and resilient privacy-
protecting solution via packet injection using a stand-alone device,
without modifying IoT devices, hubs, platforms, or communication
protocols, based on the notion of phantom users. Phantom users
do not exist in the physical world but, from the perspective of an
attacker, “live” in a smart home and act as real users would. The
primary challenge is that, when analyzing real-time traffic, phan-
tom users should remain indistinguishable from real users. To that
end, we propose a top-down approach to simulate logically-sound
phantom users by first designing their behaviors. Next, for each
behavior, we construct a sequence of device events and commands
consistent with the home context (e.g., a phantom user should not
lock a door if it is already locked; the phantom user should not turn
off the light if someone is still in the room). Finally, correspond-
ing to each event and command of an IoT device, we inject decoy
packets into the target smart home network.1
Behaviors of phantom users are designed to be as different from
each other (e.g., one phantom user is cooking, and another watching
TV) and involve as many diverse IoT devices as possible at any given
moment, such that attackers are not confident whether an inferred
device state is real or not. Behaviors of phantom users are also
designed to be different from those of real users, so attackers are not
sure whether an inferred user behavior or home state is real or due
to a phantom user. By simulating phantom users, SniffMislead
ensures logical integrity (i.e., decoy device events can correctly
compose behaviors of a phantom user) and contextual consistency
(i.e., a phantom user inside the “multi-user” smart home do not
introduce conflicts) of injected packets and simulated decoy device
events, preventing attackers from making reliable inferences about
device states or behaviors of real users (e.g., the attacker observes
that a user is watching TV, when, in fact, no one is home).
Through this work, we make the following contributions:
• Unlike existing works, SniffMislead is a stand-alone and
non-intrusive countermeasure against wireless packet snif-
fers. It works independently and causes no changes to IoT
devices or the underlying communication protocols. It is a
plug-and-play solution, i.e., requiring no additional configu-
ration efforts from users.
• We propose the notion of phantom users and use a top-down
approach to synthesize their behaviors and inject correspond-
ing packets into the target smart home, ensuring that phan-
tom users remain indistinguishable from real users.
• We build a prototype of SniffMislead and evaluate it in a
real-world smart home. Our results show that SniffMislead
significantly undermines a wireless sniffing attacker’s capa-
bility (from 94.8% to 3.5%) of inferring user behaviors, as he
is unsure whether his inference is coming from a phantom
or real user.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2
outlines related work. Section 3 discusses the threat model we
adopted, our goals, and anticipated design challenges. Section 4
presents the design and workflow of SniffMislead. Section 5 dis-
cusses how to learn the needed information from a smart home.
Section 6 discusses how to inject decoy packets that simulate phan-
tom users. Section 7 presents our experimental setup. Section 8
summarizes our evaluation results. Section 9 addresses limitations
of SniffMislead and discusses potential follow-up studies. The
paper is concluded in Section 10.
2 RELATED WORK
Side-Channel Analysis Based on Sniffed Packets. A growing
body of work uses network traffic side-channel analysis to infer
states of IoT devices. It relies on the limited-purpose nature of IoT
devices, and there is a one-to-one mapping between traffic pat-
terns and device events. A series of papers by Apthorpe et al. [6–9]
use traffic volume-based signatures to infer device events. Home-
Snitch [42] identifies IoT events based on an observation that the

referred to as device events for the rest of this paper.

client (i.e., the IoT device) and server take turns in a request-reply
communication style. HoMonit [79] uses side-channel information
on encrypted wireless packets to monitor the misbehavior of smart
apps. It was found that device events can be inferred using packet
size and direction, which agrees with the observation from Ping-
Pong [64]. To infer sensitive information based on side-channel
information, some methods rely on machine learning [1, 36, 54, 55],
while others use statistical analysis [1, 19, 42, 46].
Existing Defenses. Existing IoT privacy-protection work can be
divided into three main categories: privacy protection against 1)
IoT apps [11, 12, 25, 35, 61, 77], 2) IoT platforms [14, 15, 72], and 3)
traffic sniffers [1, 7, 9, 20]. For example, FlowFence [25] protects
sensitive data from being leaked via IoT apps by enforcing a data
flow control mechanism. PFirewall [15] is a semantics-aware cus-
tomizable data flow control system for smart homes to protect user
privacy from IoT platforms, by filtering and obfuscating data gen-
erated by IoT devices. SniffMislead belongs to the third category.
Several approaches have been proposed to obfuscate network traf-
fic to defend against network traffic side-channel analysis. Packet
padding [23, 44, 71] adds dummy bytes to each packet. Packets can
be padded to a fixed length or with a random number of bytes to
confuse inference methods that rely on individual packet lengths.
Traffic shaping [6, 20, 65] purposely delays packets to a fixed rate.
It can confuse inference methods that rely on packet inter-arrival
times and volume over time. Packet padding and traffic shaping
require changes of IoT firmware/protocols, cause high overhead to
devices; e.g., traffic shaping may delay packets too much, harming
user experience. Traffic injection and event spoofing [1, 7, 64] add
dummy packets or decoy events to make it difficult for an attacker
to distinguish which ones are real. These countermeasures, with-
out a global view of events at the protected home, are ineffective
against advanced methods, such as traffic analysis [1, 39, 40], causal
relationship analysis [2, 10, 69], and context and integrity detec-
tion [26, 32, 37, 52]. Plus, they also require modifications to IoT
firmware and/or an extension to the protocols by adding a decoy-
event flag [1], because they use IoT devices to add dummy packets
or decoy events.
3 THREAT MODEL, GOALS, AND
CHALLENGES
In this section, we first present the threat model, which includes
the smart home environment and attackers that we consider. Next,
we describe the goals and design challenges of SniffMislead.
3.1 Threat Model
As shown in Figure 1, an IoT device uses a wireless connection to
communicate with either a hub or router, both of which are prone
to packet sniffing. We consider a passive attacker similar to recent
works [1, 8, 9, 64], who can remotely control a wireless packet
sniffer (e.g., based on a compromised IoT device), located within
the wireless range of a target smart home, to eavesdrop on wireless
traffic inside the house. The attacker is not physically close to the
home and thus, for instance, cannot see who is entering or leaving
the home; none of existing countermeasures, such as traffic shaping
and packet padding, are able to fool such attackers. SniffMislead

is deployed inside a smart home and injects decoy packets into the
wireless network of the home, to confuse and mislead the attacker.
Attackers’ Capabilities. Major IoT communication protocols, such
as ZigBee [24], Z-Wave [51], and BLE [49], require mandatory en-
cryption. Besides, most WiFi-based IoT devices use encryption. For
example, the survey [5] lists the devices that use encryption in
Table II; among 45 devices evaluated in the paper, only three use
unencrypted wireless communications. Although most wireless
packets of smart home devices are encrypted, traffic metadata (e.g.,
