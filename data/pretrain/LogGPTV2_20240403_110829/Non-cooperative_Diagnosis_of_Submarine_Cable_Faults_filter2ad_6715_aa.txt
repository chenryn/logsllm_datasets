Abstract. Submarine cable faults are not uncommon events in the In-
ternet today. However, their impacts on end-to-end path quality have
received almost no attention. In this paper, we report path-quality mea-
surement results for a recent SEA-ME-WE 4 cable fault in 2010. Our
measurement methodology captures the path-quality degradation due to
the cable fault, in terms of delay, asymmetric packet losses, and correla-
tion between loss and delay. We further leverage traceroute data to infer
the root causes of the performance degradation.
1 Introduction
Submarine cables are critical elements of the Internet today, because they provide
cross-country routes for transoceanic data and voice transmissions. The demand
for high-capacity submarine cables has been increasing for the last few years. For
instance, the recently deployed Trans-Paciﬁc Unity submarine cable system can
transmit data between Japan and the west coast of the United States up to 4.8
Terabits per second (Tbits/s). Dramatic capacity upgrades to the existing Asia-
Europe cable systems and the emergence of ﬁve new submarine cable systems
connecting the Middle East were also reported [11].
Data loss and substantial service interruption as a result of submarine cable
faults conceivably entail huge economic cost. Although submarine cable systems
are protected by various reliability technologies (e.g., [15,16]), they still appear
to be highly vulnerable according to numerous submarine cable faults reported
in recent years (e.g., [1,2,3]). The worst one is the incident of massive cable cuts
due to the Hengchun earthquake in 2006 [1]. Moreover, a submarine cable fault
requires considerable time for tracing the fault location and repairing.
Besides the traﬃc on the faulty submarine cable, the Internet traﬃc that
is not carried by the faulty cables can also be aﬀected. A common quick-ﬁx
strategy for restoring the disrupted communication is to reroute the aﬀected
traﬃc to other submarine/terrestrial/satellite links. However, the side eﬀect of
such ad hoc traﬃc rerouting mechanism is introducing a high volume of traﬃc,
and therefore substantial congestion, to the backup paths. However, the impact
of submarine cable faults on the global Internet connectivity has not received
attention from the research community. Therefore, very little is known about

the Internet’s vulnerability to the faults in terms of path-quality degradation,
congestion on the backup paths, and speed of network recovery.
In this paper, we report the impacts of a recent SEA-ME-WE 4 cable fault
incident [2] measured from our neighbor-cooperative measurement system [14].
In this system, a number of coordinated measurement nodes persistently monitor
the performance of network paths to a set of web servers. The impacts of the cable
fault are observed from the degradation in the path quality. To infer the root
cause of the degradation, we leverage the forward-path Tcptraceroute gleaned
from the measurement nodes to study the IP-level/AS-level route changes. Based
on this dataset, we analyze how submarine cable faults aﬀected the routes used
by the network paths and the performance of these paths. We also evaluate the
eﬀectiveness of network operators’ responses to the incident.
The paper is organized as follows. We ﬁrst introduce our measurement
methodology in §2. We then present our measurement ﬁndings on the impacts
of the SEA-ME-WE 4 cable fault in §3. After discussing the related works in §4,
we conclude the paper with future works in §5.
2 Measurement Methodology
2.1 Measurement Setup
We have been conducting end-to-end Internet path measurement from eight
Hong Kong universities, labeled by UA–UH, since 1 January 2009. A mea-
surement node is installed just behind the border router of each university to
measure network paths to 44 non-cooperative web servers (without requiring
software setup on the servers) in Hong Kong, Australia, China, Finland, France,
Germany, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the
United States. We use HTTP/OneProbe [17] for data-path quality measurement
and Tcptraceroute for forward-path tracing. Our measurement produces 12-GB
measurement data daily.
2.2 Measurement Scheduling and Traﬃc
To obtain comparable results, all the eight measurement nodes measure the
same web server around the same time. We employ several measures to avoid
congestion introduced by the measurement traﬃc. In particular, we divide the set
of web servers into ﬁve groups and measure the groups in a round-robin fashion.
The nodes launch HTTP/OneProbe to measure each group for one minute and
then perform Tcptraceroute with the default conﬁguration to the same group
for another minute. For each path, HTTP/OneProbe dispatches a sequence of
Poisson-modulated probe pairs to each web server with a probing frequency of
2 Hz and an IP packet size of 576 bytes, and each probe pair elicits at most
two 576-byte response packets from the server. Therefore, the aggregated probe
traﬃc sent to each server is less than 200 Kbits/s. Moreover, we use separate
network interfaces for conducting the measurement and receiving the data.

2.3 Metrics
Routing metrics. To evaluate the routing behavior as a consequence of subma-
rine cable faults, we continuously measure both IP routes and the corresponding
AS routes (by resolving IP hops into AS numbers) from the measurement nodes
to the web servers. To quantify the IP-level route changes, we resort to the IP-
level Jaccard distance deﬁned in Eqn. (1) to measure the diﬀerence of a route
measured at times i − 1 and i, which are denoted by Ri−1 and Ri. The Jaccard
distance is computed by the number of dissimilar elements divided by the total
number of distinct elements in Ri−1 and Ri. Therefore, the IP-level Jaccard dis-
tance is zero for two identical IP routes, and one for two completely diﬀerent IP
routes. We similarly compute an AS-level Jaccard distance for AS routes based
on Eqn. (1) to analyze the AS-level route changes.
Jδ(Ri−1, Ri) = 1 − |Ri−1 ∩ Ri|
|Ri−1 ∪ Ri| .
(1)
Using Jaccard distance to characterize route changes is not new. Pathak et
al. [18], for example, studied the AS routing asymmetry by computing the Jac-
card similarity index between forward-path and reverse-path AS routes. Schwartz
et al. [19] used the Levenshtein distance to quantify the diﬀerence between the
dominant route and other non-dominant routes for a pair of source and destina-
tion. Since reordering of elements in the IP/AS routes after route changes is rare
in our dataset, we simply use Jaccard distance which does not take into account
the order of elements in each route, whereas the Levenshtein distance does.
Path performance metrics. We employ HTTP/OneProbe to measure TCP
data-path performance for each path between measurement node and web server.
HTTP/OneProbe uses legitimate TCP data probe and response packets to mea-
sure RTTs and detect one-way (i.e., forward-path and reverse-path) packet
losses. To evaluate the paths’ congestion status, we also apply the loss-pair anal-
ysis [13] to correlate the one-way packet losses with the RTTs. Moreover, we
correlate the route change metrics with the path performance metrics to analyze
path-quality degradation due to submarine cable faults.
3 The SEA-ME-WE 4 Cable Fault
The South East Asia-Middle East-Western Europe 4 (SEA-ME-WE 4) subma-
rine cable [8] is a major Internet backbone connecting Southeast Asia, the Indian
subcontinent, the Middle East, and Europe. It involves 17 landing points and car-
ries Internet traﬃc among 15 countries, including Egypt, France, India, Saudi
Arabia, and Singapore. The SEA-ME-WE 4 cable has a data rate up to 1.28
Tbits/s [4] and is owned by a consortium of 16 companies, including the Tata
Communications (or TATA).
The SEA-ME-WE 4 cable encountered a shunt fault on the segment between
Alexandria and Marseille on 14 April 2010 [2,9], but the exact time was not
reported. The shunt fault was caused by a short circuit when the submarine

cable, whose insulation was damaged, came into contact with the sea water.
Since the cable was not severed, it was still operable with limited capacity. The
cable fault aﬀected a number of countries whose global connectivity relied on
the SEA-ME-WE 4 cable (e.g., [2,12]). The repair was started on 25 April 2010,
and it took four days to complete [2]. During the repair, the service for the
westbound traﬃc to Europe was not available.
3.1 Impacts of the Cable Fault
Fig. 1 shows the time series of the average IP-level and AS-level Jaccard distances
for the paths from UA–UH to two web servers (BBC and ENG3) in the United
Kingdom and one web server (NOKIA) in Finland between 1 April 2010 0:00
and 8 May 2010 0:00 GMT, inclusively. As Fig. 1(a) shows, the IP-level Jaccard
distance for the paths overlapped with one another at the beginning and then
gradually declined starting from 14 April that coincides with the date of the cable
fault incident. The BBC’s Jaccard distance dropped to zero with intermittent
surges after 16 April 7:30 GMT, whereas the ENG3’s and NOKIA’s distances
ﬂuctuated between 0.05 and 0.22, and experienced another drop on 5 May noon
GMT. Moreover, Fig. 1(b) shows some signiﬁcant AS-level route changes.
To probe deeper into how the paths to BBC, ENG3, and NOKIA evolved after
the cable fault, we zoom into an episode e1 which spans between 13 April 0:00
and 17 April 8:00 GMT in Fig. 1(a). Fig. 2(a) shows that their average IP-level
Jaccard distances during e1 exhibit staircase decreasing patterns, meaning that
the paths became more similar after the cable fault. We can also distinguish at

most four distinct phases labeled with (a)–(d) for the NOKIA, ENG3, and BBC
paths which have two, three, and four phases, respectively.
A traceroute analysis reveals the subpaths corresponding to the four phases
shown in Fig. 3. To generate the ﬁgures, we resolved the IP hops’ locations based
on their DNS names and grouped all the hops with the same location together.
The node labeled with “Unresolved” is located in Hong Kong, and we could not
resolve its DNS name. Phases (a)-(c) apply to all three web servers, and all the
routes went through the London IX (LINX) via the FLAG network (AS15412).
On the other hand, phases (d)-(e) apply only to the BBC paths, and TATA was
the carrier. We will discuss phase (e) in the next section.
Phases (a) and (b). Fig. 3(a) shows three subpaths inside the FLAG network
in phase (a). Upon the onset of phase (b) on 14 April 7:00 GMT (the same day
of the reported cable fault), the IP-level Jaccard distance started declining, a
result of the missing subpath via Mumbai as shown in Fig. 3(b). We also plot
the RTT time series in Fig. 2(b) for the path between UB and BBC (denoted
as UB(cid:2)BBC). The ﬁgure includes the RTTs obtained from P01s and R01s
which are the respective loss pairs on UB → BBC (forward path) and BBC →
UB (reverse path). A P01 (R01) is a packet pair in which only the ﬁrst probe
