### Additional Information
- This year, Brazil did not observe daylight saving time (DST). Previously, from October to February, Brazil was -2 UTC. However, this year, it is -3 UTC.
- This issue only occurs when running the application in Electron. When opening the same code in a web browser, the behavior is as expected.
