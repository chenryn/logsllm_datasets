Assistant: This log chunk shows the process of running tasks in stage 27.0. The storage.BlockManager found blocks rdd_42_26, rdd_42_27, rdd_42_28, and rdd_42_29 locally. The executor.CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend assigned tasks 1267, 1268, 1269, and 1270. The executor.Executor ran tasks 27.0, 28.0, 29.0, and 30.0 in stage 27.0. The python.PythonRunner reported times for each task. Finally, the executor.Executor finished tasks 26.0, 25.0, 27.0, and 28.0 in stage 27.0 and sent the results to the driver.
