User: I want a script to start a new process, such that the new process continues running after the initial script exits. I expected that I could use multiprocessing.Process to start a new process, and set daemon=True so that the main script may exit while the created process continues running. 
But it seems that the second process is silently terminated when the main script exits. Is this expected behavior, or am I doing something wrong?
Assistant: From the Python docs:

When a process exits, it attempts to
  terminate all of its daemonic child
  processes.

This is the expected behavior.
