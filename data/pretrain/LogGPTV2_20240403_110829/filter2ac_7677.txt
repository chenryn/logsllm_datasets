titleblackhat:asia-23 Forward Focus â€“ The Impact of Artificial Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize cybersecurity by enhancing detection and response capabilities, automating routine tasks, and identifying threats that are invisible to humans. However, AI also poses significant risks, including the potential for attackers to use AI to develop more sophisticated attacks and evade detection. Panelist will explore how AI can be used to improve cybersecurity, the ethical considerations of using AI in security, and how to manage the risks associated with AI-powered security systems. Additionally, the panel will discuss the future of AI and cybersecurity and the role the InfoSec community and policymakers can have in shaping the development and use of AI in security.
