ABSTRACT
Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have been widely
deployed in modern smart devices to provide convenient and di-
verse voice-controlled services. Since ASR systems are vulnerable
to audio replay attacks that can spoof and mislead ASR systems, a
number of defense systems have been proposed to identify replayed
audio signals based on the speakers’ unique acoustic features in the
frequency domain. In this paper, we uncover a new type of replay
attack called modulated replay attack, which can bypass the existing
frequency domain based defense systems. The basic idea is to com-
pensate for the frequency distortion of a given electronic speaker
using an inverse filter that is customized to the speaker’s transform
characteristics. Our experiments on real smart devices confirm the
modulated replay attacks can successfully escape the existing detec-
tion mechanisms that rely on identifying suspicious features in the
frequency domain. To defeat modulated replay attacks, we design
and implement a countermeasure named DualGuard. We discover
and formally prove that no matter how the replay audio signals
could be modulated, the replay attacks will either leave ringing
artifacts in the time domain or cause spectrum distortion in the fre-
quency domain. Therefore, by jointly checking suspicious features
in both frequency and time domains, DualGuard can successfully
detect various replay attacks including the modulated replay at-
tacks. We implement a prototype of DualGuard on a popular voice
interactive platform, ReSpeaker Core v2. The experimental results
show DualGuard can achieve 98% accuracy on detecting modulated
replay attacks.

1 INTRODUCTION
Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has been a ubiquitous tech-
nique widely used in human-computer interaction systems, such
as Google Assistant [5], Amazon Alexa [4], Apple Siri [52], Face-
book Portal [45], and Microsoft Cortana [14]. With advanced ASR
techniques, these systems take voice commands as inputs and act
on them to provide diverse voice-controlled services. People now
can directly use voice to unlock mobile phone [20, 39], send private
messages [2], log in to mobile apps [6], make online payments [48],
activate smart home devices [51], and unlock a car door [36].
Although ASR provides many benefits and conveniences, recent
studies have found a number of attacks that can effectively spoof
and mislead ASR systems [8, 11, 29, 31, 38, 47, 49, 53, 70, 71, 74, 75].
One of the most powerful and practical attacks is the audio replay at-
tack [8, 29, 38], where a pre-recorded voice sample collected from a
genuine victim is played back to spoof ASR systems. Consequently,
it can easily bypass voice authentication and inject voice commands
to conduct malicious activities [25]. For example, a mobile device
can be unlocked by simply replaying a pre-recorded voice com-
mand of its owner [29]. Even worse, the audio replay attack can be
easily launched by anyone without specific knowledge in speech
processing or other computer techniques. Also, the prevalence of
portable recording devices, especially smartphones, makes audio
replay attacks one of the most practical threats to ASR systems.
To defeat audio replay attacks, researchers have proposed a num-
ber of mechanisms to detect abnormal frequency features of audio
signals, such as Linear Prediction Cepstral Coefficient (LPCC) [33],
Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) [68], Constant Q Cep-
stral Coefficients (CQCC) [56], and Mel Wavelet Packet Coeffi-
cients (MWPC) [42]. A recent study [65] shows that the amplitude-
frequency characteristics in a high-frequency sub-band will change
significantly under the replay attack, and thus they can be leveraged
to detect the attack. Another study [8] discovers that the signal
energy in the low-frequency sub-bands can also be leveraged to dis-
tinguish if the voice comes from a human or an electronic speaker.
Moreover, due to the degraded amplitude components caused by
the replay noise, the frequency modulation features [21, 28, 55]
can be leveraged into detection. Overall, existing countermeasures
are effective on detecting all known replay attacks by checking
suspicious features in the frequency domain.
In this paper, we present a new replay attack named modulated re-
play attack, which can generate replay audios with almost the same
frequency spectrum as human voices to bypass the existing coun-
termeasures. Inspired by the loudspeaker equalization techniques
in auditory research that targets at improving the sound effect of
an audio system [13], the core idea of modulated replay attack is to
compensate for the differences in the frequency domain between
replay audios and human voices. Through a measurement study on
ASR systems, we find the differences in the frequency domain are
caused by the playback electronic speakers, which typically have
a non-flat frequency response with non-regular oscillations in the
passband. In reality, an speaker can hardly output all frequencies
with equal power due to its mechanical design and the crossover
nature if the speaker possesses more than one driver [10]. Thus,
when the genuine human audio is replayed, electronic speakers ex-
ert different spectral gains on the frequency spectrum of the replay
audio, leading to different distortion degrees. Typically, electronic
speakers suppress the low-frequency components and enhance the
high-frequency components of the genuine human audio.
By evaluating the transfer characteristic of electronic speakers,
we are able to customize a pre-processing inverse filter for any
given speaker. By applying the inverse filter before replaying the
human audio, the spectral effects caused by the speaker devices can
be offset. Consequently, the attacker can produce spoofed audios
that are difficult to be distinguished from real human voices in the
frequency domain. We conduct experiments to demonstrate the
feasibility and effectiveness of the modulated replay attack against
8 existing replay detection mechanisms using 6 real speaker devices.
The experimental results show that the detection accuracy of most
frequency-based countermeasure significantly drops from above
90% to around 10% under our attack, and even the best countermea-
sure using MWPC [42] drops from above 97% to around 50%. One
major reason is that modulated replay attack is a new type of attack
that leverages loudspeaker frequency response compensation.
To defeat the modulated replay attack as well as classical replay
attacks, we propose a new dual-domain defense method named Du-
alGuard that cross-checks suspicious features in both time domain
and frequency domain, which is another major contribution in this
paper. The key insight of our defense is that it is inevitable for
any replay attacks to either leave ringing artifacts [63] in the time
domain or cause spectrum distortion in the frequency domain, even
if the replay audio signals have been modulated. We formally prove
the correctness and universality of our key insight. In the time
domain, ringing artifacts will cause spurious oscillations, which
generate a large number of local extreme points in replay audio
waveforms. DualGuard extracts and leverages those local extrema
patterns to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier that
distinguishes modulated replay attacks from human voices. In the
frequency domain, spectrum distortion will generate dramatically
different power spectrum distributions compared to human voices.
Also, DualGuard applies the area under the CDF curve (AUC) of
power spectrum distributions to filter out classical replay attacks.
Therefore, DualGuard can effectively identify replay audio by per-
forming the checks in two domains.
In summary, our paper makes the following contributions:
We implement a prototype of DualGuard on a voice interactive
platform, ReSpeaker Core v2 [57]. We conduct extensive experi-
ments to evaluate its effectiveness and performance on detecting
replay attacks. The experimental results show that DualGuard can
achieve about 98% detection accuracy against the modulated replay
attack and over 90% detection accuracy against classical replay
attacks. Moreover, we show that DualGuard works well under dif-
ferent noisy environments. Particularly, the detection accuracy only
decreases by 3.2% on average even with a bad signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) of 40 dB. DualGuard is lightweight and can be deployed to
work online in real ASR systems. For example, our testbed platform
takes 5.5 𝑚𝑠 on average to process a signal segment of 32 𝑚𝑠 length
using 24.2% CPU and 12.05 MB memory.
• We propose a new modulated replay attack against ASR systems,
utilizing a specific software-based inverse filter to offset suspi-
cious features in the frequency domain. By compensating the
electronic speaker’s non-flat frequency response in the passband,
modulated replay attacks can bypass existing replay detection
mechanisms.
• We design a novel defense system named DualGuard to detect all
replay attacks including the modulated replay attacks by check-
ing suspicious features in both frequency domain and time do-
main. We formally prove that replay attacks cannot escape from
being detected in both time and frequency domains.
• We verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the modulated re-
play attack through real experiments using multiple speaker
devices over existing replay detection mechanisms. We also im-
plement a prototype of DualGuard on a popular voice platform
and demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency in detecting all
replay attacks.
2 BACKGROUND
In this section, we introduce necessary background information on
audio signal processing, ASR systems, and replay attacks.
2.1 Audio Signal Processing
As there are so many technical terms on voice signal processing, we
only briefly introduce two necessary terms that are tightly related
to our work.
Signal Frequency Spectrum. Generally, a signal is represented
as a time-domain form 𝑥(𝑡), recording the signal amplitude at each
time point. Frequency spectrum is another signal representation,
providing a way to analyze the signal in the frequency domain.
Fourier analysis [50] can decompose a time-domain signal as the
sum of multiple sinusoidal signals of different frequencies, i.e.,
𝑥(𝑡) =𝑛 𝐴𝑛 · sin (2𝜋 𝑓𝑛𝑡 + 𝜙𝑛). The 𝑛-th sinusoidal signal is called
the frequency component with a frequency value of 𝑓𝑛. The set
of {𝐴𝑛} is called the amplitude spectrum that represents the am-
plitude of each frequency component. {𝜙𝑛} is the phase spectrum
recording the phase of each component. The frequency spectrum
of a signal is the combination of amplitude and phase spectrum.
Frequency Response. Frequency response represents the output
frequency and phase spectrum of a system or a device in response
to a stimulus signal [46]. When a stimulus signal that is typically
a single-frequency sine wave passes through a system, the ratio
of the output to input amplitude (i.e., signal gain) varies with the
Figure 1: ASR Systems.
input frequency of the stimulus signal. The amplitude response of
the system represents the signal gains at all frequencies. Hence, the
output amplitude spectrum of a signal is the product of the input
amplitude spectrum and the amplitude response of the system. A
system is a high-pass (low-pass) filter if the system has a higher am-
plitude response in the high-frequency (low-frequency) range. The
phase response of a system represents the phase shifts of different
frequency signals passing through the system.
2.2 ASR Systems and Replay Attacks
Figure 1 shows an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system. A
recording device such as a microphone captures the audio signals
from the air and converts the acoustic vibrations into electrical
signals. Then, the analog electrical signals are converted to digital
signals for signal processing. The processed digital signals are used
for speech recognition or speaker identification in the subsequent
processing of the ASR systems. These digital signals are commonly
referred to as the genuine audio if the signals are directly collected
from the live human speakers.
ASR systems are vulnerable to replay attacks. The classical replay
attack model contains four basic components, i.e., a recording de-
vice, an analog-to-digital (A/D) converter, a digital-to-analog (D/A)
converter, and a playback device such as a loudspeaker. Compared
with the normal speech recognition steps in the ASR systems, the
replay attack contains a replay process as shown in Figure 2(a). The
attacker firstly collects the genuine human voice using a recording
device and converts the voice to a digital signal by an A/D con-
verter. The digital signal can be stored in a disk device as a lossless
compression format or be spread through the Internet. After that,
the attacker playbacks the digital signal near the targeted ASR sys-
tem, which spoofs the system to provide expected services. In the
playback process, the stored digital signal is converted to an analog
electric signal by a D/A converter. Then, the electric signal will be
played as an acoustic wave by a playback device.
3 MODULATED REPLAY ATTACKS
In this section, we propose a new attack called modulated replay
attack. By analyzing the replay model and replay detection meth-
