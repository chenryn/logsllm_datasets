All hypothesis tests should get a keyword `alternative` where applicable, with
naming `{'two-sided', 'less', 'greater'}`. Tests that do have them now are:
  * `kstest`, added in `3e3e8ea`, `7cf6643`
  * `fisher_exact`, added in gh-1919
There are open issues to add `alternative` to:
  * `ks_2samp`, gh-2290
  * `binom_test`, gh-2417 (with code to copy)
  * `mannwhitney`, gh-2118 (more extensive issue, but includes link to a commit from @josef-pkt that adds the keyword).
Other functions where the keyword could be added:
  * `chi2_contingency` (R func: http://rpackages.ianhowson.com/rforge/corpora/man/chisq.html)
  * `zscore` (R func: http://rpackages.ianhowson.com/rforge/corpora/man/z_score_pval.html)
  * the various `ttest`s (now only two-sided; R: http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/stats/html/t.test.html)
  * what else?
