Unlike related studies characterizing the behavior and structure
of wired networks DNS resolvers, measurement analysis of cellular
DNS resolvers can only be carried from clients within their net-
works. This is because most, if not all, cellular operators employ
NAT and ﬁrewall policies that prohibit externally generated trafﬁc
from their network [24].
We tested the external reachability of cellular network DNS re-
solvers by launching ping and traceroute probes from our university
network to the observed external resolvers (Sec. 4.1). Table 4
presents a summary of our results. Of the six major cellular carriers
we proﬁled, only Verizon and T-Mobile resolvers responded to
a majority of ping requests, with a small fraction of AT&T’s
responding. None of the resolvers responded to our tracerotue
probes on any of these networks and our probes were generally
unable to penetrate the cellular network beyond the network’s
ingress points.
In the case of Sprint and the two South Korean

combined for each of the four US carriers. Although the hostnames
we looked up were very popular, we see DNS cache misses for
nearly 20% of DNS requests on cellular. This is due to the short
TTLs used by CDNs, and explains the long tails of resolution times

carriers we studied, none of the resolvers responded to any of our
probes.
In contrast, all the probes launched by our mobile clients were
able to measure the DNS infrastructure of these carriers. Clearly
the known opaqueness of cellular networks extends to the cellular
DNS infrastructure and, thus, any analysis of such infrastructure
requires the participation of devices within each cellular network.
4.5 Client resolver inconsistency
In this section we analyze the consistency of LDNS resolvers
for clients in each cellular provider. As the location of end-
host’s visible LDNS resolver are commonly used to approximate
the actual end-host location, the consistency (or stickiness) of a
device’s LDNS resolver can signiﬁcantly impact the effectiveness
of services, such as CDNs, that rely on such approximation.
Our analysis revealed inconsistency between client and resolver
mappings in all cellular providers investigated. These inconsisten-
cies are not limited to the external resolver IP address, but include
the /24 preﬁx of the external address. Figure 8 shows the LDNS

pairs observed by each device over time, enumerated based on the
order of appearance in our measurements.
The temporal stability of mapping between clients and external
resolvers varies across carriers. Sprint and Verizon clients, for
instance, show relatively stable mappings while the mappings for
the remaining carriers appeared to be very unstable. Unstable
mappings are not all the same, however, as can be seen when
contrasting T-Mobile, AT&T and the two South Korean carriers.
In the ﬁrst two, changes in resolver IP addresses are typically
accompanied by changes in the resolvers /24 preﬁx. In contrast,
while clients in the two South Korean carriers experience more
frequent changes in resolver IP addresses, the alternative resolvers
are contained within one or two /24 preﬁxes. For example, a client
within LG U+’s network witnessed over 65 external resolver IP
addresses within a two week period, all of which were within only
2 /24 preﬁxes.
A possible reason for these unstable mappings is client mobility,
with client-resolver mappings changing as devices move within the
operator’s network. To study this, we recorded a coarse client

Figure 10: Cosine similarity of replica servers for buzzfeed.com between resolvers within the same /24 preﬁx, and those in separate preﬁxes.
Resolvers within the same /24 preﬁx see very similar sets of replicas (cosine similarity values close to one), and those in separate preﬁxes see
high set independence (values close to zero). Clients changing resolver /24 preﬁxes are directed towards completely different sets of replica
servers.
location for each experiment, rounded up to a 1000-meter radius
area. We ﬁnd that cellular clients experience changes to their DNS
IP and /24 preﬁxes even when not moving. Figure 9 shows users
on AT&T and T-Mobile’s network, and their resolver consistency
for a single location cluster.
To understand the potential impact of these inconsistencies
consider that, as shown by Xu et al. [25], DNS resolvers tend to
be clustered at egress points. A change of resolver can result in
the association of a mobile client with a completely different (and
distant!) egress point.
5. CELLULAR REPLICA SELECTION
We now explore the stability of replica server selection for
different mobile websites across the different carriers in our study.
For each hostnames in this set, we look at the number of replica IP
addresses returned, and how often each replica is chosen.
For the selected DNS resolver, we construct a map of
 pairs capturing, for each replica server, the
server IP address and the fraction of time that replica was used:
replica_map =
We then us cosine similarity [5, 23] to quantify the similarity of
replica servers mapped to each DNS resolver. The cosine similarity
between two vectors A and B quantiﬁes the degree of overlap
between two vectors by computing the dot product of the vectors
and dividing by the product of their lengths:
A · B
(cid:107)A(cid:107)(cid:107)B(cid:107)
cos_sim =
Given our vectors of non-negative probabilities, cos_sim ranges
from 0 to 1. When cos_sim = 0, the sets of redirections have
no clusters in common. Values greater than 0 indicate that some
clusters are seen in both sets; cos_sim = 1 means that the sets of
clusters seen are equivalent.
5.1 Impact of Cellular DNS
CDNs typically aggregate client resolvers behind traceroute
divergence points and map clients based on measurements to these
points [15]. The opaqueness of cellular networks, restricting the
reach of traceroutes (Sec. 4.4), calls into question the effectiveness
of this approach.
This may explain the relatively small numbers of replica servers
mapped to each cellular DNS resolver, particularly when compared
to typical CDN-resolver mappings in wired networks.
Looking at the replica maps for each cellular operator and
comparing cosine similarities, it appears that CDNs are grouping
replica mappings by resolver /24 preﬁx. Figure 10 shows the cosine
similarity (overlap) between replica sets for DNS resolvers in the
same /24 preﬁx, and those in different preﬁxes. We see large
degrees of independence between sets from differing /24 preﬁxes,
with over 60% of sets having a cosine similarity of 0, meaning there
is no overlap at all between replica vectors.
This high degree of replica set independence becomes a sig-
niﬁcant issue since, as we showed in Section 4.5, cellular clients
change LDNS resolvers frequently and across /24 preﬁxes poten-
tially leading to large performance variability.
5.2 Impact of network egress
A previous study of the structure of cellular networks iden-
tiﬁed the limited numbers of cellular ingress/egress points as a
limiting factor to the performance of content delivery in mobile
networks [25]. When their study was conducted the number of
egress points in each cellular network numbered between 4 and
6, and their recommendation was to place replicas close to these
egress points for best performance.
As cellular operators have continued to upgrade and evolve
their infrastructure, they have increased the number of network
egress points. Using our experiment dataset, we calculated the
number of egress points observed by our clients by looking for
the ﬁrst traceroute hop outside a mobile operators network, taking
the previous hop as the network egress point. Our results show a
substantial increase (2-10x) in the number of network egress points
across all US mobile operators, with 11 identiﬁed egress points

improvements on the performance of radio access networks that
makes client localization and replica selection critical for next
generation cellular networks.
6. PUBLIC DNS IN MOBILE NETWORKS
Considering the growth in public DNS services, in this sec-
tion we investigate their performance on name resolution and
its implications on CDN replica selection in cellular networks.
Despite the fact that some cellular operators prohibit customers
from conﬁguring different DNS resolvers,2 our characterization
of public DNS services provides a valuable benchmark against
which to compare the performance and localization effectiveness
of different cellular operators DNS.
6.1 Public DNS Characterization
We characterize the number of resolvers seen from clients within
each mobile provider. Table 5 shows the number of unique resolver
IPs seen from our clients on each mobile provider. We see that the
anycasted public DNS resolvers give signiﬁcantly higher numbers
of unique IP addresses to clients (GoogleDNS has over 4 times
the IP addresses than the cellular DNS providers for US carriers).
This is partly due to the architecture of these public DNS resolvers.
For instance, according to their public documentation, GoogleDNS
consists of 30 geographically distributed /24 subnetworks [9].
Accounting for the clustered nature of these public DNS re-
solvers, the bottom half of Table 5 shows the number of unique
/24 subnetworks seen for each resolver. By aggregating by /24
subnetworks, we see relatively equal numbers for all three resolver
types across each cellular provider, especially when compared to
the large disparity in IP addresses shown above.
As in wired networks, the distance to public DNS resolvers
could signiﬁcantly impact the web performance experienced by
clients [18]. Using the methods described in Section 4.1, we
measure the distance to both public DNS resolvers, and compare it

and, while no longer illegal in the United States, rooting voids the
