I have a form some fields are not validated based on the validation groups.
The validation works as expected but the error message is always added to the
wrong field. It seems to just use which ever property is last in the
validation.yml file.
I believe my use case is valid. It worked fine in 2.4 but when testing 2.5
BETA2 there were test failures. Also seems to be an issue with the master
branch.
I found it easiest to reproduce the issue using a system test. This can be
found in the following repository: https://github.com/tompedals/symfony-form-
test
Model: https://github.com/tompedals/symfony-form-
test/blob/master/src/Test/FormTestBundle/Model/Attachment.php
Form: https://github.com/tompedals/symfony-form-
test/blob/master/src/Test/FormTestBundle/Form/AttachmentType.php
Validation mapping: https://github.com/tompedals/symfony-form-
test/blob/master/src/Test/FormTestBundle/Resources/config/validation.yml
Test: https://github.com/tompedals/symfony-form-
test/blob/master/src/Test/FormTestBundle/Tests/Form/AttachmentTypeTest.php
Use `phpunit -c app` to run the tests.
