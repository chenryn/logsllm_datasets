# Summary of the new feature/enhancement
A visual indication of how wide/tall a zone is would be very useful in
creating accurate layouts. This could be done with a pixel count on the axis
or a simple % of resolution.
For example, I use a 5120x1440 monitor with a centered 16:9 zone and two half
size zones on the sides. If I could make sure that the center zone is exactly
2560 wide, it would ease my OCD greatly.
Just a minor idea!
