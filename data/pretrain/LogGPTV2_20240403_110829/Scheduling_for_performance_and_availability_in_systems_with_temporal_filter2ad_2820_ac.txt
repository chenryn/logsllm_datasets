for Exp1, Exp2, and Exp5, where again SWAP degrades
the performance of only 3% of the total number of requests.
3.3 Sensitivity to Temporal Dependence
In order to analyze the effect of temporal dependence on
policy performance, we conduct experiments with various
autocorrelation proﬁles at QACF , but always keeping the
same mean and CV of the job sizes. We use the three ser-
vice processes with autocorrelation ACF1, ACF2, and ACF3
shown in Figure 3.
Figure 7 shows the system throughput under FCFS,
SWAP and SJF policies for the same model evaluated in
Section 3.1 but for different autocorrelations. In general,
we expect that strong ACF degrades overall system perfor-
mance more than weak ACF, as it is clearly conﬁrmed by
the experimental results. Yet, SWAP under the stronger
ACF improves more than under the weaker ACF. This is
because the stronger the ACF, the higher the conditional
probabilities for having large-large pairs in the service time
series and the delaying is more aggressive. For instance, for
ACF1, we have P [L|L]j ≥ P [S|L]j for all j < 69.
When the service process has the two weaker ACFs, i.e.,
ACF2 and ACF3, the margin for performance improvement
of SWAP and SJF is much reduced. In this case, only the
conditional probabilities with lags up to j = 30 for ACF2
and up to j = 14 for ACF3 satisfy P [L|L]j ≥ P [S|L]j.
This implies that weaker ACFs make SWAP more conser-
vative in delaying long jobs, but SWAP still achieves per-
formance very close to the target behavior of SJF.
The plots in Figure 8 present the effect of different tem-
poral dependence on the tail RTTs under SWAP. Strong
temporal dependence in the service process makes SWAP
to delay long jobs more effectively, and thus almost 97% of
requests are served up to seven times faster than under the
FCFS policy, see Figure 8(a). As temporal dependence be-
comes weaker in Figure 8(b), the policy delays long jobs
less aggressively and a few requests show worse perfor-
mance. That is, SWAP becomes less effective, resulting in
a longer tail of the RTTs distribution. With low autocorre-
lation, see Figure 8(c), SWAP becomes more conservative
in delaying jobs, which is reﬂected by a small fraction of
affected jobs. Consistently with the results presented in the
previous case studies, SJF gives a long tail in the distribu-
tion of RTTs across all experiments and as the strength of
ACF decreases, the tail becomes longer.
3.4 Case 4: Sensitivity to System Load
Now we investigate the sensitivity of SWAP to an in-
creased number of requests in the system. This is extremely
important to understand the performability beneﬁt of the
technique as the system reaches critical congestion. In or-
der to evaluate how SWAP improves system availability, we
conduct experiments with three different network popula-
tions N = 500, N = 800, and N = 1000, while keeping
ﬁxed the other parameters as the experiment in Section 3.1.
The system throughput for these three experiments is illus-
trated in Figure 9 and the CCDFs of the RTTs experienced
by individual requests are plotted in Figure 10. In the ex-
periment with the highest load N = 1000, SWAP improves
throughput by 33% compared to FCFS and achieves perfor-
mance close to the target SJF performance. The improve-
ment is clear also for lower loads, i.e., N = 500, 800, but
performance gains are maximal under the most congested
case N = 1000.
