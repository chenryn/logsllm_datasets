I would like to propose the addition of a feature similar to `npm uninstall` for Deno. This feature would allow users to uninstall modules by providing the full URL that was used during the installation. Here are some examples:

```sh
$ deno uninstall https://deno.land/std/node/module.ts  # Uninstall via URL
$ deno un https://deno.land/std/path/mod.ts            # Shorthand for `uninstall`
```

By using this method, users can quickly and efficiently uninstall specific modules without having to manually browse the `~/.deno/bin` directory. This would streamline the process and improve the overall user experience.
