Similar to how `npm uninstall` works, I would like this feature to be added.
You can pass the full URL used during the installation. Examples:
    $ deno uninstall https://deno.land/std/node/module.ts # Uninstall via URL
    $ deno un https://deno.land/std/path/mod.ts           # Shorthand for `uninstall`
This way, we can uninstall modules faster rather than browsing the
`~/.deno/bin` directory and uninstall the desired module
