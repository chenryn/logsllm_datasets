I understand that you're encountering an error after upgrading to Deno v1.0.4, and the same project worked fine in Deno v1.0.2. Here is a more polished version of your description:

**Issue Description:**

After upgrading to Deno v1.0.4, I encountered the following error when running my project. The project worked correctly in Deno v1.0.2.

**Error:**
```
thread 'main' panicked at 'already borrowed: BorrowMutError', /rustc/4fb7144ed159f94491249e86d5bbd033b5d60550/src/libcore/cell.rs:878:9
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
fatal runtime error: failed to initiate panic, error 5
[1]    4387 abort      deno run -A -c tsconfig.json app.ts
```

**Command Used:**
```
deno run -A -c tsconfig.json app.ts
```

**tsconfig.json:**
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
    "emitDecoratorMetadata": true
  }
}
```

I'm currently stuck and would appreciate any help or suggestions.
