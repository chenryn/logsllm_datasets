## ❓ Questions & Help
I want to use `mixed_precision`, and I found
tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.Policy.
So I put `tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.set_policy("mixed_float16")`
before `TFBertModel.from_pretrained(pretrained_weights)`. When I run the code,
I got the following error:
> InvalidArgumentError: cannot compute AddV2 as input #1(zero-based) was
> expected to be a half tensor but is a float tensor [Op:AddV2] name:
> tf_bert_model_1/bert/embeddings/add/
which happened at `ret = model(model.dummy_inputs, training=False) # build the
network with dummy inputs`.
I am not sure if I used it correctly. I think
`tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.set_policy` is supposed to be used
before constructing / build the model, as the tf page says `Policies can be
passed to the 'dtype' argument of layer constructors, or a global policy can
be set with 'tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.set_policy'`.
I wonder if I can use AMP with tf based transformer models and how. Thanks.
