In issue #12551 and comment #12512, it is noted that using `usecols=['a', 1]` should raise an error. 

To clarify, the `usecols` parameter in pandas' `read_csv` function should not mix column names (strings) and column indices (integers). Therefore, passing a list that contains both a string and an integer, such as `['a', 1]`, should result in an exception being raised to prevent potential confusion or misuse.
