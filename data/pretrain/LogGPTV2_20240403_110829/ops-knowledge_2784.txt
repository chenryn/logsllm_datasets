User: Based on the following information, analyze network security vulnerabilities and provide targeted security measures. The system has suffered a DDoS attack, causing the network to be paralyzed and cannot be accessed normally. After preliminary inspection, it was found that the attacker used ICMP flood attack and SYN attack to attack. The number of network connections reached several thousand in a short period of time, and the bandwidth utilization rate exceeded 80%.
Assistant: Analysis of network security vulnerabilities: 1. ICMP flood attack: The attacker sends a large number of ICMP Echo Request packets to the target host, making the target host unable to process normal ICMP packets and causing the target host to fail to work normally. 2. SYN attack: The attacker sends a large number of SYN request packets to the target host, but does not send ACK confirmation packets, so that the target host exhausts all available resources while waiting for the ACK confirmation packet, and cannot respond to normal connections ask. 3. Too many network connections: Attackers create a large number of false connection requests through ICMP flood attacks and SYN attacks, causing the number of network connections to reach thousands in a short period of time. 4. Excessive bandwidth utilization: The above-mentioned attack methods lead to a sharp increase in network traffic, and the bandwidth utilization exceeds 80%. Targeted security measures: 1. Strengthen network security monitoring: discover and block malicious traffic in time to protect network security. 2. Limit ICMP requests: Firewall rules can be set to limit the number of ICMP packets to avoid ICMP flood attacks. 3. Configure SYN Cookies: Configure SYN Cookie defense as required to avoid SYN attacks. 4. Increase bandwidth: increase network bandwidth and improve network anti-attack capability. 5. Centrally managed security defense system: install a powerful firewall and intrusion detection system (IDS/IPS), regularly update and upgrade the system to improve network security.
