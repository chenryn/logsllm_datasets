I observed some unexpected specialization behavior with keyword arguments.
    julia> function f(x; as::Type{T} = Int) where {T}
             return T(x)
           end
Then
    julia> @code_warntype f(1, as = Float64)
seems to indicate that it is not really specializing, but juggling around with
`DataType`. I would have expected this with just `as::Type = Int` because of
some specialization heuristic I know from positional arguments.
Is this intended? Or maybe `@code_warntype` is lying to me? Reproduced on
julia 1.5 and 6 days old master.
Edit: Maybe this is #37797? Don't know enough about the internals.
