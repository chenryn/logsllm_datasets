User: Is there any reason why Nose wouldn't be able to find tests in Ubuntu 9.04? 
I'm using nose 0.11.1 with python 2.5.4.
I can run tests only if I explicitly specify the filename. 
If I don't specify the filename it just says, 0 tests. 
The same project runs tests fine on my Mac, so I'm quite stumped!
Assistant: Use the -all-modules and it will find all the tests.
nosetests --all-modules ./tests
