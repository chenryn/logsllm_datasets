Options
=========
## Search Terms
-c, --case [Term] Perform a case-sensitive search (Default is inSEnsITiVe)
-e, --exact [Term] Perform an EXACT & order match on exploit title (Default
is an AND match on each term) [Implies "-t"]
e.g. "WordPress 4.1" would not be detect "WordPress
Core 4.1")
-s, --strict Perform a strict search, so input values must exist,
disabling fuzzy search for version range
e.g. "1.1" would not be detected in "1.0

Listing 364 - The version is visible in the source code
The web application and its version is located near the bottom of the source code page. Upon
further investigation, we can determine that it is a free web-based project management
software.728
With this new discovery, we’ll search Exploit DB for a remote exploit for “qdPM 9.1”, which returns
a couple relevant exploits.

Inspecting the latest exploit,729 we determine that it aligns well with our search: it is verified,
remote, and allows for remote code execution. We will review the exploit and gain a basic
understanding of it before executing it.
The exploit requires a username and password for the project management web application. After
reviewing the code, we can conclude the username field of the login page is an e-mail address.
We were able to find several e-mails, but no exposed passwords. If we have working credentials
with the web application, the exploit will upload a command web shell that we can use to execute
commands on the target.
Another method of getting an account password would be to use a list generator on the website.
After a word list is generated, we can try the list as-is or make changes to create more complex
passwords.

Using a dictionary attack on the login portal along with the four discovered e-mails, we can verify
that PI:EMAIL:AIDevCorp are valid credentials for George’s account.

With a valid login to the system, we can enumerate the tasks, projects, and some configurations
of the project management system. Because we found an exploit that needed working

credentials, we can now execute the exploit against our target.
We’ll copy the exploit to our current wiorking directory with searchsploit.
