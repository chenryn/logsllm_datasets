**ATT&CK ID:** T1092  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Communication Through Removable Media

Adversaries can use removable media to facilitate command and control (C2) between compromised hosts on potentially disconnected networks. This technique involves transferring commands and files from one system to another using removable media, such as USB drives. Both systems must be compromised for this method to be effective. Typically, an Internet-connected system is compromised first, followed by a second system through lateral movement, often via the "Replication Through Removable Media" technique.

In this scenario, the adversary would relay commands and files from the disconnected system to the Internet-connected system, which they can access directly. This allows the adversary to maintain C2 even in environments where network connectivity is limited or restricted.
