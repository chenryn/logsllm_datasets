User: I am writing a script that will be polling a directory looking for new files. 
In this scenario, is it necessary to do some sort of error checking to make sure the files are completely written prior to accessing them?  
I don't want to work with a file before it has been written completely to disk, but because the info I want from the file is near the beginning, it seems like it could be possible to pull the data I need without realizing the file isn't done being written.
Is that something I should worry about, or will the file be locked because the OS is writing to the hard drive?
This is on a Linux system.
Assistant: If you have some control over the writing program, have it write the file somewhere else (like the /tmp directory) and then when it's done move it to the directory being watched. 
If you don't have control of the program doing the writing (and by 'control' I mean 'edit the source code'), you probably won't be able to make it do file locking either, so that's probably out. In which case you'll likely need to know something about the file format to know when the writer is done. For instance, if the writer always writes "DONE" as the last four characters in the file, you could open the file, seek to the end, and read the last four characters.
