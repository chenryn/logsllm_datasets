### Summary of the Log Chunk

This log chunk, spanning from 18:10:32 to 18:10:38 on October 18th, highlights several recurring issues in a Hadoop environment:

1. **RMCommunicator Allocator Connection Attempts:**
   - The `RMCommunicator Allocator` is repeatedly attempting to connect to the server at `msra-sa-41:8030`.
   - Each attempt is logged with an `INFO` level, indicating that it is retrying the connection.
   - The retry policy is set to `RetryUpToMaximumCountWithFixedSleep` with a maximum of 10 retries and a sleep time of 1000 milliseconds (1 second) between each retry.
   - After each connection attempt, an `ERROR` log entry is generated, stating "ERROR IN CONTACTING RM."

2. **LeaseRenewer Lease Renewal Failures:**
   - The `LeaseRenewer` for the user `msrabi` at `msra-sa-41:9000` is failing to renew the lease for `DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1`.
   - Each failure is logged with a `WARN` level, indicating that the lease renewal has failed for a specific duration (e.g., 335 seconds, 336 seconds, etc.).
   - The log states that the `LeaseRenewer` will retry the lease renewal shortly.

3. **Address Changes:**
   - Both the `RMCommunicator Allocator` and the `LeaseRenewer` are detecting address changes.
   - The old address is `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:8030` or `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000`, and the new address is `msra-sa-41:8030` or `msra-sa-41:9000`.
   - These address changes are logged with a `WARN` level, suggesting that the system is dynamically updating the IP addresses but encountering issues during the transition.

### Detailed Breakdown

- **Timestamps and Levels:**
  - The log entries are timestamped from 18:10:32 to 18:10:38, with varying log levels (`INFO`, `ERROR`, `WARN`).

- **Processes and Components:**
  - **RMCommunicator Allocator:**
    - Component: `org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Client`
    - Logs: Retrying connection to `msra-sa-41:8030` and errors in contacting the Resource Manager (RM).
  - **LeaseRenewer:**
    - Component: `org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.LeaseRenewer`
    - Logs: Failed to renew the lease for `DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1` and will retry.
  - **Address Change Detection:**
    - Component: `org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Client`
    - Logs: Detected address changes from `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:8030` or `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000` to `msra-sa-41:8030` or `msra-sa-41:9000`.

### Conclusion

The log indicates ongoing connectivity and lease renewal issues in the Hadoop environment. The `RMCommunicator Allocator` is unable to connect to the Resource Manager, and the `LeaseRenewer` is failing to renew the lease for a DFS client. Additionally, the system is detecting and logging address changes, which may be contributing to these issues. Further investigation into network configurations and Hadoop cluster settings is recommended to resolve these problems.
