Currently `AnnotationTypeFilter` invokes the constructor of
`AbstractTypeHierarchyTraversingFilter` setting `considerInterfaces` to
`false`. This probably makes sense in most cases. However there might be
`BeanDefinitionParser` implementations that declare a `FactoryBean` creating a
proxy for discovered interfaces. So it would be cool if we could add a
constructor to pass in a `boolean` to enable interface discovery as well.
