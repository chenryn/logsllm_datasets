Abstract
Mobile autonomous systems, robots, and cyber-physical sys-
tems rely on accurate positioning information. To conduct
distance-measurement, two devices exchange signals and,
knowing these signals propagate at the speed of light, the time
of arrival is used for distance estimations. Existing distance-
measurement techniques are incapable of protecting against
adversarial distance enlargement—a highly devastating tac-
tic in which the adversary reissues a delayed version of the
signals transmitted between devices, after distorting the au-
thentic signal to prevent the receiver from identifying it. The
adversary need not break crypto, nor compromise any upper-
layer security protocols for mounting this attack. No known
solution currently exists to protect against distance enlarge-
ment. We present Ultra-Wideband Enlargement Detection
(UWB-ED), a new modulation technique to detect distance
enlargement attacks, and securely verify distances between
two mutually trusted devices. We analyze UWB-ED under
an adversary that injects signals to block/modify authentic
signals. We show how UWB-ED is a good candidate for
802.15.4z Low Rate Pulse and the 5G standard.
1 Introduction
Ranging and positioning information is often necessary for
mobile autonomous systems, robots and cyber-physical sys-
tems to operate successfully. These systems are used in se-
curity and safety critical applications. Drones are becom-
ing more popular for transportation and rescue [24], and au-
tonomous systems are being increasingly tested and integrated
as part of the ecosystem. The 5G community emphasizes the
importance of designing the wireless protocols for the safety
of the autonomous vehicles [33]. A stringent requirement
for these systems is to avoid crashing into, e.g., buildings,
pedestrians, properties, or each other [25]. For example, keep-
ing drones and autonomous vehicles on their intended paths

tion and enlargement attacks.
and preventing their collision can be achieved only if they
are able to calculate their relative positions accurately and
securely. Figure 1 shows that an adversary can manipulate the
perceived distance between two mutually trusted devices by
the distance reduction and enlargement attacks.
Conventional ranging systems, such as GPS and WiFi Po-
sitioning Systems (WPS) [34], are useful for benign environ-
ments and coarse-granular geolocation. However, they pro-
vide insufﬁcient precision for accurate distance estimations
(e.g., cm-level granularity), suffer availability constraints (e.g.,
indoors, outdoors), and are relatively slow to calculate loca-
tions for fast and mobile autonomous systems. More impor-
tantly, the aforementioned ranging systems are susceptible to
various spooﬁng attacks [4, 14, 28].
Two-way time-of-ﬂight (ToF)-based ranging systems
(which map ToF to distance as signals propagate at the speed
of light) have the potential to conduct accurate, fast, and
secure distance measurements. Examples include high pre-
cision Ultra-wide Band (UWB) ranging systems, some of
which are now available off-the-shelf [1, 9, 13, 35]. Numerous
previous efforts were directed towards protecting these sys-
tems from distance-reduction attacks, e.g., for access control.
These mainly rely on the principle that propagation speeds

cannot be sped-up. For example, distance bounding protocols
return an upper bound on the measured distance, armed by the
fact that an adversary would not succeed in guessing (secret)
bit level information [5, 6]. Other techniques are based on
tailoring modulations to prevent distance-reduction attacks
at the physical layer [26]. None of these approaches prevent
distance enlargement attacks.
Distance enlargement attacks can deviate vehicles from
their intended paths, or cause physical collisions. Existing
protection approaches rely on dense, and often ﬁxed, veriﬁ-
cation infrastructures, e.g., towers. These may not exist, and
often do not; installing them in outdoor settings is a costly
affair, and not necessarily feasible (e.g., in drone-based mili-
tary missions behind enemy lines). Distance enlargement is a
more devastating attack than distance shortening because an
adversary in the communication range only needs to annihi-
late (cancel) [23] or distort the authentic signals to prevent the
receiver from identifying them and using their time-of-arrival
(ToA) for ranging. The adversary then simply replays a de-
layed version of the authentic signals, which it has already
received by positioning itself in the vicinity of the sender or
the receiver. The adversary need not guess these signals, nor
compromise any upper-layer protocols to do that. The amount
of delay corresponds to the adversary-intended distance to
enlarge. In a collision-avoidance system of automobiles or
self-driving cars for example, a few meters (∼ a few nanosec-
onds) could be catastrophic.
We present Ultra-Wideband Enlargement Detection (UWB-
ED)—the ﬁrst known modulation technique to detect dis-
tance enlargement attacks against UWB ranging based on
ToF. UWB-ED relies on the interleaving of pulses of different
phases and empty pulse slots (i.e., on-off keying). Unable to
perfectly guess the phase, this leaves the adversary with a 50%
chance of annihilating pulses (similarly for ampliﬁcation). As
a result, some of the affected (authentic) pulses will be ampli-
ﬁed, while others will be annihilated. Unaffected pulses will
remain intact, while positions that originally had no pulses
may now have adversary-injected ones. The technique pre-
sented herein gets the receiver to seek evidence indicating
whether such a deformed trail of pulses in the transmission
was indeed authentic, albeit corrupt.
Similar to Singh et al. [26] (which addresses distance-
reduction attacks), we leverage a randomized permutation
of pulses. However, unlike [26], we cannot simply look for
whether these are out of order, and ignore them if so be-
cause that is precisely the adversary’s objective in distance-
enlargement: misleading the receiver to ignore the authentic
signals. Instead, UWB-ED checks the energy distribution
of pulses: comparing the aggregate energies of a subset of
pulses at the positions where high energy was expected (as per
the sender-receiver secret pulse-permutation agreement), with
others where low energy was expected. To subvert this, the ad-
versary would be forced to inject excessive energy throughout
the whole transmission, which could then be detected using
standard DoS/jamming-detection techniques.
We derive the probability that an adversary succeeds in a
distance-enlargement attack against UWB-ED. This is also
useful in setting input parameters, e.g., balancing an applica-
tion’s security requirements and ranging rate, while account-
ing for channel conditions. For example, we show how proper
parameterization of UWB-ED limits an adversary’s success
probability in enlarging distances to  Dmax, the devices realize they are
outside each other’s communication range without the need
to run distance-enlargement detection protocol.
In Fig. 3a, an authentic signal reaches the receiver at time t,
and the adversary’s signal at t + δ. If the receiver backtracks
in time (searching for earlier-received signals), the authentic
signal will be encountered. Figure 3b shows how the pre-
dictability of the symbol structure enables an adversary to
annihilate its pulses (by emitting a reciprocal pulse phase),
preventing the receives from detecting it. Figure 3c shows
the case when nodes are not in the communication range (or
signal is attenuated by channel condition); the receiver does
not get authentic signals, just adversary-relayed (and delayed)
signals.
3 Threat Model
We focus on the scenario where there are two devices in
a wireless network that are interested to securely measure
the physical distance between them, and protect the measure-
ments from a third-party adversary. The devices know their
maximum communication range. The adversary’s objective
is to enlarge the distance that the devices measure. The adver-
sary cannot directly block or modify messages on the channel
(cf. Dolev-Yao’s adversary [10]); it can rather inject signals,
and through such injection it can block/modify the authentic
signals. If successful, this injection can lead to jamming, sig-
nal annihilation, and/or content modiﬁcation. This model cap-
tures the capabilities of man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks in
wireless settings, and is typical in previous literature [7, 12].
The model also ﬁts well with our target application scenario:
the communicating devices are typically mobile and move
(drive or ﬂy) in formation. In such scenarios, it is unlikely that
an adversary prevents the signals of one device from reaching
the other by physical obstacles, and is thus limited to injecting
signals.
We assume the adversary is able to communicate and listen
on any channel the devices use. However, because the devices
are communicating over UWB, the adversary is unable to de-
terministically annihilate pulses without knowing their phase
