ABSTRACT 
The mission of the 2nd ACM Workshop on Information Sharing 
and Collaborative Security is to advance the scientific foundations 
for sharing threat and security-related data among organizations. 
The  call  for  better  information  sharing  continues  to  be  an 
important  theme  in  the  computer  security  community  and  with 
policy  makers.  The  expectation  is  that  sharing  will  significantly 
improve the ability of defenders to detect and mitigate attacks on 
their  networks  and  systems.  Several  commercial  offerings  by 
security vendors that enable automated sharing have gone live and 
existing communities have begun to use them.  
Sharing  of  security  and  threat  data  at  scale  raises  a  number  of 
interesting  research  questions,  including  on  how  to  best  collect, 
analyze and make use of these data to address important security 
concerns.  In  addition  sharing  raises  privacy  and  other  policy 
issues that need to be addressed.     
The  2nd  ACM  Workshop  on 
Information  Sharing  and 
Collaborative Security (WISCS’15) aims to bring together experts 
and  practitioners  from  academia,  industry  and  government  to 
present  innovative  research,  case  studies,  and  legal  and  policy 
issues. WISCS’15 is held in Denver, Colorado, USA on October 
12,  2015  in  conjunction  with  the  22nd  ACM  Conference  on 
Computer and Communications Security (ACM CCS 2015).

1.  INTRODUCTION 
Improving security and threat-information sharing is viewed as a 
crucial  opportunity 
the  defensive  posture  of 
organizations.  Major  attacks  on  US 
retailers,  healthcare 
companies or government agencies led to the leakage of PII about 
millions of users and have led to a renewed sense of urgency for 
accelerating information sharing efforts. President Obama signed 
an  Executive  Order  on “Promoting Private Sector Cybersecurity 
Information Sharing” in February 2015 [1] that includes tasking a 
standards  organization  with  codifying 
the  standards  and 
guidelines for “Information Sharing Organizations (ISAOs)”. This 
and other efforts are aimed to make information sharing available 
to a much a broader range of organizations.  
In order to create truly effective information sharing solutions a 
number  of  technical  and  policy  questions  still  require  progress. 
Which data exactly should enterprises share and with whom? As 
many  cyber  attacks  tend  to  unfold  quickly  (see  e.g.  [2]) 
automation is necessary to meet requirements for speed and scale. 
Extracting  the  “right”  information  to  share  from  the  billions  of 
security  related  events  (from  FW  logs,  IDS  alerts  etc.)  that  are 
collected daily in a typical enterprise is a difficult problem. One 
reason is that it needs to be determined which data can be shared 
without  inappropriately  disclosing  PII  or  information  that  could 
put the company at risk. For example if shared malware samples 
allow  competitors,  attackers  or  regulatory  agencies  to  conclude 
that a company’s network has specific vulnerabilities or has been 
breached  in  an  APT  attack,  this  carries  significant  security, 
reputational  and  legal  risks.  Indeed  the  public  policy  and  civil 
liberties  community  has  been  debating  vigorously,  the  privacy, 
civil  liberties  and  corporate  liability  issues  involved.  More 
research  is  required  to  understand,  quantify  and  minimize  these 
risks  and  thereby  provide  a  sound  technical  foundation  for  this 
debate.  
Other  challenges  arise  in  how  to  derive  high  quality  “threat 
intelligence”  from  shared  data.  If  false  positive-rates  can  not  be 
sufficiently controlled defenders could paradoxically be worth off 
than without access to shared data in the first place as noisy data 
distracts 
the 
information sharing life-cycle we need to better understand, how 
organizations can make effective, ideally automated use of shared 
data in their defenses. In addition note that much of the high value 
information to be shared, such as descriptions of incidents, threat 
actors, campaigns and mitigations will be created and consumed 
by  (human)  security  analysts  who  tend  to  be  under  significant 
time  pressure.  Thus  getting  the  HCI  and  UX  aspects  of  sharing 
platforms  right  is  another  critical  element  for  delivering  on  the 
promise  of  information  sharing.  These  and  other  challenges 
important  work.  To  close 
them  from  other 
1717situate information sharing at the intersection point of a number 
of disciplines within computer science and policy research.   
This year’s workshop, the second in its series, aims to be at the 
forefront  of  these  developments  as  the  premier  forum  for  the 
presentation of research results in collaborative security, privacy 
and  confidentiality,  as  well  as  legal  and  policy  issues.      This 
year’s  workshop  also  includes  two  case  studies  of  innovative 
information  sharing  initiatives,  aligned  with  the  workshop’s 
objective  to  serve  as  a  venue  for  fruitful  discussions  among 
practitioners and researchers in this field.

3.  PROGRAM FORMAT  
WISCS’15 is a one-day workshop held in Denver, Colorado, USA 
on October 12, 2015. It is pre-conference workshop to the 22nd 
ACM  Conference  on  Computer  and  Communications  Security 
(ACM CCS 2015). The workshop opens with a one hour keynote 
“Real World Information Exchange: Challenges and Insights” by 
Freddy Dezeure, Head of CERT-EU. The keynote is followed by 
6 full paper and 2 short paper presentations. In accordance with 
the  goal  of  encouraging  a  fruitful  exchange  of  opinions  the  slot 
for each paper consists of a 30 minute presentation followed by a 
10 minute discussion.  
All  submissions  were  peer-reviewed  by  at  least  3  PC  members. 
The workshop received 16 submissions of which 8 were accepted 
for presentation.      
4.  CONCLUSION 
WISCS  is  the  first  workshop  devoted  solely  to  the  scientific 
aspects of sharing threat and security related data.

also  an  independent  consultant  to  leading  companies  and  to 
various governments' open projects. 
Dr. Yung's interests include a large spectrum of cryptography and 
information  security  and  privacy  research  areas,  distributed 
systems,  and  technology  innovations  as  well.  His  contributions 
are extensive and diversified, and are in the areas of: foundations 
of  cryptography,  new  cryptographic  notions  and  schemes, 
authentication  and  network  security,  secure  protocols,  privacy, 
trust in systems, and direct contributions to working innovative IT 
products. He is a fellow of IACR, a fellow of IEEE, and a fellow
