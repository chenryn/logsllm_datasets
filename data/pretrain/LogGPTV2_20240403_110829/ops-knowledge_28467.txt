User: I have a Python virtualenv (created with virtualenvwerapper) in one user account.  I would like to use it from another user account on the same host.
How can I do this?
How can I set up virtual environments so as to be available to any user on the host?  (Primarily Linux / Debian but also Mac OSX.)
Thanks.
Assistant: Put it in a user-neutral directory, and make it group-readable.
For instance, for libraries, I use /srv/http/share/ for sharing code across web applications.
You could use /usr/local/share/ for normal applications.
