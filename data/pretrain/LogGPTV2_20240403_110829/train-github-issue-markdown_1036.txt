I grew tired of having to convert my units just for the sake of specifying the
figure size. I'd like to specify the figure size directly in a metric unit,
nominally centimeters (or millimeters, no difference). In most EU countries
metric is the norm. I only have to deal with inches when looking at monitor
sizes, printing, and matplotlib :(
I've found at least two issues about this: #1369 and the more generic #9226.
Of course, having support for generic unit specifiers would be nice, but I'm
not entirely satisfied by the extra complexity of #9226. I'm also thorn about
(size, unit) tuples, because I don't ever think I'm going to specify the
figure size in AU, or picometers. Cm is regularly used for anything that fits
paper.
I see two cases where inches are specified in the rc:
  * figure.figsize
  * savefig.pad_inches
In the api, there is the figsize kwarg, I guess a pad_inches kwarg, and the
set_size_inches method.
What abound the KISS approach: add a figsize_cm kwarg, pad_cm, and the
set_size_cm method, and the two respective rcParams? Fully backward
compatible, and allows metric countries to get by easily.
I could easily contribute such a patch.
