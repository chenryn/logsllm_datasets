User: I am trying to make my python script executable without going through the terminal typing like
python test.py
I want to make it able to run when i click on the file.
How i going to do this in my fedora machine.
Assistant: It's Nautilus's fault. Open Nautilus (the file manager), go to Menu > Preferences.
Select the "Behaviour" section.
On the field titled "Executable text files", select the option "Execute executable text files when opened".
