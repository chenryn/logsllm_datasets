User: How to use iptables to prevent disaster attacks in Linux system and protect server security?
Assistant: Iptables is a commonly used firewall software under Linux, which can filter, forward and modify network traffic and improve server security. Here are some ways to use iptables to defend against network attacks: 1. Prohibit unnecessary service ports Configure firewall rules through iptables and prohibit unnecessary service ports on the server, such as FTP, Telnet, NetBIOS and other services, which can greatly reduce the attack surface. 2. Limit the number of connections For some common attack methods, such as SYN Flood attack, CC attack, etc., you can limit the number of connections and request rate through the --connlimit and --limit parameters of iptables. 3. Block malicious IP addresses Use iptables to block traffic from malicious IP addresses, which can be achieved using the --source and -j DROP parameters. At the same time, you can also use some blacklist or whitelist tools to automatically block IP addresses. 4. Enable SYN Cookies SYN Cookies is a technique used to prevent SYN Flood attacks, which can be realized by enabling the net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies=1 parameter in /etc/sysctl.conf. 5. Turn on the reverse proxy The reverse proxy can forward the request from the outside to the internal application server, thereby hiding the IP address of the server and improving the security of the server. The above are some methods of using iptables to prevent network attacks, but they also need to be adjusted and optimized according to the actual situation. At the same time, it is also necessary to regularly update firewall rules and software versions to maintain server security.
