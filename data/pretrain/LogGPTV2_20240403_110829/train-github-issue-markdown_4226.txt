## Question
I try to use ShardingProxy to my program ,and i found a problem that is :  
Insert speed of ShardingProxy is very slow.
I write a program to transfer my old data via Jdbc( batch).
            insert data for a whole day only one million data was inserted
Sharding-Proxy 4.0.0 (2020 Jan 13)
  1. Is there any config problem ? (I use snow flake to generate id )  
12 subtable(one table per month) just insert .
  2. I have read the old related issue , If this is the parse problem , what is your plan to fix this?
