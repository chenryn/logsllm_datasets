point) results in very high power at its output (i.e., the relayed
query at f2 in Fig. 8). This creates a risk of saturation at the
input of the uplink. We mitigate this problem by shifting most
of the uplink gain to the output of the uplink path, i.e., after
the baseband cancellation from the bandpass filter in Fig. 8.
Fabrication and Physical Dimensions: We implemented our de-
sign on a 4-layer FR-4 PCB using standard commercial components.
High dielectric ceramic antennas are chosen to minimize the system
size. The final size of our relay is 10cm x 7.5cm and the total weight
is 35g. Our current design employs four antennas for ease of testing
and debugging. The number of antenna can be reduced to two by
utilizing two circulators shared between the downlink and uplink.

Integrating the Relay with a Commercial
Drone
RFly’s relay is mounted on a Parrot Bebop 2 drone [23] shown in
Fig. 7(b). The Bebop 2 is a low-cost commercial drone. The present
retail price is $499. The overall dimension of Bebop 2 is 32 × 38 cm,
and it can carry a maximum payload of 200g.
We use the drone’s battery to power RFly’s relay. Because the
relay requires a 5.5 V DC power supply while the drone’s battery
output is 12 V, we insert a DC-to-DC converter between the drone’s
battery and the relay. The converter is connected to the anode and
cathode of the battery via secondary wiring. The relay’s total power
consumption is 5.8 Watts, drawing 0.49 Amps current from the

battery. Since the battery is designed to support up to 21.6 Amps,
the relay consumes less than 3% of the drone’s battery.
6.3 RFID System Implementation and Evaluation
The overall system consists of RFly’s relay mounted on a low-cost
commercial drone, an RFID reader which is compliant with the EPC
Gen2 protocol, and off-the-shelf low-cost passive RFID tags.
RFID Reader: State-of-the-art commercial off-the-shelf RFID read-
ers have limitations in accurately measuring the phase with a full
360-degree cycle. For example, the ThingMagic M6e reader [4]
can only report phases between 0 and 180 degrees, while the Imp-
inj R420 [2] experiences 180 degrees random phase jumps. Hence,
we adapt a USRP RFID reader implementation developed in [26]
and incorporate RFly’s localization algorithm described in §5. The
reader handles a variety of commands including the Query com-
mand, ACK command, Select command, and QueryRep Command.
We retrieve the complex channels from USRP and post-process them
in MATLAB.
Passive RFID Tags: We use the Alien Squiggle General Purpose
tags [12] in our evaluation, which are the current industry standard.
The cost of each tag is $0.12.
Ground Truth: We use OptiTrack [5], which is an optical tracking
system, as a ground truth for location measurements. The system
consists of an array of infrared cameras mounted on a ceiling, and
can achieve sub-cm localization accuracy in tracking objects tagged
with infrared-reflective markers in its line-of-sight. The optical track-
ing system serves two purposes: first, it measures the ground truth
location of the target RFID tag. Second, it captures the flight path
trajectory of the drone. Note that the drone’s trajectory may also be
acquired from its odometry sensors.
7 RESULTS
In this section, we report the results of RFly’s evaluation.
7.1 Does RFly’s Relay Satisfy the Two Key
Properties?
First, we evaluate whether RFly’s relay satisfies its two key proper-
ties: bidirectionally full-duplex and phase-preserving.
(a) Self-interference Cancellation: We evaluate the amount of iso-
lation achieved on each of the four self-interference links described
in §4. We run 100 experimental trials in total. In each trial, we use
the USRP to generate an input signal that is fed to the relay, and we
perform power measurements using a spectrum analyzer. In each
experiment, we vary the power and the center frequency of the in-
put signal (within the UHF ISM band). We perform four types of
experiments:
• To measure Intrad , we feed f1 + 50kHz to the input of the
downlink (to emulate a query) and measure the power at the
output of the downlink at f1 + 50kHz.
• To measure Intrau , we feed f2 + 500kHz to the input of
the uplink (to emulate an RFID’s response) and measure the
power at the output of the downlink at f2 + 500kHz.
• To measure Interdu , we feed f2 + 50kHz to the input of the
uplink (to emulate a the leakage of a query from downlink to
uplink) and measure the power at the output of the uplink at
f1 + 50kHz.
• To measure Interud , we feed f1 + 500kHz to the input of
the downlink (to emulate a the leakage of a tag’s response)
and measure the power at the output of the downlink at f2 +
500kHz.
We compute the isolation as the signal attenuation (between the
input and output of interest) plus the gain. This allows us to factor
out the gain of the circuit. We also count the isolation of the antennas
toward the total isolation.
The CDFs for the isolations are shown in Fig. 9. The figures
also report the amount of isolation achieved by a baseline analog
relay. The baseline implements a traditional analog relay design that
achieves isolation by antenna separation and polarization. Note that
the antennas are spaced relatively closely (at 10cm separation) to
enable a compact relay that can be mounted on a drone. Recall that
RFly can only rely on analog cancellation in order to preserve phase
and timing characteristics for localization.
The figures demonstrate the following findings:
• RFly’s relay achieves median isolations of 110, 92, 77, and
64dB. These consist at least 50dB improvement over a tradi-
tional analog relay.
• The inter-link isolations (110dB and 92dB) are higher than
the intra-link isolations (77dB and 64dB). This is expected be-
cause RFly’s isolation is achieved primarily through baseband
filters that are optimized for maximizing low frequency can-
cellation (which is used in RFly’s inter-link isolation) rather
than minimizing high frequency feed-through (which results
in intra-link leakage). Note that additional RF filters can be
used if higher isolations are needed.
• The downlink isolation is higher than the uplink isolation.
This is because the downlink (low-pass) filter results in more
attenuation than the uplink (band-pass) filter. Note that this

discrepancy is benign since RFly’s relay is optimized for
downlink isolation (as explained in §6.1) to enable more
amplified power delivery to an RFID.
(b) Phase Preservation: Unlike conventional relay technologies
which introduce random frequency and phase offsets, RFly’s relay
is phase-preserving. In particular, it only introduces a constant phase
offset (due to the hardware path) which can be eliminated using the
drone-embedded RFID as described in §5.1.
To measure the phase-preserving capability of RFly’s relay, we
place an RFID tag 0.5 m away from the relay and connect the
relay over the wire to the USRP-implemented reader. We run 50
experimental trials in total. In each trial, we generate a reader’s query
with a random initial phase using the USRP and feed it as an input
to the downlink relay. The relay’s uplink output is also connected
directly to a reader. The reader’s decoder computes the channel of
the RFID and extracts its phase. We measure the offset as the phase
difference between estimated channels across the different trials.
We use the embedded RFID in order to factor out the effect of the
hardware channel.
The CDF of the phase offset is shown in Fig. 10. The median
phase error in our mirrored architecture is 0.34◦ and the 99th per-
centile error is 1.2◦. In contrast, without a mirrored architecture (i.e.,
if the upconversion/downconversion frequencies are not locked to
the same synthesizers), the phase is completely random as shown in
Fig. 10. This shows that RFly can preserve the phase of an RFID’s
response and use it for localization.
7.2 How Does the Overall System Perform?
Next, to evaluate that RFly can detect and accurately localize battery-
free RFIDs over a wide area, we run 100 experimental trials locations
throughout two floors our research facility building. The building
is 30 × 40 m wide. Our experiments encompass both line-of-sight
and non-line-of-sight settings and span three floors of our research
facility.
(a) Range Evaluation: To evaluate RFly’s range improvement, we
run two types of experiments: one with the relay and one baseline
without the relay. At each location we measure the percentage of
decodable RFID tag responses to determine the reading rate.
Fig. 11 plots the reading rate as a function of distance. The figure
shows that in the absence of a relay, the read rate drops to zero at
a range of 10 m. In contrast, in the presence of a relay, the reader’s
Figure 11: RFly’s detection with range. RFly can detect RFIDs
more than 50 m away from the reader with 100% accuracy in line-
of-sight and 75% in non-line-of-sight. Without the relay, the range
decreases to less than 10 m.
read rate stays at 100% even if the relay is more than 50 m in line-
of-sight. In non-line-of-sight scenarios, the read rate drops to 75%
at a distance of 55 m.
We note few important points about these results:
• These results are not surprising as per Eq. 4. Specifically,
based on §7.1, RFly can achieve more than 70 dB isolation
across each of its sources of self-interference. This translates
to a theoretical range of 83 m in line-of-sight. In non-line-of-
sight environments, it naturally decreases due to attenuation.
• Most of the gain comes from the reader-relay half-link. Specif-
ically, the relay-RFID half-link remains restricted to 3-5 m
since the relay still needs to power up the tag. However, the
reader-relay half link is primarily limited by isolation as de-
scribed in §4.
(b) Localization Accuracy: We mount RFly’s relay on a drone and
run experiments to measure the localization accuracy throughout
the experimental environment detailed above. To obtain an accurate
ground truth for locations, we use the OptiTrack system described
in §6. The system uses infrared-reflective markers on the drone and
the RFIDs in order to measure their exact locations. We ensure that
the drone remains within the field of view of the OptiTrack infrared
cameras. In order to test RFly throughout a large area, we vary
the location of the RFID reader across two floors of our building.
Throughout these experiments, the RFID of interest is placed on the
ground in order to focus on RFly’s ability to perform 2D localization.
To perform localization, RFly utilizes the embedded RFID tag
to disentangle the phase and applies the nonlinear antenna array
equation to compute target tag location in 2D space as described
in §5. We perform coordinate conversion between RFly’s frame
of reference and the OptiTrack’s frame of reference. We compute
the localization error as the difference between the RFly-computed
location and the OptiTrack computed location.
Fig. 12 plots the CDF of the localization error across 100 exper-
imental trials. These results demonstrate that RFly has a median
localization error of 19 cm and a 90th percentile error of 53 cm.
This accuracy is comparable with state-of-the-art localization sys-
tems [44, 45, 48]. Moreover, in contrast to past RFID localization
proposals that are limited in range to within few meters [45, 46],
RFly can achieve this accuracy at 10× the range of past systems.
This is due to the combination of its phase-preserving relay and
through-relay localization algorithm.

across all the experiments.
7.3 How Does Localization Accuracy vary with
Different Parameters?
Next, we would like to understand how RFly’s localization accuracy
varies with two important parameters: flight-path aperture and dis-
tance to an RFID reader. To evaluate the impact of these metrics, we
run controlled microbenchmarks.
(a) Accuracy vs. Flight-path Aperture. Recall from §5.2 that a
longer aperture (i.e., a longer path along which we collect RFID
channel measurements) is expected to enable higher localization
accuracy. This is because a larger aperture results in a narrower
beamwidth for the antenna array. To understand the influence of
aperture on localization accuracy, we vary the aperture provided to
the antenna array equations described in §5.2. We run 20 experiments
in total, each time varying the location of the target RFID but fixing
the average distance between the RFID and the relay. To control
for the range, trajectory, and SNR (signal-to-noise ratio), we mount
RFly’s relay on an iRobot Create 2 [3] and fix the average distance
between the relay and the RFID reader to around 5 m.
Fig. 13 shows the impact of aperture size on localization accu-
racy, plotting the median, 10th, and 90th percentile errors. The plot
demonstrates that the accuracy monotonically improves with in-
creased aperture size. Specifically, with an aperture of 0.5 m, the
median error is around 22 cm. This error decreases to less than 5 cm
with an aperture of 1 m. We notice that the median accuracy does
not improve significantly beyond 1 m; however, the 90th percentile
keeps improving as the aperture size increases, and the error is less
than 7 cm with a 2.5 m aperture.
We also compare RFly’s localization error with an RSSI-based
localization method. We provide the channels of both the relay-
embedded RFID and the target RFID to the RSSI-based technique
and apply the free-space propagation model to the RSS measure-
ments [37] for estimating the distance from the target tag to the
relay. Fig. 13 shows that even with an RSSI-based approach, RFly
achieves reasonable localization accuracy with a median error of
1 m when the aperture is 2.5 m-long. However, the error from the
SAR-based technique is 20× lower, and the resulting accuracy is
high enough to enable warehouse robots to identify the exact shelf
of an RFID-tagged item for robotic manipulation.
(b) Accuracy vs. Range. Next, we would like to study the impact of
the distance on the localization accuracy. To understand the impact
of distance, we adjust the reader’s transmission power (and map it
to the projected distance using the free-space propagation model).
Figure 13: RFly’s localization accuracy vs. aperture size. RFly’s
accuracy improves with a larger aperture.
Figure 14: RFly’s localization accuracy vs. projected distance
from the reader. RFly’s accuracy decreases with distance due to
lower SNR.
We run 50 experiments in total, fixing the aperture size to 1 m.
During each run, we change the location of the RFID tagged object
within the testing area. We test both the SAR-based and RSSI-based
localization techniques through RFly’s relay.
Fig. 14 shows the median, 10th, and 90th percentile errors as
a function of the projected distance. The figure shows that the lo-
calization error becomes larger as the distance increases. This is
expected since a larger distance results in lower SNR, decreasing
RFly’s ability to perform accurate measurements for localization.
However, even at a projected distance of 40 m, RFly’s SAR-based
algorithm can achieve a median error less than 18 cm and a 90th per-
centile error less than 24 cm. Beyond 50 m, the 90th percentile error
in RFly increases to 82 cm. This is because the SNR at this range
