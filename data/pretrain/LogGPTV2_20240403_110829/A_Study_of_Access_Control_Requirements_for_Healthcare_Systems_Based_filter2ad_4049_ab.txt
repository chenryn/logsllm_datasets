### 5. Results

#### 5.1 Basic Numbers
Table 2 provides an overview of the basic user data, including the total number of users, the number with actualization permissions, and the number with emergency access permissions. Out of 16,723 DocuLive users in the health region, 74% (12,298) have been granted actualization permissions, while only 0.25% (41) have emergency access permissions. Notably, emergency access is utilized by only two hospitals in the region, while the others rely solely on actualization.

| No. of Users with Actualization Permission | No. of Users with Emergency Access Permission | Total No. of DocuLive Users |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| 12,298                                     | 41                                              | 16,723                      |
| 74%                                        | 0.25%                                           | 100%                        |

**Table 2: Number of Users and Permissions**

#### 5.2 Is Actualization/Emergency Access Used Sufficiently Infrequently to Be Considered an Exception?
As shown in Table 3, in March 2006, a total of 99,352 distinct patients had their EPRs accessed in some way. Of these, 54,095 (54%) were accessed using actualization. Given that 74% of all users have actualization permissions, it is clear that actualization is not an infrequent occurrence and cannot be considered an exception. This warrants further investigation into how actualization is used.

Emergency access, on the other hand, was used only 67 times, and very few users have this permission. The low numbers make it difficult to draw meaningful conclusions, so the focus will be on actualization. Emergency access, as its name suggests, should always be available, but its use in the studied hospitals does not reflect its intended purpose.

| Actualized EPRs | EPRs Accessed Using Emergency | Total No. of Patients |
|-----------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------|
| 54,095          | 67                             | 99,352                |
| 54%             | 0.07%                          | 100%                  |

**Table 3: Overall Use of Actualization**

Table 4 illustrates the proportions of actualization and emergency access compared to the total number of EPR accesses. One access corresponds to opening one EPR or a folder/document within an EPR. Based on these numbers, 17% of the accesses are based on actualization, with an average of 2.31 accesses per EPR during an actualization period.

| Accesses Using Actualization | Accesses Using Emergency | Total No. of Accesses |
|------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|
| 297,742                      | 67                       | 1,794,153             |
| 17%                          | 0.004%                   | 100%                  |

#### 5.3 Which Users (Roles) Use Actualization the Most?
Table 5 provides an overview of defined roles, the number of users assigned to each role, the percentage of users within each role who have actualization permissions, and the percentage of users within each role who used actualization during the period. Roles with no users assigned actualization permissions (perfusionist, dental health secretary, and acupuncturist) have been excluded.

Assuming that the percentage of actualization assignment reflects the perceived need or requirement for this functionality, it is interesting to note the differences between actualization assignment and use. For example, while 99% of doctors have actualization permissions, only 52% used it. Similarly, 61% of nurses have the permission, but only 22% used it. This suggests that actualization may be assigned to many users who do not regularly need it.

| Role                         | Count | % Assigned Actualization | % Used Actualization |
|------------------------------|-------|--------------------------|----------------------|

**Table 5: Overview of Roles with % Assigned and Use of Actualization Permission**

#### 5.4 Which Wards Use Actualization the Most?
Table 6 shows the usage of actualization across different ward types. The medical ward has the highest frequency of actualization, which is consistent with the fact that 90-95% of patients admitted to this ward require immediate help. In contrast, surgical, anesthesia, and emergency wards have a higher percentage of users with actualization permissions than the actual usage. Out-patient clinics have the highest count of actualizations.

| Ward Type                   | No. of Users | % Assigned Actualization | % Used Actualization |
|-----------------------------|--------------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Medical Ward (18)           | 2,834        | 49.8%                    | 33.2%                |
| Surgical Ward (21)          | 2,150        | 30.3%                    | 27.6%                |
| Anaesthesia Ward (8)        | 629          | 62.6%                    | 47.3%                |
| Emergency Ward (10)         | 482          | 86.9%                    | 75.2%                |
| Out-patient Clinics (43)    | 75           | 99.5%                    | 71.1%                |

**Table 6: Overview of Users Employed at Ward Types with % Assigned and Use of Actualization Permission**

The high number of actualizations in the medical ward is expected, given the nature of the cases they handle. Further investigation is needed to understand the specific needs and contexts in which actualization is used in other wards.
