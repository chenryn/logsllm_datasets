5.1 Some basic numbers
Table 2 contains an overview of basic user data: how
many users in total, how many have actualization permis-
sion and how many have emergency access permission. The
table shows that out of a total of 16723 DocuLive users in
the health region, 74% have been assigned the permission
to actualize EPRs, but only 0,25% have the permission to
use emergency access. Note that emergency access is only
used by two of the hospitals in the region. The others use
only actualization.

5.2 Q1:
Is actualization/emergency ac-
cess used suﬃciently infrequent to be
considered an exception?
As Table 3 illustrates, in March 2006 a total of 99 352
distinct patients were in contact (i.e. their EPR’s were ac-
cessed in some way) with the hospitals in the region. Of
these patients 54% had their EPR accessed using actualiza-
tion. This fact combined with the fact that 74% of all users
are assigned the permission to use actualization indicate that
use of actualization is indeed not an exception. This moti-
vates further investigations as to how actualization is used.
Emergency access is, by comparison, only used 67 times
and only very few users are assigned this permission. The
numbers are therefore so low that they are difﬁcult to use
as a basis for any reasoning. We will therefore focus on the
use of actualization, and only return to emergency access
in the discussion - as in the true meaning of it’s name this
mechanism will probably always need to be present. How-
ever the way this mechanism is used in the hospitals in this
study, as we have explained earlier, does not really reﬂect
on the name emergency access.
Table 4 illustrates the proportions of use of actualization
and emergency access compared to the total number of ac-
cesses in EPR. One access corresponds to opening of one

EPR or a folder or document inside an EPR. Based on these
numbers we ﬁnd that 17% of the accesses are based on ac-
tualization. On average there were registered 2.31 accesses
in an EPR within one actualization period.
5.3 Q2: Which users (roles) use actualiza-
tion access the most?
Table 5 presents an overview of deﬁned roles, number
of users assigned to this role in total, percentage of users
within each role who are assigned actualization permission,
and percentage of users within each role who have used ac-
tualization in the period. Note that we have removed the
roles where no users are assigned actualization permission,
which were a total of three roles: perfusionist, dental health
secretary and acupuncturist.
If we assume that the percentage of actualization assign-
ment for one role reﬂects the current perceived need or re-
quirement for use of this functionality for users within this
role (and possibly also a level of trust in users within this
role) - then it is interesting to take a closer look at the differ-
ences between actualization assignment and use. DocuLive
has been in use since 1998 (from 2002 for the entire region)
so it is reasonable to assume that the distribution of roles
and permissions are fairly stable now. We may then assume
that the percentage of use of actualization reﬂects the actual
needs or requirements of users within a role. If we examine
Table 5 more closely we see that on average the actual per-
centage of use of actualization is signiﬁcantly lower than the
percentage of assignment of actualization. This may lead
to the interpretation that actualization is in fact assigned to
many users that do not need this functionality - at least not
on a regular basis. For instance it seems to be the rule that
all doctors should have permission to actualize - but only
52% of doctors did in fact need to do so within this period.
Of the nurses, who represent the largest group of users by
far, only 22% used actalization - while 61% has the permis-
sion to do so. Thus it would be interesting to further in-
vestigate who of these users, in what situations actually do
require the functionality provided by actualization. How-
ever the log-data does not provide sufﬁcient information,
and would have to be supplemented with other information
- possibly from questionaires, interviews, observations etc.

types with % assigned and use of actualiza-

not covered by a major type were excluded.
5.4 Q3: Which wards use actualization
the most?
From Table 6 we can see that actualization is used rather
frequently at the medical ward2. According to [7], 90-95%
of the patients who are admitted to the medical ward need
immediate help. Only 5-10% are planned patient encoun-
ters. As such, the high number of actualizations for this
ward is unsurprising. It is interesting to note that for the
surgical, anaesthesia and emergency wards the percentage
of users assigned actualization permission is signiﬁcantly
higher than the percentage of actual use. Out-patient clinics
represent the wards with the highest count of actualization
