User: I have to design a interface using PHP for a software written in python. Currently this software is used from command line by passing input, mostly the input is a text file. There are series of steps and for every step a python script is called. Every step takes a text file as input and an generates an output text file in the folder decided by the user. I am using system() of php but I can't see the output but when I use the same command from command line it generates the output. Example of command :
python /software/qiime-1.4.0-release/bin/check_id_map.py -m /home/qiime/sample/Fasting_Map.txt -o /home/qiime/sample/mapping_output -v
Assistant: instead of system() try surrounding the code in `ticks`...
It has a similar functionality but behaves a little differently in the way it returns the output..
