7.2.4 Distribution of nodes and wins
It is insightful to view the tree structure and its induced win-
probability distribution resulting from the Pachira lottree. For our
default parameters, the lottree grows in average up to depth of 25.
Figure 2 (right) shows the distribution of nodes and win proba-
bilities relative to the different levels of the tree (the root level is
0). These CDFs show that Pachira generates a bell-shaped dis-
tribution in which the majority of the nodes are contained in the
middle levels. Relative to the distribution of nodes, the distribution
of win probability is shifted slightly towards the higher levels, re-
ﬂecting the effect of the solicitation incentive that rewards nodes
with many descendents. The ﬁgure shows that our default para-
meters of β = 0.5 and δ = 0.08 strike a subtle balance between
fairness (probability curve follows the node distribution curve) and
solicitation incentive (left shift of the probability curve).
7.2.5 WSI vs. SSI: Stunting and initializing
In the sensitivity analysis of Section 7.2.6, we will show that a
Pachira lottree’s penetration is not signiﬁcantly affected by vary-
ing the solicitation assumption factor SAF, which indicates that the
absence of SSI is not a critical weakness for Pachira. However,
SAF does have an impact on lottree deployment; speciﬁcally, the
SSI property can be violated when the lottree is very small, so low
values of SAF can lead to stunted deployment that never exceeds a
small factor over the initial set size.
Figure 3 (right) shows the probability of stunting with different
values of SAF and different sizes of IS. What we see is that the
probability of achieving sustained growth becomes unity for a suf-
ﬁciently large initial set. At an initSize of 20, no run was ever
stunted. What is particularly interesting to observe is that the criti-
cal initial set size required to guarantee sustained growth crucially
depends on the given SAF. The higher this value, the higher partic-
ipants weigh their marginal perceived gain in terms of WSI rather
than SSI, the smaller an IS sufﬁces. In the extreme case in which
SAF equals one, stunting never occurs.
These observations lead to the conclusion that Pachira’s violation
of SSI weighs particularly heavy when the number of participants
in the tree is small. Empirically, this shows that while Pachira is
not guaranteed to satisfy SSI, such violations occur only at the very
initial state of the lottree’s growth. This shortcoming can therefore
be circumvented by starting the lottree-based motivational deploy-
ment of a networked system with a sufﬁciently large IS.
7.2.6 Sensitivity analysis
Through the above experiments, we have derived β = 0.5 and
δ = 0.08 as our default values for the two Pachira parameters. In
order to verify these choices, we conducted an extensive sensitivity
analysis with regard to all our model parameters and environmental
assumptions. We also evaluated these parameters by substituting
entire model blocks.
(cid:3)

and δ
The sensitivity analysis is based on the following methodology.
We pick a speciﬁc environmental factor (for instance JVT or a pa-
rameter from prospect theory) and vary its value. For each sample
point, we determine (1) the average penetration Pour for this set of
parameters when using Pachira with our own choice of β and δ, and
(2) the average penetration Popt when using the optimal values of β
and δ for this particular point in the parameter space, which we de-
. We then deﬁne the competitive ratio Pour/Popt
noted by β
as the fraction of penetration achieved by β = 0.5 and δ = 0.08
compared to the optimum choice of β and δ for that speciﬁc setting.
operation involves a complex search
over a two-dimensional parameter space in which each random
sample point may experience variance, ﬁnding optimal values for β
and δ given a set of conﬁguration parameters is a computationally
intensive task. For this reason, we have conducted our sensitiv-
ity analysis with a reduced population size of 106. Resorting to
this smaller population is justiﬁed by Figure 2 (left). Our imple-
mentation of the search procedure itself is based on a hill-climbing
algorithm with decreasing step-size.
