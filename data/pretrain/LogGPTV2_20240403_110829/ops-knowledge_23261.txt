User: When tools such as cx_freeze tell you to use a command such as "python setup.py build", where is this command issued? I have tried both the python command line and the Windows command prompt, but neither one worked with inputting that phrase.
Assistant: You issue such commands from the command prompt.  You should make sure that you've changed into the directory containing setup.py before typing the command.
