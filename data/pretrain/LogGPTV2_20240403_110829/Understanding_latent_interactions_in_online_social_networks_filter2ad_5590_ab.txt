Reconstructing Visitor Histories.
Crawling Renren for recent
visitor records is complicated by two things. First, each user’s pro-
ﬁle only lists the last 9 visitors. This means that our crawler must
be constantly revisiting users in order to glean representative data,
as new visitors will cause older visitors to fall off the list. Clearly
we could not crawl every user continuously. Frequent crawls leave
the ID of our crawler on the visitor log of proﬁles, which has gen-
erated unhappy feedback from proﬁle owners. In addition, Ren-
ren imposes multiple per-account rate limits that slow our crawler
signiﬁcantly despite our large number of crawler accounts. Thus,
we designed our crawler to be self-adapting. This means that we
track the popularity and level of dynamics in different user proﬁles,
and allocate most of our requests to heavily trafﬁcked user proﬁles,
while guaranteeing a minimum crawl rate (1/day) for low trafﬁc
users. The individual lists from each crawl contain overlapping re-
sults, which we integrate into a single history.
The second challenge to crawling recent visitor records is that
each visitor is only shown in the list once, even if they visit multiple
times. Repeat visits simply cause that user to return to the top of the
list, erasing their old position. This makes identifying overlapping
sets of visitors from the iterative crawls difﬁcult.
To solve these two challenges, we use a log-integration algorithm
to concatenate the individual recent visitor lists observed during
each successive crawl. More speciﬁcally, some overlapping sets of
visitors exist in successive crawl data, and our main task is to ﬁnd
new visitors and remove overlaps. There are two kinds of incom-
ing visitors: new users, who do not appear in the previous list, and
repeat users, who appear in the prior list at a different relative po-
sition. The ﬁrst kind of incoming visitor is easily identiﬁed, since
his record is completely new to the recent visitor list. New visitors
provide a useful checkpoint for purposes of log-integration, since
other users behind them in the list are also necessarily new incom-
ing visitors. The second type of incoming visitor, repeat users, can
be detected by looking for changes in sequence of the recent visitor
list. If a user repeatedly visits the same proﬁle in-between two visits
of other users, nothing changes in the recent visitor list. Therefore,
consecutive repeat visits are ignored by our crawler.
Figure 2 demonstrates our integration algorithm. We observe
that visitors ABCDEFGHI viewed a user’s proﬁle at some time be-
fore our ﬁrst crawl. New users view the proﬁle and are added to the
recent visitor list by the second crawl at time 2. We re-observe the
old sequence CDEFGHI, and identify JK as new visitors, since JK
do not exist in the previous visitor list. Next, we compare recent
visitor lists at time 2 and 3. We ﬁnd that E is before K in the recent
visitor list crawled at time 2, but this order is changed at time 3.
This means that at some time before the third crawl user E revisited
the target and changed positions in the list. Thus we identify E as
a new visitor. Since C is behind E at time 3, C is also identiﬁed
as a new visitor. Our integration algorithm also works correctly
at time 4. User L has not been observed before, and thus L, plus
subsequent visitors C and M, are all classiﬁed as new visitors.
Overall, from the 61,405 user proﬁles we continuously crawled,
we obtained a total of 8,034,664 total records of visits to user pro-
ﬁles in the PKU network. After integrating these raw results, we
are left with 1,863,168 unique proﬁle visit events. This high reduc-
tion (77%) is because most proﬁles receive few page views, and
thus overlaps between successively crawled results are very high.
Although Renren does not show individual recent visitors of user
diaries and photos, it does display the total number of visits, which
we crawled as well.
Impact of Crawl Frequency. We are concerned that our crawls
might not be frequent enough to capture all visit events to a given
proﬁle. To address this concern, we took a closer look at the im-
pact of crawler frequency on missing visits. First, we take all of the
proﬁles we crawled for visit histories, and computed their average
daily visit count between September and November 2009. We plot
this as a CDF in Figure 3. Most users (99.3%) receive <= 8 visits
per day on average. Since Renren shows 9 latest visitors, crawling
a proﬁle once every day should be sufﬁcient to capture all visits.
While our crawler adapts to allocate more crawl requests to pop-
ular, frequently visited proﬁles, we guarantee that every proﬁle is
crawled at least once every 24 hours.
Next, we select 1,000 random PKU users and crawl their recent
visitors every 15 minutes for 2 days. We use the data collected
to simulate ﬁve frequencies for crawling process, namely 15 min-
utes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 12 hours and 1 day. Then we use the
log-integration algorithm to concatenate the individual recent vis-
itor lists at different crawling frequencies. For every person, we
compute the number of visits missed by the crawler when we re-
duce the frequency, beginning with visits every 15 minutes. We plot
CDF of these deviations in Figure 4. As we see, for 88% of users,
there are no additional visits missed when we reduce the crawler
rate from once every 15 minutes to once per day. Only for a very
small group of users (0.7%) is the number of missing visits greater
than 10 when crawling at once per day. Figure 3 also shows that
less than 0.7% of all users receive more than 9 visits per day. Only
these users would require more than one crawl per day to collect a
full history of their visits. Since we allocate the bulk of our crawler
requests to these high popularity users (and crawl once per day for

2.4 Social Graph Analysis
In this section, we analyze the topological properties of the en-
tire Renren social graph by focusing on salient graph measures.
Table 1 shows some general properties of Renren, such as average
degree, clustering coefﬁcient, assortativity, and average path length
as compared to other social networks. Our Renren dataset is larger
than most previously studied OSN datasets, the exceptions being
recent measurements of the Twitter network [4, 16]. However, our
dataset shares similar properties with prior studies [7, 22, 29]. This
conﬁrms that Renren is a representative social network, and the be-
havior of its users is likely to be indicative of users in other OSNs
like Facebook.
Figure 5 plots the complementary cumulative distribution func-
tion (CCDF) of user social degrees in the Renren network, and
shows that Renren’s network structure roughly follows a power-
law [2]. We compute that the power-law curve ﬁtting the social
degree CCDF has an alpha value of 3.5, with ﬁtting error of 0.02.
This alpha value is signiﬁcantly higher than that found for Face-
book (1.5), Orkut (1.5), and Twitter (2.4).
We also look at Renren’s clustering coefﬁcient, which assesses
the level of local connectivity between nodes. In undirected graphs,
the clustering coefﬁcient of a person is deﬁned as the ratio of the
number of links over all possible connections between one’s friends.
The clustering coefﬁcient of the entire network is deﬁned by the
average of all individual clustering coefﬁcients. Renren’s average
clustering coefﬁcient is only 0.063, implying that Renren friend
relationships are more loosely connected than the other social net-
works studied in Table 1. Figure 6 displays the distribution of clus-
tering coefﬁcient versus node degree. As expected for a social net-
work, users with lower social degrees have higher clustering coef-
ﬁcients, thus demonstrating high levels of clustering at the edge of
the social graph.
The assortativity coefﬁcient measures the probability for users to
establish links to other users of similar degree [29]. It is calculated
as the Pearson correlation coefﬁcient of the degrees of node pairs
for all links in a graph. A positive assortativity coefﬁcient indicates
that users tend to connect to other users of similar degree, and a
negative value indicates the opposite trend. Renren’s assortativity
is 0.15, implying that connections between like-degree users are
numerous. Figure 7 displays node degree correlation (knn) versus
node degree. knn is a closely related metric to assortativity. The
positive correlation starting around degree 100 demonstrates that
higher-degree users tend to establish links with other high-degree
users. These chains of well-connected super-users form the back-
bone of the social network.
Average path length is the average of all-pairs-shortest-paths in
the social network. It is simply not tractable to compute shortest
path for all node pairs, given the immense size of our social graph.
Instead, we choose 1000 random users in the network, perform Di-
jkstra to build a spanning tree for each user in the social graph,
and compute the length of their shortest paths to all other users
in the network. As shown in Table 1, the average path length in
Renren is 5.38, which agrees with the six-degrees of separation hy-
pothesis [20]. It is not surprising to see that average path length is

Figure 9: CDF of user proﬁle popularity deﬁned by visits
longer in Renren than prior results from Facebook [29], since those
path lengths were computed over smaller subgraphs representing
regional networks. It is surprising, however, when we compare it
to results from Cyworld [7], since the two networks are similar in
size and completeness. One reasonable explanation is that con-
nectivity between Internet users in the Cyworld network is much
stronger than connectivity between users in the Renren network.
Strongly Connected Component Analysis.
User’s online
friendship links often correspond closely with their ofﬂine relation-
ships [17]. Thus, it is natural to assume that college students would
have many online friends in the same campus network. This be-
havior should manifest itself as a single, large, strongly connected
component (SCC) that includes most users in the PKU network so-
cial graph. Surprising, we ﬁnd that 23,430 (23.2%) of users in the
PKU network have no friends in the PKU campus network, and
are therefore disconnected from the SCC. We refer to these as iso-
lated users. To conﬁrm these results, we measured the SCC of 9
other large university networks and discovered similar numbers of
isolated users.
Figure 8 shows social degrees and total number of proﬁle vis-
its for these isolated users. 83% of isolated users have social de-
grees less than 10. In addition, 70% of isolated users have less than
20 total proﬁle visits, meaning their proﬁles are rarely browsed by
others. These isolated users likely abandoned their accounts soon
after registration, and did not have enough time to establish links
with friends within the campus network. Further analysis into the
behavior and activities of these isolated users is the subject of on-
going work.
