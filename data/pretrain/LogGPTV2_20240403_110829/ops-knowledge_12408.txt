User:  In a Kubernetes cluster, how to use Ingress and Service objects to implement application routing and load balancing?
Assistant: 1. Create an Ingress object First, you need to create an Ingress object to define the routing rules of the application. Here is an example of a simple Ingress definition: apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: Ingress metadata: name: my-app spec: rules: - host: my-app.example.com http: paths: - path: / pathType: Prefix backend: service: name: my-app-service port: name: http This Ingress definition specifies to route HTTP requests to the root path of my-app.example.com to a Service object named my-app-service , and use the port named http in it. In addition, it also specifies the pathType as a prefix, which means that all requests starting with / will be routed to my-app-service. 2. Create a Service object Next, you need to create a Service object to define the load balancing rules for the application. The following is a simple Service definition example: apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: my-app-service spec: selector: app: my-app ports: - name: http protocol: TCP port: 80 targetPort: 8080 The Service The definition specifies that Pods are selected via the selector app=my-app and that they are load balanced to a port named http. This port will be routed to port 8080 in the Pod. 3. Configure DNS resolution To make the Ingress object take effect, the domain name (such as my-app.example.com) needs to be resolved to the load balancer in the cluster. You can use the Cloud Provider's load balancer, or you can use an external load balancer such as NGINX. 4. Test routing and load balancing After completing the above steps, you can test the routing and load balancing of the application by visiting my-app.example.com. When a request is sent to the load balancer, it forwards the request to an available Pod and then returns the response from that Pod. Multiple Pods can be expanded by adding replicas in Deployment or StatefulSet.
