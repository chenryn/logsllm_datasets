If you look at the provided example you will see that it attempts to make use
of ng-content and that it does not work. The reason it does not work seems to
be that it is attempting to use the contents of the root component which
appears in the index.html. However, as soon as an intermediary component is
introduced, as in this example:

Then the ng-content works correctly.
Also, and this is basically lumping two things together into one, shouldn't
ng-content have become ngContent just as ngIf, ngFor, etc. did?
