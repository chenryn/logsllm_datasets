Apache Server at www.mywebsite.com Port 80


I can't find any error message on access or error log. Not only mentioned page, getting error on most of the page even html. Please help me to resolve this issue.

Assistant: For debian you could do as root:

# grep -ir "mod_evasive" /etc/apache2/


or for CentOS you could do:

# grep -ir "mod_evasive" /etc/httpd/


Or the slowest but 100% working grep on all distributions is:

# grep -ir "mod_evasive" /


And let's see what it returns.
