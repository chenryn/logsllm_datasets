# The Flattening Internet Topology: An Analysis of Content Provider Networks

## 1. Introduction
This study investigates the trend of large content providers, such as Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo!, deploying their own Wide Area Networks (WANs). We analyze the network paths to top sites, focusing on the number of Tier-1 hops, the connectedness of each site, and the geographic distribution of entry points into these networks.

### 1.1 Methodology
We used traceroute to measure the network paths from various vantage points to the top content providers. Our analysis includes metrics such as the average number of Tier-1 hops, the number of paths with no Tier-1 hops, and the degree of connectedness for each content provider.

## 2. Results

### 2.1 Network Paths and Tier-1 Hops
Figure 1 shows the results for three key metrics:

- **Figure 1(a)**: Average number of Tier-1 hops per path.
- **Figure 1(b)**: Number of paths with no Tier-1 hops.
- **Figure 1(c)**: Connectedness of each site.

#### 2.1.1 Average Tier-1 Hops
Our traceroute probes revealed that some sites, particularly the "big three" (Microsoft, Yahoo!, and Google), had significantly fewer Tier-1 hops compared to others. This suggests that these content providers have more direct connections, reducing the number of intermediary networks.

#### 2.1.2 Paths with No Tier-1 Hops
For the "big three" content providers, at least 60% of the paths (30 out of 50) contained no Tier-1 hops. This indicates a high level of direct connectivity, likely due to extensive peering agreements and private network infrastructure.

#### 2.1.3 Connectedness
The degree of connectedness for each content provider was also examined. Microsoft, Google, and Yahoo! were found to connect to at least 24, 23, and 18 different Autonomous Systems (ASes), respectively. This is in stark contrast to other content providers like MySpace, which only connects to six ASes.

### 2.2 Geographic Distribution
Figure 2 illustrates the geographic distribution of entry points into the WANs of selected content providers:

- **Figure 2(a)**: Location of network endpoints in the United States.
- **Figure 2(b)**: Entry points into Googleâ€™s current WAN.

Google's network spans across multiple continents, with entry points in 10 North American cities, four European, two Asian, and one South American location. This extensive reach underscores Google's significant investment in its network infrastructure.

## 3. Discussion

### 3.1 Implications for Content Providers
Deploying extensive network infrastructures allows content providers to gain greater control over network-related issues, deploy applications that require high performance, and reduce reliance on external providers. However, the cost of deploying, operating, and maintaining such infrastructure is substantial.

### 3.2 Implications for Users
Users may benefit from better quality of service and access to new applications and services. However, if smaller content providers are unable to compete, the diversity of content could decrease, potentially stifling creativity.

### 3.3 Implications for ISPs
Tier-1 ISPs may need to adapt to this trend by vertically integrating, offering content services, or implementing new functionalities. While the need for Tier-1 ISPs may not disappear, the trend could lead to lower costs for them as they may not need to increase network capacity as frequently.

## 4. Related Work
Our study builds on previous work in Internet topology measurements and tools such as Rocketfuel and Paris Traceroute. We also consider the broader context of evolving Internet architecture and the need for change within the current static framework.

## 5. Conclusions
Our findings suggest that the Internet topology is becoming flatter as large content providers rely less on Tier-1 ISPs and peer with a larger number of lower-tier ISPs. Future work will involve increasing the breadth of the study, conducting longitudinal studies, and considering alternative metrics to better understand this trend.
