User: I created a Hello World website in Google App Engine. It is using Django 1.1 without any patch.
Even though it is just a very simple web page, it takes long time and often it times out.
Any suggestions to solve this?
Note: It is responding fast after the first call.
Assistant: One more tip which might increase the response time.
Enabling billing does increase the quotas, and, to my personal experience, increase the overall response of an application as well. Probably because of the higher priority for billing-enabled applications google has. For instance, an app with billing disabled, can send up to 5-10 emails/request, an app with billing enabled easily copes with 200 emails/request.
Just be sure to set low billing levels - you never know when Slashdot, Digg or HackerNews notices your site :)
