User: I find myself opening the interactive shell nearly every time I launch Eclipse. To save my lazy self a few extra clicks every day, I started wonder: is there is a way to get an interactive console to open automatically on start-up of Eclipse/PyDev?
Thanks!
Assistant: Currently not... please enter a feature request for that (it should be relatively straightforward adding a preference where you can choose an interpreter which would be used to open an interactive console when you open Eclipse).
