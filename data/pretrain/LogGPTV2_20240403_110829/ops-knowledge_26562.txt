User: I am running python 2.7.1.  I can't figure out how to launch the IDLE IDE.  I am told it comes already installed with python, but I can't find it using spotlight.
Assistant: The answer of Matthewm1970 works like a charm!
And if you add an & to your shell command, the automation script will end immediately. There is no spinning gear. Like so:

/usr/local/bin/idle3.5&

Note the ampersand.
Cheers.
