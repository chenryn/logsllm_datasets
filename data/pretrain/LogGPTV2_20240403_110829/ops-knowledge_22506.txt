User: In order to ensure the reliability and fault tolerance of the application, you will consider using load balancing and failover technology, so please provide a feasible solution and explain how it works.
Assistant: feasible load balancing and failover technical solution includes: 1. Set up multiple application servers, each server runs the same application program, and use a load balancer to distribute requests to different servers. 2. Each server interacts with the same database, using master-slave replication technology to achieve failover functionality. Among them, one server acts as the master server and handles all write requests and update requests, while the other servers act as slave servers and handle read requests. When the master server goes down, the slave server detects the failure and automatically switches to the master server to ensure the continuity of the application. 3. Use virtual IP technology to achieve high availability. There is a virtual IP between the application server and the database server, and the client's request will be sent to this virtual IP first. If the master server fails, after the slave server becomes the master server, the virtual IP will automatically send the request to the new master server, realizing the high availability of the whole system. Working principle: 1. Load balancer: First, the client sends a request to the load balancer, and the load balancer will distribute the request to the application server according to the set policy. Wherein, the strategy may be polling, random selection or selection according to the load condition of the server. 2. Master-slave replication: the master server is responsible for write operations, and the slave server is responsible for read operations. The master server will synchronously copy the data of the write operation to the slave server to ensure that the data of the slave server is consistent with the master server. If the primary server fails, the secondary server automatically detects the failure, promotes to the primary server, and takes over its responsibilities. 3. Virtual IP: There is a virtual IP between the application server and the database server. When the master server fails, the slave server is upgraded to the master server, and the same virtual IP is allocated on it to ensure the continuity of client requests.
