User: I need to change my computer's local date to an earlier date (e.g. 2010). I couldnt do that in BIOS. Does anybody know how to do this task, for example by writing a Python snippet?
Thanks.
Assistant: If you are not permitted to do this via the operating system, then you will not be permitted to do it from a scripting language like Python, either.
