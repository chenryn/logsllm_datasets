User: Is it possible to run Tornado such that it listens to a local port (e.g. localhost:8000). I can't seem to find any documentation explaining how to do this.
Assistant: Once you've defined an application (like in the other answers) in a file (for example server.py), you simply save and run that file.
python server.py
