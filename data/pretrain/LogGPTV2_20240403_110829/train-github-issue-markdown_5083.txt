This issue formalizes @pcwalton's RFC on the mailing list. This was also
discussed in the 2013-05-14 meeting and in #6087. Steps towards this have
already been made in #6462.
Whilst this is not a high priority change at the moment (understandably there
are far bigger fish to fry), this is a semi-common question on the IRC and I
think it's good if we have some place to redirect questions to.
Instead of the current:
    Real::pi::()
this change would allow you to do:
    float::pi()
or
    type T = float;
    T::pi()
This could also allow for neat things like a generic `SizeOf` trait:
`T::size_of()`, which is far nicer than the current `size_of::()`. Or maybe
there could be an `Init` trait for default initializers: `T::init()`.
