The current output of `ClearStacktrace.jl` is pretty good. I just wonder if
the same technique discussed in #36026 can be used on how methods are printed
in `methods` and `methodswith`? Considering the different result types of
them, maybe we need to redefine how methods are shown?
    julia> methodswith(Int) |> typeof
    Array{Method,1}
    julia> methods(Int) |> typeof
    Base.MethodList
