▪ What are sources of security?
▪ Global bug-bounty market size projected to reach $5.5 billion by 2027
▪ Manifests the ‘many eyes’ theory of security
▪ Increasing adoption by government agencies and departments
▪ Proliferation of bug-bounty platform companies
▪ Governed by Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure processes (CVD)

Not So 
Good CVD
December 22, 2021: China’s MIIT suspends Alibaba Cloud from an information-
sharing partnership for failing to disclose l4s to the MIIT prior to DEC9, when they 
received notice from a 3rd party.
•
Per the Wall Street Journal and an anonymous source: suspension was a consequence of 
breach of contract in the info-sharing partnership.
•
Per other reporting:* suspension was a consequence of violating The Regulations on 
Management of Security Vulnerabilities (RMSV).

• Specific enforcement mechanism aside, failure to disclose earlier to the MIIT was 
the cause of the suspension, and the letter of the RMSV was breached.

Vulnerability 
Research
11
Very little reporting on the RMSV when it was passed or took effect, big questions about 
application to multinational companies.
•
Only known (possible) RMSV enforcement is on Alibaba Cloud for l4s.
•
Most coverage concerned with what happens to vulnerabilities after the MIIT gets early access.
•
Not the focus of this research.
Convenient case study when searching for supply-shocks to international vulnerability 
research
•
Potential for a chilling effect on China’s research contributions:
•
Hesitation to report vulnerabilities until more legal clarity?
•
Internal policy changes regarding accepting vulnerability reports from China?
•
Clear before and after dates
•
Large potential impact:
•
China is a significant contributor to international vulnerability research

Practices 
and 
Reporting 
Laws
12
A lack of clear legal protections for researchers has caused problems globally:
•
German researcher (almost) charged for reporting flaws in campaign app
•
Missouri tried to charge a researcher for reading HTML
Some good developments here recently:
•
DOJ declining to prosecute good-faith research
•
ENISA push for member governments to develop CVD policies
•
CISA BOD for agencies to develop reporting systems

Research 
Question
13
Did the RMSV cause a supply shock in China’s research contributions?
•
If so, did that shock trickle into the overall supply of research contributions?
•
Do other shocks occur correlated to unidentified events?
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents
Information Classification: General
Research 
Question
14
Added insights: 
•
Better look at external contributions to vulnerability reporting
•
Possible to look at density-distribution of contributors as well
Datasets: Acknowledgements from different CVE and security update databases 
from Microsoft, Apple, F5, VMWare, and Red Hat
•
Looking across vendors to try to tease out product and ecosystem trends
•
Get variety of internal practices for crediting explicitly or anonymously and for organizing data (by 
CVE, by update batch, by vulnerability batch, etc.)
•
Open source and proprietary codebases

Some quirks:
Can’t compare between datasets directly because of overlap in CVEs.
Apple security updates often predate listed dates for CVEs found on NVD, Tenable, etc., and are 
organized by software update.
Unclear where credits are all for vulnerability discovery or demonstration of vulnerability application of a 
specific product.
Batching by month adds noise.
Not clear how the delay between private reporting and public patching and acknowledgement plays 
out.
