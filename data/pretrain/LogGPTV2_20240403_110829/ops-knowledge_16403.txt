Question: Alice and Bob are communicating over an insecure channel and need to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and authentication of their messages. Which cryptographic primitives should they use to achieve these goals?
"A": "Symmetric-key encryption for confidentiality, MACs for integrity and authentication.",
"B": "Public-key encryption for confidentiality, digital signatures for integrity and authentication.",
"C": "Key exchange schemes for confidentiality, cryptographic hashes for integrity.",
"D": "Pseudo random number generator for confidentiality, key exchange schemes for authentication."
Answer: AB
