## Abstract
The dynamics of interdomain routing have traditionally been studied through the analysis of BGP update traffic. However, such studies often focus on the volume of BGP updates rather than their effects and tend to be local rather than global in scope. To study the global state of the Internet routing system over time, new methods are required. In this paper, we introduce a new metric, Multiple Next-hop Routing State Distance (MRSD), which measures the similarity between two prefixes with respect to the state of the global routing system. By applying this metric over time, we can measure how the set of total paths to each prefix varies at a given timescale. We implement this analysis method in a MapReduce framework and apply it to a dataset of more than 1TB, collected daily over three distinct years and monthly over eight years. Our results reveal that approximately 1% of next-hop decisions in the Internet change daily, with 10% changing monthly and 50% changing over two years. We also decompose next-hop decision changes into two classes: churn and structural (persistent) change. Structural changes show a strong 7-day periodicity and represent about two-thirds of the total changes.

## 1. Introduction
Understanding the interdomain routing system is crucial for its stability, scalability, and security. However, comprehending the overall structure of interdomain routing and its evolution over time is particularly challenging due to the system's immense size, complexity, and continuous growth. Currently, there are no metrics that provide useful information about the rate of routing changes in the interdomain routing system. Such metrics could help understand the impact of de-peering disputes, link failures, and other events that affect the global routing structure of the Internet.

To address this challenge, we focus on characterizing the rate of change in the routing system and the dynamics of these changes, both globally and over long timescales. Unlike most prior work, which has focused on specific aspects of Internet routing, our approach aims to capture the overall dynamics of the system. We propose a new metric, MRSD, to measure the similarity between two prefixes with respect to the state of the global routing system. This metric allows us to analyze the changes in the set of total paths to each prefix over time.

Our approach moves away from studying the system in terms of AS topology and instead focuses on the fundamental next-hop decisions made by each AS. This avoids the problems associated with interpreting BGP update messages, which can be difficult to interpret in a global context. The MRSD metric is an improvement over the original Routing State Distance (RSD) and is applicable to a wider range of routing systems while capturing the same concept. We refer to the application of MRSD over time as Temporal RSD (TRSD).

We apply TRSD to a large corpus of BGP data, including BGP Routing Information Bases (RIBs) from the Route Views and RIPE measurement projects. Our results show that approximately 1% of all visible next-hop decisions change daily, 10% monthly, and 50% over two years. These values remain remarkably constant despite the significant changes and growth in the network. We also decompose the daily TRSD time series into sustained (policy-driven) changes and churn (temporary changes). About two-thirds of the daily changes are sustained, with the remaining one-third classified as churn. Sustained changes show a strong weekly periodicity, while churn is more random. Additionally, we find that a small fraction of ASes are responsible for the majority of changes to next-hop decisions.

## 2. Related Work
Our study differs from or builds on prior work in several ways:

- **BGP Instability Measurement:** Prior work has focused on the stability of the interdomain routing system, including studies of BGP message dynamics and stability. However, these studies do not emphasize the global evolution of routing decisions.
- **Long-term Internet Evolution:** Some studies have looked at global properties of the AS-level Internet over multi-year timescales, focusing on economic roles and relationships between ASes. Our work complements these studies by focusing on the rate of change in routing and the nature of routing churn.
- **Routing State Distance:** The original RSD metric was used in previous studies, but it assumes a unique next-hop for each node. Our MRSD metric generalizes RSD to handle multiple next-hops and is applicable to a wider range of routing systems.

## 3. Notation and Definitions
In this section, we define the metrics used to analyze changes in the global routing system.

### 3.1 Multiple Next-hop RSD
The starting point is the notion of Routing State Distance (RSD) as defined in [7]. RSD measures the 'distance' between two destinations (e.g., prefixes) as the number of nodes that choose different next-hops for the two destinations. However, RSD assumes each node has a unique next-hop, which is not the case in interdomain routing.

To address this, we define Multiple Next-hop Routing State Distance (MRSD). MRSD allows next-hop decisions to be expressed as sets and uses Jaccard distance to compare these sets. Formally, let \( G(V, E) \) be a directed graph where \( V \) is a set of vertices and \( E \) is the set of edges. For all source-destination pairs \( (u, v) \in V \times V \), we define \( N_{u,v} \) as the set of next-hops from \( u \) to \( v \). MRSD then compares the next-hop sets using Jaccard distance, providing a more robust and generalizable metric for studying routing changes.
