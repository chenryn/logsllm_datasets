User: Is that possible to redirect to another url with a delay in GAE? I know I can use JavaScript for this purpose, but may be there is a way to do delayed redirection without it?
Now I use self.redirect("/") from GAE tutorial.
Thanks.
Assistant: You can use the <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="x;url=http://yoururl/"> tag where x is the number of seconds to wait before redirect.
This tag would go in <head> part of the generated page.
