We encountered an issue with the keep-alive functionality not working as expected. We were utilizing the `AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin` in an abstract `State` class. Due to the `@mustCallSuper` annotation, we were aware of the need to call `super.build` within the `build` method of the abstract class. However, there was no warning or indication that `super.build` was not being called in the concrete implementations of our abstract `State` class.

I cannot foresee a scenario where it would be desirable for the `@mustCallSuper` annotation to not extend to all transitive subclasses. Ensuring that `super.build` is called in all subclasses is crucial for maintaining the intended behavior and avoiding subtle bugs.
