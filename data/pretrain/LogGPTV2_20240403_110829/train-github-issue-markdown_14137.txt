We ran into an issue with keep alives not working. We were using the
`AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin` in an abstract `State` class. Because of the
`@mustCallSuper` annotation, we knew to call `super.build` in the `build`
method of the abstract class. However, there was no warning for the fact that
we weren't calling `super.build` in the concrete implementations of our
abstract `State` class.
I can't envision a case where you wouldn't want the annotation to extend to
all transitive subclasses.
