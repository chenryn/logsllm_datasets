A DEFENSE
In this section, we demonstrate the defense methodology in detail
(Appendix A.1), discuss about visualization results (Appendix A.2),
and analyze the impacts of Popularity Randomization on original
recommendation performances (Appendix A.3).
A.1 Methodology
In the original setting in Section 2.5, non-members are provided
with the most popular items. However, the most popular items for
different users are the same, resulting in that feature vectors of non-
members are extremely similar and easily distinguished. To address
this problem, an intuitive way is to increase the randomness of non-
members’ recommendations. In the paper, we propose a defense
mechanism named Popularity Randomization. Specifically, a larger
number of the most popular items are first selected as candidates.
Then, we conduct a random selection, i.e., we randomly pick 10%
of candidates as recommendations for non-members. Note that all
recommendations for non-members are still the most popular items.
In that case, recommendations to different non-members are diverse
and thus the similarities among non-members’ feature vectors are
decreased. The above defense strategy can be formulated as follows:
First, a recommender system A𝑅𝑆 sorts all items by popularity,
i.e.,
A𝑅𝑆 : D𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙
𝑆𝑜𝑟𝑡−→ S𝑠𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑒𝑑,
where D𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙 is the original dataset and 𝑆𝑜𝑟𝑡−→ is to sort items by
popularity. And S𝑠𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑒𝑑 is an ordered sequence, including all items
from D𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙. In S𝑠𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑒𝑑, higher items are more popular.
Second, based on the number of recommendations and the pre-
set ratio, the recommender system selects a number of the most
popular items as candidates, which can be defined as the following
functions:
𝛼𝑃𝑅 =
𝑁𝑟𝑒𝑐
𝑁𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑑
,
S𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑑 = {𝑥|𝑥 ∈ S𝑠𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑒𝑑, 𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑥 ≤ 𝑁𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑑},
where 𝛼𝑃𝑅 is the ratio of recommendations to candidates. S𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑑 is
a sequence containing all candidates selected by the recommender
system from S𝑠𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑒𝑑. 𝑁𝑟𝑒𝑐 and 𝑁𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑑 are the numbers of the rec-
ommendations and the candidates. And 𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑥 is the index of 𝑥 in
S𝑠𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑒𝑑.
Finally, non-members are randomly provided with items from
candidates as recommendations, which can be defined as the fol-
lowing function:
𝑓 (S𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑑) = R𝑜𝑢𝑡
(|R𝑜𝑢𝑡| = 𝑁𝑟𝑒𝑐),
where 𝑓 (S𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑑) is to randomly select recommendations fromS𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑑.
And |R𝑜𝑢𝑡|, which is equal to 𝑁𝑟𝑒𝑐, is the number of recommenda-
tions to non-members.
Figure 13: Comparisons of recommendation performances
before against after deploying the defense mechanism.
A.2 Visualization Results
In this section, we visualize user feature vectors by t-SNE to show
the differences of the distributions between members and non-
members in the shadow and target datasets. In Figure 14, the red
points represent feature vectors of members and the blue points
denote feature vectors of non-members. We conclude from the
comparison between Figure 14a and Figure 14b that Popularity
Randomization can decrease the differences between the feature
vectors of members and non-members, and hinder the attack perfor-
mance considerably. We find a similar phenomenon in Figure 14c
and Figure 14d. These visualization results show the effectiveness
of Popularity Randomization.
Moreover, as Figure 12 shows, with the defense mechanism, the
attack against LFM can only reach comparable performances with
Random Guess. In contrast, when the target algorithm is Item, the
attack achieves strong performances. To explain this, as Figure 14a
and Figure 14c shows, the areas of the red and blue points rarely
overlap when using Item. However, there exist many red points
in the area of the blue points when using LFM, leading to a poor
attack performance.
A.3 Impacts on Recommendation
Performances
We next investigate the impacts on the performance of the target
recommender with Popularity Randomization. In Figure 13, the re-
sults show that the performances of the recommender only slightly
drops. For instance, when the target recommender uses Item on
the ml-1m dataset, Popularity Randomization only achieves a 2%
drop in the recommendation performance. Therefore, our proposed
defense strategy can mitigate the attack risk effectively while pre-
serving the original recommendation performances.
