the characteristics of each of the trending terms. First, we classify
the trending terms into categories using Google Insights for Search,
which assigns arbitrary search terms to the most likely category, out
of the same 27 categories used for constructing the control sample
described in Section 2.1 above.
Second, Google offers a free service called Trafﬁc Estimator that
estimates for any phrase the number of global monthly searches
averaged over the past year [14]. For trending terms, averaging over
the course of a year signiﬁcantly underestimates the search trafﬁc
when a term is peaking in popularity. Fortunately, Google also
offers a measure of the relative popularity of terms through Google
Trends [15], provided at the granularity of one week. The relative
measure is normalized against the average number of searches for

the past year, precisely the ﬁgure returned by the Trafﬁc Estimator.
We obtain the peak-popularity estimate Pop(s) for a term s by
multiplying the relative estimate for the week when the term peaked
by the absolute long-run popularity estimate.
The Google Trafﬁc Estimator also indicates the advertising value
of trending terms, by providing estimates of the anticipated cost per
click (CPC) for keywords. We collect the CPC for all trending and
control terms. Many trending terms are only brieﬂy popular and
return the minimum CPC estimate of US$0.05. We use the CPC to
approximate the relative revenue that might be obtained for search
results on each term. The CPC is a natural proxy for the prospective
advertising value of user trafﬁc because websites that show ads are
likely to present ads similar to the referring term.
Empirical analysis. Table 4 breaks down the relative prevalence
of trending terms, and their abuse, by category. Over half of the
terms fall into three categories – Entertainment, Sports and Local.
These categories feature topics that change frequently and brieﬂy
rise from prior obscurity. 18% of trending terms include malware
in their results, while 38% feature MFA websites in at least 1% of
the top 10 results.
We observe some variation in malware and MFA incidence across
categories. However, perhaps the most striking result from exam-
ining the table is that all categories are targeted, irrespective of the
category’s propensity to “trendiness.” Miscreants do not seem to
be specializing yet by focusing on particular keyword categories.
If we instead look at popularity and ad prices, substantial differ-
ences emerge. Figure 4 shows how the incidence of malware and
MFA varies according to the peak popularity and ad price of the
trending term. The left-most graph shows how malware varies ac-
cording to the term’s peak popularity. The least popular terms (less
than 1 000 searches per day at their peak) attract the most malware
in their top results. 38% of such terms include malware, while 9%

Figure 4: Exploring how popularity and ad price of trending terms affects the prevalence of malware (left) and ad-laden sites (right).
of these terms include malware that is not initially detected. As
terms increase in peak popularity, fewer are afﬂicted by malware:
only 6.2% of terms with peak popularity greater than 100 000 daily
searches include malware in their results, and only 2% of terms
include malware that is not immediately detected. A similar pat-
tern follows for malware incidence according to the term’s ad price.
30% of terms with ad prices under 10 cents per click had malware
in their results, compared to 8.8% of terms with ad prices greater
than $1 per click.
A greater fraction of terms overall include MFA websites in their
results than malware (37% vs. 19%). Consequently, all proportions
are larger in the two graphs on the right side of Figure 4. 60% of
terms with peak popularity of less than 1 000 daily searches include
MFA sites in their results. This proportion drops steadily until only
17.4% of terms attracting over 100 000 daily visits include MFA
in the top 10 search results. A similar reduction can be seen for
varying ad prices in the right-most ﬁgure. The two right ﬁgures
show the percentage of all terms that have MFA, followed by the
percentage of top 10 results that are MFA, for only those terms that
have MFA terms present. Here we can see that the percentages
remain relatively steady irrespective of term popularity and price.
For unpopular terms, 10% of their results point to MFA, dropping
modestly to 8% for the most popular terms. The drop is more sig-
niﬁcant for ad prices – from 10% to 6%. Consequently, while the
success in appearing in results diminishes with popularity and ris-
ing ad prices, when a term does have MFA, a similar proportion of
its results are polluted.
Of course, ad prices and term popularity are correlated – more
popular search terms tend to attract higher ad prices, and vice versa.
Consequently, we use linear regression to disentangle the effect
both have on the prevalence of abuse.
Because the dependent variable is binary in the case of malware
(either the term has malware present or does not), we use a logit
model for the regression of the following form:
logit(pHasMalware) = β + AdPricex1 + log2(Popularity)x2
We also ran a logit regression with the term’s categories, but none
of the category values were statistically signiﬁcant. Thus, we have
settled on this simpler model. The results of the regression reveal
that a term’s ad price and search popularity are both negatively cor-
related with the presence of malware in a term’s search results, and
the relationship is statistically signiﬁcant:

These coefﬁcients mean that a $1 increase in the ad price cor-
responds to a 40% decrease in the odds of having malware in the
term’s results. Likewise, when the popularity of a term doubles, the
odds of having malware in the term’s results decreases by 11%.
We also devised a linear regression using the fraction of a term’s
top 10 results classiﬁed as MFA as the dependent variable:
FracTop10MFA = β+AdPricex1+log2(Popularity)x2+Categoryx3 .
The Category variable is encoded as a 27-part categorical variable
using deviation coding. Deviation coding is used to measure each
categories’ deviation from the overall mean value, rather than devi-
ations across categories.
For this regression, the term’s ad price and search popularity are
both statistically signiﬁcant and negatively correlated with the frac-
tion of a trending term’s top 10 results classiﬁed as MFA:

A $1 increase in the ad price corresponds to a 0.9% decrease in
the MFA rate, while a doubling in the popularity of a search term
matches a 0.4 percentage point decrease. This may not seem much,
but recall that, on average, 6.6% of a term’s top 10 results link to
MFA sites. A 0.9% decrease in MFA prevalence represents a 13.2%
decrease from the average rate.
Each of the coefﬁcients listed in the right-most column in Table 4
are statistically signiﬁcant (all have p values less than 0.001, except
Local, Health, and Automotive, where p < 0.05). For instance,
Food & Drink terms correspond to a 1 percentage point increase in
the rate of MFA domains in their top 10 results, while Reference
terms suffer a 2% higher MFA rate.
Implications of analysis. The results just presented demonstrate
that, for both malware and MFA sites, miscreants are struggling to
successfully target the more lucrative terms. An optimistic inter-
pretation is that defenders manage to relegate the abuse to the more
obscure terms that have less overall impact. A more pessimistic
interpretation is that miscreants are having success in the tail of hot
terms, which are more difﬁcult to eradicate.
It is not very surprising that malware tends to be located in the
results of terms that demand lower ad prices, given that higher ad
prices do not beneﬁt malware distribution. However, it is quite
unexpected that the prevalence of MFA terms is negatively cor-
related with a term’s ad price, since those promoting MFA sites
would much prefer to appear in the search results of more expensive
terms. One reason why malware and MFA appears less frequently
on pages with higher ad prices could be that there is stronger legiti-
mate competition in these results than for results fetching lower ad
prices.

for trending terms.
Furthermore, there is a potential incentive conﬂict for search en-
gines to eradicate ad-laden sites, when many of the pages run ad-
vertisements for the ad platforms maintained by the search engines.
It is therefore encouraging that the evidence suggests that search
engines do a better job at expelling MFA sites from the results of
terms that attract higher ad prices.
Finally, the data helps to answer an important question: are mal-
ware and ad abuse websites competitors, or do they serve different
parts of the market? The evidence suggests that, in terms of being
a technique to monetize search trafﬁc, malware and MFA behave
more like substitutes, rather than complements. Both approaches
