ABSTRACT
Diagnosing a large-scale sensor network is a crucial but challenging
task due to the spatiotemporally dynamic network behaviors of sen-
sor nodes. In this demo, we present Sensor Anomaly Visualization
Engine (SAVE), an integrated system that tackles the sensor net-
work diagnosis problem using both visualization and anomaly de-
tection analytics to guide the user quickly and accurately diagnose
sensor network failures. Temporal expansion model, correlation
graphs and dynamic projection views are proposed to effectively
interpret the topological, correlational and dimensional sensor data
dynamics and their anomalies. Through a real-world large-scale
wireless sensor network deployment (GreenOrbs), we demonstrate
that SAVE is able to help better locate the problem and further iden-
tify the root cause of major sensor network failures.

INTRODUCTION
Sensor networks play a pivotal role in numerous modern and fu-
ture industries such as smart grid, logistics and healthcare. How-
ever, diagnosing sensor networks can be tremendously challenging
when faced with the issues in full scale deployments: First, sen-
sor networks consisting of numerous low-end embedded devices
are resource-constrained, especially its non-rechargeable batteries,
making it hard to deploy the approaches of traditional networks
(e.g. SNMP). Second, most sensor networks are deployed in out-
door or even hostile environments, thus greatly affects the perfor-
mance and reliability of sensor networks. For example, the changes
in temperature and humidity, the wind and rain, and the physical
damages by human and wild animals, may all cause performance
degradation or even system failures in sensor networks. Third, the
low-power wireless communication of sensor networks is likely to

be lossy in certain environments and hence cannot guarantee per-
fect data collection.
The current algorithms to diagnose sensor networks from the
collected data mainly rely on certain inference models which link
symptoms to the underlying root causes. They depend on the evidence-
based sensor data fault taxonomy [1] to characterize the symp-
tom. However, due to the resource constraints and the existence
of salient failures, such inference models could only focus on a
portion of symptoms, restricting their applicability and efﬁciency
in real usage.
In this work, we present Sensor Anomaly Visualization Engine
(SAVE) (Figure 1), an integrated system that tackles the sensor net-
work diagnosis problem using both visual analytics technologies.
Compared to simple algorithmic approaches, our method has the
following advantages:
• The visualization of sensor network data from multiple per-
spectives, at large scale and in long term helps the admin-
istrator collect evidence in a more comprehensive manner.
In our system, we introduce several novel visualizations to
illustrate all the three time-varying high-dimensional sensor
data facets – routing topology, sensor networking status and
physical sensor readings.
• Rather than derive hypothesis directly with the inference model,
visual analytics solution focuses on collecting better evidence
for the human to improve the decision-making process. This
extra robustness makes it a better choice in diagnosing salient
sensor network failures, whose symptoms and root causes are
previously unknown to network operators and researchers.

• The visual interface provides more intuitive and interactive
display of data. It is also easier to incorporate human do-
main knowledge, and furthermore, save signiﬁcant amount
of time by working on the machine-generated insights di-
rectly, rather than executing the algorithms and putting them
together manually.
2. SYSTEM
2.1 GreenOrbs and Data Collection
GreenOrbs [2] is a long-term large-scale wireless sensor network
system in the forest located on the campus of Zhejiang Forestry
University. The system realizes all-year-round forest ecological
surveillance and supports various forestry applications. The current
deployment includes approximately 500 nodes in total. A portion
of the sensor nodes have been in continuous operation for over one
year. Each sensor node in GreenOrbs collects four categories of
data: the ﬁrst is sensor readings such as temperature, humidity, etc.
The second is the routing path to the sink. The third is link status,
including the RSSI/LQI/ETX value of all the neighbors. The fourth
is a large collection of statistical information on each sensor node,
including the cumulative time of radio power on, the cumulative
number of packets (received, transmitted, dropped, etc.).
2.2 SAVE System Framework
SAVE system is designed as a three-stage pipeline: data pre-
processing, anomaly detection and multi-view visualization.
In
GreenOrbs case, the data collected are streamed to a central database
in real time. In the ﬁrst stage, the multi-facet raw data is prepro-
cessed, including cleansing, structuring and normalization. Next,
anomalies are detected online by the analytics components of SAVE.
Results such as outliers and correlation changes are computed and
cached. Then as a core stage, all these data facets and the prepared
analytics results are brought together and consumed by the visual-
ization components integrated with SAVE.
2.3 Anomaly Detection and Visualization
By nature, the sensor routing topology is a large-scale time-
varying graph, analytics-unfriendly due to the extremely random
routing changes over time. Such a graph is quite messy drawn in
normal methods either with geographical or logical layouts. We
propose the Temporal Expansion Model (TEM) graph in this work
to prepare a more intuitive graph for the following visualization
stage. TEM leverages the key feature of the sensor network stud-
ied here – all the sensor nodes only send packets to the central sink
node for information fusion. The basic idea is to split one physical
sensor node into multiple logical nodes according to the separate
routing paths to the sink. A snapshot of the TEM graph is shown
in the top-left part of Figure 1. To visualize this packet sending
pattern, a temporal ring is composed for each node. The color of
each ring is selected by interpolating between two boundary colors
using the normalized value, i.e., orange to indicate the earliest time
and blue to indicate the latest time. The advantages of TEM are
two-fold: ﬁrst, the graphs generated are directed trees, much bet-
ter for visualization and navigation; second, temporal changes to
the network are surfaced to the graph, providing input for further
analytics.
Another temporal dynamic occurs at the various dimensions of
sensor data. One question is to ask how one dimension changes
in relation to another. For example, should the number of packet
in transmission increase in the same proportion of sensor voltage
decrease? We introduce the correlation graph to address such ques-
tions to the data. Two time-series data sets of property value vec-
tors (i.e., one for sensor readings and one for sensor counters) are
extracted from the raw reported sensor data in real time based on
the selection of the node, start and end timestamps in the system.
SAVE computes the correlation scores according to the Pearson’s
product-moment coefﬁcient and construct a graph representing the
correlations among dimensions, An example is given in the bottom-
center of Figure 1.
The data reported from sensor nodes is also high-dimensional
(up to 30 dimensions). Since the wireless sensors deployed in
wild environment are quite dynamic, how to detect and analyze
the anomalies in high-dimensional space becomes a challenging
task. Speciﬁcally, we want to know both the spatial and tempo-
ral anomalies of high-dimensional sensor nodes. To achieve such
goal, we introduce a dynamic projection graph to represent the dis-
tribution of multi-dimensional data in 2D space, as shown in the
top-right of Figure 1. Each high-dimensional sensor node measure-
ment in a given time is mapped as a data point onto the space using
a concept similar to Star Coordinates. Figure 2 shows a series of in-
teractive visual exploration steps guided by built-in spatiotemporal
anomaly analytic algorithms. With SAVE, the underlying causes
for these hard-to-detect silent failures in the complex yet dynamic
sensor networks may be efﬁciently identiﬁed.
