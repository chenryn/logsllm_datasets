User: 请选择LogParser领域相关问题的正确答案及解释Here are some running logs
 0 20:11:10 INFO Found block rdd_42_7 locally
 1 20:10:53 INFO Found block rdd_2_2 locally
 2 20:10:55 INFO Found block rdd_21_0 locally
 3 20:11:09 INFO Found block rdd_42_32 locally
 4 20:10:40 INFO Registered signal handlers for [TERM, HUP, INT]
The first three parts of the log are index, timestamp, and log level. Without considering these three parts, Here we assume that the variables in the logs are represented as '<*>', separated by spaces between tokens. What is the specific log template for the above logs?

A: Slf4jLogger started 和 Remoting started; listening on addresses :[akka.tcp://<*>]
B: Registered signal handlers for [TERM, HUP, INT] 和 Found block rdd_<*> locally
C: Changing view acls to: <*> 和 Starting remoting
D: Changing modify acls to: <*> 和 SecurityManager: authentication disabled; ui acls disabled; users with view permissions: Set(yarn, curi); users with modify permissions: Set(yarn, curi)

Assistant: Answer: B
