  Conclusions 
Who is involved 
!  Those that spy. 
!  Those that get spied on. 
Why do Spies Spy? 
!  Information has value. 
  Moral values: 
!  Protect people from harm 
!  Progress society 
  Immoral values: 
!  Blackmail 
!  Profiteering 
Full Disclosure 
I loath tin foil hats and conspiracy theories. 
Story time! 
!  2010, someone working on their car finds a GPS unit  
!  Law enforcement and FBI show up shortly after it is removed, 
asking for their device back.

What is the  
“Surveillance Catalog”? 
Surveillance Catalog leaks 
!  Der Spiegel and 30c3 in December 2013 
!  Tons of details regarding how spying agencies are 'bugging' 
computers, cell phones and more. 
!  They do not credit a source.

Conclusions 
!  Enjoy the thought experiment and discussion. 
!  Bugs are detectable 
Many are based on attacks covered in Hacker cons 
!  Hard evidence is better than Hearsay 
I want to hear from the first person who finds one! 
!  Tin-Foil hats are not stylish
