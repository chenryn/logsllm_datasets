## Who is Involved?
- **Those who spy**: Governments, intelligence agencies, and other state actors.
- **Those who are spied on**: Individuals, organizations, and nations.

## Why Do Spies Spy?
### Information Has Value
- **Moral Values**:
  - Protect people from harm
  - Progress society
- **Immoral Values**:
  - Blackmail
  - Profiteering

## Full Disclosure
I do not support or endorse conspiracy theories. The following information is based on credible sources and documented incidents.

## Case Study: 2010 FBI Tracking Device
In 2010, an individual discovered a GPS tracking device attached to their vehicle while working on it. Shortly after the device was removed, law enforcement and FBI agents arrived, requesting its return. This incident, detailed in a [Wired article](http://www.wired.com/2010/10/fbi-tracking-device/), is one of the few publicly known cases of a tracking device being found. No agency has officially admitted involvement.

## The "Surveillance Catalog" Leaks
- **Source**: Der Spiegel and 30c3 in December 2013
- **Details**: Extensive information on how spying agencies use various hardware and software to conduct surveillance on computers, cell phones, and other devices.
- **Credibility**: The leaks did not credit a specific source, but they have been widely reported and analyzed.

## Operational Security (OPSEC)
- **Maintain OPSEC at all times**: Be vigilant and follow best practices to protect your data and devices.

## Conclusions
- **Thought Experiment and Discussion**: Engage in thoughtful discussions about the implications of surveillance.
- **Detectability of Bugs**: Many bugs can be detected using techniques discussed in hacker conferences.
- **Hard Evidence vs. Hearsay**: Rely on hard evidence rather than unverified claims.
- **First Person Reports**: I look forward to hearing from the first person who discovers and reports a surveillance device.
- **Stylish Alternatives**: Tin-foil hats are not a practical solution.
