Abstract
Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices are typically resource constrained in terms of
computing capabilities and battery power. Despite the efforts from the Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF) to established standards for IoT such as IPv6 over
low-power wireless personal area networks (6LoWPAN), routing protocol for
low-power lossy networks (RPL), and constrained application protocol (CoAP),
certificate-based Internet security protocols have not been fully addressed yet.
We see the main cause of this being the size of the X.509-based Internet cer-
tificates. Typically being 1 to 2 kB, the large size of these certificates can cause
IEEE 802.15.4-based IoT nodes to fragment the certificate into many smaller
packet-size chunks, which causes many packet transmissions to occur in the
network. This work presents LightCert, a lightweight scheme to compress the
size of the security certificates using the similarity of contents in X.509 cer-
tificates. Specifically, LightCert identifies common fields in a certificate and
suppresses the transmission of these contents within the IoT subnet scope. This
allows LightCert nodes to minimize the packet transmission overhead for sup-
porting certificate-based security mechanisms such as datagram transport layer
security (DTLS), by as much as ∼37%. The added overhead of exchanging cer-
tificates when using LightCert is kept low to as much as ∼5 mJ of energy and
∼0.48 seconds of latency.

INTRODUCTION
The Internet of Things (IoT) and the devices consisting of the infrastructure are gaining interest from various industries
as a future market that interconnects cyber intelligence with the physical world.1 Given the number of applications that
IoT systems can potentially cover, the number of devices that are deployed is increasing at an extremely fast rate and this
rate is projected to grow even more rapidly over the next few years to come. As IoT devices tend to come closer to our
everyday environments to capture personal information and analyze such information on the Internet for various (often
third party) applications, the potential threat on personal information leakage increases as well. For such reasons, there
are demands for implementing sufficient security mechanisms on IoT devices.
Specifically, as IoT devices can collect sensitive data, only authorized parties are allowed to access the data and manip-
ulate it. As a result, it is essential to have a mechanism that can authenticate messages and the identity of the Internet-
and IoT-connected devices. One of the most powerful and secure authentication technologies used on the Internet
today is the public key infrastructure (PKI2). PKI is designed to operate based on an encrypted certificate by accessing a

public key via a private key possessed by a node considered providing high levels of security in terms of authentication
and nonrepudiation.
However, the conventional PKI scheme is not efficient enough for the IoT environment given that many IoT-class
devices have limitations in computing, network, and battery resources. Given the maximum packet size of the widely used
IEEE 802.15.4 standard3 of 127 bytes, the PKI certificates are considerably large (eg, typically 1 kB to 2 kB). As the size
of storage and memory is limited in many IoT devices, reducing the size of the certificates is preferred to save the space
in general. If we apply the current PKI scheme to IoT devices, the running applications may be limited to populate data
as well as to keep required certificates on memory. Such limitations can potentially lead to frequent certificate exchanges
(due to the previous ones being deleted due to the lack of storage space), which results in additional increased network
traffic and energy consumption overhead.
Sending a large number of packets for exchanging a certificate on a resource-constraint IoT device is challenging
because of the amount of traffic and memory usage required to establish a secure session. IoT networks typically exploit
a radio duty cycling link layer protocol4-6 to maintain a lifetime of up to several years on battery. Radio duty cycling can
reduce the energy consumption of a node by minimizing the amount of time the radio transceiver is in the “on” state
in accordance with the sleep and wake-up schedules. Such radio duty cycling will have a direct impact on the cost of
certificate exchanges by increasing the latency and lowering the network throughput.
In this study, we propose reducing the size of the certificate to cope with the lack of resources. Smaller certificate sizes
allow a resource-constraint IoT node to maintain more certificates in its memory, allowing it to communicate freely with
many devices without the need to update or exchange the certificates frequently. In addition, the decreased packet count
from the certificate size reduction can reduce the radio on time thus reduces the energy consumption of battery-operated
IoT nodes. Furthermore, shorter packets lead to less congestion possibilities on the wireless medium, which can naturally
save the resources needed for packet scheduling and retransmissions.
We introduce LightCert, a novel certificate compression and exchange mechanisms which are suitable for IoT devices
and their deployments. Our proposed scheme first starts with compressing a typical Internet node certificate's format-
ting using the concise binary object representation (CBOR).7 Instead of redesigning the entire certificate specifically for
IoT nodes, we leverage the certificates used on the Internet today to allow full Internet-compatibility in the IoT network.
Next, borrowing from the philosophy of the 6LoWPAN8,9 header compression mechanism design, we exploit the capa-
bility to reconstruct a packet at the border router (eg, IoT gateway). Specifically, we compress the size of the certificate
by eliminating common (shared) portions of the certificate within the subnet. While the certificate travels through the
IoT network, we make sure that implicitly understandable fields are suppressed, but as packets leaves the IoT network,
the gateway attaches the suppressed information to packets to construct a full-size certificate. Given that our scheme
focuses on maintaining the contents of the certificate while only compressing the size, we maintain compatibility with
the certificate-based packet exchange mechanisms used on the Internet today.
We evaluate the effectiveness of LightCert in terms of network overhead (generated from supporting certificate-based
security) and energy consumption using a combination of ContikiOS implementation-based experiments and NS-3–based
simulations. Our results suggest that compared to exchanging a full-length certificate, LightCert is able to reduce the
network packet exchange overhead by as much as 37% and the energy consumption by 30%. Furthermore, the increased
energy usage overhead, when compared to the case where no security mechanisms are used, is only 5 mJ while testing
for a typical IoT application scenario.
Specifically, this work makes the following contributions.
• We present a set of requirements that developers must consider in designing security mechanisms for
resource-constraint IoT platforms.

• We design and implement LightCert, a light-weight algorithm for compressing and exchanging certificates for enabling
• Using a Contiki implementation of LightCert, we show that the proposed scheme can effectively reduce the packet
exchange overhead that security certificates introduce to minimize energy usage on resource-constraint IoT systems.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 covers related work on various emerging IoT security
technologies, and Section 3 introduces background information on certificate-based security requirements for the Internet
and IoT. In Section 4, a detailed description of LightCert will be presented, and we will present evaluation results in
Section 5. Finally, we conclude the work with an overview of the remaining challenges and future directions for IoT
system security in Section 6.

Over the last few years, there have been many proposals for building a customized system for secure IoT networks. Most
of these approaches are partially dependent on remote and centralized cloud servers for IoT node authentication and
authorization.10-13 OpenIoT is a platform designed to enable integration between different sets of IoT applications.14 It is
based primarily on cloud servers and leverages central access control to adopt a flexible authentication and authorization
scheme. Authentication of Things (AoT) provides a variety of authentication schemes and uses a cloud server to control
the trust relationship between the manufacturer and the IoT device.15 IoT-OAS uses the OAuth server with the CoAP
protocol for access control to third-party applications,16 and OSCAR uses an authentication server to provide an integrated
security architecture for the cloud and IoT systems.17 Another paper has established a new IoT-Cloud architecture based
on edge computing to overcome internal attacks and repeat/similar service requirements. It focuses on ensuring IoT
security and addressing service efficiency issues.18
The SEA19 adopts gateway to supplement the limited resource environment. This solution uses a distributed smart
electronic health gateway to present an authentication and authorization architecture for secure and efficient IoT-based
healthcare. It entrusts the burden of the healthcare sensor node to the outside, allowing the sensor to communicate
securely and efficiently across independent network domains. By providing the connection context set in the health sensor
node, no longer need to authenticate and authenticate the remote health center or care giver. The SEA uses the fact that
smart electronic health gateways and remote end users have sufficient resources to efficiently perform various weight
protocols and certificate validation.
Kothmayr et al propose an authentication system for IoT using datagram transport layer security (DTLS), a datagram
variant of transport layer security (TLS),20 and Hummen et al propose a security framework for IoT devices based on
DTLS.21 As with our proposed approach, these frameworks use a delegated server, which is an authorization entity, to
reduce the amount of public-key cryptography computations at the resource-limited end devices.
In addition, there are ways to keep the conventional authentication format but reduce the size of the certificate itself
to reduce the traffic for a wireless sensor network channel.22 This technique proposes a new formatting certificate using
CBOR rather than ASN.1, which is conventionally used in X.509 certificates.

SECURITY ON THE INTERNET AND REQUIREMENTS FOR IOT DEVICES

3.1
IoT devices installed in the home, hospital, and factory enable many application services. Naturally, given that these
nodes can carry sensitive information that directly relates to privacy and safety, the networks need some form of security
measures to protect their data. These security mechanisms are necessary not only for the users safety but also required for
protecting others who access data from the device if the device is accessible from third parties and shares meaningful data.
To do so, the main focus is in identifying potential risks and finding ways to ensure that threats related to data leakage
are suppressed. Nevertheless, it is not easy for the system to stay on top of everything under dynamic environments; thus,
typical security-/privacy-preserving mechanisms rely on an externally trusted Internet entity.
Currently, the most commonly used security method on the Internet is the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), which
exploits certificates to maintain the authenticity of connections. Using PKI makes it possible for public network users, such
as users on the Internet, to exchange data steadily and confidently by using a certificate granted by a trusted authority. PKI
provides a digital certificate that identifies an individual or organization, and a directory service that stores the certificate
and can be retrieved when needed.2
