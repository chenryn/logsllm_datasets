User: I downloaded a deb package panda3d1.9_1.9.3-xenial_amd64.deb and I want to install it for Python 3. My OS is Linux Ubuntu 16.04. The default python is 2.7.12 and I would prefer to keep it as default, but Python 3 is installed too and available to use. How do I install this package for Python 3 only?
I am not sure pip may help.
Assistant: You can use sudo dpkg panda3d1.9_1.9.3-xenial_amd64.deb  it won't affect your default package.
