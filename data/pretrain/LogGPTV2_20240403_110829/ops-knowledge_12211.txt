Subject: Assistance with Salt Automation for Zabbix Monitoring

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am currently facing a challenge while trying to automate the addition of hosts to my Zabbix monitoring server using Salt. 

I have created a bash script that successfully adds a host to the Zabbix server when executed manually. However, I am encountering an issue when attempting to automate this process through Salt. Specifically, when I run a highstate, the state containing the script is executed on the master before it is applied to the minion. This is problematic because the script requires my login authentication, which is not available on the minion.

### Current Setup
- **Bash Script**: Adds a host to the Zabbix monitoring server.
- **Salt Configuration**: The script runs during a highstate but executes on the master instead of the minion.

### Desired Outcome
- Automate the configuration so that the script runs on the minion and then on the other server.

### Questions
1. Is there a specific configuration in Salt that would allow me to achieve this setup?
2. Would it be appropriate to use a salt-runner for this task, or are there better alternatives?

### Research
In my research, I found that using a salt-runner might be a potential solution, but I am unsure if this is the best approach.

### Suggested Solution
One suggestion I received was to run a minion on the same box as the master, allowing the script to be executed on the master's minion and then on the other server. However, I am looking for additional guidance and best practices for this kind of setup.

Thank you for your assistance. I look forward to your insights.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
