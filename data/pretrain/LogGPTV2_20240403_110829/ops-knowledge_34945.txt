User: Now it is necessary to test the bandwidth of a network transmission line, how to use the network test tool that comes with the Linux system to test the bandwidth?
Assistant: You can use the network testing tool iperf that comes with the Linux system to perform bandwidth testing. The steps are as follows: 1. Install iperf on a computer. For example, the following command can be used to install on the Ubuntu system: ``` sudo apt-get install iperf ``` 2. Start the iperf server and execute the following command on a computer: ``` iperf -s ``` can Use this computer as an iperf server and wait for the test. 3. Execute the following command on another computer: ``` iperf -c IP address or domain name``` Note: The IP address or domain name is the IP address or domain name of the computer that executes iperf -s in step 2. The computer can be used as an iperf client to perform connectivity and bandwidth tests with the server. 4. Review the test results. Both the server and the client will output test results similar to the following: [ 4] 0.0-10.0 sec 1.57 GBytes 1.35 Gbits/sec, indicating that the test bandwidth is 1.35 Gbits/s. It should be noted that iperf is a tool for bandwidth testing based on TCP or UDP protocols. If you want to conduct a more detailed test, you can use other network testing tools, such as ping, traceroute, etc.
