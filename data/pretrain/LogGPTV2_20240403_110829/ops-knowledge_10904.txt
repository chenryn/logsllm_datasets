User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to check what/why stopped Tomcat? I have Tomcat 6 on Debian 5 on VPS. Sometimes Tomcat stop responses, and when I then checked server there is no Tomcat process and none exception to this in Tomcat logs.

How can I check what killed Tomcat process?

Assistant: You could try to search in syslog: /var/log/*

for the messages (syslog) use the following command:

tail /var/log/syslog


and you will get the last 5 or so log messages.

here's an article on debians syslog: http://www.aboutdebian.com/syslog.htm
