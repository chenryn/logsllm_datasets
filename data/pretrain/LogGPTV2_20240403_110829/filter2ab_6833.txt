This revision improves the clarity and professional tone of the text by:

1. **Formatting**: Clearly separating the ATT&CK ID and Technique Name for better readability.
2. **Language**: Using "has been observed" instead of "has used" to maintain a more formal and objective tone.
3. **Punctuation**: Adding a period at the end of the sentence for proper closure.
