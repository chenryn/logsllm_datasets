User: How to use container technology to deploy applications, provide a complete deployment solution, and attach specific operation steps.
Assistant: To use container technology to deploy applications, you can choose to use a mature containerization tool such as Docker, which provides the following complete deployment solution: Step 1: Determine the service requirements and write the Dockerfile. First, you need to determine the service requirements to be deployed, and then Write a Dockerfile for these requirements to describe how to generate a container image. For example, if we want to deploy a simple web application "hello-world", write a Dockerfile here: ```dockerfile FROM python:3.6-alpine COPY ./app WORKDIR /app RUN pip install -r requirements.txt CMD python app.py ``` In the above Dockerfile: FROM: specify the base image (the base image of Python 3.6 is used here); COPY: copy the application to the container ; WORKDIR: Specify the working directory of the container; RUN: Execute the command to install the required dependency packages; CMD: Specify the command to be executed by default after the container starts. Step 2: Build the image After writing the Dockerfile, you can use the docker build command to build it Compile and generate a container image. Open the terminal, switch to the directory where the Dockerfile is located, and execute the following command: ```shell docker build -t hello-world:1.0 . ``` Among them, -t: is used to specify the name of the generated image and version (here hello-world:1.0); . : Specify the directory where the Dockerfile is located. Step 3: Run the container After the image is generated, you can use the docker run command to start the container, and map port 80 of localhost to port 5000 inside the container Above: ```shell docker run -p 80:5000 hello-world:1.0 ``` Among them, -p: means to map port 80 of the host to port 5000 of the container; hello-world:1.0: means to run Container image name and version number. After running successfully, you can access the hello-world application on localhost:80. Step 4: Deploy to Kubernetes When our service needs high availability and load balancing, we can use Kubernetes. First install Kubernetes and upload the Docker image to the container warehouse. Then configure the Kubernetes Deployment and Service orchestration files, and use the kubectl command to deploy the container to Kubernetes. For example, the yaml format of the file is as follows (the file name is hello-world.yaml): ` ``yaml apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: hello-world labels: app: hello-world spec: replicas: 3 selector: matchLabels: app: hello-world template: metadata: labels: app: hello-world spec: containers: - name: hello-world image: registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/myiac/hello-world:1.0 ports: - containerPort: 5000 --- apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: hello- world spec: type: NodePort ports: - port: 80 nodePort: 30101 selector: app: hello-world ``` Among them, Deployment defines the running mode of the application, and the number of replicas is specified here as 3 to ensure high Availability and load balancing; Service defines the external access method of the application. Here, the type is specified as NodePort, that is, the external exposure is realized through the node IP + NodePort, and port 5000 inside the container is mapped to port 80 of the node. Finally Use the following command to deploy the hello-world application to Kubernetes: ```shell kubectl apply -f hello-world.yaml ``` So far, using Docker to deploy the application and implementing high-availability load balancing through Kubernetes has been completed.
