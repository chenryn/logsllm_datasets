## Abstract
In the face of potential pandemics, such as avian influenza, and bioterrorist attacks, public health surveillance and preparedness have never been more critical. Early detection of biological events, electronic reporting of laboratory test results, efficient exchange of case reports across jurisdictions, and timely alerting of health threats are essential components of effective health protection. However, these activities often require the timely availability of information related to individuals' healthcare behaviors and clinical conditions, which can pose a threat to personal privacy. Public health is thus challenged to maintain an optimal balance between protecting the nation's health and respecting the personal privacy of its citizens.

## 1. Introduction and Update on PCASSO
I am honored to be selected as the Distinguished Practitioner for this year’s Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC). I had the pleasure of serving on the ACSAC Board during its early years, alongside colleagues such as Marshall Abrams, Tom Haigh, Dan Faigin, Ron Gove, and others. Additionally, I am honored that the Health Information Management and Systems Society (HIMSS) has requested permission to include this paper in the next release of its Privacy and Security Toolkit [1].

My last participation in ACSAC was in 1997, when my research team received the Best Paper Award for our work on the Patient Centered Access to Secure Systems Online (PCASSO) project [2]. Sponsored by the National Library of Medicine, PCASSO was highly successful and is widely regarded as seminal in both patient empowerment [3] and the use of high-assurance security methods in healthcare systems [4]. PCASSO was the first experiment to enable patients to access and view their own clinical information over the Internet, including highly sensitive information related to HIV/AIDS, abortion, adoption, and genetics. We achieved high assurance through the use of multi-level, label-based (a.k.a., mandatory) access control and an assortment of architectural and design approaches that were viewed by many at the time as “paranoid.” To this day, PCASSO remains the only project to apply multi-level security to protect healthcare information, even though enabling patients to access at least portions of their health records has become more commonplace.

Unfortunately, even today, the healthcare provider community often treats security primarily as a compliance issue, rather than an essential prerequisite for information confidentiality, data integrity, system stability, and continuity of operations. This paper focuses on the security and privacy challenges the public health community faces as it seeks to protect the U.S. population from disease outbreaks and bioterrorist attacks. Over the past three years, I have supported the National Center for Public Health Informatics (NCPHI) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), primarily conducting research and architecture studies related to the Public Health Information Network (PHIN). Most of my work has focused on defining an architecture that will enable public health agencies to quickly construct and distribute event-specific data-collection instruments for epidemiologists and first-responders to use. While my CDC work has not had a security focus, my experience has given me the opportunity to learn about the important role public health plays in our lives and the challenges it faces in achieving and maintaining an optimal balance between personal privacy and effective health surveillance, outbreak detection, preparedness, and response.

The following sections of this paper provide an introduction to public health, its basic responsibilities, and current challenges, as well as its direction toward nationwide interoperability and biosurveillance. Section 4 establishes the legal and regulatory foundations for privacy and security in public health, including an explanation of the requirements contained in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule. Section 5 discusses security and privacy challenges and offers a risk model of the complex interplay between personal privacy and population health. Section 6 maps public health security safeguards and de-identification policies to the HIPAA Privacy Rule requirements prescribed for healthcare providers and insurers.

## 2. A Primer on Public Health
The Institute of Medicine defines public health as “what we as a society do collectively to assure the conditions in which people can be healthy” [5]. Although government agencies at the federal, state, tribal, and local levels bear explicit legal responsibility for protecting public health, many public and private organizations and institutions contribute to both the science and practice of public health. These public health partners include clinical practitioners, health departments, laboratories, disease programs, researchers, and social services. The complex responsibilities and interactions among these partners require significant coordination and the use of information technology and information exchange protocols to meet public health preparedness and response objectives.

A fundamental science of public health is epidemiology, the study of the occurrence and causes of health effects in human populations [6]. The work of public health is often invisible to the average person—very few people regularly visit an "epidemiologist." An analogy attributed to a medical school epidemiology course is that a clinician (e.g., family physician) tries to determine what kind of disease a person has, whereas an epidemiologist tries to determine what kind of person has a disease or condition (and what factors can be manipulated to prevent that disease or condition) [7]. An important tool for public health professionals is public health informatics, the systematic application of information and computer science and technology to public health practice, research, and learning [8].

The basic responsibilities of public health are [9]:
1. To prevent epidemics and the spread of disease.
2. To protect against environmental hazards.
3. To prevent injuries.
4. To promote and encourage healthy behaviors and mental health.
5. To respond to disasters and assist communities in recovery.
6. To assure the quality and accessibility of health services.

Public health professionals at the federal level often specialize in narrow fields, such as lead poisoning or HIV/AIDS, while those at the local level tend to be generalists with diverse responsibilities, sometimes playing the role of care providers for individuals unable to afford a family doctor. Generally, federal and state public health agencies produce the research results, guidelines, and recommendations that local public health departments implement [7].

An important activity in disease prevention, detection, characterization, and eradication is public health surveillance, the ongoing systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of health data for the purposes of improving the health and safety of a population [10]. Data are systematically collected and analyzed to determine what actions might need to be taken to prevent or control a disease or condition. Public health authorities generally rely on healthcare providers, laboratories, veterinarians, and others to report cases of reportable diseases and conditions when they are detected. Less commonly, health departments may contact or visit laboratories, hospitals, and providers to stimulate reporting of specific diseases and conditions.

Laws, regulations, and mandates for public health reporting (including the specific data items that are reported) fall under the authority of individual states and territories. Each state’s health department and legislators decide which diseases and conditions to monitor within their state, and state legislatures may appropriate funding for conducting surveillance activities. Thus, the diseases and conditions that are actively monitored will vary from state to state [11]. Healthcare providers and clinical laboratories report to their local, county, or state health departments all cases of diseases and conditions under surveillance in their state.

State public health officials, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE), and the CDC collaborate to determine which diseases and conditions should be “nationally notifiable” under the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). The list of Nationally Notifiable Diseases and Conditions (NND) is reviewed annually and revised as new pathogens emerge or disease incidence declines. The 2006 NND list identifies 61 infectious diseases, with 31 subcategories [12]. However, states are not required by law to report NND cases to the CDC.

Local and state health departments monitor individuals (“cases”) diagnosed with diseases and conditions under surveillance. Case reports generally include person-specific demographic information; clinical information, such as lab tests ordered and results; information about recent travels; and information about the entities (e.g., people, buildings, animals) with whom the case has come into contact. At the national level, each of the CDC’s centers, institutes, and offices has its own surveillance mission and data requirements. Before a state sends case reports to the CDC, person identifiers are removed. (See Section 6.)

When the incidence of a disease under surveillance suddenly rises or when a new pattern of a set of symptoms emerges, an “outbreak” condition exists. Under outbreak conditions, timely investigation of reported cases and contacts is critical to effective containment and control. Local health departments spring into action to respond to the outbreak, perhaps requesting assistance from their state health department or the CDC. An outbreak response involves investigating known and suspected cases, tracing contacts, and implementing countermeasures such as vaccination, prophylaxis, or quarantine. Nearly as important as bringing the outbreak condition under control are managing the overall response and communicating with the community. If the outbreak is associated with a catastrophic natural disaster or is suspected to be the result of a bioterrorist act—either of which can cause extensive morbidity, mortality, economic loss, and social disruption—a “public health emergency” exists. When a public health emergency occurs, many roles and responsibilities, as well as data exchanges, are affected.

The sense of urgency that characterizes an outbreak can induce investigators to use whatever convenient means they may have to collect data. As a result, outbreak data may be collected using the investigators’ own preferences for the questions asked, the terms and codes used to record responses, and an assortment of spreadsheets and databases to contain the data. This ad hoc approach can undermine efforts to control the outbreak, particularly when the outbreak crosses jurisdictional lines. Cases may be recorded in multiple databases (or spreadsheets) without recognizing duplicates; data may be added to some case records but not all; and laboratory data may not be linked to the patients who provided the specimens [13].

Historically, public health has used information technology tactically rather than strategically. As public health entered the twenty-first century, more than 100 different surveillance and health information systems were in use by the CDC’s centers, institutes, and offices, and by state and local health departments. Many of these systems had been in place for several years and were originally commissioned to detect simple disease and disability conditions. These systems were administered independently, used non-standardized formats for variable definition and grouping, and were unable to communicate with each other [14].

In some instances, computer technology proved to be a hindrance. Such was the case for the hantavirus outbreak in 1993. Data “locked” in local databases could not be analyzed or merged with data in other databases. Additionally, security measures designed to protect privacy and data availability sometimes constrained responses and surveillance efforts by enforcing strict database design and handling requirements [13].

The anthrax attack of 2001 caught the U.S. public health system off-guard and dramatically exposed the limitations of our public health infrastructure when confronted with a major public health crisis. Prior to this rude awakening to the reality of the bioterrorist threat, public health was already facing significant challenges, including cancer, obesity, violence, toxic environments, a large uninsured population, and health disparities. Rapid and dramatic changes were occurring in the scientific, social, cultural, technological, and global threat contexts of our nation’s health. These challenges, coupled with unprecedented political and public scrutiny, prompted the public health system to critically examine its methods and priorities [15].

Out of this level of scrutiny and introspection came the recognition of the need to realign priorities and to implement a public health infrastructure that could support disease surveillance with more effective coordination and collaboration among public health partners. Without such an infrastructure, bioterrorist events and outbreaks with potentially national impact could not be identified. Moreover, the use of multiple, non-integrated systems was contributing to an undesirable error rate in data records, inefficient use of time and labor, potential under- and over-reporting, and duplication of efforts [14].

Since 2001, the U.S. public health system has undergone dramatic changes with respect to priorities, methods, and data sources. A realignment of priorities has resulted in an increased emphasis on biosurveillance and response capabilities. A cornerstone of the strategic plan for the future of public health is the Public Health Information Network (PHIN).
