Amidst  threats  of  pandemic  avian  influenza  and 
bioterrorist  attack,  public  health  surveillance  and 
preparedness have never been more important.  Early 
detection of biological events, electronic reporting of 
laboratory  test  results,  efficient  exchange  of  case 
reports  across  jurisdictions,  and  timely  alerting  of 
health  threats  are  critical  components  of  effective 
health  protection.

ACSAC  Board  during  the  early  years,  along  with 
Marshall Abrams, Tom Haigh, Dan Faigin, Ron Gove,

Information  Management  and  Systems  Society 
(HIMSS)  has  requested  permission  to  include  this 
paper in  the next release  of  its  Privacy  and  Security 
Toolkit [1]. 
I last participated in the ACSAC in 1997, when my 
research team received the Best Paper Award for our 
paper  about  our  Patient  Centered  Access  to  Secure 
Systems Online (PCASSO) project [2].  Sponsored by 
the National Library of Medicine, PCASSO was very 
successful and is widely regarded as seminal in both 
patient  empowerment  [3]  and  the  use  of  high-
assurance  security  methods  and 
in 
healthcare  systems  [4].    PCASSO  was  the  first 
experiment to enable patients to access and view their 
own  clinical  information  over  the  Internet,  including

highly  sensitive  information  relating  to  HIV/AIDS, 
abortion,  adoption,  and  genetics.    We  achieved  high 
assurance  through the  use  of  multi-level,  label-based 
(a.k.a., mandatory) access control and an assortment of 
architectural and design approaches viewed  by many 
at the time as “paranoid.” To this day, PCASSO is the 
only  project  that  has  applied  multi-level  security  to 
protect  healthcare  information  –  although  enabling 
patients  to  access  at  least  portions  of  their  health 
records 
commonplace.  
Unfortunately,  even  today,  the  healthcare  provider 
community  treats  security  as  primarily  a  compliance 
issue, 
to 
information  confidentiality,  data  integrity,  system 
stability,  and  continuity  of  operations.    But  that’s 
another story.

My  Distinguished  Practitioner  paper  focuses  on 
public  health  –  specifically,  the  security  and  privacy 
challenges the public health community is facing as it 
seeks  to  protect  the  U.S.  population  from  disease 
outbreaks and bioterrorist attacks.  For the past three 
years, I have supported the National Center for Public 
Health Informatics (NCPHI) at the Centers for Disease 
Control  and  Prevention  (CDC),  primarily  doing 
research and architecture studies relating to the Public 
Health  Information  Network  (PHIN).    Most  of  my 
work has focused on defining an architecture that will 
enable public health agencies to quickly construct and 
distribute  event-specific  data-collection  instruments 
for  epidemiologists  and  first-responders  to  use  to 
collect  information  that  is  semantically  consistent, 
computer  consumable,  and  immediately  analyzable.  
While my CDC work has not had a security focus, my 
experience has given me the opportunity to learn about 
the important role that public health plays in our lives 
and about the challenges that public health faces as it 
seeks  to  achieve  and  maintain  an  optimal  balance 
between  personal  privacy  and  effective  health 
surveillance,  outbreak  detection,  preparedness,  and 
response.

2. A Primer on Public Health  
The Institute of Medicine has defined public health 
as “what we as a society do collectively to assure the 
conditions  in  which  people  can  be  healthy”  [5].  
Although  government  agencies  at  the  federal,  state, 
tribal, and local levels bear explicit legal responsibility 
for protecting public health, many public and private 
organizations and institutions in our society contribute 
to  both  the  science  and  practice  of  public  health.  
These  public  health  partners 
include  clinical 
practitioners, health departments, laboratories, disease 
programs,  researchers,  and  social  services.  The

A  basic  science  of  public  health  is  epidemiology, 
the  study  of  the  occurrence  and  causes  of  health 
effects in human populations [6].  The work of public 
health is often invisible to the average person – very

school  epidemiology  course  is  that  a  clinician  (e.g., 
family physician) tries to decide what kind of disease a 
person  has,  whereas  an  epidemiologist 
to 
determine  what  kind  of  person  has  a  disease  or 
condition  (and  what  factors  can  be  manipulated  to 
prevent  that  disease  or  condition)  [7].   An important 
tool  of  public  health  professionals  is  public  health 
informatics, the systematic application of information 
and computer science and technology to public health 
practice, research, and learning [8].

The basic responsibilities of public health are [9]: 
1)  To prevent epidemics and the spread of disease 
2)  To protect against environmental hazards 
3)  To prevent injuries 
4)  To  promote  and  encourage  healthy  behaviors 
and mental health

responsibilities,  and  sometimes  play  the  role  of  care

doctor.    In  general,  federal  and  state  public  health 
agencies produce the research results, guidelines, and 
recommendations that local public health departments 
implement [7]. 
An 
important  activity 
in  disease  prevention, 
detection,  characterization,  and  eradication  is  public 
health surveillance, the ongoing systematic collection, 
analysis,  and  interpretation  of  health  data  for  the 
purposes  of  improving  the  health  and  safety  of  a 
population [10].  Data are systematically collected and 
analyzed to determine what actions might need to be 
taken  to  prevent  or  control  a  disease  or  condition.  
Public  health authorities  generally  rely  on healthcare 
providers,  laboratories,  veterinarians,  and  others  to 
report  cases  of  reportable  diseases  and  conditions 
when  they  are  detected.  Less  commonly,  health 
departments  may  contact  or  visit 
laboratories, 
hospitals,  and  providers  to  stimulate  reporting  of 
specific diseases and conditions. 
Laws, regulations, and mandates for public health 
reporting  (including  the  specific  data  items  that  are 
reported)  fall  under  the authority  of  individual  states 
and  territories.    Each  state’s  health  department  and 
legislators  decide  which  diseases  and  conditions  to 
monitor  within  their  state,  and  state  legislatures may 
appropriate 
for  conducting  surveillance 
activities.  Thus  the  diseases  and  conditions  that  are 
actively monitored will vary  from state to state [11].  
Healthcare providers and clinical laboratories report to 
their  local,  county,  or  state  health  departments  all 
cases of diseases and conditions under surveillance in 
their state.     
funding 
State  public  health  officials,  the  Council  of  State 
and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE), and the CDC 
collaborate 
to  determine  which  diseases  and 
conditions should be “nationally notifiable” under the 
National  Notifiable  Diseases  Surveillance  System 
(NNDSS).  The  list  of  Nationally  Notifiable  Diseases 
and  Conditions  (NND)  is  reviewed  annually  and 
revised as new pathogens emerge or disease incidence 
declines.  The 2006 NND list identifies 61 infectious 
diseases, with 31 subcategories [12].  However, states 
are  not  required  by  law  to  report  NND  cases  to  the 
CDC.

Local  and  state  health  departments  monitor 
individuals  (“cases”)  diagnosed  with  diseases  and 
conditions under surveillance.  Case reports generally 
include  person-specific  demographic 
information; 
clinical  information,  such  as  lab  tests  ordered  and 
results; 
  information  about  recent  travels;  and 
information about the entities (e.g., people, buildings, 
animals)  with  whom  the  case has  come  into  contact.  
At  the  national  level,  each  of  the  CDC’s  centers, 
institutes, and offices has its own surveillance mission 
and  data  requirements.    Before  a  state  sends  case 
reports  to  the  CDC,  person  identifiers  are  removed.  
(See Section 6.)  
When the incidence of a disease under surveillance 
suddenly  rises  or  when  a  new  pattern  of  a  set  of 
symptoms  emerges,  an  “outbreak”  condition  exists.  
Under  outbreak  conditions,  timely  investigation  of 
reported  cases  and  contacts  is  critical  to  effective 
containment  and  control.    Local  health  departments 
spring into action to respond to the outbreak, perhaps 
requesting  assistance

department  or  the  CDC.    An  outbreak  response 
involves  investigating  known  and  suspected  cases, 
tracing  contacts,  and  implementing  countermeasures 
such  as  vaccination,  prophylaxis,  or  quarantine.  
Nearly as important as bringing the outbreak condition 
under  control  are managing  the  overall response  and 
communicating with the community.  If the outbreak 
is associated with a catastrophic natural disaster or is 
suspected to be the result of a bioterrorist act – either 
of  which  can  cause  extensive  morbidity,  mortality, 
economic loss, and social disruption – a “public health 
emergency”  exists.  When  a  public  health  emergency 
occurs, many roles and responsibilities, as well as data 
exchanges, are affected.   
from 
their 
The sense of urgency that characterizes an outbreak 
can  induce  investigators  to  use  whatever  convenient 
means  they  may  have  to  collect  data.    As  a  result, 
outbreak data may be collected using the investigators’ 
own preferences for the questions asked, the terms and 
codes used to record responses, and an assortment of 
spreadsheets and databases to contain the data.  This 
ad hoc approach can undermine efforts to control the 
outbreak,  particularly  when  the  outbreak  crosses 
jurisdictional lines.  Cases may be recorded in multiple 
databases 
recognizing 
duplicates;  data  may  be  added  to  some  case  records 
but not all; and laboratory data may not be linked to 
the patients who provided the specimens [13]. 
(or  spreadsheets)  without 
Historically,  public  health  has  used  information 
technology  tactically  rather  than  strategically.    As 
public  health  entered  the  twenty-first  century,  more 
than 100 different surveillance and health information 
systems were in use by the CDC’s centers, institutes, 
and offices, and by state and local health departments.  
3. Public Health in Transition 
Many  of these systems had been in place for several 
years,  and  were  originally  commissioned  to  detect 
simple  disease  and  disability  conditions.  These 
systems  were  administered  independently,  used  non-
standardized  formats  for  variable  definition  and 
grouping, and were unable to communicate with each 
another [14]. 
In some instances, computer technology proved to 
be a hindrance.  Such was the case for the hantavirus 
outbreak  in  1993.    Data  “locked”  in  local  databases 
could  not  be  analyzed  or  merged  with  data  in  other 
databases.  Also, security measures designed to protect 
privacy  and  data  availability  have 
sometimes 
constrained  responses  and  surveillance  efforts  by 
enforcing  strict  database  design  and  handling 
requirements [13]. 
in 
the 
social, 
The anthrax attack of 2001 caught the U.S. public 
health system off-guard and dramatically exposed the 
limitations  of  our  public  health  infrastructure  when 
confronted with a major public health crisis.  Prior to 
our  rude  awakening  to  the  reality  of  the  bioterrorist 
threat,  public  health  was  already  facing  significant 
challenges,  including  cancer,  obesity,  violence,  toxic 
environments, a large uninsured population, and health 
disparities.  Rapid  and  dramatic  changes  were 
occurring 
cultural, 
technological,  and  global  threat  contexts  of  our 
nation’s  health.    These  challenges,  coupled  with 
unprecedented political and public scrutiny, prompted 
the  public  health  system  to  critically  examine  its 
methods and priorities [15].  
scientific, 
Out of this level of scrutiny and introspection came 
recognition  of  the  need  to  realign  priorities  and  to 
implement  a  public  health  infrastructure  that  could 
support  disease  surveillance  with  more  effective 
coordination  and  collaboration  among  public  health 
partners.    Without  such an  infrastructure,  bioterrorist 
events and outbreaks with potentially national impact 
could not be identified.  Moreover, the use of multiple, 
non-integrated  systems  was  contributing 
to  an 
undesirable  error  rate  in  data  records,  an  inefficient 
use of time and labor, a potential for under- and over-
reporting, and a duplication of efforts [14]. 
Since  2001,  the  U.S.  public  health  system  has 
undergone  some  dramatic  changes  with  respect  to 
priorities, methods, and data sources.  A realignment 
of priorities has resulted in an increased emphasis on 
and 
response 
capabilities.  A cornerstone of the strategic plan for the 
future  of  public  health
