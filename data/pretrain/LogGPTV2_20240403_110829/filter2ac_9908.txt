ABSTRACT
There s  an alarmng ncrease  n the  number  of  vrus  and  worm 
attacks,  phshng  emals,  dentty  theft  both  on  the  nternet  and 
physcal  nfrastructures.  Indeed,  cyberspace  has  several  features 
of  lawlessness  whch  make  t  dffcult  for  us  to  mrror  socetal 
trust relatonshps nto cyberspace.  A cursory examnaton of the 
ssues  nvolved  n  an  ssue  lke  phshng  or  electronc  votng 
reveals  that  the  problems  that  we  are  confrontng  have  both  a 
technology  and  a  polcy  component.  Further,  wth  our  ncrease 
dependency  on  computng  and  communcaton  to  nstrument 
physcal  nfrastructures,  such  as  electrc  power,  water,  gas,  etc. 
we fnd that they are vulnerable to nformaton attack as well.  To 
address these grand challenge socetal problem,  n June 00, the 
NSF  has  establshed  a  Scence  and  Technology  Center  enttled 
“TRUST: Team for Research n Ubqutous Secure Technologes” 
between Berkeley (lead), CMU, Cornell, Stanford and Vanderblt 
wth outreach partners at San Jose State, Mlls and Smth College. 
In ths talk, I wll gve you a snap shot of the knds of research, 
educaton, technology  transfer, prvacy and  polcy  work  that we 
have underway.  Rather than present a smorgasbord of work at the 
Center  I  wll  gve  a  selected  few  examples  of  the  work, 
technology transfer and mpact that the Center has already had n 
the area of network embedded systems: 
There  has  been  a  great  deal  of  exctement  n  recent  years 
concernng the evoluton of sensor webs of smart dust. There has 
been  a  very  substantve  actve  world  wde  n  ths  area  and  n 
partcular at Berkeley there have now been over sx generaton of 
“motes”  for  these  sensor  webs,  and  at  least  three  new  start  ups 
have  arsen  to  commercalze  these  developments.  I  wll  survey 
these  developments  and  where  they  have  brought  us  n  what  s 
undoubtedly a very mportant new class of computng nvolvng 
an  ntegraton  of  communcaton  and  computng.  I  wll  descrbe 
how  the technology push  s  matched  by  the  applcatons  pull  of 
numerous dfferent applcatons.  
Throughout the talk, I wll hghlght the efforts of my group and 
that  of  my  colleagues  especally  Culler,  Pster,  Wagner  and 
Brewer n “closng the loop” around these networked embedded 
systems.  We  beleve  that  ths  closng  the  loop  brngs  nto  sharp 
focus  the  real  tme  constrants  and  ssues  nherent  n  the  use  of 
networked  embedded  systems.  Further,  the  most  mportant  new 
drectons  n  sensor  webs  nvolve  ths  new  drecton  beyond 
smply  sensng  and  montorng  the  physcal  envronment  and 
nfrastructure. In partcular, I wll descrbe the range of methods 
and  algorthms  needed  to  track  multple  targets  n  a  sensor  web 
and to be able to pursue them.  I wll also dscuss securty aspects 
of usng sensor networks  n physcal nfrastructures.
