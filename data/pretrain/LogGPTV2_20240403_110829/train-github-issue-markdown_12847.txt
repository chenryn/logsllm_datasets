I am using SciPy (version 1.2.0) for some reasons with a simulation software.  
In my case, I need to model the structure in the simulation software based on
the results of calculation on variables. The results from the simulation
software is the objective function.  
However, mostly the design variables can not form the structure. If these
infeasible variables pass into simulation software, it will generate a mistake
which causes the optimization stop. How can I ask SLSQP to reject infeasible
varibales strictly untill the feasible one generate and then pass the feasible
one into simulation software to provide the objective value for optimization?
