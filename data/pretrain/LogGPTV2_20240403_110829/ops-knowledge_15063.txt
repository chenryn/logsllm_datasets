User: The following is 20 lines of a system log. Each line consists of a timestamp, log level, process id, relevant software component, and the log content. Think step-by-step and step and summarize this log chunk:

Assistant: This log chunk shows the system going to sleep, waking up, and then various processes being enabled and deallocated. It begins with the system entering sleep mode, followed by the AppleCamIn and ThunderboltNHIType2 processes being woken up. The system then goes into hibernation mode, with various memory allocations and deallocations taking place. After the system wakes up, processes such as sharingd, com.apple.AddressBook.InternetAccountsBridge, ntpd, QQ, and pkd are enabled and deallocated. Finally, the log ends with the QQ process deallocating a task.
