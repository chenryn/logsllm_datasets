 **Description**
I would like to have the run-config available for inspection in the dag
details.
**Use case / motivation**
Figuring out what was used to trigger a dag, partially for reuse, but also to
introspect what went wrong. It's currently possible to use the REST-API for
that but a step removed, and our users of Airflow aren't supposed to use APIs.
**Are you willing to submit a PR?**
With enough guidance yes.
