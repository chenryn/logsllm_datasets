Figure 8: Three operating regimes of Braidio
But the above description over-simpliﬁes the problem. The
three modes are not identical in performance since they have
differences in hardware, path loss, reﬂection loss, etc. As a
result, they have different signal-to-noise ratios which trans-
lates into differences in range and throughput. Intuitively,
Braidio in active mode should offer more throughput and
range compared to the passive receiver mode, which in turn
should have higher throughput and range than the backscat-
ter mode. Thus, an energy-aware carrier ofﬂoad method
needs to consider which modes are available at any given
time, and what performance they offer.
4.1 Braidio Operating Region
Braidio operates in three distinct regimes as illustrated in
Figure 8. Regime A allows us to move the carrier to either
end-point depending on the energy availability, and presents
the maximum ﬂexibility in the use of the three operating
modes of Braidio. When devices operate in this regime,
we can enable power-proportional carrier ofﬂoad, where the
end-point with more energy availability takes a lions share of
the overall cost of communication. In Regime B, the trans-
mitter has to generate a carrier since the backscatter mode no
longer works. However, if the transmitter has more energy
than the receiver, it is possible to operate for the receiver to
switch its carrier off and operate in passive receiver mode. In
Regime C, the transmitter and receiver have to generate the
carrier since the SNR is too low for the receiver to decode
via a passive envelope detector.
4.2 Carrier Ofﬂoad Algorithm
The carrier ofﬂoad algorithm is the decision engine that
determines which mode should be used. Figure 9 shows a
useful way to visualize the options available to a Braidio
radio at any given time. The x-axis is the efﬁciency (in bit-
s/joule) for the transmitter, and the y-axis is the efﬁciency (in
bits/joule) for the receiver. Let us ﬁrst look at the three cor-
ners of the triangle, labeled A, B, and C. These correspond
to the transmitter–receiver efﬁciencies for each of the three
operating modes. The active mode (point A) is somewhat
symmetric in efﬁciency at the two endpoints; the passive re-
ceiver mode (point B) has higher efﬁciency for the receiv-
er than transmitter; and the backscatter mode (point C) has
higher efﬁciency for the transmitter because all the overhead
is shifted to the receiver.

Figure 9: Dynamic range of power assignment of Braidio
in terms of transmitter to receiver energy efﬁciency ratio.
By multiplexing across these modes, different power ra-
tios can be achieved as shown in the shaded region in the
ﬁgure (∆ABC). While the shaded regions represent the
feasible transmitter–receiver power ratios, note that the d-
ifferent modes of operation also have different overall efﬁ-
ciencies (i.e. the cumulative transmitter + receiver efﬁcien-
cy). As a result, not all the feasible operating points may be
390
desirable. The optimal operating points in terms of overall
energy efﬁciency would lie on line BC of the triangle since
this has the best cumulative efﬁciency. So, for example, take
the case of a transmitter–receiver pair who have an energy
ratio of 100:1. To operate in a power-proportional manner,
they would need to pick a point on the dotted line in the ﬁg-
ure. The point on that line that maximizes the number of bits
they can transfer while operating power-proportionally is the
point P on line BC.
This leads us to the working of the carrier ofﬂoad algo-

formation about their battery status using the active radio.
Given this information, they need to decide what operating
modes to use, and what fraction of the time to use the mode
to achieve power-proportional operation. The possible oper-
ating modes that the two end-points can use for communi-
cation are limited by two factors: a) the battery status of the
end-points and b) the SNR of the different links.
Such considerations are taken into account in a pruning
step that limits the space of possible options. The two end-
points use probe packets over the two links to determine the
SNR and bitrate parameters, and exchange this information.
At this point, each end-point has information about a) the
energy-level at the two end-points, and b) the power efﬁ-
ciency on the transmitter and receiver side for the highest
bitrate that can be supported for each of the three modes of
operation (measured in bits per joule).
Let E1 and E2 are the energy levels at the two ends, and Ti
means that in mode i, the transmitter consumes Ti joules to
send one bit of data to a receiver, and Ri is the corresponding
cost to receive one bit of data. The carrier ofﬂoad algorithm
tries to ﬁnd the optimal strategy in terms of what fraction of
time to transmit in each mode pi such that we can be power-
proportional in the energy consumed at the two ends. This
can be formulated as:

Once the fraction of time to operate each mode is de-
termined, Braidio simply switches between the modes af-
ter a certain number of packets to achieve that proportion.
For example, if p1 = 0.5, p2 = 0.25, p3 = 0.25 then a
possible sequence of modes could be Active-Active-Passive-
Backscatter (repeated).
Of course, the wireless link is dynamic, particularly in a
mobile environment. Braidio simply falls back to the active
mode if the current operating mode is performing poorly.
Thus, when in passive receiver mode, the receiver switch-
es to active receiver mode when it observes that the SNR is
391
too low. When the backscatter mode performs poorly, the
receiver turns off the carrier, which implicitly informs the
transmitter that it needs to turn on the carrier. Switching
modes in the other direction is easy too — when SNR is
high in active mode, the system can either switch into pas-
sive receiver mode or backscatter mode depending on the
direction of energy asymmetry. Braidio also periodically re-
computes the ratio of using different modes depending on
observed dynamics. If SNR or loss rate changes signiﬁcant-
ly, it re-calculates the ratio according to Equation 1.

IMPLEMENTATION
The design of Braidio has evolved over several hardware
iterations that we have used to measure and identify prob-
lems. Our ﬁrst version of Braidio was designed entirely from
off-the-shelf components — a TI CC2541 Bluetooth/BLE
radio, a low-power UHF reader IC (AS3993 [2]), and a Moo
Backscatter tag. Our measurements of this platform were
highly unsatisfactory from a power perspective, which in
turn led to further revisions. Our second version of Braidio
was designed to further improve power draw. This version
used a directional coupler for isolation, and a Zero-IF method
to directly convert the signal to baseband. Our measure-
ments with this platform were also unsatisfactory since the
reader by itself combined more than 240mW of power. Our
third version of Braidio is the one that we use in this paper
and describe further.
Modular design: As we proceeded through the evolution
of Braidio, we also made our system more modular since this
helped us re-use hardware components when we only need-
ed to change a part of the design rather than the entire radio.
It also helped with isolate errors and simplify debugging.
Figure 10 shows the ﬁnal version of the hardware that we
use in this paper. It consist of a microcontroller and active
radio on the back of PCB, a passive receiver module and
baseband ampliﬁcation circuit, an antenna switching mod-
ule, three chip antennas and SAW ﬁlters. We connect these
components using U.FL. cables. The board also has a Blue-
tooth module on the back acting as the active transceiver.
Note that these components can be further integrated into an
ASIC version of Braidio. Both the modules and main board
are made with 4 layer PCB process for better performance.
RF traces are designed under controlled impedance using co-
planar wave guide calculator [51]. A detailed description of
each hardware module is shown in Table 4.
Implementation challenges: We faced many low-level
implementation challenges. One major issue that we dealt
with was the limited size of Braidio. Braidio is designed to
work with mobile, even wearable devices, so form factor is
an important issue. Therefore, instead of using dipole anten-
na which measured more than 15cm (used on Moo and WIS-
P), we used chip antennas to keep Braidio small. This design
choice necessitated that we improve sensitivity of receiver.
In addition, having multiple antennas for antenna diversity
on a small PCB board required careful placement to deliver
good performance. We also used U.FL. connectors instead
of SMA to reduce size. Finally, another challenge we faced

RFID Reader Board:
In order to have a good baseline
to compare our results against, we use the AS3993 Fermi
reader from AMS [2]. We choose AS3993 because it is
among the lowest power commercial readers. In addition,
it supports direct mode and makes it possible to implement
customized Backscatter protocols. We developed an adapter
board to connect it to an Arduino, as shown in Figure 11.
6. EVALUATION
We now turn to an end-to-end evaluation of Braidio. We
start with a full empirical characterization, and use this char-
acterization to design a simulator. Our simulator allows us
to understand performance improvements of using Braidio
when devices with different energy budgets for communica-
tion.
6.1 Braidio v.s. commercial reader
We ﬁrst evaluate the performance of Braidio against the
commercial AS3993 reader. Figure 12 shows the bit error
rate of Braidio and commercial reader at 100kbps. Braidio
has an operational distance of 1.8m, whereas the commer-
cial reader operates up to 3m. So, as expected, our design
has about 40% lower range than a commercial reader. How-
ever, the commercial reader also consumes 640mW while
Braidio consumes only 129mW. Thus, Braidio is about 5×
as efﬁcient as the commercial reader. Note that the AS3993
is the lowest power reader that we found, and gains are even
larger against other readers (Table 2). The experiment is car-
ried out in an empty, 6m × 6m room. We clear the area to
minimize the effect of environmental reﬂections.
6.2 Characterizing Braidio Performance
In this experiment we characterize the performance of Braidio
using two metrics: a) bit error rates at different distances,
and b) transmit and receive energy-efﬁciency in bits/joule.
Our goal is to identify the practical boundaries between the
three regimes of operation outlined in §4.1, and the perfor-
mance that Braidio can achieve in these different regimes.
BER vs Distance: Figure 13 shows the bit error rate (BER)
at increasing distances for the operating modes at differen-
t bitrates. The active mode operates well beyond 6 meters
(which is the maximum distance we can have in our setting),
so we do not show it in the plot. As expected, the backscat-
ter mode has the lowest range. At 1Mbps, backscatter has a
range of slightly less than a meter (for BER < 0.01), but the
range increases to 1.8m at 100kbps and to 2.4m at 10kbp-
s. The passive receiver mode operates at up to 3.9 meters
at 1Mbps, and increases to 4.2m at 100kbps and 5.1m at
10kbps.
