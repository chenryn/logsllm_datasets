un-firewalled connection.  Additionally, unused ports were left open leaving the network 
vulnerable.  Thankfully, no damage was done to the system and power service was not 
affected.  Reports indicate that the attacker was attempting to penetrate further into the 
network for access to more critical controls when the intrusion was discovered.7
Targeted attacks on plant control systems are not the only threat faced by these 
networks.  Because parts of many common plant control systems rely on off the shelf 
operating platforms, they are also vulnerable to mass malware programs as well.  This was 
the case in 2003 when the Slammer worm brought down part of the safety monitoring 
system at the then offline Davis-Besse nuclear plant in Ohio.  The increased traffic from the 
worm caused denial of services to parts of the plant safety and monitoring networks which 
became inaccessible to other parts of the network. The worm entered the plant’s control 
network through an unsecured contractor connection to the contractor’s business network 
which bypassed normal firewalls.8  The Repository of Industrial Security Incidents (RISI) 
released a report in March of 2010 indicating that nearly 50% of all reported cyber security 
incidents were caused by viruses, worms and Trojans.9
In addition to defending against intentional malicious attacks, the security design of a 
control system must also be prepared to deal with unintentional disgruntled employees and 
security incidents caused by untrained users and faulty software.  Although unintentional, 
this type of incident can be just as dangerous, if not more so then an intentional attack 
because it will often originate from inside the control network from a trusted source.  This 
was the case when in 1999 a petroleum pipeline in Washington exploded and led to the 
deaths of three people.  The cause of this incident, which many recognized to be the first 
cyber incident which led directly to a fatality, was ruled to have been caused by a 
combination of factors.  One of the primary causes however, was a failure in the control 
system which prohibited the operator from relieving pressure on the pipe to prevent the 
explosion.  An additional finding during the investigation of the incident was that adherence 
to NIST standard 800-53, one of the standards referenced later in this document, could 
have prevented the incident from ever occurring.10
2.2.  Possible Outcomes of an Attack 
The effects of a successful attack on an industrial control system can vary greatly 
depending on what the system is controlling.  A general control philosophy for protecting 
critical or potentially dangerous processes is to put a system of interlocks into place.  An 
interlock is either a piece of hardware, or logic built into software to prevent equipment from

operating in a way that it could damage itself or create a dangerous situation.  An example 
of an interlock is the device in a seatbelt that prevents the belt from extending when the 
break is applied with a certain force.  In many cases, the worst case outcome of an attack 
is whatever occurs when one of these interlocks is broken.  In the best case scenario, after 
an attack has been detected it will be cleaned up, investigated, and the vulnerability will be 
closed. 
In some scenarios an incident could lead to expensive and potentially dangerous 
equipment failures.  Because of the presence of large quantities of energy rich fuels and 
complex equipment and controls, many potentially dangerous scenarios exist.  Often these 
scenarios are documented within the logic of a control system and can be discovered 
simply by deciphering the conditions that the logic tries to prevent.  An example is the 
algorithms that control the mixture of Oxygen and fuel in a boiler.  These controls are 
designed to manage the firing rate of a boiler, however if they were tampered with, it is 
possible that the mixture could become fuel rich.  If there was an influx of oxygen at that 
point, a large explosion could result.  In a well designed system, hardwired interlocks 
should prevent this from happening; however these could be functioning incorrectly or be 
disabled entirely. 
Another possible scenario involving a boiler would be to disable the Forced Draft (FD) 
fan, a fan which blows air into a boiler, while leaving the Induced Draft (ID) fan, a fan that 
sucks air out of a boiler, running at full.  Boilers are designed for normal operation at 
around neutral pressure.  The fans balance the pressure keeping the boiler at this neutral 
operating pressure.  However, if the balance is disturbed, the pressure produced by the 
fans is enough to collapse the walls of a large boiler causing an implosion. 
Other portions of the plant contain similar weaknesses.  A steam turbine, for example 
uses pressurized superheated steam to rotate the blades of a turbine to produce 
mechanical energy.  A valve and spray nozzle up stream of the turbine sprays water into 
the steam to control the temperature.  If this valve was allowed to open fully and spray 
enough water to saturate the steam, droplets of water would blast the blades of the 
turbine.  This could warp or crack a turbine blade, a costly repair which could cause months 
of down time. 
Damage to plant equipment and injury or loss of life in areas near the incident are not 
the only possible outcome of tampering with a control system.  Many modern plants use a 
process called Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) to decrease pollutants in plant 
emissions by injecting them with Ammonia.  Because the process requires a large amount 
of ammonia, many plants store massive quantities of anhydrous ammonia on site.  If a 
weakness was found in the controls that allowed an attack to vent this gas to the 
atmosphere it could pose a serious public health risk to a large area around the plant. 
 In 2007 a leaked government video showing a government demonstration known as 
the “Aurora Generator Test” which displayed the affects of an exploited vulnerability in a

Presented at DEFCON 18, July 29th through August 1st 2010, Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas NV 
control system leading to the violent destruction of a turbine generator.11
  The video, which 
is light on details of the vulnerability, is a graphic demonstration of the type of damage that 
can be done when the control network has been compromised by an entity with malicious 
intent. 
The feasibility of attacks on these major pieces of equipment is very much dependant 
on the design of the control system.  Often critical equipment will have redundant interlocks, 
one set independent of the control network to prevent damage in the case of a control 
system failure.  Examples of this include pressure safety valves, set to open automatically 
and relieve excess pressure when conditions reach a certain point.  This device operates 
without a signal from the control system.  Careful planning and redundancy required on 
some of the most dangerous equipment, like a nuclear reactor make the very worst 
scenarios unlikely or nearly impossible. 
Aside from being immediately dangerous to plant personnel, high risk equipment 
failures like these can take months or years to repair and cost millions of dollars to rebuild.  
In addition to the direct cost to repair the equipment, the power outages caused by this can 
also have a devastating economic impact to the entire region.  The 2003 power outage in 
the Northeastern United States, which was ruled not to be the result of a cyber attack, 
caused a loss of power for more than 50 million people, is estimated to have cost nearly $6 
billion and lead to at least eleven fatalities.12
  A similar result is a feasible result of a well 
planned malicious attack plan. 
Another concern is that of a cyber attack being used on US infrastructure as part of a 
larger military offensive.  Attacks like the ones mentioned above could be used to disable 
vital parts of US Infrastructure leaving the US vulnerable in a time of war.

3. Governances and Standards 
3.1.  NERC 
Cyber security in an industrial power plant, excluding nuclear, is largely governed by a 
set of Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) standards created by the North American 
Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC). A facility can be fined up to $1,000,000 per day 
per violation13
 for failing to meet the requirements of these standards. There are eight 
NERC standards which highlight the primary methods and goals of a cyber security 
framework; CIP-001 contains reporting requirements. 
• CIP-002 Critical Asset Identification – Identifying which assets should be protected 
and the varying levels of risk associated with each asset. 
• CIP-003 Security Management Controls – Defines system users and sets up 
responsibilities and access controls based on need. 
• CIP-004 Personnel & Training – Further defines access controls and responsibilities 
of users and sets minimum training standards for awareness of security policies. 
• CIP-005 Electronic Security Perimeters – Creates the idea of security perimeters 
around critical cyber assets.  This standard also controls how items inside the 
perimeter are accessed. 
• CIP-006 Physical Security of Critical Cyber Assets – Defines guidelines for a 
physical security plan for critical cyber assets and physical security perimeters. 
• CIP-007 Systems Security Management – Defines processes for protecting assets 
within an electronic security perimeter. 
• CIP-008 Incident Reporting and Response Planning – Sets up requirements for an 
emergency response plan and defines requirements for the reporting of incidents. 
• CIP-009 Recovery Plans for Critical Cyber Assets – Sets requirements for recovery 
plans, backups, and planed incident drills. 
3.2.  NIST 
In addition to NERC requirements, the Federal Information Security Management Act 
(FIMSA) created a set of standards managed by the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology (NIST) which apply to federal agencies serving a nearly identical purpose to 
the NERC CIPs, though somewhat more in-depth and without financial penalties.  While 
adherence to these standards is not directly required for non-governmental organizations, 
and much of the content overlaps the NERC standards, the NIST guidelines are worth 
consideration. 
• FIPS Publication 199 Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information 
and Information Systems – Similar in content to CIP-002, used to category critical 
assets and levels of risk for each asset, typically intended for informational assets.

an electronic security perimeter.  Provides detailed descriptions about the processes 
and methods described in FIPS 200.

Information Systems – Criteria to evaluate security in a control system. 
• Special Publication 800-60 Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information 
Systems to Security Categories – Further detail on defining critical assets and levels 
of risk.  Contains more detail then FIPS 199. 
• Special Publication 800-82 Guide to Industrial Control System Security – Guidelines 
for securing an industrial control system from cyber threats. 
• And many others ranging from cell phone use to printer security requirements, but 
the above should be of the most use. 
3.3.  NRC 
Finally, nuclear plants are exempt from compliance with NERC standards.  Instead 
nuclear plants are mandated by NRC Title 10 Code of Federal Regulations Section 73.54 
which require a plant’s “computer and communications systems be adequately protected 
against cyber attacks”.  Because of the vagueness of this requirement the NRC released 
regulatory guide 5.71, Cyber Security Programs for Nuclear Facilities.  This guide is based 
heavily on the principals in NIST publications 800-53 and 800-82.

4. Exceeding Compliance with Overlapping Standards 
4.1. Purpose  
Compliance is often a very difficult thing to achieve in general; to compound this, cyber 
security compliance for industry is relatively new, and most people who know anything 
about their particular site, no little about cyber security. Conversely, those who know the 
details of cyber security (usually IT/CS professionals), often know little or nothing about 
industrial processes. This presents a significant challenge. It is not as simple as contracting 
a group of IT professionals and security experts to come in and secure a network, it is 
much more complicated because IT professionals aren’t usually trained for industrial 
environments. To compound the situation further, some sites are required to deal with 
multiple overlapping and possibly conflicting standards on the same subjects. For all the 
above reasons, it is far better to set a goal of exceeding compliance rather than meeting 
compliance; this is the only real approach to guarantee compliance. 
4.2. Scope 
This section will attempt to provide the reader with a comprehensive security plan and 
techniques that can be used and tailored to a site, to help exceed compliance with multiple 
overlapping governances. It is written with the understanding that exceeding compliance by 
automation and meticulous design will save on overhead in the near and long terms in 
comparison to simply meeting compliance with manual labor intensive methods. 
4.3. Management Policies, Procedures & List 
All compliance activities will require documentation and records as well as evidence or 
proof. It is important to understand the distinction between documentation and records and 
evidence and how each plays its role in compliance and security. To give a few examples, 
documentation and records may refer to drawings, configuration data, backup drive 
images, etc. while evidence may refer to things like sign-off sheets for drawings, original 
configuration scanner raw output, and backup image validation and verification. To put it 
another way, documentation and records are required for operational, maintenance and 
design purposes while evidence is required for internal and external audits. This section will 
provide a recommended set of compliance procedures and details of what needs to be 
included in each. Details of what documentation and record requirements are 
recommended as well as methods to maintain an audit trail will also be given.  
4.3.1. Master Lists 
There are three master lists usually required for compliance and always recommend by 
good policy. These lists should be hierarchical in nature, the highest level providing 
information about sites, the next about systems and the last providing basic data about 
devices. These lists will be used later for classification activities.

July 28th 2010 
Presented at DEFCON 18, July 29th through August 1st 2010, Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas NV 
4.3.1.1. Sites and Systems 
If the organization consists of multiple satellite entities such as a major power 
producer with multiple plants, the first master list should identify basic information about 
each site. If the organization consists of only a single site, the first master list should 
provide basic data about each system since a sites list would be fairly pointless and of 
no use. Fields contained in these lists should include the following at a minimum, 
additional fields can be added by the organization, but it is not recommended that any of 
the fields be removed: 
Sites List 
• Site Name 
• Location 
• Address 
• Type - e.g. coal, nuclear, etc 
• Peak load output 
• Responsible Organizations and contact information 
• Classification – discussed later 
The sites list should include control centers, backup control centers, auxiliary control 
centers, large transmission substations, facilities critical to system restoration, automatic 
load shedding, special protection systems and finally generating facilities. 
Systems List 
• Site 
• System Name 
• Description 
• Responsible Party 
• Classification – discussed later 
The systems lists should be comprehensive for a given site and will generally be site 
specific. Systems lists are usually defined during plant construction and are not difficult 
to obtain. For the purposes of cyber security compliance, the systems list may require 
some modification. For examples of the two lists described above Refer to section  7 
Appendix A: Examples. Additional lists such as I/O lists and bill-of-materials (BOM) will 
also be useful. 
4.3.1.2.  Cyber Devices 
Industrial Cyber Security: From the Perspective of the Power Sector                                Page 17 of 65 
July 28th 2010 
Presented at DEFCON 18, July 29th through August 1st 2010, Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas NV 
A decision will need to be made regarding what level of device to include on this list. 
A related decision will need to be made regarding how each site defines a cyber device. 
For example, one would not want the list to include end devices like instrument 
transmitters. Of course, all end devices must be captured on documentation somewhere 
such as connection diagrams and I/O lists, but these devices are not easily protected 
from cyber attack and it is assumed that far worse holes exist; the time may come when 
instrument manufacturers include added security measures. 
The following is a recommendation for defining the term Cyber Device: A 
programmable electronic device whose primary programming interface is not 
implemented using a local non electronic method such as a keypad. The latter exclusion 
is intended to eliminate from compliance requirements, those devices which an attacker 
could not easily access, program and control from a remote location. Non-remotely 
accessible devices should be installed in locations of higher order devices to provide 
added physical protection by inclusion, whenever possible. Fields contained in this list 
should include the following at a minimum, additional fields can be added by the 
organization, but it’s not recommended that any of the fields be removed: 
• Characteristic Identifier/Tag 
• Unit 
• Type – e.g. PLC, DCS, PC, etc. 
• Manufacturer 
• Model 
• Operating system 
• Number of Ethernet ports 
• IP address and host name 
• Equipment description 
• Approximate location 
• Physical security – Yes/No 
• Physical security type – Camera, lock, etc.
