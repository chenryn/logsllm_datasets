User: How to protect your company's network security from common cyber attacks and malware? You need to consider security measures such as network topology, firewall rules, intrusion detection systems, virus scanning, etc.
Assistant: 1. Realize network topology design, segmentation and isolation. By designing different network segments, the network is divided into internal network, DMZ and external network, etc., to ensure the isolation between internal and external networks, making it difficult for attackers to transmit to the company's key business systems. 2. Make sure the firewall rules are in place. Improve network security by setting up proper firewall rules, specific rules should be set for inbound and outbound filtering, disabling unnecessary services and ports, controlling external access, etc. 3. Install an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS). An IDS is a system that monitors logs, events, traffic, and more. IPS can report and prevent specific attacks, and intercept and block malicious traffic. 4. Configure the virus scanning engine to detect and remove potential viruses and malware in real time. Make sure all systems have virus protection software installed and virus definitions updated. 5. Strengthen access control, strengthen authentication and access control to ensure that only authenticated users can log in and access the company's system. 6. To encrypt key data, appropriate technologies, such as SSL and TLS protocols, should be used to achieve secure communication on the website. 7. Strengthen employee security awareness training, conduct regular network security training for employees, let employees fully understand the importance of network security, and improve their own protection capabilities and awareness. Employee behavior is often one of the weakest links in cybersecurity, so this is very important.
