**Abstract:**
Recent advancements in DNA sequencing technologies have made it feasible for individuals to obtain and store their fully sequenced human genomes. This widespread availability opens up significant opportunities in health-related fields, enabling genomic applications and tests to be conducted computationally rather than in vitro. As genome-enabled medicine becomes increasingly preventive and personalized, new applications will emerge. However, this progress also raises significant privacy concerns, including the potential loss, theft, or misuse of genomic data. In this paper, we address these challenges by focusing on three key applications: Paternity Tests, Personalized Medicine, and Genetic Compatibility Tests. After analyzing these applications and their privacy requirements, we propose a set of efficient techniques based on private set operations. These techniques allow us to implement in silico some operations currently performed via in vitro methods, ensuring security and privacy. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed techniques are both feasible and practical.

**1. Introduction**
Over the past four decades, DNA sequencing has been a driving force in life sciences, producing full genome sequences for thousands of viruses, bacteria, and eukaryotic organisms. Modern High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) technologies have further accelerated this trend, with the first diploid human genome sequences recently produced and a project to sequence 1,000 human genomes essentially completed. The goal is to sequence an individual human genome, composed of about 3 billion DNA nucleotides, for less than $1,000 by 2012 and even less than $100 within five years, making human genome sequencing a commodity.

The ubiquity of genomic data creates enormous opportunities and challenges, particularly in addressing the unsustainable rise of healthcare costs through predictive, preventive, participatory, and personalized medicine (P4 medicine). However, this progress also exacerbates ethical, security, and privacy concerns. A full genome sequence not only uniquely identifies an individual but also contains information about their ethnic heritage, disease predispositions, and other phenotypic traits. Traditional privacy approaches, such as de-identification, become ineffective in the genomic era, as the genome itself is the ultimate identifier.

Federal laws, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), provide general frameworks for protecting genetic information. However, these laws do not offer detailed technical guidelines for secure and privacy-preserving storage and querying of genomic data. It is crucial to start investigating these issues now, given their complexity and potential societal impact.

We can envision a general framework involving two types of entities: (1) Data Centers where genomic data is stored, and (2) Agents/Agencies interested in querying this data. The granularity of Data Centers can vary, from personal devices to national or international repositories. Various types of Agents/Agencies, ranging from individuals and physicians to government agencies, might query different aspects of genomic data with varying privacy requirements.

The main challenge is to support such queries with low storage costs and reasonable query times while meeting privacy and security requirements. Current methods for privacy-preserving data querying do not scale to genomic data sizes. We adapt and deploy efficient cryptographic techniques to address specific genomic queries and applications, as described below.

**1.1 Applications**
The availability of affordable full genome sequencing makes it possible to query and test genomic information using computational techniques. We consider three concrete examples:

- **Paternity Tests:** Establish whether a male individual is the biological father of another individual using genetic fingerprinting. Current practices raise security and privacy concerns, as testing companies must be trusted with the accuracy and privacy of test results. Ideally, any two individuals should be able to conduct a privacy-preserving paternity test without third-party involvement.
  
- **Personalized Medicine:** Tailors treatment and medication to the precise genetic makeup of an individual patient. For example, measurements of erbB2 protein in cancer patients determine the effectiveness of trastuzumab monoclonal antibody. Full genome sequencing will further stimulate the development of personalized medicine.

- **Genetic Compatibility Tests:** Assess the risk of transmitting genetic diseases with Mendelian inheritance to children. For instance, Beta-Thalassemia minor and Lynch Syndrome can be accurately predicted, allowing couples to make informed decisions about family planning.

**1.2 Roadmap**
Motivated by the emerging affordability of full genome sequencing, we combine domain knowledge in biology, genomics, bioinformatics, security, privacy, and applied cryptography to understand the corresponding challenges. We analyze the specific requirements of the three applications mentioned above, considering today's in vitro procedures and their security and privacy requirements in the digital domain. Our approach allows us to develop specialized protocols with lower overhead. We demonstrate the practicality of our protocols through experiments on commodity hardware, and our source code is publicly available.

**2. Related Work**
The security research community has developed mechanisms for secure computation on genomic data. Several cryptographic protocols have been proposed for private searching, matching, and evaluating the similarity of strings, including DNA sequences. Prior work has also considered specific privacy-preserving genomic operations. This section overviews relevant prior results and highlights their limitations.

- **Searching and Matching DNA:**
  - Troncoso-Pastoriza et al. [71] proposed a privacy-preserving and error-resilient protocol for string searching. The technique handles errors and maintains the privacy of both the template and the snippet.
  - Blanton and Aliasgari [4] improved on [71], reducing computational and communication complexities.
  - Other protocols for secure pattern matching include [27] and [36], which use homomorphic encryption and secure oblivious automata evaluation.
  - Recent work in [47] realizes secure computation of the CODIS test, combining garbled circuits and secure pattern matching.

- **Similarity of DNA Sequences:**
  - Jha et al. [42] proposed techniques for secure edit distance computation, which is useful for sequence alignment and computing Smith-Waterman scores.

These results form the basis for our work, and we build upon them to address the specific challenges of fully-sequenced human genomes.
