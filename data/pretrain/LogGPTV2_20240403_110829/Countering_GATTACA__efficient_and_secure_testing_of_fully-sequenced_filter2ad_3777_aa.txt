ABSTRACT
Recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies have put
ubiquitous availability of fully sequenced human genomes within
reach.
It is no longer hard to imagine the day when everyone
will have the means to obtain and store one’s own DNA sequence.
Widespread and affordable availability of fully sequenced genomes
immediately opens up important opportunities in a number of health-
related ﬁelds.
In particular, common genomic applications and
tests performed in vitro today will soon be conducted computation-
ally, using digitized genomes. New applications will be developed
as genome-enabled medicine becomes increasingly preventive and
personalized. However, this progress also prompts signiﬁcant pri-
vacy challenges associated with potential loss, theft, or misuse of
genomic data. In this paper, we begin to address genomic privacy
by focusing on three important applications: Paternity Tests, Per-
sonalized Medicine, and Genetic Compatibility Tests. After care-
fully analyzing these applications and their privacy requirements,
we propose a set of efﬁcient techniques based on private set oper-
ations. This allows us to implement in in silico some operations
that are currently performed via in vitro methods, in a secure fash-
ion. Experimental results demonstrate that proposed techniques are
both feasible and practical today.

INTRODUCTION
Over the past four decades, DNA sequencing has been one of
the major driving forces in life-sciences, producing full genome se-
quences of thousands of viruses and bacteria, and dozens of eukary-
otic organisms, from yeast to man (e.g., [2, 30, 40, 76]). This trend
is only being accentuated by modern High-Throughput Sequenc-
ing (HTS) technologies: the ﬁrst diploid human genome sequences
were recently produced [52, 74, 78] and a project to sequence 1,000
human genomes has been essentially completed [19, 43, 66]. Dif-
ferent HTS technologies are competing to sequence an individual

address one of the greatest societal challenges of our time:
the
unsustainable rise of health care costs, by ushering a new era of
genome-enabled predictive, preventive, participatory, and person-
alized medicine (“P4” medicine). In time, genomes could become
part of the Electronic Medical Record of every individual [38].
However, widespread availability of HTS technologies and ge-
nomic data exacerbates ethical, security, and privacy concerns [11].
A full genome sequence not only uniquely identiﬁes each one of us;
it also contains information about, for instance, our ethnic heritage,
disease predispositions, and many other phenotypic traits [23, 64].
Traditional approaches to privacy, such as de-identiﬁcation [54],
become completely moot in the genomic era, since the genome
itself is the ultimate identiﬁer. To further compound the privacy
problem, health information is increasingly shared electronically
among insurance companies, health care providers and employers.
This, coupled with the possibility of creating large centralized ge-
nome repositories, raises the specter of possible abuses.
Some federal laws have been passed to begin addressing privacy
issues. The 2003 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act (HIPAA) provides a general framework for protecting and shar-
ing Protected Health Information (PHI) [20, 49, 55]. In 2008, the
Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was adopted
to prohibit discrimination on the basis of genetic information. with
respect to health insurance and employment [73]. While providing
general guidelines and a basic safety net, current legislation does
not offer detailed technical information about safe and privacy-
preserving ways for storing and querying genomes. In short, tech-
nical issues of security and privacy for HTS and genomic data re-
main both important and relatively poorly understood.
While privacy issues are not yet hampering progress in basic ge-
nomic research, it is not too early to start investigating them, par-
ticularly, in light of their complexity, potential impact on society,
and current efforts to reform the health care system. It remains un-
clear where personal genomic information will be stored, who will
have access to it, and how it will be queried and shared. To re-
main ﬂexible, we can imagine a general framework comprised of
two kinds of basic entities: (1) Data Centers where genomic data
is stored, and (2) Agents/Agencies interested in querying this data.
Granularity of Data Centers could vary. At one end of the spec-
trum, every individual could be her own Data Center and store the
genome on a personal computer, cell phone, or some other device.
At the other extreme, we could envision national or even interna-
691tional Data Centers storing millions (or even billions) of genomic
sequences. Data Centers could also be envisioned at the granular-
ity of family, school, pharmacy, laboratory, hospital, city, county
or state. Likewise, many different types of Agents/Agencies are
conceivable, ranging from individuals and personal physicians, to
family members, pharmacies, hospitals, insurance companies, em-
ployers and government agencies (e.g., the FBI), or international
organizations. Various Agents/Agencies might be allowed to query
different aspects of genomic data and might be required to satisfy
different query privacy requirements. In addition, one could imag-
ine cases (e.g., criminal search or proprietary diagnostic technol-
ogy) where both the genomic data and queries against it must re-
main private.
The main security and privacy challenge is how to support such
queries with low storage costs and reasonably short query times,
while satisfying privacy and security requirements associated with
a given type of transaction. Unfortunately, current methods for
privacy-preserving data querying do not scale to genomic data sizes.
Several cryptographic techniques have been proposed that —
though not addressing the case of fully-sequenced genomes — fo-
cus on private computation over genomic fragments. Speciﬁcally,
they allow two or more parties to engage in protocols that reveal
only the end-result of a given computation on their respective ge-
nomic data, without leaking any additional information. The main
thrust of this paper is to adapt and deploy efﬁcient cryptographic
techniques to address speciﬁc genomic queries and applications,
described below.
1.1 Applications
As mentioned above, availability of affordable full genome se-
quencing makes it increasingly possible to query and test genomic
information not only in vitro, but also in silico using computational
techniques. We consider three concrete examples of such tests and
corresponding privacy-relevant scenarios.
Paternity Tests establish whether a male individual is the biolog-
ical father of another individual, using genetic ﬁngerprinting. Ad-
vances in biotechnology facilitated DNA paternity tests and stimu-
lated the creation of hundreds of online companies offering test-
ing via self-administered cheek swabs for as little as $79 (e.g.,
http://www.gtldna.net). However, this practice raises several
security and privacy concerns: the testing company must be trusted
with privacy and accuracy of test results, as well as with swabs that
might yield full genome sequencing. We believe that, ideally, any
two individuals, in possession of their genomes should be able to
conduct a privacy-preserving paternity test with no involvement of
any third parties. Only the outcome of the test ought to be learned
by one or both parties and no other sensitive genomic information
should be disclosed.
Personalized Medicine is recognized as a signiﬁcant paradigm
shift and a major trend in health care, moving us closer to a more
precise, powerful, and holistic type of medicine [77]. With per-
sonalize medicine, treatment and medication type/dosage would be
tailored to the precise genetic makeup of individual patient. For ex-
ample, measurements of erbB2 protein in breast, lung, or colorectal
cancer patients are taken before selecting proper treatment. It has
been showed that the trastuzumab monoclonal antibody is effec-
tive only in patients whose genetic receptor is over-expressed [63].
Furthermore, the FDA has recently recommended testing for the
thiopurine S-methyltransferase (tpmt) gene, prior to prescribing for
6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine — two drugs used for treat-
ing childhood leukemia and autoimmune diseases. The tpmt gene
codes for the TPMT enzyme that metabolizes thiopurine drugs:
genetic polymorphisms affecting enzymatic activity are correlated
with variations in sensitivity and toxicity response to such drugs.
Patients suffering from this genetic disease (1 in 300) only need
6-10% of the standard dose of thiopurine drugs; if treated with the
full dose, they risk severe bone marrow suppression and subsequent
death [1]. Not surprisingly, experts predict that availability of full
genome sequencing will further stimulate development of person-
alized medicine [29].
Genetic Tests are routinely used for several purposes, such as new-
born screening, conﬁrmational diagnostics, as well as pre-sympto-
matic testing, e.g., predicting Huntington’s disease [34] and esti-
mating risks of various types of cancer. We focus on genetic com-
patibility tests, whereby potential or existing partners wish to as-
sess the possibility of transmitting to their children a genetic dis-
ease with Mendelian inheritance [56]. Modern genetic testing can
accurately predict whether a couple is at risk of conceiving a child
with an autosomal recessive disease. Consider, for instance, Beta-
Thalassemia minor, that causes red cells to be smaller than average,
due to a mutation in the hbb gene. It is called minor when the mu-
tation occurs only in one allele. This minor form has no severe
impact on a subject’s quality of life. However, the major variant —
that occurs when both alleles carry the mutation — is likely to result
in premature death, usually, before age twenty. Therefore, if both
partners silently carry the minor form, there is a 25% chance that
their child could carry the major variety. Another example is the
Lynch Syndrome (also known as Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colon
Cancer), a genetic condition — most commonly inherited from a
parent — associated with the high risk of colon cancer [45]. Par-
ents with this syndrome have a 50% chance of passing it on to their
children. Since the possibility of inheritance is maximized if both
parents carry the mutations, testing for Lynch Syndrome is crucial.
Note on Non-human Genomes: Although this paper focuses on
human genomes, some aforementioned scenarios apply to other or-
ganisms, e.g., crops and animals [3]. For instance, a paternity test
may certify a purebred dog’s bloodline or genetic tests may de-
termine the quality of a racing horse.
In fact, DNA “barcodes”
identiﬁers are already embedded in genomes of genetically mod-
iﬁed species. Conceivably, future veterinary treatments may also
involve elements of personalized medicine for animals.
1.2 Roadmap
Motivated by the emerging affordability of full genome sequenc-
ing, we combine domain knowledge in biology, genomics, bioin-
formatics, security, privacy and applied cryptography in order to
better understand the corresponding security and privacy challenges.
In particular, we analyze speciﬁc requirements of three types of ap-
plications discussed above: Paternity Tests, Personalized Medicine
and Genetic Tests. In the process, we carefully consider today’s
in vitro procedure for each application and analyze its security and
privacy requirements in the digital domain. This type of approach
allows us to gradually craft specialized protocols that incur appre-
ciably lower overhead than state-of-the-art. However, as is well
known, “lower overhead” does not necessarily imply practicality.
Therefore, we demonstrate — via experiments on commodity hard-
ware — that proposed protocols are indeed viable and practical to-
day. Source code of our implementations is publicly available. We
hope that it can help in developing privacy-aware operations on full
genomes and allows individuals (in possession of their sequenced
genomes) to run genetic tests with privacy.
Organization. We overview related work in the next section. Then,
Sec. 3 introduces biological and cryptographic background used
throughout the rest of the paper. The core of the paper is in Sec. 4
692that includes step-by-step design of protocols for each aforemen-
tioned application.
It also presents experimental results. Next,
Sec. 5 provides security arguments for proposed protocols, fol-
lowed by the summary and the discussion of future work in Sec. 6.
2. RELATED WORK
Motivated by the sensitivity of genomic information, the security
research community has begun to develop mechanisms to enable
secure computation on genomic data. A number of cryptographic
protocols have been proposed for private searching, matching and
evaluating similarity of strings, including DNA sequences. Also,
prior work has considered speciﬁc (privacy-preserving) genomic
operations. This section overviews relevant prior results and high-
lights their potential limitation.
Searching and Matching DNA
Troncoso-Pastoriza, et al. [71] proposed a privacy-preserving and
error-resilient protocol for string searching. In it, one party (e.g.,
Alice), with her own DNA snippet, can verify the existence of a
short template (e.g., a genetic test held by a service provider –
Bob) within her snippet. This technique handles errors and main-
tains privacy of both the template and the snippet. Each query
is represented as an automaton executed using a ﬁnite state ma-
chine (FSM) in an oblivious manner. Communication complexity
is O(n · (|Σ| + |Q|)), where n is snippet length, |Σ| – alphabet
size (i.e., 4 for DNA), and |Q| – number of states. Computational
complexity is O(n · |Σ| · |Q|) and O(n · |Q|) cryptographic opera-
tions for Alice and Bob, respectively. However, the number of FSM
states is always revealed to all parties. To obtain error-resilient and
approximate DNA matching, [71] also shows how to construct an
automaton that, given Alice’s string x, accepts all strings with Lev-
enshtein distance [51] at most d from x.
Blanton and Aliasgari [4] improve on [71], reducing Alice’s work
by a factor of |Σ| and Bob’s — by a factor of log(|Q|), incurring,
however, a potentially increased communication complexity (if the
security parameter is smaller than log(|Q|)). This work also in-
troduces a protocol for secure outsourcing of computation to an
external service provider and a modiﬁed multi-party protocol.
A set of cryptographic protocols for secure pattern matching are
presented in [27] and [36]. Given a binary string T of length n,
held by Alice, and a binary pattern p of length m, held by Bob,
pattern matching lets Bob learn all locations in T where p appears.
Secure computation guarantees that nothing except m is learned
by Alice, and nothing about T is revealed to Bob (besides n and
locations where p appears). [27] proposes one such protocol, se-
cure in the semi-honest setting, based on homomorphic encryption,
with O(m + n) communication and computation complexities. It
includes another protocol, secure in the malicious setting, based on
secure oblivious automata evaluation, with quadratic complexity
and m rounds. Subsequently, [36] presented an improved protocol,
with malicious security, using homomorphic encryption and incur-
ring O(m + n) complexity.
Another related result is the recent work in [47].
It realizes
secure computation of the CODIS test [69] (run by the FBI for
DNA identity testing), that could not be implemented using pat-
tern matching or FSM. It achieves efﬁcient secure computation of
function M (T, p, e, l) = 1 iff |lmax(T, p) − l| ≤ ε, where T is a
DNA fragment, p a pattern, (ε, l) some additional information, and
lmax(T, p) ≥ 0 is the largest integer l′ for which pl′
appears as a
substring in T . A general technique for secure text processing is in-
troduced, combining garbled circuits and secure pattern matching.
(The latter is reduced to private keyword search and solved using
Oblivious Pseudorandom Functions (OPRF-s) [24, 35].) The re-
sulting protocol can compute several functions (including CODIS)
on sample T and pattern p, using the number of circuits linear in
the number of occurrences of p. Complexity incurred by the under-
lying keyword search protocol is linear in |T|. However, common
knowledge of some threshold on the number of occurrences needs
to be assumed.
Similarity of DNA Sequences
Another set of cryptographic results focus on privately comput-
ing the edit distance of two strings α, β of size m and n, respec-
tively.1 Privacy-preserving computation of Smith-Waterman scores
[67] has also been investigated and used for sequence alignment.
Jha, et al. [42] proposed techniques for secure edit distance using
