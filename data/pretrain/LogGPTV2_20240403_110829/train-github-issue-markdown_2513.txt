I am not sure if this is the requested behavior, but this behavior does not
seem logical to me.
**Current behavior**  
When using Reactive Forms, a formGroup containing FormControls which are
invalid is shown as invalid which is normal, but it does not contain any
errors.
**Expected behavior**  
We should be able to get all the errors from FormControls | FormGroups |
FormArrays inside their containing FormGroup.

**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**  
I have a form with required inputs. I fill in some input but not all of them.  
So some input are in the pristine and also invalid. (like in the example of
the tutorial for template driven forms):

I decide to click on the submit button, but I have errors, so I want to show
all the inputs with errors that the user has missed.
