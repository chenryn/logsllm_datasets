**ATT&CK ID:** T1055.001  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Dynamic-link Library Injection

Adversaries may inject dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) into processes to evade process-based defenses and potentially elevate privileges. DLL injection is a technique that allows the execution of arbitrary code within the address space of a separate, active process. This method can be used to bypass security mechanisms and gain unauthorized access or control over a target system.
