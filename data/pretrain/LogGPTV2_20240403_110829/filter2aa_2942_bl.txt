#### Frame Step in the FARM Process
The Frame step is used to define conditions. Enterprises may find that Frame activities are performed less frequently than the latter steps of the FARM process. These activities can be re-performed at defined intervals (e.g., annually, bi-annually) or based on specific triggers (e.g., business changes, new or updated insights).

##### Activities: RISK ASSUMPTIONS
**TASK 1-1: Identify assumptions that affect how risk is assessed, responded to, and monitored within the enterprise.**

**Supplemental Guidance:**
As part of identifying risk assumptions within the broader Risk Management process (described in [NIST SP 800-39]), agencies should:
- Develop an enterprise-wide C-SCRM policy.
- Identify critical mission and business processes and related components.
- Define mission and business processes and information systems that compose the supply chain, including relevant contracted services and commercial products.
- Prioritize the application of risk treatment for these critical elements, considering factors such as national and homeland security concerns, FIPS 199 impact levels, scope of use, or interconnections/interdependencies to other critical processes and assets.
- Identify, characterize, and provide representative examples of threat sources, vulnerabilities, consequences/impacts, and likelihood determinations related to the supply chain.
- Define C-SCRM mission, business, and operational-level requirements.
- Select appropriate assessment methodologies based on enterprise governance, culture, and diversity of mission and business processes.
- Establish a method for integrating C-SCRM activity results into the overall agency Risk Management Process.
- Periodically review the supply chain to ensure definitions remain current.

These C-SCRM assumptions should align with the broader risk assumptions defined in the enterprise risk management program. A key responsibility (e.g., of the C-SCRM PMO) is to identify which assumptions apply to the C-SCRM context at each successive risk management framework level. New risk assumptions should be provided as updates to corresponding Enterprise Risk Assumptions as part of an iterative process.

#### Criticality
**Critical processes** are those that, if disrupted, corrupted, or disabled, are likely to result in mission degradation or failure. Mission-critical processes depend on supporting systems and critical components (e.g., hardware, software, firmware). They also depend on information and processes (performed by technology or people, including support service contractors). Criticality analysis identifies and prioritizes mission-critical processes, associated systems/components, and enabling infrastructure and support services. It also involves analyzing critical suppliers, including fourth- and fifth-party suppliers.

Enterprises will make criticality determinations based on the process outlined in [NISTIR 8179]. C-SCRM should inherit and tailor these assumptions to include the C-SCRM context. For example:
- **Level 1:** Determine the criticality of holistic supplier relationships to the enterprise’s overall strategic objectives.
- **Level 2:** Assess the criticality of individual suppliers, products, and services to specific mission and business processes and strategic/operational objectives.
- **Level 3:** Assess the criticality of the supplied product or service to specific operational state objectives of the information systems.

Enterprises should identify key supplier-provided products or services that contribute to the operation and resiliency of enterprise processes and systems. The criticality determination may be based on the role of each supplier, product, or service in achieving the required strategic or operational objective. The analysis combines top-down and bottom-up approaches.

#### Threat Sources
For C-SCRM, threat sources include:
- Adversarial threats (e.g., cyber/physical attacks)
- Accidental human errors
- Structural failures (e.g., equipment, environmental controls, resource depletion)
- Environmental threats (e.g., geopolitical disruptions, pandemics, economic upheavals, natural or human-made disasters)

[NIST SP 800-39] states that enterprises should provide a succinct characterization of the types of tactics, techniques, and procedures employed by adversaries, making explicit the types of threat sources to be addressed and those not addressed by safeguards and countermeasures.

Threat information can come from multiple sources, including the U.S. Intelligence Community, DHS, CISA, the FBI, ISACs, and open-source reporting. Departments and agencies must have the capabilities to process classified intelligence. Threat information obtained during the Frame step should document the enterprise’s long-term assumptions about threat conditions. During the Assess step, updated threat information is infused into the risk assessment to account for short-term variations in threat conditions.

#### Table G-1: Examples of Supply Chain Cybersecurity Threat Sources and Agents

| Threat Sources | Threat Examples |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Adversarial: Counterfeiters | Counterfeits inserted into the supply chain (see Appendix B, Scenario 1) |
| Adversarial: Malicious Insiders | Intellectual property loss (disgruntled insiders sell or transfer IP) |
| Adversarial: Foreign Intelligence Services | Malicious code insertion (implant unwanted functionality) (see Appendix B, Scenario 4) |
| Adversarial: Terrorists | Unauthorized access (penetrate or disrupt the supply chain) |
| Adversarial: Industrial Espionage/Cyber Criminals | Industrial espionage or intellectual property loss (see Appendix B, Scenario 2) |
| Adversarial: Organized Cyber Criminals | Ransomware leads to the disruption of a critical production process |
| Systemic: Legal/Regulatory | Legal or regulatory complications impact the availability of key supplier-provided products and/or services (weak anti-corruption laws, lack of regulatory oversight, etc.) |
| Systemic: Economic Risks | Business failure of a key supplier leads to supply chain disruption |

This table provides a comprehensive list of potential threats and their examples, helping organizations to better understand and mitigate risks in their supply chain.
