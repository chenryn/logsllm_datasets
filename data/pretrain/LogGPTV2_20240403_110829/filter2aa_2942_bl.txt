As the Frame step is used to define conditions, enterprises may find that Frame activities are 
performed relatively less often than the latter steps of the FARM process. Enterprises may re-
perform Frame activities at defined intervals (e.g., annually, bi-annually) or based on defined 
triggers (e.g., business changes and/or new or updated insights from other levels).  
Activities 
RISK ASSUMPTIONS 
TASK 1-1: Identify assumptions that affect how risk is assessed, responded to, and monitored 
within the enterprise.  
Supplemental Guidance  
As a part of identifying risk assumptions within the broader Risk Management process 
(described in [NIST SP 800-39]), agencies should do the following: 
• Develop an enterprise-wide C-SCRM policy.  
• Identify which mission and business processes and related components are critical to the 
enterprise to determine the criticality.  
• Define which mission and business processes and information systems compose the 
supply chain, including relevant contracted services and commercial products.  
• Prioritize the application of risk treatment for these critical elements, considering factors 
such as but not limited to national and homeland security concerns, FIPS 199 impact 
levels, scope of use, or interconnections/interdependencies to other critical processes and 
assets.  
• Identify, characterize, and provide representative examples of threat sources, 
vulnerabilities, consequences/impacts, and likelihood determinations related to the supply 
chain.  
• Define C-SCRM mission, business, and operational-level requirements.  
• Select appropriate assessment methodologies, depending on enterprise governance, 
culture, and diversity of the mission and business processes.  
• Establish a method for the results of C-SCRM activities to be integrated into the overall 
agency Risk Management Process.  
• Periodically review the supply chain to ensure that definitions remain current as 
evolutions occur over time. 
These C-SCRM assumptions should be aligned as applicable to the broader risk assumptions 
defined as part of the enterprise risk management program. A key C-SCRM responsibility (e.g., 
of the C-SCRM PMO) is identifying which of those assumptions apply to the C-SCRM context 
at each successive risk management framework level. If and when new risk assumptions (i.e., 
Task 1-1) are identified, these should be provided as updates to any corresponding Enterprise 
Risk Assumptions (i.e., Enterprise Risk Management version of Task 1-1) as part of an iterative 
process.

Criticality 
Critical processes are those that – if disrupted, corrupted, or disabled – are likely to result in 
mission degradation or failure. Mission-critical processes are dependent on their supporting 
systems that, in turn, depend on critical components in those systems (e.g., hardware, software, 
and firmware). Mission-critical processes also depend on information and processes (performed 
by technology or people, to include support service contractors in some instances) that are used 
to execute the critical processes. Those components and processes that underpin and enable 
mission-critical processes or deliver defensive – and commonly shared – processes (e.g., access 
control, identity management, and crypto) and unmediated access (e.g., power supply) should 
also be considered critical. A criticality analysis is the primary method by which mission-critical 
processes, associated systems/components, and enabling infrastructure and support services are 
identified and prioritized. The criticality analysis also involves analyzing critical suppliers that 
may not be captured by internal criticality analysis (e.g., supply chain interdependencies 
including fourth- and fifth-party suppliers).  
Enterprises will make criticality determinations as part of enterprise risk management activities 
based on the process outlined in [NISTIR 8179].57 Where possible, C-SCRM should inherit 
those assumptions and tailor/refine them to include the C-SCRM context. In C-SCRM, criticality 
tailoring includes the initial criticality analysis of particular projects, products, and processes in 
the supply chain in relation to critical processes at each Level. For example, at Level 1, the 
enterprise may determine the criticality of holistic supplier relationships to the enterprise’s 
overall strategic objectives. Then, at Level 2, the enterprise may assess the criticality of 
individual suppliers, products, and services to specific mission and business processes and 
strategic/operational objectives. Finally, at Level 3, the enterprise may assess the criticality of the 
supplied product or service to specific operational state objectives of the information systems.  
Enterprises may begin by identifying key supplier-provided products or services that contribute 
to the operation and resiliency of enterprise processes and systems. Some of these elements may 
be captured or defined as part of disaster recovery continuity of operations plans. The criticality 
determination may be based on the role of each supplier, product, or service in achieving the 
required strategic or operational objective of the process or system. Requirements, architecture, 
and design inform the analysis and help identify the minimum set of supplier-provided products 
and/or services required for operations (i.e., at enterprise, mission and business process, and 
operational levels). The analysis combines top-down and bottom-up analysis approaches. The 
top-down approach in this model enables the enterprise to identify critical processes and then 
progressively narrow the analysis to critical systems that support those processes and critical 
components that support the critical functions of those systems. The bottom-up approach 
progressively traces the impact that a malfunctioning, compromised, or unavailable critical 
component would have on the system and, in turn, on the related mission and business process.  
Enterprises that perform this analysis should include agency system and cybersecurity supply 
chain dependencies, to include critical fourth-party suppliers. For example, an enterprise may

find exposures to cybersecurity risks that result from third-party suppliers receiving critical input 
or services from a common fourth-party supplier.  
Determining criticality is an iterative process performed at all levels during both Frame and 
Assess. In Frame, criticality determination is expected to be performed at a high level using the 
available information with further detail incorporated through additional iterations or at the 
Assess step. Determining criticality may include the following: 
• Define criticality analysis procedures to ensure that there is a set of documented 
procedures to guide the enterprise’s criticality analysis across levels.  
• Conduct enterprise and mission-level criticality analysis to identify and prioritize 
enterprise and mission objectives, goals, and requirements.  
• Conduct operational-level criticality analysis (i.e., systems and sub-systems) to identify 
and prioritize critical workflow paths, system functionalities, and capabilities.  
• Conduct system and subsystem component-level criticality analysis to identify and 
prioritize key system and subsystem inputs (e.g., COTS products).  
• Conduct a detailed review (e.g., bottom-up analysis) of impacts and interactions between 
enterprise, mission, system/sub-systems, and components/sub-components to ensure 
cross-process interaction and collaboration. 
Given the potential impact that a supply chain incident may have on an organization’s 
operations, assets, and – in some instances – business partners or customers, it is important for 
organizations to ensure that in addition to criticality, materiality considerations are built into their 
supply chain risk management strategy, risk assessment practices, and overall governance of 
supply chain risks. In contrast to criticality, materiality considers whether the information would 
have been viewed by a reasonable investor making an investment decision as significantly 
altering the total mix of information available to the shareholder.58 SEC guidance states:  
…the materiality of cybersecurity risks and incidents also depends on the range of 
harm that such incidents could cause. This includes harm to a company’s 
reputation, financial performance, and customer and vendor relationships, as well 
as the possibility of litigation or regulatory investigations or actions, including 
regulatory actions by state and federal governmental authorities and non-U.S. 
authorities. 
Criticality can be determined for existing systems or for future system investments, development, 
or integration efforts based on system architecture and design. It is an iterative activity that 
should be performed when a change warranting iteration is identified in the Monitor step. 
Threat Sources  
For C-SCRM, threat sources include 1) adversarial threats, such as cyber/physical attacks to the 
supply chain or to an information system component(s) traversing the supply chain; 2) accidental 
human errors; 3) structural failures, including the failure of equipment, environmental controls, 
and resource depletion; and 4) environmental threats, such as geopolitical disruptions,

pandemics, economic upheavals, and natural or human-made disasters. With regard to 
adversarial threats, [NIST SP 800-39] states that enterprises should provide a succinct 
characterization of the types of tactics, techniques, and procedures employed by adversaries that 
are to be addressed by safeguards and countermeasures (i.e., security controls) deployed at Level 
1 (enterprise level), at Level 2 (mission and business process level), and at Level 3 (information 
system/services level), making explicit the types of threat sources to be addressed and the threat 
sources that are not addressed by the safeguards and countermeasures. 
Threat information can include but is not limited to historical threat data, factual threat data, or 
business entity (e.g., suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, 
and other ICT/OT-related service providers) or technology-specific threat data. Threat 
information may come from multiple information sources, including the U.S. Intelligence 
Community (for federal agencies), DHS, CISA, the FBI, Information Sharing and Analysis 
Centers (ISAC), and open source reporting, such as news and trade publications, partners, 
suppliers, and customers. When applicable, enterprises may rely on the Federal Acquisition 
Security Council’s (FASC) Information Sharing Agency (ISA) for supply chain threat 
information in addition to the aforementioned sources. As threat information may include 
classified intelligence, it is crucial that departments and agencies have the capabilities required to 
process classified intelligence. Threat information obtained as part of the Frame step should be 
used to document the enterprise’s long-term assumptions about threat conditions based on its 
unique internal and external characteristics. During the Assess step, updated threat information is 
infused into the risk assessment to account for short-term variations in threat conditions (e.g., 
due to geopolitical circumstances) that would impact decisions made concerning the 
procurement of a product or service. 
Information about the supply chain (such as supply chain maps) provides the context for 
identifying possible locations or access points for threat sources and agents to affect the supply 
chain. Supply chain cybersecurity threats are similar to information security threats, such as 
disasters, attackers, or industrial spies. Table G-1 lists examples of supply chain cybersecurity 
threat agents. Appendix G provides Risk Response Plans with examples of the Supply Chain 
Threat Sources and Agents listed in Table G-1.
