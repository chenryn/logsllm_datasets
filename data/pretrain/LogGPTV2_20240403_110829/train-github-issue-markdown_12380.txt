. Previous version 0.18.2 allowed the shift key to disable zones when in this
mode
# Expected behavior
Drag a window and it will show the zone guides. Depress the shift key and the
zone guides should stop, and the window won't re-size to a zone.
# Actual behavior
Drag a window - the zones will activate even when the shift key is held down.
The window must now be placed in a zone
