2, there is an A(cid:48)
The remaining two implications, from uniform security to receiver chosen message security and
from sender chosen message security to endemic security follow in a similar fashion. Again it is
easier to construct a malicious receiver interacting with the ideal OT when he can choose the OT
strings rather than receiving them from the ideal OT.
Claim 3.3. Let Π be an OT secure against a malicious receiver with respect to an ideal OT F∗
that sends the learned OT strings (si)i∈S to the receiver, i.e. functionality F U
OT
OT, and the
distribution of (si)i∈S is eﬃciently sampleable. Then Π is also secure against a malicious sender
with respect to ideal OT FOT, which receives the OT strings (si)i∈S from the receiver, i.e. F R
OT and
F E
OT.
Proof. The proof is basically identical to the proof of Claim A.11. Again, the set of all ppt A(cid:48)

Even though endemic security is implied by all the other security notions and could be seen as the
weakest, it is still suﬃcient to obtain any of the other notions by using very simple transformations.
In the following lemmas we show these transformations and sketch their security.
