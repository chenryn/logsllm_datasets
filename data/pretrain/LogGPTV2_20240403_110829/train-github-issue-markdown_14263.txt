# Description of the new feature/enhancement
It would be nice to have some sort of organization feature, such as a
"folder", for the profiles drop down from the title bar.
Having this feature would allow the user to organize their profiles into
meaningful categories. Such as "Dev", "QA", "Prod" to designate connections to
different environments. This would eliminate having overly long lists of
profiles to scroll through on the drop down.
# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)
The ability to organize the profiles on the title bar drop down menu. I really
don't care how it is implemented.
