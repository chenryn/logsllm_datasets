User: My server has been attacked by DDoS, how to protect the server from being attacked?
Assistant: 1. Install a firewall: configure the server firewall to restrict traffic access to the server. 2. Use CDN: CDN can share part of the traffic for the server to prevent the server from hanging up due to too many requests. 3. Configure the reverse proxy: the reverse proxy can hide the real IP address of the server to prevent attackers from directly attacking the server. 4. Limit connections: Limit the number or rate of access to the server to prevent attackers from making a large number of connection requests. 5. Update system patches: timely upgrade the latest version of the operating system and software to prevent known vulnerabilities from being exploited. 6. Choose a reliable server provider: Choose a server provider that provides DDoS protection, which can respond quickly and provide better protection when attacked. 7. If the server has been attacked by DDoS, you can use protection services: such as Cloudflare, Alibaba Cloud and other services can provide DDoS attack protection, effectively slow down the attack pressure, and prevent the server from stopping responding.
