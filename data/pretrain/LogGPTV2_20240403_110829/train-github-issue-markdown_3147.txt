### What problem does this feature solve?
A vue component of mine, when applied a certain model generates certain
HTML/CSS. Is there any CLI for extracting the output HTML/CSS into seperate
entities? Currently I duplicate the Vue file with my own node templating
generation.
### What does the proposed API look like?
Some CLI that lets you pass in a model and a Vue component, which outputs the
html/css file appropriate to the input model.
