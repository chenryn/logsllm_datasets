### C-SCRM PMO Roles and Responsibilities

The Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM) Program Management Office (PMO) can be positioned at either Level 1 or Level 2 within an organization. It is essential that the C-SCRM PMO includes cross-disciplinary representation to effectively manage cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain.

#### Level 1 Responsibilities
At Level 1, the C-SCRM PMO's responsibilities include:
- Providing services to enterprise leaders to set the tone for C-SCRM application.
- Offering Subject Matter Expert (SME) support to guide stakeholders through the risk framing process, which involves establishing the enterprise’s appetite and tolerance for cybersecurity risks.
- Drafting the enterprise’s C-SCRM strategy and policy, as delegated by accountable risk executives.
- Coordinating internal and external C-SCRM information-sharing.
- Conducting executive-level briefings to help stakeholders develop an aggregated view of cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain.

#### Level 2 Responsibilities
At Level 2, the C-SCRM PMO may:
- Develop C-SCRM starter kits, including a base strategy and customizable policies, procedures, and guidelines.
- Provide SME consulting support to mission and business processes for creating process-specific C-SCRM strategies and implementation plans.
- Advise on or develop C-SCRM common control baselines within the enterprise’s mission and business processes.
- Perform C-SCRM risk assessments focused on suppliers, developers, system integrators, and other ICT/OT-related service providers.

#### Influence on Level 3
The C-SCRM PMO at both levels influences C-SCRM activities at the operational level (Level 3). The PMO may:
- Advise teams throughout the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) on C-SCRM control selection, tailoring, and monitoring.
- Be responsible for producing C-SCRM outputs across all risk management levels.

#### Benefits of Centralization
Centralizing C-SCRM services offers several advantages:
- Utilizes specialized skill sets within a consolidated team.
- Provides high-quality C-SCRM services to the rest of the enterprise.
- Achieves standardization not possible in decentralized models.
- Realizes cost efficiencies by dedicating resources to C-SCRM activities.

#### Applicability
A C-SCRM PMO model is typically more suitable for larger, more complex enterprises that require standardized C-SCRM practices across diverse mission and business processes. Enterprises should select a C-SCRM operating model that aligns with their available resources and context.

### Key Takeaways

1. **Business Case for C-SCRM:**
   - C-SCRM provides benefits such as understanding critical systems, reducing the likelihood of supply chain compromise, enhancing operational and enterprise efficiencies, and improving product quality and security.

2. **Cybersecurity Risk in Supply Chains:**
   - Risks arise from relationships with suppliers, their supply chains, and their products or services when a human or non-human threat exploits a vulnerability.

3. **Multilevel, Multidisciplinary C-SCRM:**
   - As described in [NIST SP 800-39], multilevel risk management involves continuous improvement of C-SCRM activities at the enterprise, mission and business process, and operational levels, with stakeholders from multiple disciplines.

4. **C-SCRM PMO:**
   - A dedicated C-SCRM PMO supports the enterprise by providing support products and services, such as policy templates and vendor risk assessments, and can operate at Level 1 or Level 2.

5. **C-SCRM as a Life Cycle Process:**
   - C-SCRM activities should be integrated and executed throughout the enterprise life cycle processes, including the SDLC, to continuously assess, respond to, and monitor cybersecurity supply chain risks.

### Critical Success Factors

To address evolving cybersecurity risks in the supply chain, enterprises need to:
- Engage multiple internal processes and capabilities.
- Communicate and collaborate across enterprise levels and mission areas.
- Ensure all individuals understand their role in managing cybersecurity risks.
- Develop strategies for communicating, implementing, and monitoring the effectiveness of C-SCRM controls and practices.
- Exchange C-SCRM insights with peers to continuously evaluate and improve their C-SCRM program.

### C-SCRM in Acquisition

Integrating C-SCRM considerations into every step of the procurement and contract management life cycle is crucial. This includes:
- Identifying needs and planning requirements.
- Conducting research to identify and assess viable sources of supply.
- Soliciting bids and evaluating offers.
- Assessing C-SCRM risks associated with bidders and their products/services.
- Monitoring for changes that may affect cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain.

#### Acquisition in the C-SCRM Strategy and Implementation Plan

The C-SCRM Strategy and Implementation Plan should guide the enterprise towards long-term, sustainable reductions in exposure to cybersecurity risks. Key acquisition activities include:
- Promoting awareness and communicating C-SCRM expectations.
- Establishing a checklist of acquisition security requirements.
- Leveraging shared services for supplier, product, and service assessments.
- Conducting due diligence to inform bidder responsibility and risk posture.
- Including C-SCRM criteria in source selection evaluations.
- Establishing and referencing lists of prohibited and approved suppliers.
- Ensuring products are supplied with a software bill of materials.

#### The Role of C-SCRM in the Acquisition Process

During procurement, enterprises should:
- Designate experts from different subject matter areas to participate in the acquisition process.
- Consider contextual factors such as mission criticality, data sensitivity, and the operational environment.
- Select relevant C-SCRM controls and incorporate them into requirements documents and contracts.
- Avoid using a "lowest price, technically acceptable" (LPTA) source selection process for ICT/OT-related products or services.

#### Procurement Process Steps

- **Plan Procurement:** Identify the need and criticality of the good or service, and develop specific requirements.
- **Define or Develop Requirements:** Address cybersecurity risks and specify performance, schedule, and cost objectives.
- **Perform Market Analysis:** Conduct due diligence on potential suppliers and products.
- **Solicit Bids/Complete Procurement:** Evaluate bidders against C-SCRM criteria and complete risk assessments.
- **Operate and Maintain:** Monitor for changes that alter exposure to cybersecurity risks and apply lessons learned to enhance C-SCRM.

### Summary Table: C-SCRM in the Procurement Process

| Procurement Process | Service Risk Assessment | Supplier Risk Assessment | Product Risk Assessment |
|---------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| Plan Procurement    | Criticality of Needed Service | Fit for Purpose | Criticality of Needed Product |
| Define or Develop Requirements | Identify relevant C-SCRM controls | Identify relevant C-SCRM controls | Identify relevant C-SCRM controls |
| Perform Market Analysis | Initial Risk Assessment | Initial Risk Assessment | Research product options and risk factors |
| Solicit Bids/Complete Procurement | Confirm C-SCRM Requirements Met | Complete Risk Assessment | Confirm C-SCRM Requirements Met |
| Operate and Maintain | Continuous Risk Monitoring | Continuous Risk Monitoring | Continuous Risk Monitoring |

This structured approach ensures that C-SCRM is integrated and executed throughout the procurement and contract management life cycle, thereby mitigating cybersecurity risks in the supply chain.
