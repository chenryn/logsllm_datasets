SCRM PMO sits at Level 1 or Level 2, it is critical that the C-SCRM PMO include cross-
disciplinary representation.  
The C-SCRM PMO responsibilities may include providing services to the enterprise’s leaders 
that help set the tone for how C-SCRM is applied throughout the enterprise. The C-SCRM PMO 
may provide SME support to guide Level 1 stakeholders through the risk framing process, which 
includes establishing the enterprise appetite and tolerance for cybersecurity risks throughout the 
supply chain. In addition, accountable risk executives may delegate the responsibility of drafting 
the enterprise’s C-SCRM strategy and policy to the PMO. C-SCRM PMOs may also coordinate 
C-SCRM information-sharing internally or with external entities. Finally, the PMO may conduct 
C-SCRM-focused executive-level briefings (e.g., to the risk executive function, board of

directors) to help Level 1 stakeholders develop an aggregated view of cybersecurity risks 
throughout the supply chain.   
At Level 2, the C-SCRM PMO may develop C-SCRM starter kits that contain a base strategy 
and a set of policies, procedures, and guidelines that can be further customized within specific 
mission and business processes. This PMO may also provide SME consulting support to 
stakeholders within mission and business processes as they create process-specific C-SCRM 
strategies and develop C-SCRM implementation plans. As part of this responsibility, the C-
SCRM PMO may advise on or develop C-SCRM common control baselines within the enterprise 
mission and business processes. The C-SCRM PMO may also perform C-SCRM risk 
assessments focused on suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service 
providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers of both technology- and non-technology-
related products and services.   
The responsibility of a C-SCRM PMO at Level 1 and Level 2 would ultimately influence C-
SCRM activities at the Level 3 operational level. A C-SCRM PMO may advise teams throughout 
the SDLC on C-SCRM control selection, tailoring, and monitoring. Ultimately a C-SCRM PMO 
may be responsible for activities that produce C-SCRM outputs across the risk management 
levels. Centralizing C-SCRM services offers enterprises an opportunity to capitalize on 
specialized skill sets within a consolidated team that offers high-quality C-SCRM services to the 
rest of the enterprise. By centralizing risk assessment services, enterprises may achieve a level of 
standardization not otherwise possible (e.g., in a decentralized model). Enterprises may also 
realize cost efficiencies in cases where PMO resources are dedicated to C-SCRM activities 
versus resources in decentralized models that may perform multiple roles in addition to C-SCRM 
responsibilities.  
A C-SCRM PMO model will typically favor larger, more complex enterprises that require the 
standardization of C-SCRM practices across a disparate set of mission and business processes. 
Ultimately, enterprises should select a C-SCRM operating model that is applicable and 
appropriate relative to their available resources and context.

Key Takeaways24 
Business Case for C-SCRM. C-SCRM provides enterprises with a number of benefits, such as 
an understanding of critical systems, the reduced likelihood of supply chain compromise, 
operational and enterprise efficiencies, fewer product quality and security issues, and more 
reliable and trustworthy supplied services.  
Cybersecurity Risk in Supply Chains. The potential for harm or compromise arising from a 
relationship with suppliers, their supply chains, and their supplied products or services 
materialize when a human or non-human threat successfully exploits a vulnerability tied to a 
system, product, service, or the supply chain ecosystem.   
Multilevel, Multidisciplinary C-SCRM. As described in [NIST SP 800-39], multilevel risk 
management is the purposeful execution and continuous improvement of cybersecurity supply 
chain risk management activities at the enterprise (e.g., CEO, COO), mission and business 
process (e.g., business management, R&D), and operational (e.g., systems management) levels. 
Each level contains stakeholders from multiple disciplines (e.g., information security, 
procurement, enterprise risk management, engineering, software development, IT, legal, HR, 
etc.) that collectively execute and continuously improve C-SCRM   
C-SCRM PMO. A dedicated office known as a C-SCRM PMO may support the enterprise’s C-
SCRM activities by providing support products (e.g., policy templates) and services (e.g., vendor 
risk assessments) to the rest of the enterprise. A C-SCRM PMO may provide support across the 
three levels and sit at Level 1 or Level 2, depending on the enterprise. 
C-SCRM is a Life Cycle Process. C-SCRM activities should be integrated and executed 
throughout the applicable enterprise life cycle processes (e.g., SDLC). For example in systems, 
cybersecurity supply chain risks can and do materialize during operations and maintenance 
phases. Organizations should ensure that appropriate C-SCRM activities are in place to assess, 
respond to, and monitor cybersecurity supply chain risks on a continuous basis.

 CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS 
To successfully address evolving cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain, enterprises 
need to engage multiple internal processes and capabilities, communicate and collaborate across 
enterprise levels and mission areas, and ensure that all individuals within the enterprise 
understand their role in managing cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain. Enterprises 
need strategies for communicating, determining how best to implement, and monitoring the 
effectiveness of their supply chain cybersecurity controls and practices. In addition to internally 
communicating cybersecurity supply chain risk management controls, enterprises should engage 
with peers to exchange C-SCRM insights. These insights will aid enterprises in continuously 
evaluating how well they are doing and identify where they need to improve and how to take 
steps to mature their C-SCRM program. This section addresses the requisite enterprise processes 
and capabilities in making C-SCRM successful. While this publication has chosen to highlight 
these critical success factors, this represents a non-exhaustive set of factors that contribute to an 
enterprise’s successful execution of C-SCRM. Critical success factors are fluid and will evolve 
over time as the environment and the enterprise’s own capability advances.  
3.1. 
C-SCRM in Acquisition25 
Integrating C-SCRM considerations into acquisition activities within every step of the 
procurement and contract management life cycle process is essential to improving management 
of cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain. This life cycle begins with a purchaser 
identifying a need and includes the processes to plan for and articulate requirements, conduct 
research to identify and assess viable sources of supply, solicit bids, evaluate offers to ensure 
conformance with C-SCRM requirements, and assess C-SCRM risks associated with the bidder 
and the proposed product and/or service. After contract award, ensure that the supplier satisfies 
the terms and conditions articulated in the contractual agreement and that the products and 
services conform as expected and required. Monitoring for changes that may affect cybersecurity 
risks in the supply chain should occur throughout the life cycle and may trigger reevaluation of 
the original assessment or require a mitigation response. 
Enterprises rely heavily on commercial products and outsourced services to perform operations 
and fulfill their mission and business objectives. However, it is important to highlight that 
products and services can also be obtained outside of the procurement process, as is the case with 
open source software, relying on an in-house provider for shared services, or by repurposing an 
existing product to satisfy a new need. C-SCRM must also be addressed for these other 
“acquiring” processes.    
In addition to addressing cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain and performing C-
SCRM activities during each phase of the acquisition process, enterprises should develop and 
execute an acquisition strategy that drives reductions in their overall risk exposure. By applying 
such strategies, enterprises can reduce cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain, within 
specific procurement processes, and for the overall enterprise. Enterprises will aid, direct, and 
25 Departments and agencies should refer to Appendix F to implement this guidance in accordance with Executive Order 14028, Improving the 
Nation’s Cybersecurity.

inform efforts to realize targeted risk-reducing outcomes by adopting acquisition policies and 
processes that integrate C-SCRM into acquisition activities.  
Additionally, by adopting C-SCRM controls aligned to an industry-recognized set of standards 
and guidelines (e.g., NIST 800-53, Rev.5; NIST CSF), the enterprise can ensure holistic 
coverage of cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain and corresponding C-SCRM 
practices. C-SCRM controls may apply to different participants of the supply chain to include the 
enterprise itself, prime contractors, and subcontractors. Because enterprises heavily rely on prime 
contractors and their subcontractors to develop and implement ICT/OT products and services, 
those controls implemented within the SDLC are likely to flow down to subcontractors. 
Establishing C-SCRM controls applicable throughout the supply chain and the SDLC will aid the 
enterprise in establishing a common lexicon and set of expectations with suppliers and sub-
suppliers to aid all participants in managing cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain. 
3.1.1. Acquisition in the C-SCRM Strategy and Implementation Plan 
An enterprise’s C-SCRM Strategy and Implementation Plan guides the enterprise toward the 
achievement of long-term, sustainable reductions in exposure to cybersecurity risks throughout 
the supply chain. As a core part of the C-SCRM Strategy and Implementation Plan, enterprises 
should address how this risk is managed throughout the acquisition process.   
Cybersecurity risks in the supply chain include those arising from the supplier’s enterprise, 
products, services, and the supplier’s own suppliers and supply chains. The C-SCRM PMO may 
be helpful in developing specific strategies and implementation plans for integrating C-SCRM 
considerations into acquisitions. Acquisition activities relevant to C-SCRM include:   
• Promoting awareness and communicating C-SCRM expectations as part of supplier 
relationship management efforts 
• Establishing a checklist of acquisition security requirements that must be completed as 
part of procurement requests to ensure that necessary provision and protections are in 
place 
• Leveraging an external shared service provider or utilizing the C-SCRM PMO to provide 
supplier, product, and/or service assessment activities as a shared service to other internal 
processes, including acquisition 
• Conducting due diligence to inform determinations about a bidder’s responsibility and to 
identify and assess bidders’ risk posture or risk associated with a given product or service 
• Obtaining open source software from vetted and approved libraries 
• Including C-SCRM criteria in source selection evaluations 
• Establishing and referencing a list of prohibited suppliers, if appropriate, per applicable 
regulatory and legal references 
• Establishing and procuring from an approved products list or list of preferred or qualified 
suppliers who have demonstrated conformance with the enterprise’s security 
requirements through a rigorous process defined by the enterprise or another acceptable 
qualified list program activity [CISA SCRM WG3]

• Ensuring that products, including software or logic-bearing products (i.e., hardware), are 
supplied with a software bill of materials that complies with appropriate agency-approved 
protocols 
The C-SCRM Strategy and Implementation Plan should address the acquisition security-relevant 
foundational elements necessary to implement a C-SCRM program. To support the strategy, 
enterprise leaders should promote the value and importance of C-SCRM within acquisitions and 
ensure that sufficient, dedicated funding is in place for necessary activities. Doing so will help 
enterprises ensure responsibility for program or business processes and accountability for 
progress toward the attainment of results. Enterprises should build sufficient time into 
acquisition and project activities to ensure that C-SCRM activities can be completed. Enterprises 
should also assign roles and responsibilities, some of which will be cross-enterprise in nature and 
team-based, while others will be specific to acquisition processes. Finally, relevant training 
should be provided to members of the acquisition workforce to ensure that roles and 
responsibilities are understood and executed in alignment with leader expectations.  
The enterprise’s capabilities, resources, operational constraints, and existing portfolio of supplier 
relationships, contracts, acquired services, and products provide the baseline context necessary to 
lay out a strategic path that is both realistic and achievable. This baseline starting point also 
serves as a marker by which performance progress and outcomes can be tracked and assessed.    
A critical first step is to ensure that there is a current and accurate inventory of the enterprise’s 
supplier relationships, contracts, and any products or services those suppliers provide. This 
information allows for a mapping of these suppliers into strategically relevant groupings as 
determined by the organization. For example, an assessment of these suppliers might result in 
groupings of multiple categories (e.g., “strategic/innovative,” “mission-critical,” “sustaining,” or 
“standard/non-essential”). This segmentation facilitates further analysis and understanding of the 
exposure to cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain and helps to focus attention and 
assign priority to those critical suppliers of the most strategic or operational importance to the 
enterprise and its mission and business processes. It is useful to identify which products and 
services require a higher level of confidence in risk mitigation and areas of risk, such as 
overreliance on a single source of supply. This inventory and mapping also facilitates the 
selection and tailoring of C-SCRM contract language and evaluation criteria. 
Additional information can be found in Appendix A of this document, [NISTIR 8179], and SA-1, 
SA-2, SA-4, SR-5, SR-13 of NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5.  
3.1.2. The Role of C-SCRM in the Acquisition Process 
When conducting a procurement, enterprises should designate experts from different subject 
matter areas to participate in the acquisition process as members of the Acquisition Team and/or 
Integrated Project Team.26 This includes program officials, personnel with technical and security 
expertise, and representatives from supply and procurement communities. While procurement 
requirements address and are tailored to a specific purpose and ensuring that compliance 
mandates are met, contextual factors such as mission criticality, the sensitivity of data, and the 
26 An Integrated Project Team is equivalent to the acquisition team, as defined by the FAR 
NIST SP 800-161r1

PRACTICES FOR SYSTEMS AND ORGANIZATIONS

operational environment must also be considered to effectively address cybersecurity risk in 
supply chains.   
This contextual basis sets the stage for the Acquisition Team to effectively gauge their tolerance 
for risk as it pertains to a specific procurement requirement and determine which of the C-SCRM 
controls described in this document and [NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5] controls are relevant and 
necessary to consider for specific acquisitions. The program office or requiring official should 
consult with information security personnel to complete this control selection process and work 
with their procurement official to incorporate these controls into requirements documents and 
contracts. Security is a critical factor in procurement decisions. For this reason, when purchasing 
ICT/OT-related products or services, enterprises should avoid using a “lowest price, technically 
acceptable” (LPTA) source selection process.  
Acquisition policies and processes need to incorporate C-SCRM considerations into each step of 
the procurement and contract management life cycle management process (i.e., plan 
procurement, define and develop requirements, perform market analysis, complete procurement, 
ensure compliance, and monitor performance for changes that affect C-SCRM risk status) as 
described in [NISTIR 7622]. This includes ensuring that cybersecurity risks throughout the 
supply chain are addressed when making ICT/OT-related charge card purchases.   
During the ‘plan procurement’ step, the need for and the criticality of the good or service to be 
procured needs to be identified, along with a description of the factors driving the determination 
of the need and level of criticality as this informs how much risk may be tolerated, who should 
be involved in the planning, and the development of the specific requirements that will need to 
be satisfied. This activity is typically led by the acquirer mission and business process owner or a 
designee in collaboration with the procurement official or contracting officer representative 
During the planning phase, the enterprise should develop and define requirements to address 
cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain in addition to specifying performance, schedule, 
and cost objectives. This process is typically initiated by the acquirer mission and business 
process owner or a designee in collaboration with the procurement official and other members of 
the C-SCRM team.  
With requirements defined, enterprises will typically complete a market analysis for potential 
suppliers. Market research and analysis activities explore the availability of potential or pre-
qualified sources of supply. This step is typically initiated by the acquirer mission and business 
process owner or a designated representative. Enterprises should use this phase to conduct more 
robust due diligence research on potential suppliers and/or products in order to generate a 
supplier risk profile. As part of due diligence, the enterprise may consider the market 
concentration for the sought-after product or service as a means of identifying interdependencies 
within the supply chain. The enterprise may also use a request for information (RFIs), sources 
sought notice (SSNs), and/or due diligence questionnaires for the initial screening and collection 
of evidence from potential suppliers. Enterprises should not treat the initial C-SCRM due 
diligence risk assessment as exhaustive. Results of this research can also be helpful in shaping 
the sourcing approach and refining requirements.

Finally, the enterprise will complete the procurement step by releasing a statement of work 
(SOW), performance work statement (PWS), or statement of objective (SOO) for the release of a 
request for proposal (RFP) or request for quotes (RFQ). Any bidders responding to the RFP or 
RFQ should be evaluated against relevant, critical C-SCRM criteria. The RFP review process 
should also include any procurement-specific supplier risk assessment. The assessment criteria 
will be heavily informed by the defined C-SCRM requirements and include coverage over but 
not limited to information about the enterprise, its security processes, and its security track 
record. The response review process involves multiple C-SCRM stakeholders, including 
procurement, the mission and business process owner, appropriate information system owners, 
and technical experts. Prior to purchase, enterprises should identify and assess the quality of the 
product or system components, vulnerability(s) authenticity, and other relevant cybersecurity-
supply chain risk factors and complete this risk assessment prior to deployment.  
Once the contract is executed, the enterprise should monitor for changes that alter its exposure to 
cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain. Such changes may include internal enterprise or 
system changes, supplier operational or structural changes, product updates, and geopolitical or 
environmental changes. Contracts should include provisions that provide grounds for termination 
in cases where there are changes to cybersecurity supply chain risk that cannot be adequately 
mitigated to within acceptable levels. Finally, enterprises should continuously apply lessons 
learned and collected during the acquisition process to enhance their ability to assess, respond to, 
and monitor cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain.
