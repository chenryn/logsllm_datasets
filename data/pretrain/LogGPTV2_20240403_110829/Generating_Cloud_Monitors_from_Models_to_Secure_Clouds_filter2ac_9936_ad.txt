#### Code Snippet
```python
if request.method not in ["GET", "POST", "DELETE"]:
    return HttpResponseNotAllowed(["GET", "POST", "DELETE"])

if request.method == "DELETE":
    return volume_delete(request, volume_id)

def volume_delete(request, volume_id):
    # Add pre-conditions - detailed code is omitted for brevity
    if (project_id and project_volumes == 1 and project_volumes < project_quota and volume_status != 'in-use' and user_group == 'admin') or ...:
        # Redirect the DELETE request to the volume resource in the cloud implementation for the project with ID: 4
        url = f'http://130.232.85.9/v3/4/volumes/{volume_id}'
        opener = urllib2.build_opener(urllib2.HTTPHandler)
        req = RequestWithMethod(url, method='DELETE')
        response = opener.open(req)
        page = response.read()

        # Check post-conditions
        if (pre_project_id and pre_project_volumes == 1 and pre_project_volumes < pre_project_quota and pre_volume_status != 'in-use' and pre_user_group == 'admin') or ...:
            if response.code == 204:  # Resource deleted
                return HttpResponse(page)
```

#### Explanation
The provided code snippet handles HTTP requests for a volume resource, specifically for GET, POST, and DELETE methods. If the method is not one of these, it returns an `HttpResponseNotAllowed` with the allowed methods. For DELETE requests, it calls the `volume_delete` function.

The `volume_delete` function includes pre-conditions to ensure that the project has only one volume, the volume is not in use, and the user has admin privileges. It then constructs a URL to the cloud implementation, sends a DELETE request, and reads the response. Post-conditions are checked to ensure the state after the deletion, and if the response code is 204 (indicating successful deletion), it returns the response content.

#### Cloud Monitor URIs and Views Mapping
```python
url_patterns = patterns('',
    (r'^cmonitor/volumes/(\d{1,3})/$', volume),
    (r'^cmonitor/projects/$', projects),
    (r'^cmonitor/projects/(\d{1,3})/volume/$', project_volume),
)
```

This mapping defines the URIs for each resource and maps them to the respective views. The `patterns` function is used to create a list of URL patterns for the Django application.

#### Monitoring OpenStack
We installed OpenStack on a virtual machine (VM) using an ISO file on a MacBook Pro with an i7 processor and 16 GB RAM. We used Oracle VM VirtualBox and the Ubuntu 16.04 LTS ISO file. We deployed the Newton version of OpenStack with a two-node architecture: a controller node and a compute node. All necessary services were configured on these VM nodes. The controller node was configured with 8 GB RAM, 40 GB hard disk, and 2 VCPUs. The compute node had 40 GB hard disk, 2 VCPUs, and 4 GB RAM. We implemented our private cloud with three user groups and roles. The cloud infrastructure was set up for a project named `myProject`. The cloud monitor was run from the Mac's terminal using `curl` commands, which invoked the private cloud implementation running in Oracle VirtualBox.

During validation, we systematically introduced and detected three errors (mutants) in the cloud implementation to check for wrong authorization on resources. Due to space limitations, we omit the detailed discussion of the technical details of the validation procedure.

#### Related Work
There are three main research areas related to our work: model-driven security engineering, generation of executable code with contracts from models, and security of private clouds.

**Model-Driven Security Engineering:**
Research on using models to develop and analyze secure systems has been active for over a decade. Nguyen et al. [30] provide a comprehensive overview of this area. Specific frameworks include SECTET [12], UMLsec [23], MDSE@R [13], and [14]. These works introduce dedicated UML profiles to model security requirements. In our work, we rely on standard UML without employing a profiling mechanism, allowing us to use industrial-strength UML tools and promoting industrial adoption. Our model-driven approach is tailored for the stateless nature of REST APIs, which is novel compared to existing works.

**Generation of Executable Conditions:**
A significant body of work exists in generating executable conditions from various modeling notations. Gordon and Harel [19] generate executable code from structured requirements, translating controlled natural language requirements into live sequence charts. Lohmann [26] uses visual contracts to specify software interfaces, where visual contracts and class diagrams define dynamic and static aspects of a service. The approach relies on graph transformations to define pre- and post-conditions, and assertions generated from visual contracts are incorporated into Java Modeling Language for runtime checks. Our work is similar to Lohmannâ€™s but focuses on validating advanced scenarios of REST APIs, which are widely used in cloud frameworks. Additionally, we use invariants as defined by the design-by-contract paradigm [28].

**Cloud Security Research:**
Cloud security research has produced various monitoring tools, including those for risk evaluation, enhanced encryption, continuous checking of security requirements according to SLA documents, and detection of suspicious user behavior. Our monitoring tool addresses security by checking whether the implemented security policy complies with its specification. We aim to detect errors made by developers during the implementation of private clouds. While there are many technical solutions to safeguard cloud APIs, our work focuses on validating security at the application level. To the best of our knowledge, there are no model-based design and monitoring approaches that address behavioral interfaces to properly represent the stateless nature of REST APIs.

#### Conclusions
In this paper, we presented an approach and associated tool for monitoring security in the cloud. We relied on a model-driven approach to design APIs with REST interface features. The cloud monitors, generated from models, enable automated contract-based verification of functional and security requirements implemented by a private cloud infrastructure. This semi-automated approach helps cloud developers and security experts identify security loopholes in the implementation through modeling rather than manual code inspection or testing. It aids in spotting errors that might be exploited in data breaches or privilege escalation attacks. Given that open-source cloud frameworks undergo frequent changes, the automated nature of our approach allows developers to easily check whether functional and security requirements are preserved in new releases.
