project in April 2003, although not all servers have been monitored since this
time. Graphs are publicly available to anyone, but only paying subscribers can
access graphs for the last two hours. Raw data is retained for approximately a
year. Each probe collects between 10 and 20 megabytes of uncompressed data
per day and the total dataset is 121 gigabytes in size. The raw data is available
on request to country code TLD administrators and researchers, although non-
subscribers are restricted from accessing the most recent two days of data.
2.8 RIPE DB
The RIPE DB is an open shared database that is maintained by the RIPE
community [23], containing 3.2 million public object records. There are three
classes of data stored in the database: Internet number registration objects,
reverse DNS domain objects and route registry objects.
Internet number registration objects store details about IP addresses and AS
numbers including references to administrative and technical contact informa-
tion. The RIPE DB only contains records for the RIPE region, not the entire
Internet. The vast majority of the 2.6 million registration objects are for IPv4
addresses, but there are also 24,000 IPv6 address and 18,000 AS number objects
in the database.
At present, there are 410,000 reverse DNS objects and eight thousand forward
domain objects in the RIPE DB. Historically, both forward and reverse domain
information was stored but forward domains are no longer encouraged except
as community support for small, emerging domains. It is likely that all forward
domain support will cease in the future. The reverse DNS records are used to
create the zone ﬁles for the RIPE NCC reverse DNS service.

The route registry objects are used to provide an Internet Routing Registry
(IRR), enabling organisations that participate in Internet routing to store and
publish their routing policy. The RIPE DB contains approximately 100,000 route
registry objects. The structure of the routing data in the database conforms to
the Routing Policy Speciﬁcation Language [24] and the structure and use of the
route registry conforms to RFC 2650 [25]. Standard tools exist that can be used
to check the policies stored in the IRR data for consistency and to generate
router conﬁgurations from the IRR records. Unlike the other classes of object
in the RIPE DB, the route registry is synchronised to other IRRs and copies of
the information from the other IRRs is retained.
Public queries of the RIPE DB are supported through the use of both
command-line and web whois tools. A daily limit is imposed on the number
of queries that include personal information attributes. Bulk data is also avail-
able via FTP. The bulk data ﬁles are generated daily, including both a ﬁle with
the complete database and ﬁles split by object type. Personal details, such as
the person and maintainer objects, are not included in these ﬁles. The com-
plete database ﬁle is approximately 150MB in size. In addition, it is possible to
subscribe to a near real time mirror feed of the database for an annual fee.
Access to personal data within the RIPE DB is restricted for both legal and
practical (e.g. limiting abuse) reasons. At present, the restrictions are applied at
a very broad level which sometimes results in limitations that are inappropriate.
For example, an ISP that has entered a large number of person objects may not
be able to access all the objects that they have created. This problem will be
resolved as part of the development of the common RIPE data sharing platform.
3 External Datasets
3.1 Auckland
The Auckland dataset consists of a series of trace sets collected by the WAND
group at the University of Waikato. The traces were collected at the University
of Auckland in New Zealand, measuring the link between the University and
the Internet. All of the traces were captured using DAG hardware capture cards
[26], although the card model was upgraded on several occasions. Each of the
Auckland trace sets is brieﬂy described in Table 1, which is based on detailed
summaries provided by the Waikato Internet Trace Storage (WITS) project [2].
There have been some signiﬁcant variations in the capture conﬁguration be-
tween each trace set. Some of the changes were necessitated by the network
infrastructure being upgraded, meaning that the measurement point was no
longer capable of capturing all of the traﬃc it had previously. In other cases, the
amount of packet header data that was retained is varied, e.g. the Auckland VI
traces captured the ﬁrst 64 bytes of every TCP, UDP and ICMP packet whereas
the Auckland VII traces are limited to only the ATM cell header for all packets
regardless of protocol.
Most of the Auckland traces were publicly released by NLANR [27] and fre-
quently feature in measurement literature such as [28] and [29]. With the recent

demise of the NLANR site, the traces have become diﬃcult for researchers to ac-
quire. In addition, the RIPE repository will include the Auckland I and Auckland
V trace sets, which were not available from NLANR.
3.2 Waikato
The Waikato dataset is a collection of six very long-duration trace sets captured
at the border of the University of Waikato network by the WAND group. The
capture point is located between the University network infrastructure and the
commodity Internet, allowing access to all traﬃc entering and exiting the Uni-
versity but excluding any internal traﬃc. All of the traces were captured using
software that was speciﬁcally developed for the Waikato capture point [30] and
a DAG 3 series hardware capture card [26]. All IP addresses within the traces
are anonymised using Crypto-Pan AES encryption [31], with the encryption key
being changed on a weekly basis. A brief description of each of the trace sets is
shown in Table 2.
The location and hardware of the capture point has remained unchanged
since the ﬁrst capture began in 2003. The software has been upgraded between
each trace set, resulting in some minor variations. For example, in Waikato I
packets are truncated at the end of the transport header but subsequent trace
sets retained four bytes of unanonymised application payload for all packets
except in the case of DNS packets where twelve bytes were kept.

The RIPE NCC Internet Measurement Data Repository
119
The Waikato I trace set is currently available for public download from the
WITS archive [2]. The other Waikato trace sets will be made available through
the RIPE data repository.
3.3 NLANR Datasets
The NLANR project [27] collected both active and passive datasets. These data
sets have been the focus of a signiﬁcant amount of research and many papers have
been published based on them. Although the project is complete, the datasets
collected are still in demand. They have been preserved by the WAND network
research group and are available from the WITS [2] repository. The traces will
also be hosted on the RIPE repository.
4 Conclusion
This paper catalogues and describes the large quantity of Internet measurement
data that will be shared with the research community through a data repository
hosted by the RIPE NCC. While much of the data described here is already
publicly available, it is scattered amongst a variety of hosting organisations or,
in the case of the Auckland traces, is no longer available from the original source.
By creating a common portal for sharing and accessing all of the data, it will
become easier for researchers to locate and download suitable measurement data
for their particular project.
The primary aim of the repository is to bridge the gap between the organ-
isations capable of conducting Internet measurements and the researchers who
analyse the measurement data. This is evidenced by the partnership with the
University of Waikato to enable the Auckland and Waikato datasets to be mir-
rored on the RIPE repository. However, the relationship must function in both
directions to ensure the collected data is relevant and useful. As a result, we
encourage submissions from the community regarding the collection and for-
mat of any of the aforementioned datasets that would improve their utility to
researchers.
