### Project Overview and Data Availability

The project, initiated in April 2003, has not monitored all servers continuously since its inception. Publicly available graphs are accessible to anyone, but only paying subscribers can view the most recent two hours of data. Raw data is retained for approximately one year. Each probe collects between 10 and 20 megabytes of uncompressed data per day, resulting in a total dataset size of 121 gigabytes. This raw data is available upon request to country code top-level domain (ccTLD) administrators and researchers, with non-subscribers restricted from accessing the most recent two days of data.

### RIPE Database (RIPE DB)

The RIPE DB is an open, community-maintained database containing over 3.2 million public object records. It includes three main types of data: Internet number registration objects, reverse DNS domain objects, and route registry objects.

#### Internet Number Registration Objects
These objects store details about IP addresses and Autonomous System (AS) numbers, including references to administrative and technical contact information. The RIPE DB primarily covers the RIPE region and contains approximately 2.6 million IPv4 address records, 24,000 IPv6 address records, and 18,000 AS number records.

#### Reverse DNS Domain Objects
There are currently 410,000 reverse DNS objects and 8,000 forward domain objects in the RIPE DB. Historically, both forward and reverse domain information was stored, but forward domains are no longer encouraged except for small, emerging domains. The reverse DNS records are used to create zone files for the RIPE NCC reverse DNS service.

#### Route Registry Objects
Route registry objects provide an Internet Routing Registry (IRR), allowing organizations involved in Internet routing to store and publish their routing policies. The RIPE DB contains around 100,000 route registry objects, which conform to the Routing Policy Specification Language (RPSL) as defined in RFC 2622 and RFC 2650. Standard tools are available to check the consistency of policies and generate router configurations from the IRR records. The route registry is synchronized with other IRRs, and copies of the information from these other IRRs are retained.

### Public Access and Data Sharing

Public queries to the RIPE DB are supported through command-line and web-based whois tools. A daily limit is imposed on queries that include personal information attributes. Bulk data is available via FTP, with daily generated files that include the complete database and files split by object type. Personal details, such as person and maintainer objects, are excluded from these bulk files. The complete database file is approximately 150MB in size. Additionally, a near real-time mirror feed of the database is available for an annual fee.

Access to personal data within the RIPE DB is restricted for legal and practical reasons, such as limiting abuse. Currently, these restrictions are applied broadly, sometimes leading to inappropriate limitations. For example, an ISP that has entered a large number of person objects may not be able to access all the objects they have created. This issue will be addressed as part of the development of the common RIPE data sharing platform.

### External Datasets

#### Auckland Dataset
The Auckland dataset, collected by the WAND group at the University of Waikato, consists of trace sets captured at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. These traces measure the link between the University and the Internet. All traces were captured using DAG hardware capture cards, with some upgrades to the card model. Table 1 provides a brief description of each Auckland trace set, based on detailed summaries from the Waikato Internet Trace Storage (WITS) project. There have been significant variations in the capture configuration between each trace set, often due to network infrastructure upgrades or changes in the amount of packet header data retained.

| Name | Format | Year | Duration | Packets | Bytes | Size |
|------|--------|------|----------|---------|-------|------|
| I    | ERF    | 1999 | 7 days   | 169 M   | 8 GB  | 2 GB |
| II   | Legacy ATM | 2000 | 24 days  | 996 M  | 359 GB | 26 GB |
| IV   | Legacy ATM | 2001 | 45 days  | 3,157 M | 1,269 GB | 64 GB |
| V    | ATM Cell | 2001 | 7.5 hours | 2,710 M | 133 GB | 8 GB |
| VI   | Mixed Legacy | 2001 | 4.5 days | 844 M  | 345 GB | 17 GB |
| VII  | ATM Cell | 2001 | 15.5 hours | 6,040 M | 297 GB | 19 GB |
| VIII | ERF    | 2003 | 13 days  | 1,654 M | 698 GB | 68 GB |

Most of the Auckland traces were publicly released by NLANR and frequently feature in measurement literature. With the recent closure of the NLANR site, the traces have become difficult for researchers to acquire. The RIPE repository will include the Auckland I and Auckland V trace sets, which were not available from NLANR.

#### Waikato Dataset
The Waikato dataset, also collected by the WAND group, consists of six long-duration trace sets captured at the border of the University of Waikato network. The capture point is located between the University network and the commodity Internet, excluding internal traffic. All traces were captured using custom software and a DAG 3 series hardware capture card. IP addresses within the traces are anonymized using Crypto-Pan AES encryption, with the encryption key changed weekly. Table 2 provides a brief description of each Waikato trace set.

| Name | Format | Years | Duration | Packets | Bytes | Size |
|------|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|------|
| I    | ERF    | 2003-2005 | 620 days | 53,263 M | 21,434 GB | 1,329 GB |
| II   | ERF    | 2005-2006 | 301 days | 34,712 M | 15,789 GB | 839 GB |
| III  | ERF    | 2006-2007 | 160 days | 21,984 M | 9,144 GB | 545 GB |
| IV   | ERF    | 2007     | 56 days  | 10,128 M | 4,588 GB | 255 GB |
| V    | ERF    | 2007     | 99 days  | 19,710 M | 9,740 GB | 491 GB |
| VI   | ERF    | 2007-2008 | 135 days | 20,886 M | 11,092 GB | 495 GB |

The Waikato I trace set is currently available for public download from the WITS archive. The other Waikato trace sets will be made available through the RIPE data repository.

#### NLANR Datasets
The NLANR project collected both active and passive datasets, which have been the focus of significant research and numerous publications. Although the project is complete, the datasets remain in demand. They have been preserved by the WAND network research group and are available from the WITS repository. The traces will also be hosted on the RIPE repository.

### Conclusion

This paper catalogs and describes a large quantity of Internet measurement data that will be shared with the research community through a data repository hosted by the RIPE NCC. While much of this data is already publicly available, it is scattered among various hosting organizations or, in the case of the Auckland traces, no longer available from the original source. By creating a common portal for sharing and accessing all the data, it will become easier for researchers to locate and download suitable measurement data for their projects.

The primary aim of the repository is to bridge the gap between organizations capable of conducting Internet measurements and researchers who analyze the data. This is exemplified by the partnership with the University of Waikato to mirror the Auckland and Waikato datasets on the RIPE repository. We encourage submissions from the community regarding the collection and format of any of the aforementioned datasets to improve their utility to researchers.
