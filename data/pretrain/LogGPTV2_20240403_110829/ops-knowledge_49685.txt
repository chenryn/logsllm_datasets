I am trying to use the Bulkloader feature of Google App Engine, but I am having difficulty understanding the steps from the documentation. The documentation instructs me to add the following configuration to my `app.yaml` file:

```yaml
builtins:
- remote_api: on
```

I have added this configuration as instructed. Next, the documentation suggests running the following command:

```sh
appcfg.py update
```

However, I do not have an `appcfg.py` file, and I am unsure of the exact command to execute this line.

I typically use the App Engine Launcher to upload my project to the server and have never used a command-line tool to update or upload it.

Could someone please help me understand what I might be missing?

Thank you in advance.

**Response:**

If you are using the App Engine Launcher, you can simply click the "Deploy" button. This action will run the `appcfg.py update` command for you. The `appcfg.py` script is included as part of the Google Cloud SDK, so you don't need to worry about locating or executing it manually.

I hope this helps clarify your situation!
