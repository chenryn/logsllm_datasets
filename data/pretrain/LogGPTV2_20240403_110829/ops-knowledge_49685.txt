User: I am trying to use Bulkloader of google app engine but unfortunately could not understand what to do from documentation. It says add this part to app.yaml
builtins:
- remote_api: on
ok i have added. Then says that i have to execute this command
appcfg.py update 
but i don't have any appcfg.py file. And also what is the command which executes this line?
Please somebody tell me what i am missing I use AppEngineLauncher to upload my project to server.. I have naver used a command to update or upload it.
Thanks in advance..
Assistant: If you're using App Engine Launcher, simply click the Deploy button; it runs appcfg.py update.  appcfg is installed as part of the SDK.
