User: I am working on a django web application.
A function 'xyx' (it updates a variable) needs to be called every 2 minutes.
I want one http request should start the daemon and keep calling xyz (every 2 minutes) until I send another http request to stop it.
Appreciate your ideas.
Thanks

Assistant: There are a number of ways to achieve this. Assuming the correct server resources I would write a python script that calls function xyz "outside" of your django directory (although importing the necessary stuff) that only runs if /var/run/django-stuff/my-daemon.run exists. Get cron to run this every two minutes.
Then, for your django functions, your start function creates the above mentioned file if it doesn't already exist and the stop function destroys it.
As I say, there are other ways to achieve this. You could have a python script on loop waiting for approx 2 minutes... etc. In either case, you're up against the fact that two python scripts run on two different invocations of cpython (no idea if this is the case with mod_wsgi) cannot communicate with each other and as such IPC between python scripts is not simple, so you need to use some sort of formal IPC (like semaphores, files etc) rather than just common variables (which won't work).
