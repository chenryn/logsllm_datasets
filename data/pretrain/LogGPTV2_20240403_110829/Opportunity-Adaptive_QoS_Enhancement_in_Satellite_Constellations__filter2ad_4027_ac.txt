as the QoS measure. In order to determine a QoS spectrum
that enumerates all the QoS levels relevant to the system in
question, we analyze the relationships between system be-

more coordinating satellites will fail during the interval will be negligible.
havior and the geometry properties of the constellation as
follows.
As described in Section 2, when an orbital plane loses
satellites after spare exhaustion, geometric relations be-
tween the footprints of adjacent satellites will change; fur-
ther, the geometric relations between adjacent satellites can
be described in terms of Tr[k] and Tc. Since k denotes the
number of operational satellites that are actively in service
in a plane, we use the term “orbital-plane capacity” to re-
fer to the value of k. Clearly, a decrement of k will result
in an increased value of Tr[k]. Thus, the initial relation

assume τ < 9 and thus τ ≤ L1[k] is true for all the under-
lapping cases (in which k < 11). Then, Theorems 1 and 2
lead us to deﬁne two more auxiliary parameters to facilitate
the solution derivation for P (Y = y | k):
ˆL[k] = min{L1[k] − L2[k], τ},
˜L[k] = min{L1[k], τ}
Since the signal occurrence is assumed to be a Poisson
process, the distribution of the instants when the signals oc-
cur is the same as the uniform distribution of the event over
the same interval [13]. Consequently, if we let G3[k] de-

evaluate the probability that the iterative computation com-

are the probability density functions of signal duration and
iterative geolocation computation time, respectively. We
assume that signal duration is exponentially distributed,
which is a fairly typical assumption used in performance
modeling for telecommunication systems; we also assume
that iterative geolocation computation time is exponentially
distributed in order to allow the amount of time required for

Since QoS level 3 can be achieved only if footprints over-
