User: Maybe a stupid question, but I was wondering where Python's distutils get the compiler options from? It gets some linked directories wrong and I want to correct that once and for all. 
I know there should be a prefix/lib/pythonver/distutils/distutils.cfg but I can't find any distutils.cfg anywhere on the computer. Obviously I haven't got a local setup.cfg or any $HOME/.pydistutils.cfg.
I'm using the Enthought 64-bit distribution, version 7.3 (Python 2.7) on Mac OS X 10.8.3
Cheers,

Assistant: Compiler options are taken from CPythonâ€™s Makefile.  IOW they are the same as the ones used to compile Python.  You can override most of them on the command line as Evert described.
The global distutils.cfg is something that a sysadmin can create to set default options, not a file that is installed with Python.
