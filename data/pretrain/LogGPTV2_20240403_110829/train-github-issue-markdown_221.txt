Ability to collapse on a field. For example, I want the most relevant result
from all different report types. Or similarly, the most recent result of each
report type. Or maybe, I want to de-dup on headline.
So, the sort order would dictate which one from the group is returned. Similar
to what is discussed here:

From my understanding, it seems that in order for field collapsing to be
efficient, the result set must be relatively small.
This is also referred to as "Combine" on some other search products.
