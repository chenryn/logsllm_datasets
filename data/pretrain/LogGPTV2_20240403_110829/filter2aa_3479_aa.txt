Birth of Bitcoin 
• Described by Satoshi Nakamoto (中本聪) in 2008  
• Introduced as open-source software on the evening 
of January 3, 2009

Excellent Tutorial for Beginners  
• How the Bitcoin protocol actually works 
- Published by Michael Nielsen on December 6, 2013 
- http://www.michaelnielsen.org/ddi/how-the-bitcoin-protocol-actually-works  
- “This is the best explanation of the Bitcoin protocol that I have read” 
by Bruce Schneier https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/12/bitcoin_explana.html   
• “To understand the post, you need to be comfortable 
with public key cryptography, and with the closely 
related idea of digital signatures. I’ll also assume you’re 
familiar with cryptographic hashing.” 
• “In the world of atoms we achieve security with devices 
such as locks, safes, signatures, and bank vaults. In the 
world of bits we achieve this kind of security with 
cryptography. And that’s why Bitcoin is at heart a 
cryptographic protocol.”

Elliptic Curves  椭圆曲线 
• The rich and deep theory of Elliptic Curves has 
been studied by mathematicians over 150 years

The Elliptic Curve in Bitcoin for ECDSA

Key Pairs for Digital Signatures 
• The base point G is fixed on the given Elliptic Curve 
• P = [m] G 
- Given m, it is easy and fast to find the point P 
• Using “double and add” for scalar multiplication 
- Given P, it is extremely hard to find the integer m 
• Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (椭圆曲线离散对数问题) 
- A randomly generated integer m is a private key for ECDSA 
• A private key is used to sign Bitcoin transactions 
- The point  P is the public key corresponding to m 
• A public key is used by other nodes to verify Bitcoin transactions 
• A Bitcoin address is the hash value of a public key P

Hash Functions  杂凑函数 
19 
• Definition  H  is a function with one-way property if given 
any  y, it is computationally infeasible to find any value  x  in 
the domain of  H  such that  H(x) = y 
• Definition  H  is a cryptographic hash function if 
– Input : bit strings of arbitrary length 
– Output H : bit strings of fixed length  
• “hash values” or “hash codes” 
– H  has one-way property 
• Definition  H  is collision free if it is computationally 
infeasible to find  x'  x  such that  H(x' ) = H(x)

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2  
•
SHA stands for Secure Hash Algorithm 
•
SHA-2 is a set of cryptographic hash functions designed by the U.S. 
National Security Agency (NSA) and published in 2001 by NIST as a 
U.S. Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS)
