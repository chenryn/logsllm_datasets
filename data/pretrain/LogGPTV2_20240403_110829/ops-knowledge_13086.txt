User: An application has problems with repeated requests and inefficient queries, please provide a solution and improve system efficiency.
Assistant: 1. Cache data: Using caching technology can avoid repeated requests and inefficient queries. Applications can cache frequently accessed data in the cache so that they do not need to revisit the database every time, reducing database pressure and query latency. 2. Database query optimization: Optimizing database queries can improve query efficiency. Query performance can be optimized using techniques such as indexes, partitions, and redundant columns. Avoid full table scans and unnecessary subqueries whenever possible. 3. Performance monitoring: use performance monitoring tools to locate system bottlenecks and optimize them to improve system efficiency. 4. Horizontal expansion: By increasing the number of servers, the load is distributed to multiple servers to improve system performance and concurrent processing capabilities. 5. Asynchronous processing: Using asynchronous processing can release the resources of the main thread, reduce the corresponding time and delay of the application program, and improve processing efficiency. 6. Code optimization: optimize the code inside the application, and use efficient algorithms and data structures to improve code execution efficiency and reduce database access frequency.
