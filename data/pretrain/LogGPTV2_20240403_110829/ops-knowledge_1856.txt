User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Docker COPY issue - "no such file or directory" In my Dockerfile I have the following 'COPY" statement:

# Copy app code
COPY /srv/visitor /srv/visitor


It should go without saying that in my host system, under the "/srv/visitor" directory, there is indeed my source code:

[root@V12 visitor]# ls /srv/visitor/
Dockerfile  package.json  visitor.js


Now, when I try to build an image using this Dockerfile it hangs at the step when the "COPY" is supposed to happen:

Step 10 : COPY /srv/visitor /srv/visitor
INFO[0155] srv/visitor: no such file or directory


It says that there is no such directory, but there clearly is.

Any ideas?

UPDATE 1:

It has been pointed to me that I was mistaken, in the way I understood build context. The suggestion amounted to changing the "COPY" statement to this:

COPY . /srv/visitor


The problem is that I had it this way, and the build process halted at the very next step:

RUN npm install


It said something along the lines of "no package.json file found", when there clearly is one.

UPDATE 2:

I tried running it with this change in the Dockerfile:

COPY source /srv/visitor/


It halted when trying to run npm:

Step 12 : RUN npm install

npm ERR! Please include the following file with any support request:

So, has the copy been performed? If yes, why is npm unable to find package.json?

Assistant: For me the directory was in the correct context, only it was included in the (hidden) .dockerignore file in the root of the project. This leads to the error message:

lstat mydir/myfile.ext: no such file or directory
