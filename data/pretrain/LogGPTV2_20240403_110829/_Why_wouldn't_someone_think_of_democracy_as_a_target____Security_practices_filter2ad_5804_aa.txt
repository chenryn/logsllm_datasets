Abstract
People who are involved with political campaigns face in-
creased digital security threats from well-funded, sophisti-
cated attackers, especially nation-states. Improving political
campaign security is a vital part of protecting democracy. To
identify campaign security issues, we conducted qualitative re-
search with 28 participants across the U.S. political spectrum
to understand the digital security practices, challenges, and
perceptions of people involved in campaigns. A main, over-
arching ﬁnding is that a unique combination of threats, con-
straints, and work culture lead people involved with political
campaigns to use technologies from across platforms and do-
mains in ways that leave them—and democracy—vulnerable
to security attacks. Sensitive data was kept in a plethora of
personal and work accounts, with ad hoc adoption of strong
passwords, two-factor authentication, encryption, and access
controls. No individual company, committee, organization,
campaign, or academic institution can solve the identiﬁed
problems on their own. To this end, we provide an initial
understanding of this complex problem space and recommen-
dations for how a diverse group of experts can begin working
together to improve security for political campaigns.
1 Introduction
“What is 100% true. . . is that foreign adversaries want [cam-
paign] information. . . The faster we all realize that, the better
off we’re going to be. . . to see politics and campaigns at all
levels as a fundamental piece of democracy that needs to be
protected. . . . For sure foreign adversaries are trying to attack
our systems. . . Why wouldn’t someone think of democracy
as a target?” –A participant
Political campaigns, for their role in free and fair elections,
are a fundamental part of democracies around the world.
Alarmingly, the people and organizations supporting cam-
paigns are under attack. High-proﬁle compromises include
John Podesta’s personal email in 2016 (during Clinton’s U.S.
Presidential campaign) [70, 76], multiple national party com-
mittees in 2015 and 2016 [19,68], Sarah Palin’s personal email
in 2008 (during McCain’s U.S. Presidential campaign) [97],
and emails from Emmanuel Macron’s campaign (during the
2017 French Presidential race) [95]. Lesser known campaigns
have also been affected—for example, a candidate whose
strategy documents were leaked in 2016 lost their primary
race for a seat in the House of Representatives [55]. These
examples illustrate how security attacks on people involved
with campaigns can damage campaigns, potentially change
election outcomes, and undermine public trust. Thus, digital
security is an important part of winning elections and is a
nonpartisan imperative for protecting democratic institutions.
Attackers may target anyone who is afﬁliated with cam-
paigns, including candidates, campaign staff, political con-
sultants, committee staff, and more. These people face an
outsized security risk compared to the general population.
Successful attacks can also carry disproportionate impacts. A
growing literature on at-risk user populations (e.g., [38, 60,
63,84,88]) demonstrates the importance of understanding the
different and complex kinds of risks these users face. Because
of the elevated risk and outsized harms facing people involved
with campaigns, it is important that the security community
understand their unique perspectives and needs.
Despite the critical role that campaigns play in democratic
elections, there is little in the literature about the security
perceptions and needs of the people who are involved with
campaigns—that is, those who work on, with, or in support
of them. Prior work on election security has focused largely
on securing election infrastructure [5, 11, 62, 69], ensuring
election outcomes are accurate [5,41,54], investigating the na-
ture and impacts of mis/disinformation operations on democ-
racy [9,16,32,67,72,78], and describing politically-motivated
trolling operations and their impacts on citizen participation
[8, 15, 35]. Several organizations have produced guidance
for campaign workers, embedding knowledge of the security
protections they should employ [10, 22, 27, 29, 33, 56, 90, 96].
However, these studies and guides leave a gap in the security
community’s understanding of how people involved with cam-
paigns approach security technologies and the related barriers
to adoption that these users experience.

In this work, we study the security perceptions, practices,
and challenges of people involved with political campaigns
through qualitative research conducted with 28 participants
across the U.S. political spectrum. Our participants repre-
sented a wide range of roles and organizations afﬁliated with
campaigns, from local to Presidential elections. Our study
explores the following research questions:
• RQ1: What threats do people involved with campaigns
perceive that they face? What outcomes do they believe
could result from the threats?
• RQ2: How do people involved with campaigns use tech-
nology in their day to day work? What digital security
vulnerabilities does this introduce?
• RQ3: How well do people involved with campaigns un-
derstand or adopt security best practices for campaigns?
• RQ4: What work culture or contextual factors inﬂuence
the adoption of security best practices within campaigns?
• RQ5: How do people involved with campaigns think
security practices or technology might be improved?
The key contribution of this paper is an initial understand-
ing of campaign security from people involved with them
and recommendations for how to begin to improve this com-
plex problem space from a user-centered perspective. We ﬁnd
that a unique combination of threats, constraints, and work
culture lead people involved with political campaigns to use
technologies from across platforms and domains in ways that
leave them—and democracy—vulnerable to security attacks.
Security is a relatively new concern in the campaign space,
and parts of this well-established sector have yet to adapt.
In particular, this population works in a fast-paced, hectic,
temporary environment, where winning the election is the top
priority and anything that does not clearly contribute to that
is perceived to be a waste of time. This population also tends
to not have formal technology training, and their digital secu-
rity knowledge is limited. This results in a work environment
in which particularly sensitive data—communications and
ﬁles—are vulnerable due to weak security practices, including
the ad hoc use of strong passwords, two-factor authentication
(2FA), encryption, and access control restrictions.
We detail campaign work culture and practices so that
technology creators, together with a diverse group of experts
who are trying to support this population, can understand
barriers campaigns are likely to face when trying to adopt
strong security practices. We suggest that the longer-term goal
of those who are trying to support this population should be
to shift the work culture on campaigns to prioritize security,
and that in the near-term, it should seek further consensus
around the security actions that campaigns should prioritize
to inform security education; investigate how to coordinate
the standardization of account security protections (including
2FA, password managers, and multi-tenant accounts); and
improve the affordability of security technologies and training.
Progress on these issues is critical to ensuring that democratic
elections focus on candidates’ messages and merits, not on
their digital security practices.
2 Related Work
We frame our study on the security practices of people in-
volved with political campaigns in the broader context of
election security research, existing guidance for campaigns,
and related studies of at-risk populations and high-risk work
environments.
2.1 Digital threats facing democracy
Our research is part of a much broader area exploring how
to secure democracy against digital threats. Collectively,
these discussions of “security” incorporate a broad view of
how digital information or systems may be used to harm
the democratic process or relevant institutions. For example,
Whyte [94] describes “cyber-enabled information warfare”
as attempts to inﬂuence democratic politics with tactics such
as hacking private information sources within a democracy,
then using what was stolen or other messaging to threaten
or undermine the credibility of the democracy’s sources of
information. Looking broadly across various observed elec-
tion and political interference operations, Herpig et al. [45]
categorized digital attack tactics against democracy to include:
manipulating data (e.g., votes), eroding trust in democratic
processes, denying legitimate actors access to critical data
or infrastructure, espionage, leaking data, persuading voters,
and blackmail. Herpig et al. further described these tactics as
seeking to undermine democracy from different angles, such
as changing the outcome of elections, delegitimizing demo-
cratic processes, harming reputations, or creating barriers to
government operations or relations.
Within this broad body of work on securing democ-
racy from digital attackers, researchers have focused on
the security of elections [5, 11, 62, 69], information cam-
paigns intended to misinform and polarize the public or tar-
geted groups [9, 16, 32, 67, 72, 78, 85], and trolling opera-
tions aimed at suppressing citizen participation in democ-
racy [8, 15, 35, 85].
Our research distinctly focuses on the security practices
and challenges of people who are involved with political cam-
paigns, which tend to operate in the months leading up to and
weeks just after election day.
2.2 Protecting digital security in elections
The bulk of the literature on election security focuses on
election infrastructure and the veriﬁability of election out-
comes. Researchers have broadly explored the security of
1182    30th USENIX Security Symposium

election infrastructure in the U.S. (e.g., [5, 10, 51, 62, 69])
and other countries (e.g., [18, 40, 83]). Evaluations of speciﬁc
voting machines (e.g., [7, 14, 34]), ballot marking devices
(e.g., [13]), and voting applications (e.g., [81, 82]), as well
as post-election audits (e.g., [6, 41, 54]), aimed to identify
insecurities in voting systems and ensure votes were counted
correctly. Bernhard et al. [12] outlined the requirements of
secure, veriﬁable elections, and reviewed current electronic
voting systems and auditing approaches to highlight open
issues. To help U.S. state and local election ofﬁcials under-
stand and protect against security threats to elections, The
Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs’ Defend-
ing Digital Democracy Project (D3P) published a security
guide for them [10]. However, election infrastructure and the
people managing it are often separate from those involved
with political campaigns, who we studied.
The vast majority of what is written about the security of
people involved with campaigns can be found outside of peer-
reviewed literature. The press and bloggers have anecdotally
described some security practices of campaign workers and
adoption barriers they face, such as certain work culture issues,
use of personal accounts, inconsistent use of encrypted mes-
saging, under-use of 2FA, and challenges setting up security
keys and password managers [21, 26, 57, 89]. Though little is
published about how campaign workers approach security, we
do know they are at risk. The U.S. government [31], technol-
ogy companies [20,47] and the press [59,71,89] have reported
on security threats campaigns face, focusing on nation-state
attackers utilizing phishing and disinformation. We seek to
illuminate the perspectives and practices of campaign workers
in a rigorous, qualitative study, to help address these serious
threats to democracy.
2.3 Efforts to support campaign security
Several groups have developed security guides, checklists,
or playbooks for people on campaigns. These guides were
often created by people who have worked on or with cam-
paigns, and embed knowledge of what security protections
campaigns need most. The Belfer Center’s D3P has produced
several guides for campaigns, including a ﬁve-item prioritized
checklist of security advice [10]. Bob Lord, Chief Security
Ofﬁcer of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), pub-
lished a device and account security checklist aimed at people
working with campaigns [56]. Other guides focusing on cam-
paign security include those from the FBI’s Protected Voices
initiative [33], the Center for Democracy & Technology [22],
Professor Dan Wallach of Rice University [90], Defending
Digital Campaigns (DDC) [27], the USC Election Cybersecu-
rity Initiative [29], and Lenny Zeltser of Axonius [96]. Col-
lectively, these guides prioritize use of secure cloud providers,
strong account security (2FA, strong passwords, password
managers), encryption for communications and stored data,
and security training. But across the set of guides, a plethora
of other actions are recommended, with extensive technical de-
tail and differing priorities, which may overwhelm campaign
workers who have limited time and security knowledge.
There is limited organizational support to help campaigns
wade through disparate, complex guidance. Federal Election
Commission (FEC) campaign ﬁnance rules require that cam-
paigns use their own money to purchase security products or
services. In only the past two years, the DDC1, a non-proﬁt
organization, received special permission from the FEC to
provide low- and no-cost security products and services to
committees and campaigns meeting certain criteria, across
parties [92]. The DDC has partnered with a host of companies
to begin implementing key aspects of these guidelines on
federal campaigns. But many campaigns may not be able to
receive security support via these speciﬁc FEC exemptions.
Overall, political campaigns have limited, ﬂedgling support
for security, while threats from adversaries rapidly grow and
change. This study of campaign workers’ perspectives and
practices is an important early step toward ensuring new and
modiﬁed technologies will meet user needs.
2.4 At-risk populations & security
Our study joins a growing body of research on at-risk pop-
ulations—technology users who are speciﬁcally targeted
for security or privacy invasions because of who they are
(e.g., transgender individuals [52, 77], people with visual
impairments [2, 3, 43], and people with learning disabili-
ties [58]), what they do (e.g., journalists [63, 64] and ac-
tivists [84]), where they are (e.g., people in South Asia [1,75]),
or who they are/were with (e.g., survivors of intimate part-
ner abuse [36, 42, 60, 87], survivors of trafﬁcking [23], and
people targeted by other close relations [53]). Some at-risk
populations may be susceptible to attacks because they don’t
know how to avoid them or lack the resources to recover (e.g.,
children [48, 98], older adults [37, 65, 66], undocumented
immigrants [38], refugees [79], and people experiencing ﬁ-
nancial insecurity [80, 88]). Groups may be uniquely at risk
at the intersections of any of the above characteristics (e.g.,
low-income African Americans in New York City [30]).
Despite this growing literature, the vast majority of research
on user perceptions of digital security focuses on general user
populations (e.g., [44, 49, 91, 93]). But technology designed
wholly based on the feedback of general users may not ade-
quately address the threats to at-risk populations. An impor-
tant contribution of this and other work with at-risk users is
to add nuance to the security community’s understanding of
the different and complex kinds of risk some users face that
do not necessarily ﬁt into general models of usable security.

2.5 Security in high-risk work environments
Our work on political campaign security shares similarities
with prior research on workplace security. Many types of
organizations must balance investments of time and money
on security with other priorities, and those priorities depend on
many factors, such as assessed risks, business or work practice
needs, organizational maturity, and more [4, 24, 46, 64]. Prior
work on high-risk work environments shows the value in
understanding unique working conditions that both elevate
risk and augment threat models. Examples include journalists
and news organizations [63, 64] and small businesses [4, 24,
46].
McGregor et al. [63, 64] studied journalists and their or-
ganizations. Similar to our ﬁndings for campaign workers,
journalists were most worried about their communications
