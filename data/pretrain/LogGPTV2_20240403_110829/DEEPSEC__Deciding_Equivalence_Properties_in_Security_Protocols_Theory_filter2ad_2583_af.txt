### Example: Helios hR-W 11
- An attacker can cast a ballot in the name of an honest voter. The same ballot is then removed through weeding. However, as the honest voter casts a second (differently randomized) ballot, the tally is biased by containing an additional vote for the honest voter's candidate. This attack is detected by DEEPSEC.
- The ZKP version does not suffer from this attack because ballots are linked to voter identities and cannot be cast on behalf of someone else.
- Note that, while Prêt-à-Voter is within the scope of AKISS, it failed to produce a proof: AKISS only approximates trace equivalence of non-determinate processes and finds a false attack here.

### Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper, we have studied automated verification of equivalence properties, encompassing both theoretical and practical aspects. We provide tight complexity results for static equivalence, trace equivalence, and labeled bisimilarity, summarized in Figure 1. Specifically, we show that deciding trace equivalence and labeled bisimilarity for a bounded number of sessions is coNEXP complete for subterm convergent destructor rewrite systems. We implement our procedure in the DEEPSEC prototype. As demonstrated through an extensive benchmark (Figure 7), our tool is broad in scope and efficient compared to other tools.

Our work opens several directions for future research:
1. **Lifting Restrictions**: We aim to lift the restriction of subterm convergent equational theories. Although the problem becomes undecidable for more general rewrite theories, we plan to design a partially correct (i.e., sound and complete but not necessarily terminating) procedure, similar to the one underlying the AKISS tool [19].
2. **General Rewrite Systems**: We plan to extend our approach to more general rewrite systems. From a complexity perspective, we will study parametrized complexity, considering the rewrite system or the degree of non-determinism as parameters. This may help us understand which parts of the input contribute to high complexity and guide further optimizations.
3. **POR Techniques**: We have seen that POR techniques significantly improve the tool’s performance on action-determinate processes. We wish to develop similar techniques for more general classes of processes.
