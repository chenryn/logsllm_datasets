ballot in his name. The same ballot by the honest voter
is than removed through weeding. However, as the honest
voter casts a second (differently randomised) ballot the tally
is biased by containing an additional vote for the honest
voter’s candidate. This attack is found by DEEPSEC. We
can show that the ZKP version does not suffer from this
attack as ballots are linked to voter identities and cannot
be cast on behalf of someone else. Besides note that, while
PaV is a priori in the scope of AKISS, it failed to produce a
proof: AKISS only approximates trace equivalence of non-
determinate processes and ﬁnds a false attack here.
Finally we note that the BAC, Prˆet-`a-Voter and Helios
protocols are not action-determinate and therefore do not
beneﬁt from the POR optimisation, which explains the
much higher veriﬁcation times when increasing the sessions.
Nevertheless, as exempliﬁed by the Helios hR-W example,
attacks may be found very efﬁciently, as it generally does
not require to explore the entire state space.
7. Conclusion and future work
In this paper we have studied automated veriﬁcation of
equivalence properties, encompassing both theoretical and
practical aspects. We provide tight complexity results for
static equivalence, trace equivalence and labelled bisimilar-
ity, summarised in ﬁg. 1. In particular we show that deciding
trace equivalence and labelled bisimilarity for a bounded
number of sessions is coNEXP complete for subterm con-
vergent destructor rewrite systems. Finally, we implement
our procedure in the DEEPSEC prototype. As demonstrated
through an extensive benchmark (ﬁg. 7), our tool is broad
in scope and efﬁcient compared to other tools.
Our work opens several directions for future work. First,
we wish to lift the restriction of subterm convergent equa-
tional theories. Even though the problem becomes quickly
undecidable for more general rewrite theories, we plan to
design a partially correct, i.e., sound, complete, but not nec-
essarily terminating, procedure, as the procedure underlying
the AKISS tool [19]. Second, we plan to avoid the restriction
to destructor rewrite systems to more general ones. From the
complexity point of view we envision to study parametrised
complexity (taking the rewrite system, or the degree of non-
determinism as a parameter). This may increase our under-
standing of which parts of the input are responsible of the
high complexity, and guide further optimisations. We have
seen that the POR techniques have dramatically increased
the tool’s performances on action-determinate processes. We
wish to develop similar techniques for more general classes
of processes.
