## Abstract
Low-power networked devices, such as sensors and actuators, are becoming increasingly important in our everyday infrastructure. As these devices are networked, their continued development requires significant contributions from the networking community. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework for the simulation, experimentation, and evaluation of routing mechanisms in low-power IPv6 networks. The framework provides a detailed simulation environment for low-power routing mechanisms and allows the system to be directly uploaded to a physical testbed for experimental measurements.

## 1. Introduction
The use of low-power networked devices, such as battery-powered sensors and actuators, is on the rise in various sectors, including industrial automation, home automation, automated electric meter reading, and smart grid systems. Industry leaders like Cisco and Ericsson predict that these networks will grow to billions of devices over the next decade. Given the critical role of low-power networked devices in our infrastructure, it is essential that the networking community engages in developing and evaluating network mechanisms for these devices.

To leverage existing systems and protocols, the community has adopted IP as the network platform. IPv6 has been chosen over IPv4 to accommodate a large number of devices. Recent work in the wireless sensor network (WSN) community has demonstrated that IPv6 can be used even in challenging and severely power- and memory-constrained wireless networks [1, 2]. Achieving low-power operation requires nodes to keep their radio transceivers off as much as possible while turning them on frequently enough to forward traffic. This is achieved through a duty-cycling mechanism operating below the IP layer.

Industrial adoption necessitates standardization, and to standardize routing for low-power and lossy IPv6 networks, the IETF ROLL working group has developed the RPL protocol [3, 4]. Since the requirements and characteristics of emerging low-power networks vary widely, RPL does not define specific routing metrics, path costs, or forwarding policies. Instead, RPL leaves these aspects open, allowing different networks to apply different mechanisms to meet specific objectives, such as minimizing latency or energy consumption. However, selecting appropriate forwarding policies, path costs, and routing metrics remains an open problem.

## 2. Framework
We present a framework for the simulation, experimentation, and evaluation of routing mechanisms in networks of low-power devices. Our framework consists of three main components:

1. **Contiki Operating System:** Runs on individual sensor nodes.
2. **Cooja/MSPsim Network Simulation:** Provides cycle-accurate emulation of node software and bit-level accurate simulation of low-power radio networking.
3. **ContikiRPL Implementation:** Allows replaceable routing objective functions.

Parts of our framework, such as the Contiki operating system and its µIPv6 IP stack, are already widely used in the industry. The workflow of the system involves implementing and studying routing objective functions in the simulator, then transferring them to a physical testbed with actual sensor network motes. This process is illustrated in Figure 1.

Our framework enables the study of routing mechanisms in both simulation and real-world settings. The simulation includes node-level details, such as the effects of transceiver duty cycling, providing insights into low-level phenomena that affect real-world performance. The experimental system offers a software-based power profiling mechanism for power measurements. This workflow is not feasible with traditional network simulators like ns-2 or Omnet++, which require routing mechanisms to be developed explicitly for the simulation environment. Similarly, traditional WSN simulators like TinyOS TOSSIM do not provide the level of detail needed to capture the effects of radio duty cycling.

### 2.1 Node Operating System
Our framework utilizes the Contiki operating system, a widely used OS for low-power wireless devices. Contiki includes µIPv6, a full IPv6 stack certified under the IPv6 Ready program [1]. µIPv6 provides a comprehensive API for programming protocols using UDP, TCP, or ICMPv6. To achieve low-power operation, Contiki offers a set of radio duty cycling mechanisms, including variants of Low-Power Listening (LPL) and Low-Power Probing (LPP).

### 2.2 Routing with ContikiRPL
ContikiRPL is the primary IPv6 routing protocol in Contiki. RPL is a distance-vector protocol designed for IPv6 networks comprising low-power devices connected by lossy links. The protocol maintains Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) topologies toward root nodes, built proactively according to an objective function. RPL's flexibility in forming topologies and selecting next-hops for individual packets makes it suitable for multiple types of deployments and link-layers. Routing decisions are made by the objective function, which specifies the constraints and metrics used in the network.

The primary goal of ContikiRPL is to provide a versatile yet simple programming interface for researchers to study objective functions. While the logic for exchanging routing control messages is largely specified in IETF drafts, the area of objective functions remains relatively unexplored and requires input from the research community.

### 2.3 Network Simulator
The Cooja/MSPsim network simulation provides cycle-accurate simulation of individual devices and bit-level accurate simulation of their radio transceivers. This feature allows the same binaries to run in the simulator and on actual hardware. The simulator offers various radio models for simulating at different levels of detail.

The simulator includes several visualizer modules. Figure 2 shows a network visualizer and a timeline visualizer. The network visualizer displays the paths selected by the routing protocol and routing statistics for each node. The timeline visualizer indicates when the devices' radio transceivers are turned on or off, enabling users to visually inspect the low-power operation and its implications, such as collisions.

## 3. Demonstration
We demonstrate four key aspects of our system:

1. **Simulation Environment and Visualizers:** Show the network and timeline visualizers.
2. **Low-Power IPv6 Operation in Contiki:** Illustrate the low-power operation in the Contiki operating system.
3. **Adding New Routing Objective Functions to ContikiRPL:** Explain how new routing objective functions can be added to ContikiRPL.
4. **Uploading to a Remote Testbed:** Demonstrate how the resulting system can be directly uploaded to a remote testbed consisting of Tmote Sky motes.

The demonstration highlights the impact of choosing different routing objective functions. One function uses a simple hop count, while another uses expected transmissions (ETX) for forwarding decisions. By running these two objective functions in the simulator and a remote testbed, the results show that the simple hop-count function results in shorter path lengths but at the expense of higher power consumption.
