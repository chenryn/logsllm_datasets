User: I am very new to linux, and i want to learn scripting. It seems like there are quite a few options to learn about scripting from bash shell scripting, python, perl lisp, and probably more that i dont know about. I am just wonder what are the  the advantage and disadvantage of all of them, and what would be a good place to start?
Assistant: Every programmer will have a biased answer to this, but one thing to keep in mind is what your goal is.  For instance, if you're only looking to be a successful sysadmin, then your goals might best be served by learning languages that are more conducive to sysadmin tasks (e.g. bash).  However, if you're looking to do more general programming, including data analysis, you might be better served focusing your study on more general-purpose languages like Python or Perl.  For web development, Ruby might be worth studying, etc.   It really depends on why you're interested in learning scripting.
If you don't really have a specific reason and are looking for general advice, it's probably wise to start with one language and get proficient at it and then expand to other languages.  The canonical path would probably be bash --> Python, these days.   Of course, this is just one person's opinion. :-)
