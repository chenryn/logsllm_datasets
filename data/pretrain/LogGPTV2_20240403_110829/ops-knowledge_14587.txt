User: Please design a distributed system based on the RESTful API architecture, including the architecture and technology selection of the front-end, back-end and database parts.
Assistant: First, the RESTful API architecture is an architecture based on the HTTP protocol, resources, and state. Therefore, a distributed system needs to follow the following principles: 1. Resource identifier: Each resource has a unique identifier, which can be used to access the resource. 2. Resource state conversion: realize resource state conversion through HTTP verbs, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. 3. Self-describing messages: Every HTTP request and response should contain enough information to describe the content of the request and response. Based on the above principles, the architecture of the distributed system can be designed as follows: 1. The front-end adopts React.js as the page framework, and calls the back-end interface through the RESTful API to realize data interaction. 2. The backend adopts Spring Boot as the development framework, and uses the MVC pattern to realize the processing of business logic. 3. The database uses MySQL as a relational database. The specific implementation method is as follows: 1. Front-end page part: The front-end uses React.js as the page framework, and calls the back-end interface through the RESTful API to realize data interaction. The Ant Design component library is used to realize the construction of the UI interface. 2. Back-end part: The back-end uses Spring Boot as the development framework, and uses the MVC model to implement business logic processing. The specific implementation is as follows: 1) Controller layer: use the @RestController annotation to realize the functions of the controller layer. 2) Service layer: Use the @Service annotation to realize the functions of the service layer and realize specific business logic processing. 3) Data access layer: The MyBatis framework is used to realize the function of the data access layer and realize the interaction with the MySQL database. 3. Database part: The database uses MySQL as a relational database, and uses a relational data model to store data. To sum up, the above is a distributed system architecture design and technology selection based on the RESTful API architecture. This architecture enables rapid system development, has good scalability and maintainability, and is suitable for small and medium-sized enterprises or start-ups.
