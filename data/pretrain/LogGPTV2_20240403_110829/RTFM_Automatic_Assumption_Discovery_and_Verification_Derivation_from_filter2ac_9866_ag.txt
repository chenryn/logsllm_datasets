the user parameter
is of
returned by
type pcap_dumper_t as
The returned string must be freed with dbus_free().
This function is deprecated on the grounds that it is stupid.
dbus_message_get_sender returns the unique name of the sender or NULL
We recommend always setting the timeout to a non-zero value unless immediate mode is set,
in which case the timeout has no effect.
pcap_dispatch() returns the number of packets processed on success; this can be 0 if no pack-
ets were read from a live capture or if no more packets are available in a savefile. It returns
PCAP_ERROR if an error occurs or PCAP_ERROR_BREAK if the loop terminated due to a call
to pcap_breakloop() before any packets were processed.
This interface is obsoleted by pcap_findalldevs.
If called directly,
pcap_dump_open().
If there is an error, or if pcap_init() has been called, NULL is returned and errbuf is filled in
with an appropriate error message.
pcap_create() and pcap_activate() were not available in versions of libpcap prior to 1.0
you should use a non-zero timeout
The list of devices must be freed with pcap_freealldevs(), which frees the list pointed to by
alldevs.
The list of devices must be freed with pcap_freealldevs(), which frees the list pointed to by
alldevs.
you must use or copy the string before closing the pcap_t.
The list of devices must be freed with pcap_freealldevs(), which frees the list pointed to by
alldevs.
pcap_list_datalinks() returns the number of link-layer header types in the array on success,
PCAP_ERROR_NOT_ACTIVATED if called on a capture handle that has been created but not
activated, and PCAP_ERROR on other errors.
resources associated with the database connection handle should be released by passing it to
sqlite3_close() when it is no longer required.
The calling procedure is responsible for deleting the compiled SQL statement using
sqlite3_finalize() after it has finished with it
The sqlite3_config() interface may only be invoked prior to library initialization using
sqlite3_initialize() or after shutdown by sqlite3_shutdown().
To avoid memory leaks, the application should invoke sqlite3_free() on error message strings
returned through the 5th parameter of sqlite3_exec() after the error message string is no longer
needed.
It‚Äôs up to the caller to free the memory with xmlFree().
It‚Äôs up to the caller to free the memory with xmlFree().
EVP_PKEY_CTX_new(), EVP_PKEY_CTX_new_id(), EVP_PKEY_CTX_dup() returns either
the newly allocated EVP_PKEY_CTX structure or NULL if an error occurred.
BIO_reset() normally returns 1 for success and 0 or -1 for failure.
X509_get_notBefore() and X509_get_notAfter() were deprecated in OpenSSL 1.1.0
to must point to RSA_size(rsa) bytes of memory.
EVP_VerifyFinal() returns 1 for a correct signature, 0 for failure and -1 if some other error
occurred.
The functions return 1 for a successful match, 0 for a failed match and -1 for an internal error:
typically a memory allocation failure or an ASN.1 decoding error.
They returned internal pointers that must not be freed by the application program.
The length of ASN1_STRING_to_UTF8_APIParam_1 is returned or a negative error code
The X509 object must be explicitly freed using X509_free().
RAND_pseudo_bytes() was deprecated in OpenSSL 1.1.0
to must point to RSA_size(rsa) bytes of memory.
EVP_PKEY_assign_RSA(), EVP_PKEY_assign_DSA(), EVP_PKEY_assign_DH(), EVP_PKEY_a
ssign_EC_KEY(), EVP_PKEY_assign_POLY1305() and EVP_PKEY_assign_SIPHASH() return 1
for success and 0 for failure.
