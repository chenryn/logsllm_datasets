denominations for v. The Tumbler has a Deposit method,
where users deposit Ether into the contract, and then send
an issuance request to authorities on one private attribute:
addr||s, where addr is the destination address of the merchant,
and s is a randomly generated sequence number (1). It is
necessary for addr to be a part of the attribute because once the
attribute is revealed, the credential can be spent by anyone with
knowledge of the attribute (including any peers monitoring the
blockchain for transactions), therefore the credential must be
bounded to a speciﬁc recipient address before it is revealed.
This issuance request is signed by the Ethereum address that
deposited the Ether into the smart contract, as proof that the
request is associated with a valid deposit, and sent to the
authorities (2). As addr and s will be both revealed at the
same time when withdrawing the token, we concatenate these
in one attribute to save on elliptic curve operations. Users
aggregate the credentials issued by the authorities (3). The
resulting token can then be passed to the Withdraw function,
where the withdrawer reveals addr and s (4). As usual, the
contract maintains a map of s values associated with tokens
that have already been withdrawn to prevent double-spending.
After checking that the token’s credentials veriﬁes and that
it has not already been spent, the contract sends v to the
Ethereum destination address addr (5).
