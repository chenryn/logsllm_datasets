that the majority of subdomains associated with the top domains
have VM or ELB front ends. Of those using ELB front ends, ama-
zon.com and fc2.com use ELB the most (i.e., there are more phys-
ical ELB IPs associated with these domains). Three of the top do-
mains have subdomains which use a CDN, but only one of these
domains uses the CloudFront CDN.
Summary and implications. In summary, we ﬁnd that the major-
ity (71.5%) of EC2-using subdomains use a VM front end (deploy-
ment pattern P1); hence most EC2 tenants are using EC2 as a true
IaaS cloud. Only a small fraction use an ELB front end (3.8%) or
PaaS front end (8.5%). Due to limited use, failures of value-added
features are unlikely to have a major impact on EC2-using subdo-
mains. In Azure, we are able to identify the usage of VM, PaaS, or
load balancing front ends (we cannot distinguish which) for 70%
of subdomains. A small fraction (1.5%) of Azure-using domains

Table 9: EC2 and Azure region usage Alexa subdomains
leverage TM to balance trafﬁc across different front ends. The ma-
jority of DNS servers used by cloud-using subdomains reside out-
side of EC2 or Azure, giving subdomains the option of routing traf-
ﬁc to different resources (in another cloud or a private data center)
in the event of cloud failure.
4.2 Region Usage
EC2 and Azure give tenants the choice of using one or more
geographically distinct regions (i.e., data centers). Regions provide
a mechanism for robustness in the case of catastrophic failures, e.g.,
regional power or service outages [4, 6, 24, 35].
In this section,
we examine how many, and which, of the eight regions offered by
each cloud provider are leveraged by the front ends of cloud-using
(sub)domains.
We ascertain the region(s) used by each subdomain in the Alexa
subdomains dataset by comparing the IP addresses associated with
that subdomain against the per-region IP address ranges published
by EC2 [12] and Azure [8]. We only consider IPs associated with
VM, PaaS, and ELB/TM.
Figure 6a shows a CDF (note the Y-axis starts at 90%) of the
number of regions used by each subdomain in the Alexa subdo-
mains. Over 97% of EC2-using and 92% of Azure-using subdo-
mains exclusively use one region. Across all domains (Figure 6b),
the trend of low region usage is largely the same, although, the
fraction of Azure-using domains that only use one region (83%) is
smaller than the fraction of subdomains that only use one region
(92%).
The number of (sub)domains (from the Alexa subdomains) in
each region are shown in Table 9. We observe that the usage of
EC2 regions is heavily skewed towards a few regions: 74% of EC2-
using subdomains use US East and 16% use Europe West. Azure,
relatively speaking, has a more even distribution of subdomains
across regions, but each region has signiﬁcantly fewer subdomains.
The most used Azure regions are US South and US North.
Analysis of top domains. We now focus on region usage of subdo-
mains corresponding to the most popular (according to Alexa rank-
ings) domains. Our analysis is summarized in Table 10. As with
the rest of our results above, we see that in all but two cases, subdo-
mains appear to use a single region. The exceptions are msn.com
and microsoft.com, where 11 of the 89 subdomains and 4 of 11
subdomains, respectively, use two regions each. No popular subdo-
main uses three or more regions. We also note that in some cases, a
domain may deploy different subdomains across different regions:
e.g., live.com’s 18 subdomains are spread across 3 regions. Con-

Table 10: Region usage for the top cloud-using domains. The third
column is the number of cloud-using subdomains; fourth is the total
number of regions used by a domain; and the k = 1 and k =
2 columns are the number of subdomains which use one or two
regions, respectively.
trarily, there are domains whose subdomains are all deployed in one
region (e.g., pinterest.com).
Analysis of subdomain deployment vs. customer location. An
interesting question about cloud service deployment is whether sub-
domains are deployed near their customers? The answer to this
question reveals whether current cloud services are deployed in an
“optimal” manner, because deploying a service near customers usu-
ally leads to better client network performance (lower latency and
higher throughput).
To answer this question, we leverage the client geo-location in-
formation provided by the Alexa web information service [2]. For
example, at the time of writing, Alexa reported that 47% of clients
accessing pinterest.com are from the United States, 10.4% from In-
dia, 3.2% from the United Kingdom, 3.1% from Canada, and 2.1%
from Brazil. For each domain, we deﬁne the “customer country”
as the country where the largest fraction of clients are located. We
assume the customer country is the same for all of a website’s sub-
domains, as Alexa does not track subdomains separately. For in-
stance, the United States is the customer country for pinterest.com
(and its subdomains) based on our deﬁnition.
We performed the analysis for all of the cloud-using subdomains
(about 713K) in our dataset. Our measurement methodology was
able to successfully identify approximately 538K (75% of the to-
tal) subdomains’ customer country. We ﬁnd that 252K (47%) sub-
domains’ customer country is not the same as the country where
this subdomain is hosted. Moreover, 174K (32%) subdomains are
not even hosted on the same continent as the subdomains’ customer
country. This implies that a large fraction of web services are prob-

ably not deployed in an optimal manner in terms of network per-
formance. We suspect that the current deployment posture is af-
fected by computing, storage, and network costs and/or how long
the cloud region has existed. In §5, we explore how much opportu-
nity exists for improving wide-area performance through changes
in region usage.
Summary and implications. Our key ﬁnding in this section is that
most popular domains and subdomains appear to be using a sin-
gle region. This has signiﬁcant implications on both the robustness
and performance of cloud-using web services. From an availability
perspective, an outage of EC2’s US East region would take down
critical components of at least 2.3% of the domains (61% of EC2-
using domains) on Alexa’s list of the top 1 million websites. This
is a lower bound, as our results do not include dependencies be-
tween domains. From a performance perspective, our analysis of
web service deployment and customer locations reveals that a con-
siderable fraction of client trafﬁc may travel farther than necessary
due to suboptimal provisioning.
4.3 Availability Zone Usage
Within each region of EC2, cloud tenants have the choice of de-
ploying across multiple zones. EC2 zones offer a means for im-
proving service robustness as they are claimed to use separate com-
pute, network, and power infrastructure so that a failure in any of
these will not affect more than one zone. There seems to be no
equivalent of zones in Azure.
We now focus on determining the zone deployment for EC2-
using services’ front ends. Unlike the regions, which are easily dis-
tinguished based on the IP address of a subdomain and the adver-
tised ranges [8,12], there is no direct way to associate an IP address
to a zone. We therefore turn to cloud cartography techniques [34].
We use two methods to identify zones: network latency and prox-
imity in the internal addresses to instances with a known zone (i.e.,
VMs we launched).
Latency-based identiﬁcation. The ﬁrst technique (originally used
in [34]) aims to estimate whether a target physical instance (e.g.,
VM instance, physical ELB instance, etc.) is in the same zone as
an instance under our control by measuring the RTT to the target.
The RTT will be signiﬁcantly smaller when both instances are in
the same zone, compared to when they are in different zones, pre-
sumably reﬂecting a longer path in the latter case. We performed a
simple experiment to conﬁrm that RTTs follow this trend. We setup
an m1.micro instance in the ec2.us-east-1a zone and measured the
RTT (over 10 trials) to one instance of each type in each of the three
zones ec2.us-east-1a, ec2.us-east-1c, and ec2.us-east-1d. Table 11
shows both the minimum and median RTTs. It is clear that the in-
stances in the same availability zone have the smallest RTTs (about
0.5ms) regardless of the instance type. We repeated this experiment
in each of the EC2 regions with similar results.
Our experiment corroborates similar previous ones [34] regard-
ing the efﬁcacy of latency-based zone estimates. However, there
are several complicating factors when attempting to deploy this
