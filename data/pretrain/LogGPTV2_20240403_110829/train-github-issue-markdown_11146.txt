# Feature request
## Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
I was excited to see a static site generator in Next. I want to write a
prototype of a site, which would end up using Next. I'd love the prototype to
be static so I can zip it up and send to someone who isn't tech savvy unzip
and run the html. The issue is that someone needs to make the html run on
"server" ie `serve`
## Describe the solution you'd like
Allow an option for `next export` which lets things run without a server. As
far as I can tell the main issue is the way things are routed, followed by the
way clicking `` is counted.
## Describe alternatives you've considered
I tried detecting an environment variable to do an update like this:
`correctedHref = `file:///C:${prefix}${href}/index.html`
That made the `href=` point at an actual file, however clicking the link did
nothing in the app, despite opening the link via source view showing what I
wanted.
