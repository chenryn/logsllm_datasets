**Feature Request: Route Configuration Data**

**Background**
In the deprecated Router v3, it was possible to add additional data to a route configuration, as shown in the following example:

```typescript
@RouteConfig([
  { path: '/about', component: AboutComponent, name: 'About', data: { title: 'About Us' } }
])
```

This allowed for generic operations when activating the route, such as setting the page title using a Title service. It would be beneficial to reintroduce this functionality.

**Reproduction of the Problem**
If the current behavior is a bug or if you can better illustrate your feature request with an example, please provide the steps to reproduce and, if possible, a minimal demo via https://plnkr.co or a similar platform. You can use this template as a starting point: http://plnkr.co/edit/tpl:AvJOMERrnz94ekVua0u5.

**Expected Behavior**
The ability to add custom data to route configurations, which can then be accessed and used for various purposes, such as setting the page title.

**Motivation / Use Case**
Adding custom data to route configurations allows for more flexible and dynamic routing. This can be particularly useful for setting up metadata, such as page titles, SEO tags, or any other context-specific information that needs to be available when a route is activated.

**Environment Details**
- **Angular Version:** 2.0.0-rc.X
- **Browser:** [all | Chrome XX | Firefox XX | IE XX | Safari XX | Mobile Chrome XX | Android X.X Web Browser | iOS XX Safari | iOS XX UIWebView | iOS XX WKWebView ]
- **Language:** [all | TypeScript X.X | ES6/7 | ES5 | Dart]
