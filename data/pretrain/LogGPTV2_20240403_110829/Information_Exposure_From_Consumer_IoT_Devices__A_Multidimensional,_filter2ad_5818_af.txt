actions taken when the user navigates to the “menu”. We do not
consider this unexpected or suspicious.
The “move” activities are sometimes triggered when there is no
movement in front of a camera and/or movement sensor. In the
case of a camera, the device records a video when it is not triggered
by movement, which is both unexpected and potentially suspicious.
We do not have a root cause for this behavior. A possibility is that
despite our best efforts to isolate each camera from external stimuli,
there is nonetheless something in the lab that is triggering them
(e.g., background noise from other IoT devices). Another possibility
is that the devices capture such video intentionally.
We could not identify root causes for the remaining, rarer, cases
of detected activity. As with any inference technique, ours is poten-
tially subject to false positives and false negatives. Combined with
our lack of ground truth, we cannot say for certain whether these
cases are unexpected or suspicious.
By comparing the US and UK columns

of Table 11 we can see both similarities and differences in detected
behavior from idle experiments. Differences in power experiments
(such as the Sous Vide Cooker) are explained by different reliability
of the Wi-Fi in the two labs (confirmed using DHCP logs). However,
we could not identify root causes for other differences, and might
be due to non-determinism among common devices across the labs.
There is a noticeable difference in results when using a VPN
egress, particularly smart speakers (both from Amazon and from
Google) and one of the cameras (Wansview). While we were unable
to identify a root cause for these differences, it is an interesting
area for future work.

vulnerability to MITM attacks for encrypted traffic. Jia et al. [19]
find weaknesses communication channels between devices and
companion apps, and between those entities and their cloud ser-
vice. Sivaraman et al. [43] measure encryption and authentication
protocol weaknesses on a set of 24 devices.
7.3 Uncontrolled Experiments
We use the same approach to analyze six months of data from
our uncontrolled experiments generated as part of our user study
in the US testbed. Most of the detected activities correspond to
interactions that we confirm are popular/commonplace in our lab
(e.g., using the microwave, opening/closing the fridge, moving in
the lab). However, due to the large numbers of detected activities
in such categories, it is difficult to manually verify them all.
Instead we focus on the most sensitive and unexpected activities
flagged by our classifier, then manually attempted to trigger the
same (unexpected) behavior. We describe the most interesting cases
observed below.
Ring doorbell. We observed that the Ring doorbell performs a
video recording action every time a user moves in front of it. How-
ever, this is unexpected behavior: the app used to set up the device
does not warn the user that the doorbell performs such recording in
real time, the doorbell offers no indication that recording is occur-
ring, and the only disclosure is in fine print as part of the privacy
policy [38]. Upon discovering this barely documented feature, we
logged into our account to see the video, and learned that we must
pay an additional monthly fee to access such recordings. We have
not identified any way to turn off this feature.
The Zmodo doorbell uploads camera snap-
Zmodo doorbell.
shots when the device is first turned on, and also when anyone
moves in front of the device. This feature is undocumented, and we
were unable to prevent such snapshots from being taken, nor we
were able to access them.
A number of our user study participants
Alexa voice assistant.
complained that Alexa-enabled devices are frequently triggered dur-
ing normal conversations, as if the keyword had been spoken. Upon
investigation, we found that the default Alexa wake-up keyword
“Alexa” is frequently triggered by many other unrelated words—
much more so than the other voice assistants in our testbeds. A
notable example is a sentence beginning with “I like [s-word]” such
as “I like Star Trek." We understand that this may be a limitation
of voice recognition technology, but it is still a potential privacy
exposure since Amazon devices typically recognize false activations
after sending the whole sentence to their servers (i.e., after such
sentence has been permanently stored).
7.4 Takeaways
While we can only rarely positively identify unexpected behav-
ior, such cases certainly exist, and we identified many cases by
observing idle traffic. We further found notable cases of devices
unexpectedly sending audio or video in our uncontrolled exper-
iments. Our findings highlight that concerns about information
exposed by IoT devices is warranted, as is further investigation into
more accurate device-activity classifiers and the root causes for the
inferred behavior.
8 RELATED WORK
We now review work related to IoT information exposure.
Prior efforts characterize IoT traffic

from different points of view. Several focus whether encryption is
used, and if so, how it is misused. Alrawi et al. [3] analyze traffic
from 45 consumer IoT devices to identify unencrypted traffic and
Amar et al. [4] characterize network traffic for a handful of
home IoT devices in a idle state. Sivaraman et al. [42] characterize
destinations as first party and third parties, and identify protocols
used by a set of 28 devices. The IoT Inspector tool [1] visualizes and
characterizes volumes and destinations of IoT traffic on the same
IP network.
Our study extends prior work by considering significantly more
devices (81), devices that are usually ignored due to their size and
cost (e.g., large appliances such as fridge, TV, washer and dryer),
large number of experiments (34,586) due to our high level of au-
tomation, and our regional analysis across two testbeds located in
different privacy jurisdictions.
Unexpected behavior can

more generally be classified as anomaly detection, a topic of signifi-
cant prior work. Prior work focuses on intrusion detection systems
that detect attacks by using device search engines [40], vulnerability
repositories [46], and machine learning to identify known and un-
known devices [20, 22, 29, 33, 42, 45]. Alternatively, related work fo-
cuses on a policy enforcement approach to detecting anomalies. For
example, the recent Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) [24]
IETF standard proposal allows manufacturers and other parties
to specify the expected behavior for IoT devices. Ongoing work
addresses the problem of automatically verifying and/or enforcing
the compliance of a given IoT device according to its specification,
as a means to detect and block unexpected behavior [14–16]. Other
approaches for detecting unexpected behavior use machine learn-
ing and other statistical techniques on the device traffic to infer
the type of the IoT devices and their activities, and to profile their
users [2, 41, 44]. Our contribution on unexpected behavior detec-
tion is inspired by these last approaches, but our machine learning
approach uniquely considers interaction method (e.g., the use of
the device locally vs through its companion app vs through a voice
assistant) and includes larger numbers of training experiments.
Other relevant work. Other related work tackles information ex-
posure for different categories of IoT devices: home/office consumer
devices [5, 27], medical devices [49], smart toys [10, 39, 47] as well
as home automation solutions [26, 31]. Several companies offer
commercial solutions to address security issues in IoT, including
privacy exposure [6–8, 11, 12, 17, 18, 21, 28, 30, 34]; however, as
closed solutions little is known about their approach and effective-
ness.
To summarize, our work shares many of the goals and techniques
proposed in prior traffic characterization and anomaly detection
work; however, our primary and differentiating goal is to increase
the scale, experimental rigor, and geographic diversity of such anal-
yses. We accomplish this goal by analyzing a broader range of
devices over different geographic locations and privacy jurisdic-
tions, broader range of interactions/experiments, and supplement
controlled experimental data with uncontrolled experiments from a
6-month of naturally occurring user interactions with our devices.
Information Exposure From Consumer IoT Devices
IMC ’19, October 21–23, 2019, Amsterdam, Netherlands
9 CONCLUSION
Using the largest known set of controlled experiments (34,586)
comprising 81 devices in the US and UK, along with uncontrolled
experiments consisting of an IRB-approved user study, we are the
first to quantify such information exposure across different net-
works, geographic regions, and interactions with devices.
We observe several promising practices: most of the devices use
encryption or other encodings that protect users’ PII, thus resulting
in an overall minimal PII exposure in plaintext. However, even if
the traffic is encrypted and without relying on MITM or any kind
of IoT device modification, our analysis identifies notable cases of
information exposure: 57.45 % (50.27 %) of the overall destinations
contacted by the US (UK) IoT devices are third or support parties,
and 56 % of the US devices and the 83.8 % of the UK devices contact
destinations outside their region. We further find significant frac-
tions of traffic use encryption or are otherwise unclassified, while
for most devices plaintext traffic is rare (with notable exceptions),
we also identify that encryption does not hide the kinds of interac-
tions that cause a device to generate network traffic, in many cases
allowing an eavesdropper to infer devices in consumer network and
how they are used. We identify unexpected activity from devices
that capture audio and video, and we find several notable cases
where exposure differs based on the location. This study is a first
step toward understanding information exposure by consumer IoT
devices at scale. To facilitate analysis and reproducibility at even
larger scales, our experiment infrastructure, code, and data are
publicly available at https://github.com/NEU-SNS/intl-iot.
