User:  What is the difference between problem management and incident management?
Assistant: Problem management and incident management are two different practices, although there are some similarities between them. Problem management aims to minimize the negative impact on the service provided by identifying and analyzing the root causes of incidents. Incident management is another practice aimed at quickly responding to and resolving incidents that have occurred to minimize their impact on business operations. While both practices involve identifying and solving problems, they have slightly different focuses and goals.
