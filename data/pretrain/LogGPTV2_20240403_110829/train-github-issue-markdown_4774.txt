### Proposal for Automatic Window Zoning

#### Feature Description
We propose the implementation of a feature that automatically moves newly opened windows into predefined zones. This functionality would enhance user productivity and streamline window management.

#### Rule Application
- **Trigger Conditions:**
  - When a new window is opened.
  - By using a shortcut key.

- **Rule Criteria:**
  - Process name
  - Window title
  - Other relevant attributes (e.g., window size, type, etc.)

#### Rule Management
- **Enable/Disable Rules:**
  - Users should have the ability to enable or disable specific rules as needed.

- **Import/Export Layout:**
  - The layout, including all associated rules, should support import and export functionalities. This will allow users to easily transfer their settings between different systems or share them with others.

#### Summary
This feature will provide a more organized and efficient workspace by automatically placing windows into designated zones based on customizable rules. The flexibility to enable, disable, and transfer these rules will further enhance the user experience.
