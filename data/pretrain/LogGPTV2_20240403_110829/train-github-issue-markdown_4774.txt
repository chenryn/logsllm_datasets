# Possibility to setup rules for automatic moving windows in to zones.
I think it might be a useful feature when newly opened window will be moved in
to defined zone automatically. The rules for automatic moving can be applied
based on process name (and/or window title, etc).  
The rules can be applied when window is opened or by shortcut.  
The rules can be disabled/enabled.  
The layout should support import/export with all rules.
