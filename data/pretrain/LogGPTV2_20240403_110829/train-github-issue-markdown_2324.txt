Apologies if this is the wrong place to ask the question, but I thought it
might be better to have this explained somewhere that wasn't as ephemeral as
the IRC channelâ€¦
Storing an instance and trying to reuse it results in an error:
    Can only mount an unmounted component. Make sure to avoid storing components between renders or reusing a single component instance in multiple places.
Recently, I started wondering, if these are just descriptors, why is that
desired behavior? Or is it a concession for the sake of performance? It seems
like there are some good reasons (memoization, worry-free duplication, etc)
why it would be preferable for React not to mutate them so they could be
reused.
Thanks!
