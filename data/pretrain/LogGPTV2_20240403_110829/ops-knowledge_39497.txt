I recently installed PyDev 1.5.3 on an EasyEclipse 1.3.1 setup, with the intention of integrating the combined version of PyDev Extensions into the core PyDev. However, after the installation, I noticed that comparison operations such as "Compare with > Base revision" ceased to function properly. To resolve this issue, I had to disable PyDev 1.5.3 and revert to the pre-installed PyDev 1.3.13, which is part of the EasyEclipse 1.3.1 distribution.

Has anyone else encountered a similar problem? Are there any known workarounds for this issue?

In my experience, PyDev 1.5.3 also caused significant issues, rendering it unusable. I had to downgrade to a previous version using `yum downgrade eclipse-pydev` and configure my system to prevent automatic updates to this package.
