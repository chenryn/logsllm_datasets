### Title: Measuring the Speed of the Red Queen's Race: Adaptation and Evasion in Malware

Security is a perpetual cat-and-mouse game between those who strive to detect novel malware and the authors who attempt to evade detection. The integration of statistical methods and machine learning into this arms race allows us to explore an intriguing question: How rapidly is malware being updated in response to the pressure exerted by security practitioners?

The effectiveness of machine learning models in detecting malware is well-established. We introduce a novel technique that leverages trained models to measure "concept drift" in malware samples over time. This approach helps us track changes as old campaigns are retired, new campaigns are introduced, and existing campaigns are modified.

By employing both simple distance-based metrics and Fisher Information measures, we analyze the evolution of the threat landscape over time, revealing some surprising findings. In conjunction with this presentation, we will release the PyTorch-based tools we have developed to address this question, enabling attendees to investigate concept drift within their own datasets.
