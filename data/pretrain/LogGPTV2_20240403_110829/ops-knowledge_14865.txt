Question: "A developer is generating a hash for the Subresource Integrity attribute of a script that will be loaded from a CDN. The developer executes the following command:

$ curl -s https://cdn.example.com/library.js | openssl dgst -sha384 -binary | openssl base64 -A

Which of the following statements is a valid critique of this process?"
 "A": "Using the 'curl' command is not recommended because it cannot retrieve script files reliably from CDNs."
 "B": "The process is incorrect; the developer should use a different hashing algorithm, not SHA-384, for generating the integrity hash."
 "C": "The command correctly chains the retrieval of the script content with the generation of a SHA-384 base64-encoded hash, suitable for the integrity attribute."
 "D": "The developer should directly download the file and manually compute the hash to ensure accuracy, rather than using command-line tools."
Answer: C
