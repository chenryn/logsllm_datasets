can be made. An attack is considered to succeed if any one of them
passes the authentication.
Table 5 shows the success rate of zero-eort attacks, which is
directly the FAR of our mechanism. According to the statistic results
shown in Figure 15, most of the beat-PINs, more than 95%, take
their lengths from 6 to 10. Hence, we conduct tests over beat-PINs
with their lengths falling within this range. Apparently, the beat-
PIN length plays a critical role in the attacker’s success rate. The
longer a beat-PIN, the stronger it is against zero-eort attacks.
Specically, when the length is 6, the success rate is 8.2%. When
the length becomes 8, only 1 attacker succeeds. Moreover, with the
length even longer, the success rate becomes 0. Therefore, in the

practical implementation of Beat-PIN, the system can impose a hard
constraint over a valid beat-PIN’s minimum length, say 8, to defeat
zero-eort attacks.
8.1.2
Shoulder Surfing Aacks. Shoulder surng [13, 23, 28, 31]
is a targeted attack leveraging the visual aspect of a certain spe-
cic user authentication method. There are two types of shoulder
surng attack: direct observation attack, in which authentication
information is obtained by an attacker who is directly monitoring
the authentication sequence, and recording attack, in which the
authentication information is obtained by recording the authenti-
cation process for later analysis. In the experiment, we evaluate
the robustness of Beat-PIN against the above two types of shoulder
surng attacks. We rst consider the mild one, in which attackers
learn a beat-PIN via direct visual observation. We grouped 20 volun-
teers into 10 pairs. Each of them was told to replay his/her partner’s
beat-PIN. Firstly, one user of the pair acts as an attacker, the other
one as a legitimate user, and then the roles are exchanged. During
the experiment, the legitimate user repeats the same beat-PIN for
three times and there is a pause in between. Then, the attacker
watches the entire process, acquires its rhythm information, and
tries to reproduce it. Every attacker makes three access attempts.
The attacker is considered to success in a shoulder surng if any
one of the three trials passes the authentication. In addition, we
also conduct a controlled experiment, to illustrate the errors and
bias in the experiment. Specically, this is captured by the FRR, i.e.,
the percentage that legitimate users’ beat-PINs get denied.
Figure 8(a) plots the attacker’s performance with respect to its
distance to the legitimate user. Specically, FAR represents the suc-
cess rate of shoulder surng. As shown in the gure, the success
rate decreases as the distance gets longer. This is intuitive, as a
shorter distance enables the attacker to have a closer observation
over the legitimate user’s login. Thus, it has a better chance to
correctly replay the genuine beat-PIN. Luckily, when the distance
is longer than 2 meters, this advantage diminishes. The result im-
plies that the rhythm is dicult to mimic through vague visual
observation. As a control measurement, we further show the FRR
of legitimate users in shoulder surng attack experiments. We ob-
serve that FRR keeps as low as 2.1% under all distance values, as the
distance does not eect the classication of legitimate beat-PINs.
More importantly, the result indicates that the experiment imposes
rather limited errors and bias toward the measurement over the
attacker’s performance. In particular, these errors and bias mainly
come from two factors, i.e., the error caused by our proposed vector
comparison based classication and the confusion caused by the
inconsistency when the legitimate user enters his/her beat-PIN in
dierent trials.
Figure 8(b) illustrates the impact of beat-PIN length to shoulder
surng attack. We have a similar observation as in zero-eort at-
tacks; it is more dicult to compromise a beat-PIN with a larger
length. Besides, together with Table 5, it tells that the adversary can
indeed leverage visual observation to assist the attack. However,
the advantage is limited. The FRR is also given for the purpose of
control measurement. The value is low, ranging from 3.2% with
the beat-PIN length as 6 to 1.8% with the length as 10. First of all,
it complies with the observation from Figure 8(a) that errors and
bias in our experiments are well conned. Besides, FRR experiences
a slight decrease as the beat-PIN length grows. This is because a
longer beat-PIN bears richer features to distinguish from others. As
a result, the chance that it is wrongly classied decreases.
The resistance performance of Beat-PIN to type-II shoulder surf-
ing attack is discussed in Appendix C.

8.1.3
Statistic Aacks. This type of attackers employ knowledge
obtained from the statistics of a group of users as hints to generate
authentication attempts. The basic approach is to estimate the
distribution of features from a group of users and then use the most
probable feature values to generate the forgery. In our case, we
use all samples from the 119 subjects collected from our phase-I
user study as the input. Hence, we estimate the worst situation
where the attacker has full knowledge about statistics of the whole
population. A forgery beat-PIN under statistic attacks is produced
in the following way. First, the beat-PIN length is randomly chosen
following the distribution obtained in Figure 15. Second, for each
beat-duration and space-duration, the value is randomly chosen
following the distribution given by Figure 16(c) and Figure 16(b),
respectively. We generate 10000 forgery beat-PINs to attack all the
119 legitimate ones. Performances on against statistic attacks are
given in Figure 9 by tuning parameters of the vector comparison
classier. The red dash line stands for the possible points where
FAR=FRR. The crossover of the red dash line and FAR-FRR curve is
exactly the location of the EER, which is 9.6%; when the attacker’s
success rate is 9.6%, the chance that a legitimate user is blocked is
9.6% as well. Although our system is slightly more vulnerable to
statistic attacks than zero-eort attacks, the attacker’s success rate

is still within an acceptable range. We’d like to point out that even
the recently proposed touch dynamics plus hand geometry based
authentication scheme [29] has its EER about 13%, which is higher
than ours.
From the above experiment results, we observe that Beat-PIN
is the most robust to zero-eort attacks. Besides, an adversary
does benet from mimicking the legitimate user’s login patterns
via visual observation or fabricating a synthetic one via statistic
analysis. Nonetheless, the benet is marginal.
8.2 Usability
Besides security, usability is another critical criteria in evaluating
the performance of a user authentication mechanism. We measure
the usability of Beat-PIN from aspects of time consumption, energy
consumption, impact of user motions, and memorability (Appen-
dix D). Moreover, we present a comprehensive survey result in
Appendix E based on volunteers’ feedbacks.
8.2.1 Enrollment Time and Login Time. We examine the enroll-
ment time and login time needed for Beat-PIN. Specically, the
former is the total duration for the user to provide training sam-
ples and for the system to derive the classier, while the latter is
the total duration for a user to enter a test beat-PIN and for the
system to make an authentication decision. These two parameters
directly determine Beat-PIN’s usage convenience. We depict in Fig-
ure 10(a) and Figure 10(b) the distribution of enrollment time and
login time, separately, according to our dataset. We observe that
the enrollment time spans from 5.0s to 23.1s, with its average value
as 12.3s. Besides, 90% of collected beat-PINs have their enrollment
time shorter than 17.4s. The login time spans from 0.6s to 3.6s, with
its average value as 1.7s. 90% of collected beat-PINs have their login
time shorter than 2.6s. Hence, the most time-consuming part is the
enrollment stage. Still, it can be performed within a relatively short
time.
We further compare the time consumption of Beat-PIN with some
recently proposed authentication schemes, which leverage “pattern”
[16], “gesture” [35], “graphical password” [15], “touch dynamics”
[30], and “touch dynamics+hand geometry” [29], in Table 6. Among
them, Beat-PIN has the lowest average enrollment time, because it
only takes 7 training samples. Besides, it ranks as the third among
all these schemes in terms of login time and is much faster than
“pattern”, “gesture”, and “graphical password” based authentications.
This is because these schemes apply some computationally complex

In conclusion, Beat-PIN is time-ecient during both enrollment
and login stage.

box) was carved out from the same smartwatch and used as

8.2.2 Energy Consumption. Typically, wearable devices have a
much shorter battery life compared with regular mobile devices.
As pointed out by [3], the battery life for Apple Watch Series 3
is about 18 hours after an overnight charge under normal use, in-
cluding 90 time checks, 90 notications, 45 minutes of app use,
and a 30-minute workout with music playback from Apple Watch
via Bluetooth. Therefore, it is desirable to design energy-ecient
authentication for wearable devices, especially with the fact that
users may access their wearables dozens of times every day. In
the in-eld experiments, we extensively test energy consumption
performances of Beat-PIN to validate its usability. Note that such
evaluation has been merely discussed in existing works on authen-
tication design for regular mobile devices, since their batteries can
easily last for a couple of days, rendering energy consumption a
less critical issue.
Due to the lack of software-based approaches for wearables
(although those for smartphones are available), such kind of study
has rarely been conducted so far [14, 17, 24, 25, 32, 34, 36]. To bridge
this gap, in this work we measure the precise power consumption
of our system using the dedicated hardware, the Monsoon power
monitor [7]. To facilitate the measurement, as shown in the red box

from the same smartwatch, and then used the interface circuit as
an adapter between the watch and the power monitor. During the
measurement, we kept other components oine (e.g., Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth).
