To add your Django apps directory (C:\My_Projects) to the `PYTHONPATH` so that you can call the apps directly, follow these steps:

1. **Locate the Environment Variables:**
   - Open the Start Menu and right-click on "This PC" or "Computer."
   - Select "Properties."
   - Click on "Advanced system settings."
   - In the System Properties window, click on the "Environment Variables" button.

2. **Edit the PYTHONPATH Variable:**
   - In the Environment Variables window, look for the `PYTHONPATH` variable in the "System variables" section.
   - If it does not exist, click on "New" to create it. Set the variable name to `PYTHONPATH`.
   - If it already exists, select it and click on "Edit."
   - Add the path `C:\My_Projects` to the existing value, ensuring that each path is separated by a semicolon (`;`). For example:
     ```
     C:\arcgis\bin;C:\My_Projects
     ```

3. **Save and Apply Changes:**
   - Click "OK" to close all the windows and apply the changes.

4. **Verify the Change:**
   - Open a new Command Prompt or PowerShell window and type:
     ```sh
     echo %PYTHONPATH%
     ```
   - Ensure that `C:\My_Projects` is included in the output.

5. **Test Your Setup:**
   - Try importing one of your Django apps to see if the `PYTHONPATH` change has taken effect. For example:
     ```python
     import coltrane
     ```

If you still encounter the error `No module named coltrane`, double-check the following:

- **Directory Structure:** Ensure that the `coltrane` module is correctly located within the `C:\My_Projects` directory.
- **File Naming:** Verify that the `coltrane` module has an `__init__.py` file if it is a package.
- **Python Version:** Make sure you are using the correct Python interpreter that has access to the updated `PYTHONPATH`.

For ArcGIS Desktop and ArcPy, the `PYTHONPATH` should also include the ArcGIS bin directory, typically `C:\arcgis\bin`. If this was not set during installation, you can add it as described above.

If you continue to experience issues, please provide more details about your project structure and the exact steps you have taken.
