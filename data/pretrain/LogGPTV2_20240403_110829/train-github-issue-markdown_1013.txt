Start with:
           volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /vol
              name: vol 
            - mountPath: /vol-456                                                                                                                                 
              name: vol 
              subPath: d456
Edit to:
            volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /vol
              name: vol 
            - mountPath: /vol-d2
              name: vol
              subPath: d2     
Read back what happened:
            volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /vol-d2
              name: vol 
              subPath: d2
            - mountPath: /vol-456
              name: vol 
              subPath: d456
It synthesized a COMPLETELY WRONG result. At this point, I can not, in good
conscience, advocate using kubectl edit.
Can I please have `kubectl edit --replace` that doesn't go through patch
brokenness. Or better, make that default for 1.5 and make `kubectl edit
--patch` be the broken (but eventually fixed) path.
