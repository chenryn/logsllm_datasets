commodity ﬂow linear program (this routing was looked at
in [16]). Note that this routing is optimized for a speciﬁc
TM, thus, it does not provide performance guarantees for
other TMs. This is important, since, as mentioned earlier,
traﬃc patterns change over time and it is also not generally
possible to obtain a good estimate of the current TM.
The deﬁnition of the performance ratio follows the “com-
petitive analysis” framework where performance guarantees
of a certain solution are provided relative to the best possi-
ble solution. We now extend the deﬁnition of performance
ratio of a routing to be with respect to a set of TMs. Let D
be a set of TMs. The performance ratio of a routing f on D
is deﬁned as
perf(f, D) = max
D∈D
perf(f,{D}) .
A routing f is optimal for the set D if and only if it mini-
mizes the performance ratio, that is, perf(f, D) is minimal.
The performance ratio perf(f, D) is always at least 1 – but
note that the best possible performance ratio on the set of
TMs D can be strictly larger than 1; since generally, a single
routing that is optimal for all TMs in the set may not exist.
When the set D includes all possible TMs, we refer to the
performance ratio as the oblivious performance ratio of a
routing. The oblivious ratio is the worst performance ratio
a routing obtains with respect to all TMs. A routing with
a minimum oblivious ratio is an optimal oblivious routing,
and its oblivious ratio is the optimal oblivious ratio of the
network.
To better interpret the performance ratio, note that it is
invariant under scaling of the TMs in the set D or of the link
capacities. The performance ratio constitutes a comparative
measure of diﬀerent routings, on a given topology and set
of TMs, but it is not a meaningful comparative measure
between diﬀerent network topologies – it is deﬁned relative
to the minimum possible maximum link utilization, but the
min max utilization itself varies with topology. Also note
that there can be many possible optimal routings and they
can diﬀer in how they perform on speciﬁc TMs. Illustrative
examples and analysis of the optimal oblivious performance
ratio on some simple networks are provided in Section 6.
3.3 Computing an optimal routing
Until recently, known tools allowed for optimizing the
routing with respect to a given TM, but beyond speciﬁc
highly structured topologies (such as hypercubic networks),
not much was known about how to eﬃciently construct an
optimal routing with respect to a broad set of demands and
what are the optimal performance ratios. A recent break-
through work by R¨acke [17] showed (existentially) a surpris-
ing upper bound: all symmetric networks (that is, networks
where link capacities are the same in both directions, as
is typically the case with large backbone networks) have a
routing with an oblivious ratio that is at most polylogarith-
mic in the number of nodes. R¨acke’s existential bound trig-
gered the development of a polynomial time construction of
an optimal oblivious routing [3] for any network (symmetric
or not). The polynomial time algorithm in [3] is based on
applying the Ellipsoid algorithm to an exponential-size LP
model and as such is not practical for large networks. We
develop a novel simpler and faster algorithm (both asymp-
totically and implementation wise) for computing an opti-
mal oblivious routing that is based on a polynomial-size LP
formulation (see details in Section 5). We then extend our
model to optimize the routing with respect to range restric-
tions on OD-pair demands.
In our simulations, we solve
these LPs using the CPLEX LP solver [7] (other public-
domain LP solvers could be applied as well).
3.4 Limitations
We conclude this section with discussion of limitations.
Our models and metrics do not capture the interaction be-
tween traﬃc demands and the resulting actual throughput,
we rather compare diﬀerent routings through the maximum
link utilization obtained if all demands are indeed routed.
This is a reasonable metric as packet loss and congestion are
more likely when the utilization is higher.
Our evaluation focuses on point to point (OD pair) de-
mands rather than point-to-multipoint. Point-to-multipoint
demands are often relevant to large ISPs (e.g. when there
are multiple peering points to a diﬀerent ISP and thus any of
a number of egress points can be used interchangeably [9]).
This point-to-point “restriction” stems mostly from the lim-
itations of our data and in principle our techniques and soft-
ware extend to cover point to multipoint demands.
Our optimizations are performed with respect to maxi-
mum link utilization and performance ratio. In speciﬁc im-

beyond capacity utilization one may want to optimize MPLS
label stack size or the number of provisioned paths.).
4. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS
The ﬁrst question we address is, what are the best per-
formance ratio guarantees attainable on our test networks
barring any knowledge of traﬃc demands? Table 2 lists the
oblivious performance ratio for 3 diﬀerent routings: The op-
timal oblivious routing (computed using the LP formulation
in Section 5.3), and two other natural routings - the OSPF
routing (using the weights provided in the dataset.2.), and
the optimal routing for the Gravity TMs (computed by solv-
ing a multi-commodity ﬂow LP). The performance ratio of
each given routing was computed using the “slave LP” for-
mulation in Section 5.2. The optimal oblivious performance
ratio on the evaluated topologies ranges from 1.425 − 1.972,
which means that these networks have a routing that on any
TM is guaranteed to have maximum link utilization that
is at most 43%-97% larger than that of the best possible
routing that is tailored to this TM. The two other routings
evaluated have signiﬁcantly worse (2-3 digit) oblivious ra-
tios, which means that on some TMs, they are very far from
the tailored optimal routing. These gaps indicate that it is
unlikely that an oblivious performance ratio that is close to
optimal can be obtained in an ad hoc manner, without the
use of our optimization tools.
A 43%-97% (worst case) overhead in max utilization is
far from being negligible to working ISPs – the good news,
however, is that such guarantees can be obtained with no
knowledge whatsoever on the traﬃc demands.
2Recall that these weights were such that the derived OSPF
routing is consistent with observed routes. Note that this
OSPF routing is diﬀerent from the best OSPF-style routing,
that is, a set of link weights such that the corresponding
OSPF routing has a minimum oblivious ratio. An indepen-
dent interesting problem is to produce an optimal OSPF-
style routing and compare its performance to the optimal
MPLS-based routing on our test networks. The optimiza-
tion, however, seems highly non-trivial as it can no longer
modeled as an LP. Obviously, the OSPF-style optimal obliv-
ious ratio is at least as large as the optimal (MPLS-style)
oblivious ratio. Generally, the performance gap can be large
(e.g., on clique networks), but one study [10] argues that
“typically,” for a single TM, the best OSPF routing nearly
matches in performance the optimal MPLS routing.
Fortunately, however, even though an exact current es-
timate of the TM is typically very hard to obtain, much
about the TM is known. The TM can vary within some
known range or can be estimated to within some known ac-
curacy. In this case, we would like a performance guarantee
with respect to all TMs that lie within some range. The
next question we examine is the sensitivity of the attain-
able performance ratio to the “error margin” within which
the TM is known. (Note that as we expand the set of TMs
with respect to which we compute the performance ratio,
the ratio can only increase).
In this set of experiments we consider a topology, a TM
(Bimodal or Gravity), and an error margin parameter w ≥
1. We consider a “base” TM, D (bimodal or gravity TM),
which can be thought of as our best “guess” of the actual
TM. The set of applicable TMs, Dw, includes each D
such
that for all OD pairs (i, j), dij/w ≤ d
ij ≤ wdij. This set can
(cid:3)
be thought of as including all TMs with respect to which we
want a performance guarantee.
(cid:3)
In our evaluation we compute the performance ratio of
diﬀerent routings on the set Dw (for diﬀerent values of w.).
The performance ratio for each given routing is computed
with respect to all (inﬁnitely many) TMs in the set Dw using
the “slave LP” formulation given in Section 5.2 with the
margin constraints added to it. The routings evaluated are:
• opt: An optimal routing for the range of demands Dw,
that is, a routing which minimizes perf(f, Dw). These
routings are computed via our LP models developed in
Section 5.4. (Note that there are potentially diﬀerent
routings for diﬀerent values of w.)
• no-margin-opt: An optimal routing for the base TM
(that is, a routing that minimizes perf(f,{D}) or equiv-
alently, the maximum link utilization when routing
D). This routing is computed by solving a multi-
commodity ﬂow LP.
• OSPF: The OSPF routing (using the weights provided
in the dataset).
• global-opt: An optimal oblivious routing for the topol-
ogy (that is, a routing that minimizes the worst-case
performance ratio over all possible TMs). These rout-
ings are computed using the LP models developed in
Section 5.3.
• nm-gravity-opt: When the base TM D is Bimodal,
we also consider an optimal routing for Gravity TMs
(the reverse would not work, as routing for bimodal
TMs are deﬁned only on subset of OD pairs). That
is, a routing f such that optU(DG) = perf(f,{DG})
(where DG is the gravity TM). This routing is com-
puted by solving a multi-commodity ﬂow LP with re-
spect to the TM DG.
Results for a representative sample of topologies and TMs
are shown in Figure 1. The ﬁgures plot the performance ra-
tio of the diﬀerent routings as a function of the margin w.
For all routing (as should be), the performance ratio (which
measures the worst ratio on the set of TMs) increases with
the margin w (as the set of TMs expands). Two of the rout-
ings, opt and no-margin-opt have an (optimal) performance
ratio of 1 when w = 1.
We observe that the routing optimized for the set of TMs
Dw signiﬁcantly outperforms the other routings we evalu-
ated. Note that for larger margins (say in the range 4–10),
the best possible performance guarantee on the set Dw (that
is, the performance ratio of opt) often approaches the op-
timal oblivious ratio (hence, for this amount of uncertainty
one might as well use global-opt instead of opt). The worst
performers are the routings that are not even optimized for
the base TM D, OSPF and nm-gravity-opt on the Bimodal
demands.
It is interesting to note that even when these
routings happened to perform well on the base TM D, the
performance guarantees still deteriorates quickly with the
margin w. Another interesting observation is that the no-
margin-opt routing which starts out with optimal perfor-
mance ratio of 1 for w = 1, quickly degrades with the error
margin, in some cases, under-performing OSPF routing for
larger margins.3 This behavior indicates that it is impor-
tant to take into account error margins when optimizing a
routing for speciﬁc TMs.
The optimal oblivious routing (global-opt) exhibits diﬀer-
ent behavior patterns. On about half the topologies/base
TMs, it shows close to its global worst-case ratio even on
smaller margins. On others, it performs well on small mar-
gins, but eventually (with margin 1.5-2.5 obtains its near-
worst case ratio).
We also observe that the optimal routing (opt) generally
allows for fairly sizable margins (over 50%, that is w ≥ 1.5)
with performance ratio that is close to 1. Figure 2 summa-
rizes the fraction of topologies/base TMs that can tolerate
a certain error margin while guaranteeing a certain perfor-
mance ratio. The two performance ratios considered are 1.05
(guaranteed to be within 5% of optimal maximum utiliza-
tion) and 1.25 (guaranteed to be within 25% of optimal).
The ﬁgure shows the two cumulative fraction plots. The
optimal routing, in most cases, can have a margin of 50%
(w = 1.5) with 5% performance overhead (performance ratio
at most 1.05) and a margin of 100% (w = 2) with 25% over-
head (performance ratio of at most 1.25). The no-margin-
opt and OSPF routings do not perform nearly as well: With
OSPF routing, for the vast majority of instances, the per-
formance ratio exceeds 1.25 with margins smaller than 10%
(w = 1.1). The no-margin-opt deteriorates quickly and on
most instances has a performance ratio that exceeds 1.25 for
margins that are at most 30% (w = 1.3).
Our observations from the experiments are consistent across
the diﬀerent topologies and TM generation methods. This
indicates that our conclusions are not likely to be sensitive to
various inaccuracies in our data (that stem from inaccurate
maps, heuristic capacities, and heuristic TMs).
We observed that all our test networks have an optimal
oblivious ratio smaller than 2. What can we take from this
observation ? Can we expect it to prevail when network
sizes scale up? It is known that some graphs with asym-
metric link capacities have optimal oblivious ratio that is
Ω(n0.5) [3] (n is the number of nodes in the graph). R¨acke’s
has established [17] that the worst case for “symmetric” ca-
pacities is at most O(log3 n).
It is also known that some
families of symmetric graphs have optimal oblivious ratio of
Ω(log n). Thus, the optimal oblivious ratio of arbitrary sym-
3A natural question is by how much in the worst case can the
performance ratio deteriorate as the margins increase. It is
not hard to see that for any f and D we have perf(f, Dw) ≤
w2perf(f, D) (and that this is asymptotically tight).
