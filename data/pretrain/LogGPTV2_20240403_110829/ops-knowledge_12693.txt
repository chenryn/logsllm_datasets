User: Please give a distributed cache solution based on the following scenario description. An e-commerce website needs to process high concurrent requests, and needs to cache data such as product information and user personalized recommendations. Using a stand-alone cache can no longer meet the demand.
Assistant: Distributed cache solution: Using Redis cluster as a distributed cache solution can improve the concurrent performance and scalability of data access by storing data on multiple nodes. At the same time, technologies such as data sharding and read-write separation can also be used to achieve better performance and disaster recovery capabilities. Distributed caching can be implemented using Redis cluster mode, where clients scatter data across different nodes of the cluster through virtual slots. Redis also provides high availability mechanisms, such as sentinel mode and Redis cluster mode. Sentinel mode automatically fails over failed nodes by monitoring the running status of Nodes, thereby achieving high availability of Redis; while Redis cluster is a new distributed architecture suitable for large-scale, highly reliable, and high-performance cluster environments. Supports automatic discovery and automatic fault migration of multiple Redis nodes.
