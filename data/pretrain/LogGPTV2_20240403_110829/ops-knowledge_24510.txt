User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Apache 2.4 & Ubuntu 14.04 error on Vagrant: "You don't have permission to access / on this server." I realize there are a lot of similar questions on here, but I've been struggling with this for hours and have been unable to find a solution.

When I try visiting my Vagrant Ubuntu box via the host name shopwise.dev (set to the Vagrant box's IP in /etc/hosts), I get the following error page:

Forbidden

You don't have permission to access / on this server.

Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu) Server at shopwise.dev Port 80


I created the file /etc/apache2/sites-available/shopwise.conf:

ServerName host.foxytronics.com
NameVirtualHost *:80

&lt;Directory /&gt;
    Options FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride All
    Require all granted
&lt;/Directory&gt;
&lt;Directory "/home/shopws/public_html"&gt;
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
    AllowOverride All
    Require all granted
&lt;/Directory&gt;

&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
    ServerAdmin myemail@gmail.com
    ServerName www.shopwise.dev
    ServerAlias shopwise.dev

    DirectoryIndex index.php
    Options FollowSymLinks
    DocumentRoot "/home/shopws/public_html"

    # Logfiles
    ErrorLog  /home/shopws/logs/apache/error.log
    CustomLog /home/shopws/logs/apache/access.log combined
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;


Then ran:

sudo a2ensite shopwise.conf
service apache2 reload


I verified the directory permissions along the path /home/shopws/public_html are 755 and the file permissions are also currently 755 (although I think they're actually supposed to be 644?).

Is my configuration incorrect?

UPDATE:

Assistant: As usual, my issue was totally my fault and due to my ignorance :-)

I needed to use the Directory directive to grant users permission to access the directory I chose to put my site's files in. This is my final working configuration:

&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
    ServerAdmin myemail@gmail.com
    ServerName www.shopwise.dev
    ServerAlias shopwise.dev

    DocumentRoot /home/shopws/public_html

    # Logfiles
    ErrorLog  /home/shopws/logs/apache/error.log
    CustomLog /home/shopws/logs/apache/access.log combined
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;

&lt;Directory /home/shopws/&gt;
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride None
        Require all granted
&lt;/Directory&gt;


I hope that helps someone else someday!
