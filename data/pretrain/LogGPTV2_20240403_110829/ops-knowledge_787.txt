User: I am going to write a TCP server, the client sends me XML message, I am wondering if below condition will happen and how to avoid that:
1) client sends <cmd ...></cmd>
2) sever is busy doing something
3) clients sends <cmd ...></cmd>
4) server does a recv() and put the string to buffer
Will the buffer be filled with <cmd ...></cmd><cmd ...></cmd> or even worse <cmd ...></cmd><cmd ... if my buffer is not big enough?
What I want is the TCP stack divides the messages to the same pieces as how clients sent them.
Is it doable?
Assistant: This is impossible to guarantee at the TCP level, since it only knows about streams.
Depending on the XML parser you're using, you should be able to feed it the stream and have it tell you when it has a complete object, leaving the second <cmd... in its buffer until it is closed also.
