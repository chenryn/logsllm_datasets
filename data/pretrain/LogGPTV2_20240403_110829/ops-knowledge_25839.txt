Question: An attacker has gained physical possession of an iOS device and is attempting to access encrypted data. Which of the following statements are true regarding the role of Effaceable Storage in this scenario?
"A": "Effaceable Storage is used to securely wipe cryptographic keys and can prevent the attacker from accessing the data if the device is in their possession.",
"B": "Keys stored in Effaceable Storage can be part of a key hierarchy that facilitates forward security, but physical possession of the device may allow an attacker to bypass these protections.",
"C": "The Effaceable Storage on an iOS device is primarily designed to store multimedia files securely and its compromise could directly lead to data leakage.",
"D": "Effaceable Storage's main role is to facilitate fast wipe of the device, rather than to provide confidentiality against attackers with physical access."
