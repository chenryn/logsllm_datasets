### Issue Description

I have thoroughly searched the issues in this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate. Thank you for providing such a useful library.

#### Expected Behavior
After upgrading Material-UI to version 1.0.0-beta.12, my fullscreen dialog lost its scroll functionality. To identify the problematic version, I downgraded Material-UI one version at a time. The issue was resolved when I reverted to version 1.0.0-beta.8, where the fullscreen dialog worked as expected.

#### Environment Details
- **Material-UI Version:** 1.0.0-beta.12
- **React Version:** 15.6.1
- **Browser:** Chrome Version 60.0.3112.11

Please let me know if you need any additional information or assistance in reproducing the issue.
