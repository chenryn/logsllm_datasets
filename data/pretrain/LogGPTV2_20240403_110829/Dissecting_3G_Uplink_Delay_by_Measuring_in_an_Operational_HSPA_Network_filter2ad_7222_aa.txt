Abstract. Users expect mobile Internet access via 3G technologies to
be comparable to wired access in terms of throughput and latency. HSPA
achieves this for throughput, whereas delay is signiﬁcantly higher.
In this paper we measure the overall latency introduced by HSUPA
and accurately dissect it into contributions of USB-modem (UE), base
station (NodeB) and network controller (RNC). We achieve this by com-
bining traces recorded at each interface along the data-path of a public
operational UMTS network. The actively generated sample traﬃc covers
real-time applications.
Results show the delay to be strongly dependent on the packet size,
with random components depending on synchronization issues. We pro-
vide models for latency of single network entities as well as accumulated
delay. These ﬁndings allow to identify optimum settings in terms of low
latency, both for application and network parameters.
1 Introduction
In the past few years the number of mobile devices accessing Internet via 3rd
Generation (3G) technologies experienced a signiﬁcant grow. Novel gadgets such
as smartphones and netbooks captured a new market, providing Internet access
paired with high mobility. Their users expect a connection quality comparable to
wired Internet access in terms of throughput and delay. In contrast to their wired
counterpart mobile broadband connections have to deal with varying channel
conditions depending on a manifold of parameters such as user position, mobility
and total number of users in a cell. This causes challenges in hiding limitations
of the access technology from the end-application and user.
The state of the art (2010) radio access technologies are High Speed Down-
link Packet Access (HSDPA) and High Speed Uplink Packet Access (HSUPA),
speciﬁed in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). These technologies
allow for throughput comparable to wired access, whereas the access delay is still
signiﬁcantly higher. Although improved compared to former releases [1], HSUPA
introduces high latency. The reason being the wireless channel as communication
resource shared among unsynchronized users and the master-slave hierarchy in
3G networks, meaning the Base Station (NodeB) has to grant access to the User

Equipment (UE) before data can be send. Hence, realtime applications claiming
very low latency encounter diﬃculties when connected via 3G networks. Such
realtime applications may be online games or machine-to-machine communica-
tion [2]. Application designers can exploit knowledge about delay characteristics
of mobile wireless connections to improve user experience. On the other hand,
networks can be optimized in terms of latency, given precise information about
its origin. Having reached wired data rates, reduction of delay is one of the main
goals for next generation wireless networks.
This work investigates the overall uplink One-Way Delay (OWD), Δ, intro-
duced by an operational HSUPA network and analyses the exact delay con-
tribution of every single network component. We conﬁne ourselves to measure
OWD because the up and downlink are strongly asymmetric, hence, Round-Trip
Time (RTT) measurements have weak signiﬁcance. Furthermore, we assess la-
tency of the 3G network only, since it constitutes the ﬁrst hop in terms of packet
communication. Data packets have been traced and accurately timestamped on
each communication link, from the destination PC throughout the UMTS Ter-
restrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN) up to the Internet gateway. Since each
packet is subject to changes in protocols and size, we particularly monitor Inter-
net Protocol (IP) packets, for which the mobile network is transparent. We pay
special attention to the packet size, which has strong inﬂuence on the OWD.
To the best of our knowledge this is the ﬁrst work reporting accurate OWD
measurements from a HSUPA network, providing latency statistics of each net-
work component. In [3] the authors performed end-to-end measurements of OWD
with high timestamping accuracy, however, without intermediate measurement
points. They give results for three diﬀerent network operators. Their traﬃc gen-
eration method diﬀers signiﬁcantly from ours. The authors of [4] and [5] provide
OWD measurements with low timestamping accuracy from multiple network
operators. They use ICMP ping messages as measured data traﬃc, in order to
highlight the importance of the right data generation method, which has to be
RCF 2330 [6] compliant in their opinion. RTT measurements from a HSUPA
testbed are presented in [7], where data was generated by the ping program.
In [8] large-scale RTT measurements from a Wide-band Code Division Multiple
Access (WCDMA) network are presented, resulting from captured Transmission
Control Protocol (TCP) acknowledgement packets. Parts of the presented mea-
surement setup have been reused for this work. Furthermore, possible reasons for
variability in delay in wireless networks are highlighted, which do mostly apply
for HSUPA as well, e.g. radio channel conditions or scheduling and channel as-
signment. Finally, the authors of [9] investigate OWD introduced by the Serving
GPRS Support Node (SGSN), a 3G network component. Although reusing parts
of their measurement setup, results cannot be compared because 3GPP speciﬁes
that from Rel. 7 on data traﬃc bypasses the SGSN.
This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 explains the measurement setup
in detail. The results are presented in Section 3 and analyzed in detail.
We conclude with Section 4, giving an outlook on future networks.

2 Measurement Setup
The measurements were carried out in the operational Universal Mobile Telecom-
munication System (UMTS) network, of one of the biggest operators in Austria,
EU. An overview of the data path of this network is given in Fig. 1. The dashed
lines indicate the names of the diﬀerent interfaces between network components.
Δ1 to Δ3 indicate the delay contributions of the single elements, Δ the accu-
mulated delay. In the following the components are explained brieﬂy.
– PC. The computer on which the end-application is running and application
interface traces are captured.
– USB-modem. The USB-modem used for measurements is manufactured by
Option [10] and equipped with Rel. 7 HSUPA functionality.
– NodeB. The Base Station (NodeB) receives and decodes the packets. For
controllable measurement conditions an indoor NodeB was chosen.
– RNC. The Radio Network Controller (RNC) is the controlling entity in the
UTRAN. It coordinates multiple NodeBs. It handles tasks such as ciphering,
soft-handover and radio connection manipulations.
– SGSN. The Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) controls the radio connec-
tion and handles mobility issues. Since Rel. 7 it is not part of the data path
any more.
– GGSN. The Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) is the gateway to the
Internet. It sends plain IP-packets towards their destination.
All interfaces shown in Fig. 1, except IuPS, were traced in order to carry out delay
measurements of each separate network component. The exact methodology is
explained in Section 2.2 for each interface separately. The reason for not tracing
the IuPS interface is the direct tunneling feature taking eﬀect in Rel. 7. This
feature allows the SGSN to remove itself from the data path. Consequently, the
expected delay between IuPS and Gn interface is negligible and not considered
further.

2.1 Traﬃc Generation
The traﬃc patterns sent over the network in order to measure latency were gen-
erated actively. According to the proposals in IP Performance Metrics (IPPM)
RFC2330 [6], they consist of packets with random size and random-inter arrival
time. The importance of the right choice in traﬃc patterns is highlighted in [5],
where the authors reason that invariant traﬃc generation models such as used by
the ping command are not adequate for latency measurements in 3G networks.
We chose User Datagram Protocol (UDP)-packets for transmission, whereas we
allow for large packets up to 10 kByte. This approach is unusual for network
measurements, because big packets are segmented into smaller packets of max-
imum Packet Data Unit (PDU) size. However, the 3G network is transparent
for IP packets and interprets segments just as extra payload. Furthermore, such
packet sizes are demanded by latency sensitive applications [11], and therefore
considered in this work. In order to guarantee the USB-modem is operating in
HSUPA mode, we kept the mean data rate above 1 kbit/s. Otherwise the net-
work scheduler would release the HSUPA connection and force the modem to
WCDMA Forward Access Channel (FACH) operation, in order to save radio
resources. Consequences of such a fallback are observed in [4] and [3], resulting
in very high delay values for small packet sizes. In the context of this study these
eﬀects are undesired and hence avoided.
2.2 Measurement Devices
OWD measurements require careful consideration of (i) time synchronization of
the measurement entities and (ii) accurate packet recognition. In our measure-
ment setup we use Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers for time synchro-
nization, which allow for a precision better than 1 μs. This precision is satisfactory
for our purposes, since we plan to achieve a maximum resolution of 100 μs. We use
full IP and UDP headers to distinguish between packets at diﬀerent interfaces.
Since the whole 3G network, from UE to GGSN corresponds to one hop in terms
of IP-networking, both packet headers are not altered during the propagation. In
the following sections measurement methods and devices are described.
Gn Interface. As depicted in Fig. 1, the Gn interface connects the GGSN to
the rest of the 3G network. We passively monitor this link by means of wiretaps
and dedicated tracing hardware, i.e. Endace DAG cards [12] with GPS synchro-
nization. The system has been developed in an earlier project in collaboration

UE (digital domain)
with Telecommunications Research Center Vienna (ftw), see [13] and [14]. An
outline of the measurement setup is given in Fig. 2. The timestamping accuracy
is speciﬁed by the manufacturer with less than 200 ns.
Iub Interface. For data acquisition at the Iub interface the same measure-
ment setup as for Gn has been deployed, see Fig. 2. Tracing at this interface
appears particularly challenging because of the complex protocol hierarchy, ci-
phered payload and soft handover [15]. IP packets do not appear in one piece at
this interface but split into single Radio Link Control (RLC) frames which are
timestamped separately.
Air Interface. Packet sniﬃng (fully decoding) at the air interface we consider
too challenging for our purposes. Instead, we can identify start and end time of
single packets by monitoring the transmission power of the UE. This is HSUPA
speciﬁc, since the NodeB assigns extra transmission power to the UE via Relative
Grant Channel (RGCH), in order to transmit data in uplink [1]. This method
allows to identify packet transmissions, as long as the inter-arrival time of packets
is big enough to guarantee a change in allocated transmission power between
packets. Depending on the payload size we varied this time from 10 ms to 100 ms.
The measurement setup is depicted in Fig. 3. An antenna with bandpass ﬁlter
(1920 - 1980 Mhz) and attached power detector [16] is placed nearby the UE.
The measured signal is fed into a standard audio device of a PC, with a sampling
rate of 44.1 kHz and 16 bit resolution. Figure 4 shows the resulting digital signal.
Here we observe the end of a packet transmission (44 ms) with Hybrid Automatic
Repeat Request (HARQ) retransmission (46 ms, 50 ms). The small steps result
from the Inner Loop Power Control (ILPC) power adjustments. Synchronization
is achieved by applying the Pulse Per Second (PPS) output of a GPS receiver [17]
at the second audio channel. The timestamping accuracy is limited by the inter-
sample time of the audio card (22.7 μs).
Application Interface. We chose the traﬃc generating application and the
application-interface traﬃc monitoring tool to reside on the same PC. Therefore

Fig. 6. Synchronization quality
we verify the CPU load to not exceed 20 % during measurements and hence as-
sume the mutual inﬂuence of applications to be negligible. Packet capturing was
performed by the use of libpcap [18] and the Wireshark tool, see Fig. 5. In order
to achieve correct timestamping of the traﬃc, we synchronize the software-clock
of the PC to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). We deploy a GPS receiver [17]
attached at the serial port and the LinuxPPS toolkit [19] to adjust the PC clock,
see Fig. 5. The synchronization accuracy was veriﬁed with a rubidium oscillator,
results yield roughly 10 μs, see Fig. 6.
3 Results
The measurement results presented in the following are obtained from a pro-
tected environment. Although, the NodeB to which we established connections
is operational and publicly available, it is deployed in an indoor scenario (oﬃce)
with low cell load and a relatively small number of users. Furthermore, it com-
municates with the RNC via Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) connection
and the Transmission Time Intervals (TTIs) have 10 ms duration. HSUPA also
provides 2 ms TTIs for improved latency, hence, the presented results constitute
a worst case scenario. The channel conditions were stationary and the data rate
was constant in the long run. As pointed out in [8], the deployment scenario
strongly inﬂuences OWD. We publicly advertise a sample data set [20], enabling
reproduction of the following results.
3.1 Single Components
In the following we provide delay measurement results focusing on the single net-
work components, named Δ1 to Δ3 in Fig. 1. This information allows to identify
main sources of latency and to detect network settings which are improvable in
terms of delay.
