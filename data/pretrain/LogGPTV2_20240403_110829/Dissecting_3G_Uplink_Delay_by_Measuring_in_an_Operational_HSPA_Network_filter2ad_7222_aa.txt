## Abstract
Users expect mobile Internet access via 3G technologies to be comparable to wired access in terms of throughput and latency. While HSPA achieves this for throughput, the latency is significantly higher. In this paper, we measure the overall latency introduced by HSUPA and accurately dissect it into contributions from the USB modem (UE), base station (NodeB), and network controller (RNC). We achieve this by combining traces recorded at each interface along the data path of a public operational UMTS network. The actively generated sample traffic covers real-time applications.

Results show that the delay is strongly dependent on packet size, with random components influenced by synchronization issues. We provide models for the latency of individual network entities and the accumulated delay. These findings allow for the identification of optimal settings in terms of low latency, both for application and network parameters.

## 1. Introduction
In recent years, the number of mobile devices accessing the Internet via 3rd Generation (3G) technologies has grown significantly. Novel gadgets such as smartphones and netbooks have captured a new market, providing Internet access paired with high mobility. Users expect a connection quality comparable to wired Internet access in terms of throughput and delay. However, mobile broadband connections must deal with varying channel conditions, which depend on factors such as user position, mobility, and the total number of users in a cell. This poses challenges in hiding the limitations of the access technology from the end-application and user.

The state-of-the-art (as of 2010) radio access technologies are High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) and High Speed Uplink Packet Access (HSUPA), specified in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). These technologies offer throughput comparable to wired access, but the access delay remains significantly higher. Although improved compared to earlier releases, HSUPA still introduces high latency due to the wireless channel being a shared resource among unsynchronized users and the master-slave hierarchy in 3G networks, where the Base Station (NodeB) must grant access to the User Equipment (UE) before data can be sent. Real-time applications requiring very low latency, such as online games or machine-to-machine communication, face difficulties when connected via 3G networks. Application designers can use knowledge about delay characteristics to improve user experience. On the other hand, networks can be optimized for latency if precise information about its origin is available. With wired data rates achieved, reducing delay is one of the main goals for next-generation wireless networks.

This work investigates the overall uplink One-Way Delay (OWD) introduced by an operational HSUPA network and analyzes the exact delay contribution of each network component. We focus on OWD because the uplink and downlink are strongly asymmetric, making Round-Trip Time (RTT) measurements less significant. Furthermore, we assess the latency of the 3G network only, as it constitutes the first hop in packet communication. Data packets were traced and accurately timestamped on each communication link, from the destination PC through the UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN) to the Internet gateway. Since each packet is subject to changes in protocols and size, we monitor Internet Protocol (IP) packets, for which the mobile network is transparent. We pay special attention to the packet size, which has a strong influence on OWD.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work reporting accurate OWD measurements from a HSUPA network, providing latency statistics for each network component. Previous studies have either focused on end-to-end measurements without intermediate points or used ICMP ping messages, which may not be suitable for latency-sensitive applications. Our results highlight the importance of the right data generation method, which should be RFC 2330 compliant. RTT measurements from a HSUPA testbed and large-scale RTT measurements from a WCDMA network have also been reported, but these do not provide the detailed breakdown of latency contributions that our study does.

## 2. Measurement Setup
The measurements were conducted in the operational Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) network of one of the largest operators in Austria. An overview of the data path is provided in Figure 1, which shows the interfaces between network components and the delay contributions of each element. The components include:

- **PC**: The computer running the end-application and capturing application interface traces.
- **USB Modem**: A Rel. 7 HSUPA-capable USB modem manufactured by Option.
- **NodeB**: The Base Station that receives and decodes packets. An indoor NodeB was chosen for controlled measurement conditions.
- **RNC**: The Radio Network Controller, which coordinates multiple NodeBs and handles tasks such as ciphering, soft-handover, and radio connection manipulations.
- **SGSN**: The Serving GPRS Support Node, which controls the radio connection and handles mobility issues. It is no longer part of the data path in Rel. 7.
- **GGSN**: The Gateway GPRS Support Node, which acts as the gateway to the Internet and sends plain IP packets to their destination.

All interfaces except IuPS were traced to carry out delay measurements of each separate network component. The methodology for each interface is explained in Section 2.2. The IuPS interface was not traced due to the direct tunneling feature in Rel. 7, which removes the SGSN from the data path, making the expected delay between IuPS and Gn negligible.

### 2.1 Traffic Generation
Traffic patterns for measuring latency were generated actively, consisting of packets with random sizes and inter-arrival times, following the IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) RFC 2330. UDP packets were used for transmission, allowing for large packets up to 10 kByte. This approach is unusual for network measurements but is necessary for latency-sensitive applications. To ensure the USB modem operates in HSUPA mode, the mean data rate was kept above 1 kbit/s, preventing fallback to WCDMA FACH operation, which would result in very high delay values for small packet sizes.

### 2.2 Measurement Devices
OWD measurements require careful time synchronization and accurate packet recognition. GPS receivers were used for time synchronization, achieving a precision better than 1 μs. Full IP and UDP headers were used to distinguish packets at different interfaces. The measurement setup for each interface is described below.

- **Gn Interface**: Monitored passively using wiretaps and Endace DAG cards with GPS synchronization, developed in collaboration with ftw. The timestamping accuracy is less than 200 ns.
- **Iub Interface**: The same setup as for Gn was used, with tracing challenging due to the complex protocol hierarchy, ciphered payload, and soft handover. IP packets appear split into single RLC frames, which are timestamped separately.
- **Air Interface**: Packet sniffing was considered too challenging. Instead, the start and end times of packets were identified by monitoring the UE's transmission power. An antenna with a bandpass filter and power detector was placed near the UE, and the signal was fed into a standard audio device with a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz and 16-bit resolution. Synchronization was achieved using the PPS output of a GPS receiver, with a timestamping accuracy of 22.7 μs.
- **Application Interface**: The traffic-generating application and the traffic-monitoring tool resided on the same PC. CPU load was kept below 20% during measurements. Libpcap and Wireshark were used for packet capturing, and the PC clock was synchronized to UTC using a GPS receiver and the LinuxPPS toolkit, achieving a synchronization accuracy of roughly 10 μs.

## 3. Results
The measurement results were obtained from a protected environment with a low cell load and a relatively small number of users. The NodeB was deployed indoors, and the RNC communicated via ATM with 10 ms TTIs. HSUPA also provides 2 ms TTIs for improved latency, so the presented results represent a worst-case scenario. The channel conditions were stationary, and the data rate was constant in the long run. The deployment scenario strongly influences OWD, and a sample data set is publicly available for reproducing the results.
