Do Export Controls on Intrusion Software 
Threaten Security Research?
Truth is… we don’t know. 
(We’re not lawyers and this isn’t legal advice.) 
Truth is… the Government doesn’t know. 
(At least they are asking questions.)  
Truth is… nobody knows.  
(We don’t even agree about this...)     
Outline:
1.
Some Basics
a.
What is the problem? 
b.
How do export controls work generally? 
2.
How these new Wassenaar rules work
a.
IP Network Surveillance Systems

3.
Implications
a.

b.
Do these rules apply to Vulnerability Research?
c.
Could these rules regulate coordinated disclosure or bug bounties?
d.
Could these rules regulate training classes? 
e.
What if I leave pen testing tools on my laptop when I travel?

What about foreign coworkers or my company’s offices in other countries?
g.
What about reverse engineering tools? Debuggers? Exploit generators? Jailbreakers?

What can we do about it? 
The Basics
Surveillance is Big Business!
What’s the problem? 
The Problem:
1. The Citizen Lab correctly identified 21 customers of Hacking Team.
2. The US DEA and US Army are customers. DEA are  using the technology out of their embassy in Bogota, Colombia.
3. Hacking Team sold its technology to three agencies in Morocco. The Moroccan government's intimidation of civil society… is 
nothing more than an attempt to silence legitimate criticism.
4. Hacking Team have been evading the legitimate questions from UN investigators regarding the sale of 
technology to Sudan.
5. NICE Systems appears to have sold Hacking Team spyware to Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, and Denmark. 
6. Hacking Team are trying to secure a sale to the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), a Bangladesh police unit 
described by Human Rights Watch as a “death squad” involved in torture and extrajudicial killings.
7. Hacking team reinstated support contracts with the Ethiopian government despite reports of the targeting of Ethiopian US-based 
journalists by Hacking Team's spyware. 
8. Our lobbying of the Italian government on export controls worked. We wrote to the Italian Ministry of Economic 
Development, over 100 parliamentarians, and to the regional Government calling for unilateral export controls on Hacking Team's spyware. We were 
successful in that the Italian government implemented the controls that we had been calling for and temporarily suspended Hacking Team's operations, 
citing “possible uses concerning internal repression and violations of human rights”.
The Solution:
What is the Wassenaar Arrangement?
How do export controls work in the US? 
●
Governed by the US Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS)
●
Controls “Dual Use Items” - Civilian items that have military applications
●
Includes controls on Cryptography
●
The new controls on “Intrusion Software” fit here 
Wait, didn’t we win the crypto wars? 
License Exception TSU
The New Rules
IP Network Surveillance Systems
5. A. 1. j. IP network communications surveillance systems or equipment, and specially designed components therefor, having all of the 
following:
1. Performing all of the following on a carrier class IP network (e.g., national grade IP backbone):
●
Analysis at the application layer (e.g., Layer 7 of Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model (ISO/IEC 7498-1));
●
Extraction of selected metadata and application content (e.g., voice, video, messages, attachments); and
●
Indexing of extracted data; and
2. Being specially designed to carry out all of the following:
●
Execution of searches on the basis of ‘hard selectors’; and
●
Mapping of the relational network of an individual or of a group of people. 
What is “Intrusion Software?”
“Software” specially designed or modified to avoid detection by ‘monitoring 
tools’, or to defeat ‘protective countermeasures’, of a computer or network 
capable device, and performing any of the following:
• The extraction of data or information, from a computer or network capable 
device, or the modification of system or user data; or
• The modification of the standard execution path of a program or process in 
order to allow the execution of externally provided instructions. 
●
‘Monitoring tools’: “software” or hardware devices, that monitor system behaviours or processes running on a device. This includes 
antivirus (AV) products, end point security products, Personal Security Products (PSP), Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), Intrusion 
Prevention Systems (IPS) or firewalls.
●
‘Protective countermeasures’: techniques designed to ensure the safe execution of code, such as Data Execution Prevention (DEP), 
Address Space Layout Randomisation (ASLR) or sandboxing 
Is “Intrusion Software” Controlled? 
NO
Then what IS controlled? 
4. A. 5. Systems, equipment, and components therefore, 
specially designed or modified for the generation, operation 
or delivery of, or communication with, “Intrusion Software”.
4. D. 4. “Software” specially designed or modified for the 
generation, operation or delivery of, or communication with, 
“Intrusion Software”. 
“Technology” is also controlled
4. E. 1. c. “Technology” for the “development” of “Intrusion 
Software”.
Technology - Specific information necessary for the “development”, 
“production”, or “use” of a product. The information takes the form of ‘technical 
data’ or ‘technical assistance’. 
NOTE: “Intrusion Software” itself is NOT controlled, but information necessary 
for the “development” of “Intrusion Software” IS controlled, including “technical 
data” and “technical assistance.” 
The Implications
What about Full Disclosure and Open Source? 
15 CFR 734.3 - The following items are not subject to the EAR:
Publicly available technology and software… that:
(i) Are already published or will be published as described in §734.7 of this 
part;
(ii) Arise during, or result from, fundamental research, as described in §734.8 
of this part;
(iii) Are educational, as described in §734.9 of this part;
Encryption vs. “Intrusion Software” Stuff 
Encryption:
●
License Exception TSU
●
Must be publicly available
●
Must be open source
●
You must email BIS and notify them
Controlled Stuff related to “Intrusion Software”:
●
15 CFR 734.3(b)(4)
●
Must be publicly available
●
Does NOT need to be open source
●
BIS does NOT need to be notified
Is Vulnerability Research Covered?
BIS, in the federal register: “Technology for the development of intrusion software 
includes proprietary research on the vulnerabilities and exploitation of computers and network-
capable devices.”
BIS, in the FAQ on their website: “The proposed rule would not control… Information 
about the vulnerability, including causes of the vulnerability.” 
BIS, also in the FAQ on their website: “Neither the disclosure of the vulnerability 
nor the disclosure of the exploit code would be controlled under the proposed rule.”
However: “The proposed rule would control… 
Technical data to create a controllable exploit that can reliably and predictably defeat 
protective countermeasures and extract information
Information on how to prepare the exploit for delivery or integrate it into a command and 
delivery platform.”
Coordinated Disclosure and Bug Bounties
From the BIS FAQ: “Any technical data sent to an 
anti-virus company or software manufacturer with the 
understanding that the information will be made publicly 
available, would not be subject to the EAR. 
However, "technology" that is not intended to be 
published would be subject to the control.”
Planning to disclose a mitigation bypass?
Sharing Exploit Toolkit Samples? 
If you discover an exploit toolkit in the wild and want to 
share it with other infosec professionals or software 
vendors across borders, apparently, this may not be 
allowed under the proposed rule. 
BIS, in their FAQ: “Exploit toolkits would be described in 
proposed ECCN 4D004… There are no end user or end use 
license exceptions in the proposed rule.”
What about training classes?
On the one hand: Technical data to create a controllable exploit that can reliably and 
predictably defeat protective countermeasures and extract information. Information on how to 
prepare the exploit for delivery or integrate it into a command and delivery platform.
On the other hand, 15 CFR 734.7(a)(4): Release at an open conference, meeting, 
seminar, trade show, or other open gathering.
(i) A conference or gathering is “open” if all technically qualified members of the public are eligible to 
attend and attendees are permitted to take notes or otherwise make a personal record (not 
necessarily a recording) of the proceedings and presentations.
(ii) All technically qualified members of the public may be considered eligible to attend a conference or 
other gathering notwithstanding a registration fee reasonably related to cost and reflecting an intention 
that all interested and technically qualified persons be able to attend, or a limitation on actual 
attendance, as long as attendees either are the first who have applied or are selected on the basis of 
relevant scientific or technical competence, experience, or responsibility (See Supplement No. 1 to 
this part, Questions B(1) through B(6)).
Planning to travel outside the USA? 
§ 740.14 Baggage (BAG).
(a) Scope. This License Exception authorizes individuals leaving the United States either temporarily 
(i.e., traveling) or longer-term (i.e., moving) and crew members of exporting or reexporting carriers to 
take to any destination, as personal baggage, the classes of commodities, software and technology 
described in this section.
BIS, in the Federal Register: “No license exceptions would be available for these items, 
except certain provisions of License Exception GOV, e.g., exports to or on behalf of the United States 
Government pursuant to § 740.11(b) of the EAR.” 
What about foreign coworkers & offices? 
BIS, in their FAQ: “The proposed rule does not provide for any exceptions to 
deemed export license requirements.”
BIS on “Deemed Export” - “Release of controlled technology to foreign 
persons in the U.S. are "deemed" to be an export to the person’s country or 
countries of nationality.”
Also, BIS, in their FAQ: “There is no license exception for intra-company 
transfers or internal use by a company headquartered in the United States 
under the proposed rule.”
Debuggers and exploit generators?
BIS, in their FAQ: “General purpose tools, such as IDEs, are not described 
under proposed ECCN 4D004 because they are not "specially designed" for the 
generation of "intrusion software." Some penetration testing tools (FAQ #12) 
and exploit toolkits (FAQ #18) are described in proposed ECCN 4D004, as they 
are command and delivery platforms for "intrusion software."”
Jailbreaking Software?
BIS, in their FAQ:  “If particular jailbreak software did meet all the 
requirements for classification under ECCN 4D004 (such as a commercially 
sold delivery tool "specially designed" to deliver jailbreaking exploits) then it 
would be subject to control and a license would be required to export it from 
the United States. Note that if such software were "publicly available," it 
would not be subject to the Export Administration Regulations.”
Will I get a license?
BIS, in the Federal Register: “Note that there is a policy 
of presumptive denial for items that have or support 
rootkit or zero-day exploit capabilities.” 
Dave Aitel: “If you are modular in any way, you facilitate 
0day. An 0day is just a program after all. So anything that 
can execute commands or auto update is now "default 
deny" for export.”
What do we do about it?
Comment Period?
At the time these slides were composed, the 
open comment period will close before 
Defcon, on July 20th, 2015.
However, we anticipate that BIS may extend 
this comment period, or open up a new one in 
the future.  
Key Points:
●
At least, the US has published their interpretations and asked for feedback.
○
The Wassenaar Negotiators did not.
○
Many countries in Europe have enacted this without publishing information about how 
they plan to interpret it. 
●
Regulators will probably be responsive to clear, negative impacts the regs will have on:
○
Legitimate information security research.
○
Legitimate computer security work.
○
Legitimate business activity and the economy as a whole.
●
Regulators will not be responsive to vitriol or paranoid, overly broad misinterpretations of 
their proposed regs. 
○
Its important to relate potential problems to the specific statements that regulators 
have made about how they interpret the regulations.
