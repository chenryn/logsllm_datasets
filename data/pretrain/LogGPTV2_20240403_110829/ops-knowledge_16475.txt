Question: If an anomaly-based detection system is experiencing a high rate of false positives, flagging benign activities as suspicious, which of the following could be a contributing factor?
"A": "The system has been trained on a highly diverse dataset of normal behavior patterns, including some anomalies.",
"B": "The system's definition of normal behavior is too broad, allowing many types of attacks to go undetected.",
"C": "The system has been calibrated to be highly sensitive to deviations from the normal, to the point of overfitting to the training data.",
"D": "There is an extensive list of known attack signatures that the system checks each activity against."
Answer: C
