User: is this possible to view contents and Functions of a DLL file...
few times ago i was playing with OlyDBG then i found there is option for viewing contents of dll...
so suggest me any good tool or soft for this...   
and suppose i have a DLL named "Python27.dll"...
now i need to view the content of this DLL so what do i do...
thanx...
Assistant: I've done some work with ctypes, and loading dlls in windows, but I don't think DLL have any sort of introspection.  This really isn't a big deal, because all of the function calls in DLLs are static.  If your trying to use a undocumented DLL, you would not only need to know the names of the functions, but also the parameters of the functions.  You would have to reverse engineer the DLL, no small task.
So, in my opinion, I would say no.
