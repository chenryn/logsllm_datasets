When running test suites, I don't want to rely on an internet connection.
However, I have defined the `checkMX` constraint on various email fields, and
this does a remote DNS lookup to perform the validation.
Should it not be possible to tell the validator that for the test environment
any remote DNS calls should be skipped? Currently some of my tests fail when
there is no connectivity due to the MX lookup failing.
I have tried using expression syntax in the validation but this does not
appear to work
    email:
          - Email:
              message: The email {{ value }} does not seem to be valid.
              checkMX: @=parameter('kernel.environment') == 'test' ? false : true
Any thoughts?
