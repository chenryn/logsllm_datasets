Thus far, the discussion of the simulation results have focused on
coarse-grained ordering-based comparisons of the critical thresh-
olds of the various protocols. Even coarse-grained comparisons of
adoptability are useful, since an ordering can be derived for a previ-
ously unordered set of security properties. Sometimes, the ordering
of security properties is trivial, for example, no attack is possible
against full path security that was not possible for OA+1. How-
ever, this is not necessarily the case. For example, consider the
case where soBGP performs routing topology veriﬁcation where
well-known and stable routes between non-adopters of soBGP are
considered part of the normal topology against which routes are
compared. In such a scenario, the attacks that can be performed

creases in adoptability, indicating that full path security is indeed
highly valuable in driving protocol adoption in the weak attacker
model. We conjecture that the signiﬁcant difference in the effec-
tiveness of full path security between the strong and weak attacker
models is again due to events in the most vital early stages of adop-
tion. Under the strong attacker model, as long as some node close
to the originator (e.g., node C in Figure 9) is a non-adopter, the
attacker retains a very strong path-spooﬁng ability. Hence, early
in the adoption process when not many ASes are adopters, there
remain many points of vulnerability. This prevents full path secu-
rity from being signiﬁcantly more useful than origin authentication
until a large fraction of the Internet has already adopted the proto-
col. However, in the weak attacker model, it is more likely that a
small number of early adopters can signiﬁcantly improve the subse-
quent adoption beneﬁts of later adopters—whenever an AS adopts
the protocol, as long as the rest of the ASes between the origina-
tor and the newly adopting AS are also secure, this will reduce (by
one hop) the spooﬁng capabilities of every malicious AS down-
stream from it. This improvement in security may be sufﬁcient to
cause further adoption in later iterations and thus continue to drive
the adoption process for values of the switching threshold which
would have stalled adoption under the strong attacker model.
It was expected that SPV, having Retroactive Path Integrity, would
be more adoptable than S-BGP; however, the observed difference
in the two schemes’ critical thresholds was small. This indicates
that Retroactive Path Integrity is only slightly more effective in in-
creasing the adoptability of a protocol, and is hence probably not a
feature that should be emphasized in future protocol research.
As we do for the strong attacker model, we vary the initial adop-
Besides highlighting the importance of adoptability as a design
dimension for new protocols and providing new insights into proto-
col design, our research also highlights the importance of the prob-
lem of the selection of the initial adopter set in the deployment of
new protocols. This is a crucial step in the adoption process, and
yet there has been little quantitative research to date into the best
models and heuristics for approaching this problem. We hope that
our initial approach will open the ﬁeld to more focused efforts into
this important subproblem.
10. LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK
While our methodology makes necessary assumptions to facili-
tate tractable simulation and analysis, it remains the ﬁrst quantita-
tive approach to measure adoptability in Internet protocols. In this
section we revisit some important assumptions made earlier in the
paper.
We intuit in Section 4, that trafﬁc security is the economic incen-
tive for ASes adopting secure BGP protocols. However, adoption
decisions for an AS may involve complex economic and political
factors, which are difﬁcult to model. Similarly, accurately model-
ing the cost of a secure BGP protocol is also difﬁcult; for example,
soBGP requires exposing all neighboring information, including
peering information, to other adopting ASes. On the other hand,
peering information can be highly valued by some ASes [13], thus
the cost of adopting soBGP for these ASes may be higher than oth-
ers. Even with these simplifying assumptions on BGP protocol, we
believe that our model considers the important factors affecting the
adoption process. Furthermore, the model can be easily extended
to other ﬂedgling Internet protocols such as DNSSEC [2], etc.
Another limitation of our methodology is that, although the crit-
ical threshold values can be used for qualitative comparisons be-
tween protocols, their actual numerical value does not map onto
any directly measurable quantity. For example, we are unable to
translate a critical threshold to a dollar amount or map it to a mean-
ingful numerical prediction about the absolute likelihood of adop-
tion of either scheme.
One way to make direct quantitative comparisons between pro-
tocols is to introduce a (strong) linearity assumption. Suppose pro-
tocol A has a critical threshold 10× higher than protocol B. How-
ever, protocol B is somehow able to make the claim that, in most
contexts, the switching costs to adopt B is k times lower than the
switching costs for A. In particular assume that the distribution of
switching thresholds for B is similar to the distribution of switching
thresholds for A, but linearly scaled k times smaller. With such an
assumption we can now compare the relative likelihoods of adop-
tion for the two schemes. We know that adoption will proceed if the
switching cost is below the critical threshold. If k = 10, then, since
both the critical threshold and the distribution of switching costs are
10 times lower for B than A, the two schemes have roughly equal
likelihoods of adoption. However, if k  10, then B is more likely to
be adopted than A.
This ﬂavor of result, although laden with strong assumptions and
hence acceptable only as a very rough estimate, is nonetheless cur-
rently the only known method in which qualitative security prop-
erties can be quantitatively compared. It is hoped that with reﬁne-
ments of this technique, conﬁdence in the assumptions can be im-
proved, and the signiﬁcance of the numerical difference between
critical threshold can be increased.

by an attacker against S-BGP are no longer a subset of the at-
tacks on soBGP: for example a route could be forged involving
non-adopters of security that would be accepted by S-BGP but re-
jected by soBGP. With such an assumption, the relative strengths of
the two classes of security properties would be uncertain for differ-
ent deployment contexts. Examination of their critical thresholds
would help inform the researcher as to the relative effectiveness of
each class in driving adoption.
The presentation of adoptability as a measurable metric for pro-
tocol design allows for a new perspective on protocol design. Re-
searchers may now consider the adoption dynamics of a protocol
during the design process, and optimize for protocols that have the
highest adoptability for the lowest costs. Adoptability is an attrac-
tive metric not only because it allows us to directly compare qual-
itative properties, but also in terms of its association with feasibil-
ity: a protocol with strong properties that does not get adopted is
not as desirable as a protocol with weaker properties, but does get
adopted.
As an example, one possible way in which speciﬁc adoption
dynamics may be designed into the protocol is the possibility of
protocols that support staged deployment. In this setting, a mod-
ular protocol is deployed in multiple stages. By breaking up the
sharp transition from legacy to new protocol into a series of small
stages, a protocol can turn a prohibitively expensive transition sce-
nario into a sequence of incentives-compatible steps, thus greatly
enhancing its adoptability. Figure 13 illustrates this process. The
graphs show a typical AS’s decision process, with beneﬁts on the
x-axis, which determine whether or not the protocol is deployed
(y-axis).
In a typical monolithic protocol, deployment is all-or-
nothing, as shown in the sharp step function in Figure 13a—at any
point where beneﬁts outweigh the transition cost, the AS will de-
cide to deploy the protocol. However, if the current beneﬁts are
below the transition cost, as shown on the diagram, then the AS
will decide not to deploy the protocol. If this is the case for all
ASes in the Internet then the protocol has stalled in its deployment.
Figure 13 shows what might happen in the protocol was designed
in a series of mutually-supportive modular phases. Each module
has its own incremental transition cost, which provides incremen-
tally increasing capabilities and greater beneﬁts for the next phase.
The adoption process is thus facilitated since at every phase, the
incremental beneﬁts of moving onto the next phase outweigh the
incremental transition costs. Hence such a protocol would provide
a solution to the coordination problem where social beneﬁt is max-
imized if all ASes switch to the new protocol, but no AS wants to
be the ﬁrst to commit to the costly switch.
11. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we argue that it is important to consider the di-
mension of adoptability in protocol design. We present the follow-
ing formulation: a protocol’s adoptability corresponds to the space
of incentives compatible adoption scenarios that yield widespread
adoption under given assumptions. We propose a simulation method-
ology to explore and characterize this space under a range of as-
sumptions and contexts, including multiple attacker models, dif-
ferent initial adopter sets, different network models and different
security metrics.
In the process of applying this methodology to the known BGP
security schemes to date, we have created a taxonomy for classi-
fying and distinguishing the security properties of a wide range of
protocols under partial deployments. Such a taxonomy has also
been lacking to date; our new taxonomy enables us to model both
existing protocols and variations that do not correspond to any pub-
lished protocol, yielding interesting design points that have not
been explored in the literature, but have good adoptability proper-
ties under certain conditions (e.g., OA+1 under the Strong Attacker
Model).
Using our methodology, we make the following observations
about the adoption dynamics of BGP security: (1) all known BGP
security schemes experience critical threshold dynamics under all
the simulation models we tested; when the switching threshold
(transition cost) was above the critical threshold, very little adop-
tion took place. In contrast, when the switching threshold was be-
low the critical threshold, the system eventually converged to full
adoption; (2) under the Strong Attacker Model, OA+1 yields com-
parable adoptability compared with schemes with full AS PATH
security. This is surprising because OA+1 possesses weak security
properties and yet drives this high level of adoptability; (3) under
the Weak Attacker Model, Path Authentication experiences a sig-
niﬁcant increase in adoptability, greatly outperforming the lower
classes of security schemes. Furthermore, RPI yields only slightly
better adoptability than Path Authentication, indicating that the ad-
vantages of RPI are not as signiﬁcant as expected; (4) while it is
clear that a larger set of initial adopters always serves to increase
the critical threshold, it is unclear how to select this initial set un-
der various constraints. This would be a fruitful area for future
research.
