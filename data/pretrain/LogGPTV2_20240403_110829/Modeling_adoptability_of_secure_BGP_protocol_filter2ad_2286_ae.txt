### Introduction and Context
Thus far, the discussion of the simulation results has centered on coarse-grained, ordering-based comparisons of the critical thresholds of various protocols. Even such coarse-grained comparisons are valuable because they can provide an ordered ranking for a previously unordered set of security properties. In some cases, the ordering of these security properties is straightforward. For instance, no attack that is possible against full path security (OA+1) is also possible against full path security. However, this is not always the case.

### Detailed Example: soBGP
Consider the scenario where soBGP performs routing topology verification. In this context, well-known and stable routes between non-adopters of soBGP are considered part of the normal topology against which routes are compared. In such a scenario, the attacks that can be performed are different from those in other scenarios. For example, an attack that could be carried out against S-BGP might be rejected by soBGP if it involves non-adopters of security.

### Simulation Results

The increase in adoptability indicates that full path security is highly valuable in driving protocol adoption under the weak attacker model. We conjecture that the significant difference in the effectiveness of full path security between the strong and weak attacker models is due to events in the early stages of adoption. Under the strong attacker model, as long as some node close to the originator (e.g., node C in Figure 9) is a non-adopter, the attacker retains a strong path-spoofing ability. This means that early in the adoption process, when few ASes have adopted the protocol, there are many points of vulnerability. This prevents full path security from being significantly more useful than origin authentication until a large fraction of the Internet has adopted the protocol.

In contrast, under the weak attacker model, a small number of early adopters can significantly improve the subsequent adoption benefits. Whenever an AS adopts the protocol, as long as the rest of the ASes between the originator and the newly adopting AS are secure, this reduces (by one hop) the spoofing capabilities of every malicious AS downstream. This improvement in security may be sufficient to drive further adoption in later iterations, thus continuing the adoption process even for values of the switching threshold that would have stalled adoption under the strong attacker model.

### Comparison of SPV and S-BGP
It was expected that SPV, with its Retroactive Path Integrity, would be more adoptable than S-BGP. However, the observed difference in their critical thresholds was small, indicating that Retroactive Path Integrity only slightly increases the adoptability of a protocol. This suggests that Retroactive Path Integrity may not be a feature that should be emphasized in future protocol research.

### Importance of Initial Adopter Selection
Our research highlights the importance of the selection of the initial adopter set in the deployment of new protocols. This is a crucial step in the adoption process, yet there has been little quantitative research into the best models and heuristics for this problem. We hope that our initial approach will encourage more focused efforts into this important subproblem.

### Limitations and Future Work
While our methodology makes necessary assumptions to facilitate tractable simulation and analysis, it remains the first quantitative approach to measure adoptability in Internet protocols. In Section 4, we intuit that traffic security is the economic incentive for ASes adopting secure BGP protocols. However, adoption decisions may involve complex economic and political factors, which are difficult to model. Similarly, accurately modeling the cost of a secure BGP protocol is challenging. For example, soBGP requires exposing all neighboring information, including peering information, to other adopting ASes. Peering information can be highly valued by some ASes, thus the cost of adopting soBGP for these ASes may be higher than for others. Despite these simplifying assumptions, we believe our model considers the important factors affecting the adoption process and can be extended to other fledgling Internet protocols like DNSSEC.

Another limitation is that while critical threshold values can be used for qualitative comparisons between protocols, their actual numerical value does not map onto any directly measurable quantity. For example, we cannot translate a critical threshold to a dollar amount or a meaningful numerical prediction about the absolute likelihood of adoption.

One way to make direct quantitative comparisons between protocols is to introduce a (strong) linearity assumption. Suppose protocol A has a critical threshold 10 times higher than protocol B. If protocol B can claim that, in most contexts, the switching costs to adopt B are k times lower than the switching costs for A, and the distribution of switching thresholds for B is similar to that for A but linearly scaled k times smaller, then we can compare the relative likelihoods of adoption. If k = 10, the two schemes have roughly equal likelihoods of adoption. If k > 10, then B is more likely to be adopted than A.

This method, although laden with strong assumptions, is currently the only known method for quantitatively comparing qualitative security properties. It is hoped that with refinements of this technique, confidence in the assumptions can be improved, and the significance of the numerical difference between critical thresholds can be increased.

### Staged Deployment
Staged deployment is another way to enhance adoptability. In this setting, a modular protocol is deployed in multiple stages, breaking up the sharp transition from legacy to new protocol into a series of small, incentives-compatible steps. This can turn a prohibitively expensive transition scenario into a sequence of manageable steps, thus greatly enhancing adoptability. Figure 13 illustrates this process, showing a typical AS's decision process with benefits on the x-axis and whether the protocol is deployed on the y-axis.

In a monolithic protocol, deployment is all-or-nothing, as shown in the sharp step function in Figure 13a. If the current benefits are below the transition cost, the AS will decide not to deploy the protocol. If this is the case for all ASes, the protocol stalls. In contrast, a staged protocol provides incremental benefits and costs, facilitating adoption at each phase.

### Conclusion
In this paper, we argue that the dimension of adoptability is crucial in protocol design. We present a formulation where a protocol's adoptability corresponds to the space of incentives-compatible adoption scenarios that yield widespread adoption under given assumptions. We propose a simulation methodology to explore and characterize this space under various assumptions and contexts, including multiple attacker models, different initial adopter sets, network models, and security metrics.

Applying this methodology to known BGP security schemes, we created a taxonomy for classifying and distinguishing the security properties of a wide range of protocols under partial deployments. Our observations include:
1. All known BGP security schemes experience critical threshold dynamics. When the switching threshold is above the critical threshold, very little adoption occurs. Below the critical threshold, the system converges to full adoption.
2. Under the Strong Attacker Model, OA+1 yields comparable adoptability to schemes with full AS PATH security, despite its weaker security properties.
3. Under the Weak Attacker Model, Path Authentication experiences a significant increase in adoptability, outperforming lower classes of security schemes. RPI yields only slightly better adoptability, indicating that its advantages are not as significant as expected.
4. While a larger set of initial adopters increases the critical threshold, selecting this initial set under various constraints remains an area for future research.
