**Title: BotConf 2020 - NanoCore Hunter: Tracking NanoCore Servers and Monitoring RAT Operator Behavior for 180 Days**

NanoCore RAT, which first appeared in 2013, continues to be actively used in 2020 due to its highly functional and user-friendly interface. In February and March of 2020, NanoCore RAT was employed in a malspam campaign related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our team successfully sinkholed the NanoCore Command and Control (C&C) domain, enabling us to monitor the activity of NanoCore C&C servers. Additionally, we conducted an experiment to lure NanoCore operators into a simulated enterprise network, allowing us to observe and analyze their real-time behavior over a period of 180 days.
