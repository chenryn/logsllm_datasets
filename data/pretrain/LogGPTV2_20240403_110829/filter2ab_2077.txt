title:botconf2020 NanoCore hunter: tracking NanoCore servers and watching behavior of RAT operators for 180 days
NanoCore RAT, which first appeared in 2013, is still actively used in 2020 for its highly functional and user-friendly interace. Around Feburary to March in 2020, NanoCore RAT was used in the malspam campaign on COVID-19. We managed to sinkhole the NanoCore C&C domain and have monitored the liveliness of NanoCore C&C servers. We also experimented luring NanoCore operators into our mimetic enterprise network and succeeded in monitoring the actual behavior of live NanoCore operators.
