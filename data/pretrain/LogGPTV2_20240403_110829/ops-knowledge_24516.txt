User: Why can't the application in the docker container connect to the external network? how to solve this problem?
Assistant: Probably because the Docker container is not properly configured for networking. You can solve this problem by the following steps: 1. Confirm whether there is a problem with the host network, for example, check whether the host can connect to the external network. 2. Configure the network for the container, and set the --net option to specify the network when using docker run. For example, use the --net=host option to use host networking directly, or use the --net=bridge option to specify that containers use bridge networking. 3. Check the internal network configuration of the container, such as whether the IP address, subnet mask, and gateway of the container are correct. 4. Check whether the firewall restricts container network access. You need to modify the firewall policy on the host to allow the container to access the external network. 5. Check whether the DNS resolution is normal, for example, use the ping command inside the container to check whether the DNS can be resolved. 6. Make sure that the external port is bound when the container starts. For example, use the command: docker run -p 8080:80 nginx where 8080 is the host port and 80 is the container port. 7. Check network faults and debug problems, for example, use the docker logs command to view log information, or use the docker top command to view container network process information.
