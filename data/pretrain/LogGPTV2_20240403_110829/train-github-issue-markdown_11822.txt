It appears that you are encountering an issue when attempting to serialize a model that was created using `multi_gpu_model` from Keras with TensorFlow-GPU 1.11.0 and Keras 2.2.4. The error occurs during the serialization process, specifically when trying to save the model.

Here is a more detailed and structured version of your code and the error traceback:

### Code
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from keras.utils import multi_gpu_model
from keras.models import Model
from keras.optimizers import Adam
from keras.losses import binary_crossentropy

# Assuming `model` is your base model
gpu_model = multi_gpu_model(model, gpus=2)

# Compile the model for multi-GPU training
gpu_model.compile(
    loss="binary_crossentropy",
    optimizer=Adam(),  # Example optimizer, replace with your actual optimizer
    metrics=["accuracy"]
)

# Train the model (fit method)
# ...

# Serialize the model
print("[INFO] Serializing model...")
gpu_model.save(config.MODEL_PATH, overwrite=True)
```

### Error Traceback

TypeError: can't pickle module objects
```

### Explanation
The error `TypeError: can't pickle module objects` indicates that there is an issue with pickling (serializing) some part of the model. This is often due to the fact that the `multi_gpu_model` wraps the original model in a way that makes it difficult to serialize directly.

### Solution
To resolve this issue, you should save the underlying single-GPU model instead of the multi-GPU model. Here's how you can do it:

```python
# Save the underlying single-GPU model
print("[INFO] Serializing model...")
model.save(config.MODEL_PATH, overwrite=True)
```

By saving the `model` instead of `gpu_model`, you avoid the issues related to the multi-GPU wrapper and ensure that the model can be serialized correctly.
