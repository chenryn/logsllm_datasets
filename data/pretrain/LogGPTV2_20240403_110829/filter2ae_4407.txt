### 0x01 Summary
Discuz! X is a high-performance, feature-rich, and secure forum software built using PHP and MySQL. On September 29, 2017, Discuz! fixed a vulnerability that allowed front-end users to delete arbitrary files. This vulnerability was first reported to Wooyun in June 2014 and later included in the Seebug Vulnerability Database with the identifier ssvid-93588. The issue arises from the ability to configure attribute values, leading to arbitrary file deletion. Although the primary exploitation method has been patched, it may still be bypassed by simulating file uploads.

### 0x02 Reproduction
To reproduce the vulnerability:
1. Log in to the Discuz! front-end account.
2. Create a new `test.txt` file in the current directory for testing.
3. Send a request to `home.php?mod=spacecp&ac=profile&op=base` with the following POST data:
   ```plaintext
   birthprovince=../../../test.txt&profilesubmit=1&formhash=b644603b
   ```
   - `formhash` is a user-specific hash.
4. If the modification is successful, the place of birth will be set to `../../../test.txt`.
5. Construct a request to upload a file to `home.php?mod=spacecp&ac=profile&op=base` (a normal image file is sufficient).
6. After the request, the `test.txt` file will be deleted.

### 0x03 Vulnerability Analysis
The vulnerability was addressed in the `upload/source/include/spacecp/spacecp_profile.php` file. Specifically, at line 70, the code checks if the `profilesubmit` form is submitted. If so, it proceeds to line 177, where it evaluates the `formtype` configuration. If the `formtype` matches certain conditions, the code enters the deletion logic. The critical part is at line 228, where the `unlink` function is used to delete the file:
```php
@unlink(getglobal('setting/attachdir') . './profile/' . $space[$key]);
```
By backtracking the conditions, we find that when a file is uploaded successfully, the `unlink` statement is executed. The `$space[$key]` variable is derived from the user's personal settings, such as `birthprovince`. By directly submitting the settings page, the field content limitation can be bypassed, allowing for arbitrary file deletion.

### 0x04 Conclusion
After the update, further analysis revealed that the vulnerability was initially reported to Wooyun in 2014 with the identifier wooyun-2014-065513. Due to an incomplete patching process, the vulnerability resurfaced. The manufacturer only patched the specific attack vector, leaving the underlying issue unresolved. This led to the vulnerability being exploited years later. Eventually, Discuz! removed the vulnerable code entirely. This incident highlights the importance of thorough security practices and the need for continuous improvement in addressing vulnerabilities.
