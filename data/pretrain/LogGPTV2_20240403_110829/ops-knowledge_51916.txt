User: I am writing a script in python3 for Ubuntu that should be executed all X Minutes and should automatic start after logging in. Therefore I want to create a daemon (is it the right solution for that?) but I haven't found any modules / examples for python3, just for python 2.X. Do you know something what I can work with?
Thank you,
Assistant: Suppose for python script name is monitor. use following steps:  

copy monitor script in /usr/local/bin/ (not necessary)
Also add a copy in /etc/init.d/ 
Then execute following command to make it executable
sudo -S chmod "a+x" "/etc/init.d/monitor"
At last run update.rc command 
sudo -S update-rc.d "monitor"  "defaults" "98"

this will execute you monitor whenever you login for all tty.
