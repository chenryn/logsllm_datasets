User: Please briefly describe the principle of DNS-based load balancing, and provide a DNS-based load balancing solution.
Assistant: The principle of DNS-based load balancing is to achieve load balancing by dispersing or directing domain name resolution requests to different servers. One of the DNS-based load balancing solutions is to configure multiple A records in the DNS server, each record corresponds to an IP address, and monitor the load status of each server. When the load of a server is too high, modify the DNS The A record in the server redirects the corresponding request to other servers with lighter load, so as to achieve the effect of load balancing. It should be noted that in order to ensure the effectiveness of load balancing, cache update and expiration mechanisms, as well as the processing of offline servers, need to be done.
