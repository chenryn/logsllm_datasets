**Title: Botconf 2015 - DGA Clustering and Analysis: Mastering Modern, Evolving Threats**

**Abstract:**

Conficker was the first to introduce Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) to the malware landscape. Today, DGAs have become a fundamental component of modern malware. Malware researchers have employed various tools and techniques to address this issue, with varying degrees of success.

In this presentation, we will introduce a method for analyzing samples from a specific malware family that employs DGA techniques. Our approach is effective regardless of the DGA initialization vector and does not require reverse engineering (RE). This method enables cluster-based analysis, automatically ranks potential sinkhole domains, and facilitates the analysis of entire malware families or specific campaigns.

We will demonstrate the proof of concept (POC) of our system using the Tinba malware family as a case study. This demonstration will highlight the connections between different campaigns and present compelling results. Most importantly, we will discuss how to leverage the insights gained from this analysis to develop more sophisticated protections against similar malware.
