### Title: 100 Seconds of Solitude: Defeating Cisco Trust Anchor with FPGA Bitstream Shenanigans

**Abstract:**

First commercially introduced in 2013, the Cisco Trust Anchor Module (TAm) is a proprietary hardware security module used in a wide range of Cisco products, including enterprise routers, switches, and firewalls. The TAm serves as the foundational root of trust, underpinning all other Cisco security and trustworthy computing mechanisms in these devices.

In this paper, we disclose two zero-day vulnerabilities and present a remotely exploitable attack chain that reliably bypasses the Cisco Trust Anchor. We provide an in-depth analysis of the TAm from both theoretical and practical perspectives, highlighting a series of architectural and practical flaws. We also discuss the limitations in current state-of-the-art offensive capabilities that initially made the TAm design appear secure.

Using the Cisco 1001-X series of Trust Anchor-enabled routers as a demonstrative platform, we conduct a detailed analysis of the current TAm implementation. This includes results obtained through hardware reverse engineering, Trust Anchor FPGA bitstream analysis, and the reverse engineering of numerous Cisco trustworthy computing mechanisms that depend on the TAm.

We then present two zero-day vulnerabilities within Cisco IOS and the TAm, and demonstrate a remotely exploitable attack chain that results in the persistent compromise of an up-to-date Cisco router. Our TAm bypass involves novel methods of reliably manipulating FPGA functionality through bitstream analysis and modification, circumventing the need for RTL reconstruction. These techniques create numerous possibilities for the exploitation of embedded systems that use FPGAs.

While this presentation focuses on the application of our FPGA manipulation techniques in the context of the Cisco Trust Anchor, we also briefly discuss other potential uses of our bitstream modification techniques.
