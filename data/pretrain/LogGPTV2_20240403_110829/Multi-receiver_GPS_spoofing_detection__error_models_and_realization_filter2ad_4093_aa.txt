ABSTRACT
Spooﬁng is a serious threat to the widespread use of Global
Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSSs) such as GPS and can
be expected to play an important role in the security of many
future IoT systems that rely on time, location, or navigation
information.
In this paper, we focus on the technique of
multi-receiver GPS spooﬁng detection, so far only proposed
theoretically. This technique promises to detect malicious
spooﬁng signals by making use of the reported positions of
several GPS receivers deployed in a ﬁxed constellation.
We scrutinize the assumptions of prior work, in particu-
lar the error models, and investigate how these models and
their results can be improved due to the correlation of errors
at co-located receiver positions. We show that by leverag-
ing spatial noise correlations, the false acceptance rate of
the countermeasure can be improved while preserving the
sensitivity to attacks. As a result, receivers can be placed
signiﬁcantly closer together than previously expected, which
broadens the applicability of the countermeasure. Based on
theoretical and practical investigations, we build the ﬁrst
realization of a multi-receiver countermeasure and experi-
mentally evaluate its performance both in authentic and in
spooﬁng scenarios.

INTRODUCTION
In recent years, the Global Positioning System (GPS) has
become a ubiquitous source of location, time, and naviga-
tion information for devices such as navigation units, mobile
phones, industrial control systems, ﬁnancial trading plat-
forms, trains, ships, and ankle bracelets for criminals. Lo-

calization services such as GPS are also expected to play
an important role in the context of the upcoming Internet
of Things (IoT) and cyber-physical systems as they often
involve mobile or time-dependent components, e. g., for au-
tonomous driving. Unfortunately, Global Navigation Satel-
lite Systems (GNSSs) are susceptible to spooﬁng attacks, in
which a malicious transmitter emits manipulated signals im-
itating real satellites. A spooﬁng attack can cause a victim’s
GNSS receiver to compute a wrong location and/or time so-
lution. As a result, an attacker may remotely inject fake
data into security- and safety-relevant systems.
In response to this threat, increasingly sophisticated meth-
ods for spooﬁng detection have been developed and were
analyzed to enable the real-time identiﬁcation of ongoing
spooﬁng attacks, e. g., [1,2,5,8,12–14,16,20–22]. These coun-
termeasures can be categorized in two classes. The ﬁrst set
of countermeasures is based on receiver observables [12, 33]
such as the number of visible satellites, clock and date in-
formation, received signal strength measurements from the
satellites, and veriﬁcation of digital signatures (if available).
In [8], these countermeasures are classiﬁed as data-bit level
detection techniques. The second type of countermeasures
focuses on the signal-processing level. These countermea-
sures require custom receivers with elaborate signal pro-
cessing techniques and enhanced hardware. With custom
receivers, spooﬁng attacks can be detected, e. g., by esti-
mating the angle-of-arrival of navigation signals [13], their
carrier phases [20, 21], random antenna motion [14, 22], or
automatic gain control on the radio frontend [1].
However, the attacker model used in many of these coun-
termeasures considers single-antenna attackers that may not
make use of elaborate signal processing and mixing tech-
niques. We argue that an attacker with, e. g., an adaptable
GPS simulator, can generate spooﬁng signals with arbitrary
precision in data and signal characteristics such as the imita-
tion of satellite constellations, transmission power, and other
physical-layer characteristics. In addition, public GPS data
is not protected by signatures, so an equipped attacker can
also spoof the data content of the navigation messages.
We therefore advocate the use of a detection measure that
leverage signal properties which are impossible to spoof cor-
rectly for nearby or terrestrial attackers. In this work, we
focus on multi(ple)-receiver GPS spooﬁng detection [29] and
perform its ﬁrst practical evaluation. The detection is based
on the location reported by two or more commercial-oﬀ-
the-shelf (COTS) receivers mounted in a ﬁxed formation.
During an attack, a single-antenna attacker would spoof re-
ceivers to the exact same position solution, which can be
237
used to detect the attack. It has been shown that—from a
certain number of receivers onwards—even a multi-antenna
attacker cannot succeed in maintaining a ﬁxed formation, re-
spectively the relative distances, during the attack [29]. This
leads to the fact that this detection technique is principally
unspoofable as long as the attacker signals are received at all
receiving devices (which is hard to prevent if the receivers
are positioned close enough together).
A beneﬁt of the multi-receiver detection mechanism is that
it can be realized with COTS receivers without changes
to the GPS infrastructure. The performance of the coun-
termeasure is expected to depend on the chosen distances
between the receivers, as in practice the location is inﬂu-
enced by noise. Based on a rough estimation of required
distances, the authors of [29] suggested application settings
such as cargo ships or trucks. Following theoretic investiga-
tions [5, 26], performance values for distances between 10 m
to 50 m were derived analytically. As a result, the counter-
measure does not seem suitable for most moving vehicles,
but can only be applicable for large stationary installations.
To the best of our knowledge, the multi-receiver counter-
measure has not been practically investigated and validated
against real spooﬁng setups. In this work, we analyze the
models used in [5] and [26] and show that (i) nearby real-
world GPS receivers have correlated noise on their location
estimates, (ii) previous error models over-estimate the loca-
tion error in the attack case, and (iii) considering correlated
errors can drastically reduces the expected false detection
rate of the countermeasure while preserving the sensitivity
to attacks. As a result, a distance of 3 m to 5 m can be ex-
pected to be suﬃcient (in contrast to 10 m to 50 m) as we
show by simulations and experiments (for the same perfor-
mance criteria).
We validate our theoretical predictions using an experi-
mental setup with several receivers and a GPS satellite sig-
nal generator as spoofer, and we provide in-depth insights on
parameters and setups for a reliable operation of the coun-
termeasure.
In summary, our work contains the following
contributions:
• We extend previous theoretical work on multi-receiver
spooﬁng countermeasures by modeling distance-related
errors with the goal to diﬀerentiate between error dis-
tributions during normal operation and under attack.
• We experimentally provide estimates of practical local-
ization noise in normal operation as well as in spooﬁng
scenarios showing that the noise is spatially correlated.
• We leverage these insights to show that the multi-
receiver spooﬁng countermeasures can be used reliably
in formations which are almost an order of magnitude
smaller than previously proposed (area of formation).
• We experimentally demonstrate that our countermea-
sure prototype can reliably detect real spooﬁng signals
utilizing four receivers in a mutual distance of 5 m.
Our investigations and results demonstrate the applica-
bility of the countermeasure and will help users or engineers
to set it up accordingly. The countermeasure may be used
in static setups, e. g., in factories to prevent time spooﬁng,
as well as in mobile settings, e. g., on vehicles such as trucks
or airplanes to prevent location and navigation spooﬁng. As
an extension, we also envisage its use for highly mobile se-
tups such as drone formations. The evaluation framework
can serve as baseline for further investigations.

ToA determines the localization result, exemplary
for two receivers and four satellites. Right: An at-
tacker generates spoofed signals for all four satellites
with some relative ToA. At each victim, the spoofed
signals have identical relative ToAs, but are overall
oﬀset due to victims’ distances to the attacker.
2. GPS SPOOFING AND DETECTION
We start by brieﬂy introducing GPS, errors in GPS, the
considered attacker model, and the concept of multi-receiver
spooﬁng detection. In general, the spooﬁng attacks and our
countermeasure should apply to any GNSS. In the context
of this work, we focus on GPS as its receivers and signal
generation devices are readily available. For a detailed de-
scription of GPS we refer to [6, 11, 25].
2.1 GPS and GPS Spooﬁng
GPS is based on measurements of the time of arrival (ToA)
of signals sent by four or more satellites from medium earth
orbit. Based on the ToA of the individual satellite signals, a
pseudo-distance to each satellite can be computed. Based on
these pseudo-distances and the periodically embedded satel-
lite positions, a receiver can use multilateration to ﬁnd its
local position and time (see Figure 1). The ToA measure-
ment for each signal is aﬀected by a range of errors, which
we discuss in more detail in Section 2.2.
GPS provides two types of signals: (i) public GPS sig-
nals that can be received (and generated) by everyone with
suitable equipment, and (ii) military GPS signals that are
protected by (at least) secret spreading codes. In this work,
we focus on attacks and countermeasures for civilian sig-
nals, but we note that the underlying spooﬁng problem of
falsifying ToA of signals cannot be fully prevented by secret
spreading codes alone.
Spooﬁng attacks are based on the broadcast of false GNSS
signals in order to change the localization and time result
of a victim [7, 26, 29].
In this work, we focus on spooﬁng
attacks that target the ToA of signals and use otherwise
the same data content as real signals. These signals can be
generated by replaying previously recorded GPS signals or
by using a satellite simulator. Attacks that also change the
data content of the signals are discussed in [15].
2.2 GPS Error Sources
As GPS errors take a critical role in our countermeasure,
we discuss them in more detail. While the GPS localization
accuracy is suﬃcient to estimate a position within a few
meters radius, the system suﬀers under errors aﬀecting the
deviation from the actual location. Due to the signal gener-

ation in space and a travel distance of more than 20,000 km,
GPS signals are aﬀected by various error sources that can
be categorized into three groups [6]: satellite, propagation
medium, and receiver errors (see Table 1).
Satellite errors. Errors can arise from the satellite itself
in regard to clock biases and orbital drifts. For error mitiga-
tion the adjustable ephemeris data sent out by each satellite
include an estimation of the error characteristics.
Signal propagation errors. Environmental eﬀects such as
ionospheric or tropospheric refractions are dependent on the
physical conditions on the propagation path. When GPS sig-
nals reach the earth’s surface they are potentially reﬂected
at obstacles leading to multipath eﬀects that decrease the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).
Receiver errors. In addition to normal receiver noise (e. g.,
thermal noise in components), the receiver can suﬀer under
clock biases and center phase variations.
The combined error of all presented sources is summarized
in the User Equivalent Range Error (UERE) [25, p. 298]. A
quantifying analysis is conducted in [18]; its results in terms
of total error are given in Table 1. The given values are based
on a 1σ-probability level relating to the deviation in meter.
In order to evaluate the quality of the position solution, error
contributions can be estimated and periodically embedded
in the navigation message [18].
2.3 System and Attacker Model
We consider the following attacker model. The goal of
the attacker is to change the localization or time result of
one or more victims. The attacker is capable of generating
fake GPS signals with the same signal characteristics as au-
thentic GPS signals. We distinguish between two scenarios
for the attacker antennas: (i) a single-antenna attacker and
(ii) a multi-antenna attacker. In the ﬁrst case, the attacker
is restricted to a single-antenna setup, where all spooﬁng
signals are sent from the same source. In the second case,
the attacker can utilize multiple antennas to have more free-
dom for the transmission of signals and can send potentially
diﬀerent signals from various locations.
In this work, we assume that all receivers obtain signals
from the same sources, i. e., receivers are not shielded from
the reception of signals seen by other receivers. We gener-
alize our approach to protect against a single-antenna at-
tacker as well as a multiple-antenna attacker. As shown in
related work [29, 32], a single-antenna attacker can success-
fully spoof individual victims to an arbitrary location and
time by sending spooﬁng signals that have constant rela-
tive ToA with respect to each other, independently of the
location of the receiver (see Figure 1). As a result, multi-
239
ple receivers in range of the attacker all compute the same
localization result (with minor time diﬀerences due to their
respective distances to the attacker).
For the multi-antenna adversary model, spooﬁng individ-
ual position solutions for less than four receivers becomes
theoretically possible. We would like to stress that such an
attacker was only theoretically proposed in [29], but no prac-
tical implementations are known. Theoretically, an attacker
can generate and synchronize its antennas to adjust the ToA
of signals at each victim receiver. Practically, implementing
such an attack successfully is expected to be very challeng-
ing, as there are tight constraints on signal power and align-
ment [29]. We discuss the resilience of our countermeasure
to a multi-antenna attack in Section 8.
The problem of taking over an established lock, i. e., the
problem of taking over a victim’s ﬁx to authentic GPS sig-
nals, is out of scope of this work. In order to induce a new ﬁx
onto the spoofed signals (i. e., to replace legitimate signals),
an attacker needs to force a lock loss of the establish ﬁx,
e. g., by prior jamming or high spooﬁng power [31]. Since our
countermeasure is based on the position information, we can
give the attacker the power to overcome prominent signal-
based countermeasures such as RAIM [12], signal power [33],
or angle-of-arrival [13] discrimination.
2.4 Multi-Receiver Spooﬁng Detection
Conceptually, a multi-receiver spooﬁng countermeasure
detects GPS spooﬁng attacks based on the location reported
by two (or more) COTS receivers at ﬁxed known positions.
The receivers periodically compare their distances of the cal-
culated locations, e. g., using wired connections. In case of
authentic signals, the computed distances are expected to be
rather stable and close to the physical distances of the given
formation.
In case of an attack, the computed distances
will shrink to values close to zero, as the receivers would re-
port the same location during a single-antenna spooﬁng at-
tack. Two receivers in appropriate distance to each other are
suﬃcient to detect single-antenna attacks; a multi-receiver
countermeasure with at least four receivers can also detect
attacks from multiple locations (Section 8). As it only uses
the localization result, a beneﬁcial property of this coun-
termeasure is that it does not require any modiﬁcation of
standard COTS receivers.
In this work, we provide detailed theoretical models and
experimental validation to ﬁnd the required distances and
detection thresholds for bringing the multi-receiver counter-
measure to practice (see Figure 2). Being able to deploy the
receivers closer together has two advantages: (i) it broad-
ens the number of possible application scenarios and (ii) it
makes attacks based on individual spooﬁng (separate signals
for each receiver and shielding other receivers from recep-
tion) harder to achieve.
3. PRACTICAL SPOOFING DETECTION
We now introduce our detection mechanism and argue
that its performance depends on (i) the physical formation
of the receivers, and (ii) on the position solution noise ex-
perienced by the receivers. We then discuss both factors in
more detail.
In particular, we predict that authentic sig-
nals and attacker signals have diﬀerent noise characteristics,
which can be used to improve the performance of the coun-
termeasure.
Since we only consider the relative distances between re-
ceivers, we can detail (1) to directly take the set of distances
di,j as input:
2 H0≷
H1
f (di,j) :=f /0di,j11≤i,j≤m
i<j
λ.
(2)
If the result of function f on the distances between the
receivers falls below the threshold λ, the test indicates a
spooﬁng attack (H1). However, if the result is above the
threshold λ, the test decides for no spooﬁng (H0). Notably,
since the absolute positions contained in (1) are not crucial
for our spooﬁng detection, there is no information loss from
(1) to (2). Hence, we can safely use (2), which contains all
distances clearly deﬁning the underlying formation.
Figure 2: Multi-receiver spooﬁng detection system
set up in a ﬁxed formation. All receivers periodi-
cally compare their mutual distances. Normal oper-
ation: Distances will be constant (with minor vari-
ations due to noise). Spooﬁng: Locations will coin-
cide (again, with some noise).
3.1 Detection Mechanism
We assume that two (or more) GPS receivers are set up
in a known static formation. All receivers are continuously
obtaining their location via GPS, and a central controller
uses the locations to detect spooﬁng cases. Basically, our
detection mechanism compares the reported receiver loca-
tions in order to perform a binary classiﬁcation into authen-
tic/spoofed situations. This decision is probabilistic and
considers the predeﬁned receiver formation, its ﬁxed rela-
tive distances, and the noise characteristics of the receivers.
The detection model is based on work in [26–28]; it distin-
guishes between two potential detection outcomes based on
the presence of an attack. The considered hypotheses H0
and H1 are:
H0: No spooﬁng occurred.
H1: Spooﬁng is performed.
The decision making is based on the preservation of known
receiver distances. If the system detects signiﬁcant anoma-
lies, the test should indicate a spooﬁng attack. In contrast
to the absolute positions in [27], our detection is based on
relative distances between all pairs of receivers. The mecha-
nism is a function of the reported position information and
a comparison against a decision threshold λ to be deﬁned.
The adapted test can be formally expressed as:
f (P1, . . . ,P m)
H0≷
H1
λ,
(1)
where m denotes the number of receivers and their respec-
tive position is Pi, i ∈{ 1, . . . , m} and f () is a function on
the distances. Each position Pi consists of a latitude and
a longitude component. The position also contains altitude
information, which is neglected here due to the low precision
