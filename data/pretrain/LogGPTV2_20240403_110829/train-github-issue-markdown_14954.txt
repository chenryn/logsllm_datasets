**Current behavior**  
Binding to an input's type causes number value accessor in forms to not work
as expected.
**Expected behavior**  
Same as when not binding to the input's type.
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**
  1. Run Plunker
  2. Enter number in left input, note "Type of age" is number.
  3. Modify number in right input, note "Type of age" is now a string.
**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**  
I would be more convenient to not have to parse the string. In a simple form,
parsing the string into a number is not a problem. The problem arises when you
have more complex forms that are being generated at run-time. Ideally, once a
form is valid, I want to be able to just access it's value, JSON stringify it,
and POST it to some API without having to muck about with it.

I don't think it matters for this issue.
