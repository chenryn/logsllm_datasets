This results in a brand new init of a React Native project template failing on
`yarn tsc --noEmit -p .` as raised in this issue here: react-native-
community/react-native-template-typescript#203
As of right now, the solution is to patch one of the two type libraries to
remove the `AbortSignal` and `AbortController` definitions.
