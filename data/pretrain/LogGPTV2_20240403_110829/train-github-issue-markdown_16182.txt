Hi !
Could it be possible to add a transformer for JSX that outputs a Javascript
"normal" string ?  
For example, this:
    let foo = "Hello world !";
    let bar = (
            {foo}
    );
would be transformed to:
    let foo = "Hello world";
    let test = "" +  foo + "";
I'm not sure if it goes into the scope of the project, since one could use the
`preserve` option and use an additional transpiler, but I think it could help
users write components & templates for any library (Vuejs, Ractive, ...),
instead of just React.
