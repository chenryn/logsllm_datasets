## Abstract
The proliferation of mobile computing has led to a significant rise in mobile gambling scams. These scams involve the delivery of fraudulent messages through instant messaging, hosting scam platforms on mobile apps, and using mobile payment channels. Despite causing daily losses estimated at over $522,262 USD, there is limited quantitative knowledge about how these scams operate. This paper presents the first empirical study based on ground-truth data from 1,461 scam incident reports and 1,487 gambling scam apps between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2020. Our qualitative and quantitative analysis characterizes the operational pipeline and full fraud kill chain of mobile gambling scams. We examine the social engineering techniques used by scammers and their effectiveness. Our systematic analysis of 1,068 confirmed Android and 419 iOS scam apps includes their development frameworks, declared permissions, compatibility, and backend network infrastructure. Surprisingly, we found that public online app generators have been misused to develop gambling scam apps. Our study also uncovers several payment channels, including a new type of money mule-based payment channel with an average daily gambling deposit of $400,000 USD. Our findings provide a better understanding of the mobile gambling scam ecosystem and suggest potential ways to disrupt these activities.

## 1. Introduction
Gambling scams are a prevalent form of online fraud where scammers offer false advantages in gambling activities to trick players out of money. These scams have caused substantial financial losses, such as the Canadian Lottery scam, which netted over $5 billion from U.S. victims and generated around £500,000 per month in the U.K. In China, online gambling scams have the highest per-capita financial loss among all types of scams.

With the rapid growth and popularity of mobile markets, gambling scams have extended to mobile computing. In mobile gambling scams, scammers deliver fraudulent messages via instant messaging (IM) and host scam platforms on mobile apps, preventing victims from cashing out their winnings. Unlike web-based scams, mobile gambling scams use mobile-side social engineering attacks, exploit mobile payment channels, and employ mobile computing techniques to bypass traditional fraud detection methods. Previous studies on web-based scams have focused on detecting scam gateway sites, identifying scam campaigns, or analyzing the lifetime of scam websites. However, these studies lack visibility into the full kill chain of gambling scams, such as the social engineering tactics, modus operandi of the scam platform, and financial profitability.

This paper presents the first systematic study of mobile gambling scams based on a ground-truth dataset. The dataset includes 1,461 scam incident reports and 1,487 gambling scam apps, provided by an anonymous authority. Using this data, we conduct a qualitative analysis of the incident reports and develop measurement and reverse-engineering tools to uncover the mobile-based kill chain of gambling scams. Specifically, we aim to answer the following questions:
- What social engineering techniques do scammers use in mobile gambling scams?
- How do scammers operate gambling scam apps?
- How do they provide evasive payment channels under strict financial censorship?

## 2. Background
A gambling scam is a type of cybercrime that tricks victims out of money in gambling activities such as poker, casinos, and sports betting. Modern gambling scams often prevent victims from cashing out their winnings. For example, when victims try to withdraw their winnings, they may be told that their accounts are frozen or that they need to pay exorbitant fees. Our study focuses on gambling scam activities, and the legality of gambling is outside the scope of this research.

With the shift from the internet to mobile devices, gambling scams increasingly occur through mobile apps rather than websites. Figure 1 illustrates the operational pipeline of mobile gambling scams, which consists of four stages: connection establishment, app delivery, gambling deposit, and scamming.

### 2.1 Operational Pipeline of Mobile Gambling Scams
1. **Connection Establishment:** A scammer initiates the attack by establishing a connection with a victim, often through popular social media apps like dating or job hunting apps.
2. **App Delivery:** The scammer lures the victim to download a scam gambling app by offering a "too-good-to-be-true" bonus.
3. **Gambling Deposit:** Once the victim downloads the app, they fund their account via various payment channels embedded in the app.
4. **Scamming:** The scammer baits the victim to continually deposit more money by offering higher returns, then locks the victim's account to prevent them from withdrawing their winnings.

## 3. Ground-Truth Data
We collaborated closely with an anonymous authority to obtain a comprehensive dataset of 1,461 scam incident reports, 1,068 Android gambling scam apps, and 419 iOS apps, spanning from January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020. All scam victims in this dataset were located in China.

### 3.1 Breakdown of the Ground-Truth Dataset
| Type | Number |
|------|--------|
| Scam Incident Reports | 1,461 |
| Android Gambling Scam Apps | 1,068 |
| iOS Gambling Scam Apps | 419 |

## 4. Contributions
- **Empirical Study:** We conduct the first in-depth empirical study of mobile gambling scams based on ground-truth data, investigating the kill chain and actors involved.
- **Social Engineering Techniques:** We reveal the social engineering techniques used by scammers through a qualitative analysis of 1,461 mobile gambling scam incident reports.
- **Characterization of Scam Apps:** We characterize both Android and iOS gambling scam apps, including their development frameworks, declared permissions, compatibility, and backend network infrastructure. Our study shows that public online app generators have been misused to develop gambling scam apps.
- **Payment Channels:** We study the payment channels used by gambling scam apps and uncover a new type of money mule-based payment channel, measuring its revenue.

## 5. Conclusion
Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of the mobile gambling scam ecosystem and suggests potential avenues to disrupt these activities. By analyzing the operational pipeline, social engineering techniques, and payment channels, we highlight the need for robust measures to combat this growing threat.
