Abstract—With the growth of mobile computing techniques,
mobile gambling scams have seen a rampant increase in the
recent past. In mobile gambling scams, miscreants deliver scam-
ming messages via mobile instant messaging, host scam gambling
platforms on mobile apps, and adopt mobile payment channels.
To date, there is little quantitative knowledge about how this
trending cybercrime operates, despite causing daily fraud losses
estimated at more than $522,262 USD.
This paper presents the ﬁrst empirical study based on ground-
truth data of mobile gambling scams, associated with 1,461
scam incident reports and 1,487 gambling scam apps, spanning
from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020. The qualitative
and quantitative analysis of this ground-truth data allows us
to characterize the operational pipeline and full
fraud kill
chain of mobile gambling scams. In particular, we study the
social engineering tricks used by scammers and reveal their
effectiveness. Our work provides a systematic analysis of 1,068
conﬁrmed Android and 419 iOS scam apps,
including their
development frameworks, declared permissions, compatibility,
and backend network infrastructure. Perhaps surprisingly, our
study unveils that public online app generators have been abused
to develop gambling scam apps. Our analysis reveals several
payment channels (ab)used by gambling scam app and uncovers a
new type of money mule-based payment channel with the average
daily gambling deposit of $400,000 USD. Our ﬁndings enable a
better understanding of the mobile gambling scam ecosystem,
and suggest potential avenues to disrupt these scam activities.
I. INTRODUCTION
Gambling scams are a prevalent form of online fraud in
which a scammer claims to offer an advantage in gambling
activities (e.g., casino, poker, sports betting) to trick players
out of money. Gambling scams have already caused huge
ﬁnancial losses to individuals and businesses. As reported
in [1], the Canadian Lottery scam netted more than $5 billion
from U.S. victims and was making around £500,000 a month
in the U.K. In China, online gambling scams are with the
highest per-capita ﬁnancial loss among all kinds of scams [2].
With the fast growth and popularity of mobile markets
today, gambling scams are extending their reach to mobile
computing. In mobile gambling scams, miscreants deliver
scamming messages via instant messaging (IM) and host
scam gambling platforms on mobile apps. Those apps prevent
victims from cashing out their winnings [3]. Compared with
web-based scams recently studied [4], [5], [6], [7], mobile
gambling scams are characterized by using mobile-side so-
cial engineering attacks (e.g., scamming messages via instant
messaging apps) to distribute gambling scam apps, taking
advantage of mobile payment channels, and utilizing mobile
computing techniques to bypass traditional web-based fraud
detection [8], [9], [10]. Prior works on web-based scams
mainly focus on detecting scam gateway sites [5], identifying
the scam campaigns [4], or scam websites’ lifetime [7]. A key
limitation of these works was that they were based on external
measurements with limited visibility into the kill chain of
gambling scams, e.g., how does a scammer launch social
engineering attacks to lure victims; what is the modus operandi
of the scam platform; and what is the ﬁnancial proﬁtability
of such scam. So far, little has been done to analyze such
mobile scam apps, not to mention any effort to understand the
underground ecosystem behind them.
This paper presents the ﬁrst systematic study of mobile
gambling scams based on a ground-truth dataset. The data
pertains to 1,461 scam incident reports associated with 1,068
Android apps and 419 iOS apps, spanning from January 1,
2020 to December 31, 2020, provided by an Anonymous
Authority. Given the ground-truth data, we conduct a quali-
tative analysis of the incident reports and develop a suite of
measurement and dedicated reverse-engineering tools which
enable us to perform a large-scale study to unearth a mobile-
based kill chain of gambling scams. More speciﬁcally, we aim
to answer the following questions: What social engineering
techniques are used by miscreants in mobile gambling scams?
How do they operate gambling scam apps? How do they
provide evasive payment channels under rigorous ﬁnancial
censorship?
Looking into the ecosystem of mobile gambling scams, we
are surprised to ﬁnd that this new threat is trending with a
great impact on today’s mobile ecosystem. More speciﬁcally,
through a qualitative analysis on these scam incident reports,
we study social engineering techniques used by scammers to
trick victims into participating in gambling scams. We observe
that scammers established connections with victims via mobile
apps including IM applications (55.4%) and social network
apps (28.1%), such as online Q&A, job hunting, or dating
apps, and faked their proﬁles based on the information of
the victim’s social networks. Interestingly, we observed that
victims are proactively requesting scam gambling apps after
being baited. Compared with cases where scammers persuade
victims to download scam apps, this yields signiﬁcantly higher
scam losses ($47K vs. $30K on average per case). Through
the investigation of 1,487 gambling scam apps, we observed
two public online app generators, i.e., DCloud and APICloud,
being abused to develop scam apps. During gambling scam
app development, the certiﬁcates provided by these app gen-
erators have been used to sign 137 scam apps. Importantly,
we discover that gambling scam apps tend to declare lower
requirements for minimum OS versions being supported (4.4

for Android gambling scam apps vs. 5.0 for reputable apps
in Google Play, see Section VI-D) to ensure compatibility
between versions and, thus, can cover more victims, even
though their develop SDK versions are not outdated.
Furthermore, we analyze the payment channels employed by
mobile scam apps and discover eight payment channels used
by scammers, including traditional bank payment channels
(e.g., direct debits), online payment services (e.g., Alipay and
WeChat Pay), cryptocurrency (e.g., Tether and CGPay) and
money mule-based payments (e.g., Alipay and Idleﬁsh). We
also bring to light about new techniques for anonymous trans-
actions, i.e., Idleﬁsh Money Mule. To support this payment
channel, scammers recruit money mules, who are sellers of
a ﬂea market app called the Idleﬁsh, to transfer gambling
deposits. Our study uncovers 110 Idleﬁsh stores involved in
money laundering, which we have reported to the platform.
Our study further investigates the revenue under this payment
channel by traversing 17,144 payment links, which show that
the average daily revenue is up to $400,000 USD. We reported
our ﬁndings to the affected parties, including Apple, HUAWEI,
Xiaomi, Getui, DCloud and Idleﬁsh, who are serious about
these risks. Some of them expressed gratitude for our help via
bounty programs.
Contributions. We summarize the contributions as follows:
• We conduct the ﬁrst in-depth empirical study of mobile
gambling scams based on ground-truth data. Our study inves-
tigates the kill chain of mobile gambling scams and the actors
involved.
• We reveal social engineering techniques used by miscre-
ants via a qualitative analysis on 1,461 mobile gambling scam
incident reports.
• We characterize both Android and iOS gambling scam
apps, including their development frameworks, declared per-
missions, compatibility, and backend network infrastructure.
Our study reveals that public online app generators have been
abused to develop gambling scam apps.
• We study the payment channels (ab)used by gambling
scam app. We also uncover a new type of money mule-based
payment channel and measure its revenue.
II. BACKGROUND
As mentioned earlier, a gambling scam is a type of cy-
bercrime fraud that tricks victims out of money in gambling
activities, such as poker, casinos, and sports betting. Compared
to traditional gambling scams, which simply build impossible-
to-win systems, modern gambling scam activities tend to
prevent victims from cashing out. For example, when the
victims want to cash out their winnings, they may be told
that their accounts are frozen or ridiculously over-charged [3].
Note that in our study, we focus on gambling scam activities.
The legitimacy of gambling is out of the scope of this study.
Moving from the Internet to mobile devices [11], today,
gambling scams increasingly happen through mobile apps
deployed to victims’ smartphones than victims browsing web-
sites. Here, we introduce a typical mobile gambling scam

example from a real-world scam incident report, provided
by Anonymous Authority, to show how such scam activities
operate and how each entity interacts with each other.
Figure 1 illustrates the operational pipeline of mobile
gambling scams, which consists of four stages: connection
establishment, app delivery, gambling deposit, and scamming.
First, a scammer bootstraps the attack by establishing the
connection with a victim (). To build and earn trust, a
scammer usually creates a fake proﬁle and contacts the targets
through popular social media apps, e.g., dating apps or job
hunting apps. The scammer then usually lures the victim
to download a scam gambling app () by offering a “too-
good-to-be-true” bonus, which can exploit a vulnerability of
a gambling app to earn money. Once the victim trusts the
scammer and downloads the mobile gambling scam app, he
will fund his account () to start gambling via multiple
types of payment channels (e.g., bank, third-party payment,
cryptocurrency, money mule) embedded in the gambling apps.
Meanwhile, the scammer will bait the victim to continually
deposit money () by offering more lucrative returns. The
scammer then will lock the victim’s account (), preventing
the victim from withdrawing his/her gambling income. In this
study, we focus on cases where gambling scam activities are
operated on mobile apps. To the best of our knowledge, it is
the ﬁrst study of this kind.
