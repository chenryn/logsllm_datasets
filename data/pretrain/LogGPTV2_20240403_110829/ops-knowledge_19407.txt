User: Please explain what is RESTful API and its characteristics.
Assistant: RESTful API is an application programming interface based on the HTTP protocol, centered on resources, and defined, described, and interacted through a set of concise and unified interface design principles. Its features include: 1. Resource-centric: RESTful API takes resources as the core, abstracts each resource into a URI, and operates resources through the HTTP protocol. 2. Unified interface: RESTful API is defined, described and interacted through a set of concise and unified interface design principles. 3. State independence: The interaction between the client and the server of the RESTful API is stateless, and each request contains enough information to complete the request. 4. Cacheability: Responses in RESTful APIs can be cached by clients and middleware to reduce network latency and server load. 5. Layered system: The middleware between the client and the server in the RESTful API can be implemented in multiple layers to improve the scalability and flexibility of the system. 6. On-demand code: The response in the RESTful API only contains the required resource representations to reduce network transmission and system load.
