To reproduce, open
http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#typeahead with Chrome and
Mac OS X.
Half of the time for me (with Chrome 19.0.1084.56 on Mac OS X Lion), clicking
does not select the option, but rather, close the list and leave the already
typed letters without completing the letters.
I believe the issue is related to #3521 and #3504 but provides more details; I
hope we'll be able to pinpoint the issue this time.
Note that I could never reproduce the bug on Safari (5.1.3) nor on Firefox
(12.0)
