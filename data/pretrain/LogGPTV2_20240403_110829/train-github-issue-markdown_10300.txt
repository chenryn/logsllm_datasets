To reproduce the issue, please follow these steps:

1. Open the following URL in Google Chrome on a Mac OS X system: http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#typeahead
2. For me, using Chrome version 19.0.1084.56 on Mac OS X Lion, about half of the time, clicking an option from the typeahead list does not select it. Instead, the list closes, and the already typed letters remain incomplete.
3. I suspect this problem may be related to issues #3521 and #3504, but with more detailed information, we may be able to identify the root cause this time.
4. Please note that I have been unable to reproduce this bug in Safari (version 5.1.3) or Firefox (version 12.0).
