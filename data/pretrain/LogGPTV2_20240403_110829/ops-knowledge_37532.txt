User: Please briefly explain the software testing process and its relationship with the software development life cycle.
Assistant: A software testing process refers to a series of steps in planning, designing, executing and evaluating tests. It mainly includes the stages of requirements analysis, test planning and design, test execution, defect tracking and test reporting. Software testing is relatively late in the software development life cycle, usually after the software development is completed. However, during software development, the test team can work closely with the development team to conduct system testing as planned. Therefore, the relationship between software testing process and software development life cycle is not serial but interactive. The software testing process can strengthen the quality control in the software development process and improve the reliability and stability of the software. At the same time, the software development life cycle can also identify and solve problems in the testing process to ensure product testing quality and software reliability.
