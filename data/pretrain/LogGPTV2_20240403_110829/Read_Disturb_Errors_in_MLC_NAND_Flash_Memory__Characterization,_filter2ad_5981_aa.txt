Abstract—NAND ﬂash memory reliability continues to degrade
as the memory is scaled down and more bits are programmed per
cell. A key contributor to this reduced reliability is read disturb,
where a read to one row of cells impacts the threshold voltages
of unread ﬂash cells in different rows of the same block. Such
disturbances may shift the threshold voltages of these unread cells
to different logical states than originally programmed, leading to
read errors that hurt endurance.
For the ﬁrst time in open literature, this paper experimentally
characterizes read disturb errors on state-of-the-art 2Y-nm (i.e.,
20-24 nm) MLC NAND ﬂash memory chips. Our ﬁndings (1)
correlate the magnitude of threshold voltage shifts with read
operation counts, (2) demonstrate how program/erase cycle count
and retention age affect the read-disturb-induced error rate, and
(3) identify that lowering pass-through voltage levels reduces the
impact of read disturb and extend ﬂash lifetime. Particularly, we
ﬁnd that the probability of read disturb errors increases with
both higher wear-out and higher pass-through voltage levels.
We leverage these ﬁndings to develop two new techniques.
The ﬁrst technique mitigates read disturb errors by dynamically
tuning the pass-through voltage on a per-block basis. Using
real workload traces, our evaluations show that this technique
increases ﬂash memory endurance by an average of 21%. The
second technique recovers from previously-uncorrectable ﬂash
errors by identifying and probabilistically correcting cells sus-
ceptible to read disturb errors. Our evaluations show that this
recovery technique reduces the raw bit error rate by 36%.
Keywords—NAND ﬂash memory; read disturb; error tolerance
1. Introduction
NAND ﬂash memory currently sees widespread usage as a
storage device, having been incorporated into systems ranging
from mobile devices and client computers to datacenter storage,
as a result of its increasing capacity. Flash memory capacity
increase is mainly driven by aggressive transistor scaling and
multi-level cell (MLC) technology, where a single ﬂash cell
can store more than one bit of data. However, as its capacity
increases, ﬂash memory suffers from different types of circuit-
level noise, which greatly impact its reliability. These include
program/erase cycling noise [2,3], cell-to-cell program interfer-
ence noise [2, 5, 8], retention noise [2, 4, 6, 7, 23, 24], and read
disturb noise [11,14,24,33]. Among all of these types of noise,
read disturb noise has largely been understudied in the past for
MLC NAND ﬂash, with no open-literature work available today
that characterizes and analyzes the read disturb phenomenon.
One reason for this neglect has been the heretofore low
occurrence of read-disturb-induced errors in older ﬂash tech-
nologies. In single-level cell (SLC) ﬂash, read disturb errors
were only expected to appear after an average of one million
reads to a single ﬂash block [10,14]. Even with the introduction
of MLC ﬂash, ﬁrst-generation MLC devices were expected to
exhibit read disturb errors after 100,000 reads [10, 15]. As a
result of process scaling, some modern MLC ﬂash devices are
now prone to read disturb errors after as few as 20,000 reads,
with this number expected to drop even further with continued
scaling [10, 15]. The exposure of these read disturb errors can

locality and can,
Read disturb errors are an intrinsic result of the ﬂash archi-
tecture. Inside each ﬂash cell, data is stored as the threshold
voltage of the cell, based on the logical value that the cell
represents. During a read operation to the cell, a read reference
voltage is applied to the transistor corresponding to this cell. If
this read reference voltage is higher than the threshold voltage
of the cell, the transistor is turned on. Within a ﬂash block, the
transistors of multiple cells, each from a different ﬂash page, are
tied together as a single bitline, which is connected to a single
output wire. Only one cell is read at a time per bitline. In order
to read one cell (i.e., to determine whether it is turned on or
off ), the transistors for the cells not being read must be kept on
to allow the value from the cell being read to propagate to the
output. This requires the transistors to be powered with a pass-
through voltage, which is a read reference voltage guaranteed
to be higher than any stored threshold voltage. Though these
other cells are not being read, this high pass-through voltage
induces electric tunneling that can shift the threshold voltages
of these unread cells to higher values, thereby disturbing the
cell contents on a read operation to a neighboring page. As
we scale down the size of ﬂash cells, the transistor oxide
becomes thinner, which in turn increases this tunneling effect.
With each read operation having an increased tunneling effect, it
takes fewer read operations to neighboring pages for the unread
ﬂash cells to become disturbed (i.e., shifted to higher threshold
voltages) and move into a different logical state.
In light of the increasing sensitivity of ﬂash memory to
read disturb errors, our goal in this paper is to (1) develop a
thorough understanding of read disturb errors in state-of-the-
art MLC NAND ﬂash memories, by performing experimental
characterization of such errors on existing commercial 2Y-
nm (i.e. 20-24 nm) ﬂash memory chips, and (2) develop
mechanisms that can tolerate read disturb errors, making use
of insights gained from our read disturb error characterization.
The key ﬁndings from our quantitative characterization are:
• The effect of read disturb on threshold voltage distributions
and raw bit error rates increases with both the number
of reads to neighboring pages and the number of pro-
gram/erase cycles on a block (Sec. 3.2 and 3.3).
• Cells with lower threshold voltages are more susceptible
• As the pass-through voltage decreases, (1) the read disturb
effect of each individual read operation becomes smaller,
but (2) the read errors can increase due to reduced ability
in allowing the read value to pass through the unread cells
(Sec. 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6).
• If a page is recently written, a signiﬁcant margin within
the ECC correction capability is unused (i.e., the page can
still tolerate more errors), which enables the page’s pass-
through voltage to be lowered safely (Sec. 3.7).

We exploit these studies on the relation between the read
disturb effect and the pass-through voltage (Vpass), to design
two mechanisms that reduce the impact of read disturb. First, we
propose a low-cost dynamic mechanism called Vpass Tuning,
which, for each block, ﬁnds the lowest pass-through voltage that
retains data correctness. Vpass Tuning extends ﬂash endurance
by exploiting the ﬁnding that a lower Vpass reduces the read
disturb error count (Sec. 4). Second, we propose Read Disturb
Recovery (RDR), a mechanism that exploits the differences in
the susceptibility of different cells to read disturb to extend the
effective correction capability of error-correcting codes (ECC).
RDR probabilistically identiﬁes and corrects cells susceptible
to read disturb errors (Sec. 5).

following contributions:
• We perform a detailed experimental characterization of
how the threshold voltage distributions for ﬂash cells get
distorted due to the read disturb phenomenon.
• We propose a new technique to mitigate the errors that
are induced by read disturb effects. This technique dy-
namically tunes the pass-through voltage on a per-block
basis to minimize read disturb errors. We evaluate the
proposed read disturb mitigation technique on a variety of
real workload I/O traces, and show that it increases ﬂash
memory endurance by 21%.
• We propose a new mechanism that can probabilistically
identify and correct cells susceptible to read disturb errors.
This mechanism can reduce the ﬂash memory raw bit error
rate by up to 36%.
2. Background and Related Work
In this section, we ﬁrst provide some necessary background
on storing and reading data in NAND ﬂash memory. Next, we
discuss read disturb, a type of error induced by neighboring
read operations, and describe its underlying causes.
2.1. Data Storage in NAND Flash
NAND Flash Cell Threshold Voltage Range. A ﬂash memory
cell stores data in the form of a threshold voltage, the lowest
voltage at which the ﬂash cell can be switched on. As illustrated
in Fig. 1, the threshold voltage (Vth) range of a 2-bit MLC
NAND ﬂash cell is divided into four regions by three reference
voltages, Va, Vb, and Vc. The region in which the threshold
voltage of a ﬂash cell falls represents the cell’s current state,
which can be ER (or erased), P1, P2, or P3. Each state decodes
into a 2-bit value that is stored in the ﬂash cell (e.g., 11, 10, 00,
or 01). We represent this 2-bit value throughout the paper as a
tuple (LSB, MSB), where LSB is the least signiﬁcant bit and
MSB is the most signiﬁcant bit. Note that the threshold voltage
of all ﬂash cells in a chip is bounded by an upper limit, Vpass,
which is the pass-through voltage.

NAND Flash Block Organization. A NAND ﬂash memory
chip is organized as thousands of two-dimensional arrays of
ﬂash cells, called blocks. Within each block, as illustrated in
Fig. 2a, all the cells in the same row share a wordline (WL),
which typically spans 32K to 64K cells. The LSBs stored in
a wordline form the LSB page, and the MSBs stored in a
439439
wordline form the MSB page. Within a block, all cells in the
same column are connected in series to form a bitline or string
(BL in Fig. 2a). All cells in a bitline share a common ground on
one end, and a common sense ampliﬁer on the other for reading
the threshold voltage of one of the cells when decoding data.

NAND Flash Read Operation. A NAND ﬂash read operation
is performed by applying a read reference voltage Vref one or
more times to the wordline that contains the data to be read,
and sensing whether the cells on the wordline are switched on
or not. The applied Vref is chosen from the reference voltages
Va, Vb, and Vc, and changes based on which page (i.e., LSB
or MSB) we are currently reading.
To read an LSB page, only one read reference voltage, Vb,
needs to be applied. If a cell is in the ER or P1 state, its
threshold voltage is lower than Vb, hence it is switched on.
If a cell is in the P2 or P3 state, its threshold voltage is higher
than Vb, and the cell is switched off. The sense ampliﬁer can
then determine whether the cell is switched on or off to read
the data in this LSB page. To read the MSB page, two read
reference voltages, Va and Vc, need to be applied in sequence
to the wordline. If a cell turns off when Va is applied and turns
on when Vc is applied, we determine that the cell contains a
threshold voltage Vth where Va < Vth < Vc, indicating that it
is in either the P1 or P2 state and holds an MSB value of 0 (see
Fig. 1). Otherwise, if the cell is on when Va is applied or off
when Vc is applied, the cell is in the ER or P3 state, holding
an MSB value of 1.
As we mentioned before, the cells on a bitline are connected
in series to the sense ampliﬁer. In order to read from a single
cell on the bitline, all of the other cells on the same bitline
must switched on to allow the value being read to propagate
through to the sense ampliﬁer. We can achieve this by applying
the pass-through voltage onto the wordlines of unread cells.
Modern ﬂash memories guarantee that all unread cells are
passed through (i.e., the maximum possible threshold voltage,
Vpass, is applied to the cells) to minimize errors during the
read operation. We will show, in Sec. 3.6, that this choice is
conservative: applying a single worst-case pass-through voltage
to all cells is not necessary for correct operation.
2.2. Read Disturb
Read disturb is a well-known phenomenon in NAND ﬂash
memory, where reading data from a ﬂash cell can cause the
threshold voltages of other (unread) cells in the same block
to shift to a higher value [2, 11, 14, 15, 24, 33]. While a single
threshold voltage shift is small, such shifts can accumulate over

time, eventually becoming large enough to alter the state of
some cells and hence generate read disturb errors.
The failure mechanism of a read disturb error is similar
to the mechanism of a normal program operation. A program
operation applies a high programming voltage (+10V) to the
cell to shift its threshold voltage to the desired range. Similarly,
a read operation applies a high pass-through voltage (∼+6V)
to all other cells that share the same bitline with the cell being
read. Although the pass-through voltage is not as high as the
programming voltage, it still generates a “weak programming”
effect on the cells it is applied to, which can unintentionally
shift their threshold voltages.
2.3. Circuit-Level Impacts of Read Disturb
At the circuit level, as illustrated in Fig. 2b and 2c, a NAND
ﬂash memory cell is essentially a ﬂoating gate transistor with
its control gate (CG) connected to the wordline, and its source
and drain connected to (or shared with) its neighboring cells.
A ﬂoating gate transistor, compared to an ordinary transistor,
adds a ﬂoating gate (FG, as shown in Fig. 2b and 2c) beneath
the CG. The amount of charge stored in the FG determines the
threshold voltage of the transistor.
Electrical charge is injected to the FG during a read dis-
turb or a program operation through an effect called Fowler-
Nordheim (FN) tunneling [12], which creates an electric tunnel
between the FG and the substrate. The FN tunnel is triggered
by the electric ﬁeld passing through the tunnel (Eox). Note
that the strength of this electric ﬁeld is proportional to the
voltage applied on the CG and the amount of charge stored
in the FG. The current density through the FN tunnel (JF N )
can be modeled as [12]:
oxe−βF N /Eox
JF N = αF N E2
(1)
We observe from Eq. (1)1 that the FN tunneling current in-
creases with Eox super-linearly. Since the pass-through voltage
is much lower than the programming voltage, the tunneling
current
induced by a single read disturb is much smaller
than that of a program operation. With a lower current, each
individual read disturb injects charge into the FG at a lower
rate, resulting in a slower threshold voltage shift than during a
program operation.
Unfortunately, the actual effect of read disturb is exacer-
bated by the accumulation of read counts within the same
block. Today’s ﬂash devices are fast enough to sustain more
than 100,000 read operations in 1 minute [30]. The threshold
voltage change generated by each read operation within the
same block can accumulate to lead to a read disturb error. Also,
a single read operation can disturb all other pages within the
same block. As the block size increases further in the future,
read disturb errors are more likely to happen [15].
2.4. Related Work on Read Disturb
To date, the read disturb phenomenon for NAND ﬂash has
not been well explored in openly-available literature. Prior work
on mitigating NAND ﬂash read disturb errors has proposed to
leverage the ﬂash controller, either by caching recently read data
to avoid a read operation [32], or by maintaining a cumulative
per-block read counter and rewriting the contents of a block
whenever the counter exceeds a predetermined threshold [13].
The Read Disturb-Aware FTL identiﬁes those pages which
incur the most reads using the ﬂash translation layer (FTL),
and moves these pages to a new block [15].
Two mechanisms are currently being implemented within
