# What is it
Since the hooks launch, I've been working with various teams and developers,
and all of them, I repeat, ALL of them, seniors and juniors. Have been using
useEffect "wrong" (considering what the react team intended). They all use the
dependency array as an update array. There is no reason to keep hammering us,
telling us that it is a dependency array if no one uses that way.
# What I propose
Change linters and documentation to reflect the array as an update array, not
as a dependency. Maybe add a third argument that should run as an actual
dependency array, that does not trigger the code inside.
