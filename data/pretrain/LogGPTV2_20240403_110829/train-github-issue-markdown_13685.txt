I am currently working on a 5-minute quick start tutorial for Angular 2, as referenced here: <https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html>. However, I encountered some errors related to `typings` when running the `npm install` command. I had previously faced similar issues with `es6-shim`, which I managed to resolve by setting the `http` and `https_proxy` variables.

Could you provide any suggestions or guidance on how to solve this current issue?

### Error Details

  - The failure is likely due to an issue with the `angular2-quickstart` package, not with npm itself.
  - To report this issue, use: `npm bugs angular2-quickstart`
  - Alternatively, get more information via: `npm owner ls angular2-quickstart`

### TypeScript Version
- 1.7.5 / 1.8.0-beta / nightly (1.9.0-dev.20160217)

### Expected Behavior
The `npm install` command should complete successfully without any errors.

### Actual Behavior
The `npm install` command fails with the above-mentioned errors related to `typings`.

Any help or pointers would be greatly appreciated.
