uniform, however, we observe the similar reduction in ˆQLt as Md
becomes more tolerant with nonuniform π (D), as shown in Fig. 5
(left). These experiments validate our hypothesis that the tailored
QL metrics account for the changes in parameters of the LBS, which
the generic QL metrics miss.
6.2.2 Drivers’ ETA tolerance. With increase in ETAt of drivers from
400 to 2000 seconds, we observe a reduction in ˆQLt , as shown in
Fig. 4 (middle). With higher ETAt, drivers’ probability to accept rides
with higher ETAs increases; hence, TDA (§ 4.4) decreases and so
does ˆQLt . However, ˆQLд, having no such relation to ETAt, remains
almost constant; this is observed for different obfuscation radii r’s
and non-uniform driver distributions (Fig. 5 (right)). In addition, we
observe that at higher ETAt, Md does not contribute to ˆQLt , because
at higher ETAt even the strictest driver model HHH accepts all ride
requests. Hence, QLt remains almost constant and equal to the
time to cover constant ˆQLд as shown in Fig. 7. Therefore, ˆQLt is a
function of ETAt, Md and ˆQLд.
6.2.3 Number of players. The number of active riders and drivers
ˆQLt of riders. For instance, high demand can be realized
can affect
by increasing active riders and their request and/or decreasing the
number of active drivers; and vice versa for high supply. There-
fore, without loss of generality, we realize high supply and/or low
demand by increasing the number of active drivers from 120 to
400 in steps of 40 while keeping QLg constant. The resulting ˆQLt
is shown in Fig. 4 (right), where we observe the decrease in ˆQLt
with an increase in the number of drivers. The above evaluations
demonstrate that the independence (dependence) of generic
(tailored) metrics from LBS parameters can affect evaluation
of LPPMs.
6.3 Impact on LPPM Comparison
The correct choice of LPPM for a given LBS can affect the utilty of
its users; therefore, in this part we consider the effect of QL metrics
on LPPM comparison. In this part, we compare LPPMe and LPPMp
using ˆQLд and ˆQLt for the same PRide ENV. We run PRide with
baseline ENV for these mechanisms and different values of ϵ. The
motivation here is to understand whether comparing performances
of two LPPMs using generic and tailored metrics leads to the same
conclusions. We will show that there is a difference in conclusions
when LPPMs’ performances are quantified with the two metrics.
Therefore, tailored QL metrics are required to compare and choose
LPPMs for a particular LBS scenario.
Fig. 6 (left) shows the comparison of LPPMp and LPPMe for
ENVb with uniform π (R) and π (D), and Fig. 6 (middle) shows
the comparison for nonuniform π (R) and π (D). For uniform π’s,
comparing the LPPMs using the two metrics points to unambigu-
ous superiority of LPPMp, as LPPMp performs better on both the
metrics for all r’s. However, for nonuniform π’s, the two LPPMs
perform similarly on ˆQLд as with uniform π’s, but the performance
of LPPMe improves significantly when measured with ˆQLt . The
reason for this is, as follows. Note that LPPMe obfuscates loca-
tions farther than LPPMp (compare the lines with brown boxplots
in the middle figure). High obfuscations due to LPPMe increases
the probability of finding drivers with the considered nonuniform
distributions and improves the performance of LPPMe. This per-
formance improvement on ˆQLt may allow the use of LPPMe due
to the additional advantage of its easy adaptivity to any distance
metric over LPPMp [5, 6].
Similarly, we compare LPPMp with LPPMg which are very close
in performance when measured with ˆQLд; the results for uniform

and nonuniform distributions for π (D) and π (R) are shown in Fig. 9.
We find that, unlike in the uniform case, generic and tailored metrics
completely disagree on the performance of the two mechanisms
when π (D) and π (R) are nonuniform and grid resolution for LPPMg
is 0.2Km. The reason for better the performance of LPPMp on ˆQLt
is the same as explained above.
In Fig. 6 (right), we compare uniform and nonuniform distribu-
tion cases for LPPMp. We note that with uniform π (R) and π (D),
both ˆQLt and ˆQLд increase monotonically with the obfuscation
radii. But, with nonuniform distributions the increase is not mono-
tonic: ˆQLt remains constant in some intervals of obfuscation radii.
This experiment demonstrates that there are can be RHS scenarios
in which ˆQLд would change significantly with obfuscation while
ˆQLt may not, and vice-versa. This emphasizes the need for the use
of ˆQLt in comparisons of LPPMs.
Furthermore, in §6.4, we show how the use of generic versus
tailored QL affects the choice of privacy budget ϵ, an important
parameter LBS users tune according to their privacy needs. Specifi-
cally, we show that the use of tailored QL allows for an LBS-aware
choice of ϵ: When ETAt of drives in a region is 400 versus 900 sec-
onds, the use of ˆQLд always leads to the same ϵ, while ˆQLt adapts
to the variations ETAt to give appropriate ϵ. Note that here we make
a reasonable assumption that the tailored QL is a more appropriate
QL metric than the generic QL metric.
To summarize, the performance evaluation using LBS- tai-
lored metrics can disagree completely with that using generic
metrics and mislead the choice of an LPPM for a particular
LBS. This disagreement may not be significant in all scenarios.

radii r, hence, also for different ϵ. ˆQLд in both ETAt cases re-
mains the same while ˆQLt reduces with ETAt. This allows to
choose desired ENV-tailored ϵ without violating QL require-
ments.
However, it is important to find corner cases and tailor LPPMs to
the LBS for reliable designs. Apart from designing, while choos-
ing from the existing LPPMs, generic metrics may discard a

parameters. For instance, in Pride, an LPPM that considers play-
ers’ distribution and employs LPPMp for uniform while LPPMe
for nonuniform distribution is better than any of the two LPPMs
separately.
6.4 Implications to choice of ϵ:
In geo-indistinguishable mechanisms, privacy budget ϵ is an impor-
tant parameter, because it directly affects LPPM outputs and also
specifies generic QLes for some LPPMs. Hence, the choice of ϵ is
an important aspect of LPPM design. In this section, we evaluate
ˆQLд vs ˆQLt on the choice of ϵ. Two com-
the effect of the use of
monly used QLes for a given metric are average loss, ˆQL [1, 5], and
worse case loss, QL+ [1, 20, 28]. While optimizing mechanisms for
the best privacy, QL+ is commonly used as a constraint [1, 20, 28].
However, it is hard to incorporate QL+ in the design process of
geo-indistinguishability mechanisms [20]. Instead, we solve the
objective in (7) to find the least ϵ that upper bounds ˆQL by QL+.

QLg (lr , lt
o ); this can be seen in Fig. 10 where QLg decreases for high
r values.
The greedy remapping experiment implies that considering LBS
parameters can improve ˆQLt without improving ˆQLд; in Fig. 10,
ˆQLд with remapping increases while ˆQLt decreases. More impor-
tantly, for some ENVs, remapping to improve ˆQLд may not
improve ˆQLt . This can be understood as: at low r, such remap
will reduce ˆQLд for lr ’s out of the special zone and increase the
distance of lt
o from the special zone, hence reduce the chances of
finding drivers and will increase ˆQLt . Therefore, remapping using
a generic metric will not necessarily improve tailored QLes
and vice versa. This emphasizes the need to consider LBS param-
eters to devise QL metrics for the utility improvement techniques
to be effective.
6.6 Effect of Multiple QLes on Remapping in
LPPMs
In this part, we investigate how multiple viable QLes, called QL-
dimensions, associated with LBSes and different preferences of
users towards them affect remapping when these QLes are consid-
ered separately and in combination. Specifically, we investigate: 1)
effect of tailored vs generic metrics on remapping proposed in [5],
2) effect of combination of QLes, considering user preferences for
each QL-dimension. We define the notion of comprehensive QL,(cid:102)QL,
that combines different QL-dimensions according to preferences
input by users. Remapping [5] requires a closed form expression for
the QL metric used which is not available for RHS LBSes. Therefore,
for demonstration, we consider POI search LBS with two QLes:
Euclidean distance as generic QL, ˆQLд, and count of POIs returned
by the LBS as a tailored QL, ˆQLt . ˆQLд represents the average dis-
tance the user needs to travel to the finally selected POI while ˆQLt
represents the number of choices the user has to choose the final
POI from. Due to space constraints, we defer the details of the
framework and its application to POI search LBS to Appendix A
and only discuss representative results here.
Key insights: 1) Remapping using one QL metric need not
generalize to other viable QL metrics. Fig. 11 shows ˆQLд for
LPPM outputs —without remap, with remap using ˆQLд, with remap
using ˆQLt , and with remap using(cid:102)QL. It can be seen that if remap-
ping is performed using only the Euclidean distance as the QL
Figure 9: Comparison of LPPMp and LPPMg with uniform (left) and nonuniform (right) π (D) and π (R). Unlike in the uniform
distribution case, ˆQLд and ˆQLt completely disagree on the performance of the two LPPMs when Gr es is 0.2Km for LPPMg when
the distributions π (D) and π (R) are nonuniform.
Figure 10: PRide with nonuniform π (D) with and without
greedy remapping. Greedy remap helps low r by increasing
obfuscation distance when lr is not in special zone and helps
high r by reducing obfuscation distance when lr is inside the
special zone.
metric, the remapped locations have low POI count (Fig. 13). On the
other hand, if remapping is performed using only the POI-count as
QL, the remapped locations are far from real locations (Fig. 11). This
restates (§ 6.5) the importance of tailored QLes for remapping based
utility improvements. 2) All the possible QL-dimensions asso-
ciated with an LBS combined according to user preferences
for each dimension is a more effective (Fig. 14) and user cen-
tric way to employ remapping. We show that, with change in
preferences of QL-dimensions, remapping outputs change signif-
icantly as shown in Fig. 12. Note that as the preference for ˆQLд
