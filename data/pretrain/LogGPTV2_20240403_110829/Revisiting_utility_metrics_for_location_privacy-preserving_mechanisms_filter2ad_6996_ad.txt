### 6.2.1 Impact of Driver Acceptance Models on QL Metrics

As the driver acceptance model, \( M_d \), becomes more tolerant with non-uniform \( \pi(D) \), we observe a similar reduction in \( \hat{Q}L_t \), as shown in Fig. 5 (left). These experiments validate our hypothesis that the tailored QL metrics account for the changes in parameters of the LBS, which the generic QL metrics miss.

### 6.2.2 Drivers’ ETA Tolerance

With an increase in drivers' ETA tolerance (\( ETAt \)) from 400 to 2000 seconds, we observe a reduction in \( \hat{Q}L_t \), as shown in Fig. 4 (middle). As \( ETAt \) increases, the probability of drivers accepting rides with higher ETAs also increases, leading to a decrease in Total Distance Accepted (TDA, § 4.4) and, consequently, in \( \hat{Q}L_t \). However, \( \hat{Q}L_g \), which is not related to \( ETAt \), remains almost constant. This behavior is consistent across different obfuscation radii \( r \) and non-uniform driver distributions (Fig. 5, right). Additionally, at higher \( ETAt \), \( M_d \) does not contribute to \( \hat{Q}L_t \) because even the strictest driver model (HHH) accepts all ride requests. Therefore, \( \hat{Q}L_t \) remains almost constant and equal to the time to cover the constant \( \hat{Q}L_g \), as shown in Fig. 7. Thus, \( \hat{Q}L_t \) is a function of \( ETAt \), \( M_d \), and \( \hat{Q}L_g \).

### 6.2.3 Number of Players

The number of active riders and drivers can affect \( \hat{Q}L_t \). For example, high demand can be realized by increasing the number of active riders and their requests, or by decreasing the number of active drivers, and vice versa for high supply. To evaluate this, we simulate high supply and/or low demand by increasing the number of active drivers from 120 to 400 in steps of 40 while keeping \( QL_g \) constant. The resulting \( \hat{Q}L_t \) is shown in Fig. 4 (right), where we observe a decrease in \( \hat{Q}L_t \) with an increase in the number of drivers. These evaluations demonstrate that the independence (dependence) of generic (tailored) metrics from LBS parameters can significantly affect the evaluation of Location Privacy Protection Mechanisms (LPPMs).

### 6.3 Impact on LPPM Comparison

The correct choice of LPPM for a given LBS can affect the utility of its users. In this section, we consider the effect of QL metrics on LPPM comparison. We compare LPPM_e and LPPM_p using \( \hat{Q}L_g \) and \( \hat{Q}L_t \) for the same PRide environment. We run PRide with baseline environments for these mechanisms and different values of \( \epsilon \). The motivation is to understand whether comparing the performances of two LPPMs using generic and tailored metrics leads to the same conclusions. We show that there is a difference in conclusions when LPPMs' performances are quantified with the two metrics. Therefore, tailored QL metrics are required to compare and choose LPPMs for a particular LBS scenario.

Fig. 6 (left) shows the comparison of LPPM_p and LPPM_e for uniform \( \pi(R) \) and \( \pi(D) \), and Fig. 6 (middle) shows the comparison for non-uniform \( \pi(R) \) and \( \pi(D) \). For uniform \( \pi \)'s, both metrics indicate the unambiguous superiority of LPPM_p, as it performs better on both metrics for all \( r \)'s. However, for non-uniform \( \pi \)'s, the two LPPMs perform similarly on \( \hat{Q}L_g \) but LPPM_e's performance improves significantly when measured with \( \hat{Q}L_t \). This is because LPPM_e obfuscates locations farther than LPPM_p, increasing the probability of finding drivers with the considered non-uniform distributions and improving the performance of LPPM_e. This improvement in \( \hat{Q}L_t \) may make LPPM_e a viable option due to its additional advantage of easy adaptability to any distance metric over LPPM_p [5, 6].

### 6.4 Implications for the Choice of \( \epsilon \)

In geo-indistinguishable mechanisms, the privacy budget \( \epsilon \) is an important parameter as it directly affects LPPM outputs and specifies generic QLs for some LPPMs. Hence, the choice of \( \epsilon \) is crucial in LPPM design. In this section, we evaluate the effect of using \( \hat{Q}L_g \) vs. \( \hat{Q}L_t \) on the choice of \( \epsilon \). Commonly used QLs for a given metric are average loss, \( \hat{Q}L \) [1, 5], and worst-case loss, \( QL^+ \) [1, 20, 28]. While optimizing mechanisms for the best privacy, \( QL^+ \) is commonly used as a constraint [1, 20, 28]. However, it is challenging to incorporate \( QL^+ \) in the design process of geo-indistinguishability mechanisms [20]. Instead, we solve the objective in (7) to find the least \( \epsilon \) that upper bounds \( \hat{Q}L \) by \( QL^+ \):

\[
\epsilon^* = \arg\min_{\epsilon \in \mathbb{R}^+} \quad \text{s.t.} \quad \hat{Q}L(LPPM, \pi, d_Q) \leq QL^+(l_r, l_t^o)
\]

This can be seen in Fig. 10, where \( QL_g \) decreases for high \( r \) values. The greedy remapping experiment implies that considering LBS parameters can improve \( \hat{Q}L_t \) without improving \( \hat{Q}L_g \). In Fig. 10, \( \hat{Q}L_g \) with remapping increases while \( \hat{Q}L_t \) decreases. More importantly, for some environments, remapping to improve \( \hat{Q}L_g \) may not improve \( \hat{Q}L_t \). This can be understood as follows: at low \( r \), such remapping will reduce \( \hat{Q}L_g \) for \( l_r \)'s out of the special zone and increase the distance of \( l_t^o \) from the special zone, reducing the chances of finding drivers and increasing \( \hat{Q}L_t \). Therefore, remapping using a generic metric will not necessarily improve tailored QLs and vice versa. This emphasizes the need to consider LBS parameters to devise QL metrics for effective utility improvements.

### 6.6 Effect of Multiple QLs on Remapping in LPPMs

In this section, we investigate how multiple viable QLs, called QL-dimensions, associated with LBSes and different user preferences affect remapping when these QLs are considered separately and in combination. Specifically, we investigate:
1. The effect of tailored vs. generic metrics on remapping proposed in [5].
2. The effect of combining QLs, considering user preferences for each QL-dimension.

We define the notion of comprehensive QL, \(\tilde{QL}\), that combines different QL-dimensions according to user preferences. Remapping [5] requires a closed-form expression for the QL metric used, which is not available for RHS LBSes. For demonstration, we consider a POI search LBS with two QLs: Euclidean distance as a generic QL, \( \hat{Q}L_g \), and the count of POIs returned by the LBS as a tailored QL, \( \hat{Q}L_t \). \( \hat{Q}L_g \) represents the average distance the user needs to travel to the finally selected POI, while \( \hat{Q}L_t \) represents the number of choices the user has to choose the final POI from. Due to space constraints, we defer the details of the framework and its application to POI search LBS to Appendix A and only discuss representative results here.

**Key Insights:**
1. Remapping using one QL metric need not generalize to other viable QL metrics. Fig. 11 shows \( \hat{Q}L_g \) for LPPM outputs—without remap, with remap using \( \hat{Q}L_g \), with remap using \( \hat{Q}L_t \), and with remap using \(\tilde{QL}\). It can be seen that if remapping is performed using only the Euclidean distance as the QL metric, the remapped locations have low POI count (Fig. 13). On the other hand, if remapping is performed using only the POI-count as the QL, the remapped locations are far from real locations (Fig. 11). This restates (§ 6.5) the importance of tailored QLs for remapping-based utility improvements.
2. Combining all possible QL-dimensions associated with an LBS according to user preferences is a more effective and user-centric way to employ remapping. We show that, with changes in preferences of QL-dimensions, remapping outputs change significantly, as shown in Fig. 12. Note that as the preference for \( \hat{Q}L_g \) dimension increases along the x-axis, locations remapped using \(\tilde{QL}\) balance the trade-off between \( \hat{Q}L_g \) and \( \hat{Q}L_t \) according to user preferences.
