User: Analyze the following causes of high server CPU usage and provide solutions. The server CPU usage has been maintained between 90-100%, but there are no obvious load fluctuations or abnormalities.
Assistant: Possible cause: 1. Uneven load balancing causes some services to overuse CPU resources. 2. Insufficient system memory leads to frequent memory paging, which in turn leads to high CPU usage. 3. Infinite loops, deadlocks and other problems occur in running applications, resulting in extremely high CPU usage. 4. Improper system configuration, some loaded applications or processes are not optimized, resulting in excessive CPU usage. Solution: 1. Optimize the load balancing strategy to ensure the balanced distribution of service resources. 2. Expand memory capacity, increase memory paging size, and reduce memory paging times. 3. Monitor the running status of the application program, regularly check whether there are problems such as infinite loops and deadlocks in the application program in the operating environment, and solve them in time. 4. For different applications, properly adjust the allocation ratio of CPU and memory resources to avoid excessive CPU usage. At the same time, optimize operating system parameters to speed up system operation.
