Question: In an Android environment, a security engineer plans to use a cryptographic key associated with a `Tag::BOOT_PATCHLEVEL` of 20180605. Assuming the device has not received any security updates since June 5, 2018, what would be the outcome if the engineer tries to use this key after the system's boot image security patch level has been updated to 20190101?
"A": "The key would be usable without any issues as long as the patch level is higher than the one specified in the tag.",
"B": "The key usage would fail, triggering a `ErrorCode::KEY_REQUIRES_UPGRADE` response.",
"C": "The engineer would need to downgrade the system's patch level to match the key's tag to use the key.",
"D": "The key's `Tag::BOOT_PATCHLEVEL` automatically updates to match the system's new patch level."
Answer: B
