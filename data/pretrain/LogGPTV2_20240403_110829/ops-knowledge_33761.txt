User: Coming from an enterprise systems background (think Java and Windows) - I'm surprised at the popularity of python as a prototyping language and am trying to put my finger on the precise reason for this. Examples include being listed as one of the four languages Google uses. Possible reasons include:

enables rapid systems application prototyping using of c++ libraries using swig wrappers
built to a well defined language specification
innovative features at the syntax level enabling high level of expressiveness
highly flexible web frameworks built long before other languages (django)

The questions is what makes it so popular/highly regarded, but to give some balance I'm going to give some reasons it might not be popular:

less tool support
less enterprise support (ie a vendor helpdesk)
lower performance
BDFL not caring about backward compatibility in version upgrades

Or was it just the best at a particular point in time (about 8 years ago) and other languages and frameworks have since caught up?

... What?
Most people doing Python programming aren't doing C++ programming, they're doing Python programming. And they're doing it fast, because they don't need to worry about things like memory management, or templates, or... the sort of namespace support C++ uses.
