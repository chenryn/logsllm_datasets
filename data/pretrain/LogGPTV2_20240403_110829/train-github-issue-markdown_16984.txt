I'm seeing the below issue pop up now that a new package (13.13.1) was
released 4 hours ago. These types seem to be a dependency for a lot of the
packages that I'm using in my project. Itw as working before, but then I just
did a clean build of my project and it upgraded the package.
There are many many more authors on this module - please feel free to tag the
appropriate party.
