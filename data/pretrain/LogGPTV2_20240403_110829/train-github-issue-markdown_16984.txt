### Issue Description

I am encountering the following error after a new package version (13.13.1) was released 4 hours ago. These types are dependencies for many of the packages in my project. The setup was working previously, but after performing a clean build, the package was upgraded, and the error appeared.

There are numerous other contributors to this module. Please feel free to tag the appropriate parties.

**Error Details:**

```
ERROR in .../node_modules/@types/node/globals.d.ts(1075,15):
TS2430: Interface 'Require' incorrectly extends interface 'RequireFunction'.
  Types of property 'cache' are incompatible.
    Type 'Dict' is not assignable to type '{ [id: string]: NodeModule; }'.
      Index signatures are incompatible.
        Type 'NodeModule | undefined' is not assignable to type 'NodeModule'.
          Type 'undefined' is not assignable to type 'NodeModule'.
