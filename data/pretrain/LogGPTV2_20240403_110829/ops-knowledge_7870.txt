User: Docker is a very popular containerization technology. In what scenarios would you consider using it? Please describe its installation, configuration and usage.
Assistant: Scenarios for using Docker include but are not limited to: 1. Create consistency and reliability in different development and testing environments 2. Deploy complex applications and services in production environments to improve portability and scalability 3. Build development The environment (such as web development, data analysis, machine learning environment, etc.) and the construction of CI/CD pipelines to install Docker are as follows: 1. Prerequisite: Make sure the system is 64-bit and supports virtualization 2. Install Docker under Ubuntu: Update the system Software package: sudo apt-get update Install Docker: sudo apt-get install docker-ce 3. Install Docker under Windows: Download and install Docker Desktop for Windows If the system does not support virtualization, you need to install Docker Toolbox 4. On Mac OS To install Docker: Download and install Docker Desktop for Mac If the system does not support virtualization, you need to install Docker Toolbox. The process of configuring Docker: 1. Configure the Docker image accelerator: it can increase the image download speed 2. Configure the Docker container network: it can communicate with the host How to use Docker to interact with each other: 1. Find and download images in Docker Hub 2. Run and manage containers: create, delete, start, stop, pause, resume, modify containers, etc. 3. Build your own images: through Dockerfile Automate the build process of managed images
