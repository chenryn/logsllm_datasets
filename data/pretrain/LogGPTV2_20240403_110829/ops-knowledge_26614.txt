Question: "In the context of an Android device security subsystem, if an attacker attempts to brute-force a user's device password, how does the system's Gatekeeper component respond to mitigate this risk?"
 "A": "It temporarily locks the user out after a set number of failed attempts, requiring a device reboot."
 "B": "It increments a failure counter before verifying the user password and clears it upon successful verification."
 "C": "It encrypts the password with a new key generated for each attempt to prevent pattern recognition."
 "D": "It resets the User SID to a new value after each failed attempt, thus invalidating all keys bound to it."
Answer: B
