Hi,
Under numpy 1.4.1, the output of:
> int32(array([0.]))
is simply "0", whereas under numpy 1.3.0, the output is  
"array([0], dtype=int32)". While the former is a number,  
the latter is an array. Interestingly, the output for
> int32(array([0.,1.]))
and for
> int32(array([]))
is the same in each version (i.e., both return arrays).
I apologize if this has already been addressed. I did a search and found
nothing.
Cheers,
Phaustus
