Hello,

I have noticed a difference in the output behavior between NumPy versions 1.4.1 and 1.3.0 when converting a single-element array to an `int32` type. Specifically, under NumPy 1.4.1, the following code:

```python
int32(array([0.]))
```

returns `0`, which is a scalar value. However, under NumPy 1.3.0, the same code returns `array([0], dtype=int32)`, which is an array.

Interestingly, for the following cases, both versions of NumPy return arrays:
- `int32(array([0., 1.]))`
- `int32(array([]))`

I apologize if this issue has already been addressed. I conducted a search but did not find any related information.

Best regards,  
Phaustus
