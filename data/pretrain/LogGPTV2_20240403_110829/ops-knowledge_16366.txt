It appears you are encountering an issue when attempting to activate a virtual environment in your project. The problem seems to be related to the command syntax and possibly the shell you are using. Here is a more structured and detailed explanation of the situation and how to resolve it:

### Problem Description
You have created a virtual environment for your Django project, but you are unable to activate it. The error message indicates that the `source` command is not recognized, which suggests that you might be using a Windows Command Prompt (cmd) or PowerShell, where the `source` command is not available.

### Steps to Create and Activate the Virtual Environment

1. **Create the Virtual Environment:**
   You have already created the virtual environment successfully. Here are the steps you followed:
   ```sh
   c:\testdjangoproj\mysite>virtualenv --no-site-packages venv
   The --no-site-packages flag is deprecated; it is now the default behavior.
   Using real prefix 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Python'
   New python executable in venv\Scripts\python.exe
   File venv\Lib\distutils\distutils.cfg exists with different content; not overwriting
   Installing setuptools.................done.
   Installing pip...................done.
   ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   - **Windows Command Prompt (cmd):**
     Use the following command to activate the virtual environment:
     ```sh
     c:\testdjangoproj\mysite>venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - **PowerShell:**
     If you are using PowerShell, the activation command is slightly different:
     ```sh
     c:\testdjangoproj\mysite>.\venv\Scripts\Activate
     ```

### Additional Notes
- **Python Version:**
  You mentioned Python 7, which does not exist. Please ensure you are using a valid Python version, such as Python 3.9 or 3.10.

- **Virtualenv Version:**
  You are using virtualenv 2.2.x. Consider updating to the latest version of virtualenv or using `venv`, which is included in the standard library from Python 3.3 onwards.

- **Visual Studio Code (VSCode):**
  If you are using VSCode, it may default to using PowerShell. To switch to the Command Prompt, follow these steps:
  1. Open the integrated terminal in VSCode.
  2. Click on the dropdown menu in the terminal (usually shows "PowerShell" by default).
  3. Select "Command Prompt" from the list.
  4. Now, use the appropriate activation command for the Command Prompt.

### Example
Here is an example of the complete process in the Command Prompt:
```sh
c:\testdjangoproj\mysite>virtualenv venv
c:\testdjangoproj\mysite>venv\Scripts\activate
(venv) c:\testdjangoproj\mysite>
```

By following these steps, you should be able to create and activate your virtual environment without any issues.
