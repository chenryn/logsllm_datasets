User: How to backup and restore the database? Please list common backup schemes and explain their operation steps.
Assistant: 1. Backup (1) Full Backup (Full Backup) A full backup refers to backing up the entire database, including all data structures and data such as all data, indexes, stored procedures, triggers, and user-defined functions. During the backup process, the system will write all the data in the database into the backup file line by line. Operation steps: Step1: Open SQL Server Management Studio and connect to the database server to be backed up. Step2: Right-click the database that needs to be backed up, select "Task" --> "Backup...", open the backup wizard, and click "Next". Step3: In the "Select Backup Type" window, select "Full Backup" and click "Next". Step4: In the "Backup Database" window, select the backup destination (disk or tape), backup file name, backup type, the default is "backup now". For a new backup, it is generally recommended to put the backup files in a special backup directory to avoid file loss in the middle of the problem. Step5: In the "Options" window, select the content to be backed up, for example: backup database log, compressed backup, etc. Click "Next". Step6: In the "Summary" window, check whether the backup content and options are correct, and click "Finish" to complete the backup operation. (2) Differential backup (Differential Backup) Differential backup means that after backing up the database, only the new modifications after the last full backup or differential backup are backed up, and all data changes after the latest backup are saved. In layman's terms, only backup The changed part after the last backup is faster than a full backup, but it needs to be restored in steps. Operation steps: Step1: Enter SQL Server Management Studio and connect to the database server to be backed up. Step2: Right-click the database to be backed up, select "Task" --> "Differential Backup...", open the differential backup wizard, and click "Next". Step3: In the "Differential Backup Database" window, select the database to be backed up, select the backup destination, backup file name, and fill in the backup description. Click "Next". Step4: In the "Options" window, select the database backup type (differential backup) to be backed up, and choose whether to back up the database log. Click "Next". Step5: In the "Summary" window, check whether the backup content and options are correct, and click "Finish" to complete the backup operation. 2. Recovery (1) Full recovery (Full Restore) Full recovery refers to restoring the data in the full backup to the database. This recovery method is suitable for recovering in the event of serious damage; however, to ensure the security of the backed up data, regular full backups are required. Operation steps: Step1: Enter SQL Server Management Studio, and connect to the database server to be restored. Step2: Right-click the database to be restored, select "Task" --> "Restore..." to open the restore wizard, and click "Next". Step3: In the "Select Backup Set" window, select the backup data to be restored, and click "Next". Step4: In the "Options" window, select the type of restoration (database, filegroup, file), restoration destination, disable index during restoration, etc., and click "Next". Step5: In the "Recovery" window, check "Prohibit recovery of unrecovered files" in "Optional". Step6: In the "Options" window, select the time to restore, such as after the last backup, a certain point in time, etc. Click "Next". Step7: In the "Summary" window, check whether the restored content and options are correct. The restore type is "Restore soon", click "Finish" to complete the restore operation. (2) Partial recovery (Partial Restore) Partial recovery refers to the recovery of the data in the differential backup or transaction log backup to the database. This recovery method is suitable for recovery when a certain part of the database is damaged; to ensure data security, regular full backups are also required. Operation steps: Step1: Enter SQL Server Management Studio, and connect to the database server to be restored. Step2: Right-click the database to be restored, select "Task" --> "Restore..." to open the restore wizard, and click "Next". Step3: In the "Select Backup Set" window, select the backup data to be restored, and click "Next". Step4: In the "Options" window, select the type of restoration (database, filegroup, file), restoration destination, disable index during restoration, etc., and click "Next". Step5: In the "Recovery" window, check "Recover only selected files and file groups" in "Optional". Step6: In the "Options" window, select the time to restore, such as after the last backup, a certain point in time, etc. Click "Next". Step7: In the "Summary" window, check whether the restored content and options are correct. The restore type is "Restore soon", click "Finish" to complete the restore operation. Summary: A good database backup and recovery plan is a prerequisite for safe operation of the database. Choose according to the actual situation of the database and the frequency of backup and recovery. Generally, it is recommended to perform a full backup once a week, and select incremental backup or differential backup according to business characteristics to meet the security and self-recovery requirements of database backup.
