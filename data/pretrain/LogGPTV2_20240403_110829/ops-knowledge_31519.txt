### How to Backup and Restore a Database

#### Common Backup Schemes

1. **Full Backup**
   - **Description**: A full backup involves backing up the entire database, including all data, indexes, stored procedures, triggers, and user-defined functions.
   - **Operation Steps**:
     1. Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and connect to the database server.
     2. Right-click on the database you want to back up, select "Tasks" -> "Back Up…", and open the backup wizard.
     3. In the "Select Backup Type" window, choose "Full" and click "Next".
     4. In the "Backup Database" window, specify the backup destination (disk or tape), backup file name, and other options. It is recommended to store backup files in a dedicated directory to prevent accidental loss.
     5. In the "Options" window, select additional options such as backing up the transaction log, compressing the backup, etc., and click "Next".
     6. Review the summary and click "Finish" to complete the backup.

2. **Differential Backup**
   - **Description**: A differential backup captures only the changes made since the last full or differential backup. This method is faster than a full backup but requires a full backup for a complete restore.
   - **Operation Steps**:
     1. Open SSMS and connect to the database server.
     2. Right-click on the database you want to back up, select "Tasks" -> "Back Up…", and open the backup wizard.
     3. In the "Select Backup Type" window, choose "Differential" and click "Next".
     4. In the "Backup Database" window, specify the backup destination, backup file name, and other options.
     5. In the "Options" window, select additional options and click "Next".
     6. Review the summary and click "Finish" to complete the backup.

#### Recovery Methods

1. **Full Recovery**
   - **Description**: Full recovery restores the database from a full backup. This method is suitable for recovering from serious damage.
   - **Operation Steps**:
     1. Open SSMS and connect to the database server.
     2. Right-click on the database you want to restore, select "Tasks" -> "Restore…", and open the restore wizard.
     3. In the "Select Backup Set" window, choose the full backup you want to restore and click "Next".
     4. In the "Options" window, specify the type of restoration (database, filegroup, file), restoration destination, and other options.
     5. In the "Recovery" window, check "Prevent recovery of unrecovered files" if needed.
     6. In the "Options" window, select the time to restore (e.g., after the last backup, at a specific point in time).
     7. Review the summary and click "Finish" to complete the restore.

2. **Partial Recovery**
   - **Description**: Partial recovery restores the database from a differential or transaction log backup. This method is suitable for recovering a specific part of the database.
   - **Operation Steps**:
     1. Open SSMS and connect to the database server.
     2. Right-click on the database you want to restore, select "Tasks" -> "Restore…", and open the restore wizard.
     3. In the "Select Backup Set" window, choose the differential or transaction log backup you want to restore and click "Next".
     4. In the "Options" window, specify the type of restoration (database, filegroup, file), restoration destination, and other options.
     5. In the "Recovery" window, check "Recover only selected files and filegroups" if needed.
     6. In the "Options" window, select the time to restore.
     7. Review the summary and click "Finish" to complete the restore.

### Summary
A well-structured database backup and recovery plan is essential for ensuring the safe operation of the database. The choice of backup and recovery methods should be based on the specific requirements and business needs. Generally, it is recommended to perform a full backup once a week and use incremental or differential backups as needed to meet the security and self-recovery requirements of the database.
