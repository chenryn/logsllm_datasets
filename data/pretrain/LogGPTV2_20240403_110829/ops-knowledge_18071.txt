User: Created a gae project with the googleappengine launch and have been building it with textmate.
Now, I'd like to import it to the Eclipse PyDev GAE project. Tried to import it, but it doesn't work.
Anyone know how to do that? 
Thanks in advance.
Assistant: You could try not using the eclipse import feature. Within Eclipse, create a new PyDev GAE project, and then you can copy in your existing files.
