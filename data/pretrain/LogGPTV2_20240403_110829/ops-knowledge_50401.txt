Subject: Seeking Guidance on Accessing a Django Application Hosted on a VM

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. We have developed a Django 1.3.1 application using Python 2.7.2 and SQL Server 2008 as the database, all hosted on a Windows Server 2008 R2 operating system within a virtual machine (VM). Our clients are using Windows 7 as their operating system.

Initially, we developed the application without considering the VM environment. However, our client has now informed us that they can only host the application on a VM. As a result, we are facing the challenge of enabling our clients to access the application from their systems to the server running on the VM.

Given my expertise in standalone systems, I am not well-versed in the intricacies of accessing applications hosted on VMs. If anyone has experience with similar setups, I would greatly appreciate it if you could share the steps or best practices for accessing the application on the VM.

We have completed the project and are eagerly awaiting guidance to resolve this issue. Any assistance or advice would be highly appreciated.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Best regards,
Shiva

### Additional Information from Community:

One possible solution, based on a slightly different setup, involves the following steps:

1. **Network Adapter Configuration:**
   - Set the network adapter to **Bridged Mode**. This allows the VM to have its own IP address and act as an independent machine on the network.
   
2. **Static IP Configuration:**
   - Configure the VM to have a static IP address. This ensures that the VM's IP address remains consistent, making it easier to access the application.

Once these settings are configured, the VM will function as a separate machine on the network. You can then access the application by navigating to the VM's IP address from any device on the same network.

If you have any further questions or need more detailed instructions, please feel free to reach out.
