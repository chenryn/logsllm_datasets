2 DATASETS
This section describes the network traffic datasets that we used for
our analysis. We utilize vantage points at the core of the Internet
(IXPs), at the backbone and peering points of a major Internet Ser-
vice Provider, and at the edge (a metropolitan university network),
all which we will describe below.
ISP-CE: Network flows from a large Central European ISP that pro-
vides service to more than 15 million fixed line subscribers and also
operates a transit network (Tier-1). The ISP does not host content
delivery servers inside its network, but it has established a large
number of peering agreements with all major content delivery and
cloud networks at multiple locations. This ISP uses NetFlow [13]
at all border routers to support its internal operations. We rely on
two different sets of NetFlow records for this paper. First, we use
NetFlow data collected at ISP’s Border Network Gateways [12] to
understand the impact of changing demands of the ISPs’ subscribers.
Second, we use NetFlow records collected at the ISP’s border routers
to gain a better understanding about how companies running their
own ASNs are affected by these changes.
IXPs: Network flows from the public peering platform of three
major Internet Exchange Points (IXPs). The first one has more than
900 members, is located in Central Europe (IXP-CE) and has peak
traffic of more than 8 Tbps. The IXP-CE is located in the same
country as the ISP-CE. The second one has more than 170 members,
is located in Southern Europe (IXP-SE) and has a peak traffic of
roughly 500 Gbps. It covers the region of the EDU network. The
third one has 250 members, is located at the US East Coast (IXP-US)
and has a peak traffic of more than 600 Gbps. At the IXPs we use
IPFIX data [16].
EDU: Network flows from the REDImadrid [53] academic network
interconnecting 16 independent universities and research centers
in the region of Madrid. It serves nearly 290,000 users including stu-
dents, faculty, researchers, student halls, WiFi networks (including
Eduroam), and administrative and support staff. The network oper-
ator provided us with anonymized NetFlow data captured at their
border routers (captured at all ingress interfaces) during 72 days in
the period of Feb 28 to May 8, 2020. The final dataset contains 5.2B
flows entering or leaving the educational network.
We augment our analysis with NetFlow records from a large
mobile operator that operates in Central Europe, with more than
40 million customers.
Normalization: Since all data sources exhibit vastly differing
traffic characteristics and volumes, we normalize the data to make
it easier to compare. For plots where we show selected weeks only,
we normalize the traffic by the minimum traffic volume. For plots
spanning a larger timeframe, we normalize the traffic by the median
traffic volume of the first ten weeks of 2020, depending on the
availability of data.
Time frame: We use two methods to reflect the developments
since the beginning of the COVID pandemic: (a) for general trends
over time we use continuous data from Jan 1, 2020—Jun 24, 2020,

2.1 Ethical Considerations
Both NetFlow and IPFIX data provide only flow summaries based
on the packet header and do not reveal any payload information.
To preserve users privacy, all data analyses are done on servers
located at the premises of the ISP, IXPs, and the academic network.
IP addresses are hashed to prevent information leaks and raw data
being transferred. The output of the analyses are the aggregated
statistics as presented in the paper. The data at the ISP and IXPs is
collected as a part of their routine network analysis. For obtaining
and analyzing the academic network data (EDU), we obtained IRB
approval from the respective institutions.
3 AGGREGATED TRAFFIC SHIFTS
To understand traffic changes during the lockdown we first look for
overall traffic shifts before, during, and after the strictest lockdown
periods. Moreover, we take a look at hypergiant ASes vs. other ASes,
shifts in link utilization, and ASes relevant for remote working.
3.1 Macroscopic Analysis
Figure 3 plots the aggregated normalized traffic volume in bytes
at the granularity of one hour for the ISP-CE, IXP-CE, IXP-US,
and IXP-SE in four selected weeks (see Table 1). For the ISP-CE,
Figure 3a shows the time series using normalized one-hour bins.
For the IXPs, Figure 3b reports the hourly average for workdays
and weekends.
First of all, we see that the overall traffic after the lockdown
increased by more than 20% for the ISP-CE and 30%/12%/2% for
the IXP-SE/IXP-CE/IXP-US, respectively. Once the lockdown mea-
sures were relaxed, the growth started declining for the ISP-CE
but persisted for the IXP-CE and the IXP-SE. These differences are
most likely attributed to the fact that the ISP-CE traffic pattern is
dominated by end-user and small enterprise traffic—recall, we are
not analyzing any transit traffic—while the IXP-CE has a wider
customer base. Traffic persistently increased for the IXP-US where
the lockdown was put into place later.
As previously noted, the ISP-CE time series shows the same
workday to weekend traffic patterns shifts starting with the lock-
down in mid-March. In accordance with that observation, traffic
increases much earlier in the day with a small dip at lunchtime.
1Due to data availability, the ISP-CE is using Apr 09–15 which covers the Easter holiday
period. As partial lockdowns and travel restrictions were still in place, the introduced
bias may be very small.
However after lunch hours, traffic grows to roughly the same vol-
ume during the evening time, spiking late in the evening. This
change persists throughout the lockdown. Once this was relaxed,
the pattern became less pronounced and the shift to a weekend like
pattern became less dominant. Additionally, it is important to note
1) the Easter vacations in the April week, and 2) the seasonal effects
in the weekend of the June week (an increase of outdoor activities).
For all IXPs, see Figure 3b, not only do we see an increase in peak
traffic but also in the minimum traffic levels. This correlates with
link capacity upgrades of many IXP members leading to overall
increases of 3% at IXP-CE, 12% at IXP in Southern Europe and 20%
at IXP at the US East Coast. In addition, we see the increase in
traffic during daytime, which is very pronounced at the IXP-CE.
However, the differences between weekends and workdays are not
as apparent as at the ISP. Interestingly, as lockdown measures were
mandated, the daytime traffic again decreases but stays well above
the pre-lockdown level. In contrast, traffic at the IXP-US barely
changes in March and increases only in April, otherwise showing
similar effects as the other IXPs. The delayed increase in volume is
likely due to the later lockdown in the US. Overall, the effects of the
time of day at this IXP are less pronounced compared to the two
others because it (a) serves customers from many different time
zones, and (b) members are diverse and include eyeball as well as
content/service providers. In contrast, the IXP-SE interconnects
more regional networks, and as such the traffic patterns are closer
to the ones of the IXP-CE.
3.2 Hypergiants
To understand the composition of residential traffic, we investigate
who is responsible for the traffic increase at the ISP-CE. The first
step is to look at the top 15 hypergiants [5, 6, 37] (full list in Ap-
pendix A.1). Hypergiants are networks with high outbound traffic
ratios that deliver content to approximately millions of users in the
locations at which we have vantage points. The 15 hypergiants we
consider in this study are responsible for about 75% of the traffic
delivered to the end-users of the ISP in Central Europe which is
consistent with recent reports in the literature [7, 52, 64]. We note
that the fraction of hypergiant traffic vs. traffic from other ASes
does not change drastically for the ISP-CE as well as all IXPs.
Given that the overall traffic has increased, we next report the
relative increase of the two AS groups compared to the median
traffic volume during the pre-lockdown period, see Figure 4. In
detail, we focus on different times of day and days within the week.
We find that the relative traffic increase is significantly larger for
other ASes than for hypergiants.
Both sets of time series are more or less on top of each other until
the lockdown. This observation also holds for data from 2019 (not
shown). However, after the lockdown, the time series for the other
ASes present higher deviations from the reference value than those
of the hypergiants. The most visually striking difference occurs
during working hours of work-days: Hypergiants experience a 40%
increase whereas the remaining ASes grow by more than 60%. While
this difference is significantly reduced around mid-May, the relative
increase for both sets of ASes is still substantial. In fact, except for
the working hours during work-days, the traffic surge seems to
normalize around mid-May, especially for other ASes. Notice the

fluctuations during weekends mornings starting around the end of
April—they can be also observed in 2019 (not shown).
A plausible explanation for the increase of daily traffic volumes
in this vantage point are family members being forced to continue
their professional and educational activities from home. Yet, the de-
mand for entertainment content—mainly video streaming—explains
the increase in traffic volume associated with hypergiants, many
of which offer such services. The increase in traffic by the other
ASes has more facets and it requires a more thorough analysis that
incorporates traffic classification methods. Before doing that, the
next subsections investigate the impact that these ASes have on
parts of the infrastructure of some of our vantage points.
3.3 Link Utilization Shifts
We analyze to which extent the observed changes are reflected in
our link utilization dataset to assess how many networks suffer
changes in their traffic characteristics. For this, we look at changes
in relative link utilization between the base week in February and
the selected week in March. We choose IXP-CE as reference van-
tage point as it houses the greatest variety of connected ASes, thus
allowing a more complete and meaningful analysis. Our dataset
reflects link capacity upgrades as well as customers switching to
PNIs. We plot the minimum, average and maximum link utiliza-
tion for all members at IXP-CE in Figure 5. Appendix B provides
additional figures comparing link utilization in other months.
Figure 5 shows a slight shift to the left during lockdown. This
denotes a tendency towards decreased link usage across many IXP
members which could be caused by link capacity upgrades or mem-
bers switching to PNIs in response to increased traffic demand [36].
It is important to note that increased link usage of a network can
be concealed by another network upgrading its port. However, the
main takeaway is that many of the non-hypergiant ASes show
changes in their link usage due to the lockdown-induced shifts in
Internet usage. To gain a better understanding of this phenome-
non, we reconsider the non-hypergiant ASes and their role in the
Internet for further analysis.
3.4 Remote-work Relevant ASes
Having observed that the relative increase in traffic during working
hours is more pronounced for non-hypergiants ASes, we study
temporal patterns to identify which ASes are relevant for remote
work, e.g., large companies with their own AS or ASes offering

the lockdown.

cloud-based products to be used by their employees. To this end, we
use the ISP in Central Europe dataset, including its transit traffic, to
compute the received and transmitted traffic per ASN.2 In addition,
we compute the traffic that each one of them sends and receives
to/from manually selected eyeball ASes, i.e., the large broadband
providers in the region. Using this data, we define three distinct
groups of ASes: those whose traffic ratio of workday/weekend

traffic is dominated by workdays, those who are balanced, and
those in which weekend traffic patterns dominate.
We focus on the first group, as we expect companies and en-
terprise subscribers deploying remote working solutions for their
employees to fall into this class. We crosscheck their AS numbers
with the WHOIS database. We find that a small number of content-
heavy ASes also fall in this category. In Figure 6 we show the
difference in normalized traffic volumes between a base week in
February and one in March after the lockdown began (x-axis) vs. the
normalized difference in traffic from/to eyeball ASes. We observe
that some ASes experience major traffic shifts, but with almost no
residential traffic (scattered along the x-axis, and close to 0 in the
y-axis). However, for a majority of the ASes, there is a correlation
between the increase in traffic involving eyeball networks and the
total increase. This suggests that most of the traffic change is due to
eyeball networks. Interestingly, some ASes suffer a decrease in total
traffic, yet residential traffic grows (top-left quadrant). These are
likely companies that either offer online services that became less
popular and relevant during the lockdown or that do not generate
traffic to the Internet “internally”. When looking at the other AS
groups (not shown), the correlation still exists but is weaker.
These observations help us to put the implications of the lock-
down measures in perspective: Some ASes need to provision a sig-
nificant amount of extra capacity to support new traffic demands
in an unforeseen fashion. In the following sections, we will explore
which specific traffic categories have experienced most dramatic
changes.
4 TRANSPORT-LAYER ANALYSIS
Based on the overall traffic pattern shifts identified in Section 3, in
this section we focus on differences in raw transport port-protocol
distributions.
We analyze the shift in application traffic due to the lockdown at
two vantage points, the ISP in Central Europe (ISP-CE) and the IXP
in Central Europe (IXP-CE). At both networks, we aggregate traffic
