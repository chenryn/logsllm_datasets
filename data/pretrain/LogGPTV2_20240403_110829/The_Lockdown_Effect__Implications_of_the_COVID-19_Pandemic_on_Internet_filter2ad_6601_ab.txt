### 2. DATASETS

This section provides a detailed description of the network traffic datasets used for our analysis. We collected data from multiple vantage points, including the core of the Internet (Internet Exchange Points, IXPs), the backbone and peering points of a major Internet Service Provider (ISP), and an edge network (a metropolitan university network). Each vantage point is described below.

#### 2.1. ISP-CE
- **Description**: Network flows from a large Central European ISP serving over 15 million fixed-line subscribers. The ISP also operates a Tier-1 transit network.
- **Peering**: The ISP has established numerous peering agreements with major content delivery and cloud networks at multiple locations.
- **Data Collection**: NetFlow [13] data is collected at all border routers to support internal operations.
- **Datasets**:
  - **Border Network Gateways**: NetFlow data collected to understand the impact of changing subscriber demands.
  - **Border Routers**: NetFlow records to analyze how companies running their own ASNs are affected by these changes.

#### 2.2. IXPs
- **Description**: Network flows from the public peering platforms of three major Internet Exchange Points (IXPs).
  - **IXP-CE**: Located in Central Europe, with over 900 members and peak traffic exceeding 8 Tbps.
  - **IXP-SE**: Located in Southern Europe, with over 170 members and peak traffic around 500 Gbps, covering the region of the EDU network.
  - **IXP-US**: Located on the US East Coast, with 250 members and peak traffic over 600 Gbps.
- **Data Collection**: IPFIX data [16] is used for these IXPs.

#### 2.3. EDU
- **Description**: Network flows from the REDImadrid [53] academic network, interconnecting 16 independent universities and research centers in Madrid, serving nearly 290,000 users.
- **Data Collection**: Anonymized NetFlow data captured at border routers during 72 days from February 28 to May 8, 2020. The final dataset contains 5.2 billion flows entering or leaving the educational network.

#### 2.4. Mobile Operator
- **Description**: NetFlow records from a large mobile operator in Central Europe, serving over 40 million customers.

#### 2.5. Data Normalization
- **Purpose**: To facilitate comparison, we normalize the data due to varying traffic characteristics and volumes.
- **Methods**:
  - For plots showing selected weeks, traffic is normalized by the minimum traffic volume.
  - For plots spanning a larger timeframe, traffic is normalized by the median traffic volume of the first ten weeks of 2020, depending on data availability.

#### 2.6. Time Frame
- **General Trends**: Continuous data from January 1, 2020, to June 24, 2020.
- **Weekly Analysis**: Comparison of 7-day periods before, during, and after the lockdown, as shown in Table 1.

### 2.1. Ethical Considerations
- **Privacy Protection**: Both NetFlow and IPFIX data provide only flow summaries based on packet headers, without revealing payload information.
- **Data Handling**: All analyses are conducted on servers located at the premises of the ISP, IXPs, and the academic network. IP addresses are hashed to prevent information leaks.
- **Approval**: IRB approval was obtained for analyzing the academic network data (EDU).

### 3. AGGREGATED TRAFFIC SHIFTS

To understand the traffic changes during the lockdown, we first examine overall traffic shifts before, during, and after the strictest lockdown periods. We also analyze hypergiant ASes versus other ASes, shifts in link utilization, and ASes relevant for remote working.

#### 3.1. Macroscopic Analysis
- **Figure 3**: Plots the aggregated normalized traffic volume in bytes at one-hour granularity for the ISP-CE, IXP-CE, IXP-US, and IXP-SE in four selected weeks (see Table 1).
- **Observations**:
  - **Overall Traffic Increase**: 
    - ISP-CE: >20%
    - IXP-SE: 30%
    - IXP-CE: 12%
    - IXP-US: 2%
  - **Traffic Patterns**:
    - ISP-CE: Workday to weekend traffic patterns shifted starting in mid-March, with earlier increases and a small dip at lunchtime.
    - IXPs: Increased peak and minimum traffic levels, likely due to link capacity upgrades. Daytime traffic increased, but differences between weekends and workdays were less pronounced.

#### 3.2. Hypergiants
- **Top 15 Hypergiants**: Responsible for about 75% of the traffic delivered to end-users in Central Europe.
- **Relative Traffic Increase**:
  - Other ASes experienced a more significant relative increase compared to hypergiants, especially during working hours.
  - By mid-May, the traffic surge normalized, except during working hours.

#### 3.3. Link Utilization Shifts
- **Analysis**: Changes in relative link utilization between the base week in February and the selected week in March.
- **Vantage Point**: IXP-CE, which houses a diverse set of connected ASes.
- **Observations**:
  - Slight shift to decreased link usage, possibly due to link capacity upgrades or members switching to PNIs.
  - Non-hypergiant ASes showed changes in link usage due to lockdown-induced shifts in Internet usage.

#### 3.4. Remote-work Relevant ASes
- **Analysis**: Temporal patterns to identify ASes relevant for remote work.
- **Method**: Using ISP-CE data, including transit traffic, to compute received and transmitted traffic per ASN.
- **Groups**:
  - ASes with workday-dominated traffic.
  - Balanced ASes.
  - ASes with weekend-dominated traffic.
- **Observations**:
  - Some ASes experienced major traffic shifts with minimal residential traffic.
  - Most ASes showed a correlation between the increase in traffic involving eyeball networks and the total increase.

### 4. TRANSPORT-LAYER ANALYSIS

Based on the overall traffic pattern shifts identified in Section 3, this section focuses on differences in raw transport port-protocol distributions.

- **Vantage Points**: ISP in Central Europe (ISP-CE) and IXP in Central Europe (IXP-CE).
- **Analysis**: Aggregated traffic data to identify specific traffic categories that experienced the most dramatic changes.
