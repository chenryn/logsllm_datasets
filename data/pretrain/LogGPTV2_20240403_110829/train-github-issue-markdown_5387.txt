I'm experiencing an issue with Visual Studio Code on my Mac where I am unable to save modified files. Despite restarting both VS Code and my Mac, the problem persists. Whenever I attempt to save a file using `Cmd + S`, the following dialog appears:

Here are some additional details:
- **VS Code Version**: 0.10.6
- **Developer Information**:

If anyone has encountered this issue or has any suggestions for resolving it, I would greatly appreciate your help.
