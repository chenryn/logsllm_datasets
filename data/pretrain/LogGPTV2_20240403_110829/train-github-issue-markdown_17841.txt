### Version
2.5.17
### Reproduction link
https://codesandbox.io/s/zzq75rm38x
### Steps to reproduce
Create a component, A, which makes use of `$listeners` in the template
somehow.  
Create a component, B, that includes component A, so that an instance of B is
parent of an instance of A.  
Attach an event listener to A in B.  
Update state in component B somehow.
### What is expected?
Component B should update, and component A should be unaffected.
### What is actually happening?
Component A is updated. It is rendered again, and the update lifecycle hooks
are triggered.
