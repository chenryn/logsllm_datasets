### Roadmap/Ideas
Previous 6.0 Discussion: https://phabricator.babeljs.io/T2168
Just wrote this up real quick a week ago so for some ideas we should
definetely do
#### Ease of use
  * Fix plugin ordering, edge cases in traversal and conflicting transforms 
    * relevant PRs: #3281 experimental passPerPreset, #3335 Lossy traversal
  * `babel init` (to setup a `.babelrc`) T6956:
  * Similarly, a `babel-plugin init` (to make a plugin) - https://github.com/thejameskyle/generator-babel-plugin
  * Preset options (ex: 'loose mode' options, turning off commonjs, different env (browser, node) 
    * relevant PRs: #3331 passing options to presets, #3349 configurable preset
#### Internal Development
  * Better infrastructure release process with lerna
    * relevant PRs: kittens/lerna#65 canary releases, kittens/lerna#29 changelog automation
  * Debugging/Performance Tracking 
    * relevant issues: #3283 awesome `babel-generator` optimisation
  * Typechecking/Code Coverage - flow + babel-plugin-instanbul
#### Wish List
  * Automating generating a config of presets/plugins based on target environments (caniuse/autoprefixer, or dynamically) 
    * Relevant links: https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/javascript-needs-compile-step/
  * Other tooling intergrations (Minifying, Linting, Flow/Typescript)
  * Syntax Plugins 
    * Move babylon out of babel repo
    * Move jsx/flow out of babylon
    * relevant PRs #3376
  * Cross-file transformations, knowing the dependency graph
  * Async API
#### Community
  * Can always work on.. 
    * Develop in the open more (#development slack)
    * Making it easier to contribute: better docs, easier setup, etc (do we want to use github issues again)
    * Reaching out for help with issue triage, more contributors, etc
    * Users could submit PRs with reproducible test cases instead of just posting snippets (ex: #3253)
    * Watch open source projects using Babel
  * Roadmap (something like this)
  * How to write plugins (https://github.com/thejameskyle/babel-handbook)
  * Bring back a FAQ, add common stackoverflow/slack questions, etc.
  * Post a simple newsletter for what's been going on in the babel community (new plugins, blogs, videos, ideas, etc)?
  * Documentation of APIs
