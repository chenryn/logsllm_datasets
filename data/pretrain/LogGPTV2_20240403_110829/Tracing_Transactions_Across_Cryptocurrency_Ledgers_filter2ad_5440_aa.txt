Abstract
One of the deﬁning features of a cryptocurrency is that its
ledger, containing all transactions that have ever taken place,
is globally visible. As one consequence of this degree of
transparency, a long line of recent research has demonstrated
that — even in cryptocurrencies that are speciﬁcally designed
to improve anonymity — it is often possible to track money
as it changes hands, and in some cases to de-anonymize users
entirely. With the recent proliferation of alternative cryptocur-
rencies, however, it becomes relevant to ask not only whether
or not money can be traced as it moves within the ledger
of a single cryptocurrency, but if it can in fact be traced as
it moves across ledgers. This is especially pertinent given
the rise in popularity of automated trading platforms such
as ShapeShift, which make it effortless to carry out such
cross-currency trades. In this paper, we use data scraped from
ShapeShift over a thirteen-month period and the data from
eight different blockchains to explore this question. Beyond
developing new heuristics and creating new types of links
across cryptocurrency ledgers, we also identify various pat-
terns of cross-currency trades and of the general usage of these
platforms, with the ultimate goal of understanding whether
they serve a criminal or a proﬁt-driven agenda.
1 Introduction
For the past decade, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have
been touted for their transformative potential, both as a new
form of electronic cash and as a platform to “re-decentralize”
aspects of the Internet and computing in general. In terms of
their role as cash, however, it has been well established by
now that the usage of pseudonyms in Bitcoin does not achieve
meaningful levels of anonymity [1,11,17,18,21], which casts
doubt on its role as a payment mechanism. Furthermore, the
ability to track ﬂows of coins is not limited to Bitcoin: it ex-
tends even to so-called “privacy coins” like Dash [10, 12],
Monero [4, 7, 13, 24], and Zcash [6, 16] that incorporate fea-
tures explicitly designed to improve on Bitcoin’s anonymity
guarantees.
Traditionally, criminals attempting to cash out illicit funds
would have to use exchanges; indeed, most tracking tech-
niques rely on identifying the addresses associated with these
exchanges as a way to observe when these deposits hap-
pen [11]. Nowadays, however, exchanges typically imple-
ment strict Know Your Customer/Anti-Money Laundering
(KYC/AML) policies to comply with regulatory requirements,
meaning criminals (and indeed all users) risk revealing their
real identities when using them. Users also run risks when
storing their coins in accounts at custodial exchanges, as ex-
changes may be hacked or their coins may otherwise become
inaccessible [9, 19]. As an alternative, there have emerged
in the past few years frictionless trading platforms such as
ShapeShift1 and Changelly,2 in which users are able to trade
between cryptocurrencies without having to store their coins
with the platform provider. Furthermore, while ShapeShift
now requires users to have veriﬁed accounts [22], this was
not the case before October 2018.
Part of the reason for these trading platforms to exist is the
sheer rise in the number of different cryptocurrencies: accord-
ing to the popular cryptocurrency data tracker CoinMarketCap
there were 36 cryptocurrencies in September 2013, only 7 of
which had a stated market capitalization of over 1 million
USD,3 whereas in January 2019 there were 2117 cryptocur-
rencies, of which the top 10 had a market capitalization of
over 100 million USD. Given this proliferation of new cryp-
tocurrencies and platforms that make it easy to transact across
them, it becomes important to consider not just whether or
not ﬂows of coins can be tracked within the transaction ledger
of a given currency, but also if they can be tracked as coins
move across their respective ledgers as well. This is especially
important given that there are documented cases of criminals
attempting to use these cross-currency trades to obscure the
ﬂow of their coins: the WannaCry ransomware operators, for
example, were observed using ShapeShift to convert their
ransomed bitcoins into Monero [3]. More generally, these

services have the potential to offer an insight into the broader
cryptocurrency ecosystem and the thousands of currencies it
now contains.
In this paper, we initiate an exploration of the usage of these
cross-currency trading platforms, and the potential they offer
in terms of the ability to track ﬂows of coins as they move
across different transaction ledgers. Here we rely on three
distinct sources of data: the cryptocurrency blockchains, the
data collected via our own interactions with these trading plat-
forms, and — as we describe in Section 4 — the information
offered by the platforms themselves via their public APIs.
We begin in Section 5 by identifying the speciﬁc on-chain
transactions associated with an advertised ShapeShift trans-
action, which we are able to do with a relatively high degree
of success (identifying both the deposit and withdrawal trans-
actions 81.91% of the time, on average). We then describe
in Section 6 the different transactional patterns that can be
traced by identifying the relevant on-chain transactions, focus-
ing speciﬁcally on patterns that may be indicative of trading
or money laundering, and on the ability to link addresses
across different currency ledgers. We then move in Section 7
to consider both old and new heuristics for clustering together
addresses associated with ShapeShift, with particular atten-
tion paid to our new heuristic concerning the common social
relationships revealed by the usage of ShapeShift. Finally, we
bring all the analysis together by applying it to several case
studies in Section 8. Again, our particular focus in this last sec-
tion is on the phenomenon of trading and other proﬁt-driven
activity, and the extent to which usage of the ShapeShift plat-
form seems to be motivated by criminal activity or a more
general desire for anonymity.
2 Related Work
We are not aware of any other research exploring these cross-
currency trading platforms, but consider as related all research
that explores the level of anonymity achieved by cryptocur-
rencies. This work is complementary to our own, as the tech-
niques it develops can be combined with ours to track the
entire ﬂow of cryptocurrencies as they move both within and
across different ledgers.
Much of the earlier research in this vein focused on Bit-
coin [1, 11, 17, 18, 21], and operates by adopting the so-called
“multi-input” heuristic, which says that all input addresses in
a transaction belong to the same entity (be it an individual or
a service such as an exchange). While the accuracy of this
heuristic has been somewhat eroded by privacy-enhancing
techniques like CoinJoin [8], new techniques have been de-
veloped to avoid such false positives [12], and as such it has
now been accepted as standard and incorporated into many
tools for Bitcoin blockchain analytics.45 Once addresses are
4https://www.chainalysis.com/
5https://www.elliptic.co/
clustered together in this manner, the entity can then further
be identiﬁed using hand-collected tags that form a ground-
truth dataset. We adopt both of these techniques in order to
analyze the clusters formed by ShapeShift and Changelly in a
variety of cryptocurrency blockchains, although as described
in Section 7 we ﬁnd them to be relatively unsuccessful in this
setting.
In response to the rise of newer “privacy coins”, a recent
line of research has also worked to demonstrate that the de-
ployed versions of these cryptocurrencies have various prop-
erties that diminish the level of anonymity they achieve in
practice. This includes work targeting Dash [10, 12], Mon-
ero [4, 7, 13, 24], and Zcash [6, 16].
In terms of Dash, its main privacy feature is similar to Coin-
Join, in which different senders join forces to create a single
transaction representing their transfer to a diverse set of re-
cipients. Despite the intention for this to hide which recipient
addresses belong to which senders, research has demonstrated
that such links can in fact be created based on the value being
transacted [10, 12]. Monero, which allows senders to hide
which input belongs to them by using “mix-ins” consisting
of the keys of other users, is vulnerable to de-anonymization
attacks exploiting the (now-obsolete) case in which some
users chose not to use mix-ins, or exploiting inferences about
the age of the coins used as mix-ins [4, 7, 13, 24]. Finally,
Zcash is similar to Bitcoin, but with the addition of a privacy
feature called the shielded pool, which can be used to hide the
values and addresses of the senders and recipients involved
in a transaction. Recent research has shown that it is possi-
ble to signiﬁcantly reduce the anonymity set provided by the
shielded pool, by developing simple heuristics for identifying
links between hidden and partly obscured transactions [6, 16].
3 Background
3.1 Cryptocurrencies
The ﬁrst decentralized cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, was created by
Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 [14] and deployed in January 2009.
At the most basic level, bitcoins are digital assets that can be
traded between sets of users without the need for any trusted
intermediary. Bitcoins can be thought of as being stored in a
public key, which is controlled by the entity in possession of
the associated private key. A single user can store their assets
across many public keys, which act as pseudonyms with no
inherent link to the user’s identity. In order to spend them, a
user can form and cryptographically sign a transaction that
acts to send the bitcoins to a recipient of their choice. Beyond
Bitcoin, other platforms now offer more robust functionality.
For example, Ethereum allows users to deploy smart contracts
onto the blockchain, which act as stateful programs that can be
triggered by transactions providing inputs to their functions.
In order to prevent double-spending, many cryptocurren-
cies are UTXO-based, meaning coins are associated not with
838    28th USENIX Security Symposium

an address but with a uniquely identiﬁable UTXO (unspent
transaction output) that is created for all outputs in a given
transaction. This means that one address could be associated
with potentially many UTXOs (corresponding to each time
it has received coins), and that inputs to transactions are also
UTXOs rather than addresses. Checking for double-spending
is then just a matter of checking if an input is in the current
UTXO‘set, and removing it from the set once it spends it
contents.
3.2 Digital asset trading platforms
In contrast to a traditional (custodial) exchange, a digital
asset trading platform allows users to move between different
cryptocurrencies without storing any money in an account
with the service; in other words, users keep their own money
in their own accounts and the platform has it only at the time
that a trade is being executed. To initiate such a trade, a user
approaches the service and selects a supported input currency
curIn (i.e., the currency from which they would like to move
money) and a supported output currency curOut (the currency
that they would like to obtain). A user additionally speciﬁes
a destination address addru in the curOut blockchain, which
is the address to which the output currency will be sent. The
service then presents the user with an exchange rate rate
and an address addrs in the curIn blockchain to which to
send money, as well as a miner fee fee that accounts for the
transaction it must form in the curOut blockchain. The user
then sends to this address addrs the amount amt in curIn they
wish to convert, and after some delay the service sends the
appropriate amount of the output currency to the speciﬁed
destination address addru. This means that an interaction with
these services results in two transactions: one on the curIn
blockchain sending amt to addrs, and one on the curOut
blockchain sending (roughly) rate· amt− fee to addru.
This describes an interaction with an abstracted platform.
Today, the two best-known examples are ShapeShift and
Changelly. Whereas Changelly has always required account
creation, ShapeShift introduced this requirement only in Oc-
tober 2018. Each platform supports dozens of cryptocurren-
cies, ranging from better-known ones such as Bitcoin and
Ethereum to lesser-known ones such as FirstBlood and Clams.
In Section 4, we describe in more depth the operations of
these speciﬁc platforms and our own interactions with them.
4 Data Collection and Statistics
In this section, we describe our data sources, as well as
some preliminary statistics about the collected data. We be-
gin in Section 4.1 by describing our own interactions with
Changelly, a trading platform with a limited personal API.
We then describe in Section 4.2 both our own interactions
with ShapeShift, and the data we were able to scrape from
their public API, which provided us with signiﬁcant insight
into their overall set of transactions. Finally, we describe in
Section 4.3 our collection of the data backing eight different
cryptocurrencies.
4.1 Changelly
Changelly offers a simple API6 that allows registered users
to carry out transactions with the service. Using this API, we
engaged in 22 transactions, using the most popular ShapeShift
currencies (Table 1) to guide our choices for curIn and
curOut.
While doing these transactions, we observed that they
would sometimes take up to an hour to complete. This is
because Changelly attempts to minimize double-spending
risk by requiring users to wait for a set number of conﬁrma-
tions (shown to the user at the time of their transaction) in the
curIn blockchain before executing the transfer on the curOut
blockchain. We used this observation to guide our choice of
parameters in our identiﬁcation of on-chain transactions in
Section 5.
4.2 ShapeShift
ShapeShift’s API7 allows users to execute their own trans-
actions, of which we did 18 in total. As with Changelly, we
were able to gain some valuable insights about the opera-
tion of the platform via these personal interactions. Whereas
ShapeShift did not disclose the number of conﬁrmations they
waited for on the curIn blockchain, we again observed long
delays, indicating that they were also waiting for a sufﬁcient
number.
Beyond these personal interactions, the API provides in-
formation on the operation of the service as a whole. Most
notably, it provides three separate pieces of information: (1)
the current trading rate between any pair of cryptocurrencies,
(2) a list of up to 50 of the most recent transactions that have
taken place (across all users), and (3) full details of a spe-
ciﬁc ShapeShift transaction given the address addrs in the
curIn blockchain (i.e., the address to which the user sent their
coins).
For the trading rates, ShapeShift provides the following
information for all cryptocurrency pairs (curIn, curOut): the
rate, the limit (i.e., the maximum that can be exchanged), the
minimum that can be exchanged, and the miner fee (denom-
inated in curOut). For the 50 most recent transactions, in-
formation is provided in the form: (curIn, curOut, amt,t, id),
where the ﬁrst three of these are as discussed in Section 3.2,
t is a UNIX timestamp, and id is an internal identiﬁer for
this transaction. For the transaction information, when
provided with a speciﬁc addrs ShapeShift provides the
tuple
(status, address, withdraw, inCoin, inType, outCoin,
outType, tx, txURL, error). The status ﬁeld is a ﬂag that is
