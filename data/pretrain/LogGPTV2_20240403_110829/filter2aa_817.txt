#### Presented at DEF CON 18, July 30, 2010

#### What is the FOIA?
The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) is a federal law that allows anyone to request records from U.S. federal agencies. An agency must provide the requested information unless it has a valid reason to withhold it.

#### Valid Reasons for Withholding Information
- **Classified Information**
- **Law Enforcement Sensitive Information**
- **Proprietary Information/Trade Secrets**
- **Privileged Communications**
- **Personal Privacy Concerns**
- **Other Statutory Prohibitions**
- **Internal Personnel Rules and Practices**

#### How to Determine What to Request
To identify the information you need, be observant and gather information from various sources:
- News reports
- Press releases
- Government reports
- Congressional hearings
- And other relevant documents

#### How to Identify the Correct Agency
Determine which federal agency is most likely to hold the information you seek. There may be multiple agencies involved. Check the agency's website for contact information and specific instructions on submitting FOIA requests.

#### How to Write Your FOIA Request
- **Be Specific:** Clearly describe the information you are seeking.
- **Write Clearly:** Use language that is easy for a non-expert to understand.
- **Provide Supporting Documentation:** Include any relevant news articles or other supporting materials.
- **Request Expedited Processing:** If your request is urgent, explain why expedited processing is necessary.
- **Request Fee Waivers or Reductions:** If applicable, ask for reduced fees. You may not have to pay search or review fees if you can demonstrate that you are a member of the media, an educational institution, or a scientific organization, and that the request is not for commercial use.

#### Special Considerations for Requests About Yourself
- **Use Both FOIA and the Privacy Act:** If you are a U.S. citizen or permanent legal resident, you can also use the Privacy Act to request information about yourself.
- **Provide Personal Information:** Include your name, aliases, address, phone number, date of birth, place of birth, and Social Security Number (if available).
- **Certify Under Penalty of Perjury:** Confirm that the information you provide is accurate.
- **Check for Online Forms:** Many agencies offer online forms or submission methods that can simplify the process.

#### The Waiting Period
Agencies are required to respond within 20 working days, but delays are common.

#### What to Do If There is No Response
- **Follow Up:** Contact the agency to inquire about the status of your request.
- **File an Appeal:** If your request is denied, you can appeal the decision.
- **Seek Legal Action:** If the agency does not respond within 20 working days or denies your appeal, you may consider filing a lawsuit.
- **Contact the FOIA Ombudsman:** The Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) can help mediate disputes.
- **Continue Waiting:** Sometimes, patience is the only option.
