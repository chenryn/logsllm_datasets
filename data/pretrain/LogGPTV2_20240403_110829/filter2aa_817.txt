What’s the FOIA?
The Freedom of Information Act is a law that 
lets anyone ask for records from federal 
agencies.
An agency has to give you the stuff you ask for 
unless it thinks that there’s a good reason not 
to give it to you.
What are good reasons not to 
give it to you?
 Classified
 Law enforcement
 Proprietary information/trade secrets
 Privileged
 Privacy
 Other laws say it doesn’t have to be disclosed
 Internal personnel rules and practices
How do you know what to ask 
for?
Be observant.
news reports 
press releases
government reports
congressional hearings
etc., etc. etc.
How do you know where to send 
your request?
Figure out which agency is most likely to 
have the stuff you’re looking for. 
There may be more than one.
Check the agency’s website for contact 
information.
How do you write your request?
 Describe what you want as precisely as possible.
 Write for a lay reader.
 Provide supporting news articles, etc., if there are 
any.
 Consider asking for expedited processing.
How do you write your request?
 If appropriate, ask for reduced fees. 
Note: You may not have to pay search or review 
fees if you can show that you’re a member of the 
media or an educational or scientific institution, and 
you’re not requesting stuff for commercial use.
What if I’m asking about myself?
 FOIA works. Privacy Act does, too, if you’re a 
U.S. citizen or permanent legal resident.
 You’ll need to provide some personal 
information such as name, aliases, address, 
phone number, date of birth, place of birth, and 
SSN (optional).
What if I’m asking about myself?
 You’ll need to certify under penalty of perjury 
that you’re not providing false information.
 Check the agency website for FOIA/PA 
request forms or ways to submit online, which 
might make the whole thing easier.
And then you wait.
They’re supposed to get back to you within 
20 working days, but they probably won’t.
So then what?
You can badger them.
You can sue them.
You can contact the new FOIA ombudsman.
You can keep waiting.
What if they respond, but refuse 
to give you stuff?
Well, you’ll have to appeal.
If they don’t respond within 20 working 
days or deny your appeal, you can sue.
