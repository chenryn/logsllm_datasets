Assistant: This log chunk shows the system waking up from sleep, connecting to a Wi-Fi network, and attempting to authenticate. The log also shows the system attempting to connect to a server, as well as other processes such as networkd, UserEventAgent, and configd. Finally, the log shows the system receiving a capture event.
