This means that a long-term study of the Alexa Top 1M will, over
the course of this year, have measured 13.5M distinct domains.
Across all lists, we find an average of 20% to 33% of daily changing
domains to be new domains, i.e., entering the list for the first time.
This also implies that 66% to 80% of daily changing domains are
domains that are repeatedly removed from and inserted into a list.
We also show these and the equivalent Top 1k numbers in column
µN EW of Table 2.

test. This method allows us to statistically determine to what degree
the distribution of a domain’s ranks on weekdays and weekends
overlap, and is shown in Figure 3a. We include Majestic as a base
line without a weekly pattern. For Alexa Top 1M, we can see that
≈35% of domains have a KS distance of one, meaning that their
weekend and weekday distributions have no data point in common.
This feature is also present in Umbrella’s rank, where over 15% of
domains have a KS distance of 1. The changes are less pronounced
for the Top 1k Alexa and Umbrella lists, suggesting that the top
domains are more stable. As a reference, the KS distance when
comparing weekdays to weekdays and weekends to weekends is
much lower. For 90% of domains in Alexa or Umbrella (Top 1k or
Top 1M) the distance is lower than 0.05. The KS distance is lower
than 0.02 for all of the domains in Majestic rankings (Top 1k or
Top 1M). This demonstrates that a certain set of domains, the ma-
jority of them localised in the long-tail, present disjunct rankings
between weekends and weekdays.
What Domains are More Popular on Weekends? This leads
to the question about the nature of domains changing in popularity
with a weekly pattern. To investigate this, we group domains by
“second-level-domain” (SLD), which we define as the label left of a
public suffix per the Public Suffix list [93]. Figures 3b and 3c display
the time dynamics of SLD groups for which the number of domains
varies by more than 40% between weekdays and weekends. For
Alexa, we can see stable behaviour before its February 2018 change.
We see that some groups such as blogspot.*8 or tumblr.com are
significantly more popular on weekends than on weekdays. The
opposite is true for domains under sharepoint.com (a web-based
8We include all blogspot.* domains in the same group
Microsoft Office platform). Umbrella shows the same behaviour,
with nessus.org (a threat intelligence tool) more popular during
the week, and ampproject.org (a dominant website performance
optimisation framework), and nflxso.net (a Netflix domain) more
popular on weekends. These examples confirm that different Inter-
net usage on weekends9 is a cause for the weekly patterns.
6.3 Order of Domains in Top Lists
As top lists are sorted, a statistical analysis of order variation com-
pletes our view of top lists’ stability. We use the Kendall rank corre-
lation coefficient [108], commonly known as Kendall’s τ coefficient,
to measure rank correlation, i.e., the similarity in the order of lists.
Kendall’s correlation between two variables will be high when
observations have a similar order between the two variables, and
low when observations have a dissimilar (or fully different for a
correlation of -1) rank between the two variables.
In Figure 4, we show the CDF of Kendall’s τ rank correlation
coefficient for the Alexa, Umbrella and Majestic Top 1k domains
in two cases: (i) for day to day comparisons; (ii) for a static com-
parison to the first day in the JOINT dataset. For analysis, we can
compare the percentage of very strongly correlated ranks, i.e., the
ranks for which Kendall’s τ is higher than 0.95. For day to day com-
parisons, Majestic is clearly most similar at 99%, with Alexa (72%)
and Umbrella (40%) both showing considerably dissimilarities.
When compared for a reference day, very strong correlation
drops below 5% for all lists. This suggests that the order variations
are not perceived in the short term, but may arise when considering
longer temporal windows.

statistics [7, 109]. There is no further information about these tool-
bars besides Alexa’s own toolbar. Alexa also provides data to The
Internet Archive to add new sites [92]. It has been speculated that
Alexa provides tracking information to feed the Amazon recommen-
dation and profiling engine since Amazon’s purchase of Alexa in
1999 [110]. To better understand the ranking mechanism behind the
Alexa list, we reverse engineer the Alexa toolbar10 and investigate
what data it gathers. Upon installation, the toolbar fetches a unique
identifier which is stored in the browser’s local storage, called the
Alexa ID (aid). This identifier is used for distinctly tracking the
device. During installation, Alexa requests information about age,
(binary) gender, household income, ethnicity, education, children,
and the toolbar installation location (home/work). All of these are
linked to the aid. After installation, the toolbar transfers for each
visited site: the page URL, screen/page sizes, referer, window IDs,
tab IDs, and loading time metrics. For a scarce set of 8 search en-
gine and shopping URLs11, referer and URL are anonymised to their
host name. For all other domains, the entire URL, including all GET
parameters, is transmitted to Alexa’s servers under data.alexa.com.
Because of the injected JavaScript, the visit is only transmitted if
the site actually exists and was loaded. In April 2018, Alexa’s API
DNS name had a rank of ≈30k in the Umbrella list, indicating at
least 10k unique source IP addresses querying that DNS domain
name through OpenDNS per day (cf §7.2).
Due to its dominance, the Alexa rank of a domain is an impor-
tant criterion in domain trading and search engine optimisation.
Unsurprisingly, there is a gray area industry of sites promising to
“optimise” the Alexa rank of a site for money [111–113]. Although
sending synthetic data to Alexa’s backend API should be possible
at reasonable effort, we refrain from doing so for two reasons: (i) in
April 2018, the backend API has changed, breaking communication
with the toolbar, and (ii) unclear ethical implications of actively
injecting values into this API. We refer the interested reader to
le Pochat et al. [114], who have recently succeeded in manipulating
Alexa ranks through the toolbar API.
7.2 Umbrella
As the Umbrella list is solely based on DNS queries through the
OpenDNS public resolver, it mainly reflects domains frequently
resolved, not necessarily domains visited by humans, as confirmed
in §5.3. Examples are the Internet scanning machines of various
research institutions, which likely show up in the Umbrella ranking

Figure 4: CDF of Kendall’s τ between top lists.
Investigating the Long Tail: To compare higher and lower
ranked domains, we take three exemplary domains from the Top
100 and the lower ranks as examples. Table 4 summarises the results.
For each of the six domains, we compute the highest, median, and
lowest rank over the duration of the JOINT dataset. The difference
of variability between top and bottom domains is striking and in
line with our previous findings: the ranks of top domains are fairly
stable, while the ranks of bottom domains vary drastically.
6.4 Summary
We investigate the stability of top lists, and find abrupt changes,
weekly patterns, and significant churn for some lists. Lower ranked
domains fluctuate more, but the effect heavily depends on the list
and the subset (Top 1k or Top 1M). We can confirm that the weekly
pattern stems from leisure-oriented domains being more popular
on weekends, and give examples for domain rank variations.
7 UNDERSTANDING AND INFLUENCING TOP
LISTS RANKING MECHANISMS
We have seen that top lists can be rather unstable from day to day,
and hence we investigate what traffic levels are required and at what
effort it is possible to manipulate the ranking of a certain domain. As
discussed previously, the Alexa list is based on its browser toolbar
and “various other sources”, Umbrella is based on OpenDNS queries,
and Majestic is based on the count of subnets with inbound links to
the domain in question. In this section, we investigate the ranking
mechanisms of these top lists more closely.

extensions” to calculate site ranks through visitor and page view

data [119]. As this approach is similar to PageRank [120], except
that Majestic does not weigh incoming links by the originating
domain, it is to be expected that referral services can increase a
domain’s popularity. We can, however, not see an efficient way to
influence a domain’s rank in the Majestic list without using such re-
ferral services. Le Pochat et al. [114] recently influenced a domain’s
rank in the Majestic link through such purchasing of back links.
8 IMPACT ON RESEARCH RESULTS
§3 highlighted that top lists are broadly used in networking, security
and systems research. Their use is especially prevalent in Internet
measurement research, where top lists are used to study aspects
across all layers. This motivates us to understand the impact of
top list usage on the outcome of these studies. As the replication
of all studies covered in our survey is not possible, we evaluate
the impact of the lists’ structure on research results in the Internet
measurement field by investigating (i) common layers, such as DNS
and IP, that played a role in many studies, and (ii) a sample of
specific studies across a variety of layers, aiming for one specific
study per layer.
We evaluate those scientific results with 3 questions in mind:
(i) what is the bias when using a top list as compared to a general
population of all com/net/org domains12 (ii) what is the difference
in result when using a different top list? (iii) what is the difference
in result when using a top list from a different day?
8.1 Domain Name System (DNS)
A typical first step in list usage is DNS resolution, which is also
a popular research focus (cf. §3). We split this view into a record
type perspective (e.g., IPv6 adoption) and a hosting infrastructure
perspective (e.g., CDN prevalence and AS mapping). For both, we
download lists and run measurements daily over the course of one
year.
8.1.1 Record Type Perspective. We investigate the share of NX-
DOMAIN domains and IPv6-enabled domains, and the share of
CAA-enabled domains as an example of a DNS-based measurement
study [122]. Results are shown in Table 5 and Figure 6.
Assessing list quality via NXDOMAIN: We begin by using
NXDOMAIN as a proxy measure for assessing the quality of en-
tries in the top lists. An NXDOMAIN error code in return to a
DNS query means that the queried DNS name does not exist at
the respective authoritative nameserver. This error code is unex-
pected for allegedly popular domains. Ideally, a top list would only
provide existing domains. Surprisingly, we find the amount of NX-
DOMAIN responses in both the Umbrella (11.5%) and the Majestic
(2.7%) top lists higher than in the general population of com/net/org
domains (0.8%). This is in alignment with the fact that already ≈23k
domains in the Umbrella list belong to non-existent top-level do-
mains (cf., §5.1). Figure 6a shows that the NXDOMAIN share is,
except for Umbrella, stable over time. We found almost no NX-
DOMAINs among Top 1k ranked domains. One notable exception
is teredo.ipv6.microsoft.com, a service discontinued in 2013
12com/net/org is still only a 45% sample of the general population (156.7M of 332M
domains as per [121]), but more complete and still unbiased samples are difficult to
obtain due to ccTLDs’ restrictive zone file access policies. [21, 122–125]

quency, and weekday (Friday left, Sunday right). Empty fields indi-

through automated forward-confirmed reverse-DNS at scanned
hosts, and not from humans entering the URL into their browser.
Building a top list based on DNS queries has various trade-offs and
parameters, which we aim to explore here. One specifically is the
TTL value of a DNS domain name. As the DNS highly relies on
caching, TTL values could introduce a bias in determining pop-
ularity based on DNS query volume: domain names with higher
Time-To-Live values can be cached longer and may cause fewer
DNS queries at upstream resolvers. To better understand Umbrella’s
ranking mechanism and query volume required, we set up 7 RIPE
Atlas measurements [115], which query the OpenDNS resolvers for
DNS names under our control.
Probe Count versus Query Volume: We set up measurements
with 100, 1k, 5k, and 10k RIPE Atlas probes, and at frequencies of 1,
