### Describe the problem
Currently `tf.estimator.train_and_evaluate` makes it easy to use an
`Estimator` to perform both training and evaluation, possibly in a distributed
environment. However, this function only supports a single evaluation dataset.
This makes the function suboptimal because we oftentimes want to evaluate on
both the training and the validation set in order to get a sense for the
amount of overfitting that is happening. It would be ideal if we could perhaps
pass a list of `EvalSpec` objects to `train_and_evaluate`.
