**Key Quotes:**

- "If you're listening to a rock star in order to get your information on who to vote for, you're a bigger moron than they are."
- "Life is too short to have anything but delusional notions about yourself."
- "I feel uncomfortable because I'm insecure about who I am."
- "Nothing is as important as passion. No matter what you want to do with your life, be passionate."
