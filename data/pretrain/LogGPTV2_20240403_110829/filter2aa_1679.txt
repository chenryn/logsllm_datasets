“I care less if I can't be part of your scene because I am 
the scene. I am everything that is.” 
“If you're listening to a rock star in order to get your information on who to 
vote for, you're a bigger moron than they are.” 
“Life is too short to have anything but delusional notions about yourself.” 
“I feel uncomfortable because I'm insecure about who I am.” 
“Nothing is as important as passion. No matter what 
you want to do with your life, be passionate.” 
“If you know something, share it. If you learn something, 
learn more. When you really know your stuff, teach it.” 
Adam Laurie (Major Malfunction)
