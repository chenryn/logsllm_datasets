**ATT&CK ID:** T1048.002  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Exfiltration Over Asymmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol

**Description:**
Adversaries may exfiltrate sensitive data using an asymmetrically encrypted network protocol that is distinct from the established command and control (C2) channel. This technique allows them to transmit the stolen information to a different network location, separate from the primary C2 server. By employing this method, adversaries can bypass security measures and reduce the likelihood of detection.
