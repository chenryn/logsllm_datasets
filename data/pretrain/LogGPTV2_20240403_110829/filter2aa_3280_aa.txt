Worrying and Exploit Secure Boot

GTVHacker: The Team 
• 
GTVHacker is a group of 6 hackers with 
individual skill sets who work together to 
unlock Google TV devices. 
• 
Our primary goal is to bypass hardware 
and software restrictions to allow for 
unsigned kernels to be loaded and used.  
• 
To date the team has released multiple 
methods for unlocking Google TV 
devices. 
• 
The GTVHacker team won a $500 bounty 
for being the first to root the Google TV. 
• 
We hack things because we believe in 
open and free hardware. Our current 
target just happens to be the Google TV.

What's the Google TV?	
• 
Google TV is a platform that: 
o 
Bridges the gap between your TV and an Android 
device. 
o 
Creates an overlay on television stream and also 
contains an IR transmitter to transmit to media 
center devices (cable box, TV, sound system). 
o 
Receives over-the-air updates automatically from 
OEM manufacturers. 
o 
Contains a forked version of Chrome with all plugins 
and extensions disabled. 
o 
Was originally released without the Android Market 
available but was eventually updated to include it. 
o 
Provides a built-in Flash Player, however most 
content providers block the Google TV.

Why We Hack It 
Just a few reasons why we targeted 
the platform: 
•  Locked bootloader 
•  Heavily restricted kernel preventing 
user modifications 
•  Generation 1 EOL 
•  Crippled Flash Player 
In short, the Google TV devices are 
locked down and crippled by their 
limitations. Our goal is to change that.

Along the way: Chrome Flash Player 
Modification 
Hulu and other sites check the Flash Player version string on the 
box, preventing access.

This simple change teamed with modifying the browser user-agent 
results in a Content Block Bypass on all blocked sites.
