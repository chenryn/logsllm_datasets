CFM Limitations on QFX5120, QFX5200, and QFX5210 Series Switches
Starting in Junos OS Release 18.4R1, Junos OS provides CFM support on QFX5200 switches and
QFX5210 switches. Starting in Junos OS Release 19.4R1, Junos OS provides CFM support on QFX5120
switches. CFM support on QFX5120, QFX5200, and QFX5210 Series switches has the following
limitations:
• CFM support is provided via software using filters. This can impact scaling.
• Inline Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) mode is not supported. In Inline PFE mode, you can delegate
periodic packet management (PPM) processing to the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) which results
in faster packet handling and the CCM interval supported is 10 milliseconds.
• Performance monitoring (ITU-T Y.1731 Ethernet Service OAM) is not supported.
• CCM interval of less than 1 second is not supported.
• CFM is not supported on Routed Interfaces and aggregated Ethernet (lag) interfaces.
• MIP half function, to divide the MIP functionality into two unidirectional segments to improve
network coverage, is not supported.
• Up MEP is not supported.

Ethernet interfaces on Juniper Networks EX Series Ethernet Switches and Juniper Networks Junos OS
for EX Series switches support the IEEE 802.1ag standard for Operation, Administration, and
Management (OAM). The IEEE 802.1ag specification provides for Ethernet connectivity fault
management (CFM).
NOTE: This feature is not supported on EX4300 switches on aggregated Ethernet (LAG)
interfaces.
This topic describes these tasks:
183
Creating the Maintenance Domain
A maintenance domain comprises network entities such as operators, providers, and customers. To
enable connectivity fault management (CFM) on an Ethernet interface, you must create a maintenance
domains, maintenance associations, and MEPs.
To create a maintenance domain:
1. Specify a name for the maintenance domain:
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management]
user@switch# set maintenance-domain domain-name
2. Specify a format for the maintenance domain name. If you specify none, no name is configured:
• A plain ASCII character string
• A domain name service (DNS) format
• A media access control (MAC) address plus a two-octet identifier in the range 0 through 65,535
• none
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management maintenance-domain domain-name]
user@switch# set name-format format
For example, to specify the name format as MAC address plus a two-octet identifier:
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management maintenance-domain domain-name]
user@switch# set name-format mac+2oct
3. Configure the maintenance domain level, which is used to indicate the nesting relationship between
this domain and other domains. Use a value from 0 through 7:
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management maintenance-domain domain-name]
user@switch# set level level
NOTE: The configuration display entries in the CFM maintenance domain list are "ordered by
system" rather than "ordered by user."
184
Configuring the Maintenance Domain MIP Half Function
NOTE: MIP Half Function (MHF) is not supported on EX4600, QFX5200, and QFX5210
switches.
MIP Half Function (MHF) divides the maintenance association intermediate point (MIP) functionality
into two unidirectional segments, improves visibility with minimal configuration, and improves network
coverage by increasing the number of points that can be monitored. MHF extends monitoring capability
by responding to loop-back and link-trace messages to help isolate faults. Whenever a MIP is
configured, the MIP half function value for all maintenance domains and maintenance associations must
be the same.
To configure the MIP half function:
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management maintenance-domain domain-name]
user@switch# set mip-half-function (none | default | explicit)
Creating a Maintenance Association
In a CFM maintenance domain, each service instance is called a maintenance association.
To create a maintenance association:
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management maintenance-domain domain-name]
user@switch# set maintenance-association ma-name
NOTE: The configuration display entries in the CFM maintenance domain list are "ordered by
system" rather than "ordered by user."
Configuring the Continuity Check Protocol
The continuity check protocol is used for fault detection by a maintenance association end point (MEP)
within a maintenance association. The MEP periodically sends continuity check multicast messages. The
receiving MEPs use the continuity check messages (CCMs) to build a MEP database of all MEPs in the
maintenance association.
To configure the continuity check protocol:
185
1. Enable the continuity check protocol:
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management maintenance-domain domain-name
maintenance-association ma-name]
user@switch# set continuity-check
2. Specify the continuity check hold interval. The hold interval is the number of minutes to wait before
flushing the MEP database if no updates occur. The default value is 10 minutes.
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management maintenance-domain domain-name
maintenance-association ma-name continuity-check]
user@switch# set hold-interval number
3. Specify the CCM interval. The interval is the time between the transmission of CCMs. You can
specify 10 minutes (10m), 1 minute (1m), 10 seconds (10s), 1 second (1s), 100 milliseconds (100ms),
or 10 milliseconds (10ms).
NOTE: On EX4600, QFX5200, and QFX5210 switches, CCM interval of less than 1 second is
not supported.
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management maintenance-domain domain-name
maintenance-association ma-name continuity-check]
user@switch# set interval number
4. Specify the number of CCMs (that is, protocol data units) that can be lost before the MEP is marked
as down. The default number of protocol data units (PDUs) is 3.
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management maintenance-domain domain-name
maintenance-association ma-name continuity-check]
user@switch# set loss-threshold number
Configuring a Maintenance Association End Point
To configure a maintenance association end point:
186
1. Specify an ID for the MEP. The value can be from 1 through 8191.
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management maintenance-domain domain-name
maintenance-association ma-name]
user@switch# set mep mep-id]
2. Enable maintenance endpoint automatic discovery if you want to have the MEP accept continuity
check messages (CCMs) from all remote MEPs of the same maintenance association:
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management maintenance-domain domain-name
maintenance-association ma-name mep mep-id
user@switch# set auto-discovery
3. You can specify that CFM packets (CCMs) be transmitted only in one direction for the MEP, that is,
the direction be set as down so that CCMs are transmitted only out of (not into) the interface
configured on this MEP.
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management maintenance-domain domain-name
maintenance-association ma-name mep mep-id]
user@switch# set direction down
4. Specify the logical interface to which the MEP is attached. It can be either an access interface or a
trunk interface. If you specify a trunk interface, the VLAN associated with that interface must have a
VLAN ID.
NOTE: You cannot associate an access interface that belongs to multiple VLANs with the
MEP.
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management maintenance-domain domain-name
maintenance-association ma-name mep mep-id]
user@switch# set interface interface-name
187
5. You can configure a remote MEP from which CCMs are expected. If autodiscovery is not enabled, the
remote MEP must be configured under the mep statement. If the remote MEP is not configured under
the mep statement, the CCMs from the remote MEP are treated as errors.
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management maintenance-domain domain-name
maintenance-association ma-name mep mep-id]
user@switch# set remote-mep mep-id
Configuring a Connectivity Fault Management Action Profile
You can configure an action profile and specify the action to be taken when any of the configured events
occur. Alternatively, you can configure an action profile and specify default actions when connectivity to
a remote MEP fails.
To configure an action profile:
1. Specify a name for an action profile:
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management]
user@switch# set action-profile profile-name
2. Configure the action of the action profile:
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management action-profile profile-name]
user@switch# set action interface-down
3. Configure one or more events under the action profile, the occurrence of which will trigger the
corresponding action to be taken:
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management action-profile profile-name]
user@switch# set event event
See Junos OS Network Interfaces Configuration Guide
Configuring the Linktrace Protocol
The linktrace protocol is used for path discovery between a pair of maintenance points. Linktrace
messages are triggered by an administrator using the traceroute command to verify the path between a
pair of MEPs under the same maintenance association. Linktrace messages can also be used to verify
the path between a MEP and a MIP under the same maintenance domain.
To configure the linktrace protocol:
188
1. Configure the linktrace path age timer. If no response to a linktrace request is received, the request
and response entries are deleted after the age timer expires:
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management]
user@switch# set linktrace age time
2. Configure the number of linktrace reply entries to be stored per linktrace request:
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management]
user@switch# set linktrace path-database-size path-database-size
