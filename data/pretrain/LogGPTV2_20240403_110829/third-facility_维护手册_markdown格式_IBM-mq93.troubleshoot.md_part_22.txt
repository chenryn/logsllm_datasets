### Configuring and Troubleshooting the SYSTEM.FTE Queue

To ensure proper operation of the `SYSTEM.FTE` queue, follow these steps:

1. **Subscribe Engine Configuration**:
   - Add an entry for the new `SYSTEM.FTE` queue in the subscribe engine.
   - For detailed instructions, including the necessary MQSC commands, refer to the `fteSetupCoordination` documentation, which covers setting up properties files and directories for the coordination queue manager.

2. **Verification of Namelist**:
   - Ensure that the `SYSTEM.QPUBSUB.QUEUE.NAMELIST` namelist is correctly configured and includes an entry for the `SYSTEM.FTE` queue.
   - If the entry is missing, the queued publish/subscribe engine will not detect incoming status messages from the agent and will not process them.

3. **Enable Queued Publish/Subscribe Engine**:
   - Set the `PSMODE` attribute on the queue manager to `ENABLED` to activate the queued publish/subscribe engine.

4. **Channel and Message Flow Verification**:
   - If the channels are running and status messages are flowing through the IBM MQ network, verify that the `SYSTEM.FTE` queue is being processed by the queue manager's queued publish/subscribe engine.

5. **Collecting Traces**:
   - If the above conditions are met, collect the following traces:
     - **IBM MQ MFT Trace from the Agent**:
       - Collect a trace covering a time period equal to three times the value of the `agentStatusPublishRateMin` property. This ensures the trace captures at least three status messages.
       - Use the trace specification:
         ```
         com.ibm.wmqfte.statestore.impl.FTEAgentStatusPublisher,
         com.ibm.wmqfte.utils.AgentStatusDetails,
         com.ibm.wmqfte.wmqiface.AgentPublicationUtils,
         com.ibm.wmqfte.wmqiface.RFHMessageFactory=all
         ```
       - Note: This trace specification outputs a reduced amount of data.
       - For agents on IBM MQ for Multiplatforms, see "Collecting a Managed File Transfer agent trace dynamically" on page 445.
       - For agents on IBM MQ for z/OS, see "Collecting a Managed File Transfer for z/OS agent trace dynamically" on page 453.
     - **Concurrent Trace of Queue Managers**:
       - Collect a trace of the queue managers used to route status messages from the agent queue manager to the coordination queue manager.
     - **Trace of `fteListAgents` Command**:
       - Collect a trace covering the time when the agent is shown as being in an `UNKNOWN` state.
       - Use the trace specification:
         ```
         com.ibm.wmqfte=all
         ```
       - For commands on IBM MQ for Multiplatforms, see "Tracing Managed File Transfer commands on Multiplatforms" on page 446.
       - For commands on IBM MQ for z/OS, see "Tracing Managed File Transfer for z/OS commands" on page 456.

6. **Submit Traces to IBM Support**:
   - Once the traces are collected, provide them to IBM Support for analysis. For more information, see "Collecting troubleshooting information for IBM Support" on page 302.

### Viewing Status Age

- **Command Line**:
  - From IBM MQ 9.1.0, the `Status Age` information of a publication is displayed in the output of the `fteListAgents` and `fteShowAgentDetails` commands.
  - For more information, see the documentation for `fteListAgents` and `fteShowAgentDetails`.

- **IBM MQ Explorer**:
  - From IBM MQ 9.1.0, the `Status Age` information is available in the IBM MQ Explorer MFT plug-in when viewing the list of agents and their individual properties.

### Handling `ftePingAgent` Timeouts

#### What to Do if `ftePingAgent` Times Out and Reports a BFGCL0214I Message

- **Understanding `ftePingAgent`**:
  - `ftePingAgent` is a command-line utility provided with IBM MQ Managed File Transfer to check if an agent is reachable and can respond to requests.

- **How the Command Works**:
  - Connects to the command queue manager for the MFT topology.
  - Creates a temporary reply queue on the command queue manager (default prefix: `WMQFTE`, configurable via `dynamicQueuePrefix` in `MFT command.properties`).
  - Sends a ping request to the `SYSTEM.FTE.COMMAND.agent_name` queue on the agent queue manager.
  - Waits for a reply message on the temporary queue.

- **Timeout Handling**:
  - By default, `ftePingAgent` waits for 5 seconds for a reply. If no reply is received, it writes a `BFGCL0214I` message to the console.
  - To investigate, follow these steps:
    1. **Check Agent Status**:
       - Ensure the agent is running.
    2 - **Increase Wait Interval**:
       - Rerun `ftePingAgent` with a longer wait interval using the `-w` parameter. For example:
         ```
         ftePingAgent -w 60 AGENT1
         ```
    3. **Check Network Path**:
       - Verify the path between the command and agent queue managers. Restart any failed channels and rerun `ftePingAgent`.
    4. **Enable Traces**:
       - Enable traces on both the command and agent queue managers.
       - Enable dynamic tracing on the agent using the specification `com.ibm.wmqfte=all`.
       - Run `ftePingAgent` with tracing enabled.
       - For detailed instructions, see the relevant sections in the IBM MQ documentation.

- **Submit Traces to IBM Support**:
  - After the command times out, stop the traces and provide them to IBM Support for analysis.

### Troubleshooting Managed Transfers

#### Common Problems and Solutions

- **Transfer Not Completing**:
  - Check the agent logs for errors.
  - Verify connectivity between the agent queue manager and the coordination queue manager.
  - Use `ftePingAgent` to test connectivity between source and destination agents.
  - Check for issues with the transfer request reaching the agent command queue.
  - Use `fteShowAgentDetails` to monitor the current transfer activity.

- **File Transfer Stuck**:
  - Use `ftePingAgent` or IBM MQ Explorer to check if the source and destination agents are active.
  - Check if the destination agent is running at capacity.
  - Look for protocol connection issues in the agent logs.
  - Consider the priority of transfers and the system load.

- **Clustered Queue Issues**:
  - When transferring to a clustered queue, set the `enableClusterQueueInputOutput` property to `true` to resolve reason codes 2085 or 2082.
  - Define a remote queue definition to point to the clustered queue.

- **Scheduled Transfers**:
  - Configure the `maxSchedulerRunDelay` property to ensure scheduled transfers are checked even when the agent is busy.
  - Alternatively, use resource monitors for more efficient file transfers.

- **IBM i Save Files**:
  - Avoid concurrent transfers of the same save file by using different source agents or waiting for previous transfers to complete.

- **BFGIO0341E Errors**:
  - Understand how the destination agent uses temporary files.
  - Ensure that external processes do not interfere with the temporary files created during the transfer.
