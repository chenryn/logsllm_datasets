Question: "You are analyzing the security of a web application that uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for session management. The JWTs are signed using the HS256 algorithm with a strong, unique HMAC key. Which of the following statements are valid concerns regarding this JWT implementation?"
 "A": "Using HS256 with a strong, unique HMAC key is generally secure, but one must ensure that the key remains confidential to prevent forging of tokens."
 "B": "HS256 is inherently insecure regardless of the HMAC key strength due to its susceptibility to quantum computing attacks."
 "C": "The application should avoid using JWTs altogether as they are always a source of vulnerabilities, regardless of the signing algorithm used."
 "D": "The HS256 algorithm is secure if implemented correctly, yet there is a risk of sensitive information exposure if the payload is not handled properly."
Answer: AD
