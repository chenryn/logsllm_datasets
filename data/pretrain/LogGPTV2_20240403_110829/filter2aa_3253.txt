intended
Total Endpoint Protection: #1 in EDR & Next-Gen AV
Common LM Methods

DCOM and WinRM)
Total Endpoint Protection: #1 in EDR & Next-Gen AV
A Bit About WMI
Mainly variations of
“SELECT * FROM Win32_Process”
Total Endpoint Protection: #1 in EDR & Next-Gen AV
Some Example Classes

WMI, WHAT IS IT MADE OF?
Total Endpoint Protection: #1 in EDR & Next-Gen AV
WMI, What is it made of?
o Winmgmt service
o Providers
o Repository
Total Endpoint Protection: #1 in EDR & Next-Gen AV
The WINMGMT Service
o A mediator between the WMI 
model and client applications 
Total Endpoint Protection: #1 in EDR & Next-Gen AV
WMI Providers
o Contain the implementations of 
WMI classes, instances and 
methods
o Most commonly implemented as 
COM DLLs
Total Endpoint Protection: #1 in EDR & Next-Gen AV
The WMI repository
o The central storage area for 
the WMI model
o Contains definitions and 
instances
Total Endpoint Protection: #1 in EDR & Next-Gen AV
The Win32_Process Class
o Represents a single process on 
a machine.
o Class has a handy “Create” 
method
Total Endpoint Protection: #1 in EDR & Next-Gen AV
The Win32_Process Class
Total Endpoint Protection: #1 in EDR & Next-Gen AV
IS THIS ALL?
Total Endpoint Protection: #1 in EDR & Next-Gen AV
WMI Class Derivation
Total Endpoint Protection: #1 in EDR & Next-Gen AV
Class Derivation – In Practice
o Create a subclass of Win32_Process, 
Win32_NotEvilAtAll, which can be done 
remotely via WMI
o New class has all the methods of the parent
o Call “Create”
o Win?

Some Takeaways
Deriving classes without methods 
works better: no provider method 
calls
Total Endpoint Protection: #1 in EDR & Next-Gen AV
Some Takeaways
o ‘SELECT * FROM 
__InstanceCreationEvent WITHIN 5 
Where TargetInstance ISA 
“SOMECLASS“’
o This also looks at subclasses
Total Endpoint Protection: #1 in EDR & Next-Gen AV
Some Takeaways
o Cloning a class as a stealthier 
alternative for derivation 
doesn’t work
Total Endpoint Protection: #1 in EDR & Next-Gen AV
WMIIFIYING OLD TECHNIQUES
Total Endpoint Protection: #1 in EDR & Next-Gen AV
Why Even Do this?
o Uses WMI protocols instead of 
native ones
o Network forensics will look for 
these in other places
Total Endpoint Protection: #1 in EDR & Next-Gen AV
WMIifying Service Creation
o Win32_Service represents a 
single service on a machine
o Provides the full capability of 
sc.exe

WMIifying Old-Style Scheduled 
Tasks
o Win32_ScheduledJob represents 
tasks created by at.exe
o Does not provide the full API 
of old-style scheduled tasks
Total Endpoint Protection: #1 in EDR & Next-Gen AV
WMIifying Old-Style Scheduled

WIN32_PRODUCT
Total Endpoint Protection: #1 in EDR & Next-Gen AV
The Win32_Product Class
o The Win32_Product class manages 
applications installed on the 
machine (via msiexec etc.)
o “Install” method allows to 
install arbitrary MSI files!
Total Endpoint Protection: #1 in EDR & Next-Gen AV

arbitrary payloads into MSI

Less Successful Adventures With 
Win32_Product
o No way to replicate
“msiexec /y”
o Hijacking uninstallers does not 
work

EVIL WMI PROVIDERS
Total Endpoint Protection: #1 in EDR & Next-Gen AV
Evil WMI Providers
o WMI providers are where class 
instances and methods are 
implemented
o Having your own provider means 
running code on the machine
Total Endpoint Protection: #1 in EDR & Next-Gen AV
Evil WMI Providers
o Alexander Leary of NETSPI has 
shown a method to register a 
provider purely using WMI 
functions during the last 
DerbyCon
Total Endpoint Protection: #1 in EDR & Next-Gen AV
Evil WMI Providers – Drawbacks
o Need to drop a file on the 
machine
o Actually writing a WMI dll
sucks
Total Endpoint Protection: #1 in EDR & Next-Gen AV
Evil WMI Providers
o We want to have our provider 
just be an arbitrary command 
line
Total Endpoint Protection: #1 in EDR & Next-Gen AV
What Needs To Be Done
o Create a COM object
o Register a new provider
o Somehow load the provider
Total Endpoint Protection: #1 in EDR & Next-Gen AV
Creating a COM Object
o Create an OOP COM object 
inserting a new entry in the 
registry
Total Endpoint Protection: #1 in EDR & Next-Gen AV
Registering Providers
Total Endpoint Protection: #1 in EDR & Next-Gen AV
Registering Providers
o Creating an instance of 
__Win32Provider is enough
o CLSID and HostingModel fields 
allow to choose any type of COM 
object to be registered
Total Endpoint Protection: #1 in EDR & Next-Gen AV
Loading The Malicious Provider
o Normally, a provider is loaded 
on demand
o Our arbitrary executable does 
not implement classes, and 
cannot be loaded this way 
Total Endpoint Protection: #1 in EDR & Next-Gen AV
Loading The Malicious Provider
o The MSFT_Providers class has a 
method called "Load", which 
loads any WMI provider 
regardless of demand
Total Endpoint Protection: #1 in EDR & Next-Gen AV
The Msft_Providers Class
Total Endpoint Protection: #1 in EDR & Next-Gen AV
The Msft_Providers Class
o The “Load” method checks if the 
__Win32Provider is registered 
correctly, and calls
“CServerObject_RawFactory::CreateInstance”
Total Endpoint Protection: #1 in EDR & Next-Gen AV
CServerObject_RawFactory::Create
Instance
Total Endpoint Protection: #1 in EDR & Next-Gen AV
CServerObject_RawFactory::Create
Instance
o Checks the LocalServer32 key under the 
relevant CLSID
o Runs the command line
o Tries to query the relevant interfaces
o Fails
o Everything is fine because we don't 
really care about the COM stuff at all
Total Endpoint Protection: #1 in EDR & Next-Gen AV
A Bit About Stealth
o The “SelfHost” hosting model 
runs as SYSTEM, but leaves a 
nasty entry in the event log
o NetworkServiceHostOrSelfHost
defaults to SelfHost without a 
log write

BONUS: MESSING WITH BOOT 
CONFIGURATION

Messing With Boot Configuration
Total Endpoint Protection: #1 in EDR & Next-Gen AV
Messing With Boot Configuration
o The BCDObject class allows to 
manipulate entries in the BCD 
store, such as winload.exe
o This allows an attacker to 
remotely manipulate the Windows 
loading process
Total Endpoint Protection: #1 in EDR & Next-Gen AV
How To Mess With Boot Config Via
WMI
o Open the system BCD using an instance of the 
BCDStore class
o Open the BCDObject related to winload.exe
o Switch winload.exe with calc.exe, as you 
haven’t really written a compatible bootkit
o Wait for the machine to restart
o Ponder your life choices as the victim 
machine is stuck in a very understandable 
boot loop

DETECTION
Total Endpoint Protection: #1 in EDR & Next-Gen AV
A Bit About Detection
o The WMI-Activity ETW provider 
is a great source of 
information
Total Endpoint Protection: #1 in EDR & Next-Gen AV
A Bit About Detection
o Another great method is WMI 
introspection, using WMI 
queries to audit WMI
'SELECT * FROM __InstanceCreationEvent
WITHIN 5 Where TargetInstance ISA 
"__Win32Provider"'
Total Endpoint Protection: #1 in EDR & Next-Gen AV
A Bit About Detection
o Some software (and hardware) 
vendors add classes and 
providers to WMI, expanding the 
attack surface
o Knowing what WMI providers and 
classes exist on your machines 
will only do you good
