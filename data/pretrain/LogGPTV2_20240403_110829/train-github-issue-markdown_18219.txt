# Bug report
**What is the current behavior?**  
Assume we have two projects with only index.js files in them, which are having
same content:

and this webpack config:
    module.exports = {
      mode: 'production',
      cache: {
        type: 'filesystem'
      },
      infrastructureLogging: {
        level: 'info',
        debug: /webpack\.cache.*/,
      },
      entry: `./${process.env.SRC_DIR}/index.js`,
      plugins: [
        new MiniCssExtractPlugin({ filename:'styles.[chunkhash].css' })
      ],
      output: {
        pathinfo: false,
      },
      module: {
        rules: [{
          test: /\.(js|jsx)$/,
          loader: 'babel-loader',
          options: {
            "plugins": [
              "syntax-dynamic-import",
              "@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties"
            ],
            "presets": [
                [
                    "@babel/preset-env",
                    {
                        "modules": false
                    }
                ],
                "@babel/preset-react"
            ]
          }
        }]
      },
      optimization: {
        minimizer: [new TerserPlugin({
        })],
      }
    }
After cache warmup with `webpack5-1` repo we build first `webpack5-1` and then
- `webpack5-2`
warmup time:
    webpack 5 - 1 (warmup) : 5.05401289999485 seconds
Full compilation time with cache is then following:
    webpack 5 - 1: 0.8312232999801635 seconds
    webpack 5 - 2: 1.4813145999908448 seconds
After that, if we not delete `.cache` folder and again build `webpack5-1` and
then - `webpack5-2` then builds aree took almost the same time
    webpack 5 - 1: 0.8569822000265122 seconds
    webpack 5 - 2: 0.9038357999920845 seconds
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**  
Reproducing steps in readme section of repo
https://github.com/SkReD/webpack5-performance-issue/tree/cache-share-problem
**What is the expected behavior?**  
Expect compilation time to be almost the same for both `webpack5-1` and
`webpack5-2` with cache from the first one.
