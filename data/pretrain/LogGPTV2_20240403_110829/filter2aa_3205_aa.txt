# UPnProxyPot: Blackhat Proxies via NAT Injections

## Overview
UPnProxyPot is a tool designed to mimic the behavior of a blackhat proxy, enabling Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks on TLS connections and facilitating data scraping. This document provides an in-depth look at SSDP and UPnP, their vulnerabilities, and the development and findings of UPnProxyPot.

## Introduction
### What is IoT?
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the network of physical devices, vehicles, home appliances, and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and connectivity which enables these objects to connect and exchange data. 

## Vulnerabilities in SSDP and UPnP
### What are SSDP and UPnP?
- **SSDP (Simple Service Discovery Protocol)**
  - **Purpose**: Built for Local Area Networks (LANs), it uses broadcast addressing with HTTP over UDP to allow machines to announce themselves and discover peers that expose services like printing, media sharing, and network configuration.
  - **Issues**:
    - Incorrect deployment by many IoT devices.
    - Exposed on WAN, leading to DDoS vulnerabilities.
    - Still a popular DDoS vector despite known issues.

- **UPnP (Universal Plug & Play)**
  - **Purpose**: Also built for LANs, it uses HTTP and SOAP to allow machines to inquire about and modify services and configurations.
  - **Issues**:
    - Deployed on WAN, making it accessible from the internet.
    - Lack of authentication, leading to information disclosure and configuration changes.
    - Vulnerable to SOAP RCE (Remote Code Execution) injections.

### Historical Context
- **2003**: Björn Stickler - Netgear UPnP information disclosure.
- **2006**: Armijn Hemel - SANE conference (upnp-hacks.org).
- **2011**: Daniel Garcia - Defcon 19 - UPnP Mapping.
- **2014**: SSDP as a DDoS vector.
- **2015**: SSDP research leads to UPnP research.
- **2016**: “UPnP - a decade after disclosure” (unpublished).

### Relevant PoC
- **A Decade After Disclosure**

## Discovery of UPnProxy
### Accidental Discovery
- **September 2016**: A 620Gbps sustained DDoS attack.
- **Investigation**: Found significant overlap with existing UPnP datasets.
- **Findings**:
  - UPnP info leaks helped in fingerprinting botnets.
  - Correlation with Mirai botnet.
  - Odd entries in UPnP tables pointing to DNS servers, Akamai CDN, and HTTP(S) web servers.

### UPnProxy Uncovered
- **4.8 million SSDP responders**
- **765k with exposed UPnP (16%)**
- **65k actively injected (9% of vulnerable, 1.3% of total)**
- **17,599 unique endpoint IPs injected**
- **Most injected destination**: 18.8 million instances across 23,236 devices.
- **Second most injected destination**: 11 million instances across 59,943 devices.
- **15.9 million injections to DNS servers (TCP/53)**
- **9.5 million injections to Web servers (TCP/80)**
- **155,000 injections to HTTPS servers (TCP/443)**

### Impact on APTs
- **UPnProxy and APTs**: Attackers use multiple layers of proxies to obfuscate their activities.

### Affected Devices
- **73 brands, over 400 models** identified, including:
  - Accton, AboCom, Atlantis, ASUS, D-Link, Edimax, Gigalink, Grandstream, HP, Intelbras, Lenovo, MSI, NETGEAR, OpenWRT, Planex, Sitecom, Tenda, ZTE, ZyXel, and many others.

## UPnProxy: EternalSilence
### Discovery
- **2018**: During a live demo, routes were found being injected into the LAN address space.
- **"galleta silenciosa"**: Spanish for "Silent Cookie," targeting Samba/SMB.

### By the Numbers
- **3.5 million SSDP responders**
- **227,000 UPnP exposed**
- **45,000 with active EternalSilence injections**

### Challenges
- **Passive Identification**: Requires regular scanning of the entire internet.
- **Time-consuming and risky**: Generates large amounts of logs and potential threats.
- **Data Ephemeral**: Entries can be deleted or self-destruct on a timeline controlled by operators.

## UPnProxyPot
### Solution
- **Listen for SSDP probes** and direct attackers to a fake UPnP service.
- **Mitigate attacks** and gather intelligence on attacker activities.

By understanding and addressing these vulnerabilities, we can better protect our networks and devices from malicious activities.
