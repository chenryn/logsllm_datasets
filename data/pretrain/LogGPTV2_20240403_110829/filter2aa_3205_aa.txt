UPnProxyPot:
fake the funk, become a blackhat proxy, 
MITM their TLS, and scrape the wire.

Your abstract sucked, what is this about?
SSDP & UPnP have been widely vulnerable on IoT devices for nearly 20 years...
It is not only possible, but also very easy to turn these devices into proxy servers... 
When attackers find vulnerable IoT devices susceptible to this kind of attack, they turn the 
device into a short lived proxy server and delete their tracks when they’re done and/or the 
rules self destruct after their TTL expires...
We’ll cover SSDP & UPnP, previous UPnProxy research/campaigns, and finally 
UPnProxyPot, how it works, and findings from a year of geographically distributed 
deployments...
TL;DW

What are those things?
SSDP & UPnP
SSDP: Simple Service Discovery Protocol
-
Built for the LAN, uses broadcast addressing with HTTP over UDP
-
machines on a LAN announce themselves and find network peers that expose 
services (printing, media sharing, network conf.)
UPnP: Universal Plug & Play
-
Built for the LAN, good ole HTTP & SOAP ()
-
let’s machines on a LAN inquire about services and/or configurations
-
let’s machines on a LAN access services and/or modify configurations

Okay, that doesn’t sound so bad, what’s wrong with them?
SSDP & UPnP
SSDP: Simple Service Discovery Protocol
-
IoT devices are notoriously bad at deploying this correctly
-
built for the LAN… better expose it on the WAN just for funsies
-
DRDoS MVP of 2014/15… still has a seat at the popular DDoS vectors lunch table
-
Still finding this bullshit with these same old problems on some “newer” devices… (ymmv)
UPnP: Universal Plug & Play
-
Built for the LAN… but it’s deployed on WAN too, of course
-
LAN is a “safe space”, so we just do what our “trusted” network peers tell us to do… no auth needed
-
Information disclosure, ask away, I don’t keep secrets
-
Configuration changes, whatever you want boss… I’m easy peasy, baby
-
SOAP RCE injections… because sanitizing input is for try hards

A brief, incomplete, but mostly relevant history
UPnP disclosure history
2003: Björn Stickler - Netgear UPnP information disclosure
2006: Armijn Hemel - SANE conference (upnp-hacks.org, great info here)
2011: Daniel Garcia - Defcon 19 - UPnP Mapping (fun talk, I was in the crowd)

A brief, incomplete, but mostly relevant history
UPnProxy history
2014: SSDP is the new hotness DDoS vector, we (Akamai SIRT) write about it
2015: SSDP research leads to UPnP research

Relevant PoC
A Decade After Disclosure
13
On accident...
UPnProxy discovered
-
Sept 2016 - 620Gbps sustained DDoS attack
-
Inspection of sources, lots of IoT, decent overlap with existing identified UPnP dataset… 
-
UPnP Info leaks could maybe help, start scraping in attempts to fingerprint botnet
-
Correlation != Causation (Mirai)
-
I had already wrote a script to brute UPnP →
-
Weird entries in some of the UPnP tables…
-
Entries pointing at DNS servers…
-
Entries pointing at Akamai CDN servers…
-
Entries pointing at HTTP(S) web servers…
-
Interesting… but I’ve got other shit to do...

15
by the numbers
UPnProxy uncovered 
-
4.8 million SSDP responders
-
765k with exposed UPnP (16%)
-
65k actively injected (9% of vulnerable, 1.3% of total)
-
17,599 unique endpoint IPs injected
-
If a device had one injection, it typically had multiples
-
most injected dest = 18.8 million instances across 23,236 devices
-
2nd most injected dest = 11 million instances across 59,943 devices
-
15.9 million injections to DNS servers (TCP/53)
-
9.5 million injections to Web servers (TCP/80)
-
155,000 injections to HTTPS servers (TCP/443)

Pretty cool, but...
UPnProxy uncovered 
NO ONE CARES
19
Okay, so, maybe a couple people cared...
UPnProxy uncovered 
- Research gets some industry attention 
- Helps some ISPs support cleanup efforts
- Progress is made behind the scenes
- Some networks start filtering SSDP
- I get an email from a reporter a couple months after publication… 
20
Sometimes the demo gods are kind and merciful
UPnProxy: EternalSilence
-
Justine Underhill comes to talk about UPnProxy 
for a security episode of her online series
-
During the live demo
-
zmap finds 1000 random SSDP responders
-
I dump their UPnP NAT tables
-
I accidentally discover someone is injecting 
routes into the network (vindication!)
21
UPnProxy + EternalBlue + Silent Cookie = EternalSilence
UPnProxy: EternalSilence uncovered 
- Attackers are injecting routes 
into the LAN address space
- “galleta silenciosa” in 
NewPortMappingDescription
- Spanish, translates to “Silent 
Cookie”
- Injections target Samba/SMB

A brief, incomplete, but mostly relevant history
UPnProxy history
2014: SSDP is the new hotness DDoS vector, we (Akamai SIRT) write about it
2015: SSDP research leads to UPnP research
2016: “UPnP - a decade after disclosure” (never published)
2016: Mirai botnet + huge DDoS + Akamai 
2016: investigating attack sources, accidentally find UPnProxy… too busy cracking botnet
2017: Decide to circle back and see what those oddities were about… scan the internet...
2018: “UPnProxy” campaigns discovered, confirmed, & published
2018: “UPnProxy: EternalSilence” discovered & published
23
By the numbers
UPnProxy: EternalSilence 
- 3.5 Million SSDP responders
- 227,000 UPnP exposed
- 45,000 with active EternalSilence injections
- No way to really know what they were up to...
- EternalBlue link is an educated guess on the most likely scenario…
- It’s what I’d do if I were them...
24
We have problems.
That’s cool but... 
- Research up to this point has been via passive identification 
- This requires scanning the entire internet regularly to find stuff
- Time consuming, lots of hate mail and threats for scanning stuff...
- Hundreds of gigs of logs per scan that need parsing and made sense of
- Campaign operators can delete entries...
- Entries self destruct on a timeline controlled by the operators...
- You still can’t tell WHAT they’re doing, just WHERE they’re doing it...

[[ player 3 has entered the fight ]]
So, what do we need?
