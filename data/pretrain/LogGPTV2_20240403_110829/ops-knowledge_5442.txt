User: How to design a safe and reliable password storage solution, including the use of hash algorithms, SALT values, and salted hashes?
Assistant: Designing a safe and reliable password storage solution needs to consider the following aspects: 1. Selection of hash algorithm: choose a safe and reliable hash algorithm, such as SHA-256, SHA-3, etc., which can convert passwords under irreversible conditions is a string of fixed length. 2. Adding the SALT value: In order to avoid generating the same digest after the same password is hashed, a SALT value needs to be randomly generated and hashed based on the string composed of the password and the SALT value. 3. Salted hash: In order to further increase the difficulty of cracking, another randomly generated SALT value is added between the SALT value and the hash digest for hashing, which is salted hashing. 4. Prevent rainbow table attack: Rainbow table attack is an attack on the hash algorithm. The attacker uses the pre-calculated correspondence table between the hash value and the salt value to crack the password. In order to prevent rainbow table attacks, you can use the "enhanced SALT value" scheme, that is, use a longer SALT value and store the SALT value in a separate secure location. 5. Store the password: Store the final salted hash result and the SALT value in the database. When storing passwords, the security of the database should also be guaranteed, such as using encryption protocols to ensure the security of transmission, limiting the number of users accessing the database, and so on. To sum up, a safe and reliable password storage scheme should use a secure hash algorithm, add SALT value and salt hash, strengthen the SALT value to prevent rainbow table attacks, and ensure the security of the database.
