User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Force user to remove USB token I'm looking at setting up secure laptops using BitLocker with pre-boot PIN and startup key.

I'm wondering if there is a way to force the user, who is remote, to remove the USB with the startup key before they can log on or use Windows. Otherwise, what's to keep the user from just leaving the USB connected all the time, which would pretty much negate its value? 

One way, of course, is to make it impractical for the user to leave the USB connected, like permanently attaching it to a large object. But that's also generally impractical and not a great solution.

Is there a solution or standard approach for this that can actually force the removal of the device?

Assistant: You are trying to use a technical tool to solve a social problem. The answer is that cannot fit.

Techniques can provide great security when correctly used, but only user education can allow proper use. I often like the who is responsible for what question. That means that users should know that they will be accountable for anything that could be done with their credentials. It is not enough to prove that they did not do it, they shall prove that they correctly protected their credentials.

The physical analogy can also help. They would not let the key of a physical safe unattended. They should understand that when they are given reasonably secured credentials, they should see it as a physical key and use it the same. But as they are used to their own home computer with no security at all, education is hard and things are to be repeated. Unfortunately, I have never found a better way...
