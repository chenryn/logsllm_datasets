User: I hope this is trivial and I just didn't find it in the tutorials. I am writing python code that 'supervises' c code, aka I run the  c code with ctypes from python. Now I want to 'catch' the c 'printfs' to process the data that is output by the c code. Any idea how one would do this?
Thanks
Assistant: Well printf simply writes its output to whatever the stdout file pointer refers to. Im not sure how you're executing the C program, but it should be possible to redirect the C program's stdout to something that you can read in Python.
