Question: "In the context of a hardware design vulnerability involving fuse memory, where keys and configuration data are stored, analyze the scenario where the JTAG_OFFSET is incorrectly defined. Determine the potential consequences of this misconfiguration."
 "A": "Programs will access the correct keys, ensuring the peripherals' functionality and security."
 "B": "Programs cannot access the correct keys, potentially breaking peripheral functionality and exposing sensitive information."
 "C": "Incorrect offset will have no impact since keys are stored securely in the fuse memory."
 "D": "Incorrect offset will enhance system security by obfuscating the keys' actual location."
Answer: B
