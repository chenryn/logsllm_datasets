User: I'm under the impressions that Python runs in the Triforce smoothly. A program that runs in Windows will run in Linux. Is this sentiment correct?
Having said that, if I create my application in QT For Windows, will it run flawlessly in Linux/Mac as well?
Thanks.
Assistant: Yes. No. Maybe. See also: Java and "write once, run anywhere".
Filesystem layout, external utilities, anything you might do with things like dock icons, character encoding behaviors, these and more are areas you might run into some trouble.
Using Qt and Python, and strenuously avoiding anything that seems tied to Windows-specific libraries or behaviors whenever possible will make running the application on Mac and Linux much easier, but for any non-trivial application, the first time someone tries it, it will blow up in their face.
But through careful choice of frameworks and libraries, making the application work cross-platform will be much more like bug fixing than traditional "porting".
