### Ethical Considerations

The data collection methodology in this study focuses on certificate chains that link to hidden root CAs or are invalid, which account for only 0.54% of all web visits (Finding 4.1). Consequently, the majority of web visits associated with valid certificate chains signed by trusted root CAs are not collected and are only counted for statistical purposes. To protect the privacy of real users, we anonymize them by using the timestamp they joined the data collection process as client-IDs, thus avoiding the collection of any sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of volunteers.

When analyzing invalid websites and hosts signed by hidden roots, we focus on general statistics such as the overall scale and percentage of different certificate validation errors. We do not perform in-depth examinations of domain content or the access relationships between clients to minimize privacy concerns.

The collected certificate dataset is securely stored on servers managed by 360 Secure Browser. Access to the dataset is granted to researchers via a temporary internship, and all analysis programs are run on the company’s virtual environments. The dataset is not shared with third parties. Through these measures, we believe that our operations adhere to ethical conventions.

### Scale and Impact Analysis

This section provides an overview of the basic characteristics (scale, ownership, active patterns, and impact) of the hidden CA ecosystem.

#### 4.1 Scale of Hidden Root Certificates

**Finding 4.1:** Over a five-month period, more than 1.19 million hidden root certificates were detected, threatening the security of HTTPS connections and covering 0.54% of all web visits.

**Figure 5:** Size and impact of certificate groups

In the following sections, we focus on the top 100 certificate groups, each associated with over 1,000 web clients and 5,000 HTTPS visits. These top 100 groups account for 97.5% of all hidden root certificates imported by clients and 98.9% of their associated HTTPS visits.

**Dataset Overview:**
Table 1 provides an overview of our dataset. During February and June 2020, volunteer users of 360 Secure Browser generated over 41 billion web visits over HTTPS. The browser collected over 222 million certificate chains.

| **Type of Root Cert** | **Hidden CAs** | **Public Trusted CAs** |
|-----------------------|----------------|------------------------|
| **Filtering Condition** | PUBLIC_TRUSTED=FALSE, Trusted by at least one client | PUBLIC_TRUSTED=TRUE, STATUS_CODE has bits set |
| **# Distinct Root Certs** | 1,175,145 (98.24%) | 21,010 (1.76%) |
| **# Cert Chains** | 222,977,356 | 263,109 |
| **# Leaf Certs** | 59,817,585 | 112,946 |
| **# FQDNs** | 1,333,931 | 15,566 |

#### 4.2 Active Time

We define the active date of a hidden root certificate as the number of days when certificate chains linked to this root are captured by the browser. During the 5-month data collection period, 5,373 (0.4%) hidden root certificates were active for over 100 days. For the top 100 certificate groups, their average active time in the 5-month period was up to 146 days. This indicates that the vast majority of organizations behind the top groups had at least one active hidden root certificate every day that was trusted by web clients.

**Finding 4.2:** The ecosystem of hidden root CAs is dynamic and updating, with new emerging CAs and retiring ones observed.

To quantify the stability of top certificate groups, we calculate the coefficient of variation (CV, the ratio of standard deviation to the mean) of their daily count of associated HTTPS visits. A stable certificate group should have daily traffic volume that does not vary greatly. Empirically, certificate groups with a CV greater than 1 are considered unstable (for reference, the CV of all daily traffic associated with hidden root certificates is 0.33). We find 13 certificate groups that match this criterion, and Figure 6 shows some examples.

#### 4.3 Categories of Ownership

**Finding 4.3:** Three major sources of hidden CAs were identified through manual inspection: Self-built CAs (50 groups), Fake root CAs (11 groups), and Local software CAs (24 groups).

Due to a lack of ground truth, determining the category and purpose of each certificate group is non-trivial. We manually infer this information from the subjects of the top 100 root certificate groups. For example, subject O=Venus, OU=Venus VPN is used by Venustech VPN [42] and categorized as local software. If the subject is not directly identifiable, we search keywords and hash values of the certificate in search engines to infer its ownership. The manual classification is performed by three security researchers, and a certificate is classified only if over two researchers give the same label.

**Table 2:** Subject category of top 100 hidden certificate groups

| **Categories** | **# Clusters (Groups)** | **# Hidden Root Certs** | **# Affected Connections** | **# Affected Clients** | **Invalid (Authority)** | **Invalid (Other)** |
|----------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| **Enterprise Self-built** | 24 | 48 | 817,532 | 199,743 (3.94%) | 35.54% | 75.66% |
| **Digital Authentication** | 13 | 18 | 15,587 | 539,711 (10.65%) | 28.37% | 96.66% |
| **Government Self-built** | 13 | 16 | 90,131 | 62,032 (1.22%) | 30.46% | 89.67% |
| **Fake Authentications** | 11 | 81 | 7,187 | 73,725 (1.45%) | 0.00% | 0.25% |
| **Packet Filter** | 10 | 2 | 7,554 | 1,029,648 (20.31%) | 13.57% | 14.39% |
| **Proxy/VPN** | 2 | 1 | 207,957 | 192,901,548 (3.81%) | 2.26% | 4.27% |
| **Security Software** | 1 | 1 | 2,071,344 | 2,798,985 (55.21%) | 0.01% | 0.32% |
| **Parent Control** | 1 | 1 | 3,261,905 | 3,622,177 (7.16%) | 0.00% | 0.57% |
| **Unknown** | 15 | 15 | 314,351 | 3,050,138 (6.02%) | 2.89% | 4.73% |

**Finding 4.4:** Self-built CAs are still widely used by organizations such as government agencies and enterprises to issue website certificates. However, over 75% of certificate chains suffer from verification errors (e.g., weak signature algorithms).

**Self-built root CAs of organizations:** 50 of the top 100 certificate groups are held by self-built root CAs of enterprises, independent organizations (e.g., digital authentication centers), and government agencies. In total, they sign certificates for 3,311 fully-qualified domain names (FQDNs). However, more than 75% of certificate chains that link to self-built root CAs receive verification errors from web clients (i.e., are invalid). The most common error is WEAK_SIGNATURE_ALGORITHM (78.3% of all errors), suggesting prevalent adoption of weak security practices.

While it may be argued that self-built root CAs are for internal use only (e.g., in enterprise networks) and that domains signed by them are not publicly accessible, we conducted an additional scanning experiment showing that a majority of self-built root CAs do sign certificates for websites open to the public. We deployed several controlled Virtual Private Servers on Alibaba-Cloud [18], located in the US, Singapore, Germany, and China. On each machine, we used OpenSSL to fetch and verify certificate chains of the 3,311 FQDNs that link to self-built root CAs in our dataset. In January 2021 (6 months after the data collection period ended), we were able to fetch certificate chains of 2,439 FQDNs (73.6%) that still link to 36 (72%) self-built certificate groups. We also inspected the remaining 14 organizations that disappeared in the scanning experiment, and found that 7 of them were for internal use, thus the certificates could not be reached by our active scanners. The remaining 7 groups were retired by new self-built root CAs or publicly trusted root CAs.

Our measurement findings suggest that weak security implementations are common among self-built root CAs and should be fixed, as they widely sign websites that are publicly accessible.

**Finding 4.5:** Fake CAs, which impersonate large trusted CAs with good reputation to evade detection, are becoming emerging security threats. These CAs infect more than 2.7 million devices and are highly trusted by web clients, as nearly none report “Authority Invalid” errors.

**Fake root CAs:** 11 of the top 100 certificate groups are classified as fake root CAs that impersonate trusted CAs with deceptive subject names. As shown by examples in Table 3, they replace characters in authentic CA names with homoglyphs (e.g., Verislgn with an “l” and NetWork with an upper-case “W”) or extend their words (e.g., extend GlobalSign to GlobalSignature). However, none of the certificates' public keys are present in the official lists of large CAs (e.g., public key lists of GlobalSign [62] and Certum [11]).

In Table 2, we show that these fake CAs associate with the most web visits (192M) and certificate chains (2.7M), and almost all of them are trusted by web clients (only 0.0001% of connections receive an AUTHORITY_INVALID error). Compared to self-built CAs that commonly use weak keys and algorithms, fake root CAs are more secure in implementation, with an invalid rate of only 0.25%. However, fake root CAs still introduce security threats, as they have been found to illegally issue certificates for popular websites [39].

Uncovering the real owner behind fake root certificates is challenging, as the subjects are deceptive names that do not provide valuable information. To explore by our best effort, we leverage threat intelligence systems and sandbox logs of malware. We first searched all fake root certificates in threat intelligence systems (such as VirusTotal), but only found one hit. The matched certificate was associated with a Trojan [17] and was witnessed by 6.8 thousand web clients in 75 thousand web visits during our data collection period. Following, we also sought cooperation with two leading security companies and matched the certificates in their sandbox logs of malware samples. During malware installation, the sandboxes monitor the local root store to track modifications. We were able to find logs of 43 fake root certificates in our dataset, which associate with “Trojan,” “CoinMiner,” and “Adware.” Again, we were not able to identify the real owner of all fake root certificates in our dataset, but information embedded in threat intelligence and sandboxes show their potential connection to malicious parties.

Considering the large volume of HTTPS connections and web clients affected by fake CAs, we speculate that, in addition to malicious software, hidden certs in this category may also come from other sources, including spamming tools and free applications.
