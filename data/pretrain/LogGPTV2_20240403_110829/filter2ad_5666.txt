William C. Carter Award 
Dr.  William  C.  Carter  was  a  key  figure  in  the  formation  and  development  of  the  field  of 
dependable  computing  and  fault  tolerance.  His  career  spanned  over  four  decades,  from 
programming,  debugging,  and  recovery  in  ENIAC,  through  reliability,  availability  and 
serviceability during the evolution and definition of IBM mainframes. In particular, he took great 
interest  in  the  future  of  the  field  and  was  instrumental  in  promoting  the  work  of  young 
contributors.  It  was  characteristic  of  Bill  to  take  the  initiative  in  reaching  out  to  students  and 
younger colleagues. Despite the demands of his own career, he knew the value of taking the time 
to encourage, mentor, and inspire newcomers to the field.
The William C. Carter Award has been presented annually since 1997, and was established by the IEEE Technical 
Committee  on  Fault-Tolerant  Computing  (TC-FTC)  together  with  the  IFIP  Working  Group  on  Dependable 
Computing  and  Fault  Tolerance  (WG  10.4).  The  award  is  intended  to  honor  and  carry  on  Dr.  Carter’s  legacy  by 
recognizing an outstanding paper based on a graduate dissertation. 
To  qualify,  a  paper  based  on  a  student’s  dissertation  must  have  been  submitted  as  a  regular  paper  to  the  DCC 
Symposium  within  DSN,  with  the  student  as  the  first  author.  Both  current  graduate  students  and  former  graduate 
students,  no  more  than  two  years  past  the  completion  of  their  dissertation,  are  eligible.  All  Carter  Award 
submissions accepted as regular DCCS papers were evaluated by the DSN Steering Committee.  
The winner of the 2006 William C. Carter Award is  
Jonathan Chang of Princeton University
Automatic Instruction-Level Software-Only Recovery Methods 
for the paper entitled 
by Jonathan Chang, George Reis, and David August.
