User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Open Source Alternative to Microsoft's File Replication Services We're operating two rather busy locations with 40+Gigs of client data shared on Windows 2003 servers and need to have it replicated (as close to instantaneously as possible) to each.

We're experiencing intermittent replication failures, and have attempted various fixes, but are basically working blind since the errors we're getting in the event log aren't particularly helpful.

So, the best situation would be one that always worked, and when it didn't was transparent about its reasons.

Any suggestions welcome.

Thank you.

Update: We're actually using FRS to to the replication now and the problem still persists.

Assistant: rsync

there is a mirror option for it.  much like robocopy &amp; it is opensource  &amp; there are windows binaries!
