User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Remote Desktop to localhost on Startup & two active accounts I have 2 accounts on my machine one is the foreground account (console) that runs media center software.

The other account runs other programs I use in a remote desktop session.

I have enabled group policy to force 1 account per RDP session to stop applications starting multiple times.

But I cannot create a startup task to login the 2nd user when the 1st account autologin takes place on boot.

Is there a way to create a user session without RDP?

Everytime I try to RDP to the machine locally with or without console flag i get this error "Your computer could not connect to another console session"

Assistant: You want stuff to be running locally on console &amp; then RDP remotely &amp; not affect the console session? 
Or 
You want to have 2 login accounts that can RDP remotley into the desktop &amp; take over the console?

For the latter, then RDP should do the job, make sure you have firewall rules setup to have exceptions for TCP 3389 which RDP uses.

Applications like winVNC and tightVNC always log you into the console session, maybe try these?  RDP has much better performance if you can get it to work.

If you want the former, then your out of luck. I think MS has put this in as a limitation on windows desktops like XP/Vista so you dont end up using them as terminal servers.  

You could do with with windows server?   There may be OS level hack to get this to work in a desktop OS, but i have never had the need to do it.
