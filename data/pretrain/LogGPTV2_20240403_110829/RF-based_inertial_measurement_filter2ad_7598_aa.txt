ABSTRACT
Inertial measurements are critical to almost any mobile applications.
It is usually achieved by dedicated sensors (e.g., accelerometer, gyro-
scope) that suffer from significant accumulative errors. This paper
presents RIM, an RF-based Inertial Measurement system for precise
motion processing. RIM turns a commodity WiFi device into an
Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) that can accurately track moving
distance, heading direction, and rotating angle, requiring no addi-
tional infrastructure but a single arbitrarily placed Access Point
(AP) whose location is unknown. RIM makes three key technical
contributions. First, it presents a spatial-temporal virtual antenna
retracing scheme that leverages multipath profiles as virtual an-
tennas and underpins measurements of distance and orientation
using commercial WiFi. Second, it introduces a super-resolution
virtual antenna alignment algorithm that resolves sub-centimeter
movements. Third, it presents an approach to handle measurement
noises and thus delivers an accurate and robust system. Our experi-
ments, over a multipath rich area of >1,000 m2 with one single AP,
show that RIM achieves a median error in moving distance of 2.3 cm
and 8.4 cm for short-range and long-distance tracking respectively,
and 6.1◦ mean error in heading direction, all significantly outper-
forming dedicated inertial sensors. We also demonstrate multiple
RIM-enabled applications with great performance, including indoor
tracking, handwriting, and gesture control.

etc., and have been widely used in robots, drones, automotive, un-
manned vehicles, various consumer electronics, and pretty much
anything that moves. The mainstream has been using Inertial Mea-
surement Units (IMUs) for motion tracking1. The rise in demand of
accurate and robust motion tracking, coupled with the increase in
smart device production, has been driving the IMU market, which
is projected to grow from $15.71 billion in 2016 to $21.74 billion
by 2022 [23]. An improvement to motion measurements will pro-
foundly impact a number of systems and applications.
Precise and robust motion measurement, however, is non-trivial.
The prevalent IMUs realized by MEMS sensors, namely accelerom-
eters that measure linear acceleration, gyroscopes that calculate
angular velocity, and magnetometers that report orientation, are
well known to suffer from significant errors and drifts that are non-
trivial to be recalibrated [33, 47]. For example, an accelerometer
is hardly capable of measuring moving distance due to the noisy
readings; magnetometer does not report heading direction and is
easily distorted by surrounding environments; while gyroscope
experiences considerable drifts introduced by integration especially
in long run. These limitations prevent many applications that re-
quire accurate motion processing, such as indoor tracking, virtual
reality, motion sensing games.
Recent years have witnessed much progress in using radio sig-
nals to localize and track targets. Despite novel systems that have
led to decimeter or even centimeter location accuracy [13, 14, 43],
they only address location while all suffer from significant common
limitations that prohibit ubiquitous accurate inertial measurements:
(1) They all require one or multiple precisely installed APs, as well
as accurate information about their locations and/or orientations.
A small error in the APs’ geometry information will lead to large
location errors. (2) They do not directly measure multiple motion
parameters but rather can only determine one or two of them from
successive location estimates. Nor can they track in-place angular
motion. (3) Many of them face accuracy limitations dictated by
frequency bandwidth, antenna amount, and synchronization errors
on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) WiFi, and degenerate or even
fail in complex Non-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS) scenarios.
In this paper, we present RIM, an RF-based Inertial Measure-
ment system that measures multiple parameters of object motions,
namely moving distance, heading direction, and rotating angle. RIM
turns standard COTS WiFi radios into precise IMUs, without sup-
port from additional infrastructure or external sensors. RIM does
not require large bandwidth, many phased antennas, or multiple
APs as reference anchors, nor does it need a priori calibration or
fingerprinting of the environment. It has minimal requirements of
mere antennas available on COTS WiFi receivers, in addition to a
single arbitrarily placed AP as a transmitter, without knowing the

ter estimation of moving distance, heading direction, and rotating angle, and use both
interchangeably in this paper.

AP’s location or orientation. RIM passively measures the Channel
State Information (CSI) of packets transmitted by the AP, without
any other support from it. In contrast to many prior indoor tracking
proposals that are flawed in NLOS, RIM works anywhere the AP
signal reaches, be there LOS or through multiple walls.
RIM leverages an unseen opportunity with MIMO WiFi radios
present in most smart hardware. We illustrate the intuition in Fig.
1. When an antenna array moves, one antenna may retrace the
trajectory of another and observe the same channel when and only
when it arrives at a location traveled by the preceding antenna,
allowing for a possibility of “self-tracing” of the array at micro and
transient scale. This observation leads to the design of RIM, struc-
tured around three components, which thwarts the conventional
burdensome “outside-in” tracking solutions and enables precise
motion measurement in a ubiquitous “inside-out” system:
(1) Spatial-temporal virtual antenna retracing: Take the two-
antenna array as shown in Fig. 1 as an intuitive example. When the
array moves, each antenna captures a channel snapshot at every
point along its trajectory as if it sets up a virtual antenna there.
The antenna travels later (i.e., the following antenna, Antenna #1
in this example) will retrace every location the preceding antenna
(Antenna #2) has traveled. From the time offset the following an-
tenna takes to be spatially aligned with (i.e., arrive at the location
of) a virtual antenna that the preceding antenna emulated, we can
estimate the moving speed by dividing the travel distance by the
time offset. Here the travel distance is identical to the antenna sep-
aration, which is known and fixed and independent of how they
move. Extending to 2D antenna arrays (e.g., a circular array as in
Fig. 2), we can track the speed in multiple directions designated by
different pairs of antennas. That is, we can measure the moving dis-
tance and heading direction using a 2D array. The main challenge,
however, is to detect the spatial alignment of two virtual antennas
with high precision.
(2) Super-resolution virtual antenna alignment: The key in-
sight behind highly accurate antenna alignment is that signals
received at different locations undergo diverse reflecting paths and
delays, resulting in a unique multipath profile for each location
(virtual antenna). Achieving super-resolution alignment, however,
is non-trivial because: 1) channel measurements on COTS WiFi
are considerably noisy, 2) there is only one single measurement
associated with one virtual antenna, and 3) it is performed upon
measurements from different antennas with hardware heterogene-
ity. In RIM, we achieve sub-centimeter resolution virtual antenna
alignment by three folds. First, we leverage the physics of time-
reversal focusing effects in electromagnetic waves and employ an
effective metric to distinguish two channel snapshots, which sig-
nificantly improve location distinction [17, 39]. Second, although a
single measurement may not be robustly distinctive, the alignment
can be boosted by leveraging a number of virtual antennas, forming
a virtual massive array. Yet different from some previous works
using virtual arrays for Synthetic Aperture Radar [15], we do not
need any information on how the virtual antennas are located in
space. Third, we only focus on potential alignment within a short
period (e.g., 0.5 seconds) over a small space (e.g., centimeters), for
which the channel is unlikely to be changed.
(3) Precise motion reckoning: Built upon virtual antenna retrac-
ing and alignment, we devise a novel algorithm to 1) accurately and
robustly pinpoint the temporal delays when two antennas are spa-
tially aligned, 2) reliably determine which pair of antennas, among
others, are aligned at a specific time, and 3) systematically inte-
grate all information together to output moving distance, heading
direction, and rotating angle if there is any.
We implement RIM on COTS WiFi chipsets and deploy it over
one floor of busy office space. We evaluate the accuracy of RIM us-
ing three antennas available on commodity WiFi Network Interface
Cards (NIC) and further extend its capability by designing a hexag-
onal array that combines two unsynchronized NICs. Experiments
show that, with an unmodified WiFi receiver measuring a single
unknown AP on a standard channel, RIM achieves a median error
in moving distance of 2.3 cm and 8.4 cm for on-desk short-range
movement and on-cart long traces respectively, 6.1◦ degrees mean
error in heading direction, and around 30◦ mean error in rotating
angle (corresponding to about 1.3 cm error in rotating distance). A
set of case studies are conducted to demonstrate RIM’s potential ap-
plications, including indoor tracking, handwriting, gesture control,
and system integration with inertial sensors. With the promising
performance, RIM would upend the way inertial measurement tradi-
tionally has been practiced, complementing and perhaps ultimately
precluding the need for erroneous inertial sensors.
2 OVERVIEW
RIM enables inertial measurement purely based on RF signals, turn-
ing COTS WiFi radios into accurate IMUs. Specifically, it aims at
measuring three dimensions of motion parameters as traditional
IMUs do, yet at a much finer precision:
• Moving distance: The translation distance the target has
moved, which is usually coarsely sensed by an accelerometer
by step counting [44];
• Heading direction: The moving direction, which is very
difficult for conventional sensors to measure [28] and thus
usually assumed as the device orientation reported by a
magnetometer;
• Rotating angle: The angle of angular rotation, typically
measured by a gyroscope.
RIM estimates all these parameters for 2D motions in a universal
scheme termed as spatial-temporal virtual antenna retracing (§3.1),
and boosts the precision by a novel approach for super-resolution

virtual antenna alignment (§3.2). Then we strive to enable RIM on
COTS WiFi, delivering a comprehensive system for accurate and
robust inertial measurement (§4).
3 VIRTUAL ANTENNA ALIGNMENT
3.1 Virtual Antenna Retracing
Our key idea to turn a WiFi radio into an IMU lies in a novel scheme
for local motion tracking, named spatial-temporal virtual antenna
retracing (STAR). In this section, we illustrate how STAR enables
measuring linear and angular motion, first in 1D and then 2D cases.
1D case: Recall the simplest scenario of a two-antenna array in
1D case, as shown in Fig. 1. When two antennas are moving along
the line formed by themselves, one antenna will lead the trajec-
tory while another immediately follows its “footprints”. Whichever
antenna will take a snapshot of a location it passed through by
recording the CSI observations, as if it set up a virtual antenna
there. Since the two antennas are moving along the same trace, one
after another, the following antenna will continuously encounter
the virtual phantoms of the leading one. Considering time tk in
Fig. 1, the blue following antenna arrives at the location where the
green leading antenna traveled through at time t1. By examining
the arriving time difference ∆t = tk − t1, we can derive the antenna
array’s traveling speed v = ∆d/∆t, where the traveling distance
during this time offset is known a priori as the separation distance
∆d between the two antennas. Then by continuously aligning the
following antenna with the leading antenna’s “footprints”, we will
obtain the real-time speeds along the whole trajectory. The moving
direction is, obviously, the orientation of the ray formed by the two
aligned antennas.
In one word, the key to estimate motion distance and orientation
is to determine (1) whether or not two antennas are aligned, and
(2) if yes, what the time delay ∆t is. We leave this task to the next
section and first present how to resolve motion in the 2D case.
2D case: To measure distance and orientation in 2D space, we re-
sort to 2D arrays of antennas. Similar to the 1D case, each pair
of antennas enables distance measurement for the two directions
