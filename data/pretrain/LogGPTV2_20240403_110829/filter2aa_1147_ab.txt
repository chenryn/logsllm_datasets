Standard Protocols
• Overview
• Creating a file sharing application is science
• Creating a message protocol is art and wizardry
• Benefits
• Interoperability
• Undetectable  means  we’re  essentially  invisible
• Designing a good protocol is hard work
• A transport protocol is just a means to an end
• More concerned with the exchange of data
• The Solution
• Use pre-existing protocols and standards
• HTTP, XML, JSON, etc.
Saving Cyberspace means that we need to adhere to a standard set of pre-existing transfer protocols

Distributed Endpoints
• Overview
• Hybrid model
• Transformational network
• Centralized Model is Evil
• Activities monitored or logged?
• What happens if the server goes down?
• Ability  to  share  files  shouldn’t  depend  on  
others
• Never trust 3rd parties, corporations, or others 
that comply with data retention and copyright 
laws
Saving Cyberspace means that we will need to support a more flexible and distributed model for file sharing

Distributed Endpoints
• Decentralized Model is Evil
• Created a market for IP concealment services
• Danger of incoming connections
• IP address as a personal identifier
• Not suitable for low-power devices
• Inequality for all
• Device Agnostic
• Workstations, Servers, and Laptops
• Windows, Linux, Mac, Android, and iOS.
• Tablets, Phones, embedded, and other low-power 
consumption devices

• Personal Network
• Pervasive and ubiquitous
• Can be used by individuals, families, or millions
• The world in the palm of your hand
• The Solution
• Best of both worlds, worst of neither
• No direct communication, no fixed servers
• Based on network routing technologies
• Autonomy and segregation of duties
• Division of authority

Believe in the Right to Share

The Missing Link
• Dilemma
• Do we really need another file-sharing app?
• Casual Dropbox user with an addiction to torrents 
• Not happy with the current state of file sharing apps
• Share with friends, family, and/or strangers
• Access to all my content from anywhere in the world
• Fine-grained control
• Current Offerings
• Why doesn't a solution for me not already exist?
• It might, depending on your specific needs
• If not, what is your willingness to compromise and/or assume risk?
• With the right minds, this should be an easy problem to solve

• Authentication, authorization
• Diffie Hellman, AES, etc.
• Client
• Share files
• Transfer files
33
Architecture
• Router
• Group clients
• Control program flow
• Relay messages and/or data chunks
• Proxy
• Interface with external content sources
• Acquisition vs. aggregation

Summary
The Path Forward
“Only a life lived for others is a life worthwhile.”
– Albert Einstein
“And  one  more  thing.”
– Steve Jobs
38
Changing the World
• Self-Empowerment
• We possess a tremendous amount of talent
• We're good at what we do and we enjoy what we're good at
• Our skills are used to find vulnerabilities and exposing weaknesses
• Create something new and beautiful that has the power to change the world
• Enacting Change
• Demonsaw is a tool
• Allows us to deviate from the antiquated and insecure model of file-sharing 
• It gives us a new way to share our content without fear of retribution
• It is my hope that Demonsaw will enact change in content distribution
• Go  forth  and  share…
