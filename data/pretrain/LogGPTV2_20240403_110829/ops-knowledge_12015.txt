User: Answer the question about Azure Data Explorer Queued ingestion and data latencies:
How does queued ingestion affect my data?

Assistant: The batching manager buffers and batches ingress data based on the ingestion settings in the [ingestion batching policy](batching-policy.md). The ingestion batching policy sets batch limits according to three limiting factors, whichever is first reached: time elapsed since batch creation, accumulated number of items (blobs), or total batch size. The default batching settings are 5 minutes / 1 GB / 1000 blobs, meaning there will be at least a 5-minute delay when queueing a sample data for ingestion.
