User: How to view and edit the permissions of a file under Linux system?
Assistant: View file permissions: Use the command `ls -l` to view file permission information. For example: ``` $ ls -l myfile.txt -rw-r--r-- 1 user group 1234 Mar 10 10:05 myfile.txt ``` where `-rw-r--r--` means file The first character `-` indicates that this is a file, and the last three groups `rwx` indicate the permissions of the file owner, the group where the file belongs to, and other users, respectively indicating read, write, and execute permissions. In this example, the file owner has read and write permissions, and the file's group and other users only have read permissions. Edit file permissions: Use the command `chmod` to edit file permissions. The syntax is: ``` chmod [mode] [file] ``` where `mode` is the specific setting value of the permission, and `file` is the name of the file whose permission needs to be modified. `mode` can set permissions in numeric or symbolic form. There are two ways to set permissions numerically: - Numeric notation, eg `chmod 644 myfile.txt` sets the permissions of the file `myfile.txt` to `-rw-r--r--`. - Symbolic notation, such as `chmod u=rw,g=r,o=r myfile.txt` and `chmod a=rw myfile.txt` both set the permissions of the file `myfile.txt` to `-rw- rw-rw-`. When setting permissions in symbolic form, the following symbols can be used: - `u` means the file owner; - `g` means the group where the file belongs to; - `o` means other users; - `a` means all users; - `+` means to increase a certain permission; - `-` means to reduce a certain permission; - `=` means to set a certain permission.
