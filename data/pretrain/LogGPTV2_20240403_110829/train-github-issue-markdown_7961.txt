 **Context:**
  * Playwright Version: ^1.16.0-next-alpha-oct-7-2021
  * Operating System: Linux
  * Node.js version: v12.20.0
  * Browser: Firefox
    const options = {
        acceptDownloads: true,
        headless : false,    
    }
    async function start(){
        const browser = await firefox.launchPersistentContext("/tmp/firefox", options);
        const page = browser.pages()[0]  
        page.on('download', download => {
            download.path().then("DOWNLOAD DONE", console.log) //never shows up
        });
    }
    start().catch((e)=>{
        console.log(e)
    })
The bug:
I'm using a simple example with headless:false and trying to download a file
in a random website, but the function "download.path()" never resolves the
promise, which should return the file path. The code is working with "launch"
function.
