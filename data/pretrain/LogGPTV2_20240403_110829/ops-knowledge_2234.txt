User:  need to set up a load balancer to distribute traffic and prevent failures, which load balancing technique would you use and explain how?
Assistant: I recommend using a software based load balancing technology such as NGINX. The implementation steps are as follows: 1. Install NGINX. 2. Configure NGINX to proxy the backend server. 3. Configure load balancing modules, such as IP hash or polling. 4. Configure health checks to monitor backend server status and automatically recover when a server fails. 5. Configure SSL/TLS termination to secure application traffic. 6. Test the load balancer to make sure it is working properly. Load balancers enable traffic distribution and failure protection to ensure application availability and reliability.
