Hello,

I am currently working on TypeScript definitions for CreateJS. You can find the repository here: [CreateJS TypeScript Definitions](https://bitbucket.org/drk4/createjs_ts_definitions).

I believe it would be beneficial to have these definitions in a centralized location. If you are interested, please feel free to contribute. The definitions are still under testing, so it might be a good idea to include a message indicating that they are in a testing phase.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
