### Classification of Spam Bots Based on MX Behavior

Spam bots can be classified into four categories based on their MX (Mail eXchanger) behavior:

1. **RFC Compliant**: The malware sample targets all email servers in the target domain, following their priority order from highest to lowest, as specified in RFC 5321 [21].

2. **Primary Only**: The malware sample targets only the mail server with the highest priority. This is the fundamental assumption of nolisting.

3. **Secondary Only**: The malware sample targets only the mail server with the lowest priority, skipping the primary server altogether. Critics of nolisting often argue that this was the natural reaction of malware writers to nolisting.

4. **All MX**: The malware sample targets all the email servers of the target domain, in a random or systematic order.

By analyzing the communication of the malware samples with our DNS and email servers, we were able to categorize each family. For example, Kelihos only targets the primary server, which makes it susceptible to nolisting. Cutwail, on the other hand, immediately targets the lowest priority mail server, making it immune to nolisting. The two versions of Darkmailer we tested were RFC-compliant and contacted the email servers in order of priority.

### Greylisting Experiments

To evaluate the effectiveness of greylisting, we conducted experiments using three different greylisting thresholds: 5 seconds, 300 seconds (the default Postgrey threshold), and 21,600 seconds (6 hours).

#### Results Summary

- **Effectiveness Against Spam**: Our tests showed that greylisting is still very effective in practice. It successfully stopped Cutwail and Darkmailer (responsible for over 43% of global spam) from delivering any spam messages. However, Kelihos was able to cope with greylisting, rendering this countermeasure ineffective against this particular malware family.

- **Kelihos Behavior**: The cumulative distribution of delivery attempts for Kelihos (Figure 3) shows that the malware is not designed to take advantage of shorter greylisting thresholds. Instead, it retries message delivery after a minimum delay of 300 seconds, which is the default threshold used by popular greylisting software.

- **High Threshold Analysis**: When the greylisting threshold was set to 21,600 seconds (6 hours), we observed the complete behavior of Kelihos. Figure 4 illustrates the multiple delivery attempts made by the malware, with peaks at 300-600 seconds, around 5,000 seconds, and between 80,000 and 90,000 seconds. After several attempts, Kelihos was able to deliver its messages.

- **Subtle Side-Effects**: To rule out potential side-effects, we left a few email addresses unprotected (e.g., postmaster). All spam messages directed to these addresses were the same as those filtered by greylisting, confirming that there was only one spam task during the entire experiment.

### Real-World Deployment

We also examined the impact of greylisting on a real-world deployment, specifically the mail server of our University department. The results showed that greylisting is still able to block many popular malware families, preventing over 50% of spam from reaching user inboxes. However, the delays introduced by greylisting are significant. Even with a 300-second (5-minute) threshold, only half of the messages get delivered within 10 minutes, and some take over 50 minutes (Figure 5).

### Impact on Benign Emails

To further investigate the impact on benign emails, we created accounts on the top ten web-mail providers and sent test emails to our mail server. We removed the default whitelist in Postgrey and set the greylisting delay to 6 hours. The results (Table III) show that the retry policies of different web-mail providers vary significantly. Some services, like Gmail, made 9 attempts, while others, like Hotmail, made up to 94 attempts within the 6-hour window.

- **Retry Policies**: Most servers tried long enough to overcome the 6-hour greylisting threshold, but two, including AOL, abandoned the task after only 30 minutes. This is concerning, as RFC-822 [30] states that retries should continue for at least 4-5 days.

- **IP Address Usage**: Five out of ten web-mail providers used multiple IP addresses to deliver the same message, which can increase delivery times and potentially result in failed deliveries.

- **MTA Retransmission Times**: We also analyzed the retransmission times of the seven most popular MTA servers (Table IV). While some MTAs, like Sendmail and Qmail, have regular intervals, others, like Exchange, do not comply with RFC-822 regarding the time-to-live.

### Discussion

Our experiments confirm that both nolisting and greylisting remain effective in 2015, preventing over 70% of global spam. However, they also introduce negative side effects, such as increased delivery delays for legitimate emails. Greylisting is more effective but requires careful configuration, especially the whitelisting of web-mail providers. Nolisting, while simpler to deploy, is less well-known but still widely used.

- **Threshold Optimization**: A low greylisting threshold (e.g., 5 seconds) can help reduce delays for normal emails while still providing effective spam protection. A high threshold, while more robust against persistent malware, can cause significant delays.

- **Future Considerations**: Both techniques have been known for over a decade and remain effective. However, their effectiveness may change in the future, and it is important to monitor their performance to ensure they continue to provide value.

### Conclusion

Nolisting and greylisting are valuable tools in the fight against spam, but their implementation must be carefully managed to minimize negative impacts on legitimate email traffic. Combining both techniques can provide a robust defense against the majority of spam.
