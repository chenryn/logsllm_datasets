User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to add a service account (sp_c2wts) to local security policy using powershell? Is there a powershell way to achieve this? I have to do this for 40 servers.

Set the following permissions on all SharePoint servers in the farm (All must be done) – this is completed under Local Security Policy (gpedit.msc as administrator -> Windows Settings -> Security Settings -> Local Policies > User rights assignment) on each server

Grant Log on as a service 

Impersonate a User 

Act as part of the operating system

Assistant: This solution worked perfectly.
