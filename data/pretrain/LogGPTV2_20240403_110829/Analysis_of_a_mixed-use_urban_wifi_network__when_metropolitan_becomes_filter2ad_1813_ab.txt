### iPhone DNS Polling and Network Usage Analysis

#### DNS Polling for Software Updates
iPhones specifically poll the domain `iphone-wu.apple.com`, which is a CNAME (Canonical Name) for `wu.apple.com`. Therefore, when an iPhone queries for software updates, it receives DNS responses for both `iphone-wu.apple.com` and `wu.apple.com`. This can happen either because the DNS server proactively sends the A record for `wu.apple.com`, or the client subsequently requests it. In contrast, other Apple devices receive only the A record for `wu.apple.com`.

By comparing the total number of DNS responses destined to clients with Apple OUIs (Organizationally Unique Identifiers) for `iphone-wu.apple.com` and `wu.apple.com` in our packet header traces, we determined that the Gateway sees 1.13 times as many responses for `wu.apple.com`. Consequently, we conclude that 88% of the `wu.apple.com` responses actually resulted from queries for `iphone-wu.apple.com`.

#### Device Classification
iPhones constitute the vast majority of devices classified into the smartphone group, although other manufacturers such as Research in Motion (makers of BlackBerry devices) and Nokia are also present in the trace. As previously discussed, Ruckus and PePLink are two brands of WiFi modems recommended by Google for their network. Neither company appears to manufacture other classes of WiFi devices in significant numbers. Therefore, for the remainder of this paper, we have combined Ruckus and PePLink OUIs into a larger class termed "modem." We also include Ambit, whose only WiFi-capable devices appear to be cable modems. Finally, for lack of a better term, we classify the remaining devices as "hotspot users." While some portion of these devices may be misclassified, the general trends displayed by hotspot users are dominated by Intel, Hon Hai, and Gemtek, known for producing a significant fraction of integrated laptop WiFi chipsets. Notably, Hon Hai manufactures WiFi chipsets used in the Thinkpad line of laptops.

#### Network Activity Analysis
**Figure 3: Usage of the Google WiFi Network**
- **Y-Axis (Left):** Number of active clients
- **Y-Axis (Right):** Average activity time (in seconds)
- **X-Axis:** Time (in 15-minute intervals)

The results show that the Google WiFi network has a substantial daily user population, peaking around 2,500 simultaneous users in any 15-minute interval. The curves also show typical daily variation, with peaks in both users and activity during the day roughly twice the troughs early in the morning. Weekend use is lower than on weekdays, with approximately 15% fewer users during peak times. When users are connected, they are active for only a small fraction of the time, typically between 40–80 seconds (1–2%) on average per hour.

**Figure 4: Average Daily Use of the Google WiFi Network**
- **Y-Axis (Left):** Number of clients
- **Y-Axis (Right):** Average hourly client activity (in seconds)
- **X-Axis:** Hour of the day

This figure shows the daily variation of aggregate network behavior in more detail, with four curves representing the number of clients and average hourly client activity on a typical weekday and weekend day. Variations over time in the number of clients and their activity become more apparent at the scale of a single day. For example, there are multiple distinct peaks in clients on weekdays during morning rush hour (9 am), lunchtime (12:30 pm), and the end of evening rush hour (6 pm). Weekends, however, show a smoother pattern. The largest peaks for the number of clients and activity are offset by four hours. The number of clients peaks at 6 pm, while activity peaks at 10 pm late in the evening. The diurnal characteristics in the number of clients of the Google network match those of the MadMesh network, suggesting at least one high-level similarity in user populations in two widely separated locales.

#### Client Behavior by Device Type
**Figure 5: Hourly Usage of the Google WiFi Network by Device Type**
- **Y-Axis:** Number of active clients
- **X-Axis:** Hour of the day

- **(a) Weekdays:**
  - **Modem Clients:** Constant throughout the day, suggesting homes and businesses with multiple computers powered on all day.
  - **Hotspot Users:** Show typical diurnal activity, with peak usage in the late afternoon twice the trough early in the morning. Hotspot user activity is high from 9 am until 11 pm.
  - **Smartphone Users:** Show three distinct peaks during the day (9 am, 1 pm, and 6 pm), suggesting that smartphone usage is highly correlated with commute and travel times.

- **(b) Weekends:**
  - **Modem Clients:** Remain constant.
  - **Hotspot Users:** Approximately 10% fewer during the highly active period than on weekdays, but the period of high activity remains similar.
  - **Smartphone Users:** Peak usage no longer correlates with commute times, peaking at midday (1 pm) and diminishing steadily both before and after.

#### Network Traffic Analysis
**Figure 6: Total Bytes Transferred by Each Type of Client per Day**
- **Y-Axis:** Percentage of clients
- **X-Axis:** Total bytes transferred (log-scale)

- **Download to Upload Ratio:** Remains relatively constant across the trace at approximately 3.15:1, with distinctions between device classes. Hotspot and modem users are roughly equivalent at 2.9 and 3.2 to one, respectively, while smartphone usage is more skewed at 5.9:1.

**Figure 7: Instantaneous Transmission Rates During Activity Periods**
- **Y-Axis:** Percentage of session time when active
- **X-Axis:** Transfer rate (bytes/sec)

- **Median Rates:**
  - **Modem Users:** 3 KB/sec
  - **Hotspot Users:** 512 bytes/sec
  - **Smartphone Users:** 128 bytes/sec

- **Transfer Rate Distributions:**
  - **Modem Activity:** 80% transmit at 256 bytes/sec or higher, and 20% at 8 KB/sec.
  - **Hotspot Activity:** Uniformly distributed, with over 80% of transfer rates falling between 64 bytes/sec and 8 KB/sec.
  - **Smartphone Activity:** Falls into three regions: very low rates (40% less than 96 bytes/sec), linear between 96 bytes/sec and 768 bytes/sec (40%), and higher rates (20%).

#### Session Lengths
**Figure 8: CDF of Session Lengths**
- **Y-Axis:** Percentage of sessions
- **X-Axis:** Session duration (minutes, log-scale)

- **Session Characteristics:**
  - **Median Client:** Connects only twice.
  - **35% of Clients:** Appear only once.
  - **7% of Clients:** Connect at least once per day, on average.
  - **10% of Clients:** Connect at least once per weekday (20 times).

- **Session Length Distributions:**
  - **Modem Clients:** Significant fraction have sessions that span the entire trace; 65% of modem sessions are shorter than a day, due to oscillations between access points.

**Figure 9: Percentage of Session Time When Active**
- **Y-Axis:** Percentage of session time when active
- **X-Axis:** Percentile of session time

- **Client Activity:**
  - **Modem Clients:** High percentage of session time when active.
  - **Hotspot and Smartphone Users:** Lower percentage of session time when active, with variations depending on the type of activity.

In summary, the analysis provides insights into the DNS polling behavior of iPhones, the classification of devices, and the usage patterns of different types of clients on the Google WiFi network. The data reveals distinct usage profiles and traffic characteristics for each device type, highlighting the importance of understanding these differences for network management and optimization.
