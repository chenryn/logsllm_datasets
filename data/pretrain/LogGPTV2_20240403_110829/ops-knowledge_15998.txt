User: How to monitor server performance by viewing server CPU, memory, disk, network and other indicators?
Assistant: You can monitor server performance in the following ways: 1. Use the built-in performance monitoring tools of the system: you can use top, htop, free, vmstat and other commands under Linux systems; you can use Task Manager or Performance Monitor tools under Windows systems. 2. Install third-party monitoring software: monitoring software such as Nagios, Zabbix, Prometheus, etc. These software can collect server performance data and display them in charts, alarms, etc. 3. Use cloud monitoring services: such as Alibaba Cloud Monitoring, Tencent Cloud Monitoring and other cloud monitoring services, you can obtain server performance data through APIs or plug-ins, and you can set automatic alarms and other functions. 4. Use open source monitoring tools: Open source tools such as Grafana, Kibana, and Elasticsearch can be combined with various existing monitoring systems or custom plug-ins to monitor server performance. By monitoring the server's CPU, memory, disk, network and other indicators, you can find server performance problems in time, and take timely measures to solve the problems, thereby ensuring the stability and reliability of the server.
