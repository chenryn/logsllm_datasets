User: Is there a way to set custom headers of responses to static file requests?
E.g. I'd want to set Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * when serving static files.
Assistant: You can't; the only thing you can do is to stream these static files adding the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to the Response.
