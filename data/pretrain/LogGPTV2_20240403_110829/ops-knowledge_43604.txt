**User:** Is there a way to set custom headers for responses to static file requests? For example, I would like to set `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` when serving static files.

**Assistant:** While you cannot directly set custom headers for static file responses in the same way as for dynamic content, you can achieve this by streaming the static files and adding the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to the response. This approach allows you to serve static files with the desired headers.
