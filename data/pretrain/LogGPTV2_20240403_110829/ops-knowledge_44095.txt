User: How can I change drive letter while in IPython under windows?
For example, !cd W: does not make W: the current path, it just changes the path if you would change to drive W.
Changing to a dos shell with !cmd and then changing to W: does not have any effect to the IPython shell.
Assistant: I have a Win 10 machine with Anaconda 2020.11 python installed, out of the box no updates.  ipython 7.19.0.  The only way I can cd to somewhere on another drive letter is

cd d:/

No other permutation works: cd d:, cd d:, cd d:\, cd 'd:', cd 'd:', etc.
So there's an answer but it's quite annoying to figure out.
