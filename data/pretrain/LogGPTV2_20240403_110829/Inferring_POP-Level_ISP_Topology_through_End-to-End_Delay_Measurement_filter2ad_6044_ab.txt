4.2 Analysis of Core Delay
Based on the location information of the ISP CE routers in Sec.4.1, we infer
ISP core network topologies. In the inference process, we use railroad distances
between POPs and analyze where ISP POPs are located and how they are con-
nected to each other. In this section, we, ﬁrst, propose topology models of the
Japanese Internet. Then, we try to solove (2) with the measured delay data set
for the purpose of POP-level ISP topology inferences.
Topology Models of Japanese ISPs. We propose some ISP topology models
of the Japanese Internet to solve (2). This intends to disclose which pairs of (p, q)
make xp,q = 1 under Esrc,dst < qd for each pair of src and dst in (2). Here, we
adapt the restriction described in Sec.2 to introduce the models. And, there is
one more factor that is speciﬁc to Japan. The population concentrates in Tokyo,

Osaka, and cities along the Paciﬁc coast between Tokyo and Osaka, therefore
ISPs have planned the link and node aggregation based on these conditions.
We classify ISP topologies into the followings in Fig.3. Here, a star denotes a
layer three router and solid lines between routers are an ISP backbone network.
And a circle denotes a layer two switch and dashed lines between switches are
an ISP access network that is same as the NTT Flet’s service.
The diﬀerence between Type-1, 2 and 3 is how ISP backbone networks are
structured. A Type-1 network simply aggregates all the customer traﬃc to
Tokyo, and a Type-2 network aggregates them to Tokyo and Osaka. A Type-3
network, on the other hand, deploys routers in more or every prefecture and con-
nects next to each other. Layer three nodes are completely reduced in a Type-1
network, and a Type-3 network maximizes link aggregation. A Type-2 network is
an intermediate one of the Type-1 and Type-3. It would depend on the operation
policy of a ISP’s management.
The diﬀerence between Type-A and Type-B is how ISPs rely on NTT Flet’s
service for their layer two networks. In case of Type-A network, an ISP deploys
its layer three routers in each prefecture and connects to NTT Flet’s service
at there. In case of Type-B networks, on the other hand, an ISP aggregates
its customer traﬃc through NTT Flet’s service and only deploys its layer three
routers in the most populated prefectures such as Tokyo and Osaka. A Type-
B3 network does not exist, because it indicates that all the customer traﬃc is
exchanged through a layer two service.
Note that there are following two communication restrictions of NTT Flet’s
service; 1)All the PPPoE sessions connected from a measurement node are ter-
minated at a single PPPoE accommodation called BRAS which is managed by
NTT Flet’s service. 2)Even though NTT Flet’s service provides layer two net-
works for ISPs, users who connect to the same ISP at the same prefecture cannot
communicate with each other through the layer two network by the nature of the
service. So, if two users connect to a Type-B1 ISP, traﬃc between them always
goes through Tokyo even if they are in the same prefecture. Since we only focus
on ISPs that apply NTT Flet’s service as their layer two networks in this paper,
the possible network structures are covered by the above classiﬁcations. This is
because NTT Flet’s service should deploy layer two switches in every prefecture
due to legal regulations and ISPs can only construct their network based on the
layer two structure.

Core Delay between POPs. The rest of the restrictions to solve the equa-
tions(2) is to determine the link delay denoted as cd(p, q). We assume cd(p, q) =
RD(p, q)/C(cid:4) where C(cid:4) is light speed in optical ﬁber described in Sec.4, and
RD(p, q) is derived from geographical information shown in Fig.44. Here, nu-
merical symbols denote cities we set up measurement nodes and alphabetical
symbols denote railroad distance RD between POPs. Since the RD is a distance
between stations, there is some distance between stations and residences. We
assume that the distance between users is approximately 10% longer than RD.
Inferring POP-Level ISP Topologies. Solving the simultaneous equations
with the measured delays, we infer the four ISP topologies as follows.
ISP X: We use the same data set in Sec. 4.1 and Table 1 shows the end-to-end
delays of the ISP X. The ISP X is a Tokyo centric network, that is a TYPE-A1
network, because the ISP deploys its CE routers in each prefecture, and the core
delays between Tokyo and most of the other cities closely correlate with the
distances.
One exception we ﬁnd interesting is that the end-to-end delay between Tokyo
and Shizuoka is larger than the corresponding delay between Tokyo and Nagoya,
while the distance of the former is shorter than it of the latter. To ﬁgure out the
reason, we introduce an assumption that the path between them goes through
POPs away from both Tokyo and Shizuoka. The core delay between Tokyo and
Shizuoka is about 8.0[msec], therefore the ﬁber length would be around 800[km]
where the length between Tokyo and Shizuoka is about 180[km]. Since NTT
Flet’s Service in Shizuoka is operated by NTT West5 and NTT West has a huge
data center in Osaka, one possible assumption is that the link detours via Osaka.

Table 1. End-to-End Delays of the ISP X [msec]
So, we can conclude that the layer two network between Tokyo and Shizuoka
goes through Osaka, even though Shizuoka and Osaka are not adjacent with
each other in the layer three network.
ISP Y: The ISP Y has characteristics of Type-A2 network except the network
aggregates traﬃc not only to Tokyo and Osaka but also to Fukuoka that is
the largest city in Kyushu Island. We infer this as follows. Sapporo and Sendai
are the neighbors of Tokyo and Akita connects to Sendai. Toyama, Shizuoka,
Nagoya, Kochi and Hiroshima are the neighbors of Osaka. Tokyo, Nagoya and
Osaka connect to each other. And, Saga and Naha are the neighbors of Fukuoka.
Since the core delay between Tokyo and Shizuoka is larger than the expected
value derived from the geographical distance, the ISP Y also has a detour path
between them.
ISP Z: Since we classify the ISP Z network as a Type-B network in Sec.4.1, we
only infer where the ISP Z deploys its CE routers and how each node connects to
CE routers. Based on the collected delay data, we infer that the ISP Z deploys
its CE routers in Tokyo and Osaka. And, Tokyo is the neighbor of Sapporo,
Akita and Sendai and Osaka is the neighbor of Tokyo and Toyama, Shizuoka,
Nagoya, Kochi, Hiroshima, Fukuoka, Saga and Naha. Therefore the layer three
network of the ISP Z only exists between Osaka and Tokyo.
ISP W: Solving the simultaneous equation with the delay data, we infer the ISP
W topology is a TYPE-A3 as follows. Most cities connect to the neighbor cities.
Here, the neighbor of Toyama is Tokyo; the neighbors of Kochi are both Osaka
and Hiroshima; and the neighbor of Naha is Fukuoka.
Figure 5 shows topological properties of ISP networks that we infer through
the above processes. These ISP topology inferences are convinced by traceroute
results and anonymous network operator sights. The results indicate that com-
munication delay between users even in the same ISP diﬀers depending on which
ISP users connect to.

In addition, according to the result in case of ISP-X, the dissociations between
layer two and three networks cannot be disclosed if we only use traceroute or
other layer three information based measurements.
5 Related Work
Spring et al. propose Rocketfuel[1] to infer router level ISP topologies. Rocketfuel
uses traceroute and aims to explore adjacency relationships between routers.
Teixeira et al. point out that POP level topologies inferred by Rocketful have
signiﬁcant path diversity, and therefore they introduce the heuristic approach to
improve the accuracy of the inferred Rocketfuel topologies[2]. In [6], Augustin
et al. propose Paris traceroute to explore more accurate routing path compared
to existing traceroutes. Diﬀerent from these works, our approach aims to infer
POP-level ISP topologies without relying on the ISP core information.
Network tomography is a research ﬁeld that aims to ﬁgure out network charac-
teristics through end-to-end measurements. Coates et al. introduce an overview
of tomographic approaches for inferring link-level network performance[7]. Since
their approach basically analyzes network characteristics from a single source
point of view, Rabbat et al. propose new approaches that explore network char-
acteristics through multiple source measurements[8]. We also investigate link-
level network characteristics through multiple source measurements in [9] and
furthermore infer ISP topologies with the same collected delay data set.
6 Conclusion
In this paper, we present a new approach for inferring POP-level ISP topologies.
Since our approach leverages the end-to-end communication delay between res-
idential users, layer one and two information and candidate POP locations for
topology inferences, it is diﬀerent from any previous works that require ISP core
network information such as domain names of routers. Considering that ISPs
tend to hide both their layer two and three structures including domain names
of their equipments, our approach should become one of realistic approaches to
exploring ISP topologies. Since it has been common that ISPs independently
construct their layer two and three networks in these days, taking account of
end-to-end communication characteristics is necessary to infer ISP topologies
even for ISPs.

K. Yoshida et al.
We apply round-trip delay measurements to infer ISP topologies based on an
assumption that a round-trip path is identical. Even though this assumption
is true in this paper, we need take the fact that there are asymmetric paths
between users into account as our future work.
