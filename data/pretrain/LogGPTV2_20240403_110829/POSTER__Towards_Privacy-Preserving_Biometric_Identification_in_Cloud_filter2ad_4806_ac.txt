Introduction
Biometry is the science of establishing the identity of a person based on
human physical or behavioral attributes, Li and Jain [122]. The ﬁrst systematic
capture of biometric data for identiﬁcation purposes was done by William
Herschel in 1858. In 1870, Alphonse Bertillon developed a method for the
recognition of criminals based on body measurements, such as height or surface’s
marks, for instance scares and tattoos, Ross et al. [182]. With the passage of
time, a complete methodology was developed where biometrics stored and
separated into categories for retrieval and matching procedures in applications
for law enforcement. From the late 19th to the early 20th century, ﬁngerprint
identiﬁcation was introduced and widely used by police agencies, Maltoni et
al. [131]. Over the years, shortcomings and weaknesses of these measurements
and techniques were identiﬁed. This knowledge increased the need for more
accurate features and led to the development of new technologies that have
been successfully deployed, Jain et al. [102].
Biometric systems rely on who a person is, or what someone does, contrary
to other authentication approaches and credential types, such as passwords,
Personal Identiﬁcation Number (PIN) codes, tokens or cards that can be
forgotten, guessed, transferred, copied, lost or stolen as explained by Podio
in [166]. Moreover, in today’s electronically connected society means people are
asked to remember a multitude of personal identiﬁcation numbers for computer
accounts, bank automated teller machines (ATMs), e-mails, wireless phones, web
sites and so forth, Tistarelli and Nixon [205]. Although biometric characteristics
are mainly introduced for applications useful in forensic science and the
government sector, due to the fast-paced digital revolution, the automatic
biometric-based recognition of a person’s identity becomes constantly more

INTRODUCTION
popular and sometimes compulsive since it is considered to be fundamental
for reliable day-to-day transactions, di Vimercati et al. [63], Shoniregun and
Crosier [191]. Examples of these applications include several commercial and
civilian services, such as the physical access control for facilities, the logical
access control to log into biometrically-enabled devices, to secure electronic
banking and online transactions and to improve border security among others,
Campisi [39]. While the use of biometrics is a part of the daily routine, the
proliferation of mobile and web-based technologies have further accentuated
the need for improved identity management solutions that can accommodate a
large number of users, Ashbourn [15], Menezes et al. [142], Simoens et al. [195].
According to a recent study of Acuity [5], all smartphone devices will have
at least some kind of an embedded biometric technology by 2019, while by
2020 the technology will be applicable to wearable tech and tablets. In the age
of the Internet, the need for highly accessible, scalable and secure biometric
deployments moves the existing biometric technology to the cloud. Furthermore,
Acuity [5] estimates that users’ biometric data will be outsourced to the cloud and
more than 5.5 billion biometrically-enabled devices will create a global platform
by 2022. A governance cloud-based Biometrics as a Service (BaaS) framework
can leverage the cloud infrastructures, allowing for component developers to
outsource the tools for biometric authentication and identiﬁcation purposes as
described by Talreja et al. [202], Zareen et al. [230] and Zhu et al. [232]. It is
expected that the usability of the cloud computing services will be increased
and Service Providers (SPs) will be capable of authenticating more than one
trillion transactions annually while the revenue of markets will rise rapidly.
Thanks to the imaginative and ﬂattering depiction of biometric systems in movies
and television shows, the general perception is that the biometric technology is
foolproof, Burge and Bowyer [37]. However, its increasing usage has proven the
weaknesses and has given rise to additional security and privacy concerns as
analyzed by Jain and Kumar [99]. Although biometrics as an authentication
mechanism are intended primarily to enhance security, biometric data are unique
physical properties that people carry on; a fact that renders them sensitive
by nature, Ngo et al. [151] and Yang et al. [227]. Furthermore, the biometric
applications require the collection and storage of datasets for matching purposes
and their transmission and processing across third parties could be compromised,
Pagnin and Mitrokotsa [158]. Biometrics can also be used as identiﬁers to link
the users’ information across diﬀerent applications for proﬁling or to trace their
whereabouts and in that way they may reveal more personal information than
necessary, Bhattasali et al. [21]. These elements emphasize the fact that there
are numerous challenges that need to be addressed in order to broaden the
reach of biometric technology.
A biometric scheme is a pattern recognition system that compares the extracted

features of a user with the stored template of biometric datasets from a prior
enrollment process. Biometric recognition systems that use one biometric trait
of the individual for identiﬁcation and veriﬁcation purposes are called unimodal
designs, Li and Jain [122]. However, unimodal traits might not be compatible
