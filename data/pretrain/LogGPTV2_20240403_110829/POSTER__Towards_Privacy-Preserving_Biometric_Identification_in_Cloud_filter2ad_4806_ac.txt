## Part I: Security and Privacy in Biometric Schemes

### Chapter 1: Introduction

Biometry is the science of establishing a person's identity based on their physical or behavioral attributes, as defined by Li and Jain [122]. The first systematic capture of biometric data for identification purposes was conducted by William Herschel in 1858. In 1870, Alphonse Bertillon developed a method for recognizing criminals using body measurements, such as height and surface marks like scars and tattoos, as described by Ross et al. [182]. Over time, a comprehensive methodology was developed, where biometric data were stored and categorized for retrieval and matching in law enforcement applications. From the late 19th to the early 20th century, fingerprint identification was introduced and widely adopted by police agencies, as noted by Maltoni et al. [131]. As these methods were refined, new technologies emerged, addressing the shortcomings and weaknesses of earlier techniques, as analyzed by Jain et al. [102].

Biometric systems authenticate individuals based on who they are or what they do, unlike other authentication methods such as passwords, Personal Identification Numbers (PINs), tokens, or cards, which can be forgotten, guessed, transferred, copied, lost, or stolen, as explained by Podio [166]. In today's interconnected world, people must remember numerous personal identification numbers for various accounts, including computer logins, bank ATMs, emails, mobile phones, and websites, as discussed by Tistarelli and Nixon [205]. While biometric characteristics were initially used in forensic science and government sectors, the digital revolution has made biometric-based recognition increasingly popular and sometimes mandatory for reliable daily transactions, as highlighted by di Vimercati et al. [63] and Shoniregun and Crosier [191]. These applications include physical and logical access control, securing electronic banking and online transactions, and enhancing border security, as noted by Campisi [39]. The proliferation of mobile and web-based technologies has further emphasized the need for improved identity management solutions that can handle large user bases, as discussed by Ashbourn [15], Menezes et al. [142], and Simoens et al. [195].

According to a recent study by Acuity [5], all smartphone devices will incorporate some form of embedded biometric technology by 2019, and by 2020, this technology will extend to wearable tech and tablets. In the age of the Internet, the demand for highly accessible, scalable, and secure biometric deployments is driving the migration of biometric technology to the cloud. Acuity [5] estimates that by 2022, more than 5.5 billion biometrically-enabled devices will create a global platform, with users' biometric data being outsourced to the cloud. A governance cloud-based Biometrics as a Service (BaaS) framework can leverage cloud infrastructures, allowing developers to outsource tools for biometric authentication and identification, as described by Talreja et al. [202], Zareen et al. [230], and Zhu et al. [232]. This is expected to increase the usability of cloud computing services, enabling service providers to authenticate over one trillion transactions annually and significantly boost market revenue.

Despite the positive portrayal of biometric systems in movies and television, real-world usage has exposed their vulnerabilities and raised significant security and privacy concerns, as analyzed by Jain and Kumar [99]. Although biometrics are intended to enhance security, the unique physical properties they rely on make them inherently sensitive, as discussed by Ngo et al. [151] and Yang et al. [227]. Additionally, the collection, storage, and transmission of biometric data across third parties can be compromised, as noted by Pagnin and Mitrokotsa [158]. Biometrics can also be used to link users' information across different applications for profiling or tracking, potentially revealing more personal information than necessary, as highlighted by Bhattasali et al. [21]. These challenges underscore the need to address multiple issues to expand the reach of biometric technology.

A biometric scheme is a pattern recognition system that compares a user's extracted features with a stored template from a prior enrollment process. Systems that use a single biometric trait for identification and verification are called unimodal designs, as defined by Li and Jain [122]. However, unimodal traits may not always be compatible with all users, leading to the development of multimodal biometric systems.
