### File Extensions and Their Frequencies

The following table lists common file extensions found on small-office/home-office (SOHO) devices, along with their respective counts:

### Providers as a Major Source of Anonymous FTP Servers

Anonymous FTP servers are often hosted by providers in the IPv4 address space. Table VIII shows the most common file extensions found on SOHO devices. While we will later discuss the use of anonymous FTP for pirated content exchanges, we find that the majority of `.mp3`, `.avi`, and `.mp4` files appear to be users' personal media collections.

### Sensitive Documents

We also identified a significant number of sensitive documents, including over 12,600 email archives and 7,700 Quicken data files. Table IX provides a breakdown of the most prevalent and potentially sensitive files. We found instances where a single FTP server held 688 `.pst` files (Outlook mailboxes), another with 146 shadow files (Unix password databases), and a third with years of financial file backups. Anecdotally, we observed many other examples of private information, such as medical records, company bids, and human resource records. Unfortunately, these files are often personalized, making precise measurement infeasible.

### Photo Libraries

A similar pattern emerged for personal photos, with 13.7 million photos (12.9 million with readable permissions) found on 17,000 servers. These photos, organized in directories, provide an intimate glimpse into users' personal lives, including weddings, family reunions, vacations, and birthday parties.

### Root File Systems Exposed

Many devices expose most, if not all, of their file systems via FTP. By looking for known OS-root directories, we estimated the number of exposed root file systems. We found 825 Windows, 3,858 Linux, and 15 macOS servers with their OS-root directories exposed.

### Scripting Source Code

In the case of hosting providers, allowing customers to upload and traverse web pages' source files is not necessarily a vulnerability. However, if it exposes server-side scripts, it can significantly reduce the difficulty of finding vulnerabilities to exploit. Additionally, any inline configuration files (such as `.htaccess`) and secrets (such as API keys) within server-side code are also shared. In total, we found 189,400 `.htaccess` files on 4,500 servers and 10.2 million other server-side scripting source files on 32,000 servers.

### Responsible Devices

Our device fingerprints shed light on the sources of this sensitive information exposure. As shown in Table X, we determined that 12.3% of the devices exposing sensitive user information point to specific manufacturers and device models. The two major classes of devices are consumer NAS devices and consumer-grade "smart" routers.

#### Consumer NAS Devices

Personal/small-office Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices, which include 198,000 devices (18,000 with anonymous access), are one of the major classes. These devices, similar to USB external disk enclosures, contain one or more hard drives and connect to the network via Ethernet or WiFi.

User manuals for these devices often provide instructions on how to set up port forwarding or UPnP sharing, find the router's public IP address, and use Dynamic DNS providers. Many manuals lack warnings about the hazards of making a device accessible from the entire Internet. Even devices without anonymous access enabled are vulnerable to attackers guessing weak or default passwords.

#### Smart Routers

The second class of devices is "smart" home routers, which account for 59,900 devices (6,700 with anonymous access). These routers often include NAS-like functionality and can expose external USB drives over the network. Unlike NAS devices, home routers are typically on the edge of the userâ€™s network and do not require port forwarding to be accessible. Some routers, like ASUS, have automatically enabled anonymous access for attached USB drives, further lowering the bar for exposing user information.

### Malicious Use

We identified several malicious campaigns leveraging world-writable anonymous FTP to distribute malware, launch DDoS attacks, and carry out SEO campaigns. During our investigation, we downloaded a small number of files associated with malware for analysis. These files were hand-selected based on their frequent occurrence across diverse servers or their co-location with known malicious files.

#### World-writable Determination

To determine whether anonymous servers support file uploads, we looked at the attributes and behavior of writable servers. This set mainly consists of two types of files: those indicated by the server as having been uploaded anonymously and files that are part of write-probing campaigns. The three most pervasive probing campaigns upload files named `w0000000t.[txt/php]`, `sjutd.txt`, and `hello.world.txt`, each containing simple strings like "Anonymous" or "test".

This comprehensive analysis highlights the risks and vulnerabilities associated with the use of anonymous FTP servers and the need for better security practices and documentation.
