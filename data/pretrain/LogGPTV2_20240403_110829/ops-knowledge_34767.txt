User: How to write a simple web crawler program using Python?
Assistant: The steps to write a simple web crawler program in Python are roughly as follows: 1. Import the required modules and libraries. For example: `urllib`, `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, etc. 2. Determine the URL of the target website. For example: `https://www.example.com`. 3. Send a GET request and get the response result. Use .get() from the requests library or the urlopen() function from the urllib.request module. 4. Parse the response result and extract the required information. Use an HTML parser such as the BeautifulSoup library. 5. Do something with the extracted information, such as saving to file or exporting. 6. Set the relevant rules of the target website, such as login authentication, proxy access, etc. 7. Write exception handling code to avoid unexpected program termination. A simple web crawler sample code is as follows: ``` python import requests from bs4 import BeautifulSoup url = "https://www.example.com" response = requests.get(url) soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html .parser") text = soup.get_text() print(text) ``` This program uses the requests library to send GET requests, uses the BeautifulSoup library for HTML parsing, and outputs the extracted text information.
