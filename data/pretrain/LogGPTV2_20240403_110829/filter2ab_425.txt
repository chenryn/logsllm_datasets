### Title: Remote Memory-Deduplication Attacks at Black Hat Asia 2022

**Abstract:**

Cloud providers often employ memory deduplication to optimize the memory utilization of their systems. This technique involves merging memory pages with identical content and mapping them under a copy-on-write (COW) semantic. Previous research has demonstrated that local memory deduplication can be exploited to break Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), perform Rowhammer attacks, and fingerprint applications. As a result, countermeasures have been proposed to disable memory deduplication across security domains. However, memory deduplication is still enabled within a security domain on both Windows and Linux server systems.

In this presentation, we will introduce remote memory-deduplication attacks, showing that such attacks are not limited to local code execution but can also be performed over the internet. Specifically, we will demonstrate how web applications that use in-memory caching, such as Memcached, can be remotely exploited without any user interaction. An attacker can leverage this remote timing side channel to leak sensitive information, achieving up to 34.41 B/h of data leakage across the internet (even with 14 hops). We will also show how fingerprinting can be performed on operating systems and shared libraries. Our remote Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR) break can compromise KASLR on a remote server within minutes, using both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 protocols. By employing a leakage primitive to alter the alignment of attacker-controlled data, we enable byte-by-byte data leakage from MySQL database records.

We will evaluate current state-of-the-art mitigations and argue that some are insufficient to protect against remote memory-deduplication attacks. Finally, we will outline the challenges for future research in this area.

**Key Points:**
- **Memory Deduplication:** Merges identical memory pages under a COW semantic to reduce memory usage.
- **Local Exploits:** Previous work showed vulnerabilities like ASLR breaks, Rowhammer attacks, and application fingerprinting.
- **Remote Attacks:** Web applications using in-memory caching (e.g., Memcached) can be exploited remotely.
- **Data Leakage:** Up to 34.41 B/h of data can be leaked over the internet.
- **Fingerprinting:** Operating systems and shared libraries can be fingerprinted.
- **KASLR Break:** Remote KASLR can be broken within minutes via HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.
- **MySQL Data Leakage:** Byte-by-byte data leakage from MySQL database records.
- **Mitigations:** Evaluation of current mitigations and their limitations.
- **Future Research:** Challenges and directions for future research on remote memory-deduplication attacks.
