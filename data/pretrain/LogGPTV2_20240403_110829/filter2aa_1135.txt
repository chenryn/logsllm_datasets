How does content get from the broadcast location to 
my home?
Telstar 6
This section will describe, in detail, how content from CNN Headline News’ 
broadcast center gets to your home. This information is characteristic of 
how most channels are transmitted from the broadcast location, to the 
service provider, and then to the home user.

CNN uplinks (sends) their signal to the Telstar 6 satellite 
located at 93.0° West on Transponder 22. The location of 
a satellite is given in degrees away from the Greenwich 
meridian. 
This feed has a Symbol Rate of 4 MegaSymbols per 
second. The Forward Error Correction is set to ¾. This 
particular channel feed uses the PowerVu © encryption 
system.

93.0° West – This refers to the location from 
the Greenwich Meridian. There are only east 
and west coordinates for satellites (and no 
north/south coordinates) because all the major 
TV and Data satellites are at the equator in a 
geosynchronous orbit (they move around the 
earth at the same speed the earth moves, 
therefore appearing to be stationary).

CNN uplinks (sends) their signal to the Telstar 6 satellite 
located at 93.0° West on Transponder 22 which operates 
at a frequency of 12079 MHz with a Horizontal Polarity.

second. The Forward Error Correction is set to ¾. This

Transponder - A combination receiver, frequency 
converter, and transmitter package, physically part 
of a communications satellite. Communications 
satellites typically have between 12 and 24 onboard 
transponders.

CNN uplinks (sends) their signal to the Telstar 6 satellite 
located at 93.0° West on Transponder 22 which operates 
at a frequency of 12079 MHz with a Horizontal Polarity.
Vertical Polarity
Horizontal Polarity
Circular Polarization
The use of opposing polarities 
allows for more bandwidth on the 
satellite because the same 
frequency can be reused on a 
different polarity. 
Section 1: Satellite TV Terminology and Broadcast Diagram : Polarity
DBS services use Circular 
Polarization, while other 
satellite broadcasts on C-band 
and Ku-Band use horizontal 
and vertical polarity.

Symbol Rate – This is the “bit rate” of the 
transmission. As with most data transfer 
mediums, the receiver must know the rate at 
which the transmitter is sending information. 
CNN’s symbol rate corresponds with a 8Mb/s 
data rate. Most communications satellites have 
capacity for about 29Ks/s on a transponder.

FEC – Forward Error Correction. Satellite 
transponders are rather noisy communications 
channels are therefore subject to a large number 
of errors when a signal is sent through them. As a 
result, Forward Error Correction is used, where 
the transmitter sends error correction information 
along with the actual signal so that should errors 
occur, the receiver can re-generate the bit stream. 
A FEC of ¾ means that for every 3 bits of real 
data, there is 1 bit of error correction data.

Stream Encrypted
The stream is decrypted and decoded by the service 
provider’s equipment, where it is then re-encoded and 
multiplexed with other channels before being encrypted 
and up linked to the satellite that the home user points 
the dish at.

The information provided from this slide 
forward until the end of this section is DVB 
specific. Dish Network, Bell ExpressVu, 
and almost every European Satellite 
service uses the DVB standard for Video, 
Audio, and Data transmissions via satellite.

Section 2: DVB and Conditional Access
PCI DVB-S cards are able to receive and display DVB 
MPEG2 satellite signals, such as the FTA channels. 
With the appropriate hardware CAM module, they are 
also able to decode subscription TV-services that use 
the DVB standard.

Section 3: FTA (Free to Air)
FTA channels on C-Band and 
Ku-Band use Vertical and 
Horizontal Polarity instead of 
Circular Polarity which DBS 
systems use.
C-band Feeds (Pre-Air Primetime Network TV Shows)
Telstar 5
C-band reception requires at least a 7.5ft 
dish. Many feeds are available on c-band 
including feeds of TV shows before they 
air on the networks.
