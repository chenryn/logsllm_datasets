# Satellite TV Technology: How It Works and What You Can Do with Different Dishes

## Introduction
This document provides a detailed explanation of how satellite TV content is transmitted from the broadcast location to your home. We will use CNN Headline News as an example, but the process is characteristic of most channels.

## Section 1: Satellite TV Terminology and Broadcast Diagram

### Signal Information
- **Uplink**: CNN uplinks (sends) their signal to the Telstar 6 satellite located at 93.0° West on Transponder 22.
- **Satellite Location**: The location of a satellite is given in degrees away from the Greenwich Meridian. For example, 93.0° West means the satellite is 93.0 degrees west of the Greenwich Meridian.
- **Transponder**: A transponder is a combination receiver, frequency converter, and transmitter package, physically part of a communications satellite. Communications satellites typically have between 12 and 24 onboard transponders.
- **Frequency and Polarity**: The Telstar 6 satellite operates at a frequency of 12079 MHz with Horizontal Polarity.
- **Symbol Rate**: This feed has a Symbol Rate of 4 MegaSymbols per second, corresponding to a data rate of 8 Mb/s.
- **Forward Error Correction (FEC)**: The FEC is set to ¾, meaning for every 3 bits of real data, there is 1 bit of error correction data. This helps in re-generating the bit stream if errors occur during transmission.
- **Encryption**: The channel feed uses the PowerVu © encryption system.

### Clarke Belt
- **Clarke Belt**: This refers to the geosynchronous orbit where most major TV and Data satellites are located. Satellites in this orbit move around the Earth at the same speed as the Earth's rotation, making them appear stationary.
- **Polarity**: The use of opposing polarities (Horizontal and Vertical) allows for more bandwidth on the satellite because the same frequency can be reused on a different polarity. DBS services use Circular Polarization, while other satellite broadcasts on C-band and Ku-Band use horizontal and vertical polarity.

## Section 2: DVB and Conditional Access

### DVB Standard
- **DVB-S Cards**: PCI DVB-S cards can receive and display DVB MPEG2 satellite signals, such as Free-to-Air (FTA) channels. With the appropriate hardware CAM module, they can also decode subscription TV services that use the DVB standard.
- **Conditional Access Module (CAM)**: This module, along with a smart card, is used to decrypt and access encrypted content.
- **Service ID (SID), Video Packet Identifier (VPID), Audio Packet Identifier (APID)**: These identifiers are used to specify the service, video, and audio streams, respectively.

### Example: Echostar 7
- **Echostar 7** (119.0° West)
  - **Transponder**: 16
  - **Frequency**: 12.443 GHz (DBS Band)
  - **Symbol Rate**: 20000 Ks/s
  - **FEC**: 5/6
  - **SID**: 202
  - **VPID**: 4898
  - **APID**: 4899 (English)
  - **Encryption**: Nagravision ®

## Section 3: FTA (Free to Air) Channels

### FTA Channels
- **Polarity**: FTA channels on C-Band and Ku-Band use Vertical and Horizontal Polarity instead of Circular Polarity, which is used by DBS systems.
- **C-band Feeds**: C-band reception requires at least a 7.5ft dish. Many feeds, including pre-air primetime network TV shows, are available on C-band.

### Example: Telstar 5
- **Telstar 5** (97.0° West)
  - **Frequency**: 11749 MHz (Ku Band, Vertical Polarity)
  - **Channels**:
    - HomeSat 3 (SID: 7232)
    - HomeSat 4 (SID: 7232)
    - HomeSat 1 (SID: 7232)
    - HomeSat 2 (SID: 7232)
    - Skylink TV (SID: 20765)
    - NTD TV (SID: 20765)
    - TVI (Australia) (SID: 20765)
    - Melli TV (Persian/Iranian TV) (SID: 20765)
    - Rang-A-Rang TV (Vienna) (SID: 20765)
    - Jaam-e-Jam Network 2 (Iran) (SID: 20765)
    - Al-Alam News Channel Promo (SID: 20765)
    - Scriptures for America (SID: 20765)
    - The Overcomer (SID: 20765)
    - IRIB World Service Radio 1 (SID: 20765)
    - IRIB Arabic Radio (SID: 20765)
    - IRIB World Service Radio 3 (SID: 20765)
    - IRIB Radio 1 (SID: 20765)
    - Radio Quran (SID: 20765)
    - The Prayer Channel (SID: 20765)

## Section 4: C-Band and Pre-Air Information

### C-Band Feeds
- **Reception Requirements**: C-band reception requires at least a 7.5ft dish.
