When I make predictions on two samples, separately and appended to one
another, I get different results. For example, this is as simple as it get
(both X_train and y_train are pandas DataFrames):
    model = linear_model.LinearRegression(normalize=True)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
But when I predict, I get inconsistent results. Predicting for a and b
separately:
    mode.predict(a)
    --> array([[ -4.91992866e+19],
               [ -9.44975142e+18],
               [ -6.28885430e+19],
               [ -5.99072700e+19],
               [ -9.97222845e+19]])
    model.predict(b):
    --> array([[ 273408.]])
Predicting for the two together:
    model.predict(a.append(b))
    --> array([[  1.82526373e+17],
               [  1.82526373e+17],
               [  4.86912000e+05],
               [  2.41920000e+05],
               [ -1.45384048e+18],
               [  2.73408000e+05]])
Which is completely different, except for b, which is the same result. This
also seems to be model agnostic as far as I can tell (although all within
linear regression).
