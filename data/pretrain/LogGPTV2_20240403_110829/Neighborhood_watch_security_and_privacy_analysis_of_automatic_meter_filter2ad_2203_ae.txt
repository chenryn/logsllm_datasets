### Figure 15: An Example Deactivation Protocol for Disabling the PPJ Briefly for Meter Reading
This figure illustrates a deactivation protocol that temporarily disables the Privacy Preserving Jamming (PPJ) system to allow for meter reading. The protocol ensures that the PPJ is only disabled for the necessary duration, minimizing the risk of privacy breaches.

### NILM Algorithms and Their Applications
Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) systems monitor the total load at an electric meter to extract individual appliance profiles. NILM algorithms can be categorized into two main types based on the signatures they use: steady-state and transient [26]. Transient techniques require high-frequency measurements (e.g., Msps) [31, 32], while steady-state techniques utilize low-frequency measurements and perform edge detection to identify appliances [26, 33]. Recent work has explored power consumption in the frequency domain [34], enhancing the capabilities of traditional transient solutions by differentiating between similar appliances. We used prior work [26] to evaluate the privacy breach of Automated Meter Reading (AMR) meters.

### Consumer Privacy in Load Monitoring
Researchers have investigated privacy leakage through the use of NILM systems. Mikhail et al. [5] proposed a method to infer a resident’s activities from demand-response systems. They first employed an existing NILM algorithm to recognize the running time schedules of various appliances. Then, extraction routines were used to determine occupancy schedules, sleeping cycles, and other activities. In their earlier work [4], they examined the impact of sampling rate on the accuracy of personal activity inference, showing that even with a 20-minute time resolution, attackers could still achieve meaningful estimates of a user’s activities with 70% accuracy. Our work complements theirs by proposing several practical attacks on deployed electric meters (both visual and RF-based) for acquiring consumption data, which can serve as input for their study. To protect consumer privacy from load monitoring, a protection system called NILL was recently proposed [35]. This system uses an in-residence battery to mask the variance in load, countering potential invasions of privacy. We believe that our defense strategies against wireless attacks can complement NILL.

### Reverse Engineering and Security Loopholes
Researchers have used reverse engineering to uncover security loopholes in systems where designers attempted to secure the system by obscurity. Rouf et al. [36] used this methodology to discover security and privacy risks in tire pressure monitoring systems. Nohl et al. [37] used reverse engineering to reveal ciphers from a cryptographic RFID tag without known software or micro-code implementation. With some prior knowledge of the cipher, researchers used a black box approach [38, 39] for cryptanalysis. Bortolozzo et al. [40] used reverse engineering to extract sensitive cryptographic keys from commercially available tamper-resistant cryptographic security tokens by exploiting vulnerabilities in their RSA PKCS#11 based APIs.

### Attacks on Wireless Channels
Checkoway et al. [41] presented an analysis of vulnerabilities in automotive short-range (Bluetooth) and long-range (cellular) wireless communications. Francillon et al. [42] demonstrated relay attacks against keyless entry systems, and [43, 38, 44] also employed attacks on the RFID-based protocols used by engine immobilizers to identify the presence of an owner’s ignition key. Clark et al. [45] analyzed the security of P25 systems against both passive and active adversaries, showing that even when encryption is used, much of the basic metadata is sent in the clear and is directly available to a passive eavesdropper. The AMR systems studied in this paper differ in several aspects from previously studied systems.

### Defensive Jamming
Defensive jamming has been proposed to protect medical devices [46]. Although sharing similar concepts, AMR meters involve a different physical layer technology (frequency hopping), making jamming more challenging. Unlike prior work [46], our focus is to provide insights from both attack and defense perspectives.

### Conclusion
Automated Meter Reading (AMR) systems using low-power radio frequency (RF) communications have been widely deployed for automatically collecting utility consumption data. This work demonstrates that currently deployed AMR systems are vulnerable to spoofing attacks and privacy breaches. Despite the use of frequency hopping, we were able to reverse engineer the communication protocol and launch spoofing attacks against a representative meter reader. Surprisingly, we found that AMR meters broadcast readings every 30 seconds, regardless of whether any ‘drive-by’ or ‘walk-by’ meter readers are in range, and the communication range is larger than expected. Through wireless monitoring, we harvested consumption data from 485 meters within a 300-meter radius, indicating that millions of installed meters are at risk.

Several standard security remedies are available to address these vulnerabilities, but none are adopted in the deployed AMR meters we studied. Adding these remedies to existing meters requires upgrades, which may be costly. Alternatively, we propose a scheme called Privacy Preserving Jamming (PPJ), which uses jamming to protect against the leakage of legacy devices without modifying the deployed meters. Our pilot experiments offer a proof-of-concept that PPJ can prevent information leakage from AMR meters.
