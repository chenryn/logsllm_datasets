ABSTRACT 
As in the successful first edition, the second Workshop on Attacks 
and  Solutions  in  Hardware  Security  (ASHES)  2018  deals  with  all 
aspects  of  hardware  security.  Among  others,  this  year,  the 
workshop  particularly  highlights  emerging 
techniques  and 
methods as well as recent application areas within the field. These 
include  new  attack  vectors,  attack  countermeasures,  and  novel 
designs and implementations on the methodological side, as well 
as  the  Internet  of  Things,  automotive  security,  smart  homes, 
pervasive  and  wearable  computing  on  the  applications  side.    In 
order  to  meet  the  requirements  of  these  rapidly  developing 
subareas, ASHES calls for paper submissions in four categories: 1) 
classical full papers; 2) classical short papers; 3) systematization of 
knowledge  papers  which  overview,  structure,  and  categorize  a 
subarea;  and  4)  wild  and  crazy  papers  whose  purpose  is  rapid 
dissemination of promising, potentially game-changing ideas.

1  INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION 
Billions  of  hardware  devices  are  coming  online  to  form  the  so-
called  Internet  of  Things.  These  devices  have  the  potential  to 
improve our lives, but, if not properly protected, could also open 
us  to  novel  risks  and  vulnerabilities.  An  attack  on  such  a  large 
number  of  devices  could  have  catastrophic  effects  on  our

economies.  A clear example of the devastating consequences that 
such an attack can have, was evident in 2016 with the distributed 
denial-of-service attack made possible via the Mirai botnet.  In this 
case, much of the Internet in the US east coast was unavailable for 
almost an entire day. 
The security community has long recognized that many classical 
solutions  cannot  be  easily  applied  to  the  constrained  hardware 
devices  that  are  often  found  in  the  IoT  and  CPS  domains. 
However,  identifying  convincing  security  solutions  that  are 
appropriate  for  these  domains  remains  a  challenge.  The  main 
scientific challenges to be addressed are related to the fact that IoT 
and  CPS  devices  are  typically  extremely  constrained,  both  in 
computational resources and in cost, but they often need to meet 
the same security requirements as more powerful systems due to 
the  safety  and  time-critical  nature  of  the  applications  in  which 
they  are  deployed.  Furthermore,  their  applications  may  demand 
that the devices operate within environments that are untrusted in 
various  ways  that  may  open  them  up  to  attack.  Particularly 
pressing questions in this context include: 
  How can we get individual cryptographic keys into billions of 
low-cost hardware devices? 
  How can we securely identify low-cost hardware over digital 
channels, e.g., systems without digital signal processors or 
devices merely powered by scavenged energy? 
  How can we protect against tampering and side-channel 
attack in low-cost hardware?  
  How can we remotely verify the functionality and integrity 
of connected IoT-devices? 
  How can we establish the long-term confidentiality of 
communications with resource-constrained hardware? 
  How can we protect the IoT and its hardware against 
malware (viruses, Trojan horses, etc.) and network attacks? 
  How can we enable secure physical data storage in 
lightweight hardware systems?

  How can we preserve the privacy of users in pervasive IoT-
scenarios? 
This  workshop  aims  to  bring  together  the  CCS  and  hardware 
security  research  communities,  with  the  goal  of  identifying 
solutions for these and other problems in hardware and embedded 
systems  security.  The  peculiarity  of  the  IoT  and  CPS  application 
domains call for novel methods and solutions supporting hardware 
security. It is the hope of the organizers that, by bringing together 
these communities, the workshop will promote novel research in 
this domain.

3  PAPER CATEGORIES  
To  account  for  the  special  scope  of  the  workshop,  and  for  the 
particular  nature  of  hardware  security  as  a  rapidly  developing 
discipline, the workshop allows four different categories of paper 
submissions: 
Full papers,  with  up  to  10  pages  in  ACM  double  column 
format  (including  references  and  appendices),  and  a  25  min 
presentation timeslot at the workshop (including questions) 
Short papers,  with  up  to  6  pages  in  ACM  double  column 
format  (including  references  and  appendices),  and  a  15  min 
presentation timeslot at the workshop  
  Wild and Crazy (WaC) papers, with 3 to 6 pages in ACM 
double  column  format,  with  additional  appendices  and 
references of up to 6 pages, and 15 min presentation timeslot 
at the workshop (including questions). WaC papers are meant 
to  target  groundbreaking  new  methods  and  paradigms  for 
hardware security. Their focus lies on novelty and potential 
impact,  and  on  the  plausibility  of  their  argumentation,  but 
not  on  a  full  demonstration  or  complete  implementation  of 
their  ideas.  Wild  and  crazy  papers  must  bear  the  prefix 
“WaC:” in their title. 
format 
in  ACM  double  column 
Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers,  with  up  to 
12  pages 
(including 
appendices  and  references),  and  a  25  min  presentation 
timeslot  at  the  workshop.  SoK  papers  shall  evaluate, 
systematize,  and  contextualize  existing  knowledge.  They 
should serve the community by fostering and structuring the 
development  of  a  particular  subarea  within  hardware 
security.  Ideally,  but  not  necessarily,  they  might  provide  a 
new viewpoint on an established, important subarea, support 
or challenge long-standing beliefs with compelling evidence, 
or  present  a  convincing  new  taxonomy.  Systematization  of 
knowledge papers must bear the prefix “SoK:” in the title.
