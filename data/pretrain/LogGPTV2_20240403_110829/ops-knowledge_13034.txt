User: I want to load IPython shell (not IPython notebook) in which I can use PySpark through command line. Is that possible?
I have installed Spark-1.4.1.
Assistant: Tested with spark 3.0.1 and python 3.7.7 (with ipython/jupyter installed)
To start pyspark with IPython:
$ PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON=ipython pyspark
To start pyspark with jupyter notebook:
$ PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON=jupyter PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON_OPTS=notebook pyspark
