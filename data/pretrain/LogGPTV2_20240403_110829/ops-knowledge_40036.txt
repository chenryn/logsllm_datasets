User: How to deploy and manage servers in batches by using Ansible?
Assistant: To use Ansible to deploy and manage servers in batches, you can follow the steps below: 1. Install Ansible, you can install Ansible through the official website or by yourself. 2. Write the host list file between Ansible and specify the servers to be managed. 3. Write Ansible's Playbook file, including the tasks we want to perform. 4. To run the Ansible Playbook file, use the following command: ansible-playbook playbook.yml -i hosts. 5. When finished, Ansible will automatically run the tasks defined in the Playbook file and execute them on the server. The following is an example of using Ansible to deploy and manage servers in batches: 1. Install Ansible: To install Ansible on the Ubuntu operating system, you can use the following command: sudo apt update sudo apt install ansible After the installation is complete, you can use the following command to confirm whether the installation is complete Success: ansible --version 2. Write Ansible inventory files: In Ansible, we use inventory files to specify the servers to manage. Create a file called hosts that contains the IP addresses or domain names of all the servers you want to manage. For example: [WebServers] 192.168.1.100 192.168.1.101 [DatabaseServers] 192.168.1.102 3. Create an Ansible Playbook file: The Playbook file specifies the tasks to be executed. For example, the following is an example of a Playbook file that creates a new file in the /var/www/html/ directory: --- - hosts: WebServers tasks: - name: Create /var/www/html/newfile.txt become: yes file : path: /var/www/html/newfile.txt state: touch mode: '0644' - hosts: DatabaseServers tasks: - name: Install MySQL Server become: yes apt: name: mysql-server state: present 4. Run Ansible Playbook files: To run an Ansible Playbook file, use the following command: ansible-playbook playbook.yml -i hosts Ansible will then automatically log into the specified servers and execute the tasks defined in the Playbook file on each server.
