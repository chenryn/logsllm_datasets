**Applies to:**

- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2

**Description:**
The `clean` command removes all partitions and volume formatting from the disk that is currently in focus.

**Note:**
For a PowerShell equivalent of this command, refer to the `Clear-Disk` cmdlet.

**Syntax:**
```plaintext
clean [all]
```

**Parameters:**

- **all**: Specifies that every sector on the disk will be set to zero, effectively erasing all data on the disk.

**Remarks:**

- On Master Boot Record (MBR) disks, only the MBR partitioning information and hidden sector information are overwritten.
- On GUID Partition Table (GPT) disks, the GPT partitioning information, including the Protective MBR, is overwritten. There is no hidden sector information.

To use this command, you must first select a disk and shift the focus to it using the `select disk` command.

**Examples:**

To remove all formatting from the selected disk, type:
```plaintext
clean
```

To completely erase all data on the selected disk by setting every sector to zero, type:
```plaintext
clean all
```
