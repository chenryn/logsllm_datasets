security measures perceived as a “bolt-on” to existing
systems—especially if organizational leaders are not vo-
cal about their importance—may engender avoidance be-
haviors from users. Similarly, insufﬁcient attention by
system and security experts to the speciﬁc work needs
and task priorities of users may lead to brittle systems:
tools and protocols that do not offer multiple methods
for meeting a particular security requirement (e.g. text-
based communication), may lead users to rely on inse-
cure workarounds to meet their needs. This afﬁrms prior
work (e.g., [48, 55]) suggesting that ongoing attention to
both security and primary work objectives by organiza-
tional leaders and security experts is key to creating and
maintaining secure collaborative systems.
Opportunities for Future Work. Though our work has
identiﬁed multiple factors that may have contributed to
the effective security of the Panama Papers collaboration,
we do not know which of these factors were necessary,
nor which combination of them would have been sufﬁ-
cient. We also cannot tease out the importance of other
potentially relevant factors, such as whether the small
size of ICIJ itself helped facilitate organizational consen-
sus on security issues.
Two key directions for future work,
include
(1) conducting additional case studies of socio-technical
security successes and (2) comparing these case stud-
ies to clarify which factors are necessary and/or sufﬁ-
then,
cient. While our ﬁndings support prior work on the value
of social relationships for motivating security behaviors,
exploring other motivations (such as professional norms
or organizational identity) may highlight additional paths
towards similar types of security success.
6 Limitations
The Panama Papers project provides a remarkable exam-
ple of a diverse, highly-distributed group of journalists
meeting the security goals of the coordinating organi-
zation. However, we know that no system is perfectly
secure, and that even systems that appear to meet their
security goals may have been breached.
In this case,
a highly-motivated and/or -resourced attacker could—
without the organization’s awareness—have potentially
or actually compromised the systems we described here.
We do not claim causality, ultimate system security, or
lack of vulnerabilities, but rather identify factors that
may have contributed to the ICIJ’s success in achieving
their security goals (protecting the source and preserving
the secrecy of the project until the desired launch date)
in a complex socio-technical system.
Thus, the measures describes above should not be in-
terpreted as a guarantee of security or recipe for suc-
cess, nor a complete technical description of the systems
used.
Indeed, we highlighted several technical limita-
tions of the system and encourage readers to treat this
case study as a potential starting point from which to
incorporate other technical security best practices (e.g.,
mechanisms for detecting compromise or strengthening
endpoint security). We leave a technical analysis of these
still-evolving systems to future research.
Finally, because the survey instrument was designed
by ICIJ, we could not control what questions were asked
and how. We include the survey instrument in Ap-
pendix A for transparency.
7 Related Work
To the best of our knowledge, this paper represents one of
the ﬁrst in-depth studies of a security success story. Due
to the novelty of such a case study in the security litera-
ture, below we examine related work in adjacent ﬁelds.
7.1 Security for Journalists and Activists
Recent work has studied computer security for journal-
ists speciﬁcally, both individually [40, 44] and organiza-
tionally [45]. These works identiﬁed computer security
challenges due to, e.g., the fragility of journalists’ rela-
tionships with their sources, as well as the limited re-
sources available within journalistic organizations.
Like NGOs and activist groups,
journalists’ work
makes them high-value targets for cyberattack and
surveillance (e.g., [20]). Certain nation-states have been
known to monitor these groups and scan for evidence

of political dissent, by “eavesdropping, stealing informa-
tion, and/or unmasking anonymous users” [43]. In addi-
tion to surveillance, such groups have also been the tar-
get of malware attacks and tailored phishing attacks, on
which several case studies have been published [21, 39].
7.2 Security in Organizations
More generally, when considering computer security
within organizations or other networks, users are often
considered the “weakest link” [8]—a theme that has be-
come common in a range of ﬁelds (e.g., [26, 48, 50]).
Usability studies have begun to amend this assump-
tion, looking at how to strike the balance between secu-
rity and usability (e.g., [35]). Work in this ﬁeld shows
that users make decisions informed by a rational concern
for efﬁciency, so much so that many deliberately ignore
security advice and training [24, 25].
Scholars have found that organizational culture is
a critical component for the successful
implementa-
tion of security policy [58]. For example, Kirlappos
and Sasse [37] show that social relationships between
employees impact compliance with security mandates.
Blythe et al. [10] identiﬁed factors contributing to em-
ployees’ security behaviors, including security knowl-
edge and perceptions of responsibility. Thomson et
al. [55] highlight the importance of integrating security
awareness into an organization’s daily culture. Pﬂeeger
et al. [48] discuss the rollout of security mandates in the
context of employees’ mental workload and interaction
with their primary task ﬂow, All of these factors from
prior work—peer trust relationships, organizational se-
curity culture and norms, and integration with primary
tasks—are echoed in our ﬁndings.
Other ﬁelds,
including managerial and behavioral
studies as well as social psychology and sensemaking,
also consider the role of employee-culture in general
managerial compliance. Organizational culture, in par-
ticular, has been found to exert outsized inﬂuence on em-
ployee behavior [16, 22, 26, 34, 41, 48, 51, 53].
7.3 Security on Distributed Teams
As technology has enabled geographically distributed
teamwork, top-down management has given way to de-
centralization and ﬂat hierarchies [14] This change has
security implications:
top-down enforcement has been
shown to be less effective than socially embedded, trust-
based cultural compliance [37]. Moreover, top-down
mandates can actually lead to employees’ distrust of the
organization [59] or harm productivity [27]. Our ﬁndings
here—where security mandates were accepted and even
supported by journalist-contributors—suggest that this
distrust effect may be overcome by sufﬁciently strong so-
cial relationships and/or respect for the organization.
For digital rather than physical collaborations, com-
puter security becomes critically important, and knowl-
edge management in such teams is a topic of interest for
researchers [9, 11, 38, 47]. However, with some notable
exceptions [14, 33], the speciﬁc requirements of such
teams for security compliance are understudied. Our re-
search helps address this gap in the literature.
8 Conclusion
In this paper, we have explored a security success story:
the case of the year-long Panama Papers project collab-
oration among hundreds of journalists around the world.
We presented and analyzed survey data from 118 jour-
nalists involved with the project, as well as interviews
with the editorial and technical staff behind the design
and implementation of the collaboration tools used dur-
ing the project. From these datasets, we distilled success
factors and recommendations for designing and imple-
menting secure socio-technical systems.
We found that users will accept strict security require-
ments in order to use tools critical to their core (non-
security) efforts; that a strategy of reducing security de-
cisions by making secure behavior the default and pro-
viding secure alternatives for functionality not directly
supported may discourage insecure “workaround” be-
haviors; that leveraging peer relationships can help foster
a collaborative culture with a shared sense of security
responsibility; and that inviting—and engaging—input
from users helps establish a sense of reciprocity that fa-
cilitates their adoption of security mandates. This case
study demonstrates not only that meeting signiﬁcant se-
curity goals is possible in a complex socio-technical sys-
tem, but provides valuable insights into how similarly
successful future systems can be designed.
