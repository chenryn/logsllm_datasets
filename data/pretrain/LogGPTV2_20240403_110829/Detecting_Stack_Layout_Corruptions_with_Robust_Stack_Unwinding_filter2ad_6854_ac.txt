### Reason for Type A Errors in Large Programs

The occurrence of type A errors in large programs is primarily due to the pthread library. Despite these errors, our approach has not detected any violations of stack invariants, resulting in zero false positives.

### 6.3 Performance Analysis

We conducted a performance analysis to evaluate the runtime impact of SLIck on the protected programs from the previous evaluation. The overhead is influenced by the frequency of inspections and the depth of stack unwinding. SLIck is configured to scan the entire stack. To generate the workload, we used the Apache Bench with a load of one thousand requests for the Apache and Nginx web servers. The performance of the MySQL database and the 7zip tool was measured using their respective benchmarking suites. Additionally, the Nbench and SPEC 2006 benchmarks were executed under standard settings. The performance data from different types of benchmarks are normalized relative to native execution, which is set to 1. Our measurement results are presented in Figure 6, showing SLIckâ€™s performance under two inspection policies.

### Table 2: Stack Invariant Inspection of Benign Applications

No violations were detected in the following benign applications:
