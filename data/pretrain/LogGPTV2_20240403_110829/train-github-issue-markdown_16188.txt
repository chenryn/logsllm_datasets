##### Detailed description
I'm using a mouse callback on a window created with HighGUI in order to
retrieve the X/Y coordinates of the mouse pointer when the user click inside
the image. The returned coordinates are correct along the X axis, but off
along the Y axis. In particular, if I click at the top of the image (where the
Y coordinates should be 0), nothing happens. I have to click several pixels
below the top of the image (maybe 15-20 pixels) to get a response (0 instead
of 15-20). If I click at the very bottom of the image (where the Y coordinates
should be the height of the image), I get the correct response. It is like the
active part of the image (that is the one in which a click generates a
response) is compressed along the Y axis relative to the actual height
occupied by the image.
Note that this bug might be similar to #7485, but I wasn't certain of it.
##### Steps to reproduce
Below is the code I used.
    struct ClickData {
      int x;
      int y;
      int button;
    };
    void onMouse(int event, int x, int y, int flags, void* data) {
      ClickData* p = (ClickData*) data;
      if  (event == cv::EVENT_LBUTTONDOWN) {
        p->x = x;
        p->y = y;
        p->button = 0;
      } else if (event == cv::EVENT_RBUTTONDOWN) {
        p->x = x;
        p->y = y;
        p->button = 1;
      }
    }
    ClickData _click(std::string window_name) {
      ClickData d;
      d.button = -1;
      cv::setMouseCallback(window_name, onMouse, &d);
      while (d.button == -1) {
        cv::waitKey(10);
      }
      return d;
    }
