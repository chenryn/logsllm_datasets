any pair of SNP positions in the whole genome due to the
population’s genetic history. Because of LD, the content of
a SNP position can be inferred from the contents of other
SNP positions. The strength of the LD between two SNP
positions is usually represented by r2 (or D
), where r2 = 1
represents the strongest LD relationship.
2.2 Belief Propagation
(cid:48)
Belief propagation [37, 41] is a message-passing algorithm
for performing inference on graphical models (Bayesian net-
works, Markov random ﬁelds). It is typically used to com-
pute marginal distributions of unobserved variables condi-
tioned on observed ones. Computing marginal distributions
is hard in general as it might require summing over an ex-
ponentially large number of terms. The belief propagation
algorithm can be described in terms of operations on a factor
graph, a graphical model that is represented as a bipartite
graph. One of the two disjoint sets of the factor graph’s ver-
tices represents the (random) variables of interest, and the
second set represents the functions that factor the joint prob-
ability distribution (or global function) based on the depen-
dences between variables. An edge connects a variable node
to a factor node if and only if the variable is an argument of
the function corresponding to the factor node. The marginal
distribution of an unobserved variable can be exactly com-
puted by using the belief propagation algorithm if the factor
graph has no cycles. However, the algorithm is still well-
deﬁned and often gives good approximate results for factor
graphs with cycles. Belief propagation is commonly used in
artiﬁcial intelligence and information theory. It has demon-
strated empirical success in numerous applications including
LDPC codes [42], reputation management [11, 12], and rec-
ommender systems [10].
3. THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK
In this section, we formalize our approach and present
the diﬀerent components that will allow us to quantify kin
genomic privacy. Fig. 2 gives an overview of the framework.
In a nutshell, the goal of the adversary is to infer some
targeted SNPs of a member (or multiple members) of a tar-
geted family. We deﬁne F to be the set of family members
in the targeted family (whose family tree, showing the fa-
milial connections between the members, is denoted as GF)
and S to be the set of SNP IDs (i.e., positions on the DNA
sequence), where |F| = n and |S| = m. Note that the SNP
IDs are the same for all the members of the family. We

(i ∈ F), where xi
Furthermore, Xi = {xi
j : j ∈ S, i ∈ F} represents the set
of SNPs for individual i. We let X be the n × m matrix
that stores the values of the SNPs of all family members.
Some entries of X might be known by the adversary (the
observed genomic data of one or more family members) and
others might be unknown. We denote the set of SNPs from
X whose values are unknown as XU, and the set of SNPs
from X whose values are known (by the adversary) as XK.

inheritance probabilities (in Table 1), where (M, F, C) rep-

the individuals’ genomic and health privacy.

3.1 Adversary Model
An adversary is deﬁned by his objective(s), attack(s), and
knowledge. The objective of the adversary is to compute
the values of the targeted SNPs for one or more members of
a targeted family by using (i) the available genomic data of
one or more family members, (ii) the familial relationships
between the family members, (iii) the rules of reproduction
(in Section 2.1.2), (iv) the minor allele frequencies (MAFs)
of the nucleotides, and (v) the population LD values be-
tween the SNPs. We note that (i) and (ii) can be gathered
online from genome-sharing websites and OSNs, and (iii),
(iv), and (v) are publicly known information. Note that, in
the future, the increasing possibility to accurately sequence,
and to impute the actual haplotypes carried by an individ-
ual in each of the copies of the diploid genome will allow a
more accurate inference of relatives’ genotype than relying
on population LD patterns only.
Various attacks can be launched, depending on the adver-
sary’s interest. The adversary might want to infer one par-
ticular SNP of a speciﬁc individual (targeted-SNP-targeted-
relative attack) or one particular SNP of multiple relatives
in the targeted family (targeted-SNP-multiple-relatives at-
tack) by observing one or more other relatives’ SNP at the
same position. Furthermore, the adversary might also want
to infer multiple SNPs of the same individual (multiple-SNP-
targeted-relative attack) or multiple SNPs of multiple fam-
ily members (multiple-SNP-multiple-relatives attack) by ob-
serving SNPs at various positions of diﬀerent relatives. In
this paper, we propose an algorithm that implements the lat-
ter attack, from which any other attacks can be carried out.
We formulate this attack as a statistical inference problem.
3.2 Inference Attack
We formulate the reconstruction attack (on determining
the values of the targeted SNPs) as ﬁnding the marginal
probability distributions of unknown variables XU, given the
known values in XK, familial relationships, and the publicly
available statistical information. We represent the marginal
distribution of a SNP j for an individual i as p(xi
These marginal probability distributions could tradition-

ally be extracted from p(XU|XK,FR(xM
which is the joint probability distribution function of the
variables in XU, given the available side information and the
observed SNPs. Then, clearly, each marginal probability
distribution could be obtained as follows:

j. However, the number of terms in (1) grows expo-
nentially with the number of variables, making the compu-
tation infeasible considering the scale of the human genome
(which includes tens of million of SNPs). In the worst case,
the computation of the marginal probabilities has a com-
plexity of O(cid:0)3nm(cid:1). Thus, we propose to factorize the joint
probability distribution function into products of simpler lo-
cal functions, each of which depends on a subset of variables.
These local functions represent the conditional dependences
(due to LD and reproduction) between the diﬀerent variables
in X. Then, by running the belief propagation algorithm on
a factor graph, we can compute the marginal probability
distributions in linear complexity (with respect to nm).
A factor graph is a bipartite graph containing two sets
of nodes (corresponding to variables and factors) and edges
connecting these two sets. Following [37], we form a factor
j (j ∈ S
graph by setting a variable node for each SNP xi
and i ∈ F). We use two types of factor nodes: (i) famil-
ial factor node, representing the familial relationships and
reproduction, and (ii) LD factor node, representing the LD
relationships between the SNPs. We summarize the connec-
tions between the variable and factor nodes below (Fig. 3):
• Each variable node xi
j has its familial factor node f i

j (k (cid:54)= i) is

also connected to f i
j if k is the mother or father of i
(in GF). Thus, the maximum degree of a familial factor
node is 3.

and LD, the global distribution p(XU|XK,FR(xM

L,GF, P) can be factorized into products of several local
functions, each having a subset of variables from X as argu-
ments:

Next, we introduce the messages between the factor and
the variable nodes to compute the marginal probability dis-
tributions using belief propagation. We denote the messages
from the variable nodes to the factor nodes as µ. We also
denote the messages from familial factor nodes to variable
nodes as λ, and from LD factor nodes to variable nodes as

For the clarity of presentation, we choose a simple fam-

in Fig 3(a), and 3 SNPs (i.e., |F| = 3 and |S| = 3).
In
Fig. 3(c), we show how the trio and the SNPs are repre-
sented on a factor graph, where i = 1 represents the mother,
i = 2 represents the father, and i = 3 represents the child.
Furthermore, the 3 SNPs are represented as j = 1, j = 2,
and j = 3, respectively. We describe the message exchange
between the variable node representing the ﬁrst SNP of the
mother (x1
