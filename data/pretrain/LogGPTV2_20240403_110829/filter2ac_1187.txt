**ATT&CK ID:** T1046  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Network Service Discovery

Adversaries may attempt to enumerate services running on remote hosts and local network infrastructure devices, with the aim of identifying those that are potentially vulnerable to remote software exploitation. Common methods for acquiring this information include conducting port and vulnerability scans using tools that are either pre-installed or brought onto the system. These scans help adversaries identify open ports, active services, and potential security weaknesses, which can then be exploited to gain further access or control over the network.
