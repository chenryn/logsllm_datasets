Abstract 
Design  diversity  has  long  been  used  to  protect 
redundunt  systems  against  common-mode  failures.  The 
conventional  notion  of diversity  relies on  “independent” 
generation  of  “different”  implementations  of  the  same 
logic jimction.  This concept  is qualitative  and  does not 
provide  a basis to compcire the reliabilities of two diverse

quantiSy diversity  among several designs.  The problem of 
calculuting  the  diversity  metric  is NP-complete  and  ccin 
be  of  exponential  complexity. 
In  this paper,  we  present 
techniques  to  estinuite  the  value  of  the  design  diversitv 
metric.  For  datupcith designs,  we  have formulated  very 
fcist  techniques  to  calculate  the  value  of  the  metric  by 
exploiting  the regularity  in the datcipath structures.  For 
logic  circuits,  we  present  cin 
genercil  combinational 
adaptive Monte-Ccirlo simulation technique for estimuting 
bounds on the  value  of  the  metric.  The  adaptive  Monte- 
Curlo simulation technique provides accurate estimates of 
the  design  diversity  metric;  the  number  of  simulations 
used  to  reach  this  estimate  is  polynomial  (instead  of 
exponentid) in  the  number  of  circuit  inputs.  Moreover, 
the number of simulations ccin be tuned depending  on the 
desired accurricy. 
1.  Introduction 
Concurrent  Error  Detection  (CED)  techniques  are 
widely  used  for  designing  systems  with  high  data 
integrity.  A duplex system is an  example of  a  classical 
redundancy  scheme  that  has  been  used  in  the  past  for 
concurrent error detection.  There are many  examples of 
commercial  dependable  systems  from  companies  like 
Stratus and Sequoia using hardware duplication [Kraft 81, 
Pradhan  961.  Hardware duplication  is  also  used  in  the 
IBM G5 processor [Webb 97, Spainhower 991 and also in 
the space shuttle.  Figure 1.1 shows the basic structure of 
a duplex system. 
In  a duplex system there are  two modules (shown in 
Fig.  1.1 as  Module  1 and  Module 2)  that  implement the 
same  or  related 
logic  functions  (e.g.,  complement 
function).  The two implementations can  be  the  same or 
different.  A  comparator  is  used  to  check  whether  the

disagree, the  system  indicates  the  presence of  an  error. 
Duta  integrity  means  that  the  system  either  produces 
correct outputs or  generates  error  signal  when  incorrect 
outputs are produced.  For a duplex system, data integrity 
is  maintained  as  long  as  both  modules  do  not  produce 
identical erroneous outputs.

In  a  duplex  system  common-mode  failures  (CMFs) 
result  from failures  that  affect more  than  one element at 
the same time, generally due to a single cause [Lala 941. 
These  include  operational  failures  that  may  be  due  to 
external  (such  as  EMI,  power-supply  disturbances  and 
radiation) or internal causes and design faults.  Common- 
mode failures in redundant VLSI systems are surveyed in 
[Mitra OOa].  Design  diversity  has  been  proposed  in  the 
past to protect redundant  systems against common-mode 
failures.  In  [Avizienis 841,  design  diversity  was  defined 
as the “independent” generation of  two or more software 
or  hardware  elements  (e.g.,  program  modules,  VLSI 
circuit masks, etc.) to satisfy a given requirement.  Design 
diversity has been applied to both  software and hardware 
systems [Lyu 91, Briere 93, Riter 951.  Tohma proposed 
using the implementations of  logic functions in  true  and 
complemented  forms  during  duplication  [Tohma  711. 
The use  of  a particular  circuit  and its dual was proposed 
in  [Tamir  841  to  achieve  diversity  in  order  to  handle 
common-mode  failures.  The  basic  idea  is  that,  with 
different  implementations,  common  failure  modes  will 
probably cause different error effects. 
The above  discussion of  diversity is  qualitative and 
does not provide any quantitative insight into the design 
or the analysis of  systems using diverse duplication.  In a 
recent paper  [Mitra 99a],  we  developed a  metric  (called 
the D-metric) to quantify diversity amon2 several designs 
and  used  this  metric  to  perform  reliability  analysis  of 
redundant systems.  However, for  arbitrary  designs.  the 
problem  of  calculating  the  value of  the  D-metric is NP- 
complete.  In  this paper, we present several techniques to 
calculate  the  D-metric.  The  contributions of  this  paper

2. D: A Design Diversity Metric 
Assume  that  we  are  given  two  implementations 
(logic networks) of  a logic function, an  input probability 
distribution and faults fi and fi that  occur in  the first and 
the second implementations, respectively.  The diversity 
di,j with respect to the fuult pair (fi, 4) is the conditional 
probability that  the  two implementations do not produce 
identical errors,  given  that  faults fi and sj have  occurred

combination, the implementations can produce one of  the 
following  cases  at  their  outputs: 
(1)  Both  of  them 
produce  correct  outputs.  (2)  One  of  them  produces  the 
correct output and the other produces an incorrect output. 
(3) Both  of  them  produce  the  same  incorrect value.  (4) 
They produce non-identical incorrect outputs.

In 
For  the  first  case,  the  duplex  system  will  produce 
correct outputs.  For the second and the fourth  cases,  the 
system  will  report  a  mismatch  so  that  appropriate 
recovery  actions  can  be  taken.  However,  for  the  third 
case, the system will produce an incorrect output without 
reporting a mismatch --  thus,  for the  third case, the data 
integrity of the system is not preserved. 
For a given fault model,  the design diversity metric, 
D, of  two designs is  the  expected  value of  the  diversity 
with respect to different fault pairs.  Mathematically,  we

D  is  the  probability  that  the  two  implementations

only  input  combination for  which  both  implementations

aflecting  the  two  implementations,  we  define  ki,,  as  the 
number  of  input  patterns,  in  response  to  each of  which, 
both  the  implementations  produce  the  same  erroneous 
output pattern.  Now, we can use the same formulas as in 
the single output case.

For example, consider a combinational logic function 
with  two  inputs  and  two  outputs  (Table  2.1).  Suppose 
that  faults  fi  and  fj  affect  the  first  and  the  second 
implementations, respectively.  The responses of  the two 
implementations in the presence of the faults are shown in 
Table  2.1.  The faulty  output bits are highlighted  in  the 
third and fourth columns of Table 2.1.  It  is clear that ki,j 
= 2 (since the implementations produce identical errors in 
response to input combinations  10 and  11) and the value 
of d i j  is - = 0.5 .
