## Expected Behavior
Compiles without errors.
## Current Behavior
Compiles with the following errors:
> ERROR in /Users/radu/code/notes-react/node_modules/@types/material-
> ui/index.d.ts  
>  (18,23): error TS2688: Cannot find type definition file for 'react-addons-
> linked-state-mixin'.  
>  webpack: Failed to compile.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. `npm install --save typescript@2.5.3, material-ui@0.17.4, @types/PI:EMAIL`
  2. Build
## Context
I've also tried with different material-ui versions like 0.17/0.18/0.19, but I
get the same error.
The same project works fine with `typescript@2.3.4`, but fails with
`typescript@2.4.2`.
