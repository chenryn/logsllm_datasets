Figure 11b gives the results with propagation model change.
The model parameters are modiﬁed periodically during the
simulation. We can observe that the performance of CPVSAD
drops rapidly, while Voiceprint
immune to the
change. This is because CPVSAD should conduct the statis-
tical testing according to the predeﬁned model parameters. It
is hardly to get accurate results if the predeﬁned parameter
changes. However, Voiceprint does not rely on any propagation
models. Thus, it is widely applicable for different environ-
ments and complex conditions.

VI. FIELD TEST
In this section, we evaluate the performance of the proposed
Voiceprint in the real-world ﬁled test.

A. Experiment Setup
In this ﬁeld test, we use four vehicles equipped with DSRC
radios and embedded with the Voiceprint application. We
conduct a series of experiments under campus, rural area,
urban area and highway environments shown in Figure 12.
There are one malicious node (ID = 1) and three normal nodes
(IDs = 2, 3 and 4), and the malicious node generates two Sybil
nodes with two fake identities (IDs = 101 and 102). The setup
is same to the Figure 4 given in Section III-B Scenario 3.
Normal node 2 moves as close as possible to the malicious
node during the test. The initial transmitted powers of all
physical nodes (nodes 1-4) are 20dBm. The initial transmitted
powers of Sybil node 101 and 102 are 23dBm and 17dBm
respectively. The observation time is 20s and detection period
is 1min. Since there are only four vehicles in the network,
we just set the constant threshold to be 0.05046 at 4vhls/km
condition.
B. Results and Analysis
The durations of tests in different areas are 13min21s, 22min
40s, 34min46s and 11min12s respectively. Thus, the detections
are totally conducted 14, 23, 35 and 11 times in campus,
rural area, urban area and highway correspondingly. We store
all measured DTW distances comparing with the threshold.
Figure 13 plots the results recorded by the normal node 3.
Here, DTW(a, b) means the measured DTW distance of RSSI
time series received from the node a and the node b.
From the Figure 13, we can ﬁnd that the detection rate is
100% in all scenarios and the false positive rate is 0.95%. Only
one time the normal node 2 incorrectly detected as the Sybil
node. In order to ﬁnd out the cause of this false detection, we
check the GPS trace and further analyze statuses, distances
and speeds of all vehicles.
According to GPS traces of malicious node 1, normal node 2
and 3, we notice that all these nodes remain stationary without
mobility at this detection period. Based on the locations of
nodes on the map shown in Figure 14, we ﬁnd that the false
detection occurs at an intersection. The reasonable explanation
is that all vehicles stop at the intersection waiting for a red
light. The measured distances between each pair of nodes are
3.8m (node 1 and 2), 198.9m (node 1 and 3) and 195.2m
(node 2 and 3) respectively. Therefore, the normal node 3
cannot distinguish two RSSI time series from malicious node
1 and normal node 2 since all nodes remain stationary in this
detection period, which leads to very similar signal patterns
between node 1 and 2 (Notice that node 3 is very far away
from these two nodes, most of RSSI values are -95dBm which
reaches the RX Sensitivity of our radio).

400m), the total computing time is only about 630ms. This
time complexity is affordable for Sybil attack detection.
From the real-world experiments, we prove that the pro-
posed Voiceprint is suitable for different areas, especially in
the rural and highway environments where vehicles can keep
moving without long time stopping. Although, when vehicles
stay stationary during the detection period, it may result in
false alarms (some complex conditions in the urban area such
as red light and trafﬁc jam), Voiceprint is still an effective
method considering the cost, complexity and performance. We
suggest making a ﬁnal determination of the Sybil node after
several detection periods so as to reduce the false positive rate.
VII. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we proposed a RSSI-based detection method,
Voiceprint, against Sybil attack in VANETs. The motivation
of implement the Voiceprint is based on our observation that
the RSSI time series have very similar patterns between two
Sybil nodes. Voiceprint does not depend on any radio prop-
agation model that can widely suitable for various environ-
ments (model-free, widely applicable). In addition, it conducts
independent detection that does not require establishing the

trust relationship of neighboring nodes (trust relationship-
free, lightweight). Furthermore, Voiceprint does not need the
support of the centralized nodes such as base stations or RSUs
(infrastructure-free, full-distributed). The simulation and ﬁeld
test results illustrate the effectiveness of Voiceprint.
We will continue our work on several directions to extend
Voiceprint. First, comparing to some cooperative detection
methods, Voiceprint needs longer observation time to collect
more RSSI values since it only uses the local information.
As the maximum beacon rate of safety messages deﬁned in
DSRC on CCH is 10Hz, each vehicle can only receive at
most 10 packets, i.e., 10 RSSI values per second from one
neighboring vehicle. In future work, we will take the Service
Channel (SCH) into account. Since there is no strict restriction
of beacon rate for SCH, we can increase the beacon rate and
broadcast the samples from SCH. Second, as same as all RSSI-
based methods, Voiceprint cannot identify the malicious node
if it adopts power control. We will conduct more real-world
experiments in this condition to extract other features or other
measurable parameters to prevent the smart attack.
