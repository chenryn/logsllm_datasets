**ATT&CK ID:** T1583.004  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Server

Adversaries may acquire, lease, or rent physical servers to support their operations during both the targeting and post-compromise phases. These servers can be used for a variety of purposes, such as staging, launching, and executing attacks. During post-compromise activities, adversaries may use these servers for Command and Control (C2) operations. Additionally, web servers can be utilized to facilitate watering hole attacks, as seen in Drive-by Compromise scenarios, while email servers can be leveraged for Phishing campaigns. Instead of compromising third-party servers or using Virtual Private Servers (VPS), adversaries may choose to configure and operate their own servers to maintain greater control and reduce the risk of detection.
