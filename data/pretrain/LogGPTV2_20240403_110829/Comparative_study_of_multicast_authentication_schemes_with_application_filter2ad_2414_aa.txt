ABSTRACT
Multicasting refers to the transmission of a message to mul-
tiple receivers at the same time. To enable authentication of
sporadic multicast messages, a conventional digital signature
scheme is appropriate. To enable authentication of a mul-
ticast data stream, however, an authenticated multicast or
multicast authentication (MA) scheme is necessary. An MA
scheme can be constructed from a conventional digital sig-
nature scheme or a multiple-time signature (MTS) scheme.
A number of MTS-based MA schemes have been proposed
over the years. Here, we formally analyze four MA schemes,
namely BiBa, TV-HORS, SCU+ and TSV+. Among these
MA schemes, SCU+ is an MA scheme we constructed from
an MTS scheme designed for secure code update, and TSV+
is our patched version of TSV, an MA scheme which we show
to be vulnerable. Based on our simulation-validated analy-
sis, which complements and at places rectiﬁes or improves
existing analyses, we compare the schemes’ computational
and communication eﬃciencies relative to their security lev-
els. For numerical comparison of the schemes, we use pa-
rameters relevant for a smart (power) grid component called
wide-area measurement system. Our comparison shows that
TV-HORS, while algorithmically unsophisticated and not
the best performer in all categories, is the most balanced
performer. SCU+, TSV+ and by implication the schemes
from which they are extended do not oﬀer clear advantages
over BiBa, the oldest among the schemes.

INTRODUCTION
A multicast authentication (MA) scheme enables re-
ceivers of a multicast packet to authenticate the sender, and
ensures no entities besides the sender can send authenti-
cated packets to the multicast group. At the core of every
MA scheme, lies a signature scheme. Conventional digital
signature algorithms such as DSA and ECDSA (see FIPS
186-3) can sign a practically unlimited number of distinct
messages with a private key, but they have high computation
and memory requirements. The simplest digital signature-
based MA scheme appends a digital signature to every mul-
ticast message, which is ﬁne for sporadic multicast messages,
but computationally prohibitive for multicast data streams.
The latest research on digital signature-based MA scheme
focuses on signature amortization [27], i.e., spreading a sig-
nature across many packets such that signature veriﬁcation
cost is amortized and the loss of a small number of pack-
ets does not forestall the veriﬁcation of successfully received
packets. However, all signature amortization schemes re-
quire a number of packets to be assembled before their col-
lective signature can be veriﬁed, incurring a delay that can
be problematic for real-time applications.
Real-time requirements have been motivating investiga-
tion of multiple-time signature (MTS) schemes [22] for
multicast authentication. An MTS scheme can sign a ﬁxed
number of distinct messages using a public/private key pair.
Although they generally produce longer signatures, they have
287much lower computation and memory requirements than
conventional digital signature schemes. MTS-based MA sch-
emes are thus suitable for real-time systems, and one such
system is a smart grid component called wide-area mea-
surement system (WAMS), which in fact motivates this
work. A number of MTS-based MA schemes have been pro-
posed over the years, yet due to inadequate analysis, a sys-
tematic comparison of these schemes is lacking, preventing a
scientiﬁc approach to the selection of MA schemes for real-
time systems, including WAMS.
Our contributions include a rigorous, simulation-validated
analysis and a methodical comparison of four MTS-based
MA schemes, namely BiBa [20], TV-HORS [31], SCU+ and
TSV+ [13]. Among these MA schemes, SCU+ is an MA
scheme we constructed from an MTS scheme designed for
secure code update [29], and TSV+ [13] is a patched version
of Tunable Signing and Veriﬁcation (TSV) [15]. These MA
and MTS schemes are chosen because they are either highly
cited or tailored to smart grids. Our analysis ﬁlls the gaps
of, and at places rectiﬁes or improves existing analyses. Our
comparison shows that TV-HORS has the most balanced
computational and communication costs; and that contrary
to common perception, recent sophisticated designs do not
necessarily trump older over-criticized designs. Our work is
motivated by the need to ﬁnd an eﬃcient MA scheme for
the WAMS, and hence the parameters of our comparison
are tailored to the WAMS. However, our analysis is system-
independent, and the parameter values used for comparison
can be adapted to any other system. This work is meant
to serve as the ﬁrst step of an ongoing series of comparative
studies of MTS-based MA schemes.
This article is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses
related work. Section 3 lists the mathematical symbols and
notation used in this work. Section 4 presents an overview of
MA schemes. We present our analysis of BiBa, TV-HORS,
SCU+ and TSV+ in Section 5. In Sections 6 and 7, we in-
troduce the WAMS and compare the four schemes using pa-
rameter values relevant for the WAMS. Section 8 concludes
the paper.
2. RELATED WORK
Active research on wireless sensor networks for the past
decade can be said to have spurred interest in broadcast/
multicast authentication and therefore multiple-time signa-
ture (MTS) schemes. This is largely due to the resource
constraints on a typical sensor node that favor low compu-
tational complexity and small code size. Recently, smart
grid researchers are also turning to MTS schemes for real-
time multicast authentication.
It is well known that one-time signatures (a subset of MTS
schemes) were ﬁrst considered by Lamport [12]. Among
subsequent schemes that improve upon Lamport’s imprac-
tical construction, BiBa [20] counts as a benchmark for its
simple ingenuity. TESLA and its variant μTESLA [21] are
more lightweight than BiBa but the use of delayed signature
veriﬁcation in these schemes precludes them from real-time
multicast authentication. HORS [23] improves upon BiBa
by generating shorter signatures for the same security level,
and has inspired many variants (e.g., [14,19]) and extensions.
TV-HORS [31] is an extension of HORS to an MA scheme.
TSV [15] is both a variant and an extension of HORS, be-
cause it is both an MTS scheme and an MA scheme. TV-
HORS and TSV were both motivated by smart grid appli-
cations, making them ideal candidates for comparison here.
SCU [29] was designed for wireless sensor networks, and has
an interesting design, so including it in our comparison in-
troduces diversity. Using Katz’s taxonomy [10], all schemes
studied here are chain-based stateful schemes. As Steinwadt
et al. [25] noted, naming a single superior MTS scheme (and
accordingly, MA scheme) is nontrivial.
In the following, we discuss related work in the context of
the wide-area measurement system (WAMS). In the North
American SynchroPhasor Initiative (NASPI), data multicas-
ting from a phasor measurement unit (a WAMS node) to
multiple control centers is seen as a necessity. Bobba et
al. [3] proposed a Policy-Based Encryption System (PBES)
to secure sharing of data, including WAMS data, between
utilities. PBES was not designed for securing WAMS traﬃc
itself. NASPI has yet to standardize on an MA scheme for
the purpose.
IEC 61850 is a series of standards on substation automa-
tion, i.e., the automation of data acquisition, control, pro-
tection, diagnostics and monitoring functions within sub-
stations (where most WAMS nodes are located). As part of
the series, IEC 61850-90-5 governs the IEC 61850-compliant
transmission of IEEE C37.118-formatted WAMS data. The
standard speciﬁes Group Domain of Interpretation (GDOI,
see RFC 6407) for securing the distribution of group keys,
and IPsec (see RFC 4301) for securing IP multicast using
the group keys. However, GDOI does not support mutual
authentication among group members [17, Section 4.3]. Fur-
thermore, IPsec relies on a shared group key for encryption,
which can be abused by a rogue member to forge messages
to the whole group (see RFC 5374). Zhang and Gunter [33]
proposed using IPsec for securing multicast WAMS data,
but did not point out the pitfalls as we do here.
Researchers at the Future Renewable Electric Energy De-
livery and Management (FREEDM) Systems Center imple-
mented TV-HORS on their testbed [32], but did not provide
the elaborate justiﬁcation we provide here.
Recently, Law et al. [13] proposed a key management
scheme for the WAMS that speciﬁes TV-HORS for secur-
ing multicast data streams. Their choice is based on a
simulation-based comparison between TV-HORS and TSV+.
Our comparison here covers more schemes, and is both an-
alytical and empirical.
Within the wireless sensor network community, several
studies have been performed to evaluate the eﬃciency of
various signature schemes. For example, Seys and Preneel
[24] compared the energy-eﬃciency of ECDSA, Lamport-
Diﬃe and HORS one-time signature schemes. Their results
show that for less than 15000 signatures, HORS is the most
energy-eﬃcient, whereas for more than 15000 signatures,
Lamport-Diﬃe is better.

4. MULTICAST AUTHENTICATION USING
MULTIPLE-TIME SIGNATURE SCHEMES
Most MTS schemes can be divided into the following parts:
• a private key tuple (s1, s2, . . . , st) consisting of t ﬁxed-
length random strings;
• a key generation algorithm for generating a public key
tuple from a private key tuple;
• a signature generation algorithm that, based on the
message to be signed, selects elements of a private key,
and generate signature elements from the selected pri-
vate key elements;
• a signature veriﬁcation algorithm that checks if the
public key elements can be derived from the received
signature elements.
Constructing an MA scheme from an MTS scheme requires
two key “ingredients”. The ﬁrst ingredient is one-way
chains. Since a key pair can generate only a ﬁxed number of
signatures, to sign a message stream of unlimited length, the
key pair must be refreshed once its usage limit is reached.
The de facto standard technique is to use the private key of
an expired key pair as the public key of a new key pair. In
the case of BiBa, this means generating the one-way chain
as si,λ, si,λ −1, . . . , si,0, where si,j−1 = H (si,j ),∀i = 1, . . . , t
and j = 1, . . . , λ. As such, si,j is both the private key el-
ement corresponding to public key element si,j−1, and the
public key element corresponding to the private key element
si,j+1 (see Fig. 1). Since this technique requires a private key
to have the same number of elements as the corresponding
public key, this technique does not apply to tree-based MTS
schemes (e.g., [11]). The second ingredient is clock/time
synchronization, which is essential for the security of MTS-
based MA schemes, as explained in Fig. 1.
In a smart
grid, this requirement is satisﬁable by the draft standard
IEEE PC37.238, which speciﬁes a common proﬁle for the
use of IEEE 1588-2008 Precision Time Protocol in power
system protection, control, automation and data commu-
nication applications utilizing an Ethernet communications
architecture.

Figure 1: Some (not all) private key elements are
disclosed for each signature generated. However, as
time passes, an attacker can capture enough signa-
tures (in this example, the “thick boxes”) to recon-
struct the whole s1,1, s2,1, . . . , st,1. It is therefore nec-
essary to deprecate private keys by (i) dividing time
into epochs, (ii) keeping track of the active private
key corresponding to the current epoch, and (iii)
synchronizing the clocks of the sender and receivers.
In the approach depicted in Fig. 1, during epoch j, the
active private key elements are s1,j, . . . , st,j. We call this
approach uniform chain traversal. Using uniform chain
traversal, in the ﬁrst epoch, when a signature containing
si1,1, si2,1, . . . , sik,1 is received, H is invoked k times to check
?
= si2,0, and so on. Assume every
H (si1,1)
private key is used to generate only one signature. In the
second epoch, suppose a signature containing sj1,2, sj2,2, . . . ,
sjk ,2 is received, and {i1, . . . , ik} ∩ {j1, . . . , jk} = ∅. This
?
= si1,0, H (si2,1)
?
= sj1,0, H 2(sj2,2)
time, H would have to be invoked 2k times to check
?
H 2(sj1,2)
= sj2,0, and so on. Therefore, in
uniform chain traversal, the veriﬁcation cost, i.e., expected
number of hash operations for verifying a signature, varies
from signature to signature.
An alternative approach, which we call nonuniform ch-
ain traversal, is meant to ensure the veriﬁcation cost stays
at a minimum from signature to signature. Using nonuni-
form chain traversal, the ﬁrst active private key is s1,1, s2,1,
. . . , st,1. Without loss of generality, suppose s1,1, s2,1, . . . ,
sk,1 have been used for a signature, the active private key
now becomes s1,2, s2,2, . . . , sk,2, sk+1,1, . . . , st,1. As explained
in Fig. 1, it is essential that receivers keep track of the ac-
tive private key, but the loss of synchrony between the epoch
counter and the key-chain indices of the active private key
means time can no longer be used as a reference. The sender
can disclose the key-chain indices of the active private key
with every signature, but by blocking packets to a receiver,
an attacker can cause a receiver to lose track of the current
active private key. Once the attacker has collected enough
signatures, it will be able to forge packets to the receiver. In
order to keep the veriﬁcation cost at a minimum for every
signature, nonuniform chain traversal inadvertently compro-
mises the receivers’ ability to track the active private key and
exposes them to signature forgery. Therefore in comparison,
uniform chain traversal is more robust and is adopted for all
MA schemes in this paper, at the expense of higher veriﬁca-
tion cost.
The discussion above glosses over a particular caveat of
one-way chains. If H is to be k-wise independent (see Deﬁ-
nition 2), following Bradford et al.’s analysis [4], the size of
289the domain of H must be Ω((λ +1)
), where λ +1 is the
length of the one-way chain. There are many ways to expand
the domain of H (below, si,λ is randomized, i = 1, . . . , t,
j = 1, . . . , λ):
(cid:3)k/2(cid:4)
1. Use a separate salt chain Kj−1 = PRF(Kj , 0), and set
si,j−1 = PRF(si,j, Ki,j), ∀j = 2, . . . , λ [20].
2. Use a separate salt chain Kj−1 = H (Kj), and set
si,j−1 = H (si,j(cid:9)Kj) [31].
3. Use a synchronized counter cj , e.g., the epoch counter,
and set si,j−1 = H (si,j(cid:9)cj ) [5].
4. Set si,j−1 = H (si,j(cid:9)si,j+1), si,λ −1 = H (si,λ) [5].
Above, note that replacing PRF(K, M ) with H (K(cid:9)M ) is
valid provided H can be modelled as a random oracle [2].
The performance of an MA scheme is evaluated in terms
of the computational complexity of signature generation and
signature veriﬁcation (Cσ and Cv ), and in terms of communi-
cation overhead (Lσ). However, these performance metrics
are only meaningful with respect to the achievable security
level (S ). In other words, we are interested in how MA sch-
emes compare with each other in terms of (i) Lσ / S , (ii)
Cσ / S , and (iii) Cv / S . The lower an MA scheme scores
