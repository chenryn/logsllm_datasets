software from Innowireless. These media channel characteristics
represent bearer information set by operators as well as the QoS
parameter for bandwidth designated in the body of an INVITE
message.
When a mobile device establishes a media channel, the network
sends a request for bearer creation with QoS information. We ana-
lyzed this request and extracted bandwidth, latency, and loss rate
for the media channel. However, some operators do not specify
this information in the message. In this case, we use the QoS class
identiﬁer (QCI) value in the message to identify the channel charac-
teristics, as described in [1]. In most operators, as shown in Table 2,
the bandwidth speciﬁed in the bearer request is different from the
INVITE message.
4.2.2 Hidden Data Channel Measurements
We measured the network performance with the sending and re-
ceiving modules for the hidden data channel. The experiment was
conducted on the same ﬁve operators as in §3. The feasibility of
accounting bypass in each hidden data channel is shown in Ta-
ble 3. The table indicates that if we can send data through a certain
channel, it is not charged. In the case of SIP tunneling and RTP
tunneling, all operators are open to free data transfer. However, the

result of direct communication is different among operators. In case
of US-1, for example, phone-to-phone communication is available
while phone-to-internet access is prohibited. The triangle mark in
KR-3 means that a free data channel is available for IPv4, but not
for IPv6. Since direct communication originates from implementa-
tion ﬂaws or P-GW blocking policy, it can vary among operators.
Through a feasibility analysis, we found that phone-to-phone direct
communication is available for operators that do not have a media
proxy.
We also measured the actual network performance for each oper-
ators, which includes throughput, latency, and loss rate, as shown in
Table 4. While the information of network performance is included
in the bearer creation request, we conducted this experiment to de-
rive the actual performance. Since transferred data are wrapped with
a RTP header upon UDP, we added an additional header containing
an identiﬁer, sequence number, and timestamp. To measure through-
put, we calculated received packet bytes per unit time. For latency,
the receiver computes the time difference and delay with the ﬁrst
two packets to sync its time with the sender.
Note that in our hidden data channel, we can send data as fast
as possible. However, since the bandwidth is limited, more packets
will be dropped when we increase the throughput. Therefore, by
ﬁtting the loss rate to 1% (i.e. using the same loss rate as in Table 2)
by delaying or varying the payload size, we can obtain the actual
throughput.
For the experiment, we sent 200,000 packets and averaged the
results. Since multiple SIP messages can damage SIP servers in the
IMS network, we did not measure the performance for SIP tunneling.
As can be seen in Table 4, the results are different from the media
channel characteristics in §4.2.1. The discrepancy may originate
from several factors: number of users, cellular network status, or
signal strength to the cell tower.
We also measured the performance of direct communication:
phone-to-phone and phone-to-internet. The best result of phone-
to-phone communication was 16.84 Mbps in one of the Korean
operators. In the case of phone-to-internet, the best result was 21.55
Mbps for the same operator. This high throughput comes from
the bandwidth of the default bearer for VoLTE signaling being
conﬁgured in the same manner as the default bearer for the data
service. However, as described in §2.2, data transmission through
the default bearer for VoLTE signaling has the highest priority.
Therefore, if a malicious user utilizes the VoLTE default bearer
for data transmission, she will be guaranteed higher performance
than normal users.
5 Exploiting VoLTE Mis-implementation
In §3.3, we described several security problems that an adversary can
exploit to carry out malicious behaviors/activities. In this section, we
discuss possible attacks that could be exploited using the discovered
vulnerabilities. Table 5 describes the vulnerabilities with possible
attacks and discusses if they are exploitable in each operator.
5.1 Permission Model Mismatch
In our experiment, an application with only Internet access permis-
sion can make a call. In addition, this calling activity is not displayed
on the screen; thus, a user may not know that her device was making
a call. Consequently, if a malicious application is installed on a
victim’s device, an adversary can conduct a couple of attacks by
exploiting this vulnerability.
Denial of Service on Call is an easy way to block a victim’s phone.
With a malicious application installed on the victim’s phone, an
attacker can cause the phone to make calls to designated number(s)
repeatedly. This activity would result in the victim not being able
to receive any incoming calls. Furthermore, because the call is not
displayed on the screen, the victim would not be cognizant that her
phone is in a calling state. Therefore, this can cause denial of service
on calls to the victim.
Overbilling is another powerful attack. If a malicious application
installed on a victim’s phone can send an INVITE message that
initiates an expensive video call, severe overbilling of the victim can
occur.
The permission model mismatch problem shows that the cur-
rent permission model used by mobile phones cannot handle the
All-IP environment properly. In the case of 3G networks using a
circuit-switching network for voice calls, call permission and data
permission are completely separated.
5.2 Direct Communication
Direct communication is an implementation problem originating
from the policy conﬁgured in P-GW. Even though direct phone-
to-phone communication should be blocked because it can allow
attacks such as overbilling attacks, some operators do not prevent
this access in VoLTE.
Free Video Call is a useful application of direct communication.
Because direct phone-to-phone communication bypasses the IMS
network, and only goes through P-GW, one can directly send an
INVITE message for a video call to another party. On the callee’s
side, the phone only replies to the source IP address of the received
INVITE, and no SIP server is involved in the procedure. Further,
because all accounting related to VoLTE calls is handled in the
IMS network, by using this method one can talk to others without
being charged. One requirement is that the sender has to open a
microphone, but this does not pose a difﬁculty because the user
can simply root the phone. In the case of Korea, video calls from
operators cost 1.66 times the price of a voice call. In the case of the
U.S., the operators charge for both data and voice.
Caller Spooﬁng is a severe issue related to direct communication.
Because packets are only routed through P-GW, there is no authenti-
cation between the caller and the callee. Accordingly, one can send a
manipulated INVITE to spoof the victim. If the adversary modiﬁes
the phone number in the INVITE, the modiﬁed number will be on
the screen of the victim’s phone. Therefore, the victim would be-
lieve that the call is from that number. As a result, an adversary can
exploit direct phone-to-phone communication for voice phishing by
simply changing a few bytes in the INVITE.
5.3 Lack of Authentication
Absence of authentication is one of the three threats originating
from mis-implementation of the IMS network.
Caller Spooﬁng is also feasible even when SIP messages go
through SIP servers. When an adversary generates a modiﬁed IN-
VITE message and sends it to the SIP server, if the SIP server only
checks if the phone number is valid, the server is vulnerable to caller
spooﬁng. When this is successful, it can also cause a calling fee to
be imposed on the person who owns the modiﬁed phone number.

Therefore, this attack can be considered a simple yet powerful attack.
In fact, not only INVITE, but also a BYE message can be used for
caller spooﬁng. If operators do not properly authenticate users, BYE
messages can be transmitted to terminate the victim’s on-going call.
We found that two operators in Korea are vulnerable to caller
spooﬁng. Other operators prevent spooﬁng using either of the fol-
lowing two methods: verifying the caller’s phone number with the
IP address or with International Mobile Station Equipment Identity
(IMEI), a unique identiﬁer for mobile devices.
5.4 Lack of Session Management
Absence of session management is another issue of the IMS network.
Since some operators do not manage call sessions, one can send
multiple INVITE messages to the SIP server.
Denial of Service on Core network is a possible attack in this case.
When the SIP server receives an INVITE message, it should open
a session for each message and manage each session independently.
If the number of INVITEs are too large, this can damage the SIP
server and paralyze the IMS network for VoLTE service.
In general, a user can only call once at a time with the native
calling app in the mobile phone. However, with our sending mod-
ule, we can transmit virtually an unlimited number of INVITE
messages. In our analysis, if UE-A sends INVITE, the dedicated
bearers among UE-A, the P-GW, and UE-B are all established, even
when UE-B does not answer the call. Since the cost of the bearer
activation and release procedure is expensive among control-plane
procedures, multiple INVITEs can overload the P-GW, causing a
denial of service on the core network.
We conducted our experiment only sending 2-4 INVITE mes-
sages, and checked whether a call session for each message is cre-
ated. We found that except for one operator in Korea, all the other
operators in the experiment are vulnerable. The most important as-
pect of our attack is that we can commit a denial of service attack
with only one mobile device whereas such an attack usually requires
a huge number of bots. Of course, we were not able to verify the
cost of each bearer in the operator, or whether this attack actually
shuts down the SIP server.
Cellular P2P is a more complicated application but is still feasible.
Since there is no session management, users can send multiple
INVITE messages to create several call sessions. When multiple
call sessions are established among users, people can share ﬁles
as torrents through RTP tunneling. Even though the 1% loss rate
is high, we can utilize the reliable UDP protocol, as in [9]. The
throughput is adequate and there is still enough speed to transfer
ﬁles as a torrent because there are many peers in the cellular network,
and these peers do not usually shutdown their phones. Therefore,
people can share movies or other content when they are sleeping.
If implementation is seriously concerned, Cellular Tor can also be
available to evade censorship on the cellular networks.
6 Countermeasures
In this section, we discuss solutions for both free hidden channels
and VoLTE service abuse attacks. Since these solutions are quite
intuitive, they can be easily applied to the commercial cellular net-
works. Some attack vectors originate from mis-implementation of
operators, while others are derived from fundamental problems of
the VoLTE system. These fundamental problems are more difﬁcult
to obviate than the other attacks. To prevent these attacks, we sug-
gest more difﬁcult yet comprehensive solutions for securing the
overall VoLTE service.
6.1 Immediate Solution
Filtering. The main cause of direct communication is inappropriate
access control of user-initiated requests at P-GWs in cellular net-
works. The purpose of the VoLTE default bearer is call signaling;
therefore, the P-GW should ﬁlter out all other packets except SIP
messages. In our analysis, however, some operators do not follow
the standard for call related services. For example, one operator in
Korea provides conference calls using their proprietary protocols on
top of HTTP although an IETF standard [21] provides a conference
call solution using the SIP protocol. This inconsistency of service
implementation can create difﬁculties in correctly managing the
access control in the P-GW.
In addition, operators should block all packets travelling directly
from a UE to another UE, and only allow packets from UEs to
the SIP server/media proxies, and vice versa. As a result, free data
channels as well as free video calls and caller spooﬁng could be
blocked.
Strict Session Management. This is another requirement for secur-
ing VoLTE. SIP tunneling, denial of service, and cellular p2p are all
possible attacks resulting from the absence of session management.
If a SIP server carefully inspects SIP messages originating from
UEs, it can block SIP tunneling. For example, it can check whether
an invalid ﬁeld or content exist in the header and the payload. If the
result of the check is unsatisfactory, it should reject the requests and
