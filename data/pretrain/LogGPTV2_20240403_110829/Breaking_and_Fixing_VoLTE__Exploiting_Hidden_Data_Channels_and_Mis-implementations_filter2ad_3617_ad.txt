**Note:** The triangle (△) in KR-3 indicates that a free data channel is available for IPv4 but not for IPv6.

### Media Channel Characteristics and QoS Parameters

The media channel characteristics, such as the bearer information set by operators and the Quality of Service (QoS) parameters for bandwidth, are specified in the body of an INVITE message. When a mobile device establishes a media channel, the network sends a request for bearer creation with QoS information. We analyzed this request to extract bandwidth, latency, and loss rate for the media channel. However, some operators do not specify this information in the message. In such cases, we used the QoS Class Identifier (QCI) value in the message to identify the channel characteristics, as described in [1]. As shown in Table 2, the bandwidth specified in the bearer request often differs from that in the INVITE message.

### 4.2.2 Hidden Data Channel Measurements

We conducted experiments to measure the network performance of hidden data channels using sending and receiving modules. The feasibility of accounting bypass in each hidden data channel is summarized in Table 3. The table indicates that if data can be sent through a certain channel, it is not charged. For SIP tunneling and RTP tunneling, all operators allow free data transfer. However, the results for direct communication vary among operators. For example, in US-1, phone-to-phone communication is available, but phone-to-internet access is prohibited. The triangle mark in KR-3 means that a free data channel is available for IPv4 but not for IPv6. Direct communication issues arise from implementation flaws or P-GW blocking policies, which can differ among operators. Our analysis found that phone-to-phone direct communication is available for operators without a media proxy.

### Table 4: Measurement Results of RTP Tunneling in Each Target Operator

| Operator | Throughput (Kbps) | Latency (sec) | Loss Rate (%) |
|----------|------------------|---------------|---------------|
| US-1     | 37.90            | 0.77          | 0.02          |
| US-2     | 36.93            | 0.52          | 0.00          |
| KR-1     | 45.76            | 1.44          | 39.00         |
| KR-2     | 0.10             | 0.32          | 0.65          |
| KR-3     | 50.48            | 0.30          | 0.73          |

To measure actual network performance, including throughput, latency, and loss rate, we conducted experiments. Although the bearer creation request includes network performance information, we aimed to derive the actual performance. Transferred data were wrapped with an RTP header over UDP, and we added an additional header containing an identifier, sequence number, and timestamp. Throughput was calculated by measuring received packet bytes per unit time, and latency was computed by the receiver using the first two packets to sync its time with the sender.

In our hidden data channel, data can be sent as fast as possible, but since bandwidth is limited, more packets will be dropped when throughput increases. By fitting the loss rate to 1% (as in Table 2) by delaying or varying the payload size, we obtained the actual throughput. For the experiment, we sent 200,000 packets and averaged the results. Since multiple SIP messages can damage SIP servers in the IMS network, we did not measure the performance for SIP tunneling. The results in Table 4 differ from the media channel characteristics in §4.2.1, possibly due to factors such as the number of users, cellular network status, or signal strength to the cell tower.

### 5. Exploiting VoLTE Mis-implementation

In §3.3, we described several security vulnerabilities that adversaries can exploit. This section discusses possible attacks using these vulnerabilities. Table 5 summarizes the vulnerabilities and potential attacks in each operator.

#### 5.1 Permission Model Mismatch

Our experiment revealed that an application with only internet access permission can make calls, and this activity is not displayed on the screen. If a malicious application is installed on a victim's device, an adversary can conduct several attacks:

- **Denial of Service on Call:** A malicious application can repeatedly call designated numbers, preventing the victim from receiving incoming calls.
- **Overbilling:** A malicious application can initiate expensive video calls, leading to severe overbilling for the victim.

This mismatch shows that the current permission model in mobile phones is inadequate for the All-IP environment. In 3G networks, call and data permissions are completely separated.

#### 5.2 Direct Communication

Direct communication is an implementation issue originating from P-GW policy. Some operators do not block direct phone-to-phone communication, which can lead to attacks like overbilling.

- **Free Video Call:** Direct communication bypasses the IMS network, allowing free video calls by directly sending an INVITE message.
- **Caller Spoofing:** Packets routed through P-GW lack authentication, enabling an adversary to spoof the caller's number.

#### 5.3 Lack of Authentication

The absence of authentication in the IMS network allows caller spoofing. An adversary can modify the INVITE message, causing the SIP server to impose calling fees on the owner of the modified phone number.

#### 5.4 Lack of Session Management

Some operators do not manage call sessions, allowing multiple INVITE messages to be sent to the SIP server.

- **Denial of Service on Core Network:** Sending multiple INVITE messages can overload the SIP server and paralyze the IMS network.
- **Cellular P2P:** Users can create multiple call sessions to share files as torrents through RTP tunneling, even with a high loss rate.

### 6. Countermeasures

To address both free hidden channels and VoLTE service abuse, we propose the following solutions:

#### 6.1 Immediate Solutions

- **Filtering:** P-GWs should filter out all non-SIP messages and block direct UE-to-UE communication.
- **Strict Session Management:** SIP servers should inspect SIP messages to block tunneling and manage sessions effectively.

These solutions can be easily applied to commercial cellular networks to enhance security.
