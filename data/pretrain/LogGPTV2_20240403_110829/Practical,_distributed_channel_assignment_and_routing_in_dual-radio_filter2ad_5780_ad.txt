conﬁguration (3.8 Mbps). Since most gateway paths con-
sist of only 1 or 2 hops, the median throughput is high
because two hop paths do not suﬀer from intra-path in-
terference in all conﬁgurations. Figure 7 also shows that
ROMA achieves signiﬁcantly higher throughput in the lower
percentiles.
In particular, the 20-percentile throughput of
ROMA is 4 Mbps, compared to 3.1 Mbps for the identical
channels conﬁguration and 2.5 Mbps for the common chan-
nel conﬁguration.
In Figure 8, we examine how throughput diﬀers for paths
with diﬀerent hopcounts. Unlike the identical or common
channel conﬁgurations, there is little throughput degrada-
tion in ROMA as hopcount increases because ROMA as-
signs non-overlapping channels along all links in a gateway
path. Even for paths with 3 or more hops, ROMA achieves
a median of 4.1 Mbps, a 7% drop in performance compared
to that of single hop paths (4.4 Mbps).
In the identical
channel conﬁguration, any path with 3 or more hops suf-
fers from intra-path interference, causing the throughput
to be reduced by more than half. In the common channel
conﬁguration, some 3-hop paths consist of only one link on
the common channel, thus avoiding intra-path interference.
However, since the network has the densest connectivity on
the common channel, the majority of three hop paths re-
quire 2 links on the common channel and thus suﬀer from
intra-path interference.
Interestingly, we observe that the average and 20-
percentile throughput of 1 and 2-hop paths in ROMA are
better than that in the identical and common channel con-
ﬁgurations, as shown in Figure 8. For example, the 20-
percentile throughput of 2-hop paths in ROMA is 3.9 Mbps,
compared to 3.1 Mbps for the identical channel conﬁgura-
tion. This is because with the identical channel conﬁgura-
tion, many nodes choose 1 or 2-hop gateway paths involving
links with mediocre delivery ratios. There exist alternative
3 or 4-hop paths over links with high delivery ratios, but
these paths are not chosen because they involve links that
interfere with each other on the same channel, therefore re-
sulting in worse path metrics. We also notice that the 1 and
2-hop paths in the identical channel conﬁguration outper-
form those in the common channel conﬁguration. When all
nodes use 2 identical channels, the network is densely con-
nected with many high quality links to choose 1 and 2-hop
paths from. Since ROMA assigns channels according to a

node’s best gateway path, ROMA retains those high quality
links necessary for constructing good gateway routes. By
contrast, since the common channel conﬁguration in [20] is
designed to optimize for the all-pairs traﬃc pattern, nodes
assign channels independently of any routing paths, result-
ing in the loss of some high quality links that are useful for
choosing good gateway routes.
TCP Throughput: We repeat the same single-ﬂow ex-
periment to evaluate the throughput of TCP ﬂows. Achiev-
ing high throughput over multi-hop wireless paths is known
to be diﬃcult, since the increase in RTT variance as well
as the increased loss rates has a detrimental
impact on
TCP [16, 5]. However, from Figure 9, we observe that TCP
ﬂows in ROMA achieve only marginally lower throughput
when compared to the UDP ﬂows, even for longer paths.
For example, in 3-hop (and 4-hop) paths, the median TCP
throughput is 3.38 Mbps (and 3.48 Mbps), which is merely
17% lower when compared to the median UDP throughput
of 4.10 Mbps (and 4.22 Mbps). This shows that ROMA is
able to identify paths that consistently exhibit high perfor-
mance, leading to high throughput over UDP as well as TCP.
Route stretch: ROMA uses the parameter β to bal-
ance the tradeoﬀ between path performance and overhead.
We set up one node (node-18) as the gateway and vary β
to study its eﬀect on the average path length as well as
the single-ﬂow throughput from the gateway to each of the
23 non-gateway nodes. We use three diﬀerent values of β
(0.7, 0.8, 0.9) and run the experiment 3 times for each of
them. Across the 3 runs, the average path length is 1.98, 2.1
and 2.63, and the total number of 4+ hop paths is 5, 12 and
21, for β=0.7, 0.8 and 0.9 respectively. We observe that as
β is decreased, many of the high-performance 4+ hop paths
are replaced by sub-optimal 3 hop paths. In particular, the
average 3-hop path throughput is 3.8, 3.98 and 4.29 Mbps for
β=0.7, 0.8 and 0.9 respectively. In summary, higher values
of β improve performance at the cost of increased path over-
head, while smaller β values tend to penalize longer paths
at the cost of lower performance.
6.3 Aggregate throughput of multiple ﬂows
In addition to achieving better single ﬂow performance,
ROMA also improves the aggregate performance of mul-
tiple ﬂows by utilizing multiple non-overlapping channels
within the same physical region. We measure the aggre-

gate throughput of multiple randomly chosen simultaneous
ﬂows for two network conﬁgurations: (a) 1 gateway, 3 ﬂows;
(b) 3 gateways, 9 ﬂows. In each experiment, we start ROMA
on all nodes and wait for 5 minutes to allow the routes to
stabilize, before starting the ﬂows. We repeat each set of ex-
periments 60 times, using randomly selected gateways and
traﬃc sinks.
In experiments with one gateway, the gate-
way sets its channels to (40,11). In the 3-gateway case, the
channels used by the gateways are (40,11),(60,6) and (50,1).
Figure 10 shows the cumulative distribution of the
aggregate throughput of ROMA. In the 1-gateway exper-
iment, the median aggregate throughput is 4.58 Mbps,
while in more than 90% of the runs, the throughput is
greater than 3.46 Mbps.
In the 3-gateway experiment,
the median aggregate throughput further increases to 14.8
Mbps, with more than 90% of the runs resulting in an
aggregate throughput of more than 10.7 Mbps. However, we
notice that in a large fraction of runs, the set of randomly
chosen ﬂows do not always utilize both radios on all of
the gateways. For example, in many runs of the 1-gateway
3-ﬂow experiment, all 3 ﬂows route to the same radio on
the gateway. This explains why the median throughput in
the 1-gateway, 3-ﬂow experiment is less than two times the
median throughput of the single-ﬂow case. One potential
improvement is to explicitly balance the routes chosen to
diﬀerent gateway radios, as is done in [26].
We repeat the 3-gateway, 9-ﬂow experiment with the iden-
tical and common channel conﬁgurations. The median ag-
gregate throughput in the identical channel conﬁguration is
7 Mbps while with the common channel conﬁguration, the
aggregate throughput improves to 10 Mbps. This is because
the 3 gateways in the common channel conﬁguration utilize
all 3 orthogonal 802.11b/g channels as compared to only 1
802.11b/g channel in the case of the identical channel con-
ﬁguration. Since ROMA uses 3 802.11b/g and 3 802.11a
channels among 3 gateways, as opposed to only 1 802.11a
channel in the common channel conﬁguration, it achieves
the highest aggregate throughput. In particular, ROMA’s
median aggregate throughput is 1.4× and 2.1× that of the
common and identical channel conﬁgurations, respectively.
The presence of multiple gateway radios on non-
overlapping channels is not the only reason for increased
aggregate throughput. As the number of gateways increases,
the average path length between a node and its nearest gate-
way decreases signiﬁcantly, thereby reducing path overhead
and increasing aggregate throughput. In particular, for the

for the single gateway, single ﬂow experiments. Incorpo-
rating link variation improves performance signiﬁcantly
over many paths.
3-gateway case, a majority of gateway paths are 1-hop paths.
Since the gateways use diﬀerent channels for their radios,
ﬂows destined to diﬀerent gateway radios do not interfere
with each other, leading to high aggregate throughput.
6.4 Effect of incorporating link variation
As described in Section 3.2, we penalize links that exhibit
highly variable losses by incorporating the mean deviation
of measured delivery ratios in the ETT calculation.
In order to understand the eﬀect of incorporating vari-
ance in the link metric, we repeat the single ﬂow experi-
ments using the original ETT metric without the deviation
penalty. Since 802.11b/g links exhibit greater variability
than 802.11a links, we consider only those paths that are of
length ≥ 2, since they contain at least one 802.11b/g link.
Figure 11 shows that incorporating variation improves the
path throughput for a signiﬁcant fraction of paths, because
it enables ROMA to choose better and more stable paths. In
particular, 85% of 2+ hop paths using the variation-aware
metric achieve throughput of greater than 3.5 Mbps, while
only 50% of 2+ hop paths achieve more than 3.5 Mbps
without incorporating variation. Similarly, 75% of 2+ hop
paths using the variation-aware metric achieve throughput
of greater than 4 Mbps, while only 34% of 2+ hop paths
achieve more than 4 Mbps without incorporating variation.
We further observe that links with almost perfect delivery
ratios tend to exhibit relatively low variability. As a result,
a number of high throughput paths consisting of links with
low variability are coincidentally chosen by variance unaware
ROMA as well. The eﬀect of incorporating variation is more
pronounced for paths that need to use links with intermedi-
ate delivery ratios, since many of these links also tend to be
highly variable. In summary, our results show that delivery
ratio variation is an important consideration for choosing
stable, predictable and high performance routes.
6.5 Effect of incorporating external load
To study the eﬀect of external load on ROMA, we use a
laptop as a controlled interference source to generate exter-
nal load. We conduct this experiment in the middle of the
night, where the measured real background traﬃc is neg-
ligible. We set up one gateway (node-10) and conﬁgure
the other nodes as non-gateways. We start the interference
source to transmit on channel 6 and measure the single ﬂow
UDP throughput from each node to the gateway. We vary
the external load to occupy 10%, 40% and 100% of channel
time and run the experiments with and without incorporat-
ing load into the path metric.
Figure 12, 13 and 14 compare the performance of load-
aware ROMA with load-unaware ROMA, for diﬀerent de-
grees of load. We observe that at low loads (10%), load-
aware ROMA shifts some gateway paths to alternate un-
loaded paths, resulting in a small improvement in perfor-
mance. At moderate load (40%), some links become lossier
and as a result, even load-unaware ROMA shifts some paths.
However, those paths whose delivery ratios do not change
much remain on the loaded path. Load-aware ROMA, on
the other hand, has completely avoided the loaded links in all
paths, resulting in 70% increase in average path throughput
over load-unaware ROMA. Finally, when the load is near
saturation, the delivery ratios of most links on channel 6
deteriorate drastically, causing even load-unaware ROMA
to switch all its paths away from saturated links. Under
saturating load, both load-aware and load-unaware ROMA
end up picking the same paths that avoid the saturated
channel; hence, both achieve similar performance. In sum-
mary, load-awareness leads to signiﬁcant performance im-
provements under moderate external loads.
6.6 Channel assignment over time
To understand how stable channel assignments are, we
monitor the progress of ROMA over a 5-hour period with
node-16 as the gateway. Figure 15 shows the route and
channel changes in ROMA for every node. Over the 5-hour
experiment, there are 76 route changes among the 23 non-
gateway nodes, and 59 of these route changes involve channel
changes as well. Upon startup, all non-gateway nodes per-
form at least one investigation and ﬁnd their gateway paths.
For a majority of nodes, their channel assignments and gate-
way routes remain stable. For example, nodes 2,10,19,21,22
do not change their gateway paths or channels after the ini-
tial route calculation. Some nodes (e.g. node 8) do not
change channels after the initial assignment, but recalculate
better gateway routes on the same channels. This demon-
strates ROMA’s advantage of maintaining cross-links in the
topology: alternate routes can be found without requiring
expensive channel changes.
We also ﬁnd that some nodes (e.g. nodes 6,11,12,13,14)
change their routes and channels twice within the span of a
few minutes. This behavior has two causes: Initially when
node A investigates node B on channel c, A has no informa-
