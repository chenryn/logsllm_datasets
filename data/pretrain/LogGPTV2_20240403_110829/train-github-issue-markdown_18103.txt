Hi, I'm developing console-wrapper , that is an extension for javascript
console.log (other languages support will be added soon) and I need some
access for clipboard content in Extensions API. I think this methods should be
enough for most of cases:
  * vscode.clipboard.getContent()
  * vscode.clipboard.setContent()
Some event handlers should be useful, too, like:
-vscode.clipboard.beforeContentLoad()  
-vscode.clipboard.onContentLoad()  
-vscode.clipboard.onContentLoaded()
Steps for the extension:
  * user copy some text; 
    * when ctrl+shift+q text is wrapped with console.log and inserted at below line.
hugs,
