## Feature request
**What is the expected behavior?**  
The `cache.maxGenerations` config works in `filesystem` cache to keep cache
files slim.
**What is motivation or use case for adding/changing the behavior?**  
Our project is huge, which generate a huge .cache directory over 800MB, and
the cache size keep increasing with the passes of compilation. We run the CI
progress in a new docker environment everytime when the project code changed,
so we need store the .cache directory in outside storage, huge cache file will
slow down the CI progress obviously.
I read the source code and find that filesystem cache always keep the unused
items until the maxAge is exceeded, so what i need is to set maxGenerations
limit to 1 and remove unused items from cache files everytime.
**How should this be implemented in your opinion?**  
Record the generations in pack content items, read the `cache.maxGenerations`
config and decide to keep or remove unused items in
`Pack._optimizeUnusedContent`.
**Are you willing to work on this yourself?**  
Yes
