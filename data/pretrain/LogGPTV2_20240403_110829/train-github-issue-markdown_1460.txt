I have a freshly-built numpy on OS X 10.9, and am running into pretty regular
crashes related to umath.so. Here is a Gist with the crash report. It seems to
crash in a variety of ways, but I can reliably get it to crash by importing a
module like Theano, which has numpy as a dependency. I have re-built all of my
packages since upgrading to OSX 10.9.
