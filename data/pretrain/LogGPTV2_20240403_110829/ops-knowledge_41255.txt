User:  How to install and configure Nginx reverse proxy server in CentOS system, and realize HTTPS-based web application access?
Assistant: The following are the steps to install and configure the Nginx reverse proxy server and implement HTTPS-based web application access in the CentOS system: 1. Install Nginx In the CentOS system, you can use the yum package manager to install Nginx. Enter the following command in the terminal to install: sudo yum install nginx 2. Configure the reverse proxy Open the Nginx configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf and add the following content: location / { proxy_pass http://your_server_ip:your_server_port; proxy_set_header X -Real-IP $remote_addr; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; } Among them, your_server_ip is the IP address of the server that needs to be proxied, and your_server_port is the port number of the server that needs to be proxied. The above configuration indicates that when accessing the Nginx server, the request is forwarded to the specified server and port. 3. Configure HTTPS To implement HTTPS-based web application access, certificates and keys are required. Certificates and keys can be obtained using the certbot automation tool. Install certbot by entering the following command in the terminal: sudo yum install certbot python2-certbot-nginx Then obtain the certificate and key with the following command: sudo certbot --nginx -d example.com where example.com is the certificate for which you want to obtain and the domain name of the key. As you execute the command, certbot will guide you through the process of obtaining and installing certificates and keys. 4. Modify the Nginx configuration file Open the Nginx configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf, and add the following content to the server block: listen 443 ssl; ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem; ssl_certificate_key / etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem; where example.com is the domain name where you obtained the certificate and key. The above configuration indicates that Nginx will provide HTTPS service through port 443, and use the previously obtained certificate and key. 5. Restart Nginx After completing the above configuration, you need to restart the Nginx server to make the configuration take effect. Enter the following command in the terminal to restart Nginx: sudo systemctl restart nginx So far, you have installed and configured the Nginx reverse proxy server in the CentOS system, and implemented HTTPS-based web application access. You can use https://example.com to access your web application.
