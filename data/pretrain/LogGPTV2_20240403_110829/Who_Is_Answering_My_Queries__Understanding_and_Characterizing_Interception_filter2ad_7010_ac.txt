### Interception over UDP and Other Factors

#### China-Wide Analysis
We collaborate with an international security company that has developed a widely-used mobile security software, boasting millions of users. This software is granted permission to send arbitrary network requests upon installation, enabling us to collect fine-grained DNS data.

#### Ethical and Privacy Concerns
The primary concerns in this experiment revolve around ethics and privacy. We address these issues as follows:
1. **User Consent**: The module implementing our measurement script (sending and receiving DNS packets) requires explicit user consent. Users must manually run the software after granting permission.
2. **Traffic Management**: While diverse DNS requests provide comprehensive insights into DNS interception characteristics, we avoid generating excessive traffic on users' devices. This limits the diversity of our DNS requests.
3. **Data Privacy**: Our script only captures DNS packets for domains exclusively registered for this study, ensuring that private data, such as requests to social networks, is not collected.

#### Distribution of DNS Packets
According to our inception model, to generate diverse DNS packets, we should launch DNS requests from a client under all four different SLDs, for all five RR types, over both TCP and UDP, and to all four public DNS services. However, ethical concerns and limitations of vantage points make this challenging. In the global analysis phase, ProxyRack only accepts TCP traffic and has a rate limit for submitting requests. Therefore, from each client, we only request DNS A records, the most common RR type, for our .com domain name using TCP-based lookups, directed to all four public DNS services.

### 4.1 Scope and Magnitude of Global DNSIntercept

We investigate the global landscape of DNSIntercept from three perspectives:
1. **Identification and Classification**: Using our methodology, we identify and classify interception by cross-matching resolver addresses.
2. **Validation of Responses**: We validate whether clients accept correct responses. A response is considered correct if its RR value matches the RR of the same FQDN responded by our authoritative nameserver; otherwise, it is deemed incorrect, indicating tampering.
3. **Request Replication**: For Request replication, interceptors may use out-of-band DNS packets (responses of replicated lookups) to replace in-band ones (responses of original lookups). We analyze how many in-band responses are eventually accepted by clients.

#### Summary of Findings
- **Interception Types**: All three types of interception are found in our dataset.
- **Client ASes**: 198 out of 2,691 (7.36%) client ASes witness intercepted traffic, with 158 of them having queries to Google Public DNS intercepted.
- **Direct Responding**: The ratio of Direct responding is low, as resolvers cannot correctly resolve a domain without contacting nameservers.
- **Public DNS Services**: Renowned public DNS services, such as Google DNS (0.66% packets intercepted), are more likely to be targets compared to less-known services like EDU DNS (0.45% packets intercepted).
- **Response Validation**: Almost all responses accepted by clients are correct, except one caused by domain blocking in AS36992 (EG, ETISALAT-MISR).
- **Request Replication**: Among 23 ASes where replicated queries are found, only clients in 2 ASes (AS9198 JSC Kazakhtelecom and AS31252 Star-Net Solutii SRL) receive in-band responses.

### 4.2 AS-Level Characteristics

In our landscape study, intercepted DNS requests are found in 198 client ASes. We focus on the 158 ASes with intercepted requests to Google Public DNS.

### 3.5 Ethics

Our methodology introduces several ethical considerations. We take utmost care to protect users from potential side effects.

#### Global Analysis
- **ProxyRack**: We use a commercial service, adhering to their terms of service and ensuring that owners of exit nodes have agreed to allow ProxyRack traffic.
- **China-Wide Analysis**: Our measurement script is implemented in a network debugger module of the security software. Users must provide one-time consent, and they can choose to install the software without the measurement module.

#### Methodology
- **DNS Requests**: We carefully craft DNS requests and limit their quantities to avoid excessive network traffic.
- **Privacy Protection**: We only launch DNS lookups for domain names exclusively registered for this study, without connecting to any host except DNS resolvers.

Through these approaches, we minimize threats to user privacy and security, as all operations are conducted with user consent and within a limited scope.

### 4. TCP DNS Interception Analysis (Global)

To conduct a global measurement of DNSIntercept, we leverage a residential proxy network based on TCP SOCKS. Here, we report our measurement results and analysis, focusing on the landscape and characteristics.

#### Summary of Interception (Global Analysis)
- **Table 2**: Summary of interception types, ratios, and problematic ASes.
- **Top 10 ASes**: Targeted public DNS services and alternative resolvers.
- **TrafÔ¨Åc Ranking**: Problematic ASes span a diverse ranking, including reputable ASes.
- **Country-Level Analysis**: 158 ASes span 41 countries, with Russia, the US, Indonesia, Brazil, and India being the top contributors.

#### Case Study: AS7922
- **Comcast Cable Communications, LLC**: Among 13,466 DNS requests sent from this AS to Google DNS, 72 (0.53%) are redirected. Alternative resolvers (IP prefix 76.96.15.*) handle the resolution, suggesting limited deployment of interception devices within sub-networks.

### 4.3 Summary of Findings

Our global analysis reveals significant insights into DNSIntercept, highlighting the prevalence and characteristics of interception across various ASes and regions.
