A  Protection Switch Byte Failure is detected when the  Protection Switch Byte defect count exceeds a  threshold. A Protection Switch Byte Defect is  detected when one of the following happens:  1 The remote APS request is not one of the  supported requests.  2 The remote APS request channel number is invalid.  For 1+1 APS the channel number must be 0 or 1.  3 Operation is bidirectional and neither local nor  remote network element is sending a  REVERSE-REQUEST and the remote APS request is  of lower priority than the local APS request.  4 Operation is bidirectional and the sequence  number in the remote APS REVERSE-REQUEST does  not match the sequence number of the most recent  APS request sent by the local network element.  This error is posted if a the APS request is somehow  corrupted or b there is a bug in the APS software  itself or c if the APS communication between two  network elements is broken e.g. local network element  can send and receive whereas the remote network  element can send but not receive."
