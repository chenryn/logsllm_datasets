User: Please explain in detail the encryption principle of HTTPS and the SSL/TLS handshake process.
Assistant: HTTPS is a secure version of the HTTP protocol. Compared with HTTP, HTTPS encrypts and protects the security of data transmission by using the SSL/TLS protocol. SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is a secure transmission protocol, and TLS (Transport Layer Security) is an upgraded version of SSL. The following is the encryption principle of HTTPS and the SSL/TLS handshake process: The encryption principle of HTTPS: HTTPS establishes a secure channel between the client and the server by using the SSL/TLS protocol, which uses a mathematical function called an encryption algorithm to achieve data encryption. These encryption algorithms include symmetric key encryption and asymmetric key encryption. Symmetric key encryption uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt data, while asymmetric key encryption uses a pair of public and private keys to encrypt and decrypt data. SSL/TLS handshake process: Before a secure channel can be established between a client and server, they must first complete a process called the SSL/TLS handshake. The SSL/TLS handshake process includes the following steps: 1. The client sends an encrypted version of the SSL/TLS connection request to the server, and then sends some supported protocol information to the server. 2. After receiving the client's request, the server sends the supported protocols and certificate information back to the client. 3. After the client receives the certificate returned by the server, it will check the validity of the certificate, such as whether the certificate has expired and whether it is issued by a trusted authority. If the certificate is valid, the client will use the server's public key to encrypt a random number and send the encrypted content to the server. 4. After the server receives the encrypted random number sent by the client, it will use its own private key to decrypt it. The server then generates a symmetric key by using the common random number of the client and server. 5. Both the client and the server use the symmetric key to encrypt and decrypt the data. After the symmetric key is determined, the handshake process ends, and then the server and the client can establish a secure channel and transmit data through the SSL/TLS protocol. It is worth noting that the above steps are just a simple handshake process. The actual SSL/TLS handshake process also involves some complicated details, such as how to deal with errors in the handshake message, how to deal with the certificate chain, and so on.
