## Expected Behavior
I should be able to use the package request without crashes.
## Current Behavior

    These dependencies were not found:
    * fs in ./node_modules/needle/lib/needle.js, ./node_modules/needle/lib/multipart.js and 1 other
    * net in ./node_modules/forever-agent/index.js, ./node_modules/tough-cookie/lib/cookie.js and 1 other
    * tls in ./node_modules/forever-agent/index.js, ./node_modules/tunnel-agent/index.js
    To install them, you can run: npm install --save fs net tls
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. Get a next.js project running (I've utilized the Basic CSS Exaple)
  2. Add the package with `npm install request`
  3. Import the package anywhere with `import request from 'request'`
  4. Try to run, the server crashes as soon as it reaches the import.
## Context
I am just trying to create a POST request to an API.
