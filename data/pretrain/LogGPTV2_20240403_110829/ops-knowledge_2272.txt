User: How to use Ansible tools to automate the software installation and configuration of Linux servers?
Assistant: 1. Install Ansible Install Ansible on the control machine. On Ubuntu/Debian, you can use the following command to install: apt-get install ansible 2. Write Ansible Playbook In Ansible, a Playbook is a file that defines a list of tasks to be executed . Software installation and configuration tasks can be automated using Ansible Playbooks. Here is a simple Ansible Playbook example: - name: Install and configure nginx hosts: web_servers tasks: - name: Ensure nginx package is installed apt: name=nginx state=present - name: Ensure nginx service is running service: name=nginx state=started 3. Define host inventory In Ansible, a host inventory is a file that lists all the hosts to be managed. The host inventory is defined using the INVENTORY file (hosts). [web_servers] server1.example.com server2.example.com 4. Run the Ansible Playbook Use the ansible-playbook command to run the Playbook: ansible-playbook playbook.yaml -i inventory This command will automatically install and configure the Nginx package on the web_servers on all hosts. More tasks can be defined in the Playbook, and more hosts can be listed in the host list. You can use Ansible Playbook with other tools such as Jenkins or cron as a scheduler for continuous integration and automation of operations tasks.
