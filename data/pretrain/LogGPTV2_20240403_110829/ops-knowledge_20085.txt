User: I am trying to set up a Bonjour (or Ahavi) chatbot for our helpdesk system that would answer basic questions based on a menu system. The basis of my question is how do I get python to create the bot so that it connects to the network as a chat client.
Basically, anyone on my network with iChat or Empathy (or any chat program able to view users over the local network) should see the bot just as they see another user. The actual bot part would be quite simple to program, but I have no idea how to get it on the network. 
I have looked into ZeroConf, but I'm not exactly sure how it works, or how to get a chat service running with python. I have seen references to pybonjour, python bindings for avahi, and pyzeroconf, but again, I have no idea how to set them up.
If anyone could give an example, or reference, or even a good article to read on the subject, it would be much appreciated. Thanks!

Assistant: The easiest thing to do is to use Telepathy Salut or Pidgin/libpurple, and talk with it over D-Bus.
