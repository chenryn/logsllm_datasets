#### Expected Behavior
The `with-apollo-client` HOC (Higher-Order Component) should be called only once per server-side rendering (SSR) request.

#### Current Behavior
In the `with-apollo` example, which utilizes `_app.js`, the initialization occurs twice on the server. This appears to be due to the `Error` component also calling `_app.js` in addition to the page component.

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. Add a `console.log(Component)` statement within the `getInitialProps` method of the `with-apollo-client` HOC.
2. Observe the console output, which will display two entries: one for your component and another for the `Error` component.

#### Context
This issue may impact performance and potentially cause other side effects.

#### Environment
- **Next.js Version:** 6.0.1
