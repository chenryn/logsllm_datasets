## Expected Behavior
with-apollo-client should be called once only per ssr
## Current Behavior
The with-apollo example that uses _app.js initializes twice on the server,
this seems to be due to Error being called with _app.js as well as the page.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
Add a console.log(Component) within the getInitialProps of with-apollo-client
and see console log two entries. One for your component another for error.
## Context
Performance and possible other side effects.
