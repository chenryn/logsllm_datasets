User: I have a scons setup where I can choose to run SWIG and build a python module from c++.
this creates files such as

x_wrap.cc
x.lib
x.obj

etc.
When all I want to have at the end of the process are theses files:

_x.pyd
x.py

Is there a way I can get scons to delete the unwanted files after the build process?
Assistant: It seems like using the "Delete" function as a Command, after the SharedLibrary line, allows me to delete the unwanted files.
