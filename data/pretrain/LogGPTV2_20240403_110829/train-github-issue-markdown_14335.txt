Currently, the nightly build versions are at 0.6. The nightly build checks on AppVeyor and Travis CI are conducted against version 0.6. However, on the package status page at http://pkg.julialang.org/, all packages are indicated as passing or failing for version 0.5, even though they are no longer being tested against this version. 

Is it possible that http://pkg.julialang.org/ requires some time to update its status to reflect the 0.6 version? Additionally, it appears that downloading version 0.5 (rc1) is no longer available from the official Julia downloads page (http://julialang.org/downloads/), as there is no link provided (at least, I could not find one).

While this situation does not pose a significant issue for me, it might be confusing for other users.
