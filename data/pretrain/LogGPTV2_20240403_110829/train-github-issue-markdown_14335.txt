Currently the nightly build versions are 0.6
Nightly build checks at appveyor and travis are done against 0.6, but at
http://pkg.julialang.org/ all packages are shown to pass/fail 0.5 although
they are not checked against 0.5 anymore.  
Or does http://pkg.julialang.org/ just need some time to proceed to 0.6?
Download of version 0.5 (rc1) seems also not possible anymore from
http://julialang.org/downloads/ as no link is provided (at least I can't find
it).
This is not a major problem for me but maybe its confusing for some people.
