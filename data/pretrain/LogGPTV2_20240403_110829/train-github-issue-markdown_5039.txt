Hi all, At the moment I am trying to scan and scroll my ES index to export all
the data, but I noticed that not always all the documents are returned. In
other words ES says I have 1.115.857 documents in my index, but my export
contains 1.049.191 documents. Testing with an index with up to 900.000
document is working fine. Somebody that can explain this behavior?
ES is running on a CentOS machine with 6GB of RAM with a ES_HEAP_SIZE of 3GB.
