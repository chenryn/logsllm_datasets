Subject: Incomplete Document Export from Elasticsearch Index

Hello Everyone,

I am currently working on exporting all the data from an Elasticsearch (ES) index by scanning and scrolling. However, I have encountered an issue where not all documents are being returned in the export.

Here are the details:
- The ES index reports a total of 1,115,857 documents.
- My export, however, only contains 1,049,191 documents.
- Testing with smaller indices (up to 900,000 documents) works without any issues.

Could someone please help explain this behavior?

Additional Information:
- ES is running on a CentOS machine.
- The machine has 6GB of RAM.
- The ES_HEAP_SIZE is set to 3GB.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
