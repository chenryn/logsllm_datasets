our traces—and possibly signiﬁcantly more—might include hidden
switches. This ﬁgure is fairly consistent with the 55–67% of traces
exhibiting aberrant levels of monitored hosts as seen in Figure 5.
Thus we argue that we have good evidence that hidden switches
are widely prevalent in our dataset.
7. TRAFFIC LOCALITY
After the arduous process of calibrating our datasets, we can now
brieﬂy turn our attention to developing high-level characterizations.
We view the results in this section as motivating the work presented
above, because the analyses show that subnet-level trafﬁc patterns
manifest quite differently from both wide-area trafﬁc and internal
trafﬁc that leaves the subnet. Therefore, while the above calibration
efforts may seem like mundane logistical issues, they indeed form
the key foundation for then obtaining sound insights into a rather
unexplored area of networking.
The ﬁrst step in characterizing enterprise trafﬁc is to attribute
each packet to a particular locality. In our analysis we distinguish
three such forms: (i) subnet speciﬁes trafﬁc that stays strictly in-
side a given broadcast domain, (ii) LBL contains trafﬁc that leaves
the subnet, but remains conﬁned inside the LBL enterprise, and
(iii) WAN denotes trafﬁc that involves communication with hosts
external to LBL.
For mapping packets into locality bins, we leverage an observa-
tion made in § 6.1: for the LBL and WAN bins, one of the MAC ad-
dresses must belong to a router. Thus, for each packet we apply the
following rules: (i) if none of the MAC addresses corresponds to a
router, we put the packet in the subnet bin; (ii) if one of the MAC
addresses is a router, and the corresponding IP address belongs to
LBL, the packet falls into the LBL bin; and (iii) if a MAC address
is a router, and the corresponding IP address is outside LBL, then
the packet belongs to the WAN bin.
We ﬁnd three types of packets that do not fall into any of these
locality bins. For all three, we observe the router’s MAC address
as the source, but instead of IP, the packets are: DECnet, CGMP,
or ARP. The operators informed us that LBL did not route non-
IP trafﬁc at the time we captured the traces, and therefore these
packets must have originated from the router itself. Indeed, CGMP
packets are sent by routers to populate Catalyst 5000 switches with
multicast-aware entries, and ARP to resolve unknown MAC to IP
mappings. The number of DECnet packets is very low (no more
than 200 packets per trace),11 while CGMP appears in fairly high
numbers in less than half of our traces. Both of these protocols, un-
like ARP, sent packets exclusively to Ethernet multicast addresses.
Since all three protocols operate inside a subnet, we deem it plau-
sible to designate all of them as subnet, i.e., local to the LAN.
Figure 6 plots the relative trafﬁc locality mix across all traces.
We ﬁrst note the wide variety of bin size proportions in our
dataset—illustrating that it is impossible to devise a single rule-
of-thumb regarding locality patterns in an enterprise. Additionally
the plot suggests that in half of the traces subnet trafﬁc dominates,
and thus previous studies of trafﬁc captured from a router’s van-
tage point have missed much of the activity taking place in an
enterprise—again underlining the importance of obtaining enter-
prise switch measurements.
11We have not yet formulated a plausible reason for DECnet pack-
ets to originate at the router, and there are some indications that
the enterprise’s routers may have actually routed DECnet trafﬁc in
some cases. However, in the amounts we observed the trafﬁc will
not skew our results, and therefore we did not further analyze these
packets for this initial study.

Figure 6: Trafﬁc locality mix. The X-axis is sorted by the subnet
bin share in descending order.
In addition to variability in locality, we see variety in network
and transport protocol usage across locality as well. While by
deﬁnition LBL and WAN trafﬁc solely involves IP, the WAN traf-
ﬁc is furthermore mainly TCP—with a median share across traces
of 97%—while in the LBL trafﬁc, UDP dominates, with a median
share of 58% across traces. In the subnet IP trafﬁc, the proportions
of TCP and UDP range from 1% to 99% (!), with medians of 36%
and 60% respectively. IP trafﬁc prevails over non-IP at subnet lo-
cality, with a median of 72% vs. 29%. The dominant non-IP trafﬁc
is ARP (54%), LLC (34%) and IPX (6%). Ethernet multicast trafﬁc
comprises 37% of the packets in the subnet bin and mainly consists
of non-IP trafﬁc (97%)
Finally, we turn to a high-level view of dominant network, trans-
port and application protocols. We plot the most dominant proto-
cols in each locality in Figure 7, with circle radii corresponding to
the relative volume in number of packets. To ensure readability, we
include only the 15 most frequent protocols in each locality.12
We found only two protocols that appear for each category of
locality: HTTP (80/tcp), and SSH (22/tcp). Three more protocols
(see the top of the plots) appear common both to LBL and subnet.
Finally, NetBIOS (139/tcp), Dantz (497/tcp), NFS (2049/udp) and
ARP prevail in intra-subnet trafﬁc. In the LBL category we also ﬁnd
svrloc (427/udp) in large proportions in majority of traces. This set
of plots clearly shows massive heterogeneity of trafﬁc across both
type of locality and set of monitored ports.
An illuminating way to underline the importance of calibration
is to present a showcase that directly compares some properties of
calibrated and non-calibrated traces. For this purpose, out of the
four calibration aspects discussed in this paper we choose “gain,”
as it offers an intuitively expected and easily visualizable contrast.
By analogy with Figure 7 we calculated relative protocol shares in
non-calibrated traces.13 We plot the difference in shares between
original and ﬁnal traces in Figure 8. We present subnet local-
ity, which exhibits the most striking contrast. In interpreting the
plot, the reader should bear in mind that it shows changes in rela-
tive prevalence among the different protocols, rather than absolute
12The plots are not meant to capture a comprehensive picture, but to
illustrate the dominant protocols.
13We used the raw traces, for which none of the calibration tech-
niques were applied.

in attributes much between the uncalibrated and calibrated traces,
can exhibit signiﬁcant change in its overall share of the trafﬁc. In
general, the plot highlights how correct calibration can have a dra-
matic effect on the accuracy of determining trafﬁc mix.
8. SUMMARY
In this paper we have presented a number of techniques for cal-
ibrating packet traces captured at switches connecting end hosts in
terms of: gain, loss, timing, and layout. While we have developed
concrete strategies that we successfully employed with our dataset,
we view the main contribution of this paper to be the reasoning
about how to go about calibrating such traces in a sound fashion. In
particular, we identiﬁed the following key notions: (i) using sole-
sourced packets as unambiguous “stakes in the ground” to hunt for
thresholds and compare clocks, (ii) employing expected replica-
tion of broadcast packets to point to missing events from traces and
aid in mapping networks, (iii) leveraging TCP semantics to iden-
tify measurement loss, particularly in terms of seemingly erroneous
acknowledgments for date we never observed in transmission, and
(iv) leveraging multiple, simultaneous data collections to further
illuminate unrecorded events and bolster conﬁdence in the time-
stamping process. These general principles apply to similar collec-
tions, and we encourage others working with enterprise traces to
calibrate their analyses using strategies in this paper, though not
necessarily with the same ﬁne-grained details (e.g., the 5 msec
threshold for removing phantoms). These ﬁne-grained constants
and thresholds may well not hold with different switches and mon-
itoring gear. Further, when collecting new datasets we encourage
researchers to do so in a way that they can leverage the general con-
cepts we have outlined in this paper to calibrate their ﬁnal dataset.
Finally, we have illustrated the importance of collecting switch-
level measurements, as observations from other vantage points will
manifest clear differences at the various locality scopes present in
our data.
