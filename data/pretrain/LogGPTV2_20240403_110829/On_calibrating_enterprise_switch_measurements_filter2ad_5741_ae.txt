### 152. Hidden Switches in Traces

Based on our analysis, we estimate that at least approximately 42 of our traces—and possibly significantly more—may contain hidden switches. This figure is consistent with the 55–67% of traces exhibiting aberrant levels of monitored hosts, as shown in Figure 5. Therefore, we argue that there is substantial evidence to suggest that hidden switches are prevalent in our dataset.

### 7. Traffic Locality

After completing the rigorous process of calibrating our datasets, we can now turn our attention to developing high-level characterizations. The results in this section provide motivation for the work presented above, as they show that subnet-level traffic patterns differ significantly from both wide-area traffic and internal traffic that leaves the subnet. Thus, while the calibration efforts may seem like mundane logistical issues, they form the essential foundation for obtaining sound insights into a relatively unexplored area of networking.

#### 7.1. Characterizing Enterprise Traffic

The first step in characterizing enterprise traffic is to attribute each packet to a specific locality. In our analysis, we distinguish three types of localities:
- **Subnet**: Traffic that remains strictly within a given broadcast domain.
- **LBL**: Traffic that leaves the subnet but remains confined within the LBL enterprise.
- **WAN**: Traffic involving communication with hosts external to LBL.

For mapping packets into these localities, we use an observation from § 6.1: for the LBL and WAN categories, one of the MAC addresses must belong to a router. We apply the following rules:
- If none of the MAC addresses corresponds to a router, the packet is placed in the subnet category.
- If one of the MAC addresses is a router and the corresponding IP address belongs to LBL, the packet is placed in the LBL category.
- If a MAC address is a router and the corresponding IP address is outside LBL, the packet is placed in the WAN category.

We identified three types of packets that do not fit into any of these localities. These packets have the router's MAC address as the source but are not IP-based; instead, they are DECnet, CGMP, or ARP. The operators informed us that LBL did not route non-IP traffic at the time of trace capture, so these packets must have originated from the router itself. Specifically, CGMP packets are sent by routers to populate Catalyst 5000 switches with multicast-aware entries, and ARP is used to resolve unknown MAC to IP mappings. The number of DECnet packets is very low (no more than 200 packets per trace), while CGMP appears in fairly high numbers in less than half of our traces. Both protocols, unlike ARP, send packets exclusively to Ethernet multicast addresses. Since all three protocols operate within a subnet, we classify them as subnet, i.e., local to the LAN.

Figure 6 shows the relative traffic locality mix across all traces. The wide variety of bin size proportions in our dataset illustrates that it is impossible to devise a single rule-of-thumb for locality patterns in an enterprise. Additionally, the plot suggests that in half of the traces, subnet traffic dominates, indicating that previous studies of traffic captured from a router's vantage point have missed much of the activity taking place in an enterprise. This underlines the importance of obtaining enterprise switch measurements.

**Note:** We have not yet formulated a plausible reason for DECnet packets to originate at the router, and there are some indications that the enterprise's routers may have actually routed DECnet traffic in some cases. However, the observed traffic volume is minimal and will not skew our results, so we did not further analyze these packets for this initial study.

#### 7.2. Network and Transport Protocol Usage

In addition to variability in locality, we observe a variety in network and transport protocol usage across different localities. While LBL and WAN traffic involve only IP, WAN traffic is mainly TCP, with a median share of 97% across traces. In LBL traffic, UDP dominates, with a median share of 58% across traces. In the subnet IP traffic, the proportions of TCP and UDP range from 1% to 99%, with medians of 36% and 60%, respectively. IP traffic prevails over non-IP traffic at the subnet level, with a median of 72% versus 29%. The dominant non-IP traffic in the subnet is ARP (54%), LLC (34%), and IPX (6%). Ethernet multicast traffic comprises 37% of the packets in the subnet bin and mainly consists of non-IP traffic (97%).

#### 7.3. Dominant Protocols and Applications

Finally, we present a high-level view of the dominant network, transport, and application protocols. Figure 7 plots the most dominant protocols in each locality, with circle radii corresponding to the relative volume in the number of packets. For readability, we include only the 15 most frequent protocols in each locality.

We found that only two protocols, HTTP (80/tcp) and SSH (22/tcp), appear in all three localities. Three more protocols (see the top of the plots) are common to both LBL and subnet. Intra-subnet traffic is dominated by NetBIOS (139/tcp), Dantz (497/tcp), NFS (2049/udp), and ARP. In the LBL category, svrloc (427/udp) appears in large proportions in the majority of traces. These plots clearly show the significant heterogeneity of traffic across both type of locality and set of monitored ports.

#### 7.4. Importance of Calibration

To highlight the importance of calibration, we compare some properties of calibrated and non-calibrated traces. We chose "gain" as the aspect of calibration, as it offers an intuitively expected and easily visualizable contrast. By analogy with Figure 7, we calculated the relative protocol shares in non-calibrated traces. Figure 8 shows the difference in shares between original and final traces, focusing on subnet locality, which exhibits the most striking contrast. The plot shows changes in relative prevalence among the different protocols rather than absolute changes. A protocol like HTTP, which does not change much in attributes between uncalibrated and calibrated traces, can exhibit significant changes in its overall share of the traffic. The plot highlights how correct calibration can dramatically affect the accuracy of determining the traffic mix.

### 8. Summary

In this paper, we have presented several techniques for calibrating packet traces captured at switches connecting end hosts, focusing on gain, loss, timing, and layout. While we have developed specific strategies successfully employed with our dataset, the main contribution of this paper is the reasoning about how to calibrate such traces effectively. Key notions include:
- Using sole-sourced packets as unambiguous "stakes in the ground" to find thresholds and compare clocks.
- Employing expected replication of broadcast packets to identify missing events and aid in network mapping.
- Leveraging TCP semantics to identify measurement loss, particularly in terms of seemingly erroneous acknowledgments for data never observed in transmission.
- Utilizing multiple, simultaneous data collections to illuminate unrecorded events and bolster confidence in the timestamping process.

These general principles apply to similar collections, and we encourage others working with enterprise traces to calibrate their analyses using the strategies outlined in this paper, though not necessarily with the same fine-grained details. Fine-grained constants and thresholds may vary with different switches and monitoring gear. When collecting new datasets, researchers should do so in a way that allows them to leverage the general concepts we have outlined to calibrate their final dataset. Finally, we have illustrated the importance of collecting switch-level measurements, as observations from other vantage points will manifest clear differences at the various locality scopes present in our data.
