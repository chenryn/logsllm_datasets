I am developing a Python application that can open different file types. The current implementation works well in Eclipse, where I pass the filename and a configuration file as command-line arguments using `sys.argv`:
```python
selectedFileName = sys.argv[1]
cfgFile = sys.argv[2]
```

I have converted this script into a standalone application using `py2app`. However, I am facing an issue with handling the arguments. Specifically, I need to be able to open various file types through the app, and the app also requires a configuration file for processing.

When using `py2app`, I can open a file by running the following command in the terminal:
```bash
open -a myapp.app selectedFileName config.cfg
```
This opens the file as expected. However, I want to be able to open files directly without using the terminal. Is it possible to use the "Open With" feature for this purpose? If so, how can I achieve this?

Additionally, I need to make changes to my code to handle both the file and the configuration file as arguments. I also plan to distribute this app to others.

Is there a way to use `py2app` to create a standard app that can handle these requirements? What specific changes do I need to make in my code to pass the arguments correctly?
