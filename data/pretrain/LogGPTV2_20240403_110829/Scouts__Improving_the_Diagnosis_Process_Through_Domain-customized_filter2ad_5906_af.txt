A MEASUREMENT VALIDATION
To validate our findings in §3, we looked at 182 publicly disclosed
incidents from two clouds [2, 7]. These incident reports only include
issues that led to significant customer impact, and they only provide
a partial log of the mitigation process, but they still provide some
useful insights. We found that in 35 of the 182 incidents multiple
components were discussed as either being impacted or involved in
the incident: each of these components may have been involved in
