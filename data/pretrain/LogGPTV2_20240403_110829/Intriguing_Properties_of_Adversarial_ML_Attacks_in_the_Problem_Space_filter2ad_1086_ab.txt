**Extracting Necessary Statements for Parameter Construction:**

To reach the definition, we extract \( v \), which contains all the statements required to construct the parameters at the entry point. This is achieved by computing a backward slice through the System Dependence Graph (SDG) in reverse. 

It is important to note that while there is typically only one organ (the main class or function), there may be multiple veins (paths or methods) to choose from. However, only one vein is necessary for the transplantation process. During the traversal of the SDG, class definitions that are already present in the host (such as system packages like `android` and `java`) are excluded.

For example, if we are dealing with an `Activity` feature where the variable `intent` references the target `Activity`, we might extract the invocation `startActivity(intent)` (as the entry point \( L_0 \)), along with the class implementation of the `Activity` itself.

**Transplantation Approach:**

Our approach is generic and can be used to transplant malicious code into a benign app, although this would require a dataset with annotated lines of malicious code. For practical reasons and clarity, this section focuses on adding benign code parts to a malicious app.

**Problem-Space Constraints and Threat Model:**

- **Features (\(\eta\))**: The features to be considered include side effects, search strategy, plausibility, preprocessing, and robustness.
- **Side Effects (Search Strategy \(\Pi\))**: None explicitly discussed, but camera and illumination robustness are considered.
- **Plausibility (\(\Lambda\))**: The perturbation is constrained (\(||\delta||_p \leq \delta_{max}\)) to ensure imperceptibility and legitimacy.
- **Preprocessing (Robustness)**: The image should not trivially become another human's image, and human subjects should retain their original identity.
- **Perturbation Constraints**:
  - **Smooth Pixel Perturbation**: Constrained (\(||\delta||_p \leq \delta_{max}\)) to look plausible and resemble white background noise.
  - **Noise Addition**: Constrained (\(d_{Bx}(\delta) \leq d_{B_{max}}\)) to be robust against compression.
  - **Point-Wise Perturbation**: Constrained to ensure the changes are imperceptible and legitimate.

These constraints ensure that the changes are subtle and maintain the semantic integrity of the original content.
