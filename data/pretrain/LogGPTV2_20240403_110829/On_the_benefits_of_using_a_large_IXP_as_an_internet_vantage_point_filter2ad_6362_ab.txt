### Role of the IXP as a Local and Global Player

The IXP in question plays a unique role, being both a local and global player. This is evident from the significant amount of traffic that is exchanged over its public switching fabric. Specifically, we are interested in understanding whether the IXP's local importance for the larger geographic region it serves is more or less reflected when considering peering or server-related traffic. 

To explore this, Table 2 (not shown) presents the top-10 countries in terms of the percentage of IP addresses and associated traffic, as well as the percentage of server IPs and their associated traffic. Additionally, it lists the top-10 networks. The data indicates that the IXP's role becomes more dominant for the European region when we shift from peering to server-related traffic. However, there are still strong signs of the IXP's global influence, particularly with respect to the commercial Internet, as seen in the relative importance of traffic from countries like the USA, Russia, and China, and ASes such as Akamai (AS20940), Google (AS15169), and VKontakte (AS47541).

### Simplified Illustration of the IXP’s Dual Role

To illustrate the IXP’s dual role, we categorize all actively routed ASes into three disjoint sets: A(L), A(M), and A(G). 
- **A(L)**: Member ASes of the IXP.
- **A(M)**: ASes that are one AS-hop away from a member AS.
- **A(G)**: All other ASes, which are two or more AS-hops away from member ASes.

Intuitively, A(L) captures the IXP’s local importance, while A(G) reflects its global role, with A(M) representing an intermediate category. Table 3 shows the breakdown of IPs, prefixes, and ASes for peering and Web server-related traffic across these three sets. The data confirms that there is a general trend towards A(L) as we move from IPs and peering traffic to server IPs and their traffic. While the economic sense of the IXP’s local role over its global role in the context of server-related traffic is well-captured, in reality, there may be significant overlap between the sets due to remote peerings, IXP resellers, and non-European networks joining the IXP for economic reasons. Nonetheless, this does not invalidate our findings regarding the IXP’s dual role.

### 3.3 On the IXP’s “Blind Spots”

While the IXP provides visibility into much of the Internet, measurements taken at this single vantage point have limitations. Understanding what we can discern about the network, and what we cannot, is crucial.

In Section 3.1, we use an essentially orthogonal IXP-external dataset (HTTP and DNS logs from a large European Tier-1 ISP) to indirectly assess how the approximately 1.5 million server IPs seen at the IXP in a given week compare to the unknown number of server IPs network-wide. We also discuss additional examples where IXP-external data, either from publicly available measurements, active or passive measurements, or proprietary information, helps us check, validate, or refine our understanding based solely on IXP measurements.

For instance, using the list of the top 1 million websites from Alexa, we recover about 20% of all second-level domains on Alexa’s top-1M list; this increases to 63% for the top-10K and 80% for the top-1K. Many hostnames on these lists are dynamic or ephemeral. To identify additional server IPs, we perform active measurements using DNS queries to the uncovered domains with a set of 25,000 DNS resolvers across 12,000 ASes. This results in approximately 600,000 server IPs, of which more than 360,000 are already seen at the IXP and identified as servers.

The remaining 240,000 server IPs that are not seen as servers at the IXP can be classified into four categories:
1. **Private Clusters**: CDNs hosted inside an AS, serving only clients within that AS.
2. **Geographically Distant Servers**: CDNs or cloud/hosting providers located far from the IXP.
3. **Invalid URI Handlers**: Servers operated by some ASes to handle invalid URIs.
4. **Small Organizations/Universities**: Servers in geographically distant regions, typically not visible at the IXP.

The first two categories account for more than 40% of the 240,000 unseen servers.

### Example: Akamai

As a concrete example, consider Akamai. In our week-long IXP dataset, we observe around 28,000 server IPs for Akamai in 278 ASes. However, Akamai publicly states that it operates approximately 100,000 servers in more than 1,000 ASes. The reasons for this discrepancy are twofold:
1. **Private Clusters**: Akamai operates private clusters in many third-party networks, which are generally not visible outside those ASes.
2. **Geographical Localization**: Akamai uses sophisticated mechanisms to localize traffic, making it difficult to detect its footprint in regions far from the IXP.

By performing diligently chosen IXP-external active measurements, we were able to discover about 100,000 servers in 700 ASes. Thus, even for a challenging case like Akamai, understanding the limitations and underlying reasons for what our IXP-internal data can and cannot tell us is feasible.

### Summary

By analyzing the traffic that traverses the physical infrastructure of one of the largest IXPs in Europe, we provide evidence that large European IXPs such as AMS-IX, DE-CIX, and LINX represent global Internet vantage points. They see traffic from hundreds of millions of IPs, almost all routed prefixes, and all routed ASes, and from virtually every country around the world. These IXPs play a dual role as both global and local players within the Internet ecosystem, but their use as global vantage points comes with caveats, such as having "blind spots."

### 4. STABLE YET CHANGING

#### 4.1 Stability in the Face of Constant Growth

Publicly available data shows that during 2012, the IXP experienced significant growth, increasing the number of member ASes by 75 and seeing the average daily traffic volume grow by 0.1%. In week 35, there were 443 IXP member ASes sending an average daily traffic volume of 11.9 PB. By week 51, the member count stood at 457, and the average traffic volume increased to 14.5 PB/day. The newly added member ASes are typically regional and local ISPs or organizations and small companies outside central Europe, for whom membership at this IXP makes economic sense. Major content providers, CDNs, web hosting companies, eyeball ASes, and Tier-1 ISPs have been members for some time but may have upgraded to higher port speeds.

Given our focus on the commercial Internet and knowing that server-related traffic is more than 70% of the peering traffic seen at the IXP, our longitudinal analysis reveals a stable picture of the commercial Internet. Each week, we see server-related traffic from about 20,000 (i.e., about half of all) actively routed ASes, approximately 75,000 (or 15%) of all actively routed prefixes, and a pool of server IPs whose absolute size changes slightly but tends to increase over the long term.

Figure 4(a) illustrates this stability, showing the weekly churn in server IPs. The first bar represents the approximately 1.4 million unique server IPs seen in week 35. Subsequent bars split this into portions seen in previous weeks and new server IPs. A key takeaway is that about 30% of server IPs are seen at the IXP week-in and week-out, contributing to around 60% of the server-related traffic each week.

Figure 4(b) breaks down the server IPs by geographic region (DE, US, RU, CN, RoW) and shows the stability and recurrence of server IPs in each region. Figure 4(c) shows similar churn for ASes, with a stable pool of ASes (about 70%) compared to the 30% for server IPs.

#### 4.2 Changes in the Face of Significant Stability

Despite the overall stability, we observe some changes in the weekly snapshots. For example, the use of HTTPS is steadily increasing, as evidenced by a small but steady rise in the number of HTTPS server IPs and their associated traffic. Another example is the recent expansion of Netflix using Amazon’s EC2 cloud service into Scandinavian countries, which we observed through a pronounced increase in the number of server IPs at Amazon EC2’s Ireland location and a corresponding increase in traffic.

We also detected the impact of regional events, such as Hurricane Sandy, which caused a significant reduction in the number of server IPs seen from the US East Coast region. Lastly, we observed the emergence of resellers, which extend the reach of the IXP into geographically distant regions, attracting new networks with significant server-based infrastructures.

### 5. BEYOND THE AS-LEVEL VIEW

#### 5.1 Alternative Grouping of Server IPs

To better understand the IXP’s visibility into the Internet, we group server IPs by the organization or company that has administrative control over them. This approach is necessary because some Internet players, such as low-cost CDNs or one-click hosting services, do not have assigned ASNs and are thus invisible in the traditional AS-level view.

Our clustering process involves three steps:
1. **First Category**: Group server IPs where the SOA of the hostname and the authority of the URI lead to the same entry (e.g., Amazon, Akamai, Google).
2. **Second Category**: Group server IPs where most of the server IPs and content are managed by the same authority, even if the SOA is outsourced (e.g., Hostica).
3. **Third Category**: Group remaining server IPs with partial SOA information using the same heuristic as in the second step.

Validation of our clustering shows a small false-positive rate of less than 3%, with the false-positive rate decreasing as the network footprint increases.

#### 5.2 New Reality: ASes are Heterogeneous

Equipped with our clustering approach, we examine the extent to which this grouping is orthogonal to the traditional AS-level view. The traditional view assumes homogeneity within ASes, but the current reality is more heterogeneous, with distributed network infrastructures deployed and operated by commercial Internet players.

Applying our clustering to the 1.5 million server IPs seen in week 45, we identified about 21,000 clusters (organizations or companies). Prominent players include Akamai with 28,000 active server IPs, Google with 11,500 server IPs, and several large hosters with more than 50,000 server IPs each. Of the 21,000 identified organizations, 143 have more than 1,000 server IPs, and more than 6,000 have more than 10 server IPs.

Figure 6(b) shows a scatter plot of the number of server IPs per organization versus the number of ASes they cover, illustrating the heterogeneity of ASes and the distributed nature of server-based infrastructures.

### Conclusion

By focusing on the Web server-related portion of the IXP traffic and performing a longitudinal analysis over a 17-week period, we observe significant stability. About 30% of the server IPs are seen week-in and week-out, contributing to around 60% of the server-related traffic. At the same time, the traffic seen at the IXP exhibits differences from one week to the next, providing insights into various changes in the network. The IXP’s role as a global vantage point, while valuable, comes with the caveat of having "blind spots."
