Arkansas designated Little Rock as its metropolitan area (area), which includes Pulaski County and the cities 
of Cammack Village, Jacksonville, Little Rock, Maumelle, North Little Rock, Shannon Hills, Sherwood, and 
Wrightsville.  
Governance: Advanced Implementation 
The Little Rock Metropolitan Area Working Group developed the Tactical Interoperable Communications 
(TICP) and includes operations and technical subcommittees for interoperable communications.  The area 
has exclusively formal agreements (e.g., mutual aid agreement with State Emergency Management 
Department) among public safety organizations, and a review process in place to regularly update these 
agreements every 3 to 5 years.  Although strategic planning efforts have been underway since 1996, the area 
does not yet have a published strategic plan for regional interoperability.  Through a locally funded bond and 
federal and state grants, jurisdictions procure equipment and develop budgets with consideration for the 
regional interoperability;  fiscal priorities have been clearly articulated in area’s municipal bond.  In addition 
to federal grant monies, the area is consistently awarded several state grants, and a voter-approved bond 
program is in place to fund communications interoperability equipment, training, and operations.  The senior 
level leaders in the area serve as interoperability advocates and act to ensure continued political and fiscal 
support.  
Recommendations: 
• 
Reference all applicable agreements (e.g., memoranda of understanding, intergovernmental agreements) 
in the TICP and store them in an accessible format 
• 
Develop, document, and implement a regional strategic plan (beyond the operational TICP) with 
participant approval, adoption, and acceptance, that takes into account a long-term communications 
funding strategy (beyond grants) 
• 
Align local and state strategic planning efforts to ensure that regional interoperability needs are met 
• 
Define funding strategy for regional sustainable funding sources (beyond bonds and grants) to cover 
lifecycle and recurring costs to operate the area’s interoperability assets

The Little Rock TICP consolidated the existing interoperable communications SOPs (e.g., state and local 
mutual aid agreements) into a regional plan.  Since these SOPs were already well established and used 
frequently, the public safety agencies in the area were well positioned to adopt the TICP.  The TICP has been 
disseminated to dispatch centers, but not to all included agencies in the area.  In the TICP validation exercise, 
despite a minor issue with radio channel designation, the area was largely successful in the use of its 
documented procedures.  The Little Rock area has adopted National Incident Management System 
(NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS) and has been implementing it within the last year.  During the 
exercise, participants successfully demonstrated familiarity with NIMS/ICS (e.g., unambiguous designation

Recommendations: 
• 
Develop regional training policies and requirements for inclusion in the TICP 
• 
Ensure consistent reference in the TICP regarding “NIMS is recommended” and “NIMS is required”

The area frequently uses its interoperable communications solutions (i.e., shared channels and shared 
systems) frequently for task force and mutual aid incidents.  Additionally, officials in the area report 
proficiency during real-world events (e.g., use of shared channels during river rescues).  During the TICP 
validation exercise, the participants were able to establish interoperable communications despite some 
minimal technical difficulty (e.g., inconsistent naming conventions for shared channels caused confusion).  
While the exercise met the stated requirements, it did not provide the opportunity to demonstrate 
interoperable communications with federal agencies in the area.  The area is encouraged to build on its local 
exercise success by further integrating state, federal, and support agencies in future events. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Continue to involve state and federal agencies (e.g., State Police, Federal Bureau of Investigation) in 
day-to-day events and future exercises  
• 
Consider adding interoperable communications as an evaluation component for all future exercises and 
day-to-day activities

Technology Overview    
The area has one 800 megahertz, Motorola communications system that is shared by most agencies.  However, 
interoperable talk groups have yet to be programmed into all radios, and different disciplines and jurisdictions have 
different profiles.  No gateways are available, and the primary means of interoperable communications currently 
consists of shared conventional channels (e.g., National Public Safety Planning Advisory Committee channels and 
Hospital Emergency Administrative Radio channels). 
The Little Rock area is adding talk groups to its fleet map to increase interoperability.  Plans at the state level are 
unknown, although personnel from both the state and Little Rock have participated in the TICP validation exercises to 
gain insight into interoperability options and procedures.

Connecticut’s Region 1 Communications Working Group reports to the Emergency Support Function II 
communications subcommittee, and includes local, state, and federal agencies within the area (e.g., 
transportation, public health, state police, U.S. Coast Guard, Federal Bureau of Investigation).  Although it is 
still early in the regional coordination process, the Region 1 is taking steps toward formalizing partnerships 
and written agreements (e.g., memorandum of understanding [MOU]) among the area’s organizations.  The 
area has been involved in strategic planning efforts but does not yet have a formalized strategic plan for 
regional interoperable communications, which prevents their alignment to collective, regional interoperable 
communications goals.  Through both local resources and federal grants, organizations within the area 
develop their budgets and procure equipment with consideration for interoperability across the area; 
sustainable funding for interoperability solutions though has not been defined.  The leadership in the Region 
1 appears to be providing the needed level of political and fiscal support for regional interoperable 
communications; the governor has issued an executive order for interoperability, and some local financial 
resources have been dedicated to funding interoperability equipment and solutions. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Establish the Region 1 Communications Working Group through a formal charter and document roles 
and responsibilities of all participating agencies as part of the group 
• 
Reference by date, title, or document number, all applicable agreements (e.g., MOUs, intergovernmental 
agreements) in the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP) and store them in an accessible 
format 
• 
Document and formalize agreements (e.g., signed MOUs with defined roles and responsibilities) among 
all participating agencies relating to regional interoperability 
• 
Establish a regular review process to ensure that agreements remain current and relevant 
• 
Develop, document, and implement a regional strategic plan (beyond the operational TICP) with 
participant approval, adoption, and acceptance, that takes into account a long-term communications 
funding strategy (beyond grants) 
• 
Align local and state strategic planning efforts to ensure that regional interoperability needs are met 
• 
Initiate the development and implementation of a regional approach to long-term (e.g. 3 to 5 years) 
sustainable funding that is consistent with the strategic plan

TICP.  The area has taken steps to disseminate these SOPs (e.g., distributed to all included organizations and 
dispatch centers, held the TICP Implementation Workshop) to also ensure their swift adoption.  During the 
TICP validation exercise overall, participants were able to demonstrate familiarity in executing their SOPs, 
but experienced a few minor procedural problems.  The Region 1 began implementing National Incident 
Management System (NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS) less than 1 year ago, which implies that the 
area is still in the earlier stages of implementing NIMS/ICS policies and procedures.  Despite the short time 
frame for implementation, the area has included both first responders and other public safety organizations 
(e.g., public health) in the implementation and training.  During the exercise, participants were able to 
demonstrate familiarity with NIMS/ICS, but did not demonstrate proficiency in all areas reviewed during the 
exercise (e.g., ICS Form 205 not distributed). 
Recommendations: 
• 
Update the TICP to incorporate all available interoperable communications equipment (e.g., 
inconsistencies with gateways in the TICP) 
• 
Continue to regularly review and update policies and procedures 
• 
Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (include communications unit 
implementation consistent with the TICP) to ensure that all participating first responder agencies attain

The Region 1 reports regular use of its available means of interoperable communications (e.g., shared 
channels, gateways, shared systems) in day-to-day operations.  Additionally, officials in the area reported 
demonstrated success during real-world events in the area (e.g., multijurisdictional pursuit of a suspect).  
During the TICP validation exercise, evaluators indicated that Region 1 responders did a “good job” of 
establishing tactical interoperable communications between both local and regional responders.  However, 
during the exercise users did not understand the limitations of their shared channels.    
Recommendations: 
• 
Regularly test and exercise deployment of regional interoperability resources to improve proficiency 
(e.g., radio cache, shared channels) 
• 
Consider adding interoperable communications as an evaluation component for all future exercises and 
day-to-day activities

Fairfield County consists of 14 towns and cities with at least 26 different public safety radio systems.  The only 
interoperability among public safety agencies in the area is the 800 megahertz (MHz) ITAC/ICALL channels and the 
Statewide Tactical On-Scene Communication System (STOCS).  STOCS, which provides shared channels across the 
very high frequency, ultra high frequency, and 800 MHz bands, had not been fully implemented at the time of the TICP 
validation exercise. 
The State of Connecticut is planning on implementing STOCS in all counties.  Region 1 is planning to continue training 
on and using the ITAC/ICALL channels as well as gateways and other interoperability solutions throughout Region 1 
and the rest of the state.

Wilmington’s Tactical Interoperable Communication Plan (TICP) was expanded to cover the state as a whole 
rather than one metropolitan area.  This is consistent with the statewide communications infrastructure, as 
well as the governance structure that was established by the Governor 3 years ago.  This governance group is 
known as the “Next Generation Committee” and is composed of state and local agencies from all first 
responder disciplines, as well as additional public support services.  The group has a charter with active rules 
and agreements in place, and has stressed the importance of interoperability by creating funding strategies 
through 2008.  Although Wilmington has developed a strategic plan that covers the entire state, it has not yet 
been fully adopted by all participating organizations, and it is not reviewed/updated annually.  Having a 
published strategy will help ensure statewide compliance with the plan as public safety and state 
organizations continue to move toward achieving communications interoperability.   
Recommendations: 
• 
Suggest continuing to proactively recruit other members that need to be part of the group, including 
federal participants that are present in the area (e.g., U.S. Coast Guard) 
• 
Encourage full adoption of the strategic plan with acceptance from all participants, and with reviews and  
updates on an annual basis 
• 
Encourage a regional communications interoperability funding strategy, including long-term (e.g., 3 to 5 
years) funding sources (in addition to grants)

Wilmington had pre-existing SOPs, primarily for its two major 800 megahertz (MHz) systems, which were 
incorporated in the TICP.  As a result, the TICP was expanded to cover all three counties in the state.  These 
policies have begun to be disseminated, and Wilmington is in the process of incorporating the TICP into the 
Delaware Emergency Operations Plan and as a requirement in all exercises.  It was noted at the TICP 
validation exercise that plain language was not used at the incident.  Delaware is also in the process of 
implementing National Incident Management System (NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS) and the 
Communications Unit Leader duties.  As detailed in its post-exercise Improvement Plan, gaps in these areas 
(e.g., plain language not used) will be addressed through additional training and exercises.  For example, it 
was noted at the TICP validation exercise that there was a lack of unified command at the incident, and two 
separate, distinct incident command structures were in place.  These instances illustrate opportunities for 
training to improve communications command and control.  According to the After Action Report, 
Delaware’s “public service agencies have a solid foundation in their approach to emergencies and they know 
their plan and procedures well.”  The state’s team approach, including the city and county agencies, is 
commendable, and should be considered a best practice.

Wilmington achieves communications interoperability through a shared system and fixed gateways.  
However, to more fluently use the mobile gateway system, additional training is needed.  The majority of 
agencies are using the state’s 800 MHz statewide shared system, which provides interoperability on a daily 
basis.  The use of these systems was successfully demonstrated during the TICP validation exercise, allowing 
local and regional first responders to communicate with each other effectively.  The exercise evaluators 
indicate that because of technical failures that impeded the proper implementation of the mobile command 
center equipment, additional training was needed to operate the state’s mobile gateways.  The gateways 
would likely be necessary to support federal agencies or responders from other states during a large scale 
incident. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Continue to conduct training on available technology (e.g., mobile gateway system) to improve 
familiarity with the capability and work toward seamless integration 
• 
Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises

caches (five in the 800 MHz band, and one in the ultra high frequency band), and has three types of gateway devices 
available for use.  Statewide communications interoperability is also supported by the use of the five National Public 
Safety Planning Advisory Committee frequencies.
