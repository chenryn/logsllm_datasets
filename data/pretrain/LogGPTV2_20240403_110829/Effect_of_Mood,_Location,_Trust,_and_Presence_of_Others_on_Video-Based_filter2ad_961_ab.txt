measure participants’ trust in each group member. Trust was
categorized as low, medium, or high using the same scale.
3.3.3 Procedure
Before the formal study, we used text explanations and a
mock-up to simulate the authentication process and to help
participants differentiate video-based social authentication
from general video chat. Participants were instructed that
they should think of the system as a way to recover accounts,
rather than for primary authentication or general video chat.
Participants were also instructed to provide the perceived
willingness to use such authentication.
Participants agreed to receive SMS text messages from the
researchers for the duration of the study and to respond via
their mobile phone’s web browser. Participants received two
or three prompts per day over the four-week period between
the hours of 9 AM and 9 PM. This resulted in 72 SMS prompts
per participant over the four-week period.
Each SMS prompt signaled participants to ﬁll out a re-
sponse form about their perceived willingness to do a video
authentication at that moment. There are two types of prompts:
initiate and help. For an initiate prompt, participants were in-
formed that they needed to initiate a video chat to gain access
to one of the apps on their phone. The app and its sensitivity
were selected based on participants’ responses in the pre-
survey. If a participant was willing to initiate a video chat
for authentication, then the participant was asked to select
one person from the six-person group (with six avatars pre-
sented, collected from the pre-survey) to send a video-based
authentication request. For a help prompt, participants were
informed that they were being asked to help one person (with
an avatar presented, collected from the pre-survey) from the
six-person group to gain access to an app via a video chat.
The image of the avatar was used to simulate a video-based
social authentication call, just as people would see each other
in a video chat.
Participants received one initiate SMS and one help SMS
per day. In addition, four times a week, they received an addi-
tional initiate or help SMS. Thus, each participant received
nine initiate SMS and nine help SMS messages per week. To
address the possibility of the time of day being an important
factor of the willingness to initiate or help [63, 71], we wrote
a program to randomly determine a time of day during the
morning (9:00 AM – 11:59 AM), afternoon (1:30 PM – 4:29
PM), or evening (6:00 PM – 8:59 PM). Thus, each partici-
pant received six SMS messages in the morning, afternoon,
and evening, respectively. We randomized the time points
with rules since, in a real-world scenario, a video-based social
authentication request could also happen at any time. Upon re-
ceiving an SMS, each participant was prompted to click a link
in the SMS to take the ESM questionnaire. In the question-
naire, participants were given the option to decline or accept
a video-based authentication (initiate or help). We then asked
the reasons for the accept or decline decision. In the question-
naire, we also asked about participants’ mood, location, and
the presence of other people. Note that we did not ask partici-

pants to do any real video chatting or authentication. Instead,
we simulated the real video-based authentication scenario
and asked for participants’ perceived willingness to initiate
or help with authentication via a video chat. As participants
may not see the ESM questionnaires until later, participants
were instructed, “If you do not see a text until later, respond
to the survey based on what you were doing and how you
were feeling at the time the text came to your phone, NOT
when you saw it.”
Overall, during the four-week period, 72 (2 types of request
(initiate or help) × 9 per week × 4 weeks) SMS messages
were scheduled to be sent to each participant. This resulted
in 2,160 SMS messages in total. Due to human errors or
technical issues, 1,992 SMS messages were successfully sent
and received by participants. The human errors or technical
issues stemmed from two issues: 1) manual typing issues from
research assistants and 2) SMS delivery issues on participants’
phones. An example interface of the ESM prompt can be
found in Figure 1. The entire ESM questionnaire can be found
in Appendix C.
3.3.4 Reasons to agree
The following options were provided for participants to
choose from: Length of time we’ve known each other; What I
know about them; I know I would recognize them effectively;
They are responsive when I ask them to help me; We have
lots of friends in common; We don’t have many friends in
common; I would want additional contact with them; I think
they are attractive. We also provided an “other” option for par-
ticipants to manually enter a response in a text box if needed.
Note that some of the options provided were adapted from
the pilot study (see Section 3.5).
3.3.5 Reasons to decline
The following options were provided for participants to
choose from: I’m busy; I don’t want to; I’m not in a loca-
tion that could use video chat; I’m having network issues
(e.g., no wi-ﬁ, over data usage); I’m having technical issues
(e.g., phone is broken, camera won’t work); I don’t trust any-
one in my network. We also provided an “other” option for
participants to manually enter a response in a text box, if
needed.
3.3.6 Mood
Mood was assessed via the Brief Mood Introspection Scale
(BMIS) [65]. BMIS allows us to compute a standard com-
posite pleasantness score. The BMIS pleasant-unpleasant
composite includes 16 items, and each item is measured by a
four-point Likert scale [64]. We used this assessment to see
if mood played a factor in people’s willingness to accept or
decline a video-based social authentication.

3.3.7 Location
Location was assessed via a question in the ESM question-
naire, which gathered where participants were when they were
responding. The following options were provided to partici-
pants: at home, at work, at school, driving a vehicle, riding
in a vehicle, and some other public location (e.g., a coffee
shop, a grocery store). We also provided an “other” option
for participants to manually enter a response in a text box,
if needed. Because the SMS prompts were random, we had
no idea where participants would be when they received the
prompts. We asked participants to respond to the prompt as
soon as they safely could, not while driving.
3.3.8 Presence of other people
Presence of other people was assessed via a question in the
ESM questionnaire regarding whether the participants were
around other people when they were responding. The follow-
ing options were provided to participants: “No, I’m alone”,
“Yes, I know most or all of those around me”, and “Yes, but I
don’t know most or any of those around me”.
3.4 Post-survey
The post-survey (see Appendix B) had nine questions. First,
we asked what type of mobile phone each participant used
in the study. Then, we asked about participants’ comfort
(adapted from [52]) with video chat in general and their com-
fort with the idea of seeking identiﬁcation from another per-
son through video chat. Then, we asked participants which
person from their group they prefer to have authenticate their
identity and why they prefer that person. Finally, we asked
three questions about their opinions on asking or giving help
for video-based authentication. We closed the post-survey by
asking participants for any additional comments about the
study.
3.5 Pilot Study
We conducted a pilot study with ten participants for ﬁve days.
During that period, we were able to test the procedure and
ﬁx technical issues related to sending and receiving SMS
messages. Some of the response options we provided in the
formal study were also adopted from the pilot study (e.g.,
“We don’t have many friends in common” and “I think they’re
attractive” for agreeing to help.)
3.6 Ethical Considerations
The entire research protocol was IRB approved. Each partici-
pant read and signed the consent form before the study. All
the participants volunteered to participate in the study and
understood that they could withdraw from the study at any
point without consequence. We told participants about the
potential risks and beneﬁts of taking part in this study and
documented these on the consent form. The potential risks
we noted were minimal and did not exceed the activities of
everyday life, such as using a mobile phone to video chat. One
potential risk we noted was that ﬁlling out survey questions
about mood may cause participants to think about negative
emotional states. To avoid disturbing participants’ sleep, we
decided to limit ESM prompts to 9 AM through 9 PM. We
emphasized that all user data collected was to be kept strictly
conﬁdential. Only members of the research team had access
to it, and the data was only used in this work.

Table 5: Responses to the video chat request for authentica-
tion, split by request type (Including non-responses)
phone users. Also in Section 4.2, we report the sensitivity of
these mobile apps rated by our participants. In Section 4.3, we
present the response rate and the average response time of the
ESM questionnaires. Since not all the ESM questionnaires got
responded to, in the following Section 4.4, we interpret the
rate of agreeing or denying the video chat for authentication in
two approaches: excluding and including the non-responses.
In Section 4.5 and Section 4.6, we present the results of
the predictors that inﬂuence the perceived willingness to use
video chat as an authentication method. We found that trust of
others, the presence of others, location, and mood had notable
effects on the perceived willingness to use such an authenti-
cation mechanism (see Table 6 and Table 7 for details). We
analyzed the results using repeated-measures logistic regres-
sions with Generalized Linear Mixed-effects Models, which
ﬁts the experience sampling methods we used. To under-
stand the effects of different values of each parameter, we
conducted Tukey’s post-hoc tests to adjust p values to account
for family-wise errors [86]. Given the sample size and the
effect size (odds ratio) we reported in the paper, we calcu-
lated the post-hoc power (all above 0.8), which means we
had enough participants. The following predictors were used
in the repeated-measures logistic regressions (for categorical
predictors, we selected the most normative category as the
baseline):
• the sensitivity of apps (for initiate); ordinal (low;
medium; high)
• trust in person (for help); ordinal (low; medium; high)
• location; categorical (at home; at work; at school; driving
a vehicle; riding in a vehicle; some other public location
