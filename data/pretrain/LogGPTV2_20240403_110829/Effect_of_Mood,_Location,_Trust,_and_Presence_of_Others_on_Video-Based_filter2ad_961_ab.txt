### 3.3.3 Procedure

Before the formal study, we used text explanations and a mock-up to simulate the authentication process, helping participants differentiate video-based social authentication from general video chat. Participants were instructed to consider the system as a method for account recovery rather than primary authentication or general video chat. They were also asked to provide their perceived willingness to use such an authentication method.

Participants agreed to receive SMS text messages from the researchers during the study and to respond via their mobile phone’s web browser. Over a four-week period, each participant received two or three prompts per day between 9 AM and 9 PM, resulting in 72 SMS prompts per participant.

Each SMS prompt directed participants to complete a response form about their willingness to perform a video authentication at that moment. There were two types of prompts: "initiate" and "help." For an "initiate" prompt, participants were informed they needed to initiate a video chat to gain access to one of their apps. The app and its sensitivity were based on participants' responses in the pre-survey. If willing, participants selected one person from a six-person group (with avatars presented, collected from the pre-survey) to send a video-based authentication request. For a "help" prompt, participants were informed they were being asked to help one person (with an avatar presented, collected from the pre-survey) from the six-person group to gain access to an app via a video chat. The image of the avatar simulated a video-based social authentication call.

Participants received one "initiate" SMS and one "help" SMS per day, plus an additional "initiate" or "help" SMS four times a week. Thus, each participant received nine "initiate" and nine "help" SMS messages per week. To address the potential impact of the time of day on willingness, we programmed the system to randomly determine the time of day for sending SMS messages (morning: 9:00 AM – 11:59 AM, afternoon: 1:30 PM – 4:29 PM, evening: 6:00 PM – 8:59 PM). Each participant received six SMS messages in the morning, afternoon, and evening, respectively. Upon receiving an SMS, participants clicked a link to complete the ESM questionnaire, where they could accept or decline a video-based authentication and provide reasons for their decision. The questionnaire also inquired about participants' mood, location, and the presence of other people. We did not require participants to engage in actual video chatting or authentication; instead, we simulated the scenario and asked for their perceived willingness.

Participants were instructed, "If you do not see a text until later, respond to the survey based on what you were doing and how you were feeling at the time the text came to your phone, NOT when you saw it."

Overall, during the four-week period, 72 SMS messages (2 types of requests × 9 per week × 4 weeks) were scheduled for each participant, totaling 2,160 SMS messages. Due to human errors or technical issues, 1,992 SMS messages were successfully sent and received. These issues included manual typing errors by research assistants and SMS delivery problems on participants' phones. An example interface of the ESM prompt is shown in Figure 1, and the full ESM questionnaire can be found in Appendix C.

### 3.3.4 Reasons to Agree

Participants were provided with the following options to choose from:
- Length of time we’ve known each other
- What I know about them
- I know I would recognize them effectively
- They are responsive when I ask them to help me
- We have lots of friends in common
- We don’t have many friends in common
- I would want additional contact with them
- I think they are attractive

An "other" option was also available for participants to manually enter a response if needed. Some of these options were adapted from the pilot study (see Section 3.5).

### 3.3.5 Reasons to Decline

Participants were provided with the following options to choose from:
- I’m busy
- I don’t want to
- I’m not in a location that could use video chat
- I’m having network issues (e.g., no Wi-Fi, over data usage)
- I’m having technical issues (e.g., phone is broken, camera won’t work)
- I don’t trust anyone in my network

An "other" option was also available for participants to manually enter a response if needed.

### 3.3.6 Mood

Mood was assessed using the Brief Mood Introspection Scale (BMIS) [65], which computes a standard composite pleasantness score. The BMIS pleasant-unpleasant composite includes 16 items, each measured on a four-point Likert scale [64]. This assessment helped us determine if mood influenced participants' willingness to accept or decline a video-based social authentication.

### 3.3.7 Location

Location was assessed through a question in the ESM questionnaire, asking where participants were when responding. The options provided were:
- At home
- At work
- At school
- Driving a vehicle
- Riding in a vehicle
- Some other public location (e.g., a coffee shop, a grocery store)

An "other" option was also available for participants to manually enter a response if needed. Since the SMS prompts were random, we had no prior knowledge of participants' locations. Participants were instructed to respond as soon as they safely could, not while driving.

### 3.3.8 Presence of Other People

The presence of other people was assessed through a question in the ESM questionnaire, asking whether participants were around other people when responding. The options provided were:
- No, I’m alone
- Yes, I know most or all of those around me
- Yes, but I don’t know most or any of those around me

### 3.4 Post-Survey

The post-survey (see Appendix B) consisted of nine questions. First, we asked about the type of mobile phone each participant used in the study. Next, we inquired about participants' comfort with video chat in general and their comfort with the idea of seeking identification from another person through video chat. We then asked which person from their group they preferred to authenticate their identity and why. Finally, we asked three questions about their opinions on asking for or giving help for video-based authentication. The post-survey concluded with a request for any additional comments about the study.

### 3.5 Pilot Study

We conducted a pilot study with ten participants over five days to test the procedure and resolve technical issues related to sending and receiving SMS messages. Some response options in the formal study were adopted from the pilot study (e.g., "We don’t have many friends in common" and "I think they’re attractive" for agreeing to help).

### 3.6 Ethical Considerations

The entire research protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB). Each participant read and signed the consent form before the study. All participants volunteered and understood they could withdraw at any point without consequence. We informed participants about the potential risks and benefits of participating, documenting these on the consent form. The potential risks were minimal and did not exceed everyday activities like using a mobile phone for video chat. One noted risk was that filling out survey questions about mood might cause participants to think about negative emotional states. To avoid disturbing participants' sleep, ESM prompts were limited to 9 AM through 9 PM. We emphasized that all user data collected would be kept strictly confidential, accessible only to the research team and used solely for this work.

### 4 Findings

#### 4.1 Overview of Participants

We first provide an overview of our 30 participants in Section 4.1. In Section 4.2, we report the mobile app usage self-reported by our participants, showing that they use similar mobile apps to many other mobile users. We also report the sensitivity of these apps rated by our participants. In Section 4.3, we present the response rate and average response time of the ESM questionnaires. Since not all ESM questionnaires were responded to, in Section 4.4, we interpret the rate of agreeing or denying the video chat for authentication in two approaches: excluding and including non-responses.

In Sections 4.5 and 4.6, we present the results of the predictors that influence the perceived willingness to use video chat as an authentication method. We found that trust in others, the presence of others, location, and mood had notable effects on the perceived willingness to use such an authentication mechanism (see Table 6 and Table 7 for details). We analyzed the results using repeated-measures logistic regressions with Generalized Linear Mixed-effects Models, fitting the experience sampling methods we used. To understand the effects of different values of each parameter, we conducted Tukey’s post-hoc tests to adjust p-values for family-wise errors [86]. Given the sample size and effect size (odds ratio) reported, we calculated the post-hoc power (all above 0.8), indicating we had enough participants. The following predictors were used in the repeated-measures logistic regressions (for categorical predictors, the most normative category was selected as the baseline):

- Sensitivity of apps (for initiate); ordinal (low, medium, high)
- Trust in person (for help); ordinal (low, medium, high)
- Location; categorical (at home, at work, at school, driving a vehicle, riding in a vehicle, some other public location)
