Question: Consider a scenario where a web application serves as a middleman between users and a third-party payment service. The application allows users to forward payment requests to the service without adequately ensuring that the user's identity is maintained throughout the transaction. What might be the consequence of this design flaw?
"A": "The payment service may process transactions as if they originated from the web application itself, potentially allowing unauthorized users to bypass access controls.",
"B": "The web application will become more efficient as it reduces the overhead of identity management in payment transactions.",
"C": "Users will be able to authenticate more easily since the web application automatically forwards the payment request without identity checks.",
"D": "The payment service will reject all transactions because the identity of the initiator is not preserved, leading to a denial of service."
Answer: A
