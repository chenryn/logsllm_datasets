  "hibernate_flush_memory: buffer_cache_gc freed up 13202 wired pages",  "This log message pertains to a memory management process called \"Hibernate\". Hibernate is the process of saving the current state of the system onto a hard disk before powering off the system. This allows the system to resume its activities when it is turned back on. \n\nThe log message indicates that during this process, a component called \"buffer_cache_gc\" has released or freed up 13202 \"wired pages\". Wired pages are the parts of the memory that cannot be swapped out or paged to a disk. This is because these pages are essential to the system's operation and must always be available in memory.\n\nIn simple terms, this message means that the Hibernate process has freed up memory that was previously being used by non-essential components of the system, making those resources available for use by the essential components. This can improve the overall performance of the system."

  "Wake reason: ARPT (Network)",  "Wake reason: ARPT (Network) means that the system woke up from sleep mode due to network activity. This indicates that there was some kind of network activity that triggered the wake-up. This network activity could have been caused by an incoming message or data packet that the system received from the network. ARPT stands for Address Resolution Protocol Table, which is responsible for mapping the network address (IP address) to its corresponding hardware address. The ARPT table is used to store the MAC addresses of network devices. When a network device wants to communicate with another device, it uses the ARPT table to find the MAC address of the target device based on its IP address. Once the MAC address is found, the network device can send data packets to the target device. Therefore, when the system wakes up due to the ARPT wake reason, it means that some network device has requested data from the system, which has caused it to wake up."
