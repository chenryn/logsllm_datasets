A APPENDIX: CONCRETE EXAMPLE OF
DOSMELT’S OUTPUT
We illustrate 19 stalkerware apps detected by Dosmelt in Table 7,
along with the identified surveillance capabilities of these apps.
These surveillance capabilities are verified and confirmed by two
researchers in our team. The results of the nuanced surveillance
type attribution provide a concrete example of the precise warn-
ing information that can be extracted from Dosmelt’s output. The
first two columns in Table 7 are the app ids and the titles of the
detected stalkerware apps. The remaining columns correspond to
each one of the 14 surveillance types listed in our taxonomy (see
Table 1). The “X” marks in each row denote whether a stalkerware
app is equipped with a specific surveillance capability or not. For
example, the app in the first row, with the app id com.celphtr.rodes
and the title Cell Phone Tracker, has five different surveillance func-
tions at the same time: Call-Logs, Contacts, GPS-Tracking, SMS, and
Social-Media. From the table, we can have an intuitive understand-
ing about the multi-label nature of the nuanced surveillance type
attribution problem tackled in our study. A stalkerware app can
spy on the targeted device of victim using a variety of surveillance
functionalities.
