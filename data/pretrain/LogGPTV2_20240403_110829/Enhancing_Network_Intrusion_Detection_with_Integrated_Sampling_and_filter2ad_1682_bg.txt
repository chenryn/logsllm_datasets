penthes instance normally emulates a large number of vulnerabilities and thus
opens many TCP ports, an attacker could become suspicious during the recon-
naissance phase. Current automated malware does not check the plausibility of
the target, but future malware could do so. To mitigate this problem, the stealth-
iness can be improved by using only the vulnerability modules which belong to a
certain conﬁguration of a real system, e.g., only vulnerability modules which emu-
late vulnerabilities for Windows 2000 Service Pack 1. The tradeoﬀ lies in reduced
expressiveness and leads to fewer samples collected. A similar problem with the
stealthiness appears if the results obtained by running nepenthes are published
unmodiﬁed. To mitigate such a risk, we refer to the solution outlined in [16].
Moreover, nepenthes is not exhaustive in terms of analyzing which exploits a
particular piece of malware is targeting. This limitation is due to the fact that
we respond to an incoming exploitation attempt and can just react on these
network pakets. Once we have downloaded a binary executable of the malware,
static or dynamic analysis of this binary can overcome this limitation. This is,
however, out of the scope of the current nepenthes implementation.
3 Results
Vulnerability modules are one of the most important components of the whole
nepenthes architecture since they take care of the emulation process. At the
time of this writing, there are 21 vulnerability modules in total. Table 1 gives
an overview of selected available modules, including a reference to the related
security advisory or a brief summary of its function.

This selection of emulated vulnerabilities has proven to be suﬃcient to handle
most of the autonomous spreading malware we have observed in the wild. As
we show in the remainder of this section, these modules allows us to learn more
about the propagating malware. However, if a certain packet ﬂow cannot be han-
dled by any vulnerability module, all collected information is stored on hard disc
to facilitate later analysis. This allows us to detect changes in attack patterns,
is an indicator of new trends, and helps us to develop new modules. In case of
a 0day, i.e., an vulnerability for which no information is publicly available, this
can enable a fast analysis since the ﬁrst stages of the attack have already been
captured. As outlined in Section 2.3, this can also be extended to really handle
0day attacks. A drackback of this approach is that an attacker can send random
data to a network port and nepenthes will store this data on hard disc. This
can lead to a Denial-of-Service condition if the attacker sends large amount of
bogus network traﬃc, however we did not experience any problems up to now.
In addition, this problem can be mitigated by implementing upper bounds on
the amount of traﬃc stored on hard disk.
Developing a new vulnerability modules to emulate a novel security vulnera-
bility or to capture a propagating 0day exploit is a straightforward process and
demands only little eﬀort. On average, writing of less than 500 lines of C++ code
(including comments and blank lines) is required to implement the needed func-
tionality. This task can be carried out with some experience in a short amount
of time, sometimes only requiring a couple of minutes.

As an example, we want to present our experience with the recent Zotob worm:
in MS05-039, Microsoft announced a security vulnerability in the Plug and Play
service of Windows 2000 and Windows XP at August 09, 2005. This vulnerability
is rated critical for Windows 2000 since it allows remote code execution, resulting
in a remote system compromise. Two days later, a proof-of-concept exploit for this
vulnerability was released. This exploit code contains enough information to imple-
ment a vulnerability module for nepenthes, so that malware propagating with the
help of MS05-039 can be captured with this module. Without the proof-of-concept
exploit, it would have been possible to build a vulnerability module only based on
the information provided in the security advisory by Microsoft. But this process
would be more complex since it would require the development of an attack vector,
which could then be emulated as a vulnerability module. Nevertheless, this is fea-
sible. After all, attackers also implemented a proof-of-concept exploit solely on the
basis of the information in the security bulletin. Another three days after the release
of the proof-of-concept exploit – at August 14 – a worm named Zotob started to ex-
ploit this vulnerability in the wild. So only ﬁve days after the release of the security
advisory, the ﬁrst bot propagated with the help of this vulnerability. But at this
point in time, nepenthes was already capable of capturing such a worm. Similarly,
the process of emulating the vulnerability in Microsoft Distributed Transaction
Coordinator (MSDTC), published in Microsoft security bulletin MS05-051, took
only a small amount of time.
3.1 Scalability
In this section, we want to evaluate the scalability of the nepenthes platform.
With the help of several metrics we investigate, how eﬀective our approach is,
and how many honeypot systems we can emulate with our implementation.
As noted in [20], a “key factor to determine the scalability of a honeypot
is the number of honeypots required to handle the traﬃc from a particular IP
address range”. To cover a /16 network, a naive approach would be to install
over 64,000 honeypots to cover the whole network range. This would of course
be a waste of resources, since only a limited amount of IP addresses receives
network traﬃc at any given point in time. The low-interaction honeypot honeyd
is reported to be able to simulate a whole /16 network on just a single computer.
The expressiveness of this tool is low since it only emulates the TCP/IP stack
of an arbitrary operating system. In contrast to this, nepenthes is capable of
emulating several vulnerabilities at application level.
To evaluate the scalability of nepenthes, we have used the following setup: the
testbed is a commercial oﬀ-the-shelf (COTS) system with a 2.4GHz Pentium III,
2 GB of physical memory, and 100 MB Ethernet NIC running Debian Linux 3.0
and version 2.6.12 of the Linux kernel. This system runs nepenthes 0.1.5 in
default conﬁguration. This means that all 21 vulnerability modules are used,
resulting in a total of 29 TCP sockets on which nepenthes emulates vulnerable
services.
We tested the implementation with a varying number of emulated systems,
ranging from only 256 honeypots up to 32,000 emulated honeypots. For each
The Nepenthes Platform: An Eﬃcient Approach to Collect Malware
177
conﬁguration, we measured the number of established TCP connections, the
system load, and the memory consumption of nepenthes, for a time interval
of one hour. We repeated this measurement several times in diﬀerent order to
cancel out statistical unsteadiness. Such an unsteadiness could for example be
caused by diurnal properties of malware epidemics [5] or bursts in the network
traﬃc. The average value of all measurements is then an estimation of the spe-
ciﬁc metric we are interested in. Figures 3 (a) and (b) give an overview of
our results. In each ﬁgure, the x-axis represents the number of IP addresses
assigned to nepenthes running on the testbed machine. The y-axis reprents
the number of established TCP connections (a) and the average system load
(b), respectively. We forbear from plotting the memory consumption since it
is low (less than 20 MB for even a large number of simulated IP addresses),
and nearly independent from the number of established TCP connections. In
the ﬁrst ﬁgure we see that the scalability is nearly linear up to 8,192 IP ad-
dresses. This corresponds to the system load, which is below 1 (ﬁgure b). Af-
terwards, the number of established TCP connections is degreasing, which is
caused by a system load above 1, i.e., the system is fully occupied with I/O
operations.
In the following, we take a closer look at the long-time performance of the ne-
penthes platform emulating a whole /18 network, i.e., about 16,000 IP addresses.
We have this setup up and running for more then ﬁve months and it runs quite
stable. There are seldom kernel crashes, but these are caused by instabilities in
the Linux kernel handling such a large amount of IP addresses in parallel. Apart
from this, nepenthes itself is a mature system. To get an overview of the over-
all performance of this platform, we present some statistics on the performance
ﬁrst. In Figure 4 (a) we see the ﬁve minute average of established TCP connec-
tions for an instance of nepenthes running on a /18 network for 30 hours. The
number of established TCP connections is on average 796, with peaks of up to
1172. The lowest values are around 600 concurrent established connections, so
the volatitlity is rather high. Our experience shows that burst of more than 1300
concurrent established TCP connections are tolerable on this system. Even more
connections could be handled with better hardware: currently, the average load
of the system is slightly above 1, i.e., the processor is never idle. For a one hour
period, we observed more than 180,000 SYN packets, which could potentially be
handled by nepenthes.
Figure 4 (b) depicts the ﬁve minute average of network throughput. Green is
the amount of incoming traﬃc, with an average of 308.8 kB/s and a maximum
of 369.7 kB/s. The outgoing traﬃc is displayed with a blue line. The average of
outgoing traﬃc is 86.6 kB/s, whereas the peak lies at 105.4 kB/s. So despite a
rather high volatility in concurrent TCP connections, the network throughput
is rather stable.
We now take a closer look at the long-time performance of this nepenthes
instance regarding the download of new samples collected. A ﬁve week period is
the data foundation of the following statistics. Figure 5 depicts the daily number
of download attempts and successful downloads.

3.2 Statistics for Collected Malware
In this section, we analyze the malware we have collected with our honeynet
platform. Since nepenthes is optimized to collect malware in an automated way,
this is the vast amount of information we collect with the help of this tool. A
human attacker could also try to exploit our honeynet platform, but he would
presumably notice quickly that he is just attacking a low-interaction honeypot
since we only emulate the necessary parts of each vulnerable service and the
command shell only emulates the commands typically issued by malware. So
we concentrate on automated attacks and show how eﬀective and eﬃcient our
approach is.
With the help of the nepenthes platform, we are able to automatically collect
malware on a large-scale basis. We are running nepenthes in several diﬀerent
networks and centrally store the malware we have downloaded. Figure 5 (a) and
(b) show the cumulative number of download attempts and successful downloads

Fig. 5. Number of malware download attempts (a) and successful downloaded ﬁles (b)
for nepenthes running on a /18 network in a period of 33 hours
for a nepenthes platform assigned to a /18 network. Within about 33 hours, more
than 5.5 million exploitation attempts are eﬀectively handled by this system (see
Figure 5 (a)). That means that so often the download modules are triggered to
start a download. Often these download attempts fail, e.g., because the malware
tries to download a copy of itself from a server that is meanwhile taken down.
Figure 5 (b) depicts the number of successful download, i.e., nepenthes success-
fully download a piece of malware. Within these 33 hours, about 1.5 million
binaries are downloaded. Most of these binaries are duplicates, but nepenthes
has to issue a download and is only afterwards able to decide whether the binary
is actually a new one. In this particular period, we were able to download 508
new unique binaries.
In a four month period, we have collected more than 15,500 unique binaries,
corresponding to about 1,400 MB of data. Uniqueness in this context is based on
diﬀerent MD5 sums of the collected binaries. All of the ﬁles we have collected are

PE or MZ ﬁles, i.e., binaries targeting systems running Windows as operating
system. This is no surprise since nepenthes currently focuses on emulating only
vulnerabilities of Windows.
For the binaries we have collected, we found that about 7% of them are
broken, i.e., some part of the header- or body-structure is corrupted. Further
analysis showed that this is mainly caused by faulty propagation attempts. If
the malware for examples spreads further with the help of TFTP (Trivial File
Transfer Protocol), this transfer can be faulty since TFTP relies on the unreliable
UDP protocol. Furthermore, a download can lead to a corrupted binary if the
attacking station stops the infection process, e.g., because it is disconnected from
the Internet.
The remaining 14,414 binaries are analyzed with diﬀerent antivirus (AV) en-
gines. Since we know that each binary tried to propagate further, we can assume
that each binary is malicious. Thus a perfect AV engine should detect 100% of
these samples as malicious. However, we can show that the current signature-
based AV engines are far away from being perfect. Table 2 gives an overview of
the results we obtained with four diﬀerent AV engines. If we scan the whole set
of more than 14,000 binaries, we see that the results range between 80 and 90
%, thus all AV solutions are missing a signiﬁcant amount of malware. If we scan
only the latest ﬁles, i.e., ﬁles that we have captured within the last 24 hours, the
statistics get even worse. Table 2 gives also an overview of the detection rate for
460 unique ﬁles that were captured within 24 hours. We see that the detection
rates are lower compared to the overall rate. Thus “fresh” malware is often not
detected since the AV vendors do not have signatures for this new threats.
Table 3 gives an overview of the top ten malware types we collected. We
obtained this results by scanning the malware samples with the free AV engine

ClamAV. In total, we could identify 642 diﬀerent types of malware. The table
shows that bots clearly dominate the samples we collect. This is mainly caused
by the large number of botnets in the wild and the aggressive spreading of the
individual bots. Interestingly is also the number of captured samples compared
