so as to ensure all attributes are treated equally in the clas-
siﬁcation process. The scaling factor, SFAi, is computed
as:
SFAi = U BAi − LBAi
Ai,max − Ai,min
with Ai,min and Ai,max being the minimum and maximum
values of the attribute Ai, respectively. Also, LBAi and
U BAi are the deﬁned lower and upper bounds of the scaled
attribute, respectively (we have used LBAi = 0.0 and
U BAi = 1.0).
5.3. Performance Evaluation Methodology
The SVMlight Support Vector Machine classiﬁer devel-
oped by T. Joachims from the University of Dortmund [19]
was used in the experiments. SVMlight is an implementa-
tion of Vapnik’s Support Vector Machine [14], as described
in Section 4 . It (SVMlight) scales well to a large number
of sparse instance vectors as well as efﬁciently handling a
large number of support vectors. In our experiments we ex-
plored a number of different kernel functions for the SVM
classiﬁer namely, the linear, polynomial, radial basis and
sigmoid tanh functions. We obtained maximal F1 classi-
ﬁcation results (see below for the deﬁnition of F1) on our
data set with a polynomial kernel of degree 3. The “LOQO”
optimiser was used for maximising the margin.
The Support Vector Machine computes two-way cate-
gorisation. Therefore, in our experiments on author gender
categorisation, only a single two-way classiﬁcation model
with a two-way confusion matrix needed to be generated.

The training-testing sampling methodology used was a 10-
fold cross-validation of the entire e-mail document set.
To evaluate the categorisation performance on the e-mail
document corpus, we calculate the accuracy, recall (R), pre-
cision (P) and combined F1 performance measures com-
monly employed in the information retrieval and text min-
ing literature (for a discussion of these measures see, for
example, [20]), where:
F1 =
2RP
(R + P )
6. Results and Discussion
We present our author gender-preferential language attri-
bution results and report the F1 statistic using the Support
Vector Machine (SVM) classiﬁer. The results are given for
different e-mail document sizes (measured as the minimum
word count) and for different e-mail author gender cohort
sizes (number of e-mail documents per female and male au-
thor cohort). These are displayed in Table 4.
As observed in Table 4, F1 categorisation performance
results indicate that, in general, the SVM classiﬁer com-
bined with the style markers, structural attributes, and
gender-preferential language attributes is able to satisfac-
torily discriminate between the author gender cohorts. As
expected, there is a general improvement, though not dra-
matic, in performance as the the number of e-mails in each
gender cohort class increases. However, the improvement
in performance as a function of the minimum word count
is not as consistent as the e-mail count performance results.
A noticeable improvement is only achieved when the num-
ber of e-mails in each gender cohort class is not too small

(> 300) and/or the number of authors in each author gender
class increases. These results indicate that a small num-
ber of e-mails per author cohort class is generally sufﬁcient
for satisfactory gender classiﬁcation. This result compares
favourably with similar observations made in authorship at-
tribution studies [10].
Some preliminary analysis of the impact of the different
types of attributes (stylistic, structural, gender-preferential)
on the author gender categorisation performance was also
undertaken. Each type of attribute set was removed from the
feature set and the performance results calculated. These
are shown in Table 5.
Though preliminary at this stage, the results in Table 5
show that the full combination of attributes gives the best
author gender categorisation. Removal of any of the at-
tributes gives rise to a reduced performance value, though
some more importantly than others. In particular, the set of
function words (attributes A31 to A152) are seen to be an
important gender discriminator. This is as expected since
function words has been shown to be a good author dis-
criminator [11] as well as containing words that could be-
long to gender-preferential language (such as “so”, “very”
etc.). However, we also note that the gender-preferential
attributes used in the experiment only give a marginal im-
provement in the categorisation performance. This indi-
cates that the current set of gender-based attributes are in-
sufﬁcient and a more selective and/or more extensive set of
gender-preferential attributes will need to be used to achieve
better categorisation performance.
7. Conclusions
In this paper, we have investigated the learning of the
author gender categories from e-mail documents. We used
an extended set of predominantly content-free e-mail docu-
ment features such as style markers, structural characteris-
tics and gender-preferential language features together with

a Support Vector Machine learning algorithm. Experiments
on a number of e-mail documents generated by over 800
authors of both genders gave promising results for author
gender categorisation. We observed an improvement in per-
formance with increasing number of e-mails in both gender
cohort classes.
The current approach has several limitations. Firstly, as
mentioned in Section 6, a larger set of gender-preferential
language attributes needs to be used to improve the perfor-
mance results further. Secondly, more studies on the use-
fulness of speciﬁc style markers, such as N -graphs, for au-
thor gender identiﬁcation should be investigated as it is con-
jectured that, for example, certain bi-graphs incorporating
punctuation could be effective discriminators [21]. Finally,
the diversity in author characteristics in the author cohort
e-mail database is currently quite small owing to the type of
organisation where the e-mails were sourced. Though it is
not easy to obtain a sufﬁciently large set of e-mails from au-
thors with varying cohort characteristics (educational level,
language background etc.), we hope to be able to build up a
suitable forensic database and further test our approach.
