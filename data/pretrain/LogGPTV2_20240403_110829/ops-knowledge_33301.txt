User: How do I reduce the connection timeout for python-memcache?
When a machine in my cluster goes down, the healthy machines hang for too long trying to connect to it. 
Is settimeout the only way?
Assistant: After adjusting time out, also adjust number of retries per server before purging it from the pool.
