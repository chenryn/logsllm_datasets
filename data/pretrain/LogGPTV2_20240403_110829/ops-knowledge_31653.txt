To determine the mode of the log entry, let's first clarify the provided information. The log entry you've shared is:

```
Follower sid: 3 : info : org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.QuorumPeer$QuorumServer@33557fe4
```

From this log, we can see that the server with `sid: 3` is operating in **Follower** mode. The `info` tag suggests that this is an informational message, and the `org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.QuorumPeer$QuorumServer@33557fe4` part is a reference to the specific QuorumServer object.

To generalize this log format, it would be:

```
Follower sid: <server_id> : info : org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.QuorumPeer$QuorumServer@<object_reference>
```

In this case, the mode of the log is **Follower**.
