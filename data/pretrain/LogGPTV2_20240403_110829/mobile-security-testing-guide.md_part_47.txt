### Setting Up a Testing Environment for iOS Apps

#### Can I Jailbreak?
Jailbreaking an iOS device can be a useful step in setting up a testing environment, but it comes with risks. While jailbreaking is generally safe, there is always the possibility of bricking your device. You assume full responsibility for any modifications made to your device.

#### Recommended Tools - iOS Device
Many tools for a jailbroken iOS device can be installed via Cydia, which acts as an unofficial App Store and repository manager. Below are some essential repositories and packages to add:

1. **Repositories:**
   - **BigBoss:** `http://apt.thebigboss.org/repofiles/cydia/` (Contains various packages, including the BigBoss Recommended Tools package)
   - **HackYouriPhone:** `http://repo.hackyouriphone.org` (For the AppSync package)
   - **Frida:** `https://build.frida.re` (Install Frida by adding this repository)
   - **Needle Agent:** `http://mobiletools.mwrinfosecurity.com/cydia/` (Add this repository for the Needle agent)
   - **Chariz:** `https://repo.chariz.io` (Useful for managing jailbreaks on iOS 11)
   - **Elucubratus:** `https://apt.bingner.com/` (Provides several good tools, especially for iOS 12 when using Unc0ver)
   - **Coolstar:** `https://coolstar.org/publicrepo/` (For Darwin CC Tools)

   **Note:** If you are using Sileo, keep in mind that the Sileo Compatibility Layer shares sources between Cydia and Sileo. However, Cydia cannot remove sources added in Sileo, and vice versa.

2. **Packages:**
   - **adv-cmds:** Advanced command-line tools.
   - **AppList:** Allows querying the list of installed apps.
   - **Apt:** Advanced Package Tool for managing installed packages.
   - **AppSync Unified:** Enables syncing and installing unsigned iOS applications.
   - **BigBoss Recommended Tools:** Includes useful command-line tools for security testing.
   - **Class-dump:** Examines Objective-C runtime information.
   - **Clutch:** Decrypts app executables.
   - **Cycript:** An inlining, optimizing compiler and console environment.
   - **Cydia Substrate:** Facilitates developing third-party iOS add-ons.
   - **cURL:** A well-known HTTP client for faster package downloads.
   - **Darwin CC Tools:** Dependency for Needle.
   - **IPA Installer Console:** Installs IPA application packages from the command line.
   - **Frida:** Dynamic instrumentation tool.
   - **Grep:** Filters lines.
   - **Gzip:** Zip utility.
   - **Needle-Agent:** Part of the Needle framework.
   - **Open for iOS 11:** Required for Needle Agent functionality.
   - **PreferenceLoader:** Adds entries to the Settings application.
   - **SOcket CAT:** Connects to sockets for reading and writing messages.

   **Note:** Some tools, like Class-dump-Z, need to be installed manually as they are not available via Cydia.

3. **SSH Access:**
   - Install the OpenSSH package to enable SSH access.
   - Connect both devices to the same Wi-Fi network.
   - Use `ssh root@<device_IP>` to log in as the root user.
   - Default users: `root` and `mobile`.
   - Default password: `alpine` (change this immediately for security reasons).

4. **USB Restricted Mode:**
   - On iOS devices, data connections are disabled after 1 hour in a locked state due to USB Restricted Mode (introduced in iOS 11.4.1). Unlock the device to re-enable data connections.

#### Recommended Tools - Host Computer
To analyze iOS apps, install the following tools on your host computer. Many of these tools require macOS.

1. **Burp Suite:**
   - An interception proxy for analyzing traffic between the app and its API. See "Setting up an Interception Proxy" for detailed instructions.

2. **Frida:**
   - A runtime instrumentation framework for injecting JavaScript or custom libraries into native Android and iOS apps. Installation instructions are available on the official website.

3. **Frida-ios-dump:**
   - Pulls a decrypted IPA from a jailbroken device. Refer to the "Using Frida-ios-dump" section for detailed instructions.

4. **IDB:**
   - Simplifies common tasks for iOS app security assessments. Installation instructions are in the documentation. After connecting to the device via SSH, use IDB to select and analyze the app.

5. **ios-deploy:**
   - Installs and debugs iOS apps from the command line without Xcode. Install via Homebrew:
     ```sh
     brew install ios-deploy
     ```

6. **iFunBox:**

8. **Mobile-Security-Framework (MobSF):**
   - An automated mobile application pentesting framework. Install via Docker or locally:
     ```sh
     docker pull opensecurity/mobile-security-framework-mobsf
     docker run -it -p 8000:8000 opensecurity/mobile-security-framework-mobsf:latest
     ```
     Or:
     ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF.git
     cd Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF
     ./setup.sh # For Linux and Mac
     setup.bat # For Windows
     ./run.sh # For Linux and Mac
     run.bat # For Windows

13. **TablePlus:**
    - A tool for inspecting database files like SQLite. Useful for analyzing dumped database files from iOS devices.

#### Basic Testing Operations
1. **Accessing the Device Shell:**
   - **Remote Shell:**
     - Install the OpenSSH package.
     - Connect both devices to the same Wi-Fi network.
     - Use `ssh root@<device_IP>` to log in as the root user.
     - Change the default password (`alpine`) for both `root` and `mobile` users.
   - **Connect via SSH over USB:**
     - Use `usbmuxd` to connect to the device's SSH server via USB if a reliable Wi-Fi connection is not available.

By following these steps, you can set up a robust testing environment for iOS apps, ensuring you have the necessary tools and configurations for thorough security assessments.
