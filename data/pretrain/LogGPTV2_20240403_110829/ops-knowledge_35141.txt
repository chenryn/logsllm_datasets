User: How do I call an external command within Python as if I'd typed it in a shell or command prompt?
Assistant: There is another difference here which is not mentioned previously.
subprocess.Popen executes the <command> as a subprocess. In my case, I need to execute file <a> which needs to communicate with another program, <b>. 
I tried subprocess, and execution was successful. However <b> could not communicate with <a>.
Everything is normal when I run both from the terminal.
One more: 
(NOTE: kwrite behaves different from other applications. If you try the below with Firefox, the results will not be the same.)
If you try os.system("kwrite"), program flow freezes until the user closes kwrite. To overcome that I tried instead os.system(konsole -e kwrite). This time program continued to flow, but kwrite became the subprocess of the console.
Anyone runs the kwrite not being a subprocess (i.e. in the system monitor it must appear at the leftmost edge of the tree).
