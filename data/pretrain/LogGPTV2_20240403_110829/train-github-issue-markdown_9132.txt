I am experiencing an issue with `overlay.js` on line 64 when using version 0.13.1. The error message I receive is:

```
DATA FETCHING ERROR: ReferenceError: document is not defined
- overlay.js:64 [object Object].componentWillMount
```

However, the problem does not occur in version 0.13.0. The only difference I noticed is that in `overlay.js`, the lifecycle method `componentDidMount` was changed to `componentWillMount` on line 64. 

I am unsure if this issue is related to my server setup or something else. Could you please provide some guidance on how to resolve this?
