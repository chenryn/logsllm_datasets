I've an issue with overlay.js on line 64 when I am using 0.13.1 version
    DATA FETCHING ERROR:   ReferenceError: document is not defined
    [0]   
    [0]   - overlay.js:64 [object Object].componentWillMount
But it's okay on version 0.13.0. The only difference is that on line 64 in
overlay.js componentDidMount changed to componentWillMount. So i don't know if
thats problem on my server setup or else.
