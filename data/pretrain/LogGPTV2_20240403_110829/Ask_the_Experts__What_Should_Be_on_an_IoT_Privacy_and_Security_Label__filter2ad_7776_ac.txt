### Methodology and Study Design
In the follow-up surveys with experts, we presented each participant with only one-third of the factors randomly sampled from the list of all privacy and security factors. This approach reduced respondent fatigue [7] and enhanced the quality of responses, though it prevented achieving a true consensus across all experts. Our primary objective was to gather diverse expert opinions rather than reach perfect consensus. Therefore, we report themes that were mentioned by a few experts.

We designed a label prototype based on findings from our three-round Delphi process. However, we did not conduct a fourth round to show experts the label and solicit feedback. While this would have helped confirm experts’ opinions in the context of a complete label design, it would have introduced confounding factors related to the label's design, such as the order of sections and specific language used. Since the participants' expertise was in IoT security and privacy, not communications design, we focused the expert elicitation study on individual factors.

Our consumer study was a small-scale qualitative study designed to gain initial consumer feedback and assess the overall usefulness of the layered label approach. Additional large-scale iterative design and testing are needed to refine and validate the label design.

### Results
We conducted 22 one-hour, semi-structured interviews with IoT privacy and security experts from diverse backgrounds (see Table I). We compiled a list of 47 privacy, security, and general factors that experts said they would like to see on the IoT label.

Following the expert interviews, we conducted a qualitative survey to understand the reasons for including or excluding each factor. Out of 22 invited experts, 17 responded, each commenting on one-third of the 47 factors. The survey took an average of 16 minutes to complete, and we collected an average of seven reasons for or against each factor. We then conducted thematic analysis to identify two or three primary reasons for and against each factor.

In the second survey, we presented experts with the reasons for and against each factor from the previous phases and asked them to rate their enthusiasm for including the factor on either the primary or secondary layer of the label. 21 experts participated, spending an average of 15 minutes. We identified 12 factors recommended for the primary layer and 13 factors for the secondary layer.

Based on the expert study and authors’ discussions, we designed prototype privacy and security labels for hypothetical smart security cameras and presented them to a diverse sample of 15 non-expert consumers (see Table II). We asked them questions about their understanding of the factors on the label and whether they conveyed risk. We iteratively improved the content of the label to make it more understandable, resulting in a final prototype label.

### Discussion
#### Definition, Assessment, and Accountability
We started the interviews by asking experts to define privacy and security related to IoT devices. When defining security, almost all experts (21/22) mentioned the CIA triad of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. However, definitions of privacy varied. Some experts (9/22) defined privacy as having transparency and control over data practices, while others (8/22) defined it as the confidentiality aspect of security. Overall, experts' definitions for security were mostly passive and focused on hardware and software enforcement mechanisms. In contrast, their definitions for privacy were active and centered around policy, control, and individuals' preferences and comfort. For instance, P7 compared privacy and security practices: "If privacy is done right, it would be more active than security because the consumer would be able to be in control." B3 explained: "Security mechanisms are the things that enforce the technical controls that allow us the privacy we have."

Most experts (15/22) believed that security information is less tangible and understandable for consumers compared to privacy information, partly because it relies on technical mechanisms. S5 explained: "Consumers don’t necessarily understand some of the abstract stuff about security that they don’t see. Whereas when their privacy is breached, they are more aware of that."

Additionally, almost all experts (19/22) reported that security practices are easier to measure and assess than privacy practices, as security is more objective and less controversial, while privacy is more subjective and context-dependent. P5 explained: "Security strikes me as less subjective, and, therefore, easier to measure. Which is to say that there could be certain standards. What sort of encryption exists on the device? What encryption is in the cloud? These are all fairly quantifiable. Whereas privacy is trickier, I think. And almost ethically and morally from my point of view, there’s a lot more gray area in this." This finding aligns with current efforts in IoT assessments and scoring, which are more focused on security mechanisms than privacy practices [22], [39], [44], [51], [107].

Experts reported that IoT privacy and security labels could increase accountability (most frequently mentioned for factors on the secondary layer) and transparency. Seven experts suggested that increased transparency could incentivize companies to compete on privacy and security, leading to safer products. S4 explained: "There is value in forcing the company to write a list down even if the consumer doesn’t understand it. If you said, ‘list your open ports,’ there would be an incentive to make them few."

Some experts (8/22) mentioned that IoT companies' accountability should differ for privacy and security breaches. They noted that security breaches can happen accidentally, even if companies follow best practices. However, privacy violations could be intentional, and IoT companies could profit from them. P4 explained: "You can have the best intentions in the world, but if somebody comes up with some crazy hack overnight, you shouldn’t be held responsible for it. You should be held responsible for fixing it. As opposed to if you intentionally share someone’s data with a third party, it’s not like, oh you could have prevented it but you chose to do it."

In the second survey, we asked experts to specify whether they prefer to see privacy and security factors in two separate sections or combined into one section. About half of the experts (10/21) believed privacy and security should be presented in separate sections. Most of these (9/10) said that separating the factors would help consumers better understand and differentiate between privacy and security concerns.
