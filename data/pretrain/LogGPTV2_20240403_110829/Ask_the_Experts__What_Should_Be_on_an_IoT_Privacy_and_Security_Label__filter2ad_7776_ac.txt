In the follow-up surveys with experts, we presented each
participant with only one-third of factors randomly sampled
from the list of all privacy and security factors. This reduced
respondent fatigue [7] and increased the quality of responses,
at the cost of not being able to achieve a true consensus
across all experts. In the expert study, our main objective was
to collect the opinions of diverse experts, and not to reach
perfect consensus. Therefore, we report themes that were only
mentioned by a few experts.
We designed a label prototype based on ﬁndings from our
three-round Delphi process. However, we did not conduct a
fourth round of study to show experts the label and ask them
for feedback. Although this would have helped us conﬁrm
experts’ opinions about the factors in the context of a complete
label design, it would have introduced confounding factors
related to the design of the label, including, but not limited
to, the order of sections on the label and the speciﬁc language
used to convey the information. Since the expertise of the
participants in our study was in the area of IoT security and
privacy, and not in communications design, we limited the
expert elicitation study to focus on the individual factors.
Our consumer study was a small-scale qualitative study
designed to gain initial consumer feedback and assess the
overall usefulness of the layered label approach in this context.
Additional large-scale iterative design and testing is needed to
reﬁne and validate the label design.
IV. RESULTS
We conducted 22 one-hour, semi-structured interviews with
IoT privacy and security experts with diverse backgrounds as
described in Table I. We compiled a list of 47 privacy, security,
and general factors that experts said they would like to see on
the IoT label.

We followed the expert interviews with a qualitative survey
to understand the reasons experts wanted to include or exclude
each factor. Out of 22 invited experts, 17 answered the ﬁrst
survey, with each of them being asked to comment on one-third
of the 47 factors. This survey took an average of 16 minutes to
complete. We collected on average seven reasons for or against
including each factor on the label. We then conducted thematic
analysis on the arguments provided to arrive at two or three
primary reasons for and against each factor.
In the second survey, we presented experts with the reasons
for and against each factor from the previous two phases and
asked them to rate their enthusiasm for including the factor
on either the primary or the secondary layer of the label. 21
experts participated in the second survey, spending an average
of 15 minutes. We identiﬁed 12 factors that most experts
recommended including on the primary layer and 13 factors
most experts recommended including on the secondary layer.
Based on the expert study and authors’ discussions, we
designed prototype privacy and security labels for hypothetical
smart security cameras and presented them to a diverse sample
of 15 non-expert consumers (see Table II). We asked them
questions related to their understanding of the factors on the
label and whether they conveyed risk. We iteratively improved
the content of the label to make it more understandable,
resulting in a ﬁnal prototype label.
In this section, we ﬁrst discuss experts’ attitudes toward
privacy and security. Next we present the factors experts wanted
to include on the primary and secondary layers of the label
or exclude from the label, followed by a discussion of how
consumers perceived those factors. We continue by discussing
consumers’ attitudes toward the labels and their layered design.
Finally, we present our prototype label design that we designed
based on experts’ and consumers’ input.
A. Deﬁnition, Assessment, and Accountability
We started the interviews by asking experts to deﬁne
privacy and security related to IoT devices. When deﬁning
security, almost all experts (21/22) mentioned the CIA triad of
conﬁdentiality, integrity, and availability. However, experts had
different deﬁnitions for privacy. Some experts (9/22) deﬁned
privacy as having transparency and control over data practices
and some experts deﬁned privacy as the conﬁdentiality aspect
of security (8/22). Overall, experts’ deﬁnitions for security
were mostly passive and focused on hardware and software
enforcement mechanisms. On the other hand, their deﬁnitions
for privacy were active and centered around policy, control,
and individuals’ preferences and comfort. For instance, P7
compared privacy and security practices by saying: “If the
privacy is done right, it would be more active than security
because the consumer would be able to be in control.” B3
explained how privacy and security are related by saying:
“Security mechanisms are the things that enforce the technical
controls that allow us the privacy we have.”
Most experts (15/22) believed that security information is less
tangible and understandable for consumers compared to privacy
information, in part because it relies on technical mechanisms.
S5 explained: “Consumers don’t necessarily understand some
of the abstract stuff about security that they don’t see. Whereas
when their privacy is breached, they are more aware of that.”
In addition, almost all experts (19/22) reported that security
practices are easier to measure and assess than privacy practices,
as security is more objective and less controversial, while
privacy is more subjective and context dependent. P5 explained
that security is easier to quantify: “Security strikes me as less
subjective, and, therefore, easier to measure. Which is to say
that there could be certain standards. What sort of encryption
exists on the device? What encryption is in the cloud? These
are all fairly quantiﬁable. Whereas privacy is trickier, I think.
And almost ethically and morally from my point of view,
there’s a lot more gray area in this.” This ﬁnding is aligned
with the current efforts in IoT assessments and scoring, which
are more focused toward security mechanisms than privacy
practices [22], [39], [44], [51], [107].
Experts reported that IoT privacy and security labels could
increase accountability (most frequently mentioned for factors
on the secondary layer) and transparency. Seven experts
suggested that increased transparency could be an incentive
for companies to compete on privacy and security, leading to
safer products. S4 explained: “There is value in forcing the
company to write a list down even if the consumer doesn’t
understand it. If you said, ‘list your open ports,’ there would
be an incentive to make them few.”
Some experts (8/22) mentioned that IoT companies’ account-
ability should be different for privacy and security breaches.
They said that security breaches can happen accidentally, even
if companies follow best practices. However, privacy violations
could be intentional and IoT companies could even proﬁt
from them. P4 explained: “You can have the best intentions
in the world, but if somebody comes up with some crazy
hack overnight, you shouldn’t be held responsible for it. You
should be held responsible for ﬁxing it. As opposed to if you
intentionally share someone’s data with a third party, it’s not
like, oh you could have prevented it but you chose to do it.”
In the second survey, we asked experts to specify whether
they prefer to see privacy and security factors in two separate
sections or if we should combine them into one section. About
half of the experts (10/21) believed privacy and security should
be presented in separate sections. Most of these (9/10) said
