User: I seem to remember reading somewhere that google app engine automatically caches the results of very frequent queries into memory so that they are retrieved faster.  
Is this correct?
If so, is there still a charge for datastore reads on these queries?
Assistant: No, it doesn't. However depending on what framework you use for access to the datastore, memcache will be used. Are you developing in java or python? On the java side, Objectify will cache GETs automatically but not Queries. Keep in mind that there is a big difference in terms of performance and cachability between gets and queries in both python and java.
You are not charged for datastore reads for memcache hits.
