##### Issue Type:
Bug Report
##### Ansible Version:
ansible 1.7 (devel `6bc056e`) last updated 2014/06/02 19:46:03 (GMT -700)
##### Environment:
Mac OS X 10.9.3
##### Summary:
Subsequent dependent roles are ignored when a role containing the dependency
is conditionally skipped and the dependency is marked `allow_duplicates: no`.
##### Steps To Reproduce:
Playbook contains:
    roles:
        - { role: role_a, when: false }
        - role_b
`role_a` and `role_b` have dependencies in `meta/main.yml`:
    dependencies:
      - role_c
`role_c` disables duplicates in `meta/main.yml`:
    allow_duplicates: no
##### Expected Results:
  1. `role_c` is skipped, `role_a` is skipped.
  2. `role_c` executes as a dependency of `role_b`
  3. `role_b` executes.
##### Actual Results:
  1. `role_c` is skipped, `role_a` is skipped.
  2. `role_b` executes, but `role_c` dependency is never satisfied.
