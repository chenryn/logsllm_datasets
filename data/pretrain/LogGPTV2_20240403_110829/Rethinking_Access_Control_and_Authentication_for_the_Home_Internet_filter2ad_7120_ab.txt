ﬁnding such affordances highly ineffective. Recent stud-
ies [31, 50] have sought to elicit users’ broad security
and privacy concerns with IoT environments, particu-
larly noting multi-user complexity as a key security chal-
lenge. This complexity stems from the social ties in a
home IoT setting. For instance, researchers have noted
that roommates [26], guests [23], neighbors [7], and chil-
dren [8,38] are all important considerations in multi-user
environments. We build on this work, identifying desired
access-control rules for home IoT devices and bringing
both relationships between home occupants and devices’
individual capabilities to the forefront.
Prior research on IoT authentication has focused on
protocols (e.g., Kerberos-like frameworks [1, 27]) with-
out considering the constraints of users. Feng et al. intro-
duced VAuth, voice-based authentication for voice assis-
tants [12]. VAuth requires the use of wearable hardware
to establish an authentication channel, however. One of
our goals (RQ4) is to identify the authentication mecha-
nisms that might be suitable for multi-user devices.
Smartphones can be considered a predecessor to the
IoT, yet the large literature [9, 10, 11, 46] on specifying
which apps can access which resources translates only
partially to home IoT devices. Enck et al. discuss how

apps could gain access to resources by requesting per-
mission from the user [9], while Felt et al. discuss how
users may not always pay attention to such prompts [11].
A common theme is that apps access phone resources,
and a phone is a single-user device not typically shared
with others. On current versions of Android, one can
conﬁgure secondary accounts with restrictions on what
apps may be used [17], yet having separate accounts does
not solve the multi-user challenges of home IoT devices.
4 Pre-Study
As a ﬁrst step in exploring access control based on ca-
pabilities and relationships in the home IoT, we con-
ducted a pre-study to identify capabilities and relation-
ships that elicit representative or important user con-
cerns. To ground our investigation of capabilities of the
home IoT in devices consumers would likely encounter,
we created a list of home IoT devices (Appendix A)
from consumer recommendations in CNET, PCMag, and
Tom’s Guide [33]. We grouped devices by their core
functionality into categories including smart-home hubs,
door locks, and voice assistants.
For each category of device, we collected the capabil-
ities offered by currently marketed devices in that cate-
gory. We added likely future capabilities, as well as the
ability to write end-user programs [40, 45]. We showed
each pre-study participant all capabilities identiﬁed for a
single given class of device. The participant answered
questions about the positive and negative consequences
of using that capability, and they also identiﬁed addi-
tional capabilities they expected the device to have. We
used this process to identify a comprehensive, yet di-
verse, set of capabilities that range from those that elicit
substantial concerns to those that elicit none.
To identify a small set of relationships to investigate
in the main study, we also showed participants a table of
24 relationships (e. g., teenage child, home health aide)
and asked them to group these relationships into ﬁve or-
dered levels of desired access to smart-home devices. We
chose this list of 24 relationships based on existing users
and groups in discretionary access control (DAC) sys-
tems and common social relationships in households.
We conducted the pre-study with 31 participants on
Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. Participants identiﬁed po-
tential concerns for a number of capabilities, in addition
to identifying capabilities (e. g., turning on lights) that
aroused few concerns. We used these results to gener-
ate a list of capabilities, grouping similar functionalities
across devices into categories like viewing the current
state of a device. We selected the 22 capabilities whose
pre-study results showed a spectrum of opinions and con-
cerns while maintaining a feature-set representative of
smart homes.
To narrow our initial list of 24 relationships to a
tractable number, we examined how pre-study partici-
pants assigned each relationship to one of the ﬁve or-
dered categories of desired access to household devices.
We chose the six relationships that span the full range
of desired access and for which participants were most
consistent in their assignments to a category.

5 Methodology
To elicit desired access-control policies for the home IoT,
our main study was an online survey-based user study.
We recruited participants on Mechanical Turk, limiting
the study to workers age 18+ who live in the United
States and have an approval rating of at least 95 %.
5.1 Protocol
Each participant was presented with a single capability
(e.g., “see which lights in the home are on or off”) ran-
domly chosen from among the 22 identiﬁed in the pre-
study. Appendix B gives the full list of capabilities and
the descriptions participants saw.
We then presented the participant with one of six re-
lationships: spouse; teenage child; child in elementary
school; visiting family member; babysitter; neighbor.
The text used to describe each relationship is in Ap-
pendix C. We ﬁrst asked whether such a person should
be permitted to control that capability “always,” “never,”
or “sometimes, depending on speciﬁc factors.” These an-
swers were the ﬁrst step in identifying participants’ de-
sired access-control policies. For the ﬁrst two options,
we required a short free-text justiﬁcation. To better un-
derstand the importance of an authentication method cor-
rectly identifying the person in question and the system
correctly enforcing the access-control policy, we asked
participants who answered “always” or “never” to state
how much of an inconvenience it would be if the system
incorrectly denied or allowed (respectively) that particu-
lar user access to that capability. Participants chose from
“not an inconvenience,” “minor inconvenience,” or “ma-
jor inconvenience,” with a brief free-text justiﬁcation.
If the participant chose “sometimes,” we required ad-
ditional explanations to further delineate their desired
access-control policy. They ﬁrst explained in free-text
when that person should be allowed to use that capabil-
ity, followed by when they should not be allowed to do
so. On a ﬁve-point scale from “not important” to “ex-
tremely important,” we asked how important it was for
them to have (or not have) access to that capability.
We repeated these questions for the other ﬁve relation-
ships in random order. Thus, each participant responded
for all six relationships about a single capability.
Afterwards, we asked more general questions about
specifying access-control policies for that capability. In
particular, we presented eight contextual factors in ran-
domized order, asking whether that factor should inﬂu-
ence whether or not anyone should be permitted to use
that capability. The possible responses were “yes,” “no,”
and “not applicable,” followed by a free-response justi-
ﬁcation. We asked about the following factors: the time
of day; the location of the person relative to the device
(e.g., in the same room); the age of the person; who else
is currently at home; the cost of performing that action
(e.g., cost of electricity or other monetary costs); the cur-
rent state of the device; the location of the device in the
home; the person’s recent usage of the device. Further,
we asked participants to list any additional factors that
might affect their decision for that capability.
We concluded with questions about demographics, as
well as the characteristics of the participant’s physical
house and members of their household. We also asked
about their ownership and prior use of Internet-connected
devices. Appendix D gives the survey instrument. We
compensated participants $ 3.50 for the study, which
took approximately 20 minutes and was IRB-approved.
5.2 Analysis
Participants’ responses about their access-control prefer-
ences included both qualitative free-text responses and
multiple-choice responses. Two independent researchers
coded the qualitative data. The ﬁrst researcher performed
open coding to develop a code book capturing the main
themes, while the second coder independently used that
same code book. To quantitatively compare multiple-
choice responses across groups, we used the chi-squared
test when all cell values were at least 5, and Fisher’s Ex-
act Test (FET) otherwise. For all tests, α = .05, and we
adjusted for multiple testing within each family of tests
using Holm correction.
5.3 Limitations
The ecological validity and generalizability of our study
are limited due to our convenience sample on Mechani-
cal Turk. Most of our questions are based on hypothetical
situations in which participants imagine the relationships
and capabilities we proposed to them and self-report how
they expect to react. Furthermore, while some partici-
pants were active users of home IoT devices, others were
not, making the scenarios fully hypothetical for some
participants. We chose to accept this limitation and in-
clude recruits regardless of prior experience with home
IoT devices to avoid biasing the sample toward early
adopters, who tend to be more afﬂuent and tech-savvy.
6 Results
In the following sections we present our ﬁndings. We
begin by providing an overview of our participants (Sec-
tion 6.1). Next, we present how desired access-control
policies differ across capabilities (RQ1, Section 6.2) and
the degree to which desired policies differ across re-
lationships (RQ1, Section 6.3). After that, we show

for which pairs of relationships and capabilities the de-
sired access-control policies are consistent across par-
ticipants. We use these pairs to derive default policies
(RQ2, Section 6.4). Next, we evaluate which contextual
factors (e. g., age, location, usage) inﬂuence the “some-
times” cases the most, thus explaining users’ reasoning
for not always allowing access to a capability (RQ3,
Section 6.5). Finally, we analyze the consequences of
false authorization and show the impact of falsely al-
lowing / denying access to a certain capability on a per-
relationship level (RQ4, Section 6.6).
6.1 Participants
A total of 426 individuals participated in the study, and
425 of them were qualiﬁed as effective responses. One
response was excluded from our data because their free-
text responses were unrelated to our questions. Our
sample was nearly gender-balanced; 46 % of participants
identiﬁed as female, and 54 % as male. The median age
range was 25-34 years old (47 %). Most participants
(85 %) were between 25 and 54 years old. Some par-
ticipants (19 %) reported majoring, earning a degree, or
holding a job in computer science or a related ﬁeld.
The majority of our participants (67 %) live in a single-
family home, while 25 % live in an apartment. Nearly
half of the participants own (49 %) the place where they
live, while 47 % rent. Furthermore, we asked how many
people (including the participant) live in the same house-
hold. Around 20 % of participants reported living in a
single-person household, 27 % in a two-person, 23 % in
a three-person, and 17 % in a four-person household.
6.2 Capabilities (RQ1)
Current access-control implementation in a smart home
system is largely device-based. However, our data moti-
vates a more ﬁne-grained, ﬂexible access-control mech-
anism. In the following parts, we discuss our main ﬁnd-
ings, which are visualized in Figure 2.
A) Capability Differences Within a Single Device
We observed that participants’ attitudes toward various
capabilities differ within a single device. For example,
voice assistants can be used to play music and order
things online. However, participants were much more
willing to let others play music (32.5 % of participants
choose never averaged across the six relationships, σ =
0.33, median = 23.7%) than order things online (59.7 %
choose never on average, σ = 0.40, median = 71.1%)
(FET, p < .05 for the teenager, child, and visiting family
member relationships).
Another example of differing opinions across capabili-
ties within a single device include deleting an IoT lock’s
activity logs and answering the door, viewing the current
state of the lock, and setting rules for the lock. Across
relationships, participants were permissive about capa-
bilities like answering the door (25.6 % chose “never”
averaged across all relationships other than children,
σ = 0.33, median = 16,7%). Because children would
likely not have a smartphone, we did not ask about them
performing this action and we exclude them from this
analysis.
In contrast, 76.8 % of participants said they
would never allow others to delete activity logs (σ =
0.28, median = 92.1%). These differences are signiﬁ-
cant (FET, all p < 0.05 comparing within teenagers, vis-
iting family, and babysitters). Even for a very trust-based
relationship like a spouse, some participants still chose
never. When asked why, one participant wrote: “No one
should be able to delete the security logs.”
Even if individuals with relationships like neighbor or
babysitter do not live in the same house, permissions
are sometimes given when the owner of the house is
not around. One typical response for when a capabil-
ity should be accessible to neighbors is “Perhaps when
I’m on vacation and I ask them to watch my home.”
B) Context-Dependent Capabilities
We identiﬁed “Answering the Doorbell” to be a highly
context-dependent capability. 40 % of participants across
relationships (σ = 0.33, median = 38.9%) selected
sometimes for this capability. At the same time, an aver-
age of 25.6 % of participants across relationships chose
never (σ = 0.33, median = 16.7%).
Whether the homeowner is present is a key factor impact-
ing responses. Many participants (66.7 %) chose some-
times when it came to the babysitter, because the job it-
self indicates the parents are not around. If a delivery
person rings the doorbell while the babysitter is home,
the babysitter should be allowed to handle the event. The
majority of participants (77.8 %) also sometimes trust a
visiting family member with the same level of access.
Some participants (16.7 %) will even consider giving this
access to their neighbors, so that if there is an emergency
when the family is on vacation, their neighbor can see
who is at the door from their smartphone.
6.3 Relationships (RQ1)
Relationships play an important role in participants’ pre-
ferred access-control policies.
