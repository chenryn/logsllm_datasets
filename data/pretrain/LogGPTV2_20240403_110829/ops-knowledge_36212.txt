User: I have no idea why python run every script in a new command window. 
For example I run: python testfile.py, it is show new window and close immediately, so I can't look the traceback. 
Python 2.7 32-bit at the same machine works normally
Assistant: Did you try adding raw_input() at the end of testfile.py ?
