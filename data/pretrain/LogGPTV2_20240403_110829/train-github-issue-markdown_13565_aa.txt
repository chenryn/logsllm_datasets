##### CONFIGURATION
##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
N/A
##### SUMMARY
Tasks from the last include_tasks-call are not executed when using the free
strategy and with_nested.  
This seems to only affect roles, I could not reproduce it using only tasks.
##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
Run the playbook.  
$ ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yml  
Change include_tasks to include when using ansible 2.3
    .
