**Figure 10. The nonce exchange proposal.**

Our protocol provides the necessary distance bounding protection. The full annotated model can be found in L1RP.spthy in [9].

## C. Practical Experiments

The proposed extension to the current Level 1 protocol was tested using two Proxmarks. One Proxmark implemented the reader protocol, including the nonce-exchange if required, and the other simulated a card, also incorporating the proposed nonce-exchange. Our Proxmark-based programs included code to measure message times for assessing the implementation. The timings and other tests were limited to Level 1 commands up to and including the RATS command, as these are the ones used in L1RP.

### Results
One of our timing tests is shown in Figure 10, which highlights the proposed changes to the protocol (in this case, for a 4-byte UID).

### Proxmark Implementation of L1RP
We modified the Proxmark code to add two Level 1 functions, one for the reader side and one for the card side:
- **noncerdr**: Implements the reader side and executes the protocol up to the RATS message. If bit 9 of the ATQA message is set, it performs the nonce exchange. The nonce is obtained using the Linux `getrandom` function, which retrieves random bytes from `/dev/random`.
- **noncesim**: Simulates a card that expects to perform a nonce exchange and sets bit 9 in ATQA. The card is given a random UID and nonce, both obtained using the Linux `getrandom` function.

### Notes on the Implementation
- We used ATQA bit 9 to flag that the card can perform the nonce exchange.
- To identify the reader’s nonce exchange message, we chose an unused message code, `0x99`. On the card side, we send the nonce and a Block Check Character (BCC), similar to when a card sends its UID.
- We verified the backward compatibility of our new card and reader implementations by ensuring they work with existing EMV readers and cards.

### Time Measurements for L1RP
The round-trip time (RTT) using the Proxmarks was measured in 30 tests, with a mean of 1,116 µs and a standard deviation of 2.3 µs. This time is very similar to the time measured for the SELECT UID command for the Proxmarks and for actual payment cards, suggesting that time-bounding this exchange may work well. These Proxmark results are encouraging, and we will implement L1RP and obtain more measurements.

### Challenges When Relaying over L1RP
Analyzing our Proxmark-issued timing data, we observed that most of the time for the nonce-exchange is spent sending and receiving the data (≈1037 µs), not preparing the data. This makes a relay with unmodified commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware difficult.

Reading the data directly and using it to modulate a carrier signal, then transmitting the data to a receiver where it is demodulated and used to drive a loop antenna, could provide a low-level relay. However, this is a much more challenging undertaking than the threat model we envisage (see Section III). This type of low-level relay has been demonstrated for an LF RFID system by Francillon et al. [19], who used it to attack a car’s RFID key-entry system. However, this was for an LF RFID system, not the HF RFID system used for EMV payment cards. While implementing such a low-level (Level 1) attack on HF RFID systems is theoretically feasible, it has yet to be demonstrated.

## VIII. Related Work

Practical (relay) attacks against EMV have been demonstrated in various works, such as [39] and [26]. Other attacks have been reported against EMV, including two over-the-limit attacks for Visa [2, 7] discussed in sub-section II-B. In [8], a Mastercard was made to look like a Visa card to perform an over-the-limit attack on Mastercard, which is now patched. [2] describes an attack that makes an offline reader accept an invalid AC for Visa cards, an attack also described in [26, p.5]. Murdoch et al. [40] presented a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack against contact-based EMV, and evidence in practice is presented in [11]. Emms et al. [41] show how the non-TAP & PIN card limit can be bypassed by switching currencies.

None of these attacks would work against EMV on mobile devices if Consumer Device Cardholder Verification Method (CDCVM) authentication was always required, and these attacks require a relay, which would be prevented by a protocol that stops relaying (the main focus of our work). We are the first to mount attacks bypassing authentication to make illicit payments in mobile payment apps and the first to explore and exploit their different operating modes.

### Distance Bounding
Distance Bounding (DB) protocols were introduced by Brands and Chaum [42] to combat relay-based MitM attacks. In DB protocols, a reader and a tag (RFID card, smart card, etc.) run a challenge-response protocol where the reader measures the Round-Trip Time (RTT) and assumes physical proximity if the RTT is below a given bound. The survey in [43] provides numerous distance-bounding protocols, security concepts, and attacks.

RRP closely follows the previously proposed PaySafe protocol [26]. RRP was first formally verified in [5]. [44] performs a timing analysis of RRP and finds it secure, but without varying the positions of the card in the field, as we do.

NXP provides a distance-bounding protocol on their DESFire cards. Patents [45] and [46] are the only public sources of information, first recounted in [47]. These show that NXP's distance bounding uses a Level 1 nonce exchange, but provide no details on how or whether this distance bounding is tied to upper-level protocols or applications.

### Symbolic Verification of EMV
Past symbolic-verification models of EMV include [48], [2], [8], and of EMV with distance bounding [47], [26], [5], [49], [44]. The most up-to-date and complete formal model for EMV is in [2]. We follow this model (for contactless Visa, Mastercard) and extend it to encode mobile apps in transport and non-transport models, in a unified manner (CDA, DDA, high/low in one model). We add a full model of the Issuer Authentication Data (IAD) to their models and show that Visa/bank checking the IAD stops their attack.

### Symbolic Verification of Distance Bounding
Automatable symbolic verification of distance-bounding protocols was first proposed by Basin et al. [50]. Many recent developments exist. Nigam et al. [51] develop a distance bounding checking tool based on Maude. Rowe et al. [52] present a framework based on strand spaces. Debant et al. [49, 53] are the only symbolic models to explicitly encode time and location. Symbolic models tend to eliminate timing, even if it is considered in some theoretical models. Chothia et al. [26, 47] suggest a framework without an explicit model of time. Mauw et al. [5, 54] have a proof that, under certain conditions and for certain protocols (e.g., with one DB exchange, with no other timing notions, without certain message inter-dependencies), timed DB-security can be reduced to checking an order of events on traces; this elegant definition can be easily checked in the Tamarin prover and is the method we use. Boureanu et al. [44] extend this to support mobility.

## IX. Conclusions

We investigated mobile payment apps in different operation modes, showing their different defenses against bypassing authentication in transport mode. This allows us to make fraudulent Visa payments with locked iPhones of any value we wish. This vulnerability is due to the lack of checks performed on the iPhone combined with the lack of checks at the Visa back end. Apple Pay with Mastercard is not vulnerable, nor are Mastercard and Visa with Samsung Pay.

We have examined the practical security of Mastercard and Visa's relay-counteraction solutions for EMV and found that the former could potentially be functionally improved, whereas the latter lacks security. To address these issues, we proposed an EMV relay-resistant protocol that combines ideas from both the Mastercard and Visa relay-countermeasures proposals. We have formally proved our protocol correct and described a trial implementation of its distance-bounding part on Proxmarks, showing that our protocol is practical for EMV cards and for use with Apple Pay and Samsung Pay to stop relaying to the so-called express transit systems.
