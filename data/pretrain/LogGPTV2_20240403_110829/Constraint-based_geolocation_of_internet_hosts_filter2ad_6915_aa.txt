ABSTRACT
Geolocation of Internet hosts enables a diverse and inter-
esting new class of location-aware applications. Previous
measurement-based approaches use reference hosts, called
landmarks, with a well-known geographic location to pro-
vide the location estimation of a target host. This leads to
a discrete space of answers, limiting the number of possible
location estimates to the number of adopted landmarks. In
contrast, we propose Constraint-Based Geolocation (CBG),
which infers the geographic location of Internet hosts us-
ing multilateration with distance constraints, thus estab-
lishing a continuous space of answers instead of a discrete
one. CBG accurately transforms delay measurements to
geographic distance constraints, and then uses multilater-
ation to infer the geolocation of the target host. Our ex-
perimental results show that CBG outperforms the previ-
ous measurement-based geolocation techniques. Moreover,
in contrast to previous approaches, our method is able to
assign a con(cid:12)dence region to each given location estimate.
This allows a location-aware application to assess whether
the location estimate is su(cid:14)ciently accurate for its needs.

e(cid:14)cient means of inferring the geographic location of Inter-
net hosts. Examples of such location-aware applications in-
clude targeted advertising on web pages, automatic selection
of a language to display content, restricted content delivery
following regional policies, and authorization of transactions
only when performed from pre-established locations. Never-
theless, inferring the location of Internet hosts from their IP
addresses is a challenging problem because there is no direct
relationship between the IP address of a host and its geo-
graphic location. Previous work on the measurement-based
geolocation of Internet hosts [7, 14] uses the positions of
landmarks, reference hosts with well-known geographic lo-
cation, as the possible location estimates for the target host.
This leads to a discrete space of answers, i.e. the number of
answers is equal to the number of reference hosts, that can
be inaccurate because the closest reference host may still be
far from the target.
To overcome this limitation, we propose the Constraint-
Based Geolocation (CBG) approach, which infers the ge-
ographic location of Internet hosts using multilateration.
Multilateration refers to the process of estimating a posi-
tion using a su(cid:14)cient number of distances to some (cid:12)xed
points. As a result, multilateration establishes a continuous
space of answers instead of a discrete one. We use a set of
landmarks to estimate the location of other Internet hosts.
The fundamental idea is that given geographic distances to
a given target host from the landmarks, an estimation of
the location of the target host would be feasible using mul-
tilateration, just as the Global Positioning System (GPS) [5]
does.
A key element of CBG is its ability to accurately transform
delay measurements into distance constraints. The starting
point is the fact that digital information travels along (cid:12)ber
optic cables at almost exactly 2/3 the speed of light in a
vacuum [2, 8]. This means that any particular delay mea-
surement immediately provides an upper bound on the great-
circle distance between the endpoints. The upper bound is
the delay measurement divided by the speed of light in (cid:12)ber.
Looking at this from the standpoint of a particular pair of
endpoints, we can reason that there is some theoretical min-
imum delay for packet transmission that is dictated by the
great-circle distance between them. Therefore, the actual
measured delay between them involves only an additive dis-
tortion.
However, if CBG were to use simple delay measurements
directly to infer distance constraints, it would not be very ac-
curate. For accurate results, it is important to estimate and
remove as much of the additive distortion as possible. CBG
does this by self-calibrating the delay measurements taken
from each measurement point. This is done in a distributed
manner as explained in Section 3. After self-calibration,
CBG can more accurately transform a set of measured de-
lays to a target into distance constraints. CBG then uses
multilateration with these distance constraints to establish
a geographic region that contains the target host. Given
the target region, a reasonable \guess" as to the host’s lo-
cation is at the region’s centroid, which is what CBG uses
as a point estimate of the target’s position. Note that, in
contrast to previous approaches, CBG is able to assign a con-
(cid:12)dence region to the given location estimate. This allows a
location-aware application to assess whether the estimate is
su(cid:14)ciently accurate for its needs.
We evaluate CBG using real-life datasets with hosts that
are geographically distributed through the continental U.S.
and Western Europe. Our experimental results are promis-
ing and show that CBG outperforms the previous measure-
ment-based geolocation techniques. The median error dis-
tance is below 25 km for the Western Europe dataset and
below 100 km for the U.S. dataset. For the majority of eval-
uated target hosts, the obtained con(cid:12)dence regions allow a
resolution at the regional level, i.e. about the size of a small
U.S. state like Maryland or a small European country like
Belgium.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the
related work on this (cid:12)eld and points out the contributions
of CBG in contrast to previous approaches. In Section 3, we
introduce CBG and its methodology to use multilateration
with geographic distance constraints based on delay mea-
surements to infer the location of Internet hosts. Following
that, we present in Section 4 our experimental results. Fi-
nally, we conclude in Section 5.
2. GEOLOCATION OF INTERNET HOSTS
2.1 Related Work
A DNS-based approach to provide a geographic location
service of Internet hosts is proposed in RFC 1876 [4]. Nev-
ertheless, the adoption of the DNS-based approach has been
limited since it requires changes in the DNS records and ad-
ministrators have little motivation to register new location
records. Tools such as IP2LL [10] and NetGeo [6] query
Whois databases in order to obtain the location information
recorded therein to infer the geographic location of a host.
Padmanabhan and Subramanian [7] investigate three dif-
ferent techniques to infer the geographic location of an In-
ternet host. The (cid:12)rst technique infers the location of a host
based on the DNS name of the host or another nearby node.
The second technique splits the IP address space into clus-
ters such that all hosts with an IP address within a cluster
are likely to be co-located. Knowing the location of some
hosts in the cluster and assuming they are in agreement, the
technique infers the location of the entire cluster. The third
technique (GeoPing) is the closest to ours, as it is based
on exploiting a possible correlation between geographic dis-
tance and network delay. Given a set of landmarks with
a well-known geographic location, the location estimate for
a target host is the location of the landmark with the most
similar delay pattern to the one observed for the target host.
In GeoPing, the number of possible location estimates is
limited to the number of adopted landmarks, characterizing
a discrete space of answers. Thus, to increase the accuracy
of techniques like GeoPing, it is necessary to add additional
landmarks. In Section 4.3, we compare CBG with GeoPing-
like methods and show that CBG outperforms them.
2.2 Contributions
In this section, we summarize the contributions of CBG
with respect to related work in geolocation of Internet hosts:
(cid:15) CBG establishes a dynamic relationship between IP
addresses and geographic location. This dynamic rela-
tionship results from a measurement-based approach
where landmarks cooperate in a distributed and self-
calibration manner, allowing CBG to adapt itself to
time-varying network conditions. This contrasts with
most previous work that relies on a static relationship;
(cid:15) A major contribution of CBG is to point out that delay
measurements can be transformed to geographic dis-
tance constraints to be used in multilateration. This
potentially leads to more accurate location estimates
of Internet hosts;
(cid:15) CBG o(cid:11)ers a continuous space of answers instead of
a discrete one as do previous measurement-based ap-
proaches;
(cid:15) CBG assigns a con(cid:12)dence region to each location es-
timate, allowing location-aware applications to assess
whether the location estimate has enough resolution
with respect to their needs.
3. CONSTRAINT-BASED GEOLOCATION
3.1 Multilateration with geographic distance
constraints
The physical position of a given point can be estimated
using a su(cid:14)cient number of distances or angle measurements
to some (cid:12)xed points whose positions are known. When
dealing with distances, this process is called multilatera-
tion. Similarly, when dealing with angles, it is called mul-
tiangulation. Strictly speaking, triangulation refers to an
angle-based position estimation process with three reference
points. However, quite often the same term is adopted for
any distance or angle-based position estimation. In spite of
the popularity of the term triangulation, we adopt the more
precise term multilateration through the paper.
The main problem that stems from using multilateration
is the accurate measurement of the distances between the
target point to be located and the reference points. For ex-
ample, the Global Positioning System (GPS) [5] uses mul-
tilateration to three satellites to estimate the position of
a given GPS receiver. In the case of GPS, the distance be-
tween the GPS receiver and a satellite is measured by timing
how long it takes for a signal sent from the satellite to ar-
rive at the GPS receiver. Precise measurement of time and
time interval is at the heart of GPS accuracy. In contrast to
GPS, it is a challenging problem to transform Internet de-
lay measurements to geographic distances accurately. This
is likely to be the reason why direct multilateration has re-
mained so far unexploited for the purposes of geolocating
Internet hosts. Hereafter, we explain the CBG design prin-
ciples that enable the multilateration with geographic dis-
tance constraints.
For the location of Internet hosts using multilateration,
we tackle the problem of estimating the geographic distance
from the target host to be located to these landmarks given
the delay measurements to the landmarks. The fundamen-
tal insight for the CBG methodology is that, no matter the
reason, delay is only distorted additively with respect to
the time for light in (cid:12)ber to pass over the great-circle path.
Therefore, we are interested in bene(cid:12)ting from this invari-
ant by developing a method to estimate geographic distance
constraints from these additively distorted delay measure-
ments. How CBG use this insight to infer the geographic
distance constraints between the landmarks and the target
host from delay measurements is detailed in Section 3.2. It
is also shown that as a consequence of the additive delay
distortion, the resulting geographic distance constraints are
generally overestimated with respect to the real distances.
3.2 From delay measurements to distance
constraints
Before we introduce how CBG converts from delay mea-
surements to geographic distance constraints, let us (cid:12)rst ob-
serve a sample scatter plot relating geographic distance and
network delay. This sample, shown in Fig. 1, is taken from
the experiments described in Section 4. The x-axis is the
geographic distance and the y-axis is the network delay be-
tween a given landmark Li and the remaining landmarks.
The meanings of \baseline" and \bestline" in Fig. 1 are ex-
plained along this section.
Recent work [7, 11, 14] investigates the correlation coe(cid:14)-
cient found within this kind of scatter plot, deriving a least
squares (cid:12)tting line to characterize the relationship between
geographic distance and network delay. In contrast, we con-
sider the reasons why points are scattered in the plot above,
and argue that what is important is not the least-squares
(cid:12)t, but the tightest lower linear bound.
Based on these considerations, we propose a novel ap-
proach to establish a dynamic relationship between network
delay and geographic distance. In order to illustrate this ap-
proach, suppose the existence of great-circle paths between
the landmark Li and each one of the remaining landmarks.
Further, consider also that, when traveling on these great-
circle paths, data are only subject to the propagation de-
lay of the communication medium. In this perfect case, we
should have a straight line comprising this relationship that
is given by the slope-intercept form y = mx + b, where b = 0
