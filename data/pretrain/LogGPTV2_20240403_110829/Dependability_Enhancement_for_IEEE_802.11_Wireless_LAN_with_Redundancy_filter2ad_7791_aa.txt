### Abstract
Physical obstacles and radio interference in wireless networks create "shadow regions" where mobile stations lose connectivity. In cellular networks, careful cell planning is used to minimize these shadow regions. However, in 802.11b/g WLANs, the limited frequency spectrum makes it challenging to prevent shadow regions by adding additional cells at different frequencies.

This paper proposes an alternative approach to enhance connection dependability by tolerating the existence of shadow regions. A redundant access point (AP) is placed in the shadow region to serve mobile stations that roam into this area. The redundant AP operates on the same frequency as the primary AP, thus not forming a separate cell. We consider two configurations for the communication between the primary and secondary APs: one where the secondary AP is connected to the same distribution system (DS) as the primary AP, and another where the secondary AP acts as a wireless forwarding bridge for traffic to/from the mobile stations in the shadow region.

We outline the details of implementing redundancy by enhancing the basic 802.11 channel access protocol. To evaluate the network's dependability, we present a reliability, availability, and survivability analysis for both configurations and compare them with a scheme without redundancy. Numerical examples demonstrate that the redundancy schemes significantly improve connection dependability.

### 1. Introduction
IEEE 802.11, published in 1997, is a standard for wireless local area networks (WLANs). The general structure of an IEEE 802.11 network includes mobile stations in each basic service set (BSS) connected to the wired network through an access point (AP), which acts as a bridge between the wireline and wireless networks. Multiple BSSs connected by a Distribution System (DS) form an extended service set (ESS). While Ethernet is the preferred DS in enterprises, other deployments such as military or law enforcement might use wireless DSs like satellite or microwave connections.

Dependability in cellular networks has been extensively studied due to the high demands of voice applications. In contrast, 802.11 networks were initially designed for high-speed data connectivity. With the increasing deployment of multimedia applications, particularly Voice over IP (VoIP), network delay and connection reliability have become critical issues. Additionally, high dependability is essential in military applications where multiple 802.11 terminals connect to an AP via satellite or microwave links.

A common cause of reduced wireless network dependability is the presence of "shadow regions" caused by physical obstacles and radio interference. In cellular networks, careful cell planning prevents these regions. However, in 802.11 networks, the limited ISM frequency band (2.412 GHz to 2.472 GHz) divided into 13 channels, with only three non-interfering channels available, makes it infeasible to cover shadow areas by adding new BSSs.

Our contribution is to propose an approach that tolerates the existence of shadow regions by placing a redundant (secondary) AP in the shadow region. This redundant AP operates on the same frequency as the primary AP and does not form a separate cell. It forwards uplink data from mobile stations in the shadow area to the main AP and downlink data from the main AP to the mobile stations. The primary and secondary APs coordinate channel access across all wireless stations within the cell.

We consider two configurations for the redundant AP scheme:
1. **DS Configuration**: The secondary AP is connected to the same DS as the primary AP.
2. **Forwarding Configuration**: The secondary AP acts as a wireless forwarding bridge for traffic to/from the mobile stations in the shadow region.

While the concept of adding redundancy for high dependability is well-known, its implementation in WLANs is novel. We sketch how to implement these configurations using IEEE 802.11 protocols, building on the IEEE 802.11e task group's work for QoS provisions in the MAC layer. Channel reservation concepts in 802.11e can be applied to reserve resources for the redundant AP, ensuring fair and efficient channel access.

We also quantitatively evaluate and compare the dependability of the DS and Forwarding configurations, focusing on end-to-end reliability, availability, and survivability. These measures provide valuable references for balancing implementation complexity and system dependability.

### 2. Background of IEEE 802.11 Medium Access Control Mechanisms
The media access control mechanisms in our proposed schemes are based on IEEE 802.11 and 802.11e protocols. The 802.11 WLAN has two channel access mechanisms: Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) and Point Coordination Function (PCF).

**DCF** is based on Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) and uses two techniques for packet transmission:
1. **Two-way Handshaking**: A positive acknowledgment (ACK) is sent by the destination station upon successful reception.
2. **Four-way Handshaking (RTS/CTS)**: The sender sends an RTS frame to reserve the channel, and the receiver responds with a CTS frame before the actual data transmission.

**PCF** uses polling, where stations are polled in sequence and send packets when polled.

To support QoS, the IEEE 802.11e supplement introduces the Hybrid Coordination Function (HCF), which combines aspects of DCF and PCF. HCF provides prioritized and parameterized QoS access to the wireless medium through:
- **Extended DCF (EDCF)**: Differentiated, distributed access for 8 delivery priorities, each with distinct arbitration interframe space (AIFS) and contention window limits (CWmin and CWmax).
- **Extended PCF (EPCF)**: Contention-free access managed by a QoS-aware access point (hybrid coordinator, HC), which allocates transmission opportunities (TXOPs) based on QoS needs.

### 3. DS Configuration and Implementation
In the DS configuration, the secondary AP is connected to the same DS as the primary AP. This setup ensures that the secondary AP can forward traffic from the shadow region to the primary AP and vice versa. The placement requirement is that the secondary AP must cover the shadow area.

### 4. Forwarding Configuration and Implementation
In the Forwarding configuration, the secondary AP acts as a wireless forwarding bridge. The secondary AP and the primary AP must be within radio sight of each other, allowing the secondary AP to forward traffic between the shadow region and the primary AP. The benefit of this configuration is that the secondary AP is mobile, allowing it to be repositioned to accommodate changes in the shadow region.

### 5. Dependability Evaluation
We evaluate the dependability of the DS and Forwarding configurations by comparing them with a scheme without redundancy. The measures include end-to-end reliability, availability, and survivability. Numerical examples demonstrate that the redundancy schemes significantly improve connection dependability.

### 6. Numerical Examples
We present numerical examples to illustrate the improvements in dependability achieved by the redundancy schemes. These examples provide concrete evidence of the benefits of the proposed configurations.

### 7. Conclusion
This paper proposes a novel approach to enhance the dependability of IEEE 802.11 WLANs by tolerating the existence of shadow regions through the use of redundant APs. We consider two configurations for the redundant AP scheme and provide detailed implementation strategies. Our quantitative evaluation shows that the redundancy schemes significantly improve connection dependability, making them valuable for applications requiring high reliability and availability.
