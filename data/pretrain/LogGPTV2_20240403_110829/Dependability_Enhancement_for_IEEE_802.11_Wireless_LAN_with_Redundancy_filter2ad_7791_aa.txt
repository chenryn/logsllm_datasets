Abstract
The presence of physical obstacles and radio interfer-
ence results in the so called “shadow regions” in wireless
networks. When a mobile station roams into a shadow re-
gion, it loses its network connectivity. In cellular networks,
in order to minimize the connection unreliability, careful
cell planning is required to prevent the occurrance of the
shadow regions in the ﬁrst place.
In 802.11b/g wireless
LANs, however, due to the limited frequency spectrum, it is
not always possible to prevent a shadow region by adding
another cell at a different frequency.
Our contribution in this paper is to propose the alternate
approach of tolerating the existence of “shadow regions” as
opposed to prevention in order to enhance the connection
dependability. A redundant access point (AP) is placed in
the shadow region to serve the mobile stations which roam
into that region. Since the redundant AP operates on the
same frequency as the primary AP, it does not constitute a
separate cell. In fact, the primary and the secondary AP
communicate to grant medium access to stations within the
shadow region. We consider two conﬁgurations, which dif-
fer in how the two APs communicate with each other. In the
ﬁrst, the secondary AP is connected to the same distribu-
tion system as the primary AP. In the second, the secondary
AP acts as a wireless forwarding bridge for trafﬁc to/from
the mobile stations in the shadow region to the primary AP.
The paper outlines the details of how redundancy may be
implemented by making enhancements to the basic 802.11
channel access protocol.
To evaluate the dependability of the network under study,
we present the reliability, availability and survivability
analysis of the two conﬁgurations and compare them with
the scheme with no redundancy. With numerical exam-
ples, we show that the redundancy schemes demonstrate
signiﬁcant improvement in connection dependability over

1 Introduction
As a standard for wireless local area networks, IEEE
802.11 was published in 1997 [1]. The general structure
of an IEEE 802.11 network is shown in Figure 1. The mo-
bile stations in each basic service set (BSS) are connected
to the wired network through an access point (AP), which
acts as a “bridge” between the wireline and wireless net-
work. The collection of BSSs connected by a Distribution
System (DS) is called an extended service set (ESS). The DS
of choice in enterprises is Ethernet. Other deployments for
military, law enforcement etc. might require a wireless DS
such as satellite or microwave connections.
While the dependability aspect in cellular networks is

extensively studied [9] [10] [8], this has not been the case
for 802.11 networks. The reason is that the cellular net-
works were built for voice application from the get go,
which demands high dependability, whereas the primary
goal for 802.11 networks was high speed data connectivity.
As these networks have now become commodity items with
widespread deployment, multimedia applications, speciﬁ-
cally voice over IP (VoIP), are starting to be deployed mak-
ing network delay and connection reliability very impor-
tant issues in 802.11 networks as well. Another domain
where high dependability is desired is for military use. Sev-
eral 802.11 terminals might connect to an AP which may
communicate with the command center via satellite or mi-
crowave link. Here, simply the ability to remain connected
to the AP is of paramount importance.
A typical cause that affects wireless network dependabil-
ity (from the perspective of the wireless station) is the cov-
erage problem introduced mainly by physical obstacles and
radio interference, which results in the so called “shadow
regions”. When a mobile station roams into a shadow re-
gion, it loses its network connectivity. In cellular networks,
in order to minimize the connection unreliability, careful
cell planning is required to prevent the occurance of the
shadow regions in the ﬁrst place.
Unlike cellular telephone networks, 802.11 networks
work in the very limited ISM (Industrial, scientiﬁc and
ranging from 2.412GHz to
medical) frequency bands,
2.472GHz. This band is further divided into 13 channels,
each occupying 5MHz bandwidth. Since operating frequen-
cies in adjacent basic service sets (BSS’s) must be separated
by ﬁve channels to prevent inter-access point interference
[5], only three channels are available to construct an ex-
tended service set (ESS) consisting of several BSS’s. Fig-
ure 2 shows a typical frequency planning scheme for 802.11
networks to cover large areas.
With this scenario, the coverage problem arises when ob-
stacles exist in any of these BSS’s and form the shadow ar-
eas that cannot be reached by the AP. Unlike the cellular net-
works, it is not always feasible to cover such shadow areas
by building a new BSS operating with a channel that would
not interfere with neighboring BSS’s. For example, if any
shadow area exist in one of the cells in Figure 2, we cannot
build a new BSS for the shadow area since there is no avail-
able channel left that would not interfere with the neigh-
bouring cells.
In this sense, wireless LAN exhibit lower
dependability than its cellular network counterpart.
Our contribution in this paper is to propose the alternate
approach of tolerating the existance of “shadow regions” as
opposed to prevention in order to enhance the connection
dependability. A redundant (also called a secondary) ac-
cess point (AP) is placed in the shadow region to serve the
mobile stations which roam into that region. Since the re-
dundant AP operates on the same frequency as the primary
AP, it does not constitute a separate cell. This redundant AP
takes the responsibility to forward the uplink data from mo-
bile stations in the shadow area to the main AP, and forward
the downlink data from the main AP to the mobile stations.
The primary and the secondary AP communicate with each
other and coordinate the channel access across all wireless
stations within that cell (including ones in the shadow re-
gion).
We consider two conﬁgurations of the redundant access
point scheme, which differ in how the primary and the sec-
ondary access points communicate with each other. In the
ﬁrst, the secondary AP is connected to the same distribution
system (DS) as the primary AP. As mentioned before, in an
Enterprise, the DS is typically a 10/100 Mbps Ethernet. In
another conﬁguration, the secondary AP acts as a wireless
forwarding bridge for trafﬁc to/from the mobile stations in
the shadow region to the primary AP. While the only place-
ment requirement in the ﬁrst conﬁguration is that the sec-
ondary AP cover the shadow area, the second conﬁguration
has an additional requirement that the secondary AP and the
primary AP be within radio sight of each other. The beneﬁt
of the second conﬁguration is that the secondary AP itself
is mobile. In other words, its placement could be changed
to accommodate changes in the shadow region within that
cell. For the rest of the paper, we shall refer to the two
conﬁgurations as the “DS conﬁguration” and the “For-
warding conﬁguration” respectively.
While the method of adding redundancy to achieve high
dependability is well known, the implementation details
vary in different systems. To our knowledge, the use of
redundant APs to enhance WLAN dependability has not
been proposed in previous literature. Therefore, in this pa-
per, we also sketch how to implement the two conﬁgura-
tions with IEEE 802.11 protocols. The goal in the imple-
mentation is to allow more than one access-point to operate
in one cell at the same frequency, keeping in mind the is-
sues of channel access fairness, system efﬁciency, as well as
collision avoidance. Our proposed channel access method
builds upon techniques currently being proposed and de-
bated in the IEEE 802.11e task group speciﬁcally for QoS
provisions in the MAC layer [2], which requires minimal

revision of current 802.11 protocols. The choice of IEEE
802.11e is based on the fact that channel reservation con-
cepts in 802.11e protocols can readily be applied to reserve
channel resources for the redundant access-point (in both
conﬁgurations). With channel reservation, it is possible to
allocate different time slots for stations inside and outside
the shadow areas to use the channel. In this way, collisions
are avoided and fairness among stations is easier to realize.
Another contribution of this paper is that we have quan-
titatively evaluated and compared the dependability of the
“DS conﬁguration”and the “Forwarding conﬁguration” of
the redundant AP scheme. The measures of interest in-
clude end to end reliability, availability and survivability.
Such quantitative measures may provide valuable reference
when a compromise between implementation complexity
and system dependability is to be made in realistic imple-
mentations.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2
we present relevant background material of IEEE 802.11
WLAN, Section 3 discusses the DS Conﬁguration and its
implementation, and Section 4 addresses the Forwarding
conﬁguration. In Section 5 we evaluate the dependability of
the two conﬁgurations in comparison with the scheme with
no redundancy, and in Section 6 some numerical examples
are presented. Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper.
2 Background of IEEE 802.11 medium ac-
cess control mechanisms
Since the media access mechanisms of our proposed
schemes are based on IEEE 802.11 and 802.11e protocols,
we brieﬂy review these protocols. The details could be
found in [1] and [2] respectively.
The IEEE 802.11 WLAN has two different channel ac-
cessing mechanisms, namely, the distributed coordination
function (DCF) and point coordination function (PCF).
DCF is based on the carrier sense multiple access with
collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) mechanism, while PCF is
based on the polling technique. The DCF mode of oper-
ation consists of two techniques for packet transmission.
The default scheme is a two-way handshaking technique
where a positive acknowledgment is transmitted by the des-
tination station upon successful reception of a packet from
the sender station. The reason for an ACK is that the
sender cannot determine whether its transmission is suc-
cessful only by listening to its own transmission. An-
other scheme involves a four-way handshaking technique
known as request-to-send/clear-to-send (RTS/CTS) mecha-
nism. By this scheme, the sender ﬁrst sends the RTS frame
to reserve the channel before its transmission, and upon re-
ceiving the CTS frame from the receiver, the normal packet
transmission and the ACK response proceeds. On the other
hand, for the PCF mode of operation, stations are polled in
sequence, and the station with a packet pending for trans-
mission sends out the packet upon being polled.
To support applications with QoS requirements,
the
IEEE 802.11e supplement is currently under development,
which is based on the IEEE 802.11 and the 802.11a,
802.11b and 802.11d supplements. To support QoS, the
concept of hybrid coordination function (HCF) is intro-
duced for the media access control mechanism. HCF is up-
ward compatible with DCF and PCF, and at the same time
it provides QoS stations with prioritized and parameterized
QoS access to the wireless medium. HCF combines aspects
of both the contention-based and the polling-based access
mechanisms. The contention-based channel access mecha-
nism of the HCF is called extended DCF (EDCF) and the
contention-free channel access mechanism of the HCF is
called the extended PCF (EPCF).
EDCF provides differentiated, distributed access to the
wireless medium for 8 delivery priorities, each correspond-
ing to an individual prioritized output queue. Each output
queue contends for transmission opportunity (TXOP) using
an enhanced variant of DCF wherein
• The minimum speciﬁed idle duration time is not the
constant value of 50 µsec (called DIFS), but is a dis-
tinct value (called arbitration IFS, or AIFS) for each
distinct queue;
• The value of contention window limits, CWmin and
CWmax, from which the random backoff is computed,
are associated with each individual queues;
• Lower priority queues defer to higher priority queues
within the same station; and
• when a higher priority queue collides with a lower pri-
ority queue, the higher priority queue gains the TXOP
and the lower priority queue behaves as if there were
an external collision on the wireless medium and per-
form the backoff.
The EPCF channel access method is imposed by a QoS-
aware access point, called a hybrid coordinator (HC). The
HC is responsible for allocating transmission opportunities
to the associated wireless stations based on their QoS needs.
It uses the point coordinator’s higher channel access prior-
ity to grab the wireless medium and then send out special
frames called QoS-Poll frames to allocate the TXOPs. The
actual scheduling of TXOPs across all wireless stations is
based on predeﬁned priority, service rate, delay and jitter re-
quirements of applications on the wireless stations. A QoS
wireless station may also send speciﬁc requests for trans-
mission opportunities with the frequency and duration of
each TXOP in a special request known as Reservation Re-
quest or RR, to the HC. The frame containing the request
itself is sent by the wireless station using the EDCF mode
