are similar. ByzCast, on the contrary, is genuine for local
messages, which have a considerably smaller latency up to
the 99.5-th percentile, as exhibited in Fig. 7(b). For global
messages, ByzCast and Baseline have similar performance. It
is worth noticing that in ByzCast local messages do not suffer
from the “convoy effect”, a phenomenon in which the slower
ordering of global messages can impact the latency of local
ones [37]. In fact, the local-message latency CDF for ByzCast
with 10% of global messages is very similar to the latency for
100% local messages.
H. Latency without contention in WAN
The ﬁrst experiment
in WAN measures the latency of
ByzCast without any queuing effect or resources overload.
A single client from each region multicasts local and global
messages in a closed loop. The conclusions, shown in Fig. 8,
47
are similar to those we drew in a LAN. ByzCast has latency as
good as a single group (BFT-SMaRt) for local messages and
twice the value for global ones. In ByzCast, clients multicast
global messages via an auxiliary group that totally orders
all messages before broadcasting them to target groups, what
explains the doubled latency. The Baseline protocol pays this
double ordering for every message.
I. Performance with mixed workload in WAN
The last experiment evaluates ByzCast with a mix of local
and global messages in a proportion of 10:1, which we
believe would represent a more realistic workload. The setup
comprehends 4 target groups, 1 auxiliary group to order global
messages, and 40 clients per target group equally distributed
among the 4 geographical regions. The results presented in
Fig. 9 shows that ByzCast is 2x to 3x faster than the Baseline
protocol in terms of throughput. Fig. 10 shows the latency
CDF for global and local messages. As expected, ByzCast
has local latency 2x to 4x smaller than the values for the
Baseline protocol. Regarding global messages, both protocols
behave similarly as exposed by previous experiments in LAN
and WAN. The latency CDF also conﬁrms that ByzCast does
not suffer from the convoy effect, as the local latency is stable
even in the presence of global messages.
VI. RELATED WORK
ByzCast is at the intersection of two topics: atomic multicast
(§VI-A) and BFT protocols (§VI-B).
A. Atomic Multicast
Several multicast and broadcast algorithms have been pro-
posed [38]. Moreover, many systems use “ad hoc” ordering
