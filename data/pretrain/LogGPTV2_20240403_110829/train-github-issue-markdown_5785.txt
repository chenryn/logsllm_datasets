There should be a mode of Deno that is maximum sandbox -  
-No file system access at all (including modules, etc) except for the initial deno command. Put the onus on the developer to package all js/ts in a single file.  
-No network at all, except for the ability to respond to http requests from localhost on a single port. no call-out of any kind.  
-No console access at all.  
-Any error should just successfully exit the process, no error reporting into the OS?  
-No command execution at all (except for the initial Deno)  
-No nothing of anything else. Just CPU, Memory, the ability to read a single file on startup, and the ability to respond to a single http response to another process on localhost.  
-Would be nice to limit the request/response size of the http request
The OS/public facing process will handle  
-if the process runs too long  
-if Deno attempts to use too much ram or cpu time or use multiple cores
