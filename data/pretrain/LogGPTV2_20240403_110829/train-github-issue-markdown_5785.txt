### Proposal for a Maximum Sandbox Mode in Deno

We propose the introduction of a "Maximum Sandbox" mode in Deno, designed to provide an extremely secure and controlled environment. This mode would be ideal for running untrusted or third-party code with minimal risk. Below are the key restrictions and features of this mode:

1. **File System Access:**
   - **No file system access** is allowed, including modules, except for the initial Deno command.
   - The developer must package all JavaScript/TypeScript code into a single file.

2. **Network Access:**
   - **No network access** is permitted, except for the ability to respond to HTTP requests from `localhost` on a single, predefined port.
   - No outbound network calls of any kind are allowed.

3. **Console Access:**
   - **No console access** is provided. The process should not have the ability to read from or write to the console.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Any errors should cause the process to exit successfully without reporting the error to the operating system.

5. **Command Execution:**
   - **No command execution** is allowed, except for the initial Deno command.

6. **Resource Limitations:**
   - The process should have no other capabilities beyond CPU and memory usage.
   - It should be able to read a single file at startup and respond to a single HTTP request from another process on `localhost`.

7. **HTTP Request/Response Size:**
   - It would be beneficial to limit the size of the HTTP request and response to prevent abuse.

8. **Operating System Monitoring:**
   - The OS or a public-facing process will handle:
     - **Process Duration:** If the process runs for too long, it should be terminated.
     - **Resource Usage:** If Deno attempts to use too much RAM, CPU time, or multiple cores, it should be restricted or terminated.

This mode ensures that the Deno process operates in a highly controlled and secure environment, minimizing the risk of malicious activities and resource abuse.
