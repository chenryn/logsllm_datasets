I used `setup.py install` today to install matplotlib in a venv. I got some
rather hard to tackle tracebacks, as they were filled with exec's (meaning one
can not see what the actual code is that fails).
Ultimately this was caused by pyparsing calling `.filename` and `.lineno` on a
tuple (it obviously expected some kind of different object). But the tuple did
contain a filename and a lineno as the first two elements, and some other
stuff (the tuple seemed to be coming from the backtrace package). This code
was wrapped in something like `if PY3: ...`
As a random guess I decided to downgrade pyparsing from 2.1.2 to 2.1.1, and
this solved the problem. Unfortunately, I am not able to reproduce this
anymore, even when upgrading pyparsing to 2.1.2. Still I though a heads-up
might be in place, if someone seems `AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no
attribute 'filename'` with a traceback that is more of less useless.
