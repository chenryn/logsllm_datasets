User: How to test the system performance of a server? Please list the test tools and test metrics.
Assistant: Test tools: 1. Perf: a performance analysis tool that can be used in Linux systems to measure performance parameters such as CPU, memory, and disk; 2. Sysbench: a Lua-based multi-threaded benchmark tool that can test MySQL The server simulates production usage under various loads; 3. Apache JMeter: a performance testing tool developed by the Apache Foundation, which can test the performance parameters of web applications, such as bandwidth, response time, throughput, etc.; 4 . Iometer: A free test tool provided by Microsoft, which can perform disk performance tests, mainly used to test the performance of network storage devices. Test indicators: 1. CPU utilization: used to evaluate the performance of the processor, high CPU utilization indicates that the server is more efficient in processing tasks; 2. Memory usage: this indicator can measure the memory usage of the server during operation In some cases, high memory usage may mean that the server needs to be upgraded with more RAM; 3. Bandwidth: used to evaluate the network speed, specifically measure the speed of data transmission and the size of data transfer; 4. Disk IO performance: can measure the disk read The speed of writing operations, including indicators such as average read/write time and maximum/minimum transfer speed.
