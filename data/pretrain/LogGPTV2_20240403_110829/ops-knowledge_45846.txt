The first three parts of the log are index, timestamp, and log level. Without considering these three parts, Here we assume that the variables in the logs are represented as '<*>', separated by spaces between tokens. What is the specific log template for the above logs?

A: jk2_init() Found child <*> in scoreboard slot <*> 和 jk2_init() Can't find child <*> in scoreboard
B: workerEnv.init() ok <*> 和 [client <*>] Directory index forbidden by rule: <*>
C: workerEnv.init() ok <*> 和 mod_jk child workerEnv in error state <*>
D: mod_jk child workerEnv in error state <*> 和 [client <*>] Directory index forbidden by rule: <*>
