with relevance to the GDPR and the CCPA.
"Whatever", "Sounds good", and "Accept and move on" that may
not qualify as affirmative consent.
TrustArc dialogues display more closed-customization in terms
of button structure but have much less open-customization in terms
of button wording. Of the 156 websites embedding TrustArc: 7%
have a dialogue with a first-page button that instantly opts out;
12% have a first-page opt-out that must establish a connection with
multiple partners (we measure the time to do so in Section 4.3); 44%
include a first-page button that implies the user has autonomy; 31%
have a link or button that does not imply the user has control; 4.4%
hide their dialogue from EU IP addresses. TrustArc dialogues tend
to define essential cookies for which there is no opt-out option.
This, in combination with hiding dialogues from EU users, results
from the product being tailored to the CCPA.
Finally, we estimate that about 8% of websites use CMPs for their
APIs only and design custom consent dialogues themselves. This
form of publisher customization presents a very practical problem:
while these websites collect a standardized form of consent, each
website does so in their own unique way, which may or may not
comply with local legislation. As CMPs share consent across web-
sites [60], this unreliable consent signal will then be re-used by
other websites and third parties.
4.2 Measuring Third Party Vendors
The next two items of interest concern the purposes and lawful
basis claimed by vendors for processing personal data. Using con-
ventional methods, estimating how third-parties use personal data
would require accessing and processing the privacy policy of each,
324
which could be costly if repeated for longitudinal insights. In con-
trast, the IAB‚Äôs standard allows us to measure this longitudinally for
vendors on the Global Vendor List (GVL). In fact, the organization
managing the GVL switched to weekly updates so we can detect
all changes.
Figure 7 speaks to I4. It shows that both the size of the number
of vendors and the reported purposes in the IAB‚Äôs Global Vendor
List have grown over time, with a sharp spike as GDPR came into
effect. The first purpose, which allows vendors to collect and access
personal data, is always the most popular. In Figure 7, it is difficult
to track which movements are due to firms joining and which are
due to an existing coalition member changing.
The changes made by existing members are summarized in Fig-
ure 8. This shows the surprising result that on net more vendors
are now obtaining consent for purposes they used to claim as a
legitimate interest than the other way round, which speaks to I5.
This suggests that as time has passed, vendors on the GVL are
obtaining more consent. The most activity regarding these changes
took place around GDPR coming into effect, followed by another
bout of activity in March and April 2020, possibly as vendors saw
how GDPR was being enforced.
4.3 Measuring the User-Interface
Our results conclude with some findings regarding time costs re-
lated to consent dialogues. Our first item of interest here is the
time it takes to send consent signals to multiple vendors (I6). We
repeatedly measured the user‚Äôs waiting time when they opt-out
on a consent dialog provided by TrustArc and report the median
numbers here. Figure 9 shows the opt-out process, which takes at

least 7 clicks and 34s to complete (not including user interaction).
This delay results from sending opt-out requests to multiple third
parties and additional JavaScript timeouts. Compared to accepting
cookies, opting out causes an additional 279 HTTP(S) requests to
25 domains, which amounts to an additional 1.2 MB / 5.8 MB of data
transfer (compressed / uncompressed). Thus in 12% of the websites
embedding TrustArc (see Section 4.1), opting out is associated with
a significant time and network cost for the user.
Second, we measured how the dialog interaction time varies
depending on which privacy preferences are expressed (I7). Instead
of using an artificial dialog design, we conducted a randomized
experiment using Quantcast‚Äôs real consent dialog in two different
configurations further described in Section 3.2. In short, the first
configuration included a direct reject button which was replaced
with a ‚ÄúMore Options‚Äù button in the second one (see Figures A.1‚Äì
A.3). Section 4.1 showed that the first and second option were
respectively used by 55% and 45% of websites embedding Quantcast
dialogues. We exclude users who made no decision within the
first three minutes after page load. In total, consent dialogs were
shown to 2910 visitors from the EU (as per Quantcast‚Äôs default
configuration).
Our results are summarized in Figure 10: If Quantcast‚Äôs dialog
with a direct reject button is shown, it took the median user 3.2s to
accept and 3.6s to deny consent. This difference is small but already
statistically significant using a nonparametric test that is robust to
skewed distibutions (Mann‚ÄìWhitney ùëà (ùëÅaccept = 1344, ùëÅreject =
279) = 166582, ùëß = ‚àí2.93, ùëù < 0.01). If no direct reject button is
shown, the median time it takes users to deny consent doubles to
6.7 seconds, which is highly significant (ùëà (ùëÅaccept = 1152, ùëÅreject =
135) = 30494, ùëß = ‚àí11.57, ùëù < 0.001). Additionally, the consent rate
increases from 83% to 90%. In summary, we find that depending on
the dialog design, the interaction time increases greatly for users
who intend to opt out.
5 DISCUSSION
Section 5.1 discusses measurement issues like sampling and gen-
eralizing. Section 5.2 discusses the prevalence, significance, and
future of consent management provision.
5.1 Methodological Implications
Social Media Sampling. Sampling URLs from social media posts
is a novel approach through which we captured 161 million web
pages from 4.2 million unique domains over a period of 2.5 years.
This significantly exceeds the sample size and windows used in
related work (see Figure 1). Building on recent approaches [55],
subsite sampling is more tolerant to the many idiosyncrasies re-
garding how CMPs are embedded in the wild. At the same time,
this sample is influenced by the social media websites‚Äô content fil-
tering policies and‚Äìmore importantly‚Äìheavily skewed towards the
‚Äòattention economy‚Äô. Such websites tend to be funded by collecting
personal data, for which consent needs to be obtained. This bias is
useful as we are more likely to sample websites that include CMPs.
We complement our social media crawling with a more tradi-
tional approach using the Tranco toplist. This means the propor-
tions we estimate in Figures 5 and 6 are not affected by the social
media sampling bias. However, top-lists are not representative of
a meaningful population either, such as total web-page views or
distinct sites visited by users. Given that both bottom-up sampling
from social media posts and top-down sampling from toplists over-
samples a certain population [49] with no ground-truth to adjust
for it, using both approaches seems a defensible way forward.
Web Privacy Measurements. The notion that a web-page has a
single set of observer-independent privacy features is dead [58]. We
demonstrated that CMP adoption is influenced by local legislation
and measurement results depend on vantage point (see Figure 1).
Future empirical studies should take this into account and explain
the implications for generalizing findings if only one vantage point
is used.
Similarly, the occurrence of CMPs varies greatly depending on
the toplist size (see Figure 5). From 4% in the Top 100, it reaches
13% in the Top 1k, and then falls in the long-tail down to 1.51% for

the Top 1M. These stark differences emphasize the importance of
both sample size and choice of toplist from which it is drawn.
Web scraping can exploit common code structure across websites
embedding CMPs. Such research designs can be scaled across the
long tail of website popularity, which complements the qualitative
analysis of tech giants [18]. However, it is not clear how such results
generalize beyond websites employing CMPs. Similarly, we do not
know how our results, based on six of the most popular CMPs, apply
to niche CMPs6 or websites self-implementing the TCF framework.
Measuring Ad-Tech Behavior. Given frameworks such as the TCF,
the legal basis for third-party vendors can now be publicly queried
and measured over time (see Figures 7 and 8) whereas previously
this information was stored on corporate networks. However, we
still cannot easily detect whether vendors adhere to self-declared
policy.
5.2 Privacy Implications
Prevalence. We observed that CMPs are embedded in ever more
websites over time and that privacy laws coming into effect caused
spikes in adoption. The few times the GDPR was enforced had
little observable effect (see Figure 6), although this could change
if sanctions increase in frequency or significance. There is further
churn between CMPs with Cookiebot functioning as a ‚Äògateway
CMP‚Äô that many websites adopt before migrating onto other CMPs
(see Figure 4).
Significance. CMPs are standardizing privacy communications.
The resulting legal terms, dialogue interface, and protocol for com-
municating with vendors should be seen as a de-facto standard, at
least among that CMP‚Äôs customers. Such standards were developed
by self-interested private companies and not in the open bodies like
the IETF or W3C, which raises questions about the politics of stan-
dards [26]. More positively, the consistent web interfaces provided
by CMPs help researchers discover possible privacy violations at
scale [32, 39], which mirrors researchers auditing compliance to
credit card security standards [31, 46].
Beyond technical standards, CMPs can also influence social
norms around privacy by herding websites. This can be seen in the
linguistic shift from cookies to scripts that was only observed in
5.5% of the websites embedding OneTrust. This is likely a strategic
move to escape the negative associations of cookies [54]. Herding

may also strengthen the widely documented habituation effect in
both privacy [5, 24, 59] and security notices [12].
Compliance with privacy laws drives CMP adoption, as evi-
denced by the spikes after the laws come into effect, and yet liability
for violations is an open question. Quantcast maintain that ‚Äúwith
great customizability comes great responsibility‚Äù, which suggests
they believe websites are liable for using terms like ‚Äúwhatever‚Äù
as an affirmative signal of consent. Yet Quantcast offer dialogue
functionality in which accepting takes 1-click while rejecting takes
multiple, which is adopted by 45% of their customers, despite the
French regulator‚Äôs guidance against this practice [10].
Buttons allowing 1-click rejection are even rarer among web-
sites embedding TrustArc (7%) and OneTrust (2.4%). The CMPs may
know something its clients do not given trustarc.com implements
an instant, 1-click reject all button. Disentangling whether these
differences are driven by CMP business practices or pre-existing
customer characteristics (e.g jurisdiction) can help prioritize regu-
latory interventions. The important role of intermediaries in (not)
preventing abuse is an endearing lesson from information secu-
rity economics [8, 35, 52], why would privacy economics be any
different?
