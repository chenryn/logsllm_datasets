### Understanding Path Inflation and Peering Policies

When the destination and the optimal peering point are to the west, the first step in understanding path inflation caused by peering policies is to identify which policies are in use and why. Common peering policies include early-exit and late-exit.

#### Early-Exit Routing
In early-exit routing, the upstream ISP uses a fixed peering point per source, typically the one closest to the source, regardless of the destination. This policy minimizes the distance the traffic travels within the upstream ISP's network.

#### Late-Exit Routing
Late-exit routing involves the upstream ISP carrying the packets further than necessary to reach the closest peering point, moving them closer to the destination. In the extreme case, this policy is source-independent, as the chosen peering point depends solely on the destination. Late-exit requires cooperation among ISPs because the upstream ISP cannot independently determine the packet's final destination within the downstream ISP. The downstream ISP must publish information (typically via MED attributes in BGP) about the cost to reach destinations from each peering point, and the upstream ISP must cooperate by routing traffic accordingly.

#### Load-Balancing
A third peering policy is load-balancing, where an upstream ISP distributes traffic across multiple peering links to balance the load.

### Classification of Routing Patterns

We classify routing patterns using the simplest explanation consistent with our traces. We exclude ISP pairs for which we observe only a single peering point. The remaining pairs are classified as early if only one peering point is seen from each ingress. The rest show "engineering" (assuming early-exit as the default), and the first question is whether this engineering is consistent with late-exit.

To determine if the engineering appears cooperative in preventing latency inflation, we identify paths as "late" if the upstream ISP delivers the traffic to a peering point closer to the destination in the downstream ISP. Specifically, the path length from the peering point to the destination in the downstream ISP is less than from the early exit to the destination.

We classify policies into three broad categories:
1. **Late Exit, Often**: Represents a pattern of late exit for most paths.
2. **Late Exit, Sometimes**: Represents a selective pattern of late exit for a minority of paths.
3. **Engineered, but Not Late**: Represents a pattern where the downstream ISP carries traffic over longer paths, possibly as part of a load-balancing strategy.

### Analysis of ISP Pairs

In Figure 7, we show that while half of all ISP pairs route at least half of their prefixes using early-exit, many do not, indicating widespread cooperation among ISPs. There is significant variation in the degree of path engineering. To the right of the graph, 20–30% of ISP pairs appear to use only early-exit; to the left, 10–20% route primarily with late-exit; and in between, there is a wide range.

For those ISPs that do not always use early-exit, we consider how often the first ISP carries traffic closer to the destination. In Figure 8, we show a cumulative distribution of the fraction of late-exit paths. The graph indicates that most ISP pairs that do not use early-exit route over 75% of paths closer to the destination. For example, Qwest routes almost all prefixes destined to Genuity using a late-exit that is independent of the source. A few ISP pairs route only a few paths close to the destination, suggesting either micro-engineering of a few prefixes or a limited load-balancing policy.

### Summary of Apparent Peering Policies

In Figure 9, we summarize the apparent peering policies of tier-1 ISPs inferred from our traces. Each pair of ISPs is classified once for each direction, as peering policies need not be (and often are not) symmetric.

- **Late-Exit, Often**: These pairs deliver more paths late (closer to the destination) than early.
- **Late-Exit, Sometimes**: These pairs deliver at least 5% of paths late.
- **Source-Dependent Early-Exit**: These pairs have fewer than 5% of paths routed specially.
- **Single Peering Seen**: These pairs have a single peering link in one location, often connecting ISPs on different continents. Policy has no effect for these pairs.
- **Engineered, but Not Late**: These pairs have many paths that are not early, but frequently (at least 1/3 of the time) are not carried closer to the destination.
- **Not Observed in Our Dataset**: Some ISP pairs appear to peer based on RouteViews [20] BGP table archives but were not observed in our dataset.

This analysis provides a comprehensive view of the peering policies and their impact on path inflation, highlighting the importance of cooperation and strategic routing in the internet infrastructure.
