User: I would like to implement ACL with Google Authentication. Need some pointer regarding the possibility of the same.
Use case:

Page X accessible only to myadmin@gmail.com
Page Y accessible for all belong to a group Y. After registration a moderator will add/reject the user to the group Y.
Pages are not accessible if user does not belong to any one of the above two. Unauthorized view is prohibited even though the user is authenticated successfully.

I am planning to use Django for my project, any support provided by Django would be useful.
Thanks in advance.
Assistant: You'll need to do this yourself: Implement the ACL with a datastore model keyed by the user's user_id, and fetch and check it on each request. The Users API doesn't provide anything like this built-in.
