Workloads
Figure 2: Workload memory usage 
One of the traditional questions for any workload analysis 
is:  how  typical  are  the  observed  characteristics  that  are 
presented  above?  Most  observations  about  burstiness  of  the 
CPU usage patterns  were found and discussed in some other 
studies  as  well.  In  particular,  a  study  presented  in  [8]  has 
analyzed the CPU demands of 139 applications over a period 
of  5  weeks.  It  showed  that  more  than  half  of  all  studied 
workloads  are  very  bursty:  their  top  3%  of  CPU  demand 
values  are  2â”€10  times  higher  than  the  remaining  CPU 
demands  in  the  same  workload.  Furthermore,  more  than  half 
of the workloads observe a mean demand less than 30% of the 
peak  demand.  These  observations  show  the  bursty  nature  of 
CPU demands for enterprise applications in different studies. 
Consolidating such bursty workloads onto a smaller number of 
more powerful servers is likely to reduce the capacity needed 
to support the workloads.

V.  COST APPORTIONING STUDY 
We conducted a comprehensive study using the workload 
data  for  the  312  workloads  to  evaluate  the  three  introduced 
cost  models.  In  the  study,  we  consider  the  following  shared 
resource pool configuration: each server consists of 24 x 2.2-
GHz processor cores, 96 GB of memory, and two dual 10 Gb/s 
Ethernet  network  interface  cards  for  network  traffic  and 
virtualization  management  traffic,  respectively.  The  total 
acquisition  cost  for  each  of  these  servers  was  estimated  as 
$23,000, 
licensing  costs.  The  costs  were 
approximately  $10,500  for  CPU  and  $12,500  for  memory. 
Using  a  linear  depreciation  and  assuming  a  lifetime  of  three 
years the cost for three weeks is $442 per server. 
including 
For  workload consolidation,  we employ the consolidation 
engine  described  in  Section  II  that  minimizes  the  number  of 
servers  needed  to  host  the  workloads  while  satisfying  their 
time  varying  resource  demand  requirements.  The  engine  is 
able to offer many solutions that are near-optimal. To evaluate 
the robustness, i.e., repeatability, of costs assignments for our 
approaches,  we  consider  100  consolidation  solutions  for  a 
three  week  costing  interval.  For  the  100  solutions,  the 
consolidation engine reported solutions that assigned the 312 
workloads  to  between  18  and  20  physical  servers  in  the 
resource pool causing the fine sharing of resources. 
Figure  4,  5,  and  6  show  the  costs  for  the  workloads  as 
calculated  using  the  server-usage,  Eq.  (1),  server-burst,  Eq. 
(2), and pool-burst, Eq. (3), approaches, respectively.

burst approaches have very wide ranges for the assigned costs. 
The average differences between min and max costs assigned 
to the workloads are 79% and 72%, respectively. Taking into 
account burstiness decreases the variability in assigned costs, 
but does not  yet  yield robust cost assignments. For example, 
for  Workload  5  of  Figure  5  cost  could  range  from  $107  to 
$334 for the same work. Such big differences would make it 
very hard to plan and charge for customers workloads.  
Figure 6 shows the results for the pool-burst approach. Its 
cost assignment is much less sensitive to workload placement 
decisions  and  thus  has  a  much  tighter  range.  The  average 
difference  between  min  and  max  costs  is  reduced  to  13%, 
which  mostly  reflects 
the  difference 
that  arises  from 
consolidating to between 18 and 20 servers. 
Clearly, 
the  pool-burst  model  provides 
the  most 
predictable  cost  per  hosted  workload.  This  cost  is  much  less 
impacted by the workload placement outcome compared to the 
other  two  considered  cost  models,  and  it  incorporates  the 
resources  usage  characteristics  of  a  given  workload  in  the 
most fair way. 
Our  next  goal  is  to  analyze  the  cost  breakdown  with 
respect  to  its  different  components:  i)  overall  cost  structure 
with  respect  to  direct  resource  usage,  burstiness,  and  unused 
resources,  ii)  CPU  cost  structure  with  respect  to  direct  CPU 
usage, CPU burstiness, and unused CPU portion, and a similar 
analysis  for  the  memory  cost:  iii)  direct  memory  usage,  its 
burstiness, and unused memory resources, and finally, i) CPU 
vs memory cost. 
Figure  7  gives  a  breakdown  of  the  average  sum  of  CPU 
and  memory  costs  over  the  100  consolidation  scenarios  as 
apportioned  by  the  direct  usage  (according  to  ds,w),  bursty 
usage (according to bs,w), and unallocated usage (i.e., as) with 
respect to Eq. (3). The workloads are sorted by total cost. The 
figure shows that for most workloads, the largest components 
in  the  costs  are  due  to  direct  resource  usage  and  usage 
burstiness.  As  defined  by  Eq.  (3),  the  relative  costs  for 
unallocated  resources  are  similar  for  all  workloads.  In  this 
study,  the  unallocated  costs  were  almost  entirely  due  to 
memory costs as it is apparent from the more detailed memory 
cost analysis shown in Figure 9.  
Figure 4: Server-usage model: costs with Eq. (1) 
Figure 5: Server-burst model: costs with Eq. (2) 
Figure 7: CPU + Memory Costs per Workload 
Finally,  Figure  7  shows  that  the  ratio  between  costs  for 
direct  usage  and  for  burstiness  differs  significantly  between 
the  workloads. This is expected as the usage burstiness is an 
individual  characteristic  of  a  workload,  and  may  differ 
significantly across different workloads.
