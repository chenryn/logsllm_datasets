User: If I open a a file as os.open( '/dev/ttyS2', O_RDWR | O_NDELAY ), is there any way that I can check when my 'write()' commands have finished? Or, can I open a file for non-blocking read but blocking write?
Assistant: The O_NDELAY flag always affects both reading and writing. To achieve a blocking write on a non-blocking file you can select (Python module) the file and write when it becomes writable in a loop.
