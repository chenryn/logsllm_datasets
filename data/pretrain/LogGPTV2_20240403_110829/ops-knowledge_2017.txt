User: I am trying to install the Google Cloud SDK which requires Python 2.7. I have both Python 3.5 and 2.7 with Anaconda. I am given a shell script and I would like to tell the shell script to use Python 2.7. How would I do this?
Assistant: An additional thing to add to @cherba's answer:
On Windows I found CLOUDSDK_PYTHON had to be a user level variable not a system level variable. (That's the first box if you're looking at windows system environment variables.)
