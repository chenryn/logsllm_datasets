User: How to perform system security hardening? Please list the strategies and tools for system security hardening.
Assistant: System security reinforcement strategy: 1. Use a strong password: use a complex password composed of a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. 2. System slimming: delete unnecessary services, processes, etc., to reduce the attack surface of system vulnerabilities. 3. Forbid logging in with an administrator account: log in with an ordinary user account to reduce the ability of potential attackers to obtain the highest authority to control the system. 4. Strengthen access control: restrict access to the system, network, and applications, and only allow authorized users to access. 5. Regularly upgrade system patches: update system patches in time to fix known vulnerabilities. 6. Install anti-virus software: Anti-virus software should regularly update the virus database to prevent computer viruses, Trojan horses and other malicious software. 7. Network firewall: restrict external access and prevent attackers from exploiting network vulnerabilities to attack internal systems. 8. Monitoring log: report abnormal events in time to achieve safety warning. System security hardening tools: 1. Bastion machine: monitoring authority operation, session recording, auditing, etc., providing enterprises with safe and controllable remote access solutions. 2. Security audit system: With security audit as the core, a series of functions such as centralized collection, analysis, and archiving of operation logs, system logs, and database logs are used to enhance system security. 3. Vulnerability scanning tool: detect and analyze various vulnerabilities in the system by scanning the status, version and information of the vulnerability points in the network. 4. Website protection system: Various security measures such as attack protection, data encryption, and information backup are carried out on the website. 5. Firewall: A network device that detects and filters data transmitted through the network to protect system security.
