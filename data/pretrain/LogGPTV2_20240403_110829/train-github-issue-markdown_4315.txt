### Expected Behavior
Use either `setSize` or `setBounds` to resize a window to the dimensions of
the background image (explicit dimensions passed).
### Actual Behavior
In Linux, this behavior works as expected. In Windows and macOS, it does not
work as expected. When running `getBounds`, it matches what is set with
`setBounds`, however, the background image (which has identical dimensions) is
cut off.
### To Reproduce
Occurs in my repo here. The code is specifically:
    const win = require("electron").remote.BrowserWindow.getFocusedWindow();
    win.setMinimumSize(skinJson.width, skinJson.height)
    win.setBounds({width: skinJson.width, height: skinJson.height})
Where `skinJson.width` and `skinJson.height` are the dimensions of the
background image.
### Screenshots
Here is an example of it working correctly in Linux.
Here is an example of not working correctly in Windows and an example in
macOS.
### Additional Information
This is closest to #16711, but it was closed for being a duplicate of #15560,
but that's not the case. With regards to the latter, the workaround of
`setMinimumSize` works to resize smaller. However, `setSize` and `setBounds`
(tested both) work differently in Windows and macOS than it does in Linux.
Having `resizeable` be true or false has no impact on it's functionality
(however I ended up setting it to true just to allow users to fit the
background image, but that's not a desirable outcome).
