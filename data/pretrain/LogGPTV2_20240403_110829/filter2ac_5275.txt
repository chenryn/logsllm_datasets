**ATT&CK ID:** M1036  
**Technique Name:** Account Use Policies

Implement account lockout policies to prevent passwords from being guessed after a certain number of failed login attempts. However, overly strict policies can lead to denial of service conditions, as all accounts involved in a brute force attack may become locked out, rendering the environment unusable. To mitigate this risk, consider using conditional access policies to block logins from non-compliant devices or from IP addresses outside the defined organizational range.
