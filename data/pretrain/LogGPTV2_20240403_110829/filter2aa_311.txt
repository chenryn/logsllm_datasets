Is MITM an Important Technique?
• Sometimes…
• Works when other techniques fail
• Often overlooked…
• Active Directory
• Relatively old protocols
• Usually don’t use TLS
NTLM Basics
Authentication is not bound to the target server!

NTLM Relay over DCE/RPC
• First suggested by Sylvain Heiniger (@sploutchy)
• Found (at least) one interface (TSCH) with no server signing
• Used NTLM Relay to create a new scheduled task
DCE/RPC Relay Mitigation is Broken

Printer Spooler LPE (CVE-2020-1048)
• Discovered by Peleg Hadar (@peleghd) and Tomer Bar
• For printing, you need a driver, and a port  
• Any user can install a printer driver (from a pre-existing list)
• “Generic/ Text” can write anything...
• The port can be a file instead ⇒ We can write arbitrary files
• It is a privileged process, and the access checks are done on the client 
side ⇒ We have an LPE
CVE-2021-1678
• Was found using our RPC scanning tool 
• Targeting MS-PAR (IRemoteWinSpool) Interface
• Interface has only required  RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_CONNECT
• Support remote printer operations
• Works the same as CVE-2020-1048 (just remotely)
• RpcAsyncInstallPrinterDriverFromPackage (Opnum 62) — Installing “Generic/Text” printer 
driver
• RpcAsyncOpenPrinter (Opnum 0)
• RpcAsyncXcvData (Opnum 33) — Add port
• RpcAsyncAddPrinter (Opnum 1) — Add a printer with the mentioned driver
• RpcAsyncStartDocPrinter(Opnum 10) — Start a new document
• RpcAsyncWritePrinter (Opnum 12) — Write to new document

MS15-011
• Initially discovered by Luke Jennings (@jukelennings)
• Attacking GPO retrieval using MITM
• Many attack scenarios
• Both RCE and privilege escalation
• Some scenarios are still exploitable

MS Fixes for MS15-011
• GPO retreival can no longer operate with NTLM
• Registry Key
• Hardened UNC Paths
• Configuration to block NTLM usage in SMB
• Defaults
• \\*\SYSVOL
• \\*\NETLOGON
Azure AD Connect
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-password-hash-synchronization
Azure AD Connect MITM Attack
• MITM Between Azure AD Connect and DC
• Attack Steps:
• Establish a full MITM , make Kerberos fail while allowing LDAP to pass to the 
DC
• Wait for domain replication in NTLM
• Inject new change MD4 password for an account of your choice
• Log in to Azure AD with injected password
DEMO
Kerberos Relay
• Same as NTLM Relay (actually much easier)
• Just to the original target server

Kerberos Relay over TLS
• Relay protection in TLS channels
• Extended Protection for Authentication
• Important examples of such protection
• LDAPS (called Channel Bindings)
• AD FS
• IIS
• Can this be bypassed?
• NTLM (check out our DEFCON 2019 talk J)
• Kerberos
• AP-Req contained signed certificate thumbprint inside checksum field
• What happens when Kerberos client has no checksum field?
KDC Spoofing
• KDC Spoofing
• Old Technique
• Using MITM for authentication bypass
• Typically exists in VPNs, FWs

• Create a TGS ticket to self using TGT

Kerberos Injection
• So, we cannot manipulate TGT and TGS, what now?
DC Selection Process
(1) Lookup DCs in domain.com
Client 
Machine
(4) Unauthenticated LDAP “Host Ping” (Get AD site)
(5) LDAP – Get domain capabilities 
(6) Get DCs in current site
(7) Establish NETLOGON Session
Possibly 
Selecting 
another DC
(8) Get Domain Info
DNS

(3) Resolve dc1.domain.com
(2) List of DC FQDNs
Picks a DC
Kerberos Injection
• We can intervene in the DC selection process:
• Client choose a DC using combination of DNS and LDAP queries
• Our MITM relays AS-REQ and TGS-REQ (to self) to a real DC
• MITM is able to serve subsequent DCE/RPC and LDAP requests
• (As long as NETLOGON secure channel is not required)

Kerberos Injection – Attack Scenario
• A service that:
• Uses Kerberos (the usual case…)
• Ingests data from DC without certificate/netlogon validation (the usual case…)
• Does not have a fixed DC configured (the usual case…)
• MITM between the server and the DNS
• The attack:
• Use MITM to redirect to the Rogue DC
• Client requests ticket to rogue server (SPN needs to be registered!)
• Modify responses to the ingested data
Kerberos Injection – How to Mitigate?
• Authenticate DC
• Establish a NETLOGON channel
• Use LDAPS with certificate validation
• Use Kerberos Armoring (we have not tested this…)
• Windows GPO is still safe…

Responsible Disclosure
• IRemoteWinSpool NTLM Relay
•
Microsoft fixed issue under CVE-2021-1678
•
Regarding other vulnerable interfaces: “Regarding other DCE/RPC interfaces for potential exploitation, If youl find other 
exploitable DCE/RPC interfaces, please submit these separately. Doing so will allow us to investigate each one individually.”
• Azure AD
•
MS Acknowledged the issue and replied: “Thank you for reaching out. MitM requirement requires another vulnerability to 
be exploited to achieve a successful MitM, or a compromised connection, or some level of privileges. We also strongly 
recommend to treat AD Connect server as a domain controller, following hardened security practices”
• Channel Bindings
•
MS Acknowledged the issue and replied: : “Microsoft has decided that it will not be fixing this vulnerability in the current 
version and we are closing this case.”
• Kerberos Injection
•
A few vendors are working on fixing their Kerberos clients – expect updates soon
Closing Remarks
• MITM is not a security boundary (at least for Microsoft)
• More Technically:
• Securing Protocols from MITM is hard
• Kerberos is not validating DC identity properly
• GSS-API does not guarentee protection from MITM
Tips for Defenders
• Network Hardening 
• Enable server/client signing
• Regularily patch software
• Treat critical servers (e.g., AAD Connect) the same as DC
• Kerberos Injection
• Monitor suspiciously registered SPNs
• Microsoft Recommendation: Avoid being MITM’d… :P
