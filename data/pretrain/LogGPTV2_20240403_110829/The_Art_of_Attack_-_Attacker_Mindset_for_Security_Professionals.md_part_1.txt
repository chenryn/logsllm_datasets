speeches on the mindset and science behind the art of social engi-
neering. She teaches various courses on social engineering and the
attacker mindset. This book, The Art of Attack: Attacker Mindset for
Security Professionals, is the first book of its kind to be published. It
looks at the cognitive skills and requirements of the mindset, how

Introduction
There is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so.
—­William­Shakespeare
I
was recently told by someone I consider to be a subject mat-
ter expert that introductions in books, although seldom read by
typical readers, are meant to respect the reader. Introductions
are not intended to insinuate to readers that they will only under-
stand the book’s subject matter once they’ve read it cover to cover.
Instead, the introduction should tell its audience how the core
message of the book will be broken down. I think this is true, so
this introduction acts only as a way to summarize what’s to come,
not to aggrandize it.
The core subject of this book is the attacker mindset, the gather-
ing, processing, and applying of information for an objective. That’s
the key takeaway of this book. If you stop reading now, you will have
received its central message. However, what I’m hoping will keep
you reading, rather than repurposing the book as a doorstop, is that
xv
xvi InTroduc TIon
the whole book is about how to do this as an attacker— how to pro-
cess and apply information for the benefit of the mission.
The­Art­of­Attack looks at all aspects of the attacker mindset
(AMs), focusing on the cornerstone pieces. In breaking these pieces
down to their fundamental components, the book empowers you to
build them back up into something recognizable as your own brand
of attacker mindset. I will describe the principles of this mindset
and how to interweave them with the process most attacks fol-
low, namely: reconnaissance, initial approach, privilege escalation,
redundant access, and escape. Through this attacker lens, this book
explores tools you can implement as attackers and the psychologi-
cal principles, too. I will also call out all the times you should take
snacks with you on a job, which doesn’t seem important now, but
wait until you’ve been trapped in a bathroom stall for six hours.
To help you remember the material packed into this book, I’ll
provide stories (both successes and fails), which should make trans-
ferring AMs from theory into practice much easier. As a practitioner
of social engineering, I will mainly concentrate on examples of the
attacker mindset in my stories from the field. However, as a trained
pen tester there will also be crossover.
The tagline I’ve used to put attacker mindset into shorthand
over the years is: there­really­is­nothing­good­or­bad,­but­your­
attacker­mindset­makes­it­so—this line is effectively how this book
came into being: countless hours of trying to teach people the art
of the attacker mindset allowed a reduction of it to that statement.
The attacker mindset allows us to hack information, which may on
the surface be neutral to the untrained pedestrian, but to you or
I as attackers, could prove lethal when leveraged correctly. There’s
no information that you will come across that’s simply good or
bad; information is processed through the lens of the attack and its
objective.
I wrote this book solely to teach this mentality, but each of you
will build your own version of it that reflects your strengths and
weaknesses. This book should teach you how to think, not what to
