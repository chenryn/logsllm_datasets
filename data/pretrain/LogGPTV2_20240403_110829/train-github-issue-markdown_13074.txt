currently, to build libtorch and its dependent libs, you invoke
build_pytorch_libs.{sh,bat}. For the most part, these just call out to cmake
several times. They also do a little bit of fiddling with variables, and copy
around some output files to particular locations. All of this can and should
just be done with cmake, with the benefits of
  * one less middleman script to debug through
  * easier for newcomers ("just run cmake")
  * removes duplication and code drift between windows and unix build scripts (there are already a number of divergences)
