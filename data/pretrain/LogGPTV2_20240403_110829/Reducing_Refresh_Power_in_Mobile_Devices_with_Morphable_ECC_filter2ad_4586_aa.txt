## Abstract
Energy consumption is a critical factor in the usability of mobile computing devices such as smartphones. A significant portion of this energy is consumed by refresh operations for main memory, particularly during idle periods when the processor is switched off but the memory continues to be refreshed to prevent data loss. Given that mobile devices are often idle, reducing refresh power in idle mode is essential to maximize battery life. Strong multi-bit error correction codes (ECC) can reduce the frequency of refresh operations, but they introduce high latency, leading to performance degradation.

To address this, we propose Morphable ECC (MECC), which uses 6-bit ECC (ECC-6) during idle periods with a 1-second refresh interval, and switches to weaker ECC (single-bit error correction) during active periods, thereby avoiding the high latency of ECC-6 except for the first access. MECC reduces refresh operations during idle mode by 16x and memory power in idle mode by 2x, while maintaining performance within 2% of a system without ECC.

## 1. Introduction
In recent years, there has been a paradigm shift towards handheld devices like smartphones and tablets as primary computing platforms. Energy consumption is a key consideration in the development of these devices, as it determines the duration for which they remain usable on battery power. Usage patterns for such devices involve short bursts of activity over extended periods, with idle times accounting for 90-95% of the total usage time. Therefore, reducing energy consumption during idle periods is crucial, while also ensuring instant response and minimal system wake-up time.

Figure 1 illustrates the typical usage pattern, showing that during active mode, memory consumes 9x more power than in idle mode. The contribution of refresh power to overall energy consumption is small during active mode but significant during idle periods.

One of the main sources of energy consumption during idle periods is the main memory system, typically made of Dynamic Random-Access Memory (DRAM). DRAM requires periodic refresh operations to retain data, even when the device is idle. While the processor can be switched off quickly, the memory continues to consume power for refresh operations. One potential solution is to store memory contents in non-volatile storage, but this is not feasible due to the large memory capacity and limited storage bandwidth in current smartphones.

The refresh power of memory can be reduced by using strong multi-bit ECC, which allows for slower refresh operations. However, this introduces high latency, degrading system performance. Our analysis shows that using ECC-6 can reduce the refresh interval from 64ms to 1 second, but it incurs a latency overhead that degrades performance by up to 21%, and on average by 10%.

To achieve both low refresh power in idle periods and high performance in active periods, we propose Morphable ECC (MECC). MECC uses ECC-6 during idle periods and switches to weaker ECC during active periods, thus balancing power savings and performance.

## 2. Background and Motivation
Users expect mobile devices to be energy-proportional, consuming power only when in use. However, DRAM, a major component of mobile devices, requires periodic refresh operations to maintain data integrity, even during idle periods. This makes mobile devices non-energy-proportional. As the memory capacity of smartphones increases, the power consumption due to memory refresh is also increasing.

### 2.1 DRAM Refresh Modes
There are several modes of refresh in DRAM systems, each designed for different system requirements:

1. **Auto Refresh (AR):** The typical mode where the memory controller sends a refresh pulse every 64ms or 7.8Î¼s.
2. **Self Refresh (SR):** Used during idle periods when the processor and memory controller are turned off, and the DRAM device generates the refresh pulse.
3. **Partial Array Self Refresh (PASR):** Only a portion of memory is refreshed, reducing the useful capacity.
4. **Deep Power Down (DPD):** An ultra-low power mode where DRAM is not refreshed, and the contents are lost.

### 2.2 Increasing DRAM Refresh Period
The retention time of DRAM cells is typically 64ms, determined by the weakest cell in the array. On average, DRAM cells have a retention time in the range of tens of seconds, but variability in retention time causes a few weak bits to determine the overall retention time. Using strong ECC can extend the refresh interval, but it introduces high latency.

Figure 2 shows the bit failure probability for DRAM cells as the retention time is changed.

## 3. Proposed Solution: Morphable ECC (MECC)
MECC is based on two key observations: idle periods in mobile devices are long, and the contribution of refresh power to overall memory power is significant during idle mode. MECC appends each memory line with ECC-mode bits, indicating whether the line uses strong-ECC or weak-ECC. During idle periods, MECC ensures the entire memory uses ECC-6 and reduces the refresh rate to 1 second. During active periods, MECC converts lines to weak-ECC on demand, avoiding the high latency of ECC-6 except for the first access.

MECC also includes:
- **Memory Downgrade Tracking (MDT):** Tracks memory regions that have been downgraded from ECC-6 to avoid wasteful conversions.
- **Selective Memory Downgrade (SMD):** Avoids frequent transitions between ECC-6 and weak-ECC for short, periodic system activities.

Our evaluations show that MECC reduces refresh operations in idle mode by 16x and memory power by 2x, while maintaining performance within 2% of a system without ECC.
