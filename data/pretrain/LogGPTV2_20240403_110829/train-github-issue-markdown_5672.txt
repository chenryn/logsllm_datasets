Hello guys, so, in the past months I've been using Electron and I have to say
that it's a really good framework. But I've found the great issue; app size.
Electron apps are way TOO BIG, more than they shouldn't. I know that this is
because of the Chromium engine who needs to be packaged with Electron.
My question would be...  
**Why not package Chromium as a shared resource (per system or per user)**  
This could work like Node Modules do; every Electron version has a chromium
engine. So if for example, Discord has electron 7 and vscode does too we are
reducing app size.
This could be done as an optional electron-builder/packager/forge option.
