### 5.1.4 Malware/Phishing Rates by Browser

Google Chrome stable users click through phishing warnings more frequently than Mozilla Firefox stable users. This trend persists even when accounting for differences in how the browsers handle iframes (Section 4.5). For Mozilla Firefox’s beta channel, the click-through rates are 9.6% for malware warnings and 10.8% for phishing warnings, even when iframes are excluded.

Possible explanations for this difference include:
- **Warning Design**: Mozilla Firefox’s warnings may be more intimidating or convincing.
- **Demographic Differences**: The two browsers may have different user demographics with varying levels of risk tolerance. Factors such as technical education, gender, socioeconomic status, and other unmeasured variables could influence these rates. 

Interestingly, the differences between the browsers do not remain consistent across operating systems or release channels. For example, the gap narrows or reverses for Linux users and nightly release users.

### 5.2 SSL Warnings

The click-through rates for SSL warnings were 33.0% for Mozilla Firefox (beta channel) and 70.2% for Google Chrome (stable channel).

#### 5.2.1 SSL Rates by Demographic

In Section 5.1, we observed that malware and phishing click-through rates varied across operating systems and release channels. For SSL, the differences are less pronounced but still significant.

- **Nightly Users**: Nightly users click through SSL warnings at a higher rate for both Firefox and Chrome (χ² tests: p < 0.0001).
- **Operating Systems**:
  - **Firefox**: Linux users are much more likely to click through SSL warnings than Windows and Mac users combined (χ² test: p < 0.0001), though the sample size for Firefox on Linux is small (58 users).
  - **Chrome**: Windows users are slightly more likely to click through SSL warnings than Linux and Mac users combined (χ² test: p < 0.0001).

#### 5.2.2 SSL Rates by Browser

We found a large difference in SSL warning click-through rates between Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome: Google Chrome users are 2.1 times more likely to click through an SSL warning than Mozilla Firefox users. We explore five possible causes:

1. **Number of Clicks**:
   - **Google Chrome**: One button to dismiss an SSL warning.
   - **Mozilla Firefox**: Three buttons to dismiss an SSL warning.
   - However, the number of clicks does not appear to significantly affect the click-through rates for malware and phishing warnings. Additionally, 84% of Firefox users who perform the first two clicks also perform the third, indicating that the extra click is not a major deterrent.

2. **Warning Appearance**:
   - **Firefox**: Includes an image of a policeman and uses the word "untrusted" in the title.
   - **Chrome**: Different design, but the difference in appearance is unlikely to be the sole factor, given the smaller gap in malware and phishing warnings.

3. **Certificate Pinning**:
   - **Google Chrome**: Ships with a list of "pinned" certificates and preloaded HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) sites, making some SSL warnings non-bypassable.
   - **Mozilla Firefox**: Does not come with many preloaded "pinned" certificates or HSTS sites. As a result, 20% of all Google Chrome SSL warning impressions are non-bypassable, compared to 1% for Mozilla Firefox.
   - This could account for up to 15 points of the 37-point gap, assuming Google Chrome users would never click through SSL errors on critical websites if given the chance.

4. **Remembering Exceptions**:
   - **Firefox**: Users can permanently store exceptions, meaning they see SSL warnings only for websites without saved exceptions. This could lead to lower click-through rates despite similar interaction rates with problematic websites.
   - **Chrome**: No such feature, leading to higher exposure to SSL warnings and potentially higher click-through rates due to warning fatigue.

5. **Demographics**:
   - Different user demographics with varying risk tolerances may contribute, but this is likely a minor factor given the smaller gap in malware and phishing warnings.

#### 5.2.3 SSL Rates by Certificate Error Type

To understand the factors driving click-through rates, we analyzed the impact of specific certificate error types.

- **Google Chrome**:
  - Shows a short explanation of the error and provides a detailed explanation via a "Help me understand" link.
  - Click-through rates vary significantly based on error type, with a 24.4-point difference between untrusted issuer errors and expired certificate errors.
  - Possible explanations include:
    - Untrusted issuer errors may occur on unimportant sites, leading to higher click-through rates.
    - Expired certificates, which often surprise users, may lead to lower click-through rates.

- **Mozilla Firefox**:
  - Does not inform the user about the specific SSL error by default; the secondary "Add Exception" dialog lists all errors.
  - The exception confirmation rate is relatively consistent across error types, suggesting that users do not differentiate between error categories.

- **Error Prevalence**:
  - Our data contradicts previous studies, showing that untrusted issuer errors are less frequent in Google Chrome than in Mozilla Firefox.
  - The high frequency of untrusted issuer errors highlights the potential benefits of "network view" SSL certificate verification systems like Perspectives and Convergence, which do not require trusted authorities.

### Summary

The click-through rates for security warnings differ significantly between browsers, operating systems, and user demographics. While some factors, such as warning design and certificate pinning, play a role, further research is needed to fully understand the underlying reasons and to develop more effective security warnings.
