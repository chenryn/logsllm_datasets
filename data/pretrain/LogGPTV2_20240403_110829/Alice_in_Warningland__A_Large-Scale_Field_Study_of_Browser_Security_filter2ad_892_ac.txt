combined for the Firefox malware warning, Firefox phish-
ing warning, and Chrome phishing warning (χ2 tests:
p(1) < 0.0001). While the low prevalence of malware
for Linux could explain the higher clickthrough rates for
the Firefox malware warning, use of Linux does not pro-
vide any additional protection against phishing attacks.
The Chrome malware warning does not follow the same
pattern: Windows users have a signiﬁcantly higher click-
through rate (χ2 tests: p(1) < 0.0001).
We also see differences between software release
channels (Table 2). Nightly users click through Google
Chrome malware and Firefox phishing warnings at much
higher rates than stable users, although they click through
Firefox malware and Google Chrome phishing warnings
at approximately the same rates.
In several cases, Linux users and early adopters click
through malware and phishing warnings at higher rates.
One possible explanation is that a greater degree of tech-
nical skill – as indicated by use of Linux or early-adopter
versions of browsers – corresponds to reduced risk aver-
sion and an increased willingness to click through warn-
ings. This does not hold true for all categories and warn-
ings (e.g., nightly and stable users click through the Fire-
fox malware warning at the same rate), suggesting the
need for further study.
5.1.4 Malware/Phishing Rates by Browser
Google Chrome stable users click through phishing warn-
ings more often than Mozilla Firefox stable users. This
holds true even when we account for differences in how
the browsers treat iframes (Section 4.5). Mozilla Fire-
fox’s beta channel users still click through warnings at a
lower rate when we exclude iframes: 9.6% for malware
warnings, and 10.8% for phishing warnings.
One possibility is that Mozilla Firefox’s warnings are
more frightening or more convincing. Another possi-
3Google Chrome will display both warnings. To preserve inde-
pendence, our measurement does not include any warnings with both
phishing and malware error messages. Dual messages are infrequent.

bility is that the browsers have different demographics
with different levels of risk tolerance, which is reﬂected
in their clickthrough rates. There might be differences
in technical education, gender, socioeconomic status, or
other factors that we cannot account for in this study. In
support of this theory, we ﬁnd that differences between
the browsers do not hold steady across operating systems
or channels. The gap between the browsers narrows or
reverses for some categories of users, such as Linux users
and nightly release users.
5.2 SSL Warnings
The clickthrough rates for SSL warnings were 33.0% and
70.2% for Mozilla Firefox (beta channel) and Google
Chrome (stable channel), respectively.
5.2.1 SSL Rates by Demographic
In Section 5.1, we observed that malware and phishing
clickthrough rates differed across operating systems and
channels. For SSL, the differences are less pronounced.
As with the malware and phishing warnings, nightly
users click through SSL warnings at a higher rate for both
Firefox and Chrome (χ2 tests: p <0. 0001).
The effect of users’ operating systems on SSL click-
through rates differs for the two browsers. In Firefox,
Linux users are much more likely to click through SSL
warnings than Windows and Mac users combined (χ2 test:
p < 0.0001), although it is worth noting that the Firefox
Linux sample size is quite small (58). In Chrome, Win-
dows users are very slightly more likely to click through
SSL warnings than Linux and Mac users combined (χ2
test: p <0. 0001).
5.2.2 SSL Rates by Browser
We ﬁnd a large difference between the Mozilla Firefox
and Google Chrome clickthrough rates: Google Chrome
users are 2.1 times more likely to click through an SSL
warning than Mozilla Firefox users. We explore ﬁve
possible causes.
Number of Clicks. Google Chrome users click one but-
ton to dismiss an SSL warning, but Mozilla Firefox users
need to click three buttons. It is possible that the addi-
tional clicks deter people from clicking through. However,
we do not believe this is the cause of the rate gap.
First, the number of clicks does not appear to affect
the clickthrough rates for malware and phishing warn-
ings. Mozilla Firefox’s malware and phishing warnings
require one click to proceed, whereas Google Chrome’s
malware and phishing warnings require two. The Google
Chrome malware and phishing warnings with two clicks
do not have lower clickthrough rates than the Mozilla
Firefox warnings with one click. Second, as we discuss
in Section 5.2.3, 84% of users who perform the ﬁrst two

clicks in Mozilla Firefox also perform the third. This
indicates that the extra click is not a determining deci-
sion point. Unfortunately, we do not have data on the
difference between the ﬁrst and second clicks.
Warning Appearance. The two warnings differ in sev-
eral ways. Mozilla Firefox’s warning includes an image
of a policeman and uses the word “untrusted” in the title.
These differences likely contribute to the rate gap. How-
ever, we do not think warning appearance is the sole or
primary factor; the browsers’ malware and phishing warn-
ings also differ, but there is only about a 10% difference
between browsers for these warnings.
Certiﬁcate Pinning. Google Chrome ships with a list
of “pinned” certiﬁcates and preloaded HTTP Strict Trans-
port Security (HSTS) sites. Users cannot click through
SSL warnings on sites protected by these features. Certiﬁ-
cate pinning and HSTS cover some websites with impor-
tant private data such as Google, PayPal, and Twitter [8].
In contrast, Mozilla Firefox does not come with many
preloaded “pinned” certiﬁcates or any pre-speciﬁed HSTS
sites. As a result, Chrome shows more non-bypassable
warnings: our ﬁeld study found that 20% of all Google
Chrome SSL warning impressions are non-bypassable, as
compared to 1% for Mozilla Firefox.
Based on this, we know that Mozilla Firefox users see
more warnings for several critical websites. If we assume
that users are less likely to click through SSL warnings
on these critical websites, then it follows that Mozilla
Firefox’s clickthrough rate will be lower. This potential
bias could account for up to 15 points of the 37-point gap
between the two clickthrough rates, if we were to assume
that Google Chrome users would never click through SSL
errors on critical websites if given the chance.

22nd USENIX Security Symposium  265
Remembering Exceptions. Due to the “permanently
store this exception” feature in Mozilla Firefox, Mozilla
Firefox users see SSL warnings only for websites without
saved exceptions. This means that Mozilla Firefox users
might ultimately interact with websites with SSL errors
at the same rate as Google Chrome users despite having
lower clickthrough rates. For example, imagine a user
that encounters two websites with erroneous SSL conﬁg-
uration: she leaves the ﬁrst after seeing a warning, but
visits the second website nine times despite the warning.
This user would have a 50% clickthrough rate in Mozilla
Firefox but a 90% clickthrough rate in Google Chrome,
despite visiting the second website at the same rate.
We did not measure how often people revisit websites
with SSL errors. However, we suspect that people do
repeatedly visit sites with warnings (e.g., a favorite site
with a self-signed certiﬁcate). If future work were to
conﬁrm this, there could be two implications. First, if
users are repeatedly visiting the same websites with errors,
the errors are likely false positives; this would mean that
the lack of an exception-storing mechanism noticably
raises the false positive rate in Google Chrome. Second,
warning fatigue could be a factor. If Google Chrome users
are exposed to more SSL warnings because they cannot
save exceptions, they might pay less attention to each
warning that they encounter.
Demographics. It’s possible that the browsers have dif-
ferent demographics with different levels of risk toler-
ance. However, this factor likely only accounts for a
few percentage points because the same demographic ef-
fect applies to malware and phishing warnings, and the
difference between browsers for malware and phishing
warnings is much smaller.
5.2.3 SSL Rates by Certiﬁcate Error Type
To gain insight into the factors that drive clickthrough
rates, we study whether the particular certiﬁcate error
affects user behavior.
Google Chrome. Google Chrome’s SSL warning in-
cludes a short explanation of the particular error, and
clicking on “Help me understand” will open a more-
detailed explanation. In case a certiﬁcate has multiple
errors, Google Chrome only shows the ﬁrst error out of
untrusted issuer error, name mismatch error, and certiﬁ-
cate expiration error, respectively.
Table 5 presents the clickthrough rates by error types
for Google Chrome. If Google Chrome users are paying
attention to and understanding the warnings, one would
expect different clickthrough rates based on the warning
types. We ﬁnd a 24.4-point difference between the click-
through rates for untrusted issuer errors and expired certiﬁ-
cate errors. One explanation could be that untrusted issuer

Table 5: Prevalence and clickthrough rates of error types for the
Google Chrome SSL warning. Google Chrome only displays
the most critical warning; we list the error types in order, with
untrusted issuer errors as the most critical. Data is for the stable
channel across all operating systems.
errors appear on unimportant sites, leading to higher click-
through rates without user attention or comprehension;
however, the Mozilla Firefox data suggests otherwise.
An alternative explanation could be that expired certiﬁ-
cates, which often occur for websites with previously
valid certiﬁcates [1], surprise the user. In contrast, un-
trusted certiﬁcate errors always occur for a website and
conform with expectations.
Mozilla Firefox. Mozilla Firefox’s SSL warning does not
inform the user about the particular SSL error by default.4
Instead, the secondary “Add Exception” dialog presents
all errors in the SSL certiﬁcate. The user must conﬁrm
this dialog to proceed.
Table 6 presents the rates at which users conﬁrm the
“Add Exception” dialog in Mozilla Firefox. The error
types do not greatly inﬂuence the exception conﬁrmation
rate. This indicates that the “Add Exception” dialog does
not do an adequate job of explaining particular error cate-
gories and their meaning to the users. Thus, users ignore
the categories and click through errors at the same rate.
This ﬁnding also suggests that the differences in click-
through rates across error types in Google Chrome cannot
be attributed to untrusted issuer errors corresponding to
unimportant websites; if that were the case, we would
expect to see the same phenomenon in Firefox.
Error Prevalence.
The frequency of error types
encountered by users in our ﬁeld study also indicates the
base rate of SSL errors on the web. Our Google Chrome
data contradicts a previous network telemetry study,
which suggested that untrusted issuer errors correspond
to 80% of certiﬁcate errors seen on the wire [18]. Also,
Google Chrome users see fewer untrusted issuer errors
than Mozilla Firefox users; this may be because Mozilla
Firefox users are more likely to click on the “Add
Exception” dialog for untrusted issuer errors. Recall that
we collect the Mozilla Firefox error type statistics only
after a user clicks on the “Add Exception” button.
4This information is available under the “Technical details” link, but
our measurements indicate that it is rarely opened (Section 5.2.4).

Table 6: Prevalence and conﬁrmation rates of error types for
the Mozilla Firefox “Add Exception” dialog. The conﬁrmation
rate measures the percentage of users who click on “Conﬁrm
Security Exception” (Figure 5). The Mozilla Firefox dialog lists
all the errors that occur for a certiﬁcate. Data is for the release
channel across all operating systems; we did not need to limit
it to the beta channel because frame level issues do not affect
clickthrough rates inside the “Add Exception” dialog.
The high frequency of untrusted issuer errors high-
lights the usability beneﬁts of “network view” SSL cer-
tiﬁcate veriﬁcation systems like Perspectives and Conver-
gence [10,33], which do not need certiﬁcates from trusted
authorities. All of the untrusted certiﬁcate warnings—
between 38% and 56% of the total—would disappear.
