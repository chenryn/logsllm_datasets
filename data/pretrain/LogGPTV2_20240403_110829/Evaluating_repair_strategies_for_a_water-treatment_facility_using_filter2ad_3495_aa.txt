## Abstract

The performance and dependability of critical infrastructures, such as water-treatment facilities, are essential. In this paper, we use various measures to analyze the performance and dependability of a water-treatment facility using the Arcade framework. A simplified model of the facility is derived in XML format and then automatically mapped to the PRISM model checker. Using the stochastic model checking capabilities of PRISM, we compare different repair strategies with respect to their costs and their impact on system reliability, availability, and survivability. We conclude that non-preemptive scheduling of repair crews is the best choice in terms of dependability and cost.

## 1. Introduction

Over the past decade, there has been an increased awareness among governments worldwide about the vulnerability and dependence of critical infrastructures. For example, the Dutch government has recently identified 13 critical infrastructures, including the electricity grid and power generation, and water treatment. This paper focuses on the last four phases of a water treatment facility, where the key issue is the timely delivery of high-quality water. A recent survey in the Netherlands found that water-treatment facilities, including their embedded Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, are highly vulnerable to physical failures and cyber attacks. Therefore, the study of the impact of such failures or attacks is of vital importance.

To facilitate the analysis of performance and dependability, we propose a new performance and dependability analysis approach using the Arcade framework. This framework pairs rigor with applicability and openness, making it suitable for integration with existing design tools. In contrast to earlier tools, Arcade provides a refined and more detailed analysis. Specifically, we introduce a new measure called quantitative survivability, which is an improvement over the definition by Cloth et al. [7]. Survivability is defined as the probability of timely recovery after the occurrence of predefined disasters.

## 2. The Modeling and Analysis Framework

### 2.1 Components of the Arcade Framework

The Arcade framework distinguishes between three types of components:
1. **Basic Components**: These describe the primary behavior and failure modes of the system.
2. **Repair Units**: These activate when the system is down and manage the repair process.
3. **Spare Management Units**: These manage spare components that can be used when the primary components fail.

### 2.2 Tool Chain via PRISM

For this case study, we add costs to the model to express, for example, the price of repair and focus on performance and dependability measures. The original Arcade tool chain, which uses the CADP tool, does not provide the necessary stochastic model checking capabilities. Therefore, we choose to use PRISM, which supports Continuous Stochastic Logic (CSL) and Continuous Stochastic Reward Logic (CSRL). Figure 1 presents the tool chain via PRISM.

## 3. Measures of Interest

### 3.1 Reliability

Reliability is defined as the continuity of correct service. The set of operational states \( S_{\text{operational}} \) is defined as the set of states where the fault tree evaluates to false. The set of down states \( S_{\text{down}} \) is defined as the set of states where the fault tree evaluates to true. Reliability within a certain mission time \( t \) is then expressed as:

\[ P_{\text{Reliability}} = \mathbb{P}[\text{true} \, U \leq t \, S_{\text{down}}] \]

### 3.2 Availability

Availability is defined as the long-run probability that the system is operational. It is expressed as:

\[ P_{\text{Availability}} = \lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{1}{t} \int_0^t \mathbb{P}[S_{\text{operational}}] \, dt \]

### 3.3 Survivability

Survivability is defined as the ability of the system to recover to a required level of service in a timely manner after the occurrence of a disaster. It is expressed as:

\[ P_{\text{Survivability}} = \mathbb{P}[\text{true} \, U \leq t \, S_{\text{service}}] \]

where \( S_{\text{service}} \) is the set of states where the required service level is met.

## 4. Case Study

In this section, we present the results of our analysis of a simplified model of a Dutch water treatment facility. We compare different repair strategies, including dedicated, first-come-first-serve, and fastest-repair-first, with respect to their costs and their effect on system reliability, availability, and survivability. Our analysis shows that non-preemptive scheduling of repair crews is the best choice in terms of dependability and cost.

## 5. Conclusion

This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the Arcade framework in analyzing the performance and dependability of a water-treatment facility. By using the PRISM model checker, we were able to compare different repair strategies and conclude that non-preemptive scheduling of repair crews is the most effective. Future work will involve further refinement of the model and the inclusion of additional real-world data to enhance the accuracy of the analysis.
