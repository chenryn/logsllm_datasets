and Y-Down. To well understand the result, we ﬁrst ana-
lyze how the stepper motor operates and how it controls the
nozzle movement.
The stepper motor eﬀectively has multiple “toothed” elec-
tromagnets arranged around a central gear-shaped piece of

tic data is applied to deduce Axial and Directional

iron, called rotor. To make the motor turns, ﬁrst electromag-
net is given power, which magnetically attracts the rotor’s
teeth. When the rotor’s teeth are aligned to the ﬁrst electro-
magnet, they are slightly oﬀset from the next electromagnet.
This means that when the next electromagnet is turned on
and the ﬁrst is turned oﬀ, the rotor rotates slightly to align
with the next one. This process is repeated afterwards. In
this way, the motor can be turned by a precise angle (see
in Figure 7). Therefore, if the motor holds still, it means
the printer maintains the activated electromagnet to stabi-
lize the rotor and the nozzle holds still as before. When the
motor rotates in a direction, it controls the nozzle move-
ment through two independent sets of transmission belts,
which have diﬀerent mechanical structures. Speciﬁcally, the
movement direction changes when the energized order of the
electromagnet reverses.
The nozzle axial movement in X or Y axis generates dis-
tinguishable sound because each motor and the correspond-
ing actuation set are in diﬀerent structures. The directional
movement on the same axis (i.e., up or down, left or right),
on the other hand, is determined by the conﬁguration of the
energized order in the electromagnet and the belt rotation.
Therefore, the directional movement is much challenging to
deduce based on the smartphone’s acoustic data because the
reverse conﬁguration produces similar sound.
A recent study [12] is in coherence with our observation
from a diﬀerent angle. Zoom H6 Acoustic Recorder [10]
was employed to collect the subtle diﬀerence of the vibra-
tion (frame energy) conducted from the motor to the nozzle
when the nozzle moved in two directions in one axis. As a
professional recorder, Zoom H6 is much more powerful in the
recording capability when compared to the smartphone. Ta-
ble 1 lists the main diﬀerences in the speciﬁcations. There-
fore, it is diﬃcult for the smartphone to well detect such
subtle directional information and we need to explore other
side channels.

4. EXPLORING MAGNETIC SIDE CHAN-
NEL AND BEYOND
The mechanism of the stepper motor inspires us to explore
the relationship between the magnetic side channel and the
nozzle movement. Therefore, we perform pilot experiments
to investigate the magnetic ﬁeld from the smartphone’s per-
spective of view when the nozzle conducts the directional
movement in X or Y axis.
4.1 Magnetic Side Channel and Directional
Movement
Figure 8: The experiment setup to explore the mag-
netic side channel. Speciﬁc trajectory is designed to
investigate the relationship between the directional
movement and the magnetic side channel. The coor-
dinates of the smartphone as well as the 3D printer
are plotted respectively.
We implement the sensor data collection application on
Nexus 5 with Android OS 6.01. As shown in Figure 8, the
smartphone is placed on the table to collect the magnetic
data. The smartphone’s built-in sensors have their own co-
ordinates, which are high-lighted in the ﬁgure. Due to the
limitation in space, we only show the study in one axis for
the purpose of demonstration. We design a speciﬁc trajec-
tory which mainly contains two directional movements in
the Y axis: Y-Up and Y-Down. The recording rate of the
magnetic sensor data was 100Hz.
Figure 9: The detected magnetic data when the noz-
zle operates the directional movement in the Y axis.
Speciﬁcally, Y-Up is colored in red and Y-Down is
colored in blue.
As depicted in Figure 9, we plot the magnetic data in each
sensor coordinate, respectively. Specially, the red segment
refers to Y-Up and the blue one refers to Y-Down. Inter-
estingly, distinguishable patterns in the magnetic ﬁeld are
observed. When the nozzle operates one typical directional
movement (either Y-Up or Y-Down), the detected magnetic
data in each coordinate demonstrates high degree of consis-
tency in the signal pattern. The drift in the pattern when
the nozzle moves from one side of the platform to the other
does not aﬀect the overall tendency. The directional move-
ment in the X axis also shows the similar result in the mag-
netic data. Therefore, magnetic side channel contains rich
information to deduce the directional movement.
4.2 Magnetic Channel Model
We utilize the magnetic side channel to predict the nozzle
directional movement. Speciﬁcally, we train the magnetic
channel model based on the magnetic data using support
vector machines (SVM). Feature extraction is conducted to
better represent the original signal in the feature space.
Feature Extraction.
We extract a set of features to characterize the signal’s
directional behavior in both the temporal and spectral do-
mains. Speciﬁcally, the temporal features are computed
from the waveform of the magnetic ﬁeld signal, while spec-
tral features are acquired performing a P-point Fast Fourier

Transform to each signature of the magnetic ﬁeld signal [40].
In the temporal domain, we investigate the signal tendency
by deriving the velocity and the averaged ﬁrst order deriva-
tive. Other features, such as interquartile range, zero cross-
ing rate, mean crossing rate, skewness and kurtosis, reﬂect
the distribution of the signal.
Particularly, for a given signal frame X, interquartile range
(IQR) measures the statistical dispersion within each seg-
mentation, which is the diﬀerence between 75th and 25th
percentiles of the signal over the window:
IQR = mean[X(
n
2
:
3n
4
)] − mean[X(1 :
n
4
)].
(7)
Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of the probability
distribution of the real-valued data:
E[(X − µ)3]
γ =
(E[(X − µ)2])3/2 ,
(8)
where µ is the mean and E is the expectation operator.
Similarly, kurtosis is a descriptor of the shape of a proba-
bility distribution and refer to the degree of asymmetry and
peakedness of the signal distribution:
Kurt =
E[(X − µ)4]
(E[(X − µ)2])2 .
(9)
Besides, we calculate the correlation between each pair of
the sensor coordinates:
corr(X, Y ) =
E[(X − µX )(Y − µY )]
σX σY
,
(10)
where σX , σY are standard deviations.
In the spectral domain, we explore the spectral energy
and entropy, which measure the energy changes in signal
and infer the motion diﬀerence. Let xf f ti, i = 1, ..., n be
the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) coeﬃcient of X.
Energy(X) =
1
n
(2 ∗ xf f ti).
(11)
For spectral entropy, which is deﬁned as the normalized
information entropy of the discrete FFT component mag-
nitudes of the signal, we ﬁrst divide the spectral xf f t into
m sub bins xf f t(j), j = 1, ..., m and normalize them by the
number of bins. Therefore, Power Spectral Density is calcu-
lated as:
P (j) =
|xf f t(m)|2.

n−1(cid:88)

Then Probability Density Function can be derived by nor-
malizing the calculated PSD:
p(j) =
.
(13)
Hence, we can formulate the spectral entropy as:
P (j)(cid:80)
j P (j)
SE = − m(cid:88)
p(j)log2pj.
(14)
4.3 Acoustic Channel Model
j=1
Although acoustic side channel can not well distinguish
the nozzle direction movement, it can still be eﬀective in
other aspects. The acoustic channel model is trained in
the similar way as the magnetic one. However, we extract
additional features to explore the features in the acoustic
side channel.
In the temporal domain, we further intro-
duce parameters such as mean, median, standard deviation
and variance [24] to represent the statistic features of the
sound. In the spectrum domain, Mel-frequency cepstral co-
eﬃcients (MFCC) are widely used in audio signal processing
and proven to be eﬀective [31, 30]. As a result, we also in-
corporate it into the feature set.
5. MAGNETIC-ENHANCED IP SIDE-
CHANNEL ATTACK
In this section, we introduce a magnetic-enhanced side-
channel approach to attack the 3D printing IP via smart-
phone in the physical layer. Figure 10 shows the proposed
end-to-end framework from side channel information acqui-
sition to IP reconstruction. The detail of each module is
described as follows:
5.1 Side Channel Information
During the process of 3D printing, we collect the side-
channel information via smartphone and pre-process the data
for further analysis.
• Data Acquisition: We implement a smartphone record-
ing application which can simultaneously and contin-
uously collect the magnetic and acoustic data.
• Pre-processing: To remove the signal noise generated
by other interferes as well as white noise, we apply
Savitzky-Golay ﬁlter [34] on the collected data. Com-
pared to the most common moving average ﬁlter, it is a
much better procedure which performs a least squares
ﬁt of a small set of consecutive data points to a poly-
nomial and take the calculated central point of the ﬁt-
ted polynomial curve as the new smoothed data point.
After that, we segment the signal into separate frames
with a ﬁxed frame size.
5.2 Primitive Operation Analysis
Figure 11: The hierarchy diagram shows the sequen-
tial relationship between the primitive operations
based on the 3D printing mechanism.
In Section 2.2, we introduce the primitive operations in 3D
printing: Layer Movement, Header Movement, Axial Move-
ment, and Directional Movement. The inner sequential con-
nection is determined by the fabrication characteristic of
3D printing. Figure 11 depicts the hierarchy relationship
between these primitive operations.
In order to infer the
printer operations in each level, we extract the mechanism
parameters of the printer (using status analysis functions)
based on the data frames we obtained. After that, we inte-
grate all the information we obtain into parameter sequences
in time series. In detail, we describe the parameter extrac-
tion steps as follows:
• Layer Movement Analysis: For each data frame, we
ﬁrst determine whether it refers to the nozzle operation
in the X-Y plane or the platform movement in the Z
axis. Note that the actuation system for the platform
is very diﬀerent from the one for the nozzle because it
contains a deformed bar instead of the belt. Therefore,
platform movement generates unique acoustic signal.
As a result, we apply acoustic channel model in this
step.
• Header Movement Analysis: When the header prints
with a regular printing speed, it continuously extrudes
melted material. The extrusion unit speed is speciﬁ-
cally determined by the layer height and the material.
When the header performs a quick alignment, the ma-
terial is no longer extruded and a much faster speed is
applied to avoid the stringing eﬀect [5]. The fast move-
ment generates the acoustic signal with a signiﬁcant
pattern. Hence, acoustic channel model is employed
in this step to predict the header status and further
infer whether the material needs to be extruded.
• Axial Movement Analysis: If the nozzle movement is
in the X-Y plane, we need to further distinguish which
axis the nozzle moves along with. Based on the pre-
liminary result in Section 3, we ﬁnd that the acoustic
side channel performs well in predicting the nozzle ax-
ial movement.
• Directional Movement Analysis: Once knowing the
speciﬁc axis the movement occurs, we investigate the
moving direction in the last step. Based on the dis-
cussion in Section 4.1, we adopt the magnetic channel
model to infer the directional information in the X or
Y axis.
• Integration: Eventually, we obtain the predicted printer
operation parameters (Time stamp/Distance/Device
info) in each frame. We integrate all the information
and generate the printer parameter set in time series.
