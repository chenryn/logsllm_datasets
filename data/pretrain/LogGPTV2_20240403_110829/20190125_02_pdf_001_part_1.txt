## What is Amazon RDS Performance Insights?

Customers have requested a tool that provides:
- **Visibility into the performance of Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) databases.**
- **An easy-to-use tool for optimizing cloud database workloads.**
- **A single, unified interface for monitoring and managing performance.**

This is particularly important for organizations with part-time or no dedicated DBAs.

## First Step: Amazon RDS Enhanced Monitoring

- **Released in 2016.**
- **Provides OS metrics and process/thread lists.**
- **Offers up to 1-second granularity.**

---

## Introducing: Performance Insights

- **Dashboard:** Provides a visual representation of database load.
- **DB Load:** Displays the overall load on the database.
- **Adjustable Timeframe:** Allows users to view data over different time periods.
- **Filterable by Attribute:** Users can filter by SQL, User, Host, and Wait.
- **SQL Causing Load:** Identifies the specific SQL queries causing the most load.
- **Phased Delivery:** Available for Amazon Aurora, Amazon RDS for MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and MariaDB.
- **Guided Discovery:** Helps both beginners and experts identify and resolve performance issues.
- **Core Metric:** "Database Load" is the primary metric used.

## Understanding "Database Load"

- **Connection List:** Shows all active and idle connections.
- **Sampling:** Every second, we sample the state of each active session.
- **Data Collected:**
  - **SQL Query:** The query being executed.
  - **State:** CPU, I/O, lock, commit log wait, and more.
  - **Host and User:** Information about the host and user executing the query.
- **Average Active Sessions (AAS):** The average number of active sessions over a given period.

## Performance Insights Dashboard

The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the database's performance, including:
- **Graphs and Charts:** Visual representations of key metrics.
- **Filters and Controls:** Tools to customize the view and focus on specific aspects of performance.

## Sampling and AAS

### Sampling
- **Analogy to Film:** Sampling every second is like capturing frames in a film.
- **Example:**
  - **Time:** Each second is a frame.
  - **Users:** Different users running queries.
  - **Queries:** Fast, slow, and frequently run queries are captured.

### Active Session State
- **Example:**
  - **Time:** Each second shows the state of each query (idle, active).
  - **Queries:** Different queries and their states over time.

### AAS Load Graph
- **Graph Representation:**
  - **Users:** Different users and their active sessions.
  - **Active Sessions:** The number of active sessions at any given time.
- **Example:**
  - **Time:** Each second shows the number of active sessions.
  - **Users:** Different users and their contribution to the active session count.

## Average Active Session

- **Example:**
  - **Time:** Each second shows the number of active sessions.
  - **Users:** Different users and their contribution to the active session count.
  - **Graph:** A visual representation of the number of active sessions over time.
