User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to check my linux server isn't spamming I'm worried about dodgy php scripts or other malicious software on my linux server sending out spam. Or maybe I left an open relay

What are the ways to check I'm not sending any spam out?

Assistant: One of the easiest ways is to check your /var/log/maillog (default location) to see if it's sending out mail that you're not expecting.
