Need to be able to CRUD namespace resources.
Do during or after the query-parameter -> namespace-in-path transition.
A namespace object just contains the name of the namespace, and no other data
that I can think of at this time.
An object cannot be created in a namespace unless the namespace object already
exists.
Reasons:
  * prevent accidental creation of new namespaces as a side effect of object creation with mistyped namespace name.
  * limit which users can create new namespaces, as there may be some policy around who can get which names.
  * to ease validation/warning about authorization policy, admission control policy, etc, which references namespaces.
  * to ease listing/watching namespaces in peripheral system components.
