Abstract. IEEE 802.3 Ethernet networks, a standard LAN environ-
ment, provide a way to auto-negotiate the settings of capacity (10, 100,
or 1000 Mb/s) and duplex (full- or half-). Under certain conditions de-
scribed below, the auto-negotiation protocol fails to work properly. The
resultant conﬁguration problem, duplex mismatch, appears to be com-
mon; when this problem occurs, the connectivity is impaired, but not
completely removed. This can result in performance problems that are
hard to locate.
This paper describes a work in progress aimed at (i) studying the con-
dition of duplex mismatch in IEEE 802.3 Ethernet networks, (ii) produc-
ing an analytical model of duplex mismatch, (iii) validating the model,
(iv) studying the eﬀects of duplex mismatch on TCP throughput, (v) de-
signing an algorithm for duplex mismatch detection using data from
active testing, and (vi) incorporating the detection algorithm into an
existing open-source network troubleshooting tool (NDT).

Introduction
Ethernet duplex mismatch is a condition that occurs when two devices commu-
nicating over an IEEE 802.3 Ethernet link (typically, a host and a switch) do
not agree on the duplex mode of the direct Ethernet connection between them;
the switch might operate as if the connection were full-duplex with the host
operating in half-duplex mode, or vice versa (section 2 describes the condition
in more detail). Duplex mismatch causes some packets to be lost (see section 3)
and, in many cases, leads to serious performance degradation (see section 4.2).
Section 5 discusses soft failures similar to duplex mismatch. Section 6 describes
an algorithm to detect a duplex mismatch condition by observing the behavior of
the network when test traﬃc is injected, and describes integrating the detection
algorithm into our existing network testing system.

around the world. The original protocol was developed for communications over
shared media and uses the Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detec-
tion (CSMA/CD) protocol to arbitrate access to the shared media. That the
media is shared means that a host could either transmit or receive data at any
given time (in other words, devices operate in a half-duplex mode). Later en-
hancements deﬁne how devices can communicate over a wide variety of co-axial,
twisted-pair, and ﬁber-optic cables. The twisted-pair and ﬁber-optic cable pro-
tocols allow for development of switched network environments—enabling a de-
vice to simultaneously transmit and receive data (thus, operating in a full-duplex
mode). All IEEE 802.3-compliant implementations (10-, 100-, and 1000-Mb/s)
must support half-duplex operations and may support full-duplex operations.
2.1 Half-Duplex Ethernet Operation
To reliably operate in the half-duplex mode ([1], section 4.1), it is necessary
to specify how a device should operate when several devices attempt to trans-
mit simultaneously (a collision event is said to occur when this happens). The
CSMA/CD protocol is used to resolve collisions: in half-duplex mode, an inter-
face will monitor the Carrier Sense (CS) ﬂag at all times to determine if any
device is transmitting data on the network; when the local device has data to
send, these data pass through one or more upper-layer protocols and ﬁnally ar-
rive at the local interface layer where they are encapsulated into an Ethernet
frame. The transmitting interface checks the CS ﬂag and, if it is true, holds the
frame in the transmit queue. When the CS ﬂag becomes false, an inter-frame
gap (IFG) timer is started. When this timer expires, the frame is transmitted
onto the network. While the frame is being transmitted, the interface moni-
tors the outgoing data to detect if another device has also started to transmit.
This Collision Detection (CD) algorithm improves network eﬃciency by stop-
ping transmissions when they are obviously corrupted. The CSMA/CD protocol
also prescribes a way to retransmit frames after the collision is detected.
Two types of collisions may be detected by the transmitting interface. A slot
time is deﬁned as the time it takes to transmit the ﬁrst 64 octets (512 octets
for 1000-Mb/s interfaces) of the frame. A normal collision will occur within
the slot time period, a late collision will occur from the end of the slot time
to the end of the frame. If no collision is detected within the slot time, the
transmitting interface is said to have captured the network. If a normal collision
is detected, an interface will halt its transmission, broadcast a jamming signal to
ensure the collision is detected by other devices, and then wait a pseudo-random
time before attempting to transmit again. A host that detects a late collision
will still stop transmitting its frame and discard the incoming frame. At speeds
up to 100 Mb/s, the standard does not make it mandatory to retransmit the
outgoing frame (this is implementation-speciﬁc); at 1000 Mb/s, the frame shall
be discarded. Late collisions should not occur on a properly operating network.
Full-Duplex Ethernet Operation
2.2
With the introduction of the 10BASE-T speciﬁcation for 10-Mb/s twisted-pair
media ([1], section 14.1.2), full-duplex operation over switched network connec-

tions became possible. In switched mode, a network link capable of transmitting
and receiving data simultaneously is dedicated to each device in the network.
This usually means that two twisted-pair copper or ﬁber-optic cables are used
create a bidirectional network link. This operating mode oﬀers several advan-
tages over half-duplex operation: a device can transmit data whenever they are
available, thus improving performance; in addition, the need for CSMA/CD van-
ishes, thus simplifying the operation and making it ostensibly more robust.
When a device has data to send in full-duplex mode ([1], section 4.1), an
Ethernet frame is created and placed in the transmit queue. The frame at the
head of the queue is transmitted after the expiration of the IFG timer. Since
collisions are impossible, a higher throughput can be achieved; the interface can
also stop monitoring the CS and CD ﬂags.
2.3 Auto-Conﬁguration on Ethernet
In addition to operating in full- or half-duplex mode, the IEEE 802.3 speciﬁ-
cations ([1], section 28.2) describe how a device can conﬁgure itself to operate
in an unknown environment by use of a negotiation protocol that detects the
capacity and duplex settings. The protocol uses an out-of-band pulse-code se-
quence based on the 10BASE-T link integrity test pulses. This string of closely
spaced pulses, the Fast Link Pulse (FLP) burst, encodes the operating modes
that each interface is capable of supporting into a Link Code Word (LCW).
The protocol operates thusly: at power-on, after a physical cable is con-
nected, or after a management command is received, the interface enters the
auto-negotiation phase. At this time, the interface starts sending FLP bursts to
the remote interface and listening for incoming FLP bursts. An old 10BASE-T-
only interface will begin sending only single Normal Link Pulses (NLP), indi-
cating it does not support the auto-negotiation function. The receiving interface
measures the interval between NLP pulses to diﬀerentiate between the NLP and
FLP bursts. If the FLP bursts are detected, then the Auto-Negotiate ﬂag in
the Media Independent Interface (MII) control register is set to true and the
auto-negotiation process continues. If the FLP bursts are not detected, auto-
negotiation is disabled and the interface is brought up in its default state.
The default parameter settings ([1], section 22.2.4) determine how the inter-
face will operate if auto-negotiation fails (the interface will set the interface to
the highest possible speed and half-duplex).
Upon receipt of three consecutive and consistent LCWs, the receiving inter-
face will respond by setting the ack bit in the transmitted LCWs and the MII
control register to true. The receipt of three consecutive and consistent LCWs
with the ack bit set indicates that the peer interface has received the negoti-
ation parameters and is ready to complete the negotiation process. The mode
priority ([1], annex 28b.3) settings determine how the auto-negotiation process
determines which speed and duplex setting to use. This process prefers the high-
est performance capability that both interfaces support, so 100 Mb/s is preferred
over 10 Mb/s and full-duplex is preferred over half.
In addition to the auto-negotiation protocol, an auto-sense protocol ([1], sec-
tion 28.2.3.1) can detect 100BASE-TX, 100BASE-T4, and 10BASE-T interfaces
138

that do not support the auto-negotiation protocol. In this situation, an interface
that receives an NLP signal will use the link integrity test functions to detect the
speed of the peer interface. While speed and media type (TX or T4) is detected,
only half-duplex operations are supported by this protocol.
Some older (or cheaper) network interface cards support only half-duplex
mode; most modern cards support both auto-negotiation and manual conﬁgu-
ration modes. It should be noted that the speed and duplex settings chosen by
an interface are never explicitly communicated to the peer interface. We believe
this lack of robustness makes the auto-negotiation protocol susceptible to errors
that can cause operational problems on real networks.
2.4 Duplex Mismatch
While auto-conﬁguration makes connecting to the network easier, it can lead to
major performance problems when it fails, as it sometimes does [2]. If the two
sides of a Fast Ethernet connection disagree on the duplex mode (i.e., one is
using full- and the other is using half-), a duplex mismatch is said to occur.
A duplex mismatch can happen in one of these ways (among others), but the
symptoms seen by the hosts will be the same regardless of the cause:
1. One card is hard-coded to use full-duplex and the other is set to auto-
negotiate: the hard-coded side will not participate in negotiation and the
auto-negotiating side will use its half-duplex default setting;
2. The two cards are hard-coded to use diﬀerent duplex modes;
3. Both cards are set to auto-negotiate, but one or both of them handles auto-
negotiation poorly [3, 4]; note that, in this case, the problem can occur spo-
radically and rebooting or resetting the interface on either side could clear
the condition.
3 Predicted Behavior
When duplex mismatch happens, a peculiar breakdown in communication oc-
curs. Denote the interface that thinks that the connection is in full-duplex mode
F and the interface that thinks that the connection is in half-duplex mode H.
3.1 Model of the Pattern of Layer-3 Packet Loss
Denote the propagation delay between H and F by δ (in seconds),1 the period
of time after starting to send during which H will retransmit in case of collision
by ξ (in seconds),2 and the capacity of the link by c (in bits/second). Let us
consider the two directions separately.
1 The standard requires that cables not exceed 100 m in length; this means that δ ≤
0.5 µs for 100-Mb/s Ethernet.
2 Note that ξ is determined by a speciﬁc interface card model. The standard guar-
antees that for 10- and 100-Mb/s Ethernet, ξ ≥ 512/c; for 1000-Mb/s Ethernet,
ξ = 4096/c = 4096/109 ≈ 4.1 µs.

F → H Duplex mismatch can cause loss in this direction (but no extra delays
can be introduced, as F never delays frames in its transmit queue and never
retransmits frames). Suppose that a frame is being sent in this direction at time
tF . It will be lost if and only if it starts arriving at H while H is sending: i.e.,
there exists a frame of size m (in bits) sent by H at time tH such that
tH < tF + δ < tH + m/c.
