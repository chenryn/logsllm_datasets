User: I know coroutine in Python use get = yield ret , callee.send() , callee.next().
But I havn't find above things such as call.send() in Tornado Source code gen.py.
How to explain coroutine in Tornado with an easy understand way? Without a Bigger picture, I just
can't understand what Tornado did.
Assistant: gen.py does call send(), but in Runner.run(), not in engine() or coroutine() as you might expect. 
It seems that engine() and coroutine() basically evaluate the wrapped function to see whether it returns a generator. If it does, it calls Runner.run() on the result, which internally seems to loop over send(). It's not exactly obvious what it's doing though...
