**ATT&CK ID:** T1010  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Application Window Discovery

Adversaries may attempt to enumerate open application windows on a system. This technique can provide valuable information about the user's activities and the applications currently in use. For example, by identifying open windows, adversaries can determine potential data of interest for exfiltration. Additionally, this method can help them identify security tools (e.g., Security Software Discovery) that they may need to evade or disable to avoid detection.
