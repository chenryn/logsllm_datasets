## Overview of Data Forensics
### Historical Context
Historically, data forensics has focused on imaging and analyzing standalone personal computers (PCs) with small hard drives and DOS-based utilities.

### Evolving Data Forensics
#### First Agents of Change
- Significantly larger hard drives (>500MB)
- Significant increase in the number of PCs
- Increase in the use of PCs in criminal activities

#### Second Agents of Change
- Significant increase in the use of non-PC devices (servers, handhelds, digital cameras, etc.)
- Increase in non-Windows operating systems (MacOS, UNIX, Linux, etc.)

### Current State of Data Forensics
Electronic data is now stored in a wide range of devices, from wristwatches and telephony boxes to enterprise servers. Forensic examiners are increasingly dealing with "non-traditional" PCs, and corporate security personnel often serve as first responders to incidents. Critical data is also residing in volatile system memory.

## Definition of Next Generation (NG) Forensics
"The scientific process of imaging and analyzing data stored in any electronic format, for the purpose of reporting findings in a neutral manner, with no predisposition as to guilt or innocence."
â€” Thomas Rude, 2002

## NG Forensics & Linux
### Why Linux?
Linux is emerging as the platform of choice for next-generation data forensics due to its powerful features:

- **Everything as a File:** All hardware and system components are treated as files, providing a high degree of control.
- **Support for Numerous File System Types:** Linux can interpret many file system types, including ext2, ext3, FFS, HPFS, FAT, VFAT, NTFS, ISO9660, UDF, UFS, etc.
- **Minimally Invasive Analysis of Live Systems:** Linux provides methods to analyze compromised systems in their running state with minimal invasiveness.
- **Chaining Commands:** Commands can be chained together to increase productivity.
- **Monitoring and Logging:** Rich auditing and logging capabilities allow for detailed tracking of user activities.
- **Source Code Review:** Open-source nature allows for customization and increased technical knowledge.
- **Trusted Boot Media:** Customizable bootable media can be created for personalized toolsets and trusted binaries.

### Benefits to Forensic Examiners
- **File Recognition and Control:** The ability to control how the operating system interacts with devices, ensuring consistent read-only mounting that does not alter the data on the evidentiary device.
- **File System Support:** Chances are high that a driver for the specific file system type is already available, allowing for logical data viewing without the need for additional drivers.
- **Live System Analysis:** Trusted binaries on trusted media (e.g., floppy, CD) and tools like `script` and `time` provide accurate logs of commands and their execution times.
- **Command Chaining and Redirection:** Examples include:
  - `dd if=/dev/hdd conv=noerror bs=1024 of=image1 2>> image_error_log ; md5sum image1 > image1_hash`
  - `dd if=/dev/sda conv=noerror bs=1024 | gzip > scsi_image.gz`
  - `dd if=/dev/sda conv=noerror bs=1024 | split -b 640m`
  - `cat xa* > new_sda_image_file`
- **Auditing and Logging:** Commands like `script`, `w`, `pstree`, `ps`, `strace`, and `lsof` provide a trail of what happened, when, and by whom.
- **Source Code Customization:** Open-source commands allow for customization and a deeper understanding of the underlying processes.
- **Customized Boot Media:** Personalized toolsets and trusted binaries can be created for various forensic scenarios.

### Conclusion
The power of Linux significantly enhances the capabilities of forensic examiners, making it a robust platform for next-generation data forensics.
