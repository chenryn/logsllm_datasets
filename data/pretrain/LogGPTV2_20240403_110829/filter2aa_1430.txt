Data Forensics, Infancy
Thomas Rude, © 2002 
Historically data forensics has focused on 
imaging and analyzing standalone personal 
computers (PCs).
- small hard drives
- DOS-based utilities
Evolving Data Forensics
Thomas Rude, © 2002 
First agents of change;
- significantly larger hard drives (>500MB)
- significant increase in number of PCs
- increase in use of PCs in crimes
Evolving Data Forensics
Thomas Rude, © 2002 
Second agents of change;
- significant increase in use of non-PC devices
- servers, handhelds, digital cameras, etc.
- increase in non-Windows operating systems
- MacOS, UNIX flavors, Linux flavors, 
etc.
Evolving Data Forensics

Where does the data forensic community stand 
today?
Electronic data is stored in many devices, 
ranging from wrist watches, telephony boxes, 
and enterprise servers.  Increasingly forensic 
examiners are dealing with 'non-traditional' PCs, 
corporate security personnel are first responders 
to incidents, and critical data is residing in 
volatile system memory.
NG Forensics Defined
Thomas Rude, © 2002 
"The scientific process of imaging and analyzing 
data stored in any electronic format, for the 
purpose of reporting findings in a neutral manner, 
with no predisposition as to guilt or innocence."

Next generation data forensics platform of 
choice?
Linux

What makes Linux so powerful?
- everything, including hardware, is a file
- support for numerous file system types
- ability to analyze a live system in a minimally   
invasive manner
- ability to chain commands
- ability to monitor and log processes & commands
- ability to review source code
- ability to create bootable media

File Recognition within Linux;
- ease of replication (clear text config files)
- seeing everything as a file allows for a degree of 
control over that file
- degree of security
- degree of granularity over how the operating 
system environment behaves

File Recognition within Linux;
- So what is the benefit to the forensic examiner? 
- examiner has ability to control how the 
operating system touches devices
(I.E., consistent mounting of devices in a read 
only manner that does not alter the data on 
the evidentiary device)

Numerous File System Types Support;
- Linux can interpret many file system types, 
including; ext2, ext3, FFS, HPFS, FAT, 
VFAT, NTFS, ISO9660, UDF, UFS, etc.
- Win32 can interpret a few file system types, 
including; FAT, VFAT, and NTFS

Numerous File System Types Support;
- So what does this mean for the examiner?
- If you use Win32 as your platform for 
analysis and you wish to view data in its 
logical format, then you must have a 
driver 
for that specific file system type written.  
- Win32 + no fs driver = one big blob

Numerous File System Types Support;
- So what does this mean for the examiner?
- If you use Linux as your platform for 
analysis and you wish to view data in its 
logical format, chances are you already 
have 
a driver for that fs type availabe for use
- Linux + fs driver = pretty logical format

Analyzing a Live System, Minimally Invasively;
- Almost all compromised systems have trojaned 
commands
- Linux provides a method for analyzing this 
compromised system, in its running state, in 
a 
minimally invasive manner

Analyzing a Live System, Minimally Invasively;
- The goal of all data forensic work is to not alter 
the evidence wherever possible
- Extremely difficult to perform
- However, Linux can prove helpful
NG Forensics & Linux

Analyzing a Live System, Minimally Invasively;
- Trusted binaries on trusted media (floppy, CD)
- Use Vi editor to issue commands without 
stepping all over the system logs
- Commands such as 'script' can be used in 
conjunction with 'time' to provide an 
accurate log of what commands were issued and 
at what time
NG Forensics & Linux

Chaining Commands;
- commands useful to the forensic examiner may 
be chained together in order to increase 
productivity
- example;
dd if=/dev/hdd conv=noerror bs=1024 of=image1 2>> 
image_error_log ; md5sum image1 > image1_hash
NG Forensics & Linux
Thomas Rude, © 2002 
Chaining Commands;
- Linux also provides ability to redirect standard 
input/output/error
- examples;
dd if=/dev/sda conv=noerror bs=1024 | gzip > scsi_image.gz
dd if=/dev/sda conv=noerror bs=1024 | split -b 640m
cat xa* > new_sda_image_file

Ability to Monitor and Log Processes & 
Commands;
- Linux provides an environment rich in auditing 
and logging user activities
- Value to forensic examiner?  Trail of what 
happened when and by whom or what.
- Commands include; script, w, pstree, ps, 
strace, 
lsof, etc.

Source Code Review;
- most all commands used by a forensic examiner 
on the Linux platform are open source, and 
therefore, their code is freely available for 
review
- allows for customization of code
- more importantly, allows for increased 
technical knowledge (knowing what's 
happening 'behind the scenes') and 
ability to 
defend tool

Trusted Boot Media;
- Whether a floppy diskette or a CD-ROM, 
bootable Linux media can be created and 
customized
- Allows forensic examiner to create personalized 
toolsets for most any situation, as well as trusted 
binaries to use for processing

What does all of this mean?
- The power of Linux empowers the forensic 
examiner
