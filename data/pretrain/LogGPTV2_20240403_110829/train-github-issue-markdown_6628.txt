### Source code
  * I provided exact source code that allows reproducing the issue locally.
My website asynchronously navigates to another page while I am trying to use
locators like this in a loop (because I am waiting for one of two locators to
become visible):
    navbar
        .locator(LOGGED_IN_NAVBAR_SELECTOR)
        .locator(ACCOUNT_MENU_BUTTON_SELECTOR)
        .isVisible();
This results in an error "Execution context was destroyed". I have reproduced
this on Webkit and Firefox, but could not manage to reproduce it with
Chromium. It's not happening every time because of the racy nature of the
async navigation. I don't know if Chromium doesn't have this problem or the
timing is just different, thereby avoiding the error.

This is actually the same issue as #16720  
The solution there was to use `assertThat(locator).isVisible`.
This doesn't work here, because I am manually waiting for one of two
conditions to occur, so I need to use `Locator.isVisible`.
Previously this was "solved" (?) by putting a
`Page.waitForLoadState(LoadState.NETWORKIDLE)` in front of the visibility
checking loop. This presumably worked because the async navigation happens
shortly after loading the page, so it would have happened during the
NETWORKIDLE waiting, after which the execution context is stable.
I now removed the `waitForLoadState` because NETWORKIDLE is discouraged, and
asserting for web elements is recommended, per #22897 (comment)
But then this bug got triggered instead.
