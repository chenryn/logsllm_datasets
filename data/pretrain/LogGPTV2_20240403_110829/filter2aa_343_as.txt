Standard Attributes in Config Records
The following table specifies facts about the standard attributes, or data types, found in 
config records of Mac OS X data services. 
Mac OS X Server version 10.2 and later uses the following two types of config records:
• The mcx_cache record always has the RecordName of mcx_cache. It also uses 
RealName and DataStamp to determine whether the cache should be updated or 
the server settings ignored. If you want managed clients, you must have an 
mcx_cache config record.
• The passwordserver record has the additional attribute PasswordServerLocation.
Use these facts when mapping LDAP or Active Directory domains to Mac OS X 
directory services.

B Open Directory Password Server 
Authentication Methods
Open Directory Password Server is based on the SASL 
standard for supporting multiple methods of 
authenticating user passwords.
The authentication methods supported by Open Directory Password Server include 
APOP, CRAM-MD5, DHX, Digest-MD5, MS-CHAPv2, SMB-NT, SMB-LAN Manager, and 
WebDAV-Digest. Open Directory Password Server can support a wide range of 
authentication methods because it is based on the Simple Authentication and Security 
Layer (SASL) standard. 
Open Directory needs to support many different authentication method because each 
service that requires authentication uses some methods but not others. File service 
uses one set of authentication methods, Web service uses another set of methods, mail 
service uses another set, and so on.
Some authentication methods are more secure than others. The more secure methods 
use tougher algorithms to encode the information that they transmit between client 
and server. The more secure authentication methods also store passwords in a form 
that can’t be recovered from the server.
Enabling or Disabling Authentication Methods
All password authentication methods supported by Open Directory Password Server 
are initially enabled. You can disable and enable Open Directory Password Server 
authentication methods by using the NeST command in Terminal. For information, see 
the command-line administration guide.
When deciding whether to disable or enable authentication methods, your goal should 
be to provide maximum convenience to legitimate users while keeping other users 
from gaining access to the server. Consider the following:
• Which types of password validation are needed by the services that my server or 
servers provide?
• What balance do I want between ease of access and security?
• What types of hardware and software will the server’s clients use?
• Is my server in a physically secure location?
LL2352.Book  Page 173  Friday, August 22, 2003  3:12 PM
174
Appendix B    Open Directory Password Server Authentication Methods
Note:  Disabling or enabling an authentication method may necessitate resetting 
passwords in user accounts. If a user can’t use additional methods after you enable 
them, the user or a directory domain administrator needs to reset the user’s password.
Basic information about Open Directory Password Server’s authentication methods is 
provided on the following pages. This information is not a substitute for a thorough 
knowledge of authentication methods and how they affect security and ease of access.
APOP Password Validation
APOP can be used for POP mail service by Mac OS X Server and users’ mail client 
software. It encodes passwords when they are sent over the network, but stores them 
in a recoverable form on the server. It offers good security during network 
transmission. A malicious user might be able to obtain passwords by gaining access to 
the server and reading the password file, although doing this would be difficult. If 
APOP is disabled, some email programs will transmit passwords over the network in 
clear text format, which is a significant security risk. If you use your server for POP 
email, you should probably keep APOP enabled.
CRAM-MD5 Password Validation
CRAM-MD5 can be used for IMAP mail service by Mac OS X Server and users’ mail client 
software. CRAM-MD5 is also used by some LDAP software. This authentication method 
encodes passwords when they are sent over the network, and stores them in a 
scrambled form on the server. It offers good security during network transmission. A 
malicious user might be able to obtain passwords by gaining access to the server and 
decoding the password file, although doing this would be very difficult. If CRAM-MD5 is 
disabled, some email programs will transmit passwords over the network in clear text 
format, which is a significant security risk. If you use your server for SMTP or IMAP 
email, you should probably keep CRAM-MD5 enabled.
DHX Password Validation
Diffie-Hellman Exchange (DHX) password validation is used by the Apple file service of 
Mac OS X Server and some other Apple Filing Protocol (AFP) file servers. DHX is 
required for Open Directory administration and password changes. A malicious user 
might be able to obtain passwords by gaining access to the server and decoding the 
password file, although doing this would be very difficult. DHX strongly encodes 
passwords when they are sent over the network. DHX cannot be disabled.
Mac OS 8.1–8.6 computers must have their AppleShare Client software upgraded to use 
DHX. 
• Mac OS 8.6 computers should use AppleShare Client version 3.8.8. 
• Mac OS 8.1–8.5 clients should use AppleShare Client version 3.8.6. 
• Mac OS 8.1–8.6 client computers that have file server volumes mount automatically 
during startup should use AppleShare Client version 3.8.3 with the DHX UAM (User 
Authentication Module) installed. The DHX UAM is included with the AppleShare 
Client 3.8.3 installation software.

Appendix B    Open Directory Password Server Authentication Methods
175
Digest-MD5 Password Validation
Digest-MD5 is used by the Mac OS X login window, many email programs, and some 
LDAP software. This authentication method encodes passwords when they are sent 
over the network, and stores them in a scrambled form on the server. It offers good 
security during network transmission. A malicious user might be able to obtain 
passwords by gaining access to the server and decoding the password file, although 
doing this would be very difficult. Digest-MD5 cannot be disabled.
MS-CHAPv2 Password Validation
MS-CHAPv2 is used by the VPN service of Mac OS X Server. This authentication method 
encodes passwords when they are sent over the network, and stores them in a 
scrambled form on the server. It offers good security during network transmission. A 
malicious user might be able to obtain passwords by gaining access to the server and 
decoding the password file, although doing this would be very difficult.
SMB-NT Password Validation
SMB-NT password validation is required by default for some Microsoft Windows 
computers to connect to the Mac OS X Server for Windows services. It is sometimes 
called Windows Secure Password Exchange (NT). It encodes passwords when they are 
sent over the network, and stores them in a scrambled form on the server. A malicious 
user might be able to obtain passwords by gaining access to the server and decoding 
the password file, although doing this would be very difficult. If SMB-NT password 
validation is disabled, each individual Windows client system must be configured to 
work with the server. If you want Windows users to be able to easily share files on your 
system, you should keep SMB-NT enabled.
SMB-LAN Manager Password Validation
SMB-LAN Manager password validation is required by default for some Microsoft 
Windows systems to connect to the Mac OS X SMB Server. It is sometimes called 
Windows Secure Password Exchange (LAN Manager). It encodes passwords when they 
are sent over the network, and stores them in a scrambled form on the server. A 
malicious user might be able to obtain passwords by gaining access to the server and 
decoding the password file, although doing this would be very difficult. If SMB-LAN 
Manager password validation is disabled, each individual Windows client system must 
be configured to work with the server. If you want Windows users to be able to easily 
share files on your system, you should keep SMB-LAN Manager enabled.
