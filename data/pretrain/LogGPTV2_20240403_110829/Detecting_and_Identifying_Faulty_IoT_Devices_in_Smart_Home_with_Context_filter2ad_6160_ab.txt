connecting all devices and outside world [25]. The home
gateway works as a central control point for collecting sensor
data and sending control commands to IoT devices. All IoT
devices in Smart Home are connected to this home gateway
directly or indirectly. The home gateway is connected to a
cloud server as an option to provide services linked to other
IoT service providers. DICE will be installed on this home
gateway.
Fig. 2 shows the overview of our DICE system. The system
consists of two phases: the precomputation phase and the
real-time phase. During the precomputation phase, our system
extracts the correlation and sensor state transition information
from the collected IoT sensor and actuator data. During the
real-time phase, our system performs a correlation check and
a transition check to detect faults in real-time based on the

B. Precomputation Phase
During the precomputation phase, DICE collects the normal
behaviors of the sensors. DICE records the context of the IoT
environment by extracting the correlation among sensors and
by computing the transition probability of the sensor state
sets and actuators. Since actuators affect sensor readings, the
extraction of only sensor correlation is sufﬁcient. It reduces the
complexity of precomputation. We assume that the data col-
lected during the precomputation phase preserve its integrity
and the IoT devices are without faults.
1) Correlation Extraction: The sensor correlation is ex-
tracted from raw sensor data. We denote the sensors as
S : St,1, St,2, ..., St,k, ..., St,n, where t represents the time
at which the data was collected, k represents the ID of a
sensor, and n represents the number of sensors. Similarly,
613

we denote the actuators as A : At,1, At,2, ..., At,j, ..., At,m,
where j represents the ID of an actuator and m represents
the number of actuators. DICE constructs a sensor state set
from the incoming raw sensor data (Fig. 3a). A sensor state
set is composed of bits that represent the activation status of
each sensor within a predeﬁned duration of time. We set the
duration of the sensor state empirically in our experiment, e.g.
one minute. There are two classes of sensors we consider: a
binary sensor and a numeric sensor. DICE applies different
techniques to set activation status on the two sensor classes.
A single binary sensor is represented by a single bit:
|St,k|St+1,k|....|St+d,k|
where d is the duration of the sensor state.
(1)
When a binary sensor is activated at least once during the
predeﬁned duration of time, the bit of the corresponding sensor
is set to ’1’ and otherwise 0’ (Eq. (1)). We use a bit-wise ’or’
operation to implement it.
When a numeric sensor is activated, the system applies three
formulas (Eqs. (2)-(4)) to deduce the activation status, in which
the results of each formula represent a bit in the state set.

where valueT hre represents a threshold value.
Eq. (2) determines if the skewness of the data during the
duration exceeds zero. μ and σ are mean value and standard
deviation of data during the duration. Eq. (3) examines the
increasing or decreasing trend of the sensor values. Eq. (4)
determines if the mean sensor value exceeds the threshold,
valueT hre. We set valueT hre as the corresponding sensor’s
mean value of the data collected during the precomputation
phase. The conversion of a numeric sensor value into binary
values enables DICE to be applied to any sensors regardless of
their classes, while minimizing the computation cost. Thereby,
we achieve the generality and feasibility requirements.
Each unique sensor state set during the precomputa-
tion phase is given a unique ID and is referred to as
a group (Fig. 3b). We denote a set of groups as G :
G1, G2, ..., Gx, ..., Gl, where x represents the ID of a group
and l is the number of groups. We denote the bits in the group
as B : B1, B2, ..., By, ..., Bp, where y represents the ID of a
bit and p is the number of bits. The number represents the ID
of the group.
Gx = {B1, B2, ..., By, ..., Bp}
(5)
where By = 0 or 1.
The ﬁnal output of the correlation extraction stage is a set
of groups (i.e., unique sensor state sets). Note that a single
614
sensor can belong to multiple sensor state sets. Also, a sensor
state set may be a subset or superset of another sensor state
set.
Our correlation extraction method does not require any
labeled training because we do not analyze the correlation of
the sensor and the activities. All previous methods performed
activity recognition have requested users to perform a list of
activities several times and annotate the start and end time of
each activities. Furthermore, some previous work had users
provide the location and hierarchy information of the sensors,
which were used for clustering the sensors. However, the
correlation extraction method we devised runs automatically
without any need for labeled training or supplementary infor-
mation. Therefore, DICE achieves the usability requirement.
2) Transition Extraction: To extract the sensor state transi-
tion information, DICE computes three transition probabilities:
group-to-group (G2G), group-to-actuator (G2A), and actuator-
to-group (A2G) transition probabilities (Fig. 4). A G2G is
the transition probability of the sequence of groups obtained
in the correlation extraction stage. For example,
if group
2 always appears after group 1 during the precomputation
phase, the transition probability of group 1 to group 2 is
100%. A G2A is the transition probability from a group to
an actuator. For example, if actuator 1 is always activated
after group 1, the transition probability of group 1 to actuator
1 is 100%. Similarly, an A2G is the transition probability
from an actuator to a group. If the activation of actuator
1 always causes changes in the sensor readings to shift to
group 2, the transition probability of actuator 1 to group 2
is 100%. We represent G2G, G2A, and A2G with three two-
dimensional matrices used in the Markov Chain [26]. Each cell
in a matrix holds the transition probability of the row’s state
to the column’s state. Thus, the ﬁnal outputs of the transition
extraction stage are three matrices, a G2G, a G2A, and a A2G,
that hold the transition probabilities. Since actuators affect
sensor readings, G2G, G2A, and A2G can be substituted for
actuator-to-actuator (A2A) transition probability. Therefore,
we do not examine A2A to reduce calculation time.
C. Real-time Phase: Detection
In real-time, DICE looks for signs of deviation from the
normal behaviors collected in the precomputation period to
detect the presence of faults. DICE conducts a correlation
check to detect correlation violations and a transition check
to detect transition violations.
1) Correlation Check: DICE converts the raw sensor data
into a sensor state set as described in Section III-B1. Then,
DICE compares the obtained sensor state set with each of
the groups obtained during the precomputation phase and
makes candidate groups upto a certain distance (Fig. 5). The
distance between two different groups is measured by the
difference in the bits. For example, if G1 = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0} and
G2 = {0, 0, 0, 1, 1}, G1 and G2 are apart by a distance of two.
The distance threshold of the candidate groups is determined
based on fault models considered. For example, if the system

considers only a single fault for the collection period, we
select the groups with less than two distance as the candidate
groups. Among the candidate groups, a group that perfectly
matches with an incoming real-time sensor state set (i.e., has a
distance of zero) is referred to as a main group. The remaining
candidate groups are referred to as probable groups. When
there exists no main group, this implies that a new sensor
correlation combination that has not been observed during the
precomputation phase has occurred. Thus, DICE regards it as
a correlation violation and proceeds to the identiﬁcation step
in Section III-D. If there exists a main group, DICE proceeds
to the transition check.
2) Transition Check: In the transition check, DICE detects
a transition violation based on G2G, G2A, and A2G obtained
from transition extraction in Section III-B2 (Fig. 6). The
transition check is necessary because non-fail-stop faults often
maintains the correlation information even after the fault.
Therefore, the transition check captures the faults that were
not caught during the correlation check. DICE examines the
following three cases:
