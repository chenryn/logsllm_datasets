Figure 8 shows that for all cases, the relative error de-
creases with increase in n. This is because both f(cid:52)(G) and
fk(cid:63)(G) signiÔ¨Åcantly increase with increase in n. SpeciÔ¨Åcally,
let f(cid:52),vi(G) ‚àà Z‚â•0 the number of triangles that involve user vi,
and fk(cid:63),vi(G) ‚àà Z‚â•0 be the number of k-stars of which user vi
is a center. Then f(cid:52)(G) = 1
i=1 f(cid:52),vi(G) and fk(cid:63),vi(G) =

i=1 fk(cid:63),vi(G). Since both f(cid:52),vi(G) and fk(cid:63),vi(G) increase
with increase in n, both f(cid:52)(G) and fk(cid:63)(G) increase at least in
proportion to n. Thus f(cid:52)(G)2 ‚â• ‚Ñ¶(n2) and fk(cid:63)(G)2 ‚â• ‚Ñ¶(n2).
In contrast, Local2Rounds(cid:52), LocalLapk(cid:63), CentralLap(cid:52), and
CentralLapk(cid:63) achieve the expected l2 loss of O(n), O(n), O(1),
and O(1), respectively (when we ignore dmax and Œµ), all of
which are smaller than O(n2). Therefore, the relative error

Figure 9 shows the results. Figure 9 shows that the al-
gorithms with Àúdmax = ÀÜdmax (noisy max degree) achieves the
relative error close to (sometimes almost the same as) the al-
gorithms with Àúdmax = dmax and signiÔ¨Åcantly outperforms the
algorithms with Àúdmax = n. This means that we can privately
estimate dmax without a signiÔ¨Åcant loss of utility.
Summary of results. In summary, our experimental results
showed that the estimation error of triangle counts is signiÔ¨Å-
cantly reduced by introducing the interaction between users
and a data collector. The results also showed that we can
achieve small relative errors (much smaller than 1) for sub-
graph counts with privacy budget Œµ = 1 or 2 in edge LDP.
As described in Section 1, non-private subgraph counts may
reveal some friendship information, and a central server may
face data breaches. Our LDP algorithms are highly beneÔ¨Åcial
because they enable us to analyze the connection patterns in a
graph (i.e., subgraph counts) or to understand how likely two
friends of an individual will also be a friend (i.e., clustering
coefÔ¨Åcient) while strongly protecting individual privacy.
6 Conclusions
We presented a series of algorithms for counting triangles
and k-stars under LDP. We showed that an additional round
can signiÔ¨Åcantly reduce the estimation error in triangles, and
the algorithm based on the Laplacian mechanism provides
an order optimal error in the non-interactive local model. We
also showed lower-bounds for general functions including
triangles and k-stars. We conducted experiments using two
real datasets, and showed that our algorithms achieve small
relative errors, especially when the number of users is large.
As future work, we would like to develop algorithms for
other subgraph counts such as cliques and k-triangles [34].

Figure 9: Relative error when Àúdmax = n (#users), dmax (max
degree), or ÀÜdmax (noisy max degree). We used Local2Rounds(cid:52)
(Œµ = 1 or 2) and LocalLapk(cid:63) (Œµ = 1 or 2) for estimating triangle
counts f(cid:52)(G) and k-star counts fk(cid:63)(G), respectively.
decreases with increase in n.
This result demonstrates that we can accurately estimate
graph statistics for large n in the local model. In particular,
the relative error is smaller in IMDB because IMDB is denser
and includes a larger number of triangles and k-stars; i.e.,
the denominator of the relative error is large. For example,
when n = 200000 and Œµ = 1, the relative error is 0.30 and
0.0028 for triangles and 2-stars, respectively. Note that the
clustering coefÔ¨Åcient requires 2Œµ because we need to estimate
both f(cid:52)(G) and fk(cid:63)(G). Yet, we can still accurately calculate
the clustering coefÔ¨Åcient with a moderate privacy budget; e.g.,
the relative error of the clustering coefÔ¨Åcient is 0.30 when the
privacy budget is 2 (i.e., Œµ = 1). If n is larger, then Œµ would be
smaller at the same value of the relative error.
Private calculation of dmax. We have so far assumed that
Àúdmax = dmax (i.e., dmax is publicly available) in our experi-
ments. We Ô¨Ånally evaluate the methods to privately calculate
dmax with Œµ0-edge LDP (described in Sections 4.1 and 4.3).
SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we used Local2Rounds(cid:52) and LocalLapk(cid:63) for
estimating f(cid:52)(G) and fk(cid:63)(G), respectively, and evaluated the
following three methods for setting Àúdmax: (i) Àúdmax = n; (ii)
Àúdmax = dmax; (iii) Àúdmax = ÀÜdmax, where ÀÜdmax is the private esti-
mate of dmax (noisy max degree) in Sections 4.1 and 4.3.
We set n = 200000 in IMDB and n = 1600000 in Orkut.
Regarding the total privacy budget Œµ in edge LDP for es-
timating f(cid:52)(G) or fk(cid:63)(G), we set Œµ = 1 or 2. We used
Œµ
10 for privately calculating dmax (i.e., Œµ0 = Œµ
10), and the re-
maining privacy budget 9Œµ
10 as input to Local2Rounds(cid:52) or
LocalLapk(cid:63). In Local2Rounds(cid:52), we set Œµ1 = Œµ2; i.e., we set
(Œµ0,Œµ1,Œµ2) = (0.1,0.45,0.45) or (0.2,0.9,0.9). Then we esti-
