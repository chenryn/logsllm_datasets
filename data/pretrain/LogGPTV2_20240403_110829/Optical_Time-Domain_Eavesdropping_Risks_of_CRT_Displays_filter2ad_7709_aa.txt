## Abstract
A novel eavesdropping technique allows for the remote reading of cathode-ray tube (CRT) displays. The light intensity emitted by a raster-scan screen as a function of time corresponds to the video signal convolved with the phosphor's impulse response. Experiments with a typical personal computer color monitor demonstrate that sufficient high-frequency content remains in the emitted light to permit the reconstruction of readable text through deconvolution of the signal received by a fast photosensor. These optical compromising emanations can be detected even after diffuse reflection from a wall. Shot noise from background light is the critical performance factor. In sufficiently dark environments and with a large enough sensor aperture, practical reception distances are achievable. This information security risk should be considered in applications with high confidentiality requirements, especially those already requiring "TEMPEST"-shielded equipment designed to minimize radio-frequency emission security concerns.

## 1. Introduction
Traditional methods for unauthorized remote access to private and confidential information, such as tapping communication links, code breaking, and impersonation, are becoming increasingly difficult as modern cryptographic protection techniques become more prevalent. Those seeking to obtain information from other people's computers without their consent or knowledge—ranging from law enforcement and intelligence service technicians to criminals and market researchers—are continuously searching for alternative means of access.

Military organizations have been aware of compromising acoustic and radio-frequency emanations from information processing equipment since the early 1960s and have established emission security (EMSEC) test standards, including shielding requirements for computers that process classified information [1, 2, 3]. A broader audience became aware of the radio-frequency information leakage from video displays and other computer peripherals through van Eck’s eavesdropping demonstration using modified TV sets [4] and subsequent research on related phenomena [5, 6, 7]. Optical emission security has also been discussed in the context of fiber-optic cables [8].

The available open literature on display emission security has primarily focused on the threat of information carried in the radio-frequency bands (primarily 3 MHz–3 GHz). However, it is important to remember that the primary purpose of display devices is to emit information suitable for human perception in the optical bands (385–790 THz frequency or 780–380 nm wavelength). As we will see, the overall light emitted by a commonly used cathode-ray tube (CRT) computer monitor is a broadband information carrier that transmits the low-pass filtered video signal via light-intensity modulation.

It is feasible to reconstruct screen contents from this information channel, even if the eavesdropper cannot position a sensor within a direct line-of-sight to the target display surface and receives the light only after diffuse reflection, for instance, from an office wall. An upper bound for the possible signal quality and eavesdropping distance is set by the shot noise from other light sources. This analysis can also be applied to other optical displays that might be targeted by an eavesdropper, such as status indicators of serial ports.

## 2. Projective Observation with Telescopes
Security experts have long recognized that any video display surface within a line of sight to an eavesdropper's hiding place could be read with the help of a telescope. Many organizations handling critical information have security policies concerning the orientation and visibility of documents, computer monitors, and keyboards relative to windows that are visible from uncontrolled spaces such as nearby streets, parking lots, or buildings.

With high-quality optics, the limiting factor for the angular resolution of a telescope is the diffraction at its aperture. For an aperture (diameter of the first lens or mirror) \( D \), the achievable angular resolution as defined by the Rayleigh criterion is:

\[
\theta = \frac{1.22 \cdot \lambda}{D}
\]

where \( \lambda \approx 500 \) nm is the wavelength of light. Typical modern office computer displays have a pixel size \( r = 0.25 \) mm (for example, in the form of a 320 × 240 mm display area on a 43 cm CRT, divided into 1280 × 1024 pixels). If the observer is located at a distance \( d \) and her viewing direction differs by an angle \( \alpha \) from a perpendicular view onto the display surface, she will see a single pixel under a viewing angle \( \theta = \frac{r}{d \cdot \cos \alpha} \). She will therefore need a telescope with an aperture of at least:

\[
D = \frac{1.22 \cdot \lambda \cdot d}{r \cdot \cos \alpha}
\]

A simple amateur astronomy telescope (with \( D = 300 \) mm) will be sufficient for reading high-resolution computer display content from up to 60 meters away, provided \( \alpha \leq 1^\circ \).

## 4. Phosphor Decay Characteristics
Commonly used phosphors are mixtures of various substances, and different excitation modes result in various wavelengths. Actual decay curves must be modeled as the sum of several exponential and power-law curves. The TEP116-C standard provides decay curves for most phosphor types, but these are plotted on a linear time scale extending over many milliseconds, providing no indication of the detailed decay during the first microsecond and thus not suitable for estimating the frequency characteristic of the phosphors above 1 MHz.

The decay curves published in TEP116-C were measured primarily to provide information about how the phosphor type might affect the perceived flicker caused by the frame refresh. Since suitable fast decay curves or closed-form approximations were not available from existing CRT phosphor literature, I conducted my own measurements on a typical example monitor.

### 4.1. Instrumentation
We are primarily interested in the rapid decay within a time interval not much longer than \( t_p \), so we need a very sensitive light sensor with, ideally, more than 100 MHz bandwidth or less than 5 ns rise and fall time. One fast light sensor is the PIN photodiode in photoconductive mode, where a reverse bias voltage is applied, and the resulting current is measured. PIN diodes have reduced capacitance and can be used with a higher bias voltage, increasing their response time. For example, a PIN diode with a "rise and fall time of about 20 µs" was used in [14] to evaluate the luminance decay of the P31 phosphor in a CRT used in vision research.

Photodiodes are now available with down to 1 ns response times for applications such as optical Gbit/s communication links and laser range finding. However, their low sensitivity of typically 0.5 A/W necessitates significant additional amplification, which would lead to additional noise and further limit the bandwidth. Avalanche photodiodes (APDs) provide greater sensitivity (102 A/W) and are also available with 1 ns response times.
