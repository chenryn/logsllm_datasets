Abstract
A new eavesdropping technique can be used to read
cathode-ray tube (CRT) displays at a distance. The inten-
sity of the light emitted by a raster-scan screen as a func-
tion of time corresponds to the video signal convolved with
the impulse response of the phosphors. Experiments with a
typical personal computer color monitor show that enough
high-frequency content remains in the emitted light to per-
mit the reconstruction of readable text by deconvolving the
signal received with a fast photosensor. These optical com-
promising emanations can be received even after diffuse re-
ﬂection from a wall. Shot noise from background light is the
critical performance factor. In a sufﬁciently dark environ-
ment and with a large enough sensor aperture, practically
signiﬁcant reception distances are possible. This informa-
tion security risk should be considered in applications with
high conﬁdentiality requirements, especially in those that
already require “TEMPEST”-shielded equipment designed
to minimize radio-frequency emission-security concerns.
1. Introduction
Classic techniques for unauthorized remote access to pri-
vate and conﬁdential information – tapping communication
links, code breaking, impersonation – become increasingly
difﬁcult as the use of modern cryptographic protection tech-
niques proliferates. Those in the business of obtaining in-
formation from other people’s computers without their con-
sent or knowledge – from law enforcement and intelligence
service technicians through criminals to market researchers
– are continuously looking for alternative means of access.
Military organizations have been aware of compromis-
ing acoustic and radio-frequency emanations from informa-
tion processing equipment since the early 1960s and es-
tablished emission security (EMSEC) test standards with
shielding requirements for computers that process classi-
ﬁed information [1, 2, 3]. A larger community became
aware of the radio-frequency information leakage of video
displays and other computer peripherals through van Eck’s
eavesdropping demonstration with modiﬁed TV sets [4] and
subsequent research on related phenomena [5, 6, 7]. Opti-
cal emission security has been discussed for ﬁber-optic ca-
bles [8].
The available open emission-security literature on dis-
plays has so far only focused on the threat of information
carried in the radio-frequency bands (primarily 3 MHz–
3 GHz). We must not forget, however, that the very pur-
pose for which display devices are designed is the emission
of information suitable for human perception in the opti-
cal bands (385–790 THz frequency or 780–380 nm wave-
length). As we will see, the overall light emitted by a com-
monly used cathode-ray tube computer monitor is a broad-
band information carrier that transmits via light-intensity
modulation the low-pass ﬁltered video signal.
It is fea-
sible to reconstruct screen contents from this information
channel, even if the eavesdropper cannot position a sensor
within a direct line-of-sight to the target display surface and
receives the light only after diffuse reﬂection, for instance
from an ofﬁce wall.
An upper bound for the possible signal quality and eaves-
dropping distance is set by the shot noise from other light
sources. Such an analysis can not only be applied to video
screens but also to any other optical displays that might be
targeted by an eavesdropper, for instance status indicators
of serial ports.
2. Projective observation with telescopes
It has of course not escaped the attention of security ex-
perts in the past that any video display surface that is within
a line of sight to an eavesdropper’s hiding place could be
read with the help of a telescope. Many organizations deal-
ing with critical information have security policies concern-
ing the orientation and visibility of documents, computer
monitors, and keyboards relative to windows that are visi-
ble from uncontrolled spaces such as nearby streets, parking
lots, or buildings.

With high-quality optics, the limiting factor for the an-
gular resolution of a telescope is the diffraction at its aper-
ture. For an aperture (diameter of the ﬁrst lens or mirror) D,
the achievable angular resolution as deﬁned by the Rayleigh
criterion is

where λ ≈ 500 nm is the wavelength of light. Typical mod-
ern ofﬁce computer displays have a pixel size r = 0.25 mm
(for example in the form of the 320 × 240 mm display area
on a 43 cm CRT, divided into 1280 × 1024 pixels). If the
observer is located at distance d and her viewing direction
differs by an angle α from a perpendicular view onto the
display surface, she will see a single pixel under a viewing
d · cos α. She will therefore need a telescope

Since commonly used phosphors are mixtures of vari-
ous substances and different excitation modes occur (result-
ing in various wavelengths), actual decay curves have to be
modeled as the sum of several exponential and power-law
curves.
The TEP116-C standard provides decay curves for most
phosphor types, but these are plotted on a linear time scale
extending over many milliseconds. These curves give no in-
dication about the detailed decay during the ﬁrst microsec-
ond and they are therefore not suitable for estimating the
frequency characteristic of the phosphors above 1 MHz.
The decay curves published in TEP116-C were measured
primarily to provide information about how the phosphor
type might affect the perceived ﬂicker caused by the frame
refresh. Since suitable fast decay curves or even closed form
approximations were not available from the existing CRT
phosphor literature, I performed my own measurements on
a typical example monitor.
4.1. Instrumentation
We are primarily interested in the rapid decay within a
time interval not much longer than tp, therefore we need a
very sensitive light sensor with, ideally, more than 100 MHz
bandwidth or less than 5 ns rise and fall time.
One fast light sensor is the PIN photodiode in photocon-
ductive mode, in which a reverse bias voltage is applied and
the resulting current is measured. The PIN photodiode has
an undoped “intrinsic” layer between the p- and n-doped
regions (hence the name). Compared with normal photo-
diodes, PIN diodes have reduced capacity and can be used
with a higher bias voltage, which increases their response
time. For example, a PIN diode with a “rise and fall time
of about 20 µs” was used in [14] to evaluate the luminance
decay of the P31 phosphor in a CRT used in vision research.
Photodiodes are now available with down to 1 ns re-
sponse time for applications such as optical Gbit/s com-
munication links and laser range ﬁnding. However their
low sensitivity of typically 0.5 A/W makes signiﬁcant ad-
ditional ampliﬁcation necessary, which would lead to ad-
ditional noise and further limit the bandwidth. Avalanche
photodiodes (APDs) provide greater sensitivity (102 A/W)
and are also available with 1 ns response times.
