### Experimental Setup and Results

The analysis was conducted on a PC equipped with a Pentium 4 CPU (3.6 GHz) and 2 Gigabytes of RAM. The results are summarized in Table 1. Waler identified 29 previously-unknown vulnerabilities in four real-world applications and 18 previously-unknown vulnerabilities in eight Jebbo applications, while generating a low number of false positives.

### Vulnerability Analysis

#### Easy JSP Forum
The Easy JSP Forum application, a community forum written in JSP, was found to have a vulnerability where any authenticated user can edit or delete any post. This is due to the lack of access control checks when handling delete or edit requests. If a user forges a request with a valid post ID, they can modify or delete posts regardless of their privileges.

#### GIMS
The Global Internship Management System (GIMS) web application, a human resource management software, was found to have multiple pages accessible to unauthenticated users. Specifically, 14 servlets can be accessed without logging in, and nine administrative pages lack role-based access control checks. These issues arise from missing return statements and insufficient role verification.

#### JaCoB
JaCoB, a community message board, did not yield any vulnerabilities or false alerts using Waler. However, manual analysis revealed two security flaws: passwords are ignored during registration and login, and private user information is publicly available. These issues cannot be detected by Waler as they do not violate the inferred program specification.

#### JspCart
JspCart, an online store, has several administrative pages that can be accessed by unauthorized users. Four out of 45 pages lack the necessary checks for administrative privileges, allowing regular users to modify settings. Additionally, a logic vulnerability allows authenticated users to edit another user's personal information by submitting a valid email address.

#### Jebbo
Eight Jebbo applications, developed by senior-level undergraduate students, were analyzed. Six out of eight applications contained one or more logic flaws, such as allowing unauthenticated users to post messages and lacking authorization checks for message ratings. Common issues included missing return statements and failure to consider all possible user paths. These findings highlight the prevalence of logic flaws even in simple web applications.

### Discussion

Waler generated a low number of false positives, with most alerts representing true weaknesses in the code. False negatives were also analyzed, and it was found that Waler missed some vulnerabilities that are out of its current scope, such as those in JaCoB. The main reason for false negatives is the incomplete modeling of application features, particularly in handling non-if-statement checks like database queries and regular expressions. Future work will focus on improving the precision of these constructs.
