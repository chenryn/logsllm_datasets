I have set up parameterized routing in conjunction with shallow routing in our
project as per
https://github.com/zeit/next.js/blob/master/examples/parameterized-routing and
https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/master/examples/with-shallow-routing.
The router appears to be replacing history state instead of pushing history
state if I push a different parameterized route for the same pathname. This
results in pushing parametrized routes to appear to work until the user
attempts to use the browser's back button and it skips over all state changes.
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
User follows a link to /example.  
Router.push is called with the route /example and asPath /example/test1 and
the shallow option.  
Router.push is called with the route /example and asPath /example/test2 and
the shallow option.  
User his the back button and the URL is set to /example/test1.
## Current Behavior
User follows a link to /example.  
Router.push is called with the route /example and asPath /example/test1 and
the shallow option.  
Router.push is called with the route /example and asPath /example/test2 and
the shallow option.  
User his the back button and the URL is set to /example.
