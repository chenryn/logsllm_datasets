Obtain an SSL certificate First, you need to obtain an SSL certificate from an authorized SSL certificate authority (CA). These certificates usually require you to purchase them, but there are also some free options available, such as Let's Encrypt. Depending on the certificate authority you choose, the steps to obtain a certificate may vary. 2. Install the SSL certificate After obtaining the SSL certificate, please install it on the Windows server. Right-click on Server Certificates in the IIS console and select Import. Then follow the instructions of the wizard. 3. Configure the IIS site Next, you need to configure the IIS site to use the HTTPS protocol. In IIS Manager, select the site you want to configure, then click Edit Site > Bindings in the Actions menu. Select the "https" protocol and choose the SSL certificate to use. 4. Configure the firewall Finally, you need to configure the firewall to allow HTTPS traffic through. Depending on the firewall software you use, the exact steps will vary.
