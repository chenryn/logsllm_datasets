tances. The GNP data set is somewhat atypical, however, in
that the predicted distance matrix has many more columns
(869) than rows (4). Figure 6(b) and 6(c) depict the CDF
of prediction errors over NLANR and P2PSim data sets,
which are more typical. In both cases, IDES has the best
prediction accuracy. On the NLANR data set, IDES yields
better results than GNP and ICS: the median relative error
of IDES using SVD is only 0.03. Its 90 percentile relative
error is about 0.23. The accuracy is worse for all three sys-
tems in P2PSim data set than in NLANR data set. However,
IDES (with either SVD or NMF) is still the most accurate
system among the three. The better prediction results on
the NLANR data set may be due to the fact that 90% of
the hosts in NLANR are in North America and the net-
work distances, computed from minimum RTT over a day,
are not a(cid:11)ected much by queueing delays and route con-
gestion. These properties make the data set more uniform,
and therefore, more easily modeled by a low dimensional
representation.
6.2 Scalability and robustness
In the previous subsection, we showed that IDES can
accurately model the network distances in low dimensions
d (cid:20) 10, which is fundamental to make the system scale
to large-scale networks.
In this subsection, we study the
impact of partially observed landmarks on the accuracy of
IDES. Measuring the distances to only a subset of landmark
nodes reduces the overall load and allows the system to sup-
port more ordinary hosts concurrently.
It also makes the
system robust to partial landmark failures.
We simulated partially observed landmark scenarios in
IDES using SVD to model partial distance matrices from
the NLANR and P2PSim data sets. For each data set, we
experimented with two settings: 20 random landmarks and
50 random landmarks. The simulation results are shown in
Figure 7. The x-axis indicates the fraction of unobserved

landmarks. The unobserved landmarks for each ordinary
host were independently generated at random. When the
number of landmarks is less than twice the model dimen-
sionality d, the accuracy appears sensitive to the fraction
of unobserved landmarks. However, as the number of land-
marks increases, the system tolerates more failure: for ex-
ample, not observing 40% of the landmarks has little impact
on the system accuracy when 50 landmarks are used in the
test.
7. SUMMARY
In this paper, we have presented a model based on matrix
factorization for predicting network distances between arbi-
trary Internet hosts. Our model imposes fewer constraints
on network distances than models based on low dimensional
embeddings; in particular, it can represent distances that
violate the triangle inequality, as well as asymmetric net-
work distances. Such a model is more suitable for modeling
the topology and complex routing policies on the Internet.
Based on this model, we proposed the IDES system and two
learning algorithms, SVD and NMF, for factoring matrices
of network distances between arbitrary Internet hosts. Sim-
ulations on real world data sets have shown that IDES is
computationally e(cid:14)cient, scalable to large-scale networks,
more accurate than previous models, and resilient to tem-
porary landmark failures.
