## ARP - Background
- **Purpose:** Networked systems need a method to identify the Layer 2 (MAC) address of peers on the same network segment based on their IP addresses.
- **Protocol:** Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
  - **Functionality:** ARP allows a system to dynamically determine the MAC address of a networked peer via its IP address.
  - **Process:**
    - The system sends an ARP REQUEST packet to the network broadcast, asking for the MAC address of a specific IP (e.g., "Who has 192.168.1.100?").
    - The host with the matching IP responds with an ARP RESPONSE packet, providing its MAC address (e.g., "192.168.1.100 is at 00:DF:1A:9C:A3:78").
    - To reduce the number of transactions, hosts maintain an "ARP cache" of recently resolved MAC/IP pairs.

## ARP Packet Structure
- **Anatomy of an ARP Packet:**
  - **Ethernet Frame Layout:**
    - Destination MAC Address
    - Source MAC Address
    - Ether Type (ARP)
  - **ARP Packet Layout:**
    - Hardware Type (e.g., Ethernet)
    - Protocol Type (e.g., IP)
    - Hardware Address Length
    - Protocol Address Length
    - Opcode (Request or Reply)
    - Sender Hardware Address (SHA)
    - Sender Protocol Address (SPA)
    - Target Hardware Address (THA)
    - Target Protocol Address (TPA)

## ARP Cache Poisoning
- **Vulnerability:**
  - ARP is unauthenticated, so the first response to an ARP request is accepted.
  - ARP caches can be updated even if no request was sent, depending on the OS.
- **Exploitation:**
  - Attackers send forged ARP REPLY packets to update the victim's ARP cache.
- **Consequences:**
  - **Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM):** The attacker can intercept all communication between the victim and the gateway.
  - **Denial of Service (DoS):** The attacker can provide a non-existent MAC address, preventing the victim from communicating with the gateway.

## CAM Table Overflow
- **Switch Behavior:**
  - Unlike hubs, switches maintain a Content-Addressable Memory (CAM) table to map MAC addresses to switch ports.
  - When the CAM table is full, the switch may start forwarding all traffic to all ports, behaving like a hub.
- **Attack:**
  - The attacker floods the network with thousands of bogus MAC addresses, filling the CAM table.
- **Consequences:**
  - The switch forwards all traffic to all ports, allowing the attacker to eavesdrop on all network traffic.

## Weaknesses and Mitigations
- **ARP Cache Poisoning:**
  - Some operating systems do not update the ARP cache unless they have sent an ARP REQUEST.
  - Tools can sniff the network for ARP REQUESTs and respond with forged REPLYs.
- **CAM Table Overflow:**
  - Requires many spoofed ARPs, making it noisy and identifiable.
  - Technologies like Cisco’s port security can limit the number of MAC addresses per port, mitigating the risk.

## Arpcraft Tool
- **Description:** Arpcraft is a tool designed to test different ARP conditions.
- **Usage:**
  ```sh
  ~$ ./arpcraft [options]
  Options:
  -i <interface>            Interface to send on
  -sha <source_mac>         Source Hardware Address
  -spa <source_ip>          Source Protocol Address
  -tha <target_mac>         Target Hardware Address
  -tpa <target_ip>          Target Protocol Address
  -o <opcode>               Opcode (request or reply)
  -esrc <eth_src_mac>       Source MAC for Ethernet Frame
  -edst <eth_dst_mac>       Destination MAC for Ethernet Frame
  -h                        This Help Message
  -interval <seconds>       How often to send ARP (default: 5 seconds)
  -c <count>                Number of packets to send (default: unlimited)
  ```

- **Examples:**
  - Example usage and configurations will be provided to demonstrate the tool's capabilities.
