User: I have developed a python application with 64-bit Windows 8 (the non metro version which looks like Windows 7 interface). I want to distribute it to all version of 64-bit Windows such as Windows XP, Windows 7 and etc. Is it possible for program developed with python to do that? Also, can the software run on 32-bit Windows os as well?
Assistant: If you have not used any 64 bit specific items the your code should run fine on all versions of windows from source code with a minimum installation of python and the dependencies.
