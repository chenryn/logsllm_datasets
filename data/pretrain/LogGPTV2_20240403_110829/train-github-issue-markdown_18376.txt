  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
Dialog will scroll its own content when I make a scroll gesture on the phone
## Current Behavior
Once I open a second fullscreen modal (which is opened previously by another
fullscreen modal), the scroll won't work as expected, since it will scroll
contents that are not visible (the Modal behind)
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
https://codesandbox.io/s/pkjk07o8o0
  * Open the link on iOS
  * Go to the second Dialog
  * Scroll to the very end, scroll two time more while at the end
  * Once at the end of the modal, scroll to the top
  * Scroll will start to feel weird.  
Note: it seems that this is happening when you scroll tapping on a input, not
100% sure.
## Context
I'm trying to go thru a list of Cards on a Dialog, click on a specific one so
it will open a edit Modal, trying to add data to the fields on the 2nd modal
will feel weird when I try to scroll.
