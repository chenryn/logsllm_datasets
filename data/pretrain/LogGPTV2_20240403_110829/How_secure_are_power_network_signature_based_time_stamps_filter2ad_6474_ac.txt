the fundamental frequency of 60Hz). In this case, it is rea-
sonable for an adversary to focus on tackling this frequency
as well. However, due to the non-linear behavior of electri-
cal circuits, the ENF signal is often present not only at the
fundamental frequency, but also at the harmonic frequen-
cies (120Hz, 180Hz, etc) [1]. As such, in order to detect

anti-forensic operations, the forensic analyst can perform
ENF extraction at more than one frequency, and examine
the consistency of multiple ENF estimates. To illustrate
this idea, we extract ENF signals from an audio signal at
60Hz and 180Hz, respectively, and the results are shown in
Fig. 8. Note that these two signals have been normalized
with respect to their average values. It can be seen that the
two extracted ENF signals highly overlap with each other,
and their normalized correlation is 0.66. This is signiﬁcantly
higher than the average normalized correlation value of 0.02
when the 60Hz and 180Hz ENF signals are extracted from
two diﬀerent audio signals, respectively. An issue with this
detection method is that the magnitude of ENF signal at
higher harmonic frequencies is usually lower, and the host
audio signal may have higher magnitude at these frequen-
cies. Hence, the ENF extraction quality is lower at these
harmonic frequencies, and it is likely that no ENF signals
can be extracted for reliable consistency check.
4.3 Spectrogram Consistency Check
As an adversary performs the anti-forensic operations pro-
posed in Section 3, the resulting narrowband often exhibits
some kind of inconsistency with the signal outside the nar-
rowband, especially the abrupt boundaries that are easily
noticeable around 120Hz. Mathematically, this means the
value of PXI,o(i) is small, which serves as a strong indicator
of the existence of anti-forensics. As an example, consider
an adversary that alters the ENF at 120Hz. A typical result-

ing spectrogram is shown in Fig. 9, where discontinuity at
the narrowband boundaries centered at 120Hz can be clearly
noticed. Such inconsistency occurs if the host audio and the
alien audio signal exhibit strong but unsynchronized tempo-
ral variations.
Although the spectrogram consistency check is powerful,
automating this check is non-trivial as in reality, a forensic
analyst has no a priori knowledge about the narrowband
range.
In order to detect the boundary discontinuity the
analyst has to scan the entire frequency range at a ﬁne res-
olution, which demands a high computational complexity.
4.4 Reference-based Detection
In Section 4.1, we have seen conditions under which anti-
forensic operations can be detected. In particular, a forged
and an unforged audio signal can be distinguished if their
narrowband characteristics are available. Here we consider
a special setting called reference-based anti-forensics detec-
tion, in which it is assumed that when a query signal is
present whose ENF signal remains to be authenticated, a
reference signal with similar ENF sensing conditions is also
accessible. Note that this is in contrast to the blind detection
method that we have discussed previously. The reference-
based setting is possible in many practical scenarios. For
example, if the adversary presents multiple pieces of audio
recordings among which some have forged ENF signals, then
the remaining unforged audio recordings can serve as the ref-
erence signals. As another example, consider an audio that
is used as forensic evidence whose authenticity remains to be

determined. A forensic analyst can replicate the recording
environment so that the ENF sensing conditions are repli-
cated as well. The reference-based anti-forensics detection
can be seen as a resource-augmented detection, and as we
know, this has not been exploited previously.
In the reference-based anti-forensics detection setting, since
the reference signal contains an authentic ENF signal, in-
formation about PXI,o(i) can be learnt from the statistics
of the reference signal. Speciﬁcally, by writing PXI,o(i) =
P (o|i,X)
PXI (i)
P (o|X) , one can detect an anti-forensic operation
upon a query audio signal if it leads to a low PXI (i). To ver-
ify this idea, we collect two audio signals recorded on two dif-
ferent days (10 January and 14 January 2012, respectively).
The two audio clips were made by playing online streaming
via the same speaker and recording using the same micro-
phone. The placement of the microphone and the speaker
volume, however, are not exactly the same on the two days.
For a given audio ﬁle whose narrowband surrounding 60Hz is
denoted by B(n), we divide B(n) into segments of a 5-second
duration, and calculate sample statistics for each segment.
In particular, we examine the variance that measures how
each sample spreads out from the average value, and the kur-
tosis that measures the “peakedness” of each sample, deﬁned
as
Var(B) =E [(B(n) − ¯B)

signal at higher frequencies, which usually has richer con-
tent. Second, from a forensic analyst’s point of view, as more
ENF frequencies are aﬀected, more traces will be left that
may be exploited by the reference-based anti-forensics detec-
tion. Nevertheless, as discussed in Section 4.2, ENF signals
generally can only be extracted reliably at lower harmonic
frequencies. Around these frequencies, host signal quality
degradation is barely noticeable according to our subjective
perceptual evaluation. As such, the two issues above are not
serious in practice.
5.1 Envelope Adjustment
Recall that the anti-forensic operations proposed in Sec-
tion 3 may result in inconsistency on the spectrogram. This
is because the embedded narrowband may have diﬀerent
temporal magnitude variations. To address this issue, an
adversary can try to adjust the envelope of the narrowband,
so that the adjusted narrowband has similar temporal vari-
ation as the native narrowband. Such adjustment can be
done by means of the Hilbert Transform [5]. Speciﬁcally,
the Hilbert Transform of a real-valued narrowband signal in
the form of
b(t) =A (t) sin(2πfct + φ)
is given by
H{b(t)} = b(t) + jA(t) sin
2πfct + φ +
