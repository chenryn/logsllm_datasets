User: According to the documentation from python.org, python 3.2 install on mac os requires an upgrade to tcl/tk 8.5.9 (for use of IDLE). In my haste, I have done both. Now my friend told me that python 3 is not recommended yet because only the built-ins and a few modules have been released for 3. The stable one so far is 2.7 (especially if one wants to make extensive use of a variety of modules). My machine has both 2.6.1 and 3.2 (because some OS services make use of 2.6.1 that comes as default with the OS).
1. How do i remove 3.2 completely to avoid any compatibility issues?
tcl/tk 8.5.9 was also installed and this is not the default. There was no verbose mode during installation, so I don't know whether it replaced the default one. If it did how bad can it be for the OS? and hence
2. If the above is really bad, how do i downgrade to the old version of tcl/tk?
In short, how do i bring my machine back to its original state? If anyone knows all the paths to the directories and files I can do it manually.
Thanks
Assistant: I did the same (3.2 on a mac 10.6) and:
-Moved both the Python 3.2 folder and the ActiveState ActiveTcl folder from the Applications Folder to the Trash.
-Moved the Python.framework folder from the Library/Frameworks folder to the Trash.
Running System profiler shows only the 2.6 version of Python.
