User: I want to use disutils to make a .msi for my python library. Before installation, the user can choose the destination path of the installation. Depending on this path, I want to generate a .pth file that will contain the chosen path. For this to be possible I need to run a post-installation script that will place the .pth in the correct place.
My question is: Is there a way of getting that installation path that was selected by the user, during run-time?
Assistant: Can’t you use a relative path in the .pth file?  Or avoid using a .pth file at all?  (They’re used for module collections that pre-date packages in Python, or horrible import hacks.)
