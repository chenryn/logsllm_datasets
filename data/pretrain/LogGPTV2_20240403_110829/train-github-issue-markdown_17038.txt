I did not really realize that, but the recent change in multi-output behavior
means that there are deprecation warnings for each call to `score` with multi-
output data:
> DeprecationWarning: Default 'multioutput' behavior now corresponds to
> 'variance_weighted' value, it will be changed to 'uniform_average' in 0.18.
Is that desired? Is there a way around it?  
And do we want to catch them in the tests?  
Currently the test output is HUGE.
