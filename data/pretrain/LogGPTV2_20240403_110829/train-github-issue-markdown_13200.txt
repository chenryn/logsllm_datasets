Similar to #7571, a change in the Quartz 1.6 API has made some of the nice
Spring-related features incompatible with that release. Namely, the changes
related to the following issue have made SimpleTriggerBean and CronTriggerBean
useless with Quartz 1.6
http://jira.opensymphony.com/browse/QUARTZ-417
This change resulted in
org.quartz.impl.jdbcjobstore.JobStoreSupport#storeTrigger using '==' rather
than instanceof to determine if the trigger is a SimpleTrigger or CronTrigger.
Ostensibly, this is to allow custom triggers to extend either of these
classes, but it prevents Spring from providing extended configuration
functionality through subclassing. Personally, I think a better solution on
Quartz's part would have been to introduce a marker interface like
CustomTrigger, but I'm not sure how receptive the Quartz team will be to
change this yet again to accomodate Spring code.
My workaround has been to turn SimpleTriggerBean and CronTriggerBean into
FactoryBeans. This is much clunkier, as it requires a lot more copying of
data, but it gets the job done and is backwards-compatible.
