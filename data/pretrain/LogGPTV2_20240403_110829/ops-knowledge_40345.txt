User: I know we cant change the parent of an entity that is stored , but can we change the parent of the entity that is not stored? For example i am declaring a model as 
    my_model = MyModel(parent = ParentModel1.key)
but after some checks i may have to change the parent of my_model (i have not run my_model.put() ) to ParentModel2. How can i do this ?
Assistant: You still can't do it. You should probably delay instantiation of the MyModel object until you know its parent. Perhaps you could collect the attributes in a dictionary, then when it comes to instantiation you can do my_instance = MyModel(parent=parent_instance, **kwargs).
