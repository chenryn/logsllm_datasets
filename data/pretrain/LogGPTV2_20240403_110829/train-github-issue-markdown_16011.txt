# Steps to Reproduce
I encountered this issue when doing the following
  * I have a task definition like this
    @shared_task
    def send_loan_approval_email(loan_id):
        from loans.models import Loan
        from templated_email import get_templated_mail
        loan = Loan.objects.get(pk=loan_id)
        # some code here
        email_borrower.send()
        email_guarantor.send()
    @shared_task
    def send_loan_approval_sms(loan_id):
        from loans.models import Loan
        from app.services import sms_service
        loan = Loan.objects.get(pk=loan_id)
        log.info(f"Running {__name__} task")
        sms_service.send(
          # some code here
        )
  * I have code invocation here
    class Loan:
        def approve(self, by=None):
            send_loan_approval_sms.delay(self.id)
            send_loan_approval_email.delay(self.id)
  * When I run `approve()` somehow the sms run but the email doesn't, but sometime it works too, sms consistently running, but the email sometime work sometime broken. Any idea why?
