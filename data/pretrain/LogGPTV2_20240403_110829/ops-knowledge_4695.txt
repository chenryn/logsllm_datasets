User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题MS Clear Screen Saver doesn't work I have a problem with really exotic thing - Microsoft Clear Screen Saver.
As it's name suggests, it's a screen saver, that's transparent (MS posted it as a part of W2k Resource Kit). When you move the mouse/hit a key, the "lock" dialog appears.
I would like to use this to view servers desktops without need to log in.

I tested it on my XP's, and it works flawlessy.
But on W2K3 servers it doesn't work. After the screensaver timeout, the error message is displayed:

"The Clear Screen Saver cannot display the user desktop after the workstation has been locked"

Assistant: That would be security built into Server 2003. I don't know if you can get around it or not; but keep in mind that anyone could walk up to the server and see what's on the screen. That sounds like a really terrible idea.
