User: How to use Ansible to automate the deployment of a Dockerized application on multiple virtual machines?
Assistant: The following is a basic Ansible playbook to automate the deployment of a Dockerized application on multiple virtual machines: ``` --- - name: Deploy Dockerized Application hosts: servers become: true tasks: - name: Install Docker apt: name: docker.io state: present - name: Clone Repo git: repo: {{ repo_url }} dest: /home/user/repo - name: Build Docker Image command: docker build -t {{ image_name }} /home/user/ repo - name: Deploy Docker Containers command: docker run -d -p {{port}}:{{container_port}} {{ image_name }} ``` In the above playbook, the steps are as follows: 1. Install Docker so that the The docker command can be run on the host. 2. Clone the Git repository from which your application's code resides. 3. Build a Docker image, use the Dockerfile to build the project, and package it into a docker image. 4. Deploy the Docker container, run the image as a container on the specified port, and provide services at any time. You can customize the deployment process by modifying the variables in the above playbook to simultaneously deploy the application on multiple virtual machines. For example, you can set the name or IP address of the virtual machine to be deployed through the hosts field, and you can set different variables for each virtual machine so that the application can be deployed in different environments.
