**ATT&CK ID:** S0484  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Carberp

Carberp employs the technique of queuing an Asynchronous Procedure Call (APC) to the `explorer.exe` process by invoking the `ZwQueueApcThread` function.[7]

This method allows Carberp to execute its malicious code in the context of the `explorer.exe` process, thereby evading detection and maintaining persistence.
