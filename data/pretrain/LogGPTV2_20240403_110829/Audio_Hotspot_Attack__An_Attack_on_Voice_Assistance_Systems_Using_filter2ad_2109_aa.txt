Abstract—We propose a novel attack, called an “Audio Hotspot Attack,” which performs an inaudible malicious voice command attack,
by targeting voice assistance systems, e.g., smart speakers or in-car navigation systems. The key idea of the approach is to leverage
directional sound beams generated from parametric loudspeakers, which emit amplitude-modulated ultrasounds that will be
self-demodulated in the air. Our work goes beyond the previous studies of inaudible voice command attack in the following three
aspects: (1) the attack can succeed on a long distance (3.5 meters in a small room, and 12 meters in a long hallway), (2) it can control
the spot of the audible area by using two directional sound beams, which consist of a carrier wave and a sideband wave, and (3) the
proposed attack leverages a physical phenomenon i.e.,non-linearity in the air, to attack voice assistance systems. To evaluate the
feasibility of the attack, we performed extensive in-lab experiments and a user study involving 20 participants. The results
demonstrated that the attack was feasible in a real-world setting. We discussed the extent of the threat, as well as the possible
countermeasures against the attack.

1 INTRODUCTION
V OICE assistance systems, such as Siri [2], Google Assis-
tant [3], and Amazon Alexa [4] have become increas-
ingly popular as a means to establish user-friendly human–
computer interactions. Voice assistance systems are now
supported on various devices, e.g., smartphones/tablets,
smart speakers, automobiles, smart homes, smart watches,
smart TVs, media boxes, and laptops/desktops. Voice assis-
tance systems can integrate speech recognition to demon-
strate various skills such as providing recommendations
to restaurants, reading out schedules, and even purchasing
products when an appropriate voice command is given.
While these voice assistance systems have clear beneﬁts
in daily life activities, they also raise intrinsic security and
privacy concerns. One of the most serious security issues
related to the use of voice assistance systems is the lack
of a rigorous mechanism to guarantee the trustworthiness
of the voice source that operates the system. As previous
studies have demonstrated [5], [6], voice assistance systems
are vulnerable to “inaudible voice command attacks.” Here,
an attacker can issue voice commands to a voice assistance
device unbeknownst to the device owner. For instance, if an
attacker generates an inaudible voice command that adjusts
the volume of the music player set in a car to its maximum,
the driver may be surprised or momentarily distracted, thus
increasing the likelihood of an accident. Recent studies have
leveraged existing vulnerabilities of the device or software.
In Ref. [6], the authors found that ultrasound can be used
to convey inaudible voice command attacks, by using the

this attack, attackers attempt to input directional sound to
voice assistance systems as shown in Figure 1. Directional
sound is generated by using the nonlinearity of ultrasonic
waves in the air. When the modulated ultrasound passes
through the air, which acts as a nonlinear medium, the
signal is demodulated into audible sound even if a de-
modulation circuit is not prepared. It is well known that
the demodulated sound signals exhibit higher directivity
than those emitted from a normal loudspeaker [7], [8]. To
generate directional sound, we make use of a parametric
loudspeaker, which composes of an array of ultrasound
transducers.
The attack proposed in this paper is different from
previously proposed attacks in that it leverages physical
phenomena that cannot be modiﬁed or eliminated. As the
previous attacks use vulnerabilities associated with hard-
ware or software, they can be ﬁxed, e.g., by modifying the
machine learning algorithm or eliminating the nonlinearity
of the microphone. In contrast, the nonlinearity of air is a
natural phenomenon, and it is impossible to take measures
against it using conventional approaches.
Furthermore, the adoption of parametric loudspeakers
enables an attacker to perform a unique form of the attack,
called a cross attack. As shown at the bottom of Figure 1,
an attacker sets two parametric loudspeakers in different
places and transmits directional sound beams to the target
voice assistance device. The two sound beams are inaudi-
ble because each sound beam consists of a carrier wave
or sideband wave with ultrasound frequency. The sound
beams become audible where the two beams cross at a point;
i.e., they become an AM sound wave. An attacker can take
control of the cross point by adjusting the sources of the two
sound beams.
To evaluate the feasibility of the attack, we pose the
following research questions:
RQ1:
Is the Audio Hotspot Attack feasible at long distance with
off-the-shelf voice assistant devices?
RQ2: Does the Audio Hotspot Attack succeed in noisy practical
RQ3:
environments?
Is the attack stealthy for nearby people and unrecognizable
for them?
We aim to answer these questions through extensive exper-
iments and user studies involving 20 participants.
The contributions of this work can be summarized as
follows:
• We proposed a novel inaudible voice command at-
tack that targets voice assistance systems, leveraging
the directional sound beams to create a “hotspot” of
the attack success area (Section 3).
• We carefully designed and controlled our experi-
ments. We used a room and equipment dedicated
to acoustic experiments (Section 4).
• We demonstrated that the attack could succeed at
a long distance. We discovered that the attacks were
tolerant of environmental noise. For both devices, the
attack success rate remained high at a noise sound
pressure level. We showed that the cross attack was
also feasible (Section 5).

• Through the extensive user studies, we demon-
strated that people could not recognize the attacker’s
voice (Section 6).
• We discussed potential threats that may arise in
the future as well as the possible countermeasures
against the attack (Section 7).
To the best of our knowledge, this work is the ﬁrst to
make use of directional sound beams as a means of attacking
voice-controlled systems. This perspective sheds new light
on security and privacy issues for systems that make use of
sound.
2 BACKGROUND
In this section, we describe the three key technologies that
constitute our attack: the voice assistance system, parametric
loudspeakers, and voice presentation attack.
2.1 Voice Assistance Systems
Currently, a typical voice assistance system has two action
phases for device operation: activation and recognition. In
the ﬁrst phase, a user speaks a speciﬁc wake-up word to
activate the system, e.g., “OK Google” for Google Assistant,
“Alexa” for Amazon Alexa, and “Hey Siri” for Apple Siri.
In the second phase, a user transmits a voice command to
the system. The system applies speech recognition to the
received voice data and executes a command extracted from
this data. The available voice commands include common
operations such as turning on a light, answering questions,
reading the news, or privacy-sensitive operations that access
personal resources such as reading out schedules, sending a
text message, making a phone call, or purchasing a product.
Many of the smart speakers today offer speaker recogni-
tion functionality so that each person in the household can
enjoy the device in a customizable way. For instance, each
person using the Amazon Echo can link their own Amazon
account to the device. The device identiﬁes each person by
leveraging voiceprints to employ biometric veriﬁcation. To
be enrolled in the device’s speaker recognition, an owner
of the device ﬁrst needs to register his or her voiceprint,
typically by saying a wake-up word multiple times. By
comparing the wake-up word against a previously created
voiceprint, the voice assistance system veriﬁes a person’s
identity. Although a third person who is not registered
can still attempt to use the device, his or her usage will
be limited to non-personalized common services such as
reading news or weather forecasts.
As we will discuss in Section 3, speaker recognition
technology is vulnerable to voice presentation attacks [9].
These attacks attempt to bypass voice authentication using
voice replay/synthesis/conversion technique fraudulently
(See Section 2.3).
2.2 Mechanism of parametric loudspeakers
A parametric loudspeaker can generate directional sound
using ultrasound. It consists of an array of many ultrasound
transducers installed in parallel [10]. Figure 2 presents a
parametric loudspeaker used throughout the experiments.

Fig. 2. A parametric loudspeaker. This loudspeaker can generate direc-
tional sound. It consists of an array of ultrasonic-emitting loudspeakers
arranged in a grid. A parametric loudspeaker emits sounds on a narrow
spatial range containing a targeted device.
Each ultrasonic transducer transmits ultrasound that modu-
lates the original sound wave with amplitude modulation
(AM). The generated ultrasound is self-demodulated in
the air and becomes audible even if we do not prepare a
demodulation circuit (called self-demodulation [7]). Next,
we present the self-demodulation mechanism, also known
as the parametric phenomenon.
Let p = p(x, t) be the sound pressure caused by sound
wave originating from a parametric loudspeaker, where x
is the distance from the loudspeaker and t is time. As the
sound wave is AM-modulated, it has three major frequen-
cies, i.e., carrier frequency, fc, and adjacent sideband, fs−,
fs+ where fs− = fc − fm, fs+ = fc + fm. fm represents the
frequency of the sound wave to be injected by an attacker.
We focus on lower sideband to simplify. Primary wave p is
expressed as
p = pc sin (2πfct(cid:48)) + ps− sin(cid:0)2πfs− t(cid:48)(cid:1)
(1)
pc and ps− are the amplitudes of the carrier wave and the
sideband wave, respectively. where t(cid:48) = t−x/c0 is a retarded
time; the retarded time is the time when the sound wave
began to propagate from the sound source.
Burger’s equation is one of the ﬂuid models that rep-
resents the nonlinear dynamics of sound waves [11]. The
dynamics of ultrasound generated from an array of trans-
ducers can be modeled with Burger’s equation:
∂p
∂x

ρ0c3
0
∂
∂t(cid:48) p2 +
δ
2c3
0
∂2p
∂t(cid:48)2 ,
(2)
where β is the coefﬁcient of nonlinearity, ρ0 is the density
of air, and c0 is the sound speed. The ﬁrst term on the right
side has nonlinearity. By substituting Eq. 1 into p, we have
∂
∂t(cid:48) p2 =
c sin2(2πfct(cid:48)) + p2
∂
∂t(cid:48) [p2
+2pcps− sin(2πfct(cid:48)) sin(2πfs− t(cid:48))],
s− sin2(2πfs− t(cid:48))
(3)
For simplicity, we calculate only the third term of Eq. 3,
from which, we can derive fm. 1
∂
∂t(cid:48) (2pcps− sin(2πfct(cid:48)) sin(2πfs− t(cid:48)))
= 2[2πfs− pcps− sin(2πfct(cid:48)) cos(2πfs− t(cid:48))
+2πfcpcps− cos(2πfct(cid:48)) sin(2πfs− t(cid:48))],
= −2πpcps−[(fc + fs− ) sin(2π(fc + fs− )t(cid:48))
+(fc − fs−) sin(2π(fc − fs− )t(cid:48)),
= −2πpcps−[(fc + fs− ) sin(2π(fc + fs− )t(cid:48))
+fm sin(2πfmt(cid:48))],

(4)
Eq. 4 contains two terms. The ﬁrst term, which contains
sin(2π(fc+fs−)t(cid:48)), will be removed by low–pass ﬁlter. Thus,
remaining term is a sine function with the frequency of the
original modulation wave, fm. By substituting Eq. 4 into
Eq. 2, we derive that ∂p/∂x contain the following term,
2βπpcps− fm
ρ0c0
3
sin(2πfmt(cid:48))
(5)
By integrating the term with respect to x, we derive that p
contains the following term
2βπpcps− fm
ρ0c0
3
x sin(2πfmt(cid:48))
(6)
which indicates that the observed sound pressure includes
the component of the original modulation wave. This is
how the nonlinearity of the air demodulates the modulated
sound wave.
Figure 3 presents an overview of the parametric phe-
nomenon. After emitted from a parametric loudspeaker, the
sound pressure of the audible sound wave, fm, gradually
increases. Although both the audible sound wave and in-
audible ultrasound wave are to be attenuated over time,
inaudible ultrasound waves attenuate faster due to the fact
that in the air, high frequency sound wave attenuates faster
compared to low frequency sound waves. The parametric
phenomenon is observed only along the direction in which
the ultrasound was emitted because the waves have the
same phase along the path.
Finally, we show the intuitive explanation of the forma-
tion of directional sound beam. The demodulated sound
traveling in the forward direction is ampliﬁed because the
phase is aligned. On the other hand, sound traveling in a
direction other than the forward direction is not ampliﬁed
because the phase is not aligned. The mathematical descrip-
tion of the theory can be found in Refs [7], [8].
2.3 Voice Presentation Attack
In the ISO/IEC standard, presentation attacks are deﬁned
as ”presentation to the biometric data capture subsystem
with the goal of interfering with the operation of the bio-
metric system. [12]” There have been several approaches
for evading speaker recognition or, more broadly, voice au-
thentication. These attacks are known as voice presentation
attacks [9]. Well-known voice presentation attacks include
1. If we compute the partial differentiation of the ﬁrst and second
terms in a way like Eq 4, sine functions with the frequencies of 2fs− ,
2fc, and so on, appear. Because these frequencies are not associated
with fm and will be removed by the low–pass ﬁlter on the microphone,
all these sine functions can be omitted in the remaining calculation.

and fs− is a sideband frequency, where fs− = fc − fm and fm
represents a frequency of the sound wave to be injected by an attacker.
In a short distance, the sound pressure of the demodulated sound, fm
will increase in proportion to the distance, x, following Eq. 6. However,
due to the attenuation of the ultrasonic wave, the sound pressure of the
demodulated sound will decrease over a long distance.
the replay attack [13], [14], speech synthesis attack [13], and
voice conversion attack [15].
During a replay attack, an attacker pre-records the
speech of the victim in advance. The attacker then replays
the recorded speech to the target device. Distinguishing be-
tween genuine and replayed speech from the time-domain
and spectrum-domain representations of speech data is dif-
ﬁcult task [16]. The drawback of a replay attack is that an
