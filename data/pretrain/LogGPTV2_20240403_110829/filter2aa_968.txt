5.  Questions & Answers
What is CISA?
• CISA is the “Nation’s Risk 
Advisor”
• Not a Cyber Regulator
• Not a Law Enforcement 
Agency
• Our stakeholders include 
US Federal Government 
agencies and US Critical 
Infrastructure
The #1 Threat To Critical Infrastructure
… is Ransomware.
• Ransomware is intentionally disruptive.
• Recovery to full operations can take weeks (whether the 
victim pays the ransom or not).
• Recent severe incidents have affected the energy sector, 
food and agriculture supply chain, and hospital networks.
• Attacks occur daily across all sectors.
Defeating Ransomware Together
CISA works together with its sister agencies and with private 
sector partners to combat the ransomware threat.
• Law Enforcement Agencies and the Treasury Department 
disrupt operations and their payment schemes.
• Defense, Law Enforcement, Diplomatic and Intelligence 
Agencies work to take the fight to the enemy.
• CISA leads the effort to harden targets – making systems 
more secure and resilient.
Global Collaboration 
Critical infrastructure is global and international 
collaboration is key to succeeding against this threat.
• International partnerships have helped alert potential 
victims and minimizing impact.
• Sharing timely alerts and detection methods is critical.
• This is done via various trust communities using different 
channels, from formal Information Sharing and Analysis 
Centers (ISACs) to volunteer groups.
