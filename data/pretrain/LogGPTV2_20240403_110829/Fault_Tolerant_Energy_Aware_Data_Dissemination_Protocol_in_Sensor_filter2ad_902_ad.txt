In  order  to  compare  the  delay  between  SPMS  and 
SPIN  for  a  single  source-destination  pair  in  the  failure 
free  case,  we  take  expressions  (1)  and  (2)  and  plot  the 
ratio  of 
increasing 
transmission  radius  in  Figure  5.  Consider  sample  values 
of Ttx = 0.05, Tproc = 0.02, A:D = 1:30, G = 0.01 and, as 
given by [8], n1 = 45 and ns = 5. These values assume a 
uniform  density  of  nodes  on  the  grid  and  consider  that 
by  increasing  each  power  level,  the  number  of  links 
between two nodes is reduced by one. Then, DelaySPIN :

4.2. Energy Analysis 
Let 
the  energy  expended  per 
transmitted  bit 
corresponding to the different transmission power levels 
be  E1,  E2,  E3,  E4…….  Em,  where  Ei  >  Ei+1. Let Er be  the 
energy required to receive the packet. For simplification 
we can assume that this is equal to Em which is valid for 
many sensor nodes [12]. 
Consider  a  simple  example  with  two  nodes  –  A 
(source)  and  B  (destination)  with  (k-1)  relay  nodes  in 
between.  In  case  of  SPIN  it  does  not  matter  how  many 
relay  nodes  there  are,  since  the  source  always  transmits 
at the maximum power level. In this calculation, we omit 
the  energy  wasted  in  redundant  reception  by  nodes  that 
do  not  wish  to  participate  in  the  protocol.  Since  the 
number  of  uninterested  receivers  is  higher  in  SPIN 
because  of  a  larger  transmission  radius,  the  gain  in 
SPMS will be higher if we take this into account.

5. Experimental Evaluation 
We carried out a simulation based study of SPIN and 
SPMS  to  bring  out  the  difference  in  energy  saving  and 
delay.  In  our  experiments  we  use  a  sensor  field  with 
uniform  density  of  nodes.  This  implies  that  as  the 
number  of  nodes  increases,  the  sensor  field  area 
increases. The input parameters are either taken from the

5.1. All-to-All Communication 
In  the  first  set  of  experiments  we  consider  all-to-all 
communication.  In  this  model  each  node  generates  10 
new  packets  and  every  other  node  in  the  network  is 
interested in receiving each packet. We consider Poisson 
arrivals for the new packets. All-to-all communication is 
simulated  since  it  is  the  most  general  communication 
pattern,  special  cases  of  which  are  given  by  sink  to 
source or source to sink communication. 
5.1.1
Static Failure Free Case  
We  consider  energy  and  delay  metrics  varying  the 
number  of  nodes  in  the  sensor  field.  The  energy  plot  is 
shown  in  Figure  6.  Total  energy  consumption  is 
calculated for the entire network and divided by the total 
number  of  packets.  SPMS  saves  26-43%  of  energy 
compared  to  SPIN.  As  the  number  of  nodes  increases, 
the  number  of  packets  sent  increases.  The  energy 
consumed  curve  for  SPIN  has  a  higher  slope  than  that 
for  SPMS  and  hence  the  difference  increases  with 
increasing sensor field size. 
We  compare  the  effect  of  varying  the  transmission 
radius on energy consumption for both the protocols in  
In 
spite  of 
this,  SPMS 
Figure 7. It is important to consider this metric as the 
nodes  have  the  capability  of  transmitting  to  different 
ranges.  Also,  as  the  transmission  radius  increases,  the 
number of zone neighbors considered in SPMS increases 
and  hence  the  overhead  of  the  Bellman-Ford  algorithm 
increases. 
increasingly 
outperforms  SPIN  as  the  transmission  radius  increases. 
At  low  values  of  the  radius,  the  difference  between 
SPMS and SPIN is not substantial because the zone has 
very few neighbors and mostly one hop away. However, 
as  the  transmission  radius  increases,  the  zone  size 
increases  and  SPMS  uses  longer  multi-hop  routes  to 
reach  the  outlying  nodes  in  the  zone.  We  can  see  from 
Figure  8  that  the  delay  increases  with  the  number  of 
nodes for both SPMS and SPIN but the delay in sending 
packets is much less in SPMS.
