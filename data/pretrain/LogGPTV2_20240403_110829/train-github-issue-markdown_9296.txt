I had some error related to `libexpat-1` so as mentioned in the
https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/README.windows.md file I ran
`make win-extras` and copied the files into `usr/bin` (overwriting existing
files).
After that Julia crashes at startup, without error message beside the default
windows popup.
Copying the dll's one by one, it seems `libstdc++-6.dll` is causing the
problem.
