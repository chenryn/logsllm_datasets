I encountered an issue related to `libexpat-1` while using Julia. According to the instructions in the [README.windows.md](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/README.windows.md) file, I executed the `make win-extras` command and then copied the generated files into the `usr/bin` directory, overwriting the existing files.

After performing these steps, Julia began crashing at startup, with no error message other than the default Windows popup. To identify the source of the problem, I copied the DLLs one by one and determined that `libstdc++-6.dll` is causing the crash.

Here are the details of my Julia setup:
- **Version:** 0.4.0-dev+4843 (2015-05-15 10:33 UTC)
- **Commit:** `888b6b4` (0 days old master)
- **Platform:** x86_64-w64-mingw32

If you have any suggestions on how to resolve this issue, I would greatly appreciate your assistance.
