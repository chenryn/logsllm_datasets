User: How to monitor network connectivity and trigger an alarm notification in time when the network is disconnected?
Assistant: A simple and feasible solution is to use the ping command to detect network connectivity. The specific implementation steps are as follows: 1. Write a script (such as monitor.sh), execute the ping command in a loop, and check the returned result. If the ping is successful, it means that the network connection is normal, and the ping will continue after a period of sleep; if the ping fails, it means that the network is disconnected, and an alarm notification will be triggered immediately. 2. Set a scheduled task, such as executing a script every 5 minutes. You can use tools such as cron to implement the setting of scheduled tasks. 3. The way of alarm notification can choose to send email or SMS. You can use related APIs or third-party services to send alarm notifications. It should be noted that using ping to detect network connectivity has certain limitations, because in some cases, although the ping is successful, the network is actually not smooth. Therefore, other factors, such as network bandwidth and delay, need to be considered comprehensively in practical applications to more accurately evaluate network quality.
