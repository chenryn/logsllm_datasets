User: I can't figure out how to make setup.py add a scrip to the the user's /bin or /usr/bin or whatever.
E.g., I'd like to add a myscript.py to /usr/bin so that the user can call myscript.py from any directory.
Assistant: If you're willing to build and install the entire python package, this is how I would go about it:

Edit the setup() function in setup.py to contain a parameter named scripts and set its argument as the location of the file(s) you wish to run from anywhere. e.g. 

setup(name='myproject',author='',author_email='',scripts=['bin/myscript.py'])

Within the directory that contains setup.py, create a bin directory by typing mkdir bin
Add myscript.py to this newly-created bin directory (and make sure it's executable!)
cd into the directory that contains setup.py again, and install the entire python package by typing python setup.py install
Once the package is installed, you should be able to run myscript.py from anywhere on the system!
