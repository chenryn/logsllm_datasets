receiving systems is irrelevant and no amount of cross-polarization discrimination is reliable. 
Moreover, the out-of-band emission mask applied to unlicensed devices (by revising Section 
10
15.209) must limit power outside the co- and adjacent channels to especially small values.  The
table shows that power over every 6 MHz portion of the TV band should be considerably less 
than 9.5E-7 mW except for the 6 MHz used by the device and the two adjacent channels.

III. 
Sensing 
The sensing of RF fields is an inadequate means for protection of DTV services.  These services 
require protection based on service contours determined in an absolute way, by reference to 
geographic information and precise knowledge of the location of unlicensed devices before they 
transmit.  Sensing, however, is only capable of measuring RF fields in a very localized way, at a 
moment in time, at a particular point among or inside buildings, and at a particular height relative 
to building heights and terrain. 
Since sensing cannot be used to determine where a device is located in reference to contours, it 
could at best be effective for devices whose power is so small as to be safe within a very limited 
area around it.  Moreover, a network of devices is impractical since this same area confines the 
entire network.  In such a small area there may be some assurance that no DTV receivers are able 
to get a picture so that the device could transmit without interrupting DTV service.  However, 
very little confidence can be placed in measurement by a single sensing device of a short 
duration.  According to an analysis of the Canadian Research Center, there is a margin of only 24 
dB between the threshold of feasible sensing technology and the minimum field required by DTV 
receivers.19  Thus, an incorrect clear-to-transmit decision will be made whenever the signal that 
happens to be available to the sensing device is 24 dB less than the field in use by DTV receivers. 
Signal variation of 24 dB is highly likely due solely to the statistics of RF propagation.  Location 
variability in the UHF TV band is in the order of 15 dB, and the motion of vehicles in the vicinity 
and the way mobile devices are held can make another 10 dB difference. The factors just 
19 Sensing Parameters: Estimates and Analysis, Gerald Chouinard, CRC, Canada, found at 
http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dtse/3r_notor.ppt. This paper assumes a sensing level of -116 dBm, and 
that both the TV receive antenna and the IEEE unlicensed fixed device sensing antenna are located at 30 
feet above ground so that there is no height difference between the TV receive antenna and the sensing 
antenna.  The -116 dBm is the same level suggested by the FCC for a 4 Watt TV band device.  Sensing at 
the -116 dBm level, however, is not used by the IEEE to ensure that the unlicensed fixed is located a 
sufficient distance outside a TV station’s co- and adjacent channel contour.

mentioned are just the statistical uncertainties.  In addition there is the “hidden node” problem in 
which an obstacle that is not part of the propagation path for local DTV reception nevertheless 
blocks the path to a sensing device. 
IV.
Conclusions
To ensure that TV band devices provide at least the same level of protection as TV licensees 
receive from other licensed operations, co-channel and adjacent channel operation of such 
devices must be prohibited inside the DTV service contours.  In addition, specific separation or 
“keep away” distances from those contours must be established, and it would be reasonable and 
practical to base these keep-away distances on free space radio path loss calculations and line-of-
sight considerations. 
Revision of §15.209 of FCC Rules for unlicensed TV band devices must require that out-of-band 
noise power over every 6 MHz portion of the TV band be considerably less than 9.5E-7 mW 
except for the 6 MHz used by the device and the two adjacent channels.20  The “white space” in 
the TV band is much more limited than implied by mere consideration of co- and adjacent 
channel interference.  This is because almost any point on the map is covered by one or more 
DTV services that can be desensitized by noise-like emissions to the point of losing picture. 
Finally, sensing is an ineffective method for protecting DTV service from interference, especially 
in the case of personal/portable devices.  The radio fields observed by sensing devices are subject 
to variations considerably larger than the detection window of practical devices. 
20  This presumes that that co- and adjacent channel operation within the TV station contour is prohibited.

1 Introduction 
The Association for Maximum Service Television, Inc. (MSTV) requested laboratory 
evaluation of five ATSC 8-VSB digital television receivers in the presence of 
adjacent/taboo DTV channel interferences.  The receivers were tested in the laboratory of 
the Communications Research Centre Canada to determine their capabilities to receive 
DTV signals in the presence of a single or multiple DTV interferers. These interference 
signals were intended to simulate conditions expected to be found when operating 
unlicensed devices in the TV band pursuant the FCC proposal in Docket 04-168.  The 
tests were carried out in January 2007. 
2 Major findings 
The major findings of the laboratory test can be summarized as:  
•
There can be substantial differences in interference performance of different VSB 
receivers and interference mechanisms, regardless of age and vintage.   
•
Interfering signals on the upper and lower first adjacent channel are the most 
problematic and consistently result in large calculated interference distances “r” at 
which the interfering device can cause a DTV receiver to reach TOV. 
•
In general, interfering signals on the second and third adjacent channels can also 
be problematic and result in calculated interference distances “r” larger than 10 
meters. 
•
Image interference on channels +7, +14 and +15 can also result at significant 
distances under certain circumstances for certain receivers.  
•
Multiple interfering signals reduce the D/U ratios.  The worst case appears to be 
N+x and N+2x.  Degradation of more than 30 dB and more have been measured 
on some receivers.

3 Laboratory Set-up and Test Conditions 
The VSB receivers were tested against DTV interferences.  The tests included 
adjacent/taboo channels interference from N – 15 to N + 15 into DTV. 
3.1 Laboratory Evaluation Set-up 
The laboratory set-up for the evaluation of the VSB receivers is presented in figure 1.  
The set-up is divided in three sections: Transmitter, Channel and Receiver.

3.1.1 Transmitter 
The Desired 8-VSB signal was obtained from a Rohde & Schwarz SFQ modulator.  The 
signal source for the 8-VSB modulator was from a video spooler. 
3.1.2 Channel 
The Undesired 1 DTV signal came from a R&S SX 800 VSB modulator, the RF output 
was connected to a high precision attenuator through a FCC Mask compliant filter.  This 
DTV signal has a fix channel output, 662-668 MHz, channel 46. 
The Undesired 2 DTV signal came from a Ktech VSB-ENC-150E VSB modulator, the 
RF output was directly connected to a high precision attenuator. 
An Agilent ESA-E4405B spectrum analyzer was connected at the combiner output, to 
make the average power measurement of the DTV signals. 
3.1.3 Receiver 
The output signal from the combiner was connected to the 8-VSB receiver under test. 
The video signal from the integrated MPEG decoder was connected to a video monitor to 
determine the Threshold of Visibility (TOV) level. 
3.1.4 Test Conditions 
The tests were done from channel 17 to 61, depending of the test scenario. 
Five different receivers were used and two scenarios for single DTV into DTV were 
tested. 
The first scenario: the desired DTV signal was fixed on channel 32 and the undesired 
DTV channel was changed from channel 17 to 47 (N-15 to N+15).  The undesired signal 
(See description of Undesired 2 above) was not filtered. 
The second scenario: the desired DTV channel was changed from channel 31 to 61 
(N+15 to N-15) and the undesired DTV signal was fixed on channel 46.  The undesired 
signal was filtered according to FCC mask specifications. (See description of Undesired 
1 above) 
TOV was found over a 15 seconds measurement period.  A delay of 5 seconds was 
granted to the receiver for stabilization before the TOV measurement was started.  TOV 
is the point where you first encounter visual errors (such as blocking or freezing) on the 
picture over the measurement period with the minimum level of interferences.  The 
precision of the test was 0.5 dB.

4.1 Results for Single DTV Interference into DTV 
The purpose of this test was to determine the performance of the 8-VSB receivers under 
the case of a single adjacent or taboo channel interfering signal. 
The level of interference (D/U) at TOV was recorded for an undesired DTV signal.  
These tests were done with the following five different desired DTV signal RF levels: 
• Very Strong: -15 dBm 
• ATSC Strong: -28 dBm 
• ATSC Moderate: -53 dBm 
• ATSC Weak: -68 dBm 
• 7 dB above Edge of DTV Contour : -76 dBm   
NOTE:  The ATSC specified DTV receiver min. signal level is -83 dBm, 
which is the signal received at the Edge of the DTV coverage contour.  
At min. signal level, the receiver cannot tolerate any additional 
impairment.  The desired signal level used in the laboratory test must 
be higher than the min. signal level.  Some legacy receivers can not 
meet the ATSC min. signal level specification.  A head room of 7 dB was 
added to the min. signal level, i.e. -76 dBm,  as the lowest desired 
signal level in order to overcome the difference in minimum threshold 
levels between receivers.  Note however that the lower the desired 
signal, the more sensitive the receiver to the impairments.  
Table 1 to 5 shows the result for Unfiltered DTV into DTV with five desired powers.  In 
that case, the desired DTV signal was fixed on channel 32 and the undesired DTV signal 
(unfiltered) was set to the proper channel relationship.

Page 6 
Table 6 to 10 shows the result for Filtered DTV into DTV with five desired powers.  In 
that case, the undesired DTV signal was fix on channel 46, filtered according to FCC 
mask, and the desired DTV signal was set to the proper channel. 
Graphs for Moderate, Weak and 7 dB above Edge of DTV Contour for Unfiltered and 
Filtered DTV into DTV are presented following the corresponding table. 
NOTE: 1. Table cells highlighted in YELLOW mean that the maximum power level 
generated from the test bed configuration was reached. The actual D/U ratios 
highlighted in yellow in the table are less than the reported value.  In those 
cases, TOV was never reached that there was no video impairment. 
2. Table cells highlighted in RED mean that the receiver failed to acquire at 
that desired signal level without the interference (the receiver min. signal level 
is too high on this RF channel).
