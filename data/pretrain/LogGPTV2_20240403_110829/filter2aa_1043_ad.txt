### Receiving Systems and Cross-Polarization Discrimination

The effectiveness of receiving systems is irrelevant, and no amount of cross-polarization discrimination can be relied upon. Additionally, the out-of-band emission mask for unlicensed devices (as per the revision of Section 15.209) must strictly limit power outside the co- and adjacent channels to extremely low values. The table below illustrates that power over every 6 MHz portion of the TV band should be significantly less than 9.5E-7 mW, except for the 6 MHz used by the device and the two adjacent channels.

### Interference Calculations: Examples

#### Step-by-Step Procedure

1. **Start with the isotropically radiated power of the source:**
   - 3 m from the source: 4000 mW
   - 10 m from the source: 4000 mW
   - 3 m from the source: 9.50E-7 mW
   - 10 m from the source: 9.50E-7 mW

2. **Calculate Power Flux Density (PFD):**
   - Surface area at 3 m: \( 4\pi \times 3^2 = 113 \, \text{sq. m} \)
     - PFD for 4000 mW: \( \frac{4000}{113} \, \text{mW/sq. m} = 35.4 \, \text{mW/sq. m} \)
   - Surface area at 10 m: \( 4\pi \times 10^2 = 1257 \, \text{sq. m} \)
     - PFD for 4000 mW: \( \frac{4000}{1257} \, \text{mW/sq. m} = 3.18 \, \text{mW/sq. m} \)
   - 3 m from the source: \( 8.41E-09 \, \text{mW/sq. m} \)
   - 10 m from the source: \( 7.56E-10 \, \text{mW/sq. m} \)

3. **Find field from PFD:**
   - Convert PFD to watts/sq. m, multiply by the resistance of free space (377 ohms), then take the square root.
   - 3 m from the source: \( 3.65 \, \text{V/m} \)
   - 10 m from the source: \( 1.095 \, \text{V/m} \)
   - 3 m from the source: \( 0.0000563 \, \text{V/m} \)
   - 10 m from the source: \( 0.0000169 \, \text{V/m} \)

4. **Convert V/m to conventional units describing the field:**
   - Use the formula: \( 20 \log(\text{V/m}) + 120 = \text{dBu} \)
   - 3 m from the source: \( 131.2 \, \text{dBu} \)
   - 10 m from the source: \( 120.8 \, \text{dBu} \)
   - 3 m from the source: \( 35.0 \, \text{dBu} \)
   - 10 m from the source: \( 24.5 \, \text{dBu} \)

5. **Find C/I, the excess of field required for DTV reception over the interference field:**
   - Required DTV field: 41 dBu (OET Bulletin No. 69 provides modifications based on dipole reception factors).
   - 3 m from the source: \( -90.2 \, \text{dB} \)
   - 10 m from the source: \( -79.8 \, \text{dB} \)
   - 3 m from the source: \( 6.0 \, \text{dB} \)
   - 10 m from the source: \( 16.5 \, \text{dB} \)

6. **Find I/N, the ratio of interference power to the thermal noise experienced by DTV receivers near 41 dBu contours:**
   - I/N = 15 - C/I (15 dB is the minimum carrier-to-noise ratio for DTV reception)
   - 3 m from the source: \( 105.2 \, \text{dB} \)
   - 10 m from the source: \( 64.8 \, \text{dB} \)
   - 3 m from the source: \( 9.0 \, \text{dB} \)
   - 10 m from the source: \( -1.5 \, \text{dB} \)

7. **Evaluate potential for interference:**
   - I/N should be negative. A value of 0 dB effectively doubles the noise, increasing the minimum DTV signal to 44 dBu (an increase of 3 dB).
   - 3 m from the source: Loss of picture
   - 10 m from the source: Loss of picture
   - 3 m from the source: Loss of picture except where DTV signal is very strong
   - 10 m from the source: DTV receiver desensitized by less than 3 dB

### Sensing RF Fields

Sensing RF fields is an inadequate method for protecting DTV services. These services require protection based on service contours determined in an absolute manner, using geographic information and precise knowledge of the location of unlicensed devices before they transmit. Sensing, however, measures RF fields only in a very localized and momentary way, at a specific point among or inside buildings, and at a particular height relative to building heights and terrain.

Since sensing cannot determine the location of a device relative to service contours, it can only be effective for devices with such low power that they are safe within a very limited area. A network of such devices is impractical because this small area confines the entire network. In such a small area, there may be some assurance that no DTV receivers can get a picture, allowing the device to transmit without interrupting DTV service. However, measurements by a single sensing device over a short duration are highly unreliable. According to the Canadian Research Center, there is only a 24 dB margin between the threshold of feasible sensing technology and the minimum field required by DTV receivers. This means that an incorrect clear-to-transmit decision will be made if the signal available to the sensing device is 24 dB less than the field in use by DTV receivers. Signal variation of 24 dB is highly likely due to the statistics of RF propagation. Location variability in the UHF TV band is around 15 dB, and the motion of vehicles and the way mobile devices are held can add another 10 dB difference. These factors introduce significant statistical uncertainties. Additionally, the "hidden node" problem, where an obstacle blocks the path to a sensing device but not the DTV reception path, further complicates the issue.

### Conclusions

To ensure that TV band devices provide at least the same level of protection as TV licensees receive from other licensed operations, co-channel and adjacent channel operation of such devices must be prohibited inside the DTV service contours. Specific separation or "keep-away" distances from these contours must be established, and it would be reasonable and practical to base these distances on free-space radio path loss calculations and line-of-sight considerations.

Revisions to §15.209 of the FCC Rules for unlicensed TV band devices must require that out-of-band noise power over every 6 MHz portion of the TV band be considerably less than 9.5E-7 mW, except for the 6 MHz used by the device and the two adjacent channels. The "white space" in the TV band is much more limited than implied by considering only co- and adjacent channel interference, as almost any point on the map is covered by one or more DTV services that can be desensitized by noise-like emissions to the point of losing picture. Finally, sensing is an ineffective method for protecting DTV service from interference, especially in the case of personal/portable devices. The radio fields observed by sensing devices are subject to variations much larger than the detection window of practical devices.

### Exhibit B: Laboratory Evaluation of Five VSB Television Receivers in DTV Adjacent Channel Interference

#### Introduction

The Association for Maximum Service Television, Inc. (MSTV) requested a laboratory evaluation of five ATSC 8-VSB digital television receivers in the presence of adjacent/taboo DTV channel interferences. The tests were conducted at the Communications Research Centre Canada to determine the receivers' capabilities to handle DTV signals in the presence of single or multiple DTV interferers, simulating conditions expected with unlicensed devices operating in the TV band under the FCC proposal in Docket 04-168.

#### Major Findings

- There are substantial differences in interference performance among different VSB receivers and interference mechanisms, regardless of age and vintage.
- Interfering signals on the upper and lower first adjacent channels are the most problematic, consistently resulting in large calculated interference distances "r" at which the interfering device can cause a DTV receiver to reach TOV.
- Interfering signals on the second and third adjacent channels can also be problematic, resulting in calculated interference distances "r" larger than 10 meters.
- Image interference on channels +7, +14, and +15 can also result in significant distances under certain circumstances for certain receivers.
- Multiple interfering signals reduce the D/U ratios, with the worst case being N+x and N+2x, leading to degradation of more than 30 dB on some receivers.

#### Laboratory Set-up and Test Conditions

The VSB receivers were tested against DTV interferences, including adjacent/taboo channels from N – 15 to N + 15 into DTV. The laboratory set-up was divided into three sections: Transmitter, Channel, and Receiver.

- **Transmitter:** The desired 8-VSB signal was generated using a Rohde & Schwarz SFQ modulator.
- **Channel:** The undesired DTV signals were generated using R&S SX 800 and Ktech VSB-ENC-150E modulators, with the RF output connected to high-precision attenuators through FCC Mask compliant filters.
- **Receiver:** The output signal from the combiner was connected to the 8-VSB receiver under test, with the video signal from the integrated MPEG decoder connected to a video monitor to determine the Threshold of Visibility (TOV) level.

#### Test Procedures and Results

The tests included single and multiple DTV interferences, with the following scenarios:

- **Single Interferer:**
  - Unfiltered adjacent DTV from N-15 to N+15 into DTV.
  - Filtered adjacent DTV from N-15 to N+15 into DTV.
- **Multiple Interferers:**
  - N-1 and N+1 into DTV.
  - N-2 and N+2 into DTV.
  - N-3 and N+3 into DTV.
  - N-4 and N+3 into DTV.
  - N+2 and N+3 into DTV.
  - N+2 and N+4 into DTV.
  - N+4 and N+6 into DTV.
  - N+7 and N+14 into DTV.

The results for single DTV interference into DTV, with five different desired DTV signal RF levels, are summarized in Tables 1 to 10. Graphs for moderate, weak, and 7 dB above Edge of DTV Contour for both unfiltered and filtered DTV into DTV are provided.

#### Conclusion

The laboratory tests confirmed that there are significant differences in the interference performance of different VSB receivers. Interfering signals on the first adjacent channels are the most problematic, and multiple interfering signals can lead to substantial degradation. These findings highlight the need for robust protection measures and careful regulation of unlicensed devices in the TV band.
