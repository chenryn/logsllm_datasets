Question: Alice and Bob want to communicate securely over the internet. They are considering several cryptographic schemes to ensure that their messages remain confidential and unaltered. Evaluate the scenarios and select the ones where the cryptographic scheme effectively counters the given type of adversary:
"A": "Using symmetric encryption, where Alice and Bob share a secret key, to prevent Eve from understanding the messages.",
"B": "Employing digital signatures so that any tampering by Mallory can be detected by Alice and Bob.",
"C": "Implementing a hashing function to ensure message integrity against active tampering by Mallory.",
"D": "Relying on steganography alone to hide the existence of a message from Eve."
Answer: ABC
