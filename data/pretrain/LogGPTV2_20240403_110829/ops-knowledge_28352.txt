Question: An embedded system is designed to perform a secure-boot process by transferring bootloader code from Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) to Volatile Memory (VM) within the system. The design team is concerned about the potential for adversaries to modify the boot code in VM after authentication. Which of the following approaches could mitigate this security risk?
"A": "Implement a real-time monitoring system to track changes in VM after the bootloader code has been authenticated.",
"B": "Restrict access to VM by setting up hardware-based access controls and ensuring that only authenticated code can write to it.",
"C": "Encrypt the bootloader code in NVM using a symmetric key algorithm to prevent adversaries from reading the code.",
"D": "Design a watchdog timer that resets the system if the bootloader code execution takes longer than expected."
Answer: B
