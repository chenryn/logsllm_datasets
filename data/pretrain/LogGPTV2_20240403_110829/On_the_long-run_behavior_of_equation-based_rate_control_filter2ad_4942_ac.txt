which does not depend on ¯p; here Γ is the gamma function. We also
come to the same conclusion by computing ¯x for TFRC weights,
which is lengthy, and thus not shown here.
On the other hand, for PFTK-simpliﬁed function, we observe
that ¯x decreases towards 0 as we increase ¯p. This explains the
known throughput drop for heavy losses.
In Fig. 4 we show the corresponding results for the comprehen-
sive control. The results are qualitatively the same as the respective
results for the basic control shown in Fig. 3. For SQRT function,
the normalized throughputs are less, but fairly close, to the ideal
value 1. For PFTK-simpliﬁed function, the results are somewhat
less conservative than for the basic control.
Next we investigate the impact of the variability of ˆθn. To that
end, we consider the normalized throughput ¯x as we vary the co-
efﬁcient of variation of θn, while we keep the equilibrium point
ﬁxed at ¯p = 0.01 and 0.1; see Fig. 5. We show numerical results
only for the basic control with PFTK-simpliﬁed formula. We ob-
serve that the larger the variability of ˆθn, the more conservative the
control is. This is indeed more pronounced for larger ¯p due to the
larger convexity and steepness of 1/f (1/x) for small x (large ¯p)
with PFTK-simpliﬁed function.
Also observe how the throughput depends on L, the window size
used for the estimator ˆθn, in Fig. 3, Fig. 4 and Fig. 5. A large L
reduces the variability of ˆθn and thus increases the throughput, as
predicted in Claim 1.
Lastly, we brieﬂy mention the results obtained for θn geometri-
cally distributed with parameter ¯p (not shown in the paper). In this
case, the same qualitative statements also hold, but with a slight

trend to non-conservative direction for large ¯p due to the reason
explained earlier.
3.6 Validation of Claim 2
We do additional experiments to verify Claim 2, which, inci-
dentally, also provide some examples of non-conservative behav-
ior. Consider (θn)n that we deﬁne as follows. We suppose there
exists a hidden Markov chain (HMC) that governs the loss events.
We deﬁne this HMC (Zn)n to be discrete time clocked at the loss
events. Assume (Zn)n takes values on a ﬁnite state space E; call
P = [pij] the matrix of transition probabilities, and π its stationary
probability. Take as a modeling assumption:
P(θn = m|Zn = i, Zk, θk, k  1, where cov0
be negative; this is to be expected from the bound on throughput in
Equation (10). Another observation is that the non-conservative
behavior happens for positively correlated (θn)n (pgb + pbg ≤ 1),
in particular, for small values of pgb and pbg (slow dynamics of the
HMC). In the remainder of this section, we discuss this limit case
in some more detail.
T[X0, S0] is negative, but also cov0
We show that for the slow dynamics of the HMC the control
may have a substantial overshoot, as opposed to a modest overshoot
observed in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8. We deﬁne the slow HMC limit as
pgb, pbg → 0, and pgb = upbg, for some ﬁxed u > 0. Then, for
both the basic and comprehensive control we obtain:
