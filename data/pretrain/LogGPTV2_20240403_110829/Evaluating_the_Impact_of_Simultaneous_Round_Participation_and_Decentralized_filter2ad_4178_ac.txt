degrade performance when w = 1. In this case, the per-
formance is always either equal or worst than the baseline
conﬁguration. In the next section, we show that, for all the
remaining conﬁgurations (when w > 1), the performance is
either equal or better.
4.2.2 Impact of the Decision Pattern with Simultane-
ous Round Participation
In the CT-consensus, the coordinator of round r is blocked
in the last phase of round r until it gathers n−f votes. In the
HMMR-consensus, thanks to a window of size greater than
1, the coordinator (like any other process) can participate in
the next round as soon as it has sent its own vote. The quick
participation of the coordinator in the next round is posi-
tive especially when the coordinator of round r is correct
but suspected by too many other processes. Additionally,
all the positive votes generated in a recent past are taken
into account and may allow to decide as soon as a major-
ity of positive votes is observed by the set of coordinators,
represented by X, during one of the w rounds executed in
parallel. It is important to notice that the management of
the window requires no additional messages. Moreover, the
space cost of this mechanism is low since it requires only a
single counter to be kept for each round in the window. Be-
fore analyzing the case in which simultaneous round partic-
ipantion and decentralized decision co-exist, we study the
case in which we ﬁx the decision pattern parameter to its
smallest value (x = 2), while increase the size of the win-
dow (w > 1).
As expected, simultaneous round participation, repre-
sented by w > 1, is of special interest in scenarios where
the failure detector provides a bad QoS. As the graphics
in Figure 2 show, even considering the minimal conﬁgu-
ration for X (x = 2), the performance degradation caused
by wrong suspicions (variation of PF D from 5% to 20%)
is much smaller when simultaneous rounds are executing
(w > 1) than for the baseline conﬁguration (w = 1). As
mentioned before, this is due to the fact that some processes
(those belonging to X) have more chances to decide during
a number of consecutive rounds in spite of the occurrence
of wrong suspicions. Moreover, since the overhead incurred
by the implementation of simultaneous rounds can be ne-

Figure 2. Performance results for the base-
line conﬁguration and the one using simulta-
neous round participation (w > 1) and mini-
mal decentralization (x = 2).
glected, the choice of using a window of size as large as
possible contributes to achieving better performance. So, as
can be attested by the graphics in Figure 2, choosing w = n
corresponds to the best conﬁguration. In that case, the per-
formances obtained when x = 2, w = n and PF D = 20%,
depending on the metrics of interest, can be even better than
those obtained in the baseline conﬁguration (x = 2 and
w = 1) when the failure detector is perfect (PF D = 0%).
Figure 3 illustrates the performance results for the pro-
tocol considering the best conﬁguration for w, w = n, and
2 ≤ x ≤ n, against the baseline conﬁguration. The values
plotted represent the gains or losses when comparing the
performance of a particular conﬁguration with the perfor-
mance of the baseline conﬁguration. Note that, by varying
the value of x, it is possible to achieve different performance
gains which, usually, increase as the PF D becomes worse.
As mentioned before, gains exist because more processes
(those belonging to X) are allowed to decide autonomously
during more rounds (w = n).
Note that, when the PF D becomes worse, the perfor-
mance gains obtained when adopting a decentralized deci-
sion increase. This is due to the use of simultaneous round
participation (w > 1) which contributes to mask the bad
effects of wrong suspicions caused when processes are al-
lowed to participate to only one (w = 1). The impact of
decentralized decision is always positive, except for the 1st-
smallest decision time when failure detectors are perfect. In
this case, the choice of x has nearly no impact on the perfor-
mance of the protocol because the ﬁrst process to decide the
consensus tends to be the coordinator of the ﬁrst round. This
lack of difference is due to the adoption of a homogeneous
network load during the simulations. Performance gains
may perhaps appear in scenarios of heterogenous workloads
where processes would have different speeds. In that case
the higher the value of x, the higher the chances to ﬁnd a
process in the deciders set that is faster than the round coor-
dinator [12].
From the results in Figure 3, signiﬁcant performance
gains are obtained for the kth-decision time when x = k.
Then, for higher values of x, the performance gains stabi-
lize. Thus the choice of x = k seems to be the best solution
when one want to limit the number of messages exchanged
(i.e. when contention in the network is also a concern at the
application level). Otherwise, x = n is a good choice since
it contributes to attain similar performance gains.
Figure 4 allows the comparison of the best conﬁguration
(w = n, x = n) and the baseline conﬁguration (w = 1,
x = 2).
In a scenario without faults nor wrong suspi-
cions (PF D = 0%), the results obtained for the 1st-decision
time show that the behaviors of the protocol are similar in
both conﬁgurations. In the presence of wrong suspicions
(PF D ≥ 5%), the impact of a bad QoS of the failure de-
tector is entirely masked when w and x are set to n: the

ever the QoS of the failure detector. Very few degradation
are observed (7.3% for the 1st-smallest decision). Indeed,
when analyzing the curves in Figure 4 we can verify that the
results exhibited for the worst QoS (PF D = 20%) are close
to or even much better than that for the baseline conﬁgura-
tion without wrong suspicions (PF D = 0%). For example,
when considering the 5th-smallest decision time, the best
result for the baseline conﬁguration was 45.55ut and for
w = n and x = n, was 36.82ut. So, a performance gain of
19.2% was obtained.
