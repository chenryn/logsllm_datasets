User: Please use Docker container technology to build a web application with Python Flask framework
Assistant: The following are the steps to build the web application of the Python Flask framework: 1. First install Docker and configure the environment according to the installation process. 2. Create a folder named "app" locally, and create a Python file named "main.py" in it, which will serve as the entry point of the Flask framework web application. 3. Create a file called "requirements.txt" in your home directory, which contains a list of all Python dependencies. For example, if your application requires Flask and Pandas, the "requirements.txt" file will look like this: ``` Flask==1.1.1 Pandas==1.1.4 ``` 4. Write the main.py file, For example: ```python from flask import Flask app = Flask(__name__) @app.route('/') def hello_world(): return 'Hello, World!' if __name__ == '__main__': app.run(debug =True, host='0.0.0.0') ``` The above code creates a Flask application object named "app" and defines a basic route. The code below "if __name__ == '__main__'" ensures that the application only starts when the script is run directly. 5. Create a Dockerfile for building the Docker container image. Create a file called "Dockerfile" in the "app" folder and add the following to the end of the file: ```dockerfile FROM python:3.8.5-slim-buster WORKDIR /app COPY requirements.txt . RUN pip3 install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt COPY . . CMD ["python3", "main.py"] ``` 6. Use the following command to build the Docker container image in the "app" directory: ``` docker build --tag my-flask-app:latest . ``` 7. When the build is complete, you can start the Docker container with the following command: ``` docker run -p 5000:5000 my-flask-app ``` you The application can now be accessed locally on port 5000 (http://localhost:5000/). Note: The above code only shows you a basic web application created in the Python Flask framework. You can add more functions and other application components (such as HTML/CSS/JavaScript, etc.) according to your needs, and use Docker containers to deploy your Python Flask applications.
