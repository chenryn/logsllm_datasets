### Impact on Attitudes

We asked participants to respond to seven statements measuring their attitudes toward tracking and ad targeting. Broadly, participants agreed that transparency is valuable and that tracking can be perceived as intrusive. However, they expressed a range of complex and divergent opinions regarding the usefulness of relevant ads, inferencing, and third-party tracking (Figure 5). Notably, while a majority of participants (over 70%) agreed that it was "creepy for companies to track websites I visit to show relevant ads," more than a third (36.7%) also indicated they would be "comfortable with companies guessing my interests based on websites I visit." This apparent contradiction reveals nuanced differences between comfort with interest inference and discomfort with tracking for advertising purposes. 

Despite these varied responses, Tracking Transparency did not significantly alter these broader attitudes. For six out of the seven questions, participant responses remained largely unchanged after using the extension. Our repeated-measures regression models did not reveal significant differences across conditions. The distribution of post-usage responses is reported, except where noted.

### Usefulness of Ads and Tracking

Participants were divided on the usefulness of personalization. Approximately 44.7% agreed that they "would like to see ads that are relevant to my interests, as opposed to generic ads," while 32.0% disagreed. Similarly, 40.0% agreed that they "would be comfortable with online advertising companies guessing my interests based on which websites I visit," but 44.9% disagreed. A significant majority (71.3%) found it creepy for "advertising companies to track which websites I visit in order to show me ads that are relevant to my interests." However, opinions were split on whether such tracking is fair, with 30.6% agreeing and 52.9% disagreeing. These results align with previous research indicating that some users find personalization useful, while many are uncomfortable with the methods of web tracking [90].

### Understanding of Tracking

Participants' self-reported understanding of tracking increased significantly from 70.1% pre-usage to 82.8% post-usage (β = −0.967, p = 0.002). Additionally, 48.5% of participants agreed that they "would like to use a system that shows me what information has been collected," while 64.9% disagreed that ad companies adequately explain why they receive particular ads.

### Privacy Attitudes

We also examined how Tracking Transparency might impact participants' broad privacy attitudes, but observed no significant effect. Both before and after using the extension, participants completed the Awareness and Collection subscales of the IUIPC privacy index. Responses were coded on a scale from strongly disagree (-3) to strongly agree (3). Even in the pre-usage survey, participants expressed high privacy concern. The median response, averaged across items, on the Awareness sub-scale was 2.7 (µ = 2.3, σ = 0.8), between "agree" and "strongly agree." The median response on the Collection sub-scale was 2.0 (µ = 1.7, σ = 1.2).

### Perceptions of Tradeoffs

Targeted advertising and efforts to stop it often involve tradeoffs for users. To understand how our extension influenced these considerations, we asked participants to choose between four pairs of tradeoffs, indicating whether they "definitely" or "probably" preferred one option, or if they were unsure. Participants' preferences were diverse and sometimes conflicting (Figure 6). These preferences did not vary by condition. For example, 48.7% preferred a free internet with tracking, while 29.2% preferred to pay for an internet with no tracking. This supports previous findings that some people are willing to pay a premium for privacy, especially when privacy information is transparent [26, 88]. Similarly, 69.4% preferred that search results not be tracked (and thus not personalized), while 21.6% preferred the opposite.

### Estimates of Browsing and Tracking

In both surveys, participants were asked to numerically estimate their web browsing and the number of trackers they encountered. Before using the extension, participants consistently underestimated both, with no variance by condition. The longitudinal conditions of the extension helped participants better quantify their web browsing (see Table 3 in the appendix for median estimates by condition, pre- and post-usage). Pre-usage, the median participant estimated visiting 100–200 pages across 22.5–35 domains each week. According to our telemetry data, the median participant actually visited 1,682 web pages on 68 unique domains over the study week. Prior to using the extension, the median participant estimated encountering 10–20 trackers each week. Our telemetry data showed that the median participant encountered 148 unique trackers over the week.

### Discussion

By visualizing third-party web tracking and potential inferences, we aimed to facilitate discussions about the prevalence of third-party tracking. Advertisers' obscure dashboards and technical knowledge have previously been barriers to obtaining transparent information about online tracking. Tracking Transparency allows researchers to understand how providing more information to non-technical users can affect their reactions. Despite prior work suggesting users might be unmotivated [97], our field study indicated that users are interested in learning about how they are profiled through their browsing.

In the realm of online privacy, knowledge is power. A better understanding of how online privacy is affected enables better decision-making. This parallels security psychology research, which posits that accurate risk perception leads to better security decisions [25, 35, 97]. The Tracking Transparency prototype is a step in this direction, as participants who used the fully featured tool were significantly better at quantifying online tracking than those who used a controlled representation of current user interfaces.

Future privacy tools should empower users to learn how such technologies impact them, enabling informed discussions about tracking and the use cases for privacy-preserving measures. There is also significant room for additional tools and policies to support online privacy. Related work has explored users' contextual preferences regarding web tracking and subsequent technical tools [59, 60]. Future work should explore providing users not only with transparency but also with greater control over tracking. Additionally, companies need to provide more transparency about how they infer interests and use them for targeting. Some recent initiatives partially support this goal [73]. Media attention has increasingly focused on the misuse of tracked data, particularly in discriminatory and political contexts. The Tracking Transparency interface takes an important first step in motivating users to consider behavioral changes, learning, and public policy demands.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we presented Tracking Transparency, a browser extension designed to communicate more information about online tracking to users and to support research into the impact of transparency. Even before using our tool, participants were often aware of the existence of online tracking. However, when confronted with detailed descriptions of tracking in their own browsing, they were often surprised by its extent and prevalence. Participants who saw detailed information about potential inferences reported greater intentions to take privacy-protective actions.

Our field study demonstrated the importance of providing detailed, longitudinal tracker data to users. The Tracking Transparency prototype approximates information that advertising companies have little incentive to provide and is otherwise difficult for users to obtain. After completing our study, several participants expressed a desire to keep Tracking Transparency installed. This suggests that our interface addresses a much-needed intermediate step in the privacy-consciousness spectrum: educating the public about how their own browsing data is collected and used without their explicit permission. Without greater public awareness about the scope and practices of online tracking, advancing privacy-friendly policies or regulatory options is unlikely.
