# Bug report
**What is the current behavior?**
I met huge build time degradation in new beta release. For example, node
target in prod mode took
    Version: webpack 5.0.0-beta.0
    Time: 231016ms
instead of
    Version: webpack 4.40.2
    Time: 147028ms
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**
I recorded graphs via `webpack.debug.ProfilingPlugin` for browser and node
targets in both modes (dev and prod). I tried to open it but chrome stucks in
the processing phase and closes devtool after that. Could you try to open it?

**What is the expected behavior?**
Seems that it should take same or less time
