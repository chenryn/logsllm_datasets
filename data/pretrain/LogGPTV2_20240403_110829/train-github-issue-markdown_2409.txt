I'm running into this error:
    ./request.rs:1:7: 1:29 error: duplicate definition of type request
    ./request.rs:1 import mre::request::request;
                          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
even though I only import `mre::request::request` once in that file. Perhaps
I'm running into a compiler bug, or maybe I just don't quite understand the
import rules. So, it would be helpful if the duplicate definition error also
reported where rust first found the definition.
