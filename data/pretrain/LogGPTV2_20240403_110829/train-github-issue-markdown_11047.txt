I currently have a requirement for implementing Bluetooth communication, which necessitates the use of native APIs to facilitate this functionality. To achieve this, I need to leverage both Android and iOS APIs. However, my expertise lies in Android development. 

To ensure a comprehensive solution, I will need to either collaborate with an iOS developer or expand my skill set to include iOS development. This will allow me to effectively implement and integrate Bluetooth communication across both platforms.
