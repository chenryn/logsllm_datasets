ABSTRACT
SpaceX, Amazon, and others plan to put thousands of satellites
in low Earth orbit to provide global low-latency broadband Inter-
net. SpaceX‚Äôs plans have matured quickly, such that their under-
deployment satellite constellation is already the largest in history,
and may start offering service in 2020.
The proposed constellations hold great promise, but also present
new challenges for networking. To enable research in this exciting
space, we present Hypatia, a framework for simulating and visual-
izing the network behavior of these constellations by incorporating
their unique characteristics, such as high-velocity orbital motion.
Using publicly available design details for the upcoming net-
works to drive our simulator, we characterize the expected behavior
of these networks, including latency and link utilization fluctuations
over time, and the implications of these variations for congestion
control and routing.

1 INTRODUCTION
The Internet is potentially taking ‚Äúone giant leap‚Äù into space, with
plans afoot for large satellite constellations to blanket the globe with
low-latency broadband Internet. Numerous competitors have dis-
closed efforts along these lines, including SpaceX [70], Amazon [8],

and Telesat [74]. With 400+ satellites already in orbit, and an increas-
ing launch cadence, SpaceX‚Äôs Starlink constellation is promising
limited availability of its Internet service already in 2020 [23]. It is
thus unsurprising that these ambitious plans for an ‚ÄúInternet from
space‚Äù have captured the public imagination [10, 28, 55, 62, 75].
While the use of satellites for Internet connectivity is as old
as the Internet itself1, the under-construction constellations differ
fundamentally from past efforts. The distinctions are rooted in
the recent improvements in enabling technologies, as well as the
goals, but manifest themselves deeply in the design. Unlike existing
satellite networks [35‚Äì37], the new ones are targeting not only
traditional niches such as shipping, satellite telephony, and limited
connectivity for rural areas, but also mass market broadband that
not only addresses these global coverage issues, but also competes
with current terrestrial networks in many markets.
The first design manifestation of this goal is scale: to provision
enough access bandwidth for their larger target user population,
the new systems need many more satellites than past ones. Starlink,
with its hundreds of satellites, is already the largest ever satellite
fleet in space history, but eventually, the largest planned constel-
lations will each comprise thousands of satellites [8, 70]. This has
only become possible due to favorable trends in space technology,
primarily, satellite miniaturization, and reduced launch costs.
The goal of competing outside traditional niches has another
important design consequence: operation in low Earth orbit (LEO),
at most 2,000 km above Earth‚Äôs surface. This is essential for latencies
to be comparable to terrestrial networks instead of the hundreds of
milliseconds that geostationary orbits (GEO) incur. LEO operation,
in turn, further reinforces the need for large scale: from GEO, each
satellite is visible to a large terrestrial area, but bringing satellites
closer to the Earth necessarily reduces each satellite‚Äôs coverage.
Large LEO constellations promise global coverage at low-latency
and high-bandwidth. However, realizing the full potential of these
networks requires addressing new research challenges posed by
their unique dynamics. In such constellations, each satellite orbits
the Earth every ‚àº100 minutes, traveling at ‚àº27,000 kmph. This
high-velocity movement of satellites creates not only high churn in
the ground to satellite links, but also fluctuations in the structure
of end-end paths as the satellites comprising the paths move.
At HotNets 2018, three position papers [5, 29, 44] highlighted
some of the networking challenges that could potentially arise in
LEO networks, e.g., in end-end congestion control [5] and intra-
constellation routing [29]. However, progress in precisely flesh-
ing out these challenges and addressing them faces a substantial
roadblock: lack of network analysis tools that incorporate the dy-
namic behavior of LEO networks. This creates a substantial risk
1An early satellite network, SATNET, formed an initial segment of the Internet, and in
fact, provided the key motivation for Cerf-Kahn‚Äôs work on the foundational Internet
Protocol: interconnecting networks as different as ARPANET, PRNET, and SATNET to
each other [1].

that instead of networking research laying out the potential future
trajectories for the industry, research will rather lag the industry‚Äôs
rapid strides. Thus, to help accelerate research on LEO networks,
we developed Hypatia2, an analysis framework with simulation
and visualization modules. Hypatia provides a packet-level LEO
network simulator based on ns-3, as well as several types of net-
work visualizations based on Cesium [13], that serve to provide
intuition about such networks.
We use Hypatia to analyze the three largest proposed LEO
networks: Starlink, Kuiper, and Telesat. Our analysis uses the reg-
ulatory information these companies have filed with governing
bodies like the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the
United States, and the International Telecommunication Union
(ITU). These filings [47‚Äì49, 68, 69, 72] disclose the orbital parame-
ters that describe the structure of the planned constellations. Our
simulations of these networks reveal the impact of LEO dynamics
on varying path RTTs and packet reordering, as well as fluctuations
in available bandwidth along end-end paths. We discuss the impli-
cations of these observations for congestion control and routing.
In summary, we make the following contributions:
‚Ä¢ We lay out the case for building network analysis tools for
upcoming LEO networks. As a first step towards meeting this
need, we develop Hypatia, an analysis framework capturing
the orbital dynamics of LEO networks.
‚Ä¢ We use regulatory filings by the largest three planned LEO
‚Ä¢ Using packet-level simulations, we analyze the behavior of
individual end-end connections across such networks in terms
of their changing latencies and path structure, and show how
this impacts congestion control negatively, even in the absence
of any competing traffic.
‚Ä¢ Further, by simulating traffic constellation-wide, we show that
the changes in path structure result in a difficult problem for
routing and traffic engineering, as the utilization of paths and
links is highly dynamic.
‚Ä¢ Hypatia‚Äôs visualizations aid intuition about the structure of
satellite trajectories and their impact on a constellation‚Äôs be-
havior, and pin-point traffic hotspots in the network and show

networks to evaluate and visualize their networks.
Satellite networking played an important role in laying the foun-
dations of the Internet, and may again provide the impetus for
substantial and exciting changes. We hope that Hypatia will serve
as an enabler for that work. Hypatia‚Äôs source code is available
online [40], together with our visualizations [7].
2 BACKGROUND & RELATED WORK
LEO mega-constellations being a new problem area, we include
relevant background to aid our readers.
2.1 What makes an LEO satellite network?
A large LEO constellation may comprise hundreds to thousands of
satellites. These satellites are organized into a number of orbits. An
2The name is a tribute to an early leader in astronomy and mathematics, who is better
recognized as a commentator and teacher, rather than for her new inventions, in line
with the spirit of this work.
Each satellite uses radio up/down links to communicate with
ground stations (GSes), as shown in Fig. 1. A satellite can only
connect to GSes from which it can be seen at sufficiently high
elevation in the sky, as defined by the minimum angle of elevation,
ùëô. A satellite directly overhead a GS is at elevation 90¬∞, while one at
the horizon is at 0¬∞. If the minimum elevation ùëô = 40¬∞, only GSes that
see a satellite at elevation 40¬∞ or higher in the sky can communicate
with it. Thus, smaller ùëô values allow GSes to talk to satellites closer
to the horizon, while larger ùëô values are more restrictive. However
smaller ùëô values also have a downside: connections from lower
elevation experience reduced antenna gain and signal quality due
to beam contour widening and increased attenuation.
According to Kuiper‚Äôs FCC filings [46], each satellite will have
multiple antennas, with each antenna supporting multiple steerable
beams; the beam steering and frequency band allocation will be
software-defined, with the goal of maximizing throughput. Whether
each GS can also simultaneously connect to multiple satellites de-
pends on the type of GS: a user terminal uses a single phased-array
antenna, while an enterprise user or gateway terminal uses multiple
parabolic antennas with more flexibility [46].

of elevation, ùëô. A satellite uses steerable beams of different frequency
bands (e.g., fb1, fb2) to connect to different GSes.
orbit is described by: (a) its inclination, ùëñ, the angle its plane makes
with the Equator traveling northward; and (b) its height above sea-
level, ‚Ñé < 2,000 km. Satellites within one orbit are uniformly spaced
out. A set of orbits with the same ùëñ and ‚Ñé, and crossing the Equator at
uniform spacing from each other, is called an orbital shell. (Typically
orbits in a shell vary their elevation around ‚Ñé to avoid collisions
‚Äî these minor differences are largely immaterial to networking.)
Large constellations may deploy one or more such shells. This
description only captures a sub-class of LEO constellations, but all
recently proposed constellations fit this sub-class.
Satellites also connect to each other, using laser inter-satellite
links (ISLs). An end-end path between two GSes comprises a radio
up-link from the source GS to the ingress satellite, followed by
zero or more laser ISLs, and then the egress radio down-link to the
destination GS.
2.2 The largest proposed constellations
To add concrete numbers to the above abstract description of LEO
constellations, we describe the design parameters for the largest
three proposed constellations.
SpaceX Starlink: Table. 1 details the first phase of Starlink, with
4,409 satellites planned across 5 orbital shells [66‚Äì69]. SpaceX is
currently deploying S1, with 1,584 satellites (72 orbits, each with
22 satellites), ‚Ñé = 550 km, and ùëñ = 53¬∞. The minimum elevation,
ùëô = 25¬∞. S1 will cover most of the world‚Äôs population, but will not
extend service to less populated regions at high latitudes. This
