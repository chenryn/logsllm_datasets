User: How to find and repair errors in system files in Windows system?
Assistant: Windows has a built-in tool called "System File Checker (SFC)" that can be used to find and fix errors in system files. Here are the steps to use the SFC command: 1. Open a command prompt. In Windows 10, you can right-click the Start button and select the “Command Prompt (Admin)” option. 2. Enter the command "sfc /scannow" and press Enter. This command scans the entire system files, looking for and fixing errors. 3. Wait for the scan to complete, it may take some time. Once the scan is complete, it will display details of any errors or issues. If no errors are found, the message: "Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations" will be displayed. 4. If any errors are found, the SFC command attempts to repair them. You may have to wait a while for this process to complete. Note: If you encounter larger errors or problems, more advanced tools and methods may be required to resolve them. At the same time, Windows also provides some other system repair tools, such as the DISM command (Deployment Image Servicing and Management), which can be used to repair system image files, clean up component storage, and so on. However, these tools require corresponding professional ability and experience, and are not recommended for non-professionals.
