##### ISSUE TYPE
  * Bug Report
##### COMPONENT NAME
replace module
##### ANSIBLE VERSION
    ansible 2.3.1.0
      config file = /home/klaus/.ansible.cfg
      configured module search path = Default w/o overrides
      python version = 2.7.13+ (default, Jul 19 2017, 18:15:03) [GCC 6.4.0 20170704]
##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
LC_*=de_DE (without utf-8, so it is iso8859-1)
##### SUMMARY
I have the following part:
    - name: Keep all passwd-entries in /etc/password sane
      replace:
         dest: /etc/passwd
         regexp: '^([^:]+):[^:]*:'
         replace: '\1:x:'
This worked with earlier versions but now it fails with an error:
    An exception occurred during task execution. To see the full traceback, use -vvv. The error was: UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf8' codec can't decode byte 0xee in position 668: invalid continuation byte
The problem is that I have user full names in passwd that includes latin1
chars (like Ã¯)
##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
