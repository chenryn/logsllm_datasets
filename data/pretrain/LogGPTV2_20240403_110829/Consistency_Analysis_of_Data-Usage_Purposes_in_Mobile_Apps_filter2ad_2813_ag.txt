A SEMANTIC ARGUMENTS OF PURPOSE
CLAUSES
Semantic arguments of an event do not change even though the
syntactic structure of the sentence changes. For example, let us
consider the following sentences which express a data-usage event:
‚Ä¢ [We]Arg0 do not [share]V [your personal data]Arg1 [with third
‚Ä¢ [Third parties]Arg0 may not [collect]V [your personal data]Arg1
parties]Arg2 [for targeted ads]Argm-Pnc;
[to deliver targeted ads]Argm-Pnc.
While the purpose of delivering targeted ads is stated differently in
noun and verb phrases starting with for and to, it is consistently an
Argm-Pnc (purpose-not-cause) argument of the predicate. The data
object your personal data is also an Arg1 in both cases.
Table 12 lists the predicate-specific semantic arguments of pur-
pose clauses used in addition to the common arguments Argm-Prp
and Argm-Pnc.

D PURPOSE APPROXIMATION PROOF
The following is the proof of Theorem 6.6.
Proof.
(1) Because ùëûùëñ ‚âàùúÖ ùëû ùëó, exists ùëû‚Ä≤ such as ùëû‚Ä≤ <ùúÖ ùëûùëñ
and ùëû‚Ä≤ <ùúÖ ùëû ùëó. Therefore, (ùëíùëñ, ùëû‚Ä≤) <ùúã (ùëíùëñ, ùëûùëñ) and (ùëíùëñ, ùëû‚Ä≤) <ùúã
(ùëí ùëó , ùëû ùëó). The existence of ùëù‚Ä≤ = (ùëíùëñ, ùëû‚Ä≤) implies ùëùùëñ = (ùëíùëñ, ùëûùëñ) ‚âàùúã
ùëù ùëó = (ùëí ùëó , ùëû ùëó).
(2) Because ùëûùëñ ‚âàùúÖ ùëû ùëó, exists ùëû‚Ä≤ such as ùëû‚Ä≤ <ùúÖ ùëûùëñ and ùëû‚Ä≤ <ùúÖ ùëû ùëó.
Therefore, (ùëíùëñ, ùëû‚Ä≤) <ùúã (ùëíùëñ, ùëûùëñ). Also, because given ùëíùëñ <ùúñ ùëí ùëó,
so (ùëíùëñ, ùëû‚Ä≤) <ùúã (ùëí ùëó , ùëû ùëó). The existence of ùëù‚Ä≤ = (ùëíùëñ, ùëû‚Ä≤) implies
ùëùùëñ = (ùëíùëñ, ùëûùëñ) ‚âàùúã ùëù ùëó = (ùëí ùëó , ùëû ùëó).
(3) The proof is similar to (2) with the roles of entities ùëíùëñ and ùëí ùëó
swapped with purposes ùëûùëñ and ùëû ùëó, respectively.
(4) The proof is similar to (3) with the roles of entities ùëíùëñ and ùëí ùëó

(5) Because ùëíùëñ ‚âàùúÖ ùëí ùëó, exists ùëí‚Ä≤ such as ùëí‚Ä≤ <ùúñ ùëíùëñ and ùëí‚Ä≤ <ùúÖ ùëí ùëó.

Therefore, (ùëí‚Ä≤, ùëû‚Ä≤) <ùúã (ùëíùëñ, ùëûùëñ) and (ùëí‚Ä≤, ùëû‚Ä≤) <ùúã (ùëí ùëó , ùëû ùëó). The
existence of ùëù‚Ä≤ = (ùëí‚Ä≤, ùëû‚Ä≤) implies ùëùùëñ = (ùëíùëñ, ùëûùëñ) ‚âàùúã ùëù ùëó =
(ùëí ùëó , ùëû ùëó).

E DATA FLOW PURPOSE FEATURES
Features used for inferring usage purposes of data flows are listed
in Table 15. The ablation study results are shown in Table 16.
F PRIVACY POLICY CRAWLER AND
PREPROCESSOR
A crawler was developed to scrap the privacy policies of Android
apps. Given an app ID, the crawler first searches for the privacy
policy URL in the metadata of the app on Google Play Store. A full
HTML version of the web page is scrapped by using Google Chrome
controlled by Puppeteer web driver [22] so that dynamically ren-
dered privacy notice contents are downloaded correctly. Finally, Pol-
icyLint‚Äôs open-source privacy policy HTML pre-processing tool [5]
was used to remove extraneous GUI elements and HTML tags and
extract a plain-text version that contains well-formed sentences
of the privacy policy. If the privacy policy classifier determines
that the downloaded document is not a privacy policy, the crawler
searches for a privacy link within the page and repeats the HTML
downloading and extraction process.
A classifier based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) is devel-
oped to determine whether the downloaded web document is a
privacy policy or not. The model is trained on a set of 375 docu-
ments (199 positive and 176 negative examples). The training and
validation used 5-fold cross validation while 15% of the documents
were held out for testing. The classifier achieved F1 scores of 98.12%
and 96.49% for validation and testing, respectively. Similar to Poli-
cyLint [7], we filtered out sentences that do not contain any data
practice verbs or data objects, and sentences that start with an
interrogative word.
G MAPPING PURPOSES OF MOBIPURPOSE
TO PURPLIANCE‚ÄôS PURPOSE TAXONOMY
The conversion from purpose categories in MobiPurpose to the
data-usage taxonomy of PurPliance is listed in Table 17.
H DOMAIN-ADAPTED NER MODEL
PurPliance uses a domain-adapted NER model to extract the data
objects and entities from sentences. We retrained the NER com-
ponent of the Spacy en_web_core_lg language model [20] on Poli-
cyLint‚Äôs dataset of 600 manually annotated sentences. 150 sentences
were randomly selected while the other 450 have one of the 9 sub-
sumptive relationship patterns. Similar to the procedure used in
PolicyLint [7], we trained the model on the training set of 500
samples until the loss converges after 180 epochs. The data object
recognition performance on the test set of 100 samples achieves an
83.1% F1 score (82.26% precision and 83.95% recall).
I DISTRIBUTION OF APPS AND POLICIES
Fig. 5 shows the distribution of apps and unique policies per app
category.
J DISTRIBUTION OF CAPTURED TRAFFIC
OVER APP CATEGORIES
Statistics of network traffic intercepted are shown in Fig. 6. The top
3 contacted domains are googleads.g.doubleclick.net with 230,309
requests, pagead2.googlesyndication.com with 86,767 requests, and
csi.gstatic.com with 73,939 requests. The traffic distribution has a
long tail: 13,269 (68.8%) domains were contacted by only one app
and 12,561 (65.1%) domains have less than 10 network data requests.

K DATASET FOR END-TO-END
CONTRADICTION DETECTION
K.1 Annotation Procedure
Contradictions in each privacy policy are identified as follows. We
first look for any sentences that contain negated sentiment either
in data collection/sharing or in purpose clauses as their occur-
rences are much less frequent than positive ones. For each negated
sentence found, we try to find as many contradictory positive state-
ments as possible. The common keywords in negated statements
include "not", "never", "only for", "only to", "solely". However, be-
cause negated statements are expressed in various ways and their
meanings can only be determined by the context, we need to read
the whole policies to search for negated statements. To fully inter-
pret the policy sentences, we checked the meaning of each word and
the contextual sentences of each identified statement to understand
the specific intention and meaning of the terms in the sentence. We
also consulted external regulatory texts for the definition of certain
data types when necessary.
K.2 Dataset
The apps selected for the evaluation of end-to-end contradiction
detection and their statistics are shown in Table 18. The app with
the most contradictory sentence pairs is au.com.realestate.app. It
contains a statement that "We do not collect sensitive information
as defined under the Privacy Act 1988("Privacy Act")." However,
because sensitive information is a type of personal information as
defined by the Privacy Act [49, 68], the broad negated-sentiment
statement have a narrowing-definition contradiction with many
other sentences about collection/sharing of personal information.
K.3 Evaluation of Privacy Statement Extraction
Experimental Procedure. We compare PurPliance‚Äôs performance
in extracting privacy statements from policy document sentences
with PolicyLint [7], a state-of-the-art extraction method. To avoid
test data leakage [36], 285k (20%) sentences in the corpus were
set aside as the test set while PurPliance was developed and
fine-tuned on the other 80% sentences. 300 sentences were then
randomly selected from the test set for evaluation. The privacy
statements of PurPliance and PolicyLint from their parameter ex-
traction step are used. We used PolicyLint‚Äôs public implementation
without any changes. The NER models used by both systems are
trained on the same dataset, and hence they have similar capabilities.
In addition, since PolicyLint does not support purpose extraction,
purposes extracted by PurPliance and their combinations are not
counted in this evaluation. Three of the authors annotated the sen-
tences. We used majority votes and held discussions to reach a
consensus about the correctness of the extracted statements.
Metrics. Since our goal is to minimize false positives, the pre-
cision and the number of extracted statements are used as the
main performance metrics. Different from creating a dataset of
contradictory sentences in Section 8.3, there are a large number of
possible text spans that express a data type or a receiving entity in
each sentence and limitations of the contiguous entity annotation.
Therefore, it requires a significant amount of effort to create a com-
plete dataset of annotations of all policy statements and control its
quality [15].
Results and Analysis. Our results show that PurPliance extracts
more privacy statements with higher precision than PolicyLint.
The precision of PurPliance is 0.91, higher than 0.82 of PolicyLint.
