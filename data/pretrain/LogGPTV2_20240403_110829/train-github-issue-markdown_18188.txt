### Apache Airflow Version
2.3.0 (latest released)

### Issue Description
When a soft link and a folder with the same name exist under the same root directory, both are treated as the same relative path. For example, consider the following directory structure within the `dags` folder:

```
dags/
  ├── .airflowignore
  ├── folder
  └── soft-links-to-folder -> folder
```

And the `.airflowignore` file contains:

```
folder/
```

In this case, both `folder` and `soft-links-to-folder` are ignored.

### Expected Behavior
Only the `folder` should be ignored, while `soft-links-to-folder` should not. This was the expected behavior in Airflow 2.2.4 before the upgrade. The issue seems to arise because both `_RegexpIgnoreRule` and `_GlobIgnoreRule` use the `relative_to` method to get the search path.

### Steps to Reproduce
Please refer to @tirkarthi's comment for the test case.
