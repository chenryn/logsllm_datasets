### Apache Airflow version
2.3.0 (latest released)
### What happened
Soft link and folder under same root folder will be handled as the same
relative path. Say i have dags folder which looks like this:
    -dags:
      -- .airflowignore
      -- folder
      -- soft-links-to-folder -> folder
and .airflowignore:
    folder/
both folder and soft-links-to-folder will be ignored.
### What you think should happen instead
Only the folder should be ignored. This is the expected behavior in airflow
2.2.4, before i upgraded. ~~The root cause is that both _RegexpIgnoreRule and
_GlobIgnoreRule is calling`relative_to` method to get search path.~~
