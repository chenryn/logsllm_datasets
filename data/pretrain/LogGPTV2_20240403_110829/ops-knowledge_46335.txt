User: How to defend against and respond to common network attacks (such as DDoS, SQL injection)?
Assistant: 1. DDoS defense and response: - Install firewall, intrusion detection system and anti-virus software. - Establish a disaster recovery mechanism, back up key data, and ensure the continuous operation of the business. - Control network access according to security policies, limit traffic, and use traffic cleaning devices to mitigate attacks. - Deploy distributed reverse proxy, expose the real IP of public network services, and strengthen defense through CDN acceleration. - Plan emergency response plans in advance, detect attacks in time and take measures to block attacks as soon as possible. 2. SQL injection defense and response: - Conduct security assessment on the code and fix vulnerabilities. The input data provided by the user must be strictly filtered in the code. - Use parameterized queries and ensure that the program only accepts input of the programmed type to avoid loopholes caused by data type conversion. - Set database security policies and access rules to restrict users from accessing the database. - Turn on the security log function to monitor the database operation behavior and respond in time. - Update and upgrade the database system to fix known vulnerabilities. In addition, keeping the system, software and services updated in a timely manner, and using security hardening tools to harden the system are also key measures to ensure information security.
