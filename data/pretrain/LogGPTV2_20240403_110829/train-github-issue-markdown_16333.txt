I encountered a missing attribute bug while using matplotlib 1.5.3 on linux.
New to the community so apologies if this isn't the right way to raise the
issue, I did read the [coding guidelines]
(http://matplotlib.org/devel/coding_guide.html) but it was still unclear for
small bugfixes what the procedure is.
I found I was getting a missing `_facecolor2d` attribute error in the Patch3D
class in mplot3d/art3d.py. It seems like the attribute just wasn't being set
so I added it (diff below) and it resolved the problem.
There is a FIXME comment related to facecolor2d just below this point in the
code, so someone may have had another fix in mind.
