User: I have quite a few years experience of developing PHP web applications, and have recently started to delve into Python as well. Recently I've been interested in getting into desktop applications as well, but have absolutely no experience in that area. I've seen very little written about PHP-gtk and wonder whether it's really a good area to get stuck in to.
What I'm really looking for is something that will allow me to quite quickly develop some decent small/medium sized apps, and be able to deploy them in Linux and Windows. Something in Python or PHP would be great (but I'd be happy to learn something else if it has big advantages).
What do you guys recommend?
Thanks
Assistant: Python and Java are both excellent for working on both Linux and Windows environment. They are generally hassle-free as long as you're not doing any OS specific type of work. Python for creating desktop apps is fairly simple and easy to learn as well if you're coming from a PHP background, especially if you're used to doing object oriented PHP.
