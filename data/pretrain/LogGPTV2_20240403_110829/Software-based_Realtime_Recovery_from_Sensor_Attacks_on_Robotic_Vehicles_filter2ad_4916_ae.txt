### Parameter Values and Thresholds

- **Observations:**
  - For a given window, a larger threshold results in fewer false positives (FPs) but more false negatives (FNs).
  - For a given threshold, a larger window size leads to more FPs and fewer FNs.
  - The parameter values selected by our strategy (detailed in Section 3.3) result in zero FPs and FNs.

### External Force (Wind) Corrections

**Figure 13:** External force estimation and correction for different wind conditions.

- **Simulation Setup:**
  - A simulated APM quadrotor flying north.
  - Simulated windy conditions using a simulated RV.
  - **Constant Wind:**
    - Southward wind with a constant velocity of 29 mph (Beaufort scale 6).
    - The real acceleration measurement is lower than the software sensor due to the wind.
    - Error correction: Subtract the average error in a window from the following window predictions (Figure 13a).
  - **Dynamic Wind:**
    - Randomly generated wind portions with varying speeds (10-30 mph), directions (N, S, E, W), and durations (2-10 seconds).
    - Error correction under dynamic wind (Figure 13b).

### Multiple Sensor Attacks and Results

- **Combinatorial Attacks on Heterogeneous Sensors:**
  - Attacking all sensors of the same type simultaneously.
  - **Table 3:**
    - GPS and Barometer attacks: Vehicle can be recovered.
    - Gyroscope attacks (C3, C5, C6): Short recovery duration (3 seconds).
  - **Gyroscope Recovery:**
    - Single gyro attack (T1) and majority gyros attack (T2) without supplementary compensation.
    - All gyro sensors compromised: Recovery with complementary approach, increasing recovery duration.
    - Traditional fail-safe mechanism (TMR) fails when the majority of gyro sensors are compromised.

### Compensation Approach

- **To Increase Recovery Duration:**
  - Combine gyroscope readings with other sensor types.
  - **Figure 15:**
    - Internal state (roll rate) changes during recovery with and without compensation.
    - Without compensation: Small errors accumulate, causing significant oscillation.
    - With compensation: More stable roll rate and longer recovery duration.

### Wind Effects and Attack Scale

- **Error Evaluation:**
  - Different wind speeds (0-35 mph) and attack scales (5-90 deg/s).
  - **Recovery Duration:**
    - Measured with ε = 3 and maximum t = 20.
    - **Figure 16:**
      - Small and moderate wind (0-15 mph): Small errors.
      - Strong wind (>20 mph): Significant errors, exceeding the recovery threshold (=38).
      - Recovery duration: At least 10 seconds with small/moderate wind, significantly reduced with strong wind.

### Case Studies

- **3DR Solo:**
  - **Gyroscope Attack:**
    - Takeoff and hover, then attack on gyroscope sensors.
    - Without recovery: Immediate crash.
    - With recovery: Software sensor prevents crash, maintains hovering position.
  - **GPS Attack:**
    - Waypoint navigation mission.
    - Attack: Modified longitude positional information.
    - Without recovery: Deviation from trajectory.
    - With recovery: Continues planned mission with marginal deviation.

- **Erle-Rover:**
  - **Random GPS Attack:**
    - Inject random signals to compromise positional information.
    - Recovery: Software sensor replaces compromised measurements, vehicle continues intended trajectory.
  - **Controlled GPS Attack:**
    - Maliciously crafted signal based on estimated rover states.
    - During sharp turn: Attack detected, software sensor activated, drift stopped but not fully compensated.

### Discussion

- **Recovery Duration:**
  - Drift during recovery is inevitable.
  - Operation time in recovery mode: At least 10 seconds, sufficient for emergency operations.
- **Advanced Attacks:**
  - Small-error attacks (carry-off attacks) can be detected and prevented.
  - Defense against precise modeling: Avoid predictable navigation plans, use historical error changes for detection.

### Related Work

- **Inspiration:**
  - Traditional hardware and software fault-tolerant techniques.
  - Redundancy-based approaches: Recover system if less than half of components fail.
  - Physical attack detection techniques: Focus on anomaly detection, lack recovery mechanisms.
- **State Estimation:**
  - Well-researched in control engineering to improve noisy sensor accuracy.
