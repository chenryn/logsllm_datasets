**ATT&CK ID: T0819**  
**ATT&CK Technique Name: Exploit Public-Facing Application**

Adversaries may exploit vulnerabilities in internet-facing software to gain initial access to an industrial network. This software can include user applications, underlying networking implementations, and the operating systems of exposed assets. Additionally, weak security defenses can also be targeted. These internet-facing systems are often intentionally exposed to enable remote management and monitoring.
