# Bitsquatting: DNS Hijacking Without Exploitation

## Overview
- **Author:** Artem Dinaburg
- **Conference:** DEF CON 19
- **About the Presentation:**
  - This presentation discusses a technique called bitsquatting, which is a form of domain name squatting that exploits bit errors in memory to redirect DNS requests.

## The Problem
- **Affected Platforms:** 
  - Bitsquatting can affect any platform that relies on DNS for domain resolution.
- **Low Skill and Cost:**
  - Bitsquatting requires minimal technical skill and is relatively inexpensive to implement.

### Understanding Bitsquatting
- **Bitsquatting vs. Typosquatting:**
  - **Typosquatting** involves registering domain names that are misspellings of popular domains.
  - **Bitsquatting** involves exploiting bit errors in memory to register similar domain names.
- **Daily DNS Requests:**
  - An average person makes approximately 1500 DNS requests per day, with only about 3 of them being manually typed.

### Example of Bit Errors
- **Binary Representation:**
  - `C N N . C O M` -> `01100011 01101110 01101110 00101110 01100011 01101111 01101110`
  - `C O N . C O M` -> `01100011 01101111 01101110 00101110 01100011 01101111 01101110`

### Causes of Bit Errors
- **Heat:**
  - High operating temperatures can cause bit errors. For example, an iPhone's operating temperature can range from 0°F to 120°F.
- **Electrical Problems:**
  - Power fluctuations and electrical noise can also lead to bit errors.
- **Defects:**
  - Manufacturing defects in hardware components can result in bit errors.
- **Cosmic Rays:**
  - Cosmic rays can cause single-event upsets (SEUs) in memory, leading to bit errors.

### DRAM Failure Rates
- **Ultra-Low Failure Rates:**
  - DRAM failure rates are typically very low, but they can still occur. For example, a PC with 4 GiB of DRAM may experience errors.
- **Manufacturing Data:**
  - Various manufacturers report different failure rates for their DRAM modules. For instance, Micron estimates a 256 Mbytes module to have a certain failure rate.

### Experiment
- **Step 1: Domain Registration**
  - Registering bitsquatted domains such as `ikamai.net`, `aeazon.com`, `a-azon.com`, `amazgn.com`, `microsmft.com`, etc.
- **Step 2: Traffic Analysis**
  - Analyzing the traffic to these bitsquatted domains to identify unique IP addresses and traffic patterns.
- **Step 3: Event Detection**
  - Identifying significant events in the traffic data, such as spikes or anomalies.

### Traffic Volume
- **Unique IPs Over Time:**
  - Graph showing the number of unique IP addresses accessing the bitsquatted domains over a period of several months.
- **Operating System Statistics:**
  - Breakdown of operating systems used by visitors, with Windows, Mac, iPhone, Linux, and Android being the most common.

### Where Bit Errors Happen
- **DNS Path:**
  - Bit errors can occur in the DNS path, affecting domain resolution.
- **Content Path:**
  - Bit errors can also occur in the content path, affecting data integrity.

### Mitigations
- **Error-Correcting Code (ECC):**
  - Using ECC memory can help mitigate bit errors, but it is not foolproof.
- **Other Mitigations:**
  - Implementing robust error detection and correction mechanisms at various levels of the system.
