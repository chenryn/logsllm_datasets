It seems you are encountering an issue when trying to use a specific resource pool name in your playbook, even though the resource pool exists and can be discovered using `pysphere`. Hereâ€™s a more detailed and professional way to describe and address the problem:

---

### Issue Description

I am unable to use a specific resource pool name in my playbook. The only resource pool name that works is:
```yaml
resource_pool: "/Resources"
```
However, I have verified that the desired resource pool, `databases_pool`, exists and can be discovered using the `pysphere` library. Here is the code I used to verify its existence:

```python
from pysphere import VIServer

s = VIServer()
s.connect("host", 'user', 'password')
vm = s.get_vm_by_name('vm_name')
print(vm.get_resource_pool_name())
```

This code correctly prints the name of the resource pool, but when I try to use it in my playbook, I receive the following error:

```plaintext
TASK: [vsphere_guest]
********************************************************
failed: [localhost] => {"failed": true}
msg: Cannot find Resource Pool named: databases_pool
```

### Playbook Configuration

Here is the relevant part of my playbook where I am trying to use the `databases_pool` resource pool:

```yaml
- name: Create VM
  vsphere_guest:
    vcenter_hostname: "vcenter_host"
    username: "user"
    password: "password"
    validate_certs: no
    name: "new_vm"
    state: poweredon
    template: "template_name"
    datacenter: "datacenter_name"
    cluster: "cluster_name"
    resource_pool: "databases_pool"
    folder: "/vm"
    disk:
      - size_gb: 20
        type: thin
    hardware:
      memory_mb: 1024
      num_cpus: 2
```

### Steps Taken

1. Verified the existence of the `databases_pool` resource pool using `pysphere`.
2. Confirmed that the `resource_pool` parameter works with the default `/Resources` value.
3. Ensured that the `databases_pool` name is correctly specified in the playbook.

### Request for Assistance

Could you please help me understand why the `databases_pool` resource pool cannot be found in the playbook, despite being discoverable via `pysphere`? Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
