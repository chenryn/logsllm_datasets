User: In eclipse, I'm used to configuring the buildpath for versions of java installed on my computer. 
I recently added Python 3.5 to my computer and want to use it in place of the default 2.7 that Macs automatically include.
How can I configure my build path on PyDev, if there is such as concept to begin with, for the plugin? I've found that Python 3.5 is located at/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/; how can I now change PyDev to use it?
Assistant: First check whether python3.5 is auto-configured in eclipse.
Go to Window>Preferences 
On the preferences window you will find PyDev configurations on left pan.
PyDev>Interpreters>Python Interpreter
If python3.5 is not listed you can either add using "Quick Auto-Config" or if you want to add manually click "New" then add give the interpreter name (ex:Py3.5) and then browse to the path of python executable (In your case inside /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/)
Once you have configured your interpreter in PyDev then you can change the interpreter of your project.
Right click on your project>Properties
On the left pan click PyDev-Interpreter.In that select the name of the  PythonInterpreter(Py3.5) which you previously configured and you can also select the grammar version.
