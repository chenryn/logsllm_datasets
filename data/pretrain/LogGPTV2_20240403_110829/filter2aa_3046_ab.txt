### Conclusions on MAC Flooding Attacks

The study concluded that, under both tested conditions, the free version of Microsoft Hyper-V 2008 was not affected by the MAC flooding attack. This is because it is built upon a minimal version of Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2, known as Server Core. The Server Core version provides the same level of network protection as the full version but only allows for the installation of specific server roles, such as the Hyper-V hypervisor.

#### VMware vSphere (ESXi) 5.5 - Free Edition
All testing within the VMware vSphere environment was conducted identically to previous trials to ensure consistency. The tests were performed using the default virtual networking configuration in the free version of ESXi. The results indicated that this configuration was not vulnerable to the MAC flooding attack, meaning a malicious user could not eavesdrop on another tenant's network traffic. However, due to the VMware End User License Agreement [16], we are unable to publish any performance-related results observed during the test.

### Summary of MAC Flooding Results
Table III summarizes the results of the MAC flooding attacks across seven test environments. It is evident that any virtualized network environment using the Open vSwitch virtual switch is potentially vulnerable to MAC flooding attacks, which can expose client traffic to eavesdropping. Therefore, if a virtual machine is transmitting sensitive information over a virtual network that uses Open vSwitch, precautions such as encryption should be taken to ensure the confidentiality of the data in transit.

| **Platform** | **Eavesdropping Allowed** | **Performance Impacted** |
|--------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| OS Xen w/ Linux Bridging | ✔ | - |
| OS Xen w/ Open vSwitch 1.11.0 | ✔ | ✔ |
| OS Xen w/ Open vSwitch 2.0.0 | ✔ | ✔ |
| Citrix XenServer 6.2 | ✔ | ✔ |
| MS Server 2008 R2 w/Hyper-V | - | - |
| MS Hyper-V 2008 Free | - | - |
| VMware vSphere (ESXi) 5.5 | N/A | N/A |

In February 2015, we notified the Open vSwitch security team of our findings. They confirmed the vulnerability and promptly released a patch [17], [18] to address the issue. The patch has since been merged into all major branches of Open vSwitch from version 2.0.0 onward [19]. However, it is important to note that the current virtual switch implementation in Citrix XenServer has not been updated to include the patched version of Open vSwitch. We recommend that any environment running an unpatched version of Open vSwitch, particularly those prior to the 2.0.0 branch, should be upgraded immediately, given that both the vulnerability and the exploitation technique have been made public.

### DHCP Attacks
Layer 2 DHCP attacks involve placing a rogue DHCP server on a network to trick clients into associating with it instead of the legitimate DHCP server. Once a client receives an IP address lease from the malicious DHCP server, it can be configured with a poisoned DNS server, an incorrect default gateway, or forced to run malicious code. This type of attack can cause Denial of Service (DoS) situations, duplicate addressing, or man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks, where traffic is first sent to an attacker and then forwarded to the original destination.

To evaluate the impact of these Layer 2 DHCP attacks, four different attack scenarios were replicated across the seven test environments. In the first scenario, the DNSMasq server was set up to pass option 100 to clients, which was configured to exploit the shellshock vulnerability. The following code was added to the `/etc/dnsmasq.conf` file on the DHCP server as a proof of concept:

```bash
dhcp-option-force=100,() { :; }; /bin/echo 'Testing shellshock vulnerability' > /tmp/shellshock_test
```

In the second scenario, the DNSMasq server was used to seed the minimal shellshock client with a poisoned DNS server through DHCP. The rogue DHCP server also functioned as the poisoned DNS server, redirecting traffic destined for `www.gmail.com` to a malicious web server (Figure 6). A command-line web browser, `elinks`, was used in the shellshock virtual machine to visit `www.gmail.com` and observe the effect.

In the third scenario, the DHCP server was configured to pass a bad default gateway address (1.1.1.1) to clients, causing a DoS attack for access to subnets outside the existing broadcast domain. In the fourth scenario, the DHCP server was set to point clients to a second virtual machine configured as a router, directing traffic to a malicious honeynet (Figure 7). This, combined with a poisoned DNS server, allowed the attacker to direct traffic to malicious servers within the honeynet.

### Summary of DHCP Attack Results
Table IV illustrates the results of the four DHCP attack scenarios across the seven test environments. In all tested environments, there was no protection provided against the attacks in their default configurations.

### Related Work
There has been extensive research on the vulnerability of physical networks to Layer 2 attacks [13], [21], [22], [23]. However, the impact on virtual networks has received less attention. This is beneficial because the published research on physical networks can serve as a model for testing in virtual environments and for making comparisons based on physical baselines. For example, Yeung et al. [13] provide an overview of popular Layer 2 networking attacks and the tools used to perform them. Altunbasak et al. [21] describe various attacks on local and metropolitan area networks and suggest adding a security tag to the Ethernet frame for additional protection. Cisco's white paper [22] on VLAN security in their Catalyst series of switches discusses best practices and mitigation techniques for preventing these attacks on physical switches.

### Future Work
Future work will focus on evaluating other Layer 2 networking attacks in these environments and developing mitigation techniques and hardening strategies to enhance network security in virtualized environments. We are also interested in collaborating with cloud service providers to assess the vulnerability of their platforms to these attacks. It is essential to conduct such experiments with the permission and cooperation of the cloud service provider. These results highlight the need for users to ask cloud service providers about the additional defenses they provide to protect against these types of attacks.

### Conclusion
This study demonstrates the vulnerability of virtual switches to Layer 2 network attacks. The described vulnerabilities target virtual networking devices rather than the hypervisor. Without additional mitigation or preventive measures, these attacks can be performed on any host running a virtual switch, including in multi-tenant environments. Further research is needed to conduct a comprehensive Layer 2 security assessment of virtual networking devices. This information can be used to develop hardening and mitigation techniques to secure virtual networks against common Layer 2 threats. In their current state, virtual switches pose the same risks as their physical counterparts in terms of network security. A single malicious virtual machine performing a MAC flooding attack could compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of co-located clients.
