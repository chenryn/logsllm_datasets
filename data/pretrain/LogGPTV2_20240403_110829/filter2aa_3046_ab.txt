concluded that under both conditions the free version of
Microsoft Hyper-V 2008 was also unaffected by the MAC
ﬂooding attack since it is built upon a minimal version of
Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 entitled Server Core.
The Core version of Microsoft Server 2008 R2 still provides
the same level of network protection as the full version, but
only allows for the installation of speciﬁc server roles to the
operating system[15], in this case the Hyper-V hypervisor.
6) VMware vSphere (ESXi) 5.5 - free edition: All testing
within the VMware vSphere environment was performed iden-
tically to the previous trials for completeness. Testing was
performed on the free version of ESXi using the default virtual
networking conﬁguration. The results show that this particular
conﬁguration was not vulnerable to the MAC ﬂooding attack
in terms of a malicious user being able to eavesdrop on another
tenant’s network trafﬁc. Due to the VMware end user license
agreement[16] we are prevented from publishing any of the
performance related results that were observed during the test.
7) Summary of MAC Flooding Results: It can clearly
be seen from the results summarized in Table III that any
virtualized network environment built upon the Open vSwitch
virtual switch could be vulnerable to MAC ﬂooding attacks,
and has the potential to expose its client trafﬁc to eavesdrop-
ping. Therefore, if a virtual machine is transmitting sensitive
information over a virtual network that uses Open vSwitch
precautions should be taken such as using encryption in order
to ensure that the information in transit remains conﬁdential.

N/A
It should also be noted that in February of 2015 we
notiﬁed the Open vSwitch security team of our discovery. They
conﬁrmed the vulnerability and immediately responded with
a patch[17], [18] to resolve the issue. Since then the patch
has been merged into every major branch of Open vSwitch
from 2.0.0 on[19]. With that stated, it is important to recognize
that at this time the current virtual switch implementation in
Citrix XenServer has not been updated to a patched version of
Open vSwitch. It is our recommendation that any environment
running any version of Open vSwitch prior to the patched
version of the 2.0.0 branch should be upgraded immediately,
since both the vulnerability and exploitation technique have
been made public.
B. DHCP Attacks
In order to perform a Layer 2 DHCP attack, an attacker
must place a rogue DHCP server on a network in hopes
that clients in the broadcast domain associate with it rather
than the legitimate DHCP server. Once a client receives an
IP address lease from a malicious DHCP server under an
attacker’s control, that client could also be seeded with the
IP address of a poisoned DNS server, an incorrect default
gateway, or be forced to run malicious code. This type of attack
could also cause DoS situations where duplicate addressing
occurs on the network causing the resources bound to those
addresses to be inaccessible, or allow for the execution of man-
in-the-middle attacks where trafﬁc is ﬁrst sent to an attacker
and then onto the original destination. These attacks can be
mitigated by enforcing static addressing, or by employing
DHCP snooping on physical switches as well as DHCP server
authorization within Active Directory environments.
Four different attack scenarios were duplicated across each
of the seven test environments in order to evaluate the impact
of these Layer 2 DHCP attacks. In the ﬁrst scenario, the
DNSMasq server was setup to pass option 100 to clients which
was conﬁgured to leverage the shellshock exploit in order to
remotely execute the echo command with root privileges on the
target machine and place text into a ﬁle in /tmp. The following
code was placed into the /etc/dnsmasq.conf ﬁle on the DHCP
server as a proof of concept to illustrate the vulnerability
without damaging the client system.
dhcp-option-force=100,() { :; }; /bin/echo \\
’Testing shellshock vulnerability’>/tmp/shellshock_test
For the second scenario, the DNSMasq server was used
to seed the minimal shellshock client with a poisoned DNS
server through DHCP. Since DNSMasq also provides DNS
server functionality the rogue DHCP server doubled as the
poisoned DNS server that was passed to clients receiving
addresses. The DNS server was setup to direct all trafﬁc
destined to www.gmail.com to be redirected to the malicious
web server (Figure 6). A command line web browser called
elinks[20] was then used in the shellshock virtual machine to
visit www.gmail.com in order to observe the effect.
Lastly, the DHCP server was conﬁgured to pass a bad
default gateway address to clients that obtained their network
conﬁguration from it. First, it was set to pass 1.1.1.1 as the
default gateway with the intention of causing a DoS attack for
access of subnets outside of the existing broadcast domain.
Second, the DHCP server was conﬁgured to point clients to
the second virtual machine that was setup as a router to direct

trafﬁc to a malicious honeynet (Figure 7). This in conjunction
with a poisoned DNS server allows the attacker to direct trafﬁc
to malicious servers setup within the honeynet. In each case,
the previously used web server was placed in the honeynet,
and a DNS entry was setup to direct trafﬁc to it through the
rogue default gateway.

the results of all four DHCP attack scenarios that were run
within each test environment. In all of the environments we
tested, there was no protection provided against the attacks in
their default conﬁgurations.

RELATED WORK
There has already been a substantial amount of work study-
ing the vulnerability of physical networks to Layer 2 attacks
[13], [21], [22], [23], but the impact on virtual networks has not
received as much attention. This is beneﬁcial in the fact that
published research previously performed on physical networks
can serve as a model for testing in virtual environments and
comparisons can be made based upon the physical baselines.
For instance, Yeung et al.[13] provide an overview of the most
popular Layer 2 networking attacks as well as descriptions of
the tools used to perform them. This work was very helpful
in identifying possible attack vectors that could be emulated
within a virtualized environment. Altunbasak et al.[21] also
describe various attacks that can be performed on local and
metropolitan area networks, as well as the authors’ idea of
adding a security tag to the Ethernet frame for additional
protection. Cisco also published a white paper[22] regarding
VLAN security in their Catalyst series of switches. The paper
discloses testing that was performed on the switches in August
of 2002 by an outside security research ﬁrm @stake which
was acquired by Symantec in 2004. In the white paper, they
discussed many of the same attacks that were mentioned by
Yeung et al.[13], however the authors also went into detail
about best practices and mitigation techniques that could be
implemented on the physical switches in order to prevent the
attacks from being successful.
VI.
FUTURE WORK
Going forward, we intend to evaluate other Layer 2 net-
working attacks within these environments as well as develop
mitigation techniques and hardening strategies that will con-
tribute to an increased level of network security in virtualized
environments. We also are especially interested in working
with cloud service providers to assess the vulnerability of
their platforms to these attacks. Understandably, it is unac-
ceptable to run such experiments without the permission and
cooperation of the cloud service provider. We hope that these
results highlight that users should have the right to ask cloud
service providers to document what additional defenses - either
prevention or detection - if any they are providing to protect
users from these types of attacks on their systems.
VII.
CONCLUSION
This study demonstrates the degree to which virtual
switches are vulnerable to Layer 2 network attacks. The Layer
2 vulnerabilities described in this paper are directed towards
the virtual networking devices and not the hypervisor and
without additional mitigation or preventive measures, could
be performed on any host running a virtual switch including
in a multi-tenant environment. Further study is necessary in
order to perform a full Layer 2 security assessment on the
state of virtual networking devices. The information could
then be used to develop hardening and mitigation techniques
focused on securing virtual networks against common Layer 2
networking threats. In their current state, virtual switches pose
the same liability as their physical counterparts in terms of
network security. One malicious virtual machine performing a
MAC ﬂooding attack against the virtual switch could be able
to sniff all trafﬁc passing over that virtual switch, potentially
compromising the conﬁdentiality, integrity, and availability of
co-located clients.
