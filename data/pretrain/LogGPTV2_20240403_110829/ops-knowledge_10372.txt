Question: A web application processes user-submitted dates in the format of 'MM/DD/YYYY'. An attacker realizes that when a date input contains letters (e.g., 'AB/CD/EFGH'), the application does not perform proper validation and processes this input in an unintended way, which leads to unauthorized access to sensitive data. What could be the primary reason for this security breach?
"A": "The application does not sanitize user input, allowing script injection.",
"B": "The application incorrectly assumes all input will be in the correct date format, leading to a type confusion error.",
"C": "The application uses weak encryption for user input, enabling attackers to decrypt sensitive information.",
"D": "The application's access control relies on client-side verification, which can be bypassed."
Answer: B
