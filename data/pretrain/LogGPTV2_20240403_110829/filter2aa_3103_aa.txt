### Agenda
1. Strategy Journey: Who Wins?
2. Attack Life Cycle Primer
3. Why Study Attack Lifecycles?
4. Effective Defensive Strategies
5. Exercises in Building Out Your Defensive Strategies
6. Additional Insights

### Strategy Journey
- **Background**: A CIO once asked me, "Do they win?"
- **Challenge**: Later, I was tasked with evaluating a solution for over 300,000 endpoints.
- **Approach**: I reviewed requirements, functions, capabilities, and operationalization.
- **Outcome**: The resulting heat map was not very useful for large-scale decision-making.
- **Reflection**: The question "Do they win?" led me to develop better strategic choices.

### Lockheed Martin Kill Chain Phases ™
1. **Reconnaissance**:
   - Research, ID/selection of targets
   - Email addresses, social relationships
   - Target technology & topology
2. **Weaponization**:
   - Combining an exploit with a payload to establish/maintain access by the attacker
3. **Delivery**:
   - Transmission of weapon to target environment
4. **Exploitation**:
   - Exploit is triggered on the target
5. **Installation**:
   - Payload is executed
6. **Command and Control**:
   - Communication and control established between attacker and target
7. **Act on Objectives**:
   - Recon/Pivot, Destruction, Exfiltration, Humiliate, PlantInfo, DoS, Ransom/Deface

### Tortuosa Concept: Charting Attacker's Progression
- **Phases**:
  - Recon
  - Weaponization
  - Delivery
  - Exploit
  - Install
  - Command and Control
  - Act on Objective
- **Attack Execution Over Time**:
  - Persistence Disruption
  - Tool Unavailability
  - Orchestrated False Targets

### Attacking the Attacker’s Plan
- **Strategies**:
  - **Time**: Replays, Snapshots, Predecessors and Successors – feigning completion
  - **Resources and Tools**: Create resource unavailability, contention, and flood targets
  - **Scope**: Create scope creep with deception using fake targets or tarpits
  - **Cost**: Increase the cost to the attacker, thereby decreasing the cost to the defender
  - **Quality**: Create noise and anomalies to disrupt attackers, automation, and scripts

### Mapped Attack Patterns
- **Examples**:
  - Axiom, Cleaver, Dark Hotel, FIN4, 02Hero, SAPU4ALL, StuckOnUrDC

### Building the Attacker Deck
- **Catalog of Attack Patterns**:
  - **Persistence**: New service, modification of existing service
  - **Privilege Escalation**: Exploitation of vulnerability, OS/Software weakness
  - **Credential Access**: Service file permissions weakness, user interaction
  - **Host Enumeration**: Process enumeration, software packing
  - **Defense Evasion**: Masquerading, Windows admin shares (C$, ADMIN$)
  - **Lateral Movement**: RDP, DLL Proxying, service registry permissions weakness
  - **Command and Control**: SSL connection over arbitrary port, HTTP/HTTPS posts back to attacker C&C host
  - **Exfiltration**: Data transfer via DNS query, documents sent back to attacker

### Conclusion
- By understanding and mapping the attack life cycle, we can develop more effective defensive strategies.
- Disrupting the attacker’s project plan through time, resources, scope, cost, and quality can significantly enhance our cyber resilience.
