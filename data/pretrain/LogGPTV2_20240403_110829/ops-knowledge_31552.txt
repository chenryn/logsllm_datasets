Assistant: This log chunk shows the executor running tasks 21.0, 22.0, 23.0, and 24.0 in stage 29.0, with the corresponding task ids 1341, 1342, 1343, and 1344. The storage block manager found blocks rdd_42_20, rdd_42_21, rdd_42_22, rdd_42_23, and rdd_42_24 locally. The PythonRunner reported times for total, boot, init, and finish. Finally, the executor finished tasks 21.0, 22.0, and 23.0, sending 2128, 2171, and 2171 bytes of result to the driver, respectively.
