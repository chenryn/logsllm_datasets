User: Describe the entire process of building a Dockerfile image
Assistant: 1. First, create a directory to store the application and various files used in the construction process; 2. Then, create a Dockerfile in this directory. It is generally recommended that the file name of the Dockerfile is Dockerfile; 3. Write the Dockerfile , write instructions, for example, use the FORM instruction to specify the base image, the COPY instruction to copy files, the RUN instruction to specify the command to run, ENV to set the environment variable, EXPOSE to specify the port to be exposed by the container, WORKDIR to set the current working directory, and the CMD container to run when it starts 4. After the Dockerfile is written, the image can be built. Use the docker build -t image name: tag . command to build the image. The last point indicates the current directory, and docker will search for the current directory by default. Dockerfile file to build the image, if you do not use the default, you can use the -f parameter to specify the dockerfile file, such as: docker build -t image name: tag -f /xx/xxx/Dockerfile; 5. After using the docker build command to build, docker All the files in the current directory will be sent to the docker daemon, and the instructions in the Dockerfile will be executed sequentially. During this process, a temporary container will be generated, and the command specified by RUN will be installed in the temporary container. After the installation is successful, the bottom layer of docker will use something like Use the docker commit command to save the container as an image, then delete the temporary container, and so on, build the image layer by layer, run the temporary container to install the software, until the final image is built successfully.
