User: I'm trying to write a batch process that can take an MP3 file and mute certain parts of it, ideally in Python or Java.
Take this example: Given a 2 minute MP3, I want to mute the time between 1:20 and 1:30. When saved back to a file, the rest of the MP3 will play normally -- only that portion will be silent.
Any advice for setting this up in a way that's easy to automate/run on the command line would be fantastic!
Assistant: One (somehow pretentious) idea:  record a mute (silent) mp3 in bitrate that your mp3 is.  Then, copy all the frames from original mp3 up to the point when you want your silence to start.  Then, copy as much muted frames you need from your 'silence file'.  Then, copy the rest from the original file.
You'll have muted file without re-encoding the file!
