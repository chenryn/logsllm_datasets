It seems like you might be missing a fundamental step in the process of integrating a GitHub repository with your virtual environment. Let me clarify and provide a more streamlined approach:

1. **Setup Your Virtual Environment:**
   - You've already created a virtual environment and installed Python 2.7, which is a good start.

2. **Fork and Clone the Repository:**
   - You correctly forked the repository on GitHub. 
   - Instead of using the "Clone to Mac" button in the GitHub for Mac app, you should clone the repository directly into your virtual environment directory using the command line. This will give you more control over where the files are placed.

3. **Cloning the Repository via Command Line:**
   - Open Terminal.
   - Navigate to your virtual environment directory:
     ```sh
     cd /path/to/your/virtualenv
     ```
   - Activate your virtual environment (if it's not already activated):
     ```sh
     source bin/activate
     ```
   - Clone the repository into this directory:
     ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
     ```

4. **Working with the Cloned Repository:**
   - Now, the repository is cloned into your virtual environment directory, and you can work with it as needed.
   - To switch to the repository directory:
     ```sh
     cd repo-name
     ```
   - You can now install any required dependencies, run tests, or make changes as needed.

By following these steps, you avoid the issue of overwriting directories and ensure that your project is set up within the correct environment. This method is more straightforward and avoids the need for copy-paste operations or managing multiple folders.
