User: I am working on ubuntu 14.04. Python version: 2.7.6. 
I am trying to install cPickle, but I am getting error: 
"could not find any downloads that satisfy the requirement cPickle"
I tried via, pip and apt-get as well. What might be reason, has this package been removed completely?
Assistant: Actually, I tried importing cPickle and it worked. But I don't know why the error "could not find any downloads that satisfy the requirement cPickle". I will appreciate if someone can provide reason.  
Also as commented by mike cleared my doubt. 
"cPickle is installed when python itself is installed -- it's part of the standard library. So, just import cPickle and it should be there"
