### Title: Black Hat Asia 2020 - Misuse of DNS, the Second Most Used Protocol

The Internet's traffic heavily relies on the Domain Name System (DNS) to function, and as IPv6 traffic continues to grow, this reliance will only increase. Despite its critical role, DNS, an ancient protocol, has been a target for attacks for over four decades. While improvements like DNSSEC, DoT, and DoH are being introduced, their adoption is not as rapid as it should be.

This session is not about attacking DNS servers or clients; instead, it focuses on developing new techniques to "misuse" the DNS protocol to our advantage. In this talk, I will cover the following topics:

1. **DNS Features and Specifications**: An overview of the key features and specifications of the DNS protocol.
2. **Current Landscape of DNS Misuse Tools**: A review of existing tools designed to misuse DNS, along with their respective advantages and disadvantages.
3. **Next-Generation Security Products**: An examination of modern security products such as Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS), firewalls, and others, and how they attempt to prevent or detect these misuses.
4. **Bypassing Security Measures**: A detailed explanation of an algorithm designed to bypass these security measures by mimicking normal DNS traffic.
5. **Practical Demonstration**: A live demonstration using an open-source tool called "DFEX" to set up a real, portable network infrastructure and test the bypass technique.
6. **Additional Use Cases and Scalability**: A discussion on other potential uses of this technique, including how to scale them, and some ideas for detection and mitigation.

This talk is aimed at a diverse audience, including Red, Green, and Blue teams, researchers, infrastructure and system administrators, and passionate security professionals.
