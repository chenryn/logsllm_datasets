Hello,
I've got an application which uses match_phrase queries to look for, and
highlight, exact matches within file texts. It worked fantastically on
ElasticSearch version 2.0.0 and 2.0.1, but breaks on 2.1.0.
The query appears to run correctly but the highlighter highlights ALL
instances of terms in the query instead of just those that appear within
matched phrases. For example, if the query contains the word "is", then every
instance of the word "is" - throughout the entire document - is highlighted.
# Example:
As an example, I've prepared a series of commands in the Sense chrome plugin
to replicate the problem:
    POST /test_index
    {
       "settings": {
          "number_of_shards": 1,
          "number_of_replicas": 0
       },
           "mappings" : {
            "file" : {
                "properties" : {
                    "text" : { "type" : "string"}
                }
            }
        }
    }
    POST /test_index/file
    {
        "text": "The quick brown fox jumped over the other, lazier, fox."
    }
    POST /test_index/file
    {
        "text": "Doc Brown is one quick fox."
    }
    POST /test_index/file/_search
    {
       "query": {
          "match_phrase": {
             "text": "quick brown fox"
          }
       },
       "highlight": {
          "fields": {
             "text": {
                "number_of_fragments": 0
             }
          }
       }
    }
## Version 2.0.1 results
Under version 2.0.1, the search call returns the following hits array:
    "hits": [
        {
            "_index": "test_index",
            "_type": "file",
            "_id": "AVF-PCoeysoVw9xNBYa3",
            "_score": 0.55737644,
            "_source":{
                "text": "The quick brown fox jumped over the other, lazier, fox."
            },
            "highlight": {
                "text": [
                    "The quick brown fox jumped over the other, lazier, fox."
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
This is the expected and desired output.
## Version 2.1.0 results
Under version 2.1.0, the search call returns the following hits array:
    "hits": [
        {
            "_index": "test_index",
            "_type": "file",
            "_id": "AVF-MdXsEcdhEnh7dUcO",
            "_score": 0.55737644,
            "_source": {
                "text": "The quick brown fox jumped over the other, lazier, fox."
            },
            "highlight": {
                "text": [
                    "The quick brown fox jumped over the other, lazier, fox."
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
This is the same match, and even has the same score, but the word "fox" is
incorrectly highlighted when it occurs without the rest of the phrase.
## Tested solutions
In attempt to rectify this problem, I attempted two things:
  1. First, on the theory that perhaps it had switched to the postings highlighter rather than the plain highlighter, I attempted to force the use of the plain version with the `"type": "plain"` flag. Unfortunately, this had no visible effect.
  2. Second, duplicated the original query within a `"highlight_query"` block. This too, unfortunately, had no visible effect.
# Theory
Currently, my theory is that this problem is related to the upgrade to
lucene-5.3.0. (#13239)  
Specifically, I wonder if it has to do with how NearSpansOrdered are
processed. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-6537)
That said, this is purely conjecture. It's quite possible - or even likely -
that the problem lies elsewhere.  
I'm hoping that an elasticsearch expert might have a better idea.
Thank you.
