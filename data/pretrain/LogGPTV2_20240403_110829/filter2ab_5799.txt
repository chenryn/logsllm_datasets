**ATT&CK ID:** S0031  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** BACKSPACE

The "ZR" variant of BACKSPACE includes a functionality to detect the presence of known host-based firewalls on compromised systems. Once BACKSPACE establishes a command and control (C2) channel, it will monitor open windows to identify any firewall pop-ups. If a firewall alert is detected, BACKSPACE will simulate a mouse click to allow the connection to proceed, thereby bypassing the firewall's security prompt.
