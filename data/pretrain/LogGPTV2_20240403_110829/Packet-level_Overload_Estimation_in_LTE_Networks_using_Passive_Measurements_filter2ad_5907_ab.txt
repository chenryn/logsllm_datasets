increases. Thus, if overload is detected in a cell the system must
remove a subset of the connected bearers until the load is reduced
to an acceptable level. Admission Control [25] is used to restrict
the number of UEs given access to the system, in order to provide
acceptable QoS to admitted users.
4 IMPLEMENTATION
4.1 Experimental Setup
In our experimental setup, our receiver is comprised of an Ettus
Research USRP B210 [33] SDR attached to a MPantenna SUPER-M
ULTRA Mobile Antenna with a frequency range from 25MHz to
6GHz [13]. The USRP is connected to a Lenovo ThinkPad W550s
laptop for data collection and post-processing. We use the srsUE
mode in the open-source srsLTE software suite [23] to locate avail-
able cells in the vicinity by scanning all frequency bands. On the

day of the event, we capture broadcast messages in the form of
binary I/Q samples using srsLTE’s UE usrp_capture utility.
4.2 LTE Packet Decoding
We start with converting binary I/Q samples to hexdumps. To in-
vestigate the extent of overload on eNodeBs, we then transform
the hexdump into network traces using Wireshark’s text2pcap
command [1]. Next, we use lte_rrc lua dissectors to decode LTE
RRC messages using tshark [16]. We employ lte − rrc.dl .ccch and
lte−rrc.ul .ccch protocols to decode RRC messages on the downlink
and uplink common control channel, respectively. Lastly, we use
the lte − rrc.bcch.dl .sch protocol to decode downlink messages on
the broadcast control channel.
Listing 1 shows a snapshot of the decoded RRC message on the
downlink CCCH. We can see the RRCConnectionReject message
tree along with additional options sent by the eNodeB during the
RRC connection establishment phase. Embedded in this message is
the waitTime parameter. While reject messages provide an indica-
tion of overload, we can use the value of the waitTime metric as a
measure of the severity of overload. The value of waitTime is an
integer in the range of 1–16, which defines how many seconds the
UE should wait after reception of the RRCConnectionReject until a
new connection can be attempted. According to 3GPP TS 23.401 [3],
when rejecting an RRC connection request, the eNodeB indicates to
the UE an appropriate timer value that limits further requests, rela-
tive to the severity of overload; the more the overload, the greater
the waitTime. Upon receiving the RRCConnectionReject message,
the UE starts timer T302 [10], with the timer value set to waitTime.
The UE is not allowed to send another RRCConnectionRequest for

activity of local nightlife. Compared to the SPD dataset we expect
this dataset to exhibit low levels of overload, acting as a baseline for
the location. Indeed, we see about 6,992 uniqueUeIDs. We collect a
little over 275K frames in 65 minutes.
ShamROCK Concert (CSR): We collect traces from the Sham-
ROCK concert in the downtown area of San Diego [18] on March
16th. The event started at 7:00 PM and lasted until midnight. We col-
lect 113 minutes (~1.7 million frames) of traces during this time pe-
rioe. This event/location combination (as shown in Figure 2(b))100
was selected because we anticipated that the amount of cellular
traffic during the event would well-exceed the typical traffic load.
Because this location (city streets) does not typically have large
crowds, we expect there to be network overload during a large
event. This dataset contains 42,433 uniqueUeIDs.
ShamROCK Concert Baseline (CSR_base): As a baseline to the
CSR dataset, we capture additional traces (~135K frames) in the
same location from 9:30pm to 10:30pm on March 26th, when the
number of pedestrians and amount of vehicular traffic was more
representative of normal operating hours. We detect only 3,338
uniqueUeIDs during this data capture.
5 EVALUATION
We analyze five RRC elements: (a) RRCConnectionReject, (b) wait-
Time, (c) RRCConnectionRequest, (d) cellBarred signal and (e)
number of SIB1s transmitted (#SIB1). Collectively, we refer to this
data as "RRC metrics". We plot the values of these RRC metrics
over thirty-second bins. We found that thirty-second bins were
appropriate for our analysis because smaller time bins had little
to no relative variation between the samples; however, we missed
out on important data points when we used sixty-second or larger
bins. In our evaluation, we observe that the rate of transmitted
RRCConnectionReject messages is considerably higher in SPD
and CSR than their respective baselines, in accordance with our
initial hypothesis. Further, we discover an increase in cellBarred
signals and waitTime values in overloaded datasets (i.e., SPD and
CPR).
5.1 Rejects
According to[8], an eNodeB may send an RRCConnectionReject in
response to the UE’s RRCConnectionRequest for exactly one of the
following three reasons: (i) the eNodeB is overloaded (e.g., severe
increase in requesting UEs that the eNodeB cannot accommodate);
(ii) the necessary radio resources for the connection setup cannot
be provided (for instance, damaged equipment on eNodeB that
results in limited access to the core network); or (iii) the Mobility
Management Entity (MME) is overloaded. The MME is the key
control-node for the LTE access network, which serves several
eNodeBs. It is in charge of all the control plane functions related
to subscriber and session management. Once the MME detects
overload, it transmits an overload start message to the affected
eNodeBs, signalling them to reject connection request messages
that are for non-emergency and non-high priority mobile originated
services.
Analysis of the reject messages sent over a fixed time interval can
quantify the level of overload in the network. Figure 3 illustrates

mobile originating calls, signalling, terminating access or circuit-
switched fallback (CSFB) [2, 14] on the same cell until the expiry
of T302. Note that in LTE, the RRCConnectionReject message does
not contain a RejectionCause, therefore waitTime, in conjunction
with reject messages, is a crucial parameter in assessing the level
of overload.
4.3 Datasets
To test our proposed solution, we identify times and locations in
which we anticipate cellular overload, capture traces, and then com-
pare network performance in those traces with baselines captured
in the same location during normal operating conditions (when
no network overload is likely to occur). We select spaces that are
anticipated to have large gatherings but that are unlikely to be pro-
visioned for large crowds (i.e. city streets as opposed to stadiums
which typically have sufficient network capacity to handle crowds).
Our hypothesis is that during large crowds we will observe
higher numbers of RRCConnectionReject messages than in times
of regular operation. Overall, our dataset consists of over 3.2 million
frames, with data collection that lasts for a cumulative duration
of about 5.2 hours. While it is not possible to compute the exact
number of UEs in the vicinity due to the lack of international mo-
bile subscriber identity (IMSI) number in broadcast messages for
security reasons, measuring the number of temporary unique UE
IDs (uniqueUeID) in RRC Connection Requests allows us to esti-
mate the number of active UEs present nearby.
St. Patrick’s Day (SPD): We collect cellular traces during the
2019 St. Patrick’s Day parade adjacent to Balboa Park in San Diego,
CA [35]. The parade was held on Saturday March 16th, beginning
at 10:00AM and ending around noon, while the public fair lasted
through 3:30PM. We physically positioned our data collection de-
vices within the crowd to better assess the eNodeBs serving this
particular region as shown in (Figure 2(a)). The total duration of
data collection is about 76 minutes, which resulted in over 1.1 mil-
lion LTE frames. We observe 27,349 uniqueUeIDs.
St. Patrick’s Day Baseline (SPD_base): As a point of comparison
for the SPD dataset, we again gather LTE traces from the same
location, from 8pm to 9pm on Tuesday March 26th. Collection in
the evening on a weekday helped us to avoid unexpected large
gatherings in the many venues of the park, while still capturing
