death of the ego. I think this software is aptly named.
We have examined many tools throughout this book, and now we\'ve reached
one of my favorites. Some of the tools in Kali Linux have entire
chapters devoted to them in this book, such as Metasploit Framework,
Nmap, Wireshark, and Burp. The best way to master any skill or tool is
hands‐on practice. One method you could take is to load these tools on
your computer and use them to examine your personal systems. That is a
great introduction, but it doesn\'t scale very well. Most of us don\'t
have many systems in our own private network and may not be able to
fully realize the usefulness of these tools. You could use these tools
to examine Google or Yahoo! or some other production system out on the
Web, but the major problem with doing that is that you don\'t have
permission to do it. It could get you into a lot of legal trouble.
Another alternative, and the one I use the most, is to use
virtualization.

## Virtualization {#c14.xhtml#head-2-103}
Virtualization is a technology that system administrators have been
using in our datacenters for years, and it is at the heart of cloud
computing infrastructure. It is a technology that allows the physical
resources of a computer (CPU, RAM, hard disk, graphics card, etc.) to be
shared by virtual machines (VMs). Consider the old days when a single
physical hardware platform---the server---was dedicated to a
single‐server application like being a web server. It turns out that a
typical web server application didn\'t utilize much of the underlying
hardware resources available to it on the server. For purposes of this
discussion, let\'s assume that a web application running on one of our
physical servers utilized 30 percent of the hardware resources. That
meant that 70 percent of the physical resources were going unused; thus,
the server was being underutilized.
With virtualization, we could now install three web servers by using VMs
each utilizing 30 percent of the physical hardware resources of the
server. Now we are utilizing 90 percent of the physical hardware
resources of the server, which is a much better return on our investment
in the server. We will be using this technology to help us master the
tools discussed in this chapter. By installing virtualization software
on your computer, you can create VMs that can be used to work with the
tools discussed. The rest of this chapter is concerned with doing just
that.
Let\'s first define some of the proper vocabulary:
A *hypervisor* is the software that is installed on a computer that
supports virtualization. It can be implemented as *firmware*, which is
specialized hardware that has permanent software programmed into it. It
could also be hardware with installed software. It is within the
hypervisor that the VMs will be created. The hypervisor allocates the
underlying hardware resources to the VMs. Examples of hypervisor
software are VMware\'s Workstation and Oracle\'s VM VirtualBox. There
are free versions of each of these hypervisors that you can download and
use as we did in [Lab 10.4](../Text/c10.xhtml#c10-fea-0004) in [Chapter
10](../Text/c10.xhtml), "Metasploit."
[]{#c14.xhtml#Page_207 .pagebreak title="207" role="doc-pagebreak"}There
are two types of hypervisors. Type 1 hypervisor runs directly on the
bare metal of a system. Type 2 hypervisor runs on a host operating
system that provides virtualization services. In our lab, you will be
setting up a Type 2 hypervisor in the first lab of this chapter.
A *virtual machine* is a machine that is created on the hypervisor. It
will have its own operating system and be allocated physical hardware
resources such as CPU, RAM, hard disk, etc. Various network resources
can also be allocated to each VM.
The *host operating system* is the operating system of the computer the
hypervisor is being installed on.
The *guest operating system* is the operating system of the VM that
resides within the hypervisor.
For example, I have a tower computer with an Intel i7 processor, 32 GB
of RAM, and multiterabytes of hard disk space running Windows 10 Pro as
the host operating system. I also have VMware Workstation Pro as my
hypervisor with multiple VMs loaded in it, like Kali Linux and
Metasploitable2. Linux is the guest operating system of both these
instances.
Before you start this process, you need to make sure that the computer
you plan to use for virtualization can support the VMs you intend to
load on it as well as its host operating system. [Table
14.1](#c14.xhtml#c14-tbl-0001){#c14.xhtml#R_c14-tbl-0001} lists the
requirements for Windows 10, Ubuntu Linux, and Kali Linux.

like any environment, there will be pros and cons. Some of the pros of
running Kali in a VM are that you can run more than one OS at a time;
you can install, reinstall, or back up any time you want quite easily;
and you can manage the allocation of resources. The cons would be that
performance may not be as robust as if you were on bare metal, USB
drives can cause issues, and some of us would rather roll back than
actually troubleshoot the issue. I\'ve been guilty of that because I was
in a time crunch.
For demonstration purposes, in [Lab

through installing VMware Workstation Player on my Windows computer and

There are several Kali Linux distributions to choose from. You have the
WSL version that can be pulled directly into a Windows OS. From
`www.kali.org`, every few months there is a new Kali image you can
download. From `www.offensive‐security.com`, the VMs are already created
for you. They are shared with the disclaimer that they are maintained on
a "best‐effort" basis, and all future updates will be listed here:
`www.offensive‐security.com/kali‐linux‐vm‐vmware‐virtualbox‐image‐download/19/`
There are a few more important things I want to mention before we open
Kali. Offensive Security does not supply technical support for Kali
images, but support can be found on the Kali Linux Community page. Odds
are if you have a question or problem, someone else has experienced the
same thing. Scroll down the page until you see the Kali Linux VM for the
architecture of your machine. As you see in [Figure
14.6](#c14.xhtml#c14-fig-0006){#c14.xhtml#R_c14-fig-0006}, there will be
a version as well as a hash.

### NOTE
If you are interested in using an Android distribution for penetration
testing, I have run Kali NetHunter on my tablet. It\'s a lot of fun on
an airplane, but please remember to make ethical decisions. I had an
interesting conversation on a flight from Denver to Los Angeles sitting
next to a physician using the wireless service the
[]{#c14.xhtml#Page_212 .pagebreak title="212"
role="doc-pagebreak"}airline offers. He was obviously reading
confidential patient information that I could see because he had no
privacy screen on his laptop. A peek at his taskbar told me a lot about
the precautions he was taking. I pulled up NetHunter on my Android
tablet and asked if he wanted to see something interesting. I\'m not
sure if I was supposed to be flattered that he said I looked like a
librarian, not a hacker.
