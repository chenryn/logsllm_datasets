### Symfony Version(s) Affected
3.x, 4.x

### Description
An update to the `php-intl` library has caused an infinite loop in the following code:

- **File**: `symfony/src/Symfony/Component/Intl/Data/Bundle/Reader/BundleEntryReader.php`
- **Line**: 81 (Commit: 95932df)
- **Code Snippet**:
  ```php
  while (null !== $currentLocale) {
      // ...
  }
  ```

### How to Reproduce
1. Update `php-intl` to the latest version.
2. Attempt to retrieve country names for the `en` locale, for example.

### Possible Solution
To maintain backward compatibility, it would be beneficial to modify the loop condition to check if the locale is not empty. The updated condition could be:

```php
while (!empty($currentLocale)) {
    // ...
}
```

### Additional Context
I encountered this issue on my work PC and spent the entire morning troubleshooting it. When I switched to my laptop, which had an older version of `php-intl`, the error did not occur. After updating `php-intl` on my laptop, the error reappeared, confirming that the issue is related to the `php-intl` update.
