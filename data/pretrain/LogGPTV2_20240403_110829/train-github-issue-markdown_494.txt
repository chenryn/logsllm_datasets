**Symfony version(s) affected** : 3.x, 4.x
**Description**  
Due to update in php-intl library this loop is infinite.  
symfony/src/Symfony/Component/Intl/Data/Bundle/Reader/BundleEntryReader.php
Line 81 in 95932df
|  while (null !== $currentLocale) {  
---|---  
**How to reproduce**  
Update php-intl to the latest version and try to get country names for en
locale for example.
**Possible Solution**  
For BC it would be great to loop until locale is empty so check could be
!empty($currentlocale)
**Additional context**  
Ive been struggling with this all morning, later I had to code on my laptop
and this error was not present, Ive updated php-intl and error became present
as on my work PC.
