User: This is a really annoying problem. I've prowled the web for solutions, but all I found was tips about changing the PATH variable, which I did, of course. My Python install directory is C:\Python27. It' a 32 bit version. Whenever I type python in the command prompt, it says that it isn't recognised as an internal or external command. Currently, my PATH variable is set to C:\Python27;C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\;C:\Python27\Scripts. Anyone has any ideas? I run Windows 7 by the way (64 bit). I'm pretty desperate. Heck, if nothing works I guess I'll try dual-booting Linux and Windows 7...
Assistant: This is only a partial answer, but I found (repeatedly) that I'd have similar issues when I would use the gui installer and not go through the custom setup.
Using the custom setup option, then using the same settings, the "install for all users" (that then installs to C://python.version/blah instead of the user based default structure) WOULD allow the installer to setup PATH correctly.
