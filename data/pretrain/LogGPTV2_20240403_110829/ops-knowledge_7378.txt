User: I have discovered that I have some old python packages installed in /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Extras/lib/python and want to remove these. Seems impossible to remove them however, tried "sudo rm -rf" etc but get permission errors.
I general I have a working "homebrew" installation and need to get rid of the packages. How to go about it?
Assistant: Go to this folder and delete the packages that you want to delete
C:\Python27\Scripts

Thank you
