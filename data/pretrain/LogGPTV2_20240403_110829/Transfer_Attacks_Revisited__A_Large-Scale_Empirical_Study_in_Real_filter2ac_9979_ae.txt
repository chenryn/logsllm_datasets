∗p  LLC and FGSM > PGD).
Su et al. [41] conﬁrms that FGSM transfers better than PGD
as well. This result is surprising because iterative algorithms
are more powerful and exploit more information from the
surrogate model. Combining these two facts, we can see that
attacks that use too much information of the surrogate are
less likely to transfer, and the probably most
transferable
information is the gradient with regard to the seed image.
Observation 3. In the real applications, strong adversarial
algorithms, e.g., CW2, might have weak transferability. In

addition, single-step algorithms transfer better than iterative
algorithms, e.g., FGSM > PGD. This suggests the probably
most transferable information is the gradient with regard to
the seed image.
4) Surrogate Depth Factors: Choosing the surrogate depth
is important for a good surrogate model. Demontis et al. [15]
pointed out that simple surrogates are better than complex
surrogates. However, in practice, this brings up a question:
a too simple surrogate cannot perform reasonably on the task.
For example, the most complex surrogate that Demontis et
al. applied was a two-layer neural network. However, this
particular architecture is too simple to be the surrogate in our
tasks, getting roughly 15% accuracy on the test data for the
object classiﬁcation task. Therefore, the impact of surrogate
depth in the real scenario is still under-explored.
Regression D and I decompose the effect of surrogate depth
in Table III and Table IV, respectively. By comparing the
coefﬁcients, we can see that for the gender classiﬁcation,
ResNet-18 indeed performs better than ResNet-34 and ResNet-
50. However, for the object classiﬁcation task, ResNet-18,
ResNet-34 and ResNet-50 essentially have the same perfor-
mance. This shows simpler surrogates do not necessarily have
better transferability in the real transfer attack, especially for
complex tasks. We further conduct two experiments for the
object classiﬁcation task. One of them aims to show that
on local targets, an appropriate ResNet surrogate preserves
better transferability than both simpler and deeper surrogates.
The other aims to show that for VGG surrogates, the same
phenomenon is observed as well.
(i) Experiments on Local Targets
To make our settings more similar to the previous study
by Demontis et al. [15], we apply AEs crafted from ResNet
surrogates with different depths against a local VGG-16 target
model. We calculate the difference in misclassiﬁcation rate
among various depths for each threat setting which consists
of different pretraining factors and attack algorithm factors.
The surrogate dataset is ﬁxed to raw, i.e., no data enrichment is
used. Figure 4 shows the distribution of the difference between
the ResNet-34 and the ResNet-18 surrogates and the difference
between the ResNet-50 and the ResNet-34 surrogates.
It can be seen from Figure 4 that the ResNet-34 surrogates
have higher transferability than ResNet-18 but the ResNet-
50 surrogates have lower transferability than ResNet-34. By
performing Wilcoxon test [48], we get that the ﬁrst conclusion
has p-value 0.028 and the second has p-value 0.035, which are
