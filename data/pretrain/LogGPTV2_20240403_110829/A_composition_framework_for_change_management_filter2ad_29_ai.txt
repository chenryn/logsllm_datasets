### 2.1.1 Inputs

To complete the OCM Lifecycle Management activities during the Planning Process Phase, the OCM Practitioner will need a thorough understanding of the following inputs:

- **OCM Schedule**: Developed in the Initiating Process Phase, the OCM Schedule identifies the OCM activities to be conducted. This provides insight into managing the activities, resources, and schedules for the project.
- **Project Management Plan (PMP)**: Developed in the Planning Process Phase as prescribed by the CA-PMF, the PMP provides information on the management of the project scope, resources, and work plan. The OCM approach and schedule should align with the relevant project information in the PMP.
- **Schedule Management Plan**: Developed in the Planning Process Phase as prescribed by the CA-PMF, this plan describes the criteria and activities for developing, monitoring, and controlling the schedule. The OCM Schedule will follow the criteria set forth in the Schedule Management Plan.
- **Stakeholder Register**: Developed in the Initiating Process Phase as prescribed by the CA-PMF, the Stakeholder Register identifies the organizations, groups, and individuals with an interest in the project.

### 2.1.2 Roles

The following table lists the roles and their associated responsibilities of those involved in OCM Lifecycle Management activities during the Planning Process Phase.

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| **OCM Practitioner** | - Conduct OCM activities as prescribed in the OCM Schedule<br>- Define OCM-related project requirements<br>- Conduct Organizational Change Readiness Assessments<br>- Develop the OCM Plan |
| **Project Manager** | - Collaborate with the OCM Practitioner to schedule OCM activities |
| **Project Sponsor** | - Provide input into OCM-related project requirements development<br>- Provide input into the OCM Plan<br>- Collaborate with the OCM Practitioner to conduct OCM activities, as needed |

### 2.1.3 Activities

OCM Lifecycle Management serves to organize and manage the overall OCM effort throughout the PMLC. As the project enters the Planning Process Phase, the OCM Practitioner manages the OCM effort with three key activities:

- **Determine and Plan for OCM Activities**
- **Develop the OCM Plan**
- **Conduct OCM Activities**

#### Determine and Plan for OCM Activities

The Planning Process Phase focuses on building support for the change initiative. Similar to the prior process phase, OCM activities within the Planning Process Phase must be identified, resourced, and scheduled. To update the OCM Schedule with Planning Process Phase activities, the OCM Practitioner should:

- Review the entirety of this chapter to identify the various activities and outputs that must be developed within each knowledge area in the Planning Process Phase.
- Identify the tasks necessary to complete the identified activities based on the project and organizational characteristics. Consider any constraints that will dictate the timing, frequency, and order of the activities.
- Estimate the duration and effort to complete each task, considering the scope and complexity of the project.
- Work with the Project Manager to identify available resources to complete the tasks. The availability of resources may require rework of the schedule.

The OCM Practitioner should work with the Project Manager and leverage the project organization chart, Stakeholder Register, Project Management Plan (PMP), and Schedule Management Plan to identify and allocate these resources in the OCM Schedule. Once the schedule is developed, the OCM Practitioner will work with the Project Manager to integrate the tasks into the greater project schedule for monitoring and control.

#### Assess Organizational Change Readiness

In the Concept Process Phase, the OCM Practitioner completed an Environmental Readiness Assessment to gauge the organization at a high level on readiness in four environmental areas: organizational readiness, leadership readiness, employee readiness, and supporting infrastructure readiness. During the Initiating Process Phase, a Change Magnitude Assessment was conducted to support OCM efforts. In the Planning Process Phase, the OCM Practitioner must conduct additional assessments based on each of the knowledge areas to consider the needs of the stakeholders.

An Organizational Change Readiness Assessment helps the OCM Practitioner assess the organization’s readiness and need for focused OCM efforts in all knowledge areas. This assessment, completed by representative populations at all organizational levels (e.g., executives, managers, staff), allows the OCM Practitioner to tailor the OCM Plan and OCM activities to the specific needs at each level.

The OCM Practitioner should work with the Project Sponsor and Project Manager to determine an appropriate sample size and method for identifying participants to complete the Organizational Change Readiness Assessment. Some projects may find it easiest to determine a relative sample size and randomly select participants from each organizational level. The method for survey distribution should also be considered. The OCM Practitioner may choose to send the Organizational Change Readiness Assessment electronically or bring survey participants together in small focus groups to introduce the change and conduct the survey. Regardless of the sample size and method of assessment, the OCM Practitioner should ensure all organizational levels are represented.

The Organizational Change Readiness Assessment contains multiple statements regarding each knowledge area for the participant to rate on a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 indicating strongly disagree and 5 indicating strongly agree. Sample statements include:

- Feedback processes are continually being used to determine how effectively change is being adopted.
- The organization uses multiple communication methods to keep stakeholders informed.
- The Project Sponsor and executive leadership build awareness for the need for change and why the change is happening.
- Stakeholders feel heard and understood when expressing concerns or asking questions regarding the project.

- Analysis
- Collaboration

**Tools:**
- Organizational Change Readiness Assessment Template

**Outputs:**
- Completed Organizational Change Readiness Assessment

#### Develop the OCM Plan

The OCM Practitioner develops the OCM Plan to document an approach for managing the change, integrating activities from all knowledge areas, and discussing how activities translate into actions for the Executing Process Phase. This plan draws upon the Organizational Change Readiness Assessment results, industry research, and the experiences of the OCM Practitioner to provide an understanding of the change in the organization when people-related efforts shift to focus on the larger affected population.

The OCM Practitioner should carefully read each of the knowledge area sections within the Executing Process Phase Chapter to identify and understand the activities to include in the OCM Plan.

The OCM Plan documents the following elements:

- **Scope of the OCM Effort**: The OCM scope refers to the extent to which knowledge area activities are implemented for different stakeholder groups. The OCM Practitioner should consider the results of the Organizational Change Readiness Assessment, industry research, lessons learned from previous change initiatives, and the Practitioner’s own experiences and organizational knowledge.
- **Management of the OCM Effort**: The OCM Practitioner should also consider the details surrounding how the OCM effort will be managed. Who will implement specific activities? How will progress and effectiveness of activities be monitored? How will the reporting process function? Management of the OCM effort should align with the management strategies set forth in the Project Management Plan (PMP) and all subordinate plans.
- **Roles and Responsibilities Associated with the OCM Effort**: In many projects, the OCM Practitioner role may be split between multiple resources. There may be separate sub-teams for different knowledge areas or a few resources managing activities in multiple knowledge areas. It is important to identify the roles and responsibilities of the OCM Practitioner(s), Project Manager, Project Sponsor, project team, and any other identified resources specific to the OCM effort. The OCM Practitioner should collaborate with the Project Manager and Project Sponsor to clearly define all OCM-specific roles and responsibilities.
- **OCM Activities**: The OCM Practitioner identifies OCM activities appropriate for his/her organization and change effort based on the Organizational Change Readiness Assessment results, industry best practices, lessons learned from previous change efforts, and the Practitioner’s own OCM experience and organizational knowledge. OCM activities should focus on high-priority knowledge areas and stakeholder groups, and remain in alignment with the OCM scope. It is important to note that while the OCM Practitioner may identify specific activities when initially developing the OCM Plan, these may be modified, eliminated, or added to throughout the Executing and Closing Process Phases depending on the changing needs of the organization and the effectiveness of certain activities.
- **Key Milestones**: The OCM Plan should summarize the key milestones in the OCM Schedule, which has been updated in this process phase.

Once the OCM Plan is completed, it can be leveraged during the Planning Process Phase to scope and appropriately resource the OCM effort to determine the project requirements. The OCM Practitioner will later use the OCM Plan to guide the activities, tools, and schedule for all OCM efforts throughout the Executing and Closing Process Phases. The OCM Plan serves as a subordinate plan to the Project Management Plan.

**Figure 2-3**

### Implementing Planning Process Phase Communications

- **Communicate Key Project Messages**
- **Communicate Operations**
- **Ensure Common Understanding**

Technology implementation projects often result in questions and concerns from employees and stakeholders who are directly or indirectly affected by the implementation. Employees and stakeholders alike will be curious and, at times, uncertain about the upcoming changes. Communication is necessary to educate stakeholders about the business case, the benefits of the project, the ultimate impact on the business environment, and the people involved.

**Figure 2-3** demonstrates the goals of the Communication Knowledge Area. Communication activities begin in the Planning Process Phase to communicate the business need, key milestones, and details on the transition to Executing. It is also important to begin setting the stage for employees to be involved in the project, as some will participate in designing the future business processes and identifying functional requirements. **Figure 2-4** provides the inputs, roles, skills, activities, tools, and outputs of the Communication Knowledge Area within the Planning Process Phase.

### 2.2.1 Inputs

To complete the Planning Process Phase Communication activities, the OCM Practitioner will need a thorough understanding of the following inputs:

- **Project Charter**: Completed in the Initiating Process Phase as prescribed by the CA-PMF, the Project Charter provides information regarding the scope and objectives of the project.
- **Project Management Plan (PMP)**: Completed in the Planning Process Phase as prescribed by the CA-PMF, the PMP provides information regarding the management of project scope, resources, and work plan.
- **Project Schedule**: Describes what work needs to be performed, which resources of the organization will perform the work, and the time frames in which that work needs to be performed.
- **Stakeholder Register**: Completed in the Initiating Process Phase as prescribed in the CA-PMF, the Stakeholder Register lists project stakeholders who influence the project or are affected by its outcome. The Stakeholder Register identifies the stakeholders critical to the project that should be included in project activities in addition to all stakeholders that are part of the effort.
- **Stakeholder Management Plan**: Completed in the Planning Process Phase as prescribed in the CA-PMF, the Stakeholder Management Plan describes the methods, content, direction, and frequency of communication required by each of the stakeholders.

### 2.2.2 Roles

The following table lists the roles and their associated responsibilities of those involved in Communication Management activities during the Planning Process Phase.

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| **OCM Practitioner** | - Assist with the development of the Communication Management Plan<br>- Prepare high-level communication messages and timing |
| **Project Manager** | - Develop the Communication Management Plan<br>- Solicit input from the OCM Practitioner for communications<br>- Deliver communications |
| **Project Sponsor** | - Provide input into the Communication Management Plan<br>- Deliver communications |

### 2.2.3 Activities

Communication messages during the Planning Process Phase center around the business need, project vision, and other high-level information that will prepare stakeholders and employees to understand and embrace the changes that are coming. To execute Planning Process Phase communications, the OCM Practitioner works with the Project Manager, Project Sponsor, and members of the project team to develop a Communication Management Plan and deliver communications. Effective communication management supports:

- Meeting stakeholder information needs
- Tracking and reporting project performance
- Formally documenting project results
- Garnering enthusiasm and support for the project
- Sharing information and providing feedback channels

#### Develop Communication Management Plan

Communication is a vital part of any change initiative. Employees and stakeholders rely on communication messages to understand the change and set their expectations of the project and project outcomes. A strong Communication Management Plan at this stage will begin the process of enrolling employees and stakeholders in the project initiative. The Communication Management Plan should support and align with the information documented in the Project Charter, Project Management Plan, Stakeholder Register, and Stakeholder Management Plan.
