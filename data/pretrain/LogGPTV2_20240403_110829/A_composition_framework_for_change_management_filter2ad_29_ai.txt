2.1.1 Inputs 
In order to complete the Planning Process Phase OCM Lifecycle Management 
activities,  the  OCM  Practitioner  will  need  a  thorough  understanding  of  the 
following inputs: 
OCM Schedule: The OCM Schedule, developed in the Initiating Process Phase,  
identifies the OCM activities to be conducted. This provides insight into managing  
the activities, resources, and schedules that occur for the project. 
Project Management Plan (PMP): The Project Management Plan, developed in 
the Planning Process Phase as prescribed by the CA-PMF, provides information 
regarding the management of the project scope, resources, and work plan. The 
OCM approach and schedule should align with the relevant project information 
contained in the PMP. 
Planning | Page 10 
California Department of TechnologyOrganizational Change Management FrameworkPlanningOCM Lifecycle ManagementSchedule Management Plan:  The Schedule Management Plan, developed in the  
Planning Process Phase as prescribed by the CA-PMF, describes the criteria and  
the activities for developing, monitoring, and controlling the schedule. The OCM  
Schedule will follow the criteria set forth in the Schedule Management Plan. 
Stakeholder  Register:  The  Stakeholder  Register,  developed  in  the  Initiating 
Process Phase as prescribed by the CA-PMF, identifies the organizations, groups, 
and individuals with an interest in the project.

OCM  Lifecycle  Management  serves  to  organize  and  manage  the  overall  OCM 
efort throughout the PMLC. As the project enters the Planning Process Phase, 
the OCM Practitioner manages the OCM efort with three activities: 
•   Determine and plan for OCM activities 
•   Develop the OCM Plan 
•   Conduct OCM activities 
Determine and Plan for OCM Activities 
The  Planning  Process  Phase  focuses  on  building  support  for  the  change 
initiative. Similar to the prior process phase, OCM activities within the Planning 
Process Phase must be identified, resourced, and scheduled. As these items are 
addressed, they are added to the OCM Schedule that was established during the 
Initiating Process Phase. To update the OCM Schedule with Planning Process 
Phase activities, the OCM Practitioner should complete the following: 
•   Review the entirety of this chapter to identify the various activities and 
outputs that must be developed within each knowledge area in the 
Planning Process Phase. 
•   Based on the project and organizational characteristics, identify the  
tasks necessary to complete the identified activities. Consider any 
constraints that will dictate the timing, frequency and order the activities 
need to be completed. 
•   Estimate the duration and efort to complete each task. Consider the scope  
and complexity of the project when estimating. 
•   Work with the Project Manager to identify available resources to complete  
the tasks. The availability of resources to support the efort may require   
re-work of the schedule. 
The  OCM  Practitioner  should  work  with  the  Project  Manager  and  leverage 
the  project  organization  chart,  Stakeholder  Register,  Project  Management 
Plan  (PMP),  and  Schedule  Management  Plan  to  identify  and  allocate  these 
resources in the OCM Schedule. Once the schedule has been developed, the 
OCM Practitioner will work with the Project Manager to integrate the tasks into 
the greater project schedule to monitor and control.

In the Concept Process Phase, the OCM Practitioner completed an Environmental 
Readiness Assessment to gauge the organization at a high level on the readiness 
in  four  environmental  areas:  organizational  readiness,  leadership  readiness, 
employee  readiness,  and  supporting  infrastructure  readiness.  During  the 
Initiating Process Phase, a Change Magnitude Assessment was conducted to 
support OCM eforts. In the Planning Process Phase, the OCM Practitioner must 
conduct additional assessments based on each of the knowledge areas in order 
to consider the needs of the Stakeholders. An Organizational Change Readiness 
Assessment  helps  the  OCM  Practitioner  assess  the  organization’s  readiness 
and  need  for  focused  OCM  eforts  in  all  knowledge  areas.  This  assessment, 
completed  by  representative  populations  at  all  organizational  levels  (e.g., 
executives, managers, staf), allows the OCM Practitioner to tailor the OCM Plan 
and OCM activities to the specific needs at each level. 
The OCM Practitioner should work with the Project Sponsor and Project Manager 
to determine an appropriate sample size and method for identifying participants 
to complete the Organizational Change Readiness Assessment. Some projects 
may  find  it  easiest  to  determine  a  relative  sample  size  and  randomly  select 
participants  from  each  organizational  level.  Also  to  be  considered  is  the 
method for survey distribution. The OCM Practitioner may choose to send the 
Organizational  Change  Readiness  Assessment  electronically,  or  bring  survey 
participants together in small focus groups to introduce the change and conduct 
the survey. Regardless of the sample size and method of assessment, the OCM 
Practitioner should ensure all organizational levels are represented. 
The Organizational Change Readiness Assessment contains multiple statements 
regarding each knowledge area for the participant to rate on a scale from 1 to 
5, with 1 indicating strongly disagree and 5 indicating strongly agree. Sample 
statements are listed below. 
•   Feedback processes are continually being used to determine how 
efectively change is being adopted. 
•   The organization uses multiple communication methods to keep 
Stakeholders informed. 
•   The Project Sponsor and executive leadership build awareness for the 
need for change and why the change is happening. 
•   Stakeholders feel heard and understood when expressing concerns or 
asking questions regarding the project.

Readiness Assessment 
Planning | Page 13

organizational level in each knowledge area. The numerical score provided for 
each  statement  provides  insight  into  where  OCM  eforts  should  be  targeted. 
The  OCM  Practitioner  will  average  the  scores  for  all  statements  within  each 
knowledge area section to provide an idea of the overall level of efort a group 
needs in a particular knowledge area. 
As a general rule, knowledge areas with an average score of three or less indicate 
that the organization is not fully prepared in that knowledge area and the OCM 
Practitioner  should  focus  OCM  eforts  in  that  area.  For  example,  if  the  OCM 
Practitioner identifies that the average score for the Communication Knowledge 
Area  is  2  for  staf-level  representatives,  the  OCM  Practitioner  can  plan  and 
execute OCM activities directed at the staf level to improve communications. 
The OCM Practitioner may also identify specific aspects of communication that  
should  be  addressed  by  reviewing  the  scores  for  each  statement  related  to  
the  Communication  Knowledge  Area.  For  example,  in  reviewing  assessments  
completed  by  staf-level  representatives,  if  the  OCM  Practitioner  identifies  an  
average score of 1 for statements regarding feedback, the Practitioner can review  
and tailor the feedback process to capture and respond to staf level feedback. 
In reviewing the results of the Organizational Change Readiness Assessment, 
the OCM Practitioner may determine the need to address certain knowledge 
area eforts to specific groups or to the organization as a whole. For example, 
the OCM Practitioner may identify Stakeholder Enrollment as an area needing 
focus for the entire organization; however, the assessment results may lead the 
OCM Practitioner to direct Leadership Support activities primarily to the staf  
level of the organization. 
The OCM Practitioner should utilize the results of the Organizational Change 
Readiness Assessment as an input to the overarching OCM Plan and Schedule. 
Within  the  OCM  Plan,  the  assessment  results  help  to  define  and  focus  the 
knowledge area activities that are detailed. 
Develop the OCM Plan 
The  OCM  Practitioner  develops  the  OCM  Plan  to  document  an  approach  for 
managing  the  change,  integrating  activities  from  all  knowledge  areas,  and 
discussing how activities translate into actions for the Executing Process Phase. 
This plan draws upon the Organizational Change Readiness Assessment results, 
industry research, and the experiences of the OCM Practitioner to provide an 
understanding  of  the  change  in  the  organization  when  the  people-related

should carefully read each of the knowledge area sections within the Executing 
Process Phase Chapter to identify and understand the activities to include in 
the OCM Plan. 
The OCM Plan documents the following elements: 
•   Scope of the OCM Efort: The OCM scope refers to the extent to which 
knowledge area activities are implemented for diferent Stakeholder 
groups. The OCM Practitioner should consider the results of the 
Organizational Change Readiness Assessment, industry research, lessons 
learned from previous change initiatives, and the Practitioner’s own 
experiences and organizational knowledge. 
•   Management of the OCM Efort: The OCM Practitioner should also 
consider the details surrounding how the OCM efort will be managed.  
Who will implement specific activities? How will progress and efectiveness 
of activities be monitored? How will the reporting process function? 
Management of the OCM efort should align with the management 
strategies set forth in the Project Management Plan (PMP) and all 
subordinate plans. 
•   Roles and Responsibilities Associated with the OCM Efort: In many 
projects, the OCM Practitioner role may be split between multiple 
resources. There may be separate sub-teams for diferent knowledge 
areas or a few resources managing activities in multiple knowledge areas. 
Regardless, it is important to identify the roles and responsibilities of 
the OCM Practitioner(s), Project Manager, Project Sponsor, project team, 
and any other identified resources specific to the OCM efort. The OCM 
Practitioner should collaborate with the Project Manager and Project 
Sponsor to clearly define all OCM-specific roles and responsibilities. 
•   OCM Activities: The OCM Practitioner identifies OCM activities appropriate 
for his/her organization and change efort based on the Organizational 
Change Readiness Assessment results, industry best practices, lessons 
learned from previous change eforts, and the Practitioner’s own OCM 
experience and organizational knowledge. OCM activities should focus 
on high priority knowledge areas and Stakeholder groups, and remain in 
alignment with the OCM scope. It is important to note that while the OCM 
Practitioner may identify specific activities when initially developing the 
OCM Plan, these may be modified, eliminated, or added to throughout the 
Executing and Closing Process Phases depending on the changing needs 
of the organization and the efectiveness of certain activities. 
Planning | Page 15 
California Department of TechnologyOrganizational Change Management FrameworkPlanningOCM Lifecycle Management•   Key Milestones: The OCM Plan should summarize the key milestones in 
OCM Schedule, which has been updated in this process phase. 
Once the OCM Plan is completed, it can be leveraged during the Planning Process  
Phase  to  scope  and  appropriately  resource  the  OCM  efort  to  determine  the  
project requirements. The OCM Practitioner will later use the OCM Plan to guide  
the activities, tools, and schedule for all OCM eforts throughout the Executing  
and Closing Process Phases. The OCM Plan serves as a subordinate plan to the  
Project Management Plan. 
Conduct OCM Activities 
In the Initiating Process Phase, the OCM Practitioner reviewed the results of the 
Environmental  Readiness  Assessment  and  Change  Magnitude  Assessment  in 
order to identify necessary OCM activities, OCM related risks and issues, and 
create the OCM Schedule. In the Planning Process Phase, the OCM Practitioner 
may find it necessary to continue with the activities that were started in the 
Initiating Process Phase to fully address the OCM priority areas. 
For example, the activities prescribed in the OCM Schedule during Initiating may 
focus on providing coaching to key executives in order to get them more involved 
with the project and comfortable in their roles. In this case, the OCM Practitioner 
will continue to schedule coaching sessions, if needed, with identified leaders 
throughout the Planning Process Phase. In addition to the coaching sessions 
identified  in  Initiating,  the  OCM  Practitioner  may  also  schedule  executive 
leadership discussions as prescribed in the Leadership Support Knowledge Area 
in this chapter. By modifying, augmenting, and following the OCM Schedule, the 
OCM Practitioner can manage and adjust the OCM planning efort through the 
remainder of the Planning Process Phase.

at times, uncertain about the upcoming changes. Communication is necessary 
to educate Stakeholders about the business case, the benefits of the project, 
the ultimate impact on the business environment, and the people involved. 
Figure  2-3  demonstrates  the  goals  of  the  Communication  Knowledge  Area. 
Communication activities begin in the Planning Process Phase to communicate 
the business need, key milestones, and details on the transition to Executing. It 
also is important to begin setting the stage for employees to be involved in the 
project, as some will participate in designing the future business processes and 
identifying functional requirements. Figure 2-4 provides the inputs, roles, skills,

the project team to develop a Communication Management Plan and deliver 
communications. Efective communication management supports: 
•   Meeting Stakeholder information needs 
•   Tracking and reporting project performance 
•   Formally documenting project results 
•   Garnering enthusiasm and support for the project 
•   Sharing information and providing feedback channels 
Develop Communication Management Plan 
Communication  is  a  vital  part  of  any  change  initiative.  Employees  and 
Stakeholders rely on communication messages to understand the change and 
set their expectations of the project and project outcomes. As such, a strong 
Communication Management Plan at this stage will begin the process of enrolling 
Employees  and  Stakeholders  in  the  project  initiative.  The  Communication 
Management Plan should support and align with the information documented 
in  the  Project  Charter,  Project  Management  Plan,  Stakeholder  Register,  and
