A Survey Material
A.1 Ante Hoc Demographic Questionnaire
1. What is your age? (18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, +65, NA)?

print, face, voice, other)
8. Without telling me your current passcode, how do you select the passcodes you use?
9. How concerned are you with keeping your phone secure (1, not at all concerned, to 5, highly concerned)?
10. What experiences can you recall involving people either trying to steal or use your phone without
permission?
11. What experiences can you recall involving people trying to observe your passcodes without permission?
12. How concerned are you with the threat of someone watching you authenticate and collecting your
passcodes (1, not at all concerned, to 5, highly concerned)?
13. If you had any of these experiences, how did it aﬀect your behavior?
14. Have any other experiences or concerns aﬀected your authentication?
A.2 Post Hoc Participant Strategies Questionnaire Questions
1. What strategies did you employ to collect the passcodes?
2. Do you have any ideas for additional strategies?
3. How challenging was it to collect PIN passcodes (1, not at all challenging, to 5, very challenging)?
4. How challenging was it to collect grid passcodes (1, not at all challenging, to 5, very challenging)?
5. What features of the passcodes made it easier or more diﬃcult to collect the passcodes you saw?
6. How did the number of views you were given make a diﬀerence?
7. How did which side you stood on make any diﬀerence?

A.4 Guide/Script for Administering Study
1. Verify current participant number, exp (1-4, order (a-c). Record this.
2. Introduction - ”Welcome, thanks for participating. Our study deals with the security of diﬀerent types
of passcodes for mobile phones. Your help today will be pretty straightforward. We will record some
basic demographic information about you. You will observe someone entering in passcodes from a few
feet away, and write down your best guess of what you have seen. We will go over the steps required
to make sure you are comfortable and understand your role. We will record the session to verify the
22
results. All data collected will be anonymized for publication. Your part in the study should take
about 20-30 minutes.”
3. Payment - ”The study pays 5 USD.”
4. Observer disclosure - ”Are there any issues, such as corrective glasses or contacts, which might interfere
with performing the role I have described?”
5. IRB Introduction - ”This study has been reviewed by the University’s review board, the IRB, and
approved as safe and ethical. Here is a copy of that form that describes the study that you can read.
Please ask any questions you may have, and sign the form if you would like to participate.”
6. Demographic questionnaire - ”Please ﬁll out the demographic questionnaire.”
7. Training: Overview - ”Here is the process your role as an observer. You will stand to the left or right
behind our researcher, who will sit in the same position entering in passcodes. We will specify where
to stand for each attempt. You will watch each attempt, and then draw on the form we provide your
best guess of the passcode you just saw being entered on the phone. Passcodes may vary in length.
We will repeat this ten times.”
8. Training: Filling out the form diagrams - ”Look at the form we have provided.
It has blank PIN
and grid pattern diagrams for you to enter your guesses. For the grid patterns passcodes, draw the
shape you saw entered, and circle the starting point of the shape. For PIN passcodes, write out the
sequence, like ”1234”, and draw the shape you saw entered.” [Demonstrate drawing a diagram, then
allow the participant to practice drawing 2-3 times, based on a practice code for their prescribed
passcode condition (PIN, grid, no-line grid) that you show them slowly, up close, on a phone. Conﬁrm
for grid shapes that they are circling the starting point. Correct any issues that appear, and repeat
until ready.]
9. Training: Taking position for each attempt - ”We will call out a position, LEFT or RIGHT, for you to
stand in for each attempt. Move to the corresponding marker on the ﬂoor, ﬁgure out which diagram you
are going to ﬁll in, and when set to begin, say ”Ready.” Sometimes, we may also call out MULTIPLE
if you are allowed to view the passcode being entered twice before making your ﬁnal guess.” ”Any
questions?”
10. Post hoc questionnaire - [Conduct post hoc interview]
