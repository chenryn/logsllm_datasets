### A. Thresholds for Control State Deviation

We describe the methodology for determining the threshold values used by our control instability detector to detect control state deviations, as discussed in Section 4.2. Our experiments utilized the AVC2013 mission (Section 5) and thirty additional experimental missions, following the approach of existing work [38]. Specifically, the thresholds are determined by applying the three-sigma rule [65] to the top deviation values. For the time window (w) in the IAE formula, we set it to the duration of each mission segment (i.e., the flight segment between two consecutive waypoints) within a mission. The threshold values for each control state are presented in Table 2.

It is important to note that we do not monitor control state deviations in the second derivative states of the 6DoF (i.e., acceleration of any of the 6DoF). This is because oscillations in these states can potentially cause false positives. In fact, some control programs, such as ArduPilot, do not control the angular acceleration of roll, pitch, and yaw for the same reason. However, RVFUZZER can detect control state deviations in these second derivative states through their indirect impacts on dependent states. The control state deviations in the second derivative states propagate to their integral states (e.g., the first derivative states of the 6DoF), as their controls are intrinsically related.

#### Table 2: List of Threshold Values for Each Control State

| Control Program | Latitude/Longitude | Position | Velocity | Altitude Position | Altitude Velocity | Roll | Roll Rate | Pitch | Pitch Rate | Yaw | Yaw Rate |
|-----------------|--------------------|----------|----------|-------------------|-------------------|------|-----------|-------|------------|-----|----------|
| ArduPilot       | 11.62 m            | 1.23 m/s | 4.71 m/s | 2.06 m            | 0.26 m/s          | 2.66 deg | 2.83 deg/s | 4.64 deg | 3.43 m     | 0.12 m/s | 1.98 deg | 3.68 deg/s | 10.67 deg/s | 15.35 deg/s | 4.13 deg | 6.16 deg | 16.24 deg/s | 14.69 deg/s |
| PX4             | 10.08 m            | 3.94 deg | 10.67 deg/s | 15.35 deg/s | 4.13 deg | 6.16 deg | 16.24 deg/s | 14.69 deg/s |

### B. Physical Impacts Caused by Input Validation Bug Exploitation

We provide detailed information about the input validation bugs discovered by RVFUZZER and the implications of attacks exploiting these bugs in Tables 3 (for ArduPilot) and Table 4 (for PX4). The columns in each table show: (1) the control program modules where the bugs are located, (2) the vulnerable control parameters (i.e., those with erroneous range specifications or implementations), and (3) the possible physical impacts caused by the attacks exploiting the bugs.

The possible impacts are categorized into four types: “C” – vehicle crash; “D” – deviation from trajectory; “U” – unstable vehicle movement; and “S” – vehicle getting “stuck” at a certain location or speed. All of these impacts are non-transient and cannot be recovered by the controllers.
