## Overview
- **Topic**: The security of US dollar notes.
- **Focus**: Implementation and effectiveness of security features.
- **Relevance**: The widespread use and economic importance of US dollars, and the potential for counterfeiting to destabilize economies.

## Scope
- **In Scope**: Security features of US dollar notes.
- **Out of Scope**: Coins and other aspects of counterfeiting.

## Warning/Disclaimer
- **Legal Notice**: Counterfeiting is a serious crime. Do not attempt to counterfeit or pass counterfeit currency under any circumstances. It is one of the few crimes explicitly defined in the US Constitution, alongside piracy and treason.

## US Dollar History
- **Design Evolution**:
  - Prior to 1996, the design of US dollar notes had remained largely unchanged since 1928.
  - Advances in cheap color scanning and printing equipment prompted redesign efforts starting in 1993.
  - Design security was revisited in 2006 and 2007.
- **Contributions to Anti-Counterfeit Research**:
  - Experts from various institutions, including the National Academies, IBM Research, Drexel University, New York University, and many others, contributed to anti-counterfeit research.
