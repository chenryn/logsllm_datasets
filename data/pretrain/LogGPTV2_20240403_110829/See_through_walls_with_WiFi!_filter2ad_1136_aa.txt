ABSTRACT
Wi-Fi signals are typically information carriers between a trans-
mitter and a receiver. In this paper, we show that Wi-Fi can also
extend our senses, enabling us to see moving objects through walls
and behind closed doors. In particular, we can use such signals to
identify the number of people in a closed room and their relative
locations. We can also identify simple gestures made behind a wall,
and combine a sequence of gestures to communicate messages to
a wireless receiver without carrying any transmitting device. The
paper introduces two main innovations. First, it shows how one can
use MIMO interference nulling to eliminate reﬂections off static
objects and focus the receiver on a moving target. Second, it shows
how one can track a human by treating the motion of a human body
as an antenna array and tracking the resulting RF beam. We demon-
strate the validity of our design by building it into USRP software
radios and testing it in ofﬁce buildings.

INTRODUCTION
Can Wi-Fi signals enable us to see through walls? For many
years humans have fantasized about X-ray vision and played with
the concept in comic books and sci-ﬁ movies. This paper explores
the potential of using Wi-Fi signals and recent advances in MIMO
communications to build a device that can capture the motion of
humans behind a wall and in closed rooms. Law enforcement per-
sonnel can use the device to avoid walking into an ambush, and
minimize casualties in standoffs and hostage situations. Emergency
responders can use it to see through rubble and collapsed structures.
Ordinary users can leverage the device for gaming, intrusion detec-
tion, privacy-enhanced monitoring of children and elderly, or per-
sonal security when stepping into dark alleys and unknown places.
The concept underlying seeing through opaque obstacles is sim-
ilar to radar and sonar imaging. Speciﬁcally, when faced with a
non-metallic wall, a fraction of the RF signal would traverse the
wall, reﬂect off objects and humans, and come back imprinted with
a signature of what is inside a closed room. By capturing these re-
ﬂections, we can image objects behind a wall. Building a device
that can capture such reﬂections, however, is difﬁcult because the

signal power after traversing the wall twice (in and out of the room)
is reduced by three to ﬁve orders of magnitude [11]. Even more
challenging are the reﬂections from the wall itself, which are much
stronger than the reﬂections from objects inside the room [11, 27].
Reﬂections off the wall overwhelm the receiver’s analog to digital
converter (ADC), preventing it from registering the minute varia-
tions due to reﬂections from objects behind the wall. This behavior
is called the “Flash Effect" since it is analogous to how a mirror in
front of a camera reﬂects the camera’s ﬂash and prevents it from
capturing objects in the scene.
So how can one overcome these difﬁculties? The radar com-
munity has been investigating these issues, and has recently in-
troduced a few ultra-wideband systems that can detect humans
moving behind a wall, and show them as blobs moving in a dim
background [27, 41] (see the video at [6] for a reference). Today’s
state-of-the-art system requires 2 GHz of bandwidth, a large power
source, and an 8-foot long antenna array (2.4 meters) [12, 27].
Apart from the bulkiness of the device, blasting power in such a
wide spectrum is infeasible for entities other than the military. The
requirement for multi-GHz transmission is at the heart of how these
systems work: they separate reﬂections off the wall from reﬂec-
tions from the objects behind the wall based on their arrival time,
and hence need to identify sub-nanosecond delays (i.e., multi-GHz
bandwidth) to ﬁlter the ﬂash effect.1 To address these limitations,
an initial attempt was made in 2012 to use Wi-Fi to see through a
wall [13]. However, to mitigate the ﬂash effect, this past proposal
needs to install an additional receiver behind the wall, and connect
the receivers behind and in front of the wall to a joint clock via
wires [13].
The objective of this paper is to enable a see-through-wall tech-
nology that is low-bandwidth, low-power, compact, and accessible
to non-military entities. To this end, the paper introduces Wi-Vi,2 a
see-through-wall device that employs Wi-Fi signals in the 2.4 GHz
ISM band. Wi-Vi limits itself to a 20 MHz-wide Wi-Fi channel,
and avoids ultra-wideband solutions used today to address the ﬂash
effect. It also disposes of the large antenna array, typical in past
systems, and uses instead a smaller 3-antenna MIMO radio.
So, how does Wi-Vi eliminate the ﬂash effect without using GHz
of bandwidth? We observe that we can adapt recent advances in
MIMO communications to through-wall imaging. In MIMO, mul-
tiple antenna systems can encode their transmissions so that the sig-
nal is nulled (i.e., sums up to zero) at a particular receive antenna.
MIMO systems use this capability to eliminate interference to un-
wanted receivers. In contrast, we use nulling to eliminate reﬂections
from static objects, including the wall. Speciﬁcally, a Wi-Vi device
has two transmit antennas and a single receive antenna. Wi-Vi op-
erates in two stages. In the ﬁrst stage, it measures the channels from
each of its two transmit antennas to its receive antenna. In stage 2,
the two transmit antennas use the channel measurements from stage
1 to null the signal at the receive antenna. Since wireless signals (in-
cluding reﬂections) combine linearly over the medium, only reﬂec-
tions off objects that move between the two stages are captured in

75stage 2. Reﬂections off static objects, including the wall, are nulled
in this stage. In §4, we reﬁne this basic idea by introducing iterative
nulling, which allows us to eliminate residual ﬂash and the weaker
reﬂections from static objects behind the wall.
Second, how does Wi-Vi track moving objects without an an-
tenna array? To address this challenge, we borrow a technique
called inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR), which has been used
for mapping the surfaces of the Earth and other planets. ISAR uses
the movement of the target to emulate an antenna array. As shown in
Fig. 1, a device using an antenna array would capture a target from
spatially spaced antennas and process this information to identify
the direction of the target with respect to the array (i.e., θ). In con-
trast, in ISAR, there is only one receive antenna; hence, at any point
in time, we capture a single measurement. Nevertheless, since the
target is moving, consecutive measurements in time emulate an in-
verse antenna array – i.e., it is as if the moving human is imaging
the Wi-Vi device. By processing such consecutive measurements
using standard antenna array beam steering, Wi-Vi can identify the
spatial direction of the human. In §5.2, we extend this method to
multiple moving targets.
Additionally, Wi-Vi leverages its ability to track motion to en-
able a through-wall gesture-based communication channel. Specif-
ically, a human can communicate messages to a Wi-Vi receiver via
gestures without carrying any wireless device. We have picked two
simple body gestures to refer to “0” and “1” bits. A human behind
a wall may use a short sequence of these gestures to send a mes-
sage to Wi-Vi. After applying a matched ﬁlter, the message signal
looks similar to standard BPSK encoding (a positive signal for a
“1” bit, and a negative signal for a “0” bit) and can be decoded by
considering the sign of the signal. The system enables law enforce-
ment personnel to communicate with their team across a wall, even
if their communication devices are conﬁscated.
We built a prototype of Wi-Vi using USRP N210 radios and eval-
uated it in two ofﬁce buildings. Our results are as follows:
• Wi-Vi can detect objects and humans moving behind opaque
structural obstructions. This applies to 8!! concrete walls, 6!! hol-
low walls, and 1.75!! solid wooden doors.
• A Wi-Vi device pointed at a closed room with 6!! hollow walls
supported by steel frames can distinguish between 0, 1, 2, and 3
moving humans in the room. Computed over 80 trials with 8 hu-
man subjects, Wi-Vi achieves an accuracy of 100%, 100%, 85%,
and 90% respectively in each of these cases.
• In the same room, and given a single person sending gesture-
based messages, Wi-Vi correctly decodes all messages per-
formed at distances equal to or smaller than 5 meters. The de-
coding accuracy decreases to 75% at distances of 8 meters, and
the device stops detecting gestures beyond 9 meters. For 8 vol-
unteers who participated in the experiment, on average, it took a
person 8.8 seconds to send a message of 4 gestures.
• In comparison to the state-of-the-art ultra-wideband see-through-
wall radar [27], Wi-Vi is limited in two ways. First, replacing the
antenna array by ISAR means that the angular resolution in Wi-
Vi depends on the amount of movement. To achieve a narrow
beam the human needs to move by about 4 wavelengths (i.e.,
about 50 cm). Second, in contrast to [27], we cannot detect hu-
mans behind concrete walls thicker than 8!!. This is due to both
the much lower transmit power from our USRPs and the residual
ﬂash power from imperfect nulling. On the other hand, nulling
the ﬂash removes the need for GHz bandwidth. It also removes
clutter from all static reﬂectors, rather than just one wall. This in-
cludes other walls in the environments as well as furniture inside
and outside the imaged room. To reduce clutter, the empirical re-
sults in past work are typically collected using a person-height
standing wall, positioned either outdoors or in large empty in-

dard ofﬁce buildings with the imaged humans inside closed fully-
furnished rooms.
Contributions: In contrast to past work which targets the military,
Wi-Vi introduces novel solutions to the see-through-wall problem
that enable non-military entities to use this technology. Speciﬁcally,
Wi-Vi is the ﬁrst to introduce interference nulling as a mechanism
for eliminating the ﬂash effect without requiring wideband spec-
trum. It is also the ﬁrst to replace the antenna array at the receiver
with an emulated array based on human motion. The combination
of those techniques enables small cheap devices that operate in the
ISM band, and can be made accessible to the general public. Fur-
ther, Wi-Vi is the ﬁrst to demonstrate a gesture-based communica-
tion channel that operates through walls and does not require the
human to carry any wireless device.
2. RELATED WORK
Wi-Vi is related to past work in three major areas:
Through-wall radar. Interest in through-wall imaging has been
surging for about a decade [5]. Earlier work in this domain focused
on simulations [38, 28] and modeling [32, 33]. Recently, there have
been some implementations tested with moving humans [27, 41,
13]. These past systems eliminate the ﬂash effect by isolating the
signal reﬂected off the wall from signals reﬂected off objects be-
hind the wall. This isolation can be achieved in the time domain,
by using very short pulses (less than 1ns) [40, 5] whereby the pulse
reﬂected off the wall arrives earlier in time than that reﬂected off
moving objects behind it. Alternatively, it may be achieved in the
frequency domain by using a linear frequency chirp [11, 27]. In
this case, reﬂections off objects at different distances arrive with
different tones. By analog ﬁltering the tone that corresponds to the
wall, one may remove the ﬂash effect. These techniques require
ultra-wide bandwidths (UWB) of the order of 2 GHz [11, 40]. Sim-
ilarly, through-wall imaging products developed by the industry [5,
7] hinge on the same radar principles, requiring multiple GHz of
bandwidth and hence are targeted solely at the military.
As a through-wall imaging technology, Wi-Vi differs from all
the above systems in that it requires only few MHz of bandwidth
and operates in the same range as Wi-Fi. It overcomes the need for
UWB by leveraging MIMO nulling to remove the ﬂash effect.
Researchers have recognized the limitations of UWB systems
and explored the potential of using narrowband radars for through-
wall technologies [29, 30]. These systems ignore the ﬂash effect
and try to operate in presence of high interference caused by reﬂec-
tions off the wall. They typically rely on detecting the Doppler shift
caused by moving objects behind the wall. However, the ﬂash effect
76limits their detection capabilities. Hence, most of these systems are
demonstrated either in simulation [28], or in free space with no ob-
struction [21, 23]. The ones demonstrated with an obstruction use
a low-attenuation standing wall, and do not work across higher at-
tenuation materials such as solid wood or concrete [29, 30]. Wi-Vi
shares the objectives of these devices; however, it introduces a new
approach for eliminating the ﬂash effect without wideband trans-
mission. This enables it to work with concrete walls and solid wood
doors, as well as fully closed rooms.
The only attempt which we are aware of that uses Wi-Fi signals
in order to see through walls was made in 2012 [13]. This system
required both the transmitter and a reference receiver to be inside
the imaged room. Furthermore, the reference receiver in the room
has to be connected to the same clock as the receiver outside the
room. In contrast, Wi-Vi can perform through-wall imaging without
access to any device on the other side of the wall.
Gesture-based interfaces. Today, commercial gesture-recognition
systems – such as the Xbox Kinect [9], Nintendo Wii [4], etc. – can
identify a wide variety of gestures. The academic community has
also developed systems capable of identifying human gestures ei-
ther by employing cameras [24] or by placing sensors on the human
body [15, 20]. Recent work has also leveraged narrowband signals
in the 2.4 GHz range to identify human activities in line-of-sight
using micro-Doppler signatures [21]. Wi-Vi, however, presents the
ﬁrst gesture-based interface that works in non-line-of-sight scenar-
ios, and even through a wall, yet does not require the human to carry
a wireless device or wear a set of sensors.
Infrared and thermal imaging. Similar to Wi-Vi, these technolo-
gies extend human vision beyond the visible electromagnetic range,
allowing us to detect objects in the dark or in smoke. They operate
by capturing infrared or thermal energy reﬂected off the ﬁrst ob-
stacle in line-of-sight of their sensors. However, cameras based on
these technologies cannot see through walls because they have very
short wavelengths (few µm to sub-mm) [37], unlike Wi-Vi which
employs signals whose wavelengths are 12.5 cm.3
3. WI-VI OVERVIEW
Wi-Vi is a wireless device that captures moving objects behind a
wall. It leverages the ubiquity of Wi-Fi chipsets to make through-
wall imaging relatively low-power, low-cost, low-bandwidth, and
accessible to average users. To this end, Wi-Vi uses Wi-Fi OFDM
signals in the ISM band (at 2.4 GHz) and typical Wi-Fi hardware.
Wi-Vi is essentially a 3-antenna MIMO device: two of the anten-
nas are used for transmitting and one is used for receiving. It also
employs directional antennas to focus the energy toward the wall
or room of interest.4 Its design incorporates two main components:
1) the ﬁrst component eliminates the ﬂash reﬂected off the wall by
performing MIMO nulling; 2) the second component tracks a mov-
ing object by treating the object itself as an antenna array using a
technique called inverse SAR.
Wi-Vi can be used in one of two modes, depending on the user’s
choice. In mode 1, it can be used to image moving objects behind a
wall and track them. In mode 2, on the other hand, Wi-Vi functions
as a gesture-based interface from behind a wall that enables humans
to compose messages and send them to the Wi-Vi receiver.
In sections 4-6, we describe Wi-Vi’s operation in detail.
4. ELIMINATING THE FLASH
3The longer the wavelength of an electromagnetic wave is, the lower its
attenuation is [35]. Infrared and thermal imaging devices employ signals
whose wavelengths are very close to visible light; hence, they do not pene-
trate building materials such as wood or concrete.
4Directional antennas have a form factor on the order of the wavelength. At
Wi-Fi frequencies, this corresponds to approximately 12 cm.

In any through-wall system, the signal reﬂected off the wall, i.e.,
the ﬂash, is much stronger than any signal reﬂected from objects
behind the wall. This is due to the signiﬁcant attenuation which
electromagnetic signals suffer when penetrating dense obstacles.
Table 1 shows a few examples of the one-way attenuation expe-
rienced by Wi-Fi signals in common construction materials (based
on [1]). For example, a one-way traversal of a standard hollow wall
or a concrete wall can reduce Wi-Fi signal power by 9 dB and 18 dB
respectively. Since through-wall systems require traversing the ob-
stacle twice, the one-way attenuation doubles, leading to an 18-
36 dB ﬂash effect in typical indoor scenarios.
This problem is exacerbated by two other parameters: First, the
actual reﬂected signal is signiﬁcantly weaker since it depends both
on the reﬂection coefﬁcient as well as the cross-section of the ob-
ject. The wall is typically much larger than the objects of interest,
and has a higher reﬂection coefﬁcient [11]. Second, in addition to
the direct ﬂash caused by reﬂections off the wall, through-wall sys-
tems have to eliminate the direct signal from the transmit to the
receive antenna, which is signiﬁcantly larger than the reﬂections
