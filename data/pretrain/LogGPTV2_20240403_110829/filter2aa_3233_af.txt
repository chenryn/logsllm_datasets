Several existing federal policies and guidance intersect with the planning, deployment, and 
operation of a ZTA. These policies do not prohibit an enterprise from moving to a more zero 
trust-oriented architecture but can influence development of a zero trust strategy for an agency. 
When complemented with existing cybersecurity policies and guidance, ICAM, continuous 
monitoring, and general cyber hygiene, ZTA may reinforce an organization’s security posture 
and protect against common threats. 
6.1 
ZTA and NIST Risk Management Framework 
A ZTA deployment involves developing access polices around acceptable risk to the designated 
mission or business process (see Section 7.3.3). It is possible to deny all network access to a 
resource and allow access only via a connected terminal, but this is disproportionately restrictive 
in the majority of cases and could inhibit work from being accomplished. For a federal agency to 
perform its mission, there is an acceptable level of risk. The risks associated with performing the 
given mission must be identified and evaluated, and either accepted or mitigated. To assist in 
this, the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) was developed [SP800-37]. 
ZTA planning and implementation may change the authorization boundaries defined by the 
enterprise. This is due to the addition of new components (e.g., policy engine, policy 
administrator, and PEPs) and a reduction of reliance on network perimeter defenses. The overall 
process described in the RMF will not change in a ZTA.  
6.2 
Zero Trust and NIST Privacy Framework 
Protecting the privacy of users and private information (e.g., personally identifiable information) 
is a prime concern for organizations. Privacy and data protections are included in compliance 
programs such as FISMA and the Heath Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). 
In response, NIST produced a Privacy Framework for use by organizations [NISTPRIV]. This 
document provides a framework to describe privacy risks and mitigation strategies, as well as a 
process for an enterprise to identify, measure, and mitigate risks to user privacy and private 
information stored and processed by an organization. This includes personal information used by 
the enterprise to support ZTA operations and any biometric attributes used in access request 
evaluations. 
Part of the core requirements for ZT is that an enterprise should inspect and log traffic (or at least 
log and inspect metadata when dealing with traffic that cannot be decrypted by monitoring 
systems) in its environment. Some of this traffic may contain private information or have 
associated privacy risks. Organizations will need to identify any possible risks associated with 
intercepting, scanning, and logging network traffic [NISTIR 8062]. This may include actions 
such as informing users, obtaining consent (via a login page, banner, or similar), and educating 
enterprise users. The NIST Privacy Framework [NISTPRIV] could help in developing a formal 
process to identify and mitigate any privacy-related risks to an enterprise developing a zero trust 
architecture.

6.3 
ZTA and Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management Architecture  
Subject provisioning is a key component of ZTA. The policy engine cannot determine if 
attempted connections are authorized to connect to a resource if the PE has insufficient 
information to identify associated subjects and resources. Strong subject provision and 
authentication policies need to be in place before moving to a more zero trust–aligned 
deployment. Enterprises need a clear set of subject attributes and policies that can be used by a 
PE to evaluate access requests. 
The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued M-19-17 on improving identity 
management for the Federal Government. The goal of the policy is to develop “…a common 
vision for identity as an enabler of mission delivery, trust, and safety of the Nation” [M-19-17]. 
The memo calls on all federal agencies to form an ICAM office to govern efforts related to 
identity issuance and management. Many of these management policies should use the 
recommendations in NIST SP 800-63-3, Digital Identity Guidelines [SP800-63]. As ZTA is 
heavily dependent on precise identity management, any ZTA effort will need to integrate the 
agency’s ICAM policy.  
6.4 
ZTA and Trusted Internet Connections 3.0 
TIC is a federal cybersecurity initiative jointly managed by OMB, DHS, and the General 
Services Administration (GSA), and is intended to establish a network security baseline across 
the Federal Government. Historically, TIC was a perimeter-based cybersecurity strategy which 
required agencies to consolidate and monitor their external network connections. Inherent in TIC 
1.0 and TIC 2.0 is the assumption that the inside of the perimeter is “trusted,” whereas ZTA 
assumes that network location does not infer “trust” (i.e., there is no “trust” on an agency’s 
internal network). TIC 2.0 provides a list of network-based security capabilities (e.g. content 
filtering, monitoring, authentication, and others) to be deployed at the TIC Access Point at the 
agency’s perimeter; many of these capabilities are aligned with ZT principles.  
TIC 3.0 has been updated to accommodate cloud services and mobile devices [M-19-26]. In TIC 
3.0, it is recognized that the definition of “trust” may vary across specific computing contexts 
and that agencies have different risk tolerances for defining trust zones.  In addition, TIC 3.0 has 
an updated TIC Security Capability Handbook, which defines two types of security capabilities: 
(1) Universal Security Capabilities that apply at the enterprise level, and (2) PEP Security 
Capabilities that are network-level capabilities to be applied to multiple policy enforcement 
points (PEPs), as defined in TIC use cases.  The PEP Security Capabilities may be applied at any 
appropriate PEP located along a given data flow instead of at a single PEP at the agency 
perimeter. Many of these TIC 3.0 security capabilities directly support ZTA (e.g., encrypted 
traffic, strong authentication, microsegmentation, network and system inventory, and others). 
TIC 3.0 defines specific use cases that describe the implementation of trust zones and security 
capabilities across specific applications, services, and environments.  
TIC 3.0 is focused on network-based security protections, whereas ZTA is a more inclusive 
architecture addressing application, user, and data protections. As TIC 3.0 evolves its use 
cases, it is likely that a ZTA TIC use case will be developed to define the network protections to 
be deployed at ZTA enforcement points.

6.5 
ZTA and EINSTEIN (NCPS – National Cybersecurity Protection System) 
NCPS (operationally known as EINSTEIN) is an integrated system-of-systems that delivers 
intrusion detection, advanced analytics, information sharing, and intrusion prevention 
capabilities to defend the Federal Government from cyber threats. The goals of NCPS, which 
align with the overarching goals of zero trust, are to manage cyber risk, improve cyber 
protection, and empower partners to secure cyber space. EINSTEIN sensors enable CISA’s 
National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) to defend federal 
networks and respond to significant incidents at federal agencies.  
The placement of NCPS sensors for DHS situational awareness is based on a perimeter network 
defense in the Federal Government, while ZTA moves protections closer to the assets, data and 
all other resources. The NCPS program is evolving to ensure that situational awareness is 
preserved through utilization of security information about cloud-based traffic, helping to set the 
foundation for expanded situational awareness telemetry from ZTA systems. NCPS intrusion 
prevention functions would also require evolution to be able to inform policy enforcement at 
both the current NCPS locations as well as ZTA systems. As ZTA is adopted across the Federal 
Government, the NCPS implementation would need to continually evolve, or new capabilities 
would need to be deployed to fulfill NCPS objectives. Incident responders could potentially 
leverage information from the authentication, traffic inspection, and logging of agency traffic 
available to federal agencies that have implemented a zero trust architecture. Information 
generated in a ZTA may better inform event impact quantification; machine learning tools could 
use ZTA data to improve detection; and additional logs from ZTA may be saved for after-the-
fact analyses by incident responders. 
6.6 
ZTA and DHS Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigations (CDM) Program 
The DHS CDM program is an effort to improve federal agency information technology (IT). 
Vital to that posture is an agency’s insight into the assets, configuration, and subjects within 
itself. To protect a system, agencies need to set up processes to discover and understand the basic 
components and actors in their infrastructure: 
• What is connected? What devices, applications, and services are used by the 
organization? This includes observing and improving the security posture of these 
artifacts as vulnerabilities and threats are discovered.  
• Who is using the network? What users are part of the organization or are external and 
allowed to access enterprise resources? These include NPEs that may be performing 
autonomous actions. 
• What is happening on the network? An enterprise needs insight into traffic patterns 
and messages between systems. 
• How is data protected? The enterprise needs a set policy on how information is 
protected at rest, in transit, and in use. 
Having a strong CDM program implementation is key to the success of ZTA. For example, to 
move to ZTA, an enterprise must have a system to discover and record physical and virtual 
assets to create a usable inventory. The DHS CDM program has initiated several efforts to build 
the capabilities needed within federal agencies to move to a ZTA. For example, the DHS

Hardware Asset Management (HWAM) [HWAM] program is an effort to help agencies identify 
devices on their network infrastructure to deploy a secure configuration. This is similar to the 
first steps in developing a road map to ZTA. Agencies must have visibility into the assets active 
on the network (or those accessing resources remotely) to categorize, configure, and monitor the 
network’s activity. 
6.7 
ZTA, Cloud Smart, and the Federal Data Strategy 
The Cloud Smart8 strategy, updated Data Center Optimization Initiative [M-19-19] policy, and 
Federal Data Strategy9 all influence some requirements for agencies planning a ZTA. These 
policies require agencies to inventory and assess how they collect, store, and access data, both on 
premises and in the cloud.  
This inventory is critical to determining what business processes and resources would benefit 
from implementing a ZTA. Data resources and applications and services that are primarily cloud-
based or primarily used by remote workers are good candidates for a ZTA approach (see Section 
7.3.3) because the subjects and resources are located outside of the enterprise network perimeter 
and are likely to see the most benefit in use, scalability, and security.  
One additional consideration with the Federal Data Strategy is how to make agency data assets 
accessible to other agencies or the public. This corresponds with the cross-enterprise 
collaboration ZTA use case (see Section 4.4). Agencies using a ZTA for these assets may need to 
take collaboration or publication requirements into account when developing the strategy.

Migrating to a Zero Trust Architecture 
Implementing a ZTA is a journey rather than a wholesale replacement of infrastructure or 
processes. An organization should seek to incrementally implement zero trust principles, process 
changes, and technology solutions that protect its highest value data assets. Most enterprises will 
continue to operate in a hybrid zero-trust/perimeter-based mode for an indefinite period while 
continuing to invest in ongoing IT modernization initiatives. Having an IT modernization plan 
that includes moving to an architecture based on ZT principles may help an enterprise form 
roadmaps for small scale workflow migrations. 
How an enterprise migrates to a strategy depends on its current cybersecurity posture and 
operations. An enterprise should reach a baseline of competence before it becomes possible to 
deploy a significant ZT-focused environment [ACT-IAC]. This baseline includes having assets, 
subjects, business processes, traffic flows and dependency mappings identified and cataloged for 
the enterprise. The enterprise needs this information before it can develop a list of candidate 
business processes and the subjects/assets involved in this process.  
7.1 
Pure Zero Trust Architecture 
In a greenfield approach, it would be possible to build a zero trust architecture from the ground 
up. Assuming the enterprise knows the applications/services and workflows that it wants to use 
for its operations, it can produce an architecture based on zero trust tenets for those workflows. 
Once the workflows are identified, the enterprise can narrow down the components needed and 
begin to map how the individual components interact. From that point, it is an engineering and 
organizational exercise in building the infrastructure and configuring the components. This may 
include additional organizational changes depending on how the enterprise is currently set up 
and operating. 
In practice, this is rarely a viable option for federal agencies or any organization with an existing 
network. However, there may be times when an organization is asked to fulfill a new 
responsibility that would require building its own infrastructure. In these cases, it might be 
possible to introduce ZT concepts to some degree. For example, an agency may be given a new 
responsibility that entails building a new application, service, or database. The agency could 
design the newly needed infrastructure around ZT principles and secure system engineering 
[SP8900-160v1], such as evaluating subjects’ trust before granting access and establishing 
micro-perimeters around new resources. The degree of success depends on how dependent this 
new infrastructure is on existing resources (e.g., ID management systems). 
7.2 
Hybrid ZTA and Perimeter-Based Architecture 
It is unlikely that any significant enterprise can migrate to zero trust in a single technology 
refresh cycle. There may be an indefinite period when ZTA workflows coexist with non-ZTA 
workflows in an enterprise. Migration to a ZTA approach to the enterprise may take place one 
business process at a time. The enterprise needs to make sure that the common elements (e.g., ID 
management, device management, event logging) are flexible enough to operate in a ZTA and 
perimeter-based hybrid security architecture. Enterprise architects may also want to restrict ZTA 
candidate solutions to those that can interface with existing components.

Migrating an existing workflow to a ZTA will likely require (at least) a partial redesign. 
Enterprises may take this opportunity to adopt secure system engineering [SP800-160v1] 
practices if they have not already done so for workflows.  
7.3 
Steps to Introducing ZTA to a Perimeter-Based Architected Network 
Migrating to ZTA requires an organization to have detailed knowledge of its assets (physical and 
virtual), subjects (including user privileges), and business processes. This knowledge is accessed 
by the PE when evaluating resource requests. Incomplete knowledge will most often lead to a 
business process failure where the PE denies requests due to insufficient information. This is 
especially an issue if there are unknown “shadow IT” deployments operating within an 
organization. 
Before undertaking an effort to bring ZTA to an enterprise, there should be a survey of assets, 
subjects, data flows, and workflows. This awareness forms the foundational state that must be 
reached before a ZTA deployment is possible. An enterprise cannot determine what new 
processes or systems need to be in place if there is no knowledge of the current state of 
operations. These surveys can be conducted in parallel, but both are tied to examination of the 
business processes of the organization. These steps can be mapped to the steps in the RMF 
[SP800-37] as any adoption of a ZTA is a process to reduce risk to an agency’s business 
functions. The pathway to implementing a ZTA can be visualized in Figure 12.

After the initial inventory is created, there is a regular cycle of maintenance and updating. This 
updating may either change business processes or not have any impact, but an evaluation of 
business processes should be conducted. For example, a change in digital certificate providers 
may not appear to have a significant impact but may involve certificate root store management, 
Certificate Transparency log monitoring, and other factors that are not apparent at first. 
7.3.1 Identify Actors on the Enterprise 
For a zero trust enterprise to operate, the PE must have knowledge of enterprise subjects. 
Subjects could encompass both human and possible NPEs, such as service accounts that interact 
with resources. 
Users with special privileges, such as developers or system administrators, require additional 
scrutiny when being assigned attributes or roles. In many legacy security architectures, these 
accounts may have blanket permission to access all enterprise resources. ZTA should allow 
developers and administrators to have sufficient flexibility to satisfy their business requirements 
while using logs and audit actions to identify access behavior patterns. ZTA deployments may 
require administrators to satisfy a more stringent confidence level or criteria as outlined in NIST 
SP 800-63A, Section 5 [SP800-63A].  
7.3.2 Identify Assets Owned by the Enterprise 
As mentioned in Section 2.1, one of the key requirements of ZTA is the ability to identify and 
manage devices. ZTA also requires the ability to identify and monitor nonenterprise-owned 
devices that may be on enterprise-owned network infrastructure or that access enterprise 
resources. The ability to manage enterprise assets is key to the successful deployment of ZTA. 
This includes hardware components (e.g., laptops, phones, IoT devices) and digital artifacts (e.g., 
user accounts, applications, digital certificates). It may not be possible to conduct a complete 
census on all enterprise-owned assets, so an enterprise should consider building the capability to 
quickly identify, categorize, and assess newly discovered assets that are on enterprise-owned 
infrastructure. 
This goes beyond simply cataloging and maintaining a database of enterprise assets. This also 
includes configuration management and monitoring. The ability to observe the current state of an 
asset is part of the process of evaluating access requests (see Section 2.1). This means that the 
enterprise must be able to configure, survey, and update enterprise assets, such as virtual assets 
and containers. This also includes both its physical (as best estimated) and network location. This 
information should inform the PE when making resource access decisions.  
Nonenterprise-owned assets and enterprise-owned “shadow IT” should also be cataloged as well 
as possible. This may include whatever is visible by the enterprise (e.g., MAC address, network 
location) and augmented by administrator data entry. This information is not only used for access 
decisions (as collaborator and BYOD assets may need to contact PEPs) but also for monitoring 
and forensics logging by the enterprise. Shadow IT presents a special problem in that these 
resources are enterprise-owned but not managed like other resources. Certain ZTA approaches 
(mainly network-based) may even cause shadow IT components to become unusable as they may 
not be known and included in network access policies.
