### VSAM BUFSP Parameter in Access Method Services DEFINE CLUSTER Statement

For each SMF VSAM data set, specify `CISZ(4096)` and `BUFSP(81920)` in the `DEFINE CLUSTER` statement. If an SMF buffer shortage occurs, SMF will reject any trace records sent to it. In such a case, IBM MQ sends a `CSQW133I` message to the z/OS console. Despite this error, IBM MQ remains active, though some SMF data may be lost. Once the buffer shortage is resolved and trace recording resumes, IBM MQ sends a `CSQW123I` message to the z/OS console.

### Reporting Data in SMF

To process SMF records, you can use the SMF program `IFASMFDP` (or `IFASMFDL` if logstreams are being used) to dump SMF records to a sequential data set. There are several ways to report on this data:

- **Write an Application Program:** Develop a custom application to read and report information from the SMF data set, allowing you to tailor the report to your specific needs.
- **Use Performance Reporter:** Process the records using Performance Reporter. For more information, refer to "Using other products with IBM MQ" on page 323.

### No Interval CLASS(03) SMF Accounting Records During Long-Running Processes

If you are collecting `CLASS(3)` SMF116 accounting records for IBM MQ but are not receiving any records during long-running processes, note that these records are typically produced only when a process ends. For long-running processes, such as CICS, this might not generate a sufficient number of records, as the process can run for a month or longer. To gather `CLASS(3)` SMF116 records at set time intervals while a process is running, configure the following settings:

- `SMFACCT=YES`
- `SMFSTAT=YES` or `NO`, where:
  - `YES`: Causes records to be produced if a collection broadcast is received.
  - `NO`: Produces a `CLASS(3)` SMF116 record only when a process ends.

Issue the following command to start the trace:
```
START TRACE(ACCTG) DEST(SMF) CLASS(03)
```

If `SMFSTAT=YES` and a collection broadcast occurs, an interval `CLASS(3)` SMF116 accounting record is produced for any process currently running that was also running at the time of the previous collection broadcast.

Set the collection broadcast to occur on a regular time interval by configuring `STATIME` in `CSQ6SYSP` as follows:
- If `STATIME > 0`, the value is the broadcast interval in minutes.
- If `STATIME = 0`, the system's SMF broadcast interval (`SMF INTVAL`) is used.
- If `STATIME = 0` and `SMF INTVAL` is not set, no broadcast occurs, and no interval records are produced.

### Using Other Products with IBM MQ

You can use other products to enhance the presentation or augment statistics related to performance and accounting. Examples include:
- **Resource Measurement Facility (RMF):** Provides system-wide information about processor utilization, I/O activity, storage, and paging. For more information, see the z/OS Resource Measurement Facility User's Guide.
- **Tivoli Decision Support for z/OS:** Interprets RMF and SMF records, enabling you to manage system performance by collecting data in a Db2 database and presenting it in various formats. For more details, refer to the IBM Tivoli Decision Support for z/OS: Administration Guide and Reference.
- **CICS Monitoring Facility:** Provides performance information about each CICS transaction running. It can be used to investigate resource usage and processing times. For background information, see the CICS Performance Guide and Developing CICS System Programs, along with the CICS Customization Guide.

### Investigating Performance Problems

Performance issues can arise from various factors, including incorrect resource allocation, poor application design, and I/O restraints. Use the following guidelines to investigate potential causes of performance problems:

- **Buffer Pools:** Incorrectly sized buffer pools.
- **Real Storage:** Insufficient real storage.
- **I/O Contention:** Contention for page sets or logs.
- **Log Buffer Thresholds:** Incorrectly set thresholds.
- **Number of Log Buffers:** Incorrect setting.
- **Large Messages:** Handling large messages.
- **Units of Recovery:** Long recovery units with many messages per sync point.
- **Queue Retention:** Messages remaining on a queue for a long time.
- **RACF Auditing:** Excessive RACF auditing.
- **Security Checks:** Unnecessary security checks.
- **Program Design:** Inefficient program design.

When analyzing performance data, always start by examining the overall system before concluding that the issue is specific to IBM MQ. Remember that performance symptoms are magnified under contention. For example, DASD contention can increase transaction response times. The more transactions in the system, the greater the demand for both virtual and real storage.

### Investigating the Overall System

In IBM MQ, performance problems often manifest as increased response times or unexpected heavy use of resources. First, check factors such as total processor usage, DASD activity, and paging. Use tools like RMF to check total processor usage. Examine the system in detail to identify why tasks are progressing slowly or why a specific resource is being heavily used.

Start by looking at general task activity, then focus on particular activities, such as specific tasks or a specific time interval. Limited real storage can also cause tasks to progress more slowly due to paging interrupts.

### Investigating Individual Tasks

Use the accounting trace to gather information about IBM MQ tasks. Trace records provide details about task activity, including time spent suspended waiting for latches and Db2 and coupling facility activity. For more information, see "Interpreting IBM MQ for z/OS accounting data" on page 360.

Long-running units of work can be identified by the presence of message `CSQR026I` in the job log, indicating that a task has existed for more than three queue manager checkpoints and its log records have been shunted. For a description of log record shunting, see "The log files."

### Interpreting IBM MQ for z/OS Performance Statistics

IBM MQ for z/OS performance statistics are written as SMF type 115 records. These records are produced periodically at a time interval specified by the `STATIME` parameter in the `CSQ6SYSP` system parameter module, or at the SMF global recording interval if `STATIME` is set to zero. The information provided in the SMF records comes from various components of IBM MQ, including the buffer manager, coupling facility manager, data manager, Db2 manager, lock manager, log manager, message manager, storage manager, topic manager, and coupling facility SMDS manager.

### Layout of an SMF Type 115 Record

An SMF type 115 record consists of three parts:
- **SMF Header:** Provides format, identification, and time and date information.
- **Self-Defining Section:** Defines the location and size of individual data records within the SMF record.
- **Data Records:** The actual data from IBM MQ that you want to analyze.

For more information about SMF record formats, see z/OS MVS System Management Facilities (SMF).

### Related References

- **The SMF Header:** Refer to Table 34 on page 326 for the format of the SMF header.
- **Self-Defining Sections:** Refer to Table 35 on page 327 for the format of the self-defining sections.
- **Examples of SMF Statistics Records:** See examples of SMF records on page 328.

### Processing Type 115 SMF Records

To extract useful information, you must process any data collected from SMF. Verify that the records are from IBM MQ and that they are the expected records. Validate the values of the following fields:
- `SM115RTY`: Must be X'73' (115).
- `SM115STF`: Must be 0001, 0002, 0005, 0006, 0007, 0201, 0215, or 0231.

Reading from the active SMF data sets (or SMF logstreams) is not supported. Use the SMF program `IFASMFDP` (or `IFASMFDL` if logstreams are being used) to dump SMF records to a sequential data set for processing. For more information, see "Using System Management Facility" on page 321.

There is a C sample program called `CSQ4SMFD` which prints the contents of SMF type 115 and 116 records from the sequential data set. The program is provided as source in `thlqual.SCSQC37S` and in executable format in `thlqual.SCSQLOAD`. Sample JCL is provided in `thlqual.SCSQPROC(CSQ4SMFJ)`.

### Storage Manager Data Records

The format of the storage manager statistics record is described in the assembler macro `thlqual.SCSQMACS(CSQDQSST)`. The data contains information about the number of fixed and variable storage pools allocated, expanded, contracted, and deleted during the statistics interval, plus the number of `GETMAIN`, `FREEMAIN`, and `STORAGE` requests to z/OS, including a count of those requests that were successful.
