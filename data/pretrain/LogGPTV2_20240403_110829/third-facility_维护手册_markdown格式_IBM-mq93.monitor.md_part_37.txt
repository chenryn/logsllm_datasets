on the VSAM BUFSP parameter of the access method services DEFINE CLUSTER statement. Specify
CISZ(4096) and BUFSP(81920) on the DEFINE CLUSTER statement for each SMF VSAM data set.
If an SMF buffer shortage occurs, SMF rejects any trace records sent to it. IBM MQ sends a CSQW133I
message to the z/OS console when this occurs. IBM MQ treats the error as temporary and remains
active even though SMF data can be lost. When the shortage has been alleviated and trace recording has
resumed, IBM MQ sends a CSQW123I message to the z/OS console.
Reporting data in SMF
You can use the SMF program IFASMFDP (or IFASMFDL if logstreams are being used) to dump SMF
records to a sequential data set so that they can be processed.
There are several ways to report on this data, for example:
• Write an application program to read and report information from the SMF data set. You can then tailor
the report to fit your exact needs.
• Use Performance Reporter to process the records. For more information, see “Using other products with
IBM MQ” on page 323.
No interval CLASS(03) SMF accounting records produced during long running
processes
You are collecting CLASS(3) SMF116 accounting records for IBM MQ, but are getting no records produced
while a long running process runs.
The CLASS(3) SMF116 accounting records normally are produced only when a process ends. For long
running processes, for example CICS, this might not produce a sufficient number of records, as the
process can run for a month or longer. However, you might want to gather SMF116 records at set time
intervals while a process is running.
To gather CLASS(3) SMF116 accounting records you must set the following:
SMFACCT
=YES
SMFSTAT
=YES or NO, where
YES
Causes records to be produced if a collection broadcast is received.
No
Causes you to get a CLASS(3) SMF116 record produced only when a process ends
and issue the following command:
START TRACE(ACCTG) DEST(SMF) CLASS(03)
322 Monitoring and Performance for IBM MQ
If you have set SMFSTAT=YES and a collection broadcast occurs, an interval CLASS(3) SMF116 accounting
record is produced for any process currently running that was also running at the time of the previous
collection broadcast.
You can set the collection broadcast to occur on a regular time interval by setting STATIME in CSQ6SYSP
as follows:
• If your STATIME has been set to a value greater than 0, that is your broadcast interval in minutes.
• If your STATIME = 0 the SMF broadcast of your system is used (SMF INTVAL)
• If your STATIME = 0 and your SMF INTVAL is not set, no broadcast occurs and no interval records are
produced
Using other products with IBM MQ
You can use other products to help you to improve the presentation of, or to augment statistics related to,
performance and accounting. For example, Resource Measurement Facility, Tivoli Decision Support, and
CICS monitoring.
Using the Resource Measurement Facility
Resource Measurement Facility ( RMF ) is an IBM licensed program (program number 5685-029) that
provides system-wide information about processor utilization, I/O activity, storage, and paging. You can
use RMF to monitor the utilization of physical resources across the whole system dynamically. For more
information, see the z/OS Resource Measurement Facility User's Guide.
Using Tivoli Decision Support for z/OS
You can use Tivoli Decision Support for z/OS to interpret RMF and SMF records.
Tivoli Decision Support for z/OS is an IBM licensed program (program number 5698-B06) that enables
you to manage the performance of your system by collecting performance data in a Db2® database and
presenting the data in various formats for use in systems management. Tivoli Decision Support for can
generate graphic and tabular reports using systems management data it stores in its Db2 database. It
includes an administration dialog, a reporting dialog, and a log collector, all of which interact with a
standard Db2 database.
This is described in the IBM Tivoli Decision Support for z/OS: Administration Guide and Reference.
Using the CICS monitoring facility
The CICS monitoring facility provides performance information about each CICS transaction running.
It can be used to investigate the resources used and the time spent processing transactions. For
background information, see the CICS Performance Guide and Developing CICS System Programs,
together with the two companion reference manuals, formerly called the CICS Customization Guide.
Investigating performance problems
Performance problems can arise from various factors. For example, incorrect resource allocation, poor
application design, and I/O restraints. Use this topic to investigate some of the possible causes of
performance problems.
Performance can be adversely affected by:
• Buffer pools that are an incorrect size
• Lack of real storage
• I/O contention for page sets or logs
• Log buffer thresholds that are set incorrectly
• Incorrect setting of the number of log buffers
IBM MQ Monitoring and performance 323
• Large messages
• Units of recovery that last a long time, incorporating many messages for each sync point
• Messages that remain on a queue for a long time
• RACF® auditing
• Unnecessary security checks
• Inefficient program design
When you analyze performance data, always start by looking at the overall system before you decide that
you have a specific IBM MQ problem. Remember that almost all symptoms of reduced performance are
magnified when there is contention. For example, if there is contention for DASD, transaction response
times can increase. Also, the more transactions there are in the system, the greater the processor usage
and greater the demand for both virtual and real storage.
In such situations, the system shows heavy use of all its resources. However, the system is actually
experiencing normal system stress, and this stress might be hiding the cause of a performance reduction.
To find the cause of such a loss of performance, you must consider all items that might be affecting your
active tasks.
Investigating the overall system
Within IBM MQ, the performance problem is either increased response time or an unexpected and
unexplained heavy use of resources. First check factors such as total processor usage, DASD activity,
and paging. An IBM tool for checking total processor usage is resource management facility ( RMF ). In
general, you must look at the system in some detail to see why tasks are progressing slowly, or why a
specific resource is being heavily used.
Start by looking at general task activity, then focus on particular activities, such as specific tasks or a
specific time interval.
Another possibility is that the system has limited real storage; therefore, because of paging interrupts, the
tasks progress more slowly than expected.
Investigating individual tasks
You can use the accounting trace to gather information about IBM MQ tasks. These trace records tell you
a great deal about the activity that the task has performed, and about how much time the task spent
suspended, waiting for latches. The trace record also includes information about how much Db2 and
coupling facility activity were performed by the task.
Interpreting IBM MQ accounting data is described in “Interpreting IBM MQ for z/OS accounting data” on
page 360.
Long running units of work can be identified by the presence of message CSQR026I in the job log. This
message indicates that a task has existed for more than three queue manager checkpoints and its log
records have been shunted. For a description of log record shunting, see The log files.
Interpreting IBM MQ for z/OS performance statistics
Use this topic as an index to the different SMF records created by IBM MQ for z/OS.
IBM MQ for z/OS performance statistics are written as SMF type 115 records. Statistics records are
produced periodically at a time interval specified by the STATIME parameter of the CSQ6SYSP system
parameter module, or at the SMF global recording interval if you specify zero for STATIME. The
information provided in the SMF records comes from the following components of IBM MQ:
Buffer manager Manages the buffer pools in virtual storage and the writing of pages to page sets
as the buffer pools become full. Also manages the reading of pages from page
sets.
324 Monitoring and Performance for IBM MQ
Coupling facility Manages the interface with the coupling facility.
manager
Data manager Manages the links between messages and queues. It calls the buffer manager to
process the pages with messages on them.
Db2 manager Manages the interface with the Db2 database that is used as the shared
repository.
Lock manager Manages locks
Log manager Manages the writing of log records, which are essential for maintaining the
integrity of the system if there is a back out request, or for recovery, if there
is a system or media failure.
Message manager Processes all IBM MQ API requests.
Storage manager Manages storage, for example, storage pool allocation, expansion, and
deallocation.
Topic manager Manages the topic and subscription information
Coupling facility Manages the shared message data sets (SMDS) for large messages stored in the
SMDS manager coupling facility.
IBM MQ statistics are written to SMF as SMF type 115 records. The following subtypes can be present:
1
System information, for example, related to the logs and storage.
2
Information about number of messages and paging information. Queue sharing group information
related to the coupling facility and Db2.
5 and 6
Detailed information about internal storage usage in the queue manager address space. While you can
view this information, some of it is intended only for IBM use.
7
Storage manager summary information. While you can view this information, some of it is intended
only for IBM use.
201
Page set input/output information
215
Buffer pool information
216
Queue information
231
System information for the channel initiator address space.
Note that:
• Subtype 1, 2, 201, and 215 records are created with statistics trace class 1.
• Subtype 5, 6, and 7 records are created with statistics trace class 3.
• Subtype 231 records are created with statistics trace class 4.
• Subtype 216 records are created with statistics trace class 5.
The subtype is specified in the SM115STF field (shown in Table 34 on page 326 ).

Self-defining sections
Use this topic as a reference for format of the self-defining sections of the SMF record.
A self-defining section of a type 115 SMF record tells you where to find a statistics record, how long it
is, and how many times that type of record is repeated (with different values). The self-defining sections
follow the header, at fixed offsets from the start of the SMF record. Each statistics record can be identified
by an eye-catcher string.
The following types of self-defining section are available to users for type 115 records. Each self-defining
section points to statistics data related to one of the IBM MQ components. Table 35 on page 327
summarizes the sources of the statistics, the eye-catcher strings, and the offsets of the self-defining
sections from the start of the SMF record header.

Figure 20. SMF record 115, subtype 1
328 Monitoring and Performance for IBM MQ
Figure 21 on page 329 shows an example of part of the SMF record for subtype 2. Subtype 2 includes the
statistics records for the message, data, lock, coupling facility, topic, and Db2 managers. The SMF record
header is shown underlined; the self-defining sections are shown alternately bold and italic.
• The self-defining section at offset X'24' refers to message manager statistics. The message manager
statistics record is located at offset X'00000064' from the start of the header and is X'48' bytes long.
There is one set of these statistics, identified by the eye-catcher string QMST.
• The self-defining section at offset X'2C' refers to data manager statistics. The data manager statistics
record is located at offset X'000000AC' from the start of the header and is X'50' bytes long. There is one
set of these statistics, identified by the eye-catcher string QIST.
• In earlier releases, the self-defining section at offset X'34' referred to buffer manager statistics. As this
SMF record was taken from an IBM MQ 9.1.0 queue manager, the buffer manager self-defining section
is set to zeros to indicate that there are no buffer manager statistics. Instead, these statistics are in SMF
115 subtype 215 records.
• The self-defining section at offset X'3C' refers to lock manager statistics. The lock manager statistics
record is located at offset X'000000FC' from the start of the header and is X'20' bytes long. There is one
set of these statistics, identified by the eye-catcher string QLST.
• The self-defining section at offset X'44' refers to Db2 manager statistics. The Db2 manager statistics
record is located at offset X'0000011C' from the start of the header and is X'2A0' bytes long. There is
one set of these statistics, identified by the eye-catcher string Q5ST.
• The self-defining section at offset X'4C' refers to coupling facility manager statistics. The coupling
facility manager statistics record is located at offset X'000003BC' from the start of the header and is
X'1008' bytes long. There is one set of these statistics, identified by the eye-catcher string QEST.
• The self-defining section at offset X'54' refers to topic manager statistics. The topic manager statistics
record is located at offset X'000013C4' from the start of the header and is X'64' bytes long. There is one
set of these statistics, identified by the eye-catcher string QTST.
• The self-defining section at offset X'5C' is for SMDS statistics. This self defining section is set to zeros
indicating that SMDS is not being used.

Figure 21. SMF record 115, subtype 2
Processing type 115 SMF records
Use this topic as a reference for processing type 115 SMF records.
You must process any data you collect from SMF to extract useful information. When you process the
data, verify that the records are from IBM MQ and that they are the records you are expecting.
Validate the values of the following fields:
IBM MQ Monitoring and performance 329
• SM115RTY, the SMF record number, must be X'73' (115)
• SM115STF, the record subtype, must be 0001, 0002, 0005, 0006, 0007, 0201, 0215, or 0231
Reading from the active SMF data sets (or SMF logstreams) is not supported. You must use the SMF
program IFASMFDP (or IFASMFDL if logstreams are being used) to dump SMF records to a sequential data
set so that they can be processed. For more information see “Using System Management Facility” on page
321.
There is a C sample program called CSQ4SMFD which prints the contents of SMF type 115 and 116
records from the sequential data set. The program is provided as source in thlqual.SCSQC37S and in
executable format in thlqual.SCSQLOAD. Sample JCL is provided in thlqual.SCSQPROC(CSQ4SMFJ).
Storage manager data records
Use this topic as a reference for storage manager data records.
The format of the storage manager statistics record is described in assembler macro
thlqual.SCSQMACS(CSQDQSST).
The data contains information about the number of fixed and variable storage pools that the queue
manager has allocated, expanded, contracted, and deleted during the statistics interval, plus the number
of GETMAIN, FREEMAIN, and STORAGE requests to z/OS, including a count of those requests that
