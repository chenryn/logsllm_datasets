Question: In the process of software development, maintaining multiple functions with identical code can have several impacts on security maintenance. Which of the following best explains why this practice may negatively affect the security of a software product?
"A": "Redundant code can make the codebase easier to read, thereby increasing the chances of detecting and fixing vulnerabilities.",
"B": "Having multiple copies of the same code can lead to inconsistencies if a vulnerability is fixed in one location but not in others.",
"C": "Duplicate code blocks can improve performance by distributing the computational load, indirectly enhancing security by reducing processing time.",
"D": "Identical functions across the codebase ensure uniform behavior, which simplifies security testing and reduces the likelihood of vulnerabilities."
Answer: B
