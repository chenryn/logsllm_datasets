User: Are there any real differences between them?
I want to program in java and python. And of corse be a normal user: internet, etc
Which one will give me less headaches/more satisfaction ? 
And which is better for a server machine ?
Thank you
Assistant: Neither is better. They both support the same tools and libraries. They are both linux. Anything and everything you can do on one you can do on the other.
