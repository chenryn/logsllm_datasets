several times that, with a single burst above 500 events per
second being reported in the 10-day period.
Recall that the purpose of the hybrid system was to
identify new threats and receive detailed analysis of those
threats. As such, care must be taken to separate the cause
of a speciﬁc event on the honeypots from its effect (for
example, If a honeypot is processing several simultaneous
connections, how can do we know which one successfully
caused the infection?) In the worst case, we may need to
separate every event and send it to a separate virtual host
for processing.
In this case, we now become bound not
simply by the event per second rate but also by the dura-
tion of the event. To evaluate the cost of event duration, we
examined the lengths of connections to an individual hon-
eypot host, as shown in Figure 8. While roughly 77% of the
connections were of zero length (a connection request and

with an average connection length of 400 seconds. In com-
bination, these results indicate that a honeyfarm for a sin-
gle /17 darknet block would need to handle from 40,000 to
200,000 simultaneous connections.
In the previous sections we explored the attack char-
acteristics, as observed by individual darknets including
the number of unique source addresses and destination
ports. We examined the distribution of packets among these
source IP addresses and destination ports and found that a
supprisingly small number of source IP addresses and an
even smaller number of destination ports dominated each
darknet. We showed that these distributions make source-
based ﬁltering methods avery ppealing in reducing the traf-
ﬁc at individual blocks, but that there was a great deal of
variance in the effectiveness of these methods over time.
Nevertheless, we believe that these methods can be very
helpful in reducing the number of packets at an individual
darknet to a much smaller handful of connections.
5 Hybrid Scalability in Distributed Dark
Address Blocks
For a hybrid system to be effective, our goals of detecting
new threats and providing detailed analysis of these threats
must be performed quickly when a new threat emerges.
While we showed in the previous section that source-based
ﬁlters could produce obtainable numbers of connections for
handoff, the size of these darknets (e.g., /17) may be to
small to provide quick detection of scanning worms. To
achieve even further detection time reductions, a darknet
monitoring system can choose to monitor a larger dark-
net, or combine multiple, distributed darknets. In practice,
however, there is a limit on the size of a darknet (e.g., /8)
and few of these large darknets exist. Moving beyond that
size when such a large darknet is not available requires ad-
ditional darknets to be aggregated together. This distributed
darknet monitoring approach also has several additional
beneﬁts, including added resilience to ﬁngerprinting, and
insight into difference between darknets. In this section, we
examine the properties of source IP addresses and destina-
tion ports across darknets to determine the effects of these
properties on a hybrid system consisting of a distributed
collection of darknet monitors.
5.1 Characterizing Distributed Darknets
We begin by looking at the number of source IP addresses
at each of the 41 darknets during a 21-day period, from
March 19th through April 9th, 2005. In Figure 9, we exam-
ine the cumulative unique source IP addresses seen per day.
We see that blocks receive trafﬁc from a few hundred (the
/25 darknet) to a few million (the /8 darknet) unique source
IP addresses per day. There is some overlap with previous
Figure 9: The number of cumulative unique sources per
day, as viewed by 41 darknets from March 28th, 2005 to
April 19th, 2005. Each line is a single darknet varying in
size from a /25 to a /8
days, however, the forward difference still involves hun-
dreds of thousands of hosts every day for the /8 darknet.
This order of magnitude difference in the number of source
IP addresses between the /8 and the /17 monitor discussed
in the previous section adds a considerably larger number
of events to evaluate for the larger darknet.
In order to see how the addition of darknets (each with
their own number of unique source IP addresses over time)
affects the aggregate number of sources in the hybrid mon-
itor, we computed the overlap in unique source addresses
between all darknets. Table 1 shows the average percent-
age of daily source IP address overlap (and standard devi-
ation) in several of the medium to large darknets from the
IMS system over a period of a month. A signiﬁcant num-
ber of the source IP addresses seen at these darknets are
not globally visible. The largest of the monitored darknets,
the /8 darknet, consists mainly of source IP addresses not
seen at any of the other darknets, as seen in the D/8 row.
However, a much larger fraction of the source IP addresses
at the other darknets do appear in the /8 darknet, as seen in
the D/8 column. While this implies that many of the source
IP address seen at a local darknet are captured by the /8, a
signiﬁcant faction of them are not; from 88% at one of the
/22 darknets to 12% at one of the /18 darknets. In addition,
the majority of the source IP addresses seen at the /8 are not
seen anywhere else. This does not bode well for the scaling
of a hybrid system, as the addition of each new darknet will
be add a signiﬁcant number of new source IP addresses and
hence new connections to be evaluated.
Next we considered the space of the destination ports.
For 31 darknets, we examined the top 10 destination ports,
based on the number of packets, and compared these lists
across darknets. Figure 10 shows the number of darknets
that had a particular destination port in their top 10 list.
