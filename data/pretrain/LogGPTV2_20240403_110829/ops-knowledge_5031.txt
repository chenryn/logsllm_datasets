User: So, within a webapp.RequestHandler subclass I would use self.request.uri to get the request URI. But, I can't access this outside of a RequestHandler and so no go. Any ideas?
I'm running Python and I'm new at it as well as GAE.
Assistant: You should generally be doing everything within some sort of RequestHandler or the equivalent in your non-WebApp framework.  However, if you really insist on being stuck in the early 1990s and writing plain CGI scripts, the environment variables SERVER_NAME and PATH_INFO may be what you want; see a CGI reference for more info.
