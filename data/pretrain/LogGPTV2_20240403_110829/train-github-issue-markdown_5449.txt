In version 0.14, `pandas` updated the `.iloc` method to accept out-of-bounds indexers for slices. For the sake of consistency and efficiency, I propose that we implement a similar change for the `.loc` method.

It's worth noting that there is already an inconsistency in the current behavior when using integer and float indexes. Specifically:

- When using an integer index, attempting to slice with an out-of-bounds indexer results in a `KeyError`:
  ```python
  >>> pd.Series(range(5), index=np.arange(5)).loc[-1:]
  KeyError: -1
  ```

- However, when using a float index, the same operation returns the entire series:
  ```python
  >>> pd.Series(range(5), index=np.arange(5.0)).loc[-1:]
  0    0
  1    1
  2    2
  3    3
  4    4
  dtype: int64
  ```

This discrepancy should be addressed to ensure consistent and predictable behavior across different types of indexes.
