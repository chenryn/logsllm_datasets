pandas 0.14 changed `.iloc` to accept out-of-bounds indexers for slices. I
think we should do the same for `.loc`, for similar reasons of consistency and
efficiency.
Note that this is already currently inconsistent for int and float indexes
(not entirely sure why):
    >>> pd.Series(range(5), np.arange(5)).loc[-1:]
    KeyError
    >>> pd.Series(range(5), np.arange(5.0)).loc[-1:]
    0    0
    1    1
    2    2
    3    3
    4    4
    dtype: int64
