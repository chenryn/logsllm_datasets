Generally speaking, you can choose the following types of SSL certificates: - Domain name verification type SSL certificate: suitable for personal blogs, forums, small e-commerce and other websites. - Organization-authenticated SSL certificate: Applicable to enterprise-level websites, which need to provide the company's real qualification information for authentication. - Extended validation SSL certificate: suitable for large-scale e-commerce, banks and other websites that require high trust. According to the certificate type you choose, purchase an SSL certificate and complete the certificate installation. 4. Configure the web server to support HTTPS access. Perform the following steps on the web server: - Upload the certificate file and private key file to the server. - Configure the domain name, port, certificate path, and private key path in the web server configuration file. - Port forwarding: Since https is redirected to port 443 by default, port forwarding is required to forward the HTTPS request on port 8443 to port 443. - Configure HTTPS redirection: When there is an http request, it needs to be redirected to https, just set a 301 or 302 redirection rule. After completing the above steps, you can access it through the HTTPS protocol. The successful installation of the certificate can be verified using online tools such as Qualys SSL Labs. Note: Some error messages may still appear after the configuration is complete, and the specific errors need to be handled according to the actual situation.
