User: This has been driving me crazy for the past 2 days.
I installed virtualenv on my Macbook using pip install virtualenv.
But when I try to create a new virtualenv using virtualenv venv, I get the error saying "virtualenv : command not found".
I used pip show virtualenv and the location of the installation is "Location: /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages" but I can't figure out where the executable is. I tried dozens other similar looking posts but those solutions do not work for me.
Any ideas what might be going wrong here?
Assistant: I tried to have virtualenv at a random location & faced the same issue on a UBUNTU machine, when I tried to run my 'venv'. What solved my issue was :-
$virtualenv -p python3 venv
Also,instead of using $activate try :-
$source activate
If you look at the activate script(or $cat activate), you will find the same in comment.
