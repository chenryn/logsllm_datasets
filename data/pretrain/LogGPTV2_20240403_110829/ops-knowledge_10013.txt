I have been struggling with this issue for the past two days. I installed `virtualenv` on my MacBook using `pip install virtualenv`. However, when I attempt to create a new virtual environment with `virtualenv venv`, I receive an error message: "virtualenv: command not found."

Upon running `pip show virtualenv`, I discovered that the installation is located at `/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages`. Despite this, I am unable to locate the executable. I have tried numerous solutions from similar posts, but none of them have worked for me.

Do you have any suggestions on what might be causing this problem?

**Response:**

I encountered a similar issue when I installed `virtualenv` in a non-standard location on an Ubuntu machine. What resolved the problem for me was specifying the Python interpreter explicitly:

```sh
virtualenv -p python3 venv
```

Additionally, instead of using `$activate`, try:

```sh
source venv/bin/activate
```

If you inspect the `activate` script (e.g., by running `cat venv/bin/activate`), you will see that it contains instructions for activation, which may provide further insight.
