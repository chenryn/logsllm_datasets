### Traffic Profile of fpDNS Dataset (12/01/2011 to 12/06/2011)

**Figure 2: Traffic Profile of fpDNS Dataset, from 12/01/2011 to 12/06/2011.**

- **Traffic Above Recursive DNS Servers:**
  - Y-axis: Traffic Volume (in millions)
  - X-axis: Dates (December 1, 2011, to December 6, 2011)
  - Categories: All, NXDOMAIN, Akamai, Google

- **Traffic Below Recursive DNS Servers:**
  - Y-axis: Traffic Volume (in millions)
  - X-axis: Dates (December 1, 2011, to December 6, 2011)
  - Categories: All, NXDOMAIN, Akamai, Google

### Long Tail Analysis

### Popular 2LD Zones

The analysis includes two popular second-level domains (2LDs), Google and Akamai, alongside the overall traffic numbers:
- **Google:** Reflects user-driven behavior such as email checks and web searches.
- **Akamai:** Represents DNS activity for the largest content delivery network.

These two zones collectively account for less than half of the total DNS traffic, indicating that other zones contribute a significant portion of the traffic in the fpDNS dataset.

### Unsuccessful DNS Resolutions (NXDOMAIN)

- **Above RDNS Servers:** Constitutes almost 40% of the traffic.
- **Below RDNS Servers:** Only 6% of the traffic.
- This discrepancy suggests that resolvers in the monitored networks were not honoring the negative cache, contrary to RFC2308 [23].

### Long Tail of Lookup Volume

- **Definition:** Domain names receiving fewer than 10 lookups per day.
- **Observation:** More than 90% of all resource records (RRs) have lookup volumes lower than 10 on 02/01/2011.
- **Increase:** The long tail of lookup volume increased from 90% to 94% in 2011.

### DNS Cache Hit Rates

**Figure 4: Cache Hit Rate Distribution from fpDNS.**

- **Cache Hit Rate (CHR) Definition:**
  - CHR(object) = Number of Cache Hits in a Day / Number of Total Queries in a Day
  - Each cache hit corresponds to an answer issued from the RDNSs observed below the recursive DNS servers without triggering a cache miss.
  - Each cache miss corresponds to an answer issued to the RDNSs observed above the recursive DNS servers.
  - The number of all queries is the sum of the answers seen below the recursive DNS servers.

- **Domain Hit Rate (DHR) Distribution:**
  - 89% of all RRs have a domain hit rate of 0%.
  - The percentage of RRs with zero domain hit rate increased from 89% to 93% in 2011.

### DNS Deduplication

**Figure 5: Deduplicated New Resource Records Per Day in the rpDNS Dataset (11/28/2011 to 12/10/2011).**

- **Dataset Construction:**
  - Reduced passive DNS dataset from 13 days of traffic.
  - Total unique resource records: 413,753,934.

- **Observations:**
  - Daily new RRs decreased by 13,614,102 (30%) on the 13th day.
  - Akamai RRs decreased by 128,957 (69%) on the 13th day.
  - Google increased its daily new RRs by 4,264,585 (25%) on the 13th day.
  - Google operates 58% of all RRs in the overall rpDNS dataset.
  - Google's percentage of unique RRs increased from 37% on the first day to 66% on the 13th day.

### Defining Disposable Domains

**Disposable Domain Names:**
- **Properties:**
  1. Automatically generated name strings.
  2. Low or close to zero median value in cache hit rate distribution.
- **Caching Properties:**
  - Automatically generated domains are marked as disposable if their cache hit rates are very low.
  - RRs under the same zone share similarly low cache hit rates.

**Real-World Examples:**
- **Zone Structure:**
  - Facilitates resolutions of disposable domain names.
  - Example: Google's use of a large number of disposable domains for DNS measurement experiments.

### Conclusion

This analysis provides insights into the traffic profile, long-tail behavior, and caching properties of DNS datasets. The definition of disposable domains helps in understanding the behavior of automatically generated domain names and their impact on DNS traffic.
