User: Is there a way that I can use Python on Windows to execute shell scripts which are located on a remote Unix machine?
P.S: Sorry about the late edit. I do know of Paramiko, but I wanted to know if there is way of doing it without it. For starters, could it be done with subprocess()?
Assistant: If you don't want to use paramiko, then try telnetlib. You can use it to execute remote commands.
