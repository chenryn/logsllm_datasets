Assistant: This log chunk shows the storage.BlockManager finding three blocks (rdd_42_12, rdd_42_14, and rdd_42_13) locally, and the python.PythonRunner and executor.Executor components running tasks and sending results to the driver. The executor.CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend is also assigned tasks 1335, 1336, 1337, and 1338.
