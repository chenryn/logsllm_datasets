Hi all
For some reason Launcher duplicates items on the list. It shows the
application in the search list but also it duplicates that same application by
showing .lnk file from the menu start folder for the same app. Please see the
screenshot below:

Do you think it is a bug. Perhaps we could exlude .lnk file in future updates
as an option?
