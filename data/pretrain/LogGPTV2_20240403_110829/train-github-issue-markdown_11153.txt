Subject: Duplicate Application Entries in Launcher

Hello Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I have encountered an issue with the Launcher where it duplicates items on the list. Specifically, when searching for an application, the Launcher displays both the application itself and its corresponding `.lnk` file from the Start Menu folder, resulting in duplicate entries.

Please refer to the attached screenshot for a visual reference:

Could you please confirm if this is a known bug? Additionally, I suggest considering the option to exclude `.lnk` files in future updates to prevent these duplicates.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
