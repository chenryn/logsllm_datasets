User: Use Python to write a script to scan the Linux server, find software packages that are not updated in time, and send an email to the administrator.
Assistant: The following is a Python script to achieve this function: ```python #!/usr/bin/env python import subprocess import smtplib from email.mime.text import MIMEText # Get the packages that are not updated in time in the current system outdated_packages = subprocess. check_output("sudo apt-get upgrade --just-print | grep 'Inst' | awk '{print $2}'", shell=True).decode().split('\n')[:-1] if not outdated_packages: print("All packages are up-to-date") else: # Generate email body content body = "The following packages need updates:\n\n" for package in outdated_packages: body += f"{package} \n" # send mail to admin sender = "admin@example.com" recipient = "admin@example.com" msg = MIMEText(body) msg['Subject'] = 'Packages Update Reminder' msg['From' ] = sender msg['To'] = recipient s = smtplib.SMTP('localhost') s.sendmail(sender, [recipient], msg.as_string()) s.quit() ``` This script uses `subprocess The `module runs the `sudo apt-get upgrade --just-print` command to obtain a list of packages that are not updated in time in the current system. This list is then sent to the administrator using the `smptlib` module. It should be noted that this script needs to be run as the root user to get all the package information in the system.
