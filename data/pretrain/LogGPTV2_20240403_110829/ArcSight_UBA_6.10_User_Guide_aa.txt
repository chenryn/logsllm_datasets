Introduction
IntroductionArcSight UBA 6.10 is a big data security analytics platform built on Hadoop that utilizes Securonix machine learning-based anomaly detection techniques and threat models to detect sophisticated cyber and insider attacks. ArcSight UBA 6.10 uses Hadoop both as its distributed security analytics engine and long-term data retention engine. Hadoop nodes can be added as needed, allowing the solution to scale horizontally to support hundreds of thousands of events per second (EPS).Features:
l Supports a rich variety of security data including security event logs, user identity data, access 	privileges, threat intelligence, asset metadata, and netflow data.
l Normalizes, indexes, and correlates security event logs, network flows, and application trans-	actions.
l Utilizes machine learning-based anomaly detection techniques, including behavior profiling, 	peer group analytics, pattern analysis, and event rarity to detect advanced threats.l Provides out-of-the-box threat and risk models for detection and prioritization of insider threat, 	cyber threat, and fraud.
l Risk-ranks entities involved in threats to enable an entity-centric (user or devices) approach to 	mitigating threats.
l Provides Spotter, a blazing-fast search feature with normalized search syntax that enables invest-igators to investigate today’s threats and track advanced persistent threats over long periods of time, with all data available at all times.l Provides the Investigation Workbench to detect links across disparate data sets to enable quick 	investigations and hunting for cyber threats.
