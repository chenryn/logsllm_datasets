I understand you're experiencing issues with your Twisted installation on a MacBook Pro running OS X 10.6.6 (Snow Leopard). Your system comes with Python 2.6, but you have also installed Python 2.7.1. You are unable to import Twisted modules, which are located in the `2.6/Extras/lib/python/twisted` directory, when using Python 2.7.1.

From your description, it seems that your default Python version is 2.7.1, as confirmed by the following:

- Running `which python` returns: `/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python`
- Running `python` returns: `Python 2.7.1 (r271:86882M, Nov 30 2010, 10:35:34)`

You have attempted to add the Twisted directory to `sys.path` and modified your `.bash_profile` as follows:
```sh
PATH="/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin:${PATH}"
PATH=$PATH:/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/Extras/lib/python/twisted
export PATH
```

### Recommendations

1. **Install Twisted for Python 2.7.1**:
   - The best approach is to install Twisted specifically for Python 2.7.1. You can do this using `pip` or `easy_install`:
     ```sh
     /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/pip install twisted
     ```
   - If you don't have `pip`, you can install it first:
     ```sh
     /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/easy_install pip
     ```

2. **Set the `PYTHONPATH`**:
   - Python uses the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to find modules, not the `PATH` variable. To include the Twisted directory, you should modify the `PYTHONPATH` instead of `PATH`:
     ```sh
     export PYTHONPATH=/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/Extras/lib/python:$PYTHONPATH
     ```
   - Add this line to your `.bash_profile` to make it persistent.

3. **Verify the Installation**:
   - After installing Twisted for Python 2.7.1, verify that you can import the Twisted modules:
     ```sh
     /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python -c "import twisted; print(twisted.__version__)"
     ```

By following these steps, you should be able to use the Twisted library with Python 2.7.1. If you continue to experience issues, please provide any error messages for further assistance.
