ABSTRACT
We  propose  a  general  desgn  for  secure  collaboraton  systems, 
whch  s  underpnned  wth  an  access  control  polcy  model,  an 
admnstratve scheme, and an enforcement scheme, based on the 
Typed Usage Control (TUCON) model. TUCON s a generalzed 
form of the usage control model (UCON) proposed recently. By 
utlzng mutable object attrbutes, UCON can reflect the dynamc 
nature  of  ad-hoc  collaboratons  such  as  temporal  and/or  spatal 
usages. In TUCON, every object has an object type as a persstent 
attrbute,  whch  works  as  a  name  space  that  ndcates  an 
organzaton  to  whch  the  object  belongs.  Wth  object  types, 
TUCON  polces  can  dstnctly  control  ntra-organzaton  and 
nter-organzaton nformaton flows. Ths approach acheves the 
autonomy  of  collaboratve 
the  mutual 
confdentalty of collaboratng organzatons.

In order to ncrease the productvty and effcency of ntellectual 
actvtes  such  as  scentfc  or  engneerng  research, 
the 
mportance of collaboratve work among concerned organzatons 
s  well  understood.  To  date,  dstrbuted  computng  technologes 
such as vrtual prvate networkng, peer-to-peer fle sharng, Web 
servces, and Grd, are expected to encourage nter-organzatonal 
collaboraton n academc and commercal sectors. 
For secure collaboraton, a prmary concern s how to balance the 
competng goals of autonomy and confidentiality wth respect to 
ntra-  and 
flows.  Several 
approaches have been proposed n lteratures. However, t s stll a 
research 
the  dynamc  nature  of  ad-hoc 
collaboratons such as temporal and/or spatal usages. 
We  propose  a  general  desgn  for  secure  ad-hoc  collaboratons,

two  organzatons, 
whch  allows  the  dynamc  changes  of  object  attrbutes  such  as 
user  locatons  as  well  as  the  autonomy  and  confdentalty  of 
collaboratve work, n a model-based approach as follows. 
Frst,  we  show  an  access  control  polcy  scheme  for  nter-
organzatonal  collaboraton,  based  on  the  Typed  Usage  Control
(TUCON).  TUCON  s  a  generalzed  form  of  the  usage  control 
model  (UCON),  whch  can  capture  the  dynamc  features  of 
collaboratve work wth attrbutes that represent transent states of 
an object such as task progress. TUCON ntroduces an object type
as a persstent attrbute that s assgned to an object n ts creaton 
tme. A typed par of a subject and an object dstngushes nternal 
actvtes 
n  a  sngle  organzaton  from  external  actvtes 
spannng dfferent organzatons. Wth a unque type assgned to a 
collaboratve  team  (.e.,  a  vrtual  organzaton),  our  TUCON-
based polcy scheme allows fne-graned nformaton flow control 
beyond  organzatonal  boundares,  and 
the  autonomy  of 
ndvdual collaboratve teams. 
Second,  we  propose  a  joint  administrative  model  (JAS),  whch 
enables collaboratng organzatons to admnstrate ther TUCON 
polces as an agreement wth confdentalty requrements (e.g., a 
non-dsclosure  agreement).  Snce  a  TUCON  polcy  nvolves 
exactly 
t  can  prevent  a  collaboratng 
organzaton  from  leakng  senstve  data  wthout  the  opponent's 
agreement. Furthermore, by allowng collaboratng organzatons 
to  update  ther  agreement,  our  scheme  can  flexbly  support 
dverse relatonshps of collaboratng organzatons. 
For  TUCON  polcy  enforcement,  we  develop  an  enforcement 
scheme  wth  attribute  monitors  n  a  dstrbuted  envronment.  In 
order to solve the problem that a platform n a dstrbuted system 
may host several enttes of dfferent organzatons as a result of 
user actvtes n collaboratve work, we deploy attrbute montors 
on  dstrbuted  platforms,  whch  recognze  user  actvtes  over 
remote  platforms  from  process  executon  sequences,  and 
approprately update object attrbutes. Workng wth the attrbute 
montors, the polcy enforcement pont (PEP) on a platform can 
correctly  enforce  a  TUCON  polcy  throughout  a  dstrbuted 
system. 
Fnally,  we  present  a  dstrbuted  archtecture  for  secure 
collaboraton, whch conssts of polcy admnstraton pont (PAP), 
user  platforms,  and  attrbute  repostores.  PAP  allows  the 
representatves (or admnstrators) of  collaboratng  organzatons 
to  make  an  agreement  on  a  TUCON  polcy  based  on  the  JAS. 
User platforms perform collaboratve servces under the attrbute-
based  enforcement  scheme  wth  attrbute  montors.  An  attrbute 
repostory  securely  forwards  object  attrbutes  over  collaboratng 
organzatons. We have mplemented a prototype system based on 
ths archtecture and have been studyng the effectveness of our 
proposed  scheme  and  the  performance  wth  some  example 
applcatons. We are further  optmzng  the  mplementaton,  and 
applyng t to practcal nformaton sharng solutons.
