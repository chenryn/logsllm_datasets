User: How can I make a Python script to be a specific file type's (e.g., *.foo) default application? As in, when I double click the file in the Finder / Explorer I want the file to open in the Python script.
Is this possible to do in Win and/or OS X? The application is a PySide app if that matters.
Assistant: Find any file of type foo 
right-click -> Get Info or Click on the file icon,then click Get info or click on the file and hit Command+I
In the Open With pane that shows up, select the path to the python binary
Once selected, You can click the change All button
It'll ask for confirmation, just say continue
