User: so I have a bash script in which I use the environment variables from Jenkins 
for example:
 QUALIFIER=echo $BUILD_ID | sed "s/[-_]//g" | cut -c1-12
Essentially I'm taking the build id, along with job name to determine which script to call from my main script. I want to use python instead so I was wondering whether I can use these variables without the jenkins python api.
I hope the question makes sense. Thanks
Assistant: import os
os.environ.get("variable_name")
