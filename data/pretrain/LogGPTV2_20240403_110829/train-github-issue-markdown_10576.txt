##### ISSUE TYPE
  * Feature Idea
##### ANSIBLE VERSION
    ansible 2.1.0.0
      config file = /home/soar/ansible2/ansible.cfg
      configured module search path = Default w/o overrides
##### SUMMARY
When I build new project with Ansible, I place all sensitive information to
vault-encrypted files. I follow KISS principles and this files are included as
`group_vars` (or `host_vars`). All works perfectly. So I have files like:
    ├── ansible.cfg
    ├── inventory
    │   └── projectname
    │       ├── group_vars
    │       │   ├── hosts.yml
    │       │   ├── somegroup.yml
    │       │   └── somegroup-encrypted.yml
    │       └── projectname
    ├── playbooks
    │   ├── deploy-something.yml
    │   └── test.yml
    └── roles
        ├── somerole
        │   ├── defaults
        │   │   └── main.yml
But recently I started to use automated tests for my Ansible projects. So
after commiting to repository, I run something like:
    ansible-playbook -vvv --syntax-check playbooks/test.yml
    ansible-playbook -vvv --connection=local --sudo playbooks/test.yml
And check output. I want to run this tests without my encrypted data, and all
variables are defined with default values in `rolename/defaults/main.yml`.
But... I get only `ERROR! Decryption failed`.
I think, there should be some command-line switch, to run playbook without
decryption for test purposes.
I know, that I can use `vars_files` or `-e` command-line switch, but then I
should type them on every run. And I think encrypted files should be places in
`inventory` with appropriate hosts, and not in playbooks directory.
And, of course, please don't forget about #14721
