compares the estimated and actual RTS sent ratios
from GS and N S. As we can see, our model accurately
estimates the RTS sent ratio, which is very close to the
actual data sent ratio. The actual RTS and data sent
ratios are slightly diﬀerent because of packet losses.
TCP traﬃc: Fig. 3(a) shows the goodput of two
competing TCP ﬂows, when the receiver of one ﬂow
is greedy and inﬂates NAV in all of its CTS frames.
We make the following observations. First, in all cases
the greedy receiver obtains higher goodput than the
normal receiver. Second, as we would expect, the larger
increase in the greedy receiver’s CTS NAV, the larger
goodput gain the greedy receiver has. Moreover, with a
large enough NAV value, the greedy receiver can grab
the channel all the time and completely shut oﬀ the
normal receiver’s traﬃc.
Fig. 3(b) further shows the eﬀect of inﬂating NAV
on ACK frames. The goodput gain from inﬂated ACK
NAV is slightly smaller than that from inﬂated CTS
NAV, because there are more CTS frames sent than
ACK frames (ACK is sent only when RTS, CTS, and
data frames are successfully received, whereas CTS is
sent when RTS is received successfully). As we would
expect, inﬂating NAV on all frames causes the largest
damage: GS-GR pair dominates the medium even
when NAV is inﬂated by 2ms, as shown in Fig. 3(c).
We further evaluate the eﬀect of a greedy receiver
under multiple normal sender-receiver pairs. We con-
sider 8 ﬂows, where one of them has a greedy receiver.

Figure 5. Goodput under 0, 1, or 2 greedy re-
ceivers, when CTS NAV increases by 5, 10, or
31 ms.
We observe that the goodput of the greedy receiver in-
creases with an increasing CTS NAV, at the expense
of degrading the goodput of 7 competing normal re-
ceivers. Moreover, it takes 10ms increase in CTS NAV
for the greedy receiver to dominate the medium. In the
remaining of Section 5.1, unless speciﬁed otherwise, we
use TCP ﬂows since TCP is used more often.
In order to make
Vary Greedy Percentage (GP):
the detection diﬃcult, a greedy receiver may not ma-
nipulate every packet it transmits. To evaluate such
eﬀect, we vary Greedy Percentage (GP ), which denotes
the percentage of time a greedy receiver behaves greed-
ily.
(In this case, GP is the fraction of CTS frames
carrying inﬂated NAV.)
Fig. 4 plots goodput of normal and greedy receivers
as we vary GP and the amount of NAV inﬂation, and
all four nodes are within communication range of each
other. As we would expect, GR has a larger gain with
an increasing GP. Nevertheless even when GP is 50%,
GR already receives substantially higher goodput. For
example, its goodput is over 1Mbps higher than that of
N R when NAV is inﬂated by 5ms, and around 1.8Mbps
higher when NAV is inﬂated by 10ms, and completely
grabs the bandwidth when NAV is inﬂated by 31ms.
Vary the number of greedy receivers: Next we
vary the number of greedy receivers. Fig. 5 considers 2
sender-receiver pairs. As it shows, when both receivers
are normal, they get similar goodput. When only one
receiver is greedy, the greedy receiver gets signiﬁcantly
higher bandwidth and almost starves the normal re-
ceiver. When both receivers are greedy, their perfor-
mance depends on who grabs the medium ﬁrst. The
one that grabs the medium earlier gets the chance to
silence the other ﬂow and has an opportunity to grab
the channel again in the next round.
We further study the case of 8 sender-receiver pairs,

Figure 6. One sender sends to multiple re-
ceivers, one of which inﬂates CTS NAV.
where all greedy receivers have GP=100% and their
NAV is increased by 31 ms. When there are more than
two greedy receivers, only two of the greedy receivers
survive and the rest of the receivers have 0 goodput.
This is because when the amount of NAV increase is
large enough, the ﬁrst few that grab the channel will
dominate the medium.
One sender with multiple receivers: So far we
have studied the cases when there are as many senders
as receivers. Now we examine the case where one
sender sends to more than one receiver. This intro-
duces head-of-line blocking, and reduces the damage
of a greedy receiver to a certain degree. Nevertheless,
even in that case, the greedy receiver can get signiﬁcant
gain.
First, we consider one sender S sending to two re-
ceivers, N R (normal receiver) and GR (greedy re-
ceiver). In this case, S does not respond to the inﬂated
NAV from GR, since the CTS is destined to itself. In-
ﬂated NAV has the following two eﬀects on N R. First,
it prevents N R from sending CTS in response to the
RTS from S in a timely manner. If the CTS is delayed
long enough, the sender S assumes RTS has failed and
backs oﬀ by increasing its contention window. Sec-
ond, when TCP is used, an inﬂated NAV from GR pre-
vents N R from sending TCP ACK in a timely manner.
Fig. 6(a) shows the goodput of N R and GR. Compared
with the case of two sender-receiver pairs, the goodput
increase for the greedy receiver is reduced, even though
the gain is still signiﬁcant. Next we consider one sender
sending to 7 normal receivers and 1 greedy receiver.
Fig. 6(b) shows that there is still gain for the greedy
receiver though the beneﬁt is much smaller than com-
peting with only one normal receiver or having multiple
senders.
Next we consider one sender sending to a normal
receiver and a greedy receiver using UDP. (Figure is
omitted for brevity.) The goodput of both ﬂows de-
creases with an increasing NAV, and GR receives sim-
ilar goodput as NR when sharing the sender. This is
because both CBR ﬂows have the same data rate, and
the queue at the sender has roughly the same number
of packets to normal and greedy receivers. A larger
CTS NAV from GR simply makes the sender ﬂuctu-
ate its contention window and increases the idle time
between two transmissions without changing splitting
ratio between the two receivers. In comparison, under
TCP the sender’s queue has more packets to GR than
to N R, since the TCP ﬂow to N R slows down when
N R does not send ACKs in a timely manner.
