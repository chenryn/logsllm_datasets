### Optimized Text

In this section, we discuss the differences and transitions between various games (Game-2 to Game-5) in a cryptographic context. The primary focus is on the security and simulation aspects of these games.

#### Game-2 and Game-3

The difference between Game-2 and Game-3 can be bounded by the following claim:

**Claim 5.6:** 
\[
| \text{Hybrid}_{E, \text{Sim}2}(\kappa) - \text{Hybrid}_{E, \text{Sim}3}(\kappa) | \leq \text{Adv}^{(N+1)\text{-SDH}}_{G1}(\kappa)
\]
We will provide the proof of this claim later.

#### Game-4

In Game-4, the simulator Sim4, at the first transfer query dictated by the environment \( E \), runs a simulated proof of knowledge \( \text{PK}\{(h) : H = e(g, h)\} \). The value \( L \) returned in each transfer query is computed as \( L \leftarrow (F_\sigma / R_\sigma)^k \), and the final proof of knowledge (PK) in the transfer phase is replaced by a simulated proof.

Note that the simulation of the transfer phase no longer requires knowledge of \( h \). However, all simulated proofs are proofs of true statements, and the change in the computation of \( L \) is purely conceptual. By the perfect zero-knowledge property, we have:
\[
\text{Hybrid}_{E, \text{Sim}4}(\kappa) = \text{Hybrid}_{E, \text{Sim}3}(\kappa)
\]

#### Game-5

In Game-5, the simulator Sim5 replaces the values \( F_1, \ldots, F_N \) sent to the adversary \( A \) during the DBSetup phase with random elements from \( G_T \). At this point, the second proof in the previous game is a simulated proof of a false statement. Intuitively, if these changes enable an environment \( E \) to distinguish the experiments, then one can solve an instance of the BDHE problem. This is captured in the following claim:

**Claim 5.7:**
\[
| \text{Hybrid}_{E, \text{Sim}4}(\kappa) - \text{Hybrid}_{E, \text{Sim}5}(\kappa) | \leq (N + 1) \cdot \text{Adv}^{(N+2)\text{-BDHE}}_{G1, G_T}(\kappa)
\]
We will provide the proof of this claim later.

#### Ideal-World Adversary

Based on the real-world adversary \( A \), we construct an ideal-world adversary \( A' \) that plays the role of the cheating user and performs all the changes to the experiments described in the previous games. At the time of the transfer, after extracting the value of \( \sigma \) from \( A \), it queries credentials from the trusted third party \( T \) for all categories in \( \text{ACL}_\sigma \). Next, \( A' \) queries \( T \) to obtain record \( R_\sigma \). Then it uses this record to compute \( L \leftarrow (F_\sigma / R_\sigma)^k \), and the final PK is replaced by a simulated proof.

It is clear that \( A' \) provides \( A \) with exactly the same environment as Sim5 did, so we have:
\[
\text{Ideal}_{E, A'}(\kappa) = \text{Hybrid}_{E, \text{Sim}5}(\kappa)
\]

The running time of \( A' \) is that of \( A \) plus that of \( O(N^2) \) exponentiations, \( l \) extractions, and \( l \) proof simulations, making it polynomial in the security parameter.

Summing up all the above equations yields the lemma statement. We now need to prove the claims used above.

#### Proof of Claim 5.6

We prove the claim by constructing an adversary \( B \) that breaks the unforgeability under weak chosen-message attack of the modified Boneh-Boyen signature scheme. By the security proof given in the full version [9], this directly gives rise to an expected polynomial-time adversary with non-negligible advantage in solving the \((N + 1)\)-SDH problem.

Given an adversary \( A \) for distinguishing between Game-1 and Game-2, consider the forger \( B \) that outputs tuples:
\[
(1, c_{1,1}, \ldots, c_{1,\ell}), \ldots, (N, c_{N,1}, \ldots, c_{N,\ell})
\]
When given public key \((y_{DB}, y_1, \ldots, y_\ell)\) and signatures \( E_1, \ldots, E_N \), it creates an encrypted database using these values and a self-chosen value \( h \leftarrow G \). At the \( i \)-th transfer, it extracts from \( A \) values \((\sigma, k, \{c_i\})\) such that:
\[
e(K, y_{DB}) e(K, g)^\sigma \prod_{j=1}^\ell e(K, y_j)^{c_{i,j}} = e(g, g)^k
\]
(This extraction is guaranteed to succeed since we already eliminated failed extractions in the transition from Game-0 to Game-1.) When \(\sigma \notin \{1, \ldots, N\}\) or \( c_{\sigma,j} \notin \text{ACL}_\sigma \) for some \( j \), then \( B \) outputs \( s \leftarrow K^{1/k} \) as its forgery on message tuple \((\sigma, c_{\sigma,1}, \ldots, c_{\sigma,\ell})\).

#### Proof of Claim 5.7

Given algorithms \( E \) and \( A \) with non-negligible advantage in distinguishing Game-4 and Game-5, consider the following algorithm \( B \) solving the \((N + 1)\)-PDDH problem. The claim follows by the reduction from the PDDH to the BDHE problem in Theorem 3.4.

On input \( g, g^x, \ldots, g^{x^{N+1}}, H_0, H_1, \ldots, H_{N+1} \), \( B \) runs \( E \) and \( A \) as Sim4 does until \( E \) instructs to create database \( DB = ((R_1, \text{ACL}_1), \ldots, (R_N, \text{ACL}_N)) \). At this point, \( B \) chooses \( x_1, \ldots, x_\ell \leftarrow \mathbb{Z}_p \) and computes \( d_i = i + x_1 c_{i,1} + \ldots + x_\ell c_{i,\ell} \) for \( i = 1, \ldots, N \). Let \( f(X) = \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \alpha_i X^i \) and let \( f_i(X) = f(X)/(X + d_i) = \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} \beta_{i,j} X^j \) for \( i = 1, \ldots, N \). \( B \) computes \( g^{f(x)} = \prod_{i=0}^{N-1} (g^{x^i})^{\alpha_i} \), \( y_{DB} \leftarrow g^{f(x)} \), and \( y_i \leftarrow g^{f(x)x_i} \) for \( i = 1, \ldots, \ell \). For \( i = 1, \ldots, N \), it computes \( E_i \leftarrow g^{f(x)/d_i} \) and \( F_i \leftarrow \prod_{j=0}^{N-1} (H_j)^{\beta_{i,j}} \). Algorithm \( B \) feeds \( \text{pk}_{DB} = (g, g^{f(x)}, y_{DB}, y_1, \ldots, y_\ell) \) as the encrypted database to \( A \), and continues running \( E \) and \( A \) as under Sim4. If \( E \) outputs a bit \( b \), then \( B \) outputs the same bit \( b \).

It is clear that if \( H_i = H_0^{x^i} \) for all \( i \), then the database is distributed exactly as in Game-4, while if \( H_1, \ldots, H_N \) are random, it is distributed exactly as in Game-5. The advantage of \( B \) in breaking the \((N + 1)\)-PDDH assumption is the same as \( E \)'s advantage in distinguishing Game-4 from Game-5.

#### Lemma 5.8

The proof of the following lemma is very similar to that of Lemma 5.4, except that Game 2 is no longer needed. A full proof is given in the full version [9].

**Lemma 5.8:**
For all environments \( E \) and all real-world adversaries \( A \) controlling the issuer and one or more users, there exists an ideal-world adversary \( A' \) such that:
\[
| \text{Real}_{E, A}(\kappa) - \text{Ideal}_{E, A'}(\kappa) | \leq 2^{-\kappa \cdot q} + \text{Adv}^{(N+1)\text{-SDH}}_{G1}(\kappa) + (N + 1) \cdot \text{Adv}^{(N+2)\text{-BDHE}}_{G1, G_T}(\kappa)
\]
where \( q \) is the total number of transfer protocols.
