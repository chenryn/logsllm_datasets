by **PI:EMAIL** :
    Similar to the new TLS field with the tls.ConnectionState in the http.Response struct
    it'd be useful to get access to some connection information.
    For my use case I was missing the IP the client connected to (RemoteAddr); I am not sure
    if there's other information in the current connection API that would be useful to
    expose.
