##### System information (version)
  * OpenCV => 3.4.3
  * Operating System / Platform => Android ARMv7
  * Compiler => Using official binaries
##### Detailed description
I previously used OpenCV 3.1 that I manually compiled to use libjpeg-turbo.
When I switched to OpenCV 3.4.3, I saw that libjpeg-turbo was now used instead
of libjpeg so I used the official Android binaries for both OpenCV and 3rd
party libraries.
However, reading a JPEG image from disk went from 360ms to 800ms (with
`IMREAD_COLOR`) and from 160ms to 300ms (with `IMREAD_GRAYSCALE`). These
images don't have any exif orientation.
##### Steps to reproduce
    cv::imread(path, IMREAD_COLOR)
