ABSTRACT
This paper proposes 1Pipe, a novel communication abstraction that
enables different receivers to process messages from senders in a
consistent total order. More precisely, 1Pipe provides both unicast
and scattering (i.e., a group of messages to different destinations) in
a causally and totally ordered manner. 1Pipe provides a best effort
service that delivers each message at most once, as well as a reliable
service that guarantees delivery and provides restricted atomic
delivery for each scattering. 1Pipe can simplify and accelerate many
distributed applications, e.g., transactional key-value stores, log
replication, and distributed data structures.
We propose a scalable and efficient method to implement 1Pipe
inside data centers. To achieve total order delivery in a scalable
manner, 1Pipe separates the bookkeeping of order information from
message forwarding, and distributes the work to each switch and
host. 1Pipe aggregates order information using in-network compu-
tation at switches. This forms the ‚Äúcontrol plane‚Äù of the system. On
the ‚Äúdata plane‚Äù, 1Pipe forwards messages in the network as usual
and reorders them at the receiver based on the order information.
Evaluation on a 32-server testbed shows that 1Pipe achieves
scalable throughput (80M messages per second per host) and low
latency (10ùúás) with little CPU and network overhead. 1Pipe achieves
linearly scalable throughput and low latency in transactional key-
value store, TPC-C, remote data structures, and replication that
outperforms traditional designs by 2‚àº20x.

1 INTRODUCTION
The lack of total order communication often complicates distributed
system design. For example, when a host atomically reads or writes
multiple objects on different remote hosts, there is no guarantee
that the messages arrive at different remote hosts at the same time,
so, locks are often required to achieve consistency. As another
example, multiple shards of a distributed database generate logs to
multiple replicas, and each replica may receive logs from the shards
in a different interleaving ordering, thus violating data consistency.
As a reaction to this complexity, we propose 1Pipe, a commu-
nication primitive that provides ‚Äúone big pipe‚Äù abstraction in a
data center network (DCN). As Figure 1 shows, messages are sent
in groups and serialized in a virtual pipe, which enables different
receiver processes to deliver messages from sender processes in
a consistent order. More precisely, 1Pipe resembles Causally and
Totally Ordered Communication Support (CATOCS) [25]: (1) mes-
sages are totally ordered, ensuring that they are delivered in the
same order to all receivers; (2) messages are delivered obeying the
causal order in the Lamport logical clock sense [63]. In addition to
unicast, 1Pipe also supports scattering, which groups multiple mes-
sages to different receivers at the same position of the total order.
Different from traditional multicast, each message in a scattering
has distinct content and destination. Users do not need to define
multicast channels or groups because the network is a big CATOCS
channel.
1Pipe can achieve distributed atomic multi-object read and write
with a single scattering because they are delivered at the same
logical time. Replication in 1Pipe takes one round-trip time (RTT).
1Pipe also provides a total ordering of communication events, thus
reducing fences and improving concurrency of distributed systems.
1Pipe seems to require a central serialization point, which is not
scalable. In this work, we propose a scalable and efficient implemen-
tation of 1Pipe in a DCN, where the topology is regular [43, 67],
and switches have generally good programmability. Our principle
is to co-design end hosts with the underlying DCN. We synchronize
the clocks on hosts and ensure they are non-decreasing. The sender
attaches the same timestamp to each packet in a unicast message
or scattering. Each receiver delivers messages in non-decreasing
timestamp order.
At its core, 1Pipe separates the bookkeeping of order information
from message forwarding. 1Pipe forwards timestamped packets as
usual in the network, and buffers them at the receiver side. The
key challenge is to let a receiver know that all the packets below a
certain timestamp have arrived. To this end, we introduce a barrier

timestamp on each link, which is essentially the lower bound of the
timestamps of all future arrival packets. Each switch aggregates
barrier information of all the ingress links to derive the barrier
for all the egress links. In this way, barriers propagate in the DAG
(Directed Acyclic Graph) network along with packet forwarding,
and the receiver can deliver the messages with timestamps below
the barrier in order. If some hosts or links are temporarily idle, we
periodically generate hop-by-hop beacon packets carrying barrier
information.
Regarding packet losses and failures, 1Pipe provides a best effort
service in which lost messages are not retransmitted; and a reliable
service in which a message is guaranteed to be delivered if sender
and all receivers in the scattering do not fail. When a host or switch
fails, reliable 1Pipe ensures restricted failure atomicity: either all
or none messages in a scattering are delivered unless a receiver
fails permanently or network partitions. Reliable 1Pipe uses a two-
phase commit (2PC) approach, where the first phase is end-to-
end packet loss recovery, and the second phase aggregates commit
barriers through the network. It relies on a highly available network
controller to coordinate failure handling, and allows applications
to customize failure handling via callbacks. Reliable 1Pipe adds
one round-trip time (RTT) compared to best effort 1Pipe. We will
show in Sec.2.2 that best effort 1Pipe can achieve replication and
read-only distributed atomic operations without the extra RTT of
reliable 1Pipe.
We implement three incarnations of 1Pipe on network devices
with different programming capabilities: programmable switching
chips [4, 45] that can support flexible stateful per-packet processing,
switch CPUs, and host CPUs in case that switch vendors do not
expose accesses to switch CPUs.
We evaluate 1Pipe in a 32-server cluster with 10 switches and 3-
layer fat-tree topology. 1Pipe achieves linearly scalable throughput
with 512 processes, achieving 5M messages per second per process
(80M msg/s per host). Best effort 1Pipe adds up to 10 ùúás delay to
message delivery, while reliable 1Pipe adds up to 21 ùúás. 1Pipe has
robust performance under packet loss, and can recover from failures
in 50‚àº500 ùúás. 1Pipe only needs 0.3% network bandwidth overhead
and a CPU core per switch for periodic beacons.
As case studies, first, 1Pipe scales linearly for a transactional
key-value store (KVS) in both uniform and YCSB [26] workload,
whose throughput is 90% of a non-transactional system (hardware
limit) and outperforms FaRM [34] by 2‚àº20x especially under high
contention. The latency of 1Pipe is consistently low. Second, 1Pipe
scales linearly in TPC-C [29] benchmark, which outperforms Lock
and OCC by 10x. 1Pipe‚Äôs performance is resilient to packet loss.
Third, by removing fences and enabling replicas to serve reads,
1Pipe improves remote data structure performance to 2‚àº4x. Finally,
1Pipe reduces Ceph [96] replication latency by 64%.
In summary, the contributions of this paper are: (1) a novel
abstraction 1Pipe that provides causally and totally ordered unicast
and scattering with best-effort and reliable semantics; (2) design
and implementation of scalable and efficient 1Pipe in DCNs; (3)
design and evaluation of 1Pipe applications: transactional KVS,
independent transactions, remote data structure, and replication.
This work does not raise any ethical issues.
2 MOTIVATION
2.1 Abstractions of 1Pipe
1Pipe provides a causally and totally ordered communication ab-
straction in a distributed system with multiple hosts, where each
host has multiple processes. Each process has two roles: sender and
receiver. Each host maintains a monotonically increasing times-
tamp, which represents the wall clock and is synchronized among
all hosts. A message consists of one or more packets. When a process
sends a group of messages (i.e., a scattering) to different destina-
tion processes, all packets of the messages are labeled with the
same timestamp of the sender host. Unlike multicast, the list of
destinations can be different for each scattering, in which messages
to different receivers can have different content. The total order
property is: each process delivers messages from different processes
in non-decreasing timestamp order. The causality property is: when
a receiver delivers a message with timestamp T, the timestamp of the
host must be higher than T.

scattering of messages that have the same timestamp.
As Table 1 shows, 1Pipe provides two services with different
reliability guarantees: first, onepipe_unreliable_send/recv is a best
effort service where packet loss is possible. 1Pipe guarantees causal
and total order properties by buffering messages at the receiver and
only delivering them when it receives a barrier timestamp aggre-
gated from the network. So, best effort 1Pipe delivers message in
0.5 RTT plus barrier wait time. Best effort 1Pipe detects lost packets
via end-to-end ACK, but does not retransmit them. Modern data
centers typically have low network utilization and deploy advanced
congestion control mechanisms [10, 48, 61, 75, 101]. Measurements
show that intra-pod packet drop rate is on the order of 10‚àí5 [44].
In RDMA networks with PFC, because congestion loss is elimi-
nated, packet corruption rate should be below 10‚àí8 according to
IEEE 802.3 standard, and links with corruption rate higher than
10‚àí6 are considered to be faulty [102]. So, data center applications
can assume that best effort 1Pipe is almost reliable but should use
onepipe_send_fail_callback to detect lost packets due to packet cor-
ruption or failure of the network or remote process. Loss recovery
is up to the application in this case.
Second, onepipe_reliable_send/recv is a reliable service which in
addition to ordering, guarantees reliability: a message is guaranteed
to be delivered if sender process, receiver process and the network do
not fail. It retransmits packets in the case of packet losses. In this
paper, we only consider crash failures. When a process or network
fails, message delivery stalls. 1Pipe removes in-flight messages from
or to the failed process. If a message cannot be delivered, the send
