User: I'm sure this is a easy question, my Google-fu is obviously failing me.
How do I mount a filesystem using Python, the equivalent of running the shell command mount ...?
Obviously I can use os.system to run the shell command, but surely there is a nice tidy, Python interface to the mount system call.
I can't find it. I thought it would just be a nice, easy os.mount().
Assistant: Note that calling your libc mount function will require root privileges; Popen(['mount'...) only will if the particular mounting isn't blessed in fstab (it is the mount executable, setuid root, that performs these checks).
