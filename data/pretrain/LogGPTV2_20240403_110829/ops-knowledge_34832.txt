User: How to check the real-time log of a process in Linux environment?
Assistant: In the Linux environment, viewing the real-time log of a process can be achieved through the following methods: 1. Use the tail command to view the log file of the process in real time. You can use the tail -f command plus the log file path to monitor the real-time output of the log in real time. 2. Use the journalctl command to view the system log, and filter out the log information of a specific process by specifying the process name. You can use journalctl -f -u process name to view the log of a specific process in real time. 3. Use a log management tool such as syslog-ng or rsyslog to output the log to a specific file, and then use the tail command to view the latest content of the file in real time. 4. If you use a process management tool such as supervisor or systemd to manage the process, you can redirect the output of the process to the standard output or a specific file, and then use the tail command to view the latest content of the file in real time.
