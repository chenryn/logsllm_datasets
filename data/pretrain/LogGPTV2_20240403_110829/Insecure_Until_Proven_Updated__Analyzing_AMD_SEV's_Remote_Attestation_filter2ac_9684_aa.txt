## Abstract
Cloud computing is a prominent technology for hosting Internet services, but it also increases the risk of data theft. Cloud service customers must trust their providers, who control the infrastructure, including the hypervisor that enables multiple tenants to share a single hardware platform. The hypervisor, running in a higher-privileged CPU mode, has direct access to the memory of virtual machines (VMs). While disk encryption can protect data at rest, data in main memory remains vulnerable to a potentially malicious cloud provider.

AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) aims to enhance security in such scenarios by encrypting VM memory with VM-specific keys, thereby denying the hypervisor access to guest memory. SEV also introduces a remote attestation protocol to enable customers to verify the correct deployment of their VMs and ensure that SEV protection is in place.

This paper analyzes the firmware components implementing the SEV remote attestation protocol on the current AMD Epyc Naples CPU series. We demonstrate that it is possible to extract critical CPU-specific keys, which are fundamental to the security of the remote attestation protocol. Using these extracted keys, we propose attacks that allow a malicious cloud provider to completely circumvent SEV protection mechanisms. Although AMD has fixed the underlying firmware issues, the current AMD Epyc CPUs do not prevent the installation of previous, vulnerable firmware versions. This renders SEV ineffective against an untrusted cloud provider, as no purely software-based mitigations are possible.

To address these issues, we propose robust changes to the SEV design that would mitigate the proposed attacks in future generations of the technology.

## 1. Introduction
Cloud computing is a cornerstone of today’s Internet landscape, offering advantages such as on-demand resource allocation and high service availability. However, outsourcing data processing to the cloud comes with significant security risks. The technical infrastructure, including server hardware and software, is under the full control of the cloud provider, raising concerns about data confidentiality and integrity.

Security threats in cloud environments range from misconfigurations to unauthorized access by cloud provider administrators or foreign governments. To address these concerns, both the research community and industry have proposed new approaches to secure cloud computing, even in the presence of an untrusted cloud provider. One such approach is AMD's Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) technology, which aims to:

- Prove the correct deployment of virtual machines.
- Offer runtime protection for virtual machines.

SEV achieves these goals through a dedicated co-processor, the Platform Security Processor (PSP), which creates a cryptographic hash of the initial VM state for remote attestation. Additionally, SEV uses memory encryption with VM-specific keys stored in the PSP, which is not accessible to the main processor. A hardware memory encryption unit provides transparent encryption and decryption using these keys.

Each SEV-enabled platform contains a unique key pair, with the public key signed by AMD. A guest owner can obtain this key from an AMD key server, enabling them to verify the correct deployment of their VM and the presence of SEV protection before injecting sensitive data.

Previous research has focused on the security of SEV-protected VMs at runtime, but the remote attestation feature has not been comprehensively analyzed. Our work fills this gap by examining the firmware components that implement the remote attestation feature. We demonstrate that it is possible to extract the platform-specific private key, enabling a malicious cloud provider to forge SEV, intercept communications, and decrypt guest memory. We also show that purely software-based fixes are insufficient to address these issues.

We propose a new design for the remote attestation protocol that allows reverting to a trusted state even if the platform-specific private key is leaked. Our contributions include:

1. A comprehensive security analysis of the firmware components implementing SEV's remote attestation protocol, revealing issues that allow the extraction of private keys.
2. Proposed attacks based on our findings, which can fake the presence of SEV or extract encrypted VM memory in plaintext.
3. Identification of a severe design issue in the protocol, rendering it ineffective in the presence of common firmware issues.
4. Robust design changes to SEV that would mitigate the impact of firmware security issues in future generations.

## 2. Background
### 2.1 x86 Virtualization Concepts
Hardware extensions for virtualization, introduced by Intel (VT-x) and AMD (SVM) in 2005, distinguish between the higher-privileged host mode and the lower-privileged guest mode. These modes are further divided into privilege rings, allowing the separation of execution compartments. The host mode, controlled by the hypervisor, manages the resources of the guest mode, including memory and CPU time.

### 2.2 Secure Encrypted Virtualization
AMD's Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) technology, introduced in 2016, aims to protect VMs in the presence of an untrusted cloud provider. SEV's primary responsibilities are runtime protection and secure initialization of VMs.

#### Runtime Protection
SEV's runtime protection is based on a memory encryption engine embedded in the memory controller, which encrypts main memory using AES-128. The encryption keys are generated by the Platform Security Processor (PSP), a dedicated ARMv7-based co-processor. The PSP provides an API that the hypervisor must use to manage the encryption keys for SEV-enabled guests. An SEV-enabled guest controls which memory pages are encrypted via its guest pagetable.

#### Remote Attestation
Remote attestation ensures the authenticity of the SEV platform and the integrity of the VM. The SEV firmware, hosted by the PSP, creates a cryptographic hash of the initial VM state, allowing the guest owner to verify the correct deployment and the presence of SEV protection.

The PSP, introduced in 2013, is a dedicated co-processor built into AMD CPUs, providing security functionality. It uses its own memory and non-volatile storage and can access the main processor's system memory. The firmware running on the PSP is provided by AMD and is integrity-protected.

## 3. Firmware Analysis
In this section, we present the results of our firmware analysis, which is essential for understanding the proposed attacks. Our analysis reveals vulnerabilities that allow the extraction of private keys, which are critical to the security of the SEV technology. We also show that the current AMD Epyc CPUs permit the installation of arbitrary signed firmware versions, making it possible to exploit these vulnerabilities even on systems with patched firmware.

## 4. Motivation for Attacks
Our findings motivate several attacks that can be mounted by a malicious cloud provider. These attacks can fake the presence of SEV, intercept communications between the guest owner and the SEV firmware, and decrypt guest memory. The severity of these attacks is amplified by the fact that they can be executed even on platforms without known security issues, as possession of an extracted key is sufficient to mount the attacks.

## 5. Description of Attacks
In this section, we describe the specific attacks enabled by the vulnerabilities in the SEV firmware. These attacks include:

- Faking the presence of SEV to deceive the guest owner.
- Intercepting and manipulating the communication between the guest owner and the SEV firmware.
- Decrypting guest memory to access sensitive data.

## 6. Implications and New Design
The implications of our findings on the security of SEV are significant, as they render the technology ineffective against an untrusted cloud provider. We propose a new design for the remote attestation protocol that addresses the identified issues and allows future generations of SEV to mitigate the impact of firmware security issues.

## 7. Related Work
We provide an overview of related work in the field of secure virtualization and remote attestation, highlighting the contributions and limitations of existing approaches.

## 8. Conclusion
In conclusion, our analysis of the SEV remote attestation protocol reveals significant vulnerabilities that can be exploited by a malicious cloud provider. We propose a new design for the remote attestation protocol that would enhance the security of SEV in future generations. Our findings underscore the importance of robust security measures in cloud computing environments.

## Ethical Considerations
We informed AMD of the firmware issues discovered during our analysis. AMD confirmed the presence of these issues and released security updates to the PSP firmware. We also reported the extracted keys to AMD to facilitate the revocation of the corresponding certificates. Although security fixes are available, our findings show that purely software-based mitigations are insufficient. Therefore, we refrain from publishing specific details on the firmware issues at this time. To prove the successful extraction of private keys, we provide a signature of the paper title created with the extracted keys, which can be verified using certificates provided by AMD.
