User: I seem to be in a never ending tail spin of Linux, or not, Windows or not. Web programming or system programming. Python or PHP.
I'am self teaching myself programming. But it seems I keep being torn about which way to go. Unfortunately it is always seemingly good reasons to get side tracked. You know the whole open source or proprietary thing. Lately I have decided after a year that Linux just doesn't cut it for me and it mostly stems from me wanting to watch videos on Channel 9 etc, and the clunkiness that is Linux. So that lead me to, "Should I learn ASP.NET, since I am more so deciding Windows IS a "necessary" evil.
I hope this made sense. The reason I settled in on Web Development as my course to learning programming is because I actually have a task to implement rather then aimlessly reading reference books etc.
Does anyone have any advice at what they may have done to stay focused and not get lead down every tangent or idea.
Assistant: Really all you need to do is make sure you take baby steps and are doing something you are enjoying.
I started off programming in visual basic on a little game. Not the best language, but it was a good starting point for me at the time. My point is, you don't need to pick the best language/operating system/anything from the start, just iterate. It is the programming way.
By the way, just because you use windows as your OS doesn't mean you have to do everything .NET I use windows and then have a server for all my web hosting that I SSH into.
