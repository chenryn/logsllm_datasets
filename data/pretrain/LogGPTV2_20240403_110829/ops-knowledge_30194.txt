Question: A mobile application development team is considering whether to implement stateful or stateless authentication. Their primary concern is scalability and reducing server load. Which authentication method should they choose, and why?
"A": "Stateful authentication, because it generates a unique session ID for each user, reducing the need to store user data.",
"B": "Stateful authentication, because it maintains user data on the server, improving performance by eliminating client-side processing.",
"C": "Stateless authentication, because it eliminates the need to store session state on the server, improving scalability.",
"D": "Stateless authentication, because it requires a unique session ID, allowing for better load distribution across servers."
Answer: C
