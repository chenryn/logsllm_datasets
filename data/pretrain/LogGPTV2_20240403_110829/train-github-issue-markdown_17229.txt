Typically, a standard mouse is equipped with two buttons. However, many modern mice come with additional buttons, which can be customized to perform various functions. For example, I might want to remap the wheel button to open the Windows Start menu or initiate a Windows search.

Another useful feature is the ability to remap keys on multiple keyboards. If I have two keyboards connected, I can completely remap the secondary keyboard to suit my specific needs.
