Assistant: This log chunk covers a period of approximately one month, from May 11th to June 11th. During this time, the software components gige and node reported normal, warning, and critical log messages, as well as ambient temperature readings. The ambient temperature readings ranged from 27 to 35 degrees. There were more warnings than critical messages, and the last log message was normal.
