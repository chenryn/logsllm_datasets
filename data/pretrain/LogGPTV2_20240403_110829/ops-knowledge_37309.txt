Assistant: The purpose of the IT shared service center is to intensively develop IT services in the digital age and solve the following problems: 1. Data dispersion: unified and centralized management and maintenance of data. 2. Service standards are not uniform: formulate unified IT service standards to improve service quality. 3. Poor digital user experience: provide digital technical support to improve user experience. In addition, IT shared service centers also provide unified IT support services by optimizing costs, integrating IT resources within the organization, and avoiding duplication of investment.
