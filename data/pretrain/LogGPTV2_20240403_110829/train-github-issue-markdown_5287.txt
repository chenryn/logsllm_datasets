##### Issue Type:
Bug Report
##### Ansible Version:
ansible 1.7.2
##### Environment:
Management: Mac OS X  
Target: Debian stable
##### Summary:
I have a SSL certificate stored in a vault file, one of my task copies it to a
file (using the copy module) on the remote server.  
This worked perfectly on 1.7.1, on 1.7.2 it adds an extra newline after every
line which causes my webserver to fail.
Summary: copy module using content from ansible-vault variable -> extra
newlines in target file. Bug is not present in 1.7.1. Possibly unrelated to
ansible-vault.
##### Steps To Reproduce:
  1. Create a vault file
    ssl_crt: |
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      Content goes here
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----
  1. Have a task using vault (include the vault vars file)
    - name: Copy the SSL certificate to the remote server
      copy: content="{{ ssl_crt }}" dest=/etc/ssl/mycert.crt
##### Expected Results:
    /etc/ssl# cat -e mycert.crt
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----$
    Content goes here$
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----$
##### Actual Results:
    /etc/ssl# cat -e mycert.crt
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----$
    $
    Content goes here$
    $
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----$
