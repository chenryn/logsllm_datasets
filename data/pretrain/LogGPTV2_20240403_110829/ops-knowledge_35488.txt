User: I accidentally changed the "Shell path" specified in the Terminal setting for PyCharm and now I am getting this error:

java.io.IOException:Exec_tty error:Unkown reason

I replaced the default value with the string returned by echo $PATH which is:

/usr/local/cuda-7.0/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/usr/local/bin

I've been trying to google what the default value is that goes here, but I have not been able to find it. Can someone help me resolve this?
Notes:
The specific setting is found in Settings > Tools > Terminal > Shell path
Assistant: I came across this error too in PhpStorm, to fix it simply navigate through to... 
Preferences > Tools > Terminal
Under 'Application Settings' click [...] at the end of Shell path and open the .bash profile. 
This should grey out the Shell path to '/bin/bash'
You can now launch Terminal.
