related to issues #8500 , #7808 , #4929 ; using `.hidden-sm` to hide span
within `.nav > li > a` . Because class is `display: block` above -sm then text
wraps to new line. Would you consider `.hidden-*` classes to be `display:
inline-block` instead ?
Here's a jsfiddle of the two cases - but the repercussions could be greater
outside of this situation so probably needs more consideration...
