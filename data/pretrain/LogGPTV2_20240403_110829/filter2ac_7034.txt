**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Privileged Account Management

**Recommendations:**
- Deny the use of local administrative credentials for remote logins to systems.
- Avoid adding domain user accounts to the local Administrators group on multiple systems. 

This approach helps to mitigate the risk of privilege escalation and lateral movement by limiting the scope of administrative access.
