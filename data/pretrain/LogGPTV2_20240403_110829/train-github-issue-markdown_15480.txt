MSVC has a max length of 260 chars for input/output paths, which is exceeded
when using weave. A possible solution (which I tested and seems to work) is to
modify the unique name generation algorithm by making it use md5 hex checksums
instead of sha256 (which are 64 characters long). The places where I made the
modifications are in catalog.expr_to_filename
(https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/master/scipy/weave/catalog.py#L93) and
platform_info.check_sum
(https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/master/scipy/weave/platform_info.py#L99).
This is also caused by the fact that the path to the output obj also
replicates the whole path of the cpp.
