President-elect of Colombia 
First leftist president of Colombia
Friend of the late Fidel 
Castro (CUB) and late 
Hugo Chavez (VEN) 
🤛🤛
Former Senator
Friend of the FARC
Petro’s Stance Towards the U.S.
●
Critical of U.S. economic sanctions 
●
Does not favor an anti-narcotics agenda
●
Critical of extradition of criminals
●
Promotes the rebuilding of diplomatic relations 
between the U.S. and Venezuela
●
Question to you: Who else wins if Petro wins?
The Hypothesis and Result
Hypothesis 
The Venezuelan government is attempting to inﬂuence perceptions in Colombia 
with the goal of achieving political change - getting Petro elected.
Result
The government of Venezuela likely used a third-party ﬁrm to conduct and 
engage in information operations, to include disinformation, to help get Petro 
elected.
■ Who: (Likely) Venezuela’s Government
■ Why: (Likely) Help soften U.S. foreign policy toward Venezuela

○
Adversaries can access this information and use it to deceive…
😐
