User: I just now realize what is causing the trouble:
Whenever the interpreter is busy, my Emacs buffer containing the python script buffer gets stuck, as I suspect that Emacs is trying to get the information of a function, and display it as a pop up. My usual solution is to spam C-g, but that gets old quickly.
It has been bothering me for months, did anyone find a solution (such as a separate thread for the python info)? Even simply ceasing Jedi work while the interpreter is busy really would save a lot of frustration.
I am using Jedi, auto-complete, Python 2.7 and Python 3.3 (the problems occur in both), on Ubuntu.
Assistant: Maybe disable auto-complete at all? BTW from my feeling relying on company, not jedi, the distraction from auto-complete in most cases is far over gain. Emacs comes with a lot of great tools making edits faster: abbrev, dabbrev etc. which seem much more efficient. Well, if jedi delivers really intelligent completions, it might be part of the game.
