### Abstract
IPsec offers a high degree of flexibility in combining its cryptographic mechanisms to build secure communication services. While this flexibility is beneficial for supporting diverse security requirements, it can also introduce potential security vulnerabilities. This paper demonstrates these vulnerabilities by presenting efficient plaintext-recovering attacks against all configurations of IPsec where integrity protection (MAC) is applied before encryption (MAC-then-encrypt). We report on the implementation of our attacks against a specific IPsec implementation and discuss the implications for both real-world deployments and theoretical cryptography.

## 1. Introduction
IPsec is a complex but crucial protocol suite widely used to build Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and secure remote access solutions. It provides security at the IP layer of the TCP/IP protocol stack, offering cryptographic protection for IP packets or their payloads. The flexibility and configurability of IPsec, while intended to support various security needs, can lead to potential security weaknesses.

The RFCs specifying the major component protocols (ESP, AH, IKE) and the IPsec architecture provide limited guidance on optimal configuration. Little published security analysis exists, particularly regarding the combination of encryption and integrity protection. Specifically, while it is known that using ESP in "encryption-only" configurations is insecure, there has been no systematic evaluation of the many ways to combine encryption and integrity protection in IPsec.

### Key Configurations:
- **ESP with Integrity Protection**: Uses a MAC algorithm after encryption (encrypt-then-MAC).
- **AH with ESP**: Can be used to provide integrity protection, with the MAC algorithm having a broader scope than ESP. Packets can be first protected by AH and then encrypted by ESP, or vice versa.
- **Two Layers of ESP Processing**: Can achieve a MAC-then-encrypt construction.
- **Combined-Mode Algorithms**: Encrypt and provide integrity protection in a single step.
- **Tunnel and Transport Modes**: Both AH and ESP can be applied in either mode.
- **Replay Protection**: Sequence number checking can be enabled or disabled, impacting security.

### Guidance from Literature:
- **Encrypt-Then-MAC**: Theoretical support comes from studies showing IND-CCA security if the encryption algorithm is IND-CPA secure and the MAC is strongly unforgeable.
- **MAC-Then-Encrypt**: Some literature suggests avoiding this configuration due to potential vulnerabilities, while others provide positive security results under certain conditions.

Given the lack of clear guidance, network administrators might be tempted to use MAC-then-encrypt configurations. This paper focuses on the security of such configurations, specifically in the context of site-to-site VPNs. We describe practical attacks against all MAC-then-encrypt configurations, including common and more exotic ones. Our attacks are powerful, capable of recovering plaintext from arbitrary IPsec-protected packets, and vary in complexity and requirements.

### Contributions:
1. **Practical Attacks**: We present three types of attacks, each with two variants depending on whether replay protection is enabled.
2. **Experimental Validation**: We validate our attacks against the OpenSolaris implementation of IPsec, demonstrating their effectiveness in practice.
3. **Implications for Practice**: We show that certain IPsec configurations, particularly those involving AH followed by ESP, are insecure and should be avoided.
4. **Theoretical Implications**: Our work highlights the limitations of current cryptographic theory in addressing the combination of encryption and integrity protection, especially in the presence of non-atomic operations and other real-world features.

### Related Work
Previous studies have focused on encryption-only configurations, showing them to be insecure. Our work extends these techniques to include integrity and replay protection, providing a comprehensive analysis of MAC-then-encrypt configurations.

This paper aims to provide clear guidance for practitioners and contribute to the theoretical understanding of secure channel constructions in real-world network protocols.
