## Abstract
A large and rapidly growing proportion of users connect to the Internet via residential broadband networks such as Digital Subscriber Lines (DSL) and cable. These networks often serve as the bottleneck in the last mile of today's Internet, significantly affecting the performance of applications like voice-over-IP, online games, and peer-to-peer content sharing systems. Despite their importance, few studies have rigorously characterized these networks at scale. In this paper, we present the first large-scale measurement study of major cable and DSL providers in North America and Europe. We describe and evaluate the measurement tools we developed for this purpose. Our analysis reveals important differences between residential networks and conventional Internet operations, and we discuss the implications for emerging protocols and systems.

## 1. Introduction
Residential broadband networks, including Digital Subscriber Lines (DSL) and cable, are increasingly being used to access the Internet. With over 158 million users worldwide [39], and an expected rise to 477 million by 2011 [51], these networks provide critical 'last mile' access. In the United States, more than half of all Internet users connect via residential broadband networks [38]. Many governments are also promoting policies to ensure ubiquitous broadband access [18, 48].

The reliability and performance of Internet applications, such as voice-over-IP (VoIP), video on demand, online games, and peer-to-peer content delivery systems, depend crucially on the characteristics of these broadband access networks. Despite their widespread deployment and importance, residential broadband networks remain relatively unexplored by the academic community. While many studies have focused on the Internet's core [6, 26, 40] and academic/research edge networks [5, 35], rigorous measurement data characterizing residential network deployments at scale are lacking.

In the absence of systematic studies, knowledge about residential broadband networks is often based on anecdotal evidence, hearsay, and marketing claims. Although it is known that broadband networks have different characteristics from academic networks [5, 43], there have been no large-scale studies quantifying these differences. This lack of data leaves researchers uncertain about how well protocols or systems evaluated in academic networks would perform in the commercial Internet, where broadband networks are widely deployed.

One reason for the lack of large-scale measurement studies is limited access to broadband environments. Most academic institutions and research laboratories do not use broadband for Internet access, and even state-of-the-art research network testbeds, such as PlanetLab [41] and RON [2], have only a few broadband nodes. To address this, we developed tools that can measure broadband networks remotely without requiring cooperation from end hosts connected to the broadband links.

In this paper, we present the first large-scale measurement study examining 1,894 broadband hosts from 11 major commercial cable and DSL providers in North America and Europe. We developed tools to measure a large number of remote broadband links and performed a detailed characterization of various properties of these links. Our analysis was driven by three key questions:
1. What are the typical bandwidth, latency, and loss characteristics of residential broadband links?
2. How do the characteristics of broadband networks differ from those of academic or corporate networks?
3. What are the implications of broadband network properties for future protocol and system designers?

Our findings reveal significant differences between cable and DSL networks and the conventional wisdom about the Internet, which has been shaped by prior studies of academic networks. For example, many cable links show high variation in link bandwidths over short timescales, and packet transmissions suffer high jitter due to cable's time-slotted access policy. DSL links exhibit large last-hop delays and active queue management policies such as random early detection (RED). Both cable and DSL ISPs use traffic shaping and deploy massive queues that can delay packets for several hundred milliseconds.

These findings have important implications for emerging protocols and systems. For instance, the high packet jitter in cable links can affect transport protocols that rely on round-trip time (RTT) measurements to detect congestion, such as TCP Vegas [9] and PCP [3]. Additionally, the large queue sizes found in both cable and DSL ISPs can be detrimental to real-time applications like VoIP when they are used concurrently with bandwidth-intensive applications like BitTorrent [8].

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of residential cable and DSL networks. Section 3 describes our measurement methodology, including the tools we built for gathering data over remote broadband network links. Section 4 presents an in-depth analysis of our data set, characterizing the bandwidth, latency, and loss properties of broadband networks. Section 5 discusses the implications of our findings for the designers of future protocols and systems. Section 6 presents related work, and Section 7 summarizes our conclusions.

## 2. Background
Two types of broadband access networks are popular today: cable networks and DSL networks. In this section, we provide a brief description of their architectures and highlight differences from other access networks, such as corporate and academic networks.

### 2.1 Cable Networks
Cable networks use the existing cable television infrastructure to connect home users to the Internet. A master headend connects to several regional headends using fiber-optic cables. Each regional headend serves a set of customers (up to 2,000 homes) via a single coaxial cable carrying both television and data signals.

DOCSIS [10] is the most common specification defining the interface requirements of cable modems. In DOCSIS, each cable modem (CM) exchanges data with a cable modem termination system (CMTS) located in a regional headend. In the downstream direction, the CMTS broadcasts data to all connected cable modems, which filter and forward only the data destined for their customer's host. In the upstream direction, the access channel is time-slotted; a CM must first reserve a time slot and wait for the CMTS to grant the reservation before transmitting data.

Key differences between cable and other access networks include:
- **Asymmetric Bandwidths:** Cable links typically have higher downstream bandwidth compared to upstream.
- **Traffic Shaping:** Users cannot use the full raw capacity of their cable links. Instead, cable networks use traffic shaping to restrict users from consuming more bandwidth than their contract stipulates.
- **Over-Subscription:** Some ISPs over-subscribe their cable access networks, leading to varying service levels depending on competing network traffic.
- **Packet Concatenation:** Cable modems can concatenate multiple upstream packets into a single transmission, resulting in short bursts at high data rates and fluctuating upstream latencies.

### 2.2 Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) Networks
DSL access networks use existing telephone wiring to connect home users to the Internet [13]. Unlike cable customers, DSL customers do not share their access link. Each customer's DSL modem uses a dedicated point-to-point connection to exchange data with a Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer (DSLAM). The connection carries both data and telephone signals, which are encoded in different frequencies. On the customer side, a splitter separates the two signals and forwards the data signal to the DSL modem.

Key differences between DSL networks and other access networks include:
- **Asymmetric Bandwidths:** Like cable networks, DSL networks often have higher downstream bandwidth.
- **Distance-Dependent Data Rates:** The maximum data transmission rate decreases with increasing distance from the DSLAM. Advanced signal processing and error correction algorithms can boost data rates but may lead to high packet propagation delays.

## 3. Measurement Methodology
Our goal was to perform a rigorous characterization of broadband access networks, measuring their link bandwidths, latencies, and loss rates. We also characterized the properties of broadband queues, including queue sizes and packet drop policies. Finally, we examined the time-slotted access policy of the upstream channel in cable networks and its effects on latency and jitter. Given the asymmetric nature of broadband access links, we measured the properties of the upstream and downstream directions separately.

To ensure our study was generally applicable, we needed to conduct it at a large scale. Previous studies [14, 32, 33] required cooperation from remote broadband hosts, limiting the scale of the measurement. Instead, we developed a methodology that requires minimal cooperation from remote hosts, allowing us to scale to thousands of broadband links.

Remote hosts need to cooperate in two simple ways:
1. Respond to ICMP echo request packets with ICMP echo responses.
2. Send TCP reset (RST) packets when they receive TCP acknowledgments (ACK) that do not belong to an open TCP connection.

### 3.1 Selecting Residential Broadband Hosts
We used techniques similar to those described in [23] to select 1,894 broadband hosts from 11 major cable and DSL providers in North America and Europe. We identified IP address ranges of popular residential ISPs from IP-to-DNS mappings and scanned for IP addresses responding to our probes.

Table 1 summarizes high-level information about the ISPs we measured. Our study includes five out of the top ten largest broadband ISPs in the U.S. [27], the largest cable provider in Canada [28], the second-largest cable provider in the Netherlands [50], and the largest DSL provider in the U.K. [42]. From each ISP, we randomly chose approximately 100 hosts for measurement.

Table 1 also shows the bandwidths advertised by ISPs on their websites. All advertised bandwidths are lower than 10 Mbps. We used 10 Mbps probe streams to saturate these broadband links and their routers.

### 3.2 Probe Trains to Measure Broadband Links
We used five types of probe packet trains to measure each broadband link. Each probe train was sent from well-connected hosts located in four geographically dispersed academic networks (Figure 2). We also probed the last-hop router before each broadband link using traceroute.

- **Asymmetric Large-TCP Flood:** Sent large (1,488-byte) TCP ACK packets, and the remote host responded with small (∼40-byte) TCP RST packets. This saturated the downstream links and router queues.
- **Symmetric Large-ICMP Flood:** Sent large (1,488-byte) ICMP echo request packets, and the remote host responded with ICMP echo response packets of the same size. This saturated the links and router queues in both directions.
- **Symmetric Small-TCP Flood:** Sent small (40-byte to 100-byte) TCP ACK packets, and the remote host responded with small (∼40-byte) TCP RST packets. This saturated the network in both directions with smaller packets.
- **Symmetric Large-ICMP Trickle:** Sent large (1,488-byte) ICMP echo request packets spaced at large intervals randomly chosen between 10 ms and 30 ms. This did not saturate the links.
- **Symmetric Small-TCP Trickle:** Sent small (40-byte) TCP ACK packets spaced at large random intervals.

We repeated the floods every half hour for one week to capture diurnal variations in network properties.

## 4. Data Analysis
In this section, we present an in-depth analysis of our data set, characterizing the bandwidth, latency, and loss properties of broadband networks.

### 4.1 Bandwidth Characteristics
- **Cable Networks:** Many cable links show high variation in link bandwidths over short timescales. Traffic shaping and over-subscription contribute to these fluctuations.
- **DSL Networks:** Downstream bandwidth is generally higher than upstream, and the maximum data rate decreases with distance from the DSLAM.

### 4.2 Latency and Jitter
- **Cable Networks:** Packet transmissions suffer high jitter due to the time-slotted access policy. Upstream latencies can fluctuate heavily.
- **DSL Networks:** Large last-hop delays and active queue management policies, such as RED, are common.

### 4.3 Loss Rates and Queue Properties
- **Cable and DSL Networks:** Both types of networks use traffic shaping and deploy large queues, which can delay packets for several hundred milliseconds. This can be detrimental to real-time applications.

## 5. Implications for Protocol and System Design
Our findings have important implications for the design of future protocols and systems. For example:
- **High Jitter in Cable Links:** Transport protocols that rely on RTT measurements, such as TCP Vegas [9] and PCP [3], may be affected.
- **Large Queue Sizes:** Real-time applications like VoIP can be negatively impacted when used concurrently with bandwidth-intensive applications like BitTorrent [8].

## 6. Related Work
Previous studies have focused on the Internet's core [6, 26, 40] and academic/research edge networks [5, 35]. However, few have rigorously characterized residential broadband networks at scale. Our work fills this gap by providing a comprehensive analysis of the properties of cable and DSL networks.

## 7. Conclusions
In this paper, we presented the first large-scale measurement study of major cable and DSL providers in North America and Europe. Our analysis revealed significant differences between residential networks and conventional Internet operations. We discussed the implications of our findings for the design of future protocols and systems. Future work should continue to explore the evolving characteristics of residential broadband networks and their impact on Internet applications.
