A large and rapidly growing proportion of users connect to
the Internet via residential broadband networks such as Dig-
ital Subscriber Lines (DSL) and cable. Residential networks
are often the bottleneck in the last mile of today’s Internet.
Their characteristics critically aﬀect Internet applications,
including voice-over-IP, online games, and peer-to-peer con-
tent sharing/delivery systems. However, to date, few studies
have investigated commercial broadband deployments, and
rigorous measurement data that characterize these networks
at scale are lacking.
In this paper, we present the ﬁrst large-scale measurement
study of major cable and DSL providers in North America
and Europe. We describe and evaluate the measurement
tools we developed for this purpose. Our study character-
izes several properties of broadband networks, including link
capacities, packet round-trip times and jitter, packet loss
rates, queue lengths, and queue drop policies. Our analysis
reveals important ways in which residential networks diﬀer
from how the Internet is conventionally thought to operate.
We also discuss the implications of our ﬁndings for many
emerging protocols and systems, including delay-based con-
gestion control (e.g., PCP) and network coordinate systems
(e.g., Vivaldi).

INTRODUCTION
1.
Residential broadband networks such as Digital Subscriber
Lines (DSL) and cable are increasingly being used to access
the Internet. More than 158 million people use these net-
works worldwide [39], and this number is expected to rise
to 477 million by 2011 [51].
In the United States alone,
more than half of all Internet users connect via residential
broadband networks [38].
In addition, many governments
are adopting policies to promote ubiquitous broadband ac-
cess [18, 48].
Residential broadband networks provide the critical ‘last
mile’ access to the Internet infrastructure.
It is widely
thought that the bottlenecks in the performance of the In-
ternet lie in its access networks [1]. So the reliability and the
performance of Internet applications – including voice-over-
IP (VoIP), video on demand, online games, and peer-to-peer
content delivery systems – depend crucially on the charac-
teristics of broadband access networks.
Despite the widespread deployment of residential broad-
band networks and their importance to emerging applica-
tions, they remain relatively unexplored by the academic
community. Although many measurement studies have fo-
cused on the Internet’s core [6,26,40] and academic/research
edge networks [5, 35], rigorous measurement data that char-
acterize residential network deployments at scale are lacking.
In the absence of systematic studies, knowledge about res-
idential broadband networks is based on anecdotal evidence,
hearsay, and marketing buzzwords. Although broadband
networks are known to have very diﬀerent characteristics
from academic networks [5, 43], there have been no large-
scale studies quantifying these diﬀerences. As a result, re-
searchers today are left to second-guess how well protocols or
systems evaluated in academic networks would work in the
commercial Internet, where broadband networks are widely
deployed.
One reason for the lack of large-scale measurement stud-
ies on residential networks is that researchers have limited
access to broadband environments. Most academic insti-
tutions and research laboratories do not access the Inter-
net over broadband. Even state-of-the-art research network
testbeds, such as PlanetLab [41] and RON [2], have only a
handful of broadband nodes. We overcame this problem by
developing tools that can measure broadband networks re-
motely and without cooperation from end hosts connected
to the broadband links.
In this paper, we present the ﬁrst large-scale measurement
study examining 1,894 broadband hosts from 11 major com-

rope. To conduct this study, we developed tools that enable
us to measure a large number of remote broadband links.
We performed a detailed characterization of an extensive set
of properties of broadband links. Our analysis was driven
by three questions:
1. What are the typical bandwidth, latency, and loss char-
acteristics of residential broadband links?
2. How do the characteristics of broadband networks dif-
fer from those of academic or corporate networks?
3. What are the implications of broadband-network prop-
erties for future protocol and system designers?
Our study reveals important ways in which cable and DSL
networks diﬀer from the conventional wisdom about the In-
ternet, accumulated from prior studies of academic networks.
For example, many cable links show high variation in link
bandwidths over short timescales. Packet transmissions over
cable suﬀer high jitter as a result of cable’s time-slotted ac-
cess policy. DSL links show large last-hop delays and con-
siderable deployment of active queue management policies
such as random early detection (RED). Both cable and DSL
ISPs use traﬃc shaping and deploy massive queues that can
delay packets for several hundred milliseconds.
Our ﬁndings have important implications for emerging
protocols and systems. For instance, the high packet jit-
ter in cable links can aﬀect transport protocols that rely
on round-trip time (RTT) measurements to detect conges-
tion, such as TCP Vegas [9] and PCP [3]. Further, the large
queue sizes found in cable and DSL ISPs can be detrimental
to real-time applications such as VoIP when they are used
concurrently with bandwidth-intensive applications such as
BitTorrent [8].
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2
provides an overview of residential cable and DSL networks.
Section 3 describes our measurement methodology, including
the tools we built for gathering data over remote broadband
network links. Section 4 then presents an in-depth analysis of
our data set, characterizing the bandwidth, latency and loss
properties of broadband networks. In Section 5, we discuss
the implications of our ﬁndings for the designers of future
protocols and systems. Section 6 presents related work, and
Section 7 summarizes our conclusions.
2. BACKGROUND
Two types of broadband access networks are popular to-
day: cable networks and DSL networks.
In this section,
we present a brief description of their architectures, and we
point out diﬀerences to other access networks, such as cor-
porate and academic networks.
2.1 Cable networks
Cable networks use the cable television infrastructure to con-
nect home users to the Internet. In these networks, a master
headend connects to several regional headends using ﬁber-
optic cables. Each regional headend serves a set of customers
(up to 2,000 homes). A single coaxial cable, carrying both
television and data signals, links these customers to their
headend.
DOCSIS [10] is the most common speciﬁcation deﬁning
the interface requirements of cable modems.
In DOCSIS,
each cable modem (CM) exchanges data with a cable modem
termination system (CMTS) located in a regional headend.
In the downstream direction, the CMTS broadcasts data
to all cable modems that are connected to it. The cable
modems ﬁlter all received data and forward only the bytes
destined for their customer’s host. In the upstream direction,
the access channel is time-slotted – a cable modem must
ﬁrst reserve a time slot and wait until the CMTS grants the
reservation. When the time slot has been granted, the cable
modem can transmit data upstream. Figure 1(a) illustrates
a typical setup of a cable access network.
There are several important diﬀerences between cable and
other access networks. First, cable links typically have asym-
metric bandwidths: their downstream bandwidth is much
higher than their upstream bandwidth. Second, customers
cannot use the full raw capacity of their cable links. Instead,
cable networks use traﬃc shaping to restrict users from con-
suming more bandwidth than their contract stipulates. Al-
though cable networks currently allow raw data rates of up
to 40 Mbps, the contracts of individual customers specify
much lower rates, between 128 Kbps and 10 Mbps. Further,
some ISPs over-subscribe their cable access networks. In this
case, the level of service experienced by customers can vary
depending on the amount of competing network traﬃc.
Finally, cable modems can concatenate multiple upstream
packets into a single transmission, which results in short
bursts at high data rates. Thus, the upstream latencies can
ﬂuctuate heavily, depending on the allocation policy, and the
amount of signaling and concatenation used by the CMTS.
2.2 Digital Subscriber Line networks
DSL access networks use existing telephone wiring to con-
nect home users to the Internet [13]. Unlike cable customers,
DSL customers do not share their access link. Each cus-
tomer’s DSL modem uses a dedicated point-to-point con-
nection to exchange data with a Digital Subscriber Line
Access Multiplexer (DSLAM). The connection carries both
data and telephone signals, which are encoded in diﬀerent
frequencies. On the customer side, a splitter separates the
two signals and forwards the data signal to the DSL mo-

dem. Figure 1(b) illustrates a typical setup of a DSL access
network.
There are two important diﬀerences between DSL net-
works and other access networks. First,
like cable net-
works, DSL networks often have asymmetric bandwidths;
their downstream bandwidth is higher than their upstream
bandwidth. Second, the maximum data transmission rate
falls with increasing distance from the DSLAM. To boost
the data rates, DSL relies on advanced signal processing and
error correction algorithms, which can lead to high packet
propagation delays. Consequently, the properties of DSL ac-
cess links vary depending on the length or the quality of the
wiring between a modem and its DSLAM.
3. MEASUREMENT METHODOLOGY
The goal of our study was to perform a rigorous characteri-
zation of broadband access networks. For this, we measured
their link bandwidths, latencies, and loss rates. We also
characterized the properties of broadband queues, including
queue sizes and packet drop policies. Finally, we examined a
physical property speciﬁc to the cable transmission medium:
the time-slotted access policy of the upstream channel. We
measured the eﬀects of this access policy on latency and
jitter. Because broadband access links are asymmetric, we
measured the properties of the upstream and downstream
directions separately.
For our measurements to be generally applicable, the
study needed to be performed at large scale. Previous stud-
ies of broadband [14, 32, 33] used measurement tools that re-
quired cooperation from the remote broadband hosts. Such
a methodology restricts the scale of the measurement study.
Instead, we developed a diﬀerent methodology for conduct-
ing large-scale detailed broadband measurements. Our ap-
proach requires minimal cooperation from the remote hosts,
allowing our measurements to scale to thousands of broad-
band links.
Remote hosts need to cooperate only in two simple ways.
First, they must respond to ICMP echo request packets with
ICMP echo responses. Second, they must send TCP re-
set (RST) packets when they receive TCP acknowledgments
(ACK) that do not belong to an open TCP connection. Both
responses are mandated by the corresponding protocols, and
previous work shows they are supported widely [23].
At a high level, our technique is simple – we probe the
broadband link with packet trains of diﬀerent rates, using
packets of various types and sizes. We use the responses re-
ceived to infer a broad range of characteristics, both down-
stream and upstream. This approach requires support from
only one endpoint of an Internet path, but obtaining ac-
curate measurements is more challenging than with tools
that require support from both endpoints or with tools that
have been explicitly designed to measure one speciﬁc prop-
erty [17, 29, 33].
In the remainder of this section, we present our measure-
ment methodology in more detail. We describe how we se-
lected broadband hosts from diﬀerent ISPs. We list the types
of probe trains used to gather data. And we describe how we
inferred the characteristics of the broadband links. Finally,
we present how we validated the assumptions of our method-
ology, and we discuss potential concerns and limitations of
our tools.
3.1 Selecting residential broadband hosts
We used techniques similar to those described in [23] to se-
lect 1,894 broadband hosts from 11 major cable and DSL
providers in North America and Europe. We identiﬁed
IP address ranges of popular residential ISPs from IP-to-
DNS mappings (e.g., BellSouth’s DNS names are adsl-
*.bellsouth.net), and we scanned for IP addresses re-
sponding to our probes.
Table 1 summarizes high-level information about the ISPs
we measured. Our study includes ﬁve out of the top ten
largest broadband ISPs in the U.S. [27]1, the largest cable
provider in Canada [28], the second-largest cable provider in
the Netherlands [50], and the largest DSL provider in the
U.K. [42]. From each ISP, we chose approximately 100 hosts
randomly and measured them.
Table 1 also shows the bandwidths advertised by ISPs on
their web sites. Although a range of speeds is available, all
advertised bandwidths are lower than 10 Mbps. We took
advantage of this property by using 10 Mbps probe streams
to saturate these broadband links and their routers.
3.2 Probe trains to measure broadband links
We used ﬁve types of probe packet trains to measure each
broadband link. Each probe train was sent from well-
connected hosts located in four academic networks (Fig-
ure 2). The academic networks used are dispersed geograph-
1During the recent consolidation of the U.S. telecom indus-
try, many large ISPs merged with each other. Four of the
eleven ISPs we measured are owned today by AT&T, a single
company. However, our measurements show that their net-
works have very diﬀerent characteristics. For the purposes
of this study, we treat them as independent ISPs.

ically – three in North America (in the south, northwest, and
northeast) and one in Europe. We also probed the last-hop
router before each broadband link. We used traceroute to
discover these routers.
We sent probe trains at diﬀerent rates. We refer to our
high-rate probe trains as ﬂoods, and to our low-rate probe
trains as trickles. All ﬂoods were sent at 10 Mbps to saturate
the broadband links. Consequently, packet ﬂoods measure
the network under congestion. By contrast, all packet trick-
les were sent at a rate of a few tens of Kbps, so they char-
acterize the broadband network under normal operational
conditions.
We limited the packet ﬂoods to at most 10 s, whereas we
allowed trickles to last from several hours to several days. To
capture diurnal variations of network properties, we repeated
the ﬂoods every half hour for one week.
Asymmetric large-TCP ﬂood: We sent large (1,488-
byte2) TCP ACK packets, and the remote host responded
with small (∼40-byte) TCP RST packets. The ACK pack-
ets saturated the downstream links and router queues, but
the responses, being smaller and fewer, did not saturate the
upstream links or queues.
Symmetric large-ICMP ﬂood: We sent large (1,488-
byte) ICMP echo request (PING) packets, and the remote
host responded with ICMP echo response packets of the same
size. This packet train saturated the links and router queues
in both downstream and upstream directions.
Symmetric small-TCP ﬂood: We sent small (40-byte to
100-byte) TCP ACK packets, and the remote host responded
with small (∼40-byte) TCP RST packets. Like the symmet-
ric large-probe ﬂood, this packet train saturated the network
in both downstream and upstream directions but with much
smaller packets.
Symmetric large-ICMP trickle: We sent large (1, 488-
byte) ICMP echo request packets spaced at large intervals
randomly chosen between 10 ms and 30 ms, and the remote
host responded with ICMP echo response packets of the same
size. Unlike the above probe trains, this packet train did not
saturate the downstream or upstream links.
Symmetric small-TCP trickle: We sent small (40-byte)
TCP ACK packets spaced at large random intervals between
