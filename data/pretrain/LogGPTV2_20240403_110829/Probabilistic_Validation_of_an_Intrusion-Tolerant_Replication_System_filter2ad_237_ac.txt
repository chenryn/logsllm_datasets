### 4.1. Impact of Different Distributions of a Constant Number of Hosts into Domains

ITUA is a system currently under active development. A critical design decision is determining the optimal number of hosts to place in each security domain. The question arises: Is it more effective to treat each host as a separate security domain, or should multiple hosts be grouped within a single domain? To address this, we conducted two studies.

#### First Study: Performance with Various Distributions of 12 Hosts

The first study aimed to evaluate the system's performance for different distributions of a constant number of hosts. We distributed 12 hosts into 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12 domains and considered 2, 4, 6, or 8 applications, each with 7 replicas.

**Figure 3(a): Unavailability Variation**

- **X-axis:** Number of hosts per domain.
- **Y-axis:** Unavailability of an application.

Key Observations:
- As the number of hosts per domain increases, the number of domains decreases.
- The system is more available when there are fewer hosts per domain, primarily because more domains can be created, reducing the risk of running out of domains when many are excluded.
- Unavailability remains low even without human intervention for several hours.
- The unavailability for a specific application does not change significantly with an increase in the number of applications.

**Figure 3(b): Unreliability Variation**

- **X-axis:** Number of hosts per domain.
- **Y-axis:** Unreliability of an application.

Key Observations:
- Unreliability increases rapidly as the number of hosts per domain increases, especially from 0 to 4 hosts.
- The maximum unreliability occurs at 4 hosts per domain and then decreases for higher numbers of hosts.
- This behavior is explained by the classic reliability argument: if the failure of one replicated component can cause a catastrophic failure, increasing replication decreases reliability due to the higher probability of failure.
- With four or more hosts per domain, there are enough replicas to form 1, 2, or 3 domains, leading to a higher chance of corruption and subsequent failure to reach Byzantine agreement.

**Figure 3(c): Fraction of Corrupt Hosts in an Excluded Domain**

- **X-axis:** Number of hosts per domain.
- **Y-axis:** Fraction of corrupt hosts.

Key Observations:
- More hosts per domain result in a higher fraction of corrupt hosts, leading to resource wastage.
- The fraction is not 1 when there is one host per domain, as false alarms can exclude domains without any host being corrupted.

**Figure 3(d): Fraction of Domains Excluded**

- **X-axis:** Number of hosts per domain.
- **Y-axis:** Fraction of domains excluded.

Key Observations:
- A larger number of domains are excluded when there are more hosts per domain, negatively impacting the availability of applications.

### 4.2. Impact of Different Numbers of Hosts Distributed into a Constant Number of Domains

To further investigate the benefits of distributing more hosts into a fixed number of domains, we conducted a second study with 10 domains and varied the number of hosts per domain from 1 to 4. Each application had 7 replicas, and other parameters were consistent with the previous study.

**Parameters:**
- Intrusion detection probabilities: 90% for script-based on hosts, 75% for exploratory on hosts, 40% for innovative on hosts, 80% for replicas, and 80% for management entities.
- Miscellaneous: domain propagation rate of 1 per time unit; system-wide propagation rate of 0.1 per time unit; infiltration of a host doubles the chances that the replicas and management entity running on it will also be infiltrated; a corrupt replica exhibits anomalous behavior twice per time unit.

These values are based on experience and security literature. The following studies also explore the system's sensitivity to variations in these parameters.
