#### Network DoS Mitigation
When the volume of a flood attack exceeds the capacity of the targeted network connection, it is often necessary to intercept and filter the incoming traffic upstream. This can be achieved by either the hosting Internet Service Provider (ISP) or a third-party service such as a Content Delivery Network (CDN) or a specialized DoS mitigation provider. (Citation: CERT-EU DDoS March 2017)

Depending on the volume of the flood, on-premises filtering may also be possible. This can be done by blocking source addresses that are generating the attack, blocking ports that are being targeted, or blocking the protocols used for transport. (Citation: CERT-EU DDoS March 2017)

Given the need for rapid response, it is essential to analyze the risk to critical resources and develop a disaster recovery plan or business continuity plan to address Network DoS attacks. (Citation: CERT-EU DDoS March 2017)
