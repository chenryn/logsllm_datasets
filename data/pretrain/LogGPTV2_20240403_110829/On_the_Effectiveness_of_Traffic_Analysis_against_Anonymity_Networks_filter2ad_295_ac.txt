the difference between average throughput for the server-to-exit and the entry-to-client
trafﬁc (for all clients). From our experience, for the victim trafﬁc, the difference was
within 120 Kbit/s. We removed ﬂows where this difference was over 120 Kbit/s.
These experiments were also repeated with the server injecting a “step” like pat-
tern, achieved by switching the trafﬁc between 1 Mbit/s, 50 Kbit/s, 300 Kbit/s and 100
Kbit/s, every 30 seconds. The average correlation between the server-to-exit and entry-
to-client trafﬁc statistics was higher than the average correlation to the non-victim client
statistics. These can be seen in Figures 5(a) and 5(b). We correctly identiﬁed the victim
ﬂow in 71 out of the 90 trials (success rate of 78.9%). There were six false positives in
our measurements, where non-victim clients showed highest correlation to the server-
to-exit trafﬁc. In these false positive, the number of sample intervals for the entry-to-
client trafﬁc were less than half the number of sample intervals corresponding to the
server-to-exit trafﬁc. These fewer sample intervals resulted in correlation representing
an inaccurate relationship. In 13 of the remaining cases we were not able to correctly
select the victim either because the correlation coefﬁcient was statistically not signiﬁ-
cant (< 0.2), or the victim ﬂow was ﬁltered out as its average throughput varied from
the the average server-to-exit throughput by more than 120 Kbit/s.
Monitoring multiple Tor relays: Finally, we evaluated our attack in a scenario involving
an additional relay. We launched a second relay in our institution. The purpose of this
second Tor relay was to judge the effectiveness of our attack in the presence more
clients. The two relays together served about 1500 clients. This scenario indicates what
to expect when an adversary monitors multiple relays.
Our experiments involved injecting the “step” like pattern, described above. These
experiments were repeated 24 times, 8 times for to each of the victim client location.
We observed higher average correlation between server-to-exit and entry to victim client
trafﬁc, compared to non-victim clients’ trafﬁc. We were able to correctly identify the
victim client in 14 out of the 24 trials (success rate 58.3%). There were three false pos-
itives, where the correlation of the server-to-exit trafﬁc was higher to a non-victim than

to the victim. The remaining seven were false negatives, where the correlation coefﬁ-
cient was not statistically signiﬁcant (< 0.2). The false negatives were primarily a result
of the few sample points obtained during the experiment, which were further reduced
by our ﬂow alignment method. This loss of information decreases the correlation of the
server-to-exit and entry-to-victim client trafﬁc.
5 Limitations
Our attack is very accurate in an in-lab set-up with symmetric network paths and capac-
ities (having low congestion and no uncontrolled disturbances). However, in tests with
public Tor relays, the overall correlation between server-to-exit and entry-to-victim traf-
ﬁc is decreased due to congestion and Tor’s trafﬁc scheduling, which distort the injected
trafﬁc pattern. In experiments involving data from the institutional Cisco router, such
effects were quite pronounced. Moreover, the were fewer sample intervals compared
to the data obtained from Linux NetFlow packages. This was due to ﬂow aggregation,
and lead to to ﬂow records with unequal lengths, not evenly spaced. To counter such
effects, we devised an approximation strategy, described in Section 3. Such approxima-
tions decrease the overall correlation of server-to-exit with entry-to-victim trafﬁc, since
the process eliminates data points from ﬂow intervals that cannot be correctly rectiﬁed.
This resulted in false positives in our measurements. Although not very precise, these
results are indicative of the capabilities of more powerful adversaries. A powerful ad-
versary could launch a sybil attack [9] by running many high-bandwidth Tor nodes to
attract a large fraction of Tor trafﬁc. Such relay operators, equipped with ﬂow capture
tools, would not require access to network routers for ﬂow records.
6 Conclusion
We have demonstrated the practical feasibility of carrying out trafﬁc analysis attacks
using statistical correlation of trafﬁc measurements obtained from NetFlow, a popular
256

network monitoring framework installed in various router platforms. Our work veriﬁes
the results of previous simulation results for trafﬁc de-anonymization using NetFlow
data [18]. We focused on practically evaluating such an attack to identify the source of
anonymous trafﬁc. We relied on correlation to identify the source of anonymous trafﬁc
amidst various ﬂows. In a controlled lab environment, free from external network con-
gestion, our attack was 100% accurate in identifying the targeted client. In experiments
involving data from public Tor relays, our approach identiﬁed correctly the source of
anonymous trafﬁc in 81.6% of the cases, with a false positive rate of 5.5%. Currently,
we are working on methods for defending against such attacks, using ideas related to
selective dummy trafﬁc transmissions schemes [19].
