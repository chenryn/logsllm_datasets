The results are typical, and include balance and transaction data. The power of BlockChair is the ability to search 
Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Bitcoin SV, Dash, Dogecoin and Groestlcoin. We will use 
the following URLs for each, replacing "xxx” with the target address.
This service focuses on one feature. It notifies you if others have reported a target virtual currency address as 
associated with malicious activity7. This often provides valuable information about an investigation. Consider an 
actual report located at the following URL.
Our next stop is a service that provides a bit more analysis about the suspect account. We immediately learn 
that it is a suspect ransomware account, and that the address has appeared on various news outlet websites. 
Furthermore, we see transaction IP addresses, which are likely behind VPNs. Overall, I use Blockchain for 
transaction details and Bitcoin Who's Who to get a better idea of why I might care about the account.
This website allows search of a Bitcoin address and displays the number of transactions, total amount of Bitcoin 
received (S), final balance, and a complete transaction history. We can track every incoming and outgoing 
payment. This will almost never be associated with any real names, but it provides a great level of detail about 
the account. We learn that this account has received 19.12688736 Bitcoin worth S 287,391.14 USD at the time 
of this writing.

In simplest terms, virtual currencies can be spent for goods and services without connection to a person or bank 
account It has no physical presence, and is mostly used online as digital payment. Bitcoin is virtual currency. A 
bitcoin address, which is an identifier you use to send bitcoins to another person, appears similar to a long string 
of random characters. In our demo, we will use 12t9YDPgwueZ9NyMgw519p7AA8isjr6SMw, which is the real 
address that was used to collect ransom from victims after malicious software had taken over their computers. 
Think of a Bitcoin address as an email address. That address stores their "virtual" money.
This service is very similar to Blockchain, but I find it has better representation across multiple virtual currencies. 
Additionally, we can query each currency via URL, which will assist in our tools. Let's start with a search of a 
Bitcoin address at the following URL.

Validation: The following URL provides an indication whether a provided address is valid or 
great first search to make sure you have a proper address.
Sent: This URL displays the total amount of Bitcoin sent by a specific address. It is important to note that this 
amount is also presented in "Satoshi" (0.00000001 Bitcoin).
The previous utilities examined an individual virtual currency account, such as a Bitcoin address.'Many people 
possess numerous addresses and store them all within a virtual wallet. This is where Wallet Explorer can be 
extremely beneficial. While researching one of our target Bitcoin addresses within this free service, the results 
identified a wallet of "00037fd441" which contained the target address. Clicking on the link to this wallet revealed 
multiple new transactions from additional Bitcoin addresses previously unknown. This step is vital in order to 
track all transactions associated with your suspect. The following URLs search an address and a wallet.
In order to create the custom search tool presented at the end of this chapter, I needed a very simple way to 
query virtual currency’ addresses for various tasks. Many of the websites which allow searching of Bitcoin 
addresses do not permit submission via URL. Instead, 1 will take advantage of various Application Programming 
Interfaces (z\PIs) which allow us to query’ directly and receive a text-only result. The following URLs are used 
within the tool, with an explanation of each. Each display of "xxx" is where the virtual currency address or 
amount would be inserted.
Received: This URL displays the total amount of Bitcoin received by a specific address. It is important to note 
that this amount will be in "Satoshi". A Satoshi is equal to 0.00000001 Bitcoin. Put another way, one bitcoin 
contains 100 million Satoshis. This unit of measurement is popular because a single Bitcoin is currently worth 
approximately $19,000. The Satoshi is a more precise number. In a moment, we will convert Satoshi to USD.
Summary: This URL displays a brief summary of a Bitcoin address including total received, total sent, balance, 
total transactions, first transaction, and most recent transaction. Replace "xxx" with your target address.

First seen: This Blockchain query displays the date which a virtual currency' address transaction was first seen 
within the public blockchain. Note that this result will appear in Unix time format, but our tools will allow you 
to convert this to traditional time format. Replace "xxx" with your virtual currency' address.
Now that you understand the details available about a virtual currency address, let's run through a typical 
investigation. Assume you are investigating a Bitcoin address of 1 EzwoHtiXB4iFwedPr49iywjZn2nnekhoj. It 
was used as pan of an extortion email, and you have been tasked to find any information about the address. 
First you input the address into the search tool. The following information would be presented after each of the 
options.
USD > Satoshi Value: The following URL will always display the current Satoshi value of any amount of USD. 
This price fluctuates hourly. Replace "xxx" with your value of USD.

numbers to identify association with online scams. It can also be used to query virtual currency addresses. 
Searching "lFVuyuSN41aa3JN9sn8qkuD2PmaMEMHHnc" reveals email addresses, IP addresses, and 
locations associated with an online extortion suspect.
