### Problem description
Loading steps dynamically seems to not be possible.  
I have an array of simple steps and I'm just trying to display them but when I
do it I get an error
In Stepper.js?724d:109
> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'props' of null
### Link to minimal working code that reproduces the issue
My code is something as simple as that:
    var steps = [{stepLabel: 'a'}, {stepLabel: 'b'}];
      {steps.map(step => {
          {step.stepLabel}
        ;
      })}
    ;
It looks liks I cannot put the smallest amount of JS between and , even and
console.log() would make it fail. I have no idea why this would happen ...
### Versions
"material-ui": "^0.18.2",  
"react": "^15.5.4",
Thanks a lot for your help ...
