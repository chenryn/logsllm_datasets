 **Describe the bug**
This glTF uses the variants extension, though I doubt this is the cause of its
textures being scrambled in USDZ, since that doesn't do much to three's scene
graph.
**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
  1. Go to https://modelviewer.dev/examples/scenegraph/#variants on iOS Safari
  2. Click on the AR button
  3. Quick Look opens after auto-generating the USDZ, but the textures are random and greyscale.
_**Code**_
This is part of model-viewer
**Expected behavior**
The models renders more or less as it does on the web, and should reflect
either of the chosen variants.
