Assistant: This log chunk shows the system running tasks 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 in stage 22.0, assigning tasks 912, 918, and 919, and reading broadcast variable 31. It also shows the memory store storing blocks broadcast_31_piece0 and broadcast_31, and the cache manager computing partitions rdd_30_0, rdd_30_4, rdd_30_3, rdd_30_2, and rdd_30_1. Finally, it shows the block manager finding blocks rdd_2_0, rdd_2_4, rdd_2_3, and rdd_2_2 locally.
