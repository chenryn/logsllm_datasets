I ran into this when implementing Back button transition in a router. Because
the transition is inside a browser `popstate` event, it gets batched with the
low pri update, and the pending state doesn't appear.
I had to do this to work around it but it's unfortunate. We might want to fix
this by treating pending state as special. Or maybe a warning â€” but then we
need a first-class official API for opting into user blocking pri.
