User: I need to make a bot who can automatically add a cron job for itself,but I don't think I could access the cron.yaml file on GAE server.What can I do with this?
Assistant: It's true that a lot of dev environments don't give you access to the cron.yaml files, however, you can run a Python script locally that communicates with your deployed program, edits your local copy of cron.yaml and pushes up the changes.
