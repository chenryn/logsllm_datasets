Challenge http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-give-your-
javascript-slot-machine-some-stylish-images has an issue. Please describe how
to reproduce it, and include links to screenshots if possible.  
After adding:
       $($('.slot')[0]).html('');
        $($('.slot')[1]).html('');
        $($('.slot')[2]).html('');
only the final 3 tests. pass. The first test fails even though I have used the
provided code three times.
