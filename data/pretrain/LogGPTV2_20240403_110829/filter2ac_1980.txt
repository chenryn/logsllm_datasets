**ATT&CK ID:** T1559.002  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Dynamic Data Exchange

Adversaries may exploit the Windows Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) protocol to execute arbitrary commands. DDE is a client-server protocol designed for both one-time and continuous inter-process communication (IPC) between applications. Once a DDE link is established, applications can autonomously exchange various types of transactions, including:

- **Strings**: Simple text data.
- **Warm Data Links**: Notifications when a specific data item changes.
- **Hot Data Links**: Immediate duplication of changes to a data item.
- **Requests for Command Execution**: Instructions to execute specific commands.

This capability allows attackers to leverage DDE to initiate unauthorized actions or gain control over the target system.
