User: I've inherited various task with moderately confusing batch files. I intend to rewrite them as Python scripts, if only so I can thoroughly see what they're doing, as can my successors.
I honestly don't see why anyone would have more than a startling simple (under five line, do a, b, c, d, e in order) batch file: proper logic deserves a more modern approach, surely?  But am I missing something? Is there a real advantage in still using such an approach? If so, what is it?   
Clarified in response to comments: Windows .bat fils, that check for existence of files in certain places and move them around and then invoke other programs based on what was found. I guess what I'm really asking is, is it normal good practice to still create batch files for this sort of thing, or is it more usual to follow a different approach?
Assistant: I'm not sure this is the correct place for such question but anyway..

Batch files (with very slight reservations) can be ran on every windows machine since windows NT (where the cmd.exe was introduced). This is especially valuable when you have to deal with old machines running windows xp or 2003.(still) The most portable language between the windows machines.
Batch files are very fast. Especially compared to powershell.
Easier to call. While wsh by default is called with wscript.exe (which output is in a cumbersome pop up windows) and powershell need a policy parameters and by default double clicks won't work on powershell scripts.

I event don't think you need python except if you are aiming multi-platform scripting (i.e. macs or linux machines). Windows comes with other powerful enough languages like vbscript and javascript (since XP) . C# , Visual Basic and jscript.net (since Vista) and powershell (since windows 7). And even when you want multi platform scripts .net based languages are highly considerable as Miscrosoft already offers an official support for .net for unix. Though the best choices probably are powershell and c# as visual basic and jscript.net are in maintenance mode , though the jscript options (jscript and jscript.net) are based on javascript which in the moment is the more popular language and investing in it will worth it.
By the way all languages coming packed with the  Windows by default can be elegantly wrapped into batch file.
