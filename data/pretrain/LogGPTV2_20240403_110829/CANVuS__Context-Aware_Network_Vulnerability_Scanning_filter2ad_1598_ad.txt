# CANVuS: Context-Aware Network Vulnerability Scanning

## 1. Introduction
This paper presents a context-aware architecture for enterprise security applications, specifically designed to provide information about network states and their changes. The proposed system, CANVuS (Context-Aware Network Vulnerability Scanning), leverages this architecture to trigger scanning operations based on network activities. We evaluate the system in a college-level academic network, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing detection latency and resource consumption.

## 3. Risk Mitigation and Analysis
In this section, we detail our efforts to minimize the impact on users, services, hosts, and network infrastructure during our experiments. Active probing involves using network resources and interacting with product services. To mitigate potential risks, we developed a research plan in consultation with the Computer Science and Engineering Departmental Computing Office, the College of Engineering Computer Added Engineering Network, and the University of Michigan Office of Information and Infrastructure Assurance. The plan includes:

1. **Bandwidth Limitation**: We limited the bandwidth available to our scanning devices to minimize the effect of network scanning.
2. **Whitelisting and Opt-Out**: We implemented a whitelisting feature and broadcasted an opt-out message to all departmental organizations before the experiment.
3. **Safe Check Policies**: We applied only those policies consistent with the Nessus “Safe Check Only” label.

We also ensured that sensitive information such as MAC and IP addresses were protected according to IRB guidelines. This included physical and digital security measures, such as locked offices, restricted access, encryption, and regular updates of security software.

## 4. Limitations and Future Work
Our initial evaluation shows promise but highlights several limitations:

1. **Accuracy of Evaluation**: The use of network vulnerability scanning results as the sole ground truth limits the accuracy of host configuration changes. Future work will involve developing a host agent to collect fine-grained information on local changes.
2. **Trigger Events**: Currently, the most effective events are generated by the DHCP monitor. Future work will explore new triggers and types of network evidence for host changes.

## 5. Conclusion
In this paper, we proposed a context-aware architecture and CANVuS, a system built upon this architecture. Our experimental evaluation in a college-level academic network demonstrated that CANVuS outperforms existing models in terms of low detection latency and reduced network resource consumption.
