Under some circumstances, `trace` returns a scalar on a 3-D masked array, even
though it should return a vector. It appears to be related to the mask, as
illustrated below.
    In [326]: Z = numpy.ma.empty((2, 2, 2), dtype="<f4")
    In [327]: trace(Z, 1, 2)
    Out[327]: 
    masked_array(data = [ 0.  0.],
                 mask = False,
           fill_value = 1e+20)
    In [328]: Z.mask = zeros_like(Z)
    In [329]: trace(Z, 1, 2)
    Out[329]: 0.0    # oops, that should have been [0., 0.]
    In [330]: trace(Z.data, 1, 2)
    Out[330]: array([ 0.,  0.], dtype=float32)
