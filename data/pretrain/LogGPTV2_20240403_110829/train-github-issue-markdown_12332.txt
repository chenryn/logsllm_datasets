### Bug report
**Bug summary**
Some colorbar labels are printed twice when I use a colorbar with LogNorm and
small ranges of numbers after setting the ticks manually with set_ticks().
See figure below: By setting the minor_thresholds to something low, the double
ticklabel at 20000 disappears, so it could have something to do with the minor
formatter in LogFormatterSciNotation?
I think it could be related to other issues that have been posted: #12488
#12503
**Code for reproduction**
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import matplotlib.colors as mcolors
    import matplotlib.ticker as ticker
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    pcm = ax.imshow([[10000, 25000]], norm=mcolors.LogNorm())
    cb = fig.colorbar(pcm)
    # cb.formatter.minor_thresholds = [0,0] # deactivates minor ticks labels?
    cb.formatter = ticker.EngFormatter()
    cb.set_ticks([10000,20000,25000])
**Actual outcome**

**Expected outcome**
There should be no double ticks.
