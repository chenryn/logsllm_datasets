In Visual Studio, you can press Ctrl+F5 to launch the application without a
debugger attached, which i befinicial for performance reasons. For VS Code
this would be very helpful, because you don't always want to actually debug a
file or actually cannot because there is no debug adapter extension out there
yet. Currently, you have to define a "launch" task, which cannot get a
keyboard shortcut. Having "Launch without debugging" would be much more
semantically correct.
  * Introduce a new action in command palette "Launch without debuggin" with keyboard shortcut Ctrl+F5
  * If the currently selected configuration has `type` set, send the debug adapter a `launchRequest` with the additional argument `debug: false`
  * Make the debug setting `type` optional. If a configuration does not have a `type`, it can only be launched without debugging: 
    * If `runtimeExecutable` is set, spawn the runtime executable (java, bash, ...) with the `runtimeArguments`, `program` and `args`.  
Otherwise spawn `program` with `args` directly (like a .exe or .bat)
    * `program` should be allowed to drop the file extension (java needs this for example)
    * Put stdout on the debug console and send input on the debug console to stdin
    * If `externalConsole` is true, run the script in an external console
    * Support `preLaunchTask`
Examples:
    {
      "name": "Run currently open script",
      "runtimeExecutable": "bash",
      "program": "${file}"
    }
    {
      "name": "Launch",
      "runtimeExecutable": "java",
      "program": "${workspaceRoot}/MyClass",
      "preLaunchTask": "compile"
    }
