User: How to implement server-side HTTP load balancing by configuring Nginx?
Assistant: To implement server-side HTTP load balancing by configuring Nginx, you can follow the steps below: 1. Install Nginx: Use the installation command suitable for your operating system to install. 2. Configure Nginx: Open the Nginx configuration file (usually `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`), and add the following content: ``` http { upstream my_app { server server1.example.com; server server2.example. com; } server { listen 80; server_name my_domain.com; location / { proxy_pass http://my_app; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; } } } ``` Among them, `upstream` specifies The address and port number of the backend server, `server` defines the service port number and domain name of Nginx itself, `location` specifies which backend server to forward the request to, `proxy_set_header` defines the header information that needs to be added when forwarding ( optional). 3. Save the modification and restart Nginx: save the configuration file and execute `service nginx restart` to restart the Nginx server to make the configuration take effect. 4. Test load balancing: access the address and port number of the Nginx server, and verify whether Nginx can successfully forward the request to the backend server. If successful, it means that load balancing has been achieved. It should be noted that in practical applications, more detailed and in-depth configuration and adjustment of Nginx may be required to meet specific performance and security requirements.
