##### System information (version)
  * OpenCV => 4.2.0
  * Operating System / Platform => Windows 10 64 Bit
  * Compiler => MSVC++ 14.24
##### Detailed description
The static variables named "__initialization_mutex" are never freed, causing
(false) memory leak detections.  
For example one such variable is in modules/core/src/system.cpp .
IPP also produces a lot of false positives since it leaves a lot of TLS
objects on the heap without cleaning them up upon unloading the DLL (exiting
the application). But IPP can be disabled.
I have not yet checked if this issue is also present on linux or not.
##### Steps to reproduce
I used link to check for memory leaks, linked OpenCV (compiled from source) as
a DLL to my application.
There is a solution in link that gets rid of this issue in certain cases.
