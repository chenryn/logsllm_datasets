### Title: Defeating a Secure Element with Multiple Laser Fault Injections

In 2020, we conducted an evaluation of the Microchip ATECC508A Secure Memory circuit and identified a vulnerability that allowed an attacker to read a secret data slot using Single Laser Fault Injection. This finding was presented at Black Hat USA. Following this, the ATECC508A was deprecated and replaced by the ATECC608A, which was marketed as more secure. 

We present a new attack method that enables the retrieval of the same secret data slot from the ATECC608A. This time, the attack utilizes a double Laser Fault Injection to bypass two security tests during a single command execution. The approach is different from our previous work and involves a more complex attack path.

Our research was conducted using a black-box approach. We detailed the process of identifying the attack path, leveraging power trace analysis and up to four faults in a single command during an intermediate testing phase. Based on our findings, we hypothesized the firmware implementation to explain how the security measures and a double-check countermeasure were bypassed. This work highlights the enhanced security features of the ATECC608A and the increased effort required to compromise the chip.

The study was initially aimed at analyzing a specific hardware wallet that uses this secure element. However, given the widespread use of the ATECC608A in IoT applications, it is possible that other attack vectors exploiting similar fault effects may exist.
