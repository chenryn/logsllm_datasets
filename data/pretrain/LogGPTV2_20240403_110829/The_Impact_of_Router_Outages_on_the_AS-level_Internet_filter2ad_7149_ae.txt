the set of BGP update messages received at the Routeviews looking
glass to determine the activity for these IPv4 prefixes during the
time period of the IPv6 router restart. Our algorithm links IPv4
prefixes to the router most likely to originate the prefix. Thus, if
the router suffers an outage and represents an IPv4 single point of
failure, we expect to lose reachability to the prefix.
We examined two distinct time periods for each interface in
our analysis: one within our inferred outage window, and a second
period, of the same duration, two days prior to the outage. Using the
daily RIB IPv4 snapshots, we determined the number of Routeviews
peers advertising the prefix, and then replayed the BGP update
messages to maintain state over the number of peers concurrently
advertising or not advertising the IPv4 prefix. To determine the
extent of the outage, we used the ratio of the maximum number
of peers that withdrew the route to the number of peers that had
been advertising the route.
Figure 13a shows the distribution of router outages as a function
of ratio of affected IPv4 Routeviews peers, before and during the
inferred outage. 47% of the within-window outages resulted in no
peers withdrawing the IPv4 route, suggesting that these prefixes
were robust to the failure of single routers. However, we observed
a distinct correlation between withdrawals during the outage as
compared to outside the outage. Similarly, Figure 13b shows dis-
tinctly more update churn for the IPv4 prefixes during the outage
window. While none of the IPv4 prefixes we examined were fully
withdrawn outside the outage, approximately 10% of the outages
resulted in more than 90% of the peers withdrawing the prefix.

5.7 Impact of Outages on Application Services
A consequence of an outage is that both the customers of the af-
fected provider, as well as the application-layer services they pro-
vide to the Internet, become unreachable. While there do not exist
good IPv6 address census data due to the sheer size of the address
space, we make use of the daily IPv4 censys.io scanning data [18]
as an indicator of the outage impact for a single point of failure.
In particular, we examined those IPv4 prefixes tied to an inferred
IPv6 router reboot (§5.6) where at least 90% of the Routeviews
peers withdrew that prefix in the inferred outage time window. For
each IPv4 address in an April 2017 censys.io daily scan, we used
a Routeviews BGP table to find the longest matching prefix and
determine whether the host belonged to a prefix that experienced
an outage. For the IPv4 prefixes that experienced an outage in our
sample, we found 39,107 active hosts in the censys data, 25,592
hosts listening on port 80 (HTTP), 16,321 hosts listening on port
443 (HTTPS), 7383 SMTP listeners, 5127 IMAP servers, 11,277 SSH
servers, and 7922 responsive DNS servers. While this methodology
yields only a rough approximation of an outage impact, it shows
that non-trivial numbers of applications were affected by the single
points of failure we discovered.
5.8 Impact of Outages on the Data Plane
To better understand how our work complements end-host data-
plane probing approaches, we sought to quantify the relationship
between outages, data-plane reachability, and BGP activity. We
identified responsive IPv6 targets within each of the 41K globally
routed prefixes by sending ICMP6 echo requests to the first 16 ad-
dresses within each prefix. From this simple survey, we discovered
at least one active target within 11,003 prefixes (∼27% of the 41K
total prefixes in May 2017). We then probed a single address in each
of the 11,003 prefixes at 30-second intervals between May 23-30
2017. To counter the effect of single probe loss, we sent a second
probe if there was no response to the first probe.
Then, for each router outage inferred during the week of probing,
we examined the impact, if any, on data-plane responsiveness. Our
binary metric of correlation between end-host data-plane probing
and inferred router outages determined if: (1) the loss of active
probes overlapped with the inferred router outage window; (2)
the router was responsive before and after; and (3) the responsive
address was not an alias of the router that rebooted, so that we were
probing an end-host reachable via the router, rather than another
interface on the router itself.
We first examined the set of router outages over the May 23-30
2017 window inferred via IPID sequence discontinuities that iden-
tified a single point of failure, i.e. those outages that resulted in a
BGP withdrawal. While we might expect a loss of data-plane reach-
ability due to the BGP withdrawal, the withdrawn prefix may be a
more specific announcement that belonged to a larger aggregate (a
“covering prefix”) that was not withdrawn.
In total, there were 36 distinct router outage / complete BGP
withdrawal pairs that we correlated with loss of active probes; 13 of
these had a covering prefix that was not simultaneously withdrawn.
While our sample size is small, we found no evidence that a covering
IPv6 prefix provided data-plane reachability when a more specific
prefix was withdrawn due to a router outage.
Second, we examined inferred router outages during our data-
plane probing window that were not clear single points of failure;
that is, the outage did not result in a complete BGP withdrawal for
the associated prefixes. We found 138 router outages that correlated
with a loss of active probes to unique prefixes, despite the prefix
remaining in the global BGP table. Thus, while our technique did
not deem these routers to be BGP-level single points of failure, our
probing identified them as data-plane single points of failure.
Our result that nearly four times more router outages were cor-
related with active probe loss than with complete BGP withdrawal
is congruent with prior work. Using Hubble [26], Katz-Bassett et al.
reported that the majority of reachability problems they found were
uncovered with active probes, with reachability problems often not
correlated with BGP activity for the prefix. Similarly, Trinocular [39]
finds that control-plane measurements underestimate outages.
However, by tying network outages to individual router outages,
our technique complements existing control-plane and data-plane
methods – whereas data-plane probing can identify reachability
issues, it cannot accurately identify the root-cause of the outage.
In future work, we plan to more closely couple data-plane probing
with our router outage detection framework.
6 CONCLUSION
The resilience of the Internet to individual points of failure has
been argued in the literature for nearly two decades, and there
has been significant work to undermine the theory that the Inter-
net has high-degree hubs crucial to overall network connected-
ness [1, 12, 31, 49]. However, there has been a dearth of empirical
data allowing researchers and policymakers to understand AS-level
reliability cognizant of the underlying router-level interconnection.
In this paper, we take a first empirical step towards understanding
the resilience of the Internet to individual router outages through
the opportunistic correlation of router outages with BGP routing
information. In our data, collected from a survey of 149,560 IPv6
routers responsive to our method, we inferred that 59,175 (40%) had
an outage during our study. Only 2,385 routers (4.0%) were corre-
lated with complete withdrawals involving 3,396 prefixes where the
routers appeared in traceroute paths towards the prefixes. Further,
2,374 (70%) of the withdrawn prefixes were not covered by a less
specific prefix, so only 1,726 routers (2.9%) of those that restarted
were BGP-level single points of failure for at least one network, and
routers that were single points of failures were over-represented in
stub ASes. We were also able to correlate IPv6 router outages with
IPv4 control plane instability, reinforcing that while our study was
applied to IPv6 routing out of methodological need, failures were
present in IPv4 as well.
Our method and data also has a network security impact, and
therefore also ethical considerations [37]. During the course of
our Internet-wide measurement campaign over 2.5 years, which
we conducted at a low rate, we received a single query from a
network operator about our measurements, suggesting that the
method could also be used by an attacker in a stealthy manner. The
security implications of predictable fragment identification values
are well known [21], as they provide, for example, a side-channel
that allows an adversary to infer the number of systems behind
a middle-box [4], and the packet sending rate and open ports of

an end-host [2]. To improve privacy, some Linux kernels use a
hash-based algorithm to select an initial identifier value, and then
assign identifier values sequentially from the initial value. However,
Knockel et al. were able to leverage an artifact of the implementation
to infer if two third-party computers were communicating [28]. In
this work, we also show the fragment identifier side channel can
be used to infer the impact that the failure of a single router has on
the Internet’s routing system.
Our method and data has utility beyond our initial study of
network resilience. Our method and data could also be used, for
example, to study the deployment of BGP configurations that limit
routing convergence, data plane performance during routing con-
vergence, study the evolution of network resilience, develop ac-
tionable information for national CERT bodies to assist network
operators to deploy more resilient routing, and to cross-validate
other outage detection methods. In order to balance the research
utility of our dataset with the possibility it can be used to do harm
until operators have deployed routers without the side channel,
we will release our raw data to researchers via a suitable legal
framework [42].
