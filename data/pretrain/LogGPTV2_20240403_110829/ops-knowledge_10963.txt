User: I've installed virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper on Windows using easy_install. But mkvirtualenv is missing. I tried to search on my machine but I couldn't find it. I don't know how to solve it. Do you have any idea?
Assistant: In windows we need to use virtualenv not mkvirtualenv while creating virtual environments
