User: I haven't seen anything about Windows compatibility -- is this on the way or currently available somewhere if I put forth some effort? (I have a Mac and an Ubuntu box but the Windows machine is the one with the discrete graphics card that I currently use with theano).
Assistant: Another way to run it on Windows is to install for example Vmware (a free version if you are not using it commercially), install Ubuntu Linux into that and then install TensorFlow using the Linux instructions. That is what I have been doing, it works well.
