User: Is there any reason why Nose wouldn't be able to find tests in Ubuntu 9.04? 
I'm using nose 0.11.1 with python 2.5.4.
I can run tests only if I explicitly specify the filename. 
If I don't specify the filename it just says, 0 tests. 
The same project runs tests fine on my Mac, so I'm quite stumped!
Assistant: The other thing which always gets me with nose is that it won't run tests in executable files. I'm not exactly sure why that would make a difference across Mac/Ubuntu, but it's worth a shot.
Make sure that the scripts didn't somehow get chmod +x'd on the Macâ€¦ And if they did, fix them with chmod -x $(find tests/ -name '*.py').
