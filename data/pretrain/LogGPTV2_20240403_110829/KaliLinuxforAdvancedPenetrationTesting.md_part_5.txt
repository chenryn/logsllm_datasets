Starting with Kali Linux
For example, to create an image of a specific size from the Google search page, enter
the following from a command-line prompt:
..cutycapt --url=http://www.google.com --out=google.png --min-width=300
--min-heightheight=250.
On execution, an image of the size specified in the previous command is displayed,
as shown in the following screenshot:
CutyCapt is especially useful when demonstrating the presence of web-based
vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting.
Static images can be very useful, however, a video of an exploit that compromises
a target network and shows the actions of an attacker as they compromise sensitive
data is a very compelling tool. The instanbul screen recorder creates a video of an
"exploit in progress," which allows the exploit to be replayed for training purposes,
or to demonstrate the vulnerability to the client.
Summary
In this chapter, we examined Kali, a collection of tools widely used by legitimate
penetration testers and hackers to assess the security of data systems and networks.
We emphasized Kali as a virtual machine, allowing both the host operating system
and the VM guest to support testing.

Chapter 1
Kali is a repository of tools, and one of the challenges in using it is ensuring that the
tools are up-to-date. We reviewed the Debian packet management system, and how
updates could be initiated from both the command line and from GUI applications.
Most importantly, we learned how to customize Kali to increase the security of our
tools and the data that they collect. We are working to achieve the goal of making
tools support our process, instead of the other way around!
In the next chapter, we will learn how to effectively use Open Source Intelligence
(OSINT) to identify the vulnerable attack surfaces of our target and create
customized username:password lists to facilitate social engineering attacks and
other exploits.

Identifying the
Target – Passive
Reconnaissance
Reconnaissance is the first step of the kill chain when conducting a penetration
test or an attack against a network or server target. An attacker will typically
dedicate up to seventy-five percent of the overall work effort for a penetration test
to reconnaissance, as it is this phase that allows the target to be defined, mapped,
and explored for the vulnerabilities that will eventually lead to exploitation.
There are two types of reconnaissance: passive reconnaissance, and
active reconnaissance.
Generally, passive reconnaissance is concerned with analyzing information that is
openly available, usually from the target itself or public sources online. On accessing
this information, the tester or attacker does not interact with the target in an unusual
manner—requests and activities will not be logged, or will not be traced directly to
the tester. Therefore, passive reconnaissance is conducted first to minimize the direct
contact that may signal an impending attack or to identify the attacker.
In this chapter, you will learn the principles and practices of passive reconnaissance,
which include the following:
• Basic principles of reconnaissance
• Open-source intelligence (OSINT)
• DNS reconnaissance and route mapping, including issues with IPv4 and IPv6
• Obtaining user information
• Profiling users for password lists
Active reconnaissance, which involves direct interaction with the target, will be
covered in Chapter 3, Active Reconnaissance and Vulnerability Scanning.
Identifying the Target – Passive Reconnaissance
Basic principles of reconnaissance
Reconnaissance, or recon, is the first step of the kill chain when conducting a
penetration test or attack against a data target. This is conducted in before the
actual test or attack of a target network. The findings will give a direction to where
additional reconnaissance may be required, or the vulnerabilities to attack during
the exploitation phase.
Reconnaissance activities are segmented on a gradient of interactivity with the target
network or device.
Passive
reconnaissance
(no direct Active
interaction) reconnaissance

detection
Normal interaction
Passive reconnaissance does not involve direct interaction with the target network.
The attacker's source IP address and activities are not logged (for example, a Google
search for the target's e-mail addresses). It is difficult, if not impossible, for the target
to differentiate passive reconnaissance from normal business activities.
In general, passive reconnaissance focuses on the business and regulatory
environment, the company, and the employees. Information of this type is available
on the Internet or other public sources, and is sometimes referred to as open source
intelligence, or OSINT.
• Passive reconnaissance also involves the normal interactions that occur when
an attacker interacts with the target in an expected manner. For example,
an attacker will log on to the corporate website, view various pages, and
download documents for further study. These interactions are expected user
activities, and are rarely detected as a prelude to an attack on the target.
• Active reconnaissance involves direct queries or other interactions (for
example, port scanning of the target network) that can trigger system alarms
or allow the target to capture the attacker's IP address and activities. This
information could be used to identify and arrest an attacker, or during legal
proceedings. Because active reconnaissance requires additional techniques
for the tester to remain undetected, it will be covered in Chapter 3, Active
Reconnaissance and Vulnerability Scanning.
[ 44 ]
Chapter 2
Penetration testers or attackers generally follow a process of structured information
gathering, moving from a broad scope (the business and regulatory environments) to
the very specific (user account data).
To be effective, testers should know exactly what they are looking for and how the
data will be used before collection starts. Using passive reconnaissance and limiting
the amount of data collected minimizes the risks of being detected by the target.
Open Source intelligence
Generally, the first step in a penetration test or an attack is the collection of
open-source intelligence, or OSINT.
OSINT is information collected from public sources, particularly the Internet. The
amount of available information is considerable—most intelligence and military
organizations are actively engaged in OSINT activities to collect information about
their targets, and to guard against data leakage about them.
The process of OSINT collection and analysis is complex and could constitute its own
book; therefore, we will cover only the essential highlights.
The US Army manual ATP 2-22.9 (http://www.fas.org/
irp/doddir/army/atp2-22-9.pdf) and the NATO OSINT
manual (http://information-retrieval.info/docs/
NATO-OSINT.html) are both available online, and provide
excellent technical reviews of how to gather and assess OSINT.
The information that is targeted for collection is dependent on the initial goal of
the penetration test. For example, if testers wants to access financial data, they will
need the names and biographical information of relevant employees (CFO, accounts
receivable and payable, and so on), their usernames, and passwords. If the route of
an attack involves social engineering, they may supplement this information with
details that give credibility to the requests for information.
OSINT gathering usually starts with a review of the target's official online presence
(website, blogs, social-media pages, and third-party data repositories such as public
financial records). Information of interest includes the following:
• Geographical locations of offices, especially remote or satellite offices that
share corporate information but may lack stringent security controls.
• An overview of the parent company and any subsidiary companies,
especially any new companies acquired by mergers or acquisitions
(these companies are frequently not as secure as the parent company).
[ 45 ]
Identifying the Target – Passive Reconnaissance
• Employee names and contact information, especially names, e-mail
addresses, and phone numbers.
• Clues about the corporate culture and language; this will facilitate social
engineering attacks.
• Business partners or vendors that may connect into the target's network.
• Technologies in use. For example, if the target issues a press release about
adopting new devices or software, the attacker will review the vendor's
website for bug reports, known or suspected vulnerabilities, and details that
could be used to facilitate various attacks.
Other online information sources used by the attacker may include the following:
• Search engines such as Google and Bing. Historically, these searches
are highly manual; the attacker enters search terms that are specific for
information of interest; for example, the search term "company name"
+ password filetype:xls may identify an Excel spreadsheet that contains
employee passwords. These search terms are referred to as google dorks
(www.exploit-db.com/google-dorks/). Most search engines have since
released APIs to facilitate automated lookups, making tools such as Maltego
particularly effective.
One of the most effective search engines is Yandex (www.yandex.
com). This Russian language search engine, the fourth-largest
search engine in the world, allows users to search in several
languages, including English. It also supports very granular search
expressions, making it more effective than Google when searching
for specific information.
Other online sources that should be searched include:
• Government, financial, or other regulatory sites that provide information
on mergers and acquisitions, names of key persons, and supporting data
• Usenet newsgroups, particularly postings from the target's employees
looking for help with particular technologies
• LinkedIn, Jigsaw, and other websites that provide employee information
• Job search websites, especially ones for technical positions that provide
a list of the technologies and services that must be supported by a
successful applicant
• Historic or cached content, retrieved by search engines (cache:url in Google,
or WayBack Machine at www.archive.org)
[ 46 ]
Chapter 2
• Country- and language-specific social and business related sites (refer to
http://searchenginecolossus.com)
• Sites that aggregate and compare results from multiple search engines,
such as Zuula (www.zuula.com)
• Corporate and employee blogs, as well as personal blogs of key employees
• Social networks (LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter)
• Sites that provide lookups of DNS, route, and server information, especially,
DNSstuff (www.dnsstuff.com), ServerSniff (www.serversniff.net),
Netcraft (www.netcraft.com), and myIPneighbors.com
• Shodan (www.shodanHQ.com), sometimes referred to as the "hacker's Google";
Shodan lists Internet-accessible devices and allows the tester to search for
devices with known vulnerabilities
• Password dumpsites (pastebin, search using site:pastebin.com
"targetURL")
Managing findings can be difficult; however, Kali comes with KeepNote, which
supports the rapid import and management of different types of data.
DNS reconnaissance and route mapping
Once a tester has identified the targets that have an online presence and contain
items of interest, the next step is to identify the IP addresses and routes to the target.
DNS reconnaissance is concerned with identifying who owns a particular domain or
series of IP addresses (whois-type information), the DNS information defining the
actual domain names and IP addresses assigned to the target, and the route between
the penetration tester or the attacker and the final target.
This information gathering is semi-active—some of the information is available from
freely available open sources, while other information is available from third parties
such as DNS registrars. Although the registrar may collect IP addresses and data
concerning requests made by the attacker, it is rarely provided to the end target. The
information that could be directly monitored by the target, such as DNS server logs,
is almost never reviewed or retained.
Because the information needed can be queried using a defined systematic and
methodical approach, its collection can be automated.
[ 47 ]
Identifying the Target – Passive Reconnaissance
Note that DNS information may contain stale or incorrect entries.
To minimize inaccurate information, query different source servers
and use different tools to cross-validate results. Review results, and
manually verify any suspect findings. Use a script to automate the
collection of this information. The script should create a folder for
the penetration test, and then a series of folders for each application
being run. After the script executes each command, pipe the results
directly to the specific holding folder.
WHOIS
The first step in researching the IP address space is to identify the addresses that
are assigned to the target site. This is usually accomplished by using the whois
command, which allows people to query databases that store information on the
registered users of an Internet resource, such as a domain name or IP address.
Depending on the database that is queried, the response to a whois request will
provide names, physical addresses, phone numbers, and e-mail addresses (useful in
facilitating social engineering attacks), as well as IP addresses and DNS server names.
An attacker can use information from a whois query to:
• Support a social engineering attack against the location or persons identified
in the query
• Identify a location for a physical attack
• Identify phone numbers that can be used for a war dialing attack, or to
conduct a social engineering attack
• Conduct recursive searches to locate other domains hosted on the same
server as the target or operated by the same user; if they are insecure, an
attacker can exploit them to gain administrative access to the server, and then
compromise the target server
• In cases where the domain is due to expire, an attacker can attempt to seize
the domain, and create a look-alike website to compromise visitors who
think they are on the original website
• An attacker will use the authoritative DNS servers, which are the records for
lookups of that domain, to facilitate DNS reconnaissance
[ 48 ]
Chapter 2
Note that there is an increase in the usage of third parties to shield this data, and
some domains, such as .gov and .mil, may not be accessible to the public domain.
Requests to these domains are usually logged. There are several online lists available
that describe domains and IP addresses assigned for government use; most tools
accept options for "no contact" addresses, and government domains should be
entered into these fields to avoid the wrong type of attention!
The easiest way to issue a whois query is from the command line. The following
screenshot shows the whois command run against the domain of Digital Defence:
The returned whois record contains geographical information, names, and contact
information—all of which can be used to facilitate a social engineering attack.
There are several websites that automate whois lookup enquiries, and attackers can
use these sites to insert a step between the target and themselves; however, the site
doing the lookup may log the requester's IP address.
[ 49 ]
Identifying the Target – Passive Reconnaissance
DNS reconnaissance
The Domain Name System (DNS), is a distributed database that resolves names
(www.digitaldefence.ca) to its IP addresses (192.150.2.140).
Attackers use the DNS information in the following ways:
• Using brute-force attacks, allows attackers to identify new domain names
associated with the target.
• If the DNS server is configured to permit a zone transfer to any requester,
it will provide hostnames and IP addresses of Internet-accessible systems,
making it easier to identify potential targets. If the target does not segregate
public (external) DNS information from private (internal) DNS information,
a zone transfer might disclose the hostnames and IP addresses of internal
devices. (Note that most IDS and IPS systems will trigger an alarm if a zone
transfer request is triggered).
• Finding services that may be vulnerable (for example, FTP) or are otherwise
interesting (remote administration panels and remote access).
• Finding misconfigured and/or unpatched servers
(dbase.test.target.com).
• Service records (SRV), provide information on service, transport, port,
and order of importance for services. This can allow an attacker to deduce
the software.
• DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) and Sender Policy Framework (SPF)
records are used to control spam e-mails. If these records are identified, the
attacker knows that:
° They are more security conscious than most organizations.
° This may impact phishing and other social engineering attacks.
Both Windows and Unix support basic command-line tools such as nslookup, and
Unix systems support additional command-line options such as dig. Unfortunately,
these commands usually interrogate one server at a time, and require interactive
responses to be effective.
Kali features several tools designed to iteratively query DNS information for a
particular target. The selected tool must accommodate the Internet Protocol version
that is used for communications with the target—IPv4 or IPv6.
[ 50 ]
Chapter 2
IPv4
The IP, or Internet Protocol address, is a unique number used to identify devices
that are connected to a private network or the public Internet. Today, the Internet
is largely based on version 4, IPv4. Kali includes several tools to facilitate DNS
reconnaissance, as given in the following table:
Application Description
dnsenum, dnsmap, and dnsrecon These are comprehensive DNS scanners—DNS
record enumeration (A, MX, TXT, SOA, wildcard,
and so on), subdomain brute-force attacks, Google
lookup, reverse lookup, zone transfer, and zone
walking. dsnrecon is usually the first choice—it is
highly reliable, results are well parsed, and data can
be directly imported into the Metasploit Framework.
dnstracer This determines where a given Domain Name System
gets its information from, and follows the chain of
DNS servers back to the servers which know the data.
dnswalk This DNS debugger checks specified domains for
internal consistency and accuracy.
fierce This locates non-contiguous IP space and hostnames
against specified domains by attempting zone
transfers, and then attempting brute-force attacks to
gain DNS information.
During testing, most investigators run fierce to confirm that all possible targets
have been identified, and then run at least two comprehensive tools (for example,
dnsenum and dnsrecon) to generate the maximum amount of data and provide a
degree of cross validation.
[ 51 ]
Identifying the Target – Passive Reconnaissance
In the following screenshot, dnsrecon is used to generate a standard DNS record
search, and a search that is specific for SRV records. An excerpt of the results is
shown for each case.
DNSrecon allows the penetration tester to obtain the SOA record, name servers (NS),
mail exchanger (MX) hosts, servers sending e-mails using Sender Policy Framework
(SPF), and the IP address ranges in use.
