### Challenges in Measuring and Circumventing Censorship

**Measurement and Circumvention Risks:**
It is challenging to accurately determine the actual degree of risk when using measurement or circumvention tools [40, 41, 60]. One of the primary reasons for not using Tor for such measurements is that its design makes it difficult to detect censorship and provide adaptive circumvention. Since Tor is designed to provide anonymity, it always routes traffic through relays, making it hard to measure censorship on the direct path.

**C-Saw's Design Flexibility:**
C-Saw’s design allows for the seamless integration of new circumvention methods into its framework. This flexibility would not be possible if a specific circumvention mechanism were used. C-Saw uses Tor as one of its circumvention strategies, but Tor exits can be easily blacklisted [51], which raises concerns about C-Saw’s robustness. While using Tor bridges and pluggable transports makes it more challenging to block Tor, there is an ongoing arms race between Tor and some censors (e.g., China) [53]. C-Saw aims to leverage Tor’s successes in achieving blocking resistance with features like pluggable transports. However, it is important to note that censors in many countries are not as resourceful or motivated as those in countries like China and Iran. Additionally, Tor is just one of the many circumvention mechanisms that C-Saw relies on, and new approaches can be readily incorporated into its framework.

**Fingerprintability of C-Saw:**
If a censor shuts down a particular circumvention mechanism X, and C-Saw users migrate to mechanism Y, this behavior may make it easier for censors to fingerprint users who switch to a specific anonymous circumvention mechanism. The effectiveness of such fingerprinting depends on several factors, including the number of C-Saw users within an Autonomous System (AS), the circumvention strategies being used, and the type of blocked URLs being accessed (since blocking mechanisms may differ across URLs). Similarly, C-Saw’s use of redundant requests may also appear as a fingerprintable behavior. However, C-Saw uses redundant requests selectively (only when a URL has not been measured before or randomly for blocked URLs) and may use different circumvention mechanisms depending on the blocked content. In some cases, the source IP address visible to the censors may also be different (e.g., in the case of Tor and VPNs). Moreover, as redundant requests are commonly used by WAN optimizers, they may be challenging to fingerprint. A detailed analysis of such fingerprinting approaches is left for future work.

**C-Saw and Mobile Users:**
C-Saw can adapt to mobile users. If a user moves and their AS changes, C-Saw will fetch censorship measurements for the new AS from the global database. As measurements from the global database are fetched periodically, C-Saw will automatically adapt to user mobility.

**Data Usage:**
C-Saw uses redundant requests, which increase data usage and may be a concern in developing countries. To limit this increase, C-Saw uses redundancy only selectively (e.g., when a URL has not been measured before or randomly with probability \( p \) for blocked URLs). This significantly limits additional data usage in common scenarios. To further optimize data usage, the value of \( p \) can be lowered in developing regions, albeit at the cost of reduced resilience to false reports.

**Server-Based Filtering:**
If a server or content provider filters content in a geographical region (e.g., Google filters content in some countries based on government requests [7]), C-Saw can (a) access such censored content using one of its circumvention services and (b) detect such types of filtering.

**Non-Web Filtering:**
In this work, we focused on web censorship. In the future, it would be interesting to explore non-web filtering (e.g., messaging, voice, and video applications, such as WhatsApp, and UDP blocking).

### Related Work

**Censorship Measurement Tools:**
Existing tools for measuring censorship, such as OONI [37] and Centinel [27], aim to recruit users who are willing to host a measurement device or install measurement software. However, widespread deployment remains a challenge due to a lack of user incentives. CensMon [50] used PlanetLab nodes but was deployed only for a short time. Iris [49] does not require diverse vantage points but only measures DNS manipulation. Augur [48] uses TCP/IP side channels but focuses on identifying IP-based disruptions only. Encore [26] uses cross-origin requests to measure censorship but cannot determine the type of blocking.

**Circumvention Tools:**
Flash proxy [35] creates many short-lived proxies to outpace the censor’s ability to block them. Infranet [34] conceals traffic that would otherwise be blocked within seemingly normal HTTP traffic. Telex [61] allows tagging normal TLS streams cryptographically so that an ISP-level router may redirect it to a blocked destination. Unlike Infranet, unblocked websites do not need to participate in or know about circumvention. Lantern [10] and uProxy [19] leverage trust relationships for choosing proxy servers for circumvention. Alkasir [23] uses a proxy server located in a non-censored region to provide circumvention and requires manual reports from users to enable circumvention. LASTor [22] improves the latency performance of Tor. Astoria [46] provides a higher level of security against AS-level attackers than Tor. A survey of existing circumvention techniques can be found in [20].

### Conclusion

Collecting continuous and reliable censorship measurements is challenging due to a lack of incentives for user participation. At the same time, circumvention systems lack insights about censor capabilities, which continually evolve over time, leading to inefficient or ineffective circumvention. We developed C-Saw, a system that addresses these challenges by combining censorship measurements with circumvention. Our evaluation shows that C-Saw is effective at reporting measurements and leveraging fine-grained knowledge about filtering mechanisms to improve user-perceived performance.
