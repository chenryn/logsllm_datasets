risks, it is challenging to ascertain the actual degree of risk
when using measurement or circumvention tools [40, 41, 60].
Why not use Tor for measurements? Tor’s design makes
it challenging to detect censorship and provide adaptive cir-
cumvention. As Tor is geared towards providing anonymity,
it always uses relays for accessing every URL making it hard
to measure censorship on the direct path. C-Saw’s design
allows new circumvention methods to be seamlessly inte-
grated into its framework. This would not be possible if a
design with a specific circumvention mechanism is used.
Robustness of C-Saw. C-Saw uses Tor as one possible cir-
cumvention strategy. However, Tor exits can be easily black-
listed [51], which raises concerns about C-Saw’s robustness.
While using Tor bridges and pluggable transports makes it
more challenging to block Tor, there is an arms race between
Tor and some censors (e.g., China) [53]. Our hope is that
C-Saw can ride on Tor’s successes in achieving blocking re-
sistance with features like pluggable transports. However,
it is useful to highlight that censors in several countries are
neither as resourceful nor motivated as the censors in coun-
tries like China and Iran. Second, Tor is just one of the many
circumvention mechanisms that C-Saw relies on. New cir-
cumvention approaches can be readily incorporated into its
framework.
Fingerprintability of C-Saw. Suppose a censor shuts down
circumvention mechanism X, and as a result, C-Saw users
migrate to mechanism Y. This flocking behavior may make
it easier for censors to fingerprint users who switch to a par-
ticular (anonymous) circumvention mechanism. The finger-
printing effectiveness, however, would depend on a number
of factors including the number of C-Saw users within an
544

AS, circumvention strategies being used11, and the type of
blocked URLs being accessed (because blocking mechanisms
may differ across URLs). Similarly, C-Saw’s use of redundant
requests may also seem like a fingerprintable behavior. How-
ever, C-Saw uses redundant requests selectively (i.e., only
when a URL has not been measured before or randomly for
blocked URLs) and may use different circumvention mecha-
nisms depending on the blocked content. In some cases, the
source IP address visible to the censors may also be differ-
ent (e.g., in case of Tor and VPNs). Moreover, as redundant
requests are commonly used by WAN optimizers, they may
be challenging to fingerprint. However, we leave a detailed
analysis of such fingerprinting approaches to future work.
Can C-Saw work with mobile users? If a user moves and
its AS changes, C-Saw will fetch censorship measurements
for the new AS from the global_DB. As measurements from
the global_DB are fetched periodically, C-Saw will automati-
cally adapt to user mobility.
C-Saw’s data usage. C-Saw uses redundant requests, which
increase data usage and may be a concern in developing
countries. To limit this increase, C-Saw uses redundancy
only selectively (e.g., when a URL has not been measured
before or randomly with probability p for blocked URLs).
This significantly limits additional data usage in the common
case. To further optimize data usage, the value of p can be
lowered in developing regions albeit at the cost of reduced
resilience to false reports.
Server-based filtering. If a server or content provider fil-
ters content in a geographical region (e.g., Google filters con-
tent in some countries based on government requests [7]),
C-Saw can (a) access such censored content using one of its
circumvention services and (b) detect such type of filtering.
Non-web filtering. In this work, we focused on web censor-
ship. In the future, it would be interesting to explore non-web
filtering (e.g., messaging, voice, and video applications, such
as Whatsapp, and UDP blocking).
9 RELATED WORK
Censorship measurement tools. Existing tools for mea-
suring censorship, such as OONI [37] and Centinel [27], try
to recruit users who are either willing to host a measure-
ment device or install a measurement software. However,
their widespread deployment remains a challenge due to lack
of user incentives. CensMon [50] used PlanetLab nodes but
was deployed only for a short time. Iris [49] does not require
diverse vantage points but only measures DNS manipulation.
Augur [48] uses TCP/IP side channels but focuses on iden-
tifying IP-based disruptions only. Encore uses cross-origin

to each relay’s perceived bandwidth [56].

requests to measure censorship but cannot determine the
type of blocking [26].
Circumvention tools. Flash proxy [35] creates many short-
lived proxies to outpace the censor’s ability to block them.
Infranet [34] is designed to conceal traffic that would other-
wise be blocked within seemingly normal HTTP traffic. Telex
[61] allows tagging normal TLS streams cryptographically
so that an ISP-level router may redirect it to a blocked des-
tination. Unlike Infranet, unblocked Web sites do not need
to participate in or know about circumvention. Lantern [10]
and uProxy [19] leverage trust relationships for choosing
proxy servers for circumvention. Alkasir [23] uses a proxy
server located in a non-censored region to provide circum-
vention and requires manual reports from users to enable
circumvention. LASTor [22] improves the latency perfor-
mance of Tor. Astoria [46] provides higher level of security
against AS-level attackers than Tor. A survey of existing
circumvention techniques can be found in [20].
10 CONCLUSION
Collecting continuous and reliable censorship measurements
is challenging due to lack of incentives for user participation.
At the same time, circumvention systems lack insights about
censor capabilities, which continually evolve over time, lead-
ing to inefficient or ineffective circumvention. We develop
C-Saw, a system that addresses these challenges by com-
bining censorship measurements with circumvention. Our
evaluation shows that C-Saw is effective at reporting mea-
surements and leveraging fine-grained knowledge about fil-
tering mechanisms to improve user-perceived performance.
