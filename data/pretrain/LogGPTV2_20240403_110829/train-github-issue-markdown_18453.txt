The HTML entity `&bull;` is being incorrectly parsed as `ÔÇó` in the output. Below is an excerpt from a test that should have passed, but failed due to this issue:

- **Expected Output:**
  ```plaintext
  'phpBB &bull; Free and Open Source Forum Software'
  ```

- **Actual Output:**
  ```plaintext
  'phpBB ÔÇó Free and Open Source Forum Software'
  ```

**Error Message:**
```
Failed asserting that two strings are equal.
