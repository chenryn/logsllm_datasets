Question: A penetration tester is assessing the security of a web server that hosts multiple web applications. The tester suspects that the web server is vulnerable to Host header injection attacks. Which of the following could potentially occur if the Host header is not properly validated by the web server? (Choose two)
"A": "The web server may serve content from a different virtual host, leading to internal application exposure.",
"B": "A Host header injection will always cause the server to crash, leading to a denial of service.",
"C": "The tester may cause the application to generate incorrect password reset links, potentially leading to account compromise.",
"D": "Valid Host header values are cached by the server and reused for subsequent requests, preventing Host header attacks."
