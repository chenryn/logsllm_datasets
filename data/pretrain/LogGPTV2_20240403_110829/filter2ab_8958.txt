### Title: Investigating Malware Using Memory Forensics - A Practical Approach (Black Hat Asia 2019)

**Abstract:**

The frequency of cyber attacks is undeniably on the rise, targeting a wide range of sectors including government, military, and both public and private organizations. Many of these attacks leverage malicious software (malware) to achieve financial theft, espionage, intellectual property theft, and political objectives. Malware often employs sophisticated techniques to execute its code while evading detection by security products.

As adversaries become more advanced in their methods, it is crucial for cybersecurity professionals to effectively detect and respond to such intrusions. This presentation focuses on the practical application of memory forensics, demonstrating how this technique can be used to detect, investigate, and understand the capabilities of malicious software. 

Additionally, the presentation will include several demonstrations that highlight the various tricks and techniques employed by malware, including some of its stealth and evasive capabilities. By the end of the session, attendees will have a deeper understanding of how memory forensics can be a powerful tool in the fight against advanced malware threats.
