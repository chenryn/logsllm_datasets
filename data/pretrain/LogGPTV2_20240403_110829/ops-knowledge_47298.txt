User: The df command displays the amount of disk space occupied by mounted or unmounted file systems, the amount of used and available space, and how much of the file system's total capacity has been used. 
Linux has df command in the following location /bin whereas in Solaris in the following location /usr/gnu/bin... 
If suppose /usr/bin is set in the PATH, then programmatically, i need to ensure that one of required df (as mentioned above) is invoked instead of the user defined df.
One solution to this problem is using uname to get the OS and set the df accordingly... Is there any other better way to do this where i am not dependent on the OS. 
Note: the default df and gnu df give different outputs hence i need to invoke the required df command on two different OS programmatically (the paths are mentioned above)
DID NOT FIND ANY SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM 
Used the alternative solution that i had provided in the question itself!
Assistant: The only solution top this problem seems using uname to get the OS and
 set the df accordingly... same as what i had stated in the problem!!!
