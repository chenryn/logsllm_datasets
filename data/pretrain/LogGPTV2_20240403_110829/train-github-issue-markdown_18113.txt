### Additional Information
I've encountered this problem both on Ubuntu 18.04 and Centos 8. It works both
on Windows 10 and macOS 10.15.7.
The printer I'm using is a Brother QL-800 (thermal label printer, 62mm x
100mm). The OSs have the correct drivers, and the printer is set to default.
I've tried setting the device name manually on the print options
unsuccessfully.
**What's the problem?**
The `win.webContents.print` does not work on linux when configured on silent
mode.
I've replicated the problem on two other printers (another QL-800, and a
QL-700)
**Why do I think that this is an electron bug?**
  * When I set silent to false, it works
  * Printing test prints directly on the printer works fine
  * Print to pdf works
  * `window.print` works
  * behaviour changes between linus and windows/macos
On previous versions (11.1.1), the printer inconsistently printed blank pages,
which threw me off even more than this.
Please do tell me if I'm doing anything wrong, or if you can't replicate the
problem.
Thank you in advance.
