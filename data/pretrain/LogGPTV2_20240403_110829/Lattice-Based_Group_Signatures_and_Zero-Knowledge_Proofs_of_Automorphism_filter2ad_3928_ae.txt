The standard technique of sending commitments \( w_{j,1}, w_2' \) and only opening them in the event of a non-abort ensures that the interactive protocol is zero-knowledge. Define the following probabilistic polynomial-time (PPT) algorithm \( S(A, t_1, \ldots, t_\tau, B_1, \ldots, B_j) \):

1. Sample \( c \leftarrow C \).
2. Sample \( z_j \leftarrow D_k^j \).
3. Set \( w_{j,1} = A_{j,1}z_j - t_{j,1}c \).
4. Output \( (w_{1,1}, \ldots, w_{\tau,1}, w_2, c, z_1, \ldots, z_\tau) \).
5. Set \( w_2 = \sum B_j A_{j,2} z_j - c \sum B_j t_{j,2} \).

It is evident that \( z_1, \ldots, z_\tau \) verify with overwhelming probability. In the actual protocol, when no abort occurs, the distribution of \( z_j \) is within a statistical distance of \( 2^{-100} \) from \( D_k^j \). Since \( w_{1,1}, \ldots, w_{\tau,1}, w_2 \) are completely determined by \( A_1, \ldots, A_\tau, B_1, B_\tau, t_1, \ldots, t_\tau, z_1, \ldots, z_\tau, c \), the distribution of \( (w_{1,1}, \ldots, w_{\tau,1}, w_2, c, z_1, \ldots, z_\tau) \) output by \( S \) is within \( 2^{-100} \) of the distribution of these variables in the actual protocol.

**Special Soundness:**
Let \( (w_{1,1}, \ldots, w_{\tau,1}, w_2, c, z_1, \ldots, z_\tau) \) and \( (w_{1,1}, \ldots, w_{\tau,1}, w_2, c', z_1', \ldots, z_\tau') \) be two accepting transcripts with \( c \neq c' \). We will prove that there exist messages \( \bar{m}_j, j \in [\tau] \) such that \( (z_j - z_j', \bar{m}_j, c - c') \) is a valid opening of \( t_j \), and \( \sum B_j \bar{m}_j = 0 \). By computing the difference of the verification equations for both transcripts, we obtain:

\[
\sum A_{j,1} \bar{z}_j = t_1 \bar{c}
\]

Since \( \bar{c} \) has an inverse in \( R_{q^2} \), we can define \( \bar{m}_j \in R_{l_j}^{q^2} \) such that \( \bar{c} t_{j,2} = A_{j,2} \bar{z}_j + \bar{c} \bar{m}_j \). Replacing \( \bar{c} t_{j,2} \) in equation 15, we have:

\[
\sum B_j A_{j,2} \bar{z}_j = \bar{c} \sum B_j t_{j,2}
\]
\[
\sum B_j \bar{m}_j = 0
\]

In conclusion, we have extracted \( \bar{z}_1, \ldots, \bar{z}_\tau, \bar{m}_1, \ldots, \bar{m}_\tau, \) and \( \bar{c} \) such that:

\[
A \bar{z}_j + \bar{c} \bar{m}_j = \bar{c} t_j
\]
with \( \| \bar{z}_j \| \leq 2B_j' \) and \( \sum B_j \bar{m}_j = 0 \).

### 4.2 Proof of Automorphism Stability

We present a proof of knowledge that a commitment opens to a message \( m \in R_l^{q^2} \) invariant under a certain set of automorphisms \( (\sigma_j)_{j \in S \subset Z_m^*} \), where the ring considered is \( R = Z[X] / \Phi_m \). As shown in Section 3.1, as a special case, we can show that \( m \in Z_l^{q^2} \) by proving it is invariant under a well-chosen automorphism when \( m \) is prime or \( m = 2b p^j \) for \( b \in \{0, 1\}, j > 0 \), and \( p \) an odd prime, or by proving it is invariant under two automorphisms (specifically \( \sigma^{-1} \) and \( \sigma^5 \)) when \( m \) is a power of two. We can also prove that \( m \) belongs to certain sets of size \( q^i \) for specific integers \( i \) by proving it is invariant under a well-chosen set of automorphisms, as detailed in Section 3.2.

We consider a commitment \( t \in R_n^{q_1} \times R_l^{q_2} \) with \( A \in R_{n \times k}^{q_1} \times R_{l \times k}^{q_2} \). We will use the proof of Figure 1 with the following parameters:

- \( \tau := |S| + 1 \)
- \( x := |S| \)
- \( A_1 = A \)
- For \( j \in S \), \( A_{j+1} := \sigma_j^{-1}(A) \)
- \( t_1 := t \)
- For \( j \in S \), \( t_{j+1} := \sigma_j^{-1}(t) \)
- \( B_1 := 1 \)
- For \( j \in S \), \( B_{j+1} := \sigma_j^{-1}(B) \)
- For \( j \in S \), \( B_j' = B_{\text{aut}} \)

**Corollary 4.2:**
Let \( r \leftarrow S_k \) and \( \xi \geq 11 \kappa \sqrt{k |S| d} \) and \( B_{\text{aut}} \geq \sqrt{2d k \xi} \). Let \( S \) be a set of automorphisms of size \( |S| \). Let \( t = \text{Com}(m; r) \) with \( B_{\text{com}} \geq 2 B_{\text{aut}} \). If \( B_{\text{com}} \geq 2 B_{\text{aut}} \), then the protocol of Figure 1 instantiated with the parameters set as above achieves the following properties:

- **Correctness:** The prover aborts with probability at most \( \frac{2}{3} + 2^{-100} \), and if he does not abort, the verifier accepts with overwhelming probability.
- **Honest-Verifier Zero-Knowledge:** Non-aborting transcripts with an honest verifier can be simulated with statistically indistinguishable distribution.
- **Special Soundness:** Given two accepting transcripts, one can extract a valid opening \( \bar{z}, \bar{m}, \bar{c} \) of \( t \) such that \( \| \bar{z} \| \leq 2 B_{\text{aut}} \) and \( \forall j \in S, \bar{m} = \sigma_j(\bar{m}) \).

**Proof:**
Correctness and zero-knowledge follow directly from Lemma 4.1. By the special soundness of Lemma 4.1, given two accepting transcripts, one can extract valid openings \( \bar{z}_j, \bar{m}_j, \bar{c} \) of \( t_j \) for \( j \in [\tau] \) such that \( \| \bar{z}_j \| \leq 2 B_j' \) and \( \sum B_j \bar{m}_j = 0 \). Using how the matrices \( A_j, j \in [\tau] \) are defined, we obtain:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ \bar{m}_{j+1} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ \bar{m}_1 \end{pmatrix} + \bar{c} \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ \sigma_j(\bar{m}_{j+1}) \end{pmatrix}, \forall j \in S
\]

By applying \( \sigma_j \) to the second equation, we can rewrite it as:

\[
\sigma_j(\bar{c}) t = \sigma_j(A) \sigma_j(\bar{z}_{j+1}) + \sigma_j(\bar{c}) \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ \sigma_j(\bar{m}_{j+1}) \end{pmatrix}, \forall j \in S
\]

Since \( \| \sigma_j(\bar{z}_{j+1}) \| \leq 2 B_{\text{aut}} \leq B_{\text{com}} \), by the binding property of the commitment scheme, all these openings open to the same message, i.e.,

\[
\bar{m}_1 = \sigma_j(\bar{m}_{j+1}), \forall j \in S
\]

Furthermore, we know that \( \sum B_j \bar{m}_j = 0 \), which by construction of the \( B_j \) corresponds to:

\[
\bar{m}_1 = \bar{m}_{j+1}, \forall j \in S
\]

From these two equalities, we have:

\[
\bar{m}_1 = \sigma_j(\bar{m}_1), \forall j \in S
\]

In conclusion, we have extracted \( \bar{z}_1, \bar{m}_1, \) and \( \bar{c} \) such that:

\[
\bar{c} t = A \bar{z}_1 + \bar{c} \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ \bar{m}_1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

with \( \| \bar{z}_1 \| \leq 2 B_{\text{aut}} \) and \( \bar{m}_1 = \sigma_j(\bar{m}_1), \forall j \in S \).

### 5 Group Signatures

We first recall the definitions and security model of group signatures. A group signature scheme consists of a tuple of four algorithms \( (GSetup, \text{Sign}, \text{Verify}, \text{Open}) \):

- **GSetup(1^\lambda, 1^N):** Takes as input the security parameter \( \lambda \) and the maximum number of identities \( N \). Outputs the group public key \( gpk \), the group manager secret key \( gmsk \), and the secret keys of each identity \( sk_1, \ldots, sk_N \).
- **Sign(ski, M):** Takes as input a user secret key \( ski \) and a message \( M \in \{0, 1\}^* \). Outputs a signature \( z \) of \( M \).
- **Verify(gpk, M, z):** Takes as input the group public key \( gpk \), a message \( M \), and a signature \( z \). Outputs 1 if \( z \) is a valid signature of \( M \) and 0 otherwise.
- **Open(gmsk, M, z):** Takes as input the group manager secret key \( gmsk \), a message \( M \), and a valid signature \( z \) of \( M \). Outputs an identity \( id \in [N] \) or \( \bot \).

For correctness, we want that for any \( (gpk, gmsk, sk_1, \ldots, sk_N) \leftarrow GSetup(1^\lambda) \), any \( j \in [N] \), \( M \in \{0, 1\}^* \), and \( z \leftarrow \text{Sign}(gpk, sk_j, M) \), with overwhelming probability:

\[
\text{Verify}(gpk, M, z) = 1, \text{ and } \text{Open}(gpk, gmsk, M, z) = j
\]

The security of the group signature is captured by two notions: anonymity and traceability. Informally, for anonymity, we consider a PPT adversary \( A \) who has access to all the signing keys \( sk_1, \ldots, sk_N \) but not the manager secret key \( gmsk \). \( A \) chooses a message \( M \) and two identities \( i_0 \) and \( i_1 \), and his goal is to distinguish between signatures of \( M \) under these identities. There are multiple flavors of anonymity depending on whether \( A \) can access an opening oracle (full anonymity) or not (weak anonymity). Intuitively, full anonymity will be achieved when the PKE used in the opening is CCA-secure, while weak anonymity corresponds to a CPA-secure encryption scheme. In this paper, for simplicity, we present a weakly anonymous group signature but mention that the verifiable encryption scheme we use [LN17] can achieve CCA security, which would increase the signature size by approximately 20%.

For full-traceability, the adversary \( A \) has access to the signing keys \( (sk_i)_{i \in S} \) for any arbitrary set \( S \subset [N] \) (possibly \( S = [N] \)) as well as the manager secret key \( gmsk \). His goal is to produce a valid signature \( z \) of some message \( M \) (i.e., which passes verification) such that either \( \text{Open}(gpk, gmsk, M, z) = j \notin S \) or \( \text{Open}(gpk, gmsk, M, z) = \bot \). Full-traceability captures the notion that all signatures, even when computed by a collusion of users and the group manager, should trace to a member of the forging coalition. Note that full-traceability implies unforgeability, since the forgery game is a special case of the full-traceability game with \( S = \emptyset \). Here, the condition \( \text{Open}(gpk, gmsk, M, z) = j \notin S = \emptyset \) or \( \text{Open}(gpk, gmsk, M, z) = \bot \) is vacuous.

### 5.1 The Scheme

The group signature we present in this section will be for fixed parameters as per Table 5, for which the signatures will be of size 581 KB, as described in Section 8. Specifically, we consider the power-of-two cyclotomic ring \( R = Z[X] / (X^{4096} + 1) \) and identity set \( [N] = Z_{q^2} \). This entails that user identities are exactly the elements \( x \in R_{q^2} \) that are left invariant under the automorphisms \( \sigma^{-1}: X \to X^{-1} = -X^{d-1} \) and \( \sigma^5: X \to X^5 \). We also use commitments that rely on R-LWE and R-SIS (which can be seen as specific instances of the module variant of the corresponding problems for modules of dimension 1). Using other cyclotomic rings can result in smaller signatures, especially since for some of them only one automorphism is needed to prove that elements belong to \( Z_{q^2} \). Using higher-dimension commitments that rely on the module variants of LWE and SIS would allow for more fine-tuned parameters. We have chosen the parameters in this section for easier presentation and because they allow for simpler implementations.

We will first present in this section a group signature scheme without opening, and show in Section 5.2 how to add an opening.

\[
\text{Id} = Z_{q^2}
\]

Let \( \delta = \sqrt{\cdot} \).
