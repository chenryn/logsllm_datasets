Let S(A, t1, . . . , tτ , B1, . . . , Bj) be the following PPT algorithm:
• Sample c ← C
• Sample zj ← Dkj
• Set wj,1 = Aj,1zj − tj,1c
• Output (w1,1, . . . , wτ,1, w2, c, z1, . . . , zτ )
• Set w2 =(cid:80) BjAj,2zj − c(cid:80) Bjtj,2

It is clear that z1, . . . , zτ veriﬁes with overwhelming probability. We know that in the real pro-
tocol when no abort occurs the distribution of zj is within statistical distance 2−100 of Dkj

w1,1, . . . , wτ,1, w2 are completely determined by A1, . . . , Aτ , B1, Bτ , t1, . . . , tτ , z1, . . . , . . . , zτ , c,
the distribution of (w1,1, . . . , wτ,1, w2, c, z1, . . . , zτ ) output by S is within 2−100 of the distribu-
tion of these variables in the actual protocol.

4.2 Proof of automorphism stability
We present in this section a proof of knowledge that a commitment opens to a message m ∈ Rl
q2
that is invariant under a certain set of automorphisms (σj)j∈S⊂Z∗
m, where the ring we consider is
R = Z [X] /Φm. As shown in section 3.1 as a special case we can show that m ∈ Zl
q2 by proving that
it is invariant under a well chosen automorphism when m is prime or m = 2bpj for b ∈ {0, 1}, j > 0
and p an odd prime, or by proving that it is invariant under two automorphisms (speciﬁcally σ−1
and σ5) when m is a power of two. We can also prove that m belongs to certain sets of size qli for
speciﬁc integers i by proving it is invariant under a well-chosen set of automorphism, section 3.2
shows for which i this is possible and which set S ⊂ Z∗
m should be used. We now show how to use
the previous proof to prove that for a set of automorphisms σj, j ∈ S a commitment t opens to
a message m such that ∀j ∈ S, σj(m) = m. For ease of presentation we will rewrite S as the set
{1, . . . ,|S|} (while the previous section used S as the set of the powers corresponding to the Galois
automorphisms).

Corollary 4.2. Let r $← Sk
σj(m) = m for all j in S. Let ξ ≥ 11κ(cid:112)k |S| d and Baut ≥ √

2dkξ. If Bcom ≥ 2Baut, then the
protocol of Figure 1 instantiated with the parameters set as above achieves the following properties:
– Correctness: The prover aborts with probability at most 2/3 + 2−100, and if he does not abort
the veriﬁer accepts with overwhelming probability.
– Honest-Veriﬁer Zero-Knowledge: Non-aborting transcripts with an honest veriﬁer can be sim-

Proof. Correctness and zero-knowledge follow directly from Lemma 4.1.
By the special soundness of Lemma 4.1 we have that given two accepting transcripts one can extract
valid openings ¯zj, ¯mj, ¯c of tj for j ∈ [τ ] such that (cid:107)¯zj(cid:107) ≤ 2B(cid:48)

¯m1 = σj( ¯mj+1),∀j ∈ S.

5 Group Signatures
¯m1
We ﬁrst recall the deﬁnitions and security model of group signatures. A group signature scheme
consists of a tuple of four algorithms (GSetup, Sign, Verify, Open):
– GSetup(1λ, 1N ):Takes as input the security parameter λ as well as the maximum number of
identities N . Outputs the group public key gpk, the group manager secret key gmsk, and the
secret keys of each identity sk1, . . . , skN .
– Sign(ski, M ) : Takes as input a user secret key ski and a message M ∈ {0, 1}∗. Outputs a
signature z of M .
– Verify(gpk, M, z) : Takes as input the group public key gpk, a message M , and a signature z.
– Open(gmsk, M, z) : Takes as input the group manager secret key gmsk, a message M , and a
Outputs 1 if z is a valid signature of M and 0 otherwise.
valid signature z of M . Outputs an identity id ∈ [N ] or ⊥.
For correctness, we want that for any (gpk, gmsk, sk1, . . . , skn) ← GSetup(1λ), any j ∈ [N ],
M ∈ {0, 1}∗, and z ← Sign(gpk, skj, M ), with overwhelming probability:
Verify(gpk, M, z) = 1, and Open(gpk, gmsk, M, z) = j
The security of the group signature is captured by two notions: anonymity and traceability, we
describe these notions informally, for a more formal approach see [BMW03]. For anonymity we
consider a PPT adversary A who has access to all the signing keys sk1, . . . , skN but not the
manager secret key gmsk. A chooses a message M and two identities i0 and i1, his goal is to
distinguish between signatures of M under these identities. There are multiple ﬂavors of anonymity
depending on whether A can access an opening oracle (full anonymity) or not (weak anonymity),
intuitively full anonymity will be achieved when the PKE used in the opening is CCA-secure while

Table 5. Concrete parameters for our Group signature
weak anonymity corresponds to a CPA-secure encryption scheme. In this paper, for simplicity, we
present a weakly anonymous group signature but mention that the veriﬁable encryption scheme we
use [LN17] can achieve CCA security, which would end up somewhat increasing the signature size
(by ≈ 20% in our case). For the full-traceability notion, the adversary A has access to the signing
keys (ski)i∈S for any arbitrary set S ⊂ [N ] (possible S = [N ]) as well as the manager secret key
gmsk, his goal is to produce a valid signature z of some message M (i.e. which passes veriﬁcation)
such that either Open(gpk, gmsk, M, z) = j /∈ S or Open(gpk, gmsk, M, z) = ⊥. Full-traceability
captures the notion that all signatures, even when computed by a collusion of users and the group
manager, should trace to a member of the forging coalition. Note that full-traceability implies
unforgeability, since the forgery game is a special case of the full-traceability game with S = ∅.
Here the condition Open(gpk, gmsk, M, z) = j /∈ S = ∅ or Open(gpk, gmsk, M, z) = ⊥ is vacuous.
5.1 The Scheme
The group signature we present in this section will be for ﬁxed parameters as per Table 5, for
which the signatures will be of size 581 KB, as described in Section 8. In particular we consider the
power-of-two cyclotomic ring R = Z [X] /X 4096 + 1, and identity set [N ] = Zq2. This entails that
user identities are exactly the elements x ∈ Rq2 that are left invariant under the automorphisms
σ−1 : X → X−1 = −X d−1 and σ5 : X → X 5. We also use commitments that rely on R-LWE
21
and R-SIS (which can be seen as speciﬁc instances of the module variant of the corresponding
problems for modules of dimension 1). Using other cyclotomic rings can result in smaller signatures
(especially since for some of them only one automorphism is needed to prove that elements belong
to Zq2), and using higher dimension commitments that rely on the module variants of LW E and
SIS would allow for more ﬁne-tuned parameters. We have chosen the parameters in this section as
such for easier presentation and because they allow for simpler implementations.
We will ﬁrst present in this section a group signature scheme without opening, and show in sec-
tion 5.2 how to add an opening.
