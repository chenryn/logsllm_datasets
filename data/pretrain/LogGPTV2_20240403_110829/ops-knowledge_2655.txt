Question: "A security team is reviewing the intrusion detection measures of their company's software. They argue that using specification-based detection will be highly effective because it reduces the false positive rate to near-zero levels. What might be a valid counterargument to consider in this context?"
 "A": "False positives are entirely eliminated in specification-based detection, hence no counterargument is needed."
 "B": "The low false positive rate is contingent on the specifications being very well-defined, which may not be feasible for all aspects of the application."
 "C": "Specification-based detection will automatically update the specifications as the software evolves, leading to potential security lapses."
 "D": "Manually written specifications are less time-consuming than maintaining a database of known attack signatures."
Answer: B
