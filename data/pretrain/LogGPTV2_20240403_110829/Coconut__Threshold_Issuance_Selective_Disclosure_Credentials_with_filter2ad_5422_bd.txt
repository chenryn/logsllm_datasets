TABLE II: Communication complexity and transaction size for the Coconut
credentials scheme when signing one public and one private attribute (see
Figure 2 of Section III).
VI. EVALUATION
We present the evaluation of the Coconut threshold creden-
tials scheme; ﬁrst we present a benchmark of the cryptographic
primitives described in Section III and then we evaluate the
smart contracts described in Section V.
A. Cryptographic Primitives
We implement the primitives described in Section III in
Python using petlib13 and bplib14. The bilinear pairing is
deﬁned over the Barreto-Naehrig [32] curve, using OpenSSL
as arithmetic backend.
a) Timing benchmark: Table I shows the mean (µ) and
standard deviation (√σ2) of the execution of each procedure
described in section Section III. Each entry is the result of
