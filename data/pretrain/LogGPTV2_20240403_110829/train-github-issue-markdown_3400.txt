When "RequestResponseBodyMethodProcessor" is used to handle the return value
(by annotating the method with `@ResponseBody`), the HttpMessageConverter is
choosen based on request header "Accept".
Please provide an ability to also choose a HttpMessageConverter based on
pathExtension (similar to ContentNegotiatingViewResolver).
The HtppMessageConverter is choosed in the following class now.  
org.springframework.web.servlet.mvc.method.annotation.support.AbstractMessageConverterMethodProcessor  
Method: writeWithMessageConverters
