Local laws vary. 
Overview
Using the preparation/attack/response model
Types of attacks
What can I do to protect myself, my organization and my users?
Legal methods as IT infrastructure attacks
•
Similar aims
•
Shutdown
– Injunction 
– DOS attack
•
Information
– Database intrusion
– Subpoena
•
Similar precautions
•
Good offsite backups
– Destructive search warrant execution
– Natural disaster
•
Strong searching & archiving 
solution
– Good for responding to discovery 
order
–
Useful for preventing redundant 
storage
Types of Legal attacks
•
Search Warrants
•
Subpoenas
•
Discovery
•
Wiretaps
•
Transitive trust attacks
Search Warrants
• “The rights of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, 
papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and 
seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but 
upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and 
particularly describing the place to be searched, and the 
persons or things to be seized”
Fourth Amendment, U.S. Constitution
Search Warrants, continued
•
Warrant requires:
– Neutral Judicial Officer, who determines that
– Probable cause that a
– Crime occurred, and that 
 Persons named and/or
 Evidence is within place to be searched
– Signed, written affidavit by LEO attesting to probable cause above
– Particularity of items to be seized and area to be searched.
•
Warrant allows-
– The items named in the warrant
– Seizure of contraband, evidence, fruits and instrumentalities of crime found 
during search
– For computers ‘containing’ the above, the seizure of the data or the computer 
(LEO’s discretion)‏
Search Warrant as attack
•
Noisy and destructive
– Minimal warning
 No-knock vs knock warrants
– NO immediate defenses
 You can't make it better
 You can make it worse
– “Unintentional” collateral damage to obtain additional information or to expand 
scope of search
Preparation for the Search Warrant
•
IT defences
– Multiple site data and systems backup
 Preferably in multiple jurisdictions
 Automatic failover useful as well. 
•
Legal defences
– Minimizing damage during the warrant execution
 Helpful vs Passive
 DO NOT INTERFERE
 Shut the fuck up
•
Cleaning up afterwards
 Legal-Excluding evidence found in an invalid warrant (Leon rule)‏
 IT- Cut over to alternate site or restore from backup to new boxen
Warrantless searches
•
Generally require probable cause
– Exceptions
 Search incident to lawful arrest
 Automobile searches
 Regulatory searches (border crossing, airports)‏
♦ U.S. v Arnold (need reasonable suspicion to search contents of laptop at border crossing)‏
 Exigent circumstances 
♦ U.S. v Heckencamp (IT staffer can intrude into an attacker’s PC to determine source of 
attack without violating 4th
 Amendment, and presumably 18 U.S.C. 1030)‏
Warrantless searches, continued
•
More exceptions
– Third party searches
 U.S. v Steiger (Turkish 'hacker' sends proof of child porn on Steiger's computer to local 
law enforcement)‏
– Permissive Searches
 U.S. v Andrus (Dad grants LEO access to son's PC, even though dad does not use or 
have password to computer; enough for LEO to assume Dad had authority to grant 
access
Wiretaps
•
Requires warrant under 18 USC §2510 et seq
– Must specify target and not capture innocent traffic
•
CALEA (Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act)‏
– Provider must enable the government to intercept targeted communications (and 
filter out innocent ones)‏
– Concurrent with transmission
– Requires valid warrant 
– Intercepted transmissions must be in format 'transportable' to government 
 Government may not specify provider equipment or specifications
 Issue with 'transportable'- is this merely compatible with remote monitoring or does it 
imply the ability to perform CALEA wiretaps w/o provider's knowledge?
Wiretap Attack Profile
•
Stealthy and incriminating
– Tapped upstream may not know
– Target will not know until after charged with crime. 
•
Defenses
– IT
 Strong encryption with limited distribution of private key
♦ If ISP/Provider offers encryption, can be forced to divulge under CALEA §103(b)(3)‏
♦ Grand Jury can subpoena keys from holders, but can't swear them to secrecy
♦ National Security Letters  limited to transactional information but do have gag orders 18 U.S.C. 
§ 2709(c)‏
– Legal
 Attack warrant when revealed
♦ If no PC, or other flaws, information can be suppressed
♦ If innocent communications captured, possible civil remedies
Subpoenas
•
Court backed order for information
– Issued by Attorneys, Grand Juries, Regulatory agencies
•
Not a court order
– Court order is order by a judge
– Subpoena is order by an officer of court, and can be reviewed by a judge
•
Two basic types
– Subpoena Duces Tecum (SDT)‏
 Bring us information or stuff, or let us look at stuff
– Subpoena Ad Testificandum (SAT)‏
 Come and testify under oath
Subpoenas, continued
•
Not much protection
– No right against self-incrimination in civil or regulatory issues
– Right against self incrimination must be expressly invoked for criminal ones
•
Limits on use
– No undue burden or expense on recipient 
 Expense relative to size of controversy
 Burden relative to alternate methods of getting same information
– No privileged material
– Not for harassment or improper purpose
•
Enforcement 
– Civil contempt (fines or jail time until performance)‏
Subpoena Attack Profile
•
Intrusive, mysterious and dangerous
– Reasonable time to respond
– Can force you to admit incriminating facts
– Mystery of actual purpose behind subpoena
 Am I a target or merely a witness
 Do I fight them or give them what they want?
Subpoena Defenses
•
IT defenses
– Mitigation
 Easily searched indexes of all electronic documents in enterprise
 Clear and followed data retention policy
– Stonewalling
 Compartmentalization
 Black Holes
•
Legal Defenses
– Motion to Quash
 Burden, Privilege, Trade Secret
– Protective order
 Limit subpoena
Subpoena Miscellaneous
•
Encryption keys and passwords might not be protected from 
disclosure
• But content of messages held by 'providers' may be protected
– With valid warrant by law enforcement (18 U.S.C. § 2703(c)(1)(A)‏
– With valid court order for customer records
Discovery
•
Requires filed suit
– Works like subpoena against parties to suit
– Automatic disclosure required: FRCP 26(a)(1)(B)‏
 Must disclose locations and types of Electronically Stored Information (ESI)‏
♦ Can protect from actual delivery if undue burden or cost (26(b)(2)(B)‏
 Can supplement with additional orders against parties
 Must be in format used by your organization (not Klingon)‏
– Can also subpoena third parties for responsive information
– Destruction of evidence once suit likely has bad consequences
 Sanctions to counsel
 Adverse inference instructions
 Dismissal of claims
Discovery Attack Profile
•
Slow, expensive bleeding
– E-discovery can get expensive and time consuming
 This used to be the 'Third Rail' of litigation
 Would be used to unnecessarily increase lawsuit costs
 Old rules patchwork and unclear
– December 2006 amendments
 Rules clarified somewhat
 Mandatory disclosure
 Still expensive, and chance for really expensive errors
♦ Duty to preserve may also be a duty to collect (Torrentspy)‏
Discovery defenses
•
IT Defenses
– Ability to quickly, efficiently and completely 
 Locate & retrieve responsive information
 Determine cost of burdensome recoveries
 Determine privilege 
 Archival/indexing solutions
 Preserve responsive information
– Document retention and destruction policies
 Enforced &Rational
 No loopholes
Discovery defenses
•
Legal Defenses
– Opposing discovery order
 Showing costs and burden believably
♦ Colombia v Bunnell-(Torrentspy)- burden not shown
 Drinking from the fire hose
♦ Burying 'smoking gun' in haystack of responsive but useless information
Discovery defenses, continued
•
IT & Legal team effort
– Pre- discovery 
 IT can quantify effort to get 'inaccessible' information
 Legal can use this information to restrict or eliminate duty to turn over
– During discovery
 IT can assist with specifying incoming and outgoing discovery
 Legal can force compatibility with other side
– Counter-attack
 A savvy IT person can help at the Rule 26 conference
♦ Determine if other side is fudging
•
When IT & Legal don't work well together
– IT misunderstands Legal's needs
 Risk of sanctions
– Legal misunderstands IT's needs
 Overly broad litigation holds
 'Death Spiral'
Transitive trust attacks
•
Attacker probes for weakest link in chain of trust
•
If B & C share datum i
– Control of i depends on the weaker of B&C from attacker A's point of view
 e.g. B has weaker security but A has inside person at C
 If B is less willing than C to fight to keep i secret 
•
Think of organizational data as a network
– Willingness to defend data asset is security
– Different willingness to defend same secret based upon requester
– Rebuffed by B? go to C and ask
Examples of Transitive trust attacks
•
New Jersey v Ceres (2005)‏
– 'Perverted Justice' method acquires screen name and incriminatory chat
– Subpoena to AOL maps screen name to IP address, login times, billing name and 
address
 AOL more willing to give subscriber info to LEO than civil parties
•
MySpace, Fyodor and GoDaddy
– MySpace wants to get material off the net
 two links in trust chain
♦ Fyodor (interested in protecting material)‏
♦ Domain Name Registrar (interested in avoiding litigation)‏
 MySpace goes after weak link, and wins.
Defending from transitive attacks
•
Know what information is shared with other organizations
– Get agreements to alert you quickly- before they must deliver information
– Intervene quickly and aggressively as party in interest
•
Know what information is important and what isn't
– Can you keep sensitive information in-house?
•
Defense agreements
– Alert & defense (agree to pay for defense up to fixed amount)‏
– Mutual defense (pay to defend other's data in your hands in exchange for same)‏
