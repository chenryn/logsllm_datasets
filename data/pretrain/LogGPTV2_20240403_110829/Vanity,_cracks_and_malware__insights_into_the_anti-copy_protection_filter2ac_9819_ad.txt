# Malware Distribution on Download Sources

## 5.2.5 Malware Distribution on Download Sources

Our automated system for acquiring cracks and keygens downloads from three primary sources: Usenet, BitTorrent, and One-Click Hosting (OCH). To analyze the prevalence of malware, we compared the total number of downloads from each source with the number of infected downloads.

A sample is considered infected if it is detected by at least 30% of the antivirus engines on VirusTotal. Using this criterion, we calculated the overall malware distribution across the different download sources. The results are presented in Figure 8.

Surprisingly, the percentage of infected downloads was significantly higher for Usenet compared to BitTorrent and OCH. This can be attributed to the nature of Usenet. Once a file is uploaded to Usenet, it remains available as long as the upload is within the retention period of the Usenet provider, which is often 1,000 days or more. Consequently, a crack or keygen with embedded malware can remain accessible for years. In contrast, BitTorrent downloads become unavailable if there are not enough seeders, and OCH files are frequently removed due to complaints.

## 6. Discussion

The key takeaway from our evaluation is that downloading cracks and keygens from any internet source is highly risky. Even with our conservative threshold of 30% detection, more than half of the files were found to be infected. This indicates an unprecedented level of malware exposure for users who download cracks. Additionally, the high infection rate suggests that this method of malware distribution is popular among various malicious actors, such as pay-per-install (PPI) providers and underground entrepreneurs.

The reasons for the attractiveness of keygens and cracks are multifaceted. For one, the technical barriers for attackers are minimal. The target programs are typically small, saving bandwidth, and popular titles can be easily identified through commercial rankings. Users who download these files often operate on the fringes of legality, making them more likely to execute potentially harmful downloads. Furthermore, many users rely solely on their antivirus software, which may not always be effective against repacked malware.

Interestingly, every third file we examined was previously unknown, leading to two important conclusions:
1. Malware samples are constantly repacked or newly created to evade detection by antivirus scanners. Signature-based detection has its limitations, and heuristics are less effective against packers. For heuristics to be effective, the infection rate must be correspondingly high.
2. By closely monitoring the distribution channels for cracks and keygens, antivirus companies could access a rich pool of zero-day malware or repacked viruses. Given that roughly one-third of the malware was undetected, there is significant room for improvement in the effectiveness of antivirus solutions.

It is worth noting that the individuals who initially create the cracks and keygens do not have malicious intentions; their primary motivation is often group reputation and other sociological factors. However, once the cracked software is made public, it is often loaded with malware through various means. For malware distributors and PPI providers, these cracks are valuable assets waiting to be exploited, a process that has been refined to a high degree.

## 7. Conclusion

In this study, we collected over 43,900 download links and analyzed more than 23,100 (3,551 unique) real-world cracks and serial number generators. Our findings indicate that a majority of these programs aim to infect the target machine with one or more types of malware. A significant percentage of the examined samples had never been seen before, suggesting that the scene is heavily used for malware distribution. For end-users, the risk of being exposed to malicious code when dealing with cracked applications or games is more than 50 percent, a risk that can only be mildly mitigated by an up-to-date antivirus scanner.
