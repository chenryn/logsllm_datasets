5.2.5 Malware Distribution on Download Sources
Our automated crack and keygen acquisition system down-
loads from three downloads sources: The Usenet, BitTorrent
and One-Click Hosting (OCH). Similar to the analysis for
manual downloads, we compared the number of all down-
loads per download source with the number of corresponding
infected downloads.
A sample is considered to be infected, if the Virustotal
detection percentage was at least 30%. Utilizing this data,
we calculated the overall malware distribution on download
sources. The result is visible in Figure 8.
Surprisingly, the percentage of infected downloads was sig-
ni(cid:12)cantly higher for Usenet downloads than for Bittorrent
or OCH downloads. We believe that this is due to the way
the Usenet works. If a sample is uploaded to the Usenet,
it can be downloaded as long as the upload is not older
than the retention time of the Usenet provider. Hence, if
a crack or keygen with freshly packed malware is uploaded,
it will be available even years later (considering that most
binary Usenet providers have retention times of 1,000 days
and more). In contrast, the lifetime of BitTorrent and OCH
downloads is more limited. BitTorrent downloads no longer
work if there are not enough seeders whereas OCH down-
loads are frequently removed in case of complaints.

6. DISCUSSION
The key message from our evaluation and the numeric re-
sults is quite simple. Downloading cracks and keygens from
any source on the Internet is very dangerous. Even with
our conservative form of measurement, which considers only
samples where 30% or more of all scanners raised an alert,

mated Downloads (CDF)
this claim holds true. With more than every second (cid:12)le being
infected, the level of malware exposure for users download-
ing cracks is yet unmatched. Simultaneously, the numbers
suggest, that this form of malware distribution is popular
with various miscreants like PPI providers or underground
entrepreneurs. The reasons for the attractiveness of keygens
and cracks are manifold. One one hand, the technical bar-
riers for a miscreant are minimal. The target programs are
typically small which saves bandwidth, popular titles can be
easily deduced by commercial rankings and the victims al-
ready operate on the brink of legality and are therefore more
willing to execute shady downloads. On the other hand, the
users are no experts and rely on their Anti-Virus software
to protect their system. A precaution that often turns out
to be futile. Furthermore, most of the investigated samples
turned out to be younger than expected.
Every third scrutinized (cid:12)le was not known before, sug-
gesting two important conclusions:
1. Malware samples are constantly repacked or even newly
created to fool the victim’s AV scanners. Signature-
based detection can only protect a system to a certain
extend. Detection heuristics, on the other hand, are
of limited e(cid:11)ectiveness against packers. For this e(cid:11)ort
to pay o(cid:11), the infection rate must be correspondingly
high.
2. By closely monitoring the crack and keygen distribu-
tion channels covered in this paper, Anti Virus Com-
panies could access a rich pool of 0-day malware or
repacked viruses. Since our results show that roughly
one third of malware is not detected at all, we believe
that there is room for improvement for AV companies.
Interestingly, the intentions of the individuals initially pro-
ducing the crack/keygen are not malicious. Their main mo-
tivation is not the money but group reputation and other
sociological aspects. As soon as the cracked software is
made public though, it is loaded with malware through var-
ious procedures. For malware distributors or PPI providers,
these cracks are a simple asset that wait to be exploited. An
undertaking that has been perfected to an almost exorbitant
degree.
7. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we collected more than 43; 900 download
links and analyzed more than 23; 100 (3; 551 unique) result-
ing real-world cracks and serial number generators to get an
idea how dangerous it is for an individual to circumvent a
program’s copy protection. Our results indicate that a ma-
jority of these programs aim to infect the target machine
with one or more types of malware. Furthermore, a good
percentage of the scrutinized samples have never been seen
before, suggesting that the scene is heavily used for malware
distribution and maintained accordingly. For the end-user
it means that the chance to be exposed to malicious code
when dealing with cracked applications or games is more
than 50 percent. A risk that can only mildly be mitigated
by an up-to-date Anti-Virus scanner.
