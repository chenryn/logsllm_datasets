**ATT&CK Technique Name:** User Account Management

To mitigate the risks associated with user account management, organizations should adhere to the principle of least privilege. This involves:

1. **Limiting Administrative Privileges:** Restrict the number of users within the organization who have IAM roles with administrative privileges. 
2. **Reducing Permanent Privileged Roles:** Aim to minimize the assignment of permanent privileged roles, instead opting for temporary or just-in-time (JIT) access when necessary.
3. **Conducting Regular Entitlement Reviews:** Perform periodic reviews of IAM users, roles, and policies to ensure that permissions are up-to-date and aligned with the principle of least privilege.

By implementing these practices, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and potential security breaches.
