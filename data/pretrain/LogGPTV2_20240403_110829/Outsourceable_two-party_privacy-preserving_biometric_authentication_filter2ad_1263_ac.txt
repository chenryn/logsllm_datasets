We discuss about the hardness of WHintLWE in Section 4.5. To be precise, we
prove that there exists a reduction from LWE to WHintLWE so that WHintLWE is
at least as hard as worst-case lattice problems such as the shortest independent
vectors problem.
The following theorem is the security proof of our scheme under the hardness
assumption of WHintLWE.
Theorem 2. Assuming that WHintLWEk
Π in Section 4.3 is a 1-sSIM-secure FFB-IPE.
n,q,σ,σ∗ (DS) is hard, our construction
Proof. Fix an eﬃcient adversary who makes a single query to the oracle for
KeyGen and at most Q = poly(λ) queries to the oracle for Enc. Note that an
adversary has to query the oracle for KeyGen ﬁrst, since otherwise the queries
for Enc will be aborted. We construct a simulator S as follows:
– On adversary’s query x ∈ {−1, 1}k to the oracle for KeyGen, the simulator
receives as input a new collection P(cid:48) of inner products and sets P ← P(cid:48).
The simulator generates sk ← Zm
– On adversary’s query y(i) ∈ {−1, 1}k to the oracle for Enc, the simulator
receives as input a new collection P(cid:48) of inner products and updates P ← P(cid:48)
(retrieving (cid:104)x, y(i)(cid:105)). The simulator samples b(i) ← Rk

Let Expt 0 be the real world experiment. That is, for an eﬃcient adversary
A, we generate msk := (u, S) from Setup to answer the oracle queries with the
legitimate KeyGen and Enc outputs consistently in Expt 0. We show that Expt
0, real world experiment, is indistinguishable from the simulated one which is

Observe that u involved in generating sk is uniformly random and is used
for only one time. Hence, the distributions of (sk,{c(i)}i) in Expt 0 and Expt 1
are the same in the adversary’s view.

The distributions of (sk,{c(i)}i) in Expt 1 and Expt 2 are computation-
ally indistinguishable when assuming the hardness of the WHintLWEk

problem. The distributions of (sk,{c(i)}i) in Expt 2 and Expt 3 are identical,
since e(i) in Expt 2 is independent from other variables.
4.5 The Hardness of HintLWE and Weak-HintLWE
We ﬁrst deﬁne another variant of (multi-secret) LWE, the HintLWE problem,
which additionally publishes a full-dimensional hint on the error of original LWE.
Contrary to the Weak-HintLWE problem, instead of publishing (cid:104)z, e(cid:105) + f for
some known vector z and a Gaussian error f , the HintLWE problem gives the
whole vector e + f for a Gaussian vector f which contains much more infor-
mation. We will ﬁrst reduce LWE to HintLWE, and then reduce HintLWE to
Weak-HintLWE which is relatively a simple step.

Now, we present a theorem about a polynomial-time reduction from LWE
to HintLWE. Before introducing the theorem, we describe a crucial lemma on a
conditional Gaussian distribution which will be exploited in the hardness proof.
The proof of the lemma is given in Appendix A.

Then we can check

2/(cid:112)σ(cid:48)2
where L denotes the value of κf . Let σ(cid:48) = (cid:112)σ(cid:48)2
Note that it is enough to show that the distribution of (κf, (e + f )|f ) equals to
the distribution of (e(cid:48) + f(cid:48), e(cid:48)|(e(cid:48) + f(cid:48))) where e(cid:48) ← Dσ(cid:48)
, which
implies that (a, b + f, κf ) is distributed exactly as same as (a, b + e(cid:48), e(cid:48) + f(cid:48)).
It is easy to check that the distribution of (κf, (e+f )|f ) is D1 = (Dκσ2 , DL/κ,σ1 )
1 + σ(cid:48)2
2 , then by Lemma 1,
(e(cid:48) +f(cid:48), e(cid:48)|(e(cid:48) +f(cid:48))) follows the distribution D2 = (Dσ(cid:48), DL(cid:48)σ(cid:48)2
2/σ(cid:48)) where
1σ(cid:48)
L(cid:48) denotes the value of e(cid:48) + f(cid:48). By the condition σ1 = σ(cid:48)
2 and the
deﬁnitions of σ2, κ and σ(cid:48), we obtain κσ2 = σ(cid:48), 1/κ = σ(cid:48)2
1 /σ(cid:48)2 and σ1 = σ(cid:48)
2/σ(cid:48)
so that distributions D1 and D2 are identical.
In case that b is uniform over Rq, the distribution of (a, b+f, κf ) equals to the
distribution of (a, b, kf ), which is exactly U (Zn
1 + σ2
2.
Therefore, the reduction is correct for the case k = 1, and obviously preserves
the advantage.
For the case of arbitrary k, the reduction process is exactly the transformation
from a multi-secret LWE sample (a, b) to (a, b + f , κf ) where f ← Dk
. For
1 ≤ i ≤ k, we have already proved that (κfi, (ei + fi)|fi) and (e(cid:48)
i|(e(cid:48)
i + f(cid:48)
i ))
are equally distributed where e(cid:48)
, which are all mutually
independent cases (for i). Therefore, in case of b = Sta + e(cid:48), the distribution of
(a, b + f , κf ) equals to the distribution of (a, Sta + e(cid:48), e(cid:48) + f(cid:48)). In case that b
