}  The dotransform function is the entry point 
}  Accepts two parameters: request, and 
response	
}  The request object has the following 
properties: 
◦  value: the Entity display value (string) 
◦  fields: the Entity fields (dictionary) 
◦  params: extra parameters that can be parsed by 
optparse	
Nadeem Douba | www.cygnos.com 
31 
}  The response object is where we populate our 
results 
}  dotransform must return the response object 
}  response object uses mathematical operators 
to add and remove Entity and UIMessage 
objects 
◦  E.g. response	
  +	
  Phrase(‘Hi’) appends a Phrase 
Entity object to the response object 
}  Finally, onterminate function is called if 
Maltego interrupts the transform – it is 
optional

}  @superuser instructs the dispatcher to run 
the transform as the super-user 
}  If a transform is being executed as a non-
super-user: 
◦  dispatcher will invoke sudo	
◦  Prompt user for sudo password 
◦  If successful, execute the transform using sudo	
◦  Else, abort execution after three retries

}  Instructs mtginstall on how to configure transform in Maltego 
}  Parameters: 
◦  label: display label of transform in Maltego 
◦  description: A brief description 
◦  uuids: list of universally unique identifiers (or transform descriptor file 
names) 
◦  inputs: list of tuples containing Transform Set name and Input Entity 
type 
◦  debug: whether or not debug window should appear in Maltego on 
transform execution

}  For example: 
◦  Transform will appear as To	
  Phrase	
  [Hello	
  World] in 
Maltego GUI 
◦  Will belong to the Useless Transform Set 
◦  Can only be applied to Person type Entities 
◦  Have a unique ID of 
sploitego.v2.PersonToPhrase_HelloWorld	
◦  A debug window will appear on transform execution 
Nadeem Douba | www.cygnos.com 
35 
}  Notice how uuids and inputs are lists 
}  mtginstall supports one-to-many relationship 
between transforms and input entity types 
◦  For example, Hello World Transform could be applied 
to Phrase entities as well 
◦  Just add another uuid and inputs entry (matching 
order)

◦  First,	
  Install	
  Python	
  package	
  containing	
  transforms	
  distu:ls	
  or	
  setuptools	
  are	
  great	
  for	
  that!	
◦  Alterna,vely,

  mtginstall	
Nadeem Douba | www.cygnos.com

}  Input Parameters:  
◦  Hello World Transform is in foobar package 
◦  Maltego’s settings are stored in ~/Library/
Application\	
  Support/maltego/v3.1.1/	
  (on Mac 
OS X) 
◦  Your transform working directory is ~/	
}  To Install Transform Package, Run: 
$ mtginstall

1.  mtginstall first imports __init__.py in 
foobar package 
2.  Iterates the __all__ special variable to get list 
of modules in package 
3.  Loads each module and looks for 
dotransform function annotated with 
@configure	
4.  Reads	
  installa:on	
  meta-­‐data	
  and	
  installs	
  transform	
  in	
Maltego	
  accordingly	
a)  If	
  Transform	
  Set	
  doesn’t	
  exist,	
  it	
  will	
  create	
  it.	
b)  Detects	
  name	
  collisions	
  between	
  transforms
