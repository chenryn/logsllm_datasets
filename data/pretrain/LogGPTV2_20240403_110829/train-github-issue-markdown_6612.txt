To sort the DataFrame horizontally based on the values in row index `264`, you need to use `axis=1` and specify the row index correctly. The error you encountered is because `sort_values` by default expects a column name or index, and when `axis=1` is specified, it sorts the columns based on the values in a specific row.

Here's how you can do it:

1. Ensure that the row index `264` is correctly referenced.
2. Use `axis=1` to sort the columns.

Hereâ€™s the corrected code:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Assuming df is your DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({
    728: [96, 40, 64, 38],
    562: [29, 25, 95, 56],
    599: [99, 41, 63, 73],
    642: [63, 47, 90, 17],
    592: [73, 14, 52, 98],
    686: [48, 33, 82, 56],
    602: [81, 54, 66, 80],
    744: [48, 63, 26, 77],
    640: [13, 33, 26, 44],
    678: [25, 45, 20, 49]
}, index=[309, 337, 395, 264])

# Sort the DataFrame horizontally based on row index 264
sorted_df = df.sort_values(by=264, axis=1)

print(sorted_df)
```

### Explanation:
- `by=264`: This specifies that the sorting should be based on the values in the row with index `264`.
- `axis=1`: This indicates that the sorting should be done across the columns (horizontally).

This will sort the columns of the DataFrame based on the values in the row with index `264`.

### Output:
The resulting DataFrame will have its columns sorted based on the values in row `264` from smallest to largest.

If you want to sort in descending order, you can add the `ascending=False` parameter:

```python
sorted_df = df.sort_values(by=264, axis=1, ascending=False)
```

This will sort the columns in descending order based on the values in row `264`.
