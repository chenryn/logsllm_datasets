The main goal of this experiment is to emulate larger
process variations. To expedite power-trace simulations, we
used the 256-bit RSA circuit instead of using the 512-bit
RSA circuit in this experiment. This circuit has approxi-
mately the same area as the 512-bit circuit, thus preserving
the ratio of Trojan area to total circuit area.

Figure 7. Projections of power traces from
genuine and Trojan ICs on process noise
eigenvectors, Experiment 1.
To emulate larger process noise, we increased the range
of random library-parameter variations to ±5%, and com-
piled them using the Synopsys Library Compiler [27]. We
then used each compiled library (typical library as well as
15 new libraries) to synthesize 16 genuine ICs and 16 ICs
with Trojan just as was done for the ﬁrst experiment. For
each synthesized circuit, we conducted power-trace simula-
tions.
However, this time, for both the genuine and Trojan RSA
circuits, 4 out of 32 power traces, corresponding to two spe-
ciﬁc technology library variations, resulted in abnormal be-
havior at exactly the same region of the power traces. We
believe this behavior is caused by the increased amount of
random variation in the technology library that may break
the piecewise linear model for some VLSI cells. In turn, that
may lead to anomalous signals being produced during sim-
ulations. In our analysis, we ignored the anomalous power
traces, and proceeded with only 28 power traces.
Figure 8 shows the eigenvalue spectrum of the power-
trace signals (40 contiguous sample points) taken in the
middle of a modular multiplication operation where the
process noise is the highest in amplitude. With the larger
parameter variations, in this case, the process noise has
roughly the same magnitude as the extra power leakage
caused by the Trojan. However, even in this case, the traces
from genuine and Trojan circuits clearly differ in the 12-
th and 13-th eigenvectors. Thus once again, the eigenvalue
spectrum yields a simple test to distinguish Trojan ICs from
the genuine ones.

5.3. Experiment 3:
256-bit RSA Circuit
with the 8-bit Sequential Comparator
Based Trojan and with ±5% Parame-
ter Variations
The goal of this experiment is to push the limits of our
technique even harder by decreasing the size of the Trojan
circuit by an order of magnitude. The 8-bit sequential com-
parator based Trojan used in this experiment has an equiva-
lent area of 33 2-input NAND gates constituting only 0.12%
of the total circuit area. We kept the parameter variations
in the same range of ±5% as used in the second experi-
ment. It turns out that with the smaller Trojan circuit, the
power-trace contribution of the Trojan is now much smaller
in magnitude than the process noise (see Figure 9).
In the resulting power traces, we found that either the
Trojan signals are completely enveloped inside the larger
process-noise signals (Figure 10) or the Trojan signals
step out of the process-noise envelop at certain sample
points (Figure 10). We found that in either case, it is pos-
sible to detect the Trojan signals by using the KL analy-
sis. It was interesting to note that Trojan detection is eas-
ier when the Trojan signals step out of the process-noise
envelope. Figure 11 shows the eigenvalue spectrums of
the genuine ICs and the ICs with Trojan obtained by tak-
ing 30 contiguous sample points in time. Note that in the
ﬁrst case, when Trojan signals are completely within the
process-noise envelope, the traces from the genuine and
Trojan circuits clearly separate in the 14-th and 15-th eigen-
vectors. In contrast, in the second case, when Trojan signals
step out of the process-noise envelope, the traces start sep-
arating earlier in the 8-th eigenvector and separate more of-
ten, e.g. at the 11-th, 13-th, 15-th, 17-th ,18-th and 20-th
eigenvectors.

with the 3-bit Combinational Com-

Parameter Variations
Finally, in order to explore the limit of the proposed tech-
nique, we shrunk the Trojan size by another order of mag-
nitude and increased the range of parameter variations to
±7.5%. We used the simple 3-bit combinational compara-
tor based Trojan which has an equivalent area of only 3 2-
input NAND gates constituting only 0.01% of the total cir-
cuit area. As shown in Figure 12, in this case, the process
noise completely overwhelms the Trojan signal.

was falsely detected as Trojan resulting in a 2% false Tro-
jan assertion rate. This single false Trojan case can be seen
on the right of Figure 14. Figure 15 provides an alternative
perspective on the efﬁcacy of this approach. Clearly, our
statistical method for detecting very small Trojans requires
improvements and we need to develop the theory in this area
more.

from genuine (green or grey) and Trojan (red
or dark grey) ICs, Experiment 4.
Figure 13 shows the eigenvalue spectrums of the power-
traces obtained from genuine ICs and ICs with Trojan, ob-
tained by taking 50 contiguous sample points. Note that
in this case the eigenvalue spectrum from the genuine and
Trojan ICs do not separate and are not distinguishable. So
Trojan detection ﬁnally seems to be a challenge. We tried
the following two ad-hoc approaches to remedy the situa-
tion.
