User: I am using numpy / scipy / pynest to do some research computing on Mac OS X. For performance, we rent a 400-node cluster (with Linux) from our university so that the tasks could be done parallel. The problem is that we are NOT allowed to install any extra packages on the cluster (no sudo or any installation tool), they only provide the raw python itself.
How can I run my scripts on the cluster then? Is there any way to integrate the modules (numpy and scipy also have some compiled binaries I think) so that it could be interpreted and executed without installing packages?
Assistant: You can import a module from an arbitrary path by calling:
sys.path.append()
