User: By given an entity ID , I will query by models = Model.get_by_id(id). However, I find out that some time it will not return result collectly.
Is there any alternative or recommended method to query by entity ID in Google App Engine, python?
Assistant: If Model.get_by_id(id) returns None, this indicates that you've supplied an invalid ID, not that the method itself is unreliable.
It's not inconceivable that this method could fail in the event of a system outage, but if it did, your call would throw a datastore exception, not return an empty result.
