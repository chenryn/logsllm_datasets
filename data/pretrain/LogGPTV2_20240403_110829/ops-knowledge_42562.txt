User: We have a HBase implementation over Hadoop. As of now all our Map-Reduce jobs are written as Java classes. I am wondering if there is a good way to use Python scripts to pass to HBase for Map-Reduce.
Assistant: You can very easily do map reduce programming with Python which would interact with thrift server. Hbase client in python would be a thrift client.
