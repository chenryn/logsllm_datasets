**ATT&CK ID:** S0402  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** OSX/Shlayer

**Description:**

When executed with elevated privileges, the OSX/Shlayer malware can use the `spctl` command to disable Gatekeeper protection for a downloaded file. Additionally, it can exploit system links pointing to bash scripts within the downloaded DMG file to bypass Gatekeeper. This particular vulnerability was addressed in macOS 11.3 and later versions. Notably, some variants of OSX/Shlayer have been notarized by Apple, allowing them to pass additional Gatekeeper checks.
