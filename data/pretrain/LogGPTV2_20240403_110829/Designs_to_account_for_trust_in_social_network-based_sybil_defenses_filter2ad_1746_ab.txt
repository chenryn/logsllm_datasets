It’s then easy to show that
the bounding distribution is a valid probability distribution since
α + deg(vr )
Similarity-biased random walks: The similarity between nodes in
social networks is used for measuring the strength of social ties and
predicting future interactions [1]. For two nodes vi and vj with sets
of neighbors N (vi) and N (vj), respectively, the similarity is de-
ﬁned as the set of nodes common to both of vi and vj normalized by
all their neighbors and expressed as: S(vi, vj) = N (vi)∩N (vj )
N (vi)∪N (vj ) . For
vi, vj ∈ A corresponding to the adjacency entries of vi and vj, the
cosine similarity measure is used to capture the similarity deﬁnition
above, given as S(vi, vj) = vi·vj
where | · |2 is the L2-Norm.
|vi|2|vj|2
To avoid disconnected graphs resulting from edge cases, we aug-
ment the similarity deﬁnition by adding 1 each time to the denomi-
nator to account for the edge between the nodes. Also, we compute
the similarity for adjacent nodes only by computing S, the similar-
ity matrix, as S = [sij] where sij = S(vi, vj) if vj ∈ N (vi) and 0
otherwise. The transition matrix P of a random walk deﬁned using
the similarity is given as P = D−1S where D is a diagonal ma-
trix with diagonal elements being the row norm of S. Accordingly,
the stationary distribution of random walks on G according to P is
π = [πi]1×n where πi = ((cid:80)n
(cid:80)n
k=1 sjk)−1.

Interaction-biased random walks: recently, the interaction between
nodes has been observed as one measure for determining the strength
of social links between social actors especially in online social
networks [9]. In its simple form, the interaction model captures
activities between the different nodes in the graph (e.g., the post-
ing between different users in the Facebook) and assigns weights,
which translates into high trust value, to nodes that have higher in-
teraction and lower weights to nodes with less interaction. Let B
be the raw interaction measurements and D be a diagonal matrix
with diagonal elements being the row norm of B, the transition
matrix P of the random walk based on interaction is computed as
P = D−1B and, similar to the similarity-biased walks, the station-
ary distribution derived from the interaction matrix is π = [πi]1×n
where πi = ((cid:80)n
i=1 biz)((cid:80)n
(cid:80)n
k=1 bjk)−1.
j=1
Mixed random walks: it is intuitive and natural to consider a hybrid
design that constitutes more than one of the aforementioned ran-
dom walks. In particular, the interaction and similarity-based mod-
els “rank” different nodes differently and “locally” assign weights
to them. Though this limits the mixing time of social graphs as we
will see later, it does not provide nodes any authority on the ran-
dom walk once they are a “past state”. On the other hand, beneﬁts
of these models are shortcomings for the lazy and originator-biased
models. It’s hence technically promising and intuitively sound to
consider combinations of these designs.

4. RESULTS AND BRIEF DISCUSSION
We ﬁrst measure the mixing time of the social graphs used in
this study — in Table 1 — using the deﬁnition of the mixing time

Figure 3: Preliminary measurements of modiﬁed random walks’ impact on the mixing time — (a) and (b) are for originator-biased
while (c) and (d) are for lazy random walks.
Implication of the pragmatic designs on the mixing time: we im-
plement three of the proposed designs: lazy, originator, and simi-
larity biased random walks and examine their impact on the mixing
time of social graphs in Table 1. For feasibility reasons, we sam-
ple only 10K nodes, using the breadth-ﬁrst search algorithm, from
each graph larger than 10K. The results are shown in Figure 2 and
Figure 3. We observe that, while they bound the mixing time of
the different social graphs, the originator-biased random walk is
too sensitive even to a small α. For instance, as shown in Figure
2(a),  ≈ 1/4 is realizable at w = 6 (for 99% admission of non-
Sybil nodes) with the simple random walk, w = 17 for both lazy
and originator-biased random walk. However, this is realized with
α = 0.5 in the lazy against α = 0.05 in the originator-biased walk.
Conclusion: we propose several designs to capture the trust value
of social graphs in social networks used for Sybil defenses. Our
designs ﬁlter weak trust links and successfully bound the mixing
time which controls the number of accepted nodes using the Sybil
defenses to account for variable trust. Our designs provide de-
fense designers parameters to model trust and pragmatically eval-
uate Sybil defenses based on the “real value” of social networks.

We follow this by examining the impact of adapting the different
trust characterization methods on the mixing time. In all measure-
ments we examine the mixing time and quantifying the impact of
degraded mixing time on the actual performance of each defense

Social graphs — datasets: the datasets used in our experimenta-
tion are in Table 1. These datasets are carefully selected so to fea-
ture (hypothetically) different models of knowledge of the social
actors among each other in the social graph. These graphs are cat-
egorized into: (1) Social graphs of networks that exhibit concrete
knowledge between social actors and are good for the trust assump-
tions of the Sybil defenses — e.g., co-authorship datasets, such as
physics co-authorships and DBLP which are shown to be slower
mixing (see Figure 1). (2) Graphs of networks that may not require
face-to-face knowledge but require the effort of interaction. — e.g.,
Youtube, Livejournal, and Enron, which are shown for slow mix-
ing. (3) Datasets that may not require prior knowledge between the
social actors and are known for exhibiting less strict social model
such as those of the online social networks (e.g., Facebook).
