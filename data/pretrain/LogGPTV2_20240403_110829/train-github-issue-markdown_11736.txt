> Describe how to replicate the bug.
I'm doing the fairly standard thing of adding a `g.user` property on the
appcontext in my app, but `pylint` is complaining with:
    Assigning to attribute 'user' not defined in class slots (assigning-non-slot)
Ignoring the pylint warning makes mypy complain very loudly error:
    "AppContext" has no attribute "user"
This can be reproduced using the docs
https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/appcontext/#storing-data, which
tell the user to store the `db` on `g` using: `g.db = connect_to_database()`.
If we're not supposed to be setting random properties there any more then the
docs probably need fixing. maybe we're supposed to use `db =
g.setdefault("db", connect_to_database())` now?
