User: I am using python and the codes are all worked well with non-portable version. Since I need to run the program on some computer that does not belong to me, which does not have installed python or such option available.
I use portable python instead. However the codes previously works well now report error"WindowsError: [Error 3] The system cannot find the path specified". I checked it on my computer. It works smoothly without the above error. Anybody can give a clue?
The cmd I am using is :
p = subprocess.Popen(self.cmdStr, shell=False, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=file)
I am redirecting the stderr to a file I specified.
I also googled online. There seems to have an issue of "subprocess PATH semantics and portability". I am not sure whether this is the reason. Please help. Thank you.
Assistant: Can 'cmd /c cmdstr' run correctly on windows?
