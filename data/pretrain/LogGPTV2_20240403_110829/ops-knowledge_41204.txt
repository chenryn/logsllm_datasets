Certainly! Here's a more polished and coherent version of your text:

I am using Python, and my code runs successfully with the non-portable version. However, I need to run the program on a computer that does not belong to me, and it does not have Python installed or the option to install it.

To address this, I decided to use a portable version of Python. Unfortunately, the code that previously worked without issues now reports an error: `WindowsError: [Error 3] The system cannot find the path specified`. I tested the code on my own computer, and it runs smoothly without any errors.

The command I am using is:
```python
p = subprocess.Popen(self.cmdStr, shell=False, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=file)
```
I am redirecting the `stderr` to a file I specified.

I also did some online research and found that there might be an issue related to "subprocess PATH semantics and portability." I'm not sure if this is the cause of my problem. Could anyone provide some guidance? Thank you.

Additionally, can the command `cmd /c cmdstr` run correctly on Windows?
