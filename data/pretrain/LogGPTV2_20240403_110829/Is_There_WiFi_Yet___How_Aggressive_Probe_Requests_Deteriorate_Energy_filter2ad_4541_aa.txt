## Abstract
WiFi offloading has become a crucial strategy for cellular operators to meet the high data demands of modern mobile devices. As a result, mobile devices aggressively seek out WiFi to enhance user Quality of Experience (QoE) and alleviate cellular network congestion. In home and work environments, aggressive WiFi scans can significantly speed up the process of connecting to a WiFi network. However, this aggressive behavior can have significant negative effects in crowded wireless environments. This paper analyzes empirical data from large (stadium) and medium (classroom) venues, and through controlled experiments, demonstrates how aggressive WiFi scans can degrade energy efficiency and throughput for mobile devices. We conclude with several thoughts on balancing the need for rapid WiFi discovery with the challenges of operating in dense networks.

## 1. Introduction
In recent years, there has been an explosion in data consumption on mobile devices, driven by the proliferation of smartphones, tablets, and the Internet of Things (IoT). While peak speeds for cellular networks (e.g., LTE) have improved, dense and indoor environments remain challenging. Although LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) promises to alleviate some of these issues with small cell support, questions remain about the economic viability and management complexity of such solutions [1].

For dense or crowded environments, WiFi offloading has become a key strategy for wireless network operators. Despite the unlicensed nature of WiFi and potential QoE issues, its high peak speeds and the ability to offload traffic from cellular networks make it an attractive option. Consequently, most mobile devices are configured to aggressively push users onto WiFi networks, either by prompting them whenever WiFi is available or by restricting certain services to WiFi only. Standards bodies have also developed protocols like ANDSF (Access Network Discovery and Service Function), Hotspot 2.0, ANQP (Access Network Query Protocol), and 802.11ax to further enhance WiFi offloading.

However, unlike cellular service, WiFi is not always pervasive or contiguous. The process of discovering WiFi networks relies on 802.11 Probe Requests (PRs), where a mobile device actively scans the WiFi spectrum (2.4 GHz and 5 GHz) for viable access points (APs). APs can respond with Beacon Responses, allowing the mobile device to quickly locate and join the WiFi network. In home and work environments, this aggressive scanning works well due to the manageable density of devices and known SSIDs.

Unfortunately, this aggressive behavior can be detrimental in crowded or ultra-dense environments, such as sports arenas, large conferences, or classrooms with high user density. In such settings, WiFi offloading is most needed, but aggressive scans can lead to excessive energy waste and degrade the performance of established WiFi networks. Our paper argues that aggressive Probe Requests in ultra-dense scenarios are akin to the annoying and wasteful "Are we there yet?" question, with significant implications for network health and performance. 

The contributions of this paper are three-fold:
1. **Ultra-dense probe request dynamics**: We capture and analyze the dynamics of PRs using packet sniffers at four home football games, measuring PR prevalence both at the exterior (gates) and interior (bowl) of the stadium. We show that most mobile devices continue to probe despite never finding WiFi, with PR rates in the stadium being nearly an order of magnitude higher than in dense classroom settings.
2. **Energy impact of probe requests**: We characterize the energy cost of active WiFi scanning, showing that aggressive scanning can increase energy consumption by up to 44% with little to no adaptation to scan success or failure.
3. **Throughput impact of probe requests**: We demonstrate the negative effects of aggressive WiFi scanning on network throughput, showing that even a few devices under default settings can significantly reduce network performance.

## 2. Related Work
WiFi has been extensively studied in the research community, with a focus on improving discovery speed and scanning efficiency. For example, Teng et al. proposed D-Scan [9] to improve scan efficiency in dense environments, while Yeo [10] and Rayanchu et al. [11] explored interference issues. Gupta and Mohapatra [12] focused on power consumption, and Raghavendra et al. [5] and Gupta et al. [6] examined performance in large-scale venues. The issue of WiFi performance in ultra-dense venues was recently discussed in a Cisco presentation for the 802.11ax working group [4].

While the problem of needless Probe Requests is well-known, reducing spurious PRs remains a challenge. Wu et al. proposed Footprint [8], and Ananthanarayanan and Stoica proposed Blue-Fi [7] to guide WiFi scans using cellular and Bluetooth, respectively. However, deployment and security concerns make these solutions difficult to implement in practice. Standardization efforts like Hotspot 2.0, ANDSF, and 802.11ax are making progress but face similar challenges.

## 3. Ultra-Dense Dataset
This section summarizes the data collected from four football games and two large class periods at the University of Notre Dame. We describe the data collection process and provide in-depth analyses.

### 3.1 Data Summary
Data was gathered near gate entrances and inside the stadium during four football games, and in the largest classroom on campus (DeBartolo 101) during two class periods. Multiple Linux laptops with extended wireless adapters were used to capture data in monitor mode using tcpdump. The stadium does not have publicly accessible WiFi, but small APs for the ticketing system are present. The stadium seats roughly 80,000, with five entrance gates (A-E). Crowds of up to 150,000 gather around the stadium, resulting in an overwhelmed cellular network. Data collection for the Michigan, Stanford, and North Carolina games began one hour before the start, while for the Northwestern game, data was collected during the game in the student section. Weather conditions and fan interest varied across the games.

For the classroom venue, data was collected in DeBartolo 101, which can hold up to 450 individuals. Each observation lasted approximately 75 minutes, starting before the class and ending after. Unlike the stadium, most UEs in the classroom should have already connected to the established WiFi infrastructure, leading to fewer scans once devices are settled.
