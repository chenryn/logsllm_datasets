**Title: BlackHat US-18: Kernel Mode Threats and Practical Defenses**

Recent advancements in operating system (OS) security by Microsoft, such as PatchGuard, Driver Signature Enforcement, and SecureBoot, have significantly reduced the prevalence of commodity kernel mode malware like TDL4 and ZeroAccess. However, sophisticated attackers continue to find ways to bypass these protections, leveraging kernel mode malware to stay ahead of defenders.

In this presentation, we will explore the techniques employed by advanced malware, such as DoublePulsar, SlingShot, and Turla, which enable attackers to evade endpoint defenses. We will also unveil a novel method for executing a fully kernel mode implant without touching the disk or being detected by security products. This method utilizes publicly available tools, making it accessible even to novice adversaries.

While attacker techniques have evolved, so too have the defensive measures against kernel mode threats. We will discuss the latest advancements in kernel malware detection, including real-time detection methods that leverage hypervisors and an innovative hardware-assisted approach using performance monitoring units. Additionally, we will cover on-demand techniques that utilize page table entry remapping to identify and mitigate kernel malware at scale.

To empower defenders, we will release a tool designed to effectively counter advanced kernel mode threats. As kernel mode threats continue to grow in both prominence and impact, this talk will provide the latest insights into attacker techniques and practical, real-world strategies for immediate implementation.
