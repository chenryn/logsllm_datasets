User: I'm not even sure what these would be called? I used to write them in ADA running on VAX-VMS!
I want to make a simple menu-driven application that would let me display menus and use the cursor keys to navigate around them, choose items and navigate around the app. All fully old school text based.
I want to be able to take over the whole terminal window and display stuff in different places.
Is this possible in Python?
Assistant: Yes, have a look at the different curses implementations.
