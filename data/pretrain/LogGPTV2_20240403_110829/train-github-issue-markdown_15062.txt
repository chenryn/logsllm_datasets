### Additional Information
Hi,
in few words:
  1. Under Linux (Debian Bookworm) works, under Windows, I have the warnings
  2. I am using Parcel v2 to create the bundle
  3. The issue seems quite clear: somehow under Windows it pretends to have the paths inside the "frontend" folder. Instead the files are inside the "backend" sister-folder, or inside the "node_modules/" folders. I have no idea of why this happens only under Windows... maybe some platform dependent code of electron
  4. I have seen the related issues (#22996 seems the more relevant, but maybe also #28993, #24916, #24537), but I have open this one since it is similar, but not equal, and they are referring to much older versions of electron
Regards.
