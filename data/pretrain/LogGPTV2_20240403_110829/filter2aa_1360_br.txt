### Creating a Covert Tinder Account

To create a covert Tinder account from your web browser, follow these steps to avoid account blocking. Tinder is highly sensitive to fraudulent accounts, so it's essential to align the following instructions carefully:

1. **Connect to Public Wi-Fi:**
   - Connect to a public Wi-Fi location near your target without using a Virtual Private Network (VPN).

2. **Login Process:**
   - Go to tinder.com and click the "Login" button.
   - Choose "Log In With Phone Number."

3. **Use a Google Voice Number:**
   - Provide a Google Voice number for verification.
   - Confirm the text message received on the Google Voice number.

4. **Complete Registration:**
   - Register with an alias name and upload a photo.

### Real-World Application

I have two recent experiences with covert Tinder accounts to share:

#### Human Trafficking Investigation
In a human trafficking investigation, I was asked to assist in tracking a well-known pimp who had recruited several children into prostitution. He was not promoting them on websites due to perceived risks but was posting profiles on Tinder while located at a run-down motel. From several states away, I spoofed my GPS on an Android device to the motel of interest. I set my search settings to females within five miles, aged 18-19. I immediately observed two images of young girls in a shady motel room. After swiping right, I was contacted by the pimp pretending to be one of the girls. We agreed on a price and he disclosed the room number. The local agency began immediate surveillance, obtained a search warrant, and arrested two men and the pimp.

#### Cheating Spouse Investigation
An attorney reached out for assistance in a cheating spouse investigation. He provided images and common locations of the suspect. After several failed attempts, I launched Tinder with the GPS spoofed to the suspect’s office. I claimed to be a woman looking for a man his age and eventually matched with my target. We began a conversation, and the evidence piled up immediately.

### Best Practices for Covert Tinder Accounts

1. **Avoid Using a VPN:**
   - Tinder will send you a text message with a code to verify your number. If you use a VPN, you will be subjected to a series of tests to verify your humanity. These tests are often frustrating and almost always result in failure if using a VOIP number and a VPN.

2. **Provide a Real Cellular Number:**
   - Providing a real cellular number and an internet connection without a VPN can help avoid detection. However, this sacrifices privacy and security.

3. **Profile Photo:**
   - Uploading only one photo and vague information looks suspicious. Avoid using stock photos or images of other people without their consent. I recommend using Fiverr to find individuals willing to provide unique photos for a small fee. Ensure you obtain a signed consent form.

### Accessing Tinder via Web Interface

While Tinder offers web access, it requires either Facebook account information or a mobile telephone number. I advise against connecting any third-party service to a covert Facebook account. Instead, use a Google Voice number.

### Spoofing GPS and Emulators

- **GPS Spoofing:**
  - Tinder has begun blocking GPS spoofing, even if done manually through the browser inspector. Focus more on the network you are connected to.
  - Use an old Android phone with the Tinder app and a "Fake GPS Location" app. Set the desired location before opening Tinder. This method does not work on iPhones due to GPS spoofing restrictions.

- **Emulators:**
  - Tinder actively blocks emulators, so connecting through VirtualBox or Genymotion will not work. A dedicated Android device is required.

### Discord for Investigations

Discord is a free voice, video, and text chat application used by various communities, including those associated with cybercrime. Here’s how to conduct investigations on Discord:

1. **Registering a Discord Account:**
   - Create a Discord account from a public Wi-Fi network without a VPN. Chrome appears less suspicious than Firefox for this purpose.

2. **Setting Up a Discord VM:**
   - Clone your original Windows 10 virtual machine.
   - Install the Discord app and DiscordChatExporter.
   - Connect to the target Discord server and export the chat history using the token key.

3. **Finding and Joining Servers:**
   - Use Disboard (disboard.org) to find open invitations to Discord servers. Conduct a search for relevant terms and join the server using the invitation link.

### Online Prostitution and Escort Review Websites

Craigslist and Backpage were once used for prostitution but have been shut down. Prostitutes and clients have moved to other platforms. Some popular escort review websites include:

- The Erotic Review (theeroticreview.com)
- Escort Fish (escortfish.ch)
- Humaniplex (humaniplex.com)
- iBackpage (ibackpage.com)
- Escort Index (escortindex.com)
- OneBackpage (onebackpage.com)
- Open Adult Directory (openadultdirectory.com)
- Preferred 411 (preferred411.com)
- Sipsap (sipsap.com)
- Skip the Games (skipthegames.com)
- Slixa (slixa.com)
- Stripperweb (stripperweb.com)
- The Other Board (theotherboard.com)
- TS Escorts (tsescorts.com)
- TNABoard (tnaboard.com)
- 5escons (5escons.com)
- Bedpage (bedpage.com)
- City of Love (cityoflove.com)
- CityXGuide (cityxguide.com)
- Craigslist Girls (craigslistgirls.com)
- Eros (eros.com)
- Escort-Ads (escort-ads.com)

These sites are used for communication between clients and prostitutes, leaving detailed reviews of their experiences. They are also useful for law enforcement to track undercover operations and gather evidence.

### Online Newspaper Comments and Craigslist Auctions

- **Online Newspaper Comments:**
  - Most newspapers now use third-party services like Facebook and Disqus for comments. To search for specific content, use custom Google searches with the Disqus system.

- **Craigslist Auctions:**
  - Craigslist is a platform for classified ads and can be used to locate stolen goods. Navigate to the Craigslist site for your area and search within specific categories. For recent thefts, conduct a live search in the "for sale" section.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively use online platforms for investigative purposes while maintaining the necessary level of discretion and security.
