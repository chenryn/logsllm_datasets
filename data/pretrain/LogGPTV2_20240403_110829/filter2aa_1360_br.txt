Real World Application: I have two recent experiences with covert Tinder accounts to share. The first is a 
human trafficking investigation with which I was asked to assist. The investigation unit received information 
that a well-known pimp had recruited several children to enter his world of prostitution. He was not promoting 
them on websites, as he believed it was too risky. Instead, he posted profiles to Tinder while located at a run-
in order to access Tinder from your web browser, several things must be perfectly aligned in order to prevent 
account blocking. Tinder gets bombarded with fraudulent accounts, and their radar for investigative use is very 
sensitive. The following instructions assume that you do not have an existing Tinder account
While this service was once natively available only through a mobile app, they have recc 
account access via their website. However, 1 find this to be full of frustration. In order to access Tinder via their 
web interface, you must provide either Facebook account information or a mobile telephone number. I never 
advise connecting any third-part}' service to any covert Facebook account, so that option is out Instead, you 
can provide a Google Voice number, which is a bit more acceptable. Supply a covert Google Voice telephone 
number and prepare for the issues.
Instead, I keep an old Android phone ready for any Tinder investigations. I have the Tinder app installed along 
with the "Fake GPS Location" app. 1 keep the Tinder app logged in using a covert Google Voice number. Before 
I open Tinder, 1 set my desired location through the Fake GPS Location application. Upon loading Tinder, 1 
can control the search settings through the app. I usually choose to limit the search to a few miles away from 
my target's location. In my experience, this will not work on an iPhone due to GPS spoofing restrictions. Since 
Tinder actively blocks emulators, connecting through VirtualBox or Genymotion does not work. This will 
simply require a dedicated Android device.
These instructions may seem simple, and too good to be true. They are. Tinder has begun blocking any type of 
GPS spoofing, even if done manually through the browser inspector. They focus much more on the networks 
through which you are connected. The previous edition explained ways to spoof GPS within your browser and 
pretend to be at another location. In my experience, these tricks simply do not work anymore. If you are able to 
connect through the web version of Tinder, it is unlikely to be of any use. Furthermore, your "matches" will 
likely be far away from your actual location. Personally, I no longer try to make this work.
First, Tinder will send you a text message with a code to verify your number. Supplying this code to Tinder 
passes the first hurdle. If you are using a VPN, you will immediately be sent to a series of tests to verify you are 
human. If you have been annoyed by Google Captcha pop-ups in the past, Tinder's options take frustration to 
a new level. In most scenarios, you will be asked to complete a series of 20 small tasks. In my experience, 
completing them perfectly results in a failure report 99% of the time. Tinder simply does not like a combination 
of a VOIP number and a VPN. Providing a real cellular number seems to pacify Tinder somewhat Providing a 
true number and internet connection without a VPN seems to make it happy. However, you sacrifice privacy 
and security in order to do so. If you accept these risks, you can proceed with the web-based access to Tinder. 
After I explain the process, I will present my chosen solution.
A section about online dating would not be complete without a reference to Tinder. The simplest explanation 
of Tinder is that it connects you with people in your immediate geographical area who are also using the service. 
Some call it a dating app, some refer to it as a "hook-up" app. Either way, it is probably the most popular dating 
service available today.

The other example I have presents a much different view of Tinder usage. An attorney reached out requesting 
assistance with a cheating spouse investigation. He was looking for evidence which confirmed the husband was 
involved with other women. He provided several images of die man and common locations which he was known 
to frequent. After many failures, I had Tinder launched with the GPS spoofed to the suspect’s office. I claimed 
to be a woman looking for a man his age, and 1 was eventually presented an image of my target. I swiped right, 
as did he, and we began a conversation. The evidence piled up immediately.
Tinder users can optionally create a username within the network. Instead of being limited to the identity of 
"Tom, 30, NYC", a user can claim a specific username such as Tom911. This generates a web profile which can 
be seen publicly (often unknowingly to the user). The following format would display a user with that username. 
Both should connect to active profiles with multiple photos of each target.
• You must receive some type of invite in order to join a server. Once you have an invite, joining is easy 
and covert details are accepted. You can often find generic invite links within related forums or simply 
by asking a member of the server. Administrators will know that you joined, but will only see the details 
you provided during registration.
down motel. From several states away, I spoofed my GPS on my Android device to the motel of interest. I set 
my search settings for females within five miles aged 18-19.1 immediately observed two images of what appeared 
to be young girls in a shady motel room. 1 "swiped right" to indicate interest, and was immediately contacted by 
the pimp pretending to be one of the girls. We agreed on a price and he disclosed the room number. The local 
agency working the case began immediate surveillance while a search warrant was obtained. While waiting, they 
arrested two men before the "date" could begin, and also arrested the pimp after a search warrant was obtained 
for the room.
What photo should you use? First, uploading one photo and vague information to your account looks suspicious. 
Prodding images of other people without their consent is wrong. Using stock photography from the internet 
will quickly get you banned from Tinder. 1 rely heavily on Fiverr (fiverr.com). I search for people willing to send 
unique photos of themselves for a few dollars. 1 once paid a 21-year-old woman $30 for five "selfies" while 
dressed in different outfits. I received a signed consent form allowing me to upload them to Tinder with the 
intent of luring cheating spouses. At first, she assumed I was a pervert with a unique fetish. After my explanation, 
she loved the idea and was eager to assist.
Discord is a free voice, video, and text chat application and digital distribution platform which was originally 
designed for the video gaming community. Today, it is heavily used within various hacking, doxing, and other 
communities associated with cybercrime. Some call it a modern-day IRC replacement. Discord allows users to 
create virtual servers which further divide into text and voice channels. Discord stores unlimited logs of all 
channels within every server. Anybody who joins a Discord server has full access to all server history. Access to 
a Discord server is granted through invites in the form of a URL. Discord is classified as a "deep web" resource, 
as Discord servers are unable to be indexed by conventional search engines such as Google. I present two initial 
thoughts on Discord investigative techniques.
If you open the source code view of these profiles, we can dig deeper. Searching "birth_date"
for user MikeB reveals "1996-11-24" while ""_id" displays "5571c5edb47cba401e0cf68b". We now know the 
date of birth and Tinder user ID of our target. If he should change his name or username, we still have a unique 
identifier which could be checked within a new profile.

I was greeted with a login window asking for the name I wished to use in the channel. I provided OSINTAuthor 
and completed a Captcha. I was immediately given an error which demanded a cellular telephone number in 
order to join this server. This is common when using a VPN, hardened browser, and guest login. Therefore, I 
never recommend this route. Instead, register for a Discord account at https://discord.com/register, but take a 
few precautions. In my experience, creating the account from within Chrome appears less "suspicious" than 
Firefox. Connecting from a network without a VPN seems to allow registration while an IP address from a VPN 
results in another telephone demand. Therefore, I create a handful of accounts any time I am at a hotel or library. 
I create them from within my Windows VM using Chrome on the public Wi-Fi without a VPN. These accounts 
can be stored until needed.

This immediately forwarded to the Discord link at the following address. This is the official invitation link which 
could be shared by members of the channel. I found it through Disboard because someone from the group 
likely posted the details with the intent of increasing usage. If you do not find any servers of interest on Disboard, 
try Discord Me (discord.me).
Let’s conduct a demonstration of finding, joining, and archiving a Discord server. First, I navigated to Disboard 
(disboard.org). This free service indexes numerous Discord servers which have open invitations. I conducted a 
search for the term "osint" and received one result of "Team Omega Cybersecurity and Analysis". The static 
Disboard link was the following.
• Once you are in the server, you should have access to complete chat history since inception. In 2018,1 
was asked to assist the podcast Reply All with an investigation into the OG Users Discord. Members 
of this group stole social network accounts from random people and sold them to each other and the 
public. The primary avenue for communication was through a designated Discord server. The episode 
is tided 130-The Snapchat Thief if you want to hear more.
I prefer to conduct all Discord investigations within their official Windows application while inside a virtual 
machine. Conduct the following steps to replicate my Discord machine.

As a general rule, most people will use the same username across several sites. Craigslist is no exception. If you 
have identified a username of a target, a search on the Craigslist forums is worth a look. Although you will not 
get a result ever}' time you search, the commentary is usually colorful when you do. When you locate a username 
of a target on the Craigslist forums, searching that username on other sites could provide an abundance of 
information.
Discord is not the only platform for this type of communication, but I find it to be the most popular with 
amateur cyber criminals. Slack (slack.com) appears ver}' similar, but it is targeted more toward professionals. 
Riot (about.riot.im) and Tox (tox.chat) each possess encrypted communications and better overall security, but 
adoption is lower than Discord. I believe you should be familiar with all of these environments, and be ready 
for an investigation within any of them. I keep an investigation VM with all four applications installed and 
configured. This can be a huge time-saver when the need arises.
The result is a text-only CSV file with the entire contents of the exported server and channel. You should repeat 
this process for each channel of your target server. In 2019,1 located a Discord server used to share file-sharing 
links to recent data breaches. I exported all of the content, which included thousands of links to mega.nz, Google 
Drive, Dropbox, and other hosts. The day after I created the export, the Discord server was removed due to 
policy violations. However, 1 already had the full export and could investigate the links at my own pace. If 
desired, you could export an HTML report which would be much more graphically pleasing. 1 prefer the CSV 
option because 1 can import and manipulate the text easier than an HTML web page.

Sometimes, these sites are excluded from being indexed by search engines. This can make locating them difficult. 
A new wave of forum search sites fills this void. Board Reader queries many forum communities, message

Craigslist was once used by many prostitutes nationwide as an avenue to meeting "Johns". Likewise, many people 
used the site to locate a prostitute. In 2009, Craigslist was forced to remove the "Erotic Services" section that 
hosted these posts announcing this activity. In 2018, Backpage was forced offline and seized by various 
government agencies. Today, it is difficult to find a post offering prostitution on Craigslist and impossible on 
Backpage. This does not mean that the prostitutes and their clients simply stopped the potentially illegal 
behavior. Instead, they found new resources. There are many sites online that aid in prostitution and human 
trafficking. A few of the big players are listed here. 1 encourage you to investigate which services are applicable 
to your cities of interest.
These types of services may be difficult for some readers to understand. 1 was also surprised when I first found 
them. This is where prostitution clients communicate with each other and leave reviews of their experiences 
with the prostitutes. These "Johns" document the slightest details of the experience including price, cleanliness, 
and accuracy of the photograph in the ad. Furthermore, this is the first location that will announce an undercover 
operation by the police. This is important for law enforcement, as this could create an officer safety issue. It is 
also how the police can determine when a new name or photo should be used in future covert ads. Another 
purpose for this data is to create documentation of the reviews of an arrested prostitute. This can prove to be 
valuable in court for the prosecution of offenses. There are several of these services, and evety metropolitan 
area will have a preferred website by the customers. A Google search of "Escort rexnews Anaheim" will get you 
to the popular options. Of course, replace Anaheim with your city' of interest.

be important to an investigation. In years past, most newspapers hosted their own digital comment delivery’

Real World Application: While participating in an FBI Operation, I focused on locating juvenile prostitutes 
and w’omen forced into the sex industry’ by pimps. One easy’ way to determine if a sex worker wras traveling

system within their website. This often resulted in a large headache while trying to maintain order, prevent feuds 
between readers, and delete direct threats. Today, most news websites use third-party sendees to host these 
comments. The most popular are Facebook and Disqus. When Facebook is utilized, most people use their real 
names and behave better than when using only a username on Disqus. Any complaints about the comment 
activity can be referred to Facebook since they technically store the content. Searching Facebook comments can 
be conducted through the technique previously explained.
In order to search for content within the Disqus comment system, you can conduct a custom Google search. 
First, it is important to understand how the Disqus system is recognized by Google. There is an option to log 
in to a Disqus account and you can "upvote" or "downvote" each comment to show your approval. The words 
visible on this page that were provided by Disqus are important for the search. The word "comments" will be 
visible on every Disqus provided environment and there will also be a link to disqus.com. Therefore, the 
following search on Google should provide any websites that have the Disqus comment delivery system and 
also have a reference to OSINT.
This instructs Google to only display results that contain the keywords "OSINT" and "Disqus" and also contain 
the exact phrase of any number between 1 and 999 followed immediately by the term "comments". This would 
provide results that contain any number of comments with the exception of "0" or over "1000". The "1..999" 
portion is the Google range operator that will display any number within the specified range.
