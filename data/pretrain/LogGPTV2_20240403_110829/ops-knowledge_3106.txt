User: I want to use SSL on Google App Engine. Is there a 3rd-party Python module I must use or can I just use the Google SDK?
Assistant: "Use" SLL for what? Joachim has answered regarding serving your pages over SSL.
If you want an SSL client, then urlfetch allows https URLS. It gives you no control other than the "validate_certificate" boolean parameter, and I don't immediately see any documentation of what CAs/certificates it trusts. Of course it doesn't support any protocol other than HTTPS, but that's in keeping with the fact that in general, GAE does not allow free use of sockets.
