### Analysis of SSL/TLS Connections and Certificate Validity

#### A. Ciphers and Ports
Connections using the RC4 cipher, which lacks Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) support, are still prevalent on certain ports. Other ciphers, such as Camellia, are used in less than 1% of connections and have been omitted for brevity. Ports 6679 and 6667 predominantly use ECDHE ciphers, while port 5269 mainly uses DHE ciphers. These ports were excluded from the analysis to maintain clarity.

**Figure 3** shows a significant number of connections on some ports still using the RC4 stream cipher, despite its known security weaknesses.

#### B. Elliptic Curves and DHE Parameters
- **Elliptic Curves in ECDHE Key Exchanges:**
  - 97.2% of connections use the secp256r1 curve.
  - 2% use the secp384r1 curve.
  - 0.78% use the sect571r1 curve.
  - All these curves are considered at least as strong as 2048-bit RSA, indicating no immediate security concerns.

- **DHE Parameter Sizes:**
  - 76% of connections use 1024-bit parameters.
  - 22% use 2048-bit parameters.
  - 1.4% use 768-bit parameters.
  - While this is an improvement over earlier studies, parameter sizes below 2048 bits are generally discouraged today.

#### C. Certificate Chain Validity
SSL/TLS servers send a certificate chain during the handshake, which includes the host's certificate and potentially intermediate and CA certificates. Common issues include:
- Expired certificates
- Missing intermediate certificates
- Certificates not chaining up to a root certificate
- Self-signed certificates

**Figure 4** and **Figure 5** show the most common certificate errors encountered in active scans and passive monitoring, respectively. The data set includes 295 cases where the same IP and port serve more than one certificate chain, with all certificates sharing the same validity characteristics.

- **Email Protocols:**
  - The ratio of verifiable chains is between 30-40% across all email protocols.
  - This is lower than the reported 60% for web sites on the Alexa Top 1 million list but aligns with findings for the Web PKI as a whole.

- **Chat Protocols:**
  - SMTPS and SUBMISSION have the highest (yet still unsatisfactory) percentage of verifiable certificate chains.
  - IMAP, POP3, and SMTP follow closely behind.
  - XMPP and IRC have much lower rates of verifiable certificate chains, with many IRC servers using self-signed or expired certificates.

#### D. The Case of XMPP
- **XMPP Client-to-Server Services (Ports 5222 and 5223):**
  - The majority of certificates are self-signed.
  - Many of these certificates are associated with proprietary deployments and push services, such as Apple’s push service and Samsung’s push service.

**Figure 6** and **Figure 7** illustrate the likelihood of certificate reuse across different protocols. The results show that many self-signed certificates appear on hundreds or thousands of hosts, suggesting they are default certificates shipped with software.

#### E. Key and Certificate Reuse
- **Certificate Reuse:**
  - 1,096 (17%) of the 6,398 encountered certificates were seen on more than one IP address.
  - The majority of certificate reuses occur on port 25.
  - 78% of certificates seen on at least two hosts are valid, indicating load balancing by hosting providers.

- **Common Names in Invalid Certificates:**
  - **Table VI** lists common names in frequently occurring and invalid certificates for SMTP, IMAP, and XMPP.
  - **Table VII** provides details on invalid Microsoft certificates, including ASes and CIRCL information.

### Conclusion
The analysis highlights several areas of concern, particularly in the use of outdated ciphers and weak DHE parameters. Certificate chain validity remains a significant issue, especially in chat protocols like IRC and XMPP. Certificate reuse is widespread, but many of these reused certificates are valid, suggesting they are used by larger, well-configured providers. Further attention is needed to improve the overall security posture of SSL/TLS implementations.
