I am using Julia for an application in PDE-constrained optimization, and have
run into an issue I haven't seen before, giving a segfault when trying to
return (apparently) from a function call. I only mention the nested functions
because in the optimization setup, I construct functionals using passed data,
and then pass _those_ functionals to my optimization routine. Not sure if that
is creating some issue behind the scenes.
Based on the optimization trace, all of the iterations in the solver are
working correctly, but then something breaks. The embedded PDE solver and
optimization routine have passing unit tests, so I'm (pretty) sure the problem
is not with their separate functionality, but somehow at the interface between
them.
The gist with the backtrace is here
https://gist.github.com/jgoldfar/b311086329af529fff42. The same issue appeared
in version 0.3.0 I've been using for a while, but I figured I'd update to
check if it resolved somehow. I'd be happy to look more into what is causing
the issue on my own if someone could point me in the right direction!
