### Introduction

The market for stolen data has garnered significant attention from researchers, with a growing body of literature focusing on its organization and dynamics. Studies have explored various platforms, including IRC (Franklin et al., 2007; Herley & Florencio, 2010; Holz et al., 2009; Honeynet Research Alliance, 2003; Thomas & Martin, 2006) and forums (Chu et al., 2010; Holt & Lampke, 2010; Motoyama et al., 2011; Yip et al., 2013).

However, few studies have delved into the economic aspects or the organizational structures within these markets. Herley and Florencio (2010) and Wehinger (2011) suggest that multiple markets may operate simultaneously, ranging from low-cost, high-risk markets with minimal entry barriers to high-cost, insulated, and organized markets.

### Research Objectives

This study aims to address the following questions:
1. What are the costs of goods and services in the stolen data market, and what conditions influence this economy?
2. What is the social organization of the market, and how does it impact participants?
3. What are the network structures between individual participants, and how do they compare to other criminal organizations?

### Data Sources
