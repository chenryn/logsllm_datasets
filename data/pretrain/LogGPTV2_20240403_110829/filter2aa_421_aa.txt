Stolen Data Markets 
• There is an increasingly large body of research 
on the organization and dynamics of the 
market for stolen data 
– IRC (Franklin et al., 2007; Herley & Florencio, 
2010; Holz et al., 2009; Honeynet Research 
Alliance, 2003; Thomas & Martin, 2006) 
– Forums (Chu et al., 2010; Holt & Lampke, 2010; 
Motoyama et al., 2011; Yip et al., 2013) 
Stolen Data Markets 
• Few studies have estimated the economics of the 
market or the organizational dynamics present 
• Herley and Florencio (2010) and Wehinger (2011) 
argue that there may be multiple markets operating 
at any point in time 
– Lower priced markets with greater risk for 
participants and minimal barriers to entry 
– Higher priced markets with insularity, trust, and 
organization  
The Present Study 
•This study is designed to address multiple questions: 
– What are the costs for goods and services in this market like 
and what conditions impact this economy? 
– What is the social organization of the market and how does it 
affect participants? 
– What are the network structures between individual 
participants and how do they resemble other criminal 
organizations?
