4. Other ways to hide backdoors
In some 404 pages or places that are hard to find (such as login), use the command
"echo *cat /f** to write the flag to an HTML tag (see Fig 11.3), and then visit a
non-existent page or login page to get the ffag as shown in Fig 11.4.
You can also hide backdoors with HTML tags.
class=*btn btn-primary">
′ value=*Sign Ina
Then you can use regular expression to extract the flag.

5. Copy function
The essence of the AWD competition is to get the flag, so if writing web shells is too
obvious, file operations can be used as well. For example, you can add the following
statement to index.php.
copy (* /flag′ , */vax/w/htm1/ 1 . txt) ;
Then accessing index.php will generate .1.txt as a flag file in the current directory.
Of course, to avoid being accessed by other teams, you can add the following
statement to index.php or any other file.
if (isset (S_Gsr [ux1′]) )(
unlink ( 1.txt) ;
In this way, the .1.txt can be deleted with a GET request immediately after the
content of the flag is read to avoid being found and used by other participants.
6. Abnormal backdoors
In AWD competitions, it is also important to maintain the privileges of the target
machine.
 msfinsta11 &s chmod 755
Enter the password again, see Fig. 12.2.
After the installation, enter the command “msfconsole”, and you will be
prompted to create a new database or not. After entering "yes", the database will
be initialized, see Fig. 12.3
The actual use of Metasploit requires a combination of the modules described
above. The general process for launching an attack on a target is: scan the target
system for available vulnerabilities; select and configure an exploit module; select
and configure an attack payload module that is suitable to the target system; and
execute the attack.

information you collect, the higher your chances of penetration success. The fol-
lowing section describes how to perform a port scan using the auxiliary module.
A port scan is performed using the auxiliary module, and the result of the scan
allows us to know which ports are listened to on the target, and then determine the
service based on the corresponding port before we can proceed to the next stage of
exploitation.
First use the search command to search for available port scanning modules, see
Fig. 12.4 for a list of available scanners.
Take TCP scan module as an example. Use the use command to select the
module, and the show options command to view the parameters that need to be
set, see Fig. 12.5.
The set command is used to fill in the values of the parameters, the unset
command is used to delete the value of a parameter. The setg and unsetg commands
are used to set or unset a global parameter values. When you need to set a value for

any of the parameter, it is highly recommended to read the description firstly. In
Fig. 12.6 is a list of ports that are being listened on.
There are a large number of service-based scanning modules to choose from
when scanning for services running on a target, and a large number of scanning
modules can be found by simply searching for scanner. The reader is advised to try
out the different scan modules to understand their usage and functionality. They are
used in much the same way, as shown in Fig. 12.7.
The results of probing with the porscan module cannot accurately determine
what services are running on the target, so Nmap can also be used in Metasploit. In
practice, you can use Nmap by typing the command *nmap"d into msfconsole (which
should be installed beforehand), see Fig. 12.8.
In addition, every operating system or application has a variety of vulnerabilities.
Although developers are quickly enough to develop patches and provide updates to
