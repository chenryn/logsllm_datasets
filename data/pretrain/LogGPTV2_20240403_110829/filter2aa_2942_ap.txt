PE-2 
PHYSICAL ACCESS AUTHORIZATIONS 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Enterprises should ensure that only authorized individuals with a need 
for physical access have access to information, systems, or data centers (e.g., sensitive or classified). Such 
authorizations should specify what the individual is permitted or not permitted to do with regard to their 
physical access (e.g., view, alter/configure, insert something, connect something, remove, etc.). 
Agreements should address physical access authorization requirements, and the enterprise should require its 
prime contractors to implement this control and flow down this requirement to relevant sub-tier contractors. 
Authorization for non-federal employees should follow an approved protocol, which includes 
documentation of the authorization and specifies any prerequisites or constraints that pertain to such 
authorization (e.g., individual must be escorted by a federal employee, individual must be badged, 
individual is permitted physical access during normal business hours, etc.).

PHYSICAL ACCESS AUTHORIZATIONS | ACCESS BY POSITION OR ROLE 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Role-based authorizations for physical access should include 
federal (e.g., agency/department employees) and non-federal employees (e.g., suppliers, developers, 
system integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers). 
When role-based authorization is used, the type and level of access allowed for that role or position 
must be pre-established and documented.  
Level(s): 2, 3 
PE-3 
PHYSICAL ACCESS CONTROL 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Physical access control should include individuals and enterprises 
engaged in the enterprise’s supply chain. A vetting process based on enterprise-defined requirements and 
policy should be in place prior to granting access to the supply chain infrastructure and any relevant 
elements. Access establishment, maintenance, and revocation processes should meet enterprise access 
control policy rigor. The speed of revocation for suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system 
service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers who need access to physical facilities and 
data centers – either enterprise-owned or external service provider-owned – should be managed in 
accordance with the activities performed in their contracts. Prompt revocation is critical when either 
individual or enterprise need no longer exists.  
Level(s): 2, 3 
Control Enhancement(s):

PHYSICAL ACCESS CONTROL | SYSTEM ACCESS 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Physical access controls should be extended to contractor 
personnel. Any contractor resources that provid services support with physical access to the supply 
chain infrastructure and any relevant elements should adhere to access controls. Policies and 
procedures should be consistent with those applied to employee personnel with similar levels of 
physical access. 
Level(s): 2, 3 
(2) 
PHYSICAL ACCESS CONTROL | FACILITY AND SYSTEMS  
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: When determining the extent, frequency, and/or randomness of 
security checks of facilities, enterprises should account for exfiltration risks that result from covert 
listening devices. Such devices may include wiretaps, roving bugs, cell site simulators, and other 
eavesdropping technologies that can transfer sensitive information out of the enterprise. 
Level(s): 2, 3 
(3) 
PHYSICAL ACCESS CONTROL | TAMPER PROTECTION 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Tamper protection is critical for reducing cybersecurity risk in 
products. The enterprise should implement validated tamper protection techniques within the supply 
chain. For critical products, the enterprise should require and assess whether and to what extent a 
supplier has implemented tamper protection mechanisms. The assessment may also include whether 
and how such mechanisms are required and applied by the supplier’s upstream supply chain entities.

MONITORING PHYSICAL ACCESS 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Individuals who physically access the enterprise or external service 
provider’s facilities, data centers, information, or physical asset(s) – including via the supply chain – may 
be employed by the enterprise’s employees, on-site or remotely located contractors, visitors, other third 
parties (e.g., maintenance personnel under contract with the contractor enterprise), or an individual 
affiliated with an enterprise in the upstream supply chain. The enterprise should monitor these individuals’ 
activities to reduce cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain or require monitoring in agreements.

PE-16 DELIVERY AND REMOVAL 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: This control enhancement reduces cybersecurity risks that arise during 
the physical delivery and removal of hardware components from the enterprise’s information systems or 
supply chain. This includes transportation security, the validation of delivered components, and the 
verification of sanitization procedures. Risk-based considerations include component mission criticality as 
well as the development, operational, or maintenance environment (e.g., classified integration and test 
laboratory).  
Level(s): 3 
PE-17 ALTERNATIVE WORK SITE 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: The enterprise should incorporate protections to guard against 
cybersecurity risks associated with enterprise employees or contractor personnel within or accessing the 
supply chain infrastructure using alternative work sites. This can include third-party personnel who may 
also work from alternative worksites.   
Level(s): 3 
PE-18 LOCATION OF SYSTEM COMPONENTS 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Physical and environmental hazards or disruptions have an impact on 
the availability of products that are or will be acquired and physically transported to the enterprise’s 
locations. For example, enterprises should incorporate the manufacturing, warehousing, or the distribution 
location of information system components that are critical for agency operations when planning for 
alternative suppliers for these components. 
Level(s): 1, 2, 3 
Related Controls: CP-6, CP-7 
PE-20 ASSET MONITORING AND TRACKING 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: The enterprise should, whenever possible and practical, use asset 
location technologies to track systems and components transported between entities across the supply 
chain, between protected areas, or in storage awaiting implementation, testing, maintenance, or disposal. 
Methods include RFID, digital signatures, or blockchains. These technologies help protect against: 
a. 
Diverting the system or component for counterfeit replacement; 
b. The loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the system or component function and data 
(including data contained within the component and data about the component); and

Level(s): 2, 3 
PE-23 FACILITY LOCATION 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Enterprises should incorporate the facility location (e.g., data centers) 
when assessing risks associated with suppliers. Factors may include geographic location (e.g., Continental 
United States [CONUS], Outside the Continental United States [OCONUS]), physical protections in place 
at one or more of the relevant facilities, local management and control of such facilities, environmental 
hazard potential (e.g., located in a high-risk seismic zone), and alternative facility locations. Enterprises 
should also assess whether the location of a manufacturing or distribution center could be influenced by 
geopolitical, economic, or other factors. For critical vendors or products, enterprises should specifically 
address any requirements or restrictions concerning the facility locations of the vendors (or their upstream 
supply chain providers) in contracts and flow down this requirement to relevant sub-level contractors.

FAMILY: PLANNING 
[FIPS 200] specifies the Planning minimum security requirement as follows: 
Organizations must develop, document, periodically update, and implement security 
plans for organizational information systems that describe the security controls in place 
or planned for the information systems and the rules of behavior for individuals 
accessing the information systems.  
C-SCRM should influence security planning, including activities such as security architecture, 
coordination with other enterprise entities, and development of System Security Plans. When 
acquiring products and services from suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system 
service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers, enterprises may be sharing 
facilities with those enterprises, have employees of these entities on the enterprise’s premises, or 
use information systems that belong to those entities. In these and other applicable situations, 
enterprises should coordinate their security planning activities with these entities to ensure 
appropriate protection of an enterprise’s processes, information systems, and systems and 
components traversing the supply chain. When establishing security architectures, enterprises 
should provide for component and supplier diversity to manage cybersecurity risks throughout 
the supply chain to include suppliers going out of business or stopping the production of specific 
components. Finally, as stated in Section 2 and Appendix C, enterprises should integrate C-
SCRM controls into their Risk Response Frameworks (Level 1 and Level 2) as well as their C-
SCRM Plans (Level 3).  
PL-1 
POLICY AND PROCEDURES 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: The security planning policy and procedures should integrate C-SCRM. 
This includes creating, disseminating, and updating the security policy, operational policy, and procedures 
for C-SCRM to shape acquisition or development requirements and the follow-on implementation, 
operations, and maintenance of systems, system interfaces, and network connections. The C-SCRM policy 
and procedures provide inputs into and take guidance from the C-SCRM Strategy and Implementation Plan 
at Level 1 and the System Security Plan and C-SCRM plan at Level 3. In Level 3, ensure that the full 
SDLC is covered from the C-SCRM perspective.   
Level(s): 2 
Related Controls: PL-2, PM-30 
PL-2 
SYSTEM SECURITY AND PRIVACY PLANS  
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: The system security plan (SSP) should integrate C-SCRM. The 
enterprise may choose to develop a stand-alone C-SCRM plan for an individual system or integrate SCRM 
controls into their SSP. The system security plan and/or system-level C-SCRM plan provide inputs into and 
take guidance from the C-SCRM Strategy and Implementation Plan at Level 1 and the C-SCRM policy at 
Level 1 and Level 2. In addition to internal coordination, the enterprise should coordinate with suppliers, 
developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service 
providers to develop and maintain their SSPs. For example, building and operating a system requires a 
significant coordination and collaboration between the enterprise and system integrator personnel. Such 
coordination and collaboration should be addressed in the system security plan or stand-alone C-SCRM 
plan. These plans should also consider that suppliers or external service providers may not be able to

customize to the acquirer’s requirements. It is recommended that suppliers, developers, system integrators, 
external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers also develop C-SCRM plans 
for non-federal (i.e., contractor) systems that are processing federal agency information and flow down this 
requirement to relevant sub-level contractors.  
Section 2, Appendix C, and Appendix D provide guidance on C-SCRM strategies, policies, and plans. 
Controls in this publication (NIST SP 800-161, Rev. 1) should be used for the C-SCRM portion of the SSP.

PL-4 
RULES OF BEHAVIOR 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: The rules of behavior apply to contractor personnel and internal agency 
personnel. Contractor enterprises are responsible for ensuring that their employees follow applicable rules 
of behavior. Individual contractors should not be granted access to agency systems or data until they have 
acknowledged and demonstrated compliance with this control. Failure to meet this control can result in the 
removal of access for such individuals. 
Level(s): 2, 3 
PL-7 
CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: The concept of operations (CONOPS) should describe how the 
enterprise intends to operate the system from the perspective of C-SCRM. It should integrate C-SCRM and 
be managed and updated throughout the applicable system’s SDLC to address cybersecurity risks 
throughout the supply chain. 
Level(s): 3 
PL-8 
SECURITY AND PRIVACY ARCHITECTURES 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Security and privacy architecture defines and directs the implementation 
of security and privacy-protection methods, mechanisms, and capabilities to the underlying systems and 
networks, as well as the information system that is being created. Security architecture is fundamental to C-
SCRM because it helps to ensure that security is built-in throughout the SDLC. Enterprises should consider 
implementing zero-trust architectures and should ensure that the security architecture is well understood by 
system developers/engineers and system security engineers. This control applies to both federal agency and 
non-federal agency employees.

 SECURITY AND PRIVACY ARCHITECTURES | SUPPLIER DIVERSITY 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Supplier diversity provides options for addressing information 
security and supply chain concerns. The enterprise should incorporate this control as it relates to 
suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related 
service providers.  
The enterprise should plan for the potential replacement of suppliers, developers, system integrators, 
external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers in case one is no longer 
able to meet the enterprise’s requirements (e.g., company goes out of business or does not meet 
contractual obligations). Where applicable, contracts should be worded so that different parts can be

replaced with a similar model with similar prices from a different manufacturer if certain events occur 
(e.g., obsolescence, poor performance, production issues, etc.).  
Incorporate supplier diversity for off-the-shelf (commercial or government) components during 
acquisition security assessments. The evaluation of alternatives should include, for example, feature 
parity, interoperability, commodity components, and the ability to provide multiple delivery paths. For 
example, having the source code, build scripts, and tests for a software component could enable an 
enterprise to assign someone else to maintain it, if necessary.

CENTRAL MANAGEMENT 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: C-SCRM controls are managed centrally at Level 1 through the C-
SCRM Strategy and Implementation Plan and at Level 1 and Level 2 through the C-SCRM Policy. The 
C-SCRM PMO described in Section 2 centrally manages C-SCRM controls at Level 1 and Level. At 
Level 3, C-SCRM controls are managed on an information system basis though the SSP and/or C-
SCRM Plan.

PL-10 BASELINE SELECTION 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Enterprises should include C-SCRM controls in their control 
baselines. Enterprises should identify and select C-SCRM controls based on the C-SCRM 
requirements identified within each of the levels. A C-SCRM PMO may assist in identifying C-SCRM 
control baselines that meet common C-SCRM requirements for different groups, communities of 
interest, or the enterprise as a whole.

FAMILY: PROGRAM MANAGEMENT 
[FIPS 200] does not specify Program Management minimum security requirements. 
[NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5] states that “the program management controls…are implemented at 
the enterprise level and not directed at individual information systems.” Those controls apply to 
the entire enterprise (i.e., federal agency) and support the enterprise’s overarching information 
security program. Program management controls support and provide input and feedback to 
enterprise-wide C-SCRM activities. 
All program management controls should be applied in a C-SCRM context. Within federal 
agencies, the C-SCRM PMO function or similar is responsible for implementing program 
management controls. Section 3 provides guidance on the C-SCRM PMO and its functions and 
responsibilities.

INFORMATION SECURITY PROGRAM LEADERSHIP ROLE   
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: The senior information security officer (e.g., CISO) and senior agency 
official responsible for acquisition (e.g., Chief Acquisition Officer [CAO] or Senior Procurement Executive 
[SPE]) have key responsibilities for C-SCRM and the overall cross-enterprise coordination and 
collaboration with other applicable senior personnel within the enterprise, such as the CIO, the head of 
facilities/physical security, and the risk executive (function). This coordination should occur regardless of 
the specific department and agency enterprise structure and specific titles of relevant senior personnel. The 
coordination could be executed by the C-SCRM PMO or another similar function. Section 2 provides more 
guidance on C-SCRM roles and responsibilities.

INFORMATION SECURITY AND PRIVACY RESOURCES  
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: An enterprise’s C-SCRM program requires dedicated, sustained funding 
and human resources to successfully implement agency C-SCRM requirements. Section 3 of this document 
provides guidance on dedicated funding for C-SCRM programs. The enterprise should also integrate C-
SCRM requirements into major IT investments to ensure that funding is appropriately allocated through the 
capital planning and investment request process. For example, should an RFID infrastructure be required to 
enhance C-SCRM to secure and improve the inventory or logistics management efficiency of the 
enterprise’s supply chain, appropriate IT investments would likely be required to ensure successful 
planning and implementation. Other examples include any investment into the development or test 
environment for critical components. In such cases, funding and resources are needed to acquire and 
maintain appropriate information systems, networks, and components to meet specific C-SCRM 
requirements that support the mission.

SYSTEM INVENTORY  
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Having a current system inventory is foundational for C-SCRM. Not 
having a system inventory may lead to the enterprise’s inability to identify system and supplier criticality, 
which would result in an inability to conduct C-SCRM activities. To ensure that all applicable suppliers are 
identified and categorized for criticality, enterprises should include relevant supplier information in the 
system inventory and maintain its currency and accuracy. Enterprises should require their prime contractors 
to implement this control and flow down this requirement to relevant sub-tier contractors. Departments and 
agencies should refer to Appendix F to implement this guidance in accordance with Executive Order
