### Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM) Practices for Systems and Organizations

#### Physical Protection and Audit
- **Control:** Ensure that the physical interfaces of the supply chain have adequate protection and are subject to regular audits.
- **Level(s):** 1, 2, 3
- **Control ID:** PE-2

#### Physical Access Authorizations
- **Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance:**
  - Enterprises should ensure that only authorized individuals with a legitimate need for physical access can enter information systems or data centers, especially those containing sensitive or classified information.
  - Authorizations should clearly specify what the individual is permitted or not permitted to do (e.g., view, alter/configure, insert, connect, remove, etc.).
  - Agreements should include requirements for physical access authorizations, and enterprises should require their prime contractors to implement these controls and flow down these requirements to sub-tier contractors.
  - Non-federal employees should follow an approved protocol, including documentation of authorization and any prerequisites or constraints (e.g., escorted by a federal employee, badged, access during business hours, etc.).
- **Level(s):** 2, 3
- **Reference:** NIST SP 800-161r1, Section 116

#### Role-Based Physical Access Authorizations
- **Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance:**
  - Role-based authorizations should apply to both federal (e.g., agency/department employees) and non-federal employees (e.g., suppliers, developers, system integrators, external service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers).
  - The type and level of access allowed for each role or position must be pre-established and documented.
- **Level(s):** 2, 3

#### Physical Access Control
- **Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance:**
  - Physical access control should cover all individuals and enterprises involved in the supply chain.
  - A vetting process based on enterprise-defined requirements and policies should be in place before granting access to the supply chain infrastructure.
  - Access establishment, maintenance, and revocation processes should align with the enterprise's access control policy.
  - Revocation of access for suppliers, developers, system integrators, and other service providers should be managed promptly when no longer needed.
- **Level(s):** 2, 3
- **Control Enhancement:**
  - **System Access:** Extend physical access controls to contractor personnel, ensuring they adhere to the same policies and procedures as employees with similar levels of access.
  - **Facility and Systems Security Checks:** Consider exfiltration risks from covert listening devices such as wiretaps, roving bugs, cell site simulators, and other eavesdropping technologies.
  - **Tamper Protection:** Implement validated tamper protection techniques within the supply chain, especially for critical products. Assess and require suppliers to implement tamper protection mechanisms, including upstream supply chain entities.
