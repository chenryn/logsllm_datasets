### System Security and Cryptographic Enhancements

The system, with its real semantics presented separately, ensures CTA (Confidentiality, Tamper, and Availability) security and protection against leveraged forgery. Additionally, there is ongoing research aimed at enhancing the security guarantees of existing cryptosystems to defend against more powerful adversaries. For instance, Chosen Ciphertext Attack (CCA) [43] security is designed to protect against adversaries who can observe the decryption of arbitrary ciphertexts. CCA security is essential in systems where an adversary can monitor some or all of the effects of decrypting arbitrary ciphertexts.

In contrast, Clio's security guarantees are based on a precise definition of the adversary's capabilities within the system. Specifically, it ensures that an adversary cannot gain any information about the decryption of confidential values due to Information Flow Control (IFC) mechanisms. The results of such decryptions are protected by labels that are more confidential than what the adversary has access to. Consequently, Clio only requires a CPA (Chosen Plaintext Attack) secure cryptosystem to achieve CTA security.

### Related Systems

**DStar [65]**: This system extends decentralized IFC to distributed environments. Each DStar node includes an exporter responsible for network communication, which also establishes the security categories trusted by the node through private and public keys.

**Fabric [34]**: Fabric is a platform and a statically-checked, fine-grained IFC language that supports the secure transfer of both data and code using cryptographic mechanisms. Unlike Fabric, Clio provides coarse-grained IFC and uses DC (Decentralized Control) labels instead of the DLM (Decentralized Label Model). Both DStar and Fabric lack a formal basis for the security of their cryptographic implementations, which is understandable given their more ambitious and complex scenarios, such as decentralized information-flow control in distributed systems.

### Remote Storage and Information Leakage

While data can be stored and retrieved cryptographically, information can still be leaked through access patterns. Private Information Retrieval (PIR) protocols aim to prevent such leaks by hiding queries and answers from potentially malicious servers [16], similar to Clio's threat model. For performance reasons [42, 50], some approaches rely on a small trusted execution environment provided by hardware [20, 58] to support oblivious querying of the data store [9, 52, 62]. This technique is used in various applications, including oblivious computing [35], online advertising [11], and credit networks [38].

However, if clients are malicious, their code may leak information through access patterns. To mitigate this, we ensure that communication with the store occurs in non-sensitive contexts. Our language-based techniques can also be extended to require untrusted code to follow an oblivious protocol.

### Conclusion

Clio is a computationally secure, coarse-grained dynamic information-flow control library that uses cryptography to protect the confidentiality and integrity of data. The use of cryptography is abstracted from the language operations and controlled through familiar constructs in an existing IFC library, LIO. We present a novel proof technique that combines standard programming language and cryptographic proof methods to demonstrate the interaction between high-level security guarantees provided by IFC and low-level guarantees offered by cryptographic mechanisms. A prototype implementation of Clio is available as a Haskell library extending LIO, demonstrating its practicality. Clio enables programmers who are not expert cryptographers to use cryptography securely.
