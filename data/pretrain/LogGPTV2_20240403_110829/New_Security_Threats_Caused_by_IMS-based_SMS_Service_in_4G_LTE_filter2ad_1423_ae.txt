### Concern and Market Share
Together, they account for more than 45% of the market share [29]. Our experimental results indicate that, similar to OP-II, OP-III employs IPSec to secure the SIP session. At OP-III, vulnerabilities V1, V2, and V3 are present, but V4 is not. We also discovered that the IMS server consistently replaces the originator's phone number with the sender’s number, regardless of the number assigned on the phone. For OP-IV, we did not observe support for IMS-based SMS on our test phones.

### Could TrustZone Be a Solution?
TrustZone [5], a hardware-based security technology for ARM processors, could be a potential solution for IMS-based SMS issues. It partitions hardware into two worlds: trusted and non-trusted, thereby isolating trusted software, data, and hardware from the non-trusted world. In the trusted world, a secure network communication [25] can be established, such as the device's communication with the IMS server, or the SMS client can be placed. As a result, neither an attacker nor malware can access the SIP session information of SMS. However, there are three concerns:
1. **Feasibility**: The feasibility of TrustZone is processor-dependent, so it does not work for all devices. Enabling it in existing devices requires a firmware update, which not all users are willing to perform.
2. **Overhead**: There is an overhead associated with switching between the two worlds. Whether to employ TrustZone should depend on this overhead, which needs to be evaluated based on the SMS client's behavior.
3. **Outbound Authentication**: An outbound authentication issue [42] may also arise. Even if TrustZone can handle security functions and/or secret keys, it is challenging for it to authenticate all requests coming from the non-trusted world. These concerns will be addressed in future work.

### Premium SMS Spoofing Attack
Premium SMS [32] provides third-party services (e.g., charitable donations, TV voting, financial/stock information) via SMS, with carriers charging higher rates than for normal SMS. Launching a premium SMS spoofing attack can increase the victim's bill, resulting in monetary loss. The unauthorized ARC donation attack presented in Section 5.2 is an example of a premium SMS spoofing attack. However, this type of attack may not work for all carriers, as several major US carriers have stopped charging for most premium text messages [6].

### Similarity to MMS Spoofing Threat
People may think that the MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service) spoofing threat identified in earlier works is similar to the SMS spoofing introduced here. However, they are fundamentally different due to their distinct protocols and security mechanisms.

### Related Work
In this section, we review related work in the security areas of LTE networks, VoLTE (voice over LTE, an IMS-based voice service), and SMS. Several previous studies [13, 22, 28, 41] have examined the security issues of LTE networks. Shaik et al. [41] exploited vulnerabilities in the LTE access network to expose mobile users' locations. Dabrowski et al. showed that once a phone's IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity) is exposed to a rogue base station, the phone can be tracked, and proposed solutions to secure the access network. However, our work focuses on the security vulnerabilities of the core network (i.e., IMS system) and mobile software (i.e., mobile OS and IMS client), rather than those of the radio access network. Two recent surveys [22, 28] focus on the security vulnerabilities in the LTE network, but our discovered vulnerabilities and attacks are not covered in them.

Several studies [23, 24] have explored VoLTE security issues, identifying vulnerabilities in VoLTE devices and infrastructure. They demonstrated that adversaries can gain free data service by delivering data packets through the signaling or voice channel of VoLTE and launch DoS attacks against VoLTE. There are three key differences from our work:
1. **Focus on IMS-based SMS**: Our work examines IMS-based SMS service, not IMS-based voice service (i.e., VoLTE).
2. **IMS Signaling Protocol**: Our work focuses on the vulnerabilities of the IMS signaling protocol, rather than those of the IMS control/data channels, which are the focus of the VoLTE studies.
3. **Large-Scale Attacks**: The vulnerabilities discovered in our work can be exploited to launch large-scale attacks, causing monetary loss or privacy leakage to a large number of people, not just individual attacks.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the security vulnerabilities of IMS-based SMS service in operational networks.

### Security Issues of SMS Service
The security of SMS services has been a hot research topic in recent years. Several studies [14, 31, 40] have focused on the (in)security of mobile two-factor authentication via SMS or other channels. Other research includes defending against user privacy leakage from SMS [34], faking SMS configurations [37], launching attacks against mobile devices from fake network infrastructure [45], DoS attacks against mobile networks by sending a large number of SMS messages from the Internet [15, 49], devising malware to abuse SMS [4, 19, 27], embedding malware/virus into SMS messages [8, 9], and man-in-the-middle attacks via SMS [20, 26, 30, 33, 39]. Unlike these, our work focuses on IMS-based SMS, not CS-based SMS or Internet-based SMS.

### Conclusion
In this work, we examine the security implications of IMS-based SMS. We discovered several new vulnerabilities in the IMS system and mobile OS. Although there are security measures deemed effective for legacy SMS, they do not adequately protect IMS-based SMS. We show that these vulnerabilities can be exploited to launch attacks against mobile users and carrier networks. Users may suffer from SMS spoofing and DoS attacks, while carrier networks may be subject to spamming attacks.

Moreover, the SMS threat can propagate to SMS-powered services. Most service providers rely on SMS to authenticate mobile users, assuming that SMS messages cannot be abused. These services may lack runtime authentication or have weak authorization, making them vulnerable to SMS threats. Users may face account hijacking and unauthorized donations, while providers may risk goodwill impairment. We demonstrate that simple attacks can be effective in practice. A comprehensive solution requires coordinated efforts among all involved parties. Any party that fails to enforce necessary security mechanisms timely will contribute to security threats and unexpected damages.

### Updates
We have reported the identified issues to OP-I, Facebook, LG, and Samsung, and worked with OP-I and Facebook to address their issues. According to OP-I's security patches, there are two remedies:
1. **Hiding the IMS Server's IP Address**: The IMS server's IP address is hidden from the routing table, making it difficult for malware without root access to know where to send forged SIP messages.
2. **Locked Bootloader**: OP-I adopts a locked bootloader [18] to prevent the phone from being rooted, thus protecting the IPSec of the SIP session.

Additionally, OP-I plans to deploy a network-based solution, which securely binds the originator's phone number and IP address, in October 2016. For Facebook, users can specify a secret code for the Facebook Text service, though it is disabled by default. Facebook has also removed the add-a-friend and like-a-page features from the service. The security teams at LG and Samsung are currently investigating the security issues we reported.

### Appendix
We studied 40 popular SMS-powered services across 17 distinct industries, including grocery, banking, social networks, and retailing, at OP-I in the US. We found that 28 out of 40 services (e.g., Walmart, Target, Facebook, FedEx) are vulnerable to IMS-based SMS attacks due to a lack of runtime authentication (§5.1) or weak authorization (§5.2, §5.3). The detailed results are summarized in Table 2. The vulnerable services can be classified into two categories: notification-based and request-based. Notification-based services (e.g., SMS advertising, flight status notifications) may suffer from unauthorized subscription attacks (e.g., The Home Depot's SMS advertising in §5.3), potentially damaging the provider's goodwill. Request-based services (e.g., account manipulation, donation requests) may suffer from account hijacking (e.g., Facebook account hijacking in §5.1), unauthorized donations (e.g., unauthorized ARC donation in §5.2), or other unauthorized uses of the service.
