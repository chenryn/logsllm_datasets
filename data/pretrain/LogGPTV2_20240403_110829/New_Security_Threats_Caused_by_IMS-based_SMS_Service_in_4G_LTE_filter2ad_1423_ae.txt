concern. They together take more than 45% of market share [29].
Our experimental results show that similar to OP-II, OP-III uses
IPSec to secure the SIP session. At OP-III, Vulnerabilities V1,
V2 and V3 exist, but V4 does not. We further discover that the
IMS server always replaces the originator phone number with the
sender’s number, no matter what number is assigned to it on the
phone. As for OP-IV, we do not observe that the IMS-based SMS
is supported on our test phones.
Could TrustZone be a solution? TrustZone [5], a hardware-based
security technology of ARM processors, could be a candidate so-
lution for the IMS-based SMS issues. It partitions hardware into
two worlds, trusted and non-trusted, thereby separating trusted soft-
ware, data and hardware from the non-trusted world. In the trusted
world, a secure network communication [25], such as the device’s
communication with the IMS server, can be built, or the SMS client
can be placed. As a result, neither is the attacker able to get the SIP
session information of SMS, nor does the malware have a chance
to sneak into the SIP session. However, it has three concerns. First,
the feasibility of TrustZone is processor-dependent, so it does not
work for all the devices. Moreover, enabling it in the existing de-
vices requires the ﬁrmware update, which not all users are will-
ing to do. Second, there exists an overhead of the switch between
two worlds, so whether to employ TrustZone should depend on
the overhead, which should be evaluated by considering the SMS
client’s behaviors. Third, an outbound authentication issue [42]
can also exist. Even if TrustZone can deal with security functions
and/or secret keys, it is hard for TrustZone to authenticate all the re-
quests coming from the non-trusted world. We will consider these
concerns in our future work.
Premium SMS spooﬁng attack The premium SMS [32] is to
provide third-party providers’ services (e.g., charitable donations,
TV voting, ﬁnancial/stock information, etc.) to users via SMS, and
carriers charge them at the prices higher than normal SMS. There-
fore, launching the attack of premium SMS spooﬁng can increase
the victim’s bill, thereby resulting in his/her monetary loss. The at-
tack of unauthorized ARC donation presented in Section 5.2 is one
of the premium SMS spooﬁng attacks. However, this type of attack
may not work for all the carriers, since several major US carriers
have stopped charging for most premium text messages [6].
Similar to MMS spooﬁng threat? People may think that the
MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service) spooﬁng threat identiﬁed
in early works is similar to the SMS spooﬁng introduced in this
work. However, they are totally different, since they root in differ-
ent protocols and security mechanisms.
8. RELATED WORK
In this section, we present related work in the security areas of
LTE network, VoLTE (voice over LTE, an IMS-based voice ser-
vice), and SMS. Several previous works [13, 22, 28, 41] have ex-
amined the security issues of LTE network. Shaik et al. [41] ex-
ploited the vulnerabilities of LTE access network to expose the mo-
bile user’s location. Dabrowski et al. showed that once the phone’s
IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity) is exposed to the
rogue base station the phone can be tracked, and proposed solutions
to secure the access network. However, our work focuses on the se-
curity vulnerabilities of the core network (i.e., IMS system) and the
mobile software (i.e., mobile OS and IMS client), rather than those
of the radio access network. Two recent surveys [22, 28] focus on
the security vulnerabilities that exist in the LTE network, but our
discovered vulnerabilities and attacks are not presented in them.
There have been several works [23, 24] which study the VoLTE
security issues. They identiﬁed several vulnerabilities of the VoLTE
device and infrastructure, and further showed that the adversary can
gain free data service by delivering data packets through the signal-
ing or voice channel of VoLTE, and launch the DoS attack against
VoLTE. There are three major differences from our work. First,
our work looks into IMS-based SMS service, but not IMS-based
voice service (i.e., VoLTE). Second, our work focuses on the vul-
nerabilities of IMS signaling protocol, rather than those of IMS
control/data channels, which are the focuses of those two VoLTE
works. Third, the discovered vulnerabilities in our work can be ex-
ploited to launch large-scale attacks, which could cause monetary
loss or privacy leakage to a large number of people, but not only
individual attacks they focus. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the ﬁrst work that studies the security vulnerabilities of IMS-based
SMS service in the operational networks.
The security issues of SMS service are hot research topics in re-
cent years. There are several works [14, 31, 40] which focus on the
(in)security of mobile two-factor authentication via SMS or other
channels. The authors in the work [35] study the security prac-
tices of benign SMS services, and the malicious misuse of the SMS
ecosystem. Other research studies include defending against the
threats of user privacy leakage from the SMS [34], faking SMS con-
ﬁgurations [37], launching attacks against the mobile device from
fake network infrastructure [45], launching DoS attack against the
mobile network by sending a large number of SMS messages from
the Internet [15,49], devising the malware to abuse SMS [4,19,27],
embedding malware/virus into the SMS message [8, 9] and man-
in-the-middle attacks via SMS [20, 26, 30, 33, 39], to name a few.
Different from them, our work focuses on the IMS-based SMS, but
not the CS-based SMS or the Internet-based SMS.
9. CONCLUSION
In this work, we examine the security implications of IMS-based
SMS. Several new vulnerabilities are discovered from IMS system
and mobile OS. Though there exist security shields deemed effec-
tive for the legacy SMS, they hardly protect the IMS-based SMS.
We show that the vulnerabilities can be exploited to launch attacks
against mobile users and carrier networks. The users may suffer
from the attacks of SMS spooﬁng and DoS, whereas the carrier
networks may be under the spamming attack.
Moreover, the SMS threat can propagate to SMS-powered ser-
vices. Most service providers rely on SMS to authenticate mobile
users so that they may assume SMS messages cannot be abused.
The services may thus have no runtime authentication or weak au-
thorization, thereby being easily abused by the SMS threat. The
users may suffer from account hijacking and unauthorized dona-
tion, whereas the providers may bear the risks of goodwill impair-
ment. We show that no sophisticated attacks are needed, and simple
attacks may work in practice. The solution calls for the concerted
efforts among all parties involved. Any of parties which do not
timely enforce the necessary security mechanisms will cause secu-
rity threats and unexpected damages.
10. UPDATES
We have reported the identiﬁed issues to OP-I, Facebook, LG
and Samsung, and worked with OP-I and Facebook to address their
issues. According to the OP-I security patches at the phone, there
are two remedies. First, the IMS server’s IP address is hidden from
the routing table, so the malware without root access is unable to
know where the forge SIP messages should be sent. Second, OP-I
adopts the locked bootloader [18] to prevent the phone from be-
ing rooted so that the IPSec of the SIP session cannot be abused.
Besides, OP-I plans to deploy the network-based solution, which is
the secure binding of the originator’s phone number and IP address,
in October 2016. As for Facebook, the user is allowed to specify
a secret code for the Facebook Text service, but it is disabled by
default. Moreover, Facebook removes the features of add-a-friend
and like-a-page from the service. Note that the security team of
LG and Samsung are currently investigating the security issues we
reported.

APPENDIX
We study 40 popular SMS-powered services, which cover 17 distinct in-
dustries including grocery, bank, social network, retailing, etc., at OP-I in
the US. We discover that 28 out of 40 services (e.g., Walmart, Target, Face-
book, Fedex, etc.) are vulnerable to the IMS-based SMS attacks due to
no runtime authentication (§5.1) or weak authorization (§5.2,§5.3). The
detailed results are summarized in Table 2. The vulnerable services can
be classiﬁed into two categories: notiﬁcation-based and request-based. The
notiﬁcation-based service (e.g., SMS advertising, ﬂight status SMS notiﬁca-
tion, etc.) may suffer from the attack of unauthorized subscription (e.g., the
SMS advertising of The Home Depot in §5.3). The provider’s goodwill may
thus be impaired according to plenty of the victims’ complaints. Second,
the request-based service (e.g., account manipulation request, donation re-
quest, etc.), which provides users with the ability to request service actions
via SMS, may suffer from the attack of account hijacking (e.g., Facebook
account hijacking in §5.1), unauthorized donation (e.g., unauthorized ARC
donation in §5.2) or any other unauthorized use of the service.
