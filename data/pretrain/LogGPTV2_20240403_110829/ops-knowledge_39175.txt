User: How to create a user on a Linux system and set its permissions to access specific files and directories?
Assistant: 1. Create a user You can use the following command to create a new user: ``` sudo adduser username ``` where `username` is the name of the new user. 2. Set the permissions of files and directories We can use the `chmod` command to set the permissions of files and directories. For example, the following command sets the permissions of the `/data/file.txt` file so that the new user can read and write the file: ``` sudo chmod u+rw /data/file.txt ``` 3. Assign directory Permissions We can also use `chmod` command to set directory permissions. For example, if we want to give the new user access to the `/data` directory, then the following command can be used: ``` sudo chmod u+rwx /data ``` This will make the `/data` directory "read(r) ", "write (w)" and "execute (x)" permissions. 4. Add the user to the group Finally, we need to add the new user to the group that needs to access the files and directories. For example, if we want to give a new user access to the `/data` directory, we can add that user to the `data` group: ``` sudo usermod -a -G data username ``` This will assign the new user `username ` added to the `data` group. After completing the above steps, the new user can access the specified files and directories.
