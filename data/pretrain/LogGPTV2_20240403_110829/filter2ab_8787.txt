### Title: I Am Whoever I Say I Am: Infiltrating Identity Providers Using a 0-Click Exploit

#### Abstract
Single Sign-On (SSO) has become the primary authentication method for accessing multiple, yet independent, software systems. At the heart of SSO are identity providers (IdPs), which verify user credentials and issue signed tokens that service providers (SPs) use for access control. Additionally, when an application requests resources on behalf of a user, an authorization request is made to an authorization server (AS). The AS exchanges a code for a token, which is then presented to a resource server (RS) to grant the requested access.

While OAuth2 handles authorization and SAML handles authentication, Identity and Access Management (IAM) solutions have gained widespread adoption in enterprise environments to manage both. However, what if these IAM solutions are vulnerable to critical remote attacks? These solutions must be exposed to the internet, trusted to protect identities, and facilitate access for potentially thousands of users and applications.

In this presentation, I will first cover the foundational use cases for IAM solutions and discuss some notable in-the-wild (ITW) attacks, along with their impact. Next, I will detail the approach I took during the audit, including the challenges and pitfalls I encountered and how I overcame them. This will culminate in an unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) as root, achieved by chaining multiple vulnerabilities in a widely used IAM solution employed by several Fortune 500 companies and government organizations.

I will delve into the specific vulnerabilities, presenting novel exploitation strategies to bypass strict outbound network access controls. Finally, I will provide a live demonstration and release functional exploit code, enabling penetration testers and network administrators to validate and remediate these critical findings.
