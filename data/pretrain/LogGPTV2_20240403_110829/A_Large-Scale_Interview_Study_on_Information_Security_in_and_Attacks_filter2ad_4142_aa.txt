Abstract
Cybercrime is on the rise. Attacks by hackers, organized
crime and nation-state adversaries are an economic threat
for companies world-wide. Small and medium-sized enter-
prises (SMEs) have increasingly become victims of cyber-
attacks in recent years. SMEs often lack the awareness and
resources to deploy extensive information security measures.
However, the health of SMEs is critical for society: For ex-
ample, in Germany, 38.8% of all employees work in SMEs,
which contributed 31.9% of the German annual gross domes-
tic product in 2018. Many guidelines and recommendations
encourage companies to invest more into their information
security measures. However, there is a lack of understanding
of the adoption of security measures in SMEs, their risk per-
ception with regards to cybercrime and their experiences with
cyberattacks. To address this gap in research, we performed
5,000 computer-assisted telephone-interviews (CATIs) with
representatives of SMEs in Germany. We report on their expe-
riences with cybercrime, management of information security
and risk perception. We present and discuss empirical results
of the adoption of both technical and organizational security
measures and risk awareness in SMEs. We ﬁnd that many
technical security measures and basic awareness have been
deployed in the majority of companies. We uncover differ-
ences in reporting cybercrime incidences for SMEs based on
their industry sector, company size and security awareness.
We conclude our work with a discussion of recommendations
for future research, industry and policy makers.
1 Introduction
The consequences of cybercrime are felt world-wide. In 2018
a study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies
(CSIS) and McAfee estimates that each year 0.8% of global
GDP, close to $600 billion, is lost to cybercrime [25]. The
global impact of cybercrime will only increase further as
more and more potential targets gain online access in devel-
oping markets, and digital currencies simplify the extortion
of money.
With many potential victims and easy automation, cyber-
attacks can be operated at scale. In 2019 alone, the FBI’s In-
ternet Crime Complaint Center received 467,361 complaints
concerning cyberattacks, resulting in estimated losses of more
than $3.5 billion [21]. Especially businesses are high-priority
targets due to low risk to payoff ratio and their often large
attack surfaces. The UK Department for Digital, Culture,
Media & Sport reports in their “Cyber Security Breaches Sur-
vey 2019” that a third (32%) of the participating businesses
experienced a cybersecurity breach or attack in the last 12
months [14].
While large enterprises often have considerable budgets
and dedicated security teams available to protect themselves
from attacks, SMEs often lack the expertise and assets to
properly defend themselves from such attacks. The “Cyber
Security Breaches Survey 2019” reports that SMEs were es-
pecially at risk, with up to 40% experiencing breaches [14].
According to the “Second Annual State of Ransomware Re-
port: Survey Results for Australia”, 32% of SMEs were hit
by ransomware in 2017, and one ﬁfth had to completely stop
operations immediately [30]. A recent Public Service An-
nouncement by the FBI further highlights the rise and danger
of ransomware attacks [17].
SMEs1 make up a large percentage of the economy in Euro-
pean countries and the U.S. In Germany, they are responsible
for 31.9% of the gross domestic product, and they employ
38.8% of all employees in Germany. With such a large share
of turnover but noticeably lower resources for information
security, SMEs require special support to defend against cy-
bercrime and the resulting casualties [39].
In this work, we investigate the perception, handling, prob-
lems, and experiences of SMEs in Germany with information
security. Using the results, we uncover areas of high risk and
provide recommendations for SMEs in Germany and interna-
tionally. To guide our research, we follow this set of research
questions:
1In our study we exclude micro-enterprises - deﬁned as <10 employees
in Germany and <20 employees in the U.S.
USENIX Association
30th USENIX Security Symposium    1235
RQ1: “How do company employees perceive the risk of cy-
berattacks?”
RQ2: “Which and how frequent are information security
measures deployed in SMEs?”
RQ3: “Which types and frequencies of attacks have our par-
ticipating companies detected within the last 12 months?”
RQ4: “How are deployed security measures and company
characteristics related to reported incidents and what are the
emerging victimization factors?”
Based on these research questions, we conducted computer-
assisted telephone-interviews (CATI) with representatives of
SMEs in Germany (n = 5,000). We were interested in their
experiences and problems with cybercrime, as well as their
perception of risks and handling of information security. We
ﬁnd that basic technical security measures and a certain se-
curity awareness have arrived in company mindsets, but not
for all employees. Security measures such as information
security training, regular risk analysis and emergency drills
that involve all company staff still only happen within half of
all SMEs in our dataset. We also identify aspects contributing
to the likelihood of encountering certain cybercrime attacks,
including company characteristics such as industry sector,
internationality, and company size but also smaller factors
such as the technical and organization security measures and
their effects on certain attack types.
Our work is different from previous research in multiple
ways:
• To the best of our knowledge, the scale of our interview
study with 5,000 companies is unmatched by previous
academic publications and on-par with the largest gov-
ernment surveys (e. g., 7,818 by the U.S. Department of
Justice in 2008 [32]).
• Our interview study covers not only interactions with
cybercrime and cyberattacks but also company charac-
teristics, risk awareness and deployed security measures.
• Our data analysis includes empirical results for company
characteristics as well as their relation to deployed secu-
rity measures, risk perception of those companies, and
experienced cyberattacks.
By using internationally assignable categories, we aim to
make our results more comparable with studies and ofﬁcial
statistics in other countries.
The remaining paper is organized as follows: We discuss re-
lated work (Section 2), describe our methodology (Section 3),
and present our results (Section 4). Finally, we discuss our
ﬁndings (Section 5) and conclude our work (Section 6).
2 Related Work
We discuss related work in two key areas: measurement of
cybercrime in small and medium companies and the effects
and costs of cybercrime.
Measurement of Cybercrime in Small and Medium Com-
panies. Previous research focuses on surveys and statistics
covered by ofﬁcial authorities, as well as surveys conducted
by commercial organizations without the direct involvement
of academic institutions. Even though there is a major need
for well-founded research in literature covering cyberattacks
against organizations [2,27,28,35], commercial author groups
clearly dominate the publicly available literature [18] and,
therefore, signiﬁcantly inﬂuence our society’s perception of
the phenomenon [31].
Rantala conducted one of the ﬁrst large-scale surveys in-
vestigating cyberattacks using social science approaches to
enable the transfer of ﬁndings to the underlying population.
Surveying 8,000 U.S. enterprises, she constituted the preva-
lence of cyberattacks in 2005 by several structural characteris-
tics and security measures as well as damages and costs. She
ﬁnds that companies are not affected equally by cyberattacks
(e. g., some sectors are targeted more frequently, and com-
panies that outsourced all or part of their computer security
had a higher prevalence) [32]. Rantala’s ﬁndings provide a
good overview, but might be outdated compared to the dy-
namic ﬁeld of cybersecurity, lack inferential analysis, and are
not valid for most European organizations. More recently,
Klahr et al. and Osbourne et al. conducted similar research
to Rantala with a focus on UK businesses. Both surveys also
found evidence for varying impacts of cyberattacks against
businesses (e. g., large businesses are more likely to be struck
more often, have a higher incident of breaches among those
taking action to protect themselves [24], and certain sectors
suffer more online crime incidents than others [29]) but also
omit to exceed descriptive analytics.
Alluding to the lack of proper research, Romanosky’s ﬁnd-
ings based on publicly available data suggest “that public
concerns regarding the increasing rates of breaches and legal
actions may be excessive”, compared to the actual impact of
events. However, putting the focus on ﬁnancial impacts by
industries, they ﬁnd that actual damages are comparatively
low, leaving out explanatory approaches how certain events
lead to particular impacts and why these impacts might differ
between individual enterprises (e. g., due to security mea-
sures) [34]. Kjaerland also uses secondary data collected by
CERTs in the early 2000s, ﬁnding “commercial and govern-
ment sectors experience different types of attacks, with dif-
ferent types of impact, stemming from different sources”. Al-
though their data set provides some attack-speciﬁc variables,
they also face limitations of lacking structural characteristics
of the targeted businesses, established security measures, as
well as a representative sample [23]. The same limitations
can be applied to Paoli et al. who attempt to assess the im-
1236    30th USENIX Security Symposium
USENIX Association
pact of cybercrime by surveying 300 Belgian businesses in
2016, suffering a non-participation rate of 95%. Also, having
a less-technical focus, they ﬁnd evidence that most affected
businesses do not report major harm or costs, and only a ﬁfth
of the affected businesses rate harm to operational activities
as serious or higher [31].
In the U.S., the Internet Crime Complaint Center (I3C)
releases a yearly “Internet Crime Report“ [21]. This report
covers international and national complaints directed to the
I3C. The report provides a good overview of the types of
breaches and incidents occurring in the U.S. and provides
recommendations, but does not cover company demographics
or root-cause analysis. In the UK, the Department for Digital,
Culture Media and Sport (DCMS) releases a yearly “Cyber
Security Breaches Survey” [14]. The report covers security
incidents in companies, security measures they deploy, and
risk factors within company demographics. It is a continua-
tion of the survey from Klahr et al. [24]. While it focuses on
providing descriptives, statistics, and trends, we attempt to
relate risk factors and security measures to security incidents
to provide in-depth insights into why companies with certain
characteristics are attacked and at risk of what type of attack.
Effects and Costs of Cybercrime. Smith et al. conducted
case studies with ten companies concerning the marketing
activity and shareholder value after a cybercrime attack [36].
They demonstrate a decline in stock value, high recovery
costs, and other consequences for these companies. Other
event studies also found evidence for the negative impacts of
cybersecurity breaches on stock prices [1, 12, 41]. Anderson
et al. analyzed the cost of cybercrime in 2012 [4] and again
in 2019 [3]. They report ﬁndings in terms of direct losses,
the cost of defense and the indirect cost, and factors like
lost revenue, but without an explicit focus on companies. In
2019, Demjaha et al. conducted a qualitative case study in
semi-structured interviews with employees at a company that
recently faced a data breach [13]. Stevens et al. introduced
formalized threat modeling in a ﬁeld study (n = 25), ﬁnding
that the designed threat mitigation strategies provided tangible
security beneﬁts [40].
As indicated, research in the ﬁeld of cyberattacks against
businesses based on social science approaches is still under-
represented, compared to the expanse and relevance of this
phenomenon. Tackling the critique of Anderson et al. stating
available statistics on cybercrime are insufﬁcient and frag-
mented and suffer under- and over-reporting [4], we believe
our large-scale surveys is among the soundest and most com-
prehensive studies in continental Europe.

Interview Guide Development
3.1
Our research questions (cf. Section 1) served as the founda-
tion for the CAT-interview guide. Additionally, we conducted
interviews with both cybercrime experts and non-experts to
establish further areas of interest and improve clarity for the
ﬁnal interview guide.
Interview Structure. We collected interview data in the
form of computer-assisted telephone (CAT-) interviews with
the help of a professional survey institute with experienced
and trained interviewers. Telephone interviews allow queries
from the interviewees. To allow for a representative sample
of interview partners in German SMEs and a higher response
rate, we utilized contacts provided by the survey institute for
the interviews.
We developed the ﬁnal interview questions based on a lit-
erature review [6, 7, 10, 20, 22, 24, 31, 32] with the help of six
expert interviews and multiple feedback rounds with informa-
tion security and privacy experts from industry and academia.
We did not compensate the experts and the interviews lasted
on average 88 minutes. We evaluated the interviews follow-
ing Mayring’s qualitative content analysis approach with two
researchers [26].
The CAT-interview guide had the following structure:
1. Introduction. The interview started with a brief intro-
duction of the interviewer and interviewee and the pur-
USENIX Association
30th USENIX Security Symposium    1237
pose of the study. We asked questions about the inter-
viewee’s job role in the company and their estimation of
sensitivity to information security and cybercrime risks
in the company. We report ﬁndings of this part of the
interview in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 and discuss them in
Section 5.
2. Cyberattacks. This section includes questions about de-
tected cyberattacks within the last 12 months and covers
different types of attacks, e. g., phishing or CEO-fraud.
3. Security Measures. This section includes questions
about the deployment of technical and organizational
security measures in the interviewees’ companies.
4. Demographics. This section includes demographic
questions about the company, e. g., annual turnover, num-
ber of locations, and export activity.
Types of attacks. In the interview guide, we divided attacks
into the eight categories: ransomware, spyware, attacks using
other malware (e. g., viruses, worms, botnets, exploits), man-
ual hacking (e. g., hardware manipulation, unauthorized con-
ﬁguration), (D)DoS attacks, defacing of web content, CEO
fraud and phishing. We chose this less technical and relatively
broad classiﬁcation for two reasons. First, to be independent
of speciﬁc attack vectors, techniques, and tools. We also did
not want to include speciﬁc domains, systems, or data (e. g.
XSS), which could change over time. Second, in order to
promote comprehensibility and acceptance among the par-
ticipants as well as to reduce the complexity of the resulting
telephone interview. The types of attacks can be combined
with each other. For example, information from a phishing
or spyware attack can be used to prepare and execute a CEO
fraud attack. The impact on systems and data does not repre-
sent a type of attack, but rather the consequence of an attack.
For example, “identity theft” does not represent a type of
attack, but the result of a successful attack, e. g., with the help
of spyware.
Pre-Testing. We pre-tested the interview guide in two
phases: First, we invited twelve security experts from industry
and academic partners, including information technology and
management representatives of multiple regional medium-
sized companies, to discuss content- and comprehension-
related aspects of the interview guide. We aimed to identify
questions companies could not answer (e. g., general prob-
lems of comprehension or distinction of certain attacks and
security measures), would not answer (e. g., due to discretion
or missing approvals) or are not relevant or applicable for
speciﬁc industries or business models. Second, we piloted the
guide by performing telephone interviews with six employees
responsible for the information security in small and medium
companies. Three of these worked in companies providing
IT-as-a-service to multiple small and medium enterprises and
offered anonymous insights on their clients. With these pilots,
we aimed to identify comprehension difﬁculties and further
thoughts on possible responses to interview questions.
Based on the pre-testing, we revised the interview guide:
Besides adding two more questions and some more answer
options (e. g., “partially applicable”), we added explanations
and rephrased the wording of a few existing questions.
During pre-testing, the telephone interview took 20 min-
utes on average, and all pilots felt comfortable answering
the interview questions. Hence, we did not expect fatigue
effects and did not randomize questions to make the interview
process easier for the interviewers.
Interviewer Training. In preparation of the interviews, we
performed interview training sessions with the 141 interview-
ers in two on-site call centers of the CATI service provider.
The interviewer training illustrated the purpose of our study,
discussed each question of the interview guide in detail, en-
couraged interviewers to point to questions that required fur-
ther clariﬁcation, and provided a list of potential queries in-
terviewees might ask during the interviews.
3.2 Recruitment
We based our research on a stratiﬁed random sample of 5,000
organizations. Stratiﬁed sampling is a method to sample
from a population by partitioning the population into sub-
populations. The population of companies in Germany is
partitioned based on industry sectors and company sizes.
Industry Sectors. In order to ease international comparabil-
ity and connectivity to other ofﬁcial studies, we use the ofﬁcial
German Industry Classiﬁcation WZ08 system [38]. WZ08 is
based on the European NACE Revision 2 classiﬁcation [16],
which in turn is based on ISIC Rev 4 classiﬁcation [43] of the
United Nations. To obtain a representative sample, we aimed
for a sample to be proportional to the distribution of industry
sectors by the WZ08-Classiﬁcation.
Company Size. We built the following subgroups for com-
