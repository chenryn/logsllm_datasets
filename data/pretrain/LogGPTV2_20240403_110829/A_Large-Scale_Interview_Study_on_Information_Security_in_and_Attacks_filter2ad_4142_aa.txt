## Abstract

Cybercrime is on the rise, posing a significant economic threat to companies worldwide. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have increasingly become targets of cyber-attacks in recent years. These enterprises often lack the resources and awareness to implement comprehensive information security measures. However, SMEs are vital to the economy; in Germany, for example, they employ 38.8% of all workers and contribute 31.9% of the country's annual gross domestic product. Despite numerous guidelines and recommendations, there is a gap in understanding how SMEs adopt security measures, perceive risks, and experience cyber-attacks. To address this, we conducted 5,000 computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATIs) with representatives from German SMEs. Our study provides insights into their experiences with cybercrime, management of information security, and risk perception. We present empirical results on the adoption of both technical and organizational security measures and risk awareness. We find that while many basic security measures are in place, there are significant differences in reporting cyber-attacks based on industry sector, company size, and security awareness. We conclude with recommendations for future research, industry, and policymakers.

## 1. Introduction

The global impact of cybercrime is substantial. In 2018, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) and McAfee estimated that 0.8% of the global GDP, approximately $600 billion, is lost to cybercrime annually. As more potential targets gain online access, especially in developing markets, and digital currencies simplify extortion, the threat of cyber-attacks is expected to increase.

In 2019, the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center received 467,361 complaints related to cyber-attacks, resulting in estimated losses of over $3.5 billion. Businesses, particularly SMEs, are high-priority targets due to their large attack surfaces and often limited defenses. The UK Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport reported that 32% of businesses experienced a cybersecurity breach or attack in the last 12 months, with SMEs being especially at risk.

While large enterprises typically have dedicated security teams and substantial budgets, SMEs often lack the necessary expertise and resources. According to the "Second Annual State of Ransomware Report: Survey Results for Australia," 32% of SMEs were hit by ransomware in 2017, and one-fifth had to halt operations immediately. The FBI has also highlighted the growing danger of ransomware attacks.

SMEs make up a significant portion of the economy in European countries and the U.S. In Germany, they account for 31.9% of the gross domestic product and employ 38.8% of the workforce. Given their importance and limited resources, SMEs require special support to defend against cyber-attacks.

In this study, we investigate the perception, handling, problems, and experiences of German SMEs with information security. We aim to identify high-risk areas and provide recommendations. Our research is guided by the following questions:

- **RQ1:** How do company employees perceive the risk of cyber-attacks?
- **RQ2:** Which and how frequent are information security measures deployed in SMEs?
- **RQ3:** What types and frequencies of attacks have participating companies detected within the last 12 months?
- **RQ4:** How are deployed security measures and company characteristics related to reported incidents, and what are the emerging victimization factors?

We conducted 5,000 CATIs with representatives from German SMEs to gather data on their experiences and perceptions. We found that while basic technical security measures and some level of security awareness are present, more advanced measures such as regular training, risk analysis, and emergency drills are less common. We also identified factors contributing to the likelihood of encountering certain cyber-attacks, including industry sector, internationality, and company size.

Our study is unique in several ways:
- **Scale:** Our interview study with 5,000 companies is one of the largest, comparable to major government surveys.
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** We cover interactions with cyber-attacks, company characteristics, risk awareness, and deployed security measures.
- **Empirical Analysis:** Our data analysis includes detailed results on company characteristics, their relation to security measures, risk perception, and experienced cyber-attacks.

By using internationally comparable categories, we aim to facilitate comparisons with studies and official statistics from other countries.

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Measurement of Cybercrime in Small and Medium Companies

Previous research on cyber-attacks against SMEs has primarily relied on surveys and statistics from official authorities and commercial organizations. Despite the need for rigorous academic research, commercial reports dominate the literature and significantly influence public perception.

One of the first large-scale surveys was conducted by Rantala in 2005, which surveyed 8,000 U.S. enterprises to determine the prevalence of cyber-attacks. She found that certain sectors and companies with outsourced security were more frequently targeted. While her findings provided valuable insights, they may be outdated and lack inferential analysis.

More recent studies, such as those by Klahr et al. and Osbourne et al., focused on UK businesses and found similar patterns, but they also omitted inferential analysis. Romanosky's analysis of publicly available data suggested that public concerns about increasing breaches may be exaggerated, but he noted that financial impacts vary by industry. Kjaerland's study, using secondary data from CERTs, found that commercial and government sectors experience different types of attacks with varying impacts. Paoli et al. surveyed 300 Belgian businesses and found that most affected businesses did not report major harm or costs.

### 2.2 Effects and Costs of Cybercrime

Smith et al. conducted case studies on the marketing activities and shareholder value after cyber-attacks, demonstrating declines in stock value and high recovery costs. Other studies have also shown negative impacts on stock prices. Anderson et al. analyzed the cost of cybercrime in 2012 and 2019, reporting direct and indirect costs but without a specific focus on companies. Demjaha et al. conducted a qualitative case study on a company that recently faced a data breach, and Stevens et al. introduced formalized threat modeling, finding tangible security benefits.

Despite the relevance of cyber-attacks, social science research in this area remains underrepresented. Our large-scale survey aims to address this gap, providing a comprehensive and sound study in continental Europe.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Interview Guide Development

Our research questions served as the foundation for the CAT-interview guide. We conducted expert interviews and reviewed literature to develop the final interview questions. The guide was structured as follows:

1. **Introduction:** Brief introduction, job role, and estimation of sensitivity to information security and cybercrime risks.
2. **Cyberattacks:** Questions about detected cyber-attacks in the last 12 months, covering various types such as phishing and CEO fraud.
3. **Security Measures:** Questions about the deployment of technical and organizational security measures.
4. **Demographics:** Questions about the company, such as annual turnover and number of locations.

We classified attacks into eight broad categories to ensure comprehensibility and reduce complexity. The pre-testing involved discussions with twelve security experts and six pilot interviews, leading to revisions in the guide.

### 3.2 Recruitment

We used a stratified random sample of 5,000 organizations, partitioned based on industry sectors and company sizes. Industry sectors were classified using the German Industry Classification WZ08 system, which is based on the European NACE Revision 2 classification. We aimed for a representative sample proportional to the distribution of industry sectors.

### 3.3 Training and Execution

We trained 141 interviewers in two on-site call centers, providing them with detailed instructions and potential queries. The interviews were conducted from August 2018 to February 2019, with quality checks and anonymization by the service provider.

## 4. Results

### 4.1 Risk Perception

Our findings indicate that while many SMEs have a basic level of security awareness, it is not uniform across all employees. Advanced security measures, such as regular training and risk analysis, are still lacking in many companies.

### 4.2 Security Measures

Basic technical security measures are widely adopted, but more sophisticated measures are less common. We identified factors contributing to the likelihood of encountering certain cyber-attacks, including industry sector, company size, and security awareness.

### 4.3 Attack Types and Frequencies

We found that certain types of attacks, such as phishing and ransomware, are more common. The frequency of attacks varies based on company characteristics and the presence of security measures.

### 4.4 Relationship Between Security Measures and Reported Incidents

Our analysis shows that the deployment of security measures and company characteristics are related to reported incidents. We identified emerging victimization factors, such as industry sector and company size.

## 5. Discussion

Our study provides valuable insights into the state of information security in German SMEs. While basic security measures are in place, there is a need for more advanced measures and consistent security awareness. We recommend further research, industry support, and policy initiatives to enhance the cybersecurity of SMEs.

## 6. Conclusion

This large-scale interview study offers a comprehensive view of information security in and attacks against German SMEs. We identified key areas for improvement and provided recommendations for future research, industry, and policymakers. By addressing these gaps, we can better protect SMEs from the growing threat of cyber-attacks.
