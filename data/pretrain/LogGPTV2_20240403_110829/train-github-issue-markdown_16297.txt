The methods and attributes sections are wrong, because sphinx tries to import
numpy.methodname instead of numpy.classname.methodname. See numpy.chararray
for example.
This is probably a Sphinx bug (in autosummary/generate.py), but currently we
duplicate/extend the autosummary class template in
doc/source/reference/_templates. That class template should probably be
completely removed anyway, this is fixed in Sphinx. I tried removing it, and
the generated pdf got 20 pages longer while the number of warnings went from
1600 down to 800.
