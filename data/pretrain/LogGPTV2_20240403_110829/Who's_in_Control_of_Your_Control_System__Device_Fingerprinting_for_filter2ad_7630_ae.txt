lead to misclassiﬁcation problems.
The most attractive method to mitigate structural model
error is to employ a gray box modeling approach, which
combines white box model predictions with black box data as

more knowledgeable and skilled adversary to successfully
accomplish. She would have to know beforehand the relative
speed of her machine to the target’s machine, have knowledge
of any effects the network architecture might have on the
signature, and determine how fast the target’s clock drifts, all
suggesting that these methods are robust enough to be used as
part of a defense-in-breadth IDS strategy.
Although the ﬁngerprinting techniques proposed here are
completely passive and require no changes to the target net-
work or devices, better defenses against mimicry attacks could
be implemented if this assumption is removed. For example,
the SCADA master or the ﬁngerprinter could be conﬁgured
to randomly send extra requests or commands that have no
effect on the operation of the network, but would increase the
knowledge requirement of the adversary and the complexity
of the behavior she has to mimic. For the CLRT method,
this could involve changing from polling for event data to
polling for different numbers of speciﬁc measurements each
time, which on the low powered embedded systems should
theoretically result in measurable timing differences. For the
physical ﬁngerprinting method this could take the form of
sending redundant commands, for example by sending a Close
command when the breaker is already closed.
C. Limitations
While both proposed ﬁngerprinting methods perform well
under certain conditions, there are some limitations. The cross-
layer ﬁngerprinting method ﬁrst requires a SCADA protocol
using “Read” and “Response” messages, which all of the
most popular SCADA protocols implement. Furthermore, the
SCADA protocol must sit on top of a TCP implementation
that uses at least a minimum amount of “quick ACKs” (im-
mediately ACKing a packet instead of delaying in the hopes
13
it becomes available. For example, this can be accomplished
by replacing synthetic samples with measured samples in the
response distribution. The accuracy would then be expected
to converge to black box model accuracy over time. It is
important
to note that, due to the accuracy limitations of
white box modeling, use of this approach would be limited
to scenarios where equipment is operated so infrequently that
sufﬁcient black box data is difﬁcult to immediately obtain.
White box modeling does, however, serve as a valuable tool
in such scenarios by providing a starting guess for the response
distribution that can be updated opportunistically as additional
data is gathered.
VII. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper we presented two novel methods for passively
ﬁngerprinting devices on ICS networks. After evaluating the
methods using real world datasets and controlled lab exper-
iments, ﬁngerprint classiﬁcation accuracies as high as 99%
and 92% were achieved for the ﬁrst and second methods
respectively. Both techniques exhibited resistance to simple
forgery attacks and could feasibly be implemented alongside
more traditional IDS solutions to augment
the security of
critical ICS networks.
For future work, we plan to improve on the white box
modeling and extend these methods to ﬁngerprinting embed-
ded devices in the “Internet of Things” and also investigate
the possibility of developing active ﬁngerprinting techniques
to increase classiﬁcation accuracy.

APPENDIX
A. Software Conﬁguration Fingerprinting
To verify the suggestions from the large scale experiments
that the software conﬁguration was observable through CLRT
measurements, lab experiments were performed on the same
exact IED with different settings enabled and disabled. Ap-
proximately 700 CLRT measurements were taken for each
of three cases: all extra settings enabled, only overcurrent
protection enabled, and all extra settings disabled. When

comparing the distributions for all extra settings enabled versus
disabled in Figure 27, there are several noticeable differences.
In fact, when the same FF-ANN from the previous experiments
was trained on these two cases, perfect classiﬁcation accuracy
was achieved. Figure 28 shows only minor differences between
the ‘free’ case and the overcurrent case, and consequently, the
FF-ANN only achieves roughly 66% classiﬁcation accuracy.

After estimating the values of the parameters and varying
the value of c in Monte Carlo simulations, the synthetic distri-
bution in Figure 30 was generated. One interesting difference
to note is that the open and close sequences are more similar
to each other for the vacuum interrupter than they were for
the latches. More importantly, it should be noted that this
distribution is clearly distinguishable from the latches due to
the signiﬁcantly larger response times (centered around 60ms
as opposed to 25ms).

B. Modeling of a vacuum interrupter
The previous example in Section V highlights the modeling
process for a small-scale relay for which laboratory data can be
easily obtained. To demonstrate how this methodology scales
to common ICS devices, the physical modeling approach is
applied to a medium voltage vacuum circuit-breaker commonly
found in power distribution stations. Vacuum interrupters typ-
ically employ contacts located inside a vacuum tube (used
to mitigate arcing during operation). The breaker itself is a
mechanical device operated by a preloaded spring so that open-
ing and closing of the breaker happens rapidly. A picture of
the Siemens GMSG vacuum circuit breaker and a mechanical
schematic of the relevant moving parts are shown in Figure
29.

Simulated open and close response distributions for vacuum
The purpose of the above example is not to provide a
detailed mathematical analysis of a vacuum interrupter, but
rather to demonstrate that a high-ﬁdelity dynamic model of
a real-world ICS component can be developed without re-
quiring access to or operation of the device itself. Instead,
available technical drawings and manufacturer’s speciﬁcations
are sufﬁcient in many cases to estimate model parameters and
generate a reasonable prediction of the device’s response time
distribution.
