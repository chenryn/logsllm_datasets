in CoreScale, as predicted by past research in the edge setting.
(Figs 6, 7)
The BBR model by Ware et al. [48] shows that a single BBR flow
could take 40% of total throughput irrespective of the number of
competing NewReno or Cubic flows. We show that this result holds
at scale and that a single BBR flow takes 40% of total throughput
even when competing with thousands of NewReno or Cubic flows,
as seen in Figs 5 and 6.
Finding 7: BBR takes 99.9% of total throughput when compet-
ing with an equal number of NewReno (or Cubic) flows in
CoreScale, confirming past research in the edge setting. (Fig 8)
Past research in the edge setting has shown that BBR can take up
to 99% of total throughput when competing with an equal number
of Cubic flows [28, 45, 52]. Our results show that this inter-CCA
unfairness persists even in CoreScale, with BBR obtaining up to
99.9% of total throughput when competing with an equal number
of Cubic or NewReno flows, as seen in Fig 8.
Finding 8: Cubic takes 70% to 80% of total throughput when
competing with an equal number of NewReno flows in CoreScale,
confirming the unfairness results of past research in the edge
setting. (Fig 5)
