**Subject: High I/O Rate Alert from Linode - Locating the Problem**

I recently received an alert email from Linode, stating that my server (Randy) has exceeded the notification threshold (1000) for disk I/O rate, averaging 1571.81 over the last two hours. This is not the first time I have encountered this issue; I received similar alerts several months ago. Despite these recurring alerts, there has been no significant increase in my website's network traffic.

In the past, I suspected that the growing log file size might be causing the high I/O rate. To address this, I used `cronolog` to rotate the log files, and it seemed to resolve the problem. However, the I/O rate chart now shows that the I/O rate is continuing to grow, and I am unable to pinpoint the exact cause.

My server is running Ubuntu 8.04.4 LTS with Apache, PHP, and MySQL, hosted on Linode. Could you please provide guidance on how to locate the source of the high I/O rate? Are there any specific tools or methods that could help me diagnose this issue?

**Response:**

To identify which process is causing the high I/O rate, you can use the `iotop` package. `iotop` is a top-like utility that displays real-time I/O usage by processes. Here are the steps to install and use `iotop`:

1. **Install `iotop`:**
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install iotop
   ```

2. **Run `iotop`:**
   ```sh
   sudo iotop
   ```

This will display a list of processes sorted by their I/O usage. You can observe which processes are using the most I/O and take appropriate action, such as optimizing the configuration or identifying any potential issues.

Additionally, you can adjust the I/O rate alert threshold in the Linode web interface under the Settings tab. This may help reduce the frequency of alerts if the current threshold is too low for your typical usage patterns.

If you need further assistance, feel free to ask.
