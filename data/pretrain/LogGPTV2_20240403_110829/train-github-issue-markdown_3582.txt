**Tuomas Kiviaho** opened **SPR-8489** and provided the following comments:

Currently, the `ContextSingletonBeanFactoryLocator` is using `BeanFactoryUtils.beanOfType` instead of `BeanFactory.getBean(requiredType)`. Transitioning to the latter would enable autowiring exclusions. As an additional benefit, the implementation would no longer need to be aware of `ListableBeanFactory`.

Additionally, I noticed that `DefaultListableBeanFactory.getBean(requiredType)` does not consider the `@Primary` annotation (refer to the `resolveDependency` method). It would be beneficial to have this feature integrated into the `getBean` method as well.
