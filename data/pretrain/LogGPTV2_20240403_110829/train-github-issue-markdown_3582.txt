I see that (Context)SingletonBeanFactoryLocator still using BeanFactoryUtils
beanOfType instead of BeanFactory getBean(requiredType). Changing this would
allow autowiring exclusions and as a bonus the implementation wouldn't have to
be aware of ListableBeanFactory anymore. I noticed also that
DefaultListableBeanFactory.getBean(requiredType) isn't aware of primary flag
(see resolveDependency method). I would like to see this feature to be
available in getBean as well.
