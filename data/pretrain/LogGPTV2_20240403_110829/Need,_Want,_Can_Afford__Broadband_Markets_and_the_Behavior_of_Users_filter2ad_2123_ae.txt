loss
(above 1%) appears to lead to lower demand than
comparable users lower packet loss rates.
Very high packet
users in India to users with similar capacities in the US, we
ﬁnd, surprisingly, that users in India tend to impose lower
demand 62% of the time (p-value < 0.001).
An analysis of NDT latencies shows that users in India
report much higher latencies to NDT servers than users
in other countries. The trends are not restricted to NDT
servers but can also be seen when looking at latencies to
the set of ﬁve globally popular websites: Facebook, Google,
Windows Live, Yahoo, and YouTube. Four of these websites
(Google, Facebook, YouTube, and Yahoo) accounted for the
top ﬁve most popular websites in India8 while Windows Live
was ranked 26th.
Figure 11 describes these latency measurements, and
compares them by user location (India versus the rest of our
sample population). The lines labelled “Web” correspond
to the median latency to the ﬁve popular websites while
“NDT” is the average latency to the nearest NDT server
(measured by NDT). We include data from two time periods
– 2011 through 2013 (labelled “’11-’13”) and from May 2014
to August 2014 (labelled “’14”) to compare NDT and website
latencies. 9
Figure 11 shows that the distribution of latency measure-
ments is similar for both NDT traces and the typical latency
to the top Alexa sites. For the majority of users in India,
we ﬁnd much higher latencies to both NDT and popular
websites compared to the rest of our sample population;
nearly every user has a latency longer than 100 ms. Since
we rejected the null hypothesis that latency does does not
aﬀect demand, we believe that the higher latency for users
in India contributes to the fact that we see a decrease in
network usage in India.
7.2 Packet loss
Next we examine the impact of packet loss on user
demand. Our hypothesis (H) is that decreased packet loss
rates result in higher demand. The results of this experiment
are shown in Table 8. We ﬁnd that when comparing users
with very low packet loss rates to comparable users with
very high packet loss rates, usage tended to be higher
on connections with lower packet loss rates. This trend
was most pronounced when comparing to connections with
packet loss rates above 1%.
This impact of packet loss can be illustrated by looking at
the behavior of users in India, as done in Sec. 7.1. We again
found that users in India had much higher packet loss rates
than the general population, as shown in Fig 12. As a result,
we believe that the lower quality connections (both increased

packet loss rates and latency) in India are the probable cause
of lower demand on the network.
8. RELATED WORK
Broadband analysis has recently attracted much attention
from the research community and the general public given
its important business and policy implications. A number
of eﬀorts have focused on characterizing the availability and
performance of broadband services around the world [1, 2,
5, 12, 20, 28, 31, 33]. The focus of our work is on exploring
broadband services in their broader context, evaluating the
complex interplay between broadband service characteris-
tics, their market features and user demand.
Diﬀerent aspects of the complex interplay between user
behavior, network services and operation has been explore
in previous work. Some recent studies have examined the
relationship between user behavior, network services and
the providers. In Dobrian et al. [13] the authors show that
poor connection quality can have a negative impact on a
user’s quality of experience. Blackburn et al. [3] study how
user behavior aﬀects the economics of cellular operators.
Chetty et al. [7] perform a user study to understand the
eﬀects of usage caps on broadband use. Other eﬀorts
have explored additional factors that may inﬂuence service
demand, including the weather [6], service capacity [36] and
the type of region [8].
The diﬃculty or outright impossibility of conducting con-
trolled, randomized experiments of user behavior at Internet
scale has been pointed out before. In his SIGCOMM 2011
Award presentation, Vern Paxson pointed to this issue
and suggested the use of natural experiments to explore
potential causal relationships with observational data.
In
a recent paper, Krishnan and Sitaraman [21] explore the
use of related quasi-experimental design (QED) to evaluate
the impact of video stream quality on viewer behavior and
Oktay et al. [24] relies on it for causal analysis of user
behavior in social media. We opted for natural experiments,
rather than QED, as we consider the control and treatment
groups to be suﬃciently similar to random assignment.

and the Internet at large. These ﬁndings should pro-
vide valuable insight to the research community, network
operators and policy makers. For policy makers, there
is a growing consensus that broadband access should be
treated as a fundamental right and several eﬀorts around
the world are aimed at closing the digital gap. We believe
that understanding digital inequality requires us to place
broadband access in a broader context [22]. This work, to
the best of our knowledge, is the ﬁrst attempt to that end.
In our longitudinal study of usage between 2011 and
2013, we found that subscribers’ demand remained relatively
constant in a particular service class, despite the fourfold
increase in global IP traﬃc over the past ﬁve years. Thus,
we believe the growth in broadband traﬃc comes from a
combination of increased service capacities and a rapidly
increasing number of broadband subscribers, rather than
higher demand at users’ existing service levels.
We ﬁnd a strong correlation between service capacity and
user demand, despite the fact that users rarely fully utilize
their links. We used two study designs to infer causality
between capacity and usage by studying how individual
users change behavior when switching to faster services
and by comparing demand between users with diﬀerent
capacities that are otherwise similar. Their relationship
also follows a law of diminishing returns;
in both cases,
we observed relatively lower increases in demand at higher
capacities. This trend is particularly noticeable at approx-
imately 10 Mbps, where usage begins to plateau for many
users.
This suggest that as service capacities continue to in-
crease, network operators can plan on higher over-provisioning
rates. We did observe, however, larger increases in demand
when including BitTorrent traﬃc in our analysis. Beyond
capacity, we also showed the impact that the quality of
a connection,
in terms of latency and packet loss rates,
has on user demand. For instance, we note that very
long latencies (above 500 ms) and high packet loss rates
(starting at 0.1%) clearly result in lower network usage. We
speculate that the relationship between capacity, quality and
demand will evolve with technology improvements and new
applications with greater bandwidth requirements become
widely available (e.g. 4k video streaming or telemedicine).
We examined how the price of broadband access aﬀect
user demand by comparing the behavior of users with
similar broadband services located in diﬀerent markets. We
found that users in markets where broadband connections
or additional capacity was more expensive, were more likely
to impose higher bandwidth demands on their service than
subscribers of comparable services in less expensive markets.
For policy makers, this would imply that a focus on wider
access to a medium, high-quality capacity service (around
10 Mbps) may have a more signiﬁcant impact than a focus
on increased service capacity. For operators, these trends
may suggest a possible role for service pricing in network
planning.
10. CONCLUSION
This paper is a ﬁrst attempt at understanding broadband
networks in their broader context, exploring the complex
interplay between broadband service characteristics and
user behavior. We combine data on broadband usage
with relative broadband service pricing from around the
world, and use alternative experimental designs to move
beyond correlation analysis in our study of the relationship
between user demand, broadband service retail prices, and
connection characteristics.
There are a number of interesting research directions
ahead, from further exploration of the interactions between
market features and usage, to an expanded analysis cap-
turing other contextual factors (from the weather and social
events to economics). For instance, investigating the relative
inﬂuence of levels of economic development or diﬀerences in
broadband availability in rural and urban areas, will give
us a more detailed understanding of the impact of diﬀerent
market features. Leveraging longitudinal data on broadband
usage, it may be possible to explore the potential beneﬁts
of national broadband deployment plans [4], both on the
market and on user behaviors. Finally, we have so far
treated users as a homogeneous consumer group; it will be
interesting to investigate how diﬀerent categories of users
(e.g., gamers, shoppers or movie-watchers) or more diverse
households are impacted by diﬀerent market and service
features.
