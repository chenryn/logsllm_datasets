    23:07  can we add  to JSX?
    23:07  I like that you chose the dot!
    23:07  Keep it javascript-first.
    23:07  yes
    23:08  translating colon to dot would be absurd
    23:08  (in my opinion)
    23:08  So you could have var MyComponentsPackage = {Typeahead:
                    R.createClass.. }
    23:08  
    23:08  I like it.
    23:08  Make an issue!
