User: There's a file that I would like to make sure does not grow larger than 2 GB (as it must run on a system that uses ext 2).  What's a good way to check a file's size bearing in mind that I will be writing to this file in between checks?  In particular, do I need to worry about buffered, unflushed changes that haven't been written to disk yet?
Assistant: Most reliable would be create a wrapping class which would check file's size when you open it, track write and seek operations, count current size based on those operations and prevent from exceeding size limit.
