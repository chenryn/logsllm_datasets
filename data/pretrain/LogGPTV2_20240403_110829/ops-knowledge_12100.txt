I understand that you are looking to build an application on Google App Engine (GAE) using Python, with the goal of taking user queries, passing them to Google Search, and then returning the results in a well-formatted manner. You have specific requirements and constraints, which I will address below:

### Requirements:
1. **Processing Large Number of Links:** You need to handle a large number of search results, but many available Google APIs only provide a limited number of top results.
2. **Module Selection:** You are unsure about which module to use for your needs, such as Mechanize, urllib, or other libraries. Additionally, you are concerned about whether these modules are compatible with GAE.
3. **Google API Limitations:** You found that the Google Custom Search API (CSE) provides only a limited number of results.

### Challenges:
- **Google's Terms of Service:** It is important to note that Google's Terms of Service explicitly prohibit scraping or automated retrieval of search results. This means that using tools like Mechanize or urllib to scrape Google Search results is not allowed and could result in your IP being blocked or other penalties.

### Recommendations:

#### 1. **Use the Google Custom Search JSON API:**
   - **Overview:** The Google Custom Search JSON API allows you to programmatically access Google Search results. While it does have limitations, it is the most appropriate and compliant way to achieve your goal.
   - **Limitations:** The free tier of the Google Custom Search API provides up to 100 search queries per day. For more extensive usage, you may need to upgrade to a paid plan.
   - **Results:** By default, the API returns up to 10 results per query. You can paginate through the results to get more, but there is still a limit to the total number of results you can retrieve.

   **Example Usage:**
   ```python
   import requests

   def google_search(query, api_key, cse_id, num=10):
       url = "https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1"
       params = {
           'q': query,
           'key': api_key,
           'cx': cse_id,
           'num': num
       }
       response = requests.get(url, params=params)
       return response.json()

   # Replace with your own API key and CSE ID
   api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
   cse_id = 'YOUR_CSE_ID'
   query = 'your search query'

   results = google_search(query, api_key, cse_id)
   print(results)
   ```

#### 2. **Handling Large Numbers of Results:**
   - **Pagination:** If you need more than 10 results, you can use pagination by setting the `start` parameter in the API request. For example, to get the next 10 results, set `start=11`.
   - **Rate Limits:** Be mindful of the rate limits and daily quotas. Exceeding these limits can result in your API key being temporarily or permanently disabled.

   **Example with Pagination:**
   ```python
   def google_search_with_pagination(query, api_key, cse_id, num=10, start=1):
       url = "https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1"
       params = {
           'q': query,
           'key': api_key,
           'cx': cse_id,
           'num': num,
           'start': start
       }
       response = requests.get(url, params=params)
       return response.json()

   # Fetch first 10 results
   results = google_search_with_pagination(query, api_key, cse_id, num=10, start=1)

   # Fetch next 10 results
   more_results = google_search_with_pagination(query, api_key, cse_id, num=10, start=11)

   print(results)
   print(more_results)
   ```

#### 3. **Compatibility with GAE:**
   - **urllib:** The `urllib` library is part of the Python standard library and is supported in GAE. You can use it for making HTTP requests if needed.
   - **Mechanize:** Mechanize is not included in the GAE environment, and its use is generally not recommended due to the complexity and potential issues with web scraping.

### Conclusion:
The best approach for your requirements is to use the Google Custom Search JSON API. This method is compliant with Google's Terms of Service and provides a structured way to access search results. While there are limitations on the number of results and the frequency of requests, this is the most reliable and legally sound solution.

If you need to process a very large number of links, consider combining the API with other data sources or implementing additional logic to handle the results efficiently within the API's constraints.
