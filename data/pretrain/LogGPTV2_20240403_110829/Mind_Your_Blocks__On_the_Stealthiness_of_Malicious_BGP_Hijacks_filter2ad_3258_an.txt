### Common Characteristics of Episodes 1 and 2

In this section, we analyze the common characteristics of all 2,620 short-lived BGP hijacks.

#### Duration and Announcement Patterns
Figure 8 illustrates the duration of the unadvertised period for all short-lived hijacked networks. Out of the 2,620 IP prefixes, 2,261 (86.3%) were never announced before they were hijacked. According to an informal discussion with a RIPE NCC executive [19], it is common practice for network operators to register and use publicly routable IP address blocks for internal network infrastructure. This could explain why no route to such blocks can be found in our BGP feed. Apart from this, we are not aware of any other reason why IP address blocks are registered but never actually announced. The remaining 359 networks were last announced between 6 days and 4 years before being hijacked, with an average of 24.6 months and a median of 24.5 months. Given that 72.4% of these IP prefixes were left unannounced for more than one year, we can conclude that attackers primarily target networks that have been unannounced for extended periods.

#### Registration Dates
It appears that 1,775 IP address ranges (67.8%) out of 2,620 were registered before 1997, when the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) began managing the registration of IP address resources and setting up the Internet Routing Registry (IRR). Network address ranges registered before 1997 may be particularly vulnerable due to their age and the potential lack of modern security measures.

### Temporal Correlation and Malicious Activities

Although only a part of the phenomenon is depicted in Figure 7, the pattern is recurrent and persistent over the complete 13-month period, from June 2013 to June 2014. This strongly suggests that the hijacks may have been performed using the same modus operandi. The fact that some groups of hijacks start only seconds after the end of previous groups further indicates that they might be carried out in an automated manner, possibly relying on an automated process to find and target network address blocks.

Strangely, we have not been able to detect any malicious traffic associated with the hijacked IP address blocks. The absence of spam and other scam-related traffic in our data may be due to incomplete visibility into malicious activities or could indicate that this is a moving infrastructure used to host servers, such as Command and Control (C&C) servers. However, we currently have no conclusive evidence to validate this hypothesis.

### Episode 1: February to May 2013

Figure 6 shows the temporal correlation of BGP announcements, spam emails, and blacklisted spam sources related to hijacked IP address ranges during the first episode between February and May 2013. For brevity, only a sample of 25 out of 58 IP address ranges is depicted. We observed that domain names, resolving to IP addresses within the hijacked IP address blocks, were used in parallel to send spam and host advertised scam websites. From whois information, we noted that these domain names were typically created within a few days before the networks were hijacked. This indicates that the attackers likely control the entire IP address blocks and fully exploit them.

Furthermore, spam emails collected by our spam traps were enriched with the names of the spambots associated with the spam, using CBL signatures [2]. Spam emails sent from the supposedly hijacked IP address blocks were not associated with any known spam botnet, suggesting that they were sent using a different type of spamming infrastructure. This is consistent with the BGP spectrum agility, where attackers can quickly switch and adapt their operations to evade detection.
