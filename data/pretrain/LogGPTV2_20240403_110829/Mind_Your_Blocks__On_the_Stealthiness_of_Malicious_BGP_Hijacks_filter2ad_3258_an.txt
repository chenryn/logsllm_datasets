all hijacks are actually performed by groups of two to
four preﬁxes, starting and ending at the same time;
during the 13 months period there are always, at any
point in time, at least two IP preﬁxes hijacked.
Although only part of the phenomenon is depicted in Figure 7,
it
is recurrent and persistant over the complete 13 month
period, between June 2013 and June 2014(6). This strongly
indicates that they may have been performed with the same
modus operandi. The fact that some groups of hijacks start
only seconds after the end of previous groups further suggests
that they might be carried out in an automated way, possibly
also relying on some automated process to ﬁnd target network
address blocks to hijack.
(C.1) Strangely enough, we have not been able to ﬁnd any
malicious trafﬁc associated with those hijacked IP address
blocks. The absence of spam and other scam-related trafﬁc in
our data may be due to incomplete visibility into malicious
activities associated with these networks, or could indicate
that this is a moving infrastructure to host servers, e.g., C&C
servers. We have currently no conclusive evidence to validate
this conjecture, though.
Common characteristics of episodes 1 and 2
In this section, we analyze common characteristics of all
2,620 short-lived hijacks.
(C.2) Figure 8 presents the duration of the unadvertised
period of all short-lived hijacked networks. 2,261 IP preﬁxes
(86.3%) were never announced before they were hijacked.
From an informal discussion with a RIPE NCC executive [19]
it is apparently common practice for network operators to
register and use publicly routable IP address blocks for internal
network infrastructure. This could explain why no route to such
block can be found in our BGP feed. Apart from this reason we
are not aware of any other reason why IP address blocks are
registered but never actually announced. The remaining 359
networks were last announced from 6 days to 4 years before
being hijacked with a average of 24.6 months and a median
of 24.5 months. With 72.4% of IP preﬁxes left unannounced
for more than one year we can conclude that attackers mostly
hijack networks left unannounced for a long period of time.
(C.3) It appears that 1,775 IP address ranges (67.8%) out
of 2,620 were registered before 1997 when the RIRs started
taking on the registration of IP address resources and setting
up the IRRs. Network address ranges registered before 1997

domain names, resolving to IP addresses belonging to the same
hijacked IP address blocks, showing that some IP addresses
were used in parallel to send spam and host the advertised
scam websites. From whois information, we observed that
these domain names were usually created within a few days
before the networks being hijacked. This shows that attackers,
very likely, control the entire IP address blocks and take full
advantage of them.
Furthermore, spam emails collected by our spamtraps
are enriched with the name of the spambot associated with
the spam, by taking advantage of CBL signatures [2]. Spam
emails sent from the supposedly hijacked IP address blocks
we uncovered were not associated with any known spam
botnet and thus must have been sent using another type
of spamming infrastructure, instead of the traditional spam
botnets. This is consistent with BGP spectrum agility where
