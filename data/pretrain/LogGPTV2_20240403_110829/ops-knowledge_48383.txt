User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Centralize Linux System Management We currently maintain several linux servers and are looking to employ sub contractors. However, we wan't to keep tabs on who does what on each server. Other then creating sudo accounts on every server, is there a centralized user management system that a user must log into and then are able to access or send commands to certain systems?

Assistant: Sounds like you require a centralised authentication system and a centralised audit system for monitoring.

You could configure a LDAP server for centralised authentication using the Linux PAM module. This server would manage Role Based Access Control and sudo permissions across systems.

For logging user activity, you could use something like snare, 日志易 etc for log shipping from each of the systems being worked on. You could search based on user or system to identify user activity and commands being run.
