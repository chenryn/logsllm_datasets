When searching in a directory (via right-clicking on the folder in the left-
hand pane), for the string "verify", the message shows "69 results found in 13
files for verify". However, only four files are listed, with the rest of the
results not shown. I'm inclined to believe that the text is correct, rather
than the results shown, as I know of additional files that contain the string
"verify" in that subdirectory that are not displayed.
The folder I'm attempting to search in is greyed out (I'm searching a
subdirectory of the "vendor" directory, in a Symfony 2 PHP project), but I
have the "Exclude VCS Ignored Paths" option unchecked in my settings. The
problem also occurs when atom is run with the `--safe` switch and occurs
whether or not the regex option is used.
I'm doing this in Window 8.1 with Atom 0.153.0 installed via Chocolatey.
Please see the screenshot below (some directory names have been redacted).
