Airshark offers a similar performance, is more cost effective as
it operates using commodity WiFi cards, and requires only a
software upgrade to be readily integrated in existing WLAN
deployments.
Recent research work [17, 21] also leverages specialized
hardware to detect non-WiFi devices. Hong et. al [17]
use a modiﬁed channel sounder to sample a wideband (100
MHz), and present novel cyclostationary signal analysis to
accurately detect non-WiFi devices. RFDump uses GNURadio
and employs timing/phase analysis along with protocol
speciﬁc demodulators to detect devices. Airshark builds such
functionality under the constraints of using commodity WiFi
hardware.
Using controlled measurements, prior work [9,13,15,22,25]
has studied the impact of non-WiFi devices on WiFi links. Many
of them have focused on targeted interference scenarios, e.g.,
between Bluetooth-WiFi [13] or ZigBee-WiFi [22, 25], and
a system that can detect hidden conﬂicts, to discard such cases
from the traces.
149proposed mechanisms for co-existence [10, 18]. Similar to [9,
15], we consider the general problem of non-WiFi interference,
but speciﬁcally, we focus on the problem of making existing
WiFi links better aware of non-WiFi RF devices, thereby paving
the way for corrective actions that can be implemented in
today’s networks. Further, our mechanism is complementary
to the above solutions, and can be used in conjunction to more
effectively tackle non-WiFi interference.
6. CONCLUSION
In this work, we ﬁrst motivated the need to detect non-
WiFi RF devices by characterizing their prevalence in typical
environments. We then presented Airshark, a system that
can detect the non-WiFi devices using only the functionality
provided by commodity WiFi cards. Airshark extracts unique
features using energy samples from a WiFi card and presents
a generic, and extensible framework to accurately detect
multiple non-WiFi devices, while maintaining a low false
positive rate. We also found its performance to be comparable
to a commercial signal analyzer. Through a deployment in two
production WLANs, we demonstrated Airshark’s potential in
understanding non-WiFi interference issues.
We envision embedding Airshark in commodity wireless
APs that opens up numerous other possibilities. WLAN
administrators can monitor RF device activity across the
network without deploying additional hardware. APs can
also employ
real-time, non-WiFi interference mitigation
mechanisms based on the input from Airshark (e.g., device
RSSI/channel). Another application is to physically locate
the RF interferer. Localization can be done by correlating
the device transmissions across samples from multiple Air-
shark nodes and then using triangulation methods.

“Airshark: Detecting Non-WiFi RF Devices Using 
Commodity WiFi Hardware” 
Authors: S. Rayanchu, A. Patro, S. Banerjee 
Reviewer #1 
Strengths:	 Though  overstated  repeatedly,  the  use  of  typical 
hardware  is  a  strength.  The  study  of  20  locations  and  the 
interfering objects in each is a bit of a contribution as a spot check 
(not as contribution #1).  
Weaknesses: The writing is poor, redundant, and compressed at a 
low  level,  making  it  difficult  to  extract  the  key  scientific 
contributions:  why  this  work  was  technically  difficult  and  what 
novel  method  emerged  to  address  that  problem.  The  practical 
implication is not quite apparent: if performance is poor, perhaps 
the remedy is the same no matter what the issue is. 
Comments  to  Authors:  Should  APs  simply  change  channels 
whenever  performance  is  poor  to  find  another?  Does  it  matter 
whether  the  channel  is  simply  oversubscribed  by  someone 
streaming video over 802.11 or is someone talking on a phone? I 
suspect not. This leaves much of your work an oversell: it’s great 
that  you  can  do  this,  and  I  think  it  may  have  implications  for 
backoff  parameters  and  rate  selection,  and  maybe  even  pop-ups 
for the user, but it doesn’t mean much for channel selection.  
Wouldn’t it be easier to tell people, “hey, this radio uses 2.4 GHz: 
don’t use a cordless phone on the same frequency.”? I suspect this 
problem will resolve itself.  
Contributions  1  and  3  seem  effectively  the  same.  I’d  rate  this 
paper higher if the tool were made available as a contribution for 
proper validation and use.  
Why is there a line on figure 3?  
What  is  the  source  of  error?  Why  is  airshark  ever  wrong?  Is 
airshark only wrong when it doesn’t matter (the interference is not 
strong?) Or just wrong 8% of the time for no good reason?  
The  microwave  comparison  is  pretty  obvious  given  prior  work 
that detected microwaves using commodity hardware. Since that 
work was published some time ago, the repeated assertion about 
using  “commodity”  hardware  was  not  as  impressive  to  me, 
especially  given  that  you’re  using  what  amounts  to  a  baby 
spectrum-analysis feature in the hardware that you’ve only shown 
is  present  in  one  card  from  one  manufacturer.  Was  that 
functionality included for this purpose? or for some other? If for 
some  other,  then  you’ve  done  something  interesting.  If  for  this 
purpose, and atheros just hasn’t gotten around to making a useful 
tool on it, good for you, but the “commodity” tag has less value. 
Reviewer #2 
Strengths:  Works  with  off  the  shelf  wifi  cards  Extensive 
evaluation well motivated with an empirical evaluation. 
Weaknesses:  Faulty  comparisons  with  prior  work;  could  be 
written  better;  it’s  never  clear  why the features picked were the 
right ones; it’s hard to understand performance wrt SNR, results 
presented in a card specific RSSI measure, but no noise figure is 
given, so hard to tell how robust the scheme is to low. 
Comments to Authors: I don’t quite understand what you mean 
by coarse resolution in time. Even though the Wifi card may be 
exposing energy averaged over small time windows, in the radio 
itself it is computing FFTs over digital samples whose rate is at 
least  the  Nyquist  rate,  if  not  more.  What  you  are  getting  is 
essentially FFTs over windows of samples, which is exacty what 
prior work like Wispy (Sigcomm 11) is using. So that statement 
isn’t correct  
Similarly I am confused by the resolution in frequency argument, 
isn’t it the same as computing FFT of a certain resolution? Maybe 
the Wifi card smoothens it a bit, but it’s not significantly different 
than a standard FFT resolution  
Prior  work  such  as  RFdump  and  Wispy  did  much  more  than 
device  detection,  RFdump  also  detects  bandwidth  occupancy  of 
non-Wifi  signals,  while  WiSpy  does  both  bandwidth  occupancy 
as well as angles of arrival. So while Airshark’s ability to work 
with commodity cards is nice, you do give up something in return. 
The paper should make that clearer. 
Reviewer #3 
Strengths:  Valiant  attempt  to  use  commodity  devices.  Fairly 
intuitive techniques. Results comparable to commercial detectors. 
Weaknesses:  Comparable  to  commercial  !=  advancing  the  state 
of the art. In particular, the technique seems sensitive to overlap 
in signals, whether from >1 non-wifi devices or between wifi and 
non-wifi interferer as would happen during a busy wifi period. 
It  isn’t  entirely  clear  from  the  suggested  applications  why 
knowing  which  non-wifi  device  is  causing  the  source  of 
interference 
important.  Yes,  for  diagnosis  and 
troubleshooting;  but to be able to shift to greener pastures upon 
interference  does  not  require  knowing  who  is  causing  the 
interference. 
Comments to Authors: I liked this paper. 
It is interesting that the characteristics of the non-wifi RF devices 
are  stark  enough  to  be  discovered  with  the  coarse  lens  of  a 
commodity  card  (freq  of  samples  is  low,  range  of  frequencies 
observable  at  the  same  time  is  small,  very  little  info  besides 
received signal strength etc.) 
terribly

151I would have liked further insight... Which of the several features 
that you mention were more accurate, more discriminative? How 
close were the devices in terms of signatures to each other? Can 
you tell apart different types of micro-waves? 
At  the  end  of  the  day,  modulo  troubleshooting  and  curiosity 
concerns, how does precise knowledge of the interferer help with 
system design? Changing channels for e.g., doesn’t require this. 
I  found  the  end  of  3.4,  dealing  with  overlapping  channels 
somewhat un-inspired. I realize the problem is harder, but there is 
a  fair  bit  that  can  still  be  done;  for  example,  Fig  14  clearly 
_looks_ like the composition of two signals. Can you not derive 
decision tree classifiers for frequently co-occurring compositions 
of signals? I know this space is larger, but as you conclude that 
only certain types of signals are likely to co-occur repeatedly, it 
might improve analysis to look for those. 
How many training samples do you end up using? (is this same as 
the # of samples for NKLD) 
Feature  F4  (pulse  signatures,  i.e.,  freq,  bandwidth,  duration)  is 
very similar to feature F1 (freq, bandwidth) 
Can hack to improve switching times between bands to a few ms 
from the 20ms if needed. (3.1) 
Techniques are fairly straightforward.  
F2  is  quite  cool,  looking  for  spread.  I  can’t  tell  how  much 
discriminative  power  there  is  in  it  though;  how  often  are  these 
spectral signatures different. Normalizing for power also gets you 
to look at different center frequencies, e.g., hoppers. 
In 3.4, creation of training data, using the “list of possible CFs” is 
key. Because, it is unlikely that you will be able to create training 
data that mimics all possible configurations of a certain device. I 
suspect  for  other  devices  you’d  have  to  incorporate  more  meta-
data beyond just the possible CFs. 
Can these techniques apply to non RF devices? The front-ends of 
the card can typically operate in a wider band than just RF. Not 
sure if other parts of the pipeline are specific to RF though. 
Reviewer #4 
Strengths: The proposed system has high detection accuracy The 
evaluation  was  solid  and  comprehensive.  The  paper  was  well 
structured. 
Weaknesses:  The technical contribution is not clearly described 
The characterization part is a bit weak See comments below for 
details. 
Comments to Authors: This is a solid piece of work, in terms of 
both  characterization  and  system  evaluation.  I  also  like  Section 
4.3  that  presents  example  users  of  Airshark.  There  are  however 
two concerns about the paper.  
First, the technical contribution is not clear. Section 3 of the paper 
is  really  long  and  boring.  It  exposes  too  many  details  without 
clearly  justifying  how  authors  address  the  four  challenges 
mentioned  at  the  beginning  of  Section  3.  In  other  words,  the 
authors  employ  standard  technique  for  each  building  block  of 
Airshark while it remains unclear how these building blocks are 
magically assembled to a novel system that achieves qualitatively 
similar accuracy on commodity WiFi devices compared to those 
on  sophisticated  spectrum  analyzers.  A  more  clear  high-level 
picture is critical in Section 3. I suggest that the authors expand 
the overview part and shorten the remaining part.  
Second,  Section  2  measures  the  prevalence  of  non-WiFi  RF 
devices  in  terms  of  device  popularity,  session  duration,  signal 
strengths,  and  concurrency  at  different  locations.  One  critical 
question remains unanswered is: in such real environments, how 
do  these  non-WiFi  devices  affect  WiFi  performance?  You  can 
measure  this  by  establishing  long-lived  data  transfer  sessions 
using WiFi and monitoring the performance. 
Reviewer #5 
Strengths: Sound techiques and good experimental results. 
Weaknesses: The techniques are a little incremental and may not 
work as well as cyclo-stationary analysis. 
Comments  to  Authors:  This  is  a  strong  wireless  network 
measurement paper. Unlike existing work on measuring non-WiFi 
devices,  this  paper  adds  an  interesting  twist  that  the  detection 
done  on  WiFi  devices.  This  new  twist  makes  the  problem more 
challenging.  On  the  other  hand,  does  not  come  for  free because 
WiFi devices cannot receive signals at arbitrary SNR or arbitrary 
channel  width.  As  future  work,  it’d  very  interesting  to  directly 
compare  the  results  with  those  obtained  from  using  more 
powerful  spectrum  analyzers  (e.g.,  “DOF:  A  Local  Wireless 
Information Plane”).  
Identifying a single interference is relatively easy since the types 
of  signatures  associated  with  Zigbee,  Microwaves,  and  cordless 
phones are known. The challenge lies in how to classify signals 
when  multiple  interference  are  present.  To  this  problem,  the 
solution in this paper are not robust and may under-perform some 
existing  approaches,  like  cyclo-stationary  analysis.  In  fact,  the 
paper claims that cyclo-stationary analysis is not applicable to this 
context. Why? Please elaborate.  
The paper could also be strengthened by giving some applications 
of the classification. After knowing the type of interference, how 
can we use this information to improve WiFi performance? 
Response from the Authors 
We  would  like  to  thank  the  reviewers  for  the  constructive 
comments that helped improve the paper. We have fixed the text 
in  the  paper  to  address  some  of  the  reviewer  concerns  and 
expanded some portions to make the technical contributions more 
clear. Some of the reviewer comments seemed to have stemmed 
because of confusion regarding understanding some of the aspects 
of  our  work  and  how  Airshark’s  design  was  driven  by  the 
constraints  imposed  by  commodity  WiFi  cards.  Below,  we 
address these concerns: 
Sources  of  error  (Reviewer  1):  Airshark  can  make  an  error  in 
detection  under  when  the  signal  strength  of  non-WiFi  device  is 
low (< -80 dBm) or under extreme WiFi interference (specifically 
explained in Sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2). 
Prior work on detecting Microwave ovens (Reviewer 1): We are 
not  aware  of  any  prior  work  which  detects  microwave  oven 
152activity  using  a  systematic  approach  that  works  only  using 
commodity  WiFi  hardware, and the reviewer does not specify a 
reference.  Jigsaw  work  (Sigcomm’07)/Shaman  (UCSD  Tech. 
report) seems to the only work that indirectly “speculates” that a 
microwave oven might be active by looking into physical errors 
experienced by links --- the scheme requires “enough” packets to 
be in error, and will fail to detect the microwave oven in presence 
of  interference  from  other  non-WiFi  devices  (e.g.,  an  analog 
phone or a high duty video camera). 
Confusion  regarding  prior  work  on  device  detection  (Reviewer 
2,5):  Prior  work  like  Wispy/DOF  (Sigcomm  ‘11)  requires  “raw 
digital  samples”  (not  exposed  by  WiFi  cards) 
to  apply 
cyclostationary  analysis  and  detect  angles  of  arrival.  Such 
analysis is not possible with commodity WiFi cards as they only 
expose  the  receiver  power  samples.  Compared  to  RFDump, 
Airshark  does  (and  needs  to)  estimate  the  bandwidth  of  the 
wireless signals to detect them (see Section 3.2). 
Concerns regarding motivation behind our work (Reviewer 1,3): 
Comments  from  Reviewer  1  seems  to  suggest  some  confusion 
regarding  understanding  the  motivation  behind  device  detection. 
Changing  channels/widths  was  only  included  as  an  example 
reaction on behalf of APs to tackle a specific type of interference. 
We believe that the remedial action would depend on the type of 
device causing interference and may definitely include adjusting 
other  operational  wireless  parameters 
like  backoff/bit-
rate/transmit  power.  We  agree  with  Reviewer  3  that  knowing 
what  devices  are  in  the  air  definitely  provides  the  WLAN 
administrator with a better picture for troubleshooting concerns. 
Overlapping  signal  detection  (Reviewer  3):  We  agree  that  the 
overlapping  signal  detection  can  be  improved  by  adding  more 
functionality  to  the  decision  tree  classifier.  We  will  certainly 
incorporate the suggested ideas and benchmark this case further in 
our future work. 
Impact of non-WiFi devices on real WiFi networks (Reviewer 4): 
We  agree  with  the  reviewer’s  concern  that  it  is  important  to  be 
able  to  detect  the  impact  of  non-WiFi  devices  on  WiFi  links  in 
real environments. While Section 4.3 does provide some evidence 
in  this  regard,  there  is  a  need  for  a  solution  that  answers  these 
questions more systematically. We believe Airshark is only a first 
step  toward  effectively  managing  non-WiFi  interference.  Our 
current efforts are indeed focused on developing a system that can 
answer these questions.
