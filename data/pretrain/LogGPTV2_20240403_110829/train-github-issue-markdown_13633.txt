To track the issue, even though @rvraghav93 said he'll work on it ;)
Nested cross-validation was possible before, but not when providing a custom
cv object and either stratification or the number of samples not being
divisible by the number of folds.  
Maybe StratifiedShuffleSplit would be a good example.
