ABSTRACT
Passwords are widely used for user authentication, but they
are often diﬃcult for a user to recall, easily cracked by auto-
mated programs and heavily reused. Security questions are
also used for secondary authentication. They are more mem-
orable than passwords, but are very easily guessed. We pro-
pose a new authentication mechanism, called“life-experience
passwords (LEPs),” which outperforms passwords and secu-
rity questions, both at recall and at security. Each LEP
consists of several facts about a user-chosen past experi-
ence, such as a trip, a graduation, a wedding, etc. At LEP
creation, the system extracts these facts from the user’s in-
put and transforms them into questions and answers. At
authentication, the system prompts the user with questions
and matches her answers with the stored ones.
In this paper we propose two LEP designs, and evalu-
ate them via user studies. We further compare LEPs to
passwords, and ﬁnd that: (1) LEPs are 30–47 bits stronger
than an ideal, randomized, 8-character password, (2) LEPs
are up to 3× more memorable, and (3) LEPs are reused
half as often as passwords. While both LEPs and security
questions use personal experiences for authentication, LEPs
use several questions, which are closely tailored to each user.
This increases LEP security against guessing attacks. In our
evaluation, only 0.7% of LEPs were guessed by friends, while
prior research found that friends could guess 17–25% of se-
curity questions. LEPs also contained a very small amount
of sensitive or fake information. All these qualities make
LEPs a promising, new authentication approach.

INTRODUCTION
Textual passwords are widely used for user authentication.
An ideal password should be easy for a user to remember,
but diﬃcult for others to guess. These two requirements are
at odds. People remember by relating their passwords to
some personally salient facts – but this leads to common and

predictable patterns in passwords that make them insecure
against automated guessing [95, 66]. Users also tend to reuse
their passwords, to achieve memorability. But this lowers
security, because passwords stolen from one server can be
used to gain access to another one.
Many alternatives to textual passwords have been pro-
posed, such as graphical passwords, cognitive authentica-
tion, one-time passwords, hardware tokens, phone-aided au-
thentication and biometric passwords. However, research
has shown that none of these can oﬀer convenience, sim-
plicity, and user familiarity [68, 69] comparable to that of
textual passwords. We thus focus on trying to improve text-
based authentication.
Our insight is that it is highly unnatural to humans to
create new, complex memories (passwords) and recall them
in minute detail (e.g., recall capitalization and placement
of special characters) after a long time period, and without
any hints. Humans remember by association, relating new
facts to existing memories [88]. This makes it diﬃcult to
create and recall many new, strong passwords. Humans also
recall by reconstructing facts, sometimes imprecisely, from
relevant data stored in the brain [88]. Thus a user may recall
that they used a family member’s name plus their birth year
for a password, but forget which family member they chose,
if they used their ﬁrst or last name, how it was capitalized,
etc. This makes it diﬃcult to precisely recall passwords.
We propose a new authentication method — life-experience
passwords (LEPs) — which extracts authentication secrets
out of a user’s existing memories, and uses prompts and
imprecise matching at the authentication stage to further
improve recall. Our contribution lies in design and imple-
mentation of this authentication method, and its evaluation
via two human user studies.
A LEP consists of several facts about a user-chosen life
experience, such as a trip, a graduation, a wedding, a place,
etc. At password creation, the system prompts the user for
the experience’s title, and for facts relating to this experi-
ence, such as names of people and locations, special objects
and activities, dates, etc. These facts are transformed by
the system into questions – stored in clear – and answers
– stored hashed and salted. At authentication, the system
prompts the user with corresponding questions, and matches
her answers with those stored by the system, allowing for
imprecise matches due to extraneous words, capitalization,
punctuation and reordering. LEPs could be used for pri-
mary or secondary authentication, in cases when high recall
and high security are desired.

Figure 1: Security questions versus LEP example for “high school” topic.
We designed and evaluated two LEP designs in human
user studies, approved by our institutional IRB, to evalu-
ate their recall and security. We found that: (1) LEPs are
30–47 bits stronger than an ideal, randomized, 8-character
password, averaging 83–100 bits of strength against statisti-
cal attacks (2) LEPs are 2–3× more memorable than pass-
words, having 73% recall after a week and 54% recall after
3–6 months and (3) LEPs are reused half as often as pass-
words.
LEPs resemble security questions, in that both use per-
sonal experiences for authentication. But LEPs use more
diverse, unique, and memorable personal facts than security
questions, and these are deeper, more speciﬁc facts. This
makes LEPs hard to guess by friends or attackers, who use
social networks or public sources. When compared with se-
curity questions, (1) LEPs are 24–35× harder to guess by
friends (only 0.7% of LEPs were guessed in our study), (2)
LEPs contain 2.4–3.2× fewer fake answers (11.5% and 15.7%
LEPs are potentially fake, versus 37% of security questions).
There are two downsides to LEPs: (1) user burden for cre-
ating and authenticating with a LEP is 3–6× higher than
when using passwords – this burden may be prohibitive
for some applications and devices, (2) LEPs may contain
sensitive information, which poses a privacy risk. While
these are serious drawbacks, our human user study found
that 93.7% of users would use LEPs for high-security con-
tent (e.g., banking applications). We further found that
only 3% of LEPs contained generally sensitive information,
which could be further reduced with better user prompts.
We thus believe that LEPs are a promising authentication
method for some users and applications.

our evaluation of LEPs, and Section 6 oﬀers our conclusions.
2. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
There is much research on non-textual alternatives to pass-
words, such as graphical passwords [83, 41, 75, 42, 43, 82, 9,
65], video passwords [97, 76] and biometric passwords [60].
Due to space limitations, we only survey research that is
directly related to textual passwords.
Improving Password Strength. A few recent publica-
tions [72, 95, 85, 81] proposed improvements in password de-
sign using Markov models, semantic patterns of passwords,
and user feedback. For example, Telepathwords [85] help
users create strong passwords by comparing user input with
popular substrings. When such a substring is detected,
Telepathwords provides actionable, real-time feedback to steer
a user towards a diﬀerent choice.
In [81] the system ran-
domly generates strong passwords and then allows a user to
replace a few characters to make the password more memo-
rable. All these techniques increase password strength, but
do not improve memorability nor diversity, and all require
users to create new memories of complex strings. Our work
on LEPs diﬀers fundamentally from these approaches be-
cause we seek to exploit existing memories and thus increase
strength, memorability and diversity of textual passwords.
Security Questions. Security questions [80] are often
used for secondary authentication, e.g., when a user loses her
password, or to supplement password-based authentication
for high-security servers (e.g., bank). A user is oﬀered a
choice of a small number of ﬁxed questions, such as mother’s
maiden name, pet names, favorite teacher names, best friend
names, etc. While both security questions and LEPs use
personal knowledge for authentication, there are signiﬁcant
diﬀerences. We discuss them here and summarize them in
Figure 1, which also illustrates sample security questions
and a LEP on the high school topic.
Applicability. Organizations usually oﬀer a very limited
choice of security questions. There may be users to whom
no question applies. For example, a user may not have a
favorite high school teacher or a best friend, or may have
multiple teachers/friends that she likes. When faced with
such questions users select answers that they do not recall
at authentication time. Schechter et al. [91] and Bonneau
et al. [67] measured that 20–40% of security questions can-
not be recalled by users. Conversely, during LEP creation
users can choose, with very little constraint, the topic they
want to talk about and the facts about that topic, which are
memorable to them. This leads to more personalized facts
and thus higher recall.
Depth of facts. Security questions ask for shallow facts
(e.g., pet’s name, best friend’s name), which are generally
applicable to many users. Such facts can be mined from pub-
lic sources [79, 91], or guessed using statistical attacks [67].
Easy guessability leads users to provide fake answers to se-
curity questions, which leads to low recall when they cannot
remember the fake answers. On another hand, LEPs ask
for deep facts – memorable people, places, activities or ob-
jects in connection with a user-chosen event. Answers to
such questions are not easily found on social networks, or
114
guessed by family and friends, which removes the need for
users to lie. In our studies, only 0.7% of LEPs were guessed
by friends (compared to 17–25% of security questions [91])
and only 11.5–15.7% of answers were fake (compared to 37%
for security questions [67]).
Number of facts. Security questions contain only one fact,
which may be easily guessed or obtained from public sources.
LEPs contain a larger number of facts, and a user must recall
most or all of them for authentication. Thus the barrier for
a successful guessing attack is higher.
Another approach to security questions is to let users
choose the questions themselves. This allows users to freely
choose facts that are relevant to them, but decreases secu-
rity [84, 91]. While LEPs also allow users to choose which
facts to provide, our fact elicitation guides them toward se-
cure, memorable and stable facts. This allows LEPs to out-
perform user-chosen security questions.
Cognitive Passwords. Similar to LEPs, cognitive pass-
words are based on personal facts, interests, and opinions
that are thought to be easily recalled by a user. Article [12]
provides an overview, deﬁnitions, and some examples of cog-
nitive passwords. Das et al. [74] and Nosseir et al. [90] ex-
plore autobiographical authentication that uses facts about
past events, which are captured by smartphones or calen-
dars, without any user input. While such information may
be memorable in short intervals after it is collected, humans
do not remember ordinary daily events for long periods nor
with great consistency [71]. On the other hand, LEPs re-
quire more user eﬀort during creation, but elicit more salient
facts [89, 71], which is essential for good recall.
Narrative Authentication. Somayaji et al. [94] pro-
pose use of narratives for user authentication, but do not
evaluate them. Their narratives require users to associate
imaginary objects with past memories (e.g., contents of a
drawer from a childhood bedroom), and may also be fully
ﬁctional. Because these narratives lack personal signiﬁcance
to user, we expect they would be less memorable than LEPs.
3. LIFE-EXPERIENCE PASSWORDS
This section describes the design and the implementation
of life-experience passwords (LEPs). We discuss our choices
for LEP topics and facts in Section 3.1, attacker models and
strength calculation in Section 3.2, the LEP creation process
in Section 3.3, LEP-based authentication in Section 3.4 and
LEP uses in Section 3.5.
Figure 2 shows the LEP creation process. A user identiﬁes
a life-experience she wants to use for a LEP. She then inputs
a title for this experience and recounts interesting facts, with
some guidance from the system. The system mines the facts
from the user’s input, and transforms them into question-
and-answer pairs. Questions and the title must be stored as
clear text, because they are shown to users during authen-
tication. To store the answers, we concatenate either all of
them, or several subsets (see Section 3.4), add the salt, and
hash the resulting string(s). During authentication, the sys-
tem displays the title and the questions, and user answers
are hashed and compared to those stored by the system us-
ing imprecise matching.

produce facts, which can be accurately recalled by users,
and cannot be easily guessed by others.
Which experiences can be used for LEPs? Letting
a user freely select an experience to talk about, without any
guidance, may not produce secure and memorable input,
as shown by research on self-built security questions [84,
91]. This motivated us to build a list of diverse and general
topics, to guide password creation (see Table 2).

How to elicit useful facts? A useful fact is a fact that
is strong, stable and immutable.
A strong fact has many possible answers to the question,
which gives it strength against brute-force attacks (see Sec-
tion 3.2).
A stable fact is consistently recalled by a user. We have
learned by exploring several LEP designs that stability is
inﬂuenced the most by the fact’s type and our elicitation
method. Subjective facts about feelings and opinions are in-
consistently recalled by users. We thus ask about objective
facts, such as names, locations, times, objects and activi-
ties. Further, elicitation speciﬁcity makes a large diﬀerence.
The more speciﬁc questions we pose during elicitation, the
more stable facts we get. A user may use multiple terms for
the same person (e.g., “my mom”, “mom”, “mother”, “Jen-
nifer”). Transforming “who” questions into “ﬁrst and last
name” questions reduces the ambiguity and increases sta-
bility of answers. Another source of instability comes from
asking for a singular answer to a question that may have a
plural answer (e.g., a user has two best friends). Asking too
speciﬁc questions (e.g., “what is the ﬁrst and last name ...”
but the user only recalls the ﬁrst name) or questions that do
not apply to a given user (e.g., a pet’s name when the user
does not own a pet) also leads to unstable facts. We believe
that stability issues, more than lying, may be responsible
for many authentication failures found in the past studies of
security questions [91, 67]. We have reﬁned our elicitation
process to contain very speciﬁc prompts, which depend on
the user’s prior input. This leads to stable facts.
An immutable fact does not change over time. For this
reason we do not ask about preferences and opinions (e.g.,
“What is your favorite band”), which are mutable.
