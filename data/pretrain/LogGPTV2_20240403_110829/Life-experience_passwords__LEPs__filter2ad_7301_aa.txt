## Abstract
Passwords are widely used for user authentication, but they often pose challenges in terms of recall, security, and reuse. Security questions, while more memorable, are easily guessed. We propose a new authentication mechanism called "life-experience passwords (LEPs)," which outperforms both passwords and security questions in terms of recall and security. Each LEP consists of several facts about a user-chosen past experience, such as a trip, a graduation, or a wedding. During LEP creation, the system extracts these facts from the user's input and transforms them into questions and answers. At authentication, the system prompts the user with these questions and matches the responses with the stored answers.

In this paper, we present two LEP designs and evaluate them through user studies. Our findings indicate that:
1. LEPs are 30–47 bits stronger than an ideal, randomized, 8-character password.
2. LEPs are up to 3 times more memorable.
3. LEPs are reused half as often as passwords.

While both LEPs and security questions use personal experiences, LEPs employ multiple, closely tailored questions, enhancing their security against guessing attacks. In our evaluation, only 0.7% of LEPs were guessed by friends, compared to 17–25% of security questions. Additionally, LEPs contain very little sensitive or fake information. These qualities make LEPs a promising new approach to authentication.

## 1. Introduction
Textual passwords are widely used for user authentication. An ideal password should be easy to remember but difficult to guess. However, these requirements often conflict. Users tend to create passwords based on personally significant facts, leading to common and predictable patterns that are vulnerable to automated guessing [95, 66]. Password reuse further compromises security, as stolen passwords from one server can be used to access another.

Various alternatives to textual passwords have been proposed, including graphical passwords, cognitive authentication, one-time passwords, hardware tokens, phone-aided authentication, and biometric passwords. However, none of these methods offer the convenience, simplicity, and user familiarity of textual passwords [68, 69]. Therefore, we focus on improving text-based authentication.

Our insight is that it is unnatural for humans to create and recall complex, new memories without hints. Humans remember by association, linking new facts to existing memories [88]. This makes it challenging to create and recall many strong, new passwords. Recall also involves reconstructing facts, sometimes imprecisely, from relevant data stored in the brain [88].

We propose life-experience passwords (LEPs), which extract authentication secrets from a user’s existing memories and use prompts and imprecise matching at the authentication stage to improve recall. Our contribution lies in the design, implementation, and evaluation of this method through two human user studies.

A LEP consists of several facts about a user-chosen life experience, such as a trip, a graduation, or a wedding. During LEP creation, the system prompts the user for the experience's title and related facts, such as names, locations, objects, activities, and dates. These facts are transformed into questions (stored in clear) and answers (hashed and salted). At authentication, the system prompts the user with corresponding questions and matches the responses, allowing for imprecise matches due to extraneous words, capitalization, punctuation, and reordering. LEPs can be used for primary or secondary authentication, especially when high recall and security are desired.

### Comparison with Security Questions
LEPs and security questions both use personal experiences for authentication. However, LEPs use multiple, specific, and personalized questions, making them more secure against guessing attacks. In our study, only 0.7% of LEPs were guessed by friends, compared to 17–25% of security questions. Additionally, LEPs contain fewer fake answers (11.5–15.7% vs. 37%).

### Evaluation Findings
1. LEPs are 30–47 bits stronger than an ideal, randomized, 8-character password, averaging 83–100 bits of strength against statistical attacks.
2. LEPs are 2–3 times more memorable, with 73% recall after a week and 54% recall after 3–6 months.
3. LEPs are reused half as often as passwords.

### Drawbacks
1. The user burden for creating and authenticating with a LEP is 3–6 times higher than with passwords, which may be prohibitive for some applications and devices.
2. LEPs may contain sensitive information, posing a privacy risk. However, only 3% of LEPs in our study contained generally sensitive information, which could be further reduced with better user prompts.

Despite these drawbacks, 93.7% of users in our study indicated they would use LEPs for high-security content, such as banking applications. We believe LEPs are a promising authentication method for certain users and applications. Interested readers can try LEPs by visiting our project page: http://leps.isi.edu/demo.

## 2. Background and Related Work
There is extensive research on non-textual alternatives to passwords, such as graphical passwords [83, 41, 75, 42, 43, 82, 9, 65], video passwords [97, 76], and biometric passwords [60]. Due to space limitations, we focus on research directly related to textual passwords.

### Improving Password Strength
Recent publications [72, 95, 85, 81] have proposed improvements in password design using Markov models, semantic patterns, and user feedback. For example, Telepathwords [85] helps users create strong passwords by comparing user input with popular substrings and providing real-time feedback. Other techniques generate strong passwords and allow users to modify a few characters for memorability. While these methods increase password strength, they do not improve memorability or diversity and require users to create new, complex memories. Our work on LEPs differs fundamentally because we leverage existing memories to enhance strength, memorability, and diversity.

### Security Questions
Security questions [80] are often used for secondary authentication, such as when a user loses their password or for high-security servers (e.g., banks). A user is offered a limited set of fixed questions, such as mother’s maiden name, pet names, favorite teacher names, and best friend names. Both security questions and LEPs use personal knowledge, but there are significant differences.

#### Applicability
Organizations typically offer a limited choice of security questions, which may not apply to all users. For example, a user may not have a favorite high school teacher or a best friend, or may have multiple teachers/friends. When faced with such questions, users may select answers they cannot recall later. Studies by Schechter et al. [91] and Bonneau et al. [67] found that 20–40% of security questions cannot be recalled by users. In contrast, LEPs allow users to choose a topic and related facts, leading to more personalized and memorable information.

#### Depth of Facts
Security questions ask for shallow, generally applicable facts (e.g., pet’s name, best friend’s name), which can be mined from public sources [79, 91] or guessed using statistical attacks [67]. This leads users to provide fake answers, resulting in low recall. LEPs, however, ask for deep, specific facts related to a user-chosen event, such as memorable people, places, activities, or objects. Such facts are not easily found on social networks or guessed by family and friends, reducing the need for users to lie. In our studies, only 0.7% of LEPs were guessed by friends, and only 11.5–15.7% of answers were fake.

#### Number of Facts
Security questions contain only one fact, which can be easily guessed or obtained from public sources. LEPs contain multiple facts, and a user must recall most or all of them for authentication, increasing the barrier for successful guessing attacks.

Another approach to security questions is to let users choose their own questions. This allows users to select relevant facts but decreases security [84, 91]. LEPs also allow users to choose facts, but our elicitation process guides them toward secure, memorable, and stable facts, making LEPs more effective than user-chosen security questions.

### Cognitive Passwords
Cognitive passwords are based on personal facts, interests, and opinions that are thought to be easily recalled by a user [12]. Das et al. [74] and Nosseir et al. [90] explore autobiographical authentication using facts about past events captured by smartphones or calendars. While such information may be memorable in the short term, humans do not remember ordinary daily events for long periods with great consistency [71]. LEPs require more user effort during creation but elicit more salient and stable facts, essential for good recall.

### Narrative Authentication
Somayaji et al. [94] propose using narratives for user authentication but do not evaluate them. Their narratives involve associating imaginary objects with past memories (e.g., contents of a drawer from a childhood bedroom) and may be fully fictional. Because these narratives lack personal significance, they are likely less memorable than LEPs.

## 3. Life-Experience Passwords
This section describes the design and implementation of LEPs. We discuss LEP topics and facts in Section 3.1, attacker models and strength calculation in Section 3.2, the LEP creation process in Section 3.3, LEP-based authentication in Section 3.4, and LEP uses in Section 3.5.

### 3.1 Topics and Facts
During LEP creation, users need guidance to recall interesting facts. Elicitation must produce facts that are accurately recalled by users and difficult for others to guess.

#### Which Experiences Can Be Used for LEPs?
Allowing users to freely select an experience without guidance may not produce secure and memorable input [84, 91]. Therefore, we provide a list of diverse and general topics to guide LEP creation (see Table 2).

| Category | Subcategory |
|----------|-------------|
| Event    | Engagement, wedding, birth, death, accident, graduation, party, trip |
| Learning | Driving, skiing, snowboarding, swimming, biking, skill/art, language |
| About    | Person, place |

#### How to Elicit Useful Facts?
A useful fact is strong, stable, and immutable.

- **Strong Fact**: Has many possible answers, providing strength against brute-force attacks.
- **Stable Fact**: Consistently recalled by the user. Stability is influenced by the fact type and elicitation method. Objective facts (names, locations, times, objects, activities) are more consistently recalled. Specific questions reduce ambiguity and increase stability.
- **Immutable Fact**: Does not change over time. Preferences and opinions (e.g., favorite band) are mutable and thus not asked.

### 3.2 Attacker Models and Strength Calculation
We consider various attacker models and calculate the strength of LEPs against statistical and brute-force attacks. The strength is determined by the number of possible answers and the difficulty of guessing.

### 3.3 LEP Creation Process
Figure 2 illustrates the LEP creation process. A user selects a life experience, inputs a title, and recounts interesting facts with system guidance. The system mines these facts, transforms them into question-and-answer pairs, and stores the questions and title in clear text. Answers are concatenated, salted, and hashed. During authentication, the system displays the title and questions, and the user's answers are hashed and matched with stored values, allowing for imprecise matches.

### 3.4 LEP-Based Authentication
During authentication, the system prompts the user with the questions and matches the responses with the stored answers, allowing for minor variations in the responses.

### 3.5 LEP Uses
LEPs can be used for primary or secondary authentication, particularly in scenarios requiring high recall and security.

## 4. Human Studies Setup
We designed and evaluated two LEP designs in human user studies, approved by our institutional IRB, to assess recall and security.

## 5. Evaluation Results
Our evaluation found that:
1. LEPs are 30–47 bits stronger than an ideal, randomized, 8-character password, averaging 83–100 bits of strength against statistical attacks.
2. LEPs are 2–3 times more memorable, with 73% recall after a week and 54% recall after 3–6 months.
3. LEPs are reused half as often as passwords.

## 6. Conclusions
LEPs offer a promising new approach to authentication, combining high security and memorability. Despite the higher user burden and potential privacy risks, 93.7% of users in our study indicated they would use LEPs for high-security content. We believe LEPs are a valuable addition to the authentication landscape, particularly for applications where security and recall are paramount.
