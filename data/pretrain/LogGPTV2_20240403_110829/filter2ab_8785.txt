**ATT&CK ID:** T0829  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Loss of View

Adversaries may cause a sustained or permanent loss of visibility, requiring local, hands-on operator intervention to restore normal operations. This can include actions such as restarting the system or manually operating the equipment. By inducing a prolonged reporting or visibility outage, adversaries can effectively conceal the current operational state. Notably, this loss of view can occur without directly impacting the physical processes themselves.
