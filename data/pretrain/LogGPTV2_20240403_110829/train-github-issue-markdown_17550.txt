The following:
    `${foo}`
transpiles to:
    "" + foo;
However, concatenating to an empty string actually calls `valueOf`, not
`toString`, and as such is not correct. See the following JS:
    var x = { toString: function () { return NaN; }, valueOf: function () { return Infinity; }};
    [x.toString(), x + '', String(x)]
    /* note that only the third item is both a string, and the toString value */
It should transpile to:
    String(foo)
