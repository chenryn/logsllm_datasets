User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Someone is trying to access my mail account, what safe actions can I take? Intro

I have a free mail account on this (german) website. If I type my password wrong I get, once successfully logged in, a message telling me about my failed log-in attempt.

Problem

Recently I noticed that from day to day the site notifies me of numerous failed log-in attempts (between 8 and 32). There is no feature as in GMail, where location and device of the failed log-in are recorded, so I am a bit in the dark. And also quite worried.

Question

I have changed my password everday for four days now. Immediately closing the account is not an option since I still have to compile a list where this mail address is used.

What appropriate steps to secure my account are to be taken at this point?

Update

The log-in attempts have declined over the last three days, maxing out at around ten altogether. Yesterday there was no failed log-in attempt logged.
Nevertheless I resorted to your many suggestions and


contacted GMX support, but have not heard back from them (certainly not using their 3€/min rip-off hotline)
started using a password manager
created easy-to-remember-but-hard-to-guess passwords
started forwarding mails from the affected account to a more safe mail service
learned about 2FA
wrote down all the sites and services the affected address is used with, in order to swiftly be able to close my account


Since there are many good answers I will wait a few days and mark the one with the most up-votes as the final answer. Thanks for your help!

Assistant: As far as I can tell, gmx does currently not offer 2FA. That is unfortunate but not necessarily catastrophic.

Do you have to use the address to send e-mail? If not you might be able to get around the problem by just forwarding incoming mail to another account, preferably one with 2FA enabled. After you set up a forwarding rule, you can put a really, really long and secure password (50+chars) on the account and save it somewhere safe.

Otherwise you'll probably have no real chance to secure the account itself.

You are currently using passwords with a length greater than 20 chars, I hope? If not, start doing so immediately. Use a password safe so you don't have to memorize them.

Also, please get the gmx security team involved. Probably it's just skiddies or bots (I had an attack like that on an old address I don't use anymore) but if not they might be thankful for a hint.



Note that I mentioned using a long password and not one drawing from a large character set.

The complexity of the character set does not by itself make your password better. Length runs circles around complexity while juggling chainsaws.
