User: I'm trying to get the Google Cloud Debugger to work on my Python App Engine module. I've followed the instructions and:

Connected to my Bitbucket hosted repository.
Generated the source-context.json and source-contexts.json using gcloud preview app gen-repo-info-file
Uploaded using appcfg.py update

However when I try to set a snapshot using the console, there is message saying:

The selected debug target does not have source revision information. The source shown here may not match the deployed source.

And when I try to set the snapshot point, I get the error:

Failed to update the snapshot
Assistant: It looks like you did everything correctly.
The "Failed to update the snapshot" error shows up when there is some problem on the Cloud Debugger backend. Please contact the Cloud Debugger team through cdbg-feedback@google.com or submit feedback report in Google Developer Console.
