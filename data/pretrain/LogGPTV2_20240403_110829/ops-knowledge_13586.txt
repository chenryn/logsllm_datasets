I am attempting to set up the Google Cloud Debugger for my Python App Engine module, but I am encountering some issues. Here are the steps I have taken:

1. Connected my Bitbucket-hosted repository.
2. Generated `source-context.json` and `source-contexts.json` using the command `gcloud preview app gen-repo-info-file`.
3. Uploaded the files using `appcfg.py update`.

However, when I try to set a snapshot via the console, I receive the following message:

> The selected debug target does not have source revision information. The source shown here may not match the deployed source.

Additionally, when I attempt to set a snapshot point, I encounter the error:

> Failed to update the snapshot

Could you please provide guidance on how to resolve these issues?

**Response:**

It appears that you have followed the correct steps. The "Failed to update the snapshot" error typically indicates a problem with the Cloud Debugger backend. To address this issue, please contact the Cloud Debugger team at `cdbg-feedback@google.com` or submit a feedback report through the Google Developer Console. They will be able to assist you further and help resolve any backend-related issues.
