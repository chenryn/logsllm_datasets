**What is the current behavior?**
### Class hierarchy
                Main (entry, common chunk)
               /    \
         ClassA      ClassB
           \          \
            \          ClassC
             \         /
           ReusableComponent
Main require ClassA and ClassB using require.ensure().  
ClassB require ClassC using require.ensure().  
ClassA and ClassC require ReusableComponent using simple require().
Finaly webpack emits following chunks:
  * 0.js - contains ClassA, **ReusableComponent**
  * 1.js - contains ClassB
  * 2.js - contains ClassC, **ReusableComponent**
  * main.js - contains Main class
### Problem
I try to configure CommonsChunkPlugin to move ReusableClass to main chunk in
order to remove code duplication.
    new webpack.optimize.CommonsChunkPlugin({
                name: 'main',
                minChunks: 2,
                children: true
            })
And webpack does not do this.
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**

**What is the expected behavior?**  
ReusableCompoent class has to move to chunk main.
