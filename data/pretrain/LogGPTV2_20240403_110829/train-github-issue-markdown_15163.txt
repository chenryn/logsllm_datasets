Hi,
I just managed to compile a 64-bit version of latest numpy git-master on
Windows 7 Prof. 64-bit and VS2008 Express Edition + PSDK 6.1. I would like to
provide some input for "Microsoft Toolchain Support" wiki page
(http://projects.scipy.org/numpy/wiki/MicrosoftToolchainSupport), since it's
not too specific on how this is done.
I installed the following packages:
  * "Windows SDK for Windows Server 2008 and .NET Framework 3.5":[[BR]]
  * download link: http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=24826 [[BR]]
  * file: 6.0.6001.18000.367-KRMSDK_EN.iso
  * "Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 Express Edition"[[BR]]
  * download link: http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=3092 [[BR]]
  * file: VS2008ExpressENUX1397868.iso
  * Python 2.7.2 (amd64) + distutils + all that is needed. C:\Python27\ is in %PATH%.
To make amd64 compilers work, the batch file "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft
Visual Studio 9.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat" needs to be fixed on lines 19 and 20 to:
    if not exist "%~dp0bin\vcvars64.bat" goto missing
    call "%~dp0bin\vcvars64.bat"
Then, to build numpy install package, open command prompt and cd to numpy-git
directory, and run:
    > "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat" amd64
    > python setup.py config
    > python setup.py build
    > python setup.py bdist_wininst
The package seems to work even if I didn't have a Fortran compiler. I had
MinGW installed but not in %PATH%.
Thanks.
