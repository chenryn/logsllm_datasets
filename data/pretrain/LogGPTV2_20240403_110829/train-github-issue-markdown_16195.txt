Challenge Build JavaScript Objects has an issue.  
User Agent is: `Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML,

Please describe how to reproduce this issue, and include links to screenshots
if possible.
After running the test and passing it, I click the "Submit and move on to the
next Challenge" button. However, I am not taken to the next challenge and the
pop up box "orb" continues to move.  
My code:
    // Example
    var ourDog = {
      "name": "Camper",
      "legs": 4,
      "tails": 1,
      "friends": ["everything!"]
    };
    // Only change code below this line.
    var myDog = {
      "name": "Tobi",
      "legs": 4,
      "tails": 1,
      "friends": ["Family!"]
    };
