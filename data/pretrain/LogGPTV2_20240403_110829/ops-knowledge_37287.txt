User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题IPv6 LAN stops routing / responding during bootup I recently set up an HE tunnel to add IPv6 support to my network. When the router boots "Starting Firewall" rolls by twice on the console.  After the first time, I'm able to ping the router's LAN IPv6 address from a computer on the network, as well as external IPv6 addresses (facebook). I'm also able to ping nodes on the LAN network without an issue.   After the second  time it rolls by I'm unable to reach the router via its IPv6 address from any node on the network and the router is unable to reach any ipv6 address on the LAN.  Traceroutes to any node on the LAN network give me !A from the router's address. From the router I'm able to get to any external IPv6 through the tunnel. 

I've verified IPv6 is enabled in Advanced Settings.
 I've tried adding any/any rules to the firewall. 
 I've tried completely disabling the firewall temporarily.
 I've tried blowing away the tunnel and just setting up an IPv6 lan with the same issue. 
 I've verified my routing tables are correct. 

At this point any help would be appreciated because I'm completely at a loss. 

When it stops working the system.log looks like this:

My routing tables look correct:
