User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Cisco ASA Implicit rule dropping traffic The network is as follows:

Two Default Gateways exist on the network - one which provides connectivity to the an MPLS with several subnets. Let's say 10.0.0.2

Another which is a Cisco Firewall, on 10.0.0.1, with a WAN Connection. A server exists on the LAN with it's DG as the above Cisco Firewall. On the firewall there is a route that tells says anything destined to one of the MPLS subnets (192.168.99.0/24) to go to the MPLS router (on it's LAN IP). 

On the INSIDE interface, there is any Any, Any, IP allow rule (all traffic). 

However, I cannot ping anything on the MPLS and the logs on the Cisco show the "Implicit" Any,Any Deny is dropping the ping traffic. It's the same for everything - HTTPs, HTTP etc.

What's missing?

Assistant: I think the security-level should be considered. You can ping from Inside to Outside, but the echo traffic must be allowed to go back to Inside.
