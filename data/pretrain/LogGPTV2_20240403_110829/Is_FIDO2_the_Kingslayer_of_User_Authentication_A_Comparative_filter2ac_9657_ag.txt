DETAILS ON COMPARISON OF TEXT-BASED PASSWORDS
WITH FIDO2 1FA USING A YUBICO SECURITY KEY

authenticator can be used for hundreds of accounts. It never offers

authentication options.

b) Deployability: FIDO2 is not Server-Compatible (
), and Non-Proprietary (
c) Security: FIDO2 is Resilient-to-Physical-Observation (
),
since the relying parties have to support it separately and cannot
piggyback on text-based password authentication. However, with
WebAuthn as a W3C standard implemented in all browsers, FIDO2 is
2).
Browser-Compatible (
),
since it shifts the authentication to a possession-based factor. As
a challenge-response protocol based on a public key cryptography,
it is Resilient-to-Targeted-Impersonation (
), Resilient-to-Throttled-
Guessing (
). Further,
since there is no shared secret between the user and the relying
party, which has to be entered or sent by the user, or stored by
the website, and there is mutual authentication between the authenti-
cator and the website, FIDO2 is also Resilient-to-Leaks-from-Other-
Veriﬁers (
). FIDO2 has No-Trusted-
Third-Party (
). Lastly, during the registration a new unique key
pair is created by the authenticator per account and use of the key
restricted to a single origin, which prevents a linking of authenticators
and hence linking/tracking of user accounts (based on the used key
pair), and makes FIDO2 Unlinkable (
), and Resilient-to-Unthrottled-Guessing (
) and Resilient-to-Phishing (
).3
2Most authenticators in the market are proprietary, although open-source
solutions exist and one can build their own authenticator.
3Naturally, accounts could be linked based on information independent of
FIDO2, e.g., username, email address, etc.

B. Beneﬁts dependent primarily on authenticator
a) Usability: FIDO2 with the Yubico Security Key as single-
factor is Memorywise-Effortless ( ) because the user only needs
to press the capacitive button to authenticate, but does not have
to remember a secret. This is a good ﬁrst example where this
beneﬁt purely depends on the authenticator. For instance, Windows
Hello uses the TPM as authenticator [15]. The TPM is an internal
authenticator and does not have any physical entry method, such as a
separate keyboard or button, thus the user has to "show presence"
and approve authentication by supplying a PIN (in absence of
biometric devices), which would make the TPM as a single factor at
most Quasi-Memorywise-Effortless according to Bonneau et al. [1].
The simple button push makes the Security Key also Physically-
Effortless ( ). The TPM as authenticator with PIN entry would be
at most Quasi-Physically-Effortless. Inserting the Security Key and
pressing a ﬂashing button when prompted by the browser is not more
complicated than using text-based passwords and makes the Security
Key Easy-to-learn ( ) and Efﬁcient-to-use ( ). It is easily conceivable
that not all authenticators are necessarily as intuitive as a button press.
Assuming proper implementation, FIDO2 should have Infrequent-
Errors ( ) [25], however, this error rate depends on the authenticator.
For instance, biometric user authentication to the authenticator might
induce more frequent errors [68].
b) Deployability: The Security Key is Accessible ( ), since
pushing the button does not form a higher hurdle than a password
entry. Again, this might change with a different authenticator device
(e.g., being able to handle a smartphone). FIDO2 does not impose
additional costs per user on the service, however, depending on the
authenticator device, the investment by each user varies. With a one-
time investment of $20–$27 for the Yubico Security Key, we consider
this solution as Quasi-Negligible-Cost-per-User ( ), since built-in
authenticators like TPM or Apple’s TouchID & FaceID would not
incur extra costs, while, for example, the Feitian BioPass FIDO2
Security Key costs with $50 around twice as much.
c) Security: Since the Security Key has its own physical
button, it is Resilient-to-Internal-Observation ( ). However, authenti-
cators like the TPM, which do not have a trusted path to the user, are
still susceptible to internal observation of the PIN/password to use the
TPM and have to rely on complex setups like extended authorization
policies to overcome this limitation. A security key, when used as
single factor, is not Resilient-to-Theft ( ), since possession of the
token alone sufﬁces to authenticate. Requiring pushing the button is
Requiring-Explicit-Consent ( ) to authenticate. Internal authentica-
tors without a trusted path might not be able to provide this beneﬁt.
