I'm running on OS X.
Steps to reproduce:
  1. Start Atom
  2. Open a directory
  3. Open a file so there's a tab open
  4. Restart Atom
  5. Reopen the same directory
I expect the workspace to be restored (i.e. the file should be opened) when I
reopen the directory in Atom. If I open the directory a second time after
startup, it does the proper thing (but then I have two workspaces open that
are backed by the same directory/project).
