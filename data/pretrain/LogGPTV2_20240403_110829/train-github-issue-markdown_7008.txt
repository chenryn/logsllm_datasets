#### Issue Description
I was writing my code for a problem and testing an output of one of my
variables when I got the error message that says "SyntaxError: Illegal return
statement".
I figured it it might be some additional code messing it up so I commented out
things progressively until I finally just decided to comment out everything in
the scope of the function and just return a plane number, and it is still
giving me this error.
I tried the hard refresh and clearing the local storage, and I still cannot
get the issue to clear.

    function sumPrimes(num) {  
      //var primes = [];
      //var x = 2;
      //do {
       // var wilsonTheorem = 0;
        //for (var i = 1; i  2){
          primes.push(x);
        }
        x++;
      } while (primes.length != num);*/
      return 5;
    }
    sumPrimes(3);
