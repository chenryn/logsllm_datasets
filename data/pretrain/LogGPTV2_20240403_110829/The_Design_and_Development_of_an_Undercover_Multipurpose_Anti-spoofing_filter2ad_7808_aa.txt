This paper describes the design and development of a 
software  system 
in 
investigating and prosecuting email based crimes.  It 
focuses  on  phishing  scams  which  use  emails to trick 
users  into  revealing  personal  data.  The  system 
described 
the  Undercover 
Multipurpose Anti-Spoofing Kit (UnMask), will enable 
investigators to reduce the time and effort needed for 
digital  forensic  investigations  of  email-based  crimes.  
A novel aspect of UnMask is its use of a database to 
not only store information related to the email and its 
constituent parts (such as IP addresses, links, domain 
names),  but  also 
to 
automatically launch UNIX tools to collect additional 
information

can then be automatically generated according to the 
needs  of

correlations across multiple email data stored in the 
database. UnMask is a working system. To the best of 
our  knowledge,  UnMask  is  the  first  comprehensive 
system  that  can  automatically  analyze  emails  and 
generate  forensic  reports  that  can  be  used  for 
subsequent investigation and prosecution.

This paper describes the design and development 
of  a  software  system  to  support  law  enforcement  in 
investigating and prosecuting email based crimes.  It 
focuses  on  phishing  scams  [1],  which  is  the  use  of 
email  to  drive  users  to  spoofed  websites  using 
technical exploits and social engineering to trick users 
into  revealing  personal  data  (e.g.,  passwords,  social 
security  numbers  and  credit  cards  numbers).  Once 
these  data  are  (illegally)  captured,  they  are  typically 
used 
to  commit  a  number  of  more  serious 
cybercrimes, such as fraud, identity theft and hacking 
(unauthorized  access  and  theft  of  services).    The 
system described in this paper, called the Undercover 
Multipurpose  Anti-Spoofing  Kit  (UnMASK),  will

forensic 
investigations  of  other  crimes  that  use  emails  as  a 
vector, such as threats and harassment. 
Investigating incidents of phishing and the related 
problem  of  identity  theft  tend  to  be  labor-intensive 
tasks that produce lots of dead-ends and few tangible 
results  [2,  3,  4].    Automated  methods  of  following 
leads would reduce the effort, training, and resources 
dedicated  to  the  investigation  of  such  email  crimes. 
UnMask  is  a  user-friendly  system  for  parsing  email

An  important  feature  of  the  UnMask  project  is 
that a database is a central aspect of not only keeping 
track of the initial phishing emails under investigation, 
but  also 
to  store  subsequent 
information  searched  after  deconstruction  (parsing 
with  a  view  to  determining  important  components 
related  to  the  investigation)  of  the  email.    Thus,  for 
example, we automatically launch UNIX tools such as 
whois,  dig  and 
to  determine  further 
information about IP addresses in the header and the 
body of the email and store this retrieved information

information related to an email is obtained, UnMask 
can  generate  reports  that  provide  details  about  the 
email’s  trajectory,  a  summary  of  the  content,  factual 
and 
linkages, 
discrepancies,  etc.      To  the  best  of  our  knowledge, 
UnMask  is  the  first  comprehensive  system  that  can 
automatically  analyze  emails  and  generate  forensic 
reports that can be used  for subsequent investigation 
and prosecution. 
       Since each email that is considered is stored in the 
database,  UnMask  can  effectively  be  used  to  answer 
queries related to multiple emails, such as discovering 
if  similar  source  addresses  were  used  during  a 
particular  period  of  time  across  the  set  of  stored 
emails.  The  functionality  of  correlating  multiple 
emails  is  particularly  helpful  and  crucial  for  law

process  a  batch  of  emails,  seized  via  warrant, 
subpoena,  or  court  order,  that  were  sent  to  and 
received  by  the  owner  of  a  specific  email  address

UnMask is a working system, complete except for 
hardening of the code.  Our next step is to deliver it to 
law enforcement for experimental use.  We have been 
working  with  both  the  National  White  Collar  Crime 
Center  and 
the  Florida  Department  of  Law 
Enforcement in building UnMask.  We envision that,

we  discuss  some  background

3,  we  present  the  high-level  architecture  of  the 
UnMask  system.    Section  4  presents  the  detailed 
implementation of two key aspects of UnMask: (1) the 
use  of  a  PostgreSQL  database  and  a  novel  use  of 
triggers  to  create  a  workflow  manager;  and  (2)  the 
automation of the use of UNIX tools to automatically 
retrieve  additional  desired

discuss  how  reports  are  automatically  generated  and 
give examples of such use in an investigation.  Section

Those preemptive and aggressive approaches can 
be useful in preventing phishing crimes but may not 
be  very  useful  in  computer  crime  investigations.  
Other  approaches  at  the  email  level  can  also  be 
effective for early prevention.  For example it may be 
easier to detect the anomaly of an email and prevent 
the  phishing  target  from  responding  compared  to 
verifying the legitimacy of a web site.  A great deal of 
work  related  to  prevention  has  been  done,  mainly 
related to spam messages.  Areas of research include

classification  [19,  20];  rules  finding  and  patterns 
matching  [21,  22];  and  statistical  and  probabilistic 
determination  [23].   The  UnMask  work, however,  is 
focused on digital forensic investigations and evidence 
gathering. Thus, much of the current research focusing 
on spam filtration is orthogonal to our research goals. 
Tools  or  websites,  such  as  Sam  Spade  [24]  or 
domaintools [25] share a similar goal to ours.  These 
tools are used interactively to various degrees by the 
law enforcement community. These tools/websites, as 
well as UnMask, provide network-query functionality 
that lets users probe domain names, IP addresses, etc. 
Sam  Spade,  for  example, lets  user  crawl  websites  to 
pull  out  a  list  of  email-addresses/links.  These  tools 
also  let  users  analyze  email  headers  to  determine 
whether  the  email  message  was  sent  from  a  valid 
address  or  forwarded  via  an  open relay  to  cover  the 
sender's  tracks.    However,  these  tools  expect  some
