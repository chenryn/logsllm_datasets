User: I installed Python3.5 in Linux machine using configure, make, make install and made it default over existing Python2.6 . Now I want to uninstall Python 3.5 as it is not supporting zlib. How do I uninstall default Python 3.5. Linux is RHEL6.7.
Assistant: you probably can remove the directory that contain the new installation. 
but the main thing is to remove it from the $PATH.
