User: Is there any way to find MAC address of a device (in chat system) using Python?
except uuid library
Assistant: In general, it's not possible to get a MAC address of another host (computer) on the internet without running your own program on that host, and asking.
It's possible to get the MAC addresses of the active hosts on the local network (up to the next router) from the ARP cache. It's possible to get your own MAC address(es). All this is OS-dependent.
