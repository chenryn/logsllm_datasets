In this experiment, we use FTP flows only and the number of FTP 
flows is fixed at 80 for the duration of the simulation. We compare 
the  performance  of  PI  and  PIP  when  the  buffer  size  shrinks  to 
100.The queue lengths are illustrated in Figure 7, which shows that 
PI is unable to regulate the queue length to the reference value when 
the  buffer  size  is  relatively  small,  while  PIP  performs  as  well  as 
before.

At last, we consider a more realistic, highly dynamic scenario. The 
traffic is a mixture of FTP, HTTP and CBR, which join or leave the 
simulation as described in Table 1. The queue sizes of PI and PIP 
are depicted in Figure 9a and Figure 9b. The results show that the 
queue length of PI increases along with the increase of load levels, 
especially with the bulk FTP transfers. On the contrary, the queue 
changes  in  PIP  are  small  except  that  an  instantaneous  ‘pulse’ 
emerges when the bulk FTP transfers are suddenly activated. With 
the departure of traffic, the performance of PI and PIP are similar.

Here, we test the algorithms at the extremes of very light and very

queue  length,  the  higher  the  link  utilization  and  the  longer  the

Additionally, we also compare the packet losses caused by  PI  and 
PIP. Figure 11 shows the packet drops in different times when the 
number  of  FTP  flows  is  100.  Once  the  queue  converges  to  the 
reference  value,  both  of  them  incur  no  significant  drops  for  TCP 
flows  when  ECN  marking  is  used.  The  reason  is  that  the  queue 
scarcely hits the buffer limit in steady state. However, in the transient 
period,  PI  drops  relatively  large  number  of  packets  as  a  result  of 
frequently occurred overflows. Under many conditions, we observe 
very similar results. But because of space limitations, the results are 
not shown here.

with mixture traffic. 
In the previous simulations, the queue lengths with PIP are very low. 
So  it  is  reasonable  to  doubt  link  under  utilization.  Suppose  the 
reference  queue  length  increases  to  50  packets  and  the  number  of 
FTP flows is 100, the queue length of PIP as illustrated in Figure

5.1 Responsiveness 
In this section, we will explain why PIP is more responsive than PI 
on the basis of second-order system analysis.  
Looking  back  at  equation  (1),  we  can  rewrite  it  as  the  standard 
formulation of a second-order system

The  analysis  shows  that  the  nature  frequency  of  the  system  is 
unchanged while the damping ratio is increased with the tachometer 
feedback.  As  a  result,  the  responsiveness  property  of  the  system 
deteriorates.  So  the  tachometer  feedback  is  inapplicable  to  the 
controlled system. 
5.2 Stability and utilization 
Suppose  a  set  of  sources  share  a  simple  bottleneck  link  with  a 
capacity  of  C,  for  example,  r1  in  Figure  3.  The  aggregate  packet 
arrival rate is assumed to be A(t) and the accepted rate is F(t). A(t) is 
equal to F(t) as long as there is no packet drops. Otherwise, A(t) is 
greater than F(t). To account for the differential of queue length, we 
have  
                                                (12)

we have 
t ≈)(F

The  aggregate  packet  accepted  rate  at  the  router  approximately 
matches the link bandwidth. This is an important performance goal 
required  by  the  AQM  mechanism.  Match  rate  is  also  an  ideal 
operating state to queues in routers. If F(t) is smaller than C, the link 
will be under utilization. On the contrary, if F(t) is greater than  C 
and  persists  for  a  long  period,  the  queue  length  will  increase  and 
congestion is likely to occur. So, small queue oscillations not only 
indicate low delay jitter but also a guarantee of high link utilization.

All of the simulations in the previous section demonstrate that PIP 
can restrain queue oscillations, which means PIP can achieve high 
link utilization. 
6.  CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper we present a new AQM algorithm called PIP, which 
can be implemented easily. The performance of PIP is evaluated by 
simulations  and  compared  with  PI.  The  results  show  that  PIP  is 
superior  to  PI  under  almost  all  traffic  conditions.  The  improved 
responsiveness and robustness gained  by  PIP  is  mainly  due  to  the 
introduction  of  feedback  compensation  element.  By  appropriately 
choosing  the  feedback  parameter,  the  error  incurred  by  the 
inaccuracy in the linear system model is eliminated. Moreover, the 
sensitivity  to  system  parameter  variations  is  also  alleviated.  The 
parameters  of  PIP  are  determined  by  such  performance  metrics  as 
stability, stable margin and steady state error, etc. PIP can keep the 
queue length near the reference value with small oscillations under 
widely various traffic conditions. Our approach to AQM is  simple 
and straightforward. More sophisticated controllers can de designed 
using other advanced control theory.
