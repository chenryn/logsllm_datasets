Travis use `pip 6.0.7`  
Today we had the following error:
    pip install -U requests==2.14.0
    Using cached requests-2.14.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl
      Exception:

We can fix it using:  
`pip install -U pip`  
`# Successfully installed pip-9.0.1`
But maybe too much travis build use default pip version  
Could be dual compatibility this requests package?
We had a similar fix for pylint: pylint-dev/astroid#360 based on
pypa/packaging#72
