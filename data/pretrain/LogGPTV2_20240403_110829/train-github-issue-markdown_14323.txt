### Issue Description

In our Travis CI environment, we are using `pip 6.0.7`. Today, we encountered the following error while trying to install the `requests` package:

```sh
pip install -U requests==2.14.0
Using cached requests-2.14.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl
Exception:

```

### Proposed Solution

We can resolve this issue by upgrading `pip` to a more recent version. The following commands will update `pip` and then install the `requests` package successfully:

```sh
pip install -U pip
# Successfully installed pip-9.0.1
pip install -U requests==2.14.0
```

### Considerations

However, many of our Travis builds use the default `pip` version, which is `6.0.7`. To ensure compatibility with both older and newer versions of `pip`, we should consider making the `requests` package dual-compatible.

### Related Fixes

A similar fix was implemented for `pylint` in [pylint-dev/astroid#360](https://github.com/pylint-dev/astroid/issues/360), based on [pypa/packaging#72](https://github.com/pypa/packaging/issues/72).

### Next Steps

1. **Update `pip`**: Upgrade `pip` to a more recent version in the Travis CI environment.
2. **Ensure Compatibility**: Modify the `requests` package to be compatible with both `pip 6.0.7` and newer versions.
3. **Test**: Verify that the changes work as expected in both environments.

By following these steps, we can ensure that our build process remains robust and compatible with different versions of `pip`.
