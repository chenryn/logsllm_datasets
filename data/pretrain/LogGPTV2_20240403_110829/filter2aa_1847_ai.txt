### Configuring Logging for the VPN Service

You can choose the level of detail you want to log for the VPN service. The options are:

- **Non-verbose**: This setting logs only critical conditions that require immediate action, such as if the VPN service fails to start.
- **Verbose**: This setting records all activities of the VPN service, including routine functions.

By default, non-verbose logging is enabled.

#### To Set the Level of Detail for VPN Logs:

1. Open **Server Admin** and select **VPN Service** from the **Computers & Services** list.
2. Click on **Settings**.
3. Navigate to the **Logging** tab.
4. Select **Verbose** to enable detailed logging, if desired.
5. Click **Save** to apply the changes.

### Setting the VPN Log Archive Interval

Mac OS X Server can automatically archive VPN service logs after a specified period. Each archived log is compressed, reducing disk space usage compared to the original log file. You can customize the schedule to archive logs at regular intervals, measured in days.

#### To Set Up the Log Archive Interval:

1. In **Server Admin**, choose **VPN Service** from the **Computers & Services** list.
2. Click **Settings**.
3. Go to the **Logging** tab.
4. Select **Archive Log every ___ days**.
5. Enter the desired log archive interval.
6. Click **Save** to apply the settings.

### Viewing the VPN Log

Monitoring the VPN logs is essential for ensuring the smooth operation of your Virtual Private Network (VPN). These logs can help you troubleshoot issues.

#### To View the Log:

1. In **Server Admin**, select **VPN Service** from the **Computers & Services** list.
2. Click on **Logs** to view the log entries.

### Monitoring VPN Client Connections

You can monitor client connections to ensure secure access to the Virtual Private Network. The client connection screen provides details such as the user connected, the IP address from which they are connecting, the IP address assigned by your network, and the type and duration of the connection.

#### To View Client Connections:

1. In **Server Admin**, choose **VPN Service** from the **Computers & Services** list.
2. Click on **Connections** to see the list of active client connections.

### NTP Service

**Network Time Protocol (NTP)** is a network protocol used to synchronize the clocks of computers on your network to a reference time clock. NTP ensures that all computers on a network report the same time, which is crucial for services that rely on accurate time and date stamps, such as email and web services.

#### How NTP Works

NTP uses **Universal Time Coordinated (UTC)** as its reference time. UTC is based on atomic resonance, and clocks that run according to UTC are often called "atomic clocks."

- **Stratum 1 servers** are authoritative NTP servers that keep track of the current UTC time.
- **Stratum 2 and 3 servers** query Stratum 1 servers regularly, estimate the time taken across the network, and adjust their own time accordingly. These estimates are accurate to the nanosecond.
- Your local network can then query Stratum 3 servers for the time, and the process repeats. An NTP client on your network takes the UTC time reference, converts it to local time based on its time zone setting, and sets its internal clock accordingly.

#### Using NTP on Your Network

Mac OS X Server can act as both an NTP client and an authoritative time server for your network. It is recommended that if you set your server to answer time queries, you also configure it to query an authoritative server on the Internet.

#### Setting Up NTP Service

To set up NTP service:

1. Ensure your server is configured to "Set Date & Time automatically." This setting is found in the **Date & Time** pane of **System Preferences** or the **Server Admin Settings** pane for the server.
2. Open **Server Admin** and select the server you want to act as a time server.
3. Click **Settings**.
4. Go to the **Advanced** tab.
5. Select **Enable NTP**.
6. Click **Save** to apply the changes.

#### Configuring NTP on Clients

If you have set up a local time server, you can configure your clients to query this server for the network date and time.

To configure NTP on clients:

1. Open **System Preferences**.
2. Click **Date & Time**.
3. Select the **Network Time** tab.
4. Select **Set Date & Time automatically**.
5. Clear the text field and enter the host name of your time server. The host name can be either a domain name (e.g., `time.example.com`) or an IP address.
6. Quit **System Preferences** to apply the changes.

### Where to Find More Information

- The NTP working group, documentation, and FAQ can be found at [www.ntp.org](http://www.ntp.org).
- The official specification of NTP version 3 is [RFC 1305](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1305).

### IPv6 Support

**IPv6 (Internet Protocol Version 6)** is the next-generation protocol designed to replace the current Internet Protocol, **IPv4**. IPv6 addresses some of the limitations of IPv4, such as limited IP addressing, increased routing and configuration burdens, and the need for Network Address Translation (NAT).

#### IPv6 Enabled Services

The following services in Mac OS X Server support IPv6 in addressing:

- **DNS (BIND)**
- **IP Firewall**
- **Mail (POP/IMAP/SMTP)**
- **SMB**
- **Web (Apache 2)**

Additionally, there are several command-line tools installed with Mac OS X Server that support IPv6, such as `ping6` and `traceroute6`.

#### IPv6 Addresses in the Server Admin

The services listed above do not support IPv6 addresses in the user interface. They can be configured with command-line tools to add IPv6 addresses, but these addresses will fail if entered into address fields in **Server Admin**.

#### IPv6 Addresses

IPv6 addresses are different from IPv4 addresses in terms of notation, reserved addresses, the addressing model, and address types.

##### Notation

- IPv4 addresses are 4 bytes long and expressed in decimal format.
- IPv6 addresses are 16 bytes long and can be expressed in various ways, such as:
  - `xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx`
  - `E3C5:0000:0000:0000:0000:4AC8:C0A8:6420`
  - `E3C5:0:0:0:0:4AC8:C0A8:6420`
  - `E3C5::4AC8:C0A8:6420`
  - `E3C5:4AC8:192.168.100.32`

##### Reserved Addresses

- `0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0` (unspecified address, internal to the protocol)
- `0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1` (loopback address, similar to `127.0.0.1` in IPv4)

##### Addressing Model

- IPv6 addresses are assigned to interfaces (e.g., Ethernet card) rather than nodes (e.g., computer).
- A single interface can be assigned multiple IPv6 addresses.
- A single IPv6 address can be assigned to several interfaces for load sharing.
- Routers do not need an IPv6 address, eliminating the need to configure them for point-to-point unicast.

##### Address Types

- **Unicast** (one-to-one communication)
- **Multicast** (one-to-many communication)
- **Anycast**

Note that IPv6 does not support broadcast. Multicast is preferred for network broadcasts. Otherwise, unicast and multicast in IPv6 are similar to those in IPv4. Multicast addresses in IPv6 start with `FF` (255).

#### Where to Find More Information

- The working group for the Internet Protocol Version 6 is at [www.ipv6.org](http://www.ipv6.org).
- A list of applications that support IPv6 can be found at [www.ipv6forum.com/navbar/links/v6apps.htm](http://www.ipv6forum.com/navbar/links/v6apps.htm).
- There are over 29 IPv6-related RFC documents. A list can be found at [www.ipv6.org/specs.html](http://www.ipv6.org/specs.html).
