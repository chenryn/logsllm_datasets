### Wide Area Defence Plans and Testbed Applications

This document outlines the development and evaluation of wide area defense plans, focusing on emerging themes such as information and communication security in power substation control, support for emergency management through distribution grid control, interactions between process control and corporate activities, and remote maintenance of ICT automation devices. The testbed applications were subjected to a sequence of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks to demonstrate the increasing severity of their effects on implemented control functions: first, the denial of supervision and control activities, then the preclusion of manual intervention by the grid operator, and finally, the denial of automatic actions under full emergency conditions.

#### 1. Testbed Architecture

In the testbed, the information flow among substations and control centers is based on a simulator of the IEC 60870-5-104 standard protocol [8]. This standard uses the TCP/IP transport profile to exchange data packets and communication control information, with data packets containing process information in the monitoring direction and commands in the control direction.

#### 2. Experimental Evaluation Framework

The objective of the controlled experiments is to provide statistical data on the effects of attacks on telecontrol applications. To achieve this, logging extensions were included in the testbed application to record communication data in text files. The following metrics were defined:

- **Inter Message Time (IMT)**: Measures the time distance between two consecutive receptions of teleoperation messages.
- **Inter Reconnection Time (IRT)**: Measures the time to recovery of the application protocol from the time distance between two consecutive successful TCP connections.
- **Time To Failure (TTF)**: Measures the resilience to an attack before communications are blocked.
- **Number of Lost Messages (NLM)**: Counts the number of expected messages not received.
- **Number of Reconnections (NR)**: Counts the number of TCP connections successfully performed by the telecontrol application protocol.

Experimental data collected through repeated experiments were off-line elaborated, and the above measures were graphically plotted.

|------|---------------|------|--------|-------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------------|
| DoS  | Packet replying, Packet flooding | UDP flooding, Syn flooding, TCP replay, Ping | IP forward, firewall, VPN, Redundancy | Hub Ethernet network 10Mbps, Switched Ethernet 10/100 Mbps | TCP/IP, IEC 60870-5-104 |

#### 3. Microgrid Testbed

As the number of distributed generation units connected to the distribution grid increases, it becomes essential to include these generators in the control of the utility grid voltage and frequency. The use of power electronic converters allows flexible control of active and reactive power supplied to or drawn from the grid, as well as the provision of ancillary services. Future developments divide the grid into smaller microgrids [9], each comprising loads and local energy sources that can operate connected to the utility grid or autonomously (island mode).

In a microgrid structure, a part of the distributed generation units needs to support the grid voltage and frequency. This can be achieved using a power electronic converter with droop control [9, 10], which adapts the local voltage magnitude and frequency based on the values of active and reactive power [11]. Such primary control algorithms run on intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) associated with inverters and require no communication.

When multiple distributed sources are producing energy, their inverters are connected in parallel to the electrical grid. Each inverter runs a primary control algorithm on its associated IED. These IEDs can be connected via a communication network, allowing non-local control algorithms to be executed (Figure 4), such as exchanging local frequency and voltage values. A secondary control loop maintains voltage magnitude and frequency within normal limits by communicating among different generators and globally adapting the amount of power supplied by each inverter.

#### 3.1 IED/Inverter Testbed Setup

**Figure 5: Experimental Setup of Single IED/Inverter**

The Triphase inverter platform [12, 13] is the central part of the setup. An FPGA generates pulse width modulation-based control signals for the power transistors and passes measurement data to a Linux-based server PC extended with Xenomai for real-time functionality. The server PC is connected to a user PC, where the droop control scheme is implemented in Matlab Simulink, allowing the user to obtain measurement data and change control parameters online. Together, these PCs and the FPGA form the IED of the inverter. Measurement boards provide additional measurements, and a solid-state relay enables operation in both grid-connected and island modes.

#### 3.2 Impact of ICT Faults on Primary and Secondary Control

Multiple (2 to 4) IED/converter combinations were electrically connected and communicated via the Matlab interface on the user PC. This TCP/IP-based communication took place over a static topology, with IEDs connected to a single hub forming a separate Ethernet segment. By replacing the point-to-point communication infrastructure, other reference cases were possible, such as evaluating the effect of transmission delay and varying latencies on control algorithms that require communication. Overlay networks provided additional resilience against random faults and DoS attacks [14].

We evaluated the impact of different ICT faults on microgrid control algorithms, including the impact of network latency, packet loss, and network unavailability. Case 1 investigated the effect of introducing additional network latency, packet loss, and temporary link unavailability on the communication and hence on the secondary and tertiary control algorithms. Case 2 investigated malicious faults by emulating incorrect values that drive the secondary control algorithm to set points outside their normal range. Solutions require value integrity detection and authentication.

Overall, three levels of robustness were evaluated for microgrid control algorithms:
1. Control aspects that make algorithms more robust against disturbances (both islanded and grid-connected).
2. Adding an overlay layer to the communication for flexibility and robustness.
3. The impact of architectural solutions to increase robustness.

### Conclusions

The Teleoperation Testbed was used to evaluate attack processes on hierarchically distributed control schemes. Experiments covered the assessment of VPN tunneling techniques in conjunction with IEC 60870-5-104-based communication flows, affected by DoS attacks on firewall and VPN gateways. The combined deployment of these protocols revealed unexpected vulnerabilities, as the time-out parameters of the IEC 60870-5-104 protocol influenced the communication performance of the VPN protocols.

Results showed that flooding-based DoS attacks had severe effects on telecontrol communications, causing message loss and communication blocks due to increased bandwidth consumption. More sophisticated architectural patterns, such as filtering mechanisms [15], need to be evaluated to improve resilience. The experimental results support the development of appropriate standards for the security of application protocols, particularly Part 7 of the IEC 62351 standard, concerning security through network and system management.

The Microgrid Testbed ran primary and secondary microgrid control algorithms on inverters equipped with IEDs. The impact of fail-silent ICT faults was comparable to changing the periodicity of message exchange, leading to slower adaptation of the inverters to generator/consumption changes. Arbitrary failures could lead to over- or undervoltages, triggering electrical protection and requiring fault prevention or tolerance solutions.
