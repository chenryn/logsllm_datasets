User: I'm trying to release my first Python package in the wild and I was successful in setting it up on PyPi and able to do a pip install.  When I try to run the package via the command line ($ python etlTest), I receive the following error:
/usr/bin/python: can't find '__main__' module in 'etlTest'
When I run the code directly from my IDE, it works without issue.  I am using Python 2.7 and have __init__.py scripts where required.  What do I need to do to get this working?
Assistant: Just change the name __init__.py file to __main__.py
