Certain svg attributes are camelcased, such as `viewBox`. However, `[viewBox]`
would be recognized by browsers as `[viewbox]` since it is not a standard SVG
attribute, and so the important camelcasing information is lost.
There should be a convention in Angular 2 for supporting bindings to SVG
attributes.
