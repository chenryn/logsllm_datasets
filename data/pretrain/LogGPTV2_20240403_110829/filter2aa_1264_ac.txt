## Configuring Authentication Methods for POP

### Enabling a Single Authentication Method
If you want to require either APOP or Kerberos, enable only one of these methods.

#### To set the POP authentication method:
1. In Server Admin, select **Mail** in the **Computers & Services** pane.
2. Click **Settings**.
3. Select the **Advanced** tab.
4. Check **APOP** or **Kerberos** (as desired) in the **POP3** list.
5. Click **Save**.

### Enabling Less Secure Authentication for POP
You can choose to allow basic password (clear text) authentication. This is considered less secure than APOP or Kerberos because the password is transmitted as unencrypted, clear text.

#### To enable clear text POP authentication:
1. In Server Admin, select **Mail** in the **Computers & Services** pane.
2. Click **Settings**.
3. Select the **Advanced** tab.
4. Check **Clear**.
5. Click **Save**.

## Configuring SSL Transport for POP Connections
SSL transport enables mail transmitted over the network to be securely encrypted. You can choose to **Require**, **Use**, or **Don’t Use** SSL for POP (and IMAP) connections. Before using SSL connections, you must have a security certificate for mail use. See the Open Directory administration guide for more information on enabling SSL.

### Setting SSL transport for POP also sets it for IMAP.
#### To set SSL transport for POP connections:
1. In Server Admin, select **Mail** in the **Computers & Services** pane.
2. Click **Settings**.
3. Select the **Advanced** tab.
4. Select **Require**, **Use**, or **Don’t Use** (as desired) in the **IMAP and POP SSL** section.
5. Click **Save**.

## Enabling Secure IMAP Authentication
Your IMAP mail service can protect users’ passwords by requiring that connections use a secure method of authentication. You can choose **CRAM MD-5** or **Kerberos v5** authentication. When a user connects with secure authentication, the user’s mail client software encrypts the user’s password before sending it to your IMAP service. Ensure that your users’ email applications and user accounts support the chosen method of authentication.

#### If you configure your mail service to require CRAM MD-5, mail users’ accounts must be set to use a Password Server that has CRAM MD-5 enabled. For information, see the Open Directory administration guide.
Before enabling Kerberos authentication for incoming mail service, you must integrate Mac OS X with a Kerberos server. If you are using Mac OS X Server for Kerberos authentication, this is already done for you. For instructions, see the Open Directory administration guide.

#### To set secure IMAP authentication:
1. In Server Admin, select **Mail** in the **Computers & Services** pane.
2. Click **Settings**.
3. Select the **Advanced** tab.
4. Select **CRAM MD-5** or **Kerberos** (as desired) in the **IMAP** section.
5. Click **Save**.

## Enabling Less Secure IMAP Authentication
Your IMAP mail service can supply users’ passwords by less secure means. These authentication methods are less secure because they don’t securely encrypt your users’ passwords as they cross the network.

#### To allow login, plain, or clear IMAP authentication:
1. In Server Admin, select **Mail** in the **Computers & Services** pane.
2. Click **Settings**.
3. Select the **Advanced** tab.
4. Check **LOGIN**, **PLAIN**, or **Clear** in the **IMAP** list.
5. Click **Save**.

## Controlling the Number of IMAP Connections
You can adjust the load put on your server by limiting the number of concurrent IMAP connections.

#### To limit IMAP connections:
1. In Server Admin, select **Mail** in the **Computers & Services** pane.
2. Click **Settings**.
3. Select the **General** tab.
4. Click **Enable IMAP**, if it isn’t already checked.
5. Enter the number of concurrent connections you want to allow, then click **Save**.
   - The default setting is 32, and the maximum is 300.

## Configuring SSL Transport for IMAP Connections
SSL transport enables mail transmitted over the network to be securely encrypted. You can choose to **Require**, **Use**, or **Don’t Use** SSL for IMAP connections. Before using SSL connections, you must have a security certificate for mail use. See the Open Directory administration guide for more information on enabling SSL.

### Requiring SSL transport for IMAP also requires it for POP.
#### To configure SSL transport for IMAP connections:
1. In Server Admin, select **Mail** in the **Computers & Services** pane.
2. Click **Settings**.
3. Select the **Advanced** tab.
4. Click **Require**, **Use**, or **Don’t Use** (as desired) in the **IMAP and POP SSL** section.
5. Click **Save**.

## Configuring Outgoing Mail Service
The mail service includes an SMTP service for sending mail. Subject to restrictions that you control, the SMTP service also transfers mail to and from mail services on other servers. If your mail users send messages to another Internet domain, your SMTP service delivers the outgoing messages to the other domain’s mail service. Other mail services deliver messages for your mail users to your SMTP service, which then transfers the messages to your POP service and IMAP service.

### Enabling Secure SMTP Authentication
Your server can guard against being an open relay by allowing SMTP authentication. (An open relay indiscriminately relays mail to other mail servers.) You can configure the mail service to require secure authentication using either the **CRAM MD-5** or **Kerberos** method. You can also allow the less secure **plain** and **login** authentication methods, which don’t encrypt passwords, if some users have email client software that doesn’t support the secure methods.

#### To allow secure SMTP authentication:
1. In Server Admin, select **Mail** in the **Computers & Services** pane.
2. Click **Settings**.
3. Select the **Advanced** tab.
4. Check **CRAM MD-5** or **Kerberos** (as desired) in the **SMTP** section.
5. Click **Save**.

### Enabling Less Secure SMTP Authentication
Your server can guard against being an open relay by requiring SMTP authentication. (An open relay indiscriminately relays mail to other mail servers.) Requiring authentication ensures that only known users—people with user accounts on your server—can send mail from your mail service. You can choose to require, allow, or disallow less secure authentication methods (plain text, or login) for SMTP mail service.

#### To allow less secure authentication:
1. In Server Admin, select **Mail** in the **Computers & Services** pane.
2. Click **Settings**.
3. Select the **Advanced** tab.
4. Check either **Plain** or **Login** in the **SMTP** section.
5. Click **Save**.

## Configuring SSL Transport for SMTP Connections
SSL transport enables mail transmitted over the network to be securely encrypted. You can choose to **Require**, **Use**, or **Don’t Use** SSL for IMAP connections. Before using SSL connections, you must have a security certificate for mail use. See the Open Directory administration guide for more information on enabling SSL.

#### To configure SSL transport for SMTP connections:
1. In Server Admin, select **Mail** in the **Computers & Services** pane.
2. Click **Settings**.
3. Select the **Advanced** tab.
4. Click **Require**, **Use**, or **Don’t Use** (as desired) in the **SMTP SSL** section.
5. Click **Save**.

## Relaying SMTP Mail Through Another Server
Rather than delivering outgoing mail directly to its various destinations, your SMTP mail service can relay outgoing mail to another server.

### Normally, when an SMTP server receives a message addressed to a remote recipient, it will attempt to send that message directly to that server or the server specified in the MX record, if it exists. Depending on your network setup, this method of mail transport may not be desired or even possible. You may then need to relay all outbound messages through a specific server.
- **Firewall Setup**: You may need to use this method to deliver outgoing mail through your organization’s firewall. In this case, your organization will designate a particular server for relaying mail through the firewall.
- **Slow or Intermittent Connections**: You may find this method useful if your server has slow or intermittent connections to the Internet.

#### To relay SMTP mail through another server:
1. In Server Admin, select **Mail** in the **Computers & Services** pane.
2. Click **Settings**.
3. Select the **Advanced** tab.
4. Click the **General** tab.
5. Click **Relay all SMTP mail through this host** and enter the DNS name or IP address of the server that provides SMTP relay.
6. Click **Save**.

## Supporting Mail Users
This section discusses mail settings in your server’s user accounts and mail service settings in email client software.

### Configuring Mail Settings for User Accounts
To make mail service available to users, you must configure mail settings in your user accounts. For each user, you need to enable mail service, enter the DNS name or IP address of your mail server, and select the protocols for retrieving incoming mail (POP, IMAP, or both). You can also set a quota on disk space available for storing a user’s mail.

#### You configure these settings with the Workgroup Manager application. For instructions, see the user management guide.

### Configuring Email Client Software
Users must configure their email client software to connect to your mail service. The following table details the information most email clients need and the source of the information in Mac OS X Server.

| **Email client software** | **Mac OS X Server** | **Example** |
|---------------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **User name**             | Full name of the user | Steve Macintosh |
| **Account name**          | Account ID | Short name of user account (e.g., steve) |
| **Password**              | Password of user account | [Password] |
| **Host name**             | Mail server | Mail host (e.g., mail.example.com, 192.168.50.1) |
| **Email address**         | User’s short name, followed by the @ symbol, followed by: <br> - Server’s Internet domain (if the mail server has an MX record in DNS) <br> - Mail server’s full DNS name <br> - Server’s IP address | steve@example.com, steve@mail.example.com, steve@192.168.50.1 |
| **SMTP host**             | SMTP server | Same as host name (e.g., mail.example.com, 192.168.50.1) |
| **POP host**              | POP server | Same as host name (e.g., mail.example.com, 192.168.50.1) |
| **IMAP host**             | IMAP server | Same as host name (e.g., mail.example.com, 192.168.50.1) |
| **SMTP user**             | Short name of user account | steve |
| **SMTP password**         | Password of user account | [Password] |

## Creating an Administration Account
You may need to create a mail administrator account to maintain and watch mail folders, remove defunct user accounts, and archive mail. This administrator account doesn’t need to be a server administrator. Also, this administrator account shouldn’t receive mail. It is not a normal mail account.

#### To create a mail administrator account:
1. Create a user to be the mail administrator.
2. If you have not created a user record for the mail administrator’s account, see the user management guide.
3. Open `/etc/imapd.conf` in a text editor.
   - If you are not comfortable using a terminal text editor like `emacs` or `vi`, you can use TextEdit.
4. Find the line that reads `admins:`.
5. Edit the line to add the account name of the administrator account after the colon.
6. Save your changes.
   - For more information, see the man page for `imapd.conf`.

## Creating Additional Email Addresses for a User
Mail service allows each individual user to have more than one email address. Every user has one email address that is formed from the short name of the user account. In addition, you can define more names for any user account by creating an alias file. Each additional name is an alternate email address for the user at the same domain. These additional email addresses are not additional accounts that require separate quotas or passwords. Most often, alias files are used to map “postmaster” users to a real account and give a “PI:EMAIL” email address to a user with a short login account name.

#### To create an alias:
1. Create a file to be used as an alias list in `/etc/aliases`, if none exists.
2. For each alias, make a line in the file with the following format:
   ```
   alias:localaddress1,localaddress2,...
   ```
   - For example, for your domain `example.com`, if you want to give username “bob” an alias of “robert.fakeuser”, you should enter:
     ```
     robert.fakeuser: bob
     ```
     - This will take mail sent to your mail server for `robert.fakeuser` and actually send it to the real mail account `bob@example.com`.
3. Save your file changes.
4. In Terminal.app, enter the following command:
   ```
   postalias /etc/aliases
   ```
   - The text file is processed into a database for faster access.
5. At the prompt, enter the following command:
   ```
   newaliases
   ```
   - The alias database will reload.
6. At the prompt, reload the mail server by entering the following command:
   ```
   postfix reload
   ```
   - For further information about creating and maintaining email aliases, look at `/etc/postfix/alias`.

## Setting Up Forwarding Email Addresses for a User
You may use this to provide an email redirection service for your users. Any mail sent to the user’s email account will be forwarded to the indicated account.

#### To forward a user's mail:
1. In Workgroup Manager, open the user account you want to work with, if it is not already open.
   - To open the account, click the **Accounts** button, then click the globe icon below the toolbar menu and open the directory domain where the account resides. Click the lock to be authenticated. Select the user in the user list.
2. Click the **Mail** tab.
3. Select **Forward**.
4. Enter the forwarding email address in the **Forward To** field.
   - Multiple addresses can be entered but must be separated by a comma.

## Adding or Removing Virtual Domains
Virtual domains are other domains that can be used in email addresses for your mail users. It is also a list of all the domain names for which it is responsible. You should add any names that are likely to appear after `@` in the addresses of mail directed to your server. For example, the list might contain variations of the spelling of your domain name or company name. If you host mail for `example.com` and `example.org`, a virtual domain would allow `user@example.com` to receive mail addressed to `user@example.org` using the same mailbox.

### Your mail settings apply to all domain names in this list.
In order to use a virtual domain, you must have the domain registered and you should have an MX record pointing to your mail server for the domains you wish to enable.

#### To add or remove virtual domain names for the mail server:
1. In Server Admin, select **Mail** in the **Computers & Services** pane.
2. Click **Settings**.
3. Select the **Advanced** tab.
4. Click **Add** and type the domain name of a virtual mail host for which you want your server to be responsible.
5. To remove an item from the list, select it and click **Remove**.

- **Note**: If you’ve set up MX records, you don’t need to add anything to this list. Your mail service will add names as it discovers them in the course of its daily operation.
- If a domain name in this list doesn’t have an MX record, only your mail service recognizes it. External mail sent to this domain name will be returned. Place domain names in this list carefully to avoid issues with mail delivery.
