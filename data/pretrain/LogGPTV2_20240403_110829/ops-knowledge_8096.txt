User: I have an application where a small embedded ARM9 device (running Linux) must gather information from sensors and then connect to a remote mySQL database and INSERT the data. I have Python 2.5 running on the ARM9 device fine. I have developed a prototype application in Python 2.5 running on x86 Windows and it connects with mySQL and INSERTS just fine. My confusion in this issue come from working with "mySQL Connect/C" which would have to be cross compiled for the ARM processor before being used. 

What is the best way to port or move this DB app onto the ARM device?
Are there underlying x86 binaries in supporting libraries that must be cross compiled?
Or, is MySQLdb simply portable across platforms?
Assistant: I suggest using SQLite. I have an application running Python+SQLite for telemetry purposes and it works like a charm. It's much easier than MySQL.
