# Environment
    Windows build number: Win32NT 10.0.18362.0
    Windows Terminal version (if applicable): 0.5.2762.0
# Steps to reproduce
    printf '\e[?25l'
# Expected behavior
The cursor should become invisible.
# Actual behavior
The cursor remains visible and blinking. It is often misplaced on subsequent
operations, though.
E.g. press the Up arrow, it brings back the previous printf command to the
command line. Press the Left arrow, the cursor doesn't move. Press Backspace,
the letter `l` is removed (that is, the logical cursor did indeed move to the
left in the previous step), the cursor now blinks at the right edge.
