We return to thinking when there’s no hard data. We can make
inferences when information lacks definite answers. For example,
imagine you could find no personal information on me: I had no
social media, not even a LinkedIn profile. All you could find was
that I worked for Social- Engineer LLC, but using profession to
attack me was against the rules. You could piece together some
other information based on my profile. For instance, it looks as
though I lived in Australia. A quick search of “Maxie Reynolds
Australia” (without quotes) yields the following results as shown
in Figure 7.7:

144 THE LAWS AND SKILLS
By clicking in the first link shown in Figure 7.7, you would find
that I lived in Perth, Australia, as shown in Figure 7.8. That’s note-
worthy. You could also infer this by combing through my LinkedIn
connections.
I studied at Cranfield University. You could go down that
rabbit hole looking to see if they have alumni or speaker events.
Reverse- searching the image from the site on Yandex, Tin Eye, or
even Google reverse image search will also yield some interest-
ing results.

Honing back in on the original book result, you could find I was
promoting it at somepoint and, as a result, was on multiple podcasts
and was part of multiple interviews.
You will often have to break information down into bite- sized
chunks and probe deeper.
As the fourth law of AMs teaches you, the objective is the central
point from which all other moves an attacker makes hinge. In cases
when you have time for recon, it’s not unusual to spend weeks or
months gathering information before even beginning to attempt an
exploit, as is true for network pen testing, web app testing, red team-
ing, and social engineering. But even the third law of AMs applies
here, the pre- game: never break pretext. Pretext at this point in time
refers to how you should be thinking, and you should always be
thinking like an attacker. Break the information into usable chunks
Information Processing in Practice 145
to gain more information. Always keep in mind that the attacker
mindset is nothing more than taking information in and applying it
to an objective. Information is everywhere. Gathering it and apply-
ing it through the lens of your objective is the intersection of having
an attacker’s mindset and using it.
Recon: Passive
In network pen testing, passive recon does not rely on direct inter-
actions with a target system and is therefore far easier to hide. This
technique involves eavesdropping on a network in order to gain
intelligence, with pentesters analyzing the target company for part-
ner and employee details, technology in use, and so forth. This tech-
nique isn’t too dissimilar to how passive recon is executed in social
engineering and red teaming.
Passive reconnaissance is when you gather information about
the target without actually “touching” the target. In social engi-
neering, passive reconnaissance would include searches like the
one I just described and move all the way to the other end of
the spectrum, whereby you would comb accounts and movements,
piecing together the life— or at least one aspect— of the target’s life.
There are no direct interactions with the target when you are pas-
sively gathering information. This includes using accounts that do
not belong to you and attempting to stay anonymous online. There
are many reasons people want to remain anonymous online. Some
people want their personal details to remain unknown; some peo-
ple want to voice opinions that would perhaps negatively affect
them if they were to voice that opinion freely as themselves. What-
ever the reason, anonymity online is important to many people for
many reasons.
Working with the Innocent Lives Foundation, an organization
that attempts to bring pedophiles to justice, and the National Child
Protection Task force, which focuses on time- sensitive cases around
human trafficking, child exploitation, and missing persons cases, we
often use passive information- gathering techniques. Here, staying
anonymous is of the utmost importance. Virtual private networks
146 THE LAWS AND SKILLS
(VPNs) and virtual private desktops are employed; using my own
accounts would be catastrophic. I apply the same principles to my
day job at times. Passive recon means not touching the target, but
it also should mean not leaving a trace. I like to take the oppor-
tunity to act like a malicious attacker whenever I can, and a good
attacker rarely wants to leave a trail of evidence pointing toward
themselves. This means employing a sock puppet, or sock, account.
It’s a pseudonym or persona used for some sort of deception. Some
sock accounts are developed and hard to spot. Others are pretty
transparent, as if not trying at all to be inconspicuous. But a sock
account doesn’t have to leave someone believing it’s real; it just has
to stop them from finding out who is behind it. There is much you
must consider when trying to navigate the Internet anonymously.
Creating these covert accounts is indeed becoming harder on
many popular platforms, such as Facebook and Instagram. How-
ever, there are some loopholes left, but possibly not for long, so my
advice is to create as many sock accounts as you can now.
My least favorite platform to create a new account on is Face-
book. You will be prompted for a cell number, among other infor-
mation) and VOIP numbers will not work. The best way around
this, at the time of writing, is to clear your cache and log out of all
accounts; connect to Facebook without the aid of any IP address
masking service employed, but instead of surfing to facebook.com,
instead head to m.facebook.com (the mobile version of the site) and
create an account from there. As we browse the Internet, we “leak”
information. When it is vital that we remain anonymous, there are
certain things we must hide:
• External IP
• Internal IP
• MAC address
• Internet service provider (ISP)
• General geolocation
• Operating system
• Browser type and version
• Language we use
Information Processing in Practice 147
There are many steps you can take: you can employ sock
accounts, turn off tracking, change privacy preferences, make use
of VPNs, turn off logging, or buy servers and services around the
world with prepaid credit cards or Bitcoin, for example.
You must also make sure that, even when you’re on a VPN, your
computer doesn’t contact your normal DNS server. Your ISP could
leak your host IP if they deploy a proxy to redirect your traffic back
to their DNS server. Newer Windows operating systems have a built-
in feature called smart multihomed name resolution, which makes
it very easy for DNS leaks to appear. To protect yourself you can
choose among a multitude of solutions, but they must be applied
against the corresponding issue. For example, if your ISP deployed
a transparent proxy, its job is to hide in plain sight and intercept
your traffic, leading DNS requests back to the ISP’s DNS server. The
only way to avoid this leak is to block the proxy on your VPN’s side.
You may employ your own proxy. A proxy is a widely used solution
to attempt anonymity online. It is meant to hide the IP address.
Various proxy solutions are available, such as web proxies and
software proxies. Basically, a proxy will redirect traffic to the desti-
nation from some other IP address.
Interestingly, a search engine can be used as a proxy. Google
has a feature called Google Translate that allows users to read web
content in many other languages. By browsing a site through this
feature, you can use Google as a proxy. This is often not applicable
to day- to- day OSINT investigations, but it’s worth mentioning for
those rare occasions where you’d find it helpful.
Finally, for OSINT operations, I choose Firefox. It is a browser
that has enhanced security and a feature called “add- ons” that are
often critical in making investigations easier—add- ons like Firefox
containers that isolate your searches. These containers are simi-
lar to normal tabs, except that each one has access to a separate
piece of the browser’s storage which means you can be logged into
multiple Facebook accounts at once, as an example, because data
between the tabs is not shared. The proxy you choose will have to
fit your requirements. Check out the notes section of this book
for further information. In addition, passive reconnaissance can
148 THE LAWS AND SKILLS
include DNS and SNMP mining, dumpster diving, a drive- by of
the premises, use of social media such as Facebook and LinkedIn,
and of course, Google dorking, among other techniques. When
considering a drive- by of an organization, you should contem-
plate their security cameras and things like how your vehicle fits
into the area. If you are going to Detroit, Michigan, and into a low-
income area, be sure you don’t rent a luxury car. Things like this
are seemingly inconsequential, but they might matter in the long
run. Other things that matter in passive recon are how you are
dressed, when you show up, and how many of your team mem-
bers show up.
Additionally, when creating a covert account to remain anon-
ymous or when you’re impersonating someone, you must use a
clean email address for your accounts. Every social media net-
work requests that you provide an email address in order to sign
up for an account, and using one that’s already an established
email address leaves you at risk of being tracked. Michael Bazzell
talks about this throughout his 8th edition of Open Source Intel-
ligence Techniques: Resources for Searching and Analyzing Online
Information (independently published, 2021). In it, Bazzell notes
his preference is to create a free email account at a provider like
Fastmail (fastmail.com), a unique, established provider that does
not require that you provide an established email address in order
to set up a new email address. He also notes that these provid-
ers are “fairly off the radar” of bigger services like Facebook,
and so undergo less scrutiny from them when looking for mali-
cious activity.
Finally, I’ve discussed at length the degree to which informa-
tion is the lifeblood of any operation. But it is learning how to
weaponize and leverage that information that is the key to this
mindset. Information is everywhere and can be valuable if your
thought process can make it so. A great way to find lots of informa-
tion quickly that your AMs can then parse and place into one of
those three buckets I often talk about (recon, pretext, disregard)
is through meta searching. Sending a request to a regular search
engine means you are searching that engine’s own database. A
Information Processing in Practice 149
meta search will allow you to search multiple search engines all
at once. Meta search engines send your queries to multiple data
sources and aggregate the results. Mamma, Polymeta, and Carrot2
are all solid examples. Carrot2 is a cluster engine, meaning it takes
the results it finds and (usually) categorizes them for you. Medi-
ainfo is a utility that displays hidden metadata within a media file.
ExifTool is an application for reading, writing, and editing meta
information in a wide variety of files. It’s easy to use from the com-
mand line and should not be overlooked.
Recon: Active
Active reconnaissance is information gathered about the target by
actually interacting with them or, as we often refer to it, “touch-
ing” them. The results of active recon are often much more spe-
cific and reliable but also much riskier to achieve. For example,
vishing a target within an organization is the equivalent of sniper-
style information gathering. If you miss and the target alerts the
organization of the shot you took, you risk blowing the operation
up or making it harder for yourself later. The same is true if you
send a phish to a target and the network catches it or if you aim
to socially engineer someone into giving you pointed and valu-
able information, but they become suspicious— you may make it
harder for yourself later. Any time you send a packet to a site,
your IP address is left behind; it’s the same in person— you will
almost always leave a trace.
There’s much to think about with active recon. As another
example, I would not vish a target directly prior to an in-p erson
attack if I couldn’t use an accent. I have a very strong and identifi-
able accent, and it could be too recognizable. I would use an accent
to call, but only one that I was sure I was a natural at.
Many people shy away from active recon, but it has a great value
that shouldn’t be ignored because of the risk. Rather, the risk should
be calculated and analyzed as a cost–benefit— what does it cost to
perform, and what’s the benefit if it goes right? But also, what’s the
150 THE LAWS AND SKILLS
cost to the operation of performing it unsuccessfully? There are
always new, creative collection efforts and exploitation activities
bringing data sources, but those efforts and activities can introduce
new complexities, too. You have to be able to lend some amount of
credence to your findings, especially if the attack hinges on their
being true. As an example, finding that a target used Pricewater-
houseCoopers as their accounting firm in 2015 by way of a leaked
document is somewhat valuable. What would be more valuable is
knowing that PwC is still the target’s accounting firm. As an ethical
attacker you can’t call PwC to ask, because they aren’t in scope, but
you might be able to call your target company to inquire using the
right pretext. In cases like these, active recon becomes valuable.
OSINT
The real backbone of recon, for most social engineering attacks, and
a cornerstone for network attacks, too, is open source intelligence
(OSINT). OSINT is intelligence drawn from material that is pub-
licly available. The tools and capabilities you use are ever- changing
and evolving. Because of the changing nature of publicly available
information, the current period is widely considered to be the sec-
ond generation of OSINT. Practitioners recognized that the rise of
personal computing in the 1990s would change the face, and indeed
function, of OSINT forever.
OSINT Over the Years
OSINT began as a defense- oriented enterprise. The Office of Strate-
gic Services (OSS) was a wartime intelligence agency of the United
States during World War II, and a predecessor to the Department of
State’s Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR) and the Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA).
In WWII, the OSS pored over obituaries in German regional
newspapers, pursuing news of important Nazis, movements, equip-
ment creation, and deployment. Images of new battleships, bomb
Information Processing in Practice 151
craters, and aircraft were fastidiously gathered and, when assessed
together, allowed the OSS to measure the state of its enemy, which
is exactly how we use it, too.
It’s remarkable how similar the OSS’s behaviors are to modern-
day OSINT investigation behaviors, notwithstanding computer
usage. It’s possible to argue that the roots of open source intelli-
gence stretch back nearly a century. Moreover, you could argue that
William Donovan’s quote, made decades ago, in which he stated,
“Even a regimented press will again and again betray their nation’s
interests to a painstaking observer,” is truer today than ever.
Prior to fighting in World War I, Donovan went to Columbia
Law School, where a young Franklin D. Roosevelt was among his
classmates. After the war, Donovan had a successful career as an
international lawyer, and scarcely missed out on becoming the US
Attorney General. During the period between WWI and WWII,
Donovan traveled the world as a lawyer, interacting with influen-
tial foreign figures and subsequently writing up reports for the US
government. It was Donovan’s connection to Roosevelt that led to
the creation of an intelligence agency in the United States. And
his quote still holds up today, among the billions of posts, uploads,
shares, and likes, that individuals again and again give away valu-
able, actionable information to painstaking observers.
At the end of WWII, the Foreign Broadcast Information Ser-
vice (FBIS) was taken over by the War Department on January 1,
1946. One year later, it was transferred to the CIA under the National
Security Act of 1947. By then it was a systematic organization. From
this time until the 1990s, the concerns of open source analysis were
mainly the monitoring and translating of foreign-p ress sources.
There are important differences between the first generation of
OSINT and the second (current) generation. With the first generation,
the collection of material was the bulk of the effort. The FBIS operated
20 worldwide bureaus to allow it to physically collect material. The other
function of OSINT at this time was the facilitation of trend analysis.
Today, open source intelligence is defined by the RAND Cor-
poration as “publicly available information that has been discov-
ered, determined to be of intelligence value, and disseminated by
152 THE LAWS AND SKILLS
a member of the IC [intelligence community].” https://www.rand.
org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR1900/RR1964/
RAND_RR1964.pdf. OSINT is information that can be accessed without
specialist skills or tools, although it can include sources only avail-
able to subscribers, such as newspaper content behind a paywall or
subscription journals. The CIA says that OSINT includes informa-
tion gathered from the Internet, mass media, specialist journals and
research, photos, and geospatial information and social media.
Events such as the Iranian Green Revolution in 2009 illus-
trate how using fresh practices of social media data collection can
provide a real-t ime intelligence picture in an otherwise inacces-
sible environment. Sometime in 2009, Iran was on the brink of a
“Green Revolution”; many of its citizens were protesting against the
regime and millions of young Iranians took to the Internet to coor-
dinate their activities, share viral content, and encourage others to
join in the revolution. For the first time, the Internet was awash
