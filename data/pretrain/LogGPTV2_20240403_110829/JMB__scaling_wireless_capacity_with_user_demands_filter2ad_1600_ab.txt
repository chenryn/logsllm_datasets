between any of the APs and clients. If each AP i simply transmits
the signal xi(t), each client will receive a linear combination of the
transmitted signals. Since each client has only one antenna, client 1
receives y1(t) = h11x1(t) + h12x2(t) and client 2 receives y2(t) =
h21x1(t) + h22x2(t). Each of these equations has two unknowns, and
hence, neither client can decode its intended data.
In order to deliver two concurrent packets to the two clients, the
APs need to ensure that each client receives only the signal intended
for it (i.e., it experiences no interference from the signal intended for
the other client). Speciﬁcally, we need the effective channel experi-
enced by the transmitted signal to be diagonal, i.e.,, it should satisfy:
(cid:18)y1(t)
(cid:19)
y2(t)
(cid:18)g11
0
=
(cid:19)(cid:18)x1(t)
(cid:19)
x2(t)
0
g22
,
(1)
where g11 and g22 are any non-zero complex numbers. In this case,
the received signal will simply appear at each receiver as if it has
experienced the channel gii, which each receiver can estimate using
standard techniques.
The APs can achieve this result by using beamforming. In beam-
forming, the APs measure all the channel coefﬁcients from the trans-
mitters to the receivers at time 0. Then, instead of transmitting x1(t)
and x2(t) directly, the APs transmit:2
= H−1
(cid:19)
(2)
In this case, the two clients receive:
(cid:18)s1(t)
(cid:18)y1(t)
(cid:19)
s2(t)
y2(t)
x2(t)
(cid:18)x1(t)

(cid:18)s1(t)
(cid:18)x1(t)
s2(t)
x2(t)
(cid:19)
= H
= HH−1
Since HH−1 = I, the effective channel experienced by the clients
in this case is a diagonal matrix, i.e., Eq. 1 is satisﬁed. Hence, each
client can now decode its intended data without interference from
the signal intended for the other client.
With Oscillator Offset: What happens when the oscillators of the
APs and clients have different frequencies? Let ωTi be the oscillator
frequency of AP i, and ωRj be the oscillator frequency of client j,
i, j ∈ {1, 2}. In this case, the channel at time t, H(t), can be written
as:
(cid:18)h11ej(ωT1−ωR1)t
h21ej(ωT1−ωR2)t
H(t) =
(cid:19)
,
h12ej(ωT2−ωR1)t
h22ej(ωT2−ωR2)t
where j = sqrt(−1). Because the oscillators rotate with respect to
each other, the channel no longer has a ﬁxed phase.
Now, if the APs try to perform beamforming as before, using the
channel value they computed at time t = 0 and transmitting H−1(cid:126)x,
the clients receive: (cid:18)y1

but we omit that detail for simplicity.

cannot decode their intended signal. Thus, standard MIMO beam-
forming does not work in this case.
So how can one do beamforming with such a time varying chan-
nel? A naive approach would try to make each transmitter compute
H(t) at every t and then multiply its time signal by H(t)−1. Say that
the network has N APs and N clients. Then such an approach would
require each transmitter to maintain accurate estimates of N2 fre-
quency offsets of the form ∆ωij = ωTj − ωRi. (Further since nodes
can only measure frequency offsets relative to other nodes, but not
the absolute frequencies of their oscillators, the number of estimates
cannot be reduced to N.) Measurement errors from all of these esti-
mates will accumulate, prevent accuracy of beamforming, and create
interference at the receivers. However, according to our intuition at
the beginning of this section, we can make multiple transmitters act
as if they were one big MIMO node, and hence do accurate beam-
forming, by having each transmitter estimate only its frequency off-
set to the lead transmitter. Said differently, our intuition tells us that
it should be possible to reduce the number of frequency offset esti-
mates that each transmitter maintains from N2 to one. Let us see how
we can achieve this goal.
Observe that we can decompose the channel matrix at time t as
H(t) = R(t)HT(t), where H is time invariant, and R(t) and T(t)
are diagonal matrices deﬁned as:
R(t) =

Since R(t) is diagonal, it can function analogous to the G ma-
trix in Eq. 1. Thus, if the transmitters transmit the modiﬁed signal
T(t)−1H−1(cid:126)x at time t, then the received signal can be written as:

Note that T(t) is also diagonal, and as a result the transmitter

is also diagonal. Further, the phase correction entry for each AP de-
pends only on the oscillator phase of that AP. This means that if each
AP, i, knows its phase, ejωTit, at time t, it can simply compensate
for that phase and the AP will not need any additional frequency or
phase measurements. Unfortunately, this is not practical. An AP has
no way to measure the exact phase change of its oscillator locally.

Since the new observed channel matrix is still diagonal, the clients

The resulting system implements our intuition at the beginning of
this section.

5. JMB PROTOCOL
We start by describing the protocol at a high level, and follow
by the detailed explanation. JMB’s distributed transmission protocol
works in two phases:
• JMB starts with a channel measurement phase, in which the APs
measure two types of channels: 1) the channels from themselves
to the receivers (i.e., the matrix H), which is the beamforming
channel whose inverse the APs use to transmit data concurrently
to their clients; and 2) the channels from the lead AP to the slave
APs (the hlead
’s), which enables each slave AP to determine its
relative oscillator offset from the lead AP.
• The channel measurement phase is followed by the data trans-
mission phase. In this phase, the APs transmit jointly to deliver
concurrent packets to multiple receivers. Data transmission uses
beamforming after having each slave AP corrects for its frequency
offset with respect to the lead AP.
i
Note that a single channel measurement phase can be followed by
multiple data transmissions. Channels only need to be recomputed
on the order of the coherence time of the channel, which is sev-
eral hundreds of milliseconds in typical indoor scenarios [9]. §7 de-
scribes how JMB reduces channel measurement overhead in greater
detail.
We now describe the channel measurement and data transmission
phases in greater detail. (The description below assumes symbol
level time synchronization, for which we use the scheme in [30],
which provides tight synchronization up to a few nanoseconds.
Our experimental results also incorporate an implementation of that
scheme).
5.1 Channel Measurement
i
The goal of channel measurement is to obtain a snapshot of the
channels from all APs to all clients, i.e., H and the reference channels
from the lead AP to the slave APs, i.e., the hlead
,∀i.
The key point is that all these channels have to be measured at the
same time, which is the reference time t = 0. Otherwise the channels
would rotate with respect to each other due to frequency offsets and
hence be inconsistent. Below, we divide channel measurement into a
few sub-procedures.
(a) Collecting Measurements. The lead AP starts the channel mea-
surement phase with a synchronization header, followed by channel
measurement symbols, i.e., known OFDM symbols that the clients
can use to estimate the channel. The channel measurement symbols
are separated by a constant gap, whose value is chosen to permit the
slave APs to send their channel measurement symbols interleaved
with the symbols from the lead AP. When the slave APs hear the

surement symbols in the gap, one after another, as shown in Fig. 3.
Thus, channel measurement symbols are repeated and interleaved.
They are repeated to enable the clients to obtain accurate channel
measurements by averaging multiple estimates to reduce the impact
of noise. They are interleaved because we want the channels to be
measured as if they were measured at the same time. Since exactly
simultaneous transmissions will lead the APs to interfere with each
other, JMB performs a close approximation to simultaneous trans-
mission by interleaving symbols from different APs.
(b) Estimating H at the clients. Upon reception of the packet in
Fig. 3, each client performs three tasks: it computes its carrier fre-
quency offset (CFO) to each AP; it then uses its knowledge of the
transmitted symbols and the CFO to compute the channel from each
AP to itself; and ﬁnally it uses its knowledge of the CFOs to rotate
the phase of the channels so that they look as if they were measured
exactly at the same time. We detail these tasks below.
Different transmitters (i.e., APs) have different oscillator offsets
to the receivers, and the receiver needs to measure the frequency off-
set from each transmitter to correct the corresponding symbols from
that transmitter appropriately. To enable this, the channel measure-
ment transmission uses CFO symbols from each receiver followed
by channel estimation symbols similar to traditional OFDM [15].
The only departure is that the receiver computes and uses different
CFO and channel estimates for symbols corresponding to different
APs.
Note that these channel estimates are still not completely simulta-
neous, in particular, the channel estimation symbols of slave AP i is
separated from the symbol of the lead AP by i − 1 symbol widths,
as shown in Fig. 3. The receiver compensates for this by rotating the
estimated channel for AP i by e−j∆ωi(i−1)kT+D (in each OFDM sub-
carrier), where T is the duration of one OFDM symbol, k is the index
of the interleaved symbol, and D is the duration of the lead AP syn-
chronization header. This ensures that all channels are measured at
one reference time, which is the start of the synchronization header.
The receiver averages the channel estimates (in each OFDM subcar-
rier) from each AP to cancel out the noise and obtain an accurate
estimate. The receivers then communicate these estimated channels
back to the transmitters over the wireless channel.
(c) Estimating the hlead
’s at the Slave APs. Each slave AP uses the
synchronization header to compute the value of the channel from the
lead AP to itself at the reference time hlead
(0).
Note that at the end of the channel measurement phase, each slave
AP i has the entire channel matrix to be used for beamforming, as
well as a reference channel, hlead
(0) from the lead AP which it will
use during data transmissions, with all channels measured with re-
spect to one reference time.
