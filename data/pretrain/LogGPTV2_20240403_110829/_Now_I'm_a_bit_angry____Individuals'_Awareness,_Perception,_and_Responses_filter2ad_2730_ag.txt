A Survey Material
A.1
Informed consent
Study Title: Awareness, Risk Perception, and Reaction Toward Data
Breaches
Principal Investigators: REDACTED
Purpose of this Study: We are conducting a research study to understand
how users perceive and react to data breaches.
Description of your involvement: If you agree to be part of the research
study, we will ask you to complete an online survey where you will be asked
to review data breach records associated with one of your email addresses
based on a public database of security breaches (haveibeenpwned.com) and
answer a few questions about the displayed records. We anticipate the survey
will take about 15 minutes.
Requirements: To participate in the study, you must (1) be 18 years old or
older; and (2) currently live in the United States.
Beneﬁts: You may not receive a direct beneﬁt from participating, but this
study will help us develop better systems and technologies that empower
Internet users to protect themselves against data breaches.
Risks: The risks and discomfort associated with participation in this study
are no greater than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during use of
the Internet.
Compensation: You will be compensated $2.50 upon completing the survey.
Conﬁdentiality: By participating in the study, you understand and agree
that the REDACTED may be required to disclose your consent form, data
and other personally identiﬁable information as required by law, regulation,
subpoena or court order. Otherwise, your conﬁdentiality will be maintained
in the following manner:
Your data and consent form will be kept separate. Your research data
will be stored securely and will only be accessible to the study team. By
participating, you understand and agree that the data and information gathered
during this study may be published in an academic journal or conference
paper. You will not be asked to provide any direct personal identiﬁers in the
study apart from your email address. We do not track or store your email
address as part of this study, and we will not be able tie your email address
to any results or analysis. All records of your email address will reside only
in temporary storage to facilitate the lookup of data breaches your email
address was involved in and will be deleted following the completion of this
task. The researchers will never see your email address.
Right to Ask Questions & Contact Information: If you have questions
about this research, you may contact the study team at REDACTED
The REDACTED Institutional Review Board has determined that this
study is exempt from IRB oversight.
Voluntary Consent: By proceeding to the next page, you are agreeing to
participate in this study. Please be sure that we have answered any questions
you may have about the study, and you understand what you are being asked
to do. You may contact the researchers at any time by emailing REDACTED
if you think of a question later.
STATEMENT BY PERSON AGREEING TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS
STUDY I have read this informed consent document and the material con-
tained in it has been explained to me. I understand each part of the document,
all my questions have been answered, and I freely and voluntarily choose to
participate in this study. I can choose to withdraw from this research project
at any time without penalty.

A.2 Email address-related questions
We are going to ask you to enter your most commonly used email address at
the bottom of this page. We will use your email address to look up whether
your email address has been disclosed in any data breaches (also called “secu-
rity breaches”), using the public lookup service for data breaches haveibeen-
pwned.com. If your email address was involved in any data breaches, we will
ask you some questions about those breaches.
Privacy Notice: We do not track or store your email address as part of this
study, and we will not be able tie your email address to any results or analysis.
All records of your email address will reside only in temporary storage to
facilitate the lookup of data breaches your email address was involved in and
will be deleted following the completion of this task. The researchers will
never see your email address.
To access information about breaches, your email address will be commu-
nicated to haveibeenpwned.com, a public service not operated by us, which
maintains a database of data breaches involving email addresses. Communica-
tion with haveibeenpwned.com will occur on secure and encrypted channels,
and haveibeenpwned.com also does not permanently store email addresses
used in queries. As described in their privacy policy: “Searching for an email
address only ever retrieves the address from storage then returns it in the
response, the searched address is never explicitly stored anywhere.”
If you have any further concerns about providing your email address, you
may opt-out of the survey at this time. We will remove any record of your
participation. Note that if you choose to opt out, you will not be compensated.
