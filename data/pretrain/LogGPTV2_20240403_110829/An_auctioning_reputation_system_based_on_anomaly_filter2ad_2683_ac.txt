M model as the polynomial ﬁt that describes this correlation (the
dashed line in Figure 3). We deﬁne any seller whose average min-
imum starting bid is not in the 95% conﬁdence interval (below the
solid line) of this model as abnormal with respect to M. Note that
some sellers, for example 10260 from Section 3.2, have both a high
average minimum starting bid and a high average number of bids,
but are still classiﬁed as abnormal with respect to the M model.
This indicates that the large number of bids in their auctions can-
not be attributed solely to a low minimum starting bid, and another
explanation is necessary. The bidders’ proﬁle model, which we in-
troduce next, provides such an explanation.
4.4 Bidders’ Proﬁle Model (P)
The bidders’ proﬁle model (P) identiﬁes a group of bidders who
repeatedly bid, and lose, in a seller’s auctions. Such a group of
bidders act as shills for the seller: they participate in many auc-
tions but let other bidders win. We assume that legitimate bidders
participating actively in many auctions posted by a seller win auc-
tions at a rate similar to that of buyers participating less actively.
The P model compares cumulative distribution curves of repeating
bidders and winning bidders. A statistically signiﬁcant discrepancy
between these curves indicates the presence of bidders who repeat-
edly lose.
To identify a group of bidders who repeatedly bid in a seller s’s
auctions, we construct the cumulative bidder presence curve for
s. This curve enables us to identify repeating bidders because it
counts, for each bidder, the number of s’s auctions in which they
participated.
DEFINITION 2
(CUMULATIVE BIDDER PRESENCE (CBP)).
Let s be a seller. Let {b1, . . . , bn} be the set of n bidders who par-
ticipated in s’s auctions ordered such that p(bi, s) ≥ p(bi+1, s).
j=1p(bj, s) for 1 ≤ i ≤ n and S0 = 0. The cumu-
Let Si = Σi
lative bidder presence (CBP) curve for s is the piecewise linear
function connecting Si to Si+1 for all 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, scaled to the
continuous domain [0, 100].
The cumulative bidder presence curve helps us identify a group
of highly present bidders:
they heavily participate, compared to
other bidders, in s’s auctions. Since the bidder presence values are
sorted in descending order, the existence of such a group appears
visually as a CBP curve lying well above the linear line f (x) = x,
as in the case of 10260 (Figure 4a). When all bidders are more
equally present, the curve is close to linear, as in the case of 10417
(Figure 4c).
To better understand the intuition behind the cumulative bidder
presence curve, compare the curves of 10260 and 10417. Consider
point A in the CBP curve of seller 10260 (Figure 4a). It shows that
10% of all bidders who participated in 10260’s auctions partici-
pated in 98% of his auctions. In comparison, Figure 4c shows that
10% of the bidders in 10417’s auctions participated in only 20%
of his auctions (point C). In other words, when compared against
10417, the auctions of 10260 contain a group of highly present
bidders: a small set of bidders who participate in many auctions.
We found that 95% of the sellers’ CBP curves passed below the
point (10%, 28%). That is, for 95% of the sellers, 10% of the
bidders participated in fewer than 28% of that seller’s auctions. We
call the curve that passes through (10%, 28%) the normal bidder
presence curve, shown as the bold line in Figures 4a and 4c. Note
that 10260’s CBP curve is above the normal curve while 10417’s
is below.
To determine whether a group of bidders who repeatedly partic-
ipate in a seller s’s auctions also repeatedly lose, we construct the
cumulative bidder wins curve for s. This curve counts the number
of auctions won by each bidder.
DEFINITION 3
(CUMULATIVE BIDDER WINS). Let s be a
seller. Let {b1, . . . , bn} be the set of n bidders who participated
in s’s auctions as identiﬁed in Deﬁnition 2. Denote as w(s, bi) the
number of times bi won an auction of s. Let Wi = Σi
j=1w(s, bj )
for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n and W0 = 0. The cumulative bidder wins curve
for s is the piecewise linear function connecting Wi to Wi+1 for
all 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, scaled to the continuous domain [0, 100].
When we compare this curve to the cumulative bidder presence
curve we can identify a group of bidders that repeatedly partici-
pate and lose. Consider the cumulative bidder wins curve of 10260
from Figure 4b. The same 10% of the bidders who placed 98% of
the bids (point A) won only 20% of the auctions (point B). In com-
parison, 10% of the bidders who placed 20% of the bids in 10417’s
auctions also won 20% of the auctions (point C in Figure 4d).
When we plot the two curves on the same axes, the difference
between 10260 and 10417 becomes apparent. In the case of 10260,
there is a gap between the two curves (Figure 4b); this gap indicates
that the most frequent bidders in 10260’s auctions are also frequent
losers. In comparison, there is no gap between the curves of 10417;

Seller 10260. A small set of bidders frequently participate in
10260’s auctions and lose. Visually, this can be seen in as the gap
between the two curves in Figure 4b.
Seller 10417. Bidders win proportionally to their attempts. Visu-
ally, there is almost no gap between the curves in Figure 4d.

all sellers and each seller’s unique cumulative bidder presence curve and cumulative bidder wins curve.
this means that the most frequent bidders in 10417’s auctions have
the same winning rate as other bidders in 10417’s auctions. For
each seller s, we deﬁne its P score as the difference between the
presence and win curves at the 10% point on the x-axis.
We deﬁne an abnormal seller with respect to P as follows. First,
at the 10% point, the value of the seller’s cumulative bidder pres-
ence curve must be above the value of the normal curve. Sec-
ond, the gap between the presence and the win curves should be
statistically high, deﬁned as a value above the conﬁdence interval
constructed around the average gap with a coverage probability of
95%. By this deﬁnition, seller 10260 is abnormal and 10417 is
normal with respect to the P model.
4.5 Auctioning Reputation Score
Our auctioning reputation score is a vector of three variables
hVN , VM, VP i, where each variable is a number between 0 and
100 and represents the coverage probability needed to include the
seller inside a conﬁdence interval. For example, consider again the
seller 10260, whose reputation score is h99, 96, 99i. This means
that if we want to deﬁne 10260 as normal with respect to N , we
need to construct a conﬁdence interval of 99%. Similarly, if we
want 10260 to be normal with respect to M, we need to construct
a conﬁdence interval of 96%. Last, for normality with respect to P
we need an interval of 99%.
The amount by which we need to increase the conﬁdence interval
to redeﬁne an anomalous seller as normal indicates the anomalous-
ness of the seller. For example, if the P score for seller S1 is 96
and the score for seller S2 is 99, it means that S1 is closer to the
normal curve and therefore is less anomalous than S2.
5. CASE STUDIES
Out of the 604 high-volume eBay sellers contained in our dataset,
our reputation system identiﬁed 54 (9%) as abnormal with respect
to at least one model. Of these ﬁfty-four, eight are abnormal with
respect to at least two models, and three are abnormal with respect
to all three models. Figure 5 shows the distribution of all the abnor-
mal sellers with respect to the three models. We now analyze four

of the abnormal sellers identiﬁed by our system and present a sum-
mary of our observations about these four sellers. Table 2 shows
the reputation scores of these four sellers, along with a summary of
the analysis.
Seller 10260 is abnormal with respect to all three models: both
his N and P scores are 99% However, 10260 is only marginally
abnormal with respect to the M model, with a score of 96% (Fig-
ure 5c). Our empirical analysis of seller 10260’s auctions revealed
that there was a group of bidders who always participated in his
auctions but rarely won (Section 3.2). This behavior pattern is con-
sistent with shilling [27].
Seller 7504 sold DVD drives for laptops and posted seventy-ﬁve
auctions that always started at $1. With such a low minimum start-
ing bid, it is not surprising that his auctions received an unusually
high number of bids (Figure 5b). We identiﬁed a bidder who partic-
ipated in every one of 7504’s auctions and always placed an early
bid at a ﬁxed price of $66. Although this bidder never won a single
auction, his bids always pushed the ﬁnal price from less than $50
to more than $67. Our investigation showed that a price of $66 is
higher than the market value of the DVD drives, and we were able
to ﬁnd other eBay auctions for similar items that ended at a lower
price. This behavior is consistent with shilling.
Seller 672 also sold DVD drives for laptops and posted 20 auc-
tions during our data collection period. The winning rate of the top
