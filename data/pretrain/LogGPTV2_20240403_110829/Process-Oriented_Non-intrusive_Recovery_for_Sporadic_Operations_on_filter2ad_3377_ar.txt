The recovery impact of the selected recovery action is the optimal/acceptable one, which means 
that  its  recovery  impact  is  relatively  small  compared  to  all  other  recovery  actions.  Such 
selection  and  optimization  mechanism  guarantees  that  the  recovery  impact  can  meet  the 
recovery impact objective set by stakeholders. Hence, the requirement that the recovery should 
reduce negative impact is achieved. 
D.  Recovery Reducing Monetary Cost 
1)  Experimental Procedure 
This recovery requirement concerns the monetary cost the recovery incurs on the cloud system. 
We  therefore  measure  recovery  monetary  cost  by  performing  the  installation  operation  on  a 
cloud  application.  There  is  no  software  running  in  the  cloud  instances  during  the  installation 
operation. We used our own proprietary fault injection tool to inject faults for each of the two 
determined  recovery  points  in  the  installation  operation,  automatically  determined  the 
applicable  recovery  patterns  based  on  the  applicable  recovery  patterns  filtering  method 
described in section 7.3, and performed recovery using the selected acceptable recovery action 
based on each of the two recovery action selection methods. The faults injected are described in 
Table  22. The  selection  of  injected  faults  is  based  on  our  interviews  with  industry  and  failure 
reports, and hence representative. The recovery monetary cost is calculated by summing up the 
109 
monetary  cost  incurred  by  each  step  in  the  recovery  action.  We  ran  the  experiment  30  times, 
measuring the average recovery monetary cost.

2)  Experimental Results 
Table  23  shows the  recovery  monetary  cost of  the recovery  for  the installation operation. The 
recovery monetary cost in the table represents the average value of the recovery monetary cost 
for  30  runs.  The  highest  relative  standard  deviation  is  0%.  For  each  recovery  point,  the 
monetary  cost  of  the  recovery  action  selected  by  the  Pareto  set  search  based  optimization 
method  is  no  greater  than  the  other  applicable  recovery  actions;  the  monetary  cost  of  the 
selected  recovery  action  by  the  user  constraints  based  optimization  method  is  not  necessarily 
less  than  all  the  other  ones,  but  it  is  within  the  monetary  cost  constraint  set  by  business 
stakeholders.

3)  Satisfying Recovery Requirement R4 
The recovery monetary cost of the selected recovery action is the optimal/acceptable one, which 
means that its recovery monetary cost is relatively small compared to all other recovery actions. 
Such  selection  and  optimization  mechanism  guarantees  that  the  recovery  monetary  cost  can 
meet the recovery monetary cost objective set by stakeholders. Hence, the requirement that the 
recovery should reduce monetary cost is achieved. 
E.  Recovery from Errors without Known Causes  
1)  Experimental Procedure 
POD-Recovery does not require a known cause: its recovery plan generation dynamically finds 
a  plan  from  the  current  erroneous  state  to  a  desired  state  –  be  it  a  captured  earlier  state  or  an 
expected future state. To study this aspect in detail, we performed additional experiments with 
other  faults.  We  ran  installation,  injected  various  faults,  and  triggered  recovery  without 
providing the error causes. Per type of injected fault, we performed 30 runs. 
2)  Experimental Results 
Table  24  summarizes  the  results  of  these  experiments,  by  showing  the  number  of  successful 
recoveries for each injected fault. As can be seen, recovery is successful for all injected faults, 
except  for  one:  the  fault  “cloud  system  disconnected”  refers  to  a  network  disconnect  between 
the recovery service and the AWS API. Due to this disconnect, POD-Recovery cannot take any 
recovery actions or even assess the current state of the resources, and hence cannot recover.
