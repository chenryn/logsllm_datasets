User: Created a gae project with the googleappengine launch and have been building it with textmate.
Now, I'd like to import it to the Eclipse PyDev GAE project. Tried to import it, but it doesn't work.
Anyone know how to do that? 
Thanks in advance.
Assistant: If you want to use Eclipse's Import feature, go with General -> File system.
