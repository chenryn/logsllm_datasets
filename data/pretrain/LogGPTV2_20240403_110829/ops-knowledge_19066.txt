User: Celery will send task to idle workers.
I have a task will run every 5 seconds, and I want this task to only be sent to one specify worker.
Other tasks can share the left over workers    
Can celery do this??   
And I want to know what this parameter is: CELERY_TASK_RESULT_EXPIRES
Does it means that the task will not be sent to a worker in the queue?
Or does it stop the task if it runs too long?
Assistant: Just to answer your second question CELERY_TASK_RESULT_EXPIRES is the time in seconds that the result of the task is persisted. So after a task is over, its result is saved into your result backend. The result is kept there for the amount of time specified by that parameter. That is used when a task result might be accessed by different callers.
This has probably nothing to do with your problem. As for the first solution, as already stated you have to use multiple queues. However be aware that you cannot assign the task to a specific Worker Process, just to a specific Worker which will then assign it to a specific Worker Process.
