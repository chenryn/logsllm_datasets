User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Windows Server restart / shutdown history How can I easily see a history of every time my Windows Server has restarted or shutdown and the reason why, including user-initiated, system-initiated, and system crashed? 

The Windows Event Log is an obvious answer but what is the complete list of events that I should view?

I found these posts that partially answer my question:


Windows server last reboot time includes several answers that partially address the full restart history
View Shutdown Event Tracker logs under Windows Server 2008 R2 includes an additional event id
Event Log time when Computer Start up / boot up includes some of the same event ids


but those don't cover every scenario AFAIK and the info is hard to understand because it is spread across multiple answers.

I have several versions of Windows Server so a solution that works for at least versions 2008, 2008 R2, 2012, and 2012 R2 would be ideal.

Assistant: The clearest most succinct answer I could find is:


How To See PC Startup And Shutdown History In Windows


which lists these event ids to monitor (quoted but edited and reformatted from article):


Event ID 6005 (alternate): “The event log service was started.” This is synonymous to system startup.
Event ID 6006 (alternate): “The event log service was stopped.” This is synonymous to system shutdown.
Event ID 6008 (alternate): "The previous system shutdown was unexpected." Records that the system started after it was not shut down properly.
Event ID 6009 (alternate): Indicates the Windows product name, version, build number, service pack number, and operating system type detected at boot time.
Event ID 6013: Displays the uptime of the computer. There is no TechNet page for this id.


Add to that a couple more from the Server Fault answers listed in my OP:


Event ID 1074 (alternate): "The process X has initiated the restart / shutdown of computer on behalf of user Y for the following reason: Z." Indicates that an application or a user initiated a restart or shutdown.
Event ID 1076 (alternate): "The reason supplied by user X for the last unexpected shutdown of this computer is: Y."  Records when the first user with shutdown privileges logs on to the computer after an unexpected restart or shutdown and supplies a reason for the occurrence.


Did I miss any?
