User: Backup delays will result in data loss, but daily backups consume a lot of storage space and CPU resources. Please suggest a good way to strike a balance between storage space and backup latency.
Assistant: A better method is to use the combination of incremental backup and differential backup. Incremental backup only backs up part of the data that is different from the last backup, while differential backup only backs up part of the data that is different from the last full backup. In this way, the storage space and CPU resources required for backup can be reduced, and key data can be backed up in time to avoid data loss as much as possible. At the same time, you can set the backup frequency and retention time as needed to further balance the trade-off between backup delay and storage space.
