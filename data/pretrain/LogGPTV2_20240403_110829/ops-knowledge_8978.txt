User: If I'm scheduling IO bound task in celery and if my server spec was like Quad Core with 8GB RAM, How many workers and concurrency I can use.
If CPU bound processes are advised to use 4 workers and 8 concurrency for Quad Core processor. Whats  the spec for IO bound process.
In my task I will be performing API calls, manipulating the received data and storing the processed data in server.
Assistant: That's like asking 'how long is a piece of string' and I'm sure there isn't a single simple answer. Certainly it will be more than 8 threads, with a useful upper limit at the maximum concurrent I/O tasks needed, maybe determined by the number of remote users of your service that the I/O tasks are communicating with. Presumably at some number of tasks 'manipulating the data' will start to load up your processor and you won't be i/o bound any more.
