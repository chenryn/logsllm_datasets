User: I'm trying to work out to integrate Python3 into Vim, I know I need to do it when compiling vim but I cant seem to get it right. I'm using homebrew to install with the following script: 
brew install vim --override-system-vim --with-python3
It installs vim however when i check the version, python3 is still not supported.
Assistant: Finally found the solution - $ brew install vim --with-python3
