I just ran across the bug described in issue #3020 (#3020) as our unit-tests
started failing after upgrading pandas.
I did a git bisection and found the first bad commit to be `9deda9e`:
    9deda9e687915017cc9db7698504ead1f89ead9e is the first bad commit
    commit 9deda9e687915017cc9db7698504ead1f89ead9e

        API: change resample to infer correct closed and label value by default #2363

I think this is a fairly serious regression as (apart from causing our unit-
tests to fail) it will silently give incorrect answers for an aggregation if
the data has been resampled beforehand.
The following unit-test demonstrates the problem:
def test_resample_doesnt_truncate():  
"""Test for issue #3020"""  
import pandas as pd  
dates = pd.date_range('01-Jan-2014','05-Jan-2014', freq='D')  
series = pd.TimeSeries(1, index=dates)  
series = series.resample('D')  
assert series.index[0] == dates[0]
