I recently encountered the bug described in issue #3020, as our unit tests started failing after upgrading pandas.

After performing a `git bisect`, I identified the first problematic commit as `9deda9e`:

```
commit 9deda9e687915017cc9db7698504ead1f89ead9e
Author: Chang She
Date:   Sun Dec 2 02:21:10 2012 -0500

API: Change resample to infer correct closed and label value by default #2363
```

This appears to be a significant regression, as it not only causes our unit tests to fail but also silently produces incorrect results for aggregations if the data has been resampled beforehand.

The following unit test demonstrates the issue:

```python
def test_resample_doesnt_truncate():
    """Test for issue #3020"""
    import pandas as pd
    
    dates = pd.date_range('01-Jan-2014', '05-Jan-2014', freq='D')
    series = pd.Series(1, index=dates)
    series = series.resample('D').sum()
    
    assert series.index[0] == dates[0]
```

This test should pass, but it fails due to the changes introduced in the identified commit.
