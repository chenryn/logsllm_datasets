### Issue Type
- Feature Request

### Ansible Version
- 2.0.1.0

### Summary
Currently, the `--check` option is only available as a command-line argument. Users may sometimes forget to include this option when running playbooks. It would be beneficial to have a `check_mode: True` setting within the playbook itself. This way, users wouldn't need to rely on remembering to add the command-line option.

Additionally, the output of a check mode run should be more clearly marked to indicate that it is a dry run and no actual changes will be made. This would help avoid confusion and ensure that users are aware that the playbook is running in check mode.

Thank you.
