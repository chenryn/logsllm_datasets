##### ISSUE TYPE
  * Feature Idea
##### ANSIBLE VERSION
    ansible 2.0.1.0
##### SUMMARY
\--check currently is only available as command line option and sometimes
people forget so it would be nice if there is something like `check_mode:
True` in playbook so we don't have to worry about command line options.
The output of check mode run should be more obvious to indicate that this is a
check only.
Thanks
