User: Please introduce the basic principles of JWT (JSON Web Token) and its application scenarios in web applications.
Assistant: JWT (JSON Web Token) is a lightweight and secure authentication mechanism based on the JSON format and using signature or encryption to verify identity and transmit information. JWT consists of three parts: 1. Header (head): Contains the JWT type and the algorithm used. 2. Payload: The payload contains the information to be transmitted, such as user ID, order ID and other data. 3. Signature: Combine the Header, Payload and Secret Key (key), and use the digital signature generated by the algorithm used to ensure that the Signature is generated from the original data and prevent data from being tampered with. In web applications, JWT is often used as an authentication and authorization mechanism. When the user logs in, the server generates a JWT and sends it to the client as part of the response. The client stores the JWT locally, and every time it requests the server, it will bring the JWT as part of the Authorization Header (authorization header). After receiving the request, the server will check the validity of the JWT and perform corresponding operations based on the information in the Payload. The advantage of using JWT is that it does not need to store any session information on the server side, so it can be easily extended and cross-domain requests, and it also ensures security, because JWT can use signature and encryption to prevent data from being tampered with.
