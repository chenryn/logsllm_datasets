Hi,
I investigated an enjoying bug in terms of the auto formatting in atom. This
happens if you call "Auto Ident" or if code becomes pasted into the editor.
In many languages, e.g. Java, Javascript, PHP, ... the following should be
formatted as this:
    if(somevariable === 3)
       alert(somevariable);
    somevariable++;
This is the similar behavior as:
    if(somevariable === 3) {
       alert(somevariable);
    }
    somevariable++;
Atom unfortunately format all lines behind the statements the following way:
    if(somevariable === 3) 
       alert(somevariable);
       somevariable++;
Hope this can be fixed soon üëç
