User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Our logs showing a lot of SSH brute force attacks originating on Port 11 this forum has been brilliant so far. Just wondering if I can get a bit more help:

Can I get some info on a large amount of SSH brute force attacks originating from port 11 on the external host over the past 1 month

Now I know that port number can be faked, but if it isn't, what possibly could be causing this? I've looked for some tools that use port 11, but no joy

If you have any ideas on what it is, or how I can get more info, I'll be extremely grateful

Assistant: Source port numbers are normally chosen at random so as not to interfere with servers listening on "well-known" ports. If machine A is a client to machine B (e.g. B is your SSH server), then the kernel on A will normally choose a random free "high" port, because if it chooses port N, then this will prevent any potential connection from B to a server running on A and bound on port N.

However it is trivial to choose a specific source port; it is a matter of a simple bind() call prior to the connect(). For port values which are lower than 1024, on Unix systems, this requires root privileges, but we can assume that the attacker is root on his own machine. Why would an attacker do that ? Probably to fool badly-written firewall rules. Some sysadmins simply allow packets with low port values on the (mistaken) assumption that a low port can only be on the server side of a connection.

For the record, port 11 is for the systat service, an old-style way for sysadmins to gather some runtime system information on their machines.
