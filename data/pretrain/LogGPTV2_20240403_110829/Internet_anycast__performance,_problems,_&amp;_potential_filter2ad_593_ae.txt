replica from §4.4 over the L replica.
A simple, concrete implementation of this approach would
designate community tags wherein the first 16 bits are dis-
tinct, e.g., 0xfffe to avoid conflict with the reserved 0xffff
and the convention of using the first 16 to represent the
AS number originating the tag, and the last 16 bits encode
coarse latitude and longitude. Latitude varies -90 to 90, but
inhabited latitude is more -50 to 74 [41] and can thus be
encoded in 7 bits. Longitude varies -180 to 180, so can be
encoded in the remaining 9 bits easily. Anycast sites would
include the community tag in outgoing advertisements, these
tags would propagate as community tags do, and recipients
would be allowed to choose to select routes considering the
proximity of the destination(s) encoded in the last 16 bits. To
implement the proposed fix, BGP routers would need to be
configured with their latitude and longitude, perform compu-
tation to decode the encoded latitude and longitude in BGP

community tags, and to obtain distances to the destinations
in the routes. However, the lat/lon configuration is usually
one-time for each router, and the computation has little over-
head and only need to be executed when new routes are
received. Overall, we believe the proposed fix introduces lit-
tle overhead in FIB computation and should not significantly
impact control plane performance. Encoding geographical
information in BGP community to improve BGP selection or
diagnosis is already a practical method used in many ISPs
and IXPs [17, 48]. These examples suggest the practicality of
the proposed fix and a means to approximate it with explicit
preferences for specific sites.
We also implemented an experimental deployment on the
PEERING testbed [46] to estimate whether tags propagate
well enough to be used by distant ISPs. PEERING allows
researchers to announce prefixes allocated to the testbed
with customized BGP community tags from muxes at seven
different locations. For each PEERING mux, which repre-
sents an anycast replica, we embed a specific code in the
BGP community tags it announces. We announced the prefix
184.164.249.0/24 (ASN47065) from seven different locations
including Amsterdam, Athens, Los Angeles, Boston, Phoenix,
Seattle, Belo Horizonte (Brazil).
We characterized the propagation of community tags by
collecting BGP routes towards the prefix announced from
PEERING from 20 RouteViews [32] route collectors. By de-
fault, Cisco routers [10] do not pass BGP community tags to
their peers. Among the 20 collectors, 11 of them received
routes with customized community tags. The fraction of
routes to our announced prefix that have the community
tags ranges from 8% to 38% on the 11 collectors. Five col-
lectors received tags from their closest replica, i.e., they are
presented with the routes to their closest replica. The other 5
received tags from their second closest replicas; another one
is provided with tags to the fourth closest replica. The results
from this experiment are encouraging: Many of the clients
benefit from the geo-hints even with the BGP community
filtering as in today’s Internet.
To understand if our customized community tags from
PEERING testbed are treated differently from BGP communi-
ties that are already used in practice, we also characterize the
propagation of community tags from other ISPs, including
ServerCentral [48], Packet Clearing House [37] and Init7 [22].
We found similar propagation of BGP communities from the
measured ISPs as from PEERING testbed: 7 to 13 collectors
received routes with community tags, and usually less than
50% of routes received at the collectors contain community
tags. Incomplete propagation of community tags deserves
dedicated study to understand how and why these they are
filtered: in theory, these are transitive attributes that could
help optimize routes, but their potential is limited in practice.
Other forms of hints. If BGP were to be extended to add
tags specific to anycast prefixes, other forms of hints, both
static and dynamic, can easily be added. One static hint would
simply report only the number of sites reachable via a route.
From this number, the BGP router could choose the feasible
route that advertises the most sites, in the hope that one of
the many will be good. This integer hint would have even
lower overhead than the geographic list we have evaluated,
but may miss replica sites served by smaller ISPs. It is, how-
ever, another instance of preferring the path that leads to the
largest provider for an anycast address, generalizing Ballani’s
single-provider approach [4].
On the other end of the spectrum, measurement services
could update hints based on load or latency, allowing anycast
to natively approximate more sophisticated server selection
algorithms that rely on extensive measurement infrastruc-
tures. A major advantage of our proposal is that regardless
of hint type, it remains incrementally deployable, compat-
ible with existing BGP policy, and should for some reason
the hints be removed from advertisement (e.g., because the
performance monitoring service experiences a temporary
failure), performance defaults to regular BGP-based anycast
behavior. Finally, the architecture is flexible enough to per-
mit different types of hints to be added by different anycast
services, and for ASes to employ their own mechanisms to
evaluate hints and choose the best route.
6 CONCLUSION
IP anycast serves as the foundation of some of the most crit-
ical network infrastructure, and yet its inefficiencies have
long gone misunderstood and unfixed. Using passive and
active measurements, we have presented an in-depth root-
cause analysis of the inefficiencies of root DNS servers’ IP
anycast deployments. Our results empirically validate an ear-
lier hypothesis [4] that equal-length AS paths are largely to
blame for anycast latency inflation. Guided by these findings,
we presented a fix that reduces anycast inflation through the
use of geo-hints: small geographic hints included in BGP to
help routers more efficiently choose from among multiple
equal-length AS paths. Unlike prior proposals [3, 4], geo-
hints are easily and incrementally deployable. Crucially, geo-
hints demonstrates that IP anycast can be efficient without
having to rely on the cooperation of a single large upstream
provider.
