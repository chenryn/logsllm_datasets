"Please confirm the current mode of the log. The `mod_jk` child worker environment is in an error state, specifically state 6."

If you need to include the placeholder `<*>` for some reason, it can be integrated as follows:

"Please confirm the current mode of the log. The `mod_jk` child worker environment is in an error state, specifically state 6 (<*>)."
