It appears that PHP automatically replaces dots with underscores in parameter names for all global variables, such as `$_GET` and `$_POST`. This behavior is documented on both Stack Overflow and the PHP.net website. 

Since the `Request` class utilizes these global variables in its `createFromGlobals` method, the values in `Request::$query`, `Request::$attributes`, and similar properties are affected and may be "incorrect" due to this transformation.

Is this a known and accepted behavior within the community? I have prepared a Gist that includes a proposed solution. Would it be appropriate to submit a pull request (PR) with this fix, or should I wait for @fabpot's upcoming changes to the `RequestFactory` (issue #8957)?
