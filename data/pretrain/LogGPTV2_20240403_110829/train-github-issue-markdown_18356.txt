I didn't know but it seems that PHP is replacing dots by underscores in
parameter names in all global variables ($_GET, $_POST, ...). This bug in PHP
is described on stackoverflow and on php.net.  
Since the Request class uses those globals in `createFromGlobals` method, all
values in Request::$query, Request::$attributes, ... are "wrong".
Is this a known and accepted behavior ? There is a Gist with a proposed
solution. Do you think it is worth a PR or do I have to wait for @fabpot's one
on RequestFactory (#8957) ?
