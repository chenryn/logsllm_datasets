Manipulated input from the (compromised) host machine can lead to severe consequences, 
including financial loss, damage of reputation, security breach, and even put human lives in danger.

Our Scheme: IvoriWatch
• A transparent integrity verification mechanism for the web
• Goal: verify whether the input (or the request) 
received at the remote server has been modified.
• Based on wrist-worn wearable device 
• e.g., smartwatch, bracelet
• Typically equipped with motion sensors (accelerometer & gyroscope)
• Contributions
• Introduced a Novel Input-Integrity Verification Scheme – IvoriWatch
• Designed and Implemented IvoriWatch
• Evaluated in Benign and Adversarial Settings

Adversarial Model
• Victim’s terminal (or the client machine) has been remotely compromised
• Wrist-wearable is safe (not compromised)
1. User-Present
• Victim provides input to the remote server using the compromised client
• Adversary (or malware) attempts to manipulate the user-provided input
2. User-Away
• User forgets to log out his web-account or software application
• Utilizing the opportunity, remote adversary attempts to supply its fabricated input
• No clue about the remote victim’s activities 
• Consider various scenarios 
• Using terminal
• Using phone
• Writing
• Walking
• Miscellaneous

Key-Region Predictor
• Several statistical features are extracted from motion sensor data
• Infers the location of the key, i.e., left (L) or right (R)
• Consists of a well-trained RandomForest classifier

Experiment
• Participants: 20 student users 
• 13 males and 7 females
• Age ranges between 20-35
• All were touch typists
*The Practice Test: https://thepracticetest.com
9
Experiment
•
•
•
•
• Leveraged “The Practice Test”* website that offers online typing lessons
• Each user typed for 10 minutes while wearing watches on both hands. 
• 20 user sessions resulted 20 samples in total

Experiment
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
• Motion-data for User-Away setting
• randomly selected two participants.
• five different regular activities - walking, writing, using-phone, using-terminal, and 
miscellaneous 
10
Evaluation Preliminaries
• Considered three different settings
• Left-Hand
• Right-Hand
• Both-Hands -- exploratory
• Input 
• must be at least a word of five characters
• can be a combination of words with variable character length
• Each word from input and corresponding motion data from wrist-wearables 
was separated
• `n’ (where 1<=n<=10) consecutive words were combined in a sliding window 
fashion to form variable lengths input
11
Evaluation Preliminaries
• Employ Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) cross-validation approach
• For input-texts from a given user, predictor was built using samples from all 
other users
• Resulted in a user-agnostic prediction model
11
Evaluation Preliminaries
•
•
•
• Evaluation Metrics
• False Negative Rate (FNR)
• False Positive Rate (FPR)
• Equal Error Rate (EER)
