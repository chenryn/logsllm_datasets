## Abstract
IvoriWatch is a transparent integrity verification mechanism designed to ensure the integrity of user input (or requests) from a client machine. The system leverages wrist-worn wearable devices, such as smartwatches or bracelets, which are typically equipped with motion sensors (accelerometers and gyroscopes). The primary goal is to verify whether the input received at the remote server has been modified. This paper introduces the IvoriWatch scheme, its design, implementation, and evaluation in both benign and adversarial settings.

## Introduction
In the web-configurable computing paradigm, various applications such as banking transactions, email, medical devices (e.g., cardiac pacemakers, blood pressure sensors), and smart home systems (e.g., security cameras, voice assistant speakers) rely on the integrity of user input. Manipulated input from a compromised host machine can lead to severe consequences, including financial loss, damage to reputation, security breaches, and even endanger human lives.

### Example of an Input Manipulation Attack
**Banking Trojans, e.g., ZeusVM**
- **Scenario**: A user initiates a fund transfer of $500.00 from their account to another.
- **Compromised Host**: The malware modifies the amount and destination account.
- **User Confirmation**: The user receives a confirmation SMS for a $5,000.00 transfer to a different account.

To mitigate such risks, it is crucial to check the integrity of user input (or requests) from a client machine.

## Our Scheme: IvoriWatch
IvoriWatch is a novel input-integrity verification scheme based on wrist-worn wearable devices. The key contributions include:
- **Introduction of IvoriWatch**: A transparent integrity verification mechanism.
- **Design and Implementation**: Detailed design and implementation of the system.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluation in both benign and adversarial settings.

### System Overview
- **Input and Timestamps**: Collects user input and corresponding timestamps.
- **Motion Sensor Data**: Utilizes data from the wearable device's motion sensors.
- **Ivori-Engine**: Correlates the input and motion sensor data to determine if the input is legitimate or corrupted.

### Adversarial Model
- **Victim’s Terminal Compromised**: The client machine is remotely compromised.
- **Wrist-Wearable Safe**: The wearable device is not compromised.
  - **User-Present**: The victim provides input using the compromised client, and the adversary attempts to manipulate the input.
  - **User-Away**: The user forgets to log out, and the adversary supplies fabricated input.

### Working Principle
- **Keyboard Region Division**: Divides the keyboard into left (L) and right (R) regions.
- **System Parameters**: 
  - Window size: 10
  - Threshold: 70%
- **Key-Region Predictor**: Uses statistical features extracted from motion sensor data to infer the location of the key (L or R). Features include minimum, maximum, mean, median, variance, standard deviation, kurtosis, inter-quartile range, power, energy, spectral entropy, autocorrelation, skewness, peak-to-peak amplitude, peak-magnitude-to-rms-ratio, median frequency, and peak counts.

## Experiment
- **Participants**: 20 student users (13 males, 7 females) aged 20-35, all touch typists.
- **Procedure**: Users typed for 10 minutes while wearing watches on both hands, resulting in 20 samples.
- **User-Away Setting**: Randomly selected two participants to perform five regular activities (walking, writing, using phone, using terminal, miscellaneous).

## Evaluation Preliminaries
- **Settings**: Left-Hand, Right-Hand, Both-Hands (exploratory).
- **Input Requirements**: At least a word of five characters, combined in a sliding window fashion.
- **Cross-Validation**: Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) cross-validation.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: False Negative Rate (FNR), False Positive Rate (FPR), Equal Error Rate (EER).

### Performance of IvoriWatch
- **User-Presence**:
  - **Left-Hand**: EER = 0.15 (θ = 0.61)
  - **Right-Hand**: EER = 0.23 (θ = 0.58)
  - **Both-Hands**: EER = 0.13 (θ = 0.62)
- **User-Away**:
  - **Left-Hand and Both-Hands**: EER = 0.15 (θ = 0.61)
  - **Right-Hand**: EER = 0.14 (θ = 0.60)

### Impact of Text Length
- **Similarity Threshold (θ) = 0.60**: Similar trends observed in Left-Hand and Right-Hand settings.

## Conclusion, Limitations, and Future Works
- **Introduction of IvoriWatch**: A transparent integrity verification system for remote user input based on wrist-wearables.
- **Performance**: Can identify legitimate input and detect manipulated input with minimal errors.
- **Future Improvements**:
  - Using wrist-wearables with higher sampling rates.
  - Evaluating with a larger and more diverse pool of participants.
  - Extending the system to other personal devices like laptops, mobile phones, and tablets.
