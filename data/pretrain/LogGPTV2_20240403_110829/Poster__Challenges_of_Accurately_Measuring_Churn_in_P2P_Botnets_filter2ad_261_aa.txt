ABSTRACT
Peer-to-Peer (P2P) botnets are known to be highly resilient to take-
down attempts. Such attempts are usually carried out by exploiting
vulnerabilities in the bots communication protocol. However, a
failed takedown attempt may alert botmasters and allow them to
patch their vulnerabilities to thwart subsequent attempts. As a
promising solution, takedowns could be evaluated in simulation
environments before attempting them in the real world. To ensure
such simulations are as realistic as possible, the churn behavior of
botnets must be understood and measured accurately. This paper
discusses potential pitfalls when measuring churn in live P2P bot-
nets and proposes a botnet monitoring framework for uniform data
collection and churn measurement for P2P botnets.

1 INTRODUCTION
Botnets are networks of malware infected machines, called bots,
that can be remotely controlled by attackers. These so called bot-
masters abuse the bots for criminal activities, e.g., spam distribution
and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Countermeasures
against such botnets greatly depend on the structure of the Com-
mand and Control (C2) channel implemented by the botnet. While
centralized C2 channels are still highly popular, they suffer from the
problem of having a single point of failure. To overcome this prob-
lem, botmasters opted for more resilient C2 channels. Among the
most resilient and sophisticated C2 channels are fully distributed
P2P botnets [8]. In a P2P botnet, each bot can be used to disseminate
commands issued by the botmasters.
To successfully attack such a botnet, detailed information about
its population and interconnectivity are required. However, even if
sufficient information is present, takedown attempts are highly chal-
lenging and could still fail [9]. Such failed takedown attempts may
alert botmasters and allow them to patch their botnet’s vulnerabili-
ties. A possible alternative to this problem is to use simulators such
as the open source Botnet Simulation Framework (BSF)1, as they
allow to experiment, prototype and evaluate takedown approaches
in a dynamic environment.
To facilitate realistic and accurate simulations in a simulator,
two components are crucial: 1) the communication protocol and
membership management, and 2) the churn behavior of the botnet,
i.e., nodes joining and leaving the botnet. While the former can be
precisely extracted by reverse engineering, the churn behavior has
to be measured on the live botnet itself. Obtaining accurate measure-
ments is crucial, as it greatly influences the botnet’s topology and
therefore its resilience and resistance to monitoring approaches [2].
The goal of this paper is to discuss the challenges of accurate
churn measurements. To address these challenges, we propose
Botnet Monitoring Framework (BMF) for accurate and uniform
data collection across multiple P2P botnets.

tions of P2P botnets.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2
introduces related work on measuring churn. Section 3 discusses
potential pitfalls and introduces BMF. Lastly, Section 4 summarizes
our discussions and provides an outlook on future work.
2 RELATED WORK
In this section, we provide a brief overview on related work in
measuring churn in P2P networks and botnets.
Stutzbach et al. analyzed the characteristics of churn in P2P
filesharing networks [4]. They reasoned that crawling at high speed
is essential for accurate churn measurements. Furthermore, they
show that Weibull distributions are better suited to accurately fit
churn measurements than exponential distributions.
Similarly to the previous work, Karuppayah [7] provided mea-
surements and Weibull distribution fits for the Sality and ZeroAc-
cess P2P botnets. Although, the churn behavior itself differs be-
tween filesharing and botnet P2P networks, the Weibull distribution
is reported suitable to fit the churn behavior in P2P botnets.
Based on existing churn distributions, Böck et al. [2] presented
an algorithm to replicate existing churn measurements accurately
within their botnet simulation framework. This work also discussed
the importance of accurate measurements to accurately replicate
churn behaviors to investigate P2P botnets in simulators.
Many other works such as [5, 6, 8] have discussed the effects
of churn in P2P botnets. They also highlighted the significance of
obtaining accurate churn behavior of P2P botnets. Although none
of them reported distribution fits for the data, they discussed on
the impact of churn towards measurement accuracy and diurnal
patterns. To the best of our knowledge, most of the work presented
above utilized standalone crawlers, sometimes in combination with
sensors to measure churn. As we will discuss in Section 3, such
standalone monitoring approaches would fail to address many of
the pitfalls of obtaining accurate churn measurements.
3 COMMON PITFALLS AND PROPOSED
METHODOLOGY
In this section, we discuss potential pitfalls in measuring churn on
live P2P botnets. Afterwards, we introduce an efficient and scalable
botnet monitoring framework that aims to address most of the
discussed pitfalls.
3.1 Pitfalls for Accurate Churn Measurements
To ensure that churn measurements are as accurate as possible,
potential errors in collecting and interpreting the data must be
considered. Stutzbach et al. presented a comprehensive list of po-
tential pitfalls in measuring and fitting distributions to churn [4].
We summarize these pitfalls (1− 7) and introduce three new pitfalls
(8 − 10) we have identified for P2P botnets.
P1 Missing Data Data must be complete for the period of dis-
tribution fitting. Otherwise, the missing data will adversely
influence the churn measurements of the affected nodes.
