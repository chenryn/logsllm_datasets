Table 1: Top 30 ASes that intercept more than 90% of paths.
(ASes headquartered in censor nations are highlighted.)
The top 2 ASes, AS3356 and AS174 (Cogent Communications),
intercept 2, 028, 831(= 1, 492, 079 + 536, 752) unique IP-prefix-to-
AS paths, (45.1% of all paths). The top 30-ASes by path frequency
together intercept 92.4% of all paths.
However, there is a major problem with considering the top-30
ASes as the preferred location for placing Decoy Routers. In Table 1,
which presents the corresponding ASes, their hosting country, and
their ranks based on path frequency (Pf r eq) and customer-cone
size (Csize), we highlight this problem: a substantial fraction of
these ASes lie in countries known to censor Internet traffic, such
as Russia and China 11. So the question arises whether we can find
acceptable alternatives.
As we see in Figure 5, while the number of unique paths in-
tercepted falls off rapidly, the total paths intercepted, including
overlaps, does not. This observation emboldens us to suggest that
ASes ranked 31 − 50 are comparable to those ranked 11 − 30 in
terms of the paths they intersect. Accordingly, from the ASes ranked
between 31 − 50, we selected 9 new ASes headquartered in non-
censorious regimes as replacements for the (likely) hostile ASes in
Table 1. These ASes are presented in Table 2.
Figure 4 presents the proportion of paths to Alexa top-100 web-
sites covered by our new set of key ASes (i.e. redefining key AS to
exclude ASes in censorious nations). We see by comparing with
Figure 3, that the chosen set of key ASes are roughly as effective at
intercepting traffic as the top-30 ASes. (To be exact, they intercept
90.2% of the AS-to-prefix paths, compared to 92.4% for the top-30.)
In fact, they do so consistently, for all target prefixes in our tests.

5.2 Identifying important routers inside key
ASes
The second part of our research involves identifying the impor-
tant routers inside key ASes. As described in Section 4.1, we used
Traceroute to probe IPs in each prefix advertised by the key ASes.
From these traces we determined the candidate routers that may
be replaced with DRs.
advertised by the AS. Depending upon the number of prefixes
advertised, and network latency, it took approximately 18 − 36
hours to probe an AS, and 5 − 8 hours for alias resolution.

Table 3: Edge routers, core routers, heavy-hitter routers
and the routers required for replacement with DRs. Apply-
ing our router selection strategy, for e.g. for AS3356 – edge
routers: 707 core routers: 303. Routers (both edge and core)
covering 90% of the paths: 576. We thus select the latter. Total
routers required for all the 30 ASes (headquartered in censo-
rious and non-censorious nations) : 12, 257.

Figure 5: No. of paths intercepted by each of the top-50 ASes
(sorted by path frequency).
We originally chose to näively replace edge routers with DRs,
as these intercept all traffic entering and leaving an AS. However,
we found that in many cases the total number of edge routers is
significantly greater than the number of “heavy-hitter” routers – a
set of edge and core routers that collectively appear in more than
90% of the traceroute paths for the AS. We therefore updated our
approach. For each AS, we now find both sets (edge routers and
heavy-hitter routers), and select the smaller set as the key routers,
