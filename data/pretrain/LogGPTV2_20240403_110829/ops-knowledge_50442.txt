Assistant: The construction of a successful IT shared service center can be divided into six stages, which we can call the 'six-stage' model. The 'six-stage' model can ensure that the construction of an IT shared service center realizes the expected value. The 'six-stage' model is divided into six steps, which are: Step 1: Goal positioning, reaching a consensus, determining the goal positioning of the IT shared service center, and reaching a consensus. Step 2: Sort out the status quo and identify pain points. Based on professional methodology, conduct research, sort out, identify gaps, and clarify pain points on the current status of IT shared service center construction. The third step: overall planning, top-level design, providing professional top-level design for the construction of the IT shared service center, ensuring the integrity, comprehensiveness and forward-looking design of the design. Step 4: Evolution planning, implementation path, provide evolution path planning for the construction of IT shared service center, determine stage goals, clarify construction scope, costs, risks, benefits, etc., and output project cards. The output of this phase is the implementation of the migration plan. Step 5: Implement guidance, monitor and rectify deviations. During the construction of the IT shared service center, consulting provides professional implementation guidance to ensure that the construction complies with the design, correct deviations, and ensure that the expected value can be realized. Step 6: Continuous improvement and value realization. The IT shared service center is already in operation. In order to adapt to changes in the external environment and internal requirements, the IT shared service center needs continuous improvement. Consulting can provide professional guidance for continuous improvement. The output of this phase is the continuous improvement plan of the IT shared service center.
