Despite attempting various methods, I have been unable to successfully perform batch image processing using Go with TensorFlow. I followed the example test case for the Inception model provided in the TensorFlow repository:

[Inception Model Example](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/go/example_inception_inference_test.go#L199)

I have tried multiple approaches, but none have worked. Any assistance or guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
