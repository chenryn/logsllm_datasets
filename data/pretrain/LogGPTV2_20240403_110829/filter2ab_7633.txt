### Title: A Decade After Stuxnet's Printer Vulnerability: Printing Remains a Path to Exploitation

**Abstract:**

In 2010, Stuxnet, one of the most sophisticated and damaging pieces of malware ever discovered, caused physical damage to Iranian nuclear enrichment centrifuges. To gain access to these centrifuges, Stuxnet exploited a vulnerability in the Windows Print Spooler service, allowing it to execute code with SYSTEM-level privileges. The critical nature of this vulnerability led many, including us, to believe that such attack surfaces would be thoroughly addressed within a decade. However, our recent research has shown that this is not the case.

**Key Findings:**

- **Persistence of Vulnerabilities:** Two out of the three vulnerabilities exploited by Stuxnet were never fully patched. Even the third vulnerability, which was believed to have been completely mitigated, remains exploitable through a different method.
- **Minimal Code Changes:** Microsoft has made minimal changes to the Windows Print Spooler mechanism over the past 20 years, leaving it vulnerable to new attacks.
- **New Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:** During our investigation of the latest Windows 10 Insider build, we discovered two zero-day vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities can be used for Local Privilege Escalation (LPE) to SYSTEM and Denial-of-Service (DoS). One of the vulnerabilities also introduces a new, previously unknown persistence technique.

**Presentation Overview:**

1. **Historical Context:**
   - Review of Stuxnet's original vulnerabilities and how they were partially patched, even multiple times.
   - Analysis of the third Stuxnet vulnerability in the Windows Print Spooler, which was thought to be fully patched but is now known to be still exploitable.

2. **Live Demonstration:**
   - A live demo of the two zero-day vulnerabilities discovered in the Windows Print Spooler:
     - The first vulnerability affects all Windows releases from 2000 to Windows 10 (both 32-bit and 64-bit).
     - The second vulnerability affects all Windows releases from Windows 7 to Windows 10 (both 32-bit and 64-bit).

3. **Research Methodology:**
   - Detailed explanation of our research process, methodology, and the custom tools we developed for this study.

4. **Mitigation Strategies:**
   - Recommendations for more robust ways to mitigate future exploitation of similar vulnerabilities.
   - Introduction of several open-source tools designed to test systems against these attacks, mitigate them, and assist other researchers in further challenging this mechanism.

By presenting these findings, we aim to highlight the ongoing risks associated with the Windows Print Spooler and provide actionable insights for improving system security.
