  * Would you like to work on a fix?
### How are you using Babel?
@babel/cli
### Input code
I tried to reproduce this in the REPL, but 7.17.10 isn't an option there and
that's the only version where I've seen this happen.
### Configuration file name
babel.config.js
### Configuration
_No response_
### Current and expected behavior
I have this simple method that produces a `get` function that will be used to
build an accessor. It' simple enough that up through 7.17.8 it came out of the
transpiler with only whitespace changes:
    makeGetter() {
      const wrapper = this;
      return function get() { return wrapper.getInfo( this ); };
    }
After updating `@babel/core` from `7.17.8` to `7.17.10` it's getting
transpiled to this:
      makeGetter() {
        return function get() {
          return this.getInfo(this);
        };
      }
### Environment
`@babel/core` \- `7.17.10`  
`node v16.14.0`
### Possible solution
