### Problem description
Dialog's `repositionOnUpdate` works wrong when height changes in one step
(e.g. from 600px to 900px).
### Link to minimal working code that reproduces the issue
You can see the problem in documentation (http://www.material-
ui.com/#/components/dialog). Use developer tools to see problem (you need to
doc it to the bottom of the screen).
  1. Open scrollable dialog (example number 5)
  2. Open / close developer tools
  3. You will see that dialog's bottom part is not available now (see video: http://take.ms/Yre18)
