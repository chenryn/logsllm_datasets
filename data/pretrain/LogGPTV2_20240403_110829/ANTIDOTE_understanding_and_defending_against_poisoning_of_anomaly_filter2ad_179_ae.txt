tector itself. At any time point ﬂagged as anomalous, the
training data is thrown out. Fig. 6 shows the proportion of
chaﬀ rejected each week by PCA (chaﬀ rejection rate) for
the Boiling Frog strategy. The three slower schedules enjoy
a relatively small constant rejection rate close to 5%. The
15% schedule begins with a relatively high rejection rate,
but after a month suﬃcient amounts of poisoned traﬃc mis-
train PCA after which point the rates drop to the level of
the slower schedules. We conclude that the Boiling Frog
strategy with a moderate growth rate of 2–5% can signiﬁ-
cantly poison PCA, dramatically increasing its FNR while
still going unnoticed by the detector.
By comparing Figs. 3 and 5, we observe that in order
to raise the FNR to 50%, an increase in mean traﬃc of
roughly 18% for the Single-Training Period attack is needed,
whereas in the Boiling Frog attack the same thing can be
10achieved with only a 5% average traﬃc increase spread across
3 weeks.
7. DEFENSE PERFORMANCE
We now assess how antidote performs in the face of two
types of poisoning attacks, one that lasts a single training
period, and one that lasts for multiple training periods. For
those 2 time horizons, we use the Add-More-If-Bigger poi-
soning scheme to select how much chaﬀ to add at each point
in time. We compare its performance to the original PCA-
subspace method.
7.1 Single Training Period Poisoning
In Fig. 7 we illustrate antidote’s FNR for various levels
of average poisoning that occur in a Single-Training Period
attack. We can compare this to Fig. 3 that shows the same
metric for the original PCA solution. We see here that the
evasion success of the attack is dramatically reduced. For
any particular level of chaﬀ, the evasion success rate is ap-
proximately cut in half.
Interestingly, the most eﬀective
poisoning scheme on PCA, Globally-Informed, is the most
ineﬀective poisoning scheme in the face of our robust PCA
solution. We believe the reason for this is that our Globally-
Informed scheme was designed in an approximately opti-
mal fashion to circumvent PCA. Now that the detector has
changed, Globally-Informed is no longer optimized for the
right defense. For this detector, Random remains equally
eﬀective because constant shifts in a large subset of the data
create a bimodality that is diﬃcult for any subspace method
to reconcile. This eﬀect is still muted compared to the dra-
matic success of locally-informed methods on the original
detector. Further, constant shift poisoning creates unnatu-
ral traﬃc patterns that we believe can be detected; we leave
the investigation of such techniques to future work.
Since poisoning activities distort a detector, it will aﬀect
not only the FNRs but also the false positives. To explore
this trade-oﬀ, we use ROC curves in Fig. 8 for both anti-
dote and PCA. For comparison purposes, we include cases
when the training data is both unpoisoned and poisoned.
For the poisoned training scenario, each point on the curve is
the average over 144 poisoning scenarios in which the train-
ing data is poisoned along one of the 144 possible ﬂows.
While antidote performs very similarly to PCA on unpoi-
soned training data, PCA signiﬁcantly underperforms an-
tidote under poisoning attacks. With a moderate mean
chaﬀ volume of 10%, antidote’s average ROC curve re-
mains close to optimal while PCA’s curve collapses towards
the y = x curve of the blind random detector. This means
that the normal balance between FNRs and false positives is
completely thrown oﬀ with PCA; however antidote contin-
ues to retain a good operating point for these two common
performance measures. In summary, when we consider the
two performance measures of FNRs and FPRs, we give up
insigniﬁcant performance shifts when using antidote when
no poisoning events occur, yet we see enormous performance
gains for both metrics when poisoning attacks do occur.
Given Figs. 7 and 8 alone, it is conceivable that antidote
outperforms PCA only on average, and not on all ﬂows tar-
geted for poisoning.
In place of plotting all 144 poisoned
ROC curves, we display the areas under these curves (AUC)
for the two detection methods in Fig. 9 under 10% chaﬀ. Not
only is average performance much better for robust PCA,
but it enjoys better performance for more ﬂows and by a
large amount. We note that although PCA performs slightly
better for some ﬂows, we see that in fact both methods have
excellent detection performance (because their AUCs are
close to 1), and hence the distinction between the two is
insigniﬁcant, for those speciﬁc ﬂows.
Fig. 10 plots the mean AUC (averaged from the 144 ROC
curves’ AUCs where ﬂows are poisoned separately) achieved
by the detectors, as the level of chaﬀ is intensiﬁed. Notice
that antidote behaves similarly to PCA under no chaﬀ
conditions, yet its performance quickly becomes superior as
the amount of contamination grows.
In fact, it does not
take much poisoning for antidote to exhibit much stronger
performance. With PCA’s performance drop, it starts ap-
proaching a random detector (equivalent to 0.5 AUC), for
amounts of chaﬀ exceeding 20%. In these last few ﬁgures,
we have seen the FNR and FPR performance as it varies
across ﬂows and quantity of poisoning.
In all cases, it is
clear that antidote is an eﬀective defense and dramati-
cally outperforms a solution that was not designed to be
robust. We believe this evidence indicates that the robust
techniques are a promising avenue for SML algorithms used
for security applications.
7.2 Multi-Training Period Poisoning
We now evaluate eﬀectiveness of antidote against the
Boiling Frog strategy, that occurs over multiple successive
training periods. In Fig. 11 we see the FNRs for antidote
with the four diﬀerent poisoning schedules. We observe two
interesting behaviors. First, for the two most stealthy poi-
soning strategies (1.01 and 1.02), antidote shows remark-
able resistance in that the evasion success increases very
slowly, e.g., after 10 training periods it is still below 20%.
This is in stark contrast to PCA (see Fig. 5) in which, for
example, after 10 weeks, the evasion success is over 50% for
the 1.02 poisoning growth rate scenario. Second, under PCA
the evasion success keeps rising over time. However with an-
tidote and the heavier poisoning strategies, we see that the
evasion success actually starts to decrease after some time.
The reason for this is that antidote has started rejecting
so much of the training data, that the poisoning strategy
starts to lose its eﬀectiveness.
To look more closely at this behavior we show the pro-
portion of chaﬀ rejected by antidote under multi-training
period poisoning episodes in Fig. 12. We see that the two
slower schedules almost have a constant rejection rate close
to 9%, which is higher than that of original PCA (which is
close to 5%). For the faster poisoning growth schedules (5%
and 15%) we observe that antidote rejects an increasing
amount of the poison data. This reﬂects a good target be-
havior for any robust detector—to reject more training data
as the contamination grows. From these ﬁgures we conclude
that the combination of techniques we use in antidote,
namely a PCA-based detector designed with robust disper-
sion goals combined with a Laplace-based cutoﬀ threshold,
is very eﬀective at maintaining a good balance between false
negative and false positive rates throughout a variety of poi-
soning scenarios (diﬀerent amounts of poisoning, on diﬀerent
OD ﬂows, and on diﬀerent time horizons).
8. CONCLUSIONS
We studied the eﬀects of multiple poisoning strategies
while varying the amount of information available to the at-
tacker and the time horizon over which the poisoning occurs.
