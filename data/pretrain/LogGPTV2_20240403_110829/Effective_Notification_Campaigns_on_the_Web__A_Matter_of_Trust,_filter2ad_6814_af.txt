A1 Signiﬁcance Tests
Tables 3 and 4 show survival rates after 35 (pre-reminder), 24
(reminder) and 55 (full time frame) days, respectively. Table 5
shows the corresponding signiﬁcance levels, with p-values
corrected for multiple tests with a single Holm-Bonferroni
correction [24] for all 45 signiﬁcance tests.
A2 Co-Owned Websites
Websites that list the same contact information in their imprint
are grouped as co-owned and notiﬁed in a single message.
Aside from reducing the number of messages to be sent, this
is done to model that these websites are related and may
thus be remediated at the same time. This grouping has to be
considered a ﬁrst approximation of the real operator structure,
as websites may list different owners but be maintained by
the same web design agency, which may take a notiﬁcation
as a reason to also check and repair other websites in their
portfolio. We received some indicators that this was the case,
but lack a method to quantify the effect on the measurement.
One might intuitively assume that, if an owner is notiﬁed
about its non-compliance for more than one website, it would
ensure that all websites are made compliant (or remain non-
compliant if they choose to ignore the notiﬁcation). In fact,
websites run by 77 out of 88 owners with more than one
website (87.5%) were either completely compliant or non-
compliant at the end of the study timeframe (40 compliant,

37 non-compliant, counting groups assigned to the control
group). Of the 40 compliant owners, 34 (85%) made all web-
sites compliant within a timeframe of at most 2 days between
ﬁrst and last remediation, with the remaining six groups taking
between 4 and 35 days to remediate the other websites.
A3 Google Analytics Misconﬁgurations
When activating IP Anonymization (AIP) for Google Analyt-
ics, operators can encounter several pitfalls. First, AIP must be
activated explicitly. Google implements AIP since May 2010.
Operators who included GA earlier must be aware of this
addition and change their website.Secondly, how to enable
AIP depends on how GA is included, e. g., for inclusion via
Google Tag Manager, the option must be set in Google’s web
interface, while adding the Analytics library via a 
tag requires additional JavaScript code to enable the option.
Thirdly, there are several versions (analytics.js and ga.js) of
the Analytics library, which require different approaches to
activate AIP. There are also loaders such as gtag.js, which
load these libraries, adding more variety in the approaches.
Fourthly, the option to enable AIP is case-sensitive and spelled
“anonymizeIp”, except in gtag.js, where the option is called
“anonymize_ip”. Note the lowercase “p” in “Ip”, which is
likely to be misspelled “IP.” Misspelling does not raise an er-
ror but silently ignores the option. Fifthly, the “anonymizeIp”
option must be set after conﬁguring the tracking ID but before
any requests to Google are issued. Again, there is no warning
that non-anonymized requests are issued when setting this
option too early or too late. Finally, an operator can deﬁne
several GA trackers on a single page. For each deﬁned tracker,
AIP has to be enabled separately. An example of different
misconﬁgurations is shown in Listing 1.
