Question: You are conducting a security test on a new web application that has implemented role-based access control (RBAC). The application includes roles such as administrator, auditor, support engineer, and customer. During your testing, you find that a support engineer is able to modify user permissions, a task typically reserved for administrators. Which of the following findings is likely to be true?
"A": "The granularity of the roles is appropriate, and the support engineer requires this permission to perform their job effectively.",
"B": "There is a potential misconfiguration in the RBAC setup that allows the support engineer more permissions than necessary.",
"C": "The application does not have an RBAC implementation, and role permissions are not defined.",
"D": "The support engineer's ability to modify permissions is an intended functionality for all users, indicating flat access control rather than RBAC."
Answer: B
