Question: A security analyst is reviewing the potential effectiveness of Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) as a mitigation against memory-safety vulnerabilities across different system architectures. Which of the following statements are accurate regarding the effectiveness of ASLR?
"A": "On a 32-bit system, ASLR provides substantial protection due to the high entropy available for address randomization.",
"B": "A 64-bit system offers more entropy for address randomization, making it significantly harder for an attacker to guess the correct address compared to a 32-bit system.",
"C": "ASLR is equally effective on both 32-bit and 64-bit systems because it changes the start of memory sections, hindering address guessing attacks.",
"D": "Memory leaks that disclose absolute addresses are ineffective against ASLR since it also randomizes relative addresses between variables."
Answer: B
