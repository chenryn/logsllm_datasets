For instance, diﬀerent 802.11 BSS’s in the given enterprise
may opt to use diﬀerent channels just to minimize interfer-
ence between them, or the insider rogue stations may ﬁnd
an unjammed channel to open a covert association to a col-
luder outside. For such cases, we could (1) introduce broad-
band jamming that jams multiple frequency bands simul-
taneously [5], or (2) jam with narrow-band jammers which
operate on diﬀerent frequency bands. Comparing the pros
and cons of these two approaches is beyond the scope of this
paper, and we simply explore the impact of narrow-band
jamming on neighboring channels in Section 3.
3. EXPERIMENTS
We validate our proposed model by measurements with
widely used IEEE 802.11g WLAN in the 2.4GHz band. We
use the ﬂat-surface propagation model with loss exponent
n = 4 to compare with the measurements. The experiments
are conducted in an outdoor site that is free of existing sig-
nals in the 2.4GHz band. The test site is a 10×10 meter
square with concrete ﬂoor.
The experiment is divided into two parts. First, we demon-
strate that the shape of the jamming boundary between
a jammer and a transmitter follows the theoretical model.
Second, we measure the jamming eﬀect on neighboring chan-
nels and estimate how many channels should be jammed to
block the attacker who tries to evade spectrally.
3.1
Jamming Boundary Formation
We use three laptops equipped with Atheros 5212 based
Wi-Fi adapters for a jammer, a transmitting AP, and a re-
ceiving station. They operate on Linux kernel with MadWiﬁ
driver. We use the modiﬁed MadWiﬁ driver for the jam-
mer. The modiﬁcation disables the carrier sense and skips
the back-oﬀ procedure, and thereby emitting the meaning-
less frames constantly, regardless of the activities of nearby
Wi-Fi devices. All of nodes operate on the same frequency
channel. The AP is placed 10 meters apart from the jam-
mer and sends 1Mbps UDP traﬃc to the wireless station
by using iperf. We change the location of the station in the
test site square and measure the delivery status of the traﬃc
from the AP.
We record the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the packet
delivery ratio (PDR) which is deﬁned as the number of suc-
cessfully received frames by the station to the number of
frames sent from the AP at intervals of one meter on the
10×10 meter grid. We use wavemon v.0.4.0b and iperf to
measure the SNR and the PDR.
We conduct the experiments for the three diﬀerent con-
ﬁgurations of the transmitting powers of the AP and the
jammer. For each pair of the AP and the jammer, we set
the transmitting powers to (6dBm, 0dBm), (0dBm, 0dBm),
and (0dBm, 6dBm). Each pair of conﬁguration corresponds
to PA = 4PJ , PA = PJ , and 4PA = PJ , respectively.
The result of the ﬁrst experiment is plotted in the graphs
of Fig. 2. The pattern of the SNR in each conﬁguration is
similar to that of the PDR. The SNR in theory should de-
crease smoothly as the station recedes from the AP, but
the results show that it drops rapidly near the jamming
boundary. This is because wavemon measures the SNR only
with the signal strength of the successfully received packets.
Hence, the SNR appears to drop precipitously to zero when
the association between the station and the AP is discon-
nected around the jamming boundary. Likewise, the PDR
drops to zero when the station is disconnected from the AP.
Along the theoretical model, the jamming boundary bends
toward the one emitting less power. The jamming bound-
ary in Fig. 2(a) is approximate to b4 in Fig. 1, and the same
trend holds in Fig. 2(c) with b2. When their transmitting
powers are equal, the jamming boundary is formed along the
centerline between them like b3.
3.2
Jamming Effect on Neighboring Channels
To investigate the jamming eﬀect on neighboring chan-
nels, we use the laptops equipped with the Wi-Fi adapter
based on the Atheros chip-set. The jammer, the AP, and
the receiving station are all located within one-meter radius.
The AP sends the 1 Mbps UDP traﬃc to the receiver sta-
tion by using iperf. While the AP transmits on one channel,
we sequentially change the jamming channel and observe the
PDR of the traﬃc between the AP and the receiving station.
We repeat this process for all 13 channels. The transmitting
powers of both the AP and the station are ﬁxed at the max-
imum (18dBm), and we conduct the experiment for the two
diﬀerent cases of jamming power (0dBm and 18dBm) to an-
alyze the inﬂuence of the jamming power.
The minimum-power jammer perfectly disconnects the com-
munication in the jamming channel and its neighboring two
channels on average. The maximum-power jammer inﬂu-
ences on the wider channels. We ﬁnd that the whole 2.4GHz
ISM frequency bands used by IEEE 802.11g are completely
jammed by either the minimum-power jammers which jam
ﬁve channels (Ch. 2, 5, 8, 11, 12) or the maximum-power
jammers which jam four channels (Ch. 3, 7, 10, 12).

JAMMER ARRANGEMENT
In this section, we discuss how to arrange the defensive
jammers to carve a wireless zone around an arbitrary geom-
etry. Note that our interest is not in developing an opti-
mal algorithm, but in presenting the feasibility of automatic
placement of defensive jammers.
Let us deﬁne the initial wireless zone IW Z as the wireless
coverage of an AP without jamming. The size of IW Z is
conﬁned by the transmitting power PA of AP. Because IW Z
exceeds the speciﬁed target zone T Z on which any intruder
cannot physically trespass, we want to conﬁne IW Z into
the secure wireless zone SW Z which ﬁts into T Z, by in-
stalling NJ number of defensive jammers around T Z. The
algorithms determine the transmitting power PJi and the
location LJi of each jammer Ji to satisfy this condition.
maximizing SW Z, 2) minimizing NJ , 3) minimizing(cid:80)
For simplicity we assume that T Z is a polygon and the
AP is not on the boundary of T Z. Our objectives are: 1)
i PJi .
In a real scenario, defensive jammers not only can be freely
placed, but also cannot be placed in random positions due to
the barriers such as uncontrollable structures and neighbor-
ing legitimate wireless zones. We address both of the cases
and provide the detailed algorithms for each case in [6].
4.1 Relocatable Defensive Jammers
In this scenario, we assume that we can control the loca-
tion of defensive jammers as well as the jamming power. To
maximize SW Z, the shapes of jamming boundaries need to
be straight along the side of the given polygonal T Z. As we
investigated earlier, a straight boundary is formed when the
jammer and the AP are line symmetrical to the jamming
boundary and their transmitting powers are equivalent.
If, however, the given target zone is a concave polygon,
then the placement of jammers should be considered more
cautiously. Simply ﬁnding the points of symmetry results in
unsuitable positioning of jammers especially in the concave
region of the given polygon. In Fig. 3(a), a concave octagon
consists of vertices, v1 ∼ v8. Diﬀerent from other vertices,
the internal angles of v5 and v6 are larger than their external
angle. Let us deﬁne the concave vertex as a vertex at which
the internal angle is larger than its external angle, and the
concave side group as the group of sides which include adja-
cent concave vertices. A concave polygon can have multiple
of concave side group, but the polygon in this example has
only one for simpliﬁcation. Instead of placing three jammers
corresponding to three sides in the concave side group of the
example, only one jammer can cover the concave area.
The vertex v4.7 is the middle point between the two end
vertices of the concave side group, v4 and v7. The line c
passes through AP and v4.7, four perpendicular lines l4,
l5, l6, and l7 to c pass through each vertex included in the
concave side group. Among these perpendicular lines, we
choose l5 which is closest to AP . In Fig. 3(a), the location
of jammer J4 is obtained by ﬁnding the point of symmetry
of AP to the selected line l5.
While the number of required defensive jammers is re-
duced by two, the formed SW Z only occupies about 65%
of T Z. To maximize SW Z, we can reduce the transmitting
power PJ4 of J4. Here, J4 should move closer towards AP
for SW Z not to exceeds T Z. In our simulation, a defensive
jammer can adjust its transmission power at intervals of ten
percent of the AP . We found SW Z is at peak size when
PJ4 = PA/10 and J4 moves to the point J4(cid:48). In so doing,
the size of SW Z increases to about 80% of the given T Z.
4.2 Fixed Defensive Jammers
Fig. 3(c) shows the scenario in which we can only control
the transmitting powers of defensive jammers. We assume
that each side of T Z has at least one corresponding defen-
sive jammer. Each jammer increases its transmitting power
to be higher than AP ’s, if the closer vertex to AP in the cor-
responding side is closer to AP than the jammer. It should
increase the power until the jamming boundary intersects
with the extended line of corresponding side. If the closer
vertex to AP in the corresponding side is closer to the jam-
mer than AP , the jammer inversely decreases its power un-
til the jamming boundary intersects with the corresponding
side. By using this method, the simulation in Fig. 3(c) de-
termines that the transmitting power of J1, J2, J3, and J4
should be 40%, 100%, 420%, 60% of PA, respectively, and
SW Z occupies about 56% of T Z. This tells us that there is
a limitation to maximize the SW Z without relocating the

5. RELATED WORK
There is a thick literature on protecting the conﬁdential-
ity in wireless networks. As mentioned in the introduction,
most of them focus on message encryption or authentication
protocols, which involve the innate key management prob-
lem. Our approach is diﬀerent from them in that it does not
require any pre-shared secrecy between nodes.
In [8], Sneth et al. uses multiple access points equipped
with directional antenna to conﬁne the wireless coverage.
Their mechanism, however, cannot defend against the in-
formation leakage. There are commercial products and ser-
vices based on wireless physical access control using location-
based access policy management [1] or ﬁne tuned distributed
antennas [2]. All of these approaches are very costly since
they require accurate site survey, testing, parameterization
of the building or zone of interest, and specialized hard-
ware/software systems. Tiwari et al. propose a radio device
to prevent access from the exterior of secure wireless area
in [9]. This device waits until receiving the internal wire-
less signal and sends the jamming signal to the direction of
the outside for cloaking messages. It requires the complex
hardware including two separate antenna for receiving and
transmitting, and should interpret the receiving signal in a
very short period.
6. CONCLUSION
Traditionally, jamming has been regarded only as an at-
tack method. In this paper, we completely reverse the view
and explore its potential as a defensive weapon against in-
formation leakage through covert wireless channel establish-
ment. As much as the jamming attack is hard to defend
against, the proposed “defensive jamming” can provide a
formidable physical barrier that both logical and physical
information leaking attempts can hardly break.
The protected geography created by defensive jamming,
which we term “jamming boundary”, is deﬁned by the power
and location arrangements of the protected APs and the
jammers. We derive a computational model of the jamming
boundary as a function of the powers and locations of the
APs and the jammers. To validate the proposed model,
we take extensive outdoor measurements and demonstrate
the SNR and the PDR indeed drops to zero at the jamming
boundary. Lastly, we discuss how to ﬁnd the optimal jammer
placement given the desired protected topology.
