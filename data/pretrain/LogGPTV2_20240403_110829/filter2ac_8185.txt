**ATT&CK ID:** T0848  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Rogue Master

Adversaries may set up a rogue master to exploit control server functions and communicate with outstations. A rogue master can send legitimate control messages to other control system devices, potentially disrupting processes in unintended ways. Additionally, it can intercept and receive network traffic intended for the actual master, thereby disrupting normal network communications. By impersonating a legitimate master, adversaries can also evade detection.
