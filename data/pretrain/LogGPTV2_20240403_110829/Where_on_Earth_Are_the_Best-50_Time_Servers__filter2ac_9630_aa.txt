# Where on Earth Are the Best-50 Time Servers?
**Authors: Yi Cao and Darryl Veitch**

**Abstract:**
We present a list of the top 50 public IPv4 time servers, identified by analyzing a high-resolution dataset of Stratum-1 servers. Our evaluation criteria include Availability, Stratum Constancy, Leap Performance, and Clock Error, with results broken down by continent. We find that servers with ideal leap performance, high availability, and low stratum variation often exhibit minimal clock errors, though this is not a guarantee. This paper discusses the relevance and longevity of our findings, the scalability of our approach, and implications for load balancing and server ranking.

## 1. Introduction
A significant portion of the global computer population achieves time synchronization through public time servers accessed via the NTP protocol. These servers are hierarchical, with Stratum-s (S-s) servers synchronizing to Stratum s-1 servers. At the top of this hierarchy are Stratum-1 servers, which have direct access to reference hardware.

Clients rely on their server's notion of time, but as we will describe, the quality of these servers can vary significantly, often without any warning to clients. Mapping out server quality across the Internet would be valuable both for its own sake and to inform client server selection. However, achieving this at scale and reliably, given the latency noise of the Internet, is challenging.

Recently, there has been increased attention on monitoring the health of time servers, particularly the critical Stratum-1 class. Techniques described in [5,18] enable the unambiguous detection of errors in server clock timestamps, even from vantage points with long and noisy paths. In [18], it was found that significant errors are not uncommon, affecting a surprisingly high proportion of popular public servers, including many from National Laboratories. These errors can be large (tens to hundreds of milliseconds) and long-lasting (from hours to months).

In this paper, we analyze the IPv4 dataset used in [5] to evaluate server quality based on four dimensions: Availability, Leap Second performance, Stratum Constancy, and Clock Errors. We limit our list to 50 servers and structure the results by continent and country, recognizing the importance of Round Trip Time (RTT) to synchronization performance. The primary goals are to provide a high-quality server list for measurement specialists, highlight ongoing server health issues, and explore the relationships between various quality metrics and actual server timing errors.

## 2. Background
### 2.1 Experimental Setup
The experiment covered a 64-day period from November 16, 2016, to February 2, 2017, including the end-2016 leap second. For each server, an independent request-response exchange daemon was launched, using a customized polling period as close to Ï„ = 1 second as possible.

For each successful round-trip NTP packet, a 4-tuple of timestamps {Ta,i, Tb,i, Te,i, Tf,i} was recorded. The timestamps Tb,i and Te,i were extracted from the returning NTP packet, along with the Leap Indicator (LI) bits and the server Stratum field. The timestamps Ta,i and Tf,i were passively tapped and hardware timestamped using high-performance Endace DAG 7.5G4 capture cards, synchronized to a rubidium atomic clock, which was itself locked to a roof-mounted GPS receiver.

The IPv4 servers studied came from five sources:
- Org: Public S-1 URL list maintained at ntp.org
- Pool: S-1 servers participating in the NTP Pool Project
- LBL: S-1 servers caught at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory border router
- Au: Set of Australian public-facing S-1 servers (plus 6 private)
- Misc: Miscellaneous servers of interest

Table 1 shows the breakdown of servers by source, and Table 2 provides a geographical breakdown. The low values for Africa (AF), Antarctica (AN), and South America (SA) reflect the immaturity of Internet timing infrastructure in these regions.

### 2.2 NTP Pool
The NTP Pool Project [11] provides a load balancing and convenient configuration service for millions of NTP clients by supplying a set of URLs resolved via a tailored DNS server. Users can access the complete worldwide pool at pool.ntp.org or subsets at #.pool.ntp.org, where # is one of {0,1,2,3}. These subsets are influenced by client geo-location and refresh every hour [12].

Client control is supported via CONT.pool.ntp.org (continental zone pools) and CY-coded country pools at CY.pool.ntp.org. The system uses DNS round robin to resolve URL queries to the IP address of a server in the pool. The NTP Pool includes a monitoring system that evaluates server performance based on NTP packet fields, and only servers with a score above 10 are made available.

## 3. Server Characterization
We characterize servers according to the following four criteria:

### 3.1 Availability
This is measured by the ratio of response packets received to request packets sent. It underestimates true availability due to packet loss and reachability failures.

### 3.2 Stratum Constancy
Possible stratum values range from S = 0 (unsynchronized) to S = 16. A well-managed Stratum-1 server in a stable environment should have a low "Stratum-1 downtime" (S1Downtime), which is the proportion of response packets reporting a stratum other than 1.

### 3.3 Leap Performance
Leap seconds are a stress test for servers, evaluating both clock performance and protocol compliance. We classify servers into:
- Ideal: No observed clock error, ideal protocol behavior
- Adequate: No clock error, compliant protocol behavior
- Clock Good: No evidence of clock error around the leap
- Clock Good Only (CGO): Clock-Good \ Adequate
- Clock Not Good (CNG): All \ Clock-Good

### 3.4 Clock Errors/Anomalies
Our methodology, pioneered in [18], uses baseline analysis of RTT timeseries to identify changes in the "Error" time series E(i). We classify servers based on the frequency and size of errors:
- Good: No errors
- Rare: Less than one error per week
- Common: More than one error per week, but not High
- High: Continuous stretches of error covering at least 25% of the trace

## 4. The Best-50 Servers
To identify the top 50 servers, we first assembled a list of high-quality servers based on Availability, Stratum Constancy, and Leap Performance. We then applied the Clock Error analysis to this smaller set, prioritizing servers with stable management and competent performance during high-stress events.

For Availability, we selected servers with at least 97% availability. For Leap Performance, we required servers to be in the Adequate class. We then ordered the remaining servers by S1Downtime and selected the top 50 whose Clock Error class was either Good or Rare.

Table 4 lists the Best-50 servers, organized by continent, country, and URL. Even among these top servers, some exhibited clock errors, highlighting the need for continuous monitoring and improvement.

## 5. Discussion
Our findings provide a valuable resource for measurement specialists and highlight the ongoing challenges in maintaining high-quality time servers. The scalability of our approach and the implications for load balancing services, such as the NTP Pool, are discussed. Future work will focus on refining our metrics and expanding the scope of our analysis.

## 6. Conclusion
This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the top 50 public IPv4 time servers, providing a reliable and scalable method for identifying high-quality servers. Our findings underscore the importance of continuous monitoring and the need for further research to improve the overall health and performance of time servers.
