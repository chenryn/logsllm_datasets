User: Hi I am writing a python script in windows and using subprocess
I have a line like

results=subprocess.Popen(['xyz.exe'],stdout=subprocess.PIPE)

After the script ends, and I get back to the promp carrot in cmd, I see more output from the script being printed out. 
I'm seeing stuff like

Could Not Find xxx_echo.txt

Being printed out repeatedly. 
How do I properly close the subprocess in windows?
Assistant: You need to call results.kill() or results.terminate() (they are aliases on Windows) to end your subprocesses before exiting your main script.
