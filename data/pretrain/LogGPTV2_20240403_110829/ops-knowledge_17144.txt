User:  Please analyze the log information of a network attack event and provide corresponding security defense strategies.
Assistant: Log information: Time: 2021-01-01 10:15:23 Source IP: 172.16.1.10 Target IP: 192.168.1.100 Protocol: TCP Port: 22 Event description: The source IP address 172.16.1.10 tries to log in to the target IP address through the SSH protocol 192.168.1.100 port 22, but the login fails. Security defense strategy: 1. Disable unnecessary services: According to this attack event, it can be seen that the attacker uses SSH to try to log in to the attacked host on port 22. Therefore, we recommend that administrators disable services that have not been used for a long time to ensure that network devices and servers only run essential services. 2. Enforce password policies: In order to reduce users from using weak or vulnerable passwords, administrators need to implement secure password policies. Such policies might include enforcing changes to weak passwords, limiting password length and complexity, enabling password lockout, and more. 3. Enable multi-layer authentication: Enabling multi-layer authentication is very important to protect network security. For example, the two-factor authentication (2FA) mechanism that only authorized users can access can be forced to be enabled, which can greatly increase the resistance to attacks. Even if the attacker tries to log in to the account and knows the password, a customized identification code is required to gain access. 4. Install a firewall: When the network administrator uses a more effective firewall policy (such as a white list system) to protect the gateway, it can prevent unauthorized access and port scanning by attackers. 5. Restricting remote access: Generally speaking, remote access is the weakness of sensitive protocols such as RDP and SSH, and remote administrators should be very cautious in using these protocols. The range of IP addresses and ports for remote access can be restricted, preventing attackers from connecting directly to devices on the network. 6. Monitor logs: Network administrators need to regularly monitor system logs, including checking login failure events and abnormal account behaviors of designated users whose servers cannot be used to log in, detect suspicious activities in time and respond immediately.
