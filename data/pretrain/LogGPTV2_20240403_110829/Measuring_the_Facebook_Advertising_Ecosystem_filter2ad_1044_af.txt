language of a text, we use the Google Translate API [12]. For
this analysis, we also consider only advertisers that targeted
more than three users.
Out of the 689 advertisers in our dataset that have sent ads
in English and have targeted more than three users, 79.4% are
one-disjoint and 14.8% are all-disjoint. For Portuguese, French
and German ads the percentage of all-disjoint advertisers are
5.7%, 14.5% and 15.8%.
We analyze next the all-disjoint advertisers with English
ads (Brazilian for DATA-BRAZIL). Table XVI presents the
fraction of all-disjoint advertisers that belong to the different
IAB categories in the Users column. We can see that News
and Politics is the category with the largest fraction of
all-disjoint avertisers. Table XVII presents a sample of two
advertisers and the text of their ads for different users in the
middle two rows. For Bloomberg, we see signs of possible
tailoring of the content with regard to each user: all ads User 1
has received are related to IT news, while User 3, has received
only ads that are about oil rigs. With eToro we do not see
such signs of tailoring, as all ads are related to stocks and
trading. While we see a large fraction of one or all-disjoint
advertisers, we cannot check whether the content of the ads
has been tailored for each exact user or it results from some
broader benign targeting strategy. Regardless, users do end up
seeing different ads from the same advertiser which might end
up inﬂuencing them in unknown (and potentially nefarious)
ways.10
3) Ads that change over targeting attributes: As a ﬁnal
point of analysis, we examine how the advertiser’s different
targeting strategies relate to the ad text. In other words, do
the advertisers create custom text when they choose different
targeting attributes, or do they tend to re-use the same ad text
across multiple attributes?
To do so, we ﬁrst consider advertisers who we observed
to use multiple different targeting attributes. We then calculate
the fraction of advertisers who never use the same ad text
with different attributes (i.e., those advertisers who we observe
to always have their ad text differ when they use different
attributes). Out of the 2,487 advertisers we considered, 64.7%
are observed to do so (3,949 and 50.3% for DATA-BRAZIL).
Table XVI presents the fraction of such advertisers that belong

to the different IAB categories in the Attr. column. Once
more News and Politics advertisers show this behavior more
frequently than most other categories.
our study focuses on ads on Facebook, and our data allows us
to investigate advertiser strategies at a ﬁner grain (e.g., looking
at speciﬁc attributes used for targeting).
In the bottom two rows of Table XVII, we present a sample
of advertisers and the text of their ads for different targeting
attributes from the News and Politics and Medical Health.
In the case of VICE News we see a clear tailoring of the
ads in accordance to the targeting attribute: for attributes like
Democratic Party or US politics (very liberal) we see more
political oriented ads, and for PC Magazine we see ads related
to technology. However with Merck Group, even though they
change the ad text, we do not see any apparent
tailoring
between the text of the ads and the targeting attribute used.
4) Takeaways: A surprisingly large number of advertisers
change the content of their ads either across users, across
targeting attributes, or across time. While this practice is not
entirely unexpected, that fact that it is very common amongst
advertisers in the News and Politics category is unsettling,
and emphasizes the need for auditing mechanisms that look at
how advertisers are changing the content of their ads and how
these changes impact users.
VI. RELATED WORK
In this section we review studies that are the closest to
our research; for a more general description of the landscape
of digital advertising we refer the reader to Chen et al. [26],
and for a general overview of privacy threats and protection
approaches in targeted advertising to Jim´enez et al. [29].
Studies of online ads: There are only a few studies, to our
knowledge, that looked at ad related data of real-world Face-
book users. The closest to our work is the study of Ribeiro et
al. [37] who analyzed 3,517 political ads on Facebook that
are linked to a Russian propaganda group: Internet Research
Agency (IRA) and were released by the Democrats Perma-
nent Select Committee on Intelligence in 2018. The study
explores the extent to which one can exploit the Facebook
targeted advertising infrastructure to target ads on divisive
and polarizing topics. In contrast, our study analyzes ads at
a much larger scale and focuses on how advertisers in general
are targeting their ads. Caba˜nas et al. [24] analyzed 126K
interests from the Ads Preferences pages of more than 6K users
and used the Facebook Ads API to show that Facebook has
inferred sensitive interests for 73% of EU users. This study
is complementary to ours as it focuses on what information
Facebook has inferred about users while we focus on how
advertisers are actually using this information to target users.
A number of studies have looked at online ads in general
and tried to understand and quantify how many are location-
based, contextual or behavioral [25], [35], [36], [42] and which
factors/user actions have an effect on the ads users receive
[23], [27], [30], [33], [34], [36]. The general methodology
behind such studies is to create fake personas (by using a
clean slate browser that visits certain speciﬁc sites) and then
study the ads that are delivered to these personas. The only
exception is the work of Parra-Arnau et al. [36] that performed
a small-scale study of web ads received by 40 real-world users
and observed that behavioral ads are more predominant on
careers, education, news and politics categories. In contrast,
Studies of ad transparency mechanisms: Advertising plat-
forms have started to provide users with privacy controls and
transparency mechanisms where they show users what data
they inferred about them or why they received a particular
ad. Several studies have pointed problems with current im-
plementations of such mechanisms [22], [27], [39], [42]. The
aforementioned works of Wills et al. [42] and Datta et al. [27]
suggested that the information provided in the Google Ad
Settings page might not be complete as they found cases
of targeted ads related to information that was not shown
in the respective Ad Settings. Andreou et al. [22] showed
through controlled experiments that the explanations provided
by Facebook from the Ad Preferences page and the “Why
am I seeing this?” button are often incomplete and sometimes
misleading. Finally, a few studies investigated the impact of
transparency mechanisms and privacy controls on the behavior
of users: Tucker [39] showed that after the introduction of
privacy controls in Facebook, users were twice as likely to
click on personalized ads, and Eslami et al. [28] uncovered
that users prefer interpretable non-creepy explanations. Our
study exploits information provided in the “Why am I seeing
this?” button to further identify advertisers’ targeting practices
that could potentially cause concern and, hence, require new
auditing mechanisms.
Vulnerabilities of advertising interfaces: A few studies
demonstrated how the Facebook advertising interface can be
exploited by malicious advertisers to violate the security or
privacy of users. Speicher et al. [38] showed that an ill-
intentioned advertiser can exploit the targeting options pro-
vided by Facebook to send discriminatory advertising by
targeting users based on their gender or race. Venkatadri et
al. [41] found that the user’s phone numbers which were
given to Facebook for security purposes could be utilized by
the advertisers to target users. In addition, Venkatadri et al.
[40] demonstrated several attacks that allow adversaries to
infer users’ phone numbers or de-anonymize the visitors of a
proprietary website. Finally, Korolova et al. [31] demonstrated
mechanisms through which an advertiser can infer the private
attributes of a user. In our study we just exploited the Facebook
advertising interface to gather various statistics about
the
attributes Facebook allows advertisers to target users.
VII. CONCLUSION
Online social network advertising is now a multi-billion-
dollar business. In this study, we shed some light into the
advertising ecosystem on one of the largest of such platforms
(Facebook) by collecting and analyzing data on the ads re-
ceived by more than 600 real-world users. We looked into
Who are the advertisers? as well as How are they using the
platform? Our analysis revealed the frequency of potentially
invasive and opaque targeting mechanisms (e.g., PII-based
and Lookalike audiences), as well as mechanisms that have
proven problematic in the recent past (e.g., free-text attributes).
Moreover, we demonstrated the existence of advertisers who
use a plethora of attributes to target users; who change the
content of their ads across time, users, and targeting attributes;
14
and who persistently target users across time. While our
ﬁndings do not directly speak to malicious activity, privacy
leaks, or discrimination, they raise questions that subsequent
research in auditing these platforms should focus on.
