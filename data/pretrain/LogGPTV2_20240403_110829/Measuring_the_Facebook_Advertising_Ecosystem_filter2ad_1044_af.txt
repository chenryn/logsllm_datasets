**Advertising Analysis:**
To analyze the language of a text, we use the Google Translate API [12]. For this analysis, we also consider only advertisers that targeted more than three users. Out of the 689 advertisers in our dataset that have sent ads in English and have targeted more than three users, 79.4% are one-disjoint and 14.8% are all-disjoint. For Portuguese, French, and German ads, the percentage of all-disjoint advertisers are 5.7%, 14.5%, and 15.8%, respectively.

**All-Disjoint Advertisers:**
We analyze next the all-disjoint advertisers with English ads (Brazilian for DATA-BRAZIL). Table XVI presents the fraction of all-disjoint advertisers that belong to the different IAB categories in the Users column. We can see that News and Politics is the category with the largest fraction of all-disjoint advertisers. Table XVII presents a sample of two advertisers and the text of their ads for different users in the middle two rows. For Bloomberg, we see signs of possible tailoring of the content with regard to each user: all ads User 1 has received are related to IT news, while User 3 has received only ads about oil rigs. With eToro, we do not see such signs of tailoring, as all ads are related to stocks and trading. While we see a large fraction of one or all-disjoint advertisers, we cannot check whether the content of the ads has been tailored for each exact user or if it results from some broader benign targeting strategy. Regardless, users do end up seeing different ads from the same advertiser, which might influence them in unknown (and potentially nefarious) ways.

**Ads That Change Over Targeting Attributes:**
As a final point of analysis, we examine how the advertiser’s different targeting strategies relate to the ad text. In other words, do the advertisers create custom text when they choose different targeting attributes, or do they tend to re-use the same ad text across multiple attributes? To do so, we first consider advertisers who we observed to use multiple different targeting attributes. We then calculate the fraction of advertisers who never use the same ad text with different attributes (i.e., those advertisers who we observe to always have their ad text differ when they use different attributes). Out of the 2,487 advertisers we considered, 64.7% are observed to do so (3,949 and 50.3% for DATA-BRAZIL). Table XVI presents the fraction of such advertisers that belong to the different IAB categories in the Attr. column. Once more, News and Politics advertisers show this behavior more frequently than most other categories.

**Takeaways:**
A surprisingly large number of advertisers change the content of their ads either across users, across targeting attributes, or across time. While this practice is not entirely unexpected, the fact that it is very common amongst advertisers in the News and Politics category is unsettling and emphasizes the need for auditing mechanisms that look at how advertisers are changing the content of their ads and how these changes impact users.

**Related Work:**
In this section, we review studies that are the closest to our research. For a more general description of the landscape of digital advertising, we refer the reader to Chen et al. [26], and for a general overview of privacy threats and protection approaches in targeted advertising to Jiménez et al. [29].

**Studies of Online Ads:**
There are only a few studies, to our knowledge, that looked at ad-related data of real-world Facebook users. The closest to our work is the study of Ribeiro et al. [37] who analyzed 3,517 political ads on Facebook that are linked to a Russian propaganda group: Internet Research Agency (IRA) and were released by the Democrats Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence in 2018. The study explores the extent to which one can exploit the Facebook targeted advertising infrastructure to target ads on divisive and polarizing topics. In contrast, our study analyzes ads at a much larger scale and focuses on how advertisers in general are targeting their ads. Cabañas et al. [24] analyzed 126K interests from the Ads Preferences pages of more than 6K users and used the Facebook Ads API to show that Facebook has inferred sensitive interests for 73% of EU users. This study is complementary to ours as it focuses on what information Facebook has inferred about users, while we focus on how advertisers are actually using this information to target users.

**Online Ads in General:**
A number of studies have looked at online ads in general and tried to understand and quantify how many are location-based, contextual, or behavioral [25], [35], [36], [42], and which factors/user actions have an effect on the ads users receive [23], [27], [30], [33], [34], [36]. The general methodology behind such studies is to create fake personas (by using a clean slate browser that visits certain specific sites) and then study the ads that are delivered to these personas. The only exception is the work of Parra-Arnau et al. [36] that performed a small-scale study of web ads received by 40 real-world users and observed that behavioral ads are more predominant on careers, education, news, and politics categories. In contrast, our study focuses on ads on Facebook, and our data allows us to investigate advertiser strategies at a finer grain (e.g., looking at specific attributes used for targeting).

**Ad Transparency Mechanisms:**
Advertising platforms have started to provide users with privacy controls and transparency mechanisms where they show users what data they inferred about them or why they received a particular ad. Several studies have pointed out problems with current implementations of such mechanisms [22], [27], [39], [42]. The aforementioned works of Wills et al. [42] and Datta et al. [27] suggested that the information provided in the Google Ad Settings page might not be complete as they found cases of targeted ads related to information that was not shown in the respective Ad Settings. Andreou et al. [22] showed through controlled experiments that the explanations provided by Facebook from the Ad Preferences page and the “Why am I seeing this?” button are often incomplete and sometimes misleading. Finally, a few studies investigated the impact of transparency mechanisms and privacy controls on the behavior of users: Tucker [39] showed that after the introduction of privacy controls in Facebook, users were twice as likely to click on personalized ads, and Eslami et al. [28] uncovered that users prefer interpretable non-creepy explanations. Our study exploits information provided in the “Why am I seeing this?” button to further identify advertisers’ targeting practices that could potentially cause concern and, hence, require new auditing mechanisms.

**Vulnerabilities of Advertising Interfaces:**
A few studies demonstrated how the Facebook advertising interface can be exploited by malicious advertisers to violate the security or privacy of users. Speicher et al. [38] showed that an ill-intentioned advertiser can exploit the targeting options provided by Facebook to send discriminatory advertising by targeting users based on their gender or race. Venkatadri et al. [41] found that the user’s phone numbers, which were given to Facebook for security purposes, could be utilized by the advertisers to target users. In addition, Venkatadri et al. [40] demonstrated several attacks that allow adversaries to infer users’ phone numbers or de-anonymize the visitors of a proprietary website. Finally, Korolova et al. [31] demonstrated mechanisms through which an advertiser can infer the private attributes of a user. In our study, we just exploited the Facebook advertising interface to gather various statistics about the attributes Facebook allows advertisers to target users.

**Conclusion:**
Online social network advertising is now a multi-billion-dollar business. In this study, we shed some light into the advertising ecosystem on one of the largest of such platforms (Facebook) by collecting and analyzing data on the ads received by more than 600 real-world users. We looked into "Who are the advertisers?" as well as "How are they using the platform?" Our analysis revealed the frequency of potentially invasive and opaque targeting mechanisms (e.g., PII-based and Lookalike audiences), as well as mechanisms that have proven problematic in the recent past (e.g., free-text attributes). Moreover, we demonstrated the existence of advertisers who use a plethora of attributes to target users; who change the content of their ads across time, users, and targeting attributes; and who persistently target users across time. While our findings do not directly speak to malicious activity, privacy leaks, or discrimination, they raise questions that subsequent research in auditing these platforms should focus on.
