Metabolomic analysis of hydrophilic metabolites is required in many research areas such as cancer biology, infection studies, diabetes, plant biology and 
in the attempt to understand basic principles of cellular regulation However, quantitative and reproducible analysis of charged and hydrophilic CCEM 
intermediates is a challenging task which requires specific quenching/ extraction methods along with protection against degradation and inter-metabolite 
conversion Using a combinatorial approach of ion pairing and ion exchange LC-MS/MS we separated and detected 152 phosphorylated, zwitterionic and 
carboxylated hydrophilic metabolites We assessed cold quenching and cryo-extractions under various pH conditions and categorized stability conditions 
for metabolite classes such as nucleotides, nucleosides, CoA esters, TCA acids, sugar bisphosphates, etc, in different cell extracts We demonstrate 
that under specific pH conditions even very labile metabolites such as CoA esters, nucleotides, sugar bisphosphates, GSH or NAD(P)(H) cofactors can 
be stabilized over 24 h at 4 °C By spiking various non-labeled metabolites to U13C-labelled Ecoli cells immediately before cold quenching/extraction 
we quantified the turnover and interconversion rates of various metabolites and pinpoint minimum bias conditions for the analysis of small molecule 
intermediates of the CCEM We provide full solutions to assess CCEM intermediates of prokaryotes (in suspension), cancer cells (adherent) and snap-frozen 
plant tissue

High-Resolution μ-scaled Magic-Angle Spinning NMR Mapping of diseased rat brains
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Covadonga Lucas-Torres, CEA Saclay, France
CO-AUTHORS: Yusuke Nishiyama, Alan Wong
In vivo MRS is a powerful spectroscopic technique for unveiling the metabolic distribution in tissue lesions However, it can be limited by the spectral and 
spatial resolution for a comprehensive and unbiased metabolomic investigation Localized NMR-based metabolic profiling on excised tumorous rat brain 
has been accomplished herein for the first-time under the recently introduced HR-μMAS technology (1) A total of 108 biopsies have been systematically 
sampled from 4 specific brain slices (2 control and 2 tumor) with an excellent spectral resolution (6 ppb at 117 T) and spatial sampling resolution (a voxel 
of 06 mm3) These resolutions are superior to those acquired from today’s advanced localized in vivo MRS (with MRI) The excellent spectral data quality 
has allowed 95% of the acquired data for generating reliable statistical models The initial multivariate data analysis discriminates between control and 
tumor, allowing for a preliminary inspection of the data and identification of the principal metabolic profile of the tumor (ie increase in cholines, taurine 
and glucose; decrease in NAA) The superb resolution has also unbiasedly unfolded the increased level of glycine content, in which the signal in in vivo 
MRS is often overlapped with that of myo-inositol Moreover, the study has also capitalized the good spatial sampling resolution and revealed the different 
metabolic distributions across the brain slice This study with HR-μMAS NMR offers a glimpse of its potential for investigating μg-scaled tissue biopsy

Electroextraction-based sample preparation strategies for enrichment of low-abundant metabolites
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Peter Lindenburg, Analytical Biosciences & Metabolomics, Leiden Centre for Applied Bioscience,  
Leiden University, Netherlands
CO-AUTHORS: Amar Oedit, Yupeng He, Thomas Hankemeier
In biomass-limited samples, such as for example mouse brain tissue samples, the analysis of low-abundant metabolites remains a challenge as these 
metabolites fall below the limit of detection of these techniques SPE- and LLE-based sample pretreatment procedures suffer from practical limitations 
(ie sample handling) when analyzing biomass-limited samples Electroextraction (EE) is an electromigration-based sample pretreatment technique 
which depends on the application of an electric field over a liquid-liquid system that consists of immiscible organic donor and aqueous acceptor phases 
The discontinuous electric field that is present in such liquid-liquid systems is the driving force behind the analyte enrichment capacity of EE As a 
consequence, EE-based sample pretreatment improves the detection limits and enables analysis of low-abundant metabolites and is therefore highly 
suited for miniaturized, high-throughput metabolite analysis Furthermore, it allows for efficient sample handling as well as pretreatment EE specifically 
targets ionic analytes and is therefore very suited for analysis of the metabolome, which comprises ±80% of charged/chargeable metabolite species 
Moreover, EE offers excellent possibilities for online integration in analytical platforms This lecture presents analysis of low-abundant metabolites with 
several analytical platforms in which EE is incorporated, ie continuous-flow micro-EE, three-phase EE and hyphenated EE techniques (EE-DI-MS, EE-LC-
MS and EE-CE-MS) A comparison between these platforms will be made and the great potential of EE-based strategies for enrichment of low-abundant 
metabolites and biomass-limited samples will be demonstrated

How to automate boring lipidomic extraction?
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Justine Bertrand-Michel, MetaToul-Lipidomic, France
CO-AUTHORS: Julia Soullier, Aurélie Batut, Jessica Dalloux-Chioccioli, Anthony Tournadre, Pauline Le Faouder
Lipids are ubiquitous biomolecules essential to all life, found in every cellular type, ranging from the human body and vegetal organisms, down to bacteria 
They have many different functions in cell structuration, energy storage and signalling so they are natural biomarkers for different diseases like cancer, 
cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disease, lung disease, their study and quantification are then crucial Mass spectrometry (MS) coupled with 
liquid chromatography or gas chromatography is mainly used for global and specific analysis of lipids But before their analysis, there is an important and 
time consuming step of sample preparation Due to their amphiphilic properties, there are usually two types of extractions: liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) and 
solid phase extraction (SPE) LLE and SPE are two very long protocols which are tedious when there are massive numbers of samples They can also be the 
source of many errors, considering the experimenter-dependant possible repeated artefacts To circumvent this point and increase the analytical service 
delivery,  a TECAN robot has been acquired by MetaToul-Lipidomic facility to automate the sample preparation Due to the specificity of lipid extraction, 
the robot needs a lot of optimization This presentation will show part of adaptation we had to perform to validate fatty acid, neutral lipid and phospholipid 
profiling That was related to the precision of solvent sampling which implies new adjustment accuracy for each of them, adding air gap, but also to modify 
the speed First lipidomic’s results obtained with a complete automated sample preparation will be presented for liver and plasma sample

Metabolomics: Central Approach for Study of the Exposome
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Dean Jones, Emory University, United States
CO-AUTHORS: Edward T. Morgan, Choon-Myung Lee, Grant Singer, Ken Liu, Shuzhao Li, Young-Mi Go, Gary W. Miller
Most human disease occurs through interactions of environmental exposures with an individual’s genome The exposome is defined globally to include 
dietary, pharmacologic, industrial and personal use products to which an individual is exposed Metabolomics methods are very powerful because 
they provide means to capture biologic responses to exposures In many cases, metabolomics also supports detection and quantification of xenobiotic 
chemicals and their metabolites This latter finding has allowed development of an analytical framework in which metabolomics connects external 
exposures, internal body burden of chemicals and their metabolites, biologic responses to exposure, and health and disease outcomes Examples of this 
central role of metabolomics in environmental health research will be provided in the presentation The talk will also summarize new efforts, as part of 
the Chemical Identification Discovery Cores of the US National Institutes of Health Common Fund Metabolomics Consortium, to identify large numbers 
of un-identified low abundance mass spectral signals found in biospecimens In this research, we are using xenobiotic detoxification enzymes to develop 
tools to rapidly generate and confirm identities of such xenobiotic metabolites We start with knowledge that about 80 xenobiotic transformation systems 
occur in mammals Prior knowledge of these systems allows creation of reconstituted cell-free systems for selective biotransformation reactions and 
also creation of stably transfected cell lines with over-expression of specific biotransformation systems By creating arrays of these biotransformation 
systems in a 96-well format, we have found that we can simultaneously generate a series of xenobiotic metabolites Because xenobiotic metabolites of 
each biotransformation reaction can be predicted, analysis of reaction products using liquid chromatography with high-resolution mass spectrometry and 
targeted MSn supports high-throughput xenobiotic metabolite identification Studies with well characterized xenobiotics with known metabolites establish 
the utility of the approach and also demonstrate generation of previously uncharacterized xenobiotic metabolites With creation of 384-well and 1536-well 
formats, we anticipate that the method can support mega-scale metabolite identification for large (>10,000) chemical libraries

Mitochondrial disorders (MDs) are inherited multi-organ diseases with variable phenotypes Inclusion body myositis (IBM), a sporadic inflammatory muscle 
disease, also shows mitochondrial dysfunction We investigated whether primary and secondary MDs modify metabolism to reveal pathogenic pathways 
and biomarkers We investigated metabolomes of 25 mitochondrial myopathy or ataxias patients, 16 unaffected carriers, six IBM and 15 non-mitochondrial 
neuromuscular disease (NMD) patients and 30 matched controls MD and IBM metabolomes clustered separately from controls and NMDs MDs and IBM 
showed transsulfuration pathway changes; creatine and niacinamide depletion marked NMDs, IBM and infantile-onset spinocerebellar ataxia (IOSCA) 
Low blood and muscle arginine was specific for patients with m3243A>G mutation A four-metabolite blood multi-biomarker (sorbitol, alanine, myoinositol, 
cystathionine) distinguished primary MDs from others (76% sensitivity, 95% specificity) Our omics approach identified pathways currently used to treat 
NMDs and mitochondrial stroke-like episodes and proposes nicotinamide riboside in MDs and IBM, and creatine in IOSCA and IBM as novel treatment 
targets The disease-specific metabolic fingerprints are valuable “multi-biomarkers” for diagnosis and promising tools for follow-up of disease progression 
and treatment effect

Boosting anti-doping screening through metabolomics
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Luca Narduzzi, Oniris – Laberca, France
CO-AUTHORS: Gaud Dervilly, Alexandre Marchand, Michel Audran, Bruno Le Bizec, Corinne Buisson
The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) prohibits the use of recombinant analogs of human hormones in any sport competition Nonetheless, their use 
is suspected to be widespread among professional athletes who intake hormones in micro-doses, to obtain mild but continuous anabolic effects while 
reducing the detectability window In particular, recombinant Growth Hormone (recGH) detection is very challenging: its turnover is within 24 hours after 
injection, with athletes’ age and hormonal profile as strong confounding factors  Any hormonal treatment on humans has, by principle, an impact on 
metabolism In this proof-of-principle study, applying LC-HRMS based metabolomics and lipidomics workflows on human bio-fluids (urine/plasma) we 
intended to trace indirectly recGH administration to (i) highlight specific patterns associated to treatment and (ii) investigate potential biomarkers The study 
included a cohort of 16 well-trained volunteers split in two equal groups administered with 1) micro-doses of erythropoietin (EPO) or 2) micro-doses of EPO 
+ recGH The two groups showed different metabolic profiles, especially in their plasma lipids The analysis also evidenced high intra-group variability, 
indicating a putative subject-specific effect of the hormones To solve this issue, we normalized the data versus the time 0, therefore we could evidence the 
subject-specific profile associated to the treatment while tracking longitudinally “what” and “when” has been taken Biomarkers identification highlighted 
several metabolic pathways affected by hormones intake, including triglycerides catabolism and amino-acids turnover On the contrary, WADA-approved 
recGH tests were not able to individuate recGH intake Metabolomics seems to be a promising tool to screen for illicit recGH administration

PRESENTING AUTHOR: Guowang Xu, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China
CO-AUTHORS: Wangjie Lv, Lichao Wang, Qiuhui Xuan, Qingqing Wang, Xinjie Zhao, Chunxiu Hu, Xianzhe Shi, Xinyu Liu
Metabolomics is the science of studying endogenous small molecular metabolites It has been developed since the end of last century and has made 
great progress in the fields of diseases, pharmaceuticals, agriculture, environment, etc The most typical method is non-target method, it is hoped that 
“all” metabolites can be panoramically analyzed without bias At this moment, thousands to tens of thousands of features can be obtained by ultra 
high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)-mass spectrometry (MS), and hundreds of metabolites can be identified Because of the complexity 
of metabolome, it is far from meeting the needs of systems biology research It would be much better if we could increase the number of metabolites 
detected quantitatively to nearly 2,000 From an economic point of view, of course, the fewer methods the better In view of this, this study focuses on how 
to develop novel LC-MS-based analytical methods for the quantitative detection of more than 1,000 metabolites Following three scientific problems are 
covered, 1 Analytical peak capacity extending by using two-dimensional LC; 2 Quantitative ion-pair selection by using the computational metabolomics 
algorithm and SWAT method; 3 Metabolic profiling annotation and peak identification by studying structure-retention and structure- fragment relationships 
under the assistance of standard samples and Internet databases Through the above measures, we have established a novel metabolomics method to 
quantitatively analyze more than 1,000 metabolites in biological samples (body fluid, tissue and cells) This report will show the latest results of this study

Post-mortem changes in the metabolomic profiles of animal and human tissues
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Ekaterina Zelentsova, International Tomography Center SB RAS, Novosibirsk, Russia; Novosibirsk State University,  
Russian Federation
CO-AUTHORS: Lyudmila Yanshole, Vadim Yanshole, Olga Snytnikova, Yuri Tsentalovich
The analysis of post-mortem metabolomic changes in biological fluids opens the way to develop new methods for the estimation of post-mortem 
interval (PMI) which appears to be an actual problem in forensic medicine Also, for humans, autopsy materials are often used as control tissues due 
to the inaccessibility of the tissues of a healthy patient (brain, eye tissues and others) For the correct use, a detailed description of the changes in the 
metabolomic content of autopsy tissues should be investigated The combination of modern research methods - high frequency 1H NMR and high-
resolution LC–MS – was used in this work The quantitative levels of 61 metabolites in the rabbit and human serum, aqueous and vitreous humors (AH, 
VH) at different PMIs have been measured The obtained results indicate the advantage of ocular fluids, AH and VH, over blood serum for the search 
of biochemical markers for the PMI estimation: the post-mortem metabolomic changes in the ocular fluids proceed slower than in blood, and the data 
scattering is lower These changes are governed by two major factors: the degradation of the ocular tissues and the diffusion of metabolites from the body 
vascular systems into ocular fluids Among the metabolites whose concentrations increase with time, the most significant and linear growth is found for 
glycerol (rabbit), betaine (human), and hypoxanthine, choline (both) The high potential of choline, glycerol and betaine as biomarkers for the PMI estimation 
is revealed in the present work for the first time Supported by RFBR (Projects №18-34-00137, 19-34-80008)

Vitamin D is an important regulator of the immune system and low vitamin D levels are associated with a multitude of immunological disorders 
encompassing a broad range of diseases The agnostic approach of untargeted metabolomics offers the opportunity to comprehensively examine 
changes in the metabolic profile associated with variations in vitamin D levels The current study included the children who participated in Vitamin D 
Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial, for whom plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and plasma metabolomics profiles were available at age 1 (n=451) 
and age 3 (n=407) years Metabolomic profiling was conducted using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry 
After quality control, 624 known metabolites remained We assessed the associations between individual metabolites and 25(OH)D level using linear 
regression adjusting for potential confounders After correction for multiple comparisons, seven metabolites were significantly associated with 25(OH)
D levels at both age 1 and age 3, including decreased concentrations of three members of the n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-6PUFA) metabolism 
pathway [linoleate(18:2), arachidonate(20:4), and docosapentaenoate(22:5)] These n-6PUFA-metabolite-25(OH)D associations were replicated in older 
children from the Childhood Asthma Management Program(p<005) This analysis is the first to characterize the metabolic profile associated with 25(OH)
D levels at two time points in early life, with replication in an independent population The association between increased 25(OH)D levels and decreased 
concentrations of multiple n-6PUFA metabolites is important as both are involved in inflammatory processes, and evidence from cell and animal studies 
has demonstrated plausible biological mechanisms where the active form of vitamin D may influence n-6PUFA metabolism

Comprehensive metabolomic and immulogical profiling of Asthma COPD Overlap (ACO)
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Nilanjana Ghosh, School of Medical Science and Technology, India
CO-AUTHORS: Priyanka Choudhury, Sushmita Roy Chowdhury, Rintu Banerjee, Parthasarathi Bhattacharyya, Koel Chaudhury
Asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) overlap, termed as ACO, is a complex heterogeneous disease without any clear diagnostic or 
therapeutic guidelines The pathophysiology of the disease, its characteristic features and existence as a unique disease entity remain unclear The 
present study aims to determine whether ACO has a distinct metabolic and immunological mediator profile in comparison to asthma and COPD The 
study was conducted on two different patient groups, the discovery and validation cohort The discovery phase patient cohort consisted of (i) controls= 
33 (ii) asthma=34 (iii) COPD=30 and (iv) ACO=35 For the validation phase (i) asthma=32 (iii) COPD=32 and (iv) ACO=40 were considered Serum and 
exhaled breath condensates (EBC) were collected from all the subjects and characterized using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry and gas 
chromatography mass spectrometry (GC MS) based metabolomics The immunological mediator profiling (Th1, Th2, Th17 cytokines and soluble immune 
mediators) was assessed using quantikine ELISA kits and magnetic bead based multiplexing assays Multivariate and univariate analysis of NMR and MS 
metabolomics of combined serum and EBC profiles indicated dysregulated metabolites in ACO patients when compared with both asthma and COPD, 
followed by validation in a fresh cohort of patients Our findings suggest that ACO has an enhanced energy and metabolic burden associated when 
compared to asthma and COPD ACO also exhibits altered inflammatory and immune profiles than any of the parent diseases It is anticipated that our 
results will stimulate researchers to further explore ACO and unravel the pathophysiological complexities associated with the disease

Several prenatal and perinatal factors have been implicated in the development of childhood asthma, including maternal smoking, diet, and pregnancy 
complications The maternal metabolome during pregnancy may therefore provide valuable mechanistic insights and novel hypotheses in asthma 
pathophysiology This analysis included non-smoking pregnant women and their children who participated in VDAART, a randomized placebo-controlled 
trial to determine the effect of prenatal vitamin D supplementation on offspring asthma (ClinicalTrialsgov identifier: NCT00920621) Asthma outcomes 
were defined as physician-diagnosed asthma or recurrent wheezing by age 3 and 6 years Metabolomic profiling in 775 mothers at 10-18 weeks gestation 
was conducted using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry After quality control 734 known metabolites remained 
We assessed the prospective associations between individual maternal plasma metabolites and childhood asthma/wheezing using multivariable logistic 
regression models In 719 mother-child pairs, top maternal metabolites associated with asthma/wheezing by age 3 were 2-aminoadipate (P-value=891e-4), 
tyramine O-sulfate (P-value=105e-3), and vanillactate (P-value=302e-3) Vanillactate and 2-aminoadipate were also associated with asthma/wheezing by 
age 6 (n=775, P-values=235e-3, 407e-3) Among 25 and 18 metabolites associated with asthma/wheezing by age 3 and 6 respectively (P-value<005), 
thyroxine, 3-methylcatechol sulfate, and theophylline were also common 2-aminoadipate and thyroxine had positive, while others demonstrated inverse 
relations with the outcomes We identified several prenatal metabolites associated with childhood asthma/wheezing Previously linked to diabetes and 
atherosclerosis, 2-aminoadipate is a lysine oxidation product by myeloperoxidase in inflammation Theophylline, a caffeine metabolite and known asthma 
therapy, has bronchodilatory and anti-inflammatory effects Validation in similarly-designed independent cohorts is needed to confirm these associations

The model organism Caenorhabditis elegans develops in ideal conditions through six distinct developmental stages over its approximately three-day 
life cycle Under unfavorable conditions, it can enter an alternative developmental stage called dauer, which can persist for months and is specialized 
for dispersal to a more optimal environment Each developmental stage is unique in terms of gene expression, cell number, cuticle structure, and 
metabolism Methods are available to synchronize cultures in order to isolate stage-specific nematodes, but these methods are time-consuming and 
add extra steps with harsh conditions that can potentially disrupt normal development Furthermore, synchronization complicates large-scale discovery 
metabolomics, as the choices are to either focus on one specific stage or perform a synchronization step for each given life-cycle stage thereby 
increasing handling time We are using both natural diversity and targeted genetic mutations in C elegans for a large-scale NIH Common Fund project 
to identify unknown metabolites enabled by genetics and quantum chemistry In an attempt to enable experiments on mixed stage populations, we are 
developing methods that will deconvolve mixtures in both LC-MS and NMR data by leveraging a series of stage specific and mixed stage experiments 
Our approach would allow us to identify C elegans developmental stages within a mixed-stage population using a large-particle flow cytometer Each 
stage can then be associated with LC-MS or NMR features or vice versa We will present progress on this approach using the N2 reference strain and 
discuss how it can be extended to other genotypes
