As discussed in #1549, utils.check_arrays() does not check the shape or ndim
of input arrays. However, the docstring suggests that it should: "Checks
whether all objects in arrays have the same shape or length."
To me, I think what we need is to break check_arrays() into several sub-
functions or maybe a class:
  1. Check sparse / dense
  2. Check dtype
  3. Check first dimension
  4. Check all dimensions
