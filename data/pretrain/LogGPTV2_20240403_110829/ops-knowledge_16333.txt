User: I have made a program that takes infrared values serially, transmits them them to another program(the one im having trouble with), and uses the win32 python api to react to a matched value. It all works, but I need this program to run on the startup of my computer.
It uses the IDLE python shell to run, and I need to open/run the file directly from that program. Is there any way to do this? I can't just put a shortcut into the startup directory because its an unrecognized file, and it needs to be run, not just opened. Any help would be great, thanks!
Assistant: Create a batch file with the line start C:\python27\python.exe D:your_program_location\your_program.py'

Drag the batch file from desktop to "Start - All Programs - Startup". That should do the trick.
