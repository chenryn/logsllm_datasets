User: I wrote a program that uses the console.  Most of the time, the user must see the console informations.  For a specific function from command line, I would like to run the script without the console rises. I just don't want see the window but it can be in the task bar. I know I can use extra modules (gui, win32,..) to do that but I would like to use the standard python librairy.  
Is it possible to do that?
The program should run on Windows. (python 2.7)
I specify... I know I can use pythonw.exe too. The question then is how to launch the same script with python.exe sometimes and with pythonw.exe (from command line) for a specific function?
Assistant: on windows there are two python executables in your installation, one is "python.exe", which is the one you typically use. There is another called "pythonw.exe" which is for gui programs. It works just like python.exe, but does not display a console at all.
