It'd be really useful to be able to convert a .png image to a .jpg at the same
time I'm resizing it.
For example, I've been sent a bunch of .png files that I want to stick on a
website. Currently, I'm loading them in to PhotoShop, resizing and exporting
as JPEGs. It'd save me so much time if I could just right-click > 'Resize
pictures', choose the fit dimensions and the output format.
Loving that you've brought PowerToys back! thanks for all the hard work, it's
really appreciated.
