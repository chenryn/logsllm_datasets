### 4.2.1 Change Patterns in Core Routers

Figure 6 illustrates the number of configuration changes made to each router per month for both the GT and UW networks. The core routers, which are identified by their device names and aligned on the left side of the figures (device IDs 0-5), exhibit a significantly higher number of changes compared to non-core routers. This pattern is particularly evident in the UW network, as shown in Figure 6b. The majority of these changes are concentrated in the L1 (Layer 1) and VLAN stanzas.

This analysis highlights that the frequency and type of configuration changes can vary depending on the router's function and its placement within the network. Different design and operational practices in the two networks result in distinct change patterns.

### 4.2.2 Longitudinal Analysis

Network expansion leads to a steady increase in configuration size. Figures 7a and 7d depict the changes in the number of configuration lines over time for each router function. The overall number of lines in UW routers shows a gradual increase, while it remains relatively stable for GT routers. This growth is primarily due to the addition of new devices to the network, as illustrated in Figures 7c and 7f.

For the GT network, the number of core routers, nodes, and other devices has grown slowly over the past five years. In 2007, there were 7 core routers, 10 nodes, and 6 miscellaneous devices. By 2010, this had increased to 9 core routers, 12 nodes, 4 radial and hot spares, 1 VPN router, and several access routers. A significant period of growth occurred around July 2008, leading to a substantial increase in L2 configurations, as shown in Figure 7a. This growth was associated with the expansion of the "resnet" network in GT.

In the UW network, the number of VLAN and L3 lines for the median device generally decreases over time as new devices are added. This is because newly added devices typically have fewer lines with these functionalities. However, from January 2008 to June 2008, there was a growth in VLAN and L3 configurations. This can be attributed to the steady addition of VLANs and the introduction of multicast-related configurations and new filters, resulting in a sharp increase in L3 and ACL configuration lines.

Overall, various network-wide factors contribute to configuration changes, including network expansion, the addition of new features, and the modification of existing ones. No single factor appears to be the dominant reason for configuration changes, although the impact of network expansion and feature modifications is more frequent.

### 4.2.3 Correlation Analysis

We examined the extent to which changes to certain configuration constructs are correlated with others. For high-level operational tasks, operators often need to modify multiple stanzas simultaneously. We found that 13% and 10% of all change events in the UW and GT networks, respectively, involve two or more stanza types. This correlation has implications for the design of configuration management and debugging tools.

Table 6 lists the five most common types of correlated stanza changes:
- **L1 and VLAN**: Routers control reachability through VLANs, leading to frequent changes.
- **L1 and ACL**: Changes to networks (L1) often require corresponding changes to access control lists to ensure consistency.
- **L1 and L3**: Modifying interfaces and subnets in routing stanzas allows for the redistribution of reachability information.
- **L1 and L2** (GT): These changes occur when defining interfaces and setting spanning-tree protocols.
- **L1, L2, and L3** (UW): These changes happen when adding interfaces, modifying the spanning tree, and changing the routing protocol.

### 4.3 Firewalls

Firewalls primarily perform access control, and as expected, most configuration changes are concentrated on ACL statements (Figures 8c and 8d). Our analysis focuses on how firewalls are used in the respective campuses and the similarities and differences in their usage. Despite the specialized nature of firewalls, their usage across the two campuses is similar (Figures 8 and 10).

#### 4.3.1 Snapshot and Change Analysis

The change characteristics are similar between the two campuses. Figures 8a and 8b show the static analysis of the latest firewall configuration snapshot, with most of the configuration dedicated to access control. This characteristic holds for changes as well, as shown in Figures 8c and 8d. Most changes are related to access control, while other types are mostly insignificant. The high similarity in snapshot and change analysis between the two campus networks is intriguing and likely results from the specific functionality provided by firewalls.

#### 4.3.2 Deployment Location Matters

Figure 9 shows the top 30 firewall devices sorted by the number of stanza changes per month. Changes are heavily concentrated on ACL stanzas, with a few firewalls experiencing many more changes than others. Upon closer examination, we find that the top firewalls in the GT network (Figure 9a) are located near the border and are physical devices where multiple virtual firewall instances spawn. All changes to the virtual firewalls are reflected on these border firewalls, leading to a higher number of changes. This is also true for the UW network. Additionally, we observed a practice in the GT network where... [Continue with the rest of the text if needed]
