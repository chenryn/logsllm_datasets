User: I try to save a python script as a shortcut that I want to run. It opens it but then closes right away.
I know why it is doing this, it is opening my windows command line in python3.2 the script is in python 2.7
I need both version on my PC, my question is how to I change the cmd default.
I have tried to "open with" shortcut on the icon and it just continues to default to 3.2.
Help please
Assistant: Install both pythons, and change the path in Windows, by default both Pythons will be PATH=c:\python\python 2.7 and PATH=c:\python\python 3.2 Or something like that. What and since windows stops as soon as it finds the first python, what you could do is have one called PATH=c:\python27\ and another PATH=c:\python32\ this way you can run both of them.
