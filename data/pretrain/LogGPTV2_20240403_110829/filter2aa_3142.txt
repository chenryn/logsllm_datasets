# Dark Data: An Investigation by Svea Eckert and Andreas Dewes

## Who We Are
- **Svea Eckert**: Journalist at NDR/ARD
  - Twitter: [@sveckert](https://twitter.com/sveckert)
  - Contact: @japh44
- **Andreas Dewes**: Data Scientist

## Why We Are Here
On March 23, 2017, the U.S. Senate voted to eliminate broadband privacy rules that would have required Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to obtain explicit consent from consumers before selling or sharing their web browsing data. This decision has significant implications for user privacy.

## What Does This Mean?
This means that ISPs can now sell your browsing data without your explicit consent, potentially exposing sensitive information about your online activities.

### Example
- **ARD, Panorama, November 3, 2016**:
  - "You can see everything – S*#t!"
  - "I don’t know why I was searching for 'Tebonin' at that time."
  - "It’s really bad to see something like this, especially if it is connected with my own name."

### Affected Individuals
- Members of parliament and their employees
- Employee of Helge Braun, CDU – Assistant Secretary of the German Chancellor

## How We Did It: The "Hacking" Part
We used social engineering techniques to gain access to a large dataset of browsing data.

### Discoveries
- 14 days of live access
- 3 million German user IDs
- Browsing data for one month

### Example Request
```plaintext
Dear Sir/Madam,

In the context of an ongoing investigation into computer fraud (file number), I need information on the following IP address: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx. Timestamp: xx.xx.2016, 10:05:31 CEST.

The data is needed to identify the offender. Please send your response by email to PI:EMAIL or by fax.

Sincerely,
[First Name] [Last Name]
Detective Chief, [Place of County]
Cybercrime
[Phone Number]
```

## Where Do I Find Tilde on My Keyboard?
- The tilde (~) key is usually located in the top-left corner of the keyboard, often shared with the backtick (`) key.

## What is IP 127.0.0.1?
- IP 127.0.0.1 is the loopback address, which refers to the local machine.

## Who Did This?
- Browser plugins, specifically suspected to be WOT (Web of Trust).

### Testing
- Conducted in a virtual machine
- Uninstalled add-ons
- Analyzed browser history and plugin behavior

## How Does Deanonymization Work?
### Instant Deanonymization via Unique URL
- Using unique URLs to instantly identify users.

### Combinatorial Deanonymization
- Combining anonymized user data with public/external personal data to re-identify individuals.

### Example: Netflix Data vs. IMDB Data
- Provided anonymized ratings associated with user names/real names.
- Our dataset:
  - 3,000,000,000 URLs (insufficiently anonymized)
  - 9,000,000 domains
  - 3,000,000 users

### Frequency Analysis of Domains
- Removing everything but the domain and user ID.
- Investigating how easy it is to re-identify a user given their domain data.
- Only looking at users who visited at least ten domains.

### User Categorization
- Generating a user/domain matrix \( M \).
- Generating a vector \( v \) with information about visited domains.
- Multiplying \( M \cdot v \).
- Finding the best match using \( \text{argmax} (w) \).

### How Unique Am I?
- Top-200 domains are sufficient to identify a large fraction of users.

### Public Information Extraction
- **Twitter**: Using the Twitter API to download tweets, extracting URLs, and feeding domain information into our algorithm.
- **YouTube**: Downloading public playlists, extracting video IDs, and feeding full URLs into our algorithm.
- **Google Maps**: Extracting geo-data from Google Maps URLs and combining it with publicly available ratings and photos.

### Can I Hide in My Data by Generating Noise?
- Usually not, as \( \text{argmax} ||M \cdot v|| \) is robust against isolated (additive) perturbation.

### Why Use Extensions for Tracking?
- 95% of the data comes from only 10 extensions.
- Many more extensions are spying on their users but have a small installation base.
- Up to 10,000 extension versions affected (upper bound analysis via extension ID).

### Behavior Analysis of Chrome Extensions
- Using Selenium Webdriver and Docker to analyze suspicious behavior.
- Number of requests made by each extension.

### (How) Can I Protect Myself?
- **Rotating Proxy Servers**: e.g., TOR or a VPN with rotating exit nodes.
- **Client-Side Blocking of Trackers**

## Takeaways
- Often, only a few external data points (<10) are sufficient to uniquely identify a person.
- The increase in publicly available information makes de-anonymization via linkage attacks easier than ever before.
- High-dimensional, user-related data is extremely difficult to robustly anonymize, even with the best intentions.
