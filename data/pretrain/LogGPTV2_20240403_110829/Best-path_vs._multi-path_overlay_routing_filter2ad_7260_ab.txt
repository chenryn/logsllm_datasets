### Probes and Routing Methods

- **Direct**: A single packet using the direct Internet path.
- **Loss**: Probe-based reactive routing that attempts to minimize loss. Requires only probing overhead.
- **Latency (Lat)**: Probe-based reactive routing that minimizes latency and avoids completely failed links.
- **Direct rand**: 2-redundant mesh routing, with no probing overhead. One copy of each packet is transmitted on the direct Internet path; the second over a random indirect overlay path. There is no delay between the packet transmissions. The first packet is used to predict the behavior of direct packets.
- **Lat loss**: Probe-based 2-redundant multi-path routing. This combination aims to achieve the best of both worlds by sending the first copy of each packet over a path selected to minimize loss and the second over a path selected to minimize latency. It also helps infer the lat packet.
- **Direct direct**: 2-redundant routing with back-to-back packets on the same path.
- **DD 10 ms**: 2-redundant routing with a 10ms gap between packets on the same path.
- **DD 20 ms**: 2-redundant routing with a 20ms gap between packets on the same path.

### Types of Routes Between Measurement Nodes

- **Loss**: Loss-optimized path via probing.
- **Latency (Lat)**: Latency-optimized path via probing.
- **Direct**: Direct Internet path.
- **Rand**: Indirectly through a random node.

**Table 4: The types of routes between measurement nodes.**

### Key Findings

1. **Dependent Losses on Alternate Paths**: If a packet sent directly from a source to a destination is lost, there is a 60% chance that a packet sent via a random intermediate will also be lost.
2. **Low Average Internet Loss Rate**: The average Internet loss rate is low (0.42%), but individual paths at specific times can have high loss rates.
3. **Improved Latency with Mesh Routing**: Mesh routing reduces the loss rate from 0.42% to 0.26%, reducing retransmission and timeout latency. Overall, it reduces packet latency by an average of 3 ms, with a 20 ms reduction on 2% of the paths.
4. **Path Selection Enhances Mesh Routing**: Using probe-based routing reduces the conditional loss probability to 55% for the second packet, indicating that better path selection methods can improve mesh routing performance.

### Methodology

Each node periodically initiates probes to other nodes. A probe consists of one or two request packets from the initiator to the target. The nodes cycle through different probe types, selecting a random destination node for each probe. After sending the probe, the host waits for a random amount of time between 0.6 and 1.2 seconds before repeating the process.

Each probe has a unique 64-bit identifier, which is logged along with the send and receive times. This allows us to compute one-way reachability between hosts. Most hosts have GPS-synchronized clocks, and we average one-way latency summaries and differences with those on the reverse path to mitigate timekeeping errors. Each probing host periodically pushes its logs to a central monitoring machine for aggregation. We consider a host to have failed if it stops sending probes for more than 90 seconds, and we disregard probes lost due to host failure. Our numbers reflect network failures while hosts are running.

### Base Network Statistics

The paths we measured had relatively low loss rates, ranging from 0% on many Internet2 or very fast connections to about 6% between Korea and a DSL line in the United States. The overall loss rate observed in 2003 was 0.42%, reduced from an earlier 0.74%. These changes may reflect topological changes in our testbed and underlying loss rates.

Most of the time, the 20-minute average loss rates were close to zero. Over 95% of the samples had a 0% loss rate. During the worst one-hour period, the average loss rate on our testbed was over 13%.

### Effects on Loss Rate

Using probe data to select better paths can reduce loss from 0.42% to 0.33%, with minimal impact on latency. Random mesh routing can reduce the loss rate by almost 40% and latency by a few milliseconds. Sending two packets back-to-back on the same path, especially with a 10 ms delay, results in similar loss improvements as random mesh routing. Combining path selection with mesh routing further improves performance.

These results suggest that mesh routing's packet redundancy is effective at masking transient congestion-triggered loss, possibly by de-correlating losses through temporal shifting. In contrast, probe-based reactive routing avoids paths with longer-term issues. Combining these approaches, albeit with high overhead, can reduce losses by 45% and latency by 13%.
