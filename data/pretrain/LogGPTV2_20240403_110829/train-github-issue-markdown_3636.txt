# Environment
- **Windows Build Number:** Windows [Version 10.0.18363.900]
- **PowerToys Version:** 18.2 (all versions affected)
- **PowerToy Module Affected (if applicable):** General Settings / Run at Startup

# Description
We are operating a non-persistent VDI environment using Citrix Provisioning Server and Microsoft FSLogix Profile Management. When a user configures PowerToys to start automatically and then logs off the machine, PowerToys does not start up at the next logon.

### Reason:
When a user sets PowerToys to start automatically, a scheduled task is created for that specific user to run at logon. However, these tasks are tied to the machine on which they were created. As a result, when the user logs into the VDI environment again, the scheduled task does not roam with the user profile, and PowerToys does not start automatically.

# Steps to Reproduce
1. Set PowerToys to automatically start and click "Save" on a machine with profile management.
2. Log off from that machine.
3. Log on to another machine with profile management.

# Expected Behavior
- PowerToys should automatically start upon logon.

# Actual Behavior
- PowerToys does not automatically start upon logon.

# Suggested Solution
Instead of creating a scheduled task to automatically run PowerToys, use one of the following methods to ensure it starts with the user profile:

1. **Startup Folder:**
   - Create a shortcut to PowerToys in the user's startup folder:
     ```
     %AppData%\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup
     ```

2. **Registry Key:**
   - Add an entry to the registry to start PowerToys at logon:
     ```
     HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
     ```
   - Value Name: `PowerToys`
   - Value Data: Path to the PowerToys executable (e.g., `C:\Path\To\PowerToys.exe`)

This approach ensures that the startup configuration roams with the user profile, allowing PowerToys to start automatically on any machine in the VDI environment.
