# Environment
Windows build number: Windows [Version 10.0.18363.900]  
PowerToys version: 18.2 / all versions affected  
PowerToy module for which you are reporting the bug (if applicable):  
General Settings / Run at startup
# Description
We are running a nonpersistent VDI environment with Citrix Provisioning Server
and Microsoft FSLogix Profile management. When a user sets powetoys to
automatically startup and then logs off from the machine, powertoys will not
startup at next logon.  
Reason: When a users sets powertoys to automatically startup, a scheduled task
is created for that user to run at logon. Unfortunately tasks are specific to
the machine it is created on. So when the user logs on to the VDI environment
again, there is not such a task and powertoys will not fire up as that
scheduled task did not roam.
# Steps to reproduce
Set Powertoys to automatically startup and click save on a machine with
profile management  
Logoff from that machine.  
Logon to another machine with profile management.
# Expected behavior
Powertoys will automatically startup
# Actual behavior
Powertoys does not automatically startup.
# My Suggestion to solve that issue:
Instead of creating a scheduled task to automatically run powertoys, use a
link in "%AppData%\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup"  
or a reg key:  
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
