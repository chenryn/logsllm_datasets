this problem and I'm a relatively experienced user of the site and ES itself)

bypass official ES documentation)
I wrote https://github.com/bitemyapp/bloodhound partly because I was having a
hell of a time generating valid Elasticsearch requests without lots of copy-
paste and templating.
The docs have not been improved much in the last couple years other than when
you did the big site change.
It's extremely hard for a new user of Elasticsearch to get a bird's eye view.
I brought up Bloodhound when I first released it as a way to possibly start a
proper spec of what Elasticsearch accepts as a valid request and what it does
not. I'd like to revive the idea of having a spec so that users and client
implementors don't have to keep rediscovering how Elasticsearch works through
haphazard experimentation.
Back when I was implementing Bloodhound I asked if there was a spec. I was
told there wasn't one. I was briefly hopeful when I saw there was a Thrift
spec...but it passes off the actual document structure as a JSON blob, lending
no useful information.
Please at least consider having a spec for the API.
