titleblackhat:us-21 I&#39;m a Hacker Get Me Out of Here! Breaking Network Segregation Using Esoteric Command &#38; Control Channels
This talk will explore the weaponization of esoteric internal command and control (C2) channels and their use for lateral movement. James, an attack simulation consultant with F-Secure Consulting, will demonstrate some novel and reimagined techniques for breaking out of heavily segregated environments. In particular, the following will be explored, along with the tools that James has developed to make these usable operationally:- C2 into VMs through vCenter and Guest Additions- C2 using arbitrary network printers and print jobs- C2 over Remote Desktop mapped drives and file shares - C2 using LDAP attributes For the red teamers, James will share how to identify and exploit these channels, and the OpSec considerations behind each. He will also share the tools that he's developed to interface with popular C2 frameworks such as Cobalt Strike and C3, providing operators with a seamless C2 experience.For the blue teamers, James will explore the detection artifacts created when using these tools, and will present use cases to consider implementing. He will also challenge defenders' assumptions about how sophisticated actors may operate within segregated environments, and how commonly accepted boundary systems and technologies may offer a means for actors to progress unimpeded into organizations' most sensitive network zones.
