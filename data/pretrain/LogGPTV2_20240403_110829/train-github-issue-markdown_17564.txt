Sparse matrices are a valuable data structure for representing graphs or edge-only meshes. However, using the `float` data type is inefficient when only boolean information is needed, as it consumes more memory than necessary. Therefore, extending the module to support additional data types, such as `bool`, and potentially `int8`, `int16`, and `int32`, would be highly beneficial.

I am willing to contribute to the development of this feature.
