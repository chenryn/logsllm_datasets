**Migrated issue, originally created by Anonymous**
using cast and INTERVAL seems to cause a problem: (note this code is corrupted
by an issue tracker migration some years ago)
    import sqlalchemy as sa
    import sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql as sa_pg
    s1 = sa.select([week ago', sa_pg.DATE)](sa.cast('1))
    print s1
    s2 = sa.select([seconds', sa_pg.INTERVAL)](sa.cast('100))
    print s2
    AttributeError: 'GenericTypeCompiler' object has no attribute 'visit_INTERVAL'
The DATE cast works fine.  
The INTERVAL cast fails.
