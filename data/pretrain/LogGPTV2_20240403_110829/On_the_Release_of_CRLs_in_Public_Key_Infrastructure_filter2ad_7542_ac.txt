5.1.3 Second Case: Overlap of Certiﬁcates with dif-
ferent Issued Ages
In the ﬁrst case, we assume that CA issues a ﬁxed number
of certiﬁcates at different time, but each time it is the
same type of certiﬁcates that issued with the same issued
age. Now we relax these assumptions to a more general
case by assuming that at any point of time CA can issue
two types of certiﬁcates with different issued ages β1 and
β2, where β2 > β1. We assume that these two types are
independent of each other. Under these assumptions, we
compute the new F (v) and P (v) in different intervals of
(0, β1], (β1, β2], and (β2, +∞) correspondingly.
We overlap two types of certiﬁcates with the distribu-
tion functions R1(t) = k1e−k1t and R2(t) = k2e−k2t.
At the same time, each type of certiﬁcates is composed
of generations of different certiﬁcates issued at different
time.
the daily CRL size F (v) is a cumulative number of the
revocations of two types of certiﬁcates. For any time v ∈
(0, β1], we have
F (v) =
f1(t) +
f2(t)
(9)
vX
vX
t=1
t=1
In the interval (β1, β2], the size of CRL for the certiﬁ-
cates whose issued age is β1 has become stable and the
value of F1(v) will be constant, while that for the certiﬁ-
cates whose issued age is β2 keeps increasing. For any
v ∈ (β1, β2], we have
F (v) = F1(β1) +
vX
t=1
f2(t)
(10)
In the interval (β2, +∞), both CRLs become stable,
and thus
F (v) = F1(β1) + F2(β2)
(11)
Figure 8 shows the graph of the cumulative numbers
of valid certiﬁcate revocations in (0, +∞) for the case
k1 = 0.26, β1 = 36, k2 = 1, β2 = 72, α1 = 2000,
α2 = 1000, b1 = 10%, and b2 = 10%.

5.1.4 Third Case: Simulation in the Case of Poisson
Distribution
In our ﬁrst case, we assume that CA issues a ﬁxed num-
ber of certiﬁcates at different time. A more general case
is that CA issues α certiﬁcates, where α is a random
number following a Poisson distribution with parame-
ter µ. For this case, the average number of revocation
requests per interval is µ. The probability that there
are x revocation requests occurred in each interval is
. Because the explicit forms of f (v) and
Pµ(x) = µxe−µ
F (v) are messy, we uses simulation to get some insights.
We conducted our simulation on a HP 1940 PC (with
Pentium 4 CPU and 1.00GB RAM) using Visual C++.
We follow the steps below in our simulation:
x!
1. Firstly, generate a sequence of random number α1,
α2, α3, . . . , αm based on the value of µ.
2. Secondly, compute the total number of new revo-
cations on daily basis between 1 and 2β, which is
f (v).
3. Thirdly, compute the valid cumulative number of re-
voked certiﬁcates from day 1 to day 2β, which is
F (v).
4. At last, generate different groups of random num-
bers for α, repeat step 1 to step 4 for twenty times.
Figure 10 shows a typical case for daily numbers
of new certiﬁcate revocations with Poisson distribution
when β = 360 and k = 0.26. The number of new cer-
tiﬁcate revocations increases sharply to about 90 within a
very short period of time after the certiﬁcates get issued.
Instead of becoming stable as in case 1 and case 2, the
curve ﬂuctuates around 90 after a short period of time.
The oscillation is driven by the randomness introduced
by using Poisson distribution.
Figure 11 shows that F (v) continues increasing from
1 to β, where β = 360. After β, it begins to ﬂuctu-
ate. In a actual business environment, a typical issued
age β is 360 days, which is much bigger than ∆t.
In
such a case, the stable value of λ in Figure 11 is so large
that it dominates the ﬂuctuation introduced by Poisson.
Consequently, the curve is very smooth after β. This is
consistent to the case 1 when we assume a ﬁxed number
of certiﬁcates issued at any point of time. When CA de-
cides how often CRL should be released, it mostly cares
about the distribution of F (v). Because of the existence
of the similarity between the ﬁxed number case and the
Poisson distribution case for the F (v) distribution, later
for our economic analysis, we will focus on the ﬁxed
number case.

5.2 Analytical Model: How Often Should
CA Release CRLs
The key research question in our paper is to give a pre-
scription to CA to decide how often it should release its
CRLs. In order to answer that question, CA must know
the distribution of new certiﬁcate revocation f (v) and the
distribution of certiﬁcate revocation list F (v). CA needs
to balance the liability cost of not releasing CRL on time
and the ﬁxed and variable costs of releasing CRL too of-
ten. So the goal for CA is to minimize the overall op-
erational cost. Because the behaviors of f (v) and F (v)
when time t is greater than the issued age β are different

from those when time t is smaller than β, we analyze the
optimal strategies for CA for these two cases separately.
For each case we assume a monopoly case so that there
is no competition between CAs, and that the certiﬁcates
are homogeneous in terms of risk, cost, and revocation
probability. Also, different types of certiﬁcates are inde-
pendent from each other. CA will get an optimal CRL
releasing strategy for each type of certiﬁcates based on
properties of the certiﬁcates.
5.2.1 Optimal Releasing Strategy When Time is
Greater Than β
When time is greater than β, CA has run certiﬁcate ser-
vices for at lease one issued age for that type of certiﬁ-
cates. We will use the following variables in our analysis
(the numbers in parentheses are the default values used
in our computation).
• β: The issued age of one type of CRL. (β = 360)
• c: The estimated number of days between two CRL
releasing dates. This is the decision variable that
CA needs to optimize.
• θ: Estimated numbers of certiﬁcates in a CRL on
a given day after issued age β if CA decides to
release CRLs on that day. According to case 1,
1−e−k ). (θ = 32, 000,
θ = F (β) = α·b%·k·e−k
k = 0.26, and β = 360)
(β − e−k
1−e−k
• F C: The ﬁxed cost for CA to publish one CRL
.(F C = $10, 000)
• V C: The variable cost for CA to include each in-
dividual certiﬁcate into a CRL. We assume the VC
does not changed with the length of CRL. (V C =
$1)
• Υ: The expected liability cost per certiﬁcate revo-
cation if CA delay publishing the revocation for
one day. Therefore, the risk of delaying publish-
ing a CRL of θ certiﬁcate revocations for n day
is Υ · θ · n. If we assume that for the whole pe-
riod of β, the expected liability cost that CA pays
for the accident caused by the delay of publish-
ing CRLs is Qm; (i.e.,Qm = $100, 000), then
Υ = Qm/(θ ∗ β) = $0.0087 for θ = 32, 000 and
β = 360.
• a: Recency requirement set up by the customers.
It is the max number of days between two succes-
sive CRL releasing dates that is acceptable by cus-
tomers. (a = 50days)
Because f (v) and F (v) are stable after β, CA can take
either a ﬁxed interval strategy or a ﬁxed CRL size strat-
egy for releasing CRL. Fundamentally these two strate-
gies are inter-exchangeable. For simplicity reason, we
present the solution for the ﬁxed interval strategy.
If CA releases one CRL every c days, the total cost for
CA within period β is

In order for L · (c − a) = 0 to hold, it is required either
(i) L = 0 or (ii) c − a = 0. We consider case (i) and case
(ii) in the following.
Case (i)
If L = 0, then
