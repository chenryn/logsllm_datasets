ABSTRACT
I will discuss “advanced cryptography”, namely cryptographic
techniques beyond communication security, including things like
zero knowledge, secure multi-party computation, homomorphic
encryption, and the like.
I will make the case that advanced
cryptography is (a) needed, (b) fast enough to be useful, and (c) Not
“generally usable” yet.
Author Keywords
Privacy, Homomorphic Encryption, Secure Multiparty
Computation, Zero Knowledge
