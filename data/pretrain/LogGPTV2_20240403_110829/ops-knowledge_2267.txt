User: How to conduct security risk assessment, identify and analyze the security risks faced by the system?
Assistant: The steps to conduct a security risk assessment are as follows: 1. Determine the scope and objectives of the system, and clarify the purpose and focus of the risk assessment. 2. Collect system-related information, including hardware, software and network architecture, business processes, data flow, user access control, etc., so as to gain an in-depth understanding of the system's workflow and its weaknesses and vulnerabilities. 3. Identify potential security threats and vulnerabilities, such as unauthorized access, authentication issues, data leakage, denial of service attacks, and other vulnerabilities. 4. Conduct qualitative and quantitative assessments of identified security risks, and rank them according to their importance and likelihood. 5. Formulate security measures and response strategies for each risk, and list implementation plans according to priorities and actual conditions. 6. Regularly update, maintain and check the security of the system, and update the risk assessment and preventive measures at any time.
