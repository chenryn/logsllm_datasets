4.4 Comparing all Schemes with Packet Drops 
At 80% load, all schemes but ARED perform comparably to an un-
congested network, and are barely distinguishable from each other. 
Figures 11-14 compare the best settings, based on the overall dis-
tribution  of  response  times,  for  each  AQM  scheme  for  offered 
loads of 90%, 98%, and 105%. In comparing results for two AQM 
schemes, we claim that the response time performance is better for 
one of them if its CDF is clearly  above the other’s in some sub-

stantial range of response times and comparable in the remaining 
range. At 90% load, PI, REM, and drop-tail all provide reasonable 
performance  for  the  80%  of  responses  that  can  be  completed  in 
400 milliseconds or less. For the remaining 20% of responses, PI 
with a target queue length of 240 is better than the other schemes. 
Overall, PI with a target queue of 240 provides very good perform-
ance at this load. At 98% load, PI is again somewhat superior to 
the  other  schemes  but  note  that the  best  performance  is  obtained 
with a target queue length of 24 and that overall, no AQM scheme 
can  offset  the  performance  degradation  at  this  extreme  load.  At 
105% load performance for all schemes degrades uniformly from 
the 98% case. Table 2 also presents the link utilization, loss ratios, 
and the number of completed requests for each experiment for each 
AQM  scheme.  At  90%  and  98%  offered  loads,  drop-tail  with  a 
queue of 240 gives slightly better link utilization than any of the 
AQM  schemes.  It  also  completes  slightly  more  request-response 
exchanges than the other schemes at the same load. Drop-tail does, 
however,  have  higher  loss  ratios  than  the  other  schemes.  PI  has 
better  loss  ratios  than  REM,  completes  more  requests,  and  has 
better link utilization at all loads.  
Figures 11-12 show that at least 90% of all responses complete in 
under 2 seconds for the best AQM schemes. Figure 14 shows the 
remainder of the distribution at 98% load. The conclusions drawn 
from  Figures  11-13  also  hold  for  responses  that  experience  re-
sponse times up to approximately 50 seconds (~99.95% of all re-
sponses).  The  remaining  responses  perform  best  under  drop-tail. 
Eventually ARED performance approaches that of drop-tail and is 
superior to PI and REM but only for a handful of responses.  
5  AQM EXPERIMENTS WITH ECN 
AQM schemes drop packets as an indirect means of signaling con-
gestion to end-systems. The explicit congestion notification (ECN) 
packet  marking  scheme  was  developed  as  a  means  of  explicitly 
signaling  congestion  to  end-systems  [12].  To  signal  congestion a 
router can “mark” a packet by setting a specified bit in the TCP/IP 
header of the packet. This marking is not modified by subsequent 
routers.  Upon  receipt  of  a  marked  data  segment,  a  TCP  receiver 
will mark the TCP header of its next outbound segment (typically 
an ACK) destined for the sender of the original marked segment. 
Upon receipt of this marked segment, the original sender will react 
as if a single segment had been lost within a send window. In addi-
tion, the sender will mark its next outbound segment (with a differ-
ent marking) to confirm that it has reacted to the congestion.
