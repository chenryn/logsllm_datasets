Certainly! Here is a more structured and professional version of the log entry:

```
Timestamp: 2008-11-10 02:07:24
Process ID: 29
Severity: INFO
Component: dfs.FSNamesystem
Message: BLOCK* NameSystem.delete: Block blk_2568309208894455676 has been added to the invalidSet of 10.251.31.160:50010.
```

### Explanation:
- **Timestamp**: The date and time are formatted in a more readable and standard format (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS).
- **Process ID (Pid)**: This remains as 29, indicating the process identifier.
- **Severity**: The severity level is clearly labeled as "INFO".
- **Component**: The component name `dfs.FSNamesystem` is kept as is.
- **Message**: The message is slightly rephrased for clarity and readability.

This structure makes the log entry easier to read and understand, while maintaining all the necessary information.
