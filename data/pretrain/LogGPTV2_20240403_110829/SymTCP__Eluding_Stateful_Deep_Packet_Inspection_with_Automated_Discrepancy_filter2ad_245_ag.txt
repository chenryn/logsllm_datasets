### Appendix

#### A. Complete List of Drop Points in Linux Kernel v4.9.3
All source-code-level drop points that we have labeled are detailed in Table VII.

#### B. TCP PAWS Checking in Linux and Snort
As illustrated in the pseudo-code provided in Listings 1 and 2, the acceptable TSval ranges for Linux and Snort differ by a value of 2.

```c
if ((signed int)(last_packet->tsval - current_packet->tsval) < 
    (last_packet->tsval - if_last_packet->tsval) + 1)
```

### Drop Conditions and Their Frequencies
The following table lists various drop conditions, their occurrences, and whether they are covered or not.

| Condition | Occurrences | Covered |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| TCP packet size | 1 | 1 |
| TCP checksum error | 2 | 1 |
| TCP MD5 option check failed | 2 | 1 |
| ACK number != server ISN + 1 | 1 | 1 |
| Challenge ACK (the ACK case) | 1 | 1 |
| ACK number > server send next | 1 | 1 |
| ACK number older than previous acks but still in window | 1 | 1 |
| OFO packet overlap | 1 | 1 |
| Empty data packet | 1 | 1 |
| Receive window is zero | 2 | 1 |
| End SEQ number = rcv nxt + window (out of window) | 1 | 1 |
| SEQ number < copied seq (SEQ num too old) | 1 | 1 |
| PAWS check failed (Timestamp) | 1 | 1 |
| Challenge ACK (SYN) (out-of-window) | 1 | 1 |
| SEQ out of window | 1 | 1 |
| Challenge ACK (RST) | 1 | 1 |
| Challenge ACK (SYN) | 1 | 1 |
| Packet length < TCP header length | 1 | 1 |
| Packet size < TCP header length —— TCP checksum error | 1 | 0 |
| No RST and no SYN and no ACK flag | 4 | 3 |
| ACK flag set | 3 | 3 |
| RST flag set | 1 | 1 |
| SYN and FIN flags set | 1 | 1 |
| Fastopen tcp check req failed | 1 | 1 |
| SEQ ≥ rcv nxt | 1 | 1 |
| Retransmitted SYN | 1 | 1 |
| PAWS check failed —— SEQ out of window | 1 | 1 |
| SYN or RST flag set | 1 | 1 |
| No ACK flag | 1 | 1 |
| TCP DEFER ACCEPT drop bare ACK | 1 | 1 |
| **Total** | **47** | **39** |
