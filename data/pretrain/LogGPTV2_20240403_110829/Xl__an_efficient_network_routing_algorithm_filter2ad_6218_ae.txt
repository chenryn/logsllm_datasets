portional to its degree.
Stretch. In addition to counting the number of messages, we per-
formed additional analysis as described in in Section 5. The ﬁrst
quantity we consider is stretch; recall that stretch is the ratio of the
forwarding cost to optimal cost between a pair of nodes. Because
stretch is an instantaneous measure for each pair, it is not an easy
value to summarize for an entire simulation. We use the top stretch
centile for each pair. By the top centile, we mean the lowest up-
per bound for 99% of the simulation duration. In other words, a
pair’s stretch is at most the top centile value 99% of the time. In
Table 6 we report the median, average and maximum top centile
stretch over all pairs for xl with parameter  = 0.5, corresponding
to maximum allowed stretch of 1.5. For all other algorithms, in-
cluding xl with  = 0.0, the maximum top centile stretch was zero
as expected, and is not shown.
Clearly, while the stretch approaches the maximum 1.5 for some
source-destination pairs, the average stretch is quite good, in all
cases at most 5% optimal. In fact, since the median is 1.00, for the
majority of nodes the forwarding path is optimal. By just allowing
the XL algorithm to choose sub-optimal paths we were able to get
the reduction in communication complexity while paying only a
fraction of the allowed 50% penalty.
Convergence. Finally, we consider the convergence time of the
XL routing algorithm. By “convergence time” we mean the time it
takes a routing algorithm to establish a desirable (e.g., sound, com-
plete) forwarding conﬁguration. In essence, it combines the time
Table 6: Top centile stretch for xl with parameter  = 0.5. The median, average,
and maximum of the top centile were taken over all source-destination pairs; a pair’s
instantaneous stretch is at most its top centile value 99% of the time.

Table 8: Maximum duration of inﬁnite forwarding-to-optimal distance ratio relative to
ls. The maximum is taken over all source-destination pairs. The inﬁnite forwarding
to optimal distance ratio duration for a pair of nodes u and w is the duration of time
when (cid:3)φ(u, w)(cid:3) was inﬁnite but δ(u, w) was not.
it takes a routing algorithm to re-establish a sound (or loop-free)
conﬁguration after a link failure and the time it takes the algorithm
to start using a lower-cost path when it becomes available.
The analyzer program does not measure convergence time di-
rectly; instead, it measures the duration of forwarding loops and
the time to establish a new forwarding path when a node becomes
reachable. The former is reported in Table 7 as the maximum, over
all source-destination pairs, of the combined duration of forward-
ing loops. The time to establish a new forwarding path is reported
in Table 8 as the maximum, over all source-destination pairs, of the
total time the forwarding distance was inﬁnite while the optimal
distance was not. In both tables, results are shown relative to ls.
It comes as no surprise that the generic distance vector algorithm
has a problem with long-lasting loops. In contrast, loops in dv+p
and lv are extremely rare and short-lived because, although it is not
guaranteed loop-free at all times, its policy for accepting a next hop
are fairly conservative. The same “reluctance” to accept a new path
