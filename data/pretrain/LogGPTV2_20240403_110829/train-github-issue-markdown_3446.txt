It seems like the parser tries to read the type where it isn't:
    fn main() {
        let a : u32 = 0;
        let b : usize = 0;
        a as usize > b; // ok
        a as usize `, found `;`
    }
I think it's rather strange that the operator `>` works, but the operator `<`
doesn't at the same place.
