User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Apache(httpd) virtual host configuration I am trying to configure virtual host on local web server
What i want is when i go to localhost or server IP i want to see the default centos page and when i go to the other websites that are configured in /etc/hosts then i want to see those websites.

Is this the correct configuration for this setup? Its not working as i want..because now all websites go to default centos page which is not what i want.

NameVirtualHost *:80

&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
    ServerAdmin webmaster@web1.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html/
    ServerName localhost
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;


&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
    ServerAdmin webmaster@web1.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/vhost/web1.com/html/
    ServerName web1.com
    ErrorLog /var/www/vhost/web1.com/logs/error.log
    CustomLog /var/www/vhost/web1.com/logs/access.log common
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;

&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
    ServerAdmin webmaster@web2.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/vhost/web2.com/html/
    ServerName web2.com
    ErrorLog /var/www/vhost/web2.com/logs/error.log
    CustomLog /var/www/vhost/web2.com/logs/access.log common
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;

Assistant: Add this to your virtual host just below ServerName web1.com:

ServerAlias *.web1.com
