World War 3.0
Chaos, Control & The Battle for the Net
DEFCON 20
ABSTRACT:
There is a battle under way for control of the Internet. Some see it as a fight 
between forces of Order (who want to superimpose existing, pre-digital power 
structures and their notions of privacy, intellectual property, security, and 
sovereignty onto the Net) and forces of Disorder (who want to abandon those old 
structures and let the will of the crowd control a new global culture). Yet this 
binary view of the conflict excludes the characters with the best chance of 
resolving it: those who know that control is impossible and chaos is untenable, a 
group that Vanity Fair, in an article called "World War 3.0," called "the forces of 
Organized Chaos." This panel gathers leading proponents of that worldview to 
discuss urgent issues of Internet governance, which may come to a head later 
this year in a Dubai meeting of the U.N.'s International Telecommunications 
Union. If government control and anarchistic chaos online are unacceptable, 
what exactly do the forces of organized chaos propose as an alternative? And 
what is the DefCon community's role in helping to realize that vision of the Net?.
