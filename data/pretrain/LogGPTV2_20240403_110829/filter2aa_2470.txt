### World War 3.0: Chaos, Control & The Battle for the Net
**DEFCON 20**

#### Abstract:
A struggle is currently underway for control of the Internet. Some view this as a conflict between the forces of Order, who seek to impose pre-digital power structures and their conceptions of privacy, intellectual property, security, and sovereignty onto the digital realm, and the forces of Disorder, who wish to abandon these traditional frameworks in favor of a new, crowd-driven global culture. However, this binary perspective overlooks a crucial group: those who recognize that absolute control is unattainable and that complete chaos is unsustainable. This group, referred to as "the forces of Organized Chaos" in a Vanity Fair article titled "World War 3.0," holds the potential to resolve the conflict.

This panel brings together leading proponents of this worldview to discuss pressing issues in Internet governance, which may culminate at a U.N. International Telecommunications Union (ITU) meeting in Dubai later this year. If both governmental control and anarchistic chaos online are unacceptable, what alternative do the forces of organized chaos propose? What role can the DEFCON community play in realizing this vision for the future of the Internet?
