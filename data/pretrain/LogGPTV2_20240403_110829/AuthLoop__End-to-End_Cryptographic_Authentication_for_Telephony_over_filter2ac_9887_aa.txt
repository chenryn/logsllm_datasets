**Abstract:**
Telephones remain a trusted platform for conducting sensitive transactions, from banking to government communications. However, the current authentication mechanisms, such as Caller ID, are often unreliable and can be easily spoofed. This paper introduces AuthLoop, the first system to provide cryptographic authentication solely within the voice channel. We design, implement, and evaluate an in-band modem that executes a TLS-inspired authentication protocol, ensuring strong end-to-end validation of Caller ID. Our experimental results show that AuthLoop can be executed with minimal computational overhead and only a few seconds of user time (approximately 9 seconds) over heterogeneous networks, compared to approximately 97 seconds for a naive implementation of TLS 1.2.

## 1. Introduction
Modern telephony systems encompass a wide range of devices, from traditional PSTN phones to modern cellular and VoIP systems. These devices are the de facto trusted platform for many sensitive operations. Despite this, Caller ID is known to be a poor authenticator and is exploited in frauds amounting to over US$2 billion annually. 

The web faced similar issues in the 1990s and developed the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol suite to address them. However, telephony lacks such strong mechanisms, making it difficult even for security experts to verify the identity of callers. 

AuthLoop addresses this problem by providing a strong cryptographic authentication protocol inspired by TLS 1.2. Unlike other solutions that require Internet access, AuthLoop operates over the audio channel, which is available on all phone systems. This approach requires no changes to the network core and can be deployed without significant adoption barriers.

**Contributions:**
1. **Complete Transmission Layer Design:** We design a codec-agnostic modem for data transmission over audio channels and a supporting link layer protocol.
2. **AuthLoop Authentication Protocol:** We specify our security goals and design the AuthLoop protocol to provide explicit authentication of one party (the "Prover") and optional weak authentication of the second party (the "Verifier").
3. **Performance Evaluation:** We implement AuthLoop and test it using representative codecs (G.711, AMR, and Speex). We achieve a goodput of 500 bps with bit error rates below 0.5% and demonstrate that AuthLoop can run in an average of 9 seconds, compared to 97 seconds for a direct port of TLS 1.2.

## 2. Background and Related Work
### 2.1 Modern Telephony Networks
The landscape of modern telephony is complex and heterogeneous, with subscribers receiving service from mobile, PSTN, and VoIP networks. Each network uses different, often incompatible technologies, and voice signals are transcoded at gateways. Caller ID, the primary form of digital information passed between networks, is asserted but not validated, making it easy for adversaries to spoof identities.

### 2.2 Authentication in Telephony Networks
Authentication has been a primary concern in telephony since its inception, primarily due to billing. Traditional landline networks had limited scalability for attacks, while 1G cellular systems were vulnerable to fraud. 2G networks introduced cryptographic mechanisms but failed to authenticate the network to the user. 3G and 4G systems implemented mutual authentication but focused on billing, not caller identification.

Several solutions have emerged to provide authentication between end users, such as Zphone and RedPhone, but these rely on data/Internet connections and are vulnerable to various attacks. There remains no end-to-end solution for authentication across voice networks.

### 2.3 Authentication on the Internet
Internet authentication relies on strong cryptographic mechanisms like SSL/TLS, which provide attestable identity for various applications. While SSL/TLS have their vulnerabilities, they offer more robust means to reason about identity than telephony approaches.

## 3. Voice Channel Data Transmission
To provide end-to-end authentication across any telephone networks, we need a way to transfer data over the voice channel. This section details the challenges, our implementation of a 500bps modem, and the development of a link layer to address channel errors.

### 3.1 Challenges to Data Transmission
Traditional telephone modems operated over high-fidelity analog twisted pairs, but modern telephony, including cellular and VoIP, uses heavily compressed audio. Voice codecs, designed to save bandwidth, employ techniques that make the channel unsuitable for digital data transmission. Existing modems are not suitable for cellular or VoIP networks due to issues with amplitude and phase preservation.

### 3.2 Modem Design
Our physical layer protocol addresses these challenges by using frequency-shift modulation, which is the most effective technique for transmitting data through voice codecs. We design a codec-agnostic modem that can operate over the voice channel, ensuring reliable data transmission.

## 4. Security Model
We define our security model, specifying the security goals and threat model for AuthLoop. The protocol aims to provide strong authentication of the Prover and optional weak authentication of the Verifier, ensuring that the identity of the caller can be verified with high confidence.

## 5. AuthLoop Protocol
We formally define the AuthLoop protocol and parameterize our system based on the modem. The protocol is designed to be efficient and secure, leveraging the strengths of TLS 1.2 while adapting to the constraints of the voice channel.

## 6. Prototype and Experimental Results
We implement AuthLoop and test it using three representative codecs: G.711 (PSTN), AMR (cellular), and Speex (VoIP). Our experiments demonstrate a goodput of 500 bps with bit error rates below 0.5%. AuthLoop runs in an average of 9 seconds, significantly reducing the time required for authentication compared to a direct port of TLS 1.2.

## 7. Additional Discussion
We discuss the implications of our work, including the potential for widespread adoption and the impact on reducing fraud. We also address potential future work and areas for improvement.

## 8. Conclusion
In conclusion, AuthLoop provides a practical and efficient solution for end-to-end cryptographic authentication over the voice channel. By addressing the unique challenges of modern telephony, we demonstrate that strong authentication is possible and can be implemented with minimal overhead.
