Abstract
Telephones remain a trusted platform for conducting
some of our most sensitive exchanges. From banking to
taxes, wide swathes of industry and government rely on
telephony as a secure fall-back when attempting to con-
ﬁrm the veracity of a transaction. In spite of this, authen-
tication is poorly managed between these systems, and in
the general case it is impossible to be certain of the iden-
tity (i.e., Caller ID) of the entity at the other end of a call.
We address this problem with AuthLoop, the ﬁrst system
to provide cryptographic authentication solely within the
voice channel. We design, implement and characterize
the performance of an in-band modem for executing a
TLS-inspired authentication protocol, and demonstrate
its abilities to ensure that the explicit single-sided authen-
tication procedures pervading the web are also possible
on all phones. We show experimentally that this protocol
can be executed with minimal computational overhead
and only a few seconds of user time (≈ 9 instead of ≈ 97
seconds for a na¨ıve implementation of TLS 1.2) over het-
erogeneous networks. In so doing, we demonstrate that
strong end-to-end validation of Caller ID is indeed prac-
tical for all telephony networks.

Introduction
Modern telephony systems include a wide array of end-
user devices. From traditional rotary PSTN phones to
modern cellular and VoIP capable systems, these devices
remain the de facto trusted platform for conducting many
of our most sensitive operations. Even more critically,
these systems offer the sole reliable connection for the
majority of people in the world today.
Such trust is not necessarily well placed. Caller ID
is known to be a poor authenticator [59, 18, 67], and
yet is successfully exploited to enable over US$2 Bil-
lion in fraud every year [28]. Many scammers simply
block their phone number and exploit trusting users by
asserting an identity (e.g., a bank, law enforcement, etc.),
taking advantage of a lack of reliable cues and mecha-
nisms to dispute such claims. Addressing these prob-
lems will require the application of lessons from a related
space. The Web experienced very similar problems in the
1990s, and developed and deployed the Transport Layer
Security (TLS) protocol suite and necessary support in-
frastructure to assist with the integration of more veri-
ﬁable identity in communications. While by no means
perfect and still an area of active research, this infrastruc-
ture helps to make a huge range of attacks substantially
more difﬁcult. Unfortunately, the lack of similarly strong
mechanisms in telephony means that not even trained se-
curity experts can currently reason about the identity of
other callers.
In this paper, we address
this problem with
AuthLoop.1 AuthLoop provides a strong cryptographic
authentication protocol inspired by TLS 1.2. However,
unlike other related solutions that assume Internet access
(e.g., Silent Circle, RedPhone, etc [24, 73, 25, 5, 3, 6,
1, 74, 7]), accessibility to a secondary and concurrent
data channel is not a guarantee in many locations (e.g.,
high density cities, rural areas) nor for all devices, man-
dating that a solution to this problem be network agnos-
tic. Accordingly, AuthLoop is designed for and trans-
mitted over the only channel certain to be available to all
phone systems — audio. The advantage to this approach
is that it requires no changes to any network core, which
would likely see limited adoption at best. Through the
use of AuthLoop, users can quickly and strongly iden-
tify callers who may fraudulently be claiming to be orga-
nizations including their ﬁnancial institutions and their
government [28].
We make the following contributions:
1A name reminiscent of the “Local Loop” used to tie traditional
phone systems into the larger network, we seek to tie modern telephony
systems into the global authentication infrastructure that has dramati-
cally improved transaction security over the web during the past two
decades.

gateway, all identity mechanisms become asserted rather than attested as calls cross network borders. A strong end-
to-end authentication must be designed aware of all such limitations.
• Design a Complete Transmission Layer: We de-
sign the ﬁrst codec-agnostic modem that allows for
the transmission of data across audio channels. We
then create a supporting link layer protocol to en-
able the reliable delivery of data across the hetero-
geneous landscape of telephony networks.
• Design AuthLoop Authentication Protocol: After
characterizing the bandwidth limitations of our data
channel, we specify our security goals and design
the AuthLoop protocol to provide explicit authenti-
cation of one party (i.e., the “Prover”) and option-
ally weak authentication of the second party (i.e.,
the “Veriﬁer”).
• Evaluate Performance of a Reference Implemen-
tation: We implement AuthLoop and test it us-
ing three representative codecs — G.711 (for PSTN
networks), AMR (for cellular networks) and Speex
(for VoIP networks). We demonstrate the ability
to create a data channel with a goodput of 500 bps
and bit error rates averaging below 0.5%. We then
demonstrate that AuthLoop can be run over this
channel in an average of 9 seconds (which can be
played below speaker audio), compared to running
a direct port of TLS 1.2 in an average of 97 seconds
(a 90% reduction in running time).
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows:
Section 2 provides background information and related
work; Section 3 presents the details of our system includ-
ing lower-layer considerations; Section 4 discusses our
security model; Section 5 formally deﬁnes the AuthLoop
protocol and parameterizes our system based on the mo-
dem; Section 6 discusses our prototype and experimental
results; Section 7 provides additional discussion about
our system; and Section 8 provides concluding remarks.
2 Background and Related Work
In this section, we provide an overview of modern tele-
phony networks and review current and proposed prac-
tices of authentication in those networks.
2.1 Modern Telephony Networks
The landscape of modern telephony is complex and het-
erogeneous. Subscribers can receive service from mo-
bile, PSTN and VoIP networks, and calls to those sub-
scribers may similarly originate from networks imple-
menting any of the above technologies. Figure 1 pro-
vides a high-level overview of this ecosystem.
While performing similar high-level
functionality
(i.e., enabling voice calls), each of these networks is
built on a range of often incompatible technologies.
From circuit-switched intelligent network cores to packet
switching over the public Internet, very little information
beyond the voice signal actually propagates across the
borders of these systems. In fact, because many of these

Figure 2: A comparison of a signal (a) before and (b) after being encoded with the AMR codec. Note that while the
entirety of the signal is within the range of allowable frequencies for call audio, the received signal differs signiﬁcantly
from its original form. It is therefore critical that a high-ﬁdelity mechanism for delivering data over a mobile audio
channel be designed.
networks rely on different codecs for encoding voice,
one of the major duties of gateways between these sys-
tems is the transcoding of audio. Accordingly, voice en-
coded at one end of a phone call is unlikely to have the
same (or even similar) bitwise representation when it ar-
rives at the client side of the call. As evidence, the top
plot of Figure 2 shows a sweep of an audio signal from
300 to 3300 Hz (all within the acceptable band) across
1 second. The bottom plot shows the same signal af-
ter is has been encoded using the Adaptive Multi-Rate
(AMR) audio codec used in cellular networks, resulting
in a dramatically different message. This massive differ-
ence is a result of the voice-optimized audio codecs used
in different telephony networks. Accordingly, success-
fully performing end-to-end authentication will require
careful design for this non-traditional data channel.
One of the few pieces of digital information that can
be optionally passed between networks is the Caller ID.
Unfortunately, the security value of this metadata is min-
imal — such information is asserted by the source de-
vice or network, but never validated by the terminating
or intermediary networks. As such, an adversary is able
to claim any phone number (and therefore identity) as
its own with ease. This process requires little technical
sophistication, can be achieved with the assistance of a
wide range of software and services, and is the enabler
of greater than US$2 Billion in fraud annually [28].
2.2 Authentication in Telephony Networks
Authentication has been the chief security concern of
phone networks since their inception because of its
strong ties to billing [69]. Little effort was taken for au-
thentication in traditional landline networks as detecting
billable activity on a physical link limited the scalability
of attacks. First generation (1G) cellular systems were
the ﬁrst to consider such mechanisms given the multi-
user nature of wireless spectrum. Unfortunately, 1G au-
thentication relied solely on the plaintext assertion of
each user’s identity and was therefore subject to signiﬁ-
cant fraud [53]. Second generation (2G) networks (e.g.,
GSM) designed cryptographic mechanisms for authen-
ticating users to the network. These protocols failed to
authenticate the network to the user and lead to a range
of attacks against subscribers [44, 26, 19, 68]. Third
and fourth generation (3G and 4G) systems correctly
implement mutual authentication between the users and
providers [11, 12, 13]. Unfortunately, all such mecha-
nisms are designed to allow accurate billing, and do little
to help users identify other callers.
While a number of seemingly-cellular mechanisms
have emerged to provide authentication between end
users (e.g., Zphone, RedPhone) [24, 73, 25, 5, 3, 6, 1, 74,
7, 31, 30] , these systems ultimately rely on a data/Inter-
net connection to work, and are themselves vulnerable
to a number of attacks [63, 52]. Accordingly, there re-
mains no end-to-end solution for authentication across
voice networks (i.e., authentication with any non-VoIP
phone is not possible).
Mechanisms to deal with such attacks have had limited
success. Websites have emerged with reputation data for
unknown callers [2]; however, these sites offer no pro-
tection against Caller-ID spooﬁng, and users generally
access such information after such a call has occurred.
Others have designed heuristic approaches around black
lists [4], speaker recognition [71, 16, 72, 17, 66, 41],
channel characterization [18, 54], post hoc call data
records [58, 47, 23, 40] and timing [61]. Unfortunately,
the fuzzy nature of these mechanisms may cause them to
fail under a range of common conditions including con-
gestion and evasion.
Authentication between entities on the Internet gen-
erally relies on the use of strong cryptographic mecha-

nisms. The SSL/TLS suite of protocols are by far the
most widely used, and help provide attestable identity for
applications as diverse as web browsing, email, instant
messaging and more. SSL/TLS are not without their own
issues, including a range of vulnerabilities across differ-
ent versions and implementations of the protocols [48,
27, 75, 34], weaknesses in the model and deployment
of Certiﬁcate Authorities [57, 36, 37, 38, 29, 39, 20],
and usability [55, 32, 60, 35, 65, 14, 15]. Regardless of
these challenges, these mechanisms provide more robust
means to reason about identity than the approaches used
in telephony.
Telephony can build on the success of SSL/TLS. How-
ever, these mechanisms can not simply be built on top
of current telephony systems.
Instead, and as we will
demonstrate, codec-aware protocols that are optimized
for the limited bitrate and higher loss of telephony sys-
tems must be designed.
3 Voice Channel Data Transmission
To provide end-to-end authentication across any tele-
phone networks, we need a way to transfer data over the
voice channel. The following sections detail the chal-
lenges that must be addressed, how we implemented a
modem that provides a base data rate of 500bps, and how
we developed a link layer to address channel errors. We
conclude with a discussion of what these technical limi-
tations imply for using standard authentication technolo-
gies over voice networks.
3.1 Challenges to Data Transmission
Many readers may fondly remember dial-up Internet ac-
cess and a time when data transmission over voice chan-
nels was a common occurrence. In the heyday of tele-
phone modems, though, most voice channels were con-
nected over high-ﬁdelity analog twisted pair. Although
the voice channel was band limited and digital trunks
used a low sample rate of 8kHz, the channel was quite
“well behaved” from a digital communications and sig-
nal processing perspective.
In the last two decades, telephony has been trans-
formed. Cellular voice and Internet telephony now com-
prise a majority of all voice communications; they are not
just ubiquitous, they are unavoidable. While beneﬁcial
from a number of perspectives, one of the drawbacks is
that both of these modalities rely on heavily compressed
audio transmission to save bandwidth. These compres-
sion algorithms – audio codecs – are technological feats,
as they have permitted cheap, acceptable quality phone
calls, especially given that they were developed during
eras when computation was expensive. To do this, codec
designers employed a number of technical and psychoa-
coustic tricks to produce acceptable audio to a human
ear, and these tricks resulted in a channel poorly suited
for (if not hostile to) the transmission of digital data. As
a result, existing voice modems are completely unsuited
for data transmission in cellular or VoIP networks.
Voice codecs present several challenges to a general-
purpose modem. First, amplitudes are not well preserved
by voice codecs. This discounts many common modula-
tion schemes, including ASK, QAM, TCM, and PCM.
Second, phase discontinuities are rare in speech, and
are not effective to transmit data through popular voice
codecs. This discounts PSK, QPSK, and other modula-
tion schemes that rely on correct phase information. Fur-
thermore, many codecs lose phase information on encod-
ing/decoding audio, preventing the use of efﬁcient de-
modulators that require correct phase (i.e., coherent de-
modulators). Because of the problems with amplitude
and phase modulation, frequency-shift modulation is the
most effective technique for transmitting data through
voice codecs. Even so, many codecs fail to accurately
reproduce input frequencies — even those well within
telephone voicebands (300–3400 Hz). Our physical layer
protocol addresses these challenges.
