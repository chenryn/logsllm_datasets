React batches all component updates if they become dirty during an event-
callback (events are also batched). However, this is not exposed for use with
external events, such as `setTimeout`, `addEventHandler`, AJAX-replies, non-
React DOM events or any other events, and it seems only natural that it should
extend to those too.
I see two obvious solutions:
**Export`React.batchedUpdates(callback, param)`**
    setTimeout(function() {
      React.batchedUpdates(function() {
        ...
      }.bind(this));
    });
    setTimeout(React.batchedUpdates.bind(null, function() {
      ...
    }.bind(this));
**Export a callback factory`React.batchedCallback(callback, args...)`**
    setTimeout(React.batchedCallback(function() {
      ...
    }.bind(this));
Thoughts?
I'm guessing this belongs with #326
