User: I have a script that will put the system to sleep in the middle of it. Is there any way to make that script wake the system up and then continue running?
I have read many round-about ways of doing so by Wake on LAN or using Task Scheduler. I am looking for something that would wake it up after a set period of time or after a specific piece of my script is finished. I will need to this to work for Windows 7, 8.1, and 10.
Anyone know of a way to wake from sleep while still running a script?
Assistant: I was unable to accomplish this using just python. However in the Windows SDK they provide a tool called pwrtest that will allow you to do timed sleep cycles. I am able to call this with python and then my script continues when pwrtest wakes the PC up from sleep.
