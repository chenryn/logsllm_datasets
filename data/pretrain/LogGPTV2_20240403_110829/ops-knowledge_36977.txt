User: According to the requirements of the following web applications, please design a suitable architecture and corresponding technical solutions. Requirements:\n1. The application needs to support online shopping functions, including product browsing, adding to shopping cart, settlement, payment, etc. \n2. Users need to register and log in to view order history, edit personal information, etc. \n3. The database needs to support a large amount of order data and ensure high reliability and availability. \n4. The application needs to support a large number of concurrent accesses to ensure a smooth user experience. \n5. The system needs to support a certain scale of expansion and upgrade. \n6. It is necessary to ensure the security of data transmission and user privacy.
Assistant: Architecture design: Front-end: React.js is used as the front-end framework for development, and its efficient virtual DOM rendering capability and component-based development mode are used to conveniently and quickly realize the development and maintenance of front-end components. Backend: Node.js is used as the backend development language, combined with Express.js as the backend framework to quickly build the server part of the Web application. At the same time, use the asynchronous and non-blocking language features of Node.js to implement a high-concurrency server-side architecture. Database: MySQL relational database management system is used for data management, and distributed database cluster technology is used to ensure high availability and high reliability. And use data horizontal expansion technology to increase database performance and scalability. Cache: Redis is used as the application cache system, combined with distributed cache technology and SSL encryption technology to ensure the security of data transmission and user privacy. Architecture diagram: ![web application architecture diagram](https://i.loli.net/2021/08/04/nHhoqzGVCALwI9J.png) Technical solution: Front end: React.js, Redux, React Router, Ant Design Back end : Node.js, Express.js, jsonwebtoken Database: MySQL, distributed database cluster technology Cache: Redis, distributed cache technology, SSL encryption technology Server: Nginx, Docker Security: SSL certificate encryption technology is used to prevent data leakage and middlemen attack, while ensuring user privacy through user authentication. Scalability: use Docker containerization technology to facilitate deployment and upgrade, and increase the service capability of web applications through load balancing and automatic expansion technology. Summary: The above technical solutions combine the needs of the server and the client to achieve a high-concurrency, high-reliability, and high-availability web application. By adopting a series of technical means such as distributed database cluster technology, distributed cache technology, SSL encryption technology, and Nginx load balancing technology, the security of data transmission and user privacy is realized. At the same time, the use of Docker containerization technology facilitates deployment and upgrades, ensuring the scalability and upgradeability of the system.
