After installing an Atom update and restarting, the blue squirrel stays
present until I restart again. If you have OCPD or FOMO it's hard to ignore
that squirrel, but also annoying to re-open all the windows/files as they
were.
It'd be great if installing an update hid him immediately.
Sorry if this is the wrong repo to create the issue. I didn't see a sub-
package that seemed responsible for handling updates.
