### 5.2.1 Recall and Analysis

Recall that \( S \) includes all 13 Tier 1 ASes, all 100 Tier 2 ASes, and all their stubs, which constitute approximately 50% of the AS graph.

#### Root Cause Analysis for the Security 3rd Model
Figure 16 (left) illustrates a root cause analysis for the security 3rd model. According to Theorem 6.1, collateral damages do not occur in this model, so we will not consider them here.

#### Changes in Secure Routes
We begin with an analysis similar to that in Section 5.3.1. The bottom three parts of the bar chart show the fraction of secure routes available under normal conditions, before any routing attacks. (Averaging is across all \( V^2 \) sources and destinations.)

During routing attacks, these routes can be categorized into three types:
1. **Secure routes lost to protocol downgrade attacks** (lowest part of the bar).
2. **Secure routes that are “wasted” on ASes that would have been unaffected even without S*BGP** (second lowest part).
3. **Secure routes that protected ASes that were vulnerable in the absence of S*BGP** (third lowest part).

(Averaging is, as usual, over \( M' \) and \( D = V \), and all \( V \) source ASes.)

Improvements in our security metric can only result from the small fraction of secure routes in class (3). The remaining secure routes either (1) disappear due to protocol downgrades or (2) are “wasted” on ASes that would have avoided the attack even without S*BGP.

#### Changes in the Metric
The top two parts of the bar chart show how the lower bound on the metric \( H_{M',V}(S) \) grows relative to the baseline scenario \( S = \emptyset \) due to:
- **Secure routes in class (3)**.
- **The lower bound on the fraction of insecure ASes that obtained collateral benefits**.

Figure 16 (left) thus highlights the importance of collateral benefits.

#### Analysis for the Security 1st Model
Figure 16 (right) presents the same analysis for the security 1st model. By Theorem 3.1, protocol downgrade attacks are rare in this model, so they are not visible in the figure. However, we now need to account for collateral damages (Section 6.1.1), depicted by the smaller sliver on the right of the figure.

The change in the metric is calculated by subtracting the collateral damages from the gains resulting from:
- **Offering secure routes to unhappy ASes**.
- **Collateral benefits**.

Fortunately, we find that collateral damages are relatively rare.

#### Fitting It All Together
This analysis reveals that changes in the metric can be computed as follows:
\[
(\text{Secure routes created under normal conditions}) + (\text{collateral benefits}) - (\text{protocol downgrades}) - (\text{secure routes "wasted" on ASes that are already happy}) - (\text{collateral damages})
\]

We find that all these phenomena, except for collateral damage, significantly impact the security metric. This underscores the point that the number of routes learned via S*BGP under normal conditions is a poor proxy for network security; more sophisticated metrics like the ones we use here are required.

#### Results for Security 2nd and 3rd Models
Results for the security 2nd model are very similar to those for the security 3rd model, with the addition of a small amount of collateral damage. When security is 2nd or 3rd:
1. **Protocol downgrade attacks cause many secure routes that were available under normal conditions to disappear**.
2. **ASes that retain their secure routes during the attack would have been happy even if S*BGP had not been deployed**.

The result is modest increases in the security metric. In contrast, when security is 1st, few downgrades occur, and the security metric is greatly improved.

### 7. Related Work
Over the past decades, several security extensions to BGP have been proposed; see [10] for a survey. However, new security extensions to BGP and their subsequent security analyses typically assume that secure ASes will never accept insecure routes [6, 11], which is reasonable in the full deployment scenario where every AS has already deployed S*BGP [7, 10, 22].

There have also been studies on incentives for S*BGP adoption [11, 19]. These works suggest that “S*BGP and BGP will coexist in the long term” [19], motivating our study of S*BGP in partial deployment scenarios. The partial deployment scenarios we considered have been suggested in practice [44] and in the literature [6, 11, 19].

Our work is most closely related to [22], which measures “security” as the fraction of source ASes that avoid having their traffic intercepted by the attacking AS. However, [22] always assumes full deployment of the S*BGP variant. As discussed in Section 4.2, [22] finds that fully-deployed origin authentication provides good security against the attacks studied here (i.e., announcing “m, d” using...).
