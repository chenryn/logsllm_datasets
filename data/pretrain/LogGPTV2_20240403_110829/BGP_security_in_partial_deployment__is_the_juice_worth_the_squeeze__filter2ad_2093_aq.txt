tion 5.2.1. Recall that S is all 13 Tier 1s, all 100 Tier 2s and
all of their stubs, i.e., roughly 50% of the AS graph.
Figure 16 (left). We start with a root cause analysis for
the security 3rd model. Recall that Theorem 6.1 showed that
collateral damages do not occur in the security 3rd model,
and so we do not consider them here.
Changes in secure routes.
We start with an analysis
similar to that of Section 5.3.1; The bottom three parts of
the bar show the fraction of secure routes available in normal
conditions, prior to any routing attacks. (Averaging is across
all V 2 sources and destinations.) During routing attacks,
these routes can be broken down into three types: (1) secure
routes lost to protocol downgrade attacks (lowest part of the
bar), (2) secure routes that are “wasted” on ASes that would
have been happy even in the absence of S*BGP (second
lowest part), and (3) secure routes that protected ASes that
were unhappy in the absence of S*BGP (third lowest part).
(Averaging is, as usual, over M(cid:48) and D = V and all V source
ASes.)
Importantly, improvements in our security metric
can only result from the small fraction of secure routes in
class (3); the remaining secure routes either (1) disappear
due to protocol downgrades, or (2) are “wasted” on ASes
that would have avoided the attack even without S*BGP.
Changes in the metric. The top two parts of the bar show
how (the lower bound on) the metric HM(cid:48),V (S) grows rela-
tive to the baseline scenario S = ∅ due to: (a) secure routes
in class (3), and (b) (the lower bound on) the fraction of in-
secure ASes that obtained collateral beneﬁts. Figure 16(left)
thus illustrates the importance of collateral beneﬁts.
Figure 16 (right). We perform the same analysis for the
security 1st model. By Theorem 3.1, protocol downgrade at-
tacks occur only rarely in this model, so these are not visible
in the ﬁgure. However, we now have to account for collateral

damages (Section 6.1.1), which we depict with the smaller
sliver on right of the ﬁgure. We obtain the change in the
metric by subtracting the collateral damages from the gains
resulting from (a) oﬀering secure routes to unhappy ASes
and (b) collateral beneﬁts. Fortunately, we ﬁnd collateral
damages to be a relatively rare phenomenon.
Fitting it all together?
This analysis reveals that
changes in the metric can be computed as follows: (Secure
routes created under normal conditions) + (collateral ben-
eﬁts) − (protocol downgrades) − (secure routes “wasted”
on ASes that are already happy) − (collateral damages).
We ﬁnd that all of these phenomena (with the exception of
collateral damage) have signiﬁcant impact on the security
metric. These observations also drive home the point that
the number of routes learned via S*BGP in normal condi-
tions is a poor proxy for the “security” of the network; more
sophisticated metrics like the ones we use here are required.
Results where security 2nd look very similar to results
when security is 3rd, with the addition of a small amount of
collateral damage. The bottom line is, when security is 2nd
or 3rd, (1) protocol downgrade attacks cause many secure
routes that were available under normal conditions to dis-
appear, and (2) those ASes that retain their secure routes
during the attack would have been happy even if S*BGP
had not been deployed; the result is meagre increases in the
security metric. Meanwhile, when security is 1st, few down-
grades occur, and the security metric is greatly improved.
7. RELATED WORK
Over the past decades several security extensions to BGP
have been proposed; see [10] for a survey. However, pro-
posals of new security extensions to BGP, and their subse-
quent security analyses typically assume that secure ASes
will never accept insecure routes [6, 11], which is reasonable
in the full deployment scenario where every AS has already
deployed S*BGP [7, 10, 22]. There have also been studies on
incentives for S*BGP adoption [11, 19]; these works suggest
that “S*BGP and BGP will coexist in the long term” [19],
which motivated our study of S*BGP in partial deployment.
The partial deployment scenarios we considered have been
suggested in practice [44] and in this literature [6, 11, 19].
Our work is most closely related to [22], which also mea-
sures “security” as the fraction of source ASes that avoid
having their traﬃc intercepted by the attacking AS. How-
ever, [22] always assumes that the S*BGP variant is fully de-
ployed. Thus, as discussed in Section 4.2, [22] also ﬁnds that
fully-deployed origin authentication provides good security
against attack we studied here (i.e., announcing “m, d” using
