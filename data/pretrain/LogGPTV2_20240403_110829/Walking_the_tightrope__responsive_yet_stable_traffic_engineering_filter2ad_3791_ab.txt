val is set to 5 times the probe interval, i.e., Td (cid:21) 5Tp.
Our distributed load balancer works iteratively; every time the
decision timer (cid:2)res, the load balancer at TeXCP agent s, computes
a change in the fraction of IE traf(cid:2)c sent on path p, called (cid:1)xsp.
This change must satisfy the following constraints:
(1) Once at equilibrium, traf(cid:2)c assignment does not change and
(cid:1)xsp = 0; 8s;8p 2 Ps.
(2) Conservation of traf(cid:2)c implies Pp2Ps
(3) A path whose rate is zero cannot have its rate decreased, i.e.,
xsp = 1; 8s.
xsp = 0 ) (cid:1)xsp (cid:21) 0.
(4) Each update should decrease the maximum utilization, i.e., if p
is a path with maximum utilization at TeXCP agent s, then either
xsp = 0 or (cid:1)xsp  umin
p; usp = umin:
(5)
The term rsp is the draining rate of path p 2 Ps, which is computed
as the number of bits sent on the path since the last time the decision
timer (cid:2)red divided by the decision interval Td. The term usp is the
most recent value of the pathâ€™s utilization reported by the probes,
umin is the minimum utilization across all paths controlled by this
agent, 0  0:9 umax and xsp  1 is a parameter that controls
the bias against longer paths. The default is (cid:13) = 3. The TeXCP
agent estimates dsp by measuring the probe RTT, and communi-
cates this to the core router through a (cid:2)eld in the probe (Fig. 2).
To produce Weighted Max(cid:150)Min Fairness instead of Max(cid:150)Min
Fairness, a core router replaces the sum of IE (cid:3)ows, N, in Eq. 11
with a weighted sum as follows:
(cid:8) (cid:21) 0 ) (cid:14)+ =
vsp(cid:8)
Pp02Pl
(cid:8) < 0 ) (cid:14)+ = 0; (cid:14)(cid:0) =
; (cid:14)(cid:0) = 0;

Note the negative feedback does not change as it is already a pro-
portional factor. We use Eq. 12 in all our experiments.
4. ANALYSIS
To make the analysis tractable, we adopt a (cid:3)uid model and as-
sume queues and traf(cid:2)c are unbounded. We also assume that each
path has a single bottleneck and that the TeXCP load balancers are
synchronized. Finally, we assume that IE traf(cid:2)c demands change at
4Indeed, the router may know the number of IE (cid:3)ows without any computation; if
paths are pinned with MPLS, then N is just the number of transit LSPs.
