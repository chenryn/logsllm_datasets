  * VSCode Version: 1.1.1
  * OS Version: Windows 10
Steps to Reproduce:
  1. Open the attached file markdown.txt in VSCode.
  2. Enable word wrap to be able to view the entire paragraph.
  3. Rename the file to have the '.md' extension identifying it as Markdown
  4. Observe syntax coloring of the markdown text. The entire sentence starting with the phrase "One set of encoded values" is inappropriately colored blue because the syntax highlighting code in VSCode is confused by the example.
Note: results from processing this markdown using grunt-markdown results in
HTML producing the desired effect, the flaw seems to be in the markdown
highlighting logic.
