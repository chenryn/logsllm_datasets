User: I noticed that java apache beam has class groupby.sortbytimestamp does python have that feature implemented yet? If not what would be the way to sort elements in a window? I figure I could sort the entire window in a DoFn, but I would like to know if there is a better way.
Assistant: There is not currently built-in value sorting in Beam (in either Python or Java). Right now, the best option is to sort the values yourself in a DoFn like you mentioned.
