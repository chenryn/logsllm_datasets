I made a simple app to test compatibility with IE and it seems that adding
router (`RouteConfig` and ``) gives following error:
    TypeError: Unable to get value of the property 'contains': object is null or undefined
I can't really say which line exactly produces the error (debugging on IE is
really painful, especially on VM - any tips regarding that are welcome).
Main component looks like this:
    import {Component} from 'angular2/angular2';
    import {RouteConfig, ROUTER_DIRECTIVES} from 'angular2/router';
    import {TestComponent} from './components/test';
    @Component({
      selector: 'app',
      template: '',
      directives: [ROUTER_DIRECTIVES]
    })
    @RouteConfig([
      { path: '/', component: TestComponent }
    ])
    export class App {}
`TestComponent` is:
    import {Component} from 'angular2/angular2';
    @Component({
      selector: 'test',
      template: 'Hello from component: {{ test }}'
    })
    export class TestComponent {
      public test: string = 'test';
    }
