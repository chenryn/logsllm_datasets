V. RELATED WORK
A. Spaced Repetition
Pimsleur [9] proposed a rehearsal schedule to help people
memorize unfamiliar vocabulary words. He suggested rehears-
ing after 5 seconds, 25 seconds, 2 minutes, 10 minutes, 5
hours, 1 day, 5 days, 20 days, etc. Pimsleur based his rec-
ommendations on previous empirical studies [34, pp. 726 ff].
Blocki et al. [12] developed a usability model for password
management schemes based on an assumption they called
the expanding rehearsal assumptions. Loosely, this assumption
states that a user will be able to remember a secret by
following a rehearsal schedule similar to the one proposed
by Pimsleur. The application SuperMemo [8] uses a similar
rehearsal schedule to help users remember ﬂashcards. Wozniak
and Gorzelanczyk conducted an empirical study to test these
rehearsal schedules [7]. In their study undergraduate students
were asked to memorize and rehearse vocabulary words for a
foreign language by following a rehearsal schedule very similar
11
to the expanding rehearsal schedule. Wozniak and Gorze-
lanczyk tracked each students performance with each particular
vocabulary word and used that information to estimate how
difﬁcult each word was. If a word was deemed ‘difﬁcult’ then
the length of the time interval before the next rehearsal would
only increase by a small multiplicative constant (e.g., 1.5) and
if the word was judged to be ‘easy’ then this time interval
would increase by a larger multiplicative constant (e.g., 4).
We stress two key differences in our study: First, because
we are asking the user to memorize secrets that will be
used to form passwords our rehearsal schedule needs to be
conservative enough that our user will consistently be able to
remember his secrets during each rehearsal. In other studies
the information participants were asked to memorize (e.g.,
vocabulary words) was not secret so a participant could simply
look up the correct answer whenever they forgot the correct
answer during a rehearsal. By contrast, in the password setting
a recovery mechanism may not always be available — users
are advised against writing down passwords and organizations
have been held liable for damages when they do not properly
encrypt their passwords [35]. Second, in our study we ask
participants to memorize secrets by following the Person-
Action-Object mnemonic techniques. Because these secrets
may be easier or harder to memorize than other information
like vocabulary words the ideal rehearsal schedule should be
tailored to particular mnemonic techniques adopted by the user.
Previous studies have demonstrated that cued recall is easier
than pure recall (see for example [10]) and that we have a large
capacity for visual memories [11]. However, we are not aware
of any prior studies which compare cued recall and pure recall
when participants are following a rehearsal schedule similar to
the one suggested by the expanding rehearsal assumption.
B. Spaced Repetition – Applications to Passwords
a) Password Management Schemes: While there are
many articles, books, papers and even comics about selecting
strong individual passwords [36]–[43], there has been little
work on password management schemes—systematic strate-
gies to help users create and remember multiple passwords—
that are both usable and secure. Bonneau et al. [1] eval-
uated several alternatives to text passwords (e.g., graphical
passwords, password management software, single-sign-on,
federated authentication) ﬁnding that, while each alternative
had its advantages, none of the alternatives were strictly better
than text passwords. Florencio et al. [44] argued that any usable
password management scheme6 cannot require users to mem-
orize unique random passwords. They suggested that users
adopt a tiered password management scheme with a unique
password for high, medium and low security accounts. Blocki
et al. [12] recently proposed designing password management
schemes that maximized the natural rehearsal rate for each of
the secrets that the user had to memorize subject to minimum
security constraints. Our study is heavily motivated by their
work, which we already described in Section II.
b) Slowly Expanding Password Strength: Bonneau and
Schechter conducted a user study in which participants were
encouraged to slowly memorize a strong 56 bit password using
spaced repetition [14]. Each time a participant returned to
6They use the term “password portfolios.”
complete a distractor task he was asked to login by entering his
password. During the ﬁrst login the participant was shown four
additional random characters and asked to type them in after
his password. To encourage participants to memorize these
four characters they would intentionally wait a few seconds
before displaying them to the user the next time he was asked
to login to complete a distractor task. Once a participant was
able to login several times in a row (without waiting for
the characters to be displayed) they would encourage that
participant to memorize four additional random characters in
the same way. They found that 88% of participants were able
to recall their entire password without any prompting three
days after the study was completed.
There are several key difference between their study and
ours: First, in our study participants were asked to memorize
their entire password at the start of the study. By contrast,
Bonneau and Schechter encouraged participants to slowly
memorize their passwords. Second, Bonneau and Schechter
did not tell participants that their goal was to slowly memorize
a strong 56 bit password — users were led to believe that the
distractor task was the purpose of the study. By contrast, in
our study we explicitly told participants that their goal was to
remember their words (without writing them down). Finally,
participants in our study were given fewer chances to rehearse
their passwords and were asked to remember their passwords
over a longer duration of time (4 months vs 2 weeks). Bonneau
and Schechter asked participants to login 90 times over a two
week period. In our study participants were asked to rehearse
at most 12 times over a period of 127+ days. We believe that
the results of our study could be used to help improve the
password strengthening mechanism of Bonneau and Schechter
— see discussion in Section VI.
C. System Assigned Passwords
Empirical studies have shown that many user-selected pass-
words are easily guessable [5]. A user study conducted by Shay
et al. [45] compared several different methods of generating
system assigned passwords for users to memorize (e.g., three to
four random words, 5 or 6 random characters). They found that
users had difﬁculty remembering system assigned passwords
48–120 hours after they had memorized it. In fact, users had
more difﬁculty when asked to memorize three to four random
words from a small dictionary than when they were asked to
remember 5 to 6 random characters. Participants in their study
were not asked to follow any particular mnemonic techniques,
and were not asked to follow a rehearsal schedule.
D. Password Composition Policies
Another line of work on passwords has focused on compo-
sition policies (policies which restrict the space passwords that
users can choose) [39], [46]–[48]. These policies may nega-
tively effect usability (e.g., users report that their passwords are
more difﬁcult to remember [39], [46]) and also have adverse
security effects (e.g., users are more likely to write down their
passwords [46], [48], some restrictive composition policies can
actually result in a weaker password distribution [46], [47]).
VI. DISCUSSION
Password Expiration Policies: Following NIST guide-
lines [13] many organizations require users to change their
12
passwords after certain period of time (e.g.,
thirty days).
The desired behavior is for users to select a random new
password that is uncorrelated with their previous passwords.
We contend that these policies adversely affect usability and
security. Memorizing a new password requires effort and users
are typically only willing to invest a limited amount time and
energy memorizing new passwords. Our experiments indicate
that most of the effort to memorize and rehearse a password
is spent in the ﬁrst week after the new password is chosen. By
forcing users to reset their password frequently an organization
forces its users to remain within the most difﬁcult rehearsal
region. There is strong empirical evidence that users respond
to password expiration policies by selecting weak passwords
and/or selecting new passwords that are highly correlated
with one of their old passwords (e.g., old password+i for
i = 1, 2, . . .) effectively canceling out any security gains
[49]. We contend that a more productive policy would ask
participants to slowly strengthen their passwords over time
using spaced repetition (see discussion below).
Strengthening Passwords Over Time: Our results sug-
gest that the password strengthening mechanism of Bonneau
and Schechter [14] could be improved by adopting the PAO
story mnemonic used in our study and by using a rehearsal
schedule like 24hr×2+2start to help predict when a user has
memorized his new secret. Recall that in their mechanism a
user authenticates by typing in his old password and then by
typing a random character or word that is displayed next to
the password box. To encourage participants to memorize this
secret character/word, the user will not be shown the random
character/word for several seconds, allowing a user who has
memorized the secret to authenticate faster than one who has
not. At some point the mechanism will predict that the user
has memorized his new secret. At this point this secret is
permanently appended to the user’s password so that the user
must remember this secret to authenticate — he can no longer
wait for the character/word to be displayed.
We remark that, instead of requiring the user to memorize a
new random character/word to append to his password, it may
be easier for the user to memorize a random action-object
pair using the PAO mnemonic techniques from this study.
Participants in the mnemonic 24hr×2+2start 1 condition re-
membered their secret action-object pairs perfectly through
128 days with only 9 rehearsals. We also remark that the
24hr×2+2start rehearsal schedule could provide a reasonable
basis for predicting when a user has memorized his new action-
object pair. In particular, a rehearsal schedule could help us
predict how long the user will be able to remember his new
action-object pairs without rehearsing again. If it is safe to
assume that the user will return to authenticate before this
point then we would argue that it is safe to predict that the
user has memorized his secret action-object pair.
Another interesting observation from our study was that
participants in the m 24hr×2 4 condition who remembered
their action-object pairs during the ﬁrst two rehearsal on days
1 and 3 were actually more likely to survive through rehearsal
6 (on day 63) than participants in the m 24hr×2+2start 4
condition who remembered their action-object pairs through
rehearsal 4 (on day 3.6) were to survive through the corre-
sponding rehearsal 8 (on day 63.6) — though this result was
not signiﬁcant at the p = 0.05 level. We hypothesize that
a user’s ability to remember a particular set of action-object
pairs after a challenging rehearsal interval (e.g., only 77% of
participants in the m 24hr×2 4 condition who returned for
the ﬁrst rehearsal on day 1 remembered their action-object
stories) is better indicator of that user’s future success for
those particular action-object pairs than performance on less
challenging rehearsal intervals. This hypothesis could also help
us to predict when a user has memorized a new action-object
pair. However, more studies are necessary to properly test this
hypothesis.
Mitigating Initial Forgetting: We found that much of
the forgetting in our study occurred during the ﬁrst test period.
This ﬁnding leads us to suggest three mechanisms to help
ensure that users will remember their action-object pairs in
the Shared Cues password management scheme: 1) Start with
a shorter initial time gap between the memorization phase and
the ﬁrst rehearsal (e.g., 3 hours or 6 hours). 2) Instruct the
user to wait 12 hours after he has memorized the PAO stories
before using the secret action-object pairs to form passwords.
If the user can still remember his PAO stories after 12 hours
then he can go ahead and use those stories to create passwords.
3) Implement a temporary recovery mechanism which allows
a user who can remember one or two of his action-object
pairs to recover his other action-object pairs during the ﬁrst 24
hours (e.g., 98.6% of participants in the m 12hr×1.5 condition
remembered their ﬁrst action-object pair after 12 hours).
Natural Rehearsals: The usability model of Blocki et
al. [12] was based on an assumption about human memory.
Formally, their expanding rehearsal assumption says that a
user will continue to remember a secret s if he rehearses it at
least once during each of the time intervals [t0, t1) , [t1, t2) , . . .
where t0 = 0 and the length of the i’th interval is ti+1 − ti =
s. Here, σs > 1 is a constant which may depend on
