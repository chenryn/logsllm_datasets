ES 1.4 added support for Children aggregation, which is a really great
feature.  
The next step would be to also support a Parent aggregation
Here is a quick example of a typical use case:  
Let's say we've got 2 types, one containing Product information (name,
description, categories, size, weight, etc) and another one containing
Reseller information (location, price, etc..).  
There is a parent child relationship between Products and Resellers (Product
being the parent)
In some cases, one may want to aggregate on Parent property.
    GET parentchild/reseller/_search/
    {
      "query": {
        ... // not relevant here
      },
      "sort": [
        {
          "price": {
            "order": "asc",
            "mode": "avg"
          }
        }
      ],
      "aggs": {
        "location": {
          "geo_distance": {
            "unit": "km",
            "field": "location",
            "origin": "lat, lon",
            "ranges": [
              { "from": 0, "to": 100},
              ....
            ]
          }
        },
        "price": {
          "range": {
            "field": "price",
            "ranges": [
              { "from": 0, "to": 50},
              ...
            ]
          }
        },
        "aggregateOnParent": {
          "parent": {},
          "aggs": {
              "category": {
                "term": {
                   "field": "category" // Note that category is a field of Product (the parent)
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
