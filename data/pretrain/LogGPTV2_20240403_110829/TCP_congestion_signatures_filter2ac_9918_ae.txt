### 40% of Flows from Comcast in LAX to Cogent Limited by Self-Induced Congestion in Jan-Feb, 75% in Mar-Apr

In the period from January to February, only 40% of flows from Comcast in Los Angeles (LAX) to Cogent were limited by self-induced congestion. This number increased to approximately 75% in March and April. For Verizon, the figures were 40% and nearly 90% for the same ISP and location combination.

### Consistent Self-Induced Congestion for Cox and Level3

In contrast, there was little variation in the fraction of flows from Cox to Cogent and from all ISPs to Level3 that were classified as experiencing self-induced congestion across both time frames. For example, our classifier identified about 80-90% of flows as experiencing self-induced congestion in both periods, with the remaining flows being classified as externally limited (Figure 7b).

### Variability in Self-Induced Congestion for Level3 and Cogent to Cox

For flows from Level3 to all access ISPs and from Cogent to Cox, there was a small difference in the fraction of flows classified as experiencing self-induced congestion between the two time frames. For instance, in Figure 7c, approximately 70% of Cox flows to Level3 were classified as experiencing self-induced congestion in January-February, increasing to around 80% in March-April. This difference is likely due to the use of peak-hour data in January-February and off-peak hour data in March-April, which minimizes potential sources of error in our labeling. Peak hours generally exhibit more variability in throughput tests, leading to a higher likelihood of external congestion during those times compared to off-peak hours.

### Effect of Congestion Threshold on Classification

Figure 7 also illustrates the impact of the congestion threshold used in our model. Higher thresholds result in stricter criteria for estimating self-induced congestion, leading to fewer such events being detected. For example, for the Comcast/LAX/Cogent combination, the fraction of flows classified as experiencing self-induced congestion decreased from 40% to slightly less than 30% as the threshold increased from 0.7 to 0.9. However, changing the threshold did not qualitatively alter the overall trend of the results.

### 5.2 Comparing Throughput of Flows in Two Classes

We validate our classification using an additional insight. In the general case, when there is no sustained congestion affecting all measured flows, we expect externally limited flows to have lower throughput than self-limited flows. By definition, externally limited flows do not attain access link capacity. However, when there is sustained congestion that affects all measured flows, such as at an interconnection point, the throughput of flows experiencing both self-induced and external congestion should be similar. This is because all flows traverse the congested interconnect. Flows through low-capacity access links can still self-induce congestion, while flows through larger access links will not, but the throughputs of flows in either class will be roughly similar.

### Example: Throughput Comparison

Consider a flow traversing a congested interconnect that can achieve X Mbps. For an access link with capacity Y > X, the flow will be externally limited with throughput X. For an access link with capacity Z < X or Z ≈ X, the flow can be access limited with a throughput of Z, which is less than or equal to X. If many flows traverse a congested interconnect, their throughputs will be close, irrespective of whether they experience self-induced or external congestion. Conversely, if there is no sustained congestion at interconnects, the distribution of self-limited throughputs should follow the distribution of access link capacities. Assuming that self-limited and externally-limited flows sample the same population at random, the distribution of externally-limited throughputs should have a lower mean.

### Median Throughput Analysis

Figure 8 shows the median throughput of flows classified as self-induced and externally congested in both the January-February and March-April time frames for Cogent and Level3. In January-February for Cogent, both sets of flows had very similar throughputs for Comcast, Time Warner, and Verizon (Figure 8a). In March-April, Comcast, Time Warner, and Verizon flows classified as self-limited exhibited higher throughput than those constrained by external congestion. As expected, Cox did not show such a difference between the two periods. Flows classified as experiencing self-induced congestion had higher throughput than externally limited flows in both timeframes. Figure 8b shows that in Level3 in Atlanta, which did not experience a congestion event, there was a consistent difference between the two classes of flows.

### 5.3 Robustness of Testbed Training Data

Given that our classification model was built using testbed data, it is natural to question its sensitivity to this data. To address this, we rebuilt the model using data from the Dispute2014 dataset and tested it on itself. Specifically, we split the Dispute2014 dataset into two portions, using one to rebuild the decision tree model and testing it against the other. If our classifier is robust and not sensitive to the testbed data, we would expect similar classification of congestion events using either the model from the controlled experiments or the new model built using the Dispute2014 dataset.

### Model Validation

Our new model uses 20% of the samples from the Dispute2014 dataset, excluding the specific location and ISP being tested. For example, to test Comcast users to Cogent servers in LAX, we built the model using 20% of the Dispute2014 data, excluding that particular combination. Figure 9 shows the results of the classifier using this model. The classification of congestion—the percentage of flows classified as self-induced—follows the same trend as the classification using the testbed data (Figure 7). For the Comcast/LAX/Cogent combination, the fraction of self-induced congestion is about 15% and 55% in January-February and March-April in Figure 9, while it is about 30% and 60% in Figure 7c. Generally, the new model is more conservative in classifying self-limited flows but is qualitatively consistent with the testbed model. This consistency demonstrates that our model is robust to the data used to build it and that the testbed data approximates real-world conditions.

### 5.4 Performance on TSLP2017 Dataset

The TSLP2017 dataset (§ 4.2) contains data from tests conducted between a Comcast access network in Massachusetts and a TATA server in New York. Our labeling criteria are as follows: since the user has a service plan rate of 25 Mbps and a base latency to the M-Lab server of about 18 ms, we label NDT tests with a throughput of less than 15 Mbps and a minimum latency of 30 ms or higher as limited by external congestion. Tests with a throughput exceeding 20 Mbps and a minimum latency less than 20 ms are marked as self-induced. Using these criteria, we identified 2,573 cases of access link congestion and 20 cases of external congestion over the measurement period. Our testbed model accurately classified more than 99% of self-induced congestion events and between 75% and 85% of external congestion events, depending on the parameters used to build the classification model. Lower accuracy corresponds to using lower congestion thresholds (e.g., a congestion threshold of 0.7 and 0.8 in the testbed data corresponded to 75% accuracy, while 0.9 corresponded to 85% accuracy). We also tested the TSLP2017 dataset using the model built with the M-Lab data described in Section 5.3, achieving very similar results for detecting self-induced congestion (more than 90%) and 100% accuracy for external congestion.

### Buffering Observations

The buffering observed in this experiment, both in the access link and the peering link, was small, about 15-20 ms. Even with such a small buffer, which is the worst-case scenario for our model due to its reliance on buffer shaping properties, our model performed accurately, further validating the principles underlying the model.

### 6. Limitations

Our proposed method has several limitations, both in the model and the verification:

- **Reliance on TCP**: Our technique works only on protocols with congestion control, including UDP-based protocols like QUIC, but not for other UDP flows. It will work on paths congested by UDP flows as long as buffering is the same for TCP and UDP.
- **Buffering for Measuring Self-Loading Effect**: Our technique identifies flows that start on a path with sufficient bandwidth to allow the flow to ramp up and significantly impact the flow’s RTT due to a self-loading effect. This relies on a sufficiently sized buffer close to the user (at the DSLAM or CMTS) to create RTT variability. While it is impractical to test all combinations of real-world buffers, our model, built and tested with a wide variety of buffer sizes, yields excellent results. However, there may be cases where buffer occupancy is high enough to affect throughput, but also pushed to maximum occupancy by the flow of interest, or when multiple flows start simultaneously and congest a link. Such scenarios raise questions about whether the flow is self-limiting, and we do not have a way to confirm how frequently this occurs in the wild. These scenarios are also difficult to recreate in the testbed.
- **Other Factors Affecting TCP Flows**: TCP flows can be limited by various factors, including latency, send/receive window, loss, or transient flash-crowding effects. Future work will focus on developing methods to address these limitations.
