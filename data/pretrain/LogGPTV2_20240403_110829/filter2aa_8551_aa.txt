## Solution
This obviously is some kind of cipher, but before decoding it we need to identify it. Practical Cryptography has a good page about [Identifying Unknown Ciphers](http://practicalcryptography.com/cryptanalysis/text-characterisation/identifying-unknown-ciphers/). One of the suggestions is to count the number of unique characters in the cipher (excluding spaces):
```python
>>> c = """HSVNN PBLMS XATWW PEBXT CRRCB MULAA LCDLO MGRKI
... PALAC VXMUE CSWIK GVLQZ DALRC AACQT BZMYA EVSME
... SIXDV CUWMS BLVSR BXGPQ FATUM MSAQV YMVKX QERVB
... FLTSR ATSKE ERQBB XTE"""
>>> "".join(sorted(set(c.replace(" ", "").replace("\n", ""))))
'ABCDEFGHIKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
>>> len("".join(sorted(set(c.replace(" ", "").replace("\n", "")))))
25
```
We have `25` unique characters:
> If there are 26 characters in the ciphertext, it rules out ciphers based on a 5 by 5 grid such as **playfair**, **foursquare** and **bifid**. If the ciphertext is fairly long and only 25 characters are present, it may indicate a cipher in this class has been used.
So there are three suggestion to check. Notice how the missing letter is `J`, which is pretty common for these ciphers (`J` is usually combined with `I`). If we're talking about a cipher that encrypts pairs of letters, this makes it significantly stronger than substitution ciphers since frequency analysis becomes much more difficult.
Studying the two plaintext messages we've received, we can see that both messages start with the pattern of "FROM X TO Y STOP" and end with "STOP". That gives us a [crib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Known-plaintext_attack) - a portion of plaintext that we assume is present in the ciphertext. Having a crib is very helpful in deciphering an encrypted message.
Since the third message is marked as `18 -> CQ` - just like the first one - we'll assume that it starts with "FROM MISTER PHILLIPS TO ALL AGENTS STOP". We'll also assume that it ends with "STOP":

```
We have a few encouraging things here:
* Same letter encryption in `fromm` -> `HSVNN`
* Same letter encryption in `phill` -> `XATWW`
* Same letter encryption in `allag` -> `CRRCB`
* Same letter encryption in `entss` -> `MULAA`
So there's a good chance that we got the crib right.
Now, a few things here tell us that this is not Playfair:
 * In Playfair it's impossible to find a bigram composed of 2 identical letters, but we have `AA` (part of `MULAA`)
 * A Playfair digraph and its reverse (e.g. AB and BA) will decrypt to the same letter pattern in the plaintext (e.g. RE and ER), but we have `il -> TW` and `li -> WP`.
Ruling out Four-Square and Bifid is harder, but it's also pretty hard to crack these ciphers with the information we currently have. So, we return to the description for additional clues. The main thing that stands out in the description is the use of the name "Phillips". As it turns out, that's also the name of a [cipher](https://www.cryptogram.org/downloads/aca.info/ciphers/Phillips.pdf) that seems to fit very well with what we have:
> Starting with a basic 5x5 Polybius square, the first row is shifted down one row at a time form squares #2, 3, 4 and 5. Row two is then shifted down a row at a time to form squares #6, 7 and 8. Each square is  used in turn to encipher 5 plaintext letters. Each plaintext letter is enciphered by taking as substitute the letter diagonally down to the right using the proper square. A plaintext letter in the fifth column is replaced by the letter from the first column and the row below it; a plaintext letter in the fifth row is replaced by the letter in the first row and to its right.
It's worth stopping now and reviewing the example in the link above, since we won't repeat an example here.
As explained in the link, a 5x5 master box is formed from the key, and seven additional boxes are created by swapping rows in the master box. A Python representation of the row order would be:
```python
boxes = [
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
    [1, 0, 2, 3, 4],
    [1, 2, 0, 3, 4],
    [1, 2, 3, 0, 4],
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 0],
    [2, 1, 3, 4, 0],
    [2, 3, 1, 4, 0],
    [2, 3, 4, 1, 0]
]
```
Among other things, this means that for each of the eight columns, the same ciphertext character is replaced by the same plaintext character:
```

   r    r      ss top

```
Now, in order to crack the cipher, we'd like to first understand which letters belonged to which rows. Let's take for example the first character: `f` was encrypted to `H`. This means that in the first box, `f`'s row and `H`'s row were adjacent. We can use the following code to list all adjacent rows:
```python
def adjacent_pairs(lst):
    """
    Returns tuples of adjacent pairs in the list, with wraparound for the last row:
    [1, 2, 3, 0, 4] -> [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (0, 4), (4, 1)]
    """
    length = len(lst)
    for i in range(length):
        yield (lst[i], lst[(i + 1) % length])
```
In our case, that means that `(f, H)` were in rows:
```python
>>> list(adjacent_pairs(boxes[0]))
[(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)]
```
Now let's see what we can learn from combining several constraints. We can see that `t` was encrypted in several columns. For the second, sixth and seventh, it was encrypted to `L`. For the forth, it was encrypted to `X`. We'll check what that means about the row numbers:
```python
>>> list(adjacent_pairs(boxes[1])) # Second
[(1, 0), (0, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1)]
>>> list(adjacent_pairs(boxes[5])) # Sixth
[(2, 1), (1, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (0, 2)]
>>> list(adjacent_pairs(boxes[6])) # Seventh
[(2, 3), (3, 1), (1, 4), (4, 0), (0, 2)]
>>> list(adjacent_pairs(boxes[3])) # Forth
[(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (0, 4), (4, 1)]
```
Since for the first three boxes, `t` was encrypted to the same letter (`L`), it means that the rows for `t` and `L` were adjacent in all of these permutations. The only pair that appears in all three is `(0, 2)`, so we can conclude that `t` is on row `0` and `L` is on row `2`. We can also immediately learn from this that `X` is on the forth row, since now `(0, 4)` is the only pair that can match `t`'s placement for the forth box.
We can continue to deduce row placements this way. For example, let's look at `i`. `i` got encrypted to `P` for the second and forth boxes, and to `T` for the third box:
```python
>>> list(adjacent_pairs(boxes[1]))
[(1, 0), (0, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1)]
>>> list(adjacent_pairs(boxes[3]))
[(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (0, 4), (4, 1)]
>>> list(adjacent_pairs(boxes[2]))
[(1, 2), (2, 0), (0, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1)]
```
The common pair for the second and forth boxes are: `(2, 3), (4, 1)`. But we already know that `t` is on the first row, so based on the pairs of the third box we can select `(2, 0)` for `i -> T`, meaning `i` is on the third row and therefore the correct pair is `(2, 3)` (placing `P` on the forth row).
We can continue this way making placements given that:
 * If a character `x` gets encrypted to a character `Y` for multiple columns(/boxes), we can rule out any pair that doesn't exist in all these columns
 * If a character `x` get encrypted to `Y` for some columns and to `Z` for other columns, we can rule out any pairs which are common to all these columns
 * If a placement in a pair contradicts an already known placement, we can rule it out
It's actually not that hard to solve the challenge manually, given these constraints. Kind of like solving a Sudoku. For the sake of the writeup we'll use the following script though:
