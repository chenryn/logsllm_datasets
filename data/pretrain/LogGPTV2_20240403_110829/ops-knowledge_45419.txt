User: I am a new Mac (Snow Leopard) user and I found that Python is pre-installed in Mac OS X. What is the difference between Mac OS X pre-installed Python and the one from Python.org?
If I install the one from Python.org, will it break anything? Will it be redundant?
EDIT
What would be a good reason to prefer the Python.org version, comparing identical version numbers head-to-head?
Assistant: It's impossible to tell without knowing which version(s) you're comparing. You're best off doing python --version on your default OS X install, and then checking release notes from that version to subsequent versions. My guess (I don't have OS X) is that you're likely running 2.4.x or 2.5.x. There'll be very few regressive differences from 2.4.x forward on the 2.x version tree. Python 3.x introduces syntax changes, which will break some existing code. Perhaps the most visible change is print becomes a function in 3.0, while still a statement in 2.x.
In general, amongst 2.x, syntax is only enhanced, not broken. The changes are going to be more in the libraries (i.e. the md5 module is deprecated at 2.6 in favor of the hashlib module).
