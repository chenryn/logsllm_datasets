I am new to binary conversion and I use Python, Bash, and AWK regularly. I am interested in understanding the practical applications of binary conversion in these languages. Specifically, I would like to see examples of how binary conversion is used to solve real-world problems in your work.

Could you provide some insights into where and how binary conversion is utilized in Python, Bash, and AWK? Additionally, I would appreciate seeing some code examples.

In newer versions of Python, I understand that there is a `bin()` function, which takes an integer and returns its binary representation as a string, prefixed with '0b'. For example, `bin(26)` would return `'0b11010'`.

Thank you for your help!
