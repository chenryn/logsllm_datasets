User: I am new in binary conversion.
I use Python, Bash and AWK daily.
I would like to see binary conversion's applications in these languages.
For example, I am interested in problems which you solve by it at your work.
Where do you use binary conversion in Python/Bash/AWK?
I would like to see examples of codes.
Assistant: In newer versions of Python there exists the bin() function which I believe takes an int and returns a binary literal, of form 0b011010 or whatever.
