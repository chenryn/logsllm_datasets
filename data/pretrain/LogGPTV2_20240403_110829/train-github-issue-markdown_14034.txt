Firstly, thank you for providing such excellent tools for end-to-end testing.

I was wondering if it is currently possible to perform component testing similar to what Cypress offers. Specifically, I am referring to the ability to render a React component and assert the results, as described in the Cypress documentation: [Component Testing Introduction](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/component-testing/introduction).

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
