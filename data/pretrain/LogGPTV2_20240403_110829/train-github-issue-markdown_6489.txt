### Issue Type:
Bug Report

### Ansible Version:
1.7.2

### Environment:
Debian Sid

### Summary:
When using the playbook from the gist at [https://gist.github.com/anonymous/dc1de03995dc9ae147af](https://gist.github.com/anonymous/dc1de03995dc9ae147af), Ansible 1.7.1 correctly inserts a line with `synchronous_standby_names=''` in the configuration file. However, with Ansible 1.7.2, it incorrectly enforces a line with `synchronous_standby_names=`.

I have confirmed that this issue is specific to the difference between Ansible 1.7.1 and 1.7.2 by switching between the two versions using the following commands:
```sh
sudo dpkg -i /var/cache/apt/archives/ansible_1.7.1+dfsg-1_all.deb
sudo dpkg -i /var/cache/apt/archives/ansible_1.7.2+dfsg-1_all.deb
```

After reviewing the Debian patches applied, I do not believe they are related to this issue. A `git bisect` may be necessary to identify the exact commit causing this problem.

### Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use the task defined in the linked gist.
2. Run the playbook with Ansible 1.7.2.

### Expected Results:
The configuration file should contain the line `synchronous_standby_names=''`.

### Actual Results:
The configuration file contains the line `synchronous_standby_names=` instead.
