##### Issue Type:
Bug Report
##### Ansible Version:
1.7.2
##### Environment:
Debian Sid
##### Summary:
Using the gist at https://gist.github.com/anonymous/dc1de03995dc9ae147af in
ansible 1.7.1 correctly forces a line with `synchronous_standby_names=''` in
it.
With 1.7.2, it enforces a line with `synchronous_standby_names=`.
I have confirmed it is definitely a difference between 1.7.1 & 1.7.2 by
swapping between:  
sudo dpkg -i /var/cache/apt/archives/ansible_1.7.1+dfsg-1_all.deb  
sudo dpkg -i /var/cache/apt/archives/ansible_1.7.2+dfsg-1_all.deb
Looking at the patches debian applies, that shouldn't be related. Time for a
git bisect!
##### Steps To Reproduce:
Use the task in the linked gist.
##### Expected Results:
A line with `synchronous_standby_names=''` should appear in the file.
##### Actual Results:
`synchronous_standby_names=` appears in the file.
