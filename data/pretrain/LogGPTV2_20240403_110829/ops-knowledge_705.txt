User:  Please describe the "three-way handshake" in the network and its role.
Assistant: "Three-way handshake" refers to the process of establishing a network connection in the TCP/IP protocol. The process is as follows: The first handshake: the client sends a request packet with a SYN (synchronization) flag (that is, a SYN packet) to the server, requesting to establish connect. The second handshake: After receiving the request packet, the server sends a response packet (ie SYN/ACK packet) with the SYN/ACK (synchronization/confirmation) flag to the client, indicating that it confirms the request and agrees to establish a connection. The third handshake: the client sends a response packet (ie, ACK packet) with the ACK (confirmation) flag to the server again, indicating that the request has been received and the connection has been established. The role of the three-way handshake is to ensure that the connection between the client and the server can be successfully established. The first handshake is when the client requests to establish a connection, the second handshake is when the server confirms the request and agrees to establish a connection, and the third handshake is when the client confirms the server's confirmation message. The purpose of the three-way handshake is to prevent repeated connection requests, ensure the reliability and stability of the connection, and avoid wasting server resources.
