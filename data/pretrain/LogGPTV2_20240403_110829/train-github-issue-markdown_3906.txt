When I attempt to access the list of extensions in Visual Studio Code, the list is displayed. However, when I click on an extension (e.g., `Elm`), I encounter the following error:

```
Error: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND marketplace.visualstudio.com marketplace.visualstudio.com:443
```

Visual Studio Code was launched from the command line with the following environment variables set for proxy configuration:

```sh
> set | grep proxy
https_proxy=http://user:pw@ip:port
http_proxy=http://user:pw@ip:port
```

The system proxy is configured using an "Automatic configuration script" via a `.pac` file.

If I start Visual Studio Code without setting these environment variables, the same error occurs even when loading the list of extensions.

Thank you for your continued efforts and support.
