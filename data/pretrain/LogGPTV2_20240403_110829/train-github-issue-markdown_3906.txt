The List of extensions is displayed, but when I click on one iE `Elm` it shows
`Error` `getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND marketplace.visualstudio.com
marketplace.visualstudio.com:443`
Vscode was started from the commandline with
    >set | grep proxy
    https_proxy=http://user:pw@ip:port
    http_proxy=http://user:pw@ip:port
System proxy is defined though an `Automatic configuration script` via th url
of a *.pac file.  
When I start `vscode` from start, without those environment variables, the
above error shows already when loading the list of extensions.
PS. Thanks for the great work.
