User: Where can I download _winreg for python3 if I can at all. I have my 'windir' on E:\Windows. I do not know if cx_Freeze did not notice that. I am using cx_Freeze to create an msi installer.
Assistant: I know this is an old question, but this was the first search result when Googling for ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_winreg', and perhaps may be helpful for someone.
I got the same error when trying to use a virtual environment folder, which has been created using different (already deleted) python binaries. The solution was recreate the virtual environment:

Delete the virtual environment folder
Run python -m venv <name_of_virtual_environment>
