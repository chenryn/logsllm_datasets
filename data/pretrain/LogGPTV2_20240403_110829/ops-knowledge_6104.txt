**Question:**
Where can I download `_winreg` for Python 3, if it is available at all? My `windir` is located at `E:\Windows`. I am not sure if `cx_Freeze` recognizes this. I am using `cx_Freeze` to create an MSI installer.

**Answer:**
I understand that this question may be somewhat dated, but it was the top search result when I looked up "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_winreg'." This response might still be helpful to someone encountering the same issue.

I faced a similar error when working with a virtual environment that was created using different (and now deleted) Python binaries. The solution was to recreate the virtual environment. Here are the steps to do so:

1. **Delete the existing virtual environment folder.**
2. **Recreate the virtual environment** by running the following command:
   ```sh
   python -m venv <name_of_virtual_environment>
   ```

This should resolve the `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_winreg'` issue.
