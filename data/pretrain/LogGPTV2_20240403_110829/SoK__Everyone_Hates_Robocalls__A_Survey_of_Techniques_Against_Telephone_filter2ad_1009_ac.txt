ratio [33], [48], [51], [53], [54], simultaneous calls [46],
and caller’s domain behavior [32], [51]. There are also
many opportunities to improve the technique by developing
better classiﬁcation algorithms. Acquiring the caller’s
behavioral information usually requires participation from
the caller’s telephony service provider or a honeypot of
telephones [33], [35]. If not required by regulation, it is
usually not in the TSP’s business interest to report on or
impose a call behavior restriction on their callers. The
callers’ behavioral information would need to be updated
[47]–[49],
frequently to ensure accuracy and freshness in order to be
effective. Large scale collection of callers’ call behavior
could also face privacy issues and numerous obstacles from
legal regulations. Because the call behavior of a caller is
associated with the caller’s phone number, a spammer could
defeat the Caller Reputation System by spooﬁng the caller
ID to a number with good calling behavior. Furthermore, a
spammer could hide its illegitimate call behaviors by using
multiple caller identities.
Device Fingerprinting collects a variety of metadata from
the call request header for the purpose of creating a device
ﬁngerprint of a caller’s terminal. Device ﬁngerprinting
improves the accuracy of determining the caller’s identity
by using only a set of information that meets the properties
of diversity and stability. Device Fingerprinting has been
proposed for SPIT prevention by blacklisting or whitelisting
the device ﬁngerprints of SIP-based terminals
[55].
However,
information is a
scarce resource. This is due to the little amount of header
information in PSTN call requests (an example of which is
shown in Table III in the Appendix) compared to SIP or
email, resulting in having too little workable information
for device ﬁngerprinting to work effectively.
in PSTN, device ﬁngerprint
Caller ID Anomaly Detection searches for anomalous
patterns in the caller ID, such as invalid format, invalid
number, unavailable number, toll-free number, area codes,
regular expression, to determine if the caller is a spammer.
Caller ID Anomaly Detection is quite easy to implement and
requires very little computational resources and, therefore,
is easy to ﬁnd in several call blocking apps [56], [57].
Caller ID Anomaly Detection does not track information
associated with any individual caller,
looks
for general patterns in the caller ID that can be used to
differentiate spammers and legitimate callers. As Caller
ID Anomaly Detection tend to ﬁnd matches more broadly,
it tends to be easier to manage and maintain. However,
some patterns may be potentially prone to false negatives,
and therefore may restrict some legitimate callers, such as
VoIP users or privacy enabled callers. A spammer could
defeat Caller ID Anomaly Detection by carefully crafting
the caller ID to not trigger any known anomalous patterns.

ANI-CPN Matching checks whether the Calling Party
Number (CPN) captured by the caller ID service matches
with the Automatic Number Identiﬁcation (ANI) number
captured by the ANI service [58]. Automatic Number
Identiﬁcation service [59] is a separate type of calling line
identiﬁcation service that can capture the calling number
information even when the caller ID is not presented. It
was originally designed to obtain the calling party’s billing
number from a local exchange carrier to any interconnecting
carrier for billing of long distance calls. In most cases,

the billing number is the same as the CPN, and usually
when a mismatch happens it
is likely due to caller ID
spooﬁng, or the caller is calling from a private branch
exchange (PBX). ANI-CPN Matching assumes that a
legitimate caller’s CPN matches the ANI number whereas
a malicious caller would spoof the CPN which results in
a mismatch. However, ANI service are usually not made
available to regular consumers (usually only offered to
800 toll-free, 900 premium-rate, or 911 emergency service
lines), therefore, only some businesses would beneﬁt from
this technique. ANI service is also not always reliable at
capturing the caller’s ANI number. Placing a legitimate call
using an outbound VoIP service or a calling card service
would result in a non-working or a generic ANI number
being captured. As a result, false positives may frequently
occur which hinders user acceptance.
ANI-II Filtering can be used to ﬁlter spam calls by
blocking certain types of origin service captured by the
ANI-II service. ANI-II [60] is an extension of the ANI
service that identiﬁes the type of service associated with the
originating switch. Each type of service is represented by
a two-digit code. ANI-II Filtering assumes that legitimate
callers would have a valid (00 or 61) ANI-II code, whereas,
malicious callers would be making VoIP calls that would
have an invalid ANI Failure (02) code, and therefore
should be blocked. However, with the growing use of
VoIP service by regular consumers, this technique could
potentially result in too many false positives if all calls
with ANI Failure codes are blocked. Only some businesses
would beneﬁt from an implementation of this technique, as
ANI-II service is usually offered only to premium-rate, toll-
free, or emergency lines. Therefore, this technique would
not be accessible or cost effective for the regular consumers.
B. Voice Interactive Screening
Voice Interactive Screening is a category of techniques
that forces the caller to interact with a voice input-based
interactive system and decide if the call
is spam after
analyzing the caller’s interaction. The system either requires
active or passive interaction from the caller. An active
interaction system relies on the caller providing a response
to a speciﬁc task which requires some effort from the
caller, whereas a passive interaction system silently gathers
the caller’s response without explicitly informing the caller.
Voice Interactive Screening techniques do not need to
rely on the caller ID or any other call request header
information, hence they are generally not vulnerable to
caller ID spooﬁng. However, Voice Interactive Screening
techniques generally require processing of audio signals,
which tends to be more complex to implement. Because
these techniques can only work after recording a length of
the caller’s voice, all Voice Interactive Screening techniques
a screening period,
therefore, would introduce
have
additional delay to the caller. Due to the recording of the
caller’s voice during the screening, in the US, some states
require explicit consent of
recording the conversation,
which could hinder the screening process or invoke privacy
fears from some legitimate callers. As telephone audio
can be manipulated, and tends to contain artifacts such as
background noise, network dropouts, or compression losses,
Voice Interactive Screening techniques are generally more
prone to errors.
Audio Fingerprinting uses the voice recording of the
caller, or audio features extracted from the voice recording
of the caller, to analyze for similarity to a set of known
spam call proﬁles. If the voice recording is similar to an
audio stream of a known spam proﬁle, then the call is
classiﬁed as spam. Audio Fingerprinting has been proposed
to combat replayed voice spam in several works [61]–[67].
However, the performance of Audio Fingerprinting depends
on the completeness of spam proﬁles, which is usually not
feasible for a recipient
to collect. Audio Fingerprinting
would usually require a thirty-party to continuously collect
and maintain the known-spam audio proﬁles to ensure
effectiveness. However, a spammer could potentially defeat
the mechanism by dynamically creating variations of the
spam audio message (such as adding audio artifacts or
using personalized messages) to avoid identiﬁcation.
Speech Content Analysis ﬁrst records the caller’s voice,
then makes use of
speech recognition technology to
transcribe the voice into text. The text is then analyzed with
text proﬁles of known spam calls to classify if the call is
spam. As opposed to managing audio recordings, a corpus
of text data is usually much easier to manage. As many spam
calls are simply variations of a call script, a keywords-based
classiﬁcation model could be used against variations of a
same type of spam [68]. However, the effectiveness of this
technique depends on the accuracy of speech recognition,
and of course the effectiveness of the classiﬁcation model.
In practice, automatic speech recognition of telephone voice
is an ongoing research problem [69], which tends to be
prone to errors, and still has several years to go to reach
human-level performance [70].
Acoustic Pattern Analysis extracts distinguishing acoustic
patterns from the caller’s audio stream, such as signal
losses [71], peak uniformity [71], noise uniformity [71],
voice activity [72], [73], and double talks [72]–[74],
to
determine if the call is spam. Audio Fingerprinting looks
for general patterns in the audio signal that can broadly
distinguish spam calls from legitimate calls. Unlike Audio
Fingerprinting and Speech Content Analysis, Acoustic
Pattern Analysis does not require a large collection of
known-spam proﬁles, which could be difﬁcult to gather and

maintain. However, some patterns may be prone to false
positives and could be easily defeated with manipulation of
the audio stream.
is
an interactive
CAPTCHA/Turing Test
challenge-
response technique that requires the caller to complete a
reverse Turing test to determine whether the caller is a
human or robocaller. The tests are designed to be difﬁcult
for a computer but easy for a human to complete. For
instance, the test could ask the caller to key in what they
hear from a distorted audio stream of random numbers [75]–
[77]. However, CAPTCHA/Turing Test would need to be
careful not to discriminate against certain groups of people,
such as people with poor English or disabilities, while
not giving too much leeway for abuse by “decaptcha"
systems [78]. On the other hand, CAPTCHA/Turing Test
would also need to be careful not
to be illegible even
for users with no handicaps, as the legitimate caller may
become irritated by the obstacles of initiating a call with
the recipient. Because CAPTCHA/Turing Test
is highly
interactive, it tends to require a high degree of effort, and
cause signiﬁcant delays to the caller.
C. Caller Compliance
Caller Compliance is a category of techniques that require
the caller to ﬁrst satisfy a compliance requirement prior
to or during a call request. If the caller is able to satisfy
the compliance requirement, then the caller is allowed to
communicate with the recipient. Satisfying the requirements
should be easy for a legitimate caller but difﬁcult (or
costly) for a spammer. Some compliance measures require
special changes made to the call setup process or to the
communicating terminals. Some techniques require prior
instructions given to the caller.
to substantial ﬁnes if they fail
Do Not Call Registry simply provides a registry of
phone numbers that spammers are legally prohibited from
calling in most circumstances. The spammer may be
subject
to comply. The
registry is usually maintained by the national government,
in the US [22],
is maintained by the Federal
Trade Commission. However, the recipients would need to
actively provide feedbacks for the government to legally act
on spammers violating the law. The Do Not Call Registry
can act as a good deterrence for domestic law-abiding
telemarketers, however it would have little effectiveness on
spoofed numbers and overseas spammers.

Graylisting [79] ﬁrst rejects the initial call request from a
caller and then accepts the next call request from the same
caller made within a short period of time. This technique
defends against autodialers that simply call a list of phone
numbers and do not make repeated call attempts. The
328328
legitimate business,
technique also assumes that if an uninformed (about the
defense) caller is calling about
the
caller will
try again. The implementation is simple and
does not require changes to the infrastructure. However,
the legitimate caller must make two calls for every call
request, which introduces additional delay and calling cost.
A spammer could easily defeat the Graylisting mechanism
by conﬁguring the autodialer to automatically call again
if a call goes unanswered, but at the cost of higher phone
bills and reduced efﬁciency.
Consent-based Communication ﬁrst requires the caller to
send a consent request to the recipient before initiating a
call. For instance, the request could be a forwarded greeting
message where an answering machine ﬁrst records the
name spoken with the caller’s voice and then plays it to
the recipient [80]–[82]. The recipient then decides whether
to accept the caller’s request to communicate. If the call
is spam,
is only limited to being exposed
to an abridged recording (or the request message) of the
spam call. However, the recipient is still disturbed for every
unconsented caller,
is not scalable, and the
recipient is not spared from the disturbance of a spam call.
It also adds delay to each call, as legitimate callers are
forced to wait for consent before each call.

Call Back Veriﬁcation ﬁrst rejects an initial call from
a caller, then forces the caller to wait for the recipient
to call back the caller. Call Back Veriﬁcation is a good
defense against caller ID spooﬁng, as it forces the caller
to provide a genuine caller ID. The basic mechanism is
simple, and some implementations try to automate this
process [83], [84]. However, it requires the caller to ﬁrst
own a reachable inbound number, which could restrict
communication from legitimate VoIP users and telephone
extension terminals. Call Back Veriﬁcation also add delays
to each communication, as the legitimate caller must wait
for the recipient to call back. Calling back could also add
calling cost on both the caller and recipient in PSTN, which
can be especially signiﬁcant for premium or international
numbers.

ﬁrst need to share the weakly secret

callers would also be restricted from communicating with

Payment at Risk is a micropayment, cost-based, technique
where the caller is required to deposit a small amount
of money before making a call. If the recipient reports
that the call is spam, then the deposit is conﬁscated or
kept by the recipient, otherwise the money is refunded
to the caller. This was proposed as a method for SIP
spam prevention [38]. This technique prevents spamming
by making it prohibitively expensive to send out a
large amount of spam calls, while costing very little
for legitimate callers. However,
the solution requires a
universal micropayment system that collects payment on
every call, which may require signiﬁcant resources to create
and administer. There also are many questions regarding
the legality of this approach, for instance on the lawful
conﬁscation of payments and abuse of spam reporting. The
value amount of the deposit would also affect the number of
recipients needed to report on the spam caller to effectively
make spamming unproﬁtable.
Proof of Work is a computational, cost-based, technique
where the caller’s terminal is required to produce a proof-
of-work, such as hashcash [86], that is moderately hard to
compute (being computational or memory-bound) but easy
for the recipient to verify, before allowing communication
with the recipient. As the amount of work increases,
it would be prohibitively inefﬁcient
to distribute large
amounts of spam calls. A legitimate caller would not be
signiﬁcantly affected for making a few number of calls. On
one hand, Proof of Work has an advantage over Payment
at Risk by not requiring a micropayment system, therefore
avoiding the administrative and legality issues. On the other
hand, Proof of Work faces a trade-off problem between
permissiveness and anti-spam effectiveness. In PSTN, due
to the signiﬁcant share of low-end telephone terminals, the
difﬁculty of the work would need to be low enough to
ensure permissiveness. However, this may allow a spammer
using moderately powerful computerized terminals to easily
generate as much work as needed for spamming. Legitimate
callers with high outbound calls, such as a bank, may
also be obstructed from doing legitimate business if it
is prohibitively costly to generate the proof-of-works to
contact a large number of customers.
Proof of Identity requires the caller to send a veriﬁable
identity token that would authenticate the credentials of
the caller whenever making a call. This technique has
been proposed for SIP domain users [83], [87]–[89], due
to the availability of SSL/TLS certiﬁcates and maturity of
the underlying public key infrastructure. This technique
prevents spamming by ensuring that the caller could be held
responsible for making illegal calls, and prevents scams by
ensuring that the caller cannot impersonate as someone else.
Proof of Identity could also prevent a spammer from using
multiple identities when identity veriﬁcation is required.
Proof of Identity has an advantage over Proof of Work by
not having the issue of deciding the right difﬁculty level
of proof-of-work which could either obstruct calls from
low-end telephone terminals or give too much leeway for
spamming. However, the scheme could be hard to deploy
in PSTN, as it would require establishment of a certiﬁcate
authority for issuing and verifying caller identities, and may
require signiﬁcant changes to the call request protocols in
PSTN.
V. ASSESSMENT CRITERIA
It is clear that there is no shortage of techniques to combat
telephone spam, but what would an ideal telephone spam
defense entail? Therefore, we propose a set of assessment
criteria.
We separate the assessment criteria into three categories:
(1) Usability, which evaluates the ease-of-use from either
the caller or recipient’s perspective, (2) Deployability, which
evaluates the ease of installation, deployment, and opera-
tion, and (3) Robustness, which evaluates the technique’s
resilience against errors and effectiveness against a spammer
actively evading the defense. We deﬁne each of the identiﬁed
criteria and give a mnemonic name.
A. Usability Criteria
No-Disturbance-to-Recipient When a known-spam call
arrives, the technique does not disturb the recipient, such
as prompting for additional action from the recipient.
Scalable-for-Recipient The technique does not increase the
burden of work on the recipient with an increasing number
of spam calls. The technique can handle a large variety of
spam calls with minimal input from the recipient.
Effortless-for-Caller When initiating a call, the technique
requires minimal or zero effort from the caller.
Negligible-Changes-to-Call-Setups The technique requires
