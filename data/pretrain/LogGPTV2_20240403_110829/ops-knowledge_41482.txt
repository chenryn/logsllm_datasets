Assistant: 1. Data Backup: Back up your database regularly and store the backups in a safe location to prevent data loss or corruption. 2. Access control: Control the access rights of data in the database, authorize users to access the required data, and limit the scope of data they access to avoid data leakage or misuse. 3. Encryption: Use encryption technology to protect sensitive data in the database to prevent unauthorized access or eavesdropping. 4. Security audit: monitor database access and data changes, discover and deal with abnormal behaviors in a timely manner, and prevent security vulnerabilities from being exploited. 5. Close unnecessary ports: Close unnecessary ports in the database to prevent hacker attacks. 6. Update and maintenance: update the database software in time, install security patches and updates, and prevent known security vulnerabilities from being attacked. 7. Strengthen password policy: Set a strong password policy, force users to use strong passwords, and change passwords regularly to avoid password guessing and brute force attacks.
