User: How to implement single sign-on (SSO) and two-factor authentication (2FA)?
Assistant: Single sign-on (SSO) implementation: 1. Based on authentication protocols: use common authentication protocols to achieve single sign-on, such as OAuth, OpenID Connect, etc.; 2. Integrated identity provider (IDP): integrate multiple applications into one In the identity provider, the identity provider can provide authentication credentials to other applications in the form of tokens after the user is authenticated; 3. Use SSO software: use professional SSO software, such as CAS (Central Authentication Service) Can help with SSO. Two-factor authentication (2FA) implementation method: 1. SMS verification code: After entering the password when logging in, the system will send a verification code SMS to the user's mobile phone, and the correct verification code must be entered to complete the login; 2. One-time password device: the user Generate a password through the one-time password generator, and use this password to log in; 3. Identity verification application: the user downloads and installs the identity verification application, and after entering the account password, the application will generate a temporary password, which is used for verification when logging in; 4 . Fingerprint scanning: The system uses the fingerprint function of the device for identity verification, and logs in after successful verification. Generally speaking, neither SSO nor 2FA are separate security applications, but need to be implemented in combination with specific application scenarios and requirements. Various implementation methods have advantages and disadvantages, and need to be selected according to the specific situation.
