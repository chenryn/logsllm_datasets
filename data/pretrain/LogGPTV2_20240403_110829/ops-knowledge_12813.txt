**User:**
I am trying to build Android from source on Ubuntu 10.04. When I run the following `repo` command:
```sh
repo init -u git://android.git.kernel.org/platform/manifest.git -b eclair
```
I receive this error message:
```
exec: 23: python: not found
```
Do you have any ideas on how to resolve this?

**Assistant:**
It appears that the `repo` command, which is a Python script developed by Google for interacting with Git repositories, is unable to find the Python interpreter on your system. Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. **Check Python Installation:**
   Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can check this by running:
   ```sh
   python --version
   ```
   If Python is not installed, you can install it using the package manager:
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install python
   ```

2. **Verify Python in PATH:**
   Make sure that Python is included in your system's PATH. You can check the current PATH by running:
   ```sh
   echo $PATH
   ```
   If the directory containing the Python executable (usually `/usr/bin`) is not listed, you may need to add it to your PATH. You can do this by adding the following line to your `.bashrc` or `.profile` file:
   ```sh
   export PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin
   ```

3. **Python Version Compatibility:**
   The `repo` tool may require a specific version of Python. For example, it might need Python 2.5, while you might have a different version installed. Check the required Python version for `repo` and ensure you have the correct version installed. If you need to install a specific version, you can use a tool like `pyenv` to manage multiple Python versions.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `python: not found` error and successfully initialize the `repo` command.
