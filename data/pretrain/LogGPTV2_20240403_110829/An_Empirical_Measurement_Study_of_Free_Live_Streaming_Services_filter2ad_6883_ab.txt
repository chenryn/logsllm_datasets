### Video Stalls and Quality Switches

Video stalls, also known as rebuffering, are the most noticeable streaming artifacts for users [9]. When the player's buffer does not have sufficient new data, it causes a pause in playback, referred to as a stall. Studies indicate that the number of stalls has the highest impact on Quality of Experience (QoE) [9]. In our measurements from a fast campus network, we did not observe any stalls with legitimate sports streaming websites. Although all NHL free live streaming (FLS) providers experienced quality switches, none of them stalled during video playback. However, the majority of other FLS service providers experienced multiple stalls. The number of rebuffering events observed for each streaming site is detailed in Table 3 in the Appendix.

### QUIC vs. TCP for Live Streaming

TCP is the predominant transport-layer protocol used by FLS services. It is well-suited for video streaming and is widely used in web and mobile applications. For example, MPEG-DASH is an HTTP-based adaptive bitrate streaming technique for delivering high-quality media content over the Internet. Our observations show that 18 out of 20 FLS websites use TCP. One FLS provider uses UDP, and another uses Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS), which provides security guarantees over UDP. Interestingly, both legitimate providers deliver live streaming via UDP-based solutions. We noted that TSN delivers live video streams using QUIC [19].

#### Experimental Setup

To evaluate the impact of QUIC on live streaming performance in different network settings, we conducted tests using the Google Chrome browser. By default, Chrome supports QUIC, but we disabled this feature to stream live video over TCP. Although TCP Cubic is the default congestion control algorithm in QUIC [14], the specific algorithm used by QUIC version 50 on the TSN site was unknown to us. We used the `netem` functionality of the `tc` Linux command to introduce delay, packet loss, and bandwidth limits. Key metrics included startup delay, average received throughput, and the number of quality switches.

We performed all measurements on a Linux PC using Google Chrome for live streaming in both wired and WiFi settings. Figure 4 shows selected results, with full results in Table 4 in the Appendix. Each session lasted 100 seconds, and we cleared the browser’s cache and history before each session. All video streams were from the same IP address. Given that recent studies show minimal improvements with QUIC in low-delay and low-loss networks [2], we set high latency and loss to highlight the impacts of using QUIC.

#### Network Type

- **Wired Connection**: Enabling QUIC did not affect startup time, but the average received throughput was slightly better than with TCP.
- **WiFi Connection**: QUIC had a lower average startup time than TCP. However, the received throughput with TCP was slightly higher than with QUIC.

#### Delay

- **500 ms Delay**: QUIC started playing the video with a lower startup delay than TCP in both wired and WiFi connections. Over WiFi, TCP performed significantly worse than QUIC, with higher startup times, lower throughput, and more quality switches.

#### Loss

- **25% Packet Loss**: Both QUIC and TCP experienced reduced throughput, but QUIC achieved higher throughput, allowing for higher resolution video streaming. This is a key advantage of QUIC during popular games that induce network congestion and packet loss.

#### Bandwidth

- **8 Mbps Bandwidth**: TCP connections in both wired and WiFi networks had higher received throughput compared to QUIC. Traces showed that the server used three concurrent TCP connections, with data balanced across each connection. QUIC performed worse, with higher startup times, lower throughput, and more quality switches in limited bandwidth WiFi networks.

### Privacy Analysis

The privacy analysis results for FLS sports websites are summarized in Figure 5 and Table 5 in the Appendix.

#### HTTP vs. HTTPS

- **HTTPS**: Legitimate sports streaming sites use HTTPS.
- **HTTP**: Most FLS sites use HTTP. Reasons include the cost of SSL certificates, extra CPU processing for encryption, and frequent domain changes. Thus, they opt for HTTP.

#### Ad and Tracking Services

- **Ad and Tracking**: Both FLS and legitimate sites connect users to advertising and tracking services. Legitimate sites mostly connect to known trackers like Facebook and Google Analytics, while FLS sites expose users to malicious trackers such as onclicksuper.com, which redirects browsers to unwanted advertisements. Some tracking services, like google-analytics.com, appear in both types of sites.

#### Overlay Ads and Offered Applications

- **Overlay Ads**: FLS sites use various techniques to show overlay and pop-up ads, often tricking users into clicking fake close buttons, leading to multiple ads. These violate online advertising standards, degrade QoE, and expose users to potential malware.
- **Applications**: Some FLS sites offer complimentary mobile apps for watching free live sports. These apps often contain ad packages, display ads without user consent, and trigger potential ad fraud.

#### Browser Security

- **Sandboxing**: Sandboxing runs the browser in a low-permission mode, but some users bypass these warnings when accessing FLS sites. Ad-blockers can protect against deceptive ads, but some FLS providers use anti-ad-blocking techniques or refuse to serve users with ad-blockers.

#### Cookies

- **Cookies**: Both FLS and legitimate sites install third-party advertising and tracking cookies. For example, visiting the TSN site results in 76 cookies from 38 different third-party sites, 18 of which are tracking sites. DAZN, on the other hand, alerts users about cookie use and installs fewer cookies.

#### Data Leaks

- **POST Requests**: Some FLS sites send user information such as IP address, ISP, city, device name, OS, and browser version to tracking sites. TSN uses a single POST method to perform multiple GET and POST requests, potentially hiding these from browsers and security tools.

### Related Work

- **Early Work**: The book "Globalization and Football" [11] discussed the impact of emerging FLS platforms. Birmingham et al. [4] studied FLS for England’s Premier League, noting parallels to the music industry's piracy issues.
- **Recent Studies**: Raﬁque et al. [25] explored the FLS ecosystem and analyzed the advertising content. Ayers et al. [1] offered a solution to automatically discover FLS domains and observed that despite improved privacy mechanisms, users still face scams and deceptive ads. Kariyawasam et al. [16] studied copyright concerns in FLS. Bronzino et al. [5] developed models for deriving video quality metrics from encrypted streams. Biernacki et al. [3] conducted a thorough simulation study on video streaming under different network conditions.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we presented a measurement study of FLS sites to identify trade-offs in performance (network QoS and video QoS) and privacy/security. Our main findings include:
- Long broadcasting delays in free live streams.
- Varying throughput, streaming quality, and packet loss rates across FLS sites.
- TSN uses QUIC, which benefits more in WiFi networks with high delay and loss.
- The FLS ecosystem continues to flourish, but users pay the cost through uncertain service quality and inherent privacy/security risks.

### Ethical Considerations

Studying illegal FLS services raises ethical concerns. We adhered to fair dealing exceptions and minimized our impact on visit numbers. Our study was conducted in a controlled lab environment, and we collected no personal data. All captured data are publicly available for future studies [17].
