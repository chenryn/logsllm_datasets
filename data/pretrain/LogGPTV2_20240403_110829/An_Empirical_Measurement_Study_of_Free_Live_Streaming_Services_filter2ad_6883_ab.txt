video stalls occurred. We did not observe any quality switches in streaming from
legitimate Web sites.
Stalls. Rebuﬀering is the most noticable streaming artifact for users [9]. If the
player does not ﬁnd suﬃcient new data in the buﬀer, it causes a pause during
the playback that is called a stall. Studies show that the number of stalls has
the highest impact on QoE [9]. From our (fast) campus network, our measure-
ment tool never showed any stalls with legitimate sports streaming Web sites.
Although all NHL FLS providers experienced quality switches, none of them
stalled during video playback. However, the vast majority of the other FLS ser-
vice providers suﬀered from several stalls. Table 3 in the Appendix shows the
number of rebuﬀering events observed for each streaming site studied.

4.3 QUIC
TCP is the prevailing transport-layer protocol used by FLS services. TCP is
amenable to video streaming, and is widely used for Web and mobile applica-
tions. For example, MPEG-DASH is an HTTP-based adaptive bitrate streaming
technique to deliver high-quality streaming of media content over the Internet.
We observed that 18 out of 20 FLS Web sites deliver their services over
TCP. One of the FLS providers used UDP and another one used the Datagram
Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol to deliver video streaming. DTLS is
similar to the TLS protocol that provides security guarantees over UDP. Inter-
estingly, the two legitimate providers both deliver live streaming via UDP-based
solutions. We observed that TSN delivers live video streams using QUIC [19].
Experimental Setup. In this section, we describe our tests to evaluate the
impact of QUIC on the performance of live streaming in diﬀerent network set-
tings. Google by default enables support for the QUIC protocol in the Chrome
browser. To compare QUIC with TCP, we disable this feature in Chrome to
stream live video over TCP. Although TCP Cubic is the default congestion con-
trol algorithm in QUIC [14], the congestion control algorithm used by QUIC
version 50 on the TSN site was unknown to us. To test diﬀerent network set-
tings, we introduce delay, packet loss, and bandwidth limits by using the network
emulation (netem) functionality of the traﬃc control (tc) Linux command. Met-
rics of interest are the startup delay, the average received throughput, and the
number of quality switches.
We conducted all measurements on the described Linux PC with the Google
Chrome browser for live streaming in both Wired and WiFi settings. Figure 4
shows selected results from our experiments, while the full results appear in
Table 4 in the Appendix. The results report the averages from 10 video stream-
ing sessions, from TSN provider, each lasting 100 s, with the browser’s cache
and history cleared before each session. We observed that all video streaming
were streamed from the same IP address. Since recent studies show that QUIC
provides minimal improvements for video streaming in networks with low delay
and loss [2], we set high latency and loss to highlight the impacts of using QUIC.
Network Type. Here we study the behavior of QUIC/TCP live video streaming
in wired and WiFi networks. When the device is connected to a stable wired
connection, enabling QUIC does not have an impact on startup time, but the
average received throughput is slightly better than with TCP. When using the
WiFi network, the QUIC protocol had a lower average startup time than TCP.
However, the received throughput of video sessions using TCP was slightly higher
than with the QUIC protocol.
Delay. We applied 500 ms of delay to both wired and WiFi network connections.
In this scenario, QUIC started playing the video with a lower startup delay than
TCP over both wired and WiFi connections. The behavior of live streaming over
120

TCP in the WiFi network was signiﬁcantly worse than QUIC, with higher startup
time, much lower throughput, and more quality switches. This experiment shows
that QUIC works better than TCP over the WiFi network with high delay.
(a) Startup delay
(b) Throughput

Loss. We added 25% random packet loss to both wired and WiFi connections.
The packet loss drastically reduces the throughput in both QUIC and TCP live
streaming. However, QUIC achieved a higher throughput. That is, QUIC was
able to receive videos with higher resolution while TCP streamed with lower
quality. This could be a key advantage of streaming via QUIC during popular
games that induce network congestion and packet loss.
Bandwidth. We reduced the available network bandwidth to 8 Mbps. In this
condition, the received throughput over TCP connections in both wired and WiFi
networks are higher than the QUIC-based video streaming. The captured traces
show that the server sends the data using three concurrent TCP connections on
diﬀerent ports, with the transferred data almost balanced over each connection.
On the other hand, QUIC experienced worse performance in comparison to TCP.
In the WiFi network with limited bandwidth, QUIC’s startup time is higher, with
lower received throughput, and more quality switches.
4.4 Privacy Analysis
The results from the Privacy View of FLS sports Web sites are summarized in
Fig. 5, as well as Table 5 in the Appendix. We discuss selected results next.
HTTP vs. HTTPS. While the two legitimate sports streaming sites deliver
their services over HTTPS, most of the FLS sites use HTTP rather than HTTPS.
There may be several reasons why FLS providers do not upgrade to HTTPS on
their Web site, such as the costs to purchase and install SSL certiﬁcates on the
server, the extra CPU processing required for encryption, and the fact that some
FLS providers frequently change their Web domains. For these reasons, they may
just simply opt to deliver their services over HTTP.
Ad and Tracking Services. To recognize advertisement and tracking services,
we leveraged the EasyList and EasyPrivacy ﬁlter lists provided by the ad-blocker
An Empirical Measurement Study of Free Live Streaming Services
121
community. We used Privacy Badger5 to distinguish malicious ads from other
ads. By investigating the generated HTTP(S) requests/responses, we observed
that both FLS and legitimate Web sites connect users to advertising and tracking
services (see Fig. 5(a)). However, the legitimate Web sites mostly connect to
known tracking domains, such as Facebook and Google analytics, while the FLS
sites expose users to malicious trackers like onclicksuper.com, which is known to
redirect browsers to many unwanted advertisements. In addition, we observed
that some tracking services like google-analytics.com appear in both FLS and
legitimate sports streaming Web sites.
Overlay Ads and Oﬀered Applications. During the data collection phase, we
observed that FLS Web sites use diﬀerent techniques to show overlay and pop-up
ads. Some of these overlay ads cover part of the video player, and trick users into
pushing a fake close button, which then pops up multiple overlay ads. These ads
violate the online advertising standards [12], degrade the video streaming QoE,
and also lure users to numerous potentially malicious ads. Clicking on misleading
ads can lead to computer viruses such as ransomware, trojans, crypto-mining,
etc. In addition, we observed that some FLS Web sites oﬀer a complimentary
application to watch free live sport streams on the mobile device. Prior work
has shown that these applications contain an advertising package, display ads
without user consent, and trigger potential ad fraud [25].

Fig. 5. Privacy and security measurement results for live sports streaming sites
Browser Security. Sandboxing is often used to run a Web browser in a low-
permission mode that limits malware access to vulnerable aspects of the operat-
ing system. However, some users bypass these security warnings when accessing
FLS sites [1]. Also, tools like ad-blockers can protect the user from deceptive ads
linked to scams and malware [22]. However, some FLS providers use anti-ad-
blocking techniques, or simply refuse to serve users with ad-blockers installed.
Cookies. We observed that both FLS and legitimate Web sites install third-
party advertising and tracking cookies on user systems. Since cookies contain
a history of the user’s actions, they may be exploited or misused to track the
user’s behavior. Figure 5(b) shows the number of third-party cookies observed
for each Web site in our dataset. For instance, we observed that visiting the
5 https://www.privacybadger.org.
122
S. Keshvadi and C. Williamson
TSN site results in 76 cookies from 38 diﬀerent third-party Web sites, 18 of
which are third-party tracking sites. Unlike TSN, DAZN alerts users about the
use of cookies on its Web site, and installs a few cookies on user systems. In
general, FLS Web sites trigger more advertising and tracking on user systems.
In addition, some FLS Web sites set zombie cookies, which can automatically
re-create themselves from stored data even after being deleted.
Data Leaks. By investigating POST requests, we observed that some FLS sites
send user information such as IP address, ISP, city, area, device name, OS,
browser version, and graphic card model to tracking Web sites. In addition,
we discovered TSN uses a new approach, wherein a single POST method was
used to perform multiple GET and POST requests. To do this, it inserts several
GET and POST requests in a JSON-like format, and then sends all of these
using one GET request to its server. One of the POST requests was 16,029
bytes long, and contained 18 GET and 3 POST requests, each addressing a
tracking/advertisement service. This approach can hide requests from browsers,
ad-blockers, and other security tools. An example of these POST requests is
available on our project Web site [17].
5 Related Work
One early work that mentioned free live sports streaming was the epilogue of the
Globalization and Football book [11], in which the authors discussed the impact
of emerging FLS platforms on ‘the global game’. Later, Birmingham et al. [4]
studied FLS for England’s Premier League of soccer, and noted parallels to the
music industry, which faced similar piracy issues in the 1990s.
FLS services have grown tremendously over the past decade. Raﬁque
et al. [25] explored the FLS ecosystem by investigating those infringing upon
sports streaming Web sites. In addition, they analyzed the advertising content
that the FLS Web sites expose during the live broadcasts.
Ayers et al. [1] oﬀered a solution to automatically crawl and discover aggre-
gator Web pages through the Google search engine. Then they studied FLS
services by collecting and investigating 500 illegal live streaming domains. They
observed that despite the improvement in the privacy mechanisms by ad-blockers
and browsers, users are still using illegal streaming and exposing themselves to
scams and deceptive ads. Kariyawasam et al. [16] studied the copyright concerns
in the FLS ecosystem by analyzing the legal landscape for live sports streaming.
Bronzino et al. [5] developed models that derive video quality metrics from
encrypted video streaming services. Biernacki et al. [3] conducted a thorough
video streaming simulation study with diﬀerent network conditions and video
bitrates. Their study showed that QoS metrics signiﬁcantly impact the QoE
metrics for video streaming. In many cases, however, the buﬀering strategies
implemented by a player client are able to mitigate unfavourable network con-
ditions and further improve QoE.
The main novelty of our own work is the focus on performance tradeoﬀs in
live sports streaming (i.e., QoS and QoE), as well as on user privacy and security.

Furthermore, we provide multiple observational viewpoints at diﬀerent layers of
the protocol stack, using a customized version of the MoVIE tool.
6 Conclusion
In this paper, we presented a measurement study of FLS sites to identify tradeoﬀs
in performance (i.e., network QoS and video QoS) as well as privacy and security.
Our measurements were made using an extended version of an open-source video
measurement tool called MoVIE [18]. We also conducted measurements of two
legitimate sports streaming Web sites to provide a basis for comparison.
Our main results can be summarized as follows. We observed a long broad-
casting delay in free live streams. The throughput, streaming quality, and packet
loss rate diﬀer greatly across FLS sites. TSN delivers live video streaming using
QUIC. We observed that QUIC’s beneﬁts are larger in WiFi networks with
higher delay and loss. Similar to previous studies, we also noted that the FLS
ecosystem continues to ﬂourish. Although FLS is free, you always “get what you
pay for”: the user pays the cost of FLS by dealing with the uncertainty of the
streaming services, and the inherent privacy/security risks.
Ethical Considerations
There are several ethical issues associated with studying illegal FLS services.
First, many countries have Fair Dealing exceptions that authorize the use of
copyrighted materials for speciﬁc purposes. In Canada, these purposes include
“research, private study, education, parody, satire, criticism, review, or news
reporting”. Second, we studied Web sites that millions of users visit monthly,
despite the copyright law and potential malicious behaviours. We do not crawl
automatically through the FLS providers, and our study has minimal impact on
visit numbers. In addition, there is a chance that any increased views triggered
by our study will be suitably moderated by the increased awareness of FLS users.
Finally, to study privacy issues, it was necessary to decrypt the device’s network
traﬃc to see the incoming and outgoing ﬂows. However, our measurements and
experiments were conducted on a single device in a controlled lab environment.
We collected neither personal data nor the device traﬃc from other users. All
captured data are publicly available for future studies [17].
