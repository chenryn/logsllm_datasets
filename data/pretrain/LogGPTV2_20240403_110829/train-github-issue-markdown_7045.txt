### Describe the workflow you want to enable
Getting an estimate time for a model to train or an estimated time remaining
before the training is completed.
### Describe your proposed solution
Understand computational resources to get an estimate on time to train. OR  
Use the already elapsed time to computed estimated time remaining. For
example. if 10% training gets completed in 60 sec, ETA for 100% becomes 600
sec or similar.
### Describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant
Tried scitime but thats a very invasive method. Would prefer a method that is
more tightly coupled with sklearn functionality.
