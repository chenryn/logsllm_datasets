To enhance security and limit the creation of tokens, follow these steps:

1. **Restrict Token Creation:**
   - Configure Group Policy to restrict the ability to create token objects. This setting should be applied only to the local system account.
   - **Path in GPO:** `Computer Configuration > [Policies] > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > User Rights Assignment: Create a token object.`
   - Ensure that only the local system account has this permission.

2. **Control Process-Level Token Replacement:**
   - Define who can replace a process-level token. This should be limited to the local and network service accounts.
   - **Path in GPO:** `Computer Configuration > [Policies] > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > User Rights Assignment: Replace a process level token.`
   - Grant this permission only to the local and network service accounts.

3. **Administrator Best Practices:**
   - Administrators should log in as standard users but use the built-in `runas` command to run their tools with administrative privileges. This approach helps in minimizing the risk associated with elevated permissions.
   - **Example Command:** `runas /user:Administrator "tool.exe"`

By implementing these measures, you can effectively manage privileged accounts and reduce the risk of unauthorized token creation and manipulation.
