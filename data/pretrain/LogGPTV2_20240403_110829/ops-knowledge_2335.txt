User: How to build a private Git server? Please list the steps and give specific instructions.
Assistant: Setting up a private Git server requires the following steps: 1. Select the operating system: You can choose Linux, macOS or Windows as the operating system. 2. Install Git software: Install Git software in the selected operating system. 3. Create an SSH key: Create an SSH key to access the Git service, and you can use the ssh-keygen command to generate the key. 4. Install and configure the SSH service: If the SSH service is not installed, you need to install and configure the SSH service. 5. Create a Git user: Create a Git user to manage the Git repository. 6. Create a Git warehouse: use the Git user to create a Git warehouse on the server. 7. Add developer: Add the developer's public key to the Git server. 8. Authorized users: Configure the access rights of the Git server. 9. Connection test: Use the developer's private key to test whether the connection to the Git repository is normal. 10. Configure Webhooks: You can use webhooks to integrate the Git server with third-party continuous integration/continuous deployment services. Specific instructions: 1. Select the operating system: You can choose Windows, macOS or Linux as the operating system. Linux is a good choice because it has many free Git server software, such as GitLab, Gitea, etc., which can be easily installed and managed. 2. Install Git software: It is very easy to install Git software, just download the Git installation program suitable for your operating system from the official website and install it. 3. Create an SSH key: You can use the ssh-keygen command to generate a key. On the Git server the user's keys are stored in the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file. Add the generated public key to this file for later access to the server. 4. Install and configure the SSH service: If the SSH service is not installed, you need to install and configure the SSH service. On Linux systems, you can install SSH with the following command: ``` sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install ssh ``` After the installation is complete, you need to do some configuration: ``` sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config ``` Find the following lines in this file: ``` #Port 22 #Protocol 2,1 #PermitRootLogin yes #PasswordAuthentication yes ``` and replace these lines with the following: ``` Port 22 Protocol 2 PermitRootLogin no PasswordAuthentication no ``` Save the file and restart the SSH service: ``` sudo service ssh restart ``` 5. Create a Git user: You can use the following command to create a Git user: ``` sudo adduser git ``` 6. Create Git Repository: Use the Git user to create a Git repository on the server. It can be implemented using open source server software such as GitLab or Gitea, which have a graphical interface and detailed documentation. 7. Add developer: Add the developer's public key to the Git server. If you use GitLab, you can manage them on the "Settings -> SSH Keys" page. Developers need to provide their public key to access Git repositories. 8. Authorized users: Configure the access rights of the Git server. Developers need to obtain permission to access the Git repository, and can use software such as GitLab and Gitea to complete this step. 9. Connection test: Use the developer's private key to test whether the connection to the Git repository is normal. We can use the following command to test the connection: ``` ssh git@[GIT_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS] 'echo "Git server is working"' ``` 10. Configure Webhooks: Git server can be integrated with Ci/CD service when code repository When a change occurs, the Git server can notify the Ci/CD service so that an automatic deployment process can be started. Doing so simplifies and speeds up the deployment process. If using GitLab, it can be managed on the "Project -> Settings -> Integrations" page. The above are the steps and specific instructions for building a Git server.
