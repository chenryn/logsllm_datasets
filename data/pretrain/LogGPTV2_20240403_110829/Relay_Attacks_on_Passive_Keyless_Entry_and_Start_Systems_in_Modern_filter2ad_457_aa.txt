Abstract
We demonstrate relay attacks on Passive Keyless Entry
and Start (PKES) systems used in modern cars. We build
two efﬁcient and inexpensive attack realizations, wired and
wireless physical-layer relays, that allow the attacker to en-
ter and start a car by relaying messages between the car
and the smart key. Our relays are completely independent
of the modulation, protocol, or presence of strong authenti-
cation and encryption. We perform an extensive evaluation
on 10 car models from 8 manufacturers. Our results show
that relaying the signal in one direction only (from the car
to the key) is sufﬁcient to perform the attack while the true
distance between the key and car remains large (tested up
to 50 meters, non line-of-sight). We also show that, with
our setup, the smart key can be excited from up to 8 meters.
This removes the need for the attacker to get close to the
key in order to establish the relay. We further analyze and
discuss critical system characteristics. Given the generality
of the relay attack and the number of evaluated systems, it
is likely that all PKES systems based on similar designs are
also vulnerable to the same attack. Finally, we propose im-
mediate mitigation measures that minimize the risk of relay
attacks as well as recent solutions that may prevent relay
attacks while preserving the convenience of use, for which
PKES systems were initially introduced.

Introduction
Modern cars embed complex electronic systems in order
to improve driver safety and convenience. Areas of signiﬁ-
cant public and manufacturer interest include access to the
car (i.e., entry in the car) and authorization to drive (i.e.,
start the car). Traditionally, access and authorization have
been achieved using physical key and lock systems, where
by inserting a correct key into the door and ignition locks,
the user was able to enter and drive the car.
In the last
decade, this system has been augmented with remote ac-
cess in which users are able to open their car remotely by
pressing a button on their key fobs. In these systems, the
authorization to drive was still mainly enforced by a physi-
cal key and lock system. Physical keys also often embedded
immobilizer chips to prevent key copying.
Recently, car manufacturers have introduced Passive
Keyless Entry and Start (PKES) systems that allow users to
open and start their cars while having their car keys ’in their
pockets’. This feature is very convenient for the users since
they don’t have to search for their keys when approaching
or preparing to start the car. The Smart Key system was
introduced in 1999 [1]. Since then, similar systems have
been developed by a number of manufacturers under differ-
ent names; a full list of systems can be found in [2].
In this work, we analyze the security of PKES systems
and show that they are vulnerable to relay attacks. In a relay
attack, the attacker places one of her devices in the proxim-
ity of the key, and the other device in the proximity of the
car. The attacker then relays messages between the key and
the car, enabling the car to be opened and started even if
the key is physically far from the car. This corresponds to
the scenario where the key is e.g., in the owner’s pocket in
the supermarket, and the car is at the supermarket parking
lot. We tested 10 recent car models 1 from 8 manufacturers
and show that their PKES systems are vulnerable to certain
types of relay attacks 2. Our attack allowed to open and start
the car while the true distance between the key and car re-
mained large (tested up to 50 meters, non line-of-sight). It
worked without physically compromising the key or raising
any suspicion of the owner. We also show that, with our

tested in laboratory only.
2Instead of providing names of car models and manufacturers that we
tested, we describe the operation of the PKES system that the tested models
use. We leave it to the readers to verify with the manufacturers if the
described or similar PKES system is used in speciﬁc car models.

setup, the smart key can be excited from a distance of a few
meters (up to 8 meters on certain systems). This removes
the need for the attacker to get close to the key in order to
establish a relay. Still, the relay device at the car side in
our setup should be close to the car (≤ 30 cm). We realized
both wired and wireless physical-layer relay setups with dif-
ferent antennas and ampliﬁers. The cost of our relay setups
is between 100 and 1000 USD, depending on the choice of
components. This shows that relay attacks on PKES sys-
tems are both inexpensive and practical. Although the pos-
sibility of such attacks on PKES systems has been discussed
in the open literature [3], it was not clear if these attacks are
feasible on modern cars; in this paper, we demonstrate that
these attacks are both feasible and practical.
Besides demonstrating relay attacks on PKES systems,
we further analyze critical time characteristics of these sys-
tems and discuss the results. We also propose simple coun-
termeasures that can be immediately deployed by the car
owners in order to minimize the risk of relay attacks; how-
ever, these countermeasures also disable the operation of the
PKES systems. Finally, we review recent solutions against
relay attacks and discuss their effectiveness and appropri-
ateness for car PKES systems.
We note that the main reason why relay attacks are pos-
sible on PKES systems is that, to open and start the car, in-
stead of verifying that the correct key is in its physical prox-
imity, the car veriﬁes if it can communicate with the correct
key, assuming that the ability to communicate (i.e., com-
munication neighborhood) implies proximity (i.e., physical
neighborhood). This is only true for non-adversarial set-
tings. In adversarial settings communication neighborhood
cannot be taken as a proof of physical proximity. Given
this, any secure PKES system needs to enable the car and
the key to securely verify their physical proximity. This is
only natural since the car should open only when the legit-
imate user (holding the key) is physically close to the car.
We outline a new PKES system, based on distance bound-
ing, that achieves this goal, and preserves user convenience
for which PKES systems were initially introduced. We note
that relay attacks have been similarly used in other scenar-
ios, e.g., in [16] as maﬁa-fraud attacks, in [25] as wormhole
attacks. Similarly, the relationship between secure commu-
nication and physical neighborhood notions has been previ-
ously studied in [35, 37, 41].
The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
In Sec-
tion 2 we ﬁrst describe the evolution of car key systems
from physical keys to Passive Keyless Entry and Start sys-
tems. In Section 3 we describe the design and implementa-
tion of our wired and wireless physical-layer relay attacks.
Section 4 presents the results of the experiments we con-
ducted on 10 different PKES models. Section 5 describes
the consequences and implications of these attacks, coun-
termeasures are presented in Section 6 and related work is
discussed in Section 7.
2 Car Entry Systems
Car key systems have passed through several genera-
tions, evolving from the simple physical keys to more so-
phisticated keyless entry systems. Table 1 presents the ex-
isting key systems in cars.
2.1 Remote Open and Close
Physical keys were enhanced with capabilities for re-
mote opening and closing the car for convenience. Such
keys have a button on the key fob to open or close the car
remotely. This functionality usually requires the presence
of a battery and relies on UHF (315 or 433 MHz) commu-
nication. The communication is energy efﬁcient in order to
save key battery life with typical transmission range from
10 to 100 meters.
2.2 Keys with Immobilizers
In a key with an immobilizer (also known as transpon-
der key), RFID chips are embedded in the key bow. When
the key blade is inserted in the ignition lock, the RFID tag
will be queried by the car to verify if the key is authorized.
These immobilizer systems are designed to prevent physi-
cally coping the key as well as stealing the car by bypassing
the lock. Only a key with a previously paired RFID tag
would be authorized to start the engine. The RFID technol-
ogy involved typically relies on LF technology (from 120 to
135 KHz). It can operate in both passive and active modes
depending on the scenario. The active mode of operation is
commonly used with PKES (see Section 2.3).

Figure 1. Examples of Passive Keyless Entry and Start system protocol realizations. a) In a typical
realization, the car periodically probes the channel for the presence of the key with short beacons.
If the key is in range, a challenge-response protocol between the car and key follows to grant or
deny access. This is energy efﬁcient given that key detection relies on very short beacons. b) In
a second realization, the car periodically probes the channel directly with larger challenge beacons
that contain the car identiﬁer. If the key is in range, it directly responds to the challenge.
In the passive mode of operation, the RFID tag in the key
is powered by the car via inductive coupling before sending
a challenge to the key. With the power transferred from the
car, the key wakes up the microcontroller, demodulates the
challenge, computes a response message and replies back
on the LF channel. This mode of operation requires close
proximity between key and car because the key has to har-
vest energy from the car to function and the decrease of
intensity of the magnetic ﬁeld is inversely proportional to
the cube of the distance.
2.3 Passive Keyless Entry and Start Systems
The ﬁrst proposal that describes Passive Keyless Entry
systems appeared in [47].
In that work, the authors pro-
posed a system that automatically unlocks the vehicle when
the user carrying the key approaches the vehicle and locks
the vehicle when the user moves away from the vehicle. The
system is referred to as ’Passive’ as it does not require any
action from the user. The communication between the key
and car is characterized by a magnetically coupled radio fre-
quency signal. In this system, the car concludes that the key
is in the close proximity when it is ’in the car’s communi-
cation range’.
A PKES car key uses an LF RFID tag that provides
short range communication (within 1-2 m in active and a
few centimeters in passive mode) and a fully-ﬂedged UHF
transceiver for longer range communication (within 10 to
100 m). The LF channel is used to detect if the key fob
is within regions Inside and Outside of the car. Figure 2(b)
shows the areas in proximity of the car that must be detected
in order to allow a safe and convenient use of the PKES sys-
tem. The regions are as follows.
• Remote distance to the car (typically up to 100 m).
Only open/close the car by pushing a button on the key
fob is allowed.
• Outside the car, but at a distance of approximately 1 -
2 m from the door handle. Open/close the car by using
the door handle is allowed.
• Inside the car. Starting the engine is allowed.
The PKES protocols vary depending on the manufac-
turer. Typically two modes of operation are supported,
namely normal and backup mode. The normal mode re-
lies on a charged and working battery, while the backup
mode operates without a battery (e.g., when the battery is
exhausted). The locations and authorizations of the two
modes are summarized in Table 2.
Figure 1 shows two example realizations of car open-
ing in a normal mode. The car sends beacons on the LF
channel either periodically or when the door handle is op-
erated. These beacons could be either short wake-up mes-
sages or larger challenge messages that contain the car iden-
tiﬁer. When the key detects the signal on the LF channel, it
wakes up the microcontroller, demodulates the signal and
interprets it. After computing a response to the challenge,
the key replies on the UHF channel. This response is re-
ceived and veriﬁed by the car. In the case of a valid response
the car unlocks the doors. Subsequently, in order to start the
car engine, the key must be present within the car (region
Inside in Figure 2(b)). In this region, the key receives dif-
ferent types of messages that when replied will inform the
car that the correct key is within the car itself. The car will
then allow starting the engine. It should be noted that in
normal mode the LF channel is only used to communicate
