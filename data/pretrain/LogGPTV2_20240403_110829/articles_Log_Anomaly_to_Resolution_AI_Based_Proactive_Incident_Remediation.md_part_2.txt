### Anomaly Detection in Log Data Using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Models

#### Model Training and Classification
In the context of Erroneous Log Template Clusters (ELTC) and Non-Erroneous Log Template Clusters (NELTC), log templates with sizes below the 3rd quartile and 1st quartile, respectively, are labeled as Anomalous Erroneous Log Template Clusters (AELTC) and Anomalous Non-Erroneous Log Template Clusters (ANELTC).

1. **Independent Model:**
   - Two Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) models are trained independently.
   - The first model predicts the Category.
   - The second model predicts the Sub-Category.

2. **Conditional Model:**
   - Two SGD models are trained, where the second model is conditioned on the predictions of the first.
   - The first model predicts the Category label using the log line as input.
   - The second model predicts the Sub-Category label using both the log line and the predicted Category as input.

#### Test-Time Classification
At test time, each incoming log line is classified into one of two classes: erroneous or non-erroneous, and then converted into a log template. The classification process involves two pathways:

- **Erroneous Pathway:**
  - The log template is checked for membership in the AELTC.
  - If it belongs to AELTC, it is labeled as anomalous.
  - Otherwise, it is checked for membership in the ELTC.
  - If it belongs to ELTC, it is labeled as non-anomalous.
  - If it does not belong to either, it is labeled as anomalous.

- **Non-Erroneous Pathway:**
  - The log template is checked for membership in the ANELTC.
  - If it belongs to ANELTC, it is labeled as anomalous.
  - Otherwise, it is checked for membership in the NELTC.
  - If it does not belong to NELTC, it is labeled as a possible anomalous candidate.

#### Data Split and Parameter Tuning
The log data is split into training and validation sets in an 80:20 ratio, resulting in 7416 log lines for training and 1671 erroneous log lines for validation. The most common set of parameters was experimented with, as listed in Table I. Parameters were fine-tuned during the building of the Category prediction model, and the learned parameter values were transferred to the Sub-Category prediction model under both Independent and Conditional settings.

- **Category Prediction Model:**
  - Achieved an accuracy of 74.85% over the validation set.
  
- **Sub-Category Prediction Model:**
  - Independent model achieved an accuracy of 52.1%.
  - Conditional model achieved an accuracy of 55.68%.

- **Joint Accuracy:**
  - Independent model: 50.9%
  - Conditional model: 54.49%

For LA2R, 1167 erroneous log lines are a subset of 1852 log lines. Figure 4 illustrates the Log Anomaly Training and Testing Pipeline.

#### Evaluation
**Dataset and Baseline:**
- For evaluation, 186K log lines from a production application server spanning 45 days were used.
- LAD identified 15 unique anomalous log windows and 16 unique log anomalies, with each log window defined by start-time.
- LA2R was compared against a baseline method that uses MessageCode to retrieve ResolutionUrls, equivalent to what an SRE would use to find resolutions in Product Documentation.
- Five SREs who manage the Application Server product were consulted, and majority voting was used to arrive at the final result.

**Accuracy Metrics:**
- Predicted Category accuracy: 78.57% (11/14)
- Joint accuracy of Category and Sub-Category prediction: 62%

**Resolution Retrieval:**
- Across 16 unique log lines, LA2R returned 28 results, reducing the result set by 31% compared to the baseline.
- 60% (17/28) of the resolutions are actionable.
- 64.7% (11/17) of the results were found relevant by SREs.

**Predictive Log Anomalies:**
- 62% of the MessageCodes are informational and warning, indicating potential future incidents.

#### Conclusion and Future Work
We have presented an end-to-end LA2R system for proactive incident triaging using heterogeneous data in an AIOps environment. The system uses predictive models for incident remediation and has been evaluated on a production Application Server dataset. Based on SRE feedback, the prediction accuracy is 78%, and 64% of resolutions are actionable and relevant. Additionally, 62% of predictive log anomalies contain informational and warning MessageCodes, aiding in proactive incident remediation.

Future work envisions a closed-loop system that can learn from LA2R usage in the AIOps pipeline to further fine-tune the models, improving the quality of detected anomalies and retrieved results.
