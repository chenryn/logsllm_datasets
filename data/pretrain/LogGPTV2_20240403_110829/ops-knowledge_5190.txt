**User:**
I am using OpenERP 7 on Ubuntu 12.04 and have been attempting to install the Aeroo Reports module for creating OpenERP reports. During the installation, I encountered some "XML issues." Now, when I try to remove the module, I receive the following error message: 
```
Integrity Error
The operation cannot be completed, probably due to the following:
- deletion: you may be trying to delete a record while other records still reference it.
```
Could you please help me resolve this issue?

**Assistant:**
Uninstalling a module in OpenERP can sometimes lead to unexpected issues. It is generally advisable to test the module's functionality and features in a test environment before deploying it in a live system.

To address your current problem, follow these steps:

1. **Check for Existing Aeroo Reports:**
   - Verify if there are any Aeroo reports already present in your system.
   
2. **Delete the Reports Manually:**
   - If you find any Aeroo reports, delete them manually from the system.
   - Also, ensure that any related actions or references to these reports are removed.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the integrity error and successfully remove the module.
