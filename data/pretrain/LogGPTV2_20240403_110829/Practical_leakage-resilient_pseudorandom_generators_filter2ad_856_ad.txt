weakened complexity 2· s− (cid:96)·sf,F , which is due to the heav-
ily involved computational reductions. We will discuss in
Section 4.3 possible ways to obtain tighter results.
Proof outline.
Our proof essentially exploit tools that have been intro-
duced in the previous works [9] and [29].
We ﬁrst note in Lemma 1 (given in [29]) that a wPRF
can be seen as a combination of a strong 2-source pseudo-
randomness extractor and a PRG, where a two-source pseu-
dorandomness extractor is a function whose output is pseu-
dorandom, even if the two inputs are only weakly random,
as long as they are independent and have high min-entropy,
and “strong” refers to the additional property that one of its
inputs can be public (i.e., p0 or p1 in our case).
Besides, even though an arbitrary leakage, say Li(ki−1, p0),
will certainly destroy the pseudo-randomness of the wPRF
output (ki, xi) := F(ki−1, p0), it can be shown that, given a
bounded leakage, ki can still keep a high amount of HILL
pseudoentropy (see Lemma 2 from [9] for the details).
Therefore, as we use independent randomness p0 and p1
in an alternating manner, we can output a pseudorandom
ki+1 by performing two-source extraction between ki and
p1, provided that they are independent given the leakages,
which is fulﬁlled by enforcing non-adaptive leakages. That
is, Li takes only (ki−1, p0) as input and thus, conditioned on
it, ki and p1 are independent. Note that ki+1 will again lose
its pseudorandomness when taking into account the next
round leakage, but we can then repeat the proof as above.
Finally, it is important that the security only degrades
linearly with the number of rounds, which is conﬁrmed by
Lemma 3. It shows that, for every (cid:96), the output K(cid:96) of the
(cid:96)-th round has high HILL pseudo-entropy given the outputs
and leakages up to that round, and that the computating
F(K(cid:96), Pρ((cid:96))) can be seen as a 2-source pseudo-randomness
extraction, which completes the proof of Theorem 2.
Lemma 1
(2-source Extraction [29]). Let F : {0, 1}κ
×{0, 1}n → {0, 1}m be an (, s, n/) secure wPRF for uni-
form K and X, then for independent random variables K(cid:48)
and X(cid:48) with H∞(K(cid:48)) ≥ κ − ∆ and H∞(X(cid:48)) ≥ n − ∆, it
holds that dsa (F(K(cid:48), X(cid:48))|X(cid:48)) ≤ a, where a = ·22∆+4 and
sa = s·2/2n2.

(Pseudo-entropy of PRG outputs [9]).
For joint random variable (X,L) with dsa (X) ≤ a and L
in the range of {0, 1}λ, for any b and ∆ > 0 satisfying
a + 2−∆ ≤ 2
b · 2−λ, there exists a joint random variable
(X(cid:48), L) such that:
b·sa/8κ((X, L); (X(cid:48), L)) ≤ b.
[H∞(X(cid:48)|L) ≥ |X| − ∆] ≥ 1 − b.

Note that we use Lemma 1 in an extended scenario since
˜K(cid:96) and Pρ((cid:96)) may not be completely independent. But it al-
ready suﬃces to have that (i) ( ˜K(cid:96), ˜X(cid:96)) and (cid:103)view(cid:96)\ ˜X(cid:96) (which
contains Pρ((cid:96))) are independent conditioned on some ˜T(cid:96); (ii)
the secret input ˜K(cid:96) has high min-entropy conditioned on the
whole view (Equation (1)); and (iii) the public input Pρ((cid:96))
has high min-entropy conditioned on ˜T(cid:96) (Equation (2)).
4.3 Alternative construction with extractors
One limitation of the analysis in the previous section is
the loose security bound. A simple way to improve this
limitation is to replace the wPRF in Figure 3 by a com-
bination of PRG and a strong 2-source extractor, i.e.
to
use the function: F(cid:48)(K, P )
def
= prg(ext(K, P )). As ﬁrst de-
tailed in [9], F(cid:48) is not a wPRF, but is actually suﬃcient for
the stream cipher in Figure 3 to be proven leakage-resilient.
This extractor-based construction has tighter (but still not
tight) bounds than the O(
1
12 ) obtained in Theorem 2, since
it involves less computational reductions. Namely, by using
a 2-source extractor, we avoid using Lemma 1 at the cost
of introducing a gap term ext in an additive manner, which
can be made exponentially small. As discussed in [37], it is
additionally possible to improve the tightness of the security
bounds further, in particular when using parameters of prac-
tical size (e.g., a 128-bit key), by relying on an assumption
of seed-incompressible PRG, originally introduced in [15].
Note that relying on seed incompressibility and/or bounded
leakages also raises practical issues, since these assumptions
appear to be diﬃcult to fulﬁll by hardware designers.
In
order to get rid of this other type of limitation, [37] intro-
duces empirically veriﬁable assumptions (namely, the next-
block-unpredictability of the 2PRG with simulatable leak-
ages), under which security proofs can be obtained in the
standard model. But this again comes at the price of worse
security bounds. Determining whether it is possible to ob-
tain tight bounds, under assumptions that can be quantiﬁed
in practice, is an interesting scope for further research.
We ﬁnally mention that these improvements come at the
price of implementing an extractor on a leaking device. As
pointed out in [34], the use of extractors in physically ob-
servable cryptography can be paradoxical. On the one hand,
they allow recovering (pseudo) entropy losses if their im-
plementation does not leak too much. On the other hand,
the implementation of the extractor can become a good tar-
get for standard DPA attacks, because it involves repeated
arithmetic operations between its public and private inputs.
This illustrates the interesting tradeoﬀ between practical se-
curity and tight bounds in the proofs. Finding the best
compromise will require better knowledge on the implemen-
tation of extractors with low abstraction level countermea-
sures, which is another scope for further investigations.
5. CONCLUSION
Designing leakage-resilient cryptographic primitives im-
plies intricate tradeoﬀs between meaningful physical assump-
tions and sound mathematical proofs. It results in an ongo-
ing discussion about how to best combine these two goals, in
order to obtain general proofs under minimum assumptions.
Taking the example of pseudorandom generators, this paper
ﬁrst analyzes the security of a simple stateful construction,
with minimum physical requirements. We show that this
construction can be proven secure under a random oracle
based assumption. Then, we show that the price to pay for
relaxing the random oracle assumption, and have a proof
in the standard model, is actually small. That is, one just
needs to assume a small public memory and non adaptive
leakage functions. More precisely, we reﬂect the adaptivity
of the measurement conditions in the leakage bounds pro-
vided by cryptographic engineers, rather than in the adver-
sarial experiment in our proofs, which is conform to the prac-
tice of side-channel attacks. Previous discussions in leakage-
resilient cryptography also apply to our new constructions.
For example, replacing a wPRF by a combination of PRG
and extractor allows obtaining better security bounds, at
the cost of implementing a (potentially leaky) extractor.
Avenues for further research could be in two main direc-
tions. On the one hand, the design of dedicated solutions
that eﬃciently withstand side-channel attacks could be ex-
tended towards other cryptographic primitives. Such ad-
vances are necessary for the application of leakage-resilient
constructions in real-world applications, where good imple-
mentation performances are required. On the other hand,
and more generally, the introduction of alternative restric-
tions of the leakage function would also be useful, e.g.
in
order to rule out unrealistic “future computation attacks”
from the model rather than by design tweaks. Such improve-
ments could open the way towards a more generic treatment
of physically observable cryptographic implementations.
