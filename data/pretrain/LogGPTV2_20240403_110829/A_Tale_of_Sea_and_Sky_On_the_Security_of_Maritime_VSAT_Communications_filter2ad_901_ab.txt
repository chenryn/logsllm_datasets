In our speciﬁc experimental setup, our equipment was
capable of receiving DVB-S2 signals in the Ku-band frequency
range (10.7-12.75GHz). While maritime VSAT services are
offered in many different spectrum ranges (particularly C-band
due to rain-fade concerns at sea), we expect any ﬁndings in
the Ku-band should hold across other frequencies. It is worth
noting that our research is restricted to DVB-S2 signals. While
DVB-S2 is a dominant standard used by hundreds of satellite
broadband operators, some proprietary alternatives exist. An
entirely different technical approach (and possibly different
hardware) would be required to analyze such products.
While the location of satellites which offer VSAT services
are widely available public knowledge, the speciﬁc frequencies
used are not. In order to identify frequencies, the attacker must
scan the RF-spectrum of radio emissions from the satellite for
channels and then ascertain which are used for VSAT services
(see Figure 4). For this experiment, we identiﬁed a total of 15
VSAT streams on two geostationary platforms, mostly on the
basis of signal modulation settings (e.g. 32-APSK) and strings
detected in raw signal recordings.

B. Data Extraction and Signal Interpretation
Both of the targeted maritime VSAT operators in our study
employed a modern protocol stack which combined the newer
DVB-S2 standard (formalized in 2005 to replace the original
1995 DVB-S standard) with adaptive coding and modulation
(ACM). Data was further encapsulated into generic continuous
streams using the generic stream encapsulation (GSE) protocol
ﬁrst proposed by the European Telecommunications Standards
Institute in 2007 [15], [16], [17]. An overview of this encap-
sulation method can be found in Figure 5.
Unlike older multi-protocol encapsulation (MPE) streams,
to our knowledge no publicly available software for receiving
and interpreting satellite data feeds in this format exists. As a
result, we developed GSExtract, a set of python utilities that
permit the extraction of arbitrary IP data from raw recordings
of GSE continuous streams. For those feeds most commonly
used in maritime VSAT service, GSExtract allows an attacker
to reliably interpret a signiﬁcant portion of broadcast data with
comparatively low quality satellite television equipment.
It bears mentioning that GSExtract is not merely a naive
implementation of the DVB-S2 and GSE standards. Rather
the utility leverages several assumptions about maritime VSAT
implementations to enable the recovery of arbitrary IP packets
in the presence of frequent signal processing failures. A
detailed description of these assumptions and the technical
implementation of GSExtract can be found in Appendix A.
GSExtract would be ill-suited as a utility for operating a
maritime VSAT internet service due to these assumptions, but
it performs well as a forensic tool. Two of the core strategies
employed are the use of a known valid MATYPE header as a
“crib” for re-synchronization within corrupted streams and the
intelligent padding of internal payload data to construct valid
packets when data fragments are missed by the radio receiver.
C. Collection and Forensic Performance
For an initial assessment of GSExtract’s performance, we
elected to record 24 hours of data from the two transponders on
each of the two targeted satellites which offered the strongest
and most reliable signal (as indicated by signal-to-noise ratio)
at our research site in Europe. In total,
this amounted to

put than the others and was included to assess GSExtract’s
performance in lower bandwidth contexts.

IP payload bytes using GSExtract. These metrics were only
calculable for successfully identiﬁed IP packet headers and do
not apply to “unrecoverable” GSE packets lost in the signal
processing stage (see Figure 6).
96 hours of maritime trafﬁc recordings and approximately
300GB of reconstructed packet captures. As anticipated in
section IV-A, recordings made with consumer-grade hardware
were imperfect, with signiﬁcant data loss. GSExtract interfaced
with raw DVB-S Baseband Frame recordings made by the
TBS-6903 card as no software was found capable of processing
higher layers from the corrupted recordings. Nevertheless,
GSExtract was able to extract between 40-60% of the GSE
PDUs contained within the targeted streams and partially
recover a further 10-25% of corrupted PDUs (Figure 6).
We lacked ground-truth regarding the quantity of internet
trafﬁc transmitted which makes it difﬁcult to determine what
proportion of a VSAT feed was successfully picked up by the
employed hardware. However, a proxy metric can be derived
based on the number of padding bytes injected by GSExtract
into a recovered capture. In the case where a large number
of IP packets were corrupted, it is expected that GSExtract
will inject a correspondingly large number of bytes into the
resultant .pcap ﬁle when reconstructing partial IP payloads.
In the case where most IP packets are recovered successfully,
GSExtract will not add many additional bytes. This metric
the IP packet
suggests that, at
level, GSExtract recovered
on average, approximately 92% of any given IP payload.
However, in terms of overall data volume we estimate that
GSExtract was able to reconstruct between 60% to 85% of
bytes transmitted on a given frequency (Figure 7). Performance
was roughly correlated with signal quality, with the lowest-
quality data signal also showing signiﬁcantly higher rates
of data corruption using GSExtract. Additional variance in
performance measurements may result from speciﬁc network
properties and behaviors (e.g. use for video streaming vs. web
browsing) across each signal.
This discrepancy between the average recovery rate in
terms of packets compared to in terms of bytes results from
the use of fragmentation in GSE. Speciﬁcally, the IP pack-
ets most likely to be recovered by GSExtract were smaller
packets which could be transmitted entirely within in a single
BBFrame. This size varies, often minute-to-minute, depending
on network trafﬁc conditions. Generally, however, as an IP
packet gets larger, the probability of fragmentation increases.
The more fragmented an IP packet is, the more likely that one

of those fragments is not picked up by the signal hardware.
The strength of this relationship can be observed in Figure 8.
Even in the case of fragmented packets, however, GSEx-
tract is often able to identify and recover signiﬁcant portions of
the lost payloads. While there is no state of the art for compar-
ison, one would expect a naive decoder to have higher errors
at higher degrees of fragmentation. In contrast, GSExtract
breaks this positive correlation and allows for reliable rates of
partial recovery regardless of fragmentation rates (Figure 9).
Even in highly fragmented and unreliable streams, GSExtract
successfully identiﬁes and partially reconstructs between 84%
and 92% of received GSE PDUs. In essence, GSExtract
“makes use” of the vast majority of trafﬁc which is successfully
demodulated by the satellite hardware. It is only in cases when
the IP header itself is not received by the satellite hardware
that a payload is fully “unrecoverable” (see Figure 6).
D. Additional Experimental Collection
In addition to the four initial experimental feeds, we
recorded a continuous week of trafﬁc from each service
provider. This was devised to support deeper measurements
into trafﬁc patterns and behaviors over time. In total, this
provided approximately 1.3 TB of data and more than half
a billion DVBS-2 messages for analysis.
Beyond storage costs, there is no practical limitation on
an attacker’s ability to record data using this method. Even
in the case of complete signal interruption or loss (such as
in the event of adverse weather), GSExtract is capable of
automatically reconstructing and resuming analysis of broken
GSE data streams. While beyond the scope of this security

analysis, GSExtact may thus be well suited to multi-month
longitudinal measurement studies of trafﬁc trends within the
maritime ecosystem. Additionally, while a single satellite dish
can only tune to one channel at a time (acting as a practical
constraint on the amount of data which can be collected),
signiﬁcantly more data might be captured through the use
of multiple dishes simultaneously. VSAT-speciﬁc signals in-
telligence (SIGINT) collection platforms sold to nation-state
security services likely also have this capability, albeit at costs
far beyond the reach of our proposed threat model [34].
E. Ethical and Legal Concerns
On account of the real-world networks in which we con-
ducted our experiment, all relevant legal regulations surround-
ing trafﬁc collection and analysis in the jurisdiction of our
research were strictly adhered to. Given that we had no prior
indication of the sensitivity of information in maritime VSAT
feeds, we treated all collected data as if it contained sensitive
information. No information was stored longer than necessary
and we made no attempt to decrypt data even in cases where
encryption appeared weak or improperly implemented.
To the best of our ability, we have attempted to responsibly
disclose these ﬁndings to service providers and individual
maritime customers impacted by our research. At the time
of submission,
these conversations are ongoing but many
contacted organizations have expressed surprise at the ﬁndings
and an interest in taking steps to mitigate them. In some cases,
this research has led to conversations with C-Suite executives
at some of the world’s largest businesses, suggesting that this
attack vector on ship-to-shore communications is novel and of
particular concern to maritime industry participants. Given that
disclosure is an ongoing process, we have elected to withhold
the speciﬁc names and transmission frequencies of the affected
service providers to give them time to address identiﬁed issues.
protected. Given that the underlying routing equipment used
in these networks accounts for more than 60% of the global
maritime VSAT market, and is used by eight of the ten largest
VSAT providers, we expect that ﬁndings on these networks
have wide-ranging applicability to the industry [46]. Moreover,
one of the satellites included in our study was launched within
the past 3 years, suggesting that these ﬁndings are not merely
representative of security issues in legacy systems.
A. Applications and Protocols
The principal protocols identiﬁed in our recordings are
outlined in Figure 10. To some extent, trafﬁc transmitted over
maritime VSAT network is similar to that which would be
observed by any other ISP. For example, maritime VSAT
terminals are used by crew and passengers for the purposes
of general web browsing, media streaming, and personal
communications. Of course, it is unusual for an attacker to
have the vantage-point of an ISP-level eavesdropper, especially
over a coverage area of millions of square kilometers.
However, there are some important differences in the use
and operation of maritime networks. Maritime VSAT services
are sold as a component of internal business technical infras-
tructure as well as external connections to the wider internet.
As a result, maritime VSAT trafﬁc includes not only general
access to internet services but also internal business commu-
nications. A traditional approach to designing and securing
business networks by, for example, defending the perimeter
between the business LAN and the internet, may not easily
translate to VSAT architectures.
The effect of this difference is demonstrated by contrasting
the protocols used to access IP addresses within the satellite
network with those located outside it (Figure 11). We observe
a much higher usage of unencrypted protocols, such as HTTP
and clear-text POP3 (as opposed to HTTPS or POP with TLS)
when both participants are “local” to the VSAT network than
when one of the participants sits external to the satellite en-
vironment. This may suggest that maritime operators consider
VSAT networks to operate in a manner akin to a corporate
LAN environment and are unaware that these networks are
subject to over-the-air eavesdropping.
Less broadly, maritime networks differ from terrestrial net-
works in that communications serve several unique functional
purposes in maritime environments. Thousands of specialized
applications designed to enable the remote monitoring and
operation of various ship components rely on maritime VSAT
networks to communicate with terrestrial ofﬁces or other ships
in a ﬂeet. Given this technical diversity,
to
exactly characterize which captured trafﬁc belongs to which
applications. However, an overview of some common maritime
and terrestrial application functions observed in GSExtract’s
captures appears in Table II. More detailed case studies of
speciﬁc services can be found in Sections VII and VIII.

B. Hosts and Vessels
Despite prior research suggesting that larger maritime or-
ganizations are more conﬁdent in their cyber-security controls
than smaller ones, we observed sensitive data originating not
only from small ﬂeets, but also from some of the world’s
most signiﬁcant maritime operators [29]. These included three

V. THREAT MODEL
This experiment focused on a threat actor with a rela-
tively low degree of sophistication. Beyond the aforemen-
tioned assumption that the attacker was resource-constrained to
consumer-grade equipment, we also assumed that the attacker
was not capable of directly interfering with the operation of the
satellite network itself. That is to say, the attacker is passive
with regards to satellite signals and cannot directly inject,
spoof, or interrupt radio emissions. Future experimentation
considering the possibility of an active attacker may prove
valuable but would be difﬁcult to conduct safely and legally
in real-world maritime VSAT networks.
While our threat model assumes a passive attacker in the
satellite context, we grant the attacker the ability to engage in
active attacks against internet-connected systems. For example,
if the attacker observes conﬁdential information in a satellite
feed, we consider how that information might be abused to
impact publicly routable maritime platforms.
Our threat model did not focus on any speciﬁc operational
motive for the attacker beyond that of an honest but curious
observer. However, as mentioned in Section II, signiﬁcant
concerns have been raised regarding the threats posed by
criminals, pirates, and terrorists to critical maritime systems.
Throughout the paper, we note ﬁndings that appear intuitively
relevant with regards to these speciﬁc threats.
VI. GENERAL FINDINGS
All four maritime VSAT networks included in our study
did not appear to apply encryption by default. Moreover, a
superﬁcial review of an additional 11 VSAT network streams
did not uncover any fully encrypted maritime VSAT services.
While we cannot determine the full extent
to which the
providers we selected are representative of the global VSAT
industry, especially given our geographic focus on Europe and
the North Atlantic, this suggests that a large portion of mar-
itime VSAT signals transmitted using GSE are inadequately
