 4 Sun Dec 04 20:47:17 2005 error mod_jk child init 1 -2
The first three parts of the log are index, timestamp, and log level. Without considering these three parts, Here we assume that the variables in the logs are represented as '<*>', separated by spaces between tokens. What is the specific log template for the above logs?

A: mod_jk child workerEnv in error state <*>
B: mod_jk child init <*> <*>
C: jk2_init() Found child <*> in scoreboard slot <*>
D: workerEnv.init() ok <*>
