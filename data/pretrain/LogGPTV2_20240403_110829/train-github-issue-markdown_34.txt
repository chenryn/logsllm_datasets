All of the below testing was done with Fiddler. User and password proxy auth
in Fiddler was enabled the default way by doing Rules->Require Proxy
Authentication which requires user be '1' and password be '1'. The code below
does not contain the https section of the proxy as it's largely identical.
If a proxy is set on the session without user and password and Fiddler auth is
off, Fiddler is used correctly:  
`session.proxies['http'] = 'http://127.0.0.1:8888'.format(proxy_string)
session.request(....)`
If a proxy is set on the session with user and password, Fiddler returns proxy
auth failures:  
`session.proxies['http'] = 'http://1:1@127.0.0.1:8888'.format(proxy_string)
session.request(....)`
If I do exactly the same thing but send the proxy with the request directly,
both cases work.  
`proxies = {} proxies['http'] =
'http://1:1@127.0.0.1:8888'.format(proxy_string) session.request(....,
proxies=proxies)`
