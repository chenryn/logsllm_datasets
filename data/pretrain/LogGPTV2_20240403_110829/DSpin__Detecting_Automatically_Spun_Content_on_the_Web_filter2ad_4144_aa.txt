## Abstract
Web spam is a deceptive search engine optimization (SEO) technique that artificially inflates the search result ranking of promoted pages. A prevalent form of web spam today involves automated spinning, which modifies the text to avoid detection by plagiarism detectors. This paper aims to develop effective techniques for detecting automatically spun content on the web. Our approach leverages immutablesâ€”words or phrases that spinning tools do not modify. We implement this method in a tool called DSpin and apply it to two datasets of crawled articles to study the extent of spamming and the behavior of spammers.

## 1. Introduction
Websites compete fiercely for traffic, and many users visit sites based on search results. Consequently, websites use various SEO techniques to improve their search rankings. While there are legitimate methods for SEO, some "black hat" techniques use abusive means to gain an unfair advantage. One such technique is generating and posting web spam using spinning, which rewrites content to create new versions with similar meaning but different appearance. This helps evade duplicate content detection while providing backlinks to promote specific sites.

There are two main ways to spin content: manually, as seen in job listings on platforms like Fiverr and Freelancer, and automatically, using tools like The Best Spinner, XRumer, and SEnuke. Automated tools can generate and post thousands of spun articles with just a few clicks, making them a popular choice for spammers. For example, 52% of English content pages on heavily abused wiki sites were found to be automatically generated spun articles.

The goal of this paper is to develop effective techniques to detect automatically spun content. We consider the problem from the perspective of a search engine crawler, where the input is a set of article pages, and the output is a set of pages flagged as automatically spun content. We also use clustering to group articles likely spun from the same original text, enabling us to study spammers' behavior in two crawled datasets.

Our contributions include:
- **Spinning Characterization:** We describe the operation of The Best Spinner (TBS), a popular automated spinning tool.
- **Spun Content Detection:** We propose and evaluate a technique for detecting automatically spun content based on immutables.
- **Behavior of Article Spammers:** We implement the immutable method in DSpin and apply it to two datasets to study spammers' behavior.

## 2. Background and Previous Work
### 2.1. Role of Spinning in Black-Hat SEO
SEO techniques aim to improve a website's search ranking to increase traffic. Legitimate methods include improving keywords, meta tags, site structure, and speed. However, black-hat SEO practices, such as keyword stuffing and compromising websites, violate recommended practices and sometimes break laws.

One common black-hat technique is posting web spam with backlinks to a promoted site. Search engines have responded with algorithm updates like Panda and Penguin to penalize duplicate and manipulated content. Spammers have adapted by using spinning to make content harder to detect.

### 2.2. Article Spam Detection
Web spam is typically categorized into content spam and link spam. Content spam aims to craft pages to rank high for specific search terms, while link spam distributes backlinks to boost the page rank of a promoted site. Techniques for detecting content spam include statistical methods and features based on URL, host name, page properties, and content. Link spam detection often focuses on the link graph, using approaches like TrustRank, ParentRank, and BadRank.

### 2.3. Near-Duplicate Document Detection
Detecting near-duplicate documents is crucial for identifying spun content. Common approaches use fingerprints to reduce storage and computation costs. Shingles, n-grams hashed to provide a fixed size, and sketches, random selections of shingles, are used to identify similar documents. This enables a graph representation for similarity among pages, facilitating the identification of clusters of similar documents.

## 3. Operation of The Best Spinner
The Best Spinner (TBS) is a popular automated spinning tool. It allows users to select an input article, specify spinning settings, and generate multiple spun articles. TBS also includes a feature to validate spun content against plagiarism checkers like CopyScape. The core of TBS is a synonym dictionary, which we reverse-engineered to understand how to access and use it.

## 4. Similarity Metrics and Immutable Method
We evaluated various similarity metrics to determine when two articles are spun from the same source. The immutable method, which uses words or phrases that spinning tools do not modify, was found to be effective. By partitioning articles into mutables (words in the synonym dictionary) and immutables, we can compare articles based on their shared immutables.

## 5. Implementation and Evaluation
We implemented the immutable method in DSpin, a tool that identifies automatically spun web articles. We applied DSpin to two datasets of crawled articles to study the extent of spamming and spammers' behavior. For valid pages from abused wiki sites, DSpin identified 68% as SEO spam, 32% as exact duplicates, and 36% as spun content.

## 6. Discussion and Future Work
We discuss potential countermeasures spammers might employ to evade DSpin and suggest future work to enhance detection methods. Understanding and adapting to spammers' strategies is crucial for maintaining the integrity of web content and search results.

## 7. Conclusion
In conclusion, DSpin provides an effective method for detecting automatically spun content on the web. By leveraging immutables and understanding the operation of spinning tools, we can better combat web spam and maintain the quality of online content.
