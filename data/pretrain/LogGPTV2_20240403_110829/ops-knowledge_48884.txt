 "A": "CDNs cannot be used for malicious purposes because they are designed to optimize legitimate content delivery."
 "B": "Using a CDN can actually expose the attack infrastructure since CDNs log all the traffic that passes through them."
 "C": "Adversaries cannot use CDNs for proxying command and control traffic because CDNs are not designed to handle dynamic content."
 "D": "Adversaries can take advantage of routing schemes in CDNs to proxy command and control traffic effectively."
Answer: D
