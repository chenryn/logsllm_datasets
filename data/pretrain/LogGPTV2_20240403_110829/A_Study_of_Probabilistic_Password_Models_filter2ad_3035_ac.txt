oper Network (CSDN), a popular IT portal and a community
for software developers in China [2]. The Duduniu dataset
includes about 16 million accounts for a paid online gaming
site in China. The 178 datasets includes about 10 million
passwords for another gaming website in China. All 3 chinese
dataset were leaked in December 2011.
The ﬁrst 3 datasets are from American websites, and the
last 3 are from Chinese websites. The 6 datasets together have
approximately 60 million passwords. Information about these
datasets is presented in Table II.
Data cleansing. We performed the following data cleansing
operations. First, we removed any password that
includes
characters beyond the 95 printable ASCII symbols. This step
removed 0.034% of all passwords. In the second step, we
removed passwords whose length were less than 4 or greater
than 40. As almost any system that uses passwords will have a
minimal length requirement and a maximum length restriction,
we believe that such processing is reasonable. In total we
removed 0.037% of passwords that are too short, and 0.002%
of passwords that are too long. Length-4 passwords account
for 0.225% of the datasets, and we chose not to remove them.
Table II(a) gives detailed information on cleansing.
Dataset statistics. Table II(b) shows the percentages of pass-
words that appeared 1, 2, 3, 4, 5+ times in the datasets. Recall
that the Good-Turing method estimates that the total proba-
bilities of unseen passwords to be that of unique passwords.
We see that the two smallest datasets, PhpBB and Yahoo,
have signiﬁcantly higher percentages of unique passwords,
64.16% and 69.83% respectively, compared to 36.43% for
Rockyou. When combining all 6 datasets, approximately 40%
are unique.
Table II(c) shows the length distributions of the password
datasets, showing the most common password lengths are 6 to
10, which account for 87% of the whole dataset. One inter-
esting aspect is that the CSDN dateset has much fewer length
6 and 7 passwords than other datasets. One explanation is
that the website started enforcing a minimal length-8 password
policy early on, and only users who have accounts near the
beginning have shorter passwords.
Table II(d) shows the character distribution. It is interesting
to note that passwords in American datasets consist of about
27% digits and 69% lower-case letters, while those in Chinese
datasets are the opposite, with 68% digits and 30% lower-case
letters. This is likely due to both the fact that the Roman
alphabet is not native to Chinese, and the fact
that digit
sequences are easier to remember in Chinese. For each digit,
there are many chinese characters that have similar sounds,
making it easy to ﬁnd digit sequences that sound similar to
some easy-to-remember phrases. Indeed, we found many such
sequences occurring frequently in Chinese datasets.1
Table II(e) shows the frequencies of different patterns.
lower-case passwords are the most common in
While all
American datasets (41.65%), they account for only 8.93%
of Chinese datasets. The overall most common pattern is
lowercase followed by digits (33.02%), due to the fact that
this is the most common in Chinese datasets (40.05%). This
is followed by all lower-case, all digits, and digits followed
by lower-case; these top-4 patterns account for close to 90%
of all passwords. Upper-case letters are most commonly seen
preceding a digit sequence, or in all-uppercase passwords. We
also note that the pattern distribution shows a lot of variation
across different datasets.
Training/Testing Scenarios. We now describe our selection
of the training and testing datasets. We decided against merg-
1One such sequence is “5201314”, which sounds similar to a phrase that
roughly means “I love you forever and ever”. Both “520” and “1314” are
extreme frequent in Chinese datasets.
