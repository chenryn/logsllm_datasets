line (dead-air mike) to nearly 200 kHz bandwidth may be considered a 
microphone.  Even if a microphone could be positively identified by observing 
changes in spectral patterns, it could not be determined with certainty whether it 
was a legitimate and protected Part 74 usage.  
A dynamic database.  This must be updated by the license holder and checked by 
the unlicensed operator on a regular basis.  
A disabling beacon.  This signal would need to be demodulated by the TV band 
device and not simply sensed in order to maximize spectrum availability for 
unlicensed use.  This beacon should contain pertinent database information, have 
recourse from interference, and have the authority to serve as a proxy for the 
license holder.  Thus, it should be licensed and authenticable.  
For protection of wireless microphones and other transient protected devices, Motorola 
recommends the use of a disabling beacon.  The beacon should be licensed in the same class as 
the protected deployment, and should have information pertaining to the protected deployment, 
including deployment location coordinates, an identification (MAC address or call-sign), 
frequency/time usage information, and protected contour size.  The control signal could originate 
either from the protected deployment location or a nearby location that would still enclose the 
deployment within the announced protected contour.  Motorola recommends that this beacon be 
required for TV band devices in a limited number of channels, in addition to those required to 
20 
enable public safety and other critical users, to protect these operations and codified in 
Commission rules.31  
While the Commission is the regulatory authority for maintaining accurate and timely 
information on licensed television transmitters, distribution of database information can be done 
through a third party.  Necessary database information includes complete information on TV 
transmitter location ERP, HAAT, RCAGL, FCC service code, license status, and call sign.  The 
current format available on the FCC’s web site (at http://www.fcc.gov/mb/audio/tvq.html) is 
appropriate, but is lacking in completeness of the data (e.g., some ERP, HAAT, RCAGL and 
license status values are missing or otherwise inaccurate).  Accordingly, the Commission’s 
database records would either need to be updated or some other means for providing reliable and 
accurate information would need to be established. 
Rules should be codified as to which licenses to consider (e.g., licensed, construction 
permit, etc.) for interference calculations, and officially accepted contour levels for the multiple 
FCC service codes should be centralized to ensure that consistent calculations are performed by 
various equipment providers.  In order to maintain consistent radio operation across various 
equipment providers, mutually agreed upon propagation formulas, similar to the FCC CURVES 
program, should be utilized.32  Optionally, a universally accepted format, machine readable

Motorola notes that manufacturers of wireless audio microphones and in-ear monitoring 
systems like Shure, Inc. have participated in this proceeding and we look forward to further 
comments as how their use of the band can continue as TV white space is opened.

database of official contour maps should be maintained by the Commission or an entity 
designated by the Commission.  Such requirements will help ensure consistency in defining 
service contours and provide a high level of certainty about where radios are permitted to operate 
in the TV white space.  
As previously discussed, Motorola notes that this spectrum offers additional options for 
first and second responders in large, widespread emergencies/disasters.  The cognitive 
technology to be used in this spectrum can have the ability to take advantage of spectrum as it 
becomes available, provided that the database information is updated in a timely fashion.  For 
example, if a catastrophic event disables television broadcast facilities in an area, similar to what 
happened in Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina, the database should be updated to reflect this and 
allow the cognitive radios to access this spectrum until such time as the broadcast facility is 
repaired.  Having public safety use these devices as part of their normal communications 
equipment will help ensure that they are well positioned to maximize the potential benefits in 
times of wide-spread emergency or disaster.  Applications such as unit-to-unit (without 
infrastructure) streaming video can be very useful in analyzing an incident scene, yet requires 
significant bandwidth which could be made available in this spectrum.  The significantly larger 
coverage area of VHF and UHF spectrum compared to higher frequencies increases the utility of 
these devices in devastated areas where fixed infrastructure may be sporadic or damaged.

IV. 
OPERATION OF PERSONAL/PORTABLE DEVICES 
The Further Notice seeks additional comment on whether usage of personal/portable 
devices should be allowed in the TV bands and the means by which personal/portable devices 
can operate without causing interference to authorized users.   
Motorola, in general, supports the use of personal/portable devices in the TV bands.  Use 
of personal/portable devices in the TV bands offers an opportunity to support and augment 
existing public safety services.  For example, it would be possible to use unused TV channels to 
create a video link between a police cruiser and an officer in a building or other location remote 
to the police cruiser and obstructed from line-of-sight operation.  Another example where public 
safety could benefit would be at a disaster site, where a site-wide broadband system could be 
installed more simply and with better coverage than could be achieved with existing technologies 
at higher frequencies.  In both of these examples, the propagation and penetration of TV band 
signals acts to enable new services.33  
Motorola believes that significant commercial applications could also be enabled by 
operation of personal/portable devices in the TV white space.  In addition to the benefits noted 
above for public safety and other critical users the consumer market applications include 
streaming of multimedia signals in the home and on-site video for security in home and 
33  
Because of favorable propagation characteristics, one example is the use of vacant TV 
channels to provide precise personnel positioning in a portable device for First Responders and 
Public safety. 
23 
commercial venues.  In these applications, the propagation and penetration properties of TV 
band signals acts to enable and simplify services.34 
The Commission requested comment on means by which personal/portable devices could 
detect protected users in the TV bands.  Motorola believes that spectral sensing, while promising, 
has not yet been demonstrated to be sufficiently robust to be used as an exclusive means of 
recognizing and avoiding interference with protected incumbents in the TV band.35  A system 
employing spectral sensing in combination with some form of geolocation or database look-up 
appears to be necessary to insure protection of authorized licensed users.  Rules regarding 
spectral sensing could be relaxed at a later date as the technology becomes more proven.  
For the special case of networks of personal portable devices connected to outlets of a 
commercial cable TV system for the purpose of multimedia streaming in the home, Motorola 
believes that it may be practical to infer location and TV channel availability from control 
information provided on the cable TV feed.  Motorola suggests that the FCC consider this as an 
alternative to other, more general schemes for interference avoidance. 
34  
As previously discussed, Motorola believes that TV channels 14-20 should be limited to 
public safety use rather than general unlicensed devices.  
35  
As the Commission evaluates how best to enable spectrum sensing some pertinent 
documents for consideration include the “802.22 Key Sensing Task Checklist” available at 
http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/802/22/Meeting_documents/2006_Oct/22-06-0183-01-0000-Key-
Spectrum-Sensing-Tasks.doc and the “802.22 Sensing Test Plan” available at

V. 
CONCLUSION. 
Use of the TV white space spectrum for low powered devices will provide the 
opportunity to serve a variety of commercial and public safety related communications 
requirements.  However, the FCC should proceed in a cautious manner at this point in time given 
the nascent state of spectrum sensing techniques and other spectrum access methods that must be 
refined to ensure interference protection to incumbent and protected facilities.  As products are 
improved and new cognitive techniques are developed, the FCC can possibly expand its policies 
to make even more effective use of spectrum allocated to the TV broadcast services.  For now, 
the Commission should focus on policies that enhance the usability of this spectrum for public 
safety and other critical use applications consistent with the recommendations contained herein.

Appendix 
Operation of low power data devices on TV channels 14-20 requires the protection of licensed 
land mobile radio (“LMR”) facilities that are operational in 13 markets across the country.  Such 
protection should be established through “exclusion zones” surrounding the relevant cities where 
use of low power devices would not be permitted.  The derivation of exclusion zones necessary 
to protect public safety and other LMR narrowband receivers requires that one consider the 
undesired signal’s power spectral density, antenna heights and terrain in the path loss estimation.   
The size of the exclusion zone depends upon the power falling within the bandwidth of the 
victim receiver and on the power spectral density of the interferer.  While maximum transmit 
power output and EIRP have been defined (1 watt and 4 watts, respectively), the bandwidth over 
which the unlicensed signal is spread is not clearly defined.   
The exclusion zone size can be calculated for different power spectral densities.  Figure 1 plots 
the required exclusion zone beyond the nominal 130 km radius for 4 W EIRP over bandwidths of 
25 kHz, 250 kHz, 1.25 MHz, 2.5 MHz, and 5 MHz for 10 m antenna height consumer premises 
equipment and 2 m height narrowband LMR receivers.  An omni-directional unlicensed 
transmitter antenna pattern was assumed.  These results were generated using the NTIA irregular 
terrain propagation model (available at http://ntiacsd.ntia.doc.gov/msam/ITM/itm.htm).  The 
parameters that were used to calculate these results are shown in Table I.

Figure 1.  Graph of required exclusion zone beyond nominal 130 km radius for 4 W EIRP 
over various modulation bandwidths and terrain variations. 
As shown, modulation bandwidth or power spectral density has a significant impact on the 
required exclusion zone.  If unlicensed fixed access were allowed to transmit at 4 watts EIRP in a 
25 kHz bandwidth, exclusion zone beyond 130 km protection zone is approximately 40 km.  
Terrain variation has a significant impact at narrower bandwidths with higher power density.   
Occupied bandwidth is not necessarily the same as modulation bandwidth.  For example, a 1700-
subcarrier OFDMA with 3 kHz sub-carrier spacing would occupy 5.1 MHz if all sub-carriers 
were assigned.  Power spectral density would be about -2 dBm/3 kHz bandwidth for 1 watt 
power output.  Additional exclusion zone for protection from interference into 25 kHz bandwidth 
would follow the 5 MHz curve above, or about 7 km.  However, a single user may only be 
allocated a fraction of those carriers, e.g., if 85 sub-carriers were allocated to a single user, this 
would correspond to a 255 kHz modulation bandwidth for power spectral density calculation.  
These sub-carriers do not have to be assigned adjacent to each other, they could occupy the 
entire TV channel bandwidth.  If entire power output could be applied to that single user’s signal, 
and equally to each sub-carrier, power spectral density would be about 11 dBm/3 kHz 
bandwidth.  Additional exclusion zone into 25 kHz bandwidth would be approximately 17 km.   
-A3- 
If maximum conducted power spectral density of 8 dBm/3 kHz bandwidth is mandated by the 
FCC, as defined in Section 15.247(e) for unlicensed digital modulation, the exclusion zone 
required beyond the 130 km Land Mobile protection zone is approximately 15 km, which yields 
a total exclusion zone of 145 kilometers from the center city coordinates.  This is only somewhat 
greater than the 134 kilometer exclusion zones proposed in the original Notice of Proposed Rule 
Making in this proceeding.1   
Use of contour analysis for nearby interferers tends to underestimate interference potential into 
LMR.  LMR systems are normally designed for better than 90% reliability in a faded 
environment at edge of service area, which requires > 30 dB C/I between median signal levels.  
Typical LMR contour analysis uses 39 dBu F(50,50) service area contour versus 21 dBu 
F(50,10) interference contour at 2 m victim receiver antenna height, for a D/U of 18 dB.  For 
distant interferers, delta between F(50,50) and equivalent F(50,10) contours is 10-14 dB.  
Therefore delta between median signal levels is 18 dB D/U + 10 to 14 dB delta = 28 to 32 dB 
C/I.  As distance between interferer and victim decreases, delta between F(50,50) and F(50,10) 
contours declines, until at about 15 km they are the same.  C/I based upon contour analysis 
declines from 30 dB for distant interferers to only 18 dB for nearby interferers, resulting in less 
protection than is actually required.  If original 21 dBu F(50,10) interference contour were 
converted to a median signal, about 9 dBu F(50,50), the 30 dB C/I would be maintained for both 
distant and nearby interferers.   
In conclusion, Motorola recommends that for protection of co-channel operation on channels 14 
– 20 in the vicinity of the affected metropolitan areas that the FCC limit the power spectral 
density and establish both co-channel and adjacent channel exclusion zones.  Specifically, all 
devices should have power spectral density conducted from the intentional radiator to the 
antenna to be no greater than 8 dBm in any 3 kHz band during any time interval of continuous 
transmission.  With this limitation established, it is then appropriate to adopt 145 kilometer 
exclusion zones around the center city coordinates of the cities that share TV channels 14-20 for 
land mobile services.   
With regard to operation on TV channels that are adjacent to land mobile use of TV channels 14-
20, Motorola’s analysis agrees with the FCC’s original proposal to adopt 131 kilometer 
exclusion zones from the center city coordinates.2  These same exclusion zones will need to be 
applied to areas where the FCC has agreed to allow land mobile use on TV channels 14-20 
beyond the 13 specified markets in Section 90.303 of its rules.3
