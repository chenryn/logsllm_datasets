Basic JavaScript: Waypoint: Generate Random Whole Numbers within a Range
(http://freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-generate-random-whole-numbers-
within-a-range)
I've tried this over and over for about an hour and I've looked it up on
Google and from what I can see, I'm doing this right.
Here is my code which I believe is correct...
var min = 0;  
var max = 12;  
function myFunction() {  
// Make myFunction return a random number between zero and nine instead of a
decimal  
// Only change code below this line.
return Math.floor(Math.random() * (9 - 1 + 1)) + 1;  
}
// Only change code above this line.  
// We use this function to show you the value of your variable in your output
box.  
(function(){return(myFunction());})();
Depending on the number that is generated, it's either correct on 2 out of 3
points none.
No matter what I do, I can't get the third point. I'm pretty sure it's a bug
because I've looked this up and the fact is that the results of my code give
what the exercise is asking for.
Here is the readout...
assert(myFunction() >= min, 'The random number that's generated by myFunction
should be greater than or equal to the minimum number');  
assert(myFunction() = 2 &&
editor.getValue().match(/min/g).length >= 2 &&
editor.getValue().match(/Math.floor/g) &&
editor.getValue().match(/Math.random/g)){return(true);}else{return(false);}})(),
'You should be using the function given in the description to calculate the
random in number in a range');You should be using the function given in the
