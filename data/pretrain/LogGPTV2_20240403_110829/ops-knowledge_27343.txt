**User:**
I have been following advice from StackOverflow posts, and I need to verify that I have `libmysqlclient.16.dylib` on my system in order to use MySQLdb. How can I locate this file on OS X 10.8?

**Assistant:**
To locate the `libmysqlclient.16.dylib` file on your system, you can use the following command in the terminal:

```sh
sudo find / -iname libmysqlclient.*
```

This command will search the entire file system for any files that match the pattern `libmysqlclient.*`, regardless of case. The `sudo` prefix ensures that you have the necessary permissions to search all directories.
