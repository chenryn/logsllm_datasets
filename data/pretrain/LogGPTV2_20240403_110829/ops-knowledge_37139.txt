User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Nginx: Bad Gateway 502 error I am running Nginx with PHP5-FPM on Amazon EC2 on Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit. I get a bad gateway error whenever I got to my site. I know that it is a configuration issue but I am not sure what is badly configured.

My error log:

If anyone can help me figure this out, I will really appreciate it.

Assistant: php-fpm isn't running. Restart the service.
