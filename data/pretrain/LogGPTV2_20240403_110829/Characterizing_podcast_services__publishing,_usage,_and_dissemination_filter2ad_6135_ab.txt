3. PUBLISHERS AND CONTENT
In this section, we present a statistical analysis of the pod-
cast service from the publishers’ perspective. Speciﬁcally, we
ﬁrst identify typical podcast publishers. For example, are
podcasts published by traditional broadcasters such as hbo,
bbc, nyt, or by independent creators? Then, we categorize
podcasts according to the mime type (audio, video, appli-
cation, or other) of the corresponding ﬁles and the type of
contents (news, music, entertainment, etc.). We ﬁnally an-
alyze how episodes of a given podcast are released in time,
and characterize the sizes of these episodes depending on the
type of the corresponding podcast.
3.1 Publishers
Podcasts are created and published by traditional broad-
casters, such as TV/radio channels or newspapers, but also
by more independent creators. The big names of broad-
casting usually publish their podcasts on their respective
websites, see e.g., www.hbo.com/podcasts, whereas inde-
pendent podcasters may publish their podcasts also on social
networking websites (either specialized in podcasting, e.g.,
feedburner.google.com, mypodcast.com, or not, e.g.
face-
book.com). Fig. 2 shows the distribution of the number
of podcasts published on a single url domain1 (i.e., repre-
senting a single publisher) for the Zune data set. Url do-
mains publishing a single podcast cover 37% of the pod-
casts, whereas 25% of podcasts are published through a
single publisher, namely feedburner.google.com (previously
feeds.feedburner.com). The second and third most impor-
tant url domains in terms of the number of podcasts cor-
respond to radio websites (npr and bbc), but they publish
roughly 10 times less podcasts than feedburner.
Interest-
ingly, we observe that the url domain does not inﬂuence the
number of user subscriptions a podcast receives. In other
words, the percentage of user subscriptions per podcast ap-
pears independent as to where the podcast is published.
This implies that publishing a podcast in a high-proﬁle ag-
gregator site does not provide advantages with respect to
1A url domain is identiﬁed by the ﬁrst block of the url
name.
For example, “edition.cnn.com/tech” and “edi-
tion.cnn.com/services” belong to the same domain, but not
to the same domain as “weather.edition.cnn.com/”.

3.2 Content of Podcasts
The very ﬁrst podcasts were meant to put prerecorded ra-
dio programs online. Today, the majority of podcast ﬁles are
still audio ﬁles; however, we observe an increasing diversity
both in the type of ﬁles released by podcasters, and in the
type of contents. Table 1 shows the fraction of ﬁles of the
diﬀerent mime types. Video ﬁles are the second most pod-
casted types of ﬁles. Note that in the Zune and iTunes UK
data sets, the mime type “Other” represents a non-negligible
fraction of the set of ﬁles - we were unfortunately unable to
identify the actual type of most of these ﬁles. The mime
type “Application” is rare and corresponds, in most cases,
to text documents (pdf, ms word) and to binary ﬁles (most
likely sildeshows). We have also manually categorized ﬁles
from the three data sets depending on the type of their con-
tent. The categorization was based on keywords of the xml
ﬁles according to the categories provided by the Zune Social
service (see Section 2), with less than 30% of podcasts (per
data set) not being classiﬁed. The results are reported in
Table 2. Entertainment, music and news podcasts represent
between 50 and 75% of the podcasts depending on the data
set considered. Regarding the Zune service, the most com-
mon types of podcasts depends on whether all podcasts or
the 100 most popular podcasts are considered: overall news
is the most represented content, but among the most popu-
lar podcasts, ﬁles of entertainment content are dominant.
Surprisingly, we have discovered that a single podcast may
release ﬁles from diﬀerent mime types. This observation is
reported in Fig. 3, where we plot the fraction of the most

of diﬀerent mime type.

release time. The circles represent per-feed val-
ues while the solid line is the mean value of the
median ﬁle sizes over log-binned median inter-ﬁle

with the ﬁle size.

frequent mime type of released episodes per podcast. One
fourth of podcasts publish ﬁles of diﬀerent types. There
are basically two reasons for this: First, some podcasts do
actually release episodes of diﬀerent types, video and audio;
then, there are for some ﬁles problems of classiﬁcation, e.g.,
ﬁles with mp4 extension are classiﬁed as video, whereas they
might also be audio ﬁles.
3.3 Generation of Podcast Episodes
In Fig.
We now analyze how episodes from the same podcast
are released over time.
4, we provide the Cu-
mulative Distribution Function (CDF) of the median inter-
ﬁle release time across the various podcasts. For all three
data sets, a lot of podcasts (about 30%) generate and re-
lease episodes weekly, and about 10% of the podcasts re-
lease episodes daily.
In Fig. 5, we test whether the fre-
quency of release of episodes is correlated with the size of
these episodes. This does not seem to be the case: podcasts
generating high-volume episodes. i.e., videos, have statisti-
cally similar release frequencies to audio podcasts. We ﬁnd
that episode releases are spread evenly over working days
(about 17% of the episodes are released each of these days),
and over week-end days (about 7-8% of episodes are pub-

lished on Saturday or Sunday).
In Fig. 6, we show the
fraction of episodes released at a given time during the day.
Releases are roughly uniformly spread during the day, but
exhibit higher activity around midnight (4 to 6 AM UTC)
and around noon (3 to 6 PM UTC).
3.4 File Sizes and Rates of Podcasts
We now examine the statistical properties of the sizes of
released episodes, and those of the rates of podcasts. Fig.
7 shows the range of the size of ﬁles for the same podcast.
We observe that very few ﬁles exceed 100 Mbytes - which
also happens to be the maximum ﬁle size recommended for
YouTube videos. Fig. 8 presents the CDF of the sizes of
ﬁles of given mime type across all ﬁles. The median size of
video ﬁles is about 30 Mbytes, whereas the median size of
audio ﬁles is rather close to 15 Mbytes. These numbers are
consistent with past studies that estimated a median size of
22 MBytes [3]. Computing the ﬁle size CDF per podcast
(Fig. 9) results in similar observations. Table 3 summarizes
the median and mean ﬁle size across the various types.
213Figure 7: File size range per feed. Most ﬁles are less
than 100 Mbytes.
Figure 9: File size per podcast across diﬀerent mime
types. The distributions appear similar to the ones
in Fig. 8.
Figure 8: File size CDF across diﬀerent mime types.
The median is around 30Mbytes and 15Mbytes for
video and audio ﬁles respectively.
We also investigate whether podcasts deliver episodes of
the same sizes: Fig. 10 presents the CDF of the coeﬃcient
of variations of the ﬁles within a given podcast. We ﬁnd
that 80% of the podcasts release always ﬁles of similar sizes
- a coeﬃcient of variation less than 2. Podcasts publishing
ﬁles of very diﬀerent sizes coincide with podcasts delivering
ﬁles of diﬀerent mime types.
Finally, we examine the publishing rates of podcasts in
terms of Mbytes and ﬁles per week in Figures 11 and 12 re-
spectively. The ﬁgures show that typically podcasts publish
roughly a ﬁle per week or around 20 Mbytes worth of data
per week. These numbers are especially relevant for dissem-
ination scenarios, as they provide some hints on what the
required synchronization frequency of content might be.
4. USAGE
We now focus on podcast usage and how users subscribe to
podcasts and play podcast episodes. Speciﬁcally, we provide
a characterization of the following properties.
• Podcast subscriptions and consumption of podcasts by
users over diﬀerent timescales.
• The existence of podcast popularity reinforcements.
Figure 10: File size coeﬃcient of variation per pod-
cast. 80% of the podcasts release episodes of similar
sizes.
• The existence of user information gateways bringing
new podcasts into the service.
4.1 User Subscriptions
The service has experienced a signiﬁcant growth during
the period of the study. Fig. 13 presents new users observed
as a cumulative fraction of the total population over the
whole dataset. The ﬁgure highlights that the population
of podcast users increased by roughly 250% during the 70
days of the study. We observe an increase in the overall
subsscription rate around day 37 which we have attributed
to changes in the interface of the Zune Social service. Note
that 40% of the users appear at day 0 in the ﬁgure, which
is a side-eﬀect of inferring existing subscriptions to podcasts
(see Sec. 2).
Fig. 14 shows the distribution of the number of subscrip-
tions per user which has a median value of 3 and it exceeds
40 for only as few as 1% of users. The mean number of sub-
scriptions per user is double the median indicating a skewed
distribution where a few users have many subscriptions and
most have a few. The number of subscriptions per user is es-
pecially relevant for dissemination scenarios as it reﬂects the
requirements on transfer rates and storage to synchronize
