User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Troubleshooting mailserver (Postfix, Dovecot) on Ubuntu Server 9.10? I have configured a mail server with Postfix and Dovecot on Ubuntu Server 9.10. I followed the guidelines here (using Maildir):
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Postfix
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Dovecot

The tests seemed alright so I connected it to GMail which is able to connect and fetch e-mails. But since there's no e-mail in the Maildir/ directory I can't decide if the problem is Postfix or Dovecot. And I am totally new to mailservers so I don't know where to start troubleshooting.

So, I want to start by testing Dovecot. How can I create a fake "Hello World"-email directly on the server (using a text editor) so that I can try to fetch it with GMail?

If Dovecot is alright, where do I start looking for errors in Postfix?

Thank you for your time.

Assistant: Use "tail -f /var/log/mail.log" in a second terminal.

Install mailx and hit "mail" in a shell, type in subject and message. End the message with ..
