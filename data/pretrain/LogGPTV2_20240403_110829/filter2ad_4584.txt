ABSTRACT 
IP  traceback  can  be  used  to  find  the  origin  of  anonymous  traffic; 
however,  Internet-scale  IP  traceback  systems  have  not  been 
deployed  due  to  a  need  for  cooperation  between  Internet  Service 
Providers (ISPs).  This article presents an Internet-scale Passive IP 
Trackback (PIT) mechanism that does not require ISP deployment. 
PIT analyzes the ICMP messages that may scattered to a network 
telescope  as  spoofed  packets  travel  from  attacker  to  victim.    An 
Internet route model is then used to help re-construct the attack path. 
Applying  this  mechanism  to  data  collected  by  Cooperative 
Association for Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA), we found  PIT can 
construct a trace tree from at least one intermediate router in 55.4% 
the fiercest packet spoofing attacks, and can construct a tree from at 
least 10 routers in 23.4% of attacks. This initial result shows PIT is a 
promising mechanism.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) [1] attacks are one of the most 
pressing  security  threats  on  the  Internet.  Attackers  can  launch 
attacks from corners of the Internet, and the aggregated traffic can 
exhaust  the  bandwidth  (or  other  resources)  at  the  victim.  DDoS 
attack flows can be shut off by configuring IP source based filters if 
one can identify the malicious clients.   However, attack flows can 
use forged source addresses and thus source based filtering will fail.  
In addition to sending forged packets to the victim, IP spoofing can 
play a critical role in reflection based DDoS attacks. Examples of 
notorious  DDoS  attacks  that  make  use  of  forged  source  address 
include  SYN  flooding,  SMURF,  DNS  amplification,  etc.  [2] 
reported a DNS amplification attack  against  a  Top  Level  Domain 
(TLD) name server which severely degraded the service of the TLD 
name server for a long period. 
The objective of IP traceback [3] is to find the origin of spoofing 
traffic. If the origin of spoofing traffic is found, the attacker can be 
deterred  from 
launching  further  attacks.  Most  IP  traceback 
approaches  trace  the  spoofed  traffic  to  the  edge  of  region  where 
traceback is deployed. Unfortunately, the non-cooperation nature of 
Internet Service Providers (ISPs) means IP traceback approaches are 
only be deployed in a domain controlled by the single ISP, and can 
only trace to the edge of this domain.  To the best of our knowledge, 
there has been no Internet-scale IP traceback system deployed.  
In  this  article,  authors  propose  a  natural  Internet-scale  Passive  IP 
traceback (PIT) approach that requires no ISP deployment.  PIT

Figure 1. Passive IP Traceback 
analyzes packets collected from network telescopes, and infers the 
locations  of  spoofed  traffic.  The  intuition  behind  PIT  is  that 
spoofing flows may trigger ICMP error messages at routers on the 
path to victim.   These ICMP messages are sent to the spoofed nodes.  
Under the assumption that attackers use randomly forged addresses, 
some  of  these  ICMP  messages  will  be  received  by  the  network 
telescopes.  The  addresses  of  routers  sending  the  message  can  be 
combined  with  an  Internet  route  model  to  re-construct  the  attack 
path and find the locations of the spoofers.  
2.  PASSIVE IP TRACEBACK 
Figure  1.  shows  the  structure  of  our  Passive  IP  traceback  (PIT) 
approach.  It consists of the existing ICMP generation mechanisms 
on  routers,  a  network  telescope  to  collect  the  ICPMP  backscatter, 
and route model used to construct a trace graph. 
2.1  ICMP Generation 
Previous work [4] has observed that ICMP messages are  generated 
by  routers  on  the  path  from  the  attacker  to  the  victim.      CAIDA 
makes  use  of  1/256  of  entire  IP  address  space  to  collect  passive 
traffic and supplies the dataset used in this study. Through analyzing 
the 2008 CAIDA data set [6],   we found that the ICMP messages 
reflected  on  path  (path  backscatter)  are  non-negligible  both  in 
number and reflection locations as shown in Table 1.    Since the 
ICMP messages are reflected to the telescope, we refer to the routers 
sending these messages as reflection routers.

the victim. The distance is calculated  by  comparing  the  reflection 
router’s address and the victim’s address. The results show routers 
sending  the  ICMP  messages  are  generally  away  from  victim. 
Further evaluation work will be done using a router level topology. 
Figure 2. Address “distance” proportion 
Figure  3  shows  the  number  of  routers  per  attack  for  the  top  100 
attacks  each  month.    Attacks  are  ranked  by  the  number  of  ICMP 
messages (including reflection from victim and intermediate router). 
55.4% of the attacks triggered ICMP reflection on at least 1 router, 
and  23.4%  triggered  reflection  on  at  least  10  routers.  Though 
obviously this mechanism is not effective for all attacks, it works in 
a steady proportion of attacks. Given it requires no new deployment 
at any ISP or router, this result is acceptable. Heuristic link testing 
can be performed to trigger more path backscatter.

2.2.1  Path from Reflection Router to Victim 
If  all  Internet  routes  were  known,  determining  the  path  from 
reflection router to victim would be a trivial problem. However, it is 
impossible to achieve an Internet route map that covers all the ISPs. 
“Predicting” the route from one AS to another is not a new problem. 
Recent research [5] relies on training data model from known routes, 
and  inferring  unknown  routes.  This  model  can  greatly  reduce  the 
variety  of  all  the  valley-free  paths  between  two  nodes  based  on 
inferred  AS  relationships;  however,  false  negatives  may  occur 
because the policy and topology predictions may not be accurate. A 
more  suitable  model  should  balance  false  positives  and  false 
negatives. 
To  construct  finer  granularity  path  is  even  more  challenging  as  it 
requires ISPs to expose their inner policies.  However, considering 
the re-active ability of the victim, finer granularity path may be not 
of important value. 
2.2.2  Identifying Suspect Areas 
Finding  the  suspect  area  that  contains  the  spoofed  origin  is 
equivalent to finding the nodes from which the spoofing traffic to 
victim  will  pass  at  least  one  of  the  reflection  routers,  which  is 
actually a similar problem with determining the path between two 
nodes.  
Because the reflection router may be near the victim, a probabilistic 
method should be used to filter the results; otherwise the resulting 
set can become too large to be meaningful.  One simple method to is 
mark  all  suspect  nodes  with  the  same  probability  on  each 
(intermediate router, victim) pair in an attack, and accumulate the 
probability values to find the most suspect nodes. The accumulated 
result  on  all  attacks  can  be  used  to  help  reduce  bias  that  may  be 
present in one attack. 
3.  CONCLUSION 
This paper introduced a novel Passive IP traceback mechanism (PIT) 
that can help identify the actual origin of spoofed traffic. A major 
advantage of PIT is that it requires no new deployment at any router 
or ISP. Given the set of reflection routers observed at a telescope, a 
method to construct an attack path is also proposed.  Initial results 
show it is practical though not perfect.

2.2  Trace Graph Construction 
PIT  faces  a  new  problem  of  inferring  the  origin  and  path  of 
spoofed  traffic  from  the  incomplete  set  of  reflection  routers.  
Some estimates of the Internet topology have been published, but 
the  actual  path  between  two  nodes  can  be  affected  by  the  BGP 
policies, traffic engineering and non-negligible accidental factors [5].
