the earlier attacks discussed are used to forge a source ad-
dress; this one is focused on the destination address.

als to solve this problem (see, for example,

the two major
Routing attacks have happened frequently
by accident. In the most famous case, known
as the “AS 7007” incident, an ISP started ad-
vertising that it had the best routes to most of
the Internet. Even after they powered down
their router, it took more than four hours for
the global routing tables to stabilize.
As suggested here, more subtle rout-
ing problems are harder to diagnose. AT&T’s
dial-up Internet service was knocked off the
air for many hours when another ISP started
advertising a route to a small, internal net-
work. There are many other such incidents
as well.
Are malicious routing attacks happening?
Yes, they are, and the culprits are a very
low life form: the spammers. In some cases,
they’re hijacking a route, injecting spam, and
then withdrawing the route. The attack is hard
to trace, because by the time someone no-
tices it the source addresses of the email are
(again) either non-existent or innocent.
Defenses
A RIP attack is somewhat easier to defend against than
the source-routing attacks, though some defenses are simi-
lar. A paranoid gateway—one that ﬁlters packets based on
source or destination address—will block any form of host-
spooﬁng (including TCP sequence number attacks), since
the offending packets can never make it through. But there
are other ways to deal with RIP problems.
Filtering out packets with bogus source ad-
dresses would help against many forms of at-
tack. Too few ISPs do it, even though it is a
recommended practice [42].
One defense is for RIP to be more skeptical about the
routes it accepts. In most environments, there is no good
reason to accept new routes to your own local networks.
A router that makes this check can easily detect intru-
sion attempts. Unfortunately, some implementations rely on
hearing their own broadcasts to retain their knowledge of
directly-attached networks. The idea, presumably, is that
they can use other networks to route around local outages.
While fault-tolerance is in general a good idea, the actual
utility of this technique is low in many environments com-
pared with the risks.
It would be useful to be able to authenticate RIP packets;
in the absence of inexpensive public-key signature schemes,
this is difﬁcult for a broadcast protocol. Even if it were done,
its utility is limited; a receiver can only authenticate the im-
mediate sender, which in turn may have been deceived by
gateways further upstream.
This paragraph summarizes the essential dif-
ﬁculty in defending against routing attacks:
the problem can originate with non-local ma-
chines. That is, even if your routing link to
your neighbors is authenticated, they may be
deceived rather than dishonest.
More and more sites are starting to pro-
tect their routing protocols against direct at-
tacks. The most commonly used mechanism
is described in [50], caveats on key selec-
tion are given in [59]. Another mechanism
is the so-called TTL Security Hack [45]: if a
packet is supposed to originate on-link, send
it with a TTL of 255, and verify that on receipt.
Any off-link packets will have passed through
at least one router which would have decre-
mented the TTL.
Even if the local routers don’t implement defense mech-
anisms, RIP attacks carry another risk: the bogus routing
entries are visible over a wide area. Any router (as opposed
to host) that receives such data will rebroadcast it; a sus-
picious administrator almost anywhere on the local collec-
tion of networks could notice the anomaly. Good log gen-
eration would help, but it is hard to distinguish a genuine
intrusion from the routing instability that can accompany a
gateway crash.
[104] analyzes how stable routes are to ma-
jor name servers. The answer is encourag-
ing: such routes change very infrequently..
3.3. Exterior Gateway Protocol
The Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP) [65] is intended
for communications between the core gateways and so-
called exterior gateways. An exterior gateway, after go-
ing through a neighbor acquisition protocol, is periodically
polled by the core; it responds with information about the

1063-9527/04 $ 20.00 IEEE 
networks it serves. These networks must all be part of its
autonomous system. Similarly, the gateway periodically re-
quests routing information from the core gateway. Data is
not normally sent except in response to a poll; furthermore,
since each poll carries a sequence number that must be
echoed by the response, it is rather difﬁcult for an intruder
to inject a false route update. Exterior gateways are allowed
to send exactly one spontaneous update between any two
polls; this, too, must carry the sequence number of the last
poll received. It is thus comparatively difﬁcult to interfere
in an on-going EGP conversation.
One possible attack would be to impersonate a second
exterior gateway for the same autonomous system. This
may not succeed, as the core gateways could be equipped
with a list of legitimate gateways to each autonomous sys-
tem. Such checks are not currently done, however. Even if
they were, they could be authenticated only by source IP ad-
dress.
A more powerful attack would be to claim reachability
for some network where the real gateway is down. That
is, if gateway G normally handles trafﬁc for network N,
and G is down, gateway G(cid:1) could advertise a route to that
network. This would allow password capture by assorted
mechanisms. The main defense against this attack is topo-
logical (and quite restrictive): exterior gateways must be on
the same network as the core; thus, the intruder would need
to subvert not just any host, but an existing gateway or host
that is directly on the main net.
A sequence number attack, similar to those used against
TCP, might be attempted; the difﬁculty here is in predict-
ing what numbers the core gateway is using. In TCP, one
can establish arbitrary connections to probe for informa-
tion; in EGP, only a few hosts may speak to the core. (More
accurately, the core could only speak to a few particular
hosts, though as noted such checks are not currently im-
plemented.) It may thus be hard to get the raw data needed
for such an attack.
EGP was reasonably secure because of the
very restricted topologies it could deal with: a
single core that talked with a variety of stub
networks. It couldn’t possibly work for today’s
Internet, which is why it’s been replaced by
BGP [84]. But loosening the restrictions has
had negative effects as well: BGP is easier to
attack, since it’s conveying more complex in-
formation.
I asserted in the original paper that it was
possible to ﬁlter addresses announced in
routing packets. That wasn’t done in 1989;
today, however, major ISPs do ﬁlter adver-
tisements from stub networks they talk to.
But not all ISPs do that, and it’s not possi-
ble to do much ﬁltering when talking to peers
or transit ISPs.
3.4. The Internet Control Message Protocol
The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) [79] is
the basic network management tool of the TCP/IP protocol
suite. It would seem to carry a rich potential for abuse. Sur-
prisingly, ICMP attacks are rather difﬁcult; still, there are
often holes that may be exploited.
The ﬁrst, and most obvious target, is the ICMP Redirect
message; it is used by gateways to advise hosts of better
routes. As such it can often be abused in the same way that
RIP can be. The complication is that a Redirect message
must be tied to a particular, existing connection; it cannot
be used to make an unsolicited change to the host’s routing
tables. Furthermore, Redirects are only applicable within a
limited topology; they may be sent only from the ﬁrst gate-
way along the path to the originating host. A later gateway
may not advise that host, nor may it use ICMP Redirect to
control other gateways.
Suppose, though, that an intruder has penetrated a sec-
ondary gateway available to a target host, but not the pri-
mary one. (It may sufﬁce to penetrate an ordinary host on
the target’s local network, and have it claim to be a gate-
way.) Assume further that the intruder wishes to set up a
false route to trusted host T through that compromised sec-
ondary gateway. The following sequence may then be fol-
lowed. Send a false TCP open packet to the target host,
claiming to be from T . The target will respond with its own
open packet, routing it through the secure primary gateway.
While this is in transit, a false Redirect may be sent, claim-
ing to be from the primary gateway, and referring to the bo-
gus connection. This packet will appear to be a legitimate
control message; hence the routing change it contains will
be accepted. If the target host makes this change to its global
routing tables, rather than just to the per-connection cached
route, the intruder may proceed with spooﬁng host T .
Some hosts do not perform enough validity checks on
ICMP Redirect messages; in such cases, the impact of this
attack becomes similar to RIP-based attacks.
ICMP may also be used for targeted denial of service
attacks. Several of its messages, such as Destination Un-
reachable and Time to Live Exceeded, may be used to reset
existing connections. If the intruder knows the local and re-
mote port numbers of a TCP connection, an ICMP packet
aimed at that connection may be forged.5 Such information
is sometimes available through the netstat service.
A more global denial of service attack can be launched
by sending a fraudulent Subnet Mask Reply message. Some
5
In fact, such programs are available today; they are used as adminis-
trative tools to reset hung TCP connections.

hosts will accept any such message, whether they have sent
a query or not; a false one could effectively block all com-
munications with the target host.
Defenses
Most ICMP attacks are easy to defend against with just
a modicum of paranoia. If a host is careful about checking
that a message really does refer to a particular connection,
most such attacks will not succeed. In the case of TCP, this
includes verifying that the ICMP packet contains a plausi-
ble sequence number in the returned-packet portion. These
checks are less applicable to UDP, though.
A defense against Redirect attacks merits additional at-
tention, since such attacks can be more serious. Probably,
the best option is to restrict route changes to the speciﬁed
connection; the global routing table should not be modiﬁed
in response to ICMP Redirect messages.6
Finally, it is worth considering whether ICMP Redirects
are even useful in today’s environment. They are only us-
able on local networks with more than one gateway to the
outside world. But it is comparatively easy to maintain com-
plete and correct local routing information. Redirect mes-
sages would be most useful from the core gateways to lo-
cal exterior gateways, as that would allow such local gate-
ways to have less than complete knowledge of the Internet;
this use is disallowed, however.
Subnet Mask attacks can be blocked if the Reply packet
is honored only at the appropriate time. In general, a host
wants to see such a message only at boot time, and only
if it had issued a query; a stale reply, or an unsolicited re-
ply, should be rejected out of hand. There is little defense
against a forged reply to a genuine Subnet Mask query, as a
host that has sent such a query typically has few resources
with which to validate the response. If the genuine response
is not blocked by the intruder, though, the target will receive
multiple replies; a check to ensure that all replies agree
would guard against administrative errors as well.
ICMP attacks against routing have never
been very real. Anyone with the ability launch
such an attack can use ARP-spooﬁng much
more easily; that, in fact, has been done.
Early RFCs suggested that routers could
also listen to ICMP Redirect messages; a
later document [44] permits routers to ignore
such packets if directed to them. Routers,
almost by deﬁnition, run routing protocols,
6
This has other beneﬁts as well, especially in environments where
ICMP-initiated route changes are not timed out. The author has seen
situations where RIP instability following a gateway crash has led to
erroneous ICMP Redirect messages. These had the effect of perma-
nently corrupting the routing tables on other hosts.
which gives them a much better idea of topol-
ogy; hosts, by contrast, should not listen to
routing trafﬁc. (This contradicts advice I gave
in 1989.) That said, there is a current trend
towards hosts that know more about the net-
work topology.
The paper mentions a number of denial
of service attacks that could be launched by
sending spurious ICMP error packets. Those
became reasonably common in the early and
mid-1990s. But as systems started comply-
ing with the advice in RFC 1122 [1], that trend
died down; [1] mandates that most ICMP er-
rors be treated as advisory messages, rather
than fatal errors.
4. The “Authentication” Server
As an alternative to address-based authentication, some
implementations use the Authentication Server [96] A
server that wishes to know the identity of its client may
contact the client host’s Authentication Server.7 and ask it
for information about the user owning a particular connec-
tion. This method is inherently more secure than simple
address-based authentication, as it uses a second TCP con-
nection not under control of the attacker. It
thus can
defeat sequence number attacks and source routing at-
tacks. There are certain risks, however.
The ﬁrst, and most obvious, is that not all hosts are com-
petent to run authentication servers. If the client host is not
secure, it does not matter who the user is claimed to be; the
answer cannot be trusted. Second, the authentication mes-
sage itself can be compromised by routing table attacks. If
RIP has been used to alter the target’s idea of how to reach
some host, the authentication query will rely on the same al-
tered routing data. Finally, if the target host is down, a vari-
ant on the TCP sequence number attack may be used; after
the server sends out a TCP open request to the presumed au-
thentication server, the attacker can complete the open se-
quence and send a false reply. If the target runs a netstat
server, this is even easier; as noted, netstat will often sup-
ply the necessary sequence numbers with no need to guess.
A less-obvious risk is that a fake authentication server
can always reply “no”. This constitutes a denial of service
attack.
Defenses
A server that wishes to rely on another host’s idea of a
user should use a more secure means of validation, such as
