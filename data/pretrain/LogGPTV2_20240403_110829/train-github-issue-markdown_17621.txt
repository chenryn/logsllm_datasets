Getting this ICE:  
error: internal compiler error: trying to take the sizing type of A, an
unsized type
when compiling this:
    enum A {
        B(char),
        C([Box]),
    }
    fn c(c:char) -> A {
        return B(c)
    }
    pub fn main() {
    }
Heard on IRC that pinging @nick29581 may be good on this issue
