User: What's the best cross-platform way to get file creation and modification dates/times, that works on both Linux and Windows?
Assistant: os.stat does include the creation time.  There's just no definition of st_anything for the element of os.stat() that contains the time.
So try this:
os.stat('feedparser.py')[8]
Compare that with your create date on the file in ls -lah
They should be the same.
