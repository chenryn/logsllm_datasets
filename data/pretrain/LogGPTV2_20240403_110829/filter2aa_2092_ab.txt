# Challenges and Limitations in Victim Accounts and Crime Reports

- **Inaccuracy and Incompleteness**: Victim accounts and crime reports can be inaccurate or incomplete, which can lead to misinterpretation of the events.

- **Traumatic Experiences**: Crimes are often traumatic, and such experiences can distort memories.

# Research Design

- **Granularity of Crime Reports**: Crime reports may not provide the level of detail needed for accurate analysis. Previous studies on attacker profiling have used simulations.
- **Honeypot Considerations**: Honeypots can be fingerprinted, and attackers may deliberately change their approach to avoid detection. Additionally, the same IP address does not guarantee the same individual at the keyboard, and it is necessary to distinguish between bots and humans.
- **Ground Truth**: The study required ground truth data, as this type of offense had not been previously tested with Criminal Linkage Analysis (CLA).

# Experimental Setup

- **Modified Open Source Python SSH Keylogger**: A modified open-source Python SSH keylogger (strace) was used, available at [GitHub](https://github.com/NetSPI/skl).
- **Virtual Machines (VMs)**: Two VMs were exposed on the internet via SSH, with one account per user per box to prevent bot attacks. Deliberate privilege escalation vulnerabilities and fake data for exfiltration were included.

# Participant Recruitment

- **Participants**: Ten participants, including penetration testers, students, and amateur enthusiasts, were asked to SSH into both machines and attempt various tasks, such as gaining root access, stealing data, and covering tracks. All keystrokes were recorded during these sessions.

# Hypothesis

- **Behavioral Consistency**: Cyber attackers will exhibit consistent and distinctive behaviors while executing commands on compromised hosts, providing a statistically significant basis for distinguishing between linked and unlinked attack pairs.

# Analysis

- **Behavioral Domains**: The analysis was split into three behavioral domains, each with 40 behaviors:
  - **Navigation**: Moving through the filesystem
  - **Enumeration**
  - **Exploitation**: Privilege escalation and data exfiltration attempts
- **Metadata Variables**:
  - Number of milliseconds between each keystroke
  - Number of milliseconds between each command
  - Number of backspaces as a percentage of all keystrokes

# Metadata Variables

- **Non-Dichotomous**: These variables have been used in other CLA work, in addition to behavioral domains.
  - **References**:
    - Bennell & Canter, 2002
    - Tonkin et al., 2008
    - Filippoupolitis et al., 2014
- **Challenges**: Factors such as the length of the command, time to complete, and time spent interpreting or manipulating output can affect the results.

# Example Behaviors

- **Average Attack Time**: 133.34 minutes per host
- **Average Commands**: 243 commands per host
- **Root Access**: Two participants gained root access on Host A, and one participant on Host B.

# Similarity Coefficients

- **Comparison**: Each attack against Host A was compared to each attack against Host B, resulting in 10 linked pairs and 90 unlinked pairs.
- **Application**: An application was written to calculate similarity coefficients for the three behavioral domains and differences between the metadata variables.
- **Output**: A CSV file was generated containing IDs, paired status, coefficients for each domain, and differences for each metadata variable.

# Logistic Regression

- **Data Import**: The CSV file was imported into SPSS for direct and forward stepwise logistic regression.
- **Models**: Six models were created, one for each domain, plus an optimal combination/order of all domains.

# Results

- **Behavioral Domains**: Three behavioral domains (navigation, exploitation, and enumeration) can classify linked/unlinked offenses with high accuracy.
  - **Most Effective Predictor**: Navigation
  - **Followed By**: Exploitation, then enumeration
- **Correlation**: Strong positive correlation to the dependent variable for navigation, followed by exploitation and enumeration.
- **Metadata Variables**: Keystroke and command interval variables were not reliable predictors, and the backspace variable showed a weak negative correlation to linkage.
- **Statistical Significance**: Results were statistically significant for behavioral domains but not for metadata variables.

# ROC Curves

- **Results**: ROC curves were built using the results, with the following AUC values:
  - **Navigation**: 0.992
  - **Enumeration**: 0.912
  - **Exploitation**: 0.964
  - **Keystroke Interval**: 0.572
  - **Command Interval**: 0.58
  - **Backspace Variable**: 0.702
  - **Optimal Model (Navigation & Enumeration)**: 1.0

# Implications

- **Observations & Comparisons**: High levels of consistency and distinctiveness were observed, particularly in navigation. Combined with enumeration, there was no need for exploitation in this study.
- **Investigation Implications**: This method can link separate offenses to common offenders without atomic or computed Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), but requires detailed information.
- **Privacy Implications**: People can be linked to separate hosts/identities based on their approaches, syntax, and commands, even with anonymizing measures.

# Defeating CLA

- **Disguising Style**: Conscious changes, such as randomizing the order of command switches and switching up tools, can help defeat CLA.
- **Automation**: Automating these changes is challenging, but semi-automation using scripts is possible.

# Threats to Validity

- **Small Sample Size**: The study had a very small sample size and used willing volunteers who knew they had permission with no risk of reprisal.
- **Limited Scenario**: The study focused on Linux and a low-privilege shell scenario, which may not reflect real-world conditions.

# Future Research

- **Expertise and Temporal Proximity**: Further research into the effects of expertise and temporal proximity.
- **Real-World Data**: Use of real-world data and stochastic analysis.
- **Diversity**: Greater environmental and scenario diversity.
- **Automation**: Real-time or near real-time automation.
