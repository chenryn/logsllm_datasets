### Steps to reproduce this issue
This is not the issue, but the update of referenceCount log.
Originally, i don't know why we have to check the referenceCount before close
the connection.
    final class ReferenceCountExchangeClient implements ExchangeClient {
    	@Override
    	public void close(int timeout) {
    	    if (referenceCount.decrementAndGet() <= 0) {
    	        if (timeout == 0) {
    	            client.close();
    	        } else {
    	            client.close(timeout);
    	        }
    	        replaceWithLazyClient();
    	    }
    	}
    }
