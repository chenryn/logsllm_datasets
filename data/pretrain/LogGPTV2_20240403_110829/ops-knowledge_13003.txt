User: I'm writing a Python program that uses dd to write an OS image to a USB flash drive. Drives /dev/sda and /dev/sdb are mounted, in my case, with sdb being the flash drive I want to write to.
However, on someone else's system, the drive they want to write to might be /dev/sdc. How do I let the user choose what drive to write to? Preferably letting them choose by disk label, for user friendliness.
EDIT: Let me rephrase this: I've got the USB flash drives /dev/sdb and /dev/sdc inserted. I want to basically tell the user; "Which flash drive do you want to write to, sdb or sdc?", then write to the disk that the user chose. So far, I've found no way to do this.
Assistant: If your program is *nix-specific, I suppose your best bet is parsing the output of mount command.
It gives you mount points, user names, and FS names. Of them you could filter points mounted or at least writable by the current user, with a right FS on it (possibly vfat?).
