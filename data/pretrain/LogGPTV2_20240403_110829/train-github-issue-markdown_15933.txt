## Bug Report
**Current Behavior**  
`x += y` doesn't evaluate the `x` value before `await`ing.
**Input Code**
    let x = 0;
    async function test() {
      x += await 1;
      console.log(x);
    }
    test();
    x += 1;
**Expected behavior/code**  
`1` should be logged.  
However, `2` is being logged.
**Babel Configuration (.babelrc, package.json, cli command)**  
Preset 2015 and 2017.
**Environment**  
The website.
**Possible Solution**  
Convert `x += await y` into `x = x + await y` as a first step.
**Additional context/Screenshots**
