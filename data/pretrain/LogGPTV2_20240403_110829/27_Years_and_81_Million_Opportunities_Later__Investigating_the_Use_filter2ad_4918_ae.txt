### User Demographics and Email Usage

Of the total user base, 9,053 (24.41%) were categorized as scientific users, 2,169 (5.85%) as staff, and 19,002 (51.23%) as students. For a detailed distribution of email addresses across these groups, please refer to Table I.

### User Behavior Analysis

Our focus is on understanding the real-world implications of common usability challenges associated with S/MIME and PGP, including:
- General use of S/MIME and PGP.
- Use of S/MIME and PGP with multiple clients.
- Distribution of S/MIME certificates and PGP keys.
- Long-term management of S/MIME certificates and PGP keys.
- Leakage of private keys.

#### General Use of S/MIME and PGP

- **Encryption and Signing Adoption:**
  - 94.54% of active users never used S/MIME or PGP for sending emails.
  - 62.59% of active users received at least one email signed or encrypted using PGP or S/MIME.
  - 375 users (1.96% of active users) sent at least one encrypted email. Of these, 167 used PGP exclusively, 159 used S/MIME exclusively, and 49 used both.
  - 1,047 users (5.46% of all active users) signed at least one email. Among them, 446 used PGP exclusively, 455 used S/MIME exclusively, and 146 used both.

- **Usage Patterns:**
  - S/MIME users signed 33.58% of their emails on average after first using S/MIME but encrypted only 1.26%.
  - PGP users signed 4.90% of their emails on average but encrypted only 0.96%.

- **User Group Breakdown:**
  - Staff users signed more emails using S/MIME (3.26%) compared to scientific users (2.02%) and students (0.43%).
  - The use of PGP for signing was lower across all groups, with scientific users at 0.56%, staff at 0.06%, and students at 0.32%.

#### Use of Multiple Email Clients

- **Client Detection:**
  - We detected email clients for 48,269,184 (59.14%) emails, covering 13,951,522 (83.74%) emails sent by our users, 14,492 (82.55%) encrypted, and 377,377 (88.53%) signed emails.
  - 33,343,411 (40.86%) emails did not contain user agent information.

- **Common Clients:**
  - Thunderbird with Enigmail was the most common client for S/MIME and PGP, used to send 289,968 (65.35%) emails.
  - Outlook was the second most common, used for 80,758 (18.20%) emails.
  - For more details, see Table I.

- **Multi-Client Impact:**
  - 8,828 (46.07%) out of 19,161 users used multiple clients.
  - Single-client users signed more emails than multi-client users. For S/MIME users, the median percentage of signed emails decreased from 62.25% for single-client users to 1.58% for dual-client and 1.03% for triple-client users.
  - Multi-client users (74.90%) tended to use one client for signatures and not others, while 25.10% used signatures across different clients.
  - For PGP, single-client users signed 0.36% of their emails, with no significant difference between single and multi-client users.

#### S/MIME Rendezvous

- **Certificate Exchange:**
  - 601 users (3.14% of internal active users) sent at least one signed email.
  - 374 rendezvous events occurred where both sender and recipient exchanged public S/MIME keys.
  - 64.08% of emails between rendezvous partners were signed, but only 3.36% were encrypted.
  - Receiving an encrypted email increased the likelihood of future encryption to 13.95%.

#### Long-term S/MIME and PGP Key Management

- **Certificate Validity:**
  - 680 university email addresses had at least one actively used S/MIME certificate, with 496 (72.94%) valid until December 2020.
  - 203 (29.85%) email addresses had two or more certificates, with an average of 2.86 certificates per user.

- **Certificate Renewal:**
  - 364 certificate rollover events were detected, with 271 new certificates having longer expiration periods.
  - 229 rollover events occurred before the old certificates expired, on average 55.05 weeks before.
  - 42 late rollover events occurred 70.64 weeks after the old certificates expired, preventing S/MIME from sending signed or receiving encrypted emails.

#### Leakage of Private Keys

- **Incidents:**
  - Three instances of private PGP keys being sent via email in 2015, 2017, and 2018.
  - All keys were sent by users to themselves, with one key being less than a week old.

### Discussion

#### Limited Use of Email Encryption

- **Adoption Rates:**
  - Only 0.06% of emails were encrypted and 2.8% were signed.
  - S/MIME was more widely used than PGP, suggesting that S/MIME infrastructure and encouragement may increase adoption.
  - Future development should add more value to email encryption, such as accepting digitally signed emails for administrative processes.

#### Use of Insecure Keys

- **Key Security:**
  - Most keys used secure algorithms and sufficient key sizes, but many had no expiration date or were used after expiration.
  - Better prevention mechanisms are needed to ensure the use of secure and valid keys.

#### Impact of Certain Events

- **Snowden Revelations (2013):**
  - The use of email encryption doubled from 0.035% in 2012 to 0.07% in subsequent years, illustrating the positive impact of awareness campaigns.

- **COVID-19 Pandemic (2020):**
  - Email usage increased by 39% compared to 2019, with S/MIME-signed emails increasing by 76%.
  - Encrypted emails slightly decreased, possibly due to setup and access issues from home.

These findings highlight the need for improved tool support and awareness campaigns to enhance the adoption and effective use of email encryption.
