(24.41%) of our users were in the scientiﬁc user group, 2,169
(5.85%) in staff and 19,002 (51.23%) were students (cf. Table I
for a distribution of emails for all user groups).
Below, we focus on user behavior. We aim to understand
real world implications of the common usability challenges
(cf. [5], [20], [21], [27], [45]) with a focus on:
• General use of S/MIME and PGP.
• Use of S/MIME and PGP with multiple clients.
• Distributing S/MIME certiﬁcates and PGP keys.
• Long-term S/MIME certiﬁcate and PGP key manage-
ment.
• Leakage of private keys.
General Use of S/MIME and PGP. 94.54% of the active
users never used S/MIME or PGP for sending email. In
contrast, 62.59% of our active users received at least one email
signed or encrypted using PGP or S/MIME.
375 users (1.96% of the active users) sent at least one
encrypted email. While 167 users used PGP exclusively and
159 used S/MIME exclusively, 49 used both. 1,047 users
(5.46% of all active users) signed at least one email. 446 users
PGP exclusively, 455 users used S/MIME exclusively, and 146
users used both.
S/MIME users signed 33.58% of their emails on average
after using S/MIME for the ﬁrst time but encrypted only 1.26%
of their emails on average. PGP users signed 4.90% of their
emails on average but encrypted only 0.96% of their emails.
Breaking down S/MIME and PGP use into user groups, we
observed that staff users used S/MIME to sign their emails
more often than scientiﬁc users (3.26% vs 2.02%) and eight
times more often than students (0.43%) on average. In contrast,
the amount of PGP signed emails is smaller across all user
groups, with the scientiﬁc user group being at the top with
0.56%, the staff users with 0.06%, and students with 0.32%
on average.

refer to Table I.
Use of Multiple Email Clients. To identify email clients,
we relied on user agent metadata in emails. We were able to
detect email clients for 48,269,184 (59.14%) emails. Hence,
we could detect the email client for 13,951,522 (83.74%)
emails sent by our users, for 14,492 (82.55%) encrypted
and 377,377 (88.53%) signed emails. However, 33,343,411
(40.86%) emails did not contain user agent information.

The most common client used for signing and encryption
was Thunderbird in combination with Enigmail for PGP
support14. It was used to send 289,968 (65.35%) S/MIME and
PGP emails in our dataset. 80,758 (18.20%) of the S/MIME
and PGP emails were sent using Outlook. Table I provides
more details on the top 10 email clients.
Using multiple email clients posed additional burden on
the widespread use of S/MIME and PGP since users have
to synchronize their keys and certiﬁcates across all clients.
For 8,828 (46.07%) out of 19,161 users, we could detect
multi-client use. Table III provides an overview of multi-
client use across all users and S/MIME and PGP users.
Figures 5 and 6 compare how S/MIME and PGP users employ
signatures and encryption between single- and multi-client
users. Our data implies that single-client users sign emails
more frequently than multi-client users. For S/MIME users,
the number of signed emails decreases from median 62.25%
for single-client users to median 1.58% for dual-client and
to 1.03% for triple-client users. However, for power users
with more than three clients the number of signed emails
increases to median 17.48%. The majority (74.90%) of multi-
client users tend to use one of their clients for email signatures
exclusively and not employ signatures with other clients, while
only 25.10% of the multi-client users used email signatures
across different clients. In contrast, single-client PGP users
only signed 0.36% of their emails on average. However, we
did not ﬁnd considerable differences between single and multi-
client PGP users (cf. Table III for more details).
S/MIME Rendezvous. In addition to multiple clients, the
distribution of S/MIME certiﬁcates and PGP keys between
users poses another signiﬁcant challenge for the adoption of
email encryption. We focus on S/MIME certiﬁcate distribution,
since S/MIME clients automatically attach certiﬁcates includ-
ing public keys to signed emails. However, plain PGP clients15
do not automatically attach their public keys to signed emails
but require users to manually attach public keys or look them
up on PGP key servers.
Signed S/MIME emails were the most frequent crypto-
graphic emails in our dataset. Therefore, we were able to
investigate users’ interactions with S/MIME certiﬁcates they
received from their communication partners. Without addi-
tional effort for key exchange, S/MIME users who received
S/MIME certiﬁcates from others could encrypt future emails
to those senders. Below, we report on such behavior of users
in our dataset. 601 users (3.14% of all internal active users)
sent at least one signed email. Overall, we identiﬁed 374
rendezvous where both sender and recipient exchanged public
S/MIME keys due to sending signed emails to each other.
Most emails (64.08%) between S/MIME rendezvous partners
were signed. However, only 3.36% of all emails between
rendezvous partners were encrypted on average. Once one
rendezvous partner had sent a ﬁrst encrypted email, 13.95%
of all following emails were encrypted on average. Figure 4
14Native PGP support was added to Thunderbird 78 (June 2020)
15These clients do not have Autocrypt support
illustrates the distribution of signed and encrypted emails
between S/MIME rendezvous partners.
Fig. 4. Distribution of signed and encrypted emails between S/MIME
rendezvous partners. While they signed most of their emails, they encrypted
only few. However, receiving an encrypted email had a positive impact on
encrypting future emails between rendezvous partners.
Long-term S/MIME and PGP Key Management. Below,
we report on the long term use of S/MIME certiﬁcates in
our dataset. In particular, we focus on the replacement of
outdated certiﬁcates. Overall, we identiﬁed 680 university
email addresses with at least one S/MIME certiﬁcate which
was actively used. 496 (72.94%) of them were valid until
December 2020. 203 (29.85%) of these email addresses had
two or more certiﬁcates associated. On average, they used 2.86
certiﬁcates – one used up to 27 certiﬁcates.
Fig. 5. Distribution of S/MIME signatures and encryption for users with one
or multiple clients.
Since certiﬁcates expire and need to be replaced with
new ones, users need to create, set up, and distribute them
ideally very close to the expiration date of the old certiﬁcate.
Overall, we found 364 certiﬁcate rollovers. In 271 cases,
the new certiﬁcates had a longer expiration period than the
old certiﬁcates. 229 of the certiﬁcate rollover events we
detected occurred in time before the old certiﬁcates expired.
On average, they happened 55.05 weeks before the old ones
expired. Figure 7 shows that the majority of users often create

is not necessarily a security issue as long as the passphrase to
protect the key is adequate.
Key Insights: S/MIME and PGP users.
• More than 94% of all active users never used S/MIME or PGP.
• S/MIME users signed six times more of their emails than PGP users
on average.
• Using two to three different clients decreased the likelihood of
signing emails by 51.76%.
• On average, less than 3% of all emails between users who had
exchanged S/MIME certiﬁcates previously were encrypted.
• Leakage of private keys via email does not seem to pose an issue.

a new certiﬁcate shortly before the previous certiﬁcate expires.
However, we also detected 42 certiﬁcate rollover events that
occurred after the old certiﬁcates expired. S/MIME could
neither send signed nor receive encrypted emails in this time
period. On average, the late rollover events occurred 70.64
weeks after the expiration dates.
Fig. 7. Distribution of the time around certiﬁcate expiration for certiﬁcate
renewals in weeks. Most certiﬁcates were renewed around one year before they
expired due to an expired root CA certiﬁcate. The second most certiﬁcates
were renewed one week before they expired.
Leakage of Private Keys. Overall, we encountered three
instances of private PGP keys (and their private sub keys)
being sent via email in 2015, 2017, and 2018. All three keys
were sent by the users to themselves. One of those was a
freshly created PGP key (i.e., less than one week old). This
VI. DISCUSSION
In this section, we discuss the implications of our results
and recommendations for the future development of email
encryption in ﬁve key areas: Limited use of email encryption,
use of insecure keys, impact of certain events, challenges of
using multiple clients, and lack of opportunistic encryption.
Limited Use of Email Encryption. As illustrated in Sec-
tion V-A, we observed that only a very small fraction of emails
in our dataset was encrypted (0.06%) or signed (2.8%). While
we saw an exponential growth of the use of email overall
(cf. Figure 2),
the fraction of encrypted emails remained
consistently small. Our results also imply that S/MIME was
more widely used than PGP for both signing and encrypting
emails. Although these ﬁndings do not come unexpected in
the light of previous work [22], [26], [31], [32], [35], we
think they can serve as ground truth to conﬁrm previous
user study results and have value for future development. The
small fraction of email encryption and the fact that the use
of email encryption did not grow with the overall use of
emails suggest that both S/MIME and PGP are niche tools that
are mostly used by a small number of security-aware users.
However, the difference between the use of S/MIME and PGP
seems to give grounds for optimism. Our institution provides
an S/MIME infrastructure and encourages its use to improve
security and privacy without advertising it aggressively. These
ﬁndings are in line with results of previous works [1], [2]
which ﬁnd that many users do not use end-to-end encryption
for security reasons but adopt it along with other features.
Therefore, future development should look into adding more
value to the use of email encryption on top of security and
privacy. For example, more widely accepting digitally signed

emails for administrative processes could increase the value
of email encryption for a broader set of users.
Use of Insecure Keys. For both S/MIME and PGP, we
found only small numbers of insecure or outdated keys (cf.
Table II). The majority of keys used sufﬁcient key sizes (>=
2048 bits) for RSA and Elgamal and >= 1024 bits for the
DSA algorithm. However, we found a signiﬁcant number of
keys that had no expiration date set or were used after their
expiration date. In particular, most PGP keys were affected
(32.99% had no expiration date and 35.93% were expired).
While the widespread adoption of secure algorithms and
sufﬁcient key sizes is positive, the prevalence of key expiration
issues is a matter of concern. These ﬁndings suggest that
initial key generation by email encryption clients and plugins
works well and supports email users in setting up sufﬁciently
strong encryption keys. However, they also illustrate that tool
support to prevent the use of insecure and expired keys has
limits. Therefore, future development should look into better
prevention mechanisms that nudge users into only using secure
and still valid keys.
Impact of Certain Events. Our longitudinal ﬁeld data allows
us to shed light on the impact of speciﬁc events in time on
the use of email encryption. In the following, we focus on two
events: The Snowden revelations in 2013 and the COVID-19
pandemic in 2020. While this list is not exhaustive, both events
had signiﬁcant impact on the security community.
In 2013, Edward Snowden leaked the mass-surveillance
program of the NSA and other security agencies [23], [24].
Users of modern digital communication tools were made aware
of the signiﬁcance of end-to-end encryption for information
security. Compared to 2012 (0.035%), the use of email encryp-
tion doubled to 0.07% in the following years. While the impact
of the revelations on absolute numbers is limited, the use of
email encryption still signiﬁcantly increased. This incident
illustrates that awareness campaigns may positively affect
the adoption of end-to-end encryption which is in line with
an unprecedented growth of Signal users after a WhatsApp
controversy in January 202116.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, we found that more emails
were exchanged than before. This can be explained by the fact
that most of the institution’s staff worked from home and many
administrative processes that had been paper-based before the
pandemic were digitalized in 2020. Hence, for all emails we
noted an increased amount of emails sent (39% compared to
2019). However, the number of S/MIME-signed emails also
increased by almost 76% from 255,104 to 449,646 compared
to 2019. In contrast, the amount of encrypted emails slightly
dropped from 0.061% in 2019 to 0.050% and 0.051% in 2020
and 2021, respectively. Users might have had problems setting
up and using email encryption from home and accessing the
