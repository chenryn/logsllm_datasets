the RST or FIN bit set, we inspect the contents of the packets
for a block page signature, as described in §IV-C. We label the
measurement as censored by packet injection only if a known
block page signature appears in one of the packets. These cases
are the “payload collision (blockpage)” and “payload collision
(no blockpage)” columns of Figure 4. Again, we have high
confidence that these are true positives and negatives.
Matching RST or ICMP unreachable instead of SYN-ACK.
When a TCP SYN from the vantage point receives either
a TCP RST or an ICMP unreachable packet, instead of a
SYN-ACK, and the control node observes the same network
error, we conclude the site is down for everyone, and label the
measurement as not censored. These cases are the matching
“connection refused” and “host unreachable” cells on the left-
hand side of Figure 4, and we have high confidence that they
are true negatives.
RST or ICMP unreachable instead of SYN-ACK, at
vantage only. When a TCP SYN from the vantage point
receives either a TCP RST or an ICMP unreachable packet in
response, instead of a SYN-ACK, but the control node is able to
carry out a successful HTTP dialogue, this probably indicates
IP-based censorship observed by the vantage point. However,
there are other possible explanations, such as a local network
outage at the vantage point, or a site blocking access from
specific IP addresses on suspicion of malice [57]. Manual spot-
checking suggests that many, but not all, of these observations
are censorship. These cases are labeled as “probable censorship”
in Figure 4, and we discuss them separately in Section V.
Mismatched network errors, or timeout or DNS error at
control node. When the vantage point and the control node
both received a network error in response to their initial SYN,
but not the same network error; when the control node’s initial
SYN received no response at all; and when the control node
was unable to send a SYN in the first place because of a
DNS error; we cannot say whether the measurement indicates
censorship. These cases are the cells labeled “uncertain” in the
lower left-hand corner of Figure 4. We are conservative and
do not consider these as censorship in our analysis.
C. Block Page Detection and Discovery
Block page contents vary depending on the country and the
technology used for censorship. Known block pages can be
detected with regular expressions applied to the TCP payloads
of suspicious packets, but these will miss small variations from
the expected text, and are no help at all with unknown block
pages.
Nonetheless, ICLab uses a set of 308 regular expressions to
detect known block pages. We manually verified these match
specific, known block pages and nothing else. 40 of them were
developed by the Citizen Lab [21], 24 by OONI [37], 144 by
Quack [79], and 100 by us.
Anomalous packets that do not match any of these regular
expressions are examined for block page variations and un-
known block pages, as described below; when we discover
a block page that was missed by the regular expressions, we
write new ones to cover them.
Self-contained HTTP response. To deliver a block page, the
protocol structure of HTTP requires a censor to inject a single
packet containing a complete, self-contained HTTP response.
This packet must conflict with the first data packet of the
legitimate response. Therefore, only packets which are both
involved in a TCP sequence number conflict, and contain a
complete HTTP response, are taken as candidate block pages
for the clustering processes described next.
HTML structure clusters. The HTML tag structure of a block
page is characteristic of the filtering hardware and software
used by the censor. When the same equipment is used in many
different locations, the tag structure is often an exact match,
even when the text varies. We reduce each candidate block page
to a vector of HTML tag frequencies (1 , 2 , 3 ,
etc.) and compare the vectors to all other candidate block pages’
vectors, and to vectors for pages that match the known block
page regular expressions. When we find an exact match, we
manually inspect the matching candidates and decide whether
to add a new regular expression to the detection set. Using
this technique we discovered 15 new block page signatures in
five countries.
Textual similarity clusters. Within one country, the legal
jargon used to justify censoring may vary, but is likely to
be similar overall. For example, one Indian ISP refers to “a
court of competent jurisdiction” in its block pages, and another
uses the phrase “Hon’ble Court” instead. Small variations like
this are evidently the same page to a human, but a regular
expression will miss them. We apply locality-sensitive hashing
(LSH) [90] to the text of the candidate block pages, after
canonicalizing the HTML structure. LSH produces clusters of
candidate pages, centered on pages that do match the known
block page regular expressions. As with the tag frequency
vectors, we manually inspect the clusters and decide whether
to add new regular expressions to the curated set. Using this
technique, we discovered 33 new block page signatures in eight
countries. An example cluster is shown in Appendix D.
URL-to-country ratio. To discover wholly unknown block
pages we take each LSH cluster that is not centered on a known
block page, count the number of URLs that produced a page
in that cluster, and divide by the number of countries where
a page in that cluster was observed. This is essentially the
same logic as counting the number of websites that resolve to
a single IP from a test vantage point but not a control vantage
point, but we do not use a threshold. Instead, we sort the
clusters from largest to smallest URL-to-country ratio and then
inspect the entire list manually. The largest ratio associated
with a newly discovered block page was 286 and the smallest
ratio was 1.0.
V. Findings
Between January 2017 and September 2018, ICLab con-
ducted 53,906,532 measurements of 45,565 URLs in 62
countries. Because we do not have continuous coverage of all
results (below) might be quite different if we were able to
classify these more accurately.
Block pages. We observe 232,183 block pages across 50
countries, applied to 2,782 unique URLs. Iran presents block
pages for 24.9% of the URLs it censors, more than any other
country. In all of the countries we monitor, block pages are
most likely to be used for URLs in the pornography and news
categories (see below).
B. Synthetic Analysis
Combining observations of all three types of censorship
gives us a clearer picture of what is censored in the countries
we monitor, and complements missing events in each.
We use the “FortiGuard” URL classification service, operated
by FortiNet [38], to categorize the contents of each test list.
This service is sold as part of a “web filter” for corporations,
which is the same software as a nation-state censorship system,
but on a smaller scale. The URLs on all our lists, together, fall
into 79 high-level categories according to this service; the 25
most common of these, for URLs that are censored at least
once, are listed in Table IV, along with the abbreviated names
used in other tables in this section.
Table II shows the three most censored categories of URLs
for the five countries conducting the most censorship, based on
the percentage of unique URLs censored over time. It is divided
into four columns, showing how the results vary depending
on which of our test lists are considered: all of them, only
ATL, only CLBL-G, or only CLBL-C. Table VI in Appendix D
continues this table with information about the countries ranked
6 through 15.
Iran takes first place in all four columns, and Saudi Arabia
is always within the top three. The other countries appearing in
Table II are within the top five only for some test lists. The top
three categories blocked by each country change somewhat from
list to list. For instance, pornography is much less prominent
on the country-specific lists than on the global list. Iran’s
censorship is more uniformly distributed over topics than the
other countries, where censorship is concentrated on one or
two categories. These results demonstrate how the choice of
test lists can change observations about censorship policy.
Table III shows the top five countries conducting the most
censorship, for each of the three censorship techniques that
ICLab can detect, with the top three categories censored with
that technique. This shows how censors use different techniques
to censor different types of content, as we mentioned in §I. For
example, Turkey uses DNS manipulation for categories ILL
and STRM, but uses block pages for PORN and NEWS.
Figure 6 shows how often the various blocking techniques
are combined. For instance, in Iran we detect some URLs being
redirected to a block page via DNS manipulation (comparing
with Table III, we see that these are the URLs in the PORN
and BLOG categories), but for many others, we detect only
the block page. This could be because Iran uses a technique
we cannot detect for those URLs (e.g., route manipulation),
or because our analysis of packet injection is too conservative
(see Section IV-B).

these countries (see §III-D), in this paper we present findings
only for countries where we successfully collected at least three
months’ worth of data prior to September 2018. Among those
countries, five stand out as conducting the most censorship
overall: Iran, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, India, and Kenya.
When considering specific subsets of our data, sometimes
Turkey or Russia displaces one of these five.
A. Specific Results
We first present details of our observations for each of the
three censorship techniques that we can detect.
DNS manipulation. We observe 15,007 DNS manipulations
in 56 countries, applied to 489 unique URLs. 98% of these
cases received NXDOMAIN or non-routable addresses.
Figure 5 compares DNS responses from a vantage point’s
local recursive resolver with those received by the same vantage
point from a public DNS utility (e.g., 8.8.8.8). The upper
left-hand cell of this chart counts cases where there is no
DNS censorship; the other cells in the left-hand column count
cases where censorship is being performed by the local DNS
recursive resolver. The top rightmost cell counts the number of
observations where censorship is being performed only by a
public DNS utility, and the bottom rightmost cell counts cases
where censorship is being performed by both a local recursive
resolver and a public DNS utility. We observe censorship by
public DNS utilities only for a few sites from Russia, Bulgaria,
and Iran. The middle three columns could be explained as
either censorship or as unrelated DNS failures.
Packet injection. We observe 19,493,925 TCP packet injec-
tions across 55 countries, applied to 11,482 unique URLs.
However, after applying the filtering heuristics described in
§IV-B, only 0.7% of these are definitely due to censorship:
143,225 injections, in 54 countries, applied to 1,205 unique
URLs. (The numbers in Figure 4 are higher because they do
not account for all the filtering heuristics.) Packet injections
are usually used to disrupt a connection without delivering
a block page; block pages are delivered by only 3.4% of the
injections we attribute to censorship.
Another 15,589,882 packet injections—58% of the total—
are network errors received instead of a SYN-ACK packet.
These are described as “probable censorship” in Figure 4. They
could indicate an in-path censor blocking hosts by IP address,
but there are many other possible explanations. Our synthetic
