**ATT&CK ID:** T1074  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Data Staging

Adversaries may stage collected data in a central location or directory prior to exfiltration. This staging process can involve storing the data in separate files or combining it into a single file, often through techniques such as archiving. Interactive command shells, such as `cmd` on Windows or `bash` on Unix-based systems, can be used to copy the data to the staging location. This consolidation of data facilitates more efficient and organized exfiltration.
