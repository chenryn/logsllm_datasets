### Security Vulnerabilities and Misunderstandings in Project Submissions

#### 1. Unkeyed Functions
- **Unkeyed Function**: A function that does not use a cryptographic key, making it vulnerable to attacks.
- **Weak Cryptography**: Use of cryptographic algorithms that are known to be weak or broken.
- **Homemade Cryptography**: Custom-designed cryptographic algorithms that have not been rigorously tested and may be insecure.
- **Weak Access Control (AC) Design**: Inadequate or flawed access control mechanisms.
- **Memory Corruption**: Vulnerabilities that allow for the corruption of memory, leading to potential security breaches.

**Total**: 5 (6%)

#### 2. Insufficient Randomness and Data Handling
- **Fixed Value**: Use of a fixed value instead of a random one, making the system predictable.
- **Insufficient Randomness**: Lack of sufficient randomness in generating keys or other critical values.
- **Security on Subset of Data**: Applying security measures only to a subset of data, leaving the rest vulnerable.
- **Library Cannot Handle Input**: Using libraries that do not handle certain types of input correctly, leading to vulnerabilities.
- **Disabled Protections**: Disabling security protections, either intentionally or unintentionally.
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Vulnerabilities that can lead to the exhaustion of system resources, such as CPU or memory.

**Total**: 3 (6%)

#### 3. Error Handling and Control Flow
- **Insufficient Error Checking**: Lack of proper error checking, leading to unhandled errors.
- **Uncaught Runtime Errors**: Runtime errors that are not caught and handled, potentially leading to crashes or security issues.
- **Control Flow Mistake**: Errors in the control flow of the program, such as incorrect loop conditions or conditional statements.
- **Skipped Algorithmic Step**: Omitting a necessary step in an algorithm, leading to incomplete or incorrect results.
- **Null Write**: Writing to a null pointer, which can cause a program crash or undefined behavior.

**Total**: 0 (0%)

#### 4. Secure Log and Communication
- **Secure Log (P=521, V=532)**: Issues related to the secure logging of events.
- **Secure Communication (P=27, V=64)**: Problems with the implementation of secure communication channels.
- **Multiuser Database (P=15, V=65)**: Vulnerabilities in multiuser database systems.

**Totals**:
- **V=182**
- **P=94**

#### 5. Specific Vulnerabilities
- **All Intuitive**:
  - **Not Using Encryption in Secure Log (P=3, V=3)**: Failing to encrypt log data.
  - **Not Using Encryption in Secure Communication (P=2, V=2)**: Failing to encrypt communication channels.
  - **Not Performing Any Access Control Checks in Multiuser Database (P=0, V=0)**: No access control checks implemented.

- **Some Intuitive**:
  - **Partial Implementation of Access Control Checks in Multiuser Database (P=10, V=18)**: Implementing some but not all required access control checks. For example, failing to check authorization for commands that only admins should be able to issue.

- **Unintuitive**:
  - **Lack of MAC for Data Integrity (P=16, V=16)**: Not including a Message Authentication Code (MAC) to protect data integrity in the secure log and secure communication.
  - **Side-Channel Data Leakage (P=11, V=11)**: Allowing side-channel data leakage through packet sizes or success/failure responses in secure communication and multiuser database.
  - **Replay Attacks (P=7, V=7)**: Failing to prevent replay attacks in secure communication.
  - **Chain of Rights Delegation (P=4, V=4)**: Not checking the chain of rights delegation in the multiuser database.

#### 6. Misunderstanding
- **Misunderstanding**: When a team attempts to implement a security mechanism but fails due to a conceptual misunderstanding.
  - **Bad Choice**:
    - **Insecure Algorithmic Choices**: Five issues related to the use of inherently insecure algorithmic choices.

This structured format provides a clear and organized overview of the various security vulnerabilities and misunderstandings identified in the project submissions.
