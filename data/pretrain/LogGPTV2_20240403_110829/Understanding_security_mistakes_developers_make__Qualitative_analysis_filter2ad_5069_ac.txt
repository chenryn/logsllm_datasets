Two issues were typed as All Intuitive: not using encryp-
tion in the secure log (P=3, V=3) and secure communication
(P=2, V=2) problems and not performing any of the speci-
ﬁed access control checks in the multiuser database problem
(P=0, V=0). The Some Intuitive sub-type was used when
teams did not implement some of the nine multiuser database
problem access-control checks (P=10, V=18). For example,
several teams failed to check authorization for commands only
admin should be able to issue For Unintuitive vulnerabilities,
there were four issues: teams failed to include a MAC to pro-
tect data integrity in the secure log (P=16, V=16) and secure
communication (P=7, V=7) problems; prevent side-channel
data leakage through packet sizes or success/failure responses
in the secure communication (P=11, V=11) and multiuser
database (P=4, V=4) problems, respectively; prevent replay
attacks (P=7, V=7) in the secure communication problem;
and check the chain of rights delegation (P=4, V=4) in the
multiuser database problem.
4.2 Misunderstanding
A vulnerability type was coded as Misunderstanding when a
team attempted to implement a security mechanism, but failed
due to a conceptual misunderstanding. We sub-typed these as
either Bad Choice or Conceptual Error.
4.2.1 Bad Choice
Five issues fall under this sub-type, which categorizes algo-
rithmic choices that are inherently insecure.
The ﬁrst three issues relate to the incorrect implementation
