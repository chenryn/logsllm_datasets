User: Suppose we are using Git as a version control tool to manage code, and we need to create branches, merge branches, etc. in daily development. Please provide a reasonable Git branch management strategy
Assistant: reasonable Git branch management strategy includes the following aspects: 1. Main branch: usually the master branch, used to record the code of the online production environment. Under normal circumstances, it is not allowed to submit code directly to this branch, but to update the code by merging other branches. 2. Development branch: generally named the develop branch, which is the main code development branch and is used to record the code development progress of the entire team. Each developer creates an independent development branch from this branch for development. 3. Function branch: When a new function needs to be added, an independent function branch is created based on the develop branch, which only contains the code required to realize the function, and then merged back into the develop branch after the development is completed. 4. Bug fix branch: When you need to fix the code running online, you can create a separate bug fix branch based on the master branch, and merge it back into the master and develop branches after the fix is complete. 5. Hotfix branch: When an urgent problem occurs online and needs to be solved immediately, a Hotfix branch can be created based on the master branch for repair. Merge back to the master and develop branches after the repair is complete. Finally, you need to pay attention to the following points: 1. Code review is required when branches are merged to ensure the code quality of the merge. 2. Avoid merging too many codes at one time, and merge them in batches. 3. When merging code, it is necessary to update the branch in time to avoid code version conflicts. 4. The life cycle of each branch should be as short as possible to avoid management confusion caused by too many branches.
