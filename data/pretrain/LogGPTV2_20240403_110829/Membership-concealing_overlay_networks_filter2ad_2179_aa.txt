ABSTRACT
We introduce the concept of membership-concealing overlay net-
works (MCONs), which hide the real-world identities of partici-
pants. We argue that while membership concealment is orthogo-
nal to anonymity and censorship resistance, pseudonymous com-
munication and censorship resistance become much easier if done
over a membership-concealing network. We formalize the concept
of membership concealment, discuss a number of attacks against
existing systems and present real-world attack results. We then
propose three proof-of-concept MCON designs that resist those
attacks: one that is more efficient, another that is more robust to
membership churn, and a third that balances efficiency and robust-
ness. We show theoretical and simulation results demonstrating the
feasibility and performance of our schemes.

INTRODUCTION
One now-widespread threat to the freedom of online speech is
the practice of Internet censorship by private and state interests,
who use a variety of social and technological means to limit ex-
pression or availability of information. The Open Net Initiative
(ONI) [1], which catalogs world-wide censorship efforts, catego-
rizes them into four different categories: (i) technical blocking (such
as DNS filtering), IP blocking, URL filtering, and content inspec-
tion; (ii) search removal, i.e. suppression of web sites or terms from
search engines; (iii) take-down, the use of legal or regulatory power
to demand the removal of content; and (iv) induced self-censorship,
through intimidation including surveillance or the perception of
surveillance.
In 2006, ONI reported strong evidence of filtering
in 26 of 40 countries surveyed [13], with anecdotal evidence sug-
gesting widespread use of social and legal means as well. This
list includes Western democracies such as the US and EU mem-
ber nations. Such prevalence suggests that censorship by govern-
ments, ISPs, and corporations represents a valid threat to freedom
of speech on the Internet.
As more censorship-enabling systems are deployed, we will see
increased usage of censorship-resistance technologies – tools de-
signed to circumvent the technological filters. However, the use
of currently-deployed censorship resistance systems such as Tor
bridges [14] and Freenet [10] is problematic if they are explic-
itly proscribed.
If use of censorship circumvention technologies
is punishable, then any such system should also prevent the censor
from identifying the system’s participants. We call such systems
“membership-concealing networks,” and argue that many schemes
claiming to provide anonymity or censorship resistance are also try-
ing to achieve membership concealment.
This paper is concerned with the study of membership conceal-
ment as an end in itself rather than a means or side effect of another
goal. We introduce Membership-Concealing Overlay Networks
(MCONs), which are peer-to-peer (P2P) overlays whose member-
ship set is hidden from both insiders and outsiders. Such systems
should allow communication while obscuring “real-world” identi-
ties of participants. Overlays and membership concealment may
sound incompatible, since nodes must always rely on others for
communication and connectivity, but it is possible to minimize the
number of other overlay nodes who know the identity of any given
node, to the point where one only needs to disclose one’s iden-
tity to a small constant number of other nodes. Such systems need
pseudonyms to allow for one-to-one communication. Pseudonyms
should preserve unlinkability between MCON identities and real-
world identities, whether for targeted individuals or for a non-trivial
fraction of MCON members. Finally, MCONs must preserve avail-
ability by being robust against churn and support scalable and effi-
cient routing and search.

The concept of membership concealment is not new: organized
crime and terrorist networks routinely use compartmentalization to
hide the identities of cell members from people outside a given cell
(a network is composed of many cells, which mostly act indepen-
dently). Such networks are not foreign to the computer science
community either: overlays with some membership concealment
properties have been used for covert activity, such as sharing classi-
fied, censored, or copyrighted content. Generally called “darknets,”
390these networks are built to be difficult to join or detect, but most do
not protect from malicious insiders. One typically becomes a mem-
ber through social means: an existing member “vouches” for the
newcomer [5]. Academically, membership concealment networks
have remained less explored than, and frequently confused with,
related technologies such as privacy, anonymity, unlinkability, un-
observability, pseudonymity, and censorship resistance.1
Unobservability. Related to anonymity, unobservability is usually
endowed with one of two meanings. Pfitzmann and Hansen de-
fine the term to mean that a principal in an anonymity scheme can-
not be “observed” to be sending or receiving a message (i.e. other
nodes cannot determine whether a node sent or received a message
at any particular time) [35]. Some authors have interpreted this to
mean that it is difficult to distinguish whether a principal partici-
pates in the network or not [25, 19]. The former clearly does not
imply membership concealment: a scheme that is unobservable in
this sense would remain unobservable if all principals periodically
announced their participation. The latter sense is membership con-
cealment in terms of an outsider-only attack, since it is in general
necessary for some participants to be revealed to others in order for
messages to be delivered.
Pseudonymity and anonymity. Pseudonymous credential systems
[9, 31, 37] dissociate real-world identities from semi-persistent net-
work identities (pseudonyms). A real-world identity is any infor-
mation that may reduce the set of candidate identity-pseudonym
pairings by a non-trivial amount, such as names, credit card num-
bers, or IP addresses. MCONs must use pseudonyms to address
members, and for a system to be membership-concealing it must be
impossible, with overwhelming probability, to determine the real-
world identity of a user with a given pseudonym.
Anonymity, on the other hand, does not have the persistent iden-
tity property, but instead hides any and all identifying information.
Consider the relationship between anonymity and membership con-
cealment. The main goal of an anonymous network is to conceal
who is communicating with whom. However, this unlinkability
or “relationship anonymity” does not require concealment of who
participates in the overlay, and in fact a scheme with perfect rela-
tionship anonymity would not sacrifice this property if the list of
participants was broadcast on a regular basis. On the other hand,
membership concealment does not guarantee that messages can-
not be linked, e.g. each message may contain the pseudonym of
both its source and destination, destroying relationship anonymity
but preserving membership concealment. MCONs clearly require
some type of minimal pseudonymity to prevent a passive insider
from simply harvesting identities – for example, messages should
not include the real identity of the originator.
While aspects of some anonymity schemes in the literature can
be seen as implicit efforts to provide membership concealment, e.g.
Bauer’s scheme seeks to hide the users of a mix net among a larger
set of web users [4], no deployed anonymity scheme explicitly
claims to provide membership concealment, and it is largely ac-
cepted that sender anonymity (origin obfuscation) can be achieved
without it [16, 38]. Some schemes, such as Tarzan [21], explicitly
distribute a list of members. However, since this information sim-
plifies certain variants of the intersection attack [48], recent P2P
anonymity schemes such as Salsa [33] have mentioned hiding the
membership list as a security goal. Unfortunately these schemes do
not provide membership concealment under adversarial conditions.
Censorship resistance and availability. Censorship-resistant net-
works are designed to prevent adversaries from denying users’ ac-
cess to a particular resource or file. This type of system does

not require membership concealment: most are designed such that
it is difficult to determine what content a given user is accessing
or what node is hosting a given file, preventing targeted attacks.
Such systems remain censorship-resistant even if the list of partic-
ipants was public. Membership concealment does not imply cen-
sorship resistance: a membership-concealing network may serve
unencrypted content, so censorship would only require blocking
files that contain selected keywords even if the identities of com-
municating nodes are hidden. This is similar to the approach used
by China’s “Great Firewall” [50].
A particularly critical requirement for censorship resistant net-
works is availability, since an attack against availability is in it-
self an act of censorship. Some censorship-resistant systems [47]
have taken the all-or-nothing approach, assuming that an adversary
would want to disable access to selected content, but not to the en-
tire system. We advocate a strictly more powerful adversary model
– one that is willing to prevent access to an entire system in order to
block some targeted content. Events such as [2, 3] support our po-
sition. Even without joining a network or identifying its members,
an adversary can block access to “undesirable” content on a large
scale by using deep packet inspection or encryption-oblivious pro-
tocol fingerprints (and blocking matching packets). Infranet [18]
addresses this problem by using steganographic techniques to hide
content requests and responses. However, it requires active par-
ticipation of a number of web servers. Feamster et al. extend the
Infranet service by adding an extra layer of indirection in the form
of untrusted messengers, who pass requests to a forwarder, who
then fetches the actual censored content [19]. Tor bridges [14] (dis-
cussed in more detail in Section 3) add censorship-resistance func-
tionality to the Tor anonymous overlay [16]. The design is some-
what similar to Infranet with untrusted intermediaries, and both are
vulnerable to many similar attacks.
1.2 Proposed design
We propose three proof-of-concept designs – one that is more ef-
ficient, another that is more robust to membership churn,2 and yet
another which is a hybrid of the first two. All schemes are robust
against insider and outsider attack, including targeted attack and
network partitioning. Our MCON can be bootstrapped from any
social graph of offline face-to-face relationships. (Basing a network
on a social network graph allows us to use Sybil attack [17] mitiga-
tion systems such as SybilLimit or SybilInfer [49, 23].) Member-
ship is by invitation only, so our network is not “open” in the same
sense as other P2P systems, which allow anyone who knows at least
one member to become a member themselves. Finally, our designs
use distributed hash tables (DHTs) to enable efficient search and
ensure that both popular and rare files can be located within a pre-
dictable period of time.3 DHTs are structured overlay networks
that allow for very efficient searching [45, 39, 30]. Each DHT node
has a random pseudonym, is responsible for responding to queries
that are lexicographically close to that pseudonym, and maintains a
routing table of O(log N ) peers that enable it to efficiently identify
the node responsible for a query.
2. MCON REQUIREMENTS
Informally, we define an MCON to be a communication system
that hides the identities of its members from both insider and out-
sider attackers (network members and non-members, respectively),
while retaining members’ ability to communicate efficiently. The
goal is to reveal no information about the network participants that
would allow them to be identified in the “real world.” (From now

3Files can be arbitrary named data, so “locating files” does not
imply a traditional file-sharing system.
391on we will refer to the human participants as “users,” while de-
noting their computational presence in the network as “nodes.”)
Honest users have one fixed network pseudonym, which allows
other members to uniquely address them. (We will refer to overlay-
level identities as “pseudonyms” and real-world identities as “iden-
tities.”) For the purposes of this paper, we assume that obtaining
a node’s network (IP) address is both necessary and sufficient to
identify the real-world user of the network.4
In addition to hiding member information, this network must be
robust to link failure and partitioning: we must maintain availabil-
ity both in the presence of normal network events and attackers.
(A related requirement is node-equity, i.e. no node is more im-
portant to the network than another.)
It should also be scalable,
allowing for the membership set to grow while maintaining rout-
ing efficiency and minimizing communication, computation, and
storage overhead. Finally, it should provide efficient search func-
tionality, which can reliably locate any information stored in the
network within a predictable time window.
We assume an adversary with the resources of a large ISP or
state government. This means that the adversary can monitor or
