DoctrineAbstractBundle contains only the base DI extension used by all
Doctrine_Bundles. It was a good idea when we had all bundles in the core but
it seems wrong now that they are in different repos, updated at different
time. A change in it is likely to break another Doctrine_Bundle as the
testsuite does not check this for us to make us update them. So these bundles
may easily become broken because of an internal change in DoctrineBundle (like
what occurred in `3ca1ccb` for instance).  
The bad thing about it would be some code duplication between the different
bundles. @fabpot @jwage @beberlei @lsmith what do you think about it ?
Btw, the DoctrineBundle DI extension should probably be refactored to use
abstract service definitions instead of defining full services in PHP in the
extension. It would make it smaller (but this feature was introduced in the DI
component after writing DoctrineBundle). I will add it on my todo-list so it
is the right time to choose whether we keep the DoctrineAbstractBundle or no
(one refactoring is better than two).
