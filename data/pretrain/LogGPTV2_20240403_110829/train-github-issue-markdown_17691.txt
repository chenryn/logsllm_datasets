The `DoctrineAbstractBundle` currently serves as the foundational Dependency Injection (DI) extension for all Doctrine-related bundles. This structure was effective when all bundles were part of a single core repository, but with the current setup, where each bundle is maintained in its own repository and updated independently, this approach has become problematic. A change in the `DoctrineAbstractBundle` can inadvertently break other Doctrine bundles, as the test suite does not cover these interactions, leading to potential issues that are hard to detect and resolve.

For example, an internal change in the `DoctrineBundle` (such as the one in commit `3ca1ccb`) could easily cause compatibility issues with other bundles. The main drawback of removing the `DoctrineAbstractBundle` would be the duplication of code across the different bundles. I would like to hear your thoughts on this, @fabpot, @jwage, @beberlei, and @lsmith.

Additionally, the DI extension in `DoctrineBundle` should be refactored to use abstract service definitions instead of defining full services in PHP within the extension. This would make the code more concise and maintainable. This feature was introduced in the DI component after the initial development of `DoctrineBundle`, so it wasn't utilized at that time. I will add this refactoring to my to-do list. Given this, it would be a good idea to decide whether to keep the `DoctrineAbstractBundle` or remove it. Consolidating the refactoring efforts into a single task would be more efficient than doing two separate refactorings.
