User: How to load balance large-scale application systems?
Assistant: Load balancing of large-scale application systems can be carried out in the following ways: 1. Hardware load balancer: use hardware devices to distribute network traffic, and distribute traffic to different servers according to load conditions. 2. Software load balancer: Use software services to distribute network traffic, and you can customize rules to distribute traffic to different servers according to load conditions. 3. Cluster load balancing: The server cluster is regarded as a single logical entity, and when a request comes in, the load balancer distributes it to different servers. 4. DNS-based load balancing: through DNS resolution, requests are distributed to different servers. Either way, it is necessary to select an appropriate method for deployment and adjustment according to the actual situation, so as to ensure that the application system can achieve high availability and high efficiency.
