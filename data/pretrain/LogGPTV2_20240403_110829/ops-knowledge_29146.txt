User: What is containerization? How to implement containerized applications?
Assistant: Containerization is a virtualization technology that packages together an application and its dependencies, such as libraries and environment variables, into an executable container. Containerization enables applications to run in different environments without being affected by the external environment. Containerized applications can be implemented using a variety of tools and platforms. The most common of these is Docker, which provides a containerization platform that allows users to easily create, deploy, and manage containers. Users can use Dockerfile to define container images, use Docker-compose to manage multiple containers, and use Kubernetes to automate container deployment and expansion. In addition to Docker, there are other open source tools and commercial platforms, such as OpenShift, Rancher, and Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), which can also be used to implement containerized applications.
