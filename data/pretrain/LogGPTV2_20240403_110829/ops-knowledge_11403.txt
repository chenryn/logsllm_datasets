User: How to limit the resources of the system to keep the performance of the system stable?
Assistant: System resource limits are usually implemented in the following ways: 1. Memory limit: Set the maximum available memory for a process or application to avoid system crashes or slowdowns due to excessive memory usage. In the Linux system, you can use the kernel mechanism of cgroups (Control groups) to implement memory restrictions. 2. CPU limit: Allocate a certain CPU time slice for a process or application to avoid excessive system load due to excessive use of CPU resources. In the Linux system, you can use the cgroups kernel mechanism to limit CPU resources. 3. Hard disk limit: limit the use of disk space to avoid system failure due to insufficient disk space. Hard disk restrictions can be achieved by controlling file size, cleaning useless files, and setting quotas. 4. Network limitation: limit the use of network bandwidth to avoid network congestion caused by excessive use of network resources. Network restrictions can be implemented using flow control, etc. To sum up, for different system resources, different mechanisms can be used to limit the performance of the system.
