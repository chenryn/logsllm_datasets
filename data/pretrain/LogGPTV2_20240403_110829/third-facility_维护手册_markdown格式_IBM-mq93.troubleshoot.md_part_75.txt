### System Actions

The system's response to an error depends on when the error occurs:

- **During Offload Process:**
  - If the error occurs while offloading, the system attempts to read the RBA range from a second copy.
    - **If no second copy exists:** The active log data set is stopped.
    - **If the second copy also has an error:** Only the original data set that triggered the offload process is stopped. The archive log data set is terminated, leaving a gap in the archived log RBA range.
    - **If the second copy is satisfactory:** The first copy is not stopped.
  - **Message Issued:**
    ```
    CSQJ124E +CSQ1 OFFLOAD OF ACTIVE LOG SUSPENDED FROM
    RBA xxxxxx TO RBA xxxxxx DUE TO I/O ERROR
    ```

- **During Recovery:**
  - IBM MQ provides data from specific log RBAs requested from another copy or archive.
  - **If this is unsuccessful:** Recovery fails, and the queue manager terminates abnormally.

- **During Restart:**
  - If dual logging is used, IBM MQ continues with the alternative log data set.
  - Otherwise, the queue manager ends abnormally.

### System Programmer Actions

- **Check for System Messages:**
  - Look for system messages, such as those prefixed with IEC, and try to resolve the problem using the recommended actions for these messages.
- **Handle Stopped Active Log Data Set:**
  - If the active log data set has been stopped, it is not used for logging but can still be used for reading.
  - An active log data set that gives persistent errors should be replaced.

### Operator Actions

- **None Required**

### Replacing the Data Set

The method for replacing the data set depends on whether you are using single or dual active logging.

#### Dual Active Logging

1. **Ensure Data is Saved:**
   - The data is saved on the other active log and can be copied to a replacement active log.
2. **Stop the Queue Manager:**
   - Delete the data set with the error using Access Method Services.
3. **Redefine a New Log Data Set:**
   - Use Access Method Services DEFINE to create a new log data set.
   - Use DFDSS or Access Method Services REPRO to copy the good log into the redefined data set.
4. **Update BSDS Information:**
   - Use the change log inventory utility (CSQJU003) to update the information in the BSDS:
     - **DELETE Function:** Remove information about the corrupted data set.
     - **NEWLOG Function:** Name the new data set as the new active log data set and give it the RBA range that was successfully copied.
5. **Restart the Queue Manager:**

#### Single Active Logging

1. **Ensure Data is Saved:**
2. **Stop the Queue Manager:**
3. **Determine if the Data Set Has Been Offloaded:**
   - Use the CSQJU003 utility to list information about the archive log data sets from the BSDS.
   - Search the list for a data set with an RBA range that includes the RBA of the corrupted data set.
4. **Copy Backup if Offloaded:**
   - If the corrupted data set has been offloaded, copy its backup in the archive log to a new data set.
   - Skip to step 6.
5. **Copy Data from Corrupted Data Set:**
   - If an active log data set is stopped, an RBA is not offloaded. Use DFDSS or Access Method Services REPRO to copy the data from the corrupted data set to a new data set.
   - **Note:** If further I/O errors prevent copying the entire data set, a gap occurs in the log. Queue manager restart will not be successful if a gap in the log is detected.
6. **Update BSDS Information:**
   - Use the change log inventory utility (CSQJU003) to update the information in the BSDS:
     - **DELETE Function:** Remove information about the corrupted data set.
     - **NEWLOG Function:** Name the new data set as the new active log data set and give it the RBA range that was successfully copied.
7. **Restart the Queue Manager:**

### Active Log Becoming Full

**Causes:**
- Delays in offloading
- Excessive logging

**Consequences:**
- When the active log becomes full, the queue manager halts processing until an offload process is completed.
- If the offload processing stops when the active log is full, the queue manager can end abnormally.

**Symptoms:**
- The queue manager issues the following warning message when the last available active log data set is 5% full:
  ```
  CSQJ110E +CSQ1 LAST COPYn ACTIVE LOG DATA SET IS nnn PERCENT FULL
  ```
- The message is reissued after each additional 5% of the data set space is filled, and the offload process is started each time.

**System Actions:**
- Messages are issued, and offload processing starts.
- If the active log becomes full, further actions are taken. See “Active log is full” on page 484.

**System Programmer Actions:**
- Use the DEFINE LOG command to dynamically add further active log data sets. This allows IBM MQ to continue normal operation while the error causing the offload problems is corrected.

### Active Log is Full

**Symptoms:**
- The queue manager halts processing until an offload process is completed.
- If the offload processing stops when the active log is full, the queue manager can end abnormally.
- IBM MQ issues the following message:
  ```
  CSQJ111A +CSQ1 OUT OF SPACE IN ACTIVE LOG DATA SETS
  ```
- An offload process is started, and the queue manager halts processing until the offload process is completed.

**System Actions:**
- IBM MQ waits for an available active log data set before resuming normal processing.
- Normal shutdown (with either QUIESCE or FORCE) is not possible because the shutdown sequence requires log space to record system events related to shutdown (e.g., checkpoint records).
- If the offload processing stops when the active log is full, the queue manager stops with an X'6C6' abend; restart in this case requires special attention. For more details, see “Troubleshooting IBM MQ for z/OS problems” on page 247.

**System Programmer Actions:**
- Provide additional active log data sets before restarting the queue manager. This allows IBM MQ to continue normal operation while the error causing the offload process problems is corrected.
- To add new active log data sets, use the change log inventory utility (CSQJU003) when the queue manager is not active.
- Consider increasing the number of logs by:
  1. Stopping the queue manager and using the Access Method Services DEFINE command to define a new active log data set.
  2. Defining the new active log data set in the BSDS using the change log inventory utility (CSQJU003).
  3. Adding additional log data sets dynamically using the DEFINE LOG command.

**Operator Actions:**
- Check whether the offload process is waiting for a tape drive. If it is, mount the tape. If you cannot mount the tape, force IBM MQ to stop using the z/OS CANCEL command.

### Archive Log Problems

This section covers the following archive log problems:
- Allocation problems
- Offload task terminated abnormally
- Insufficient DASD space to complete offload processing
- Read I/O errors on the archive data set while IBM MQ is restarting

#### Allocation Problems

**Symptoms:**
- IBM MQ issues the following message:
  ```
  CSQJ103E +CSQ1 LOG ALLOCATION ERROR DSNAME=dsname,
  ERROR STATUS=eeeeiiii, SMS REASON CODE=sss
  ```
- If the allocation was for offload processing, the following message is also displayed:
  ```
  CSQJ115E +CSQ1 OFFLOAD FAILED, COULD NOT ALLOCATE AN ARCHIVE
  DATA SET
  ```

**System Actions:**
- If the input is needed for recovery and recovery is not successful, the queue manager ends abnormally.
- If the active log had become full and an offload task was scheduled but not completed, the offload task tries again the next time it is triggered. The active log does not reuse a data set that has not yet been archived.

**System Programmer Actions:**
- None.

**Operator Actions:**
- Check the allocation error code for the cause of the problem and correct it.
- Ensure that drives are available, and either restart or wait for the offload task to be retried.
- Be careful if a DFP/DFSMS ACS user-exit filter has been written for an archive log data set, as this can cause a device allocation error when the queue manager tries to read the archive log data set.

#### Offload Task Terminated Abnormally

**Symptoms:**
- No specific IBM MQ message is issued for write I/O errors.
- Only a z/OS error recovery program message appears.
- If you get IBM MQ message CSQJ128E, the offload task has ended abnormally.

**System Actions:**
- The offload task abandons the output data set; no entry is made in the BSDS.
- The offload task dynamically allocates a new archive and restarts offloading from the point at which it was previously triggered.
- If an error occurs on the new data set:
  - In dual archive mode, message CSQJ114I is generated, and the offload processing changes to single mode:
    ```
    CSQJ114I +CSQ1 ERROR ON ARCHIVE DATA SET, OFFLOAD
    CONTINUING WITH ONLY ONE ARCHIVE DATA SET BEING
    GENERATED
    ```
  - In single archive mode, the output data set is abandoned. Another attempt to process this RBA range is made the next time offload processing is triggered.
  - The active log does not wrap around; if there are no more active logs, data is not lost.

**System Programmer Actions:**
- None.

**Operator Actions:**
- Ensure that the offload task is allocated on a reliable drive and control unit.

#### Insufficient DASD Space to Complete Offload Processing

**Symptoms:**
- While offloading the active log data sets to DASD, the process terminates unexpectedly.
- IBM MQ issues the following message:
  ```
  CSQJ128E +CSQ1 LOG OFF-LOAD TASK FAILED FOR ACTIVE LOG nnnnn
  ```
- The error is preceded by z/OS messages IEC030I, IEC031I, or IEC032I.

**System Actions:**
- IBM MQ de-allocates the data set on which the error occurred.
- If IBM MQ is running in dual archive mode, IBM MQ changes to single archive mode and continues the offload task.
- If the offload task cannot be completed in single archive mode, the active log data sets cannot be offloaded, and the state of the active log data sets remains NOT REUSABLE. Another attempt to process the RBA range of the abandoned active log data sets is made the next time the offload task is triggered.

**System Programmer Actions:**
- The most likely causes of these symptoms are:
  - The size of the archive log data set is too small to contain the data from the active log data sets during offload processing. All the secondary space allocations have been used. This condition is normally accompanied by z/OS message IEC030I. The return code in this message might provide further explanations for the cause of these symptoms.
    - **To solve the problem:**
      1. Issue the command `CANCEL queue_manager name` to cancel the queue manager job.
      2. Increase the primary or secondary allocations (or both) for the archive log data set (in the CSQ6ARVP system parameters), or reduce the size of the active log data set.
      3. If the data to be offloaded is large, you can mount another online storage volume or make one available to IBM MQ.
      4. Restart the queue manager.
  - All available space on the DASD volumes to which the archive data set is being written has been exhausted. This condition is normally accompanied by z/OS message IEC032I.
    - **To solve the problem:**
      - Make more space available on the DASD volumes, or make another online storage volume available for IBM MQ.
  - The primary space allocation for the archive log data set (as specified in the CSQ6ARVP system parameters) is too large to allocate to any available online DASD device. This condition is normally accompanied by z/OS message IEC032I.
    - **To solve the problem:**
      - Make more space available on the DASD volumes, or make another online storage volume available for IBM MQ. If this is not possible, adjust the value of PRIQTY in the CSQ6ARVP system parameters to reduce the primary allocation. (For details, see Using CSQ6ARVP.)
      - Note: If you reduce the primary allocation, you might have to increase the size of the secondary space allocation to avoid future abends.

**Operator Actions:**
- None.

#### Read I/O Errors on the Archive Data Set While IBM MQ is Restarting

**Symptoms:**
- No specific IBM MQ message is issued; only the z/OS error recovery program message appears.

**System Actions:**
- This depends on whether a second copy exists:
  - If a second copy exists, it is allocated and used.
  - If a second copy does not exist, restart is not successful.

**System Programmer Actions:**
- None.

**Operator Actions:**
- Try to restart using a different drive.

### BSDS Problems

This section covers the following BSDS problems:
- Error occurs while opening the BSDS
- Log content does not agree with the BSDS information
- Both copies of the BSDS are damaged
- Unequal time stamps
- Out of synchronization
- I/O error
- Log range problems

**Background:**
- Normally, there are two copies of the BSDS. If one is damaged, IBM MQ immediately changes to single BSDS mode. The damaged copy of the BSDS must be recovered before restart.
- If you are in single mode and damage the only copy of the BSDS, or if you are in dual mode and damage both copies, use the procedure described in Recovering the BSDS.

#### Error Occurs While Opening the BSDS

**Symptoms:**
- IBM MQ issues the following message:
  ```
  CSQJ100E +CSQ1 ERROR OPENING BSDSn DSNAME=..., ERROR STATUS=eeii
  ```
  where eeii is the VSAM return code. For information about VSAM codes, see the DFSMS/MVS Macro Instructions for Data Sets documentation.

**System Actions:**
- During system initialization, the startup is terminated.
- During a RECOVER BSDS command, the system continues in single BSDS mode.

**System Programmer Actions:**
- None.

**Operator Actions:**
- Carry out these steps:
  1. Run the print log map utility on both copies of the BSDS, and compare the lists to determine which copy is accurate or current.
  2. Rename the data set that had the problem, and define a replacement for it.
  3. Copy the accurate data set to the replacement data set using Access Method Services.
  4. Restart the queue manager.

#### Log Content Does Not Agree with the BSDS Information

**Symptoms:**
- IBM MQ issues the following message:
  ```
  CSQJ102E +CSQ1 LOG RBA CONTENT OF LOG DATA SET DSNAME=...,
  STARTRBA=..., ENDRBA=...,
  DOES NOT AGREE WITH BSDS INFORMATION
  ```
- This message indicates that the change log inventory utility was used incorrectly or that a down-level data set is being used.

**System Actions:**
- Queue manager startup processing is terminated.

**System Programmer Actions:**
- None.

**Operator Actions:**
- Run the print log map utility and the change log inventory utility to print and correct the contents of the BSDS.

#### Both Copies of the BSDS are Damaged

**Symptoms:**
- IBM MQ issues the following messages:
  ```
  CSQJ107E +CSQ1 READ ERROR ON BSDS
  DSNAME=... ERROR STATUS=0874
  CSQJ117E +CSQ1 REG8 INITIALIZATION ERROR READING BSDS
  DSNAME=... ERROR STATUS=0874
  CSQJ119E +CSQ1 BOOTSTRAP ACCESS INITIALIZATION PROCESSING FAILED
  ```

**System Actions:**
- Queue manager startup processing is terminated.

**System Programmer Actions:**
- Carry out these steps:
  1. Rename the data set and define a replacement for it.
