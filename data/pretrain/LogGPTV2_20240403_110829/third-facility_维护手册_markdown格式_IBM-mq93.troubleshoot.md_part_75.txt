System action
This depends on when the error occurred:
• If the error occurs during the offload process, the process tries to read the RBA range from a second
copy.
– If no second copy exists, the active log data set is stopped.
– If the second copy also has an error, only the original data set that triggered the offload process is
stopped. The archive log data set is then terminated, leaving a gap in the archived log RBA range.
– This message is issued:
CSQJ124E +CSQ1 OFFLOAD OF ACTIVE LOG SUSPENDED FROM
RBA xxxxxx TO RBA xxxxxx DUE TO I/O ERROR
– If the second copy is satisfactory, the first copy is not stopped.
• If the error occurs during recovery, IBM MQ provides data from specific log RBAs requested from
another copy or archive. If this is unsuccessful, recovery does not succeed, and the queue manager
terminates abnormally.
• If the error occurs during restart, if dual logging is used, IBM MQ continues with the alternative log
data set, otherwise the queue manager ends abnormally.
System programmer action
Look for system messages, such as IEC prefixed messages, and try to resolve the problem using the
recommended actions for these messages.
If the active log data set has been stopped, it is not used for logging. The data set is not deallocated; it
is still used for reading. Even if the data set is not stopped, an active log data set that gives persistent
errors should be replaced.
Operator action
None.
Replacing the data set
How you replace the data set depends on whether you are using single or dual active logging.
If you are using dual active logging:
1.Ensure that the data has been saved.
The data is saved on the other active log and this can be copied to a replacement active log.
2.Stop the queue manager and delete the data set with the error using Access Method Services.
482 Troubleshooting and Support for IBM MQ
3.Redefine a new log data set using Access Method Services DEFINE so that you can write to it. Use
DFDSS or Access Method Services REPRO to copy the good log in to the redefined data set so that
you have two consistent, correct logs again.
4.Use the change log inventory utility, CSQJU003, to update the information in the BSDS about the
corrupted data set as follows:
a.Use the DELETE function to remove information about the corrupted data set.
b.Use the NEWLOG function to name the new data set as the new active log data set and give it
the RBA range that was successfully copied.
You can run the DELETE and NEWLOG functions in the same job step. Put the DELETE statement
before NEWLOG statement in the SYSIN input data set.
5.Restart the queue manager.
If you are using single active logging:
1.Ensure that the data has been saved.
2.Stop the queue manager.
3.Determine whether the data set with the error has been offloaded:
a.Use the CSQJU003 utility to list information about the archive log data sets from the BSDS.
b.Search the list for a data set with an RBA range that includes the RBA of the corrupted data set.
4.If the corrupted data set has been offloaded, copy its backup in the archive log to a new data set.
Then, skip to step 6.
5.If an active log data set is stopped, an RBA is not offloaded. Use DFDSS or Access Method Services
REPRO to copy the data from the corrupted data set to a new data set.
If further I/O errors prevent you from copying the entire data set, a gap occurs in the log.
Note: Queue manager restart will not be successful if a gap in the log is detected.
6.Use the change log inventory utility, CSQJU003, to update the information in the BSDS about the
corrupted data set as follows:
a.Use the DELETE function to remove information about the corrupted data set.
b.Use the NEWLOG function to name the new data set as the new active log data set and to give it
the RBA range that was successfully copied.
The DELETE and NEWLOG functions can be run in the same job step. Put the DELETE statement
before NEWLOG statement in the SYSIN input data set.
7.Restart the queue manager.
Active log is becoming full
The active log can fill up for several reasons, for example, delays in offloading and excessive logging. If an
active log runs out of space, this has serious consequences. When the active log becomes full, the queue
manager halts processing until an offload process has been completed. If the offload processing stops
when the active log is full, the queue manager can end abnormally. Corrective action is required before
the queue manager can be restarted.
Symptoms
Because of the serious implications of an active log becoming full, the queue manager issues the
following warning message when the last available active log data set is 5% full:
CSQJ110E +CSQ1 LAST COPYn ACTIVE LOG DATA SET IS nnn PERCENT FULL
IBM MQ troubleshooting and support 483
and reissues the message after each additional 5% of the data set space is filled. Each time the
message is issued, the offload process is started.
System action
Messages are issued and offload processing started. If the active log becomes full, further actions are
taken. See “Active log is full” on page 484
System programmer action
Use the DEFINE LOG command to dynamically add further active log data sets. This permits IBM MQ
to continue its normal operation while the error causing the offload problems is corrected. For more
information about the DEFINE LOG command, see DEFINE LOG.
Active log is full
Symptoms
When the active log becomes full, the queue manager halts processing until an offload process has
been completed. If the offload processing stops when the active log is full, the queue manager can
end abnormally. Corrective action is required before the queue manager can be restarted.
IBM MQ issues the following CSQJ111A message:
CSQJ111A +CSQ1 OUT OF SPACE IN ACTIVE LOG DATA SETS
and an offload process is started. The queue manager then halts processing until the offload process
has been completed.
System action
IBM MQ waits for an available active log data set before resuming normal IBM MQ processing. Normal
shut down, with either QUIESCE or FORCE, is not possible because the shutdown sequence requires
log space to record system events related to shut down (for example, checkpoint records). If the
offload processing stops when the active log is full, the queue manager stops with an X'6C6' abend;
restart in this case requires special attention. For more details, see “Troubleshooting IBM MQ for z/OS
problems” on page 247.
System programmer action
You can provide additional active log data sets before restarting the queue manager. This permits IBM
MQ to continue its normal operation while the error causing the offload process problems is corrected.
To add new active log data sets, use the change log inventory utility (CSQJU003) when the queue
manager is not active. For more details about adding new active log data sets, see Changing the BSDS.
Consider increasing the number of logs by:
1.Making sure that the queue manager is stopped, then using the Access Method Services DEFINE
command to define a new active log data set.
2.Defining the new active log data set in the BSDS, using the change log inventory utility
(CSQJU003).
3.Adding additional log data sets dynamically, using the DEFINE LOG command.
When you restart the queue manager, offloading starts automatically during startup, and any work
that was in progress when IBM MQ was forced to stop is recovered.
Operator action
Check whether the offload process is waiting for a tape drive. If it is, mount the tape. If you cannot
mount the tape, force IBM MQ to stop by using the z/OS CANCEL command.
484 Troubleshooting and Support for IBM MQ
Archive log problems
Use this topic to investigate, and resolve problems with the archive logs.
This topic covers the following archive log problems:
• “Allocation problems” on page 485
• “Offload task terminated abnormally” on page 485
• “Insufficient DASD space to complete offload processing” on page 486
• “Read I/O errors on the archive data set while IBM MQ is restarting” on page 487
Allocation problems
Symptoms
IBM MQ issues message: CSQJ103E
CSQJ103E +CSQ1 LOG ALLOCATION ERROR DSNAME=dsname,
ERROR STATUS=eeeeiiii, SMS REASON CODE=sss
z/OS dynamic allocation provides the ERROR STATUS. If the allocation was for offload processing, the
following message is also displayed: CSQJ115E:
CSQJ115E +CSQ1 OFFLOAD FAILED, COULD NOT ALLOCATE AN ARCHIVE
DATA SET
System action
The following actions take place:
• If the input is needed for recovery, and recovery is not successful, and the queue manager ends
abnormally.
• If the active log had become full and an offload task was scheduled but not completed, the offload
task tries again the next time it is triggered. The active log does not reuse a data set that has not yet
been archived.
System programmer action
None.
Operator action
Check the allocation error code for the cause of the problem, and correct it. Ensure that drives are
available, and either restart or wait for the offload task to be retried. Be careful if a DFP/DFSMS ACS
user-exit filter has been written for an archive log data set, because this can cause a device allocation
error when the queue manager tries to read the archive log data set.
Offload task terminated abnormally
Symptoms
No specific IBM MQ message is issued for write I/O errors.
Only a z/OS error recovery program message appears. If you get IBM MQ message CSQJ128E, the
offload task has ended abnormally.
System action
The following actions take place:
• The offload task abandons the output data set; no entry is made in the BSDS.
IBM MQ troubleshooting and support 485
• The offload task dynamically allocates a new archive and restarts offloading from the point at which
it was previously triggered.
• If an error occurs on the new data set:
– In dual archive mode, message CSQJ114I is generated and the offload processing changes to
single mode:
CSQJ114I +CSQ1 ERROR ON ARCHIVE DATA SET, OFFLOAD
CONTINUING WITH ONLY ONE ARCHIVE DATA SET BEING
GENERATED
– In single archive mode, the output data set is abandoned. Another attempt to process this RBA
range is made the next time offload processing is triggered.
– The active log does not wrap around; if there are no more active logs, data is not lost.
System programmer action
None.
Operator action
Ensure that offload task is allocated on a reliable drive and control unit.
Insufficient DASD space to complete offload processing
Symptoms
While offloading the active log data sets to DASD, the process terminates unexpectedly. IBM MQ
issues message CSQJ128E:
CSQJ128E +CSQ1 LOG OFF-LOAD TASK FAILED FOR ACTIVE LOG nnnnn
The error is preceded by z/OS messages IEC030I, IEC031I, or IEC032I.
System action
IBM MQ de-allocates the data set on which the error occurred. If IBM MQ is running in dual archive
mode, IBM MQ changes to single archive mode and continues the offload task. If the offload task
cannot be completed in single archive mode, the active log data sets cannot be offloaded, and the
state of the active log data sets remains NOT REUSABLE. Another attempt to process the RBA range of
the abandoned active log data sets is made the next time the offload task is triggered.
System programmer action
The most likely causes of these symptoms are:
• The size of the archive log data set is too small to contain the data from the active log data sets
during offload processing. All the secondary space allocations have been used. This condition is
normally accompanied by z/OS message IEC030I. The return code in this message might provide
further explanations for the cause of these symptoms.
To solve the problem
1.Issue the command CANCEL queue_manager name to cancel the queue manager job
2.Increase the primary or secondary allocations (or both) for the archive log data set (in the
CSQ6ARVP system parameters), or reduce the size of the active log data set.
If the data to be offloaded is large, you can mount another online storage volume or make one
available to IBM MQ.
3.Restart the queue manager.
• All available space on the DASD volumes to which the archive data set is being written has been
exhausted. This condition is normally accompanied by z/OS message IEC032I.
486 Troubleshooting and Support for IBM MQ
To solve the problem, make more space available on the DASD volumes, or make another online
storage volume available for IBM MQ.
• The primary space allocation for the archive log data set (as specified in the CSQ6ARVP system
parameters) is too large to allocate to any available online DASD device. This condition is normally
accompanied by z/OS message IEC032I.
To solve the problem, make more space available on the DASD volumes, or make another online
storage volume available for IBM MQ. If this is not possible, you must adjust the value of PRIQTY
in the CSQ6ARVP system parameters to reduce the primary allocation. (For details, see Using
CSQ6ARVP.)
Note: If you reduce the primary allocation, you might have to increase the size of the secondary
space allocation to avoid future abends.
Operator action
None.
Read I/O errors on the archive data set while IBM MQ is restarting
Symptoms
No specific IBM MQ message is issued; only the z/OS error recovery program message appears.
System action
This depends on whether a second copy exists:
• If a second copy exists, it is allocated and used.
• If a second copy does not exist, restart is not successful.
System programmer action
None.
Operator action
Try to restart, using a different drive.
BSDS problems
Use this topic to investigate, and resolve problems with BSDS.
For background information about the bootstrap data set (BSDS), see the Planning your IBM MQ
environment on z/OS .
This topic describes the following BSDS problems:
• “Error occurs while opening the BSDS” on page 488
• “Log content does not agree with the BSDS information” on page 488
• “Both copies of the BSDS are damaged” on page 488
• “Unequal time stamps” on page 489
• “Out of synchronization” on page 490
• “I/O error” on page 491
• “Log range problems” on page 491
Normally, there are two copies of the BSDS, but if one is damaged, IBM MQ immediately changes to single
BSDS mode. However, the damaged copy of the BSDS must be recovered before restart. If you are in
single mode and damage the only copy of the BSDS, or if you are in dual mode and damage both copies,
use the procedure described in Recovering the BSDS.
This section covers some of the BSDS problems that can occur at startup. Problems not covered here
include:
• RECOVER BSDS command errors (messages CSQJ301E - CSQJ307I)
• Change log inventory utility errors (message CSQJ123E)
IBM MQ troubleshooting and support 487
• Errors in the BSDS backup being dumped by offload processing (message CSQJ125E)
Error occurs while opening the BSDS
Symptoms
IBM MQ issues the following message:
CSQJ100E +CSQ1 ERROR OPENING BSDSn DSNAME=..., ERROR STATUS=eeii
where eeii is the VSAM return code. For information about VSAM codes, see the DFSMS/MVS Macro
Instructions for Data Sets documentation.
System action
During system initialization, the startup is terminated.
During a RECOVER BSDS command, the system continues in single BSDS mode.
System programmer action
None.
Operator action
Carry out these steps:
1.Run the print log map utility on both copies of the BSDS, and compare the lists to determine which
copy is accurate or current.
2.Rename the data set that had the problem, and define a replacement for it.
3.Copy the accurate data set to the replacement data set, using Access Method Services.
4.Restart the queue manager.
Log content does not agree with the BSDS information
Symptoms
IBM MQ issues the following message:
CSQJ102E +CSQ1 LOG RBA CONTENT OF LOG DATA SET DSNAME=...,
STARTRBA=..., ENDRBA=...,
DOES NOT AGREE WITH BSDS INFORMATION
This message indicates that the change log inventory utility was used incorrectly or that a down-level
data set is being used.
System action
Queue manager startup processing is terminated.
System programmer action
None.
Operator action
Run the print log map utility and the change log inventory utility to print and correct the contents of
the BSDS.
Both copies of the BSDS are damaged
