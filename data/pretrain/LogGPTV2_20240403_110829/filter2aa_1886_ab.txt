Nslookup
Performing a reverse DNS lookup with nslookup can sometimes 
yield the domain name of the IP address in question.  Armed with 
that domain name, we can query for the domain‟s Start of 
Authority (SOA) contact information.

Nslookup Example
D:\>nslookup
> set type=ptr

whois (IP)
If a reverse DNS query on the IP address fails to turn up any results, 
the next place to look is in the ARIN whois registry.  This can be 
accessed via HTTP, a whois client, or raw, via port 43.
• If the domain portion of the whois email 
contact seems to be associated with the
organization owning the netblock, then 
take that as the responsible domain
• Do NOT use the contact mailbox for security 
issues unless it is a very small netblock 
(class C or less)

ARIN Whois Query Syntax
To find only a certain TYPE of record, use keyword:
HOst
ASn
PErson
ORganization
NEtwork
GRoup
To search only a specific FIELD, use keyword or character:
HAndle or "!"
Mailbox or contains "@"
NAme or leading "."
Here are some additional Whois keywords:
EXPand or "*“
Shows all parts of display without asking
Full or "=“
Shows detailed display for EACH match
Help 
Enters the help program for full documentation
PArtial or trailing ".“
Matches targets STARTING with the given string
Q, QUIT, or Return
Exits Whois
SUBdisplay or "%“
Shows users of host, hosts on net, etc.
SUMmary or "$“
Always shows summary, even if just one match

Recursive whois (IP)
Records that are not administered by ARIN are likely to be found 
at one of the other regional registries, RIPE and APNIC.  
Sometimes a query to ARIN will refer you to APNIC who, in turn, 
will direct you to JPNIC, KRNIC, or or one of the national 
registries.

whois (domain)
Cross-check the domain info returned from a IP based whois 
query with the domain whois records.  Geektools runs a nice 
proxy that can be used for both IP and domain name queries.

The State of .us
“Under current administrative practices, the usTLD not 
only has no central database that can in turn create a 
central Whois, there is also no mechanism in place for 
delegees to provision database information to the 
central registry. Even if delegees wished to provide new 
Whois information to the usTLD administrator, that 
capability is currently nonexistent.”

proposal for managing the .us TLD

Mailbox validation
You can use nslookup to get the mail server for a domain, and 
then manually you can VRFY addresses at the domain.  If 
verification is turned off, you may want to check

Rwhois
“RWhois (Referral Whois) extends and 
enhances the Whois concept in a hierarchical 
and scaleable fashion. In accordance with this, 
RWhois focuses primarily on the distribution of 
"network objects", or the data representing 
Internet resources or people, and uses the 
inherently hierarchical nature of these network 
objects (domain names, Internet Protocol (IP) 
networks, email addresses) to more accurately 
discover the requested information.”
