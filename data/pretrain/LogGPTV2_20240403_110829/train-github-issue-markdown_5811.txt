**Current behavior**  
In Hybrid mode (when bootstrapped using upgradeAdatper.bootstrap()), the
**``** attribute on the downgraded ng2 component is
not honored. it seems that select='' expression is ignored completely and all
the light DOM child elements are included.
**Expected/desired behavior**  
In Hybrid mode, the `` attribute should be honored and
should include only those DOM element matching the 'select' criteria.
**Reproduction of the problem**  
Here is the plunker https://plnkr.co/edit/L7Flah?p=preview
**What is the expected behavior?**
**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
It breaks the desired ng2 component behavior in hybrid mode.
