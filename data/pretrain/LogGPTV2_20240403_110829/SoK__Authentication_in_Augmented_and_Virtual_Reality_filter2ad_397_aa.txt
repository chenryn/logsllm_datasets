Abstract—Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR)
devices are emerging as prominent contenders to today’s personal
computers. As personal devices, users will use AR and VR to
store and access their sensitive data and thus will need secure
and usable ways to authenticate. In this paper, we evaluate the
state-of-the-art of authentication mechanisms for AR/VR devices
by systematizing research eﬀorts and practical deployments.
By studying users’ experiences with authentication on AR and
VR, we gain insight into the important properties needed for
authentication on these devices. We then use these properties to
perform a comprehensive evaluation of AR/VR authentication
mechanisms both proposed in literature and used in practice.
In all, we synthesize a coherent picture of the current state of
authentication mechanisms for AR/VR devices. We draw on our
ﬁndings to provide concrete research directions and advice on
implementing and evaluating future authentication methods.
I. Introduction
Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) head-
mounted devices (HMDs) have recently become commercially
viable for end-users [4], [5]. For example, VR devices have
grown in popularity with the online gaming community, but
their use extends to education [40], healthcare [66],
the
military [64], and beyond. AR devices, too, are becoming
more prevalent; some, like Microsoft’s HoloLens, are geared
towards a business environment, again with applications in
healthcare, manufacturing, and education [4].
With the growing popularity of these devices, an increas-
ingly common and critical task is secure and usable user
authentication. It would be simplest for AR and VR to follow
the paradigm of passwords as the de facto authentication
mechanism. However, password entry does not easily translate
to the novel interfaces of AR and VR. Instead of typical
interaction methods like a keyboard and mouse or a smart-
phone touch screen, AR/VR users perform gestures (free-
hand or with controllers) to interact with the device. Although
such gestures can be used to enter text passwords, doing so
is incredibly cumbersome; as a result, users choose weaker
passwords, and the slow speed of entry leaves users vulnerable
to external observer attacks (i.e., shoulder surﬁng).
Researchers have been actively working to improve text
entry in AR/VR [26], [34], [38], [73]. However, existing works
on improving text entry rely on language models to predict and
correct errors [27]. Improving text entry in this way would
not make password entry any more usable; secure passwords
should be random and hard to guess, making it diﬃcult to
apply these error correction mechanisms. Further, more usable
text entry will not solve the numerous security problems which
have plagued passwords since their inception.
Prior work has considered authentication methods for wear-
the
ables like smart watches (e.g., [53], [72]). However,
authentication methods that work for wearables in general
will not suﬃce for AR and VR. Unlike other wearables,
AR and VR are trending towards being standalone, general-
purpose computing devices, and thus typical authentication for
wearables will not always work for AR/VR. Speciﬁcally, other
wearables often require a paired device for authentication; e.g.,
Apple Watch users ﬁrst log in by going to an app on their
iPhone [11]. When AR/VR devices are standalone, users will
not reliably have access to such a secondary device.
We believe AR/VR devices present an opportunity to look
beyond password-based authentication and its long history of
security problems. To enable richer user experiences, AR/VR
devices come with a wide variety of sensors, such as front
cameras for environment tracking, inward cameras for eye-
tracking, inertial motion sensors, controllers, and touchpads.
These sensors could also be used to provide smoother au-
thentication experiences and enhanced security. For example,
prior work has proposed shoulder-surﬁng-resistant PIN entry
methods [50], [56], [57], [75], behavioral biometrics using
eye, head, and controller movement [62], [67], and novel
skull and ear biometrics [31], [70], among others. The myriad
sensors provide opportunities for layered authentication as
well; Mathis et. al’s RubikBiom, for example, implements
a Rubik’s Cube-inspired PIN entry mechanism,
then uses
behavioral biometrics of the controller following successful
PIN entry [55]. The possibilities are exciting.
The area of AR/VR authentication is still emerging. We
argue that now is the right time to systematize existing work
to inform the development and adoption of novel AR/VR
authentication mechanisms, lest device designs become set in
stone with possibly sub-optimal techniques (as is the case with
web and mobile authentication).
We, therefore, perform the ﬁrst systematization of knowl-
edge of the authentication landscape on AR/VR devices.
Rather than a conventional synthesis of knowledge, we adopt a
more practical perspective which helps reveal the gap between
research and real-world deployment of authentication. We sur-
vey users and developers of AR/VR devices to understand how
they feel about the existing authentication mechanisms they
(have to) use on these devices (Section III); we use insights
from the user survey to derive a set of evaluation criteria for
AR and VR authentication methods (Section IV); we analyze
AR and VR applications on two popular devices to identify
and evaluate the authentication methods being used in practice
(Section V); and ﬁnally, we evaluate the novel authentication
mechanisms being proposed in research and compare them to
those used in practice (Section VI). Below, we highlight a few
contributions that emerge from our comprehensive eﬀorts.

Passwords have reached a breaking point on AR/VR. To
date, passwords are the most prevalent form of authentication
in popular AR and VR apps. However, our user study shows
that entering passwords on AR and VR is overwhelmingly
unusable. Users complain that using the virtual keyboard
to enter a password is “cumbersome,” “diﬃcult,” and “a
pain,” and they emphasize that the lack of usability makes
it inaccessible to users with physical disabilities. Some users
are even forced to devise their own workarounds to make
password entry easier for them. This ﬁnding highlights an
urgent need to re-imagine authentication for AR/VR—a need
that the varied sensors on AR and VR can hopefully solve.
Potential to unify the authentication stack via federated
login. Multiple AR and VR devices require users to log
into a paired account (e.g. Microsoft or Facebook) to unlock
and use the device. In theory, this account could be used to
bootstrap authentication for web services, providing the user
with eﬀortless app authentication. We analyze apps on a PC-
tethered VR device (HTC Vive) and ﬁnd that a few apps take
advantage of this opportunity; however, on a standalone AR
device (HoloLens 2), none take full advantage of it. With such
compelling usability beneﬁts, it is worth exploring why this
authentication technique is not widely used.
The AR/VR OS will play a major role in driving the
adoption of new authentication techniques. Although there
is a growing body of work in AR/VR authentication, much of it
is yet to see adoption. Our work, which includes a survey study
of AR/VR developers, highlights a need to integrate these new
authentication techniques with the OS so that developers can
easily use them in applications. Developers and users point out
that passwords are unusable and are looking for replacements,
but they are limited by a lack of OS support.
Beyond supporting the implementation of new authentica-
tion methods, the OS will play a critical role in enabling
the safe use of novel biometrics. Consider an inertial sensor
that measures an individual’s unique head movements [67],
[62]. A malicious app can get access to the same sensor for
legitimate reasons (e.g., a game), record head movements,
then leak them to an attacker. This issue of multi-use sensors
needs OS arbitration and protection mechanisms to be useful
in authentication. This might include trusted computing hard-
ware, which could increase the power demands on an already
energy-constrained device. Our work highlights this and other
challenges to designing authentication for AR and VR devices.
II. Background & Related Work
A. Augmented and Virtual Reality Devices
AR and VR technology is maturing quickly. Current AR/VR
devices support a wide range of input and output modalities,
presenting unique opportunities for more secure and usable
authentication mechanisms.
Augmented reality. AR glasses are expected to become the
next generation of personal devices [45], [46], [60]. They strive
to be mobile, lightweight, and comfortable to wear, thus sup-
porting long-term use everywhere throughout the day. Some
AR glasses are powerful standalone devices (e.g., HoloLens,
Magic Leap 1); others can only be used by connecting to
smartphones (e.g., Google Glass, Vuzix Blade AR).
To recognize user behavior and support daily activities,
AR glasses usually embed multiple input sensors. The most
common sensors on AR glasses are RGB cameras and mi-
crophones. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) have also been
incorporated into many AR glasses (e.g., Epson Moverio,
HoloLens) to track the user’s head or body movements. Some
AR glasses also have controllers (e.g., Magic Leap 1) or touch-
pads (e.g., Google Glass, Epson Moverio) to enable control of
the glasses. More advanced AR glasses like the HoloLens 2
have outward depth cameras and inward cameras for eye
tracking (and sometimes iris scanning, e.g., on Hololens 2).
In terms of output, most AR glasses support both audio and
visual feedback. Some provide 3D graphics via stereo displays,
while some provide 2D visual feedback via a single display
(e.g., Google Glass, Vuzix Blade). Magic Leap 1 also supports
haptic feedback via its controller.
Virtual reality. VR devices are bulkier and more powerful
than AR devices and are designed for at-home use. VR has
been especially popular during the COVID-19 pandemic [22]
since it provides immersive experiences for remote socializing
and collaboration. While many VR headsets (e.g., Oculus Rift,
Vive Pro) need to be connected to a PC, standalone VR
headsets (e.g., Oculus Quest, Vive Cosmos) are also being
released to support more ﬂexible and comfortable experiences.
Audio and movement are the two most common inputs for
VR devices. Most VR headsets come with a pair of controllers
with buttons. Some controllers (e.g., Oculus, Vive Cosmos)
also have touch sensors to detect the users’ holding gestures.
The position and motion of the headset and controllers can be
tracked either via external trackers in the environment (e.g.,
Vive Tracker [8]) or inside-out tracking techniques like IMU
sensors. Some VR headsets have front cameras to enable users
to see the real-world environment; these cameras are yet to be
used to support VR interactions. The more advanced HTC
Vive Pro Eye also incorporates eye tracking components. To
generate immersive experiences, VR devices usually support
realistic 3D graphics as visual output as well as spatial audio.
VR controllers can also provide haptic feedback.
While most VR devices and applications focus on immer-
sive gaming or social experiences, researchers have started
envisioning the future of VR for productivity. For example,
the VR oﬃce concept [35] suggests combining the VR headset
with the conventional keyboard and mouse, so that a user can
sit in front of their desk, wear their headset to join a virtual
workspace, and use their keyboard and mouse to interact with
the virtual environment more eﬃciently.
