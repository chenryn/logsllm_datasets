In the following Go program:

```go
package main
import "fmt"

func main() {
    const A = 0xfffffffffffffffff // error
    // const A = 0x8000000000000000 // error
    // const A = 0x7fffffffffffffff // ok
    a := string(A)
    for i, r := range a {
        fmt.Printf("%d: %x\n", i, r)
    }
}
```

The compiler issues an error message: `overflow in int -> string`.

According to the Go specification (https://golang.org/ref/spec#Conversions):

> A constant value `x` can be converted to type `T` in any of these cases:
>
> - `x` is an integer constant and `T` is a string type. The same rule as for non-constant `x` applies in this case.
>
> ...
>
> A non-constant value `x` can be converted to type `T` in any of these cases:
>
> - `x` is an integer or a slice of bytes or runes and `T` is a string type.
>
> ...
>
> Conversions to and from a string type:

> 1. Converting a signed or unsigned integer value to a string type yields a string containing the UTF-8 representation of the integer. Values outside the range of valid Unicode code points are converted to `\uFFFD`.

Based on the above, the conversion should succeed, with the resulting string containing the UTF-8 encoding of `0xfffd`. However, the Go compiler (gc) issues an overflow error, while `gccgo` does not and behaves as specified.

### Explanation

- **Constant Value**: The constant `A` is defined as `0xfffffffffffffffff`, which is a 65-bit integer. This value exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by a 64-bit integer (`0xffffffffffffffff`), leading to an overflow error when converting it to a string.
  
- **Conversion to String**: According to the Go specification, converting an integer to a string should yield the UTF-8 representation of the integer. If the integer value is outside the range of valid Unicode code points (0 to 0x10FFFF), it should be converted to `\uFFFD`.

- **Compiler Behavior**:
  - **Go Compiler (gc)**: The `gc` compiler correctly identifies the overflow and issues an error.
  - **GCC Go (gccgo)**: The `gccgo` compiler does not issue an error and converts the value to `\uFFFD` as per the specification.

### Corrected Code

To avoid the overflow error, you can use a valid 64-bit integer value or handle the conversion explicitly:

```go
package main
import "fmt"
import "strconv"

func main() {
    const A = 0x7fffffffffffffff // Valid 64-bit integer
    a := string(A)
    for i, r := range a {
        fmt.Printf("%d: %x\n", i, r)
    }

    // Alternatively, handle invalid values explicitly
    if A > 0x10FFFF {
        a := "\uFFFD"
        for i, r := range a {
            fmt.Printf("%d: %x\n", i, r)
        }
    } else {
        a := string(A)
        for i, r := range a {
            fmt.Printf("%d: %x\n", i, r)
        }
    }
}
```

This corrected code ensures that the integer value is within the valid range and handles the conversion to `\uFFFD` for out-of-range values.
