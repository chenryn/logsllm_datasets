Abstract—Physical layer security schemes for wireless commu-
nication systems have been broadly studied from an information
theory point of view. In contrast, there is a dearth of attack
methodologies to analyze the achievable security on the physical
layer. To address this issue, we develop a novel attack model
for physical
layer security schemes, which is the equivalent
to known-plaintext attacks in cryptoanalysis. In particular, we
concentrate on analyzing the security of orthogonal blinding
schemes that disturb an eavesdropper’s signal reception using
artiﬁcial noise transmission. We discuss the theory underlying
our attack methodology and develop an adaptive ﬁlter trained
by known-plaintext symbols to degrade the secrecy of orthogonal
blinding. By means of simulation and measurements on real
wireless channels using software-deﬁned radios with OFDM
transceivers, we obtain the operating area of our attack and
evaluate the achievable secrecy degradation. We are able to
reduce the secrecy of orthogonal blinding schemes to Symbol
Error Rates (SERs) below 10 % at an eavesdropper, with a
knowledge of only a 3 % of the symbols transmitted in typical
WLAN frames.

INTRODUCTION
Security solutions for wireless systems based on cryptog-
raphy are inevitably bound to an expiration date, since today’s
state-of-the-art cryptographic protocols may be broken in the
future. Well known examples include the DECT Standard
Cipher (DSC)—broken using cryptanalysis [16],
the A5/1
encryption standard used in GSM—vulnerable to a ciphertext-
only attack made possible due to error-correction codes being
used before the encryption [4], the Wired Equivalent Privacy
(WEP) as used in the early 802.11 standard—broken due
to inappropriate use of the RC4 stream cipher [8], and the
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)—vulnerable to side
channel attacks in some implementations [18]. While the attack
model underlying each of these vulnerabilities is different,
they all share a common threat, i.e., a message eavesdropped
and stored today may be decrypted as soon as the security
scheme in use is broken. Moreover, such broken schemes
cannot always be avoided, as support for legacy systems might
be needed [13].

A highly promising approach to overcome this limitation
is to implement physical layer security, which prevents eaves-
dropping in the ﬁrst place. Intuitively, senders manipulate
data either before transmission or “on-air” such that only the
intended receiver can decode it successfully, while eavesdrop-
pers only receive a degraded signal [25]. To achieve this, a
number of techniques exist, including friendly jamming [11].
In this case, well-behaved nodes selectively jam signals to
prevent their reception by malicious nodes. Conversely, they
also may jam signals sent by the malicious nodes themselves
to prevent message injection [24]. However, such approaches
exhibit weaknesses, since a conveniently placed attacker with
multiple antennas may cancel out the jamming signal and
recover the transmitted data [23]. While physical layer security
is powerful, this attack showcases that such techniques neces-
sitate a thorough analysis to fully understand their limitations
in practical settings.
To provide conﬁdentiality, more sophisticated techniques
than jamming based on orthogonal blinding exist. A transmitter
can protect data by sending artiﬁcial noise into a channel
orthogonal to the receiver’s channel. In other words, all nearby
nodes receive a superposition of noise and signal, while the
intended receiver gets only the signal. The achievable secrecy
rate [25] using such a scheme has been thoroughly investigated
in theory [10], [15], [26]. Additionally,
there exists also
practical work showing the feasibility of orthogonal blinding in
a software-deﬁned radio testbed [3]. This technique requires a
MIMO conﬁguration, since the transmitter needs at least two
antennas in order to send noise into an orthogonal channel.
However, the intended receiver only needs one antenna. In
particular, the transmitter uses the Channel State Information
(CSI) to the intended receiver to preﬁlter data and artiﬁcial
noise. As a result, there is only data in the dimension visible
to the intended receiver, while potential eavesdroppers always
receive a mixture of noise and signal. Even if eavesdroppers
have more than one antenna, artiﬁcial noise is not fully
orthogonal to any of them with high probability. Additional
antennas at
the transmitter can be used to send noise on
multiple orthogonal channels. This reduces even further the
probability that an eavesdropper has a link to the transmitter
which suppresses the artiﬁcial noise.
In this paper, we investigate the limitations of orthogonal
blinding. Existing work is partly based on assumptions which
might not hold in a realistic setting. Speciﬁcally, (a) data is
typically assumed to be fully unknown to the eavesdropper
and (b) the attacker is assumed to have less antennas than the
transmitter [3]. Regarding (a), the use of well-known protocols
and addresses may allow the attacker to guess parts of the
transmitted data. This information can be used to mount an
attack analog to a known-plaintext attack in the cryptography
domain, where the attacker has samples of both the plaintext
and the ciphertext. Concretely, the attacker can compare the
known plaintext with the ciphertext and derive the key, which
can then be used to decrypt the rest of the data. Similarly, an
eavesdropper who can guess parts of the data transmitted by
a sender using orthogonal blinding can use this information to
suppress the artiﬁcial noise reception by training an adaptive
ﬁlter based on the known plaintext. In other words,
the
eavesdropper iteratively ﬁlters the data, starting with a given
default ﬁlter, and compares the output to the known plaintext.
Based on the observed difference, the ﬁlter is adapted in each
iteration until converging, i.e., until the difference between the
ﬁlter output and the expected plaintext is minimized. Since the
attacker needs at least as many antennas as the transmitter to
be able to discern all signal dimensions used by the transmitter,
assumption (b) would prevent this weakness, but this relegates
the security of the scheme to the capabilities of the attacker,
who might be very powerful.
More precisely, the analogy of our attack model to the
case of a known-plaintext attack is as follows. The data sent
by the transmitter corresponds to the plaintext, the mixture of
transmitted data and artiﬁcial noise is the ciphertext, and the
CSI of the link from the transmitter to the intended receiver
is the key.
Note that our attack model is not limited to the case of
orthogonal blinding. Known-plaintext attacks based on adap-
tive ﬁltering could also be used to compromise other physical
layer security schemes which preﬁlter data at the transmitter.
In summary, our contributions are as follows:
• We propose an attack model which applies the con-
cept of known-plaintext attacks from the cryptography
domain to physical layer security.
• We design a practical attack scheme which instantiates
our model for the case of physical layer security based
on orthogonal blinding.
• We discuss the theory underlying our attack and
obtain the operating area of our scheme by means of
extensive simulation.
• We implement and evaluate our scheme on software-
deﬁned radios to show its practicability.
The remainder of this work is structured as follows. In
Sections II and III we introduce our system and communication
model. After that, we ﬁrst brieﬂy explain how orthogonal
blinding works in Section IV and then delve into the details
of our known-plaintext attack in Section V. In Section VI we
present our simulation outcome and our practical evaluation
on the Wireless Open-Access Research Platform (WARP) [2]
software-deﬁned radio. We discuss our results in Section VII.
Finally, we give an overview of related work in Section VIII
and conclude our work in Section IX.
II. SYSTEM AND ATTACK MODEL
Our system model is illustrated in Figure 1. It contains a
transmitter Alice, who conﬁdentially sends data to the intended
receiver Bob over a wireless channel HA!B. We additionally
consider a passive eavesdropper Eve, who intends to extract
the conﬁdential data DA!B. To prevent
the latter, Alice
applies a physical layer secrecy scheme. In our example, this
is orthogonal blinding [3]. In this scheme, Alice transmits
artiﬁcial noise in addition to the data signal so that Bob is
not disturbed by the noise, but any eavesdropper—having a
different channel from that of HA!B—receives both data
signal and noise. As long as Eve does not know the transmit
ﬁlter FA,TX used to mix data and noise, she is unable to extract
the data from her received signal E. According to [25], this
ensures the secrecy of the system. As Alice’s transmit ﬁlter
FA,TX is based on the knowledge of the channel from Alice
to Bob (HA!B), which is not available to Eve, Eve cannot
generate an optimal receive ﬁlter FE,RX.
To still degrade the secrecy of the orthogonal blinding
scheme, we assume that Eve knows parts of the transmitted
data:
the known plaintext. In the cryptography domain, a
sound cryptographic algorithm should withstand a known-
plaintext attack, amongst other basic attacks, to be considered
secure. We apply this consideration also to physical layer
security schemes and develop a novel attack model, which
is the equivalent to known-plaintext attacks in cryptoanalysis.
As a practical example we choose orthogonal blinding to
demonstrate the efﬁcacy of our attack methodology.
In our attack model, Eve trains an adaptive ﬁlter FE,RX with
known plaintext symbols. The trained ﬁlter can then be used to
extract the unknown data. For ﬁlter training, the error between
the ﬁlter output and the known plaintext is minimized. Once
trained, the ﬁlter is independent of the transmitted artiﬁcial
noise.
The following section focuses on our attack model steps,
and how they apply to orthogonal blinding.
A. Communication Phases
Our attack model comprises three phases that we describe
hereunder together with examples regarding orthogonal blind-
ing:
1) Channel estimation between Alice and Bob:
•
•
Alice transmits pilot symbols, which Bob uses to
estimate the channel HA!B from Alice to him (Sec-
tion III-A).
Bob uses an out-of-band channel to send HA!B to
Alice. Here, we give orthogonal blinding an advan-
tage; alternatively our system could rely on implicit
feedback, as used in IEEE 802.11n [19].
2) Securing transmission:
•
•
•
Alice uses HA!B to generate her transmit ﬁlter FA,TX
(Section IV-B).
Alice applies FA,TX to mix data and artiﬁcial noise,
and transmits the result.
Bob extracts the data after compensating channel
effects in his receive ﬁlter FB,RX (Section IV-B).

III. COMMUNICATION SYSTEM
•
•
Eve uses her plaintext knowledge and her received
signal to train an adaptive receive ﬁlter FE,RX (Sec-
tion V).
Eve applies the trained ﬁlter to extract the unknown
data (Section V).
After performing these steps, we calculate the SERs at Bob
and Eve to evaluate our attack’s secrecy degradation. Only if
Eve’s SER does not decrease when carrying out the attack,
the secrecy scheme can be considered resistant against known-
plaintext attacks.
Before continuing with a mathematical description of the
communication system in Section III, we present our adversary
model in the following section.
B. Adversary model
Both receivers Bob and Eve, are limited by their receive
incoming signals that are
hardware’s sensitivity to detect
further disturbed by Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN).
Eve might signiﬁcantly improve her reception compared to
that of Bob—in the sense of Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR)—if
she shifted her position in a given environment or if she used
directional antennas. Thus, we assume that Eve’s antennas can
be freely positioned. In case this reduced the feasibility of
representing Eve as a single node, we suppose that multiple
eavesdroppers cooperate and exchange their received signals
so that all received signals are available at one point (see
[10], [21]). Multiple antennas help to additionally increase the
SNR on Eve’s channel HA!E, as the AWGN is independent
of the transmitted signal and can be reduced by destructive
interference.
To optionally increase Eve’s attack performance with a
limited number of antennas (see Section VI-E), we assume
that Eve can estimate the channel HA!E from Alice to Eve
using the publicly available pilot symbols that Alice transmits
to estimate her channel to Bob. Blinding the pilot symbols
does not prevent
the attack, as pilot symbols themselves
can be regarded as known plaintext used for ﬁlter training.
Furthermore, we require that Eve has partial knowledge of
the transmitted data—that could be (but is not limited to)
protocol headers and addresses. The amount of data needed to
compromise secure information’s conﬁdentiality is evaluated
in Section VI. The channel information HA!B from Alice
to Bob is, however, not disclosed to Eve, and Eve’s channel
HA!E is revealed neither to Alice nor to Bob.
We now present our communication system, which draws
primarily on a state-of-the-art Multiple Input Multiple Output
(MIMO) transceiver using Orthogonal Frequency Division
Multiplexing (OFDM) [6], which is employed to abstract from
fading channels and to cope with Inter Symbol Interference
(ISI). Similar technology is used in the current 802.11ac Wi-
Fi standard [19]. This allows to port both the physical layer
security scheme as well as our known-plaintext attack against
it onto widely available hardware. For the sake of simplicity,
we use Software-Deﬁned Radios (SDRs) to implement and
assess our system in Section VI.
In what follows, we present the general MIMO channel
model (Section III-A) and show how to apply it to our scenario
(Section III-C). We conclude with transmit and receive ﬁltering
(Section III-D).
A. Channel model
The wireless channel between each pair of antennas is
described as a complex number Hr,t (the channel coefﬁcient)
representing a phase and an amplitude change of the trans-
mitted signal during a transmission. Each of the R receive
antennas gets a superposition of all T transmitted signals
traversing different channels:
RXr =
TX⌧ =1
Hr,⌧ · TX⌧
H1,1 H1,2 . . . H1,T
H2,1 H2,2 . . . H2,T

This channel abstraction is only valid if the channel co-
efﬁcients are equal over the whole transmission bandwidth.
Indoor channels with reﬂections, however, experience fre-
quency selective fading, where the channel coefﬁcients are
frequency-dependent. To split wide-band channels into narrow
subchannels, where the channel coefﬁcients are considered
constant, we apply OFDM, which also avoids ISI.
Instead of transmitting symbols consecutively in the time
domain over a band of frequencies, symbols are transmitted in
parallel over K frequency subbands—called subchannels.
