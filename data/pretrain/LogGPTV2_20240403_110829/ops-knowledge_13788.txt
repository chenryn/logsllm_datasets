User: How to manage code version? What are the common code version management tools?
Assistant: Code versioning is a tool or method for managing the process of code changes. Common code version management tools are: 1. Git: Currently the most popular and widely used distributed version control system, which can manage any type of text and binary files. Git supports features such as branching, merging, tagging, and incremental development. 2. SVN: A veteran player of the version control system, it is a central version control system. Although it does not have the fast and flexible branching function of Git, it is relatively simple to use and has strong permission control functions. 3. Mercurial: A distributed version control system similar to Git, with efficient branch merging and revocation functions, and capable of managing large code bases. 4. Perforce: A professional version control software, suitable for large enterprise projects, with efficient binary file management and stable performance. The above are common code version management tools. Which tool to choose needs to be considered comprehensively based on factors such as actual business needs, team size, and development process.
