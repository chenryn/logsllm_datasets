User: I'd like to have a reliable way to install Python interpreters 2.4 through to Python 3.3 on a linux user account.  I am fine to presume that there is a C-compiler but i'd like to avoid relying on particular distributions or distribution versions.  Is there already something maybe like a simple python script?
update: i am looking for a script/way to do all downloading and installation automatically and report back any problems in a concise summary.
Assistant: You can compile Python for yourself easily enough.  Download and extract the Python source tarballs, then use this sequence of commands instead of the usual:

$ ./configure --prefix=$HOME/local
$ make
$ make install

You will probably want to add $HOME/local/bin to your PATH.  The different minor/major versions of Python will not interfere with each other, so you can install 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 all at the  same time.  (There's no point in testing your code against 3.0.)
The program python will be an alias for one of the specific Python versions, such as python2.6.
