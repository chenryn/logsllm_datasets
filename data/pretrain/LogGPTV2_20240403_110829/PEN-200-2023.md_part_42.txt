### Metadata as a Source of Information

Metadata can be a valuable source of information. For instance, the "Author" section often reveals the name of an internal employee. By leveraging our knowledge of this individual, we can establish a more trustworthy relationship by casually mentioning their name in a targeted email or phone conversation. This is particularly effective if the author has a relatively small public profile.

Additionally, metadata can reveal the software used to create a document. In this case, the PDF was created using Microsoft PowerPoint for Microsoft 365. This information is crucial for planning a client-side attack, as it indicates that the target uses Microsoft Office. Since there is no mention of "macOS" or "for Mac" in the metadata tags, it is highly likely that the document was created on a Windows system. With this knowledge, we can leverage various client-side attack vectors, including those targeting Windows system components and malicious Office documents.

### Client Fingerprinting

#### Overview
Client Fingerprinting, also known as Device Fingerprinting, is a technique used to obtain operating system and browser information from a target within a non-routable internal network. This is particularly useful for establishing an initial foothold during a penetration test. For example, after extracting a target's email address using tools like theHarvester, we can use an HTML Application (HTA) attached to an email to execute code in the context of Internet Explorer or, to some extent, Microsoft Edge. This is a popular attack vector used by many threat actors and ransomware groups.

#### Confirming Target Environment
Before launching such an attack, it is essential to confirm that the target is running Windows and has either Internet Explorer or Microsoft Edge enabled. To do this, we can use Canarytokens, a free web service that generates a link with an embedded token. When the target opens the link in their browser, we receive information about their browser, IP address, and operating system. This allows us to verify the target's environment and determine if an HTA client-side attack is feasible.

#### Creating a Pretext
To increase the likelihood of the target clicking the link, we need to create a convincing pretext. A pretext frames the situation in a specific way, making it more likely for the target to engage. For example, if the target works in a finance department, we could claim to have received an invoice with a financial error and offer a link to a screenshot highlighting the error. The link, of course, would be the Canarytoken link. When the target clicks the link, they will see a blank page, but we will receive the necessary information to proceed with our client-side attack.

#### Generating a Canarytoken
1. **Visit the Canarytokens website** and select the type of tracking token you want to create.
2. **Enter your email address** to receive alerts or provide a webhook URL.
3. **Select the Web bug / URL token** option, enter a webhook URL (e.g., https://example.com), and add a comment (e.g., "Fingerprinting").
4. **Click "Create my Canarytoken"** to generate the tracking link.

Once the token is active, you can manage its settings and view the history of all visitors who clicked the link. The detailed information provided includes the victim's geographical location, user agent, and other browser details, which are more precise and reliable than the user agent alone.

#### Other Fingerprinting Techniques
Canarytokens also offers other fingerprinting methods, such as embedding tokens in Word documents, PDF files, or images. Additionally, online IP loggers like Grabify and JavaScript fingerprinting libraries like fingerprint.js can be used for similar purposes.

### Exploiting Microsoft Office

#### Learning Objectives
- Understand variations of Microsoft Office client-side attacks.
- Install Microsoft Office.
- Leverage Microsoft Word Macros.

#### Introduction
Ransomware attacks have significantly increased in recent years, with many initial breaches involving malicious Microsoft Office macros. This is a common attack vector due to the widespread use of Office and the frequent exchange of Office documents via email.

#### Preparing the Attack
Before diving into the technical aspects, consider the following:

1. **Delivery Method**: Email providers and spam filters often block Microsoft Office documents by default. Therefore, using a pretext and providing the document through a download link may be more effective.
2. **Mark of the Web (MOTW)**: Documents delivered via email or download links are tagged with MOTW, which opens them in Protected View, disabling macros and embedded objects. Convincing the target to enable editing is crucial.
3. **Microsoftâ€™s Macro Blocking Policy**: Microsoft has implemented changes to block macros by default in Office 2021 and earlier versions. Users must unblock the file via the checkbox before executing macros.

#### Installing Microsoft Office
1. **Connect to the OFFICE VM** using RDP with the username `offsec` and password `lab`.
2. **Navigate to C:\tools\Office2019.img** and double-click the file to load it as a virtual CD.
3. **Run Setup.exe** to start the installation process.
4. **Complete the installation** and open Microsoft Word from the start menu.
5. **Accept the license agreement** and privacy settings to start the 7-day trial.

By following these steps, we can effectively set up the environment for further exploitation using Microsoft Office.
