Abstract 
introduces  an  analytical  method 
This  paper 
for 
approximating  the  fraction  of  jobs  that  miss  their 
deadlines  in  a  real-time  system  when  earliest-deadline-
first scheduling policy (EDF) is used. In the system, jobs 
either all have deadlines until the beginning of service or 
deadlines  until  the  end  of  service.  In  the  former  case, 
EDF is known to be optimal and, in the latter case, it will 
be  optimal  if  preemption  is  allowed.    In  both  cases,  the 
system  is  modeled  by  an  M/M/1/EDF+M  queue,  i.e.,  a 
single  server  queue  with  Poisson  arrival,  and  service 
times  and  customer  impatience,  which  are  exponentially 
distributed.  The  optimality  property  of  EDF  is  used  for 
the  estimation  of  a  key  parameter,  γn,  which  is  the  loss 
rate  when  there  are  n  customers  in  the  system.  The 
estimation  is  possible  by  finding  an  upper  bound  and  a 
lower  bound  for  γn  and  linearly  combining  these  two 
bounds.  The  resulting  Markov  chains  are  then  easy  to 
solve  numerically.  Comparing  numerical  and  simulation 
results,  we  find  that  the  existing  errors  are  relatively 
small. 
1. Introduction 
jobs  with 
There has been a growing interest in the last decades in 
developing  models  for  evaluating  the  performance  of 
scheduling  policies,  which  serve 
timing 
constraints.  Unlike  models  of  classical  queueing  theory, 
which  attempt  to  predict  general  performance  measures 
such as job delay, queue length, and processor utilization, 
models  of  real-time  systems  must  accurately  estimate 
performance  measures  such  as  the  fraction  of  jobs 
violating  their  timing  constraints.  Classical  queueing 
theory  usually  assumes  no  limits  on  the  waiting  time  of 
customers  in  the  system.  Such  systems are studied under 
many  different  conditions

context  of  queueing  theory,  customers  with  limited

customers.  An  impatient  customer  has  a  deadline  before 
which  it  is  available  for  service  and  after  which  it  must 
leave  the  system.  Two  models  of  customer  behavior  are 
usually  considered:  deadlines  until  the  beginning  of 
service  and  deadlines  until  the  end  of  service.  In  the 
former model, a customer keeps its deadline only until the 
beginning  of  service.  Accordingly,  customers  remain  in 
the  system  while  being  served  until  they  complete  their 
service  requirements.  In  the  latter  model,  a  customer 
retains its deadline until the end of service. Accordingly, 
customers  may  discontinue  their  service  due  to  missing 
their deadlines. This paper studies both of these models of 
customer  behavior.  Examples  of  systems  using  such 
models  may  be  found  in  many  real-life  situations.  Such 
systems  may  include  multimedia  applications  (digitized 
voice  and/or  video  over  a  network),  high-speed  packet 
switching networks, avionics systems (including ATC and 
radar),  ICU  (Intensive  Care  Unit)  systems,  industrial 
process  control,  and  many  other  critical  and  non-critical 
applications.  For  example,  in  a  high-speed  network, 
packets  usually  have  some  real-time  constraints  within 
which  they  are  to  be  received  at  their  destinations. 
Violating such real-time requirements may result in a lack 
of 
the 
communication.  In  addition,  failure  to  meet  the  timing 
requirements  of  tasks  in  a  safety-critical  application  may 
result in some catastrophic consequences.

In  general,  real-time  systems  can  be  categorized  into 
two  important  groups:  hard  real-time  systems  and  soft 
real-time  systems.  In  hard  real-time  systems,  meeting  all 
deadlines  must  be  validated,  while  in  soft  real-time 
systems, it can be predicted in a probabilistic manner. In 
other  words,  in  the  latter  systems,  some  performance 
measures  such  as 
loss  rate  can  be  effective  on

dependability  and/or  performability  of  the  system.  These 
types  of  real-time  systems  are  more  relevant  to  the 
analytical method introduced in this paper. 
The  analysis  of  queueing  systems  handling  customers 
with deadlines has been addressed in numerous papers [1-
7,9,10,12-17].    Palm  [14]  was  apparently  the  first  to 
introduce  impatience  to  customers.  The  literature  on 
queues with impatient customers includes some important 
contributions.  Barrer  [2]  first  analyzed  the  M/M/1+D
system.  Daley  [4]  gave  a  solution  for  the  general 
GI/GI/1+GI  system.  Baccelli  et  al.  [1]  also  proposed  a 
general  solution  for  this  problem.  Later,  Movaghar  in 
[12,13]  extended  the  idea  presented  by  Barrer  in  [2]  for 
all  types  of  deadline  distributions  and  a  state-dependent 
Poisson arrival process.  
In all of the above works, only FCFS scheduling policy 
is considered. The literature on the analysis of scheduling 
policies  that  use  information  on  timing  constraints  when 
scheduling  jobs  is  rather  limited  [5-7,9,10,17].  Among 
such  policies,  because  of 
the  optimality  of  EDF 
[11,15,16], its analysis is particularly valuable. There are 
very few papers on the analysis of EDF. The reason is the 
complexity of such analysis. Hong, Tan, and Towsley [6] 
first introduced a lower bound and an upper bound on the 
performance  of  an  M/M/m/EDF+M  queue.  The accuracy 
of  their  method  is  very  good  for  small  values  of  input 
rates  as  well  as  for  small  mean  relative  deadlines  of 
customers. The results presented in [6] are for normalized 
input  rates  up  to  1.2.  Based  on  these  results,  when 
deadlines are until the beginning of service, the amount of 
errors  is  about  3.1  %  or  less.  However,  in  the  case  of 
deadlines until the end of service, the errors are as much 
as 15 %. It is mentioned that these errors may increase for 
higher normalized input rates. Lehoczky [9] introduced a 
theory,  called  real-time  queueing  theory,  which  can  be 
used  for  an  informal  analysis  of  EDF  policy  in  M/M/1
queues  with  deadlines  under  heavy  traffic  conditions. 
Extended  treatments  of  the  results  in  [9]  were  later 
published  by  Lehoczky  in  [10]  and  by  Doytchinov, 
Lehoczky,  and  Shreve  in  [5].  Kruk  et.  al.  [7]  used  the 
approach presented in [5] for the analysis of a system of K 
input streams with a shared processor across the streams, 
where  streams  use  either  EDF  or  FCFS  as  their  service 
policy. Their analysis is also for the case of heavy traffic 
conditions.  
This paper introduces an approximation method for the 
analysis  of  EDF  which  is  quite  simple  and  relatively 
accurate  comparable  to  other  existing  methods.  We 
consider  an  M/M/1/EDF+M  model,  i.e.,  a  single  queue 
with  Poisson  arrival,  and  service  times  and  customer 
impatience  that  are  exponentially  distributed. 
  Two 
models  of  behavior  for  jobs  (customers)  are  considered: 
one  in  which  jobs  have  deadlines  until  the  beginning  of 
service and another in which jobs have deadlines until the 
end  of  service.  Our  method  covers  a  wide  range  of 
normalized input rates and is also simple to use. It gives 
an  accurate  approximation  for  an  important  measure  of 
performance in real-time systems, namely, the probability 
of missing deadline. A key parameter in our method is γn, 
which  is  the  rate  of  missing  deadline  when  there  are  n
customers  in  the  system.  This  important  parameter  is 
estimated using an upper bound and a lower bound. This 
is done first for the case of deadlines until the beginning 
of service and then for the case of deadlines until the end 
of  service.  Comparison  of  analytical  and  simulation 
results shows that the existing errors are rather small. The 
errors in the worst case are about 2.26 % when deadlines 
are until the beginning of service, and about 2.09 % when 
deadlines are until the end of service.  
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces 
the  basic  system  model  and  the  proposed  analytical 
method. Section 3 presents our method for estimating the 
loss rates of the system. In section 4, the numerical results 
are  shown  and  the  analytical  and  simulation  results  are 
compared.    Finally,  summary,  concluding  remarks  and 
future works are presented in section 5. 
2. System Model and Performance Measures 
that 
We  consider  a  single  processor 
is  serving 
customers  from  a  single  queue.  Customers  arrive 
according to a Poisson process with rate λ. Each customer 
requires  a  service  time  that  is  exponentially  distributed 
with  rate  µ  (notation  in  this  paper  uses  the  normalized 
arrival  rate  ρ,  which  is  ρ=λ/µ).  In  addition,  there  is  a 
relative deadline associated with each customer, which is 
the interval of time between the arrival of a customer and 
its  deadline.  We  assume  that  the  relative  deadlines  are 
exponentially  distributed  random  variables  with  rate  1/θ. 
Two  models  of  deadlines  are  considered:  deadlines  until 
the  beginning  of  service  and  deadlines  until  the  end  of 
service. In the former model, a customer is thrown away if 
it cannot begin execution before its deadline; otherwise, it 
is executed. A customer that is thrown away is considered 
lost.  In  the  latter  model,  a  customer  is  thrown  away  if  it 
does not complete execution before its deadline. This can 
occur while the customer is in the queue or while it is in 
service.  If the customer is in the queue at the time when 
the deadline is reached, the customer is thrown out. If the 
customer  is  in  service  at  the  time  when  the  customer 
reaches its deadline, it is aborted and then thrown out. In 
either  case,  the  customer  is  considered  lost.  In  both 
models,  always  the  customer  closest  to  its  deadline  is  to 
be  served  where 
the  first  model  of  deadlines, 
preemption is not allowed while in the latter model it will 
be  permitted.  It  is  proved  in  [15,16]  that  the  earliest- 
deadline-first scheduling policy (EDF) maximizes the

The  approach  presented  in  this  paper  is  based  on 
finding  a  state-dependent  loss  rate  function  γn.  Let  N  be 
the set of natural numbers and R+ the set of positive real 
numbers. For t, ε∈ R+ and n ∈ N, let 
Ψn(t,ε) ≡ the probability that a customer misses its 
deadline during [t,t+ε), given there are n customers in the 
system at time t.

γn  above  is  the  (steady-state)  rate  of  missing  deadline 
when  there  are  n  customers  in  the  system  (including  the 
one  being  served).    Then,  the  resulting  Markov  chain 
model  of  the  system,  M,  may  be  shown  as  in  Figure  1. 
When  the  population  of  the  system  is  n,  it  can  be 
decreased to n-1 because of either completing the service 
requirements  of  a  customer  (with  rate  µ)  or  missing  a 
customer’s deadline based on the model of deadlines (with 
rate γn). 
Barrer  [2] was the first to introduce the idea of γn for 
deterministic customer impatience. The idea was extended 
in [12-13] to a larger class of models when deadlines have 
a general distribution and customers arrive according to a 
state-dependent  Poisson  process.  These  latter  results 
assume FCFS policy and show that γn is independent of λ
and  only  depends  on  the  number  of  customers  in  the 
system.  In  [12],  it  is  described  how  to  calculate  γn  for 
deadlines until the beginning of service. The calculation of 
γn for the case of deadlines until the end of service is given 
in [13]. 
Let 
Pn(t) ≡ the probability that there are n customers in the 
system at time t.                                                           (2.3)
