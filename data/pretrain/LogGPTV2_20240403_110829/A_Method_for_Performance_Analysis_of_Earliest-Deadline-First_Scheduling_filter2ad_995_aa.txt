## Abstract

This paper introduces an analytical method for approximating the fraction of jobs that miss their deadlines in a real-time system when the earliest-deadline-first (EDF) scheduling policy is used. The system considers two scenarios: one where all jobs have deadlines until the beginning of service, and another where jobs have deadlines until the end of service. In the former case, EDF is known to be optimal, and in the latter case, it is optimal if preemption is allowed. The system is modeled as an M/M/1/EDF+M queue, which includes a single server with Poisson arrival, exponentially distributed service times, and customer impatience. The optimality property of EDF is utilized to estimate a key parameter, γn, which represents the loss rate when there are n customers in the system. This estimation is achieved by finding upper and lower bounds for γn and linearly combining these bounds. The resulting Markov chains are then solved numerically. Comparisons between numerical and simulation results show that the errors are relatively small.

## 1. Introduction

In recent decades, there has been growing interest in developing models to evaluate the performance of scheduling policies in systems with timing constraints. Unlike classical queueing theory, which focuses on general performance measures such as job delay, queue length, and processor utilization, real-time system models must accurately estimate the fraction of jobs that violate their timing constraints. Classical queueing theory often assumes no limits on the waiting time of customers, whereas real-time systems consider customers with limited waiting times, referred to as impatient customers. These customers have a deadline before which they are available for service and must leave the system if the deadline is missed.

Two models of customer behavior are typically considered:
1. Deadlines until the beginning of service: Customers retain their deadlines only until the start of service.
2. Deadlines until the end of service: Customers retain their deadlines until the end of service and may discontinue service if the deadline is missed.

This paper studies both models. Examples of systems using such models include multimedia applications, high-speed packet switching networks, avionics systems, ICU systems, industrial process control, and other critical and non-critical applications. In high-speed networks, packets have real-time constraints, and violating these can lead to communication failures. In safety-critical applications, missing timing requirements can result in catastrophic consequences.

Real-time systems can be categorized into hard real-time systems, where all deadlines must be met, and soft real-time systems, where meeting deadlines is predicted probabilistically. The latter systems, which are more relevant to the analytical method introduced in this paper, use performance measures like loss rate to assess dependability and performability.

The analysis of queueing systems handling customers with deadlines has been addressed in numerous papers. Palm [14] was the first to introduce customer impatience, and subsequent works by Barrer [2], Daley [4], Baccelli et al. [1], and Movaghar [12,13] extended this idea. However, most of these works consider only the first-come, first-served (FCFS) scheduling policy. The literature on scheduling policies that use timing information is limited, and the analysis of EDF is particularly valuable due to its optimality. Hong, Tan, and Towsley [6] introduced bounds on the performance of an M/M/m/EDF+M queue, while Lehoczky [9] and others [5,7,10] provided informal and formal analyses under heavy traffic conditions.

This paper introduces a simple and relatively accurate approximation method for the analysis of EDF. We consider an M/M/1/EDF+M model with Poisson arrival, exponentially distributed service times, and customer impatience. Our method covers a wide range of normalized input rates and provides an accurate approximation of the probability of missing a deadline. The key parameter, γn, is estimated using upper and lower bounds. Numerical and simulation results show that the errors are small, with worst-case errors of about 2.26% for deadlines until the beginning of service and 2.09% for deadlines until the end of service.

## 2. System Model and Performance Measures

We consider a single processor serving customers from a single queue. Customers arrive according to a Poisson process with rate λ, and each customer requires a service time that is exponentially distributed with rate µ. The normalized arrival rate is ρ = λ/µ. Each customer has a relative deadline, which is the interval between arrival and the deadline. We assume that the relative deadlines are exponentially distributed with rate 1/θ.

Two models of deadlines are considered:
1. **Deadlines until the beginning of service:** A customer is lost if it cannot begin execution before its deadline.
2. **Deadlines until the end of service:** A customer is lost if it does not complete execution before its deadline, either while in the queue or during service.

In both models, the customer closest to its deadline is served first. Preemption is not allowed in the first model but is permitted in the second. It is proven in [15,16] that EDF maximizes the fraction of customers that start (complete) service by their deadlines when preemption is not (is) allowed for the class of all policies that use no service time information and are work-conserving.

Our approach is based on finding a state-dependent loss rate function, γn. For t, ε ∈ R+ and n ∈ N, let:

\[ \Psi_n(t, \varepsilon) \equiv \text{the probability that a customer misses its deadline during } [t, t + \varepsilon), \text{ given there are } n \text{ customers in the system at time } t. \]

Define:

\[ \gamma_n(t) = \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} \frac{\Psi_n(t, \varepsilon)}{\varepsilon} \]

Assuming statistical equilibrium:

\[ \gamma_n = \lim_{t \to \infty} \gamma_n(t) \]

Here, γn is the steady-state rate of missing a deadline when there are n customers in the system. The resulting Markov chain model of the system, M, is shown in Figure 1. When the population of the system is n, it can decrease to n-1 due to either completing the service requirements of a customer (with rate µ) or missing a customer’s deadline (with rate γn).

Barrer [2] introduced the idea of γn for deterministic customer impatience, and this idea was extended in [12-13] to a larger class of models with general deadline distributions and state-dependent Poisson arrivals. These results assume FCFS policy and show that γn is independent of λ and depends only on the number of customers in the system. The calculation of γn for deadlines until the beginning of service is described in [12], and for deadlines until the end of service in [13].

Let:

\[ P_n(t) \equiv \text{the probability that there are } n \text{ customers in the system at time } t. \]

The balance equations for the system can be written as follows (N is the capacity of the system):

\[ \frac{dP_0(t)}{dt} = -\lambda P_0(t) + (\mu + \gamma_1) P_1(t) \]
\[ \frac{dP_n(t)}{dt} = \lambda P_{n-1}(t) - (\lambda + \mu + \gamma_n) P_n(t) + (\mu + \gamma_{n+1}) P_{n+1}(t) \quad \text{for } 1 \leq n < N \]
\[ \frac{dP_N(t)}{dt} = \lambda P_{N-1}(t) - (\mu + \gamma_N) P_N(t) \]

Let:

\[ p_n = \lim_{t \to \infty} P_n(t) \]

Then, in equilibrium, the balance equations become:

\[ \lambda p_0 = (\mu + \gamma_1) p_1 \]
\[ \lambda p_{n-1} - (\lambda + \mu + \gamma_n) p_n + (\mu + \gamma_{n+1}) p_{n+1} = 0 \quad \text{for } 1 \leq n < N \]
\[ \lambda p_{N-1} - (\mu + \gamma_N) p_N = 0 \]

These equations can be solved numerically to find the steady-state probabilities and the loss rate γn.
