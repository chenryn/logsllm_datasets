where ci is the fraction of nodes that belong to vendor i and ei j is
the fraction of edges connecting nodes of vendor i to nodes of ven-
dor j. The assortativity gets values in the [−1,1] range. If most of
the social relationships are between users who chose the same de-
vice vendor, then assortativity is positive, as ∑i∈C eii is close to 1.
In the opposite case, that is, if most of the social relationships are
between users who chose different device vendors, then assortativ-
ity is negative, as the values eii are close to 0. Finally, if social
relationships are independent of the device vendor, then assortativ-
ity has values close to 0, as eii ≈ cici.
For each dataset, we study how the assortativity of the corre-
sponding social network varies according to Adamic-Adar thresh-
old τ, so that we can verify whether mutual inﬂuence increases
with the strength of the social links. We also perform a signiﬁcance
test to rule out the possibility that the assortativity of the graph
depends only on the distribution of vendors popularity (shown in
Figure 1). The test consists in generating, for each dataset, a ran-
domized version of the corresponding afﬁliation network with the
same in-degree and out-degree distribution as the original one. This
is done by iteratively switching the endpoints of pairs of randomly
selected edges until the afﬁliation network converges to a random
bipartite graph. Then, we compare the assortativity of the social
networks obtained from the original and randomized afﬁliation net-
work with a given Adamic-Adar threshold.
The results of our measurements are reported in Figure 8 for a
sample of our datasets. The other datasets present similar character-
istics. As the ﬁgure shows, the vendor assortativity of our networks
is not only always positive, but also signiﬁcant, and the assortativ-
ity of the randomized network approximates zero. Second, as the
Adamic-Adar threshold increases, the assortativity increases too,
meaning that stronger social links are associated to stronger mutual
inﬂuence.
4.5 Social Analysis
Collecting probe requests of a large number of mobile devices
is an effective way to take a social snapshot of a crowd that par-
ticipated to an event or that live in a certain area. So far, we have
proved it by showing how it is possible to infer the social rela-
tionships between people in the crowd by leveraging the SSIDs in
the PNLs of the devices. The social networks we extracted share
the main properties of those emerging from other contexts, which
conﬁrms that our analysis methodology is sound. We now take a
further step. We show that certain characteristics of the popula-
tion that participated to the different events might be inferred from
the probe requests sent by their devices. In particular, we focus on
users’ language and on vendors popularity.
Inferring user languages
4.5.1
We observed that a large fraction of the SSIDs stored in directed
probe requests consist of natural language strings. In fact, as al-
ready discussed in Section 4.2, the SSIDs of many public WiFi
networks reveal the name of touristic attractions (e.g., “Tour Eif-
fel”), hotels (“manhattan hotel”), bars (“Caffe Barberini”), and so
on. On the other hand, we found that many broadband subscribers
customized the SSID of their WiFi network in a number of different
ways. For instance, some of them use their name. Some others use
their SSID as a way to communicate something to their neighbors
(“Please don’t steal our WiFi”), or even to cheer for their favorite
football club (“Forza Roma”). Intuitively, this should make it pos-
sible to get a hint on the language of the social context where a user
lives by just looking at the SSIDs in the PNL of her device. The
language would correspond either to the nationality of the user, if
she lives in her country, or to the language of the country where
she spends most of the time. Following this intuition, we deﬁned
an automatic and scalable user language identiﬁcation procedure
based on the name of the networks in the PNLs. When applied
to one of our datasets, this technique helps deduce the national or
international nature of the event, and the composition in terms of
nationality of the crowd in the event.
Automatic language detection.
Inferring the language of an SSID is not always an easy task as
SSIDs are very short (about 13 characters on average) and typi-
cally difﬁcult to analyze due to the lack of white spaces or the use
of special characters. This makes even the state-of-the-art meth-
ods for language identiﬁcation of short texts [2, 6] unsuitable for
our task. We therefore opted for a simple, ad-hoc methodology
that turned out to be very effective. Given an SSID, we tokenize it
after removing special characters and stop-words (including com-
mon words such as “WiFi” and “aDSL”). Each of the words is then

searched in a large corpora5 of texts in 5 languages (Italian, En-
glish, French and German) and assigned the language where it ap-
pears with highest frequency. The language of an SSID is then
given by the language of the majority of its words. If no language
is detected, or in case of ties, the language of the SSID is classiﬁed
as unknown. Similarly, the language of a user is set to be that of
the majority of the SSIDs in the PNL of her device, classifying it
as unknown in case of ties. We also improved the accuracy of our
automatic classiﬁcation by complementing it in two ways. First,
we manually annotated the language of the ﬁrst 2K most popular
SSIDs (∼ 2% of the total) in our All dataset. Due to the skewed
distribution of SSIDs popularity (see Figure 3), these SSIDs appear
in a very large fraction of PNLs (∼ 75%), thus greatly improving
the detection accuracy with a manual task that requires just a few
minutes to be completed. Second, we associated to SSIDs contain-
ing the name of popular broadband providers the language of the
country where the provider operates. For instance, “FASTWEB” is
assigned to Italian, “Orange” to French, “Verizon” to English and
so on. This is particularly useful to classify the language of those
broadband WiFi networks that were left with their default SSID.
We checked the accuracy of our classiﬁcation method over a ran-
domized sample of 1000 devices manually annotated by a panel of
three independent judges. On average, the judges found the per-
centage of correctly classiﬁed devices to be 92%. To measure the
level of agreement between the judges, we used a standard NLP
approach known as Free-Marginal k agreement [38]. The resulting
agreement value of k = 82% validates the reliability of our manual
review process.
Results.

datasets. For clarity, in the ﬁgure we explicitly show the Italian and

English languages only, aggregating all the remaining ones as “Oth-
ers”. Our results show a strong correlation between the percentage
of Italian devices and the international nature of the events. More
in detail, Vatican 1 (V1) and Vatican 2 (V2)—described as inter-
national events in Section 3.1.1—are amongst the datasets with the
lowest percentage of Italian devices. The Train Station (TS) dataset
too shows characteristics typical of an international event. This is a
direct consequence of the fact that the central train station in Rome
is located in one of the most international areas of the city. The
train station also happens to be the main hub connecting the city to
its airports, which makes it an almost forced stop of any tourist that
visits Rome. The Mall, Politics 1 (P1), Politics 2 (P2), and Other
datasets show, instead, a high (i.e., > 50%) percentage of Italian de-
vices, conﬁrming the fact that these events mostly consisted of an
Italian crowd. Nevertheless, the percentage of Italian devices that
were detected in these datasets is still signiﬁcantly lower than that
of the University (U) dataset. This is because the surroundings of
the university entrance where we positioned our ﬁxed antenna (see
Section 3.1.1) were almost exclusively frequented by students. As
in our university there are very few courses that are taught in En-
glish, these students are either Italian, or foreigners speaking Italian
and living in an Italian social context.
Assortativity of SSIDs’ languages.
Our SSID language detection method can also be used to verify
the intuition that people tend to connect to networks of the same
nationality. To do it, we ﬁrst build the graph GSSID of WiFi net-
works that share common users. More speciﬁcally, we add an edge
between two networks if there is at least one device that connected
to both of them. Then, we compute the language assortativity of
GSSID with the same technique described in Section 4.4 but, this
time, by partitioning the nodes of the graph according to their lan-
guage. The result conﬁrms our intuition as we found a positive
and signiﬁcant language assortativity of 0.20. By comparison, the
language assortativity of the randomized graph of SSIDs is −0.01,
showing that the result does not depend on the distribution of lan-
guage popularity.
4.5.2 Demographics of brand penetration
We now focus on device vendors. Our objective is to understand
what the distribution of vendors in a dataset reveals about the cat-
egories and the socioeconomic status of people that participated to
the corresponding event. In Figure 10 we show the distributions of
the device vendors of each of our datasets. Notice how the distribu-
tion of vendors varies in a less marked way from event to event with
respect to that of users languages. This is expected, as language
characterizes people in a much stronger way than the choice of a
device vendor. However, note that the vendor distribution is com-
puted over the total number of devices in each dataset, which can
be up to 4 times higher than the number of devices we could infer
the language of (compare column “Devices” with column “PNLs”
on Table 2). Therefore, small variations in the distributions can be
considered signiﬁcant in this case. That said, there are two trends
that emerge from our results. First, the Vatican 1, Vatican 2 and
Train Station datasets all feature a very similar vendor distribution,
which is characterized by a high (∼ 62%) percentage of Apple de-
vices and a low (∼ 15%) percentage of Samsung devices with re-
spect to most of the other datasets.
Interestingly, these datasets
correspond also to the events where we observed a signiﬁcant pres-
ence of tourists. Based on the observation that Apple devices are
typically more expensive that the others, these results can suggest
that foreigners visiting Rome may represent a sample of people that
are, on average, wealthier than those that participated to the local

events. This is reasonable, since a trip to a foreign country, espe-
cially in a historical city like Rome, can be rather expensive. Local
events, on the opposite, have the potential to attract an audience
which is wider both in terms of social extraction and economic sta-
tus. Second, we noticed that the differences in vendor popularity
between local events is correlated with the difference we observed
in the average age and social status of the people that participated.
Again, this may be caused by Apple devices being more expensive.
More in detail, we can notice a steep drop in the percentage of Ap-
ple devices when comparing the Politics 2 (∼ 65%) to the Politics 1
(∼ 54%) dataset, and the Mall (∼ 60%) to the University (∼ 51%)
dataset. In fact, the people that participated to the Politics 2 event
organized by the conservative party were, on average, older and
wealthier than those that participated to the Politics 1 event. Also,
