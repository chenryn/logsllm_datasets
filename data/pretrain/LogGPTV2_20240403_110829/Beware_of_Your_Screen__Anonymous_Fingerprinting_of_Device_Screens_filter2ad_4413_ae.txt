### Yearly Phone Replacement Trends

Users typically replace their phones for two primary reasons: the phone is outdated, or it is broken. In recent years, the pace of hardware evolution has slowed, leading our surveyed users to replace their phones due to obsolescence every 1.6 years on average. Accidental damage, on the other hand, occurs approximately once a year, which is less frequent.

### Mask Generation

Our study indicates that mask generation on a Nexus 6 device takes an average of 0.05 seconds. To contextualize this, we compared it with the delay in QR code display using WeChat, a leading mobile wallet application. Specifically, we measured the delay in QR code generation by recording the process at 29Hz, from the moment the button is clicked until the QR code is displayed. The results show that WeChat takes approximately 276 milliseconds (8/29 seconds) to generate and display the QR code. Therefore, the overhead introduced by AnonPrint, which is only 50 milliseconds, is relatively small for offline payment transactions.

### Fingerprint Extraction

Once a screen image is captured, the fingerprint is extracted and sent to the payment service provider via the POS network. The image size is typically 80-100 KB in JPEG format. Our desktop system takes an average of 0.64 seconds to extract the fingerprint from such an image.

### Fingerprint Verification

Our study found that the fingerprint verification process takes an average of 2.4 seconds. This overhead is primarily due to the ternary search for the correct contrast factor \( k \) when matching fingerprints. While noticeable, this delay is not significant, considering that acquiring a QR code from a screen typically takes about 1 second, not to mention additional delays in communication and processing on the payment provider's side. The performance of the search step can be improved by calculating the left and right forks during the ternary search in parallel, potentially reducing the processing time by half.

## Discussion

### Environmental Variance

One limitation of our work is that the fingerprint extraction process may be affected by strong ambient light, which can impact the precision of the fingerprint. However, QR code scanning usually occurs in controlled and dim environments, such as inside stores, facilitating rapid QR code recognition. To ensure a dim environment, some scanner manufacturers have designed scanners with lenses facing upwards, as shown in Figure 12. This design ensures that the phone covers the entire scanner, creating a nearly completely dark scanning environment.

**Figure 12: A Scanner Facing Upwards**

### Aging Problem

The fingerprint of a screen may change over time due to hardware aging, potentially causing legitimate transactions to fail. This issue can be mitigated by periodically updating the fingerprint. Given the frequency of mobile transactions, the server can detect shifts and update the fingerprint accordingly. Specifically, if the interval between consecutive transactions is short, the server can update the fingerprint if it detects a significant deviation but the transaction still passes authentication.

### Hardware Fingerprinting

#### Screens
Besides screens, many hardware modules on smartphones have unique features that enable user tracking.

#### Radio Frequency Fingerprinting
Arackaparambil et al. proposed a technique using clock skews in 802.11 networks to uniquely identify wireless devices [7]. PARADIS was developed to detect the source network interface card of 802.11 frames using passive radio-frequency analysis, exploiting transmitter imperfections [11]. Additionally, {Machine, NIC Driver, OS} combinations are used to fingerprint network devices [15]. There is also a generic RF device fingerprinting scheme [27]. However, these methods are not directly applicable to offline payments, which do not require a Wi-Fi network.

#### Sensor Fingerprinting
Accelerometers, widely equipped on smartphones, can be used for fingerprinting due to manufacturing imperfections [16]. Smartphone speakers also differ, allowing applications to measure sound characteristics for fingerprinting [14]. These hardware-based fingerprinting schemes, however, cannot protect against attackers who control the operating system, as they can easily measure and manipulate sensor outputs.

### Unconventional Tracking Methods

#### Web Browser Tracking
Attackers can track web browser users by checking the availability of specific font sets, time zones, screen resolutions, and HTTP request headers [10, 17]. Nikiforakis et al. demonstrated that over 800,000 users can be fingerprinted even when using user-agent-spoofing extensions [22].

#### Miscellaneous Tracking
Smartphones can be tracked through personalized device configurations [19], and the installed applications can predict user traits [25].

### Biometric Second-Factor Authentication

Various biometrics can be used for authentication, including face, fingerprint, and iris recognition. Some implicit biometric methods include:

#### Keystroke Dynamics
Different people type passwords with distinct patterns, which can be used for authentication [9, 26]. However, keystroke dynamics are not suitable for QR code payments, as no typing is required. Even with modified devices, the best schemes supporting text and digits input have a 12.8% Equal Error Rate (EER) [13], which is below the effectiveness of anonymized screen fingerprints.

#### Gait
Gafurov et al. proposed a framework for gait authentication using wearable device motion sensors [18]. Ngo et al. created a large database of 744 subjects to optimize gait authentication algorithms [21]. However, gait biometrics are difficult to collect in offline QR code payment scenarios, as the service provider does not have access to inertial sensor data.

## Conclusion

In this paper, we present a new technique that enhances security for QR-based payments without compromising payer privacy. Our method leverages the unique luminance unevenness of the payer's screen, ensuring that even if the digital wallet is compromised, unauthorized payments will fail. To address privacy concerns, we introduce AnonPrint, which obfuscates the phone screen during each transaction, preventing the correlation of purchase activities and enabling the payment provider to authenticate the payer. Our experiments demonstrate the promise of this new solution.
