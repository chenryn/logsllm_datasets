Feature Request: Enhance Functionality for Opening Recent Documents and Reopening the Last Closed Window

We propose the addition of two new features to improve user experience and efficiency:

1. **Open Recent Documents**: This feature will allow users to quickly access a list of their most recently opened documents, enabling them to resume work seamlessly without having to manually search for files.

2. **Reopen Last Closed Window**: This functionality will enable users to easily restore the last closed window, which can be particularly useful in scenarios where a window is accidentally closed or when switching between multiple tasks.

These enhancements will streamline workflow and provide a more intuitive and user-friendly interface.
