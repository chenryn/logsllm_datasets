It is very common to read random rows in a large csv file, typically for
testing with a small dataset, or fit the limit of memory. The parameter
`nrows` is used for read the first n lines, but I didn't find any feature to
read random lines. Such parameter might be named `keeprows` (opposite to
`skiprows`), which supports:
  * int, e.g. `keeprows=100` means keep 100 random lines (uniformly)
  * float in (0, 1), e.g. `keeprows=0.05` means keep 5% of total lines
  * list of int(or iterable), e.g. `keeprows=[1, 3, 8]` mean to keep line 1, 3, and 8
