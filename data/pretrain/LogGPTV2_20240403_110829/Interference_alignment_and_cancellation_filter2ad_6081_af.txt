We investigate IAC’s performance in a large network with many active
clients (e.g., a large conference room). When the number of clients is
larger than the maximum number of concurrent packets, one has many
options for which clients transmit concurrently, both on the uplink and
downlink. Choosing a particular option impacts both fairness and the
total rate. In fact, in any wireless network, there is always a tension
between maximizing transfer rate and ensuring fairness because the
best option in terms of rate would always transmit to the client with
the best channel and starve the others. Thus, we want to look at the
performance in terms of both fairness and rate maximization.
In particular, we compare 802.11-MIMO against three algorithms
for picking concurrent clients. All three algorithms pick the packet
at the head of the queue for transmission; however, they differ in
the choice of which other packets to concurrently transmit with the
9The literature also presents another way in which 802.11-MIMO can exploit diversity.
In this case, the two antennas are used to send/receive the same packet/symbol. This
approach however is less desirable since it requires 802.11-MIMO to give up on sending
two concurrent packets, and repeat the same packet on both antennas [29].
10Note that comparing these options to ﬁnd the best can be done merely by computing
the capacity using our knowledge of the channel matrices [29].

Figure 15: Gains in Transfer Rate for the Whole Testbed. The ﬁgure
shows CDFs of client gains for three IAC concurrency algorithms. Each
CDF is taken over 17 active clients. The ﬁgure shows that the three
variants of IAC behave differently. IAC+brute-force delivers extreme
gains to some clients while reducing the rate of other clients below their
rates with 802.11-MIMO. IAC+FIFO is fairer but has low overall gains.
IAC+best-of-two has the best fairness-throughput tradeoff.
head-of-the-queue packet. The ﬁrst algorithm is a brute force search
that ﬁnds packets in the queue that maximize the rate.11 The second
algorithm, which we refer to as FIFO, combines the packets according
to their arrival order. The third algorithm is the best of two choices,
which is explained in §7.2. This is the choice that IAC adopts.
Experiment. We use all nodes in the testbed in Fig. 11. We pick
three nodes to be APs and let the other 17 nodes be clients. Each
client has inﬁnite demands. This ensures that a client’s throughput is
not limited by its own demands but by how the concurrency algorithm
chooses to serve the client. Packets from different clients arrive at the
system in random order. Each run involves using the medium for 1000
timeslots, and we repeat a run 3 times to compute the average rate
per client. We run the experiment with four designs: 802.11-MIMO,
IAC+best-of-two, IAC+brute-force, and IAC+FIFO. For each client,
we compute the average rate it achieves under 802.11-MIMO and
the three variants of IAC. For each variant of IAC, we compute the
change in client transfer rate in comparison to 802.11-MIMO, i.e.,
the gain seen by each client. We compare the three variants of IAC
by comparing their gains over 802.11-MIMO.
Results. Figs. 15a and 15b show the CDFs of the gains of the three
IAC concurrency algorithms with respect to 802.11-MIMO, both on
the uplink and downlink. The ﬁgures reveal the following ﬁndings:
• All three approaches for choosing concurrent packets provide a
signiﬁcant gain over 802.11-MIMO. The average gain on uplink
is: 2.32x for the brute force approach, 1.9x for the FIFO approach,
and 2.08x for the best-of-two approach. Similarly, on the downlink,
the average gain is: 1.58x for the brute force approach, 1.23x for
the FIFO approach, and 1.52x for the best-of-two approach. (Note
that while IAC’s multiplexing gain is bounded by 2x, the total gain
can be larger because it includes diversity gains.)
11The relative rate can be estimated without transmitting the packets as ∑i log(1 +
i Hi ~wi||2), where the sum is over client-AP pairs, Hi is the channel for a pair, and ~vi
||~vT
and ~wi are the corresponding encoding and decoding vectors [29].

Figure 16: Channel Reciprocity. This ﬁgure plots the fractional dif-
ference between the direct estimate of a downlink channel and its es-
timate based on reciprocity. The x-axis refers to runs at different
clients/locations. The ﬁgure shows that estimates based on reciprocity
provide a reasonable accuracy and can be used in IAC.
• The three approaches differ widely with respect to fairness. In
particular, the brute-force approach is signiﬁcantly unfair. A few
clients get a humongous boost in transfer rate, while many clients
have a gain smaller than 1, i.e., their rates are better with 802.11-
MIMO. The other schemes have a better fairness, with the best-of-
two approach having the best fairness-throughput tradeoff.
• Thus, IAC, which employs the best-of-two approach, provides good
fairness and high throughput. It delivers an average rate increase of
2.08x on the uplink and 1.52x on the downlink. Further, no client
suffers a notable reduction in rate in comparison to 802.11-MIMO.

bitrate) and links across clusters are weak (i.e.,low bitrate). The
throughput of clustered networks is bottlenecked by the low bitrate
inter-cluster links. IAC can double the throughput of the inter-cluster
bottleneck links. In fact, this scenario is analogous to a WLAN where
nodes in the same cluster can be thought of as being connected with a
high bandwidth Ethernet. We believe that IAC can naturally increase
throughput in these settings. Further exploration of IAC in ad hoc
settings is left for future work.

Experiment. We take 17 random client-AP pairs from the testbed,
and measure their uplink and downlink channels. We compute the
calibration matrices according to Eq. 8. For each pair, we then ﬁx
the AP and move the client. This causes the uplink and downlink
channels to change (but the calibration matrices stay the same.) We
now make the AP measure the uplink channel, H u, and multiply it by
the calibration matrices to estimate the downlink channel H d
reciprocity.
We compare this estimate with the downlink channel as estimated at
the client, H d

client-AP pairs, we plot the average fractional error in Fig. 16.
Results. The ﬁgure shows that reciprocity holds to a large extent.
The fractional error between the actual downlink channel and the
estimate based on reciprocity stays small. Note that since the client
changed location between the estimation of the calibration matrices
and their later application to estimate the downlink channel, reci-
procity is reasonably accurate despite client movement. This result
does not contradict prior measurements which show that links could
be highly asymmetric in their loss rate. Reciprocity refers only to the
channel matrix, but the performance of a link depends also on the
noise level at the receiving node, which could be highly asymmetric.
11 Conclusion
This paper introduces interference alignment and cancellation (IAC).
IAC weaves two signal processing techniques: interference alignment
and interference cancellation, such that the combination applies to
new scenarios that could not have beneﬁted from either technique
alone. We show both analytically and via a prototype implementation
that IAC doubles the throughput of MIMO LANs.
We believe that IAC can provide beneﬁts in scenarios other than
those explored in the paper. For example, IAC also extends to clus-
tered MIMO networks, which can occur in ad-hoc and mesh settings,
like that in Fig. 17, where links within a cluster are strong (i.e., high
