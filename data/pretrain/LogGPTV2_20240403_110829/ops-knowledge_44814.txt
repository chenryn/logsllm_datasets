User: I need to install glibc-devel package for my EBS python 2.7 64 bits at AWS.
Different from any other solutions, I have to install python27-devel instead of python-devel, postgresql93-devel instead of postgresql-devel, so I was wondering the correct name for glibc-devel package because with that name it seems to skipt the installation yum packages (.ebextensions/config file).
The main problem is to install lxml from pip packages. I successfully installed libxslt-devel and libxml2-devel in that server, also gcc and patch.
Assistant: Answer to my question, the package name is: glibc-devel.i686
