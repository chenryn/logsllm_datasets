**ATT&CK ID:** T1588.005  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Exploits

Adversaries may acquire exploits through various means, such as purchasing, stealing, or downloading them, to use in their targeting efforts. An exploit is a piece of code or a technique that takes advantage of a bug or vulnerability in software or hardware, causing unintended or unanticipated behavior. Instead of developing their own exploits, adversaries often seek out and modify existing exploits available online or purchase them from exploit vendors. This approach allows them to leverage pre-existing vulnerabilities with less effort and potentially greater effectiveness.
