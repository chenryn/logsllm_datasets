User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Wal-E cron job not executing I have a cron job setup that is suppose to be running the wal-e backup-push command. The command works fine if manually ran through the command line. As the postgres user of course. So I setup a cron job to run this under the postgres user. It runs but does not do anything. The cron log says the job was completed.

Am I missing something obvious here? Any suggestions or help would be great.

0 2 * * * source ~/.bashrc &amp;&amp; envdir /etc/wal-e.d/env wal-e backup-push /db01/pg


I've also tried.

0 2 * * * bash -l -c 'source ~/.bashrc &amp;&amp; envdir /etc/wal-e.d/env wal-e backup-push /db01/pg'

CROND[31655]: (postgres) CMD (/usr/bin/envdir /etc/wal-e.d/env /usr/local/bin/wal-e backup-push /db01/pg)

Assistant: This command is the final solution. It turned out that I was using the incorrect envdir path. I found the correct path by using which envdir when logged into the shell.


source ~/.bashrc; /usr/local/bin/envdir /etc/wal-e.d/env wal-e backup-push /db01/pg
