### Figure 9: Average Vehicle Delay Every One Minute with and without Attack

- **Time (s):** 0, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000, 3500
- **Average Delay (s):** 0, 0, 0, 50, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000, 3500

**Description:**
The figure illustrates the average vehicle delay every one minute with and without an attack. The repeated blocking effects start at around second 1125. The demand is leveraged to create the blocking effect, significantly increasing the congestion level. After 10 minutes, the spillover is finally cleared, but within just one minute, the blocking effect reoccurs. This pattern of repeated blocking continues until the end of the experiment.

During the traffic jam period starting from second 1125, nearly 600 vehicles arrive, and approximately 50% of them spend nearly three minutes for a trip that would normally take half a minute (27.7 seconds on average). Additionally, about 22% of the vehicles spend over 7 minutes, which is 14 times longer than the usual duration. For these 22% of vehicles, if the trip involves a series of intersections (e.g., in a corridor), a 10-minute trip can now take over 2 hours.

### IX. Defense Discussions

#### Robust Algorithm Design for the Transition Period

Our study demonstrates that while the I-SIG system is highly effective in benign settings, its current algorithm design and configuration choices are highly vulnerable to data spoofing. To proactively address these issues before larger-scale deployment, this section discusses potential defense directions based on our analysis.

- **Effective Congestion Attack:** The most effective congestion attack occurs during the transition period, where the total delay increase percentage is nearly 200%. Continuous attacks lasting less than 20 minutes can trigger a blocking effect on an entire approach, causing massive traffic jams.
- **Current System Limitations:** According to the current I-SIG system design, such problems can only be largely alleviated when the penetration rate (PR) of connected vehicle (CV) technology exceeds 95%. However, achieving this PR may take 25-30 years after the mandate starts, as estimated by the USDOT [16].
- **Transition Period Challenges:** The lack of a robust signal control algorithm for the transition period is a fundamental issue. The COP algorithm, introduced in §II-B2, is suitable for CV-based signal control but is optimal only in the full deployment period. The current design attempts to infer unequipped vehicle data, but if this inference is not robust, it can be manipulated for malicious purposes, as demonstrated in this study.
- **Research Collaboration:** Given the long transition period, there is a need for joint research efforts between the transportation and security communities to develop effective and robust signal control algorithms specifically for the transition period.

#### Performance Improvement for RSUs

- **COP Algorithm Suitability:** As discussed in §II-B2 and analyzed in §VI, the arrival time-based signal planning in the COP algorithm is well-suited for CV-based signal control. With sufficient computational power, such planning is very difficult to influence with small amounts of spoofed data.
- **Current RSU Limitations:** Due to the limited performance of today's Road Side Units (RSUs), the I-SIG system uses a suboptimal implementation of the COP algorithm, introducing the "last vehicle advantage." This allows data from a single attack vehicle to significantly influence signal control.
- **Necessity for Upgrades:** Even if the security challenges for the transition period are addressed, the I-SIG system remains vulnerable to data spoofing attacks. Therefore, improving the performance of RSUs, both in software (e.g., code optimization) and hardware (e.g., CPU and memory upgrades), is crucial. Such improvements will help balance the trade-off between security and performance.

#### Data Spoofing Detection Using Infrastructure-Controlled Sensors

- **Data Validity Checks:** Another defense direction is to detect and filter Basic Safety Messages (BSMs) with spoofed data on the infrastructure side. Since BSMs are correctly signed, detection must rely on data validity checks.
- **Infrastructure Sensors:** The I-SIG system currently relies solely on attacker-controlled trajectory data via BSMs, making any data validity check ineffective. To ensure high effectiveness, data spoofing detection should use data sources that attackers cannot easily control, such as infrastructure-controlled sensors.
- **Existing Sensors:** Existing infrastructure-side sensors, like vehicle detectors buried underneath stop bars, can be repurposed for data spoofing detection. These sensors, though less useful in a CV environment, can provide aggregated traffic information for cross-validation. If this data is insufficient, more informative sensors, such as cameras, may be necessary.
- **Future Work:** A key challenge is designing a detection system that is both accurate and hard to evade, leveraging different types of infrastructure-side sensors. This remains an area for future research.

### X. Related Work

#### Data Spoofing Attacks in the CV Environment

- **Previous Studies:** Similar to our work, previous studies have identified data spoofing as a realistic attack vector in the CV environment. Amoozadeh et al. [17] studied V2V-based automated vehicle platoon systems and found that spoofed attacks can cause rear-end collisions or significant instability. A more recent work [23] summarizes a comprehensive list of data spoofing attack sources, including DSRC and other sensors like GPS.
- **Comparison with V2V Attacks:** While these studies focus on V2V attacks, our paper is the first to expose concrete data spoofing attacks on the transportation infrastructure side through V2I. V2I attacks can affect all vehicles in an intersection, leading to much wider impacts on the transportation system compared to V2V attacks, which can only affect one lane of vehicles at a time.

#### Critical Infrastructure Security

- **Security Challenges:** Several studies have investigated the security of critical infrastructure and facilities, such as smart grids [18], [31]. These studies highlight the security challenges and severe consequences of introducing connectivity into previously isolated critical systems.
- **Trafﬁc Controller Security:** Ghena et al. [27] performed the first publicly available security analysis of a deployed traffic infrastructure system, finding that traffic controllers use weak credentials and can be remotely controlled by attackers. Our work targets the next-generation CV-based traffic control and assumes that credential issues have been resolved, focusing on new security problems at the traffic control algorithm level.

#### Trafﬁc Control Algorithm Security

- **Prior Research:** Prior to our study, few studies explored the security problems in traffic control algorithms. Laszka et al. [30] performed a theoretical analysis to estimate the potential congestion an attacker can create by compromising multiple signal controllers. A follow-up study [26] considered a weaker assumption, where the attacker can only compromise traffic flow sensors.
- **Comparison:** Neither of these works analyzes the CV-based signal control scenario targeted in our study. Our threat model, which involves data spoofing from a single attack vehicle, is more realistic compared to their model, which assumes the ability to compromise arbitrary numbers of infrastructure-side devices.

### XI. Concluding Remarks

In this work, we conducted the first security analysis of the emerging CV-based signal control system. Targeting a highly realistic threat model, data spoofing from a single attack vehicle, we performed vulnerability analysis and found that the current signal control algorithm design and configuration choices are highly vulnerable to congestion attacks. Real-world evaluation results validated the attack effectiveness and showed that the attacks can even create a blocking effect that jams entire approaches. We discussed potential defense directions, leveraging insights from our analysis.

This work serves as a first step in understanding the new security problems and challenges in next-generation CV-based transportation systems. It is expected to inspire further studies, including more extensive evaluations with different intersection sizes and traffic patterns, analysis of other CV-based transportation systems and algorithms, and the design and evaluation of concrete defense systems.
