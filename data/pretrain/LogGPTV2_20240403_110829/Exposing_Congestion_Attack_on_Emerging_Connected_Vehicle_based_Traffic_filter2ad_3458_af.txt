second 1125.
demand is leveraged to create the blocking effect, and thus the
congestion level is signiﬁcantly increased. After 10 minutes,
the spillover is ﬁnally cleared, but in as short as 1 minute,
the blocking effect happens again. In the ﬁgure, we can see
such repeated blocking effect till the end of the experiments.
In the trafﬁc jam period starting from second 1125 till the end,
nearly 600 vehicles arrive and around 50% of them need to
spend nearly three minutes for an originally half-minute trip
(27.7 seconds on average), and around 22% need to spend over
7 minutes, which is 14 times higher. This means that for these
22% of vehicle, if the trip involves a series of intersections,
i.e., in a corridor, a 10-minute trip can now cost over 2 hours.
IX. DEFENSE DISCUSSIONS
As shown in our study, even though the I-SIG system
has shown high effectiveness in benign settings, the current
algorithm design and conﬁguration choices are highly vulner-
able to data spooﬁng. To proactively addressed these problems
before larger-scale deployment, this section discusses defense
directions based on the insights from our analysis.
Robust algorithm design for the transition period. As
concretely shown in our evaluation, the most effective conges-
tion attack is on the transition period: the total delay increase
percentage is nearly 200%, and by continuously attacking for
less than 20 minutes, it is able to trigger the blocking effect
on an entire approach, causing massive trafﬁc jams. According
to the current I-SIG system design, such problem can only
be largely alleviated when PR reaches more than 95%. This
is thus the most urgent problem in the current I-SIG system
design: the market penetration rate of CV technology needs
to start somewhere, and thus it inevitably needs to go through
a transition period. Even after all new light-duty vehicles are
mandated to install OBUs, which is exactly what the USDOT
is proposing now, there are still heavy duty vehicles and old
vehicles on the roads. As estimated by the USDOT [16], it may
13
take 25-30 years to reach a 95% PR after it starts such mandate.
Thus, if such system cannot handle the security challenges for
the transition period, it is not robust enough to get the larger-
scale deployment even started in practice.
Fundamentally, this is caused by the lack of a sufﬁciently
robust signal control algorithm for the transition period. As
introduced in §II-B2, the COP algorithm is a suitable design
choice for the CV-based signal control, but it is only optimal
in the full deployment period. To ensure that the I-SIG system
can still be effective when PR is low, the current design tries
to infer the unequipped vehicle data to solve the dilemma.
However, if such inference is not robust, it can be greatly
manipulated for malicious purposes — which is exactly what
we have uncovered in this study. Since the amount of vehicle
data input
in the full deployment
period, any signal control algorithm for the transition period
is inherently more sensitive to data spooﬁng attacks, making
it fundamentally more challenging to ensure the robustness.
Considering that the transition period is unavoidable and may
last as long as 30 years, we believe that this calls for a
joint research effort among both the transportation and the
security communities to design effective and robust signal
control algorithms speciﬁcally for the transition period.
is much less than that
Performance improvement
for RSUs. As introduced
in §II-B2 and analyzed in §VI, the arrival time based signal
planning in the COP algorithm is very suitable for the CV-
based signal control, and when given enough computation
power, such planning is indeed very hard to be maliciously
inﬂuenced by small amounts of spoofed data in the full deploy-
ment period. Unfortunately, due to the limited performance
in today’s RSUs, the I-SIG system has to use a suboptimal
implementation of the COP algorithm, which is found to
introduce the last vehicle advantage, allowing the data from
one single attack vehicle to signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the signal
control. Because of this, even if the security challenge for
the transition period is addressed, the I-SIG system can still
be greatly manipulated by data spooﬁng attacks. Thus, it is
important to improve the performance of today’s RSUs so
that more optimal conﬁgurations can be used in the trafﬁc
control. Such improvement can be at both the software level,
e.g., code optimization, and the hardware level, e.g., CPU and
memory upgrades. Such performance improvement is gener-
ally beneﬁcial since more computation capabilities can help
better balance the trade-off between security and performance.
Data spooﬁng detection using infrastructure-controlled
sensors. Besides improving the robustness at the control algo-
rithm level, another defense direction is to detect and ﬁlter the
BSM messages with spoofed data on the infrastructure side.
Since these messages are still correctly signed, such defense
must rely on data validity checks. Unfortunately, in the current
design, the I-SIG system only has one data source about the
attack vehicle — the attacker-controlled trajectory data via
BSM messages [6]. Thus, any data validity check methods
based on this are unlikely to be effective since the attacker
can strategically control the spoofed data so that the vehicle
trajectories appears perfectly normal.
Thus, to ensure high effectiveness, data spooﬁng detection
on the infrastructure side needs to rely on data sources that
attackers cannot easily control, e.g., infrastructure-controlled
sensors,
to cross validate the data in BSM messages. We
ﬁnd that there are actually existing infrastructure-side sensors
ready to be used for this purpose. For example, the vehicle
detectors buries underneath the stop bar of each lane was
used to measure aggregated trafﬁc information in today’s
trafﬁc control. Even though they are less useful in the CV
environment, they may be re-purposed to help detect data
spooﬁng, which may be a cost effective solution since they
are installed already. If such aggregated data is not sufﬁcient,
the infrastructure side may need to install sensors with more
informative data, e.g., cameras. One challenge in this direction
is how to best leverage different types of infrastructure-side
sensors to design a detection system that is both accurate and
hard to evade, which we leave as future work.
X. RELATED WORK
Data spooﬁng attack in the CV environment. Similar
to our work, previous work also identiﬁes data spooﬁng as a
realistic attack vector in the CV environment. Amoozadeh et
al. studied the V2V-based automated vehicle platoon system,
and found that spoofed attacks can cause rear-end collision or
signiﬁcant instability [17]. A more recent work summarizes a
comprehensive list of data spooﬁng attack sources including
not only DSRC but also other sensors such as GPS [23]. While
these work focus on data spooﬁng attacks on V2V, our paper
is the ﬁrst study that exposes concrete data spooﬁng attacks on
the transportation infrastructure side through V2I. Compared
to V2V attacks that can at most affect one lane of vehicles at
a time, V2I attacks can affect all vehicles in an intersection as
concretely shown in our evaluation, and thus are able to cause
much wider impact on the transportation system.
Critical infrastructure security. Several studies have in-
vestigated the security of critical infrastructure and facilities,
e.g., smart grid [18], [31]. These studies highlight the security
challenges and the severe consequences brought by introducing
connectivity into these previously isolated critical systems,
which is also concretely shown in this work for the next-
generation CV-based transportation. Closer to our work, Ghena
et al. performed the ﬁrst publicly available security analysis of
a deployed trafﬁc infrastructure system [27]. Their work found
that the trafﬁc controllers uses weak credentials and can be
remotely controlled by the attacker. In comparison, our work
targets the next-generation CV-based trafﬁc control instead of
the traditional one. In addition, the weak credential problem
they discovered is a known problem across many embedded
network devices [22], and can be ﬁxed using state-of-the-
art authentication mechanisms [27]. In comparison, our study
assumes that such problem has already been solves, and targets
new security problems at the trafﬁc control algorithm level.
Trafﬁc control algorithm security. Prior to our study, very
few studies explored the security problems in the trafﬁc control
algorithms. Laszka et al. performed a theoretical analysis
to estimate the potential congestion an attacker can create
assuming that she can arbitrarily compromise multiple signal
controllers [30]. A follow-up study was then performed for
the same attack goal but with a weak assumption, in which
the attacker can only compromise the sensors that collects
trafﬁc ﬂow information [26]. In comparison, neither of these
work analyzes the CV-based signal control scenario targeted
in our work. In addition, compared to their thread model
that assumes the ability of compromising arbitrary numbers
14
of infrastructure-side devices, our threat model, data spooﬁng
from one signal attack vehicle, is much more realistic (§III).

Integration
(VII)
In this work, we perform the ﬁrst security analysis of
the emerging CV-based signal control system. Targeting a
highly realistic threat model, data spooﬁng from one single
attack vehicle, we perform vulnerability analysis and ﬁnd
that the current signal control algorithm design and conﬁg-
uration choices are highly vulnerable to congestion attacks.
The evaluation results under real-world settings validate the
attack effectiveness and show that the attacks can even create a
blocking effect that jams whole approaches. Defense directions
are then discussed leveraging the insights.
This work serves as a ﬁrst step to understand the new
security problems and challenges in the next-generation CV-
based transportation systems. It is expected to inspire a series
of follow-up studies, including but not limited to (1) more
extensive evaluation with different intersection sizes and trafﬁc
patterns, (2) more extensive analysis considering other CV-
based transportation systems, algorithms, and security implica-
tions, (3) more concrete defense system design and evaluation.
