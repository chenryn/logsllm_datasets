More generally, the expected throughput of an interval with
size 𝑝 is the average of these different sets of starting points with
different length shared prefixed, weighted by size. More explicitly,

which has size (2−𝑔(𝑝)−𝑝), the difference between 𝑝 and the nearest
power of two less than 2. The sum corresponds to the when the

B HEURISTIC OPTIMIZATIONS
In evaluating Meteor, we also implement two heuristic optimiza-
tions that could lead to better performance without compromising
security. Note that while they increases the expected throughput
of scheme, it is not guaranteed to do so. Making any change to the
output selected in a given sampling event might unintentionally
push the model down a lower entropy branch of the covertext space,
yielding more sampling iterations overall. The first optimization
is performing a deterministic reordering operation of the model
distribution, reduces the number of calls to the generative model
by 20%-25%, and in some cases results in more efficient encoding
and decoding times. The second optimization is an adaptation from
the NLP literature that uses the generative model’s internal word
representation to compress English language messages.
Before proceeding to the optimizations themselves, recall the
intuition provided for Meteor in Section 5. In each iteration of
the encoding algorithm, the sender extracts a probability distribu-
tion P from the generative model. P is subdivided into a series of
continuous intervals 𝑟0, 𝑟1, . . . 𝑟𝑚, the size of which determines the
probability that the model would select the corresponding token is
the next output. Meteor then generates a random sampling value
𝑟 = 𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑘 ⊕ 𝑚 and determines the interval 𝑟𝑖 into which 𝑟 falls. The
number of bits encoded is computed as LenPrefix(𝑟𝑖).
Optimization 1: Reordering the Distribution. We note that
while we cannot manipulate |𝑟𝑖| without compromising the se-
curity of scheme, we are able to impact LenPrefix(𝑟𝑖) by permuting
the order of 𝑟0, 𝑟1, . . . , 𝑟𝑚. It is clear there exists some such permu-
tation that maximizes the expected throughput of Meteor, although
finding this permutation proves to be difficult.
The distribution P is generally output by the model in some
sorted or lexicographic order. This might yield to some orderings
of 𝑟𝑖 that are incredibly unfavorable to LenPrefix(·). Consider an
illustrative example in Figure 8a. If an interval 𝑟𝑖 contains values on
either side of the middle of the distribution, then LenPrefix(𝑟𝑖) = 0.
When a large interval does so, as in cases (1) and (3), this severely
decreases the expected number of bits that the distribution can
encode. While this example is clearly contrived, it illustrates the
impact correctly ordering P can have on the expected throughput
– in this example an increase of over 50%. Importantly, we can use
any reorganization procedure on the distribution provided (1) the
same resulting permutation can be computed by both the sender
and the receiver and (2) the size of 𝑟𝑖 remains the same for all 𝑟𝑖.

(a) The impact of reorganizing a distribution.
Figure 8: (a) 𝑟0 has 3% of the total probability density, while 𝑟1 and 𝑟2 have 48% and 49% respectively. Because 2−6 < .03 < 2−5, 𝑟0 can encode
5 bits of information when located at the beginning or end of the distribution. In orderings (1) and (2), one of the larger intervals crosses
the 50% line, meaning LenPrefix(·) = 0. When the smallest interval is placed in the middle, the total expected throughput of the distribution
rises. (b) To reorder this distribution we create 22 = 4 buckets, because the entropy is 1.16. In (1), we place the largest interval 𝑟1 into bucket 0,
overflowing its value through most of bucket 1. Note that 𝑟1 could have been placed in bucket 2; in general, we break ties by taking the earlier
bucket. In (2), 𝑟2 can be placed either in bucket 1, overflowing into the following buckets, or placed in bucket 2, overflowing into bucket 3. To
maximize LenPrefix(𝑟2), we place it in bucket 2. Finally, in (3), we note that 𝑟0 will not fit in bucket 3, so it must be placed in bucket 1, pushing
𝑟2 to make space.
Finding the optimal permutation of P proves to be a difficult
task. Intuitively, each interval 𝑟𝑖, must be placed as a continuous
block somewhere between 0 and 1 such that it does not overlap with
other intervals. We take inspiration from approximation algorithms
and design a greedy algorithm with pretty good performance, and
we leave formal analysis and bounds proving of this algorithm
for future work. A simple algorithm would be to find a “starting
point” to place each interval, starting with the largest, that maxi-
mizes LenPrefix(𝑟𝑖). However, there are 2𝛽 possible starting points,
𝑖 (𝑟𝑖)
meaning a linear search will be prohibitively expensive. Instead
we generate 2⌈𝐻 (P)⌉ buckets with capacity
2⌈𝐻 (P)⌉ , where 𝐻(P) is
the entropy in the distribution. These buckets represent potential
“starting points” that each 𝑟𝑖 can be placed. Note that the entropy
represents an upper bound on the possible value of the expected
throuhput 𝐸(P) and if each interval 𝑟𝑖 could perfectly fit into one
of these bins, 𝐸(P) = 𝐻(P).
Starting with the largest 𝑟𝑖, we find the bin that will maximize
LenPrefix(𝑟𝑖) when 𝑟𝑖 is appended to that bucket. As buckets be-
come full, they are no longer options for placement. Note that 𝑟𝑖
may exceed the remaining capacity of a bucket, or even the total
capacity of a bucket. When this is the case, we “overflow” the re-
mainder into the following buckets. Occasionally, this overflowing
remainder may cause a chain reaction, requiring other, already
placed intervals be “pushed” to make space. We give a simple ex-
ample of our reorganization algorithm in Figure 8b, using the same
distribution given in Figure 8a. Step (3) gives an example of over-
flow that causes one of these chain reactions. Once each interval
has been placed into a bin, the final ordering can be recovered by
appending the contents of the bins.
The runtime of this algorithm is 𝑂(2⌈𝐻 (P)⌉𝑚), where 𝑚 is the
number of intervals; in our experiments, ⌈𝐻(P)⌉ is typically less
than 7, so this is close to 𝑂(𝑚), which is unsurprising given its
similarities to bin-sorting. When 𝑛 is very large, however, this
algorithm is prohibitively expensive. In those cases, we use this
algorithm to place the “big” intervals, and then simply place the
smaller intervals into the first bucket with space. As we discuss in
§6, reordering the distributions increases capacity by 20%-25%.

This appendix contains stegotext outputs as generated by Meteor
using several different model types. The plaintext associated with
all of these outputs is the first 160 bytes of Lorem Ipsum. Figure

Context:
The Alvarez hypothesis posits that the mass extinction of the dinosaurs and many other living things during the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event
was caused by the impact of a large asteroid on the Earth. Prior to 2013, it was commonly cited as having happened about 65 million years ago, but Renne
and colleagues (2013) gave an updated value of 66 million years. Evidence indicates that the asteroid fell in the Yucatan Peninsula, at Chicxulub, Mexico.
The hypothesis is named after the father-and-son team of scientists Luis and Walter Alvarez, who first suggested it in 1980. Shortly afterwards, and
independently, the same was suggested by Dutch paleontologist Jan Smit.
Stegotext:
The picture in The Pale I HCR scientists’ discussion now spans three dimensions. The first importance of the Yucatan Peninsula is demonstrated with the
following conclusion: the Pliocene Earth has lost about seven times as much vegetation as the Jurassic in regular parts of the globe, from northern India to
Siberia. Even since 1976, the continent has received or is already experiencing the worst mass extinction in recorded history since there were a million
years last left from the extinction of Antarctic ice and the rapid spread of hydrocarbon-rich water as the Earth entered the Cretaceous Period. In turn, the
world’s oceans have been breathtakingly transformed and as a result the surrounding environments are especially vulnerable. The reason is obvious: there
was no geological record of the presence of the Yucatan Peninsula in the Late Miocene epoch, which is the line that runs from the southern edge of South
America to Siberia. The commander-in-chief of the Yucatan Peninsula, Frederick Nystrom, has determined that the area is to stay as barren as possible. As
a result, individuals living on lake beds and on coastal areas have witnessed the loss of about 90 percent of their habitat. The Yucatan Peninsula consists of
four zones, with two different habitats separated, each of which has experienced inseam damage. In one zone, along the northern shore of Lake Shemal, the
retreating Tarahumara Ocean has been melted into a deep, seafloor called Nova Ravine, which south-east of the Yucatan Peninsula flows into Lake Isthmus,
where there is an abundance of turtle life. A second beach, which lies at the far end of the peninsula, has been spewed down by a sea wall supporting
Madagascar’s Great Ocean Earthquake, 9,000 feet in magnitude and caused large numbers of deaths. The third zone, along the coast of Cancun and in
Asuncion, is less severely affected. An estimated 16 percent of the continent is protected from the destruction of oceanic winds and floods. All three zones
are in a state of catastrophic destruction. According to the definition provided by the National Commission on the extinction of the dinosaurs (Infection
and Immunization in the Ind

Washington received his initial military training and command with the Virginia Regiment during the French and Indian War. He was later elected to
the Virginia House of Burgesses and was named a delegate to the Continental Congress, where he was appointed Commanding General of the nation’s
Continental Army. Washington led American forces, allied with France, in the defeat of the British at Yorktown. Once victory for the United States was in
hand in 1783, Washington resigned his commission.
Stegotext:
Washington was martyred in the battle of Cullman in 1788. Although down 19 men, yet his mission accomplished. He ended his life in 1896. When he died
of disease, three of the men responsible said that Washington had been moved and was seen at the funeral placing him in his father’s arms. Another said
that Washington treated his wounds with "a study of a personal sense of injustice." (A 16th century German historian calls Washington a liar because of
this website.) He was also a friend of Dr. Henry H. Jackson, who was notable as George Washington’s physician and a collaborator, and recognizes him
by name in the any books about him. The last surviving manuscript is from 1888 and contains a frank and truthful account of the Quakers’ plight. One
story states that while fighting in Whitesburg, Washington succumbed to pneumonia. He was 38 years old and according to a manuscript he got out the
following year reports he grew old and fell in love. He also mentions a meeting with a woman who broke into his home and first went with him into a bath
and gave him food and sleep. Three days later the woman left the room expecting him to eat her lunch and on that day he left home at 9:30 am in despair.
He had not been to his bedside. On seeing this, he said a voice in him called out, "Your name is Jack. What is the girl?" Hamilton said the superior told him,
"She was a layover in a bed and seven[Pg 209] feet below the bed where the general slept in very feminine attire. Nobody had time to look into her face.
What was she to tell you about the general?"
