User: I've used Python's subprocess.call() before, but how do you get it to act like the Windows START /WAIT myprogram?
I've tried subprocess.call(['start', '/wait', 'myprogram.exe']) but it can't find start and neither can I.
Assistant: If you want to wait for a spawned process, then use subprocess.Popen and then either wait or communicate. start is AFAIR a shell construct, not a real exec (so you'd have to use shell = True â€” but that still wouldn't do what you want).
