#### Operator Recommendations
1. **Handoff Configuration Limits**: In A3 and A5, configurations allowing more than 20 options (see §4.1) can prevent or delay handoffs, thereby impeding performance. Operators should ensure that these configurations do not exceed the recommended limits to avoid such issues.
   
2. **Idle-State Handoff Configurations**: Operators should carefully check measurement and decision parameters with nontrivial gaps for idle-state handoff configurations (see §4.2). These settings can lead to either premature measurements or delayed handoff decisions, which may unnecessarily drain the battery of mobile devices.

3. **Priority Settings**: Operators should meticulously review their priority settings. Our study has identified several instances where 4G access was lost despite the availability of local 4G cells due to improper priority settings by operators. When performing infrastructure upgrades or reconfiguring parameters, operators should consider the impact on both updated and non-updated cells (e.g., neighboring cells, see §5.4.2).

4. **Troubleshooting User Complaints**: Operators should take configuration settings into account when troubleshooting user complaints about poor performance. This will help in identifying and resolving issues related to handoff configurations more effectively.

#### Device-Side Improvements for Users
Our study suggests that mobile users can benefit from device-side improvements in two key areas:

1. **Runtime Handoff Prediction**: Given observable configurations, it is feasible to predict handoffs at runtime on the mobile device. Using our tool, mobile devices can collect runtime configuration parameters and use them along with real-time measurements to forecast whether and how a handoff will occur in the near future. Such predictions can be highly accurate, given the common handoff policies in use. Accurate predictions provide reliable heuristics to optimize TCP and application performance over cellular networks.

2. **Detection and Mitigation of Improper Configurations**: Mobile devices can detect improper configurations using the information collected from handoff configurations. They can leverage their capabilities to eliminate or mitigate negative impacts, such as reducing unnecessary measurements, triggering timely handoffs, and relaxing strict requirements on radio signal quality.

#### Automated Tool for Configuration Verification
For the research community, our study provides insights into how operators manage handoffs and design their policies. However, several research issues remain. Given the sheer scale of cells and configuration settings, an automated solution for configuration verification is a viable approach. Our study sheds light on how to design such an automated tool. We believe that such a tool is feasible if we leverage runtime configurations collected from the device, formal models for handoffs specified by 3GPP standards, verification techniques borrowed from programming language and AI communities, and learning algorithms adapted from machine learning and AI communities. Additionally, such configuration checks can facilitate a cross-layer study spanning the low-level cellular protocol stack to the higher-level TCP/IP suite.

#### Goals for Policy-Based Handoffs
Policy-based handoffs are not solely for performance. As seen in the Internet BGP case, policy design is often influenced by nontechnical factors. However, handoffs in cellular networks are primarily for single-carrier networks without crossing administrative domains. They serve diverse and sometimes conflicting goals, such as selecting the best radio signal quality, boosting high-speed access, sustaining seamless data/voice support, balancing loads, and lowering operational costs. Note that not all configurations are exposed to us. The observed configurations are mainly based on radio signal evaluation tuned by cell priorities. Our study shows that it might be viable to first examine policies on radio signal quality and then extend to non-radio components. By relaxing radio signal requirements (see A5 examples in §4.1) and comparing with other configurations, we can infer how handoff policies vary, reason about the expected impacts of such changes, and learn the handoff policies.

#### Impact of Handoff Configurations
1. **Realization of Policies and Goals**: From configurations, we can determine under what conditions a handoff will occur, which cell it will go to, and the required time and overhead. Our measurements (see §4.2) show that reducing the threshold from 62dB to 42dB can affect intra-freq and non-intra-freq measurements. Through large-scale learning, we can quantify performance impacts and examine whether they induce unnecessary performance penalties.

2. **Unexpected Troubles**: Handoffs are inherently distributed operations. While single-cell configurations are well-justified, there is no guarantee of no conflicts among multiple cells. Our prior studies [22, 27] have shown that misconfigurations can compromise the structural properties of stability and reachability. This study reveals rich diversity, which is prone to configuration conflicts and misconfigurations.

#### Implications for 5G
The findings from this study are likely applicable to 5G. 5G will continue to use policy-based handoff management, and with the adoption of new radio access technology and support for extremely high speeds (e.g., at aircrafts), even more configuration options will be employed.

#### Related Work
There is no existing work that characterizes real-world handoff configurations and investigates their implications, except for our preliminary studies [22, 24, 27]. Our prior results have disclosed problems of handoff instability [22, 24] and unreachability [27] due to misconfigurations or conflicting configurations. These studies conduct theoretical analysis to prove the existence and conditions of unstable handoffs or unreachable cells, validate the possibilities in real-world scenarios using a small dataset, and assess their performance impacts. This measurement study, motivated by these findings, focuses on characterizing configurations at a much larger global scale (30 carriers, 31,000+ cells) and assesses the impacts of normal configurations on handoff quality and user performance.

#### Conclusion
In this work, we conducted a significant measurement study on policy-based handoff configurations from 30 mobile carriers in the US and globally. We designed a new device-centric tool, MMLab, to collect runtime handoff configurations without operator assistance. Our analysis revealed three main points: 1) Extremely complex and diverse configurations are deployed by operators in reality. 2) The setting of handoff configuration values affects data performance and user experience when moving. 3) Such diverse configurations can lead to unexpected negative compound effects on performance and efficiency. Our study provides insights for operators, mobile users, and the research community to refine handoff management in 4G/5G systems, which are the only large-scale networks with ubiquitous mobility support.
