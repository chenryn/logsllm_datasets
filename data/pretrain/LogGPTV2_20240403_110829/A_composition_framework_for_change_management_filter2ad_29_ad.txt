1.2  Recommended Practices
The  following  recommended  practices  will  help  ensure  that  OCM 
institutionalized and has the appropriate support in the organization.
is
Begin OCM Efforts Early
According to industry best practices, beginning OCM efforts early in a project’s 
lifecycle  is  critical  to  the  project’s  success.  Early  OCM  activities  will  enable 
smoother transitions as well as earlier leadership, employee, and Stakeholder 
buy-in  to  the  change.  In  addition,  acceptance  of  change  is  a  process  that 
individuals move through at different paces. Starting OCM efforts early allows 
more  time  for  Stakeholders  to  become  aware  of  the  change  and  embrace 
change efforts.
The Right Project Sponsor is Critical to Project Success
A Project Sponsor is important to have in place at the start of a project. For 
a project to be successful, it should have an executive who can champion the 
project  and  push  for  project  investment,  executive  support,  and,  ultimately, 
approval  to  proceed.  Too  often  the  Project  Sponsor  becomes  less  involved 
once the project has been approved; however, it is critical to keep the Project 
Sponsor  actively  engaged  throughout  the  entire  OCM  lifecycle,  as  his/her 
involvement helps drive the project. It is also beneficial if the Project Sponsor 
has strong support from other managers as they help to reinforce the project 
and are able to communicate more easily with necessary staff at all levels who 
may be involved within the effort.

Figure 2-1
The  goal  of  OCM  Lifecycle  Management  is  to  ensure  the  performance  of  the 
OCM effort, as shown in Figure 2-1. The OCM Practitioner begins OCM Lifecycle 
Management efforts in the Concept Process Phase by defining the magnitude of 
the proposed change. This activity will serve as a foundational component and 
help to guide activity planning, defining OCM priorities and focus areas, and 
managing all OCM efforts.
During  the  Concept  Process  Phase,  OCM  Lifecycle  Management  focuses  on 
defining the magnitude of the change initiative and identifying people-related 
priorities. Activities in this phase guide the direction of the change effort and 
help  the  OCM  Practitioner  tailor  people-related  activities  and  tasks  to  the 
specific needs of the organization and its people.
Figure 2-2 summarizes the inputs, roles, skills, activities, tools, and outputs for 
OCM Lifecycle Management within the Concept Process Phase.

2.1.1 Inputs
In order to complete the Concept Process Phase OCM Lifecycle Management 
activities,  the  OCM  Practitioner  will  need  a  thorough  understanding  of  the 
following inputs:
Business Need: The business need serves as the justification for the project and 
guides its direction. The OCM Practitioner should have a clear understanding of 
the business need or problem in order to begin planning for the change.
Organization Chart: The organization chart provides an accurate representation 
of the organization, its groups, and its people. It demonstrates the organization’s 
structure and potential impacts of the change.

2.1.3 Activities
OCM  Lifecycle  Management  contains  one  activity  in  the  Concept  Process 
Phase.  This  activity  serves  to  determine  the  relative  size  of  change  and  the 
organization’s level of readiness. These two factors contribute to defining the 
magnitude of the change.
Define the Magnitude of the Change
Defining the magnitude of the change helps provide a level of understanding for 
determining the OCM focus and level of effort. The OCM Practitioner will need to 
complete three key tasks:
1.  Define the relative size of the change
2.  Determine the organization’s level of readiness
3. 
Identify the magnitude of change
These tasks will guide the direction of subsequent activities within OCM Lifecycle 
Management and all other OCM knowledge areas. These tasks are important to 
successfully planning and executing the OCM effort.
Define the Relative Size of the Change
It is important to understand the potential impact the conceived project will 
have on an organization or multiple organizations. To understand the relative 
size of the change, the OCM Practitioner should have a general understanding 
of the size of the impact that the project will have on the organization(s). The 
OCM  Practitioner  will  use  their  organizational  knowledge  and  judgment  and 
make an assessment of the size of change based on the following questions:
Question
Size of Change
1. 
Is it likely that the change 
initiative impacts multiple 
organizations (i.e., multiple 
departments, agencies,  
or commissions)?
If yes, the change is considered 
large due to the coordination and 
complexities of multiple impacted 
organizations. 
If no, proceed to question 2.
Skills
Use the following skills to 
complete the activity:
•  Interviewing
•  Facilitation
•  Analysis

Question
Size of Change
2. 
Is it likely that the change 
initiative impacts multiple 
divisions or programs 
within an organization? 
(Divisions or programs are 
the macro organizational 
units of a department/
agency/commission).
3. 
Is it likely that the change 
initiative is isolated to one 
division or program?
If yes, the change is considered 
large due to the coordination and 
complexities of multiple impacted 
divisions and/or programs.
If no, proceed to question 3.
If yes, determine the change by 
dividing the number of employees 
affected by the total number of 
employees in the division or program. 
If the change affects 0-50% of 
employees, the change is small. If 
the number is 51-100%, the change is 
large.
Once the size of the change has been determined, the OCM Practitioner should 
document this in the Change Magnitude Assessment.
Determine the Organization’s Level of Readiness
The  OCM  Practitioner  will  also  need  to  recognize  the  organization’s  overall 
environmental readiness level. The Environmental Readiness Assessment is a tool 
used by the OCM Practitioner to analyze the organization’s readiness for change 
and identify the areas of greatest concern for the change effort, also known as the 
OCM priority areas. This assessment is separated into four environmental areas:

Organizational Change Management Framework
OCM Lifecycle Management
Each area contains different statements that the OCM Practitioner will assess 
on a scale from 1 - “strongly disagree” to 5 - “strongly agree.” The statements 
cover a wide range of topics including: employee and leadership engagement, 
IT support, and overall risk tolerance. Analyzing the environment in this way 
enables  the  OCM  Practitioner  to  determine  the  OCM  priority  areas  going 
forward, such as those areas that the OCM Practitioner scored the lowest.
The  Environmental  Readiness  Assessment  is  intended  to  be  completed  and 
reviewed  by  the  OCM  Practitioner,  with  input  from  the  Project  Sponsor  and 
other  Stakeholders  as  needed.  The  OCM  Practitioner  should  supplement 
feedback from the Project Sponsor and other Stakeholders with knowledge of 
the business need, organization chart, and documentation of current and prior 
change initiatives in order to provide the most accurate picture of environmental 
readiness.  The  following  are  sample  statements  from  the  Environmental 
Readiness Assessment:
•  The project is a top priority for the organization
• 
Leadership is timely and effective in decision making
•  Employees are highly engaged and motivated
•  This project will have access to the talent/resources necessary
The  assessment  should  be  completed  thoughtfully  in  order  to  provide  the 
information  necessary  to  plan  and  tailor  downstream  OCM  efforts.  Once 
completed, the OCM Practitioner identifies the organization’s overall level of 
readiness, based on the following scoring guide:
Score
85 – 140
28 – 84
Level of Readiness
High
Low
The OCM Practitioner will record the OCM priority areas and the overall level of 
readiness in the Change Magnitude Assessment.
Inputs
The following are inputs  
to the activity:
•  Business need
•  Organization chart
•  Documentation of current 
& prior change initiatives

Identify the Magnitude of Change
Once the OCM Practitioner has identified the relative size of the change and the 
overall environmental readiness level, he/she completes the Change Magnitude 
Assessment by plotting the results to determine the overall change magnitude. 
This assessment will be an input for future planning activities to scope the OCM 
level of effort required for the project.
Figure 2-3 demonstrates how the size of change and level of readiness relate. 
An initiative with a small relative size of change and a high level of readiness 
(readiness  score  of  86-140)  will  require  less  OCM  effort  than  a  change  in  an 
organization with a large relative size of change and a low level of readiness 
(readiness score of 28-85).
While the Change Magnitude Assessment provides a general idea of the OCM 
efforts  needed,  it  is  important  to  note  that  all  organizations  and  change 
initiatives are different. This assessment should be used in conjunction with the 
OCM Practitioner’s knowledge of OCM and information about the change and 
the organization.
