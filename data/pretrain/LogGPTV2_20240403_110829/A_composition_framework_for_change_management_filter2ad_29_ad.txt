**Recommended Practices:**

1. **Review Recommended Practices at the Start of the Process Phase:**
   - The following recommended practices will help ensure that OCM is institutionalized and has the appropriate support in the organization.

2. **Begin OCM Efforts Early:**
   - According to industry best practices, starting OCM efforts early in a project’s lifecycle is critical to the project’s success. Early OCM activities enable smoother transitions and earlier buy-in from leadership, employees, and stakeholders. Acceptance of change is a process that individuals move through at different paces. Starting OCM efforts early allows more time for stakeholders to become aware of the change and embrace it.

3. **The Right Project Sponsor is Critical to Project Success:**
   - A Project Sponsor is essential at the start of a project. For a project to be successful, it should have an executive who can champion the project, push for investment, executive support, and ultimately, approval to proceed. It is crucial to keep the Project Sponsor actively engaged throughout the entire OCM lifecycle, as their involvement drives the project. Additionally, strong support from other managers helps reinforce the project and facilitates communication with staff at all levels involved in the effort.

**OCM Lifecycle Management:**

**2.1 OCM Lifecycle Management:**

- **Understand the Magnitude of Change:**
  - **Initiating:**
    - Schedule Initiating Activities
  - **Planning:**
    - Schedule Planning Activities
  - **Executing:**
    - Schedule Executing Activities
  - **Closing:**
    - Close OCM Effort

**Ensure the Performance of the OCM Effort:**

- The goal of OCM Lifecycle Management is to ensure the performance of the OCM effort, as shown in Figure 2-1. The OCM Practitioner begins by defining the magnitude of the proposed change, which serves as a foundational component and guides activity planning, defining OCM priorities, and managing all OCM efforts.
- During the Concept Process Phase, OCM Lifecycle Management focuses on defining the magnitude of the change initiative and identifying people-related priorities. These activities guide the direction of the change effort and help the OCM Practitioner tailor people-related activities and tasks to the specific needs of the organization and its people.

**OCM Lifecycle Management:**

**2.1.3 Activities:**

- **Define the Magnitude of the Change:**
  - This activity determines the relative size of the change and the organization’s level of readiness, contributing to the definition of the magnitude of the change.
  - **Tasks:**
    1. Define the relative size of the change.
    2. Determine the organization’s level of readiness.
    3. Identify the magnitude of change.

**Define the Relative Size of the Change:**
- Understanding the potential impact of the project on the organization(s) is crucial. The OCM Practitioner should assess the size of the change based on the following questions:
  - **Question 1:** Is it likely that the change initiative impacts multiple organizations (i.e., multiple departments, agencies, or commissions)?
    - If yes, the change is considered large due to the coordination and complexities of multiple impacted organizations.
    - If no, proceed to Question 2.
  - **Question 2:** Is it likely that the change initiative impacts multiple divisions or programs within an organization?
    - If yes, the change is considered large due to the coordination and complexities of multiple impacted divisions and/or programs.
    - If no, proceed to Question 3.
  - **Question 3:** Is it likely that the change initiative is isolated to one division or program?
    - If yes, determine the change by dividing the number of employees affected by the total number of employees in the division or program. If the change affects 0-50% of employees, the change is small. If the number is 51-100%, the change is large.

**Skills:**
- Interviewing
- Facilitation
- Analysis

**Determine the Organization’s Level of Readiness:**
- The OCM Practitioner uses the Environmental Readiness Assessment to analyze the organization’s readiness for change and identify the areas of greatest concern, known as OCM priority areas. This assessment is divided into four environmental areas:
  1. Organizational Readiness
  2. Leadership Readiness
  3. Employee Readiness
  4. Supporting Infrastructure Readiness

- Each area contains statements assessed on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The OCM Practitioner completes and reviews the assessment with input from the Project Sponsor and other Stakeholders. Sample statements include:
  - The project is a top priority for the organization.
  - Leadership is timely and effective in decision making.
  - Employees are highly engaged and motivated.
  - This project will have access to the talent/resources necessary.

- The assessment should be completed thoughtfully to plan and tailor downstream OCM efforts. The OCM Practitioner identifies the organization’s overall level of readiness based on the following scoring guide:
  - **Score 85 – 140:** High Readiness
  - **Score 28 – 84:** Low Readiness

- The OCM Practitioner records the OCM priority areas and the overall level of readiness in the Change Magnitude Assessment.

**Identify the Magnitude of Change:**
- After determining the relative size of the change and the overall environmental readiness level, the OCM Practitioner completes the Change Magnitude Assessment by plotting the results to determine the overall change magnitude. This assessment will be an input for future planning activities to scope the OCM level of effort required for the project.

**Figure 2-3: Relationship Between Size of Change and Level of Readiness**

- An initiative with a small relative size of change and a high level of readiness (readiness score of 86-140) will require less OCM effort than a change in an organization with a large relative size of change and a low level of readiness (readiness score of 28-85).
- While the Change Magnitude Assessment provides a general idea of the OCM efforts needed, it is important to note that all organizations and change initiatives are different. This assessment should be used in conjunction with the OCM Practitioner’s knowledge of OCM and information about the change and the organization.

**Tools:**
- Environmental Readiness Assessment Template
- Change Magnitude Assessment Template

**Outputs:**
- Completed Environmental Readiness Assessment
- Completed Change Magnitude Assessment

**Figure 2-3: Change Magnitude and Readiness Levels**

- **Large Change, High Readiness:** Moderate OCM Effort
- **Large Change, Low Readiness:** Significant OCM Effort
- **Small Change, High Readiness:** Small OCM Effort
- **Small Change, Low Readiness:** Moderate OCM Effort

**Level of Readiness:**
- High
- Low
