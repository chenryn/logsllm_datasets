Question: "A system architect is designing a new embedded system. To simplify the code and improve execution speed, they propose hard-coding the addresses of frequently used functions into the system's firmware. As a security consultant, you are tasked with evaluating this design decision. What arguments could you put forward against using fixed memory addresses for function pointers in the system's firmware?"
 "A": "Hard-coding addresses can make the system's firmware more efficient by reducing lookup times."
 "B": "Using fixed addresses in firmware may result in incompatibility with future hardware revisions or different models."
 "C": "Fixed addresses simplify the debugging process by providing a consistent reference for error reporting."
 "D": "Assigning static addresses in firmware could be exploited by attackers to execute arbitrary code if they gain access to those memory locations."
