I installed Hyde using `pip`, and I can see the installation in `/usr/local/share/python`. However, when I try to run `hyde` from the command line, I receive the error: "Bash: Command not found."

I am using Mac OS X (Mountain Lion) and Python 2.7.3.

Could you please help me resolve this issue?

**Additional Information:**
I believe I need to add `/usr/local/share/python` to my `PATH`.
