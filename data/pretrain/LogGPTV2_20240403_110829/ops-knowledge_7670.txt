User: I am trying to install PIP for Python3, but no matter what I try at some point I always end up with:
E: Sub-pricess /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code(1)
E: Failed to process build dependencies.
I tried with :

python get-pip.py from the official PIP page.
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
sudo apt-get build-dep python3.4

I have the version of PIP for python2.7, so that's why I ran the latest command. Can someone help me out please ?
Assistant: You can try this.

sudo mv /var/lib/dpkg/info /var/lib/dpkg/info.bak 
sudo mkdir /var/lib/dpkg/info 
sudo apt-get update

Hope it can help you(and others).
