User: I have read the python document about subprocesses, but the argument preexec_fn for subprocess.Popen can only point to a function with no argument.
Now I want to call a function with two arguments just like what preexec_fn does, I've tried to use global variables, but it doesn't work.
How can I do that?
Assistant: if your target function is simple enough, you may want to try anonymous functions ("lambda function"). And, you can place this lambda function as it is or, as a function object (ex)f=lambda x,y: x+y and, no need to use partial nor importing "functools" package. (btw, if you want to use only partial, you can also clean up as 'from functools import partial' and directly use partial as your local function. 
<example with anonymous function>
 import subprocess
 subprocess.Popen(<cmd>, preexec_fn=(lambda x,y:x+y))
