Assistant: You can use the following methods to monitor the running status of docker containers: 1. Use the docker ps command to view the list of running containers, including container ID, name, image, status, port mapping and other information. ``` docker ps ``` 2. Use the docker stats command to view the resource usage of the container, including CPU, memory, network, disk and other information. ``` docker stats <container_id> ``` 3. Use the docker logs command to view the log information of the container, including container startup, running, and exit information. ``` docker logs <container_id> ``` 4. Use the docker inspect command to view the detailed information of the container, including container configuration, network, and mounted volumes. ``` docker inspect <container_id> ``` 5. Using third-party monitoring tools, such as cAdvisor, Prometheus, Grafana, etc., can monitor the running status, resource usage, logs and other information of the container in real time, and provide a visual monitoring interface.
