It's really awesome that you now host a official Debian package for atom,
however, there is one area for improvement, updating. Currently, you have to
check the website for updates and then go to the atom website to download the
new Debian package. This is ignoring one of the most useful parts of the
debian packaging system, the updater. On Debian, packages are updated (almost)
automatically via PPA's (Personal Package Archives) which are hosted for free
by Ubuntu at launchpad.net or packages repositories, which you need to host
yourself.
A PPA is probably the easiest solution. All you would have to do is upload the
Debian package to launchapd.net whenever you upload it to atom's website.
Google Chrome also does this nifty thing that is really useful and I think
atom should implement as well. You download the Debian package from the Google
Chrome website, and the Debian installer automatically adds the package
repository to the users system for updates in the future.
If you have any more questions or need help setting this up I'm happy to help.
It's free, requires almost no work on your part to set up and maintain, and
improves the updating experience on Linux by a lot. Thanks! ðŸ˜„
