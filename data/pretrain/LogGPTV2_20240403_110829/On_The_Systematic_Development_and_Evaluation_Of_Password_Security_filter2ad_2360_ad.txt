cic password-related behaviour in dierent information security
scenarios is secure or insecure and (b) the security of passwords. In
particular, these abilities are retained or even improved six months
after reading through the awareness-raising material. At the same
time, the awareness-raising material was received positively by all
participants.
The results of our study also point out areas for future work.
The participating employees expressed the desire to learn more
about password managers and the composition of secure passwords.
Thus, it might be warranted to create additional awareness-raising
materials for these topics. Also, it might be worthwhile to investi-
gate how to make the transition towards using a password manager
easier for users. Beyond the scope of password security, the iter-
ative process used to systematically create the awareness-raising
material presented in this work could easily be applied to other
information security contexts.

APPENDIX A: DESCRIPTION OF THE
AWARENESS-RAISING MATERIAL
The awareness-raising material ensures understandability for lay-
users by preventing technical terms, using simple language and
employing a wide range of examples. Due to space constraints it
is not possible to reproduce the full awareness-raising material
while retaining these measures. We can provide only a high-level
summary. However, the improved version of the awareness-raising
material can be freely accessed online2.
Accounting for the domain-knowledge of the readership of this
article, more technical terms are used in describing the content
of the awareness-raising material while also forgoing most of the
examples for the sake of brevity. The remainder of this section
reproduces the general structure of the awareness-raising material
and provides a short description of each section.
A.1 Introductory Sections
The awareness-raising material includes two introductory sections.
They give the users a short overview of (1) who might attack them
and where attacks can be targeted at and (2) the possible conse-
quences of successful attacks.
A.1.1 Possible Aackers. This section provides an overview of
possible attackers, including criminal hackers, social engineers at-
tempting to gain entry to a business facility, insider threats, spouses
and acquaintances, as well as employees of IT-service providers.
Next, it is explained where such attackers target their attacks, i.e.
the user itself, end devices, interactions with end devices, com-
munications between end-devices and services as well as only at
services.
A.1.2 Possible Consequences of Successful Aacks. Here, the
goals of attackers are discussed, thereby addressing the third rec-
ommendation of Tsohou et al. [30], i.e. emphasising consequences.
However, we carefully balanced this recommendation with their

Peter Mayer, Christian Schwartz, and Melanie Volkamer
rst recommendation, focusing in our awareness-material on the
positive phrasing instead of risk and fear. The user is informed that
the primary goal of an attacker is not necessarily obtaining access
to a user’s account. Rather, attackers are interested in manipulating
an account for their specic gains. Examples include accessing the
victims email account in order to send phishing emails to the user’s
contacts, accessing cloud storage in order to blackmail the user, and
accessing the users bank account in order to withdraw funds.
A.2 Attacks
This section explains the dierent types of attacks. The description
of each attack comprises three parts: a general description of the
attack, a description of the defences, and (where necessary) further
hints which are only relevant for few users (e.g. hints for specic
software).
A.2.1 Aack: Fraudulent messages.
Description of Attack. The attacker sends a message encouraging
the victim to either provide user credentials, follow a link to a
malicious website or open a malicious attachment.
Description of Defences. Participants are encouraged to delete
messages identied as dangerous, verify both the sender as well as
the content regarding plausibility and analyse links and attachments
regarding whether they potentially represent a danger. Further,
the participant is referred to specic training material concerning
fraudulent messages [22].
Further Hints on the Attack. Interested participants are provided
with a link to a video explaining further details regarding fraudulent
messages [34]. The interested reader can nd the video online3.
A.2.2 Aack: The of an insecurely stored note of the password.
Description of Attack. Attackers attempt to obtain credentials
stored physically in an insecure manner (e.g. a post-it under the
keyboard).
Description of Defences. Physical copies of passwords should be
stored securely.
Further Hints on the Attack. The participant is informed that
passwords transmitted via snail-mail are also subject to attack,
since they also represent a note of the password. Users should
be weary when passwords delivered via mail arrive in a damaged
envelope. In such cases they should be invalidated resent.
A.2.3 Aack: Shoulder-Surfing.
Description of Attack. The attacker watches the user entering his
or her passwords or unlock gestures either in person or via tools
such as cameras or infrared cameras.
Description of Defences. Participants are encouraged to ensure
that no third party can watch them while entering credentials.
Additionally, this risk can be mitigated by employing privacy lters
and cleaning touch screens.
3https://secuso.org/video-online-fraud
A.2.4 Aack: Compromising the user’s devices.
Description of Attack. The attacker attempts to compromise the
users device using malware, allowing the attacker to retrieve all
credentials used on the device. This might be attempted by obtain-
ing access to an unlocked and unobserved device or by tricking
the user into installing it, e.g. by accessing a website containing a
drive-by download. Users of mobile devices should be aware that
even Apps distributed via ocial App Stores may contain malware.
Description of Defences. Participants are encouraged to install
all relevant security patches for their devices, e.g. by enabling au-
tomatic updates, and to consider installing anti-virus software. In
addition, devices should be protected via a password (or an equiv-
alent authentication scheme using tokens or biometrics) and not
be left unattended. Further, full-disc encryption should be enabled.
Users are also advised to not connect external storage media from
unknown sources and to not install software from non-trusted
sources. Mobile devices should not be rooted or jailbroken.
Further Hints on the Attack. The interested participant is pro-
vided with further information regarding the dangers of rooting or
jailbeaking devices.
A.2.5 Aack: Eavesdropping on unencrypted communication.
Description of Attack. Attackers attempt to eavesdrop on unen-
crypted communication in order to obtain user credentials. This
is especially easy if unencrypted WiFi networks are used or the
authentication to a WiFi network occurs via an unencrypted con-
nection. Secondary credentials such as cookies which may be trans-
mitted via unencrypted channels may also be used by attackers to
access services.
Description of Defences. Participants are encouraged to ensure
that web-services are accessed via HTTPS connections and are
provided with identifying features of such connections. Further,
they are encouraged to logout from web-services after use in order
to invalidate secondary credentials.
Further Hints on the Attack. Links to additional information in
the form of videos and articles are provided to the user as well as
browser plug-ins which notify users of unencrypted connections.
A.2.6 Aack: Eavesdropping on encrypted communication.
Description of Attack. Attackers attempt to impersonate remote
services or perform a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept en-
crypted communication between the user and a service. Such at-
tacks render the encryption useless.
Description of Defences. Users are informed about the meaning of
browser warnings for insecure HTTPS connections. It is explained
how to identify low risk warnings (e.g. expired certicates). Partici-
pants are encouraged to attempt to establish a secure connection
from another device in order to verify that the same warning is
shown and contact the remote service if the error persists. Further,
participants are informed to never downgrade the HTTPS protocol
to HTTP as this would remove the encryption.
Further Hints on the Attack. In order to be able to detect relevant
encryption related browser warnings, participants are presented

with screenshots and explanations pertaining to all major current
browsers.
possible. Then, after the emergency-use of the password is nished,
the password should be changed.
A.2.7 Aack: Targeted guessing.
Description of Attack. In this approach attackers attempt to gain
access to one specic user account by attempting to authenticate
using likely passwords associated with the user. Sources for such
passwords are for example social media or other public sources of
information, such as company websites.
Description of Defences. Participants are encouraged to select
passwords which cannot be associated with their person, by not
incorporating information about them which is publicly available.
When passwords are supposed to protect against spouses or close
acquaintances, user are advised to consider what the respective
person could deduce as password guess.
A.2.8 Aack: Untargeed guessing.
Description of Attack. In untargeted guessing scenarios, attack-
ers attempt to obtain credentials for many user accounts at one
specic service in parallel, i.e. trawling attacks [6]. Frequently used
passwords (such as keyboard walks), passwords from past breaches,
and dictionary words of a variety of languages are used as guesses
for all known user accounts at the service under attack. This attack
requires knowledge of valid usernames for the service, which are
often publicly accessible (e.g. on sites where users post content,
such as online forums) or available for purchase on the black market
(e.g. for email services).
Description of Defences. This attack can be prevented by choosing
infrequently used passwords, which also are not related to the
service they are used for.
A.2.9 Aack: Guessing aer a break-in.
Description of Attack. In this attack scenario an attacker has
already compromised a service and obtained the stored credentials.
If the credentials are stored as hashes usually a combination of
brute-force and dictionary attacks are used in this case.
Description of Defences. Defence against this attack is two-part.
First, service operators need to observe security best-practices,
otherwise, all user eorts are in vain [11]. Second, participants are
encouraged to select long passwords, especially for device login,
password manager master-passwords, email account passwords,
and single-sign-on passwords.
Further Hints on the Attack. Re-using passwords for multiple
services increases the likelihoods of success of this attack.
A.2.10 Aack: The of unencrypted digital password notes.
Description of Attack. This attack targets credentials stored un-
encrypted on systems, physical media or in the cloud.
Description of Defences. The user is encouraged to store pass-
words only encrypted, i.e. to use a password manager, in particular
when passwords are synchronised between multiple devices. If
sharing a password is required in an emergency, transmission of
the encrypted password should occur via encrypted channels if
Further Hints on the Attack. Passwords which are sent to the user
unencrypted, e.g. as replacement during a password reset, should
be changed as soon as possible.
A.2.11 Aack: Exploiting a weak reset mechanism.
Description of Attack. This attack attempts to exploit week pass-
word reset mechanisms, allowing an attacker to change an account’s
password to a password known to him or her. This attack allows
attackers to bypass even strong passwords.
Description of Defences. Defence against this attack depends on
the type of password reset mechanism employed by the service. If
password reset is based on the user’s email address, a secure pass-
word for the email account must be ensured. If security questions
are used as reset mechanism, it must be ensured that the answers
to the security questions cannot be guessed. One possible solution
is to treat the answers to security questions as passwords and store
them in a password manager.
