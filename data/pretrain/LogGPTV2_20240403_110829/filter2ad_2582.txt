1.  INTRODUCTION 
The  increased  power  and  interconnectivity  of  computer  systems 
available  today  create  the  ability  to  store  and  process  large 
amounts  of  data,  resulting  in  networked  information  accessible 
from  anywhere  at  any  time.  It  is  becoming  easier  to  collect, 
exchange,  access,  process,  and  link  information.  This  global 
scenario  has  inevitably  resulted  in  an  increasing  degree  of 
awareness with respect to privacy. Privacy issues have been the 
subject of public debates, and the need for privacy-aware policies, 
regulations, and techniques has been widely recognized. The goal 
of this workshop is to discuss the problems of privacy in global 
interconnected societies and possible solutions to them.
