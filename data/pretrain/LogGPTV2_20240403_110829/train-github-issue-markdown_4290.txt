In some cases, you'd like to set up your testing module the same as a larger
module you're exporting, but want to mock out some declarations. Currently
there is no way to _remove_ a declaration though, so you'd have to make a
whole new module and duplicate your list.
e.g., now
    // in lib
    @NgModule({
      declarations: [A, B, C, D, E]
    })
    class MyLibModule {};
    // in test for E, we want to mock out D
    TestBed.configureTestingModule({
      declarations: [A, B, C, MockD, E]
    });
Instead it would be nice to be able to do something like:
    // in test for E
    TestBed.configureTestingModule({
      imports: [MyLibModule],
      remove: [D],
      declarations: [MockD]
    });
