User: How to configure HTTP proxy in Linux? Please describe the configuration steps and considerations.
Assistant: The steps to configure the HTTP proxy are as follows: 1. Open the terminal and execute the following command to set the address and port of the HTTP proxy server: export http_proxy=http://<proxy-server-ip>:<proxy-server-port> For example, if The IP address of the HTTP proxy server is 192.168.0.1, and the port number is 8080, so the command is: export http_proxy=http://192.168.0.1:8080 2. If you need to use FTP proxy, you also need to set the address and port of the FTP proxy server : export ftp_proxy=http://<proxy-server-ip>:<proxy-server-port> For example: export ftp_proxy=http://192.168.0.1:8080 3. To cancel the proxy server setting, execute the following command: unset http_proxy unset ftp_proxy Notes: 1. The address and port of the proxy server need to be set according to the actual situation. 2. After the proxy server is configured, some network applications may not be able to access the Internet normally. If you need to use these applications, you need to cancel the proxy server settings. 3. If you need to use the HTTP proxy server for a long time, you can add the above command to the bashrc file, so that it will be executed automatically every time you open the terminal.
