can be easily made depends on i) whether other domains are hosted
on the same IP address, and ii) the stability of the mapping between
a given domain and its IP address(es).
The probability with which an adversary can successfully infer
the visited domain can be modeled using the k-anonymity property,
with k corresponding to the number of domains co-hosted on the
same IP address. The probability of a successful guess is inversely
proportional to the value of k, i.e., the larger the k, the more difficult
it is for the adversary to make a correct guess, thus providing
increased user privacy.
The above threat model is oblivious to distinguishable charac-
teristics among a group of co-hosted websites, such as popularity
ranking, site sensitivity, and network traffic patterns. We should
thus stress that the situation in practice will be much more favorable
for the adversary. Even for a server with a high k, it is likely that
not all k sites will be equally popular or sensitive. Although the
popularity and sensitivity can vary from site to site, depending on
who, when, and from where is visiting the site [48], an adversary
can still consider the popularity and sensitivity of the particular k
sites hosted on a given IP address to make a more educated guess
about the actual visited site.
Utilizing the ranking information of all domains studied, we
model such an adversarial scenario in §5.3 and show that our threat
model based on k-anonymity is still valid. In addition, page-specific
properties such as the number of connections towards different
third-party servers and the number of transferred bytes per connec-
tion can be used to derive robust web page fingerprints [16, 17, 27,
35, 47, 65, 81, 99], which can improve the accuracy of attribution
even further. Although identifying a visited website among all pos-
sible websites on the Internet by relying solely on fingerprinting is
quite challenging, applying the same fingerprinting approach for
attributing a given connection (and subsequent associated connec-
tions) to one among a set of k well-known websites is a vastly easier
problem.
Consequently, an on-path observer could improve the probability
of correctly inferring the actual visited website by considering the
popularity and sensitivity of the co-hosted domains on the visited
IP address, perhaps combined with a form of traffic fingerprint-
ing. Although such a more powerful attack is outside the scope of
this work, as we show in the rest of the paper, our results already
provide a worrisome insight on how effective an even much less
sophisticated attribution strategy would be, given the current state
of domain co-hosting.
4 METHODOLOGY
In this section we review existing DNS measurement techniques and
highlight the data collection goals of our study. We then describe
how we select domains and vantage points to achieve these goals.
4.1 Existing DNS Measurements
Previous studies use passive measurement to observe DNS traffic on
their networks [30, 94, 100]. However, passive data collection can
suffer from bias depending on the time, location, and demographics
of users within the observed network. Passive data collection can
also raise ethical concerns, as data collected over a long period of
time can gradually reveal online habits of monitored users.
There are also prior works (by both academia and industry)
that conducted large-scale active DNS measurements for several
purposes and made their datasets available to the community [61,
87]. However, these datasets have two common issues that make
them unsuitable to be used directly in our study. First, all DNS
queries are resolved from a single location (country), while we aim
to observe localized IPs delivered by CDNs to users in different
regions. Second, although these datasets have been used in many
other studies, none of the prior measurements are designed to
filter out poisoned DNS responses (e.g., as a result of censorship
leakage), which can significantly affect the accuracy of the results
and negatively impact data analysis if not excluded. We discuss
steps taken to sanitize these datasets in Appendix B.
4.2 Our Measurement Goals
Ideally, we would like to derive the mapping between all live do-
main names and their IP addresses. Unfortunately, this is extremely
challenging to achieve in practice because there are more than 351.8
million second-level domain names registered across all top-level
domains (TLDs) at the time we compose this paper [98], making it
unrealistic to actively resolve all of them with adequate frequency.
Furthermore, not all domains host web content, while many of
them correspond to spam, phishing [80, 85], malware command
and control [8], or parking pages registered during the domain
dropcatching process [63], which most users do not normally visit.
As we aim to study the privacy benefits of ESNI, we thus choose
to focus on active sites that are legitimately visited by the majority
of web users. To derive such a manageable subset of sites, we relied
on lists of website rankings, but did not consider only the most
popular ones, as this would bias our results. Instead, we expanded
our selection to include as many sites as possible, so that we can
keep our measurements manageable, but at the same time observe a
representative subset of legitimately visited domains on the Internet.
4.3 Domains Tested
There are four top lists that are widely used by the research com-
munity: Alexa [7], Majestic [70], Umbrella [97], and Quantcast [84].
However, it is challenging to determine which top list should be
chosen, as recent works have shown that each top list has its own
issues that may significantly affect analysis results if used with-
out some careful considerations [64, 90, 92]. For instance, Alexa
is highly fluctuating, with more than 50% of domain names in the
list changing every day, while Majestic is more stable but cannot
quickly capture sites that suddenly become popular for only a short
period of time. Pochat et al. [64] suggest that researchers should
combine these four lists to generate a reliable ranking.
For this study, we generated our own list by aggregating domains
ranked by Alexa and Majestic from the most recent 30 days for
several reasons. First, these two lists use ranking techniques that are
more difficult and costly to manipulate [64]. Second, they have the
highest number of domains in common among the four. We exclude
domains from Quantcast because it would make our observations
biased towards popular sites only in the US [64]. Lastly, we do
not use domains from Umbrella because the list is vulnerable to
DNS-based manipulation and also contains many domains that do
not host web content [64, 90]. To this end, we studied a total of
13.6M domains with its breakdown shown in Appendix A.
Data scope. Although this subset of domains corresponds to about
4% of all domains in the TLD zone files, we argue that it is still
adequate for the goal of our study, i.e., determining whether the
current state of website co-location will allow ESNI to provide a
meaningful privacy benefit. Considering only this subset of domains
may lead to an under-approximation of the actual k-anonymity
offered by a given IP or set of IPs, as some co-hosted domains may
not be considered. This means that our results can be viewed as a
lower bound of the actual k-anonymity degree for a given visited
IP address, which is still a desirable outcome.
As discussed in §3, the popularity of a website, along with other
qualitative characteristics, can be used by an adversary to improve
attribution. Indeed, given that the long tail of domains that are left
out from our dataset mostly correspond to vastly less popular and
even unwanted or dormant domains [96], any increase in k they
may contribute would in practice be rather insignificant, as (from
an attribution perspective) it is unlikely they will be the ones that
most web users would actually visit.
4.4 Measurement Location and Duration
Due to load balancing and content delivery networks, deriving all
possible IP addresses for a given popular domain is very challenging.
To approximate this domain-to-IP mapping, we performed our own
active DNS measurements from several vantage points acquired
from providers of Virtual Private Servers (VPS). When choosing
measurement locations, we tried to distribute our vantage points
so that their geographical distances are maximized from each other.
This design decision allows us to capture as many localized IP
addresses of CDN-hosted sites as possible. To that end, we run
our measurements from nine countries, including Brazil, Germany,
India, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, United Kingdom, United
States, and South Africa. Our vantage points span the six most
populous continents. From all measurement locations mentioned
above, we send DNS queries for approximately 7.5M domains on a
daily basis. When issuing DNS queries, we enabled the iterative flag
in the queries, bypassing local recursive resolvers to make sure that

addresses host only a single domain.
DNS responses are returned by actual authoritative name servers.
The results presented in this work are based on data collected for a
period of two months, from February 24th to April 25th, 2019.
5 DATA ANALYSIS
In this section we use two metrics, k-anonymity and the dynamics
of hosting IP addresses, to quantify the privacy benefits offered
by different hosting and CDN providers. To verify the validity of
our k-anonymity model, we also apply Zipf’s law on the popular-
ity ranking of domains to account for a more realistic (i.e., more
powerful) adversary.
5.1 Single-hosted vs. Multi-hosted Domains
Over a period of two months, from February 24th to April 25th,
2019, we observed an average of 2.2M and 500K unique IPv4 and
IPv6 addresses, respectively, from our daily measurements. Of these
IP addresses, 70% of IPv4 and 79% of IPv6 addresses host only a
single domain, as shown in Figure 1. This means that visitors of the
websites hosted on those addresses will not gain any meaningful
privacy benefit with ESNI, due to the one-to-one mapping between
the domain name and the IP address on which it is hosted. About
95% of both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses host less than 15 domains.
When calculating the percentage of IPv6-supported sites, we
find that less than 15% support IPv6. Regardless of the increasing
trend [28], the future adoption of IPv6 is still unclear [25]. Since
the majority of web traffic is still being carried through IPv4, in the
rest of the paper we focus only on IPv4 addresses.
Based on our measurements, we identify three main ways in
which a domain may be hosted, in terms of the IP addresses used and
the potential privacy benefit due to ESNI, as illustrated in Figure 2.
In the simplest case, a single-hosted domain may be exclusively
hosted on one or more IP addresses that do not serve any other
domain, to which we refer as privacy-detrimental IP addresses (Fig. 2,
left). As there is no sharing of the IP address(es) with other domains,
an adversary can trivially learn which site is visited based solely
on the destination IP address. On the other hand, a multi-hosted

domain (Fig. 2, right) may be co-hosted on one or more IP addresses
that always serve at least one or more other domains, to which
we refer as privacy-beneficial IP addresses. Since the destination IP
address always hosts multiple domains, an adversary can only make
a (possibly educated) guess about the actual domain a given user
visits, and thus multi-hosted domains always benefit to some extent
from ESNI—the more co-hosted domains on a given IP address, the
higher the privacy gain offered by ESNI.

than 100K are not statistically significant, as confirmed by both
top list providers and recent studies [6, 90]. Figure 3 shows that
single-hosted and multi-hosted domains exhibit a nearly identical
distribution of popularity rankings.
5.2 Estimating the Privacy Benefit of
Multi-hosted Domains
In this section, we focus on the 81% of multi-hosted domains that
can benefit from ESNI, and attempt to assess their actual privacy
gain. Recall that a website can gain some privacy benefit only if it is
co-hosted with other websites, in which case an on-path adversary
will not know which among all co-hosted websites is actually being
visited. We use k-anonymity to model and quantify the privacy
gain of multi-hosted domains.
Going back to Figure 2, we can apply this definition in two ways,
depending on whether we focus on IP addresses or domains. For a
given IP address, its k-anonymity value (“k” for brevity) corresponds
to the number of co-hosted domains. For a given multi-hosted
domain, its k may be different across the individual IP addresses
on which it is hosted, as the number of co-hosted domains on each
Finally, there is a chance that a domain is hosted on a mix of
privacy-detrimental and privacy-beneficial IP addresses, which we
call partially multi-hosted domains (Fig. 2, middle). In that case, only
visitors to the subset of IP addresses that co-host other domains
will benefit from ESNI. Based on our measurements, partially multi-
hosted domains correspond to only a 0.3% fraction (20K) of all
domains (daily average). Single-hosted domains comprise 18.7%
(1.4M) and multi-hosted domains comprise 81% (6M) of all domains.
The privacy degree of a partially multi-hosted domain depends
on the probability that a visitor gets routed to a privacy-beneficial
IP of that domain. In other words, a partially multi-hosted domain
will mostly behave as a multi-hosted domain if the majority of its IP
addresses are privacy-beneficial. In fact, we find that this is the case
for more than 92.5% of the partially multi-hosted domains studied.
Based on this fact, and given its extremely small number compared
to the other two types, in the rest of our paper we merge partially
multi-hosted domains with the actual multi-hosted domains, to
simplify the presentation of our results.
Going back to Figure 1, based on the above breakdown, we
observe that 70% of all IP addresses that host a single domain cor-
respond to 18.7% of all domains, i.e., the single-hosted ones. On the
other hand, the 81% of multi-hosted domains are co-hosted on just
30% of the IP addresses observed.
Next, we analyze the popularity distribution of single-hosted
and multi-hosted domains to identify any difference in the user
population of these two types of domains. Note that we only base
our analysis on the ranking information provided by the top lists
to comparatively estimate the scale of the user base, and not for
absolute ranking purposes. More specifically, we only use the top
100K domains for the analysis in Figure 3, since rankings lower
