### Issue Type:
Bug

### Ansible Version:
This issue has been observed in the `HEAD` version, as well as in versions 1.5.2 and 1.5.3. According to discussions on IRC, this problem has existed for some time.

### Environment:
- Deployment OS: macOS Mavericks
- Target Servers: Debian 7

### Summary:
When using child groups to override variables, the variable from the parent group is used instead of the one defined in the child group. Although this bug is not explicitly described in pull request #6379, it was resolved by that PR. I tested the PR after merging it with the 1.5.3 branch.

### Steps to Reproduce:
Below is a small example snippet (I can provide full files if needed).

#### Inventory File:
```ini
[devproxyservers]
10.0.40.83
10.0.40.84

[proxyservers:children]
devproxyservers
```

#### Group Variables for `proxyservers`:
```yaml
cert_path: "{{ base_dir }}/certs/{{ cert_name }}"
key_path: "{{ base_dir }}/certs/{{ key_name }}"
```

#### Group Variables for `devproxyservers`:
```yaml
cert_path: "{{ base_dir }}/certs/fake_cert.crt"
key_path: "{{ base_dir }}/certs/fake_key.key"
```

### Expected Results:
According to the documentation at [Variable Precedence](http://docs.ansible.com/playbooks_variables.html#variable-precedence-where-should-i-put-a-variable), the variables defined in the child group (`devproxyservers`) should be used.

### Actual Results:
The variables from the `proxyservers` group are used instead of those from the `devproxyservers` group.
