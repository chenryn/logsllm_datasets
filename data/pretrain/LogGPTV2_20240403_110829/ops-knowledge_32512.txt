It seems you are encountering an issue while trying to activate your virtual environment on a Windows system. The `source` command is specific to Unix-like systems (such as Linux and macOS) and will not work in a Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell. Hereâ€™s how you can correctly activate your virtual environment on Windows:

1. **Navigate to the Directory:**
   Open your Command Prompt or PowerShell and navigate to the directory where your virtual environment is located. For example:
   ```sh
   cd C:\testdjangoproj\mysite
   ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   On Windows, you should use the `activate` script located in the `Scripts` directory of your virtual environment. Run the following command:
   ```sh
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

Here is a step-by-step example based on your provided commands:

```sh
# Navigate to the project directory
cd C:\testdjangoproj\mysite

# Create the virtual environment (if not already created)
virtualenv --no-site-packages venv
# Note: The --no-site-packages flag is deprecated and is now the default behavior.

# Activate the virtual environment
venv\Scripts\activate
```

If you follow these steps, your virtual environment should be activated successfully. You will see the name of the virtual environment (in this case, `venv`) prefixed to your command prompt, indicating that it is active.

### Additional Notes:
- **Python Version:** You mentioned Python 7, which does not exist. The latest stable version as of my last update is Python 3.9. Please ensure you are using a valid Python version.
- **Virtualenv Version:** You mentioned virtualenv 2.2.x, which is quite old. Consider upgrading to the latest version of virtualenv for better compatibility and features.

To upgrade virtualenv, you can use pip:
```sh
pip install --upgrade virtualenv
```
