I've seen this with **coffee-loader** and **cjsx-loader** , but #1249 also
reports this problem with **jsx-loader**. The problem seems to appear when we
require the same file from outside a module and from within the module:
`a.coffee` (within module `bb`):
    module.exports = {just: 'an object'}
`b.coffee` (within module `bb`):
    module.exports = require './a'
`odd.coffee`:
    a = require('bb/a');
    b = require('bb/b');
    console.log a is b  # should be true
When you run `coffee odd.coffee`, sure enough, you get: `true`.  
But when you run it through Webpack (with coffee-loader):
  * You get module `a` bundled twice:
        [0] ./odd.coffee 94 bytes {0}
        [1] /Users/guillermo/Docs/Docs.Prog/JavaScript/bb/a.coffee 56 bytes {0} [built]
        [2] /Users/guillermo/Docs/Docs.Prog/JavaScript/bb/b.coffee 59 bytes {0}
        [3] /Users/guillermo/Docs/Docs.Prog/JavaScript/bb/a.coffee 56 bytes {0} [built]
  * What's worse, you get an unexpected result in the browser: `false`
