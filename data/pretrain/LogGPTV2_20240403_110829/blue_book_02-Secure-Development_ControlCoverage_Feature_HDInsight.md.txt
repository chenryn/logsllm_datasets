## Important Notice: DevOps Kit (AzSK) Sunset
Please note that the DevOps Kit (AzSK) will be sunset by the end of FY21. For more details, please refer to the [AzSK Sunset Notice](../../../ReleaseNotes/AzSKSunsetNotice.md).

### HDInsight Security Controls and Rationale

| Control Description | Rationale | Severity | Automated Fix Script Available |
|---------------------|-----------|----------|--------------------------------|
| **HDInsight must use a supported cluster version** | Using the latest or supported HDInsight version significantly reduces the risk of security vulnerabilities and ensures that the cluster is protected against known bugs and updates. | High | Yes |
| **Use Public-Private key pair with a passcode for SSH login** | Public-Private key pairs, combined with a passcode, provide enhanced protection against password guessing and brute force attacks. | High | No |
| **Restrict HDInsight cluster access using a virtual network or Azure VPN gateway with NSG traffic rules** | Restricting cluster access through inbound and outbound traffic rules via Network Security Groups (NSGs) limits network exposure and reduces the attack surface. | High | Yes |
| **Use secure transfer protocol for accessing storage account resources** | Secure transfer protocols (e.g., HTTPS) ensure server/service authentication and protect data in transit from man-in-the-middle, eavesdropping, and session-hijacking attacks. It is essential to disable plain HTTP access to prevent data compromise. | High | No |
| **Enable encryption at rest for storage used by the cluster** | Encrypting data at rest minimizes the risk of data loss from physical theft and helps meet regulatory compliance requirements. | High | No |
| **Store sensitive data on storage linked to the cluster, not on cluster node disks** | Storing sensitive data on cluster node disks can result in data loss during node restarts. Additionally, HDInsight does not support encryption at rest for cluster node disks. | High | No |
| **Restrict access to the cluster's storage to the virtual network of the cluster** | Limiting storage access to the clusterâ€™s virtual network reduces the attack surface. | Medium | No |
| **Grant minimum required cluster operation permissions using Ambari Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** | Implementing RBAC to grant users only the necessary permissions minimizes resource exposure in case of user or service account compromise. | Medium | No |
| **Grant access to Ambari views only to required users/identities** | Restricting access to Ambari views to only necessary users minimizes the exposure of underlying data resources. | Medium | No |
| **Renew Ambari admin password at regular intervals** | Periodic password rotation is a best practice for security hygiene, reducing the risk of data loss or compromise due to key theft, brute forcing, or recovery attacks. | Medium | No |
| **Enable diagnostics for cluster operations** | Diagnostics logs are crucial for creating activity trails and investigating incidents or compromises. | Medium | No |
| **Do not store secrets and keys in plain text in notebooks and jobs** | Storing secrets such as connection strings, passwords, and keys in clear text poses a significant security risk. Use a secure storage solution like KeyVault to protect them. | Medium | No |

This table provides a comprehensive overview of the security controls and their rationale for HDInsight clusters, along with the severity level and whether an automated fix script is available.
