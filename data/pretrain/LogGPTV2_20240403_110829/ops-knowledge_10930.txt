User: Please provide a method/technique that can speed up the website access.
Assistant: Using a CDN (Content Delivery Network) is one way to speed up your website. CDN stores the content of web pages on servers all over the world. When users visit the website, CDN will load the content from the nearest server according to the location of the user, thereby reducing the loading time of web pages and improving the speed of website access. At the same time, CDN can also cache static resources of the website, such as pictures, scripts, style sheets, etc., to reduce the burden on the server and respond to user requests faster.
