The `cd` function in Julia does not automatically expand the tilde (`~`) to the user's home directory, which can be inconvenient, particularly for interactive use. This behavior raises the question: Is this an explicit design decision, or could it be improved?

For example, when attempting to change the directory to the Desktop folder using a tilde, the following error occurs:

```julia
julia> cd("~/Desktop")
ERROR: chdir ~/Desktop: No such file or directory
 in systemerror at error.jl:38
 in cd at file.jl:14
```

One possible enhancement would be to have the `cd` function check if the `ENV["HOME"]` environment variable is defined. If it is, the function could substitute the tilde with the value of `ENV["HOME"]`. This would make the `cd` function more user-friendly and consistent with common shell behaviors.

Hereâ€™s how the enhanced `cd` function might work:

```julia
function cd(path::AbstractString)
    expanded_path = replace(path, "~" => ENV["HOME"])
    chdir(expanded_path)
end
```

This way, users could seamlessly use `~` to refer to their home directory, improving the overall experience.
