Abstract.  This  paper  analyzes  the  mobile  data  traffic  traces  of  a  CDMA 
network and presents its unique characteristics compared to the wired Internet 
traffic. The data set was passively collected from the backbone of a commercial 
mobile service provider. Our study shows the highly uneven up/downlink traffic 
utilization  nature  in  mobile  data  networks  along  with  small  packet  sizes,  so 
called the mice in the network. In addition, the relatively short session length 
reflects  the  user  behavior  in  mobile  data  network.  We  have  also  observed  a 
large  amount  of  retransmissions  on 
the 
consequences of such phenomenon as well as the possible causes.

1   Introduction 
The  increase  in  availability  of  the  mobile  data  services  offers  new  means  of 
ubiquitous  communication  and  entertainment.  These  services  include  multimedia 
short message service (SMS), content downloading (e.g., ring tones, mp3, web-blog 
update,  e-book),  on-line  game,  instant  messaging,  multimedia  streaming,  and  many 
more. Due to the high cost and unfavorable conditions in  the  wireless environment, 
the  traffic  characteristics  of  the  cellular  networks  for  the  data  services  are 
distinguishable from those of the wired Internet traffic. 
Recently a few studies have analyzed the traffic traces of the cellular networks – 
CDMA 1xEVDO [3, 4, 5] and GPRS [2] - that are more suitable for carrying the data 
traffic.  It  is  important  to  note  that  these  experiments  were  limited  to  a  small  scale 
measurement  study  of  the  packet  traces  at  the  two  end  hosts.  Their  efforts  were 
concentrated  on  measuring  the  TCP  performance  metrics  rather  than  understanding 
the user behavior and the root cause of unusual traffic patterns. We differ from these 
works  in  that  our  analysis  investigates  the  unique  or  unusual  traffic  characteristics 
reflecting the user and data service patterns.

2   Mobile Data Traffic Characteristics   
The mobile data traffic trace we used in this paper is for a consecutive 12 hour period at 
the  backbone  of  commercial  CDMA  network.  More  than  85%  of  the  total  packets  are 
under the size of 100 bytes or less. This is a certainly distinguishable difference compared 
to the wired network. Such packets are less likely to transfer the actual data but to fulfill 
the signaling purpose of negotiating or maintaining the connection. The heavy tail of the 
flow length distribution theory might not be valid for the mobile data network. 
The majority of the traffic is bound to the mobile devices from the content servers 
or  WAP  gateway  -  inbound.  The  ratios  (%)  between  the  inbound  and  outbound  in 
packet counts and byte counts are 85:15 and 91:9, respectively. It  follows a  similar 
trail of the HTTP request-response behavior [1] which is somewhat an outdated traffic 
pattern for today’s Internet. 
Fig.  1  (a)  and  (b)  indicate  that  over  90%  of  data  traffic  sessions  are  terminated 
within  10-20  seconds.  In  case  of  UDP  sessions,  the  proportion  of  0-10  seconds 
sessions are higher than those in TCP because of the unwanted DNS packets. Fig. 1 
(c) illustrates the distribution of the flow lengths in the wired Internet. The available 
streaming  and  file  downloading  applications  (e.g.,  P2P  file  sharing)  in  the  wired 
Internet initiate longer data transmissions compared to the mobile data services where 
a light SMS transfer is  yet the dominant application. The fundamental difference of 
the service applications and user behavior contribute to lowering the average session 
length in mobile data networks.

3   Retransmission Analysis 
Fig. 2 illustrates the total and retransmission packet counts over the 12 hour period. 
Almost 80% of the total packets captured in  the link are found to be retransmission 
packets.  Sending  unnecessary  retransmission  packets  can  cause  a  waste  of  network 
bandwidth and negatively influence the transparency of network usage billing.

Fig. 2. Total packet vs. Retransmission packet counts 
We  have  selected  two  sample TCP  sessions  in  a  close  time  interval.  Session  A 
experiences a large number of retransmission packets: 237 of the total 575 packets 
are  retransmission  packets  between  the  time  of  02:43  and  03:09.  While  session  B 
consists  of  just  one  retransmission  packet  out  of  the  total  237  packets  between 
02:41 and 03:01. These sessions are oriented between two separate mobile devices 
and  one  content  server.  Fig.  3  (a)  and  (b)  illustrate  the  packets  per  second  (PPS) 
measures  over  time  for  session  A  and  B,  respectively.  The  PPS  for  both  sessions 
remains steady  with value of 1; however, we observe a sudden peak at the almost 
end  of  session  A  –  a  few  occurrences  of  59  PPS.  This  phenomenon  indicates  the 
retransmission  attempts  from  the  content  server,  in  which  multiple  copies  of  the 
same packet are sent continuously. 
The total TCP sessions detected during the first half of our monitoring period was 
235,568.  About  77%  of  them  encounter  the  packet  retransmissions.  Fig.  3  (c) 
illustrates  the  number  of  sessions  sorted  by  their  retransmission  packet  ratio  to  the 
total  packet  count  of  each  session.  The  index  on  the  x-axis  represents  the  range  of 
ratios (index 1 – 0 to 0.1, index 2 – 0.1 to 0.2, and likewise for the rest). Surprisingly, 
the sessions with retransmission ratio of more than 0.9 (index 10) is 38% of the total 
TCP sessions. In other words, 9 out of 10 packets are retransmission packets in these 
sessions. The majority of retransmissions in this experiment are less likely hardware 
duplicate because they have the pattern of occurring at the end of transmission.

4   Concluding Remarks 
This paper presented a study of the mobile data traffic characteristics by analyzing the 
data traffic trace  from a commercial  CDMA backbone network.  A  few  unique traffic 
characteristics  were  observed:  Uneven  in/outbound  traffic  utilization  at  the  mobile,  a 
low average packet size, a short session length, and a high retransmission ratio. While 
comparing  with  the  wired  Internet  traffic,  we  have  found  that  the  some  of  these 
characteristics  followed an old trail of the  wired Internet traffic. In addition,  we  have 
indicated  unusually  a  large  amount  of  retransmissions  at  the  backbone  and  suggested 
possible  answers  to  such  phenomenon.  Its  consequences  might  raise  a  controversy  of 
charging accuracy and performance degration in the mobile data services and also could 
help to troubleshoot the configuration problem at the service provider’s network.
