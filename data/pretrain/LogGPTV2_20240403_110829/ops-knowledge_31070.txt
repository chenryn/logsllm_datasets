User:  How to configure Nginx reverse proxy and load balancing on Linux system?
Assistant: To configure Nginx reverse proxy and load balancing on the Linux system, you can follow the steps below: 1. Install Nginx To install Nginx on the Linux system, you can use the systemâ€™s own package management tool (such as yum or apt-get) to install it. You can also download the source code from the Nginx official website to compile and install it. 2. Configure reverse proxy To configure Nginx as a reverse proxy server, you need to edit the Nginx configuration file (usually located in /etc/nginx/nginx.conf), and add reverse proxy configuration, as follows: ```nginx http { server { listen 80; server_name example.com; location / { proxy_pass http://backend; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; } } upstream backend { server backend1.example.com; server backend2. example.com; } } ``` The above configuration configures Nginx to listen on port 80, receive requests from the example.com domain name, and forward the requests to multiple backend servers for processing. 3. Configure load balancing To configure load balancing in Nginx, you need to define multiple servers in the upstream, and use the load balancing algorithm provided by Nginx for distribution. The following are some common load balancing algorithms: - round-robin (default): Distribute requests to different servers in turn; - ip_hash: Send requests with the same IP address to the same server for processing, suitable for stateful applications Procedure; - least_conn: Send the request to the server with the least number of current connections. The following is an example load balancing configuration using the round-robin algorithm: ```nginx upstream backend { server backend1.example.com; server backend2.example.com; server backend3.example.com; # load using the round-robin algorithm Balance # Other algorithms (such as ip_hash or least_conn) can be replaced by round-robin # Use the weight parameter to specify the weight of each server, the higher the weight will get more requests # For example: server backend1.example.com weight=3 ; # Indicates that the weight of backend1.example.com is 3, and the default is 1. # Use max_fails and fail_timeout to specify failure detection and recovery strategies # For example: server backend1.example.com max_fails=3 fail_timeout=10s; # means that if backend1.example.com fails 3 consecutive requests, it will be marked as unavailable for 10 seconds bell. # When requesting again after 10 seconds, if successful, mark it as available, otherwise continue to wait. # For more configuration parameters, please refer to the official documentation. least_conn; } ``` 4. After the test configuration is completed, you can use curl and other commands to test to check whether the request is successfully forwarded to the backend server and whether the load balancing policy is met. The above are the basic steps for configuring Nginx reverse proxy and load balancing on the Linux system, which need to be adjusted and optimized according to specific business requirements.
