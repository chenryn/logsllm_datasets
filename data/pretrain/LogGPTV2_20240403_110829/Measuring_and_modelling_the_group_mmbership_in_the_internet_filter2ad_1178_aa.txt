ABSTRACT
In this paper, we measure and model the distribution of multicast
group members. Multicast research has traditionally been plagued
by a lack of real data and an absence of a systematic simulation
methodology. Although temporal group properties have received
some attention, the location of group members has not been mea-
sured and modelled. However, the placement of members can have
signiﬁcant impact on the design and evaluation of multicast schemes
and protocols as shown in previous studies. In our work, we iden-
tify properties of members that reﬂect their spatial clustering and
the correlation among them (such as participation probability, and
pairwise correlation). Then, we obtain values for these properties
by monitoring the membership of network games and large audio-
video broadcasts from IETF and NASA. Finally, we provide a com-
prehensive model that can generate realistic groups. We evaluate
our model against the measured data with excellent results. A re-
alistic group membership model can help us improve the effective-
ness of simulations and guide the design of group-communication
protocols.

research can greatly beneﬁt from realistic models and a systematic
evaluation methodology ([7] [25] [10] [21] [8] [23] [22] [26] [30]
[14]). Despite the signiﬁcant breakthroughs in modelling the traf-
ﬁc and the topology of the Internet, there has been little progress
in multicast modelling. As a result, the design and evaluation of
multicast protocols is based on commonly accepted but often un-
proven assumptions. For example, the majority of simulation stud-
ies assumes that the users are uniformly distributed in the network.
In this paper, we challenge this assumption and study the spatial
properties of group members, such as clustering and correlation.
A realistic and systematic membership model can have signiﬁ-
cant impact on the design and development of multicast protocols.
Spatial information can help us address the scalability issues, which
has always been a major concern in multicasting. Similarly, reli-
able multicast protocols need spatial information in order to ﬁne-
tune their performance or even evaluate their viability. Further-
more, spatial properties of a group with common interest members
transcend the scope of IP multicast. Group communications is an
undeniable necessity independently of the speciﬁcs of the technol-
ogy that is used to support it. For example, web caching or applica-
tion level multicast protocols can and should consider the member
locality.
Only recently, properties of group membership have received
some attention, but the spatial properties have not been adequately
measured and modelled. Several studies show the importance of
the spatial distribution of members [30] [14] [21]. However, there
does not exist a generative model for such a distribution, which is
partly due to unavailability of real data. In more detail, there have
been several studies on the temporal group properties [4] [15]. In
addition, several studies examine the scaling properties of multi-
cast trees [10] [21] [8] [9] and the aggregatability of multicast state
[22] [26] [30] [14]. Philips et al. [21] conclude that the afﬁnity
and disafﬁnity of members can affect the size of the multicast tree
signiﬁcantly. Thaler et al. [26] and Fei et al. [14] observe that the
location of members has signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the performance
of their state reduction schemes.
In this paper, we study the distribution of group members focus-
ing on their clustering and correlation. A distinguishing point of
our work is that we use extensive measurements to understand the
real distributions and develop a powerful model to generate realis-
tic distributions. Our contributions can be grouped into two main
thrusts.
I. Real data analysis. We measure and analyze the member-
ship of net games and large audio-video broadcasts from IETF and
NASA (over the MBONE). We quantify properties of the mem-
bership focusing on: a) the clustering, b) the distribution of the
participation, and c) the distribution of the pairwise correlation of
members or clusters in a group. We observe that the MBONE mul-
ticast and gaming groups exhibit differences, which suggests the
need for a ﬂexible model to capture both. In our clustering analy-
sis, we use the seminal approach of network-aware clustering [16].
More speciﬁcally, we make the following observations.
1. MBONE multicast members: The group members are highly
clustered and the clusters exhibit strong pairwise correlations
in their participation.
2. Net game members: The clustering is much less pronounced
and there does not seem to be a strong correlation between
users. Interestingly, we observe a very strong daily periodic-
ity.
II. GEM: A model for generating realistic groups. We de-
velop GEneralized Membership model (GEM) that can generate
realistic member distributions. These distributions are given as in-
put parameters to the model, enabling users to match the desired
distribution. The main innovation of the model is the capability to
match pairwise participation probabilities. To achieve this, we use
the Maximum Entropy method [31], which, in an under-deﬁned
system, chooses the solution with maximum “randomness” or en-
tropy. As a result, GEM can simulate the following membership
behavior:
1. Uniform distribution, which is the typical but not always re-
alistic distribution.
2. Skewed participation distribution without pairwise correla-
tions.
3. Skewed participation distribution with pairwise correlations.
We validate our model with very positive results. We are able to
generate groups whose statistical behavior matches very well the
real distributions.
Modelling location of users with common interests. The analy-
sis and the framework presented here can be of interest even out-
side the multicast community. Applications with multiple recipi-
ents such as web caching and streaming multimedia are also inter-
ested in the location of users ([6] [29]). We provide our data and
our model to the community with the hope that it can be part of
a realistic and systematic evaluation methodology for this kind of
research ([1]).
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives
some background on multicast group modelling. Section 3 lists
the spatial properties of group members. Section 4 quantiﬁes the
spatial group properties using real data from the MBONE and net
games. Section 5 describes our powerful group membership model.
In Section 6, we validate the capabilities of our model. Finally, we
conclude our work in section 7.
2. BACKGROUND
In this section, we give some background on multicast group
modelling and related efforts.The properties of multicast group be-
havior can be classiﬁed into two categories: spatial and temporal
properties. Spatial properties consider the distribution of multicast
group members in the network. Temporal properties concentrate
on the distribution of inter-arrival time and life time of group mem-
bers, in other words, the group member dynamics. In the following,
we give an overview of the related work on the modelling of multi-
cast group behavior.
The majority of multicast research assumes simplifying assump-
tions on the distribution of members in the network. Protocol devel-
opers assume almost always that users are uniformly distributed in
the network (such as [27], [28], [5], [17], [13], and [10], etc.). This
is partly due to the unavailability of real data. On the other hand,
it is interesting to observe that skewed distributions have been ob-
served in multiple aspects of communication networks from trafﬁc
behavior [18] [20] to preferences for content [11] and peer-to-peer
networks [19].
There have been some studies on the temporal group properties,
such as [4] and [15]. [4] measured and studied the member arrival
interval and membership duration for MBONE. It also showed that,
for multicast sessions on MBONE, an exponential function works
well for the member inter-arrival time of all type of sessions, while
for membership duration time, an exponential function works well
for short sessions, but a Zipf [32] distribution works well for longer
sessions. [15] conducted a follow-on study for net games. The au-
thors found that player duration time ﬁts an exponential distribu-
tion, while inter-arrival time ﬁts a heavy-tailed distribution for net
game sessions.
Several studies examining the scaling properties of multicast trees
([10] [21] [8] [9] [23]) and the aggregatability of multicast state
([22] [26] [30] [14]) show that the spatial properties do matter in
multicast research. In their seminal work, Chuang and Sirbu [10]
discovered that the scaling of the tree cost follows power law with
respect to the group size, assuming that group members are uni-
formly distributed throughout the network. Philips et al. gave an
explanation of the Chuang and Sirbu scaling law in [21]. They also
considered member afﬁnity 1, and concluded that, for a ﬁxed num-
ber of members, afﬁnity can signiﬁcantly affect the size of the de-
livery tree. These two works mainly concentrate on multicast efﬁ-
ciency (the gain of multicast vs unicast). Besides deﬁning a metric
to measure multicast efﬁciency, Chalmers and Almeroth ([8] [9])
also examined the shape of the multicast trees through measure-
ments from MBONE, basically focusing on the the distribution and
frequency of the degree of in-tree nodes, the depth of receivers, and
the node class distribution. In this work, Chalmers and Almeroth
also indicate that the multicast efﬁciency can be affected by the
member clustering.
The distribution of the group members affects our ability to ag-
gregate the multicast state signiﬁcantly. State aggregation has been
the goal of several research efforts ([22], [26], and [14]). These pa-
pers proposed different state reduction schemes, and showed that
group spatial properties, such as clustering of members, correlation
between members, affects the performance of their approaches. In
[30], Wong et al. did a comprehensive analysis of multicast state
scalability considering network topology, group density, cluster-
ing/afﬁnity of members and inter-group correlation. They conclude
that application-driven membership has signiﬁcant impact on mul-
ticast state distribution and concentration.
3. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE GROUP
MEMBERSHIP
In this section, we identify and deﬁne several properties of group
membership, which we quantify through measurements in the next
section. For simplicity, we refer to the hosts or routers in the Inter-
net as “nodes” or “network nodes”.
1. Member Clustering: Clustering captures the proximity of
the group members. We are interested in the proximity from
1Member afﬁnity means the members are likely to cluster together,
while disafﬁnity means that they tend to spread out.
a networking point of view, and we use the network-aware
clustering method [16] in our measurement.
Earlier studies proposed models to capture the clustering of
group members ([26], [30]). However, these studies do not
provide measurements of the clustering in the Internet.
Note that the metrics we present below can refer to a node
or a cluster. We will use the term “cluster”, since a node is
a cluster of size 1. In addition, we focus on clusters in our
analysis.
2. Group Participation Probability: Different clusters have
different probabilities in participating in multicast groups:
some clusters are more likely to be part of a group. The uni-
form distribution of participation is a special case where all
clusters have the same probability.
Multiple Group Participation: If we have many groups, we
deﬁne the participation probability of a cluster as the ratio of
groups that the cluster joins.
Time-based Participation: For a single but long-lived group,
the participation probability can be deﬁned as the percentage
of time that a cluster is part of the group. We ﬁnd this deﬁni-
tion particularly attractive, since our data is often limited in
the number of groups. It should be noted that, in our analysis,
we use this deﬁnition.
Fei et al. [14] proposed a node-weighted model to incorpo-
rate the difference among network nodes, where each node is
assigned a weight representing the probability for that node
to be in a group.
3. Pairwise Correlation in Group Participation: This metric
captures the joint probability that two clusters are members
of a group. The intuition is that common-interest or related
users (e.g. friends) will probably share more than one groups.
More speciﬁcally, we quantify the pairwise correlation be-
tween two clusters as follows. Given two clusters Ci and
Cj, we denote the participation probabilities of cluster Ci
and Cj as pi and pj respectively, and the joint participation
probability of Ci and Cj is denoted by pi,j. The correlation
coefﬁcient between Ci and Cj, coef (i, j), is the normalized
covariance between Ci and Cj ([24]):
coef (i, j) =
ppi × (1 − pi) ×ppj × (1 − pj)
(pi,j − pi × pj)
.
(1)
Multiple Group Pairwise Correlation: In the presence of
many groups, we can use the multiple group participation
probability to compute pairwise correlation.
Time-based Pairwise Correlation: In this work, we mea-
sured and analyzed single but long lived sessions (from MBONE
and net games). Thus we can use the time-based participa-
tion probability that we deﬁned above to compute time-based
pairwise correlation.
In the literature, there has been some effort to model the pair-
wise correlation.
In [26], a two-dimensional array of ran-
domly allocated correlation probabilities is used. In [30], the
authors simulated the correlation implicitly by encouraging
the members of sets of nodes to join the same group, once
one of the nodes of the set has joined.
We did not ﬁnd any previous studies which use real data to verify
and quantify the spatial properties. In addition, no previous effort
has provided a comprehensive model for all of the above properties
of group membership, as we do here.
4. MEMBERSHIP FEATURES MEASURED
FROM MBONE AND NET GAMES
In this section, we measure the properties of multicast group
membership in real applications. First, we use data from NASA
and IETF broadcasts over the MBONE, which are single-source
large-scale application. Second, we measure the membership at
net games, which are multiple-source interactive application. The
MBONE is an overlay network on the Internet, and it has served as
a testbed for multicast researchers since 1992. Net games is one of
the most popular multiple-source applications. Though most of net
games are implemented using multiple unicasts, we are interested
in the membership behavior (or spatial group properties), which is
independent of the underlying implementation.
4.1 Measurement Methodology
MBONE. We use data sets provided by Chalmers and Almeroth
from University of Santa Barbara ([8] [9]). The data sets are di-
vided into two groups: real data sets and cumulative data sets,
which are summarized in Table 1 and Table 2 separately.
The real data sets include IETF43-A, IETF43-V and NASA, and
the cumulative data sets include UCSB-2000, UCSB-2001, Gatech-
2001 and UOregon-2001. For the details of measurement on MBONE,
please see references [8] and [9]. One thing deserving more de-
scription is the generation of cumulative data sets: multicast paths
are traced using a number of sources (UCSB, Georgia Tech, and
Univ. of Oregon) for a series of 22,000 IP addresses that were
known to have participated in multicast groups over a two years
period, June’97-June’99. In these data sets, although most of the
traces were collected recently and reﬂect the latest multicast infras-
tructure, the group members represent a relatively random sample
taken from the older MBONE. Due to the limited number of real
data sets, we use cumulative data sets to get an intuition of how the
size of groups affects the property of member clustering.
Net Games. For net games, we use the QStat tool [3] to collect
data. QStat is a program designed to poll and display the status
