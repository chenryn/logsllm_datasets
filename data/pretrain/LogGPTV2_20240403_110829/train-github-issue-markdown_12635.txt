**Current Behavior**
`DatePipe.transform()` generates an incorrect string in Internet Explorer (IE). Instead of returning the expected, formatted date string, it appends the entire date object to the end of the formatted string.

**Expected Behavior**
`DatePipe.transform()` should return a consistent, correctly formatted date string across all browsers, including IE.

**Steps to Reproduce the Issue**
1. Visit the Plunker example: [http://plnkr.co/edit/bNfFJW3VN9eiEwlfDzqH?p=preview](http://plnkr.co/edit/bNfFJW3VN9eiEwlfDzqH?p=preview)
2. Observe the output in IE.

**Motivation for Changing the Behavior**
The current behavior makes it impossible to reliably use `DatePipe` within Angular components when running in IE, as it does not produce the expected, formatted string.

**Environment Details**
- **Angular Version:** 2.0.X
- **Browser:** IE11
- **Language:** TypeScript 2.0.2
- **Node (for AoT issues):** `node --version` = [please provide version]
