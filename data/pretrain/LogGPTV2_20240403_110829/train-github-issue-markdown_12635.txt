**Current behavior**  
DatePipe.transform() produces an incorrect string in IE. Instead of getting
the correct, formatted string, you get the correct formatted string followed
by the whole date.
**Expected behavior**  
DatePipe.transform() should return the same result as in other browsers.
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**  
See Plunker example:

**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
With the current behavior it is impossible to get the correct, formatted
string when using DatePipe inside a component.
