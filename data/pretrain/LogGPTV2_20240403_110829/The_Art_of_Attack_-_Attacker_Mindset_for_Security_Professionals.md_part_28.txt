money. MIT’s Drazen Prelec and Duncan Simester found that peo-
ple are generally more willing to spend a larger sum of money when
they pay with a credit card than cash (“Always Leave Home With-
out It: A Further Investigation of the Credit- Card Effect on Willing-
ness to Pay,” 2001, https://web.mit.edu/simester/Public/Papers/
Alwaysleavehome.pdf). They are also more willing to spend $10 on
a theater ticket if they have just lost a $10 bill than if they have to
replace a lost ticket worth $10 (Kahneman and Tversky, 1984, ref-
erenced in “Choices, Values and Frames,” https://web.missouri
.edu/~segerti/capstone/choicesvalues.pdf). But it is all the same;
losing the ticket worth $10 is the exact same event as losing the
$10 bill. This brings into play fungibility— money is interchangeable
and has no labels. Here’s where I am going with this: most people
see security through a similar mental filter. People think of secu-
rity (and money) through a subjective lens that often intersects with
their feelings rather than thinking of it in terms of the “bottom line.”
Why should cybersecurity be treated any differently than physi-
cal security? Many people wouldn’t try unknown doors on a dark
night just to see what’s behind them, but they will click unknown
links from unknown sources, not looking too closely at the origi-
nating address. Many people wouldn’t leave their cars or homes
unlocked, but they will leave their computers unlocked. Many
people will take the news seriously that thieves are operating in
their area, going door to door, but not that hackers are always on
the prowl and capable of getting on their network even though so
much of our personal lives and details are held within the devices
we connect to our networks. They won’t stop filling in online forms
Staying Protected— The Individual 249
with personal details that are collected and used maliciously. Most
of us would not tell a stranger who happened to walk by us on the
street where we had been and where we were going, but we will give
people information on Facebook through check- ins or by labeling
Instagram photos with location metadata. The parallels are end-
less, but the bottom line remains: people should think of security
as, well, security. But to do so, they have to understand that there is
crossover between what can be stolen from them online and what
can be stolen on spied on in the physical world.
Reductively, security online is not so different from security in
the real world: if you wouldn’t tell a stranger, don’t tell the Inter-
net. Your privacy matters and is not the same as, but is linked to,
your security. All data is sensitive data. If you can place yourself
in the mind of an attacker, you will be able to assess more clearly
and accurately what can be used against you and how. You might
still choose to share information, but that will be your choice and at
least it will be informed.
People should follow processes and treat security as an abso-
lute, not as a relative and subjective thing, not based on how they
feel about a person or email, and not based on where the requests
and directives are coming from. Security should be fungible—
interchangeable, not subjective. Creating simple policies that allow
a person— any person, of any position or rank—t o understand them
easily and treat them as absolutes is a good start. And if you, as the
individual supposed to implement the policies don’t understand
them, speak up. Ask people around you if they understand the poli-
cies, ask yourself how likely you are to uphold their directives. For
the points that seem too far-f etched or unclear to you, raise them
with your peers and management so that they can be carved into
something more meaningful or clear—something you can follow.
Following the right processes, no matter how they feel, is critical.
Recall the woman who really wanted to help me on my vish-
ing call, which was meant to trick her. She followed every process
the client had, was polite, seemed as though she really wanted to
help, spent time trying to authorize herself to help, but ultimately
ended the call when she couldn’t verify me. She treated security as
250 AFTER AMs
an absolute, not as a relative and subjective thing. She did not look
at the circumstances and narratives I was presenting and find a way
in her mind to let it work. She found no value in our unique interac-
tion. It did not matter to her that I was trying to be sweet, charming.
She beat me in a game of chess she didn’t even know she was play-
ing. But this is not common.
Finally, as a community, we can use every digital and physical
tool at our disposal to protect people, communities, and businesses,
and those efforts are a good start. But the real solution begins to
take shape when people realize they’re being subjected to cogni-
tive attacks. Defense starts in the brain. Behavioral security should
be taken seriously as a branch of cyber- and information security
because, as humans, we do not always act rationally, so as secu-
rity professionals, we must seek to understand individuals as they
really are and how it matters to security. This has many contribut-
ing factors, such as cultures and subcultures within the workplace,
the overall understanding of a company’s optimal security posture
and how far it is from achieving it, why it is important and how
attacks might unfold.
Amygdala Hijacking
We know security—digital, physical, personal, and professional—
can be a scary topic, especially if you’ve faced online harassment,
identity theft, or other online attacks. As an individual intent on
avoiding becoming a target, there are things you can do to mitigate
your risk. But first, you have to know how it feels to be one.
The amygdala is actually the amygdalae. They are a bilateral
structure, one on each side of our brains, behind the eyes and
the optic nerves. Bessel van der Kolk, a prominent doctor, calls
them the brain’s “smoke detector.” They detect fear and prepare
your body for an emergency response. When you identify a threat,
your amygdalae sound an alarm, releasing a torrent of chemicals,
like adrenaline and cortisol. When this deeply instinctive function
takes over, it is called an amygdala hijack, a term Daniel Goleman
Staying Protected— The Individual 251
coined in Emotional Intelligence (Bantam, 2005). The common psy-
chological phraseology states that you have been “triggered.” And
all of the responses you have to amygdala hijacking are designed to
move you into action. Complex decision making departs, as does
your ability to perform multiple evaluations.
The amygdalae work with the conscious and unconscious areas
of the brain to determine how to react to situations. When a stress
response occurs, the sympathetic nervous system is activated,
which is part of the autonomic nervous system, which controls all
of our automatic functions, like the immune response, hormones,
digestion, heart rhythm, and breathing. This is what an attacker
relies on.
If an attacker says they have an appointment and that if you
don’t let them in, something bad will happen—t he elevators will
have to be shut down, or your boss’s request won’t be honored, or
that your action will impact the situation negatively— there’s a like-
lihood the amygdalae will be provoked. The most effective way out
of this state is to pause. It may sound hippy- dippy and like therapy
parlance, but it’s the best way to reset your defenses and reassume
your composure. Follow the process set out for you. Simplify it in
your brain to an objective. Now you are thinking like an attacker,
and now you’re on the path to beating one.
Just having awareness of this, knowing that it can be used
against you with nothing more than a sentence, is scary. But it’s the
first step of defense. You can always pause. Regain your composure,
take a few breaths, and wait until your mind can reassess the situ-
ation and reply as you see fit. Treat security as an absolute, not as a
subjective thing. Place little value on unique interaction with some-
one trying to bypass normal processes. There’s a chance they want
you to feel and then act in a certain way.
Acting in a security- conscious way doesn’t come down to how
the situation makes you feel; it comes down to the process for the
situation.
Another area where amygdala hijacking is rife is with a trendy
phishing scam that relies on sextortion. A target will receive an
email that claims their computer has been hacked and that intimate
252 AFTER AMs
recordings of them, for example using a porn site or partaking in
sexual activities, have been obtained. Some versions of this scam
even include the person’s password for an online account or may
appear to have been sent from the person’s own email address. It’s
hard, without the proper knowledge, to not fall for this. The email
will then go on to blackmail the target, threatening to release the
footage unless a payment is made. This is often an emotional event,
and all the deep breaths in the world might not help because there’s
often no process to follow in our personal lives (unlike in our pro-
fessional). This is where reasoning and education come into the
mix. Still take the time to calm down and then perform research.
Depending on how tech- savvy you are, your research might be
reaching out to a friend or trusted source.
For closure’s sake, for this sort of phish and any other, don’t
respond or send any payments. Immediately change your password(s).
A good resource is the website Have I Been Pwned?. It allows you to
check if your email address is listed as being affected by one of the
large data breaches included on their database. If your email address
is listed, go ahead and change the emails for all listed accounts, and if
you reuse passwords over multiple accounts, change those, too. You
should also mark the phish as spam and delete it.
If you ever end up sending money using your credit card, you
must talk to the company, and the same goes if you happen to have
paid from your bank account. If you pay with Bitcoin the transac-
tion is likely untraceable.
Analyze Your Attack Surface
Think of yourself as one person with multiple attack points. Remem-
ber, as far as AMs is concerned, every piece of information that
exists about you can be tied back to the objective of targeting you—
the attacker will weigh up all the information they find about you
and assess whether or not it is good or bad in terms of their objec-
tive. Learn and lean into the fact that privacy limits the amount
of information an attacker can discover about you, and security
Staying Protected— The Individual 253
prevents unauthorized access to your accounts/events. You need to
implement both to have a cohesive strategy. There are best practices
that apply to everyone, and there are practices that are specific to
you and your footprint and needs only. See what an attacker could
find on you, and think about how that would affect you.
You should eliminate all unnecessary pathways, including old
posts on social media and emails no longer in use. Think like some-
one who wants to get your most valuable possession, your deepest
secrets, or into your safest places. You might also attempt to OSINT
yourself. See what you could put together, based on the information
available online about yourself. You could include reverse search-
ing and analyzing pictures you’ve posted to see if there is anything
in the background that gives away information that could (a) locate
you or (b) be sensitive.
You might also look at your location. Where does your house sit
on the street? Who can see into your house and from where? These are
important questions to ask if there’s ever a chance you could be spied
on. You might also consider the pictures you post of your house’s inte-
rior online. If you post the cute picture of your cat on your keyboard,
are you also posting the apps you have on your computer? What about
the hardware you use? It can all be valuable to an attacker.
There’s also the issue of when you decide to sell your home.
Those images tend to live online for a long time. You might con-
sider taking images of your family members down and also keeping
other sensitive information, like mail and hardware, out of view.
Get educated on good techniques to protect yourself, like using
VPNs, password protection, two-f actor authentication, and privacy-
centric email providers. “Extreme Privacy: What It Takes to Dis-
appear,” 2020, offers tips on how to hide, such as removing your
information from databases, ways to circumvent providing your cell
phone number, protecting your address, and registering your resi-
dence and vehicles in trusts or LLCs, etc. That might be too far for
some readers and sound like the stuff privacy dreams are made of.
I recently gave an interactive speech to one of America’s three-
letter agencies, where I said that if you go to a hotel, check the posi-
tion of the cameras relative to your room, have your room point
254 AFTER AMs
onto the street, not somewhere obscure, so that, should someone
try to break in, they will be seen. I also noted that you should ask for
a room that is not on the ground floor to make access harder; when
traveling, you should keep your devices under the seat in front of
you where you can see them at all times; and that you should not
check your accounts while traveling and that, if you can, avoid tak-
ing photos. To be honest, no one seemed very galvanized by the
advice. It was taken with more of a “Well, yes, of course” reaction.
The advice applies to regular individuals as well. When I say
it to “regular” people, however, they are always taken aback. They
always want to delve into the topic and make me answer if that’s
something they should take seriously. . . I suppose it applies to some
people more than others, but I don’t know all of you. My sugges-
tion is to take the advice if you think it’s necessary for you to do so.
Only you can decide that, but if you want to think like an attacker
to beat one, you should consider it. After all, treating security as an
absolute is the name of the game. Take the safer room; be cautious
of your possessions as you travel. Be careful of the information you
share at any time.
You should also be careful how you store confidential informa-
tion. Use encrypted computer hard drives, USBs, and so on, to con-
tain sensitive information. Never leave your systems unattended.
Always protect them with strong passwords.
In all honesty, a sharp AMs pointed against you as an individual
is a hard thing to dodge. It takes full awareness, knowing and accept-
ing that an attack could target you without you knowing in the
moment. Such attacks can be brazen, almost effortlessly convincing
you to hand over items of access that are seemingly harmless.
There are a few steps you can take that I will list here, because
they become more viable and valuable with the awareness of attack-
ers and their mindsets now that you’ve read this book:
• Refuse to provide personal information or passwords over email
or on the phone if you did not call the number yourself.
• Refuse to provide information about yourself over the phone or
even in person unless you sought the person out—f or example,
if you go to your bank and they ask you to supply some verifying
Staying Protected— The Individual 255
information, you are most likely safe in giving it. If your bank
calls you, you might want to reconsider. If they come to your
house, you might want to call the police.
• Verify a request’s authenticity by contacting the company
directly.
With that said, there are other things, less often advised, you
can do to protect yourself, such as redirecting and reflecting ques-
tions back at people who are inquisitive about your life. It’s actually
a good way to make friends, too, contrary to popular belief. People
typically want to talk about themselves, not you. Let them.
At work, you should be wary of anyone asking what kind of
software you use or the name of the person responsible for main-
taining your computer network. We know attackers pose as cow-
orkers, repair technicians, IT staff, and convenient outsiders with
an apparent legitimate need to know such information.
Network security is also an area that requires attention. The tra-
ditional measures mean using antivirus, passwords, keeping your
devices, browsers, and apps up-t o- date, and similar steps. Measures
introduced by behavioral security, where we treat security as an abso-
lute, mean knowing and sticking to effective processes. Don’t log on
to public Wi-F i without a virtual private network (VPN), ever. Delete
sensitive information when it’s no longer needed, and do it weekly.
Do not fill out forms online, such as quizzes and informal question-
naires. Do not click on anything in an email without hovering over
the link or checking it in a virtual machine. There’s so much you can
do to be safe. The bottom line is that you have to research best prac-
tices, decide which to use, and then carry them out religiously.
Finally, threat modeling looks within. An attacker’s mindset is
formed by also looking at you and your information. The less you
give them, the better. For the information you do give out, threat-
model it. Ask what is the worst that can happen with that informa-
tion, and work backward from there to mitigate that risk or plan for
the eventuality of it being used against you.
Treat your security as seriously as an attacker looking to harm
you would.
256 AFTER AMs
Summary
• Security is not relative to any circumstance; you are not more
secure online than you are in the physical world.
• Security is an absolute and should be treated without mental
accounting of it. Your cybersecurity is not less important than
your home security or any other type.
• There are ways to protect yourself, and there are steps you can
take that will thwart attacks, stopping attackers in their tracks
should they try targeting you.
Key Message
If you are security conscious, be security conscious everywhere. The
real solution will begin to take shape when people start realizing
they’re being subjected to all attacks via cognitive attacks. Defense
starts in the brain. The promise of behavioral security as applied
to policy is to use people’s weaknesses to help them achieve their
business’s goals.
