What is NLP?
Neuro-Linguistic Programming
Neuro: Our neurology and our ﬁve senses
Linguistic: The language we use to 
describe our word and communicate with 
others
Programming: The habitual and often 
sequential nature of our thoughts, 
feelings, and actions
History of NLP

Studied successful therapists (Fritz Perls, 
Virginia Satir, etc..)
Observed patterns in their behaviors

History of NLP
Presuppositions of NLP
The map is not the territory
Experience has a structure
The mind and body are parts of the same system
If one person can do something, anyone can learn to do it
People already have all the resources they need
You cannot NOT communicate
The meaning of your communication is the response you get 
Underlying every behavior is a positive intention
People are always making the best choice(s) available to them
If what you are doing isn't working, do something else. Do 
anything else. 
Building Physical 
Rapport
Mirroring and Matching
Body position, posture, movement, rhythm, 
breathing
Voice tone, speed, volume, rhythm
Do not mimic
Building Verbal Rapport
Representational systems
Visual, auditory, kinesthetic, olfactory 
(smell), gustatory (taste)
People usualy prefer or “lead” with one or 
two
Building Verbal Rapport
Predicates
Everything after and including the verb 
of a sentence
Can help to determine the 
representational system being used
Example: “I can see what you’re saying 
clearly”
Communicating with someone using the 
same rep. system they are using can help 
to gain rapport
Visual Phrases:
I see what you mean
We see eye to eye
The future looks Bright
Auditory Phrases
Loud and clear
Unheard-of
Word for word
Kinesthetic Phrases
I can grasp that idea
I got the hang of it
I will get in touch with you
Olfactory and Gustatory Phrases
a sweet person
something smells ﬁshy
that's bitter-sweet 
Building Verbal Rapport
Motivation Strategies 
(metaprograms)
Metaprograms: perceptual ﬁlters
Motivation Strategies 
Toward: motivated toward their goals. Go 
for what you want.
Away-from: motivated to avoid what you 
don't want. 
Submodalities
The way we think about / perceive 
something is directly linked to the way we 
feel about it
For visual rep. system. The bigger and 
brighter an image is in your mind, the more 
real, close, or attractive it feels.
Submodalities
Use submodality words and phrases to make the 
picture you want in their head, as big, bright, and real 
as possible
Combine with motivation strategies
away-from: "I know you want to avoid a potentially 
big situation, by pissing off the boss, so do I, let's 
just get this done before it gets any bigger."
toward: "I know you want to make the boss happy, 
if you do this, I know he'll have a big bright smile 
on his face, and the future you want in the 
company will be closer than ever."  
Milton Model
The Milton Model
Pace and lead a person's reality
Distract and utilize the conscious mind
Access the unconscious and resources
Used for hypnotic induction, therapy, 
inﬂuence
Milton Model

Techniques:
Ambiguity (Generalized Referential Index)
Certain things might come to mind
People can begin to feel more comfortable when listening to a 
good speaker
Presuppositions: assumptions that have to be made in order to make 
sense of a sentence
Will you be more relaxed if you stand up or sit down?
After you've told me what I need to know, you can go back to 
what you were doing.
Imbedded commands:
I don't know if you can listen carefully to what I have to say.
When I talk people are able to listen carefully to what I have to 
say.
You don't have to listen carefully to what I have to say, but as 
you do you will begin to realize how you can use NLP in your 
own life.
