wouldnt it make sense to enhance WebApplicationContextUtils with sister
methods which accept a PortletContext? Currently I am working in a Portal
Environment where its not easy to get a ServletContext, but a PortletContext
is not different at all, unfortunately Websphere's PortletContext doesnt
extend ServletContext.
perhaps like this:
static WebApplicationContext getRequiredWebApplicationContext(PortletContext
pc)  
static WebApplicationContext getWebApplicationContext(PortletContext pc)
