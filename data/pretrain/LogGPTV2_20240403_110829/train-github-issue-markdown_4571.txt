It would be beneficial to enhance `WebApplicationContextUtils` with additional methods that accept a `PortletContext`. In my current work within a portal environment, obtaining a `ServletContext` is challenging, while a `PortletContext` is readily available. Unfortunately, in the case of WebSphere, `PortletContext` does not extend `ServletContext`.

I propose adding the following methods to `WebApplicationContextUtils`:

```java
static WebApplicationContext getRequiredWebApplicationContext(PortletContext pc);
static WebApplicationContext getWebApplicationContext(PortletContext pc);
```

**Affects Version:** 1.2.6

This enhancement would provide better support for portal environments and improve the overall usability of the `WebApplicationContextUtils` class.
