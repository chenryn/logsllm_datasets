Since RandomForestClassifier and RandomForestRegressor do not have a
max_samples attribute unlike BaggingClassifier and BaggingRegressor, there is
no way to set the sub sample size in case of former. This is undesirable in
case of large datasets where the individual estimators of the random forest
may need to be built on smaller sub-samples of the datasets in order to save
computational time.
