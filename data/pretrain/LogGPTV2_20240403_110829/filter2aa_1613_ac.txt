that falls within 3 standard deviations of the mean.
•So thatʼs a whistle stop tour of the normal distribution, so hopefully the rest of this will make sense now.

•So after ﬁguring out who was in our sample, my next step was to look at the responses to the questions themselves to decide how to analyse these variables. 
•Just in case you were interested, for almost all the analysis for this study, I used the Statistical package SPSS. 
•Firstly, I used SPSS to produce descriptive statistics of mean, median, stdev, minimum and maximum values and also skewness and kurtosis, which are indications of the shape of 
the distribution. I also created histograms of the data to be able to see the distributions.

•A distribution like this, however, looks like it has potential to satisfy a normal approximation, so further tests need to be performed to see whether we can actually use a normal 
approximation or not.
•I used SPSS to perform Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests for normality, which tests the data to see if it can be reasonably assumed that it ﬁts the normal distribution. The results showed that 
actually none of the variables in our study could be considered normally distributed.

•But why is this important?
•When analysing data, there are two types of analysis – parametric and non-parametric, or in the case of correlational analysis like ours, Pearsonʼs Analysis or Spearmanʼs Analysis.
•Pearsonʼs is better and much more preferable, as it looks at the magnitudinal differences between datapoints. But it can only be used on continuous data whose underlying population 
approximates the normal distribution and on variables whose relationship is linear. 
•Spearmanʼs, on the other hand, can be performed on rank order data, or on continuous data that does not satisfy the needs of Pearsonʼs test. However, if you use Spearmanʼs on 
continuous data, it converts all nominal values into ranks, therefore you lose the magnitude of difference between the variables, so Spearmanʼs can be less sensitive and less powerful 
than Pearsonʼs.
•So in deciding what analysis to perform, we need to look at the data and decide if we can reasonably say that the samples come from a normally distributed population and that any 
two variables will have a linear relationship. If we can – Pearsonʼs, if not, Spearmanʼs.
•BUT there is an exception to this rule called the Central Limit Theorem, which states that with sufﬁciently large sample sizes, all samples of a given population approach the normal 
distribution. Under this rule, our sample of 537 is ʻsufﬁciently largeʼ therefore, if we wanted to, we COULD, under the central limit theorem, sate that all variables were normally 
distributed and therefore use the preferred Pearsonʼs test.

•But despite all this, I still chose the Spearmanʼs test. There are 3 main reasons for this:
1.
As I said before, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests for normality showed that none of the variables satisﬁed tests for normality
2.
As far as I know, we know nothing of the underling population distributions, for example, what is the distribution of all 750 million Facebook usersʼ levels of neuroticism? So I 
wasnʼt happy to state that the underlying populations were normal, therefore the samples should be.
3.
And ﬁnally, with sufﬁciently large sample sizes (as ours is), the Spearmanʼs test is only slightly less powerful than Pearsonʼs.
•Taking all this into account, I thought we should err on the side of caution and use the Spearmanʼs test and be conﬁdent in our conclusions, rather than use Pearsonʼs and risk 
statistical errors.
•Spearmanʼs has been used in other studies of online use and personality

•This value is called the p value and it lets me know whether a correlation is statistically signiﬁcant or not. But again, what does that mean? If we go back to our hypotheses: our Null 
Hypothesis stated that there was no relationship between personality and Facebook activity. Our alternative hypothesis stated that there is a relationship between personality and 
Facebook activity.
•The p value is the probability of, if the null hypothesis is true, itʼs the probability that we could ﬁnd a result at least as extreme as the one we observed in our study. So basically, the 
smaller the p value is, the more evidence we have to reject the null hypothesis and accept that there is a relationship between our variables. 
•So in translating this correlation to having meaning in the real world, weʼre not concerned with the p value, as all this tells us is the probability that weʼve made the right conclusion. To 
ﬁnd out the strength of the relationship between these two variables, we need to look at this value, which is the r value, or the coefﬁcient of correlation. 
•In correlational analysis, what you really want is a value as close to 1 or -1 as you can get, as this indicates a very strong relationship. So intuitively, we can see that in this case, it 
may be a statistically signiﬁcant relationship but it doesnʼt appear to be a very strong one. 
•To ﬁnd out exactly how strong, we need to square the r value to get what is called the coefﬁcient of determination, and this will tell us the percentage of variance, or ﬂuctuation, in one 
variable that can be predicted or explained by the other variable. In this case, if we square our r value of 0.24, we get roughly 0.05, which translates to 5%. So even thought this 
correlation is statistically signiﬁcant, it illustrates that only 5% of the variance of one variable can be explained by the other. 
•In a nutshell, you have to look beyond the fact that something is statistically signiﬁcant and start to look at the strength of the relationship.
