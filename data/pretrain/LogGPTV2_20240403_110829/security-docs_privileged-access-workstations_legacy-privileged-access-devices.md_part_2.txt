The default configuration in this PAW guidance installs administrative tools on the PAW, but a jump server architecture can also be added if necessary.
![A diagram showing how reversing the control relationship and accessing user apps from an admin workstation gives the attacker no path to the targeted object.](./media/legacy-privileged-access-devices/break-the-attack-chain.png)
This figure shows how reversing the control relationship and accessing user apps from an admin workstation gives the attacker no path to the targeted object. The user jump server is still exposed to risk so appropriate protective controls, detective controls, and response processes should still be applied for that internet-facing computer.
This configuration requires administrators to follow operational practices closely to ensure that they don't accidentally enter administrator credentials into the user session on their desktop.
![A diagram showing how accessing an administrative jump server from a PAW adds no path for the attacker into the administrative assets.](./media/legacy-privileged-access-devices/no-path-to-administrative-asset.png)
This figure shows how accessing an administrative jump server from a PAW adds no path for the attacker into the administrative assets. A jump server with a PAW allows in this case you to consolidate the number of locations for monitoring administrative activity and distributing administrative applications and tools. This adds some design complexity, but can simplify security monitoring and software updates if a large number of accounts and workstations are used in your PAW implementation. The jump server would need to be built and configured to similar security standards as the PAW.
#### Privilege management solutions
Privileged Management solutions are applications that provide temporary access to discrete privileges or privileged accounts on demand. Privilege management solutions are a valuable component of a complete strategy to secure privileged access and provide critically important visibility and accountability of administrative activity.
These solutions typically use a flexible workflow to grant access and many have other security features and capabilities like service account password management and integration with administrative jump servers. There are many solutions on the market that provide privilege management capabilities, one of which is Microsoft Identity Manager (MIM) privileged access management (PAM).
Microsoft recommends using a PAW to access privilege management solutions. Access to these solutions should be granted only to PAWs. Microsoft doesn't recommend using these solutions as a substitute for a PAW because accessing privileges using these solutions from a potentially compromised user desktop violates the clean source principle as depicted in the following diagram:
![A diagram showing how Microsoft does not recommend using these solutions as a substitute for a PAW because accessing privileges using these solutions from a potentially compromised user desktop violates the clean source principle.](./media/legacy-privileged-access-devices/pam-leaves-a-gap.png)
Providing a PAW to access these solutions enables you to gain the security benefits of both PAW and the privilege management solution, as depicted in this diagram:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These systems should be classified at the highest tier of the privilege they manage and be protected at or above that level of security. These are commonly configured to manage Tier 0 solutions and Tier 0 assets and should be classified at Tier 0.

## PAW Scenarios
This section contains guidance on which scenarios this PAW guidance should be applied to. In all scenarios, administrators should be trained to only use PAWs for performing support of remote systems. To encourage successful and secure usage, all PAW users should be encouraged to provide feedback to improve the PAW experience, and this feedback should be reviewed carefully for integration with your PAW program.
In all scenarios, extra hardening in later phases and different hardware profiles in this guidance might be used to meet the usability or security requirements of the roles.
> [!NOTE]
> This guidance explicitly differentiates between requiring access to specific services on the internet (such as Azure and Microsoft 365 administrative portals) and the "Open Internet" of all hosts and services.
|**Scenarios**|**Use PAW?**|**Scope and Security Considerations**|
|---------|--------|---------------------|
|Active Directory Admins - Tier 0|Yes|A PAW built with Phase 1 guidance is sufficient for this role.-   An administrative forest can be added to provide the strongest protection for this scenario. For more information on the ESAE administrative forest, see [ESAE Scenarios for Continued Use](/security/privileged-access-workstations/esae-retirement#scenarios-for-continued-use)-   A PAW can be used to managed multiple domains or multiple forests.-   If Domain Controllers are hosted on an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) or on-premises virtualization solution, you should prioritize implementing PAWs for the administrators of those solutions.|
|Admin of Azure IaaS and PaaS services - Tier 0 or Tier 1 (see Scope and Design Considerations)|Yes|A PAW built using the guidance provided in Phase 2 is sufficient for this role.-   PAWs should be used for at least the Global administrator and Subscription Billing administrator. You should also use PAWs for delegated administrators of critical or sensitive servers.-   PAWs should be used for managing the operating system and applications that provide Directory Synchronization and Identity Federation for cloud services such as [Microsoft Entra Connect](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/whatis-hybrid-identity) and Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS).-   The outbound network restrictions must allow connectivity only to authorized cloud services using the guidance in Phase 2. No open internet access should be allowed from PAWs.-   Windows Defender Exploit Guard should be configured on the workstation **Note:**     A subscription is considered to be Tier 0 for a Forest if Domain Controllers or other Tier 0 hosts are in the subscription. A subscription is Tier 1 if no Tier 0 servers are hosted in Azure.|
|Admin Microsoft 365 Tenant - Tier 1|Yes|A PAW built using the guidance provided in Phase 2 is sufficient for this role.-   PAWs should be used for at least the Subscription Billing administrator, Global administrator, Exchange administrator, SharePoint administrator, and User management administrator roles. You should also strongly consider the use of PAWs for delegated administrators of highly critical or sensitive data.-   Windows Defender Exploit Guard should be configured on the workstation.-   The outbound network restrictions must allow connectivity only to Microsoft services using the guidance in Phase 2. No open internet access should be allowed from PAWs.|
|Other IaaS or PaaS cloud service admin- Tier 0 or Tier 1 (see Scope and Design Considerations)|Yes|A PAW built using the guidance provided in Phase 2 is sufficient for this role.-   PAWs should be used for any role that has administrative rights over cloud hosted VMs including the ability to install agents, export hard disk files, or access storage where hard drives with operating systems, sensitive data, or business critical data is stored.-   The outbound network restrictions must allow connectivity only to Microsoft services using the guidance in Phase 2. No open internet access should be allowed from PAWs.-   Windows Defender Exploit Guard should be configured on the workstation. **Note:** A subscription is Tier 0 for a Forest if Domain Controllers or other Tier 0 hosts are in the subscription. A subscription is Tier 1 if no Tier 0 servers are hosted in Azure.|
|Virtualization Administrators- Tier 0 or Tier 1 (see Scope and Design Considerations)|Yes|A PAW built using the guidance provided in Phase 2 is sufficient for this role.-   PAWs should be used for any role that has administrative rights over VMs including the ability to install agents, export virtual hard disk files, or access storage where hard drives with guest operating system information, sensitive data, or business critical data is stored. **Note:** A virtualization system and its admins are considered Tier 0 for a Forest if Domain Controllers or other Tier 0 hosts are in the subscription. A subscription is Tier 1 if no Tier 0 servers are hosted in the virtualization system.|
|Server Maintenance Admins- Tier 1|Yes|A PAW built using the guidance provided in Phase 2 is sufficient for this role.-   A PAW should be used for administrators that update, patch, and troubleshoot enterprise servers and apps running Windows server, Linux, and other operating systems.-   Dedicated management tools might need to be added for PAWs to handle the larger scale of these admins.|
|User Workstation Admins - Tier 2|Yes|A PAW built using guidance provided in Phase 2 is sufficient for roles that have administrative rights on end-user devices (such as helpdesk and deskside support roles).-   Other applications might need to be installed on PAWs to enable ticket management and other support functions.-   Windows Defender Exploit Guard should be configured on the workstation.    Dedicated management tools might need to be added for PAWs to handle the larger scale of these admins.|
|SQL, SharePoint, or line-of-business (LOB) Admin- Tier 1|Yes|A PAW built with Phase 2 guidance is sufficient for this role.-   Other management tools might need to be installed on PAWs to allow administrators to manage applications without needing to connect to servers using Remote Desktop.|
|Users Managing Social Media Presence|Partially|A PAW built using the guidance provided in Phase 2 can be used as a starting point to provide security for these roles.-   Protect and manage social media accounts using Microsoft Entra ID for sharing, protecting, and tracking access to social media accounts.    For more information on this capability, read [this blog post](/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/credential-guard).-   The outbound network restrictions must allow connectivity to these services. This can be done by allowing open internet connections (much higher security risk that negates many PAW assurances) or by allowing only required DNS addresses for the service (might be challenging to obtain).|
|Standard Users|No|While many hardening steps can be used for standard users, PAW is designed to isolate accounts from the open internet access that most users require for job duties.|
|Guest VDI/Kiosk|No|While many hardening steps can be used for a kiosk system for guests, the PAW architecture is designed to provide higher security for high sensitivity accounts, not higher security for lower sensitivity accounts.|
|VIP User (Executive, Researcher, etc.)|Partially|A PAW built using guidance provided in Phase 2 can be used as a starting point to provide security for these roles.-   This scenario is similar to a standard user desktop, but typically has a smaller, simpler, and well-known application profile. This scenario typically requires discovering and protecting sensitive data, services, and applications.-   These roles typically require a high degree of security and high degree of usability, which require design changes to meet user preferences.|
|Industrial control systems (for example, SCADA, PCN, and DCS)|Partially|A PAW built using guidance provided in Phase 2 can be used as a starting point to provide security for these roles as most ICS consoles (including such common standards as SCADA and PCN) don't require browsing the open Internet and checking email.-   Applications used for controlling physical machinery would have to be integrated and tested for compatibility and protected appropriately.|
|Embedded Operating System|No|While many hardening steps from PAW can be used for embedded operating systems, a custom solution would need to be developed for hardening in this scenario.|
> [!NOTE]
> **Combination scenarios** some personnel might have administrative responsibilities that span multiple scenarios.
> In these cases, the key rules to keep in mind are that the Tier model rules must always be followed.
>
> **Scaling the PAW Program** as your PAW program scales to encompass more admins and roles, you need to continue to ensure that you maintain adherence to the security standards and usability. This might require you to update your IT support structures or create new ones to resolve PAW specific challenges such as PAW onboarding process, incident management, configuration management, and gathering feedback to address usability challenges. One example might be that your organization decides to enable work-from-home scenarios for administrators, which would necessitate a shift from desktop PAWs to laptop PAWs - a shift which might necessitate additional security considerations. Another common example is to create or update training for new administrators - training which must now include content on the appropriate use of a PAW (including why it's important and what a PAW is and isn't). For more considerations which must be addressed as you scale your PAW program, see Phase 2 of the instructions.
This guidance contains the detailed instructions for the PAW configuration for the scenarios as noted previously. If you have requirements for the other scenarios, you can adapt the instructions based on this guidance yourself or hire a professional services organization like Microsoft to assist with it.
## PAW Phased implementation
Because the PAW must provide a secure and trusted source for administration, it's essential that the build process is secure and trusted. This section provides detailed instructions, which allow you to build your own PAW using general principles and concepts similar to those used by Microsoft.
The instructions are divided into three phases, which focus on putting the most critical mitigations in place quickly and then progressively increasing and expanding the usage of PAW for the enterprise.
* [Phase 1 - Immediate Deployment for Active Directory Administrators](#phase-1-immediate-deployment-for-active-directory-administrators)
* [Phase 2 - Extend PAW to all administrators](#phase-2-extend-paw-to-all-administrators)
* [Phase 3 - Advanced PAW security](#phase-3-extend-and-enhance-protection)
It's important to note that the phases should always be performed in order even if they're planned and implemented as part of the same overall project.
### Phase 1: Immediate deployment for Active Directory administrators
Purpose: Provides a PAW quickly that can protect on-premises domain and forest administration roles.
Scope: Tier 0 Administrators including Enterprise Admins, Domain Admins (for all domains), and administrators of other authoritative identity systems.
Phase 1 focuses on the administrators who manage your on-premises Active Directory domain, which are critically important roles frequently targeted by attackers. These identity systems work effectively for protecting these admins whether your Active Directory Domain Controllers (DCs) are hosted in on-premises datacenters, on Azure Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), or another IaaS provider.
During this phase, you create the secure administrative Active Directory organizational unit (OU) structure to host your privileged access workstation (PAW), and deploy the PAWs themselves. This structure also includes the group policies and groups required to support the PAW.
The infrastructure is based on the following OUs, Security Groups, and group policies:
* Organizational Units (OU)
   * Six new top-level OUs:
      * Admin
      * Groups
      * Tier 1 Servers
      * Workstations
      * User Accounts
      * Computer Quarantine.
* Groups
   * Six new security-enabled global groups:
      * Tier 0 Replication Maintenance
      * Tier 1 Server Maintenance
      * Service Desk Operators
      * Workstation Maintenance
      * PAW Users
      * PAW Maintenance.
* Group policy objects:
   * PAW Configuration - Computer
   * PAW Configuration - User
   * RestrictedAdmin Required - Computer
   * PAW Outbound Restrictions
   * Restrict Workstation Logon
   * Restrict Server Logon.
Phase 1 includes the following steps:
#### Complete the Prerequisites
1. **Ensure that all administrators use separate, individual accounts for administration and end-user activities** (including email, Internet browsing, line-of-business applications, and other nonadministrative activities). Assigning an administrative account to each authorized person separate from their standard user account is fundamental to the PAW model, as only certain accounts are permitted to log on to the PAW itself.
   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Each administrator should use his or her own account for administration. Do not share an administrative account.
1. **Minimize the number of Tier 0 privileged administrators**. Because each administrator must use a PAW, reducing the number of administrators reduces the number of PAWs required to support them and the associated costs. The lower count of administrators also results in lower exposure of these privileges and associated risks. While it's possible for administrators in one location to share a PAW, administrators in separate physical locations require separate PAWs.
1. **Acquire hardware from a trusted supplier that meets all technical requirements**. Microsoft recommends acquiring hardware that meets the technical requirements in the article [Protect domain credentials with Credential Guard](/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/credential-guard).
   > [!NOTE]
   > PAW installed on hardware without these capabilities can provide significant protections, but advanced security features such as Credential Guard and Device Guard will not be available. Credential Guard and Device Guard are not required for Phase 1 deployment, but are strongly recommended as part of Phase 3 (advanced hardening).
   >
   > Ensure that the hardware used for the PAW is sourced from a manufacturer and supplier whose security practices are trusted by the organization. This is an application of the clean source principle to supply chain security.
   >
   > For more background on the importance of supply chain security, visit [this site](https://www.microsoft.com/security/cybersecurity/).
1. **Acquire and validate the required Windows 11 Enterprise Edition and application software**.
   * Windows 11 Enterprise Edition
   * [Remote Server Administration Tools](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=45520) for Windows 11
   * [Windows 11 Security Baselines](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-security-baselines)
   > [!NOTE]
   > Microsoft publishes MD5 hashes for all operating systems and applications on MSDN, but not all software vendors provide similar documentation. In those cases, other strategies will be required.
1. **Ensure you have WSUS server available on the intranet**. You need a WSUS server on the intranet to download and install updates for PAW. This WSUS server should be configured to automatically approve all security updates for Windows 11 or an administrative personnel should have responsibility and accountability to rapidly approve software updates. For more information, see the "Automatically Approve Updates for Installation" section in the [Approving Updates guidance](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc708458(v=ws.10)).
#### Move Tier 0 accounts to the Admin\Tier 0\Accounts OU
Move each account that is a member of the Domain Admin, Enterprise Admin, or Tier 0 equivalent groups (including nested membership) to this OU. If your organization has your own groups that are added to these groups, you should move these to the Admin\Tier 0\Groups OU.
#### Add the appropriate members to the relevant groups
1. **PAW Users** - Add the Tier 0 administrators with Domain or Enterprise Admin groups that you identified in Step 1 of Phase 1.
1. **PAW Maintenance** - Add at least one account used for PAW maintenance and troubleshooting tasks. The PAW Maintenance Account(s) is used only rarely.
   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Do not add the same user account or group to both PAW Users and PAW Maintenance. The PAW security model is based partly on the assumption that the PAW user account has privileged rights on managed systems or over the PAW itself, but not both.
   >
   > * This is important for building good administrative practices and habits in Phase 1.
   > * This is critically important for Phase 2 and beyond to prevent escalation of privilege through PAW as PAWs being to span Tiers.
   >
   > Ideally, no personnel are assigned to duties at multiple tiers to enforce the principle of segregation of duties, but Microsoft recognizes that many organizations have limited staff (or other organizational requirements) that don't allow for this full segregation. In these cases, the same personnel might be assigned to both roles, but should not use the same account for these functions.
#### Create "PAW Configuration - Computer" group policy object (GPO)
In this section, you create a new "PAW Configuration - Computer" GPO, which provides specific protections for these PAWs and link it to the Tier 0 Devices OU ("Devices" under Tier 0\Admin).
   > [!WARNING]
   > **Do not add these settings to the Default Domain Policy**. Doing so will potentially impact operations on your entire Active Directory environment. Only configure these settings in the newly-created GPOs described here, and only apply them to the PAW OU.
1. **PAW Maintenance Access** - this setting sets the membership of specific privileged groups on the PAWs to a specific set of users. Go to *Computer Configuration\Preferences\Control Panel Settings\Local Users* and Groups and complete the following steps:
   1. Click **New** and click **Local Group**
   1. Select the **Update** action, and select "Administrators (built-in)" (don't use the Browse button to select the domain group Administrators).
   1. Select the **Delete all member users** and **Delete all member groups** check boxes
   1. Add PAW Maintenance (pawmaint) and Administrator (again, don't use the Browse button to select Administrator).
      > [!IMPORTANT]
      > Do not add the PAW Users group to the membership list for the local Administrators group. To ensure that PAW Users cannot accidentally or deliberately modify the security settings of the PAW itself, they should not be members of the local Administrators groups.
      >
