**Title: Dissecting Non-Malicious Artifacts: One IP at a Time**

For years, anti-malware solutions across various network levels have relied on online antivirus aggregation services and sandboxes to enhance their detection capabilities and identify unknown threats. However, this enhanced protection comes with a significant downside. Even today, enterprises worldwide are using security solutions that, instead of safeguarding data, often misidentify it as malicious and share it with online multi-scanners. The consequences are severe.

A skilled hacker can easily access this shared data for a relatively small monthly investment, typically a few hundred euros. This cost is trivial if the hacker targets a high-value individual or organization. In just a few days, a capable hacker can build an intelligence platform that could be sold for ten times the initial investment. The data being leaked is extensive and diverse, ranging from sensitive corporate information to personal data.

In our research, we delved into these malware-scanning giants and developed sophisticated YARA rules to capture non-malicious artifacts. We then dissected these artifacts to uncover secrets that one would not expect to be exposed. Additionally, we will demonstrate how we built an intelligence tool that, upon insertion of an API key, automatically dissects a full dataset.

During our talk, we will reveal the alarming truth about the risks associated with allowing internally installed security products to interact with online scanners. Our goal is to highlight the importance of reevaluating these practices and implementing more secure and reliable solutions.
