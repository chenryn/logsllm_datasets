User: How to automatically mount a disk partition at system startup? Please write down the steps.
Assistant: 1. Open the terminal, enter the command sudo blkid, and find the UUID corresponding to the disk partition to be automatically mounted. 2. Create the mount point directory: sudo mkdir /mnt/mydisk. 3. Open the fstab file: sudo nano /etc/fstab. 4. Add a new mount record at the end of the file, the format is <UUID> <mount point> <file system type> <mount option> <dump> <fsck>, for example: UUID=12345678-1234-1234- 1234-123456789abc /mnt/mydisk ext4 defaults 0 0. 5. Press Ctrl + O to save the file, then press Ctrl + X to close nano. 6. Remount the file system: sudo mount -a. 7. Check whether the mount is successful: df -h. If the partition information is displayed, the mount is successful. Note: When modifying the fstab file, be sure to back up the original file to prevent the system from being unable to start due to accidental modification.
