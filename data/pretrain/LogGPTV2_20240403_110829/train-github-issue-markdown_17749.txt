When creating an archive (with `tar.NewWriter`), long names (> 100 chars) that
don't fit into standard tar headers need to be encoded differently.  
An optimisation in `archive/tar/writer.go: writeHeader()` tries to use a ustar
header when only the name is too long creates files that are misinterpretated
by other tar implementations (but read correctly by archive/tar)
For example,
`/home/support/.openoffice.org/3/user/uno_packages/cache/registry/com.sun.star.comp.deployment.executable.PackageRegistryBackend`
becomes `com.sun.star.comp.deployment.executable.PackageRegistryBackend` for
external `tar` commands (tested with GNU tar, BSD tar and star)
Modifying `archive/tar/writer.go` and forcing `preferPax` to `true` in
`NewWriter` fixes the issue
