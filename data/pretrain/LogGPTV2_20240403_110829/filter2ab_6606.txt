**Title: 21 Lessons from 11 Billion Breached Records**

Security vulnerabilities, hackers, and data breaches have become the new norm. These threats are not confined to those in the cybersecurity industry; they affect everyone. Whether you are online or offline, your personal information is almost certainly digitized and stored in systems that can be vulnerable to exploitation by attackers. But who are these individuals, and how do they consistently manage to breach our defenses despite our best efforts?

In this talk, Troy Hunt, the creator of "Have I Been Pwned," will share the insights he has gained from processing over 11 billion records of breached data. You will get a behind-the-scenes look at some of the most devastating incidents, the factors that led to them, and how they continue to cause significant damage, even as the industry becomes more aware of these risks.

This presentation offers a compelling, eye-opening, and sometimes entertaining exploration of information security and data breaches, providing valuable lessons for both professionals and the general public.
