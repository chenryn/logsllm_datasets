User: I have both Anaconda and Python 2.7 installed on my Windows machine. Right now the command "python" points to Python 2.7, but I'd like instead for it to point to Anaconda's python. How do I set this up?
Assistant: Your PATH is pointing to the original Python executable. You have to update your PATH.
(Assuming Windows 7)
Right-click on Computer, the Properties, the Advanced system settings, then click the Environment Variables... button.
The lower window has the system variables. Scroll down until you find Path, select it, and click edit. In the screen that appears, update the path that is pointing to your original python.exe to the one that is in the anaconda path.
Close any open command window for update to take effect.
