User: I'm trying to get Python support in gVim on Windows. Is there a way to accomplish that?
I'm using:

Windows XP SP3
gVim v. 7.3
Python 2.7.13 (ActivePython through Windows Installer binaries)
Assistant: After trying all answers in this thread without success, the following worked for me (Win10, Python 2.7 32bit, gvim 7.4 32bit):

Reinvoke the Python Installer, select Change Python
Select the Option Add Python to Path, which is off by default
After the installer is done, restart your machine
