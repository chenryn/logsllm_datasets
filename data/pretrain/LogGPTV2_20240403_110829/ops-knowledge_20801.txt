User: How to configure and manage multiple servers through SaltStack?
Assistant: Configuration management for multiple servers is easy with SaltStack. The following are the specific steps: 1. Install and configure SaltStack on the Salt master server. 2. Create an SLS file on the Salt master server, the Salt state file, which is used to define the configuration management tasks to be performed. SLS files can contain multiple directives that can be applied to multiple servers. 3. Create a list of target hosts on the Salt master server, that is, for which servers to perform configuration management tasks. 4. Execute the Salt command on the Salt master server, specify the SLS file to be executed and the list of target hosts. SaltStack will automatically perform the specified configuration management tasks on the target host. In short, it is very convenient and efficient to use SaltStack to configure and manage multiple servers. You only need to define management tasks and a list of target hosts on the Salt master server, and then execute Salt commands to automatically complete configuration management tasks.
