to other networks. This impacts analysis of traceroute,
as multiple adjacent IP addresses can be originated in
BGP by diﬀerent ASes.
In ﬁgure 9, R1 precedes in-
terfaces a1 and a2 on R2 and R3 routed by A, and b1
routed by B on R4; both R1 and R4 could be border
routers operated by diﬀerent networks. When (step 6.1)
we observe a neighbor router R1 using an address from
the network hosting our VP (X) to form the interdomain
link with, and multiple adjacent IP addresses originated
in BGP by diﬀerent ASes, then bdrmap infers the op-
erator of R1 to be the AS with the most adjacent IP
addresses. If there is a tie, we select the ﬁrst AS with a
known relationship (per our BGP inference) to the VP.
Otherwise, if the addresses bdrmap observes on a border
router R5 are originated by a diﬀerent AS, then bdrmap
infers the operator of R5 to be operated by that AS.
5.4.7 Infer additional aliases for border routers
(ﬁgure 10): We undertake a ﬁnal analytical alias reso-
lution step to address the cases where we were unable
to resolve likely aliases because the routers did not re-
spond favorably to our alias resolution probes. That is,
the routers did not respond to UDP probes with a com-
mon source-IP address, and did not assign IP-ID values
to responses from a single central counter. We assume

that a neighbor router R3 operated by A connects to
a single router in the VP’s AS by point-to-point link,
and (step 7.1) collapse single interface routers R1 and
R2 we previously inferred to be operated by X (in step
1.2) into into a single border router R4.
5.4.8 Infer operator of neighbor routers with-
out TTL expired messages (ﬁgure 11): Some oper-
ators conﬁgure their routers to never send TTL expired
messages, so these routers are not processed by previous
heuristics. Some routers respond to probes using other
messages, such as ICMP echo replies and destination
unreachables. The remainder of them remain silent. We
distinguish these cases from routers that rate limit their
response (are periodically responsive) by comparing the
set of VP neighbors we inferred borders for, from those
known to exist through public BGP data.
First, we assemble a list of neighbors observed in BGP
for the network hosting the VP for which we have not
inferred any interdomain links, and the traceroutes to-
ward those ASes. We then process the traceroutes for
each AS as a set. If the ﬁnal router observed by bdrmap
in the network hosting the VP was always the same
router (step 8.1), and bdrmap observed no other inter-
faces after that router when tracerouting toward a sin-
gle AS, then we infer the neighbor AS connects to that
router.
In this scenario, the AS has disabled ICMP
time exceeded messages and blocked our probe pack-
ets. While we cannot identify this (silent) router, we
can identify where it connects to the VP. Otherwise, if
the ﬁnal router bdrmap observed in the network host-
ing the VP was always the same router (step 8.2), and
bdrmap observed ICMP echo reply or destination un-
reachable messages with a source address that maps to
that neighbor AS, then we infer that neighbor AS con-
nects to the speciﬁc VP router.
In this scenario, the
neighbor’s border router has ﬁrewalled our probes from
entering the network, but sends speciﬁc ICMP messages
in response to our probes.
Figure 12: If an AS uses provider-aggregatable
address space from their provider on interfaces
on their internal routers, bdrmap may incorrectly
infer the position of interdomain link.
Figure 13:
If router R1 responds with diﬀer-
ent IP addresses depending on the destination
probed, and those addresses are not inferred to
be aliases, bdrmap may incorrectly infer the po-
sition of an interdomain link.
5.5 Limitations
bdrmap relies on the router-level map providing ad-
equate constraints so that our heuristics may correctly
infer border routers and their owners. However, not all
inferences we make are correct, as there are multiple
possible explanations for the topological arrangements
observed by bdrmap. In this section, we focus on topo-
logical limitations that can result in incorrect inferences
in where the network hosting the VP ends.
A provider may delegate provider-aggregatable (PA)
address space to their customer, and the customer may
conﬁgure part of that address space on their router in-
terfaces. In ﬁgure 12, AS A operates routers R1 and R2,
and uses PA address space from provider X on those
routers. When bdrmap observes these interfaces, it in-
fers an interdomain link between routers R1 and R2
operated by X and A, respectively, instead of correctly

Table 1: Evaluation of bdrmap heuristics against BGP observations and AS relationship inferences for
three networks. We validated the R&E and large access network inferences against ground truth
(§5.6). For these networks, between 92.2% and 96.8% of BGP-observed links had a neighbor border
router inferred by bdrmap. bdrmap also inferred interdomain links that were not BGP-visible, and these
links and border routers are reported in the “trace” columns. For all three networks, the ﬁrewall
heuristic inferred most customer routers, i.e., the last interface observed by bdrmap was the ingress
interface address assigned by the network hosting our VP on their border router.
inferring the interdomain link between routers R0 and
R1. This occurs because bdrmap ﬁrst infers X operates
R1 as adjacent interface x5 on R2 implies R1 is oper-
ated by X (§5.4.1, ﬁgure 4). Note that bdrmap correctly
infers R2 is operated by A using the ﬁrewall heuristic
in §5.4.2 or the customer heuristic in §5.4.5, but the
inferred location of the interdomain link is incorrect.
Similarly, a router may respond to traceroute with
diﬀerent IP addresses, particularly if there are multiple
load balanced paths involving the router, or if the opera-
tor conﬁgures virtual routers to establish BGP sessions
with neighbors and the router uses a single interface
from each virtual router to respond to traceroute (§4).
In ﬁgure 13, R1 is owned by AS X, and R1’s interfaces
x2 and x3 were observed in traceroute paths preceding
routers R2 and R3, respectively. However, if bdrmap did
not infer x2 and x3 to be aliases, and if bdrmap only ob-
served x2 in paths towards A, bdrmap incorrectly infers
x2 to belong to a router operated by AS A. bdrmap cor-
rectly infers x3 to belong to a router operated by X, as
adjacent interface x4 implies x3 is on a router operated
by X (§5.4.1, ﬁgure 4). If bdrmap had correctly inferred
x2 and x3 to be aliases, it would have correctly inferred
the existence of a silent router R2 operated by A, and
that R1 is operated by X.
5.6 Validation against ground truth
During the validation phase, we contacted 10 net-
works seeking ground-truth, and received data from 4:
a research and education (R&E) network, a large access
network, a Tier-1 network, and a small access network.
When we received a response declining to provide vali-
dation, the response highlighted commercial sensitivity,
as commercial networks view their interconnection as
proprietary, particularly at the router-level. We only
asked about interdomain links we observed, as we as-
sumed the networks would not provide ground truth on
links we had missed.
We were able to validate all our neighbor router in-
ferences for the R&E and small access networks; the
R&E network supplied us a sanitized router conﬁgu-
ration dump, and the small access network operator
manually checked inferred adjacencies. Validation for
the larger networks was challenging, both because the
engineers we spoke with only had detailed visibility into
part of the network, and because sometimes the address
we observed in traceroute was not the address that the
interconnecting party used on the interface peering with
the network oﬀering us validation.
R&E network: We obtained a sanitized router con-
ﬁguration dump from an R&E network.
In January
2016, the network consisted of 17 routers with BGP ses-
sions involving 48 ASes and three IXPs. Of the 45 inter-
domain links we inferred outside of the IXP, 44 correctly
identiﬁed the presence of an interdomain link and the
correct AS. We also correctly inferred the location of a
further three interdomain links with ASes that disabled
any form of ICMP response. Further, we validated the
interdomain links established via route servers at the
three IXPs where the network was present by using the
IXP-published information on which ASes are present
and the IP addresses they use. Of the 88 ASes for which
we had validation data, we correctly identiﬁed the AS
for 82, with 2 more identifying a sibling of the correct
392AS, i.e. 84/88 (95.4%). Overall, we correctly identiﬁed
131 of 136 interdomain links (96.3%).
Large access network: We obtained a ﬁltered snap-
shot of a router conﬁguration dump for the backbone of
a large access network. The backbone connects the net-
work’s largest peers and customers, while other parts of
the network connect its enterprise customers. We sent
an operator of this network a list of all IP addresses
we believed to be on border routers, and received in re-
turn ground truth on whether each address was on an
internal or interdomain link. For those that were an in-
terdomain link, we received ground truth on which AS
the link was with. We evaluated the correctness of infer-
ences from three VPs within this network, where each
VP observed between 188 and 198 interdomain links.
We correctly inferred between 97.0% and 98.9% of in-
terdomain links and associated neighbor networks with
an AS reﬂecting the correct organization.
Tier-1 network: We sent an operator of a Tier-
1 network a list of all IP addresses we believed to be
on their neighbors’ side of an interdomain link, and re-
ceived validation data for 2691 interfaces. Using this
data, we found 2584 of the 2650 routers we inferred
were neighbor routers identiﬁed with an AS reﬂecting
the correct organization (97.5%).
Small access network: An operator at a small ac-
cess network manually validated our inferences for 14
routers with less than 12 interdomain links, and pro-
