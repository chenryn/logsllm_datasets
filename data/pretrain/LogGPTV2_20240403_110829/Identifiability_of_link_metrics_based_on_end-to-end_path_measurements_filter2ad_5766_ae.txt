tiﬁed from end-to-end measurements between the selected
monitors. Thus, MMP is optimal as it places the minimum
number of monitors to identify all link metrics in G, as stated
in the following theorem.
Theorem 7.1. For an arbitrary connected network G, Al-
gorithm 1 (MMP) generates the optimal monitor placement
in the sense that: (1) all link metrics in G are identiﬁable
under this placement, and (2) no placement can identify all
link metrics in G with a smaller number of monitors.
Proof. See [26].
Complexity:
In Algorithm 1,
lines 1 and 14–16 take
O(|V (G)|) time. Splitting G into biconnected (line 2) and
then triconnected components (line 4) takes O(V (G)+L(G))
time [28, 29]. Selecting monitors takes O(1) time per com-
ponent, and the counters (sTj , MTj , cBi , and MBi ) can be
computed during the splitting/selecting process. Therefore,
the entire algorithm has O(|V (G)|+|L(G)|) time complexity.
Example: Given the graph in Fig. 8(a) as input (totally
22 nodes), MMP selects 11 monitors, where nodes {h, u, v,
t, j, e} are selected by line 1, {b, g, o, p} by lines 6–8, and f
by lines 10–12. It can be veriﬁed that the resulting graph
satisﬁes the identiﬁability condition in Theorem 3.3.
7.3 Evaluation of MMP
We evaluate MMP through a set of simulations on both
randomly-generated and real network topologies. We use the
following algorithm, referred to as Random Monitor Place-
ment (RMP), as a benchmark for comparison13: Given net-
work G, randomly select κ (κ = 2, · · · , |V |) nodes as monitors
and test the identiﬁability of the resulting network using the
algorithm in Section 7.1. Generally, RMP cannot guarantee
network identiﬁability for arbitrary G and κ. Therefore, we
measure its performance by the fraction of random place-
ments achieving network identiﬁability over multiple Monte
Carlo runs.
7.3.1 Random Topologies
We ﬁrst consider synthetic topologies generated accord-
ing to four widely used random graph models: Erd¨os-R´enyi
(ER) graphs, Random Geometric (RG) graphs, Barab´asi-
Albert (BA) graphs, and Random Power Law (PL) graphs.
We randomly generate 100 graph realizations of each model14,
with each realization containing 150 nodes (i.e., |V | = 150).
The generated graphs are then input to the monitor place-
ment algorithms. We now explain the models and the cor-
responding results separately.
Erd¨os-R´enyi (ER) graph: The ER graph is a simple
random graph generated by independently connecting each
pair of nodes by a link with a ﬁxed probability p. The re-
sult is a purely random topology where all graphs with an
equal number of links are equally likely to be selected. It is
known [30] that p0 = log |V |/|V | is a sharp threshold for the
graph to be connected with high probability, which implies
a minimum value of p = 0.0334 for |V | = 150.
13To our knowledge, MMP is the ﬁrst monitor placement al-
gorithm for identifying additive link metrics by measuring
controllable, cycle-free paths. Thus, we use random place-
ment to represent the average performance of an arbitrary
monitor placement for comparison.
14All realizations are guaranteed to be connected, as we dis-
card disconnected realizations in the generation process.
Random Geometric (RG) graph: The RG graph is fre-
quently used to model the topology of wireless ad hoc net-
works. It generates a random graph by ﬁrst randomly dis-
tributing nodes in a unit square, and then connecting each
pair of nodes by a link if their distance is no larger than
a threshold dc, which denotes node communication range.
The resulting topology contains well-connected sub-graphs
in densely populated areas and poorly-connected sub-graphs
It is known that dc ≥
in sparsely populated areas.
plog |V |/(π|V |) ensures a connected graph with high prob-
ability [31], which gives a minimum range of dc = 0.1031 for
|V | = 150.
Barab´asi-Albert (BA) graphs: The BA model [32] pro-
vides a random power-law graph generated by the following
preferential attachment mechanism. We begin with a small
connected graph G0 := ({v1, v2, v3, v4}, {v1v2, v1v3, v1v4})
and add nodes sequentially. For each new node v, we con-
nect v to nmin existing nodes, where nmin speciﬁes (a lower
bound on) the minimum node degree, such that the proba-
bility of connecting to node w is proportional to the degree
of w. If the number of existing nodes is smaller than nmin,
then v connects to all the existing nodes. The BA graph
has been used to model many naturally occurring networks,
e.g., Internet, citation networks, and social networks.
Random Power Law (PL) graphs: The BA model in-
troduces an artifact that all node degrees are lower bounded
by nmin. Alternatively, the PL graph [33] provides another
way of generating power-law graphs by directly specifying a
sequence of expected node degrees (d1, ..., d|V |) according to
the power law, i.e., di = iα (α > 0). The generation of a PL
graph is similar to that of an ER graph, except that instead
of connecting each pair of nodes with the same probability,
nodes i and j in a PL graph are connected by a link with
probability pij = didj/P|V |
k=1 dk.
We conduct simulations in two scenarios, densely-connected
graphs (Fig. 9 with parameter conﬁgurations: p = 0.039 for
ER, dc = 0.11943 for RG, nmin = 3 for BA and α = 0.42 for
PL) and sparsely-connected graphs (Fig. 10 with parameter
conﬁgurations: p = 0.0253 for ER, nmin = 2 for BA and
α = 0.32 for PL), to evaluate how graph density aﬀects the
performance of MMP and RMP. Since the number of links
n and the minimum number of monitors κMMP (computed
by MMP) vary across graph realizations, we present the av-
erage values denoted by n and κMMP for each graph model,
shown in the captions of Fig. 9 and 10. In each scenario, we
have tuned parameters of each model to generate roughly
the same average number of links. As RMP is a random-
ized algorithm, we repeat it for 2000 Monte Carlo runs to
obtain the average performance for each graph realization.
We then average the results over the 100 graph realizations
to obtain the ﬁnal results15, shown in Fig. 9 and 10.
For densely-connected graphs (Fig. 9), the probability that
RMP is able to identify all the links increases with the num-
ber of monitors κ. However, fewer than 20% of the ER,
RG, and PL graphs are identiﬁable when κ ≤ 120 (recall
|V | = 150), whereas a careful monitor deployment in the
same graphs by MMP ensures identiﬁability with signiﬁ-
cantly fewer monitors (κ < 25). Therefore, in most cases,
15For each graph realization, MMP achieves identiﬁability
with probability one for κ ≥ κMMP and zero for κ < κMMP.
Therefore, the overall probability for MMP to achieve iden-
tiﬁability using κ monitors is computed as the fraction of
graph realizations with κMMP ≤ κ.

the proposed algorithm (MMP) substantially outperforms a
randomized scheme (RMP) in the required number of moni-
tors. One exception is the BA graphs, where RMP achieves
similar performance as MMP. This can be explained as fol-
lows: When nmin = 3, further simulations show that 87.8%
of the generated BA graphs are 3-vertex-connected as each
node (except the initial nodes v2, v3, and v4) has at least
three neighbors; according to MMP, this implies that an
arbitrary placement of three monitors will achieve identi-
ﬁability, and there is no need for sophisticated placement
algorithms. Meanwhile, a comparison of the BA and the PL
models implies that the exceptional performance of RMP in
the BA model is due to the requirement that all node degrees
be lower bounded by three rather than the power law distri-
bution of node degrees, since it does not achieve the same
superior performance on PL graphs. For ER, RG, and PL
