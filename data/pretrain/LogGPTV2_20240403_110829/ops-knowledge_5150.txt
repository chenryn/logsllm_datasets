User: Answer the question about Azure Data Explorer Queued ingestion and data latencies:
Do I need to change the batching policy?

n
Assistant: If default settings for the [ingestion batching policy](batching-policy.md) do not suit your needs, you can try lowering the batching policy `time`. 
See [Optimize for throughput](../api/netfx/kusto-ingest-best-practices.md#optimize-for-throughput).
You should also update settings when you scale up ingestion. 
When you change batching policy settings, it can take up to 5-minutes to take effect.
