It seems that you are unable to locate the installed application, as it is not listed in the Start menu, Program Files (64-bit), or Program Files (x86). Even after repairing the installation, you still cannot find it.

One possible location for the application could be: `C:\Users\[Your Username]\AppData\Roaming\Appcelerator\`. I encountered a similar issue and found the application there. Additionally, you can try searching for "aptana" in the system search bar, which may help you locate the application.
