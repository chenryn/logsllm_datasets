Abstract. The percentage of encrypted network traﬃc increases steadily
not only by virtual private networks of companies but also by proto-
cols like SSH or SSL in the private sector. Traditional intrusion detec-
tion systems (IDS) are not able to cope with encrypted traﬃc. There
are a few systems which are able to handle encrypted lines but none
of them is applicable in general because of changed network protocols,
a restricted application range (e.g., only able to ﬁnd protocol-speciﬁc
attacks) or very high false alarm rates. We propose a new IDS for non-
intrusive, behavior-based intrusion- and extrusion detection in encrypted
environments.
Keywords: intrusion detection, payload encryption, non-intrusive mea-
surement, user strategy, traﬃc clustering, extrusion detection, data leak-
age detection.
1 Background
Signature-based IDSs (misuse detection) are widely used for the protection of
networks. Because patterns of the malware must be available in the database of
the IDS, only already known threats can be found. A study of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in the year 2002 unfoldes, that software patches are
often available at the same time as the signatures for IDSs are [1], therefore
reducing the advantages of the IDS. Even more, the increasing percentage of
encrypted network traﬃc additionally limits the detection capability of those
systems, because they have to analyze the payload and are not able to cope
with encrypted traﬃc. Unlike the misuse detection, anomaly-based systems are
able to detect new or unknown threats. E.g., the spreading of new worms can
be detected, but attacks inside the encrypted traﬃc (on application layer) are
still not detectable. Currently, there are only few IDSs able to cope with en-
crypted traﬃc but none of them is applicable in general. [2] gives an overview of
available systems and also proposes a new one (which also has the same
restrictions).
2 S2E2 System Architecture
S2E2 is an anomaly-based system. All parts of the system are working non-
intrusive, a decryption is not necessary. Based on the observable encrypted

network traﬃc, the user input is identiﬁed and weighted. Concurrently, the user
generating the network traﬃc is identiﬁed by keystroke dynamics. The therefor
necessary features are recovered by the timing of the network packets. The sys-
tem architecture consists of the following modules:
Traﬃc Clustering: The system records the timestamps of the network packets,
the payload sizes and the transmission directions. The gathered data is grouped
into clusters, whereas a cluster consists of an user input and the corresponding
answer of the server.
Command Evaluation: This is done by analysing the consecutive payload sizes
of the network packets. Timestamps are taken into consideration as well, e.g. for
the detection of server delays (for example, the delay when requesting the listing
of a directory is all the longer with the number of ﬁles in the directory). In the
ﬁrst step, probabilities for single command-answer-combinations are calculated.
Best values for each cluster are selected. After that, the probabilities for diﬀerent
sequences are generated. So, the ranking of the identiﬁed commands can change
based on the whole sequence of commands.
Strategy Analysis: Based on the identiﬁed commands, the strategy of the user
is being analysed: Diﬀerent sub-goals are deﬁned in an attack-tree by multiple
steps. E.g., the sub-goal root privileges can be achieved by exploitation, miscon-
ﬁgured programs, etc. Series of logically related but not necessarily complete
intrusion steps are being searched. If a number of subgoals can lead to an intru-
sion attempt, an alarm is raised.
User Identiﬁcation: Users of an encrypted connection are identiﬁed based on
their keystroke dynamics recovered from the encrypted network packets.
Policy Conformation: Based on the used sources, commands and the identiﬁed
user, the accounting and allowed resource usage is veriﬁed.
3 Results and Further Work
The modules Command Evaluation and User Identiﬁcation had been imple-
mented in a ﬁrst prototype. Our experiments have shown that both command
evaluation and user identiﬁcation are possible with our proposed method. For
the command evaluation, only a limited set is implemented at the moment.
This will be advanced especially to the system- and therefore attack-relevant
commands. For the strategy analysis, multiple attack-trees will be deﬁned and
integrated. After that, a summarizing evaluation will be implemented. The
completed prototype will be put into a broad test in the data center of the
University.
