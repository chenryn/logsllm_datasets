### Hand Geometry and Feature Vectors

For users \( i \) and \( j \), \( \mathbf{v}_i \) and \( \mathbf{v}_j \) represent their feature vectors, each consisting of 12 real features of hand geometry as depicted in Figure 2. The notation \( ||\mathbf{v}_i||_1 \) denotes the L1 norm of vector \( \mathbf{v}_i \). For the 144 subjects with recorded hand images, there are 10,296 possible user pairs.

### Zero-Effort Attack Evaluation

We used the 4-finger TFST L swipe gesture to evaluate the resilience to zero-effort attacks. The authentication model under attack is a 3-NN classifier trained with 30 legitimate samples using selected features. The experiment was repeated 20 times to account for randomness.

We calculated the similarity (Sim) values for all user pairs in our dataset and simulated each pair attacking each other by using one user’s data to attack the other’s authentication model. We then calculated the average False Acceptance Rate (FAR) at a False Rejection Rate (FRR) of 3% for user pairs with different Sim values. The results are summarized in Table VI.

When hand similarity information was not considered (first row in Table VI), the average FAR for the selected feature set was 4.41%. For the 59 most similar user pairs with Sim values higher than 0.98 (fifth row in Table VI), the average FAR was 5.04%. This difference indicates that even with similar hand geometries, the likelihood of a successful zero-effort attack remains relatively low when using TFST gestures.

We hypothesized that the fusion of physiological and behavioral features contributes to the resistance against zero-effort attacks, even with similar hand shapes. As shown in Table VI, for the pure physiological feature set, the FARs increased more rapidly with increasing hand similarity.

### Smudge and Shoulder Surfing Attacks

**Smudge Attack:**
A smudge attack involves an attacker using oily traces left on the screen as hints to pass the authentication. In a shoulder surfing attack, the attacker observes the authentication process and mimics the behavior to pass the authentication. In this section, we demonstrate that TFST gesture authentication is resilient to both types of attacks and their combinations.

**Experimental Setup:**
We recruited 20 additional students as attackers to target the 144 subjects in our dataset with recorded hand images. Each attacker targeted 10 victims, 5 with the most similar hand shapes (highest Sim values) and 5 with dissimilar hand shapes (lowest Sim values).

The attackers were asked to mimic the 4-finger TFST gestures of the victims. Each attacker was provided with two randomly selected multi-touch traces from each victim and allowed to practice as many times as needed. Each attacker generated 10 mimicry multi-touch traces for each genuine trace provided.

The authentication models being attacked were 3-NN classifiers trained with 30 and 100 legitimate samples, respectively. The Equal Error Rates (EERs) were calculated based on the decisions made by the corresponding authentication model on all mimicry and legitimate traces not used in training. The experiment was repeated 20 times to account for randomness.

**Smudge Attack Results:**
To evaluate resilience to smudge attacks, we drew the genuine multi-touch traces on the screen for the attacker to mimic, simulating the worst-case scenario where the oily residuals are complete and clear.

The EERs for smudge attacks with similar and dissimilar hand shapes are shown in Tables VII and VIII. The baseline was the zero-effort attack results without considering hand shape similarity. For smudge attacks with similar hand shapes, the EERs increased under physiological models compared to the baseline, while they decreased under behavioral models. This suggests that oily residues do not help attackers mimic behavioral features. For dissimilar hand shapes, the EERs decreased significantly, indicating that leaked hand geometry information does not help attackers with dissimilar hand shapes overcome the fundamental difficulty of hand dissimilarity.

**Shoulder Surfing Attack:**
To evaluate resilience to shoulder surfing attacks, we asked the attackers to watch an animation showing the movements of the victim’s fingers on the screen. The animation accurately replicated the temporal information recorded in a multi-touch trace, and attackers could watch it as many times as needed.

The EERs for shoulder surfing attacks with similar hand shapes are shown in Tables IX and X. The baseline was the zero-effort attack results. Under shoulder surfing attacks, the EER for the selected combined model trained with 30 samples increased from 3.02% to 3.31%, and for the model trained with 100 samples, it increased from 1.88% to 2.06%. For the combined smudge and shoulder surfing attacks, the EERs were 3.67% and 2.27%, respectively, demonstrating the resilience of our method to both types of attacks.

### Statistical Attack

Statistical attacks have been shown to be effective against behavior-based authentication methods. The basic idea is to estimate the probability density functions (PDFs) of features from a group of people and use the most probable feature values to generate forgeries.

**Algorithm 1: Generating Forged Features for Statistical Attack**

```plaintext
Input: RealFeatures[ ]; // Population feature vectors
Input: NumberOfBins; // Number of bins for each feature
Output: ForgedFeatures[ ]; // Feature vectors used for attack

NumberOfFeatures = NumberOfRows(RealFeatures);
for i=1 to NumberOfFeatures
    BinnedFeatures[i] = Binning(RealFeatures[i], NumberOfBins); // Generate bins
    KeyBin[i] = SortBinsByFrequency(BinnedFeatures[i]); // Sort bins by frequency
    LowerBound[i], UpperBound[i] = GetBound(KeyBin[i]); // Get bounds of first sorted bin
    AttackFeatures[i] = uniform(LowerBound[i], UpperBound[i]); // Generate forged feature
Return AttackFeatures[ ];
```

We evaluated the effect of statistical attacks on the authentication model built from 4-finger TFST gestures. Using all samples from 161 subjects in our dataset, we generated 10,000 synthetic feature vectors to attack the authentication models for each subject, trained with 30 and 100 legitimate samples, respectively. The experiment was repeated 20 times to account for randomness.

### Conclusion

The results and analysis show that our TFST gesture authentication method is resilient to zero-effort, smudge, and shoulder surfing attacks, even under the most challenging conditions. The fusion of physiological and behavioral features contributes significantly to this resilience.
