User: How to prevent SQL injection attacks? Please provide defense mechanisms such as prepared statements, parameterized queries, and filtered input.
Assistant: Precompiled statements, parameterized queries, and filtered input are common mechanisms to prevent SQL injection attacks, as follows: 1. Precompiled statements: decompose SQL statements into static parts and dynamic parts, parameterize and precompile the dynamic parts, so that each You only need to pass parameters when executing the SQL statement for the first time, avoiding the risk of SQL statement being injected. Commonly used precompiled statements are PreparedStatement, CallableStatement, etc. 2. Parameterized query: use placeholders in SQL statements to replace specific variable values, and then provide the corresponding number and type of parameters, so that the SQL statement will automatically match the parameter values with the placeholders during execution, thereby avoiding injection attacks . 3. Filter input: Filter and verify when the user enters data to prevent malicious input of special characters and SQL statements, thereby avoiding injection attacks. Commonly used filtering methods include escaping the input data, verifying the data type and length, and limiting the input character set. It is recommended to use precompiled statements or parameterized queries as much as possible when writing SQL statements, and to perform appropriate filtering and verification operations when processing user input data to ensure system security.
