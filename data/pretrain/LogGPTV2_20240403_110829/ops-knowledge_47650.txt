User: I have a CLI script and want it to read data from a file. It should be able to read it in two ways :

cat data.txt | ./my_script.py
./my_script.py data.txt

â€”a bit like grep, for example.
What I know:

sys.argv and optparse let me read any args and options easily.
sys.stdin let me read data piped in
fileinput make the full process automatic

Unfortunately:

using fileinput uses stdin and any args as input. So I can't use options that are not filenames as it tries to open them.
sys.stdin.readlines() works fine, but if I don't pipe any data, it hangs until I enter Ctrl + D
I don't know how to implement "if nothing in stdin, read from a file in args" because stdin is always True in a boolean context.

I'd like a portable way to do this if possible.
Assistant: There is no reliable way to detect if sys.stdin is connected to anything, nor is it appropriate do so (e.g., the user wants to paste the data in). Detect the presence of a filename as an argument, and use stdin if none is found.
