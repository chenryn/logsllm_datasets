Current PSI (Private Set Intersection) and other SMC (Secure Multi-Party Computation) protocols are unable to handle even 1% of the human genome. However, by leveraging domain-specific knowledge, the computation time can be reduced to 6.8 ms, and network bandwidth usage can be minimized to 6.5 KB. This is achieved by emulating the Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) chemical test in software, which reduces the problem to finding the intersection between two sets of size 25 [Baldi et al., 2011]. Subsequent research has demonstrated a framework for conducting such tests on an Android smartphone [Cristofaro et al., 2012].

For privacy-preserving paternity tests, the ideal output should be a simple "yes" or "no." Custom PSI protocols cannot provide this, but generic garbled circuit-based protocols can be easily modified to add this capability [Huang et al., 2011, 2012].

### Criminal Forensics
Law enforcement agencies often have unlimited access to comprehensive DNA record databases, typically containing records of convicted criminals (e.g., CODIS in the U.S.). The primary motivation for these databases is to match DNA evidence from crime scenes. However, providing unrestricted access to law enforcement can lead to potential abuse. Cryptographic methods have been developed to protect the privacy of records that do not match the crime scene evidence [Bohannon et al., 2000]. Specifically, DNA records can be encrypted using a key that depends on certain tests, allowing decryption only when the DNA from a crime scene matches the evidence.

Partial homomorphic encryption can also be used for privacy-preserving matching of Short Tandem Repeat (STR) DNA profiles in an honest-but-curious model [Bruekers et al., 2008]. Such protocols, described in Section VII.D, are useful for identity, paternity, ancestry, and forensic tests.

### VII.D Direct-to-Consumer (DTC)
Many DTC companies offer genealogy and ancestry testing. Cryptographic schemes can be employed to conduct these tests in a privacy-preserving manner. Partial homomorphic encryption can be used on STR profiles to perform:
- Common ancestor testing based on the Y chromosome,
- Paternity tests with one parent,
- Paternity tests with two parents, and
- Identity testing [Bruekers et al., 2008].

Despite the growing use of DTC genome applications, there has been less focus on their security and privacy. Genomic data aggregation issues require special attention, as some companies allow individuals to publish high-density SNP profiles online, often alongside demographic and phenotypic data.

### VIII Challenges for Genome Privacy
While the full value of genome sequencing in routine care is yet to be realized, the decreasing cost and commoditization of these analyses are expected to transform medical practice. Data confidentiality and individual privacy will be crucial for the acceptance and widespread use of genomic information in healthcare systems. A clear demonstration of the clinical utility of genomics is needed for healthcare providers to fully embrace it.

### VIII.A Clinical Implementation
For genomics to be widely adopted in clinical settings, it must be integrated into existing healthcare structures. Demonstrating scientific validity and clinical utility is essential, but it is also necessary to present results in an intuitive and timely manner. Genomic data should be integrated into more efficient Electronic Health Records (EHRs) [Ury, 2013], which will enable secure storage and access, as well as provide decision support tools that do not require genomic expertise [Overby et al., 2013]. Several for-profit ventures are offering genome interpretation services to clinicians, hospitals, and individual consumers, suggesting that various models of interaction between healthcare providers, patients, and personal genomic data are likely to grow in the coming years.

Genetic education is another fundamental requirement for large-scale implementation of genomic medicine. Both healthcare providers and the general population need to be educated. Increased health and genetic literacy will help patients understand the risks and benefits of genomic-based medicine, enabling them to make informed decisions [McCarthy et al., 2013].

### VIII.B Consumer-Driven Genomics
The democratization of genomics, including facilitated access to large-scale personal and health-related data, brings its own set of data confidentiality issues. While medical and genetic information used to be accessible only through hospital or research laboratories, people can now obtain their genotyping or sequencing results through direct-to-consumer companies like 23andMe. On the research side, numerous participant-centric initiatives, such as OpenSNP and the Personal Genome Project, have been launched. As a result, genomic data is increasingly found outside the controlled environment of healthcare systems or research. Individual genetic results or aggregated datasets are often available on the Internet with minimal or no protection. While these crowd-based initiatives are exciting for their potential to stimulate biomedical research and empower individuals, they raise concerns about privacy risks, especially in the context of extensive information available on the Internet, including social networks.

### VIII.C Privacy and the Benefits of Genomic Data
Both a lack and an excess of privacy can hinder the expected benefits of genomics in healthcare and research. Efficient and secure handling of individual genotype and sequence data is central to the implementation of genomic medicine. Trust is at the core of any successful healthcare system, and any leakage of highly sensitive genomic information can raise concerns and opposition. Earning and maintaining trust is essential for hospitals and private companies dealing with genomics. There is a potential for a service industry focused on securing genomic data, either by providing ad hoc solutions or by fully supporting the storage and delivery of raw/interpreted sequence information. Various tools exist to mitigate these problems, as detailed in Section VII. Conversely, excessive privacy hurdles could slow down research and interfere with the large-scale adoption of genomics in clinical practice. When designing privacy-preserving solutions, security and privacy researchers should consider that most end-users are primarily interested in the clinical utility of test results.

Education is again a fundamental requirement for privacy protection. Bioinformatics curricula typically train students to maximize the information extracted from biological data, often without addressing security and privacy concerns. Computer scientists, while better trained in security, rarely have formal training in biology or genomics. Cross-fertilization between these disciplines is essential to address the challenges of genomic data protection effectively.

### VIII.D Acceptable Utility vs. Privacy of Genomic Data
The balance between acceptable utility and privacy of genomic data needs to be considered in context:

- **Healthcare**: Patient-level information must be as precise as possible. Any decrease in data accuracy must be avoided, especially in life-threatening situations. Security of electronic medical records and other health-related information is usually guaranteed through restricted access, such as intranet use, passwords, and card identification. However, since genetic testing is rarely urgent, privacy-preserving measures that slightly delay test results may be tolerable.
- **Research**: Research on complex trait genomics relies on large datasets for genotyping or sequencing association studies. To gain statistical power and detect meaningful associations, it is often necessary to merge many studies through meta-analyses, which can include data from hundreds of thousands of individuals. Some degree of noise is unavoidable due to non-uniform use of technological platforms, variations in genotyping, and differences in analysis pipelines. An interesting area of research is to determine whether differential privacy strategies (e.g., [Johnson and Shmatikov, 2013]) can be applied without compromising discovery.
- **Legal and Forensics**: DNA collection and similarity pattern searches in genomic data are used in criminal investigations and for legal purposes like paternity testing. The accuracy of test results is critical to avoid legal prejudice. Extremely stringent data protection must be ensured due to the highly sensitive nature of these cases.
- **Direct-to-Consumer Genomics**: Companies providing individual genomic data have a commercial incentive to protect customers' privacy to maintain trust and attract new customers. For example, 23andMe's webpage states: “Your personalized web account provides secure and easy access to your information, with multiple levels of encryption and security protocols protecting your personal information.” However, these measures are ineffective if individuals choose to reveal their full identity online along with their genetic information, putting their genome privacy (and that of their relatives) at risk, either knowingly (as in the case of Personal Genome Project participants) or out of naivety.

### IX Framework for Privacy-Preserving Handling of Genomic Data
In this section, we provide a general framework for security and privacy in the handling of genomic data, illustrated in Figure 9. The framework is divided into four categories: (i) healthcare, (ii) research, (iii) legal and forensics, and (iv) direct-to-consumer genomics. This classification is based on the most popular uses of genomic data, though the boundaries between these categories are blurred and there is significant overlap. For each category, we address the setting, threat model, and solutions and open problems. The setting provides the most general environment around the problem, and we do not discuss the possibility of outsourcing the computation, as our setting can be extended to involve third parties.

### IX.A Biospecimen
DNA is obtained in chemical form and then digitized. This cyber-physical nature of DNA creates unique challenges for its protection.

#### IX.A.1 Threat Model
In our threat model, the adversary is capable of:
- Obtaining DNA from an individual’s biological cells, either voluntarily (e.g., for research with informed consent) or involuntarily (e.g., leftover hairs or saliva on a coffee cup),
- Sequencing or genotyping the DNA from biospecimens,
- Interpreting the sequenced data to breach identity, disease, kinship, and other sensitive information,
- Linking the genomic data (or biospecimen) to the individual's identity, health record, or any arbitrary background information.

#### IX.A.2 Solutions and Open Problems
Legal protection is necessary to protect the biospecimen and the DNA in its chemical form. However, a solution to this problem is a subject of public policy and is outside the scope of this paper.

### IX.B Digitization: Sequencing/Genotyping

#### IX.B.1 Setting
A biospecimen is obtained by an agency (e.g., hospital) and is sequenced or genotyped either by the same agency or by an external agency (e.g., Illumina, 23andMe, etc.).

#### IX.B.2 Threat Model
Since a biospecimen is required for digitization, we assume the threat model discussed in Section IX.A.1, with the following extensions:
- The adversary has full control over the entire sequencing or genotyping infrastructure,
- The adversary can be honest-but-curious and attempt to learn partial or entire genomic data or any derived information,
- The adversary can be malicious and compromise the integrity of partial or entire genomic data.

#### IX.B.3 Solutions and Open Problems
Given the cyber-physical nature of DNA, technical measures alone are insufficient. Both legal and technical protections are required. An external agency cannot derive genomic data without a biospecimen, and legal protection is necessary to prevent misuse. Sequencing machines are expensive and manufactured by a limited number of companies. We envision a well-regulated process for manufacturing, procurement, and use of sequencing machines, with government regulations in place. The FDA already regulates the manufacturing of medical devices [Cheng, 2003]. Regular inspections would ensure compliance. Under such legal protections, sequencing machines could have a tamper-resistant trusted computing base (TCB) that outputs encrypted data, ensuring security even if the machine is compromised.
