of the human genome, or even 1% of it, cannot be handled by current PSI and
other SMC protocols. However, by exploiting domain knowledge, the compu-
tation time can be reduced to 6.8ms and network bandwidth usage to 6.5KB
by emulating the Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) chemical
test in software, which reduces the problem to ﬁnding the intersection between
two sets of size 25 [Baldi et al., 2011]. Subsequent work demonstrates a frame-
work for conducing such tests on a Android smartphone [Cristofaro et al., 2012].
Since the ideal output of privacy-preserving paternity test should be yes or no,
it cannot be obtained using custom PSI protocols, whereas generic garbled cir-
cuit based protocols can be easily modiﬁed to add this capability [Huang et al.,
2011, 2012].
Criminal forensics. rules enable law enforcement agencies to have unlimited
access to the complete DNA record database of millions of individuals, usually of
convicted criminals (e.g., CODIS12 in the US). The motivation behind creating
such a database is to ﬁnd a record that matches the DNA evidence from a
crime scene. Yet, providing unlimited access to law enforcement agencies is
unnecessary and may open the system to abuse. Cryptographic approaches
have been developed to preserve the privacy of the records that fail to match
the evidence from the crime scene [Bohannon et al., 2000]. Speciﬁcally, DNA
records can be encrypted using a key that depends upon certain tests, such that
when DNA is collected from a crime scene, the scheme will only allow decryption
of the records that match the evidence.
Finally, partial homomorphic encryption can be used for privacy-preserving
matching of Short Tandem Repeat (STR) DNA proﬁles in honest-but-curious
model [Bruekers et al., 2008]. Such protocols (described in VII.D) are useful for
identity, paternity, ancestry and forensic tests.
VII.D Direct-to-consumer (DTC)
Many DTC companies provide genealogy and ancestry testing. Cryptographic
schemes can be used to conduct those tests in privacy-preserving fashion. Partial
homomorphic encryption can be cleverly used on STR proﬁles of individuals to
conduct (i) common ancestor testing based on the Y chromosome, (ii) paternity
test with one parent, (iii) paternity test with two parents, and (iv) identity
testing [Bruekers et al., 2008].
Despite the increasing use of DTC genome applications, less focus has been
given to the security and privacy of this domain. In particular, genomic data ag-
gregation issues require special attention because some companies allow people
to publish high-density SNP proﬁles online in combination with demographic
and phenotypic data.

VIII Challenges for Genome Privacy
While the value of genome sequencing in routine care has yet to be fully demon-
strated, it is anticipated that the plummeting cost and commoditization of these
analyses will change the practice of medicine. Data conﬁdentiality and individ-
ual privacy will be central to the acceptance and widespread usage of genomic in-
formation by healthcare systems. However, a clear demonstration of the clinical
usefulness of genomics is ﬁrst needed for doctors and other healthcare providers
to fully embrace genomics and privacy.
VIII.A Clinical Implementation
In order for genomics to be widely adopted in the clinical world, it must be wo-
ven into existing healthcare structures. The demonstration of scientiﬁc validity
and clinical utility of genomic testing is an obvious prerequisite, but will not
be suﬃcient if results are not brought to clinicians in an intuitive and timely
manner. In particular, genomic data will have to be integrated into more ef-
ﬁcient EHRs [Ury, 2013]. These will enable storage and access to data in a
secure way, but will also provide appropriate decision support tools that do not
require genomic expertise [Overby et al., 2013]. A number of for-proﬁt ventures
are oﬀering genome interpretation services to clinicians and hospitals, as well as
individual consumers. As such, various models of interactions between health
care providers, patients and their personal genomic data are thus likely to grow
in the following years.
Another fundamental requirement for large-scale implementation of genomic
medicine is genetic education. A strong eﬀort is needed here, oriented both to-
ward healthcare providers and the general population. An increased level of
health and genetic literacy will be critical to put patients in a position where
they understand the risks and beneﬁts of genomic-based medicine, and as a
consequence can make informed decisions. Up until now, genetic information
has been put into context for patients undergoing genetic testing by profes-
sionals (genetic counselors or geneticists), most often in the highly specialized
environment of a genetic division and in the context of Mendelian diseases or
reproductive counseling. Because genomics will become ever more an integra-
tive part of medicine, alternative models must be considered in which primary
health care providers will have to play a central role [McCarthy et al., 2013].
VIII.B Consumer-driven Genomics
An unprecedented aspect of contemporary genomics that comes with its own set
of issues for data conﬁdentiality is democratization, including facilitated access
to large-scale personal, health-related data. Whereas medical and genetic in-
formation used to be obtainable only through hospital or research laboratories,
people can now access their own genotyping or sequencing results through direct-
to-consumer companies such as 23andMe, as discussed before. On the research
25
side, numerous participant-centric initiatives have recently been launched (no-
tably by citizens’ networks such as OpenSNP and the Personal Genome Project).
As a result, genomic data are increasingly found outside the controlled cocoon
of healthcare systems or research. In particular, individual genetic results or
aggregated datasets are available on the Internet, often with non-existent or
minimal protection. On one hand, these crowd-based initiatives are very excit-
ing, because they have the potential to stimulate biomedical research, accelerate
discoveries and empower individuals. Yet, on the other hand, they raise a num-
ber of concerns about potential privacy risks (as highlighted in Section IX). For
example, privacy risks must here be assessed in the context of the extensive na-
ture of information available on the Internet (including online social networks),
and not only within the narrower conﬁnes of genomic research or clinical care
delivery.
VIII.C Privacy and the Beneﬁts of Genomic Data
It is important to note that both a lack and an excess of privacy have the po-
tential to derail the expected beneﬁts of genomics in healthcare and research.
On one hand, the eﬃcient and secured handling of individual genotype and se-
quence data will be central to the implementation of genomic medicine. The
Hippocratic Oath remains a pillar of medical deontology and one of the few
stable concepts in the highly tumultuous history of medical practice. Trust is
at the core of any successful healthcare system: any leakage of highly sensitive
genomic information may raise concerns and opposition in the population and
among political decision makers. Earning and conserving trust is essential for
hospitals and private companies that deal with genomics. As a result, there
is a potential for a service industry securing genomic data, either by providing
ad hoc solutions or by fully supporting storage and delivery of raw/interpreted
sequence information. Fortunately, as detailed in Section VII, there exists a
variety of tools that can mitigate the problem. On the other hand, an excess of
privacy-related hurdles could slow down research and interfere with large-scale
adoption of genomics in clinical practice. When designing privacy-preserving so-
lutions for genomic data, security and privacy researchers should keep in mind
that most end-users are not familiar with computer science and are almost ex-
clusively interested in the clinical utility of test results.
Education is again a fundamental requirement for privacy protection. How-
ever, in bioinformatics curricula, students are trained to maximize the infor-
mation to be extracted from (biological) data. Usually, such curricula do not
address security and privacy concerns, because adversarial scenarios are out of
their scope. Conversely, computer scientists rarely have formal training in bi-
ology, let alone genomics. But, they are better and better trained in security,
notably because of the formidable challenge raised by the numerous vulnerabil-
ities of the Internet. Consequently, to properly address the concerns about ge-
nomic data protection, there is a clear and strong potential of cross-fertilization
between these two disciplines.
26
VIII.D Acceptable Utility vs. Privacy of Genomic Data
The balance between acceptable utility and privacy of genomic data needs to
be considered in context.
Healthcare: patient-level information must be as precise as possible. Be-
cause genomic data is used here to support clinical decision, including in life-
threatening situations, any decrease in data accuracy must be avoided. Security
of electronic medical records and other health-related information is therefore
most often guaranteed through restricted access (e.g., intranet use, password
and card identiﬁcation) to unmodiﬁed data. It is important to note, however,
that genetic testing is rarely urgent, and that privacy-preserving measures that
would slightly delay a test result could be tolerated.
Research: research on complex trait genomics relies on large datasets on which
genotyping or sequencing association studies can be run. To gain statistical
power and detect meaningful associations, it is often necessary to merge many
such studies through meta-analyses that can include data from hundreds of
thousands of individuals. Due to non-uniform use of technological platforms, to
variation in time and place of genotyping, and to diﬀerences in analysis pipelines,
some degree of noise is then unavoidable. An interesting avenue for research is
here to empirically determine whether diﬀerential privacy strategies (e.g., [John-
son and Shmatikov, 2013]) can be applied without compromising discovery.
Legal and forensics: DNA collection and search for similarity pattern in ge-
nomic data are used in criminal investigations and for other legal purposes like
paternity testing. The accuracy of any test result is here again an absolute
requirement to avoid legal prejudice. Extremely stringent data protection must
also be ensured due to the highly sensitive nature of such cases.
Direct-to-consumer genomics: companies providing individual genomic data
have a clear commercial incentive to protect customers’ privacy, in order to
maintain trust and gain new customers. For example, the 23andMe webpage
states: “Your personalized web account provides secure and easy access to your
information, with multiple levels of encryption and security protocols protecting
your personal information.” Of course, these measures are ineﬀective when in-
dividuals choose to unveil their full identity online together with their genetic
information, thereby putting their genome privacy (and one of their relatives) at
risk, either knowingly (as in the case of Personal Genome Project participants)
or out of naivety.
IX Framework for Privacy-Preserving handling
of Genomic data
In this section, we provide a general framework for security and privacy in the
handling of genomic data. The framework is illustrated in Figure 9. As has been
done throughout this SoK, we divide the framework into four categories: (i)
healthcare, (ii) research, (iii) legal and forensics, and (iv) direct-to-consumer
genomics. This classiﬁcation is based on the most popular uses of genomic
27
Figure 9: Genomic data handling framework: DNA is extracted from an individual’s
tissue or cells. DNA is digitized either using sequencing (to obtain Whole Genome
Sequence (WGS) or Whole Exome Sequence (WES)) or genotyping (to obtain variants
(usually only SNPs)). Reads obtained from sequencing are aligned to form the com-
plete genome, while genotyped variants are digitized from the microchip array directly.
Read data may be stored for later analysis. The aligned genome can be either stored
in raw form or compressed form (variations from a reference human genome). Medical
tests and other types of computation shown in the ﬁgure can be performed either on
raw aligned genome or just on variants. Possible outputs of computation are shown.
Output depends on the type of computation and in some cases there is no output. The
ﬁgure shows the genomic data aggregation problem caused by recreational genomics
services. The ﬁgure is divided into three sections based on fundamental limitations
of legal and technical measures for the protection of genomic data. Legal protection
is required for the left section, legal as well as technical protection is required for the
middle section, while, in theory, technical solutions would suﬃce for the protection of
the right section. The legend shows which blocks are associated with diﬀerent uses of
genomic data. We use the word “patient” in this paper to mean someone who’s genome
is sequenced or genotyped and not necessarily a sick person.
data; however, we recognize that the boundaries between these categories are
blurred and there is signiﬁcant overlap. For each of these we address setting,
threat model, and solutions and open problems. The setting provides the most
general environment around the problem (e.g., we do not discuss the possibility
of outsourcing the computation as one can easily extend our setting to another
one involving a third party).
28
IX.A Biospecimen
DNA is obtained in chemical form and then digitized. This cyber-physical
nature of DNA creates unique challenges for its protection.
IX.A.1 Threat Model
In our threat model, the adversary is capable of (i) obtaining DNA from an
individual’s biological cells either voluntarily (e.g., for research with informed
consent) or involuntarily (e.g., leftover hairs or saliva on a coﬀee cup), (ii)
sequencing or genotyping the DNA from biospecimen, (iii) interpreting the se-
quenced data to breach identity, disease, kinship, and any other sensitive in-
formation, and (iv) linking the genomic data (or biospecimen) to the identity,
health record, or any arbitrary background information about the individual.
IX.A.2 Solutions and Open Problems
Legal protection is necessary to protect the biospecimen and the DNA (in its
chemical form). However, a solution to this problem is a subject of public
policy and is outside the scope of this paper.
IX.B Digitization: Sequencing/Genotyping
IX.B.1 Setting
A biospecimen is obtained by an agency (e.g., hospital) and is sequenced or
genotyped either by the same agency or by an external agency (e.g., Illumina,
23andMe etc.).
IX.B.2 Threat Model
Since a biospecimen is required for digitization, we assume the threat model
discussed in Section IX.A.1 with the following extensions: (i) the adversary
has full control over the entire sequencing or genotyping infrastructure, (ii) the
adversary can be honest-but-curious and can attempt to learn partial or entire
genomic data or any information derived from the genomic data, and (iii) the
adversary can be malicious and can compromise the integrity of partial or entire
genomic data.
IX.B.3 Solutions and Open Problems
Given the cyber-physical nature of DNA, it is not possible to address this is-
sue with technical measures alone. Both legal and technical protections are
required to protect against this threat. An external agency cannot derive ge-
nomic data without a biospecimen, and legal protection is required to prevent
misuse. Sequencing machines are expensive and are manufactured by a limited
number of companies. We envision a well-regulated process for the manufactur-
ing, procurement and use of sequencing machines and government regulations
29
in place for it. The FDA already regulates the manufacturing of medical de-
vices13 [Cheng, 2003]. Regular inspections would check for compliance. Under
such legal protections, sequencing machines could have tamper resistant trusted
computing base (TCB) that could output encrypted data so even the sequenc-
