Hello,
I experiencing similar issue as #7049 .
I raised this issue segmentio/nightmare#894 as well. But I think it has
nothing to do with nightmare, since after installing 32 bit version of
electron it seems that this issue has disappeared. It's not an emergency for
me or something, since I have no problem using 32bit version, just though you
guys might want to know about it.
segmentio/nightmare#894 has more description, don't want to duplicate it. If
you need more information or something, let me know. Also I might mention that
I didn't had this issue on debian 8, it's just after I installed linux mint
18, so it might be something with linux kernel maybe, since mint uses newest
version?
Cheers
