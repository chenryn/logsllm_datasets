Hello,

I am experiencing a similar issue to #7049. I also reported this problem in segmentio/nightmare#894. However, I believe the issue is not related to Nightmare, as it seems to have been resolved after I installed the 32-bit version of Electron.

This is not an urgent matter for me, as I can use the 32-bit version without any issues. I just wanted to bring this to your attention. For more detailed information, please refer to the description in segmentio/nightmare#894, as I do not want to duplicate the information here. If you require any additional details or further clarification, feel free to let me know.

Additionally, I did not encounter this issue on Debian 8; it only appeared after I installed Linux Mint 18. Therefore, it might be related to the Linux kernel, as Mint uses a newer version.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
