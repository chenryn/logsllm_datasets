I am looking at broadcast.jl and wondering what magic is occurring for me to
use ".+" in an expression and have it work but when I type it by itself it
gives an error.
Why is it not like an addition where it's just a generic function?
The goal of my exploration is to try and document the ".+" and ".*"
broadcasting ability.
