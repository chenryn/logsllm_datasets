# I want the ability to add a single full screen zone across multiple displays
in a multi-monitor configuration
I use Visual Studio across 2 x 4K 32" monitors. I want to maximize the
application across both displays, and treat both displays as a single
screen/zone. Currently, I need to open the app, and manually align
TopLeft/BottomRight.
The application would act as if it had been maximized (currently maximizing an
app in a dual display configuration means it maximizes to a single screen). I
can, of course, configure the NVidia display driver to appear as a single
display device - but this gets a bit jenky when you introduce DisplayPort
sleep/power/disconnection issues, and I don't want a single display for all
applications - only this one (and maybe Davinci Resolve, when I'm doing a bit
of video edition)
