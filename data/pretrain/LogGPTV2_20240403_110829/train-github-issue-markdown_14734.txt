### Request for a Full-Screen Zone Across Multiple Displays

**Use Case:**
I use Visual Studio across two 4K 32-inch monitors in a multi-monitor setup. I would like to maximize the application across both displays, treating them as a single, unified screen or zone.

**Current Situation:**
Currently, when I maximize an application in a dual-display configuration, it only maximizes to a single screen. To achieve a full-screen experience across both monitors, I have to manually align the application's top-left and bottom-right corners, which is cumbersome and time-consuming.

**Desired Functionality:**
I would like the ability to add a single full-screen zone that spans both monitors. This would allow the application to act as if it had been maximized to a single, larger display. 

**Alternative Solutions:**
I am aware that I can configure the NVIDIA display driver to treat both monitors as a single display device. However, this approach has several drawbacks:
- It can cause issues with DisplayPort sleep, power, and disconnection.
- It affects all applications, whereas I only want this behavior for specific applications (e.g., Visual Studio and DaVinci Resolve).

**Summary:**
In summary, I am looking for a feature that allows me to create a full-screen zone across multiple monitors, specifically for certain applications, without having to rely on global display settings that can introduce other problems.
