1) Comparison: In order to illustrate the effectiveness of our method, we compare the accuracy and efficiency of logNG with the existing four log parsing methods, including three offline log parsers and one online log parser. The brief infor-mation of these log parsing methods is shown in “Table. I”, and is introduced in Section II.TABLE I 
FIVE COMPARISON METHODS FOR EXPERIMENTS
| Log Parser | Pattern | Method |
|---|---|---|
| LKE |Offline |Clusterinig |
| LogMine |Offline |Clusterinig |
| MoLFI |Offline |Evolutionary Algorithms |
| SHISO |Online |Clusterinig |2) Log Data Set: The LogPai team [14] provides con-venience to researchers in the industry and academia. They store large log data sets from different systems on their Loghub2[29]. These systems include distributed systems, supercomputers, mobile systems, independent software and server applications. Loghub collected a total of 440 million log messages with a size of 77GB, which is now the largest col-lection of log data sets [14]. We will conduct experiments on 10 public data sets provided by the LogPai team. For each data set, the LogPai team randomly selected 2000 log messages and manually marked the log template corresponding to each log message as the groud-truth for our evaluation. The information of these data sets is listed in “Table. II”. The Events(2k) table shows the number of events in 2000 log messages.2
3) Evaluation Metric: We will prove the effectiveness from the perspectives of parsing accuracy (PA). F-measure is a weighted harmonic average of precision and recall. It is a commonly used evaluation standard and is often used to evaluate the quality of classification models. But PA is a more stringent metric than F-measure. [13] defined PA as the ratio of the number of log messages correctly parsed to the total number of log messages. If and only if the log Templates generated is exactly the same as ground truth, we think it is parsed correctly. Even if there is only one log message that does not match correctly, we still think that the parsing of the log template has failed.4) Experimental Environment: All our experiments were performed on a Linux server running 64-bit Centos 7.4, equipped with 16-core Intel(R) Xeon(R) Silver 4216 CPU @ 2.10GHz and 32GB DDR4 2666. We support the implemen-tation of logNG in Python 3.8.6. We run each experiment 10 times to get the average value to avoid bias.
B. Result Analysis1) Effectiveness: Accuracy shows the ability of the log parser to correctly match the raw log message with the log template. A study [30] shows that accurate parsing of log messages into templates is essential for many log processing methods, and parsing errors are likely to cause the performance of subsequent downstream tasks to degrade. We compare logNG with 4 log parsing methods, including 3 offline methods and 1 online methods. Generally speaking, the offline method will be more accurate than the online method, because the| Time(sec) | 100
