It appears that there is an outdated tutorial page available at [this link](https://matplotlib.org/users/beginner.html). The page still displays the old banner, "Matplotlib 2.0.0rc2 is available â€“ Install the release candidate now!" Although it may not be directly accessible from the main website, it still appears in Google search results.

To improve clarity and ensure users find the most up-to-date information, it would be beneficial to either update this page or remove it if it is no longer relevant. Additionally, you might want to check for other outdated pages and redirect them to the current tutorials or documentation.
