ABSTRACT
From pencils to commercial aircraft, every man-made object must
be designed and manufactured. When it is cheaper or easier to steal a
design or a manufacturing process speciﬁcation than to invent one’s
own, the incentive for theft is present. As more and more manufac-
turing data comes online, incidents of such theft are increasing.
In this paper, we present a side-channel attack on manufacturing
equipment that reveals both the form of a product and its manufac-
turing process, i.e., exactly how it is made. In the attack, a human
deliberately or accidentally places an attack-enabled phone close
to the equipment or makes or receives a phone call on any phone
nearby. The phone executing the attack records audio and, optional-
ly, magnetometer data. We present a method of reconstructing the
product’s form and manufacturing process from the captured data,
based on machine learning, signal processing, and human assistance.
We demonstrate the attack on a 3D printer and a CNC mill, each
with its own acoustic signature, and discuss the commonalities in the
sensor data captured for these two different machines. We compare
the quality of the data captured with a variety of smartphone models.
Capturing data from the 3D printer, we reproduce the form and
process information of objects previously unknown to the recon-
structors. On average, our accuracy is within 1 mm in reconstructing
the length of a line segment in a fabricated object’s shape and within
1 degree in determining an angle in a fabricated object’s shape.
We conclude with recommendations for defending against these
attacks.

INTRODUCTION
Hackers have noticed the large amount of valuable information
available in the cyber-physical systems on manufacturing factory
ﬂoors. In addition to straightforward data theft, adversaries can, in
theory, take advantage of simple yet effective side-channel attacks
based on electromagnetic leaks, acoustic emissions, timing infor-
mation, light emission, and power consumption [5, 10, 12, 21, 24,
27]. The leaked information can be used to compromise systems
and to obtain or infer sensitive data. For example, researchers ha-
ve successfully partially compromised Difﬁe-Hellman exponents,
factored RSA keys, and broken other cryptosystems by measuring
the amount of time required to perform private key operations [11,
17, 18]. Defending against side-channel attacks requires a level of
security more advanced and more comprehensive than updating an
operating system or installing security patches. Despite the efﬁcacy
of ﬁrewalls and anti-virus software, manufacturers currently have
no effective way to protect against information leakage from their
factory ﬂoor equipment.

Figure 1: The high level system and attack model. Designs and
raw materials are the inputs to a manufacturing process that
produces completed parts. By placing phone sensors near the
manufacturing process and analyzing the data they collect, the
side-channel attack reconstructs the design and the manufactu-
ring process.
In a modern factory, nearly everyone on the manufacturing ﬂoor
carries a smartphone or similar electronic device. These devices
are programmable and come with a growing number of embedded
sensors, including a microphone, accelerometer, magnetometer, gy-
roscope, GPS, and camera. These sensors can capture side-channel
information regardless of the level of information technology or
security sophistication on the factory ﬂoor and inside the manufac-
turing equipment.
We present a novel attack in which a phone’s sensors are de-
liberately or inadvertently used to capture sensitive information

Traditional high-value discrete manufacturing relies heavily on
subtractive processes: equipment is used to cut, chip, and grind away
excess material to form the desired product. Interest is high in the
potential for new additive manufacturing processes, which deposit
material layer by layer to form objects. Our attack and reconstruc-
tion methods target both additive and subtractive manufacturing,
represented in our experiments by a 3D printer and CNC mill, re-
spectively.
The manufacturing sector has a rich history of research on obtai-
ning information about a manufacturing process from its acoustic
emissions. Recordings have been used to judge parameters inclu-
ding tool wear, tool breakage, chatter, chip formation mechanism,
material removal regime, sheet metal material hardness, sheet metal
thickness, and the identity of the metal or alloy being machined [6,
9, 13, 16, 19, 20, 22]. Our reconstruction methods use acoustic
information for less benign purposes.
Cyberattacks on the manufacturing sector typically fall into one
of three categories: theft of intellectual property or processes, dis-
ruption of manufacturing operations, or sabotage of products or
reputation [28]. These cyberattacks are already widespread: in 2014,
21% of manufacturers reported a loss of intellectual property (IP) [2].
These observed losses may be the tip of the iceberg, as 69% of all
2012 data breaches were carried out within a few hours, but 64% of
breaches took months or years to detect [23]. Further, the number of
manufacturing cyberattacks is growing fast: the Industrial Control
Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT), operated
by the US Department of Homeland Security, responded to 50%
more incidents in the manufacturing sector in 2015 than in 2014 [14,
15].
IP theft is by far the most common motive of attackers, who can
target product design information, manufacturing process informati-
on, or both. The advantage of stealing design information is clear,
but many manufacturers’ competitive advantage largely lies in the
fact that they know how to manufacture a given design better, fas-
ter, or cheaper than their competitors do. Process information may
include the details of what materials are used and what machines
are used and in what order, plus all the settings of those machines:
which tool head was used, its rotation rate, the material feed rate,
and so forth.
When a phone illicitly records data on the factory ﬂoor, its owner
could be intentionally carrying out corporate espionage, or she
could be an unwitting dupe with a compromised application or even
the innocent maker or receiver of a phone call at an ill-advised
moment. In these latter cases, she may have been targeted by a
third party such as a rival manufacturer, or swept up in a large net
cast by a well-ﬁnanced backer of economic espionage such as a
nation-state. For example, a nation-state hacker might be seeking to
increase the competitiveness of its manufacturing sector, gain the
ability to manufacture objects viewed as important for the national
interest, or learn about its rivals’ capabilities and activities. For
example, such motivations may have been behind the theft of the
design for Lockheed Martin’s US F-35 Lightning II ﬁghter jet,
stolen by hackers allegedly supported by the Chinese government1.
The US and Israeli governments allegedly unleashed STUXNET,
which targeted the programmable logic controllers of Iran’s nuclear
centrifuges, causing them to self-destruct. Allegedly, the Chinese
government has ﬁnanced the large-scale theft of industrial IP [1] and
the Iranian government has sponsored IT intrusions overseas [3]. The
US and Israeli governments have been attributed as potential sources

from manufacturing equipment, as shown in Figure 1. We capture
the relevant sensor data by deliberately or accidentally placing an
attack-enabled phone close to, on top of, or inside a piece of manu-
facturing equipment while the machinery is fabricating the target
object. Figure 2 shows this setup. Alternatively, the relevant audio
can be recorded by deliberately or accidentally making or receiving
a phone call while standing next to the machinery or by installing
malware on any other nearby device that has a microphone.
We provide methods that use the captured data to reconstruct a
model of the object being manufactured along with its manufactu-
ring process parameters. We demonstrate the attack on both additive
and subtractive manufacturing using a 3D printer and a CNC mill.
We demonstrate the reconstruction process with a 3D printer and
discuss ways to reduce the attack’s effectiveness.
Contributions. We outline the paper’s contributions below:
• New techniques. We show that the data captured by acoustic
and magnetic sensors embedded in a phone can be used to
identify speciﬁc manufacturing equipment and manufacturing
processes, including reconstructing manufactured objects and
reproducing the processes used to make them.
• New understanding. We demonstrate the feasibility of app-
lying side-channel attacks to manufacturing equipment: in
particular, 3D printers and CNC mills. The fundamentally dif-
ferent operating modes of these two types of manufacturing
equipment indicate that the attack may be broadly applicable
across many types of manufacturing equipment.
• Implementation and evaluation of reconstruction method. We
provide a method for reconstructing manufactured objects
and the processes used to make them; the method is based
on machine learning and signal processing. We show that the
method accurately reconstructs previously unseen objects.
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides background
information and discusses the motivations of potential attackers.
Section 3 describes the attack model and reconstruction method.
Section 4 provides experimental results, and Section 5 offers recom-
mendations for defending against the attacks and raising the cost of
reconstruction.

awareness of Iran’s technical capabilities and activities [26]. In
addition to gathering ﬁles likely to contain technical information,
Flame collected data from the sensors of the devices it infected.
Our approach to factory ﬂoor snooping leverages the fact that
sensor spyware could spread to anyone’s phone and export the data
it captures for subsequent analysis and reconstruction of manufactu-
ring activities. While Flame targeted Windows PCs, similar malware
can be constructed for phone applications. For example, Cai et al. [7]
highlight the capabilities of modern mobile devices for snooping
on users by snifﬁng their smartphone’s sensors. For example, the
Shedun Android malware provides a framework for automatical-
ly downloading and installing undesired new applications and for
serving potentially malicious adware; security researchers consider
Shedun nearly impossible to remove completely. DroidKungFu, tar-
geted at users in China, offers similar capabilities for the automatic
installation of malicious new applications. With over a thousand
new infections per day as of this writing, malware like Shedun and
DroidKungFu provides a channel to reach factory employees. The
malware may even be present when a phone is ﬁrst purchased; In-
dian phone manufacturer Gionee has been accused of this2. Once
a malicious app has been installed, its recording function could be
activated by a geofence around the factory, and could run in the
background of another app with appropriate permissions, such as a
game.
Al Faruque et al. [4] recognized that thermal side channels can be
used to infer activities taking place inside a 3D printer. Closer to our
work, they also investigated the possibility of attacking manufac-
turing machinery via audio recordings. They placed a microphone
close to additive manufacturing equipment to record fabrication runs,
then used machine learning to reconstruct the low-level instructi-
ons (G-code) used to manufacture the object, with an accuracy of
89.72% in reproducing the as-designed object’s perimeter. While Al
Faruque et al. used a high-quality microphone located in a speciﬁc
location in a controlled environment, our work uses ordinary mobile
phones that may be located anywhere near the machine or in the
user’s hand and can target machinery located in any environment,
including public fabrication labs. We employ different reconstruc-
tion methods from Al Faruque et al., and our experiments show
that we reconstruct perimeters more accurately; however, we also
suggest different measures of accuracy that we believe to be more
revealing. A ﬁnal difference is that because G-code is quite low
level, reproducing the same object on a different model or type of
machine requires nontrivial extra work to rewrite the G-code. For
that reason, we provide a higher-level reconstruction suitable for
translation into G-code for a variety of machines.
3. RECONSTRUCTION
Different fabrication machines have different process parameters.
For example, a grinding wheel can run at different speeds. The
wheel could be touching the object being made, or could be away
from it, e.g., while repositioning the wheel to a different location on
the object. The object could be moving past the wheel at different
rates. The same machine could use grinding wheels with different
levels of grit. To accurately reproduce a manufacturing process, we
need to specify the values for all of its parameters.
As no single paper can reconstruct all process parameters for all
major types of equipment, we focus on key parameters related to the
location of the tool head with respect to the object being fabricated
and its direction of travel. These location and direction parameters
