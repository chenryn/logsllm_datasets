**Abstract:**
From simple pencils to complex commercial aircraft, every man-made object must be designed and manufactured. When it is cheaper or easier to steal a design or manufacturing process specification than to create one, the incentive for theft is significant. As more manufacturing data moves online, incidents of such theft are increasing.

In this paper, we present a side-channel attack on manufacturing equipment that reveals both the form of a product and its manufacturing process. The attack involves a human deliberately or accidentally placing an attack-enabled phone near the equipment or making or receiving a phone call nearby. The phone records audio and, optionally, magnetometer data. We present a method to reconstruct the product's form and manufacturing process from the captured data using machine learning, signal processing, and human assistance. We demonstrate the attack on a 3D printer and a CNC mill, each with its own acoustic signature, and discuss the commonalities in the sensor data captured for these two different machines. We compare the quality of the data captured with various smartphone models.

Our experiments show that we can reproduce the form and process information of objects previously unknown to the reconstructors. On average, our accuracy is within 1 mm in reconstructing the length of a line segment in a fabricated object’s shape and within 1 degree in determining an angle in a fabricated object’s shape. We conclude with recommendations for defending against these attacks.

## 1. Introduction
Hackers have recognized the valuable information available in the cyber-physical systems on manufacturing factory floors. In addition to straightforward data theft, adversaries can exploit side-channel attacks based on electromagnetic leaks, acoustic emissions, timing information, light emission, and power consumption. Leaked information can be used to compromise systems and obtain or infer sensitive data. For example, researchers have successfully compromised cryptographic systems by measuring the time required for private key operations. Defending against side-channel attacks requires advanced and comprehensive security measures beyond updating operating systems or installing security patches. Despite the efficacy of firewalls and anti-virus software, manufacturers currently lack effective ways to protect against information leakage from their factory floor equipment.

## 2. Background
Traditional high-value discrete manufacturing relies heavily on subtractive processes, where excess material is cut, chipped, and ground away to form the desired product. There is growing interest in additive manufacturing processes, which deposit material layer by layer. Our attack and reconstruction methods target both additive and subtractive manufacturing, represented in our experiments by a 3D printer and a CNC mill, respectively.

The manufacturing sector has a rich history of research on obtaining information about a manufacturing process from its acoustic emissions. Recordings have been used to judge parameters including tool wear, tool breakage, chatter, chip formation, material removal, sheet metal hardness, thickness, and the identity of the metal or alloy being machined. Our reconstruction methods use acoustic information for less benign purposes.

Cyberattacks on the manufacturing sector typically fall into three categories: theft of intellectual property (IP) or processes, disruption of manufacturing operations, or sabotage of products or reputation. These attacks are already widespread, with 21% of manufacturers reporting IP loss in 2014. The number of manufacturing cyberattacks is growing fast, with the Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) responding to 50% more incidents in 2015 than in 2014.

IP theft is the most common motive, targeting product design information, manufacturing process information, or both. The advantage of stealing design information is clear, but many manufacturers' competitive advantage lies in their ability to manufacture a given design better, faster, or cheaper than their competitors. Process information may include details of materials, machines, and settings.

When a phone illicitly records data on the factory floor, the owner could be intentionally carrying out corporate espionage, or they could be an unwitting dupe with a compromised application or even the innocent maker or receiver of a phone call at an ill-advised moment. In these cases, they may have been targeted by a third party such as a rival manufacturer or swept up in a large net cast by a well-financed backer of economic espionage, such as a nation-state.

For example, a nation-state hacker might seek to increase the competitiveness of its manufacturing sector, gain the ability to manufacture objects important for national interests, or learn about rivals' capabilities and activities. Such motivations may have been behind the theft of the design for Lockheed Martin’s US F-35 Lightning II fighter jet, allegedly stolen by hackers supported by the Chinese government.

We provide methods to use the captured data to reconstruct a model of the object being manufactured along with its manufacturing process parameters. We demonstrate the attack on both additive and subtractive manufacturing using a 3D printer and a CNC mill. We also discuss ways to reduce the attack's effectiveness.

### Contributions
- **New Techniques:** We show that data captured by acoustic and magnetic sensors in a phone can be used to identify specific manufacturing equipment and processes, including reconstructing manufactured objects and reproducing the processes used to make them.
- **New Understanding:** We demonstrate the feasibility of applying side-channel attacks to manufacturing equipment, specifically 3D printers and CNC mills. The fundamentally different operating modes of these two types of equipment indicate that the attack may be broadly applicable across many types of manufacturing equipment.
- **Implementation and Evaluation:** We provide a method for reconstructing manufactured objects and the processes used to make them, based on machine learning and signal processing. Our experiments show that the method accurately reconstructs previously unseen objects.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides background information and discusses the motivations of potential attackers. Section 3 describes the attack model and reconstruction method. Section 4 provides experimental results, and Section 5 offers recommendations for defending against the attacks and raising the cost of reconstruction.

## 3. Reconstruction
Different fabrication machines have different process parameters. For example, a grinding wheel can run at different speeds, touch the object, or reposition itself. The object can move past the wheel at different rates, and the same machine can use grinding wheels with different levels of grit. To accurately reproduce a manufacturing process, we need to specify the values for all of its parameters.

We focus on key parameters related to the location of the tool head with respect to the object being fabricated and its direction of travel. These parameters are crucial for accurate reconstruction.
