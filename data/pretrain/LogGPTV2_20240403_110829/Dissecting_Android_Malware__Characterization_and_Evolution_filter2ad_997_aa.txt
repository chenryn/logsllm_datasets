Abstract—The popularity and adoption of smartphones has
greatly stimulated the spread of mobile malware, especially on
the popular platforms such as Android. In light of their rapid
growth, there is a pressing need to develop effective solutions.
However, our defense capability is largely constrained by the
limited understanding of these emerging mobile malware and
the lack of timely access to related samples.
In this paper, we focus on the Android platform and
aim to systematize or characterize existing Android malware.
Particularly, with more than one year effort, we have managed
to collect more than 1,200 malware samples that cover the
majority of existing Android malware families, ranging from
their debut in August 2010 to recent ones in October 2011.
In addition, we systematically characterize them from various
aspects, including their installation methods, activation mech-
anisms as well as the nature of carried malicious payloads.
The characterization and a subsequent evolution-based study
of representative families reveal that they are evolving rapidly
to circumvent the detection from existing mobile anti-virus
software. Based on the evaluation with four representative
mobile security software, our experiments show that the best
case detects 79.6% of them while the worst case detects only
20.2% in our dataset. These results clearly call for the need to
better develop next-generation anti-mobile-malware solutions.

I. INTRODUCTION
In recent years, there is an explosive growth in smartphone
sales and adoption. According to CNN [1], smartphone
shipments have tripled in the past three years (from 40
million to about 120 million). Unfortunately, the increasing
adoption of smartphones comes with the growing prevalence
of mobile malware. As the most popular mobile platform,
Google’s Android overtook others (e.g., Symbian) to become
the top mobile malware platform. It has been highlighted
[2] that “among all mobile malware, the share of Android-
based malware is higher than 46% and still growing rapidly.”
Another recent report also alerts that there is “400 percent
increase in Android-based malware since summer 2010” [3].
Given the rampant growth of Android malware, there is a
pressing need to effectively mitigate or defend against them.
However, without an insightful understanding of them, it is
hard to imagine that an effective mitigation solution can be
practically developed. To make matters worse, the research
community at large is still constrained by the lack of a
comprehensive mobile malware dataset to start with.
The goals and contributions of this paper are three-
fold. First, we fulﬁl the need by presenting the ﬁrst large
collection of 1260 Android malware samples1 in 49 different
malware families, which covers the majority of existing
Android malware, ranging from their debut in August 2010
to recent ones in October 2011. The dataset is accumulated
from more than one year effort in collecting related malware
samples,
including manual or automated crawling from
a variety of Android Markets. To better mitigate mobile
malware threats, we will release the entire dataset to the
research community at http://malgenomeproject.org/.2
Second, based on the collected malware samples, we
perform a timeline analysis of their discovery and thoroughly
characterize them based on their detailed behavior break-
down, including the installation, activation, and payloads.
The timeline analysis is instrumental to revealing major
outbreaks of certain Android malware in the wild while the
detailed breakdown and characterization of existing Android
malware is helpful to better understand them and shed light
on possible defenses.
Speciﬁcally, in our 1260 malware samples, we ﬁnd that
1083 of them (or 86.0%) are repackaged versions of legiti-
mate applications with malicious payloads, which indicates
the policing need of detecting repackaged applications in the
current Android Markets. Also, we observe that more recent
Android malware families are adopting update attacks and
drive-by downloads to infect users, which are more stealthy
and difﬁcult to detect. Further, when analyzing the carried
payloads, we notice a number of alarming statistics: (1)
Around one third (36.7%) of the collected malware samples
leverage root-level exploits to fully compromise the Android
security, posing the highest level of threats to users’ security
and privacy; (2) More than 90% turn the compromised
phones into a botnet controlled through network or short
messages. (3) Among the 49 malware families, 28 of them
(with 571 or 45.3% samples) have the built-in support of
sending out background short messages (to premium-rate
numbers) or making phone calls without user awareness. (4)
1In this study, we consider the samples with different SHA1 values are
distinct.
2To prevent our dataset from being misused, we may require verifying
user identity or request necessary justiﬁcation before the dataset can be
downloaded. Please visit the project website for detailed information.

Last but not least, 27 malware families (with 644 or 51.1%
samples) are harvesting user’s information, including user
accounts and short messages stored on the phones.
Third, we perform an evolution-based study of repre-
sentative Android malware, which shows that
they are
rapidly evolving and existing anti-malware solutions are
seriously lagging behind. For example, it is not uncom-
mon for Android malware to have encrypted root ex-
ploits or obfuscated command and control (C&C) servers.
The adoption of various sophisticated techniques greatly
raises the bar for their detection. In fact, to evaluate the
effectiveness of existing mobile anti-virus software, we
tested our dataset with four representative ones, i.e., AVG
Antivirus Free, Lookout Security & Antivirus, Norton
Mobile Security Lite, and Trend Micro Mobile Security
Personal Edition, all downloaded from the ofﬁcial Android
Market (in the ﬁrst week of November, 2011). Sadly, wile
the best case was able to detect 1, 003 (or 79.6%) samples
in our dataset, the worst case can only detect 254 (20.2%)
samples. Furthermore, our analysis shows that malware
authors are quickly learning from each other to create hybrid
threats. For example, one recent Android malware,
i.e.,
AnserverBot [4] (reported in September 2011), is clearly
inspired from Plankton [5] (reported in June 2011) to have
the dynamic capability of fetching and executing payload at
runtime, posing signiﬁcant challenges for the development
of next-generation anti-mobile-malware solutions.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section II
presents a timeline analysis of existing Android malware.
Section III characterizes our samples and shows a detailed
breakdown of their infection behavior. After that, Section IV
presents an evolution study of representative Android mal-
ware and Section V shows the detection results with four
representative mobile anti-virus software. Section VI dis-
cusses possible ways for future improvement, followed by a
survey of related work in Section VII. Lastly, we summarize
our paper in Section VIII.
II. MALWARE TIMELINE
In Table I, we show the list of 49 Android malware
families in our dataset along with the time when each
particular malware family is discovered. We obtain the list
by carefully examining the related security announcements,
threat reports, and blog contents from existing mobile anti-
virus companies and active researchers [6]–[12] as exhaus-
tively as possible and diligently requesting malware samples
from them or actively crawling from existing ofﬁcial and al-
ternative Android Markets. As of this writing, our collection
is believed to reﬂect the state of the art of Android malware.
Speciﬁcally, if we take a look at the Android malware history
[13] from the very ﬁrst Android malware FakePlayer in
August 2010 to recent ones in the end of October 2011, it
spans slightly more than one year with around 52 Android
malware families reported. Our dataset has 1260 samples
1260
14
44
in 49 different malware families, indicating a very decent
coverage of existing Android malware.
For each malware family, we also report in the table the
number of samples in our collection and differentiate the
sources where the malware was discovered, i.e., from either
the ofﬁcial or alternative Android Markets. To eliminate
possible false positive in our dataset, we run our collection
through existing mobile anti-virus software for conﬁrmation
(Section V). If there is any miss from existing mobile anti-
virus security software, we will manually verify the sample
and conﬁrm it is indeed a malware.
