I am attempting to install OpsCenter for Cassandra using the standard RHEL image, but I'm encountering some difficulties. Could it be an issue with a different version of EPEL? When I run `yum install opscenter`, I receive the following error:

```
Error: Package: python26-rrdtool-1.2.27-1.i386 (opscenter)
           Requires: librrd.so.2
```

**Solution:**
To resolve this issue, try installing `rrdtool` via `yum`. This should provide the required `librrd.so.2` library and fix the error.

```bash
sudo yum install rrdtool
```

After installing `rrdtool`, you should be able to proceed with the installation of OpsCenter.
