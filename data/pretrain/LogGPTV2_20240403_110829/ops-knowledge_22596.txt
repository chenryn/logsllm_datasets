User: I am attemping to install OpsCenter for Cassandra, and using the the standard REHL image.  I can't figure out how to get this to work.  Another version of EPEL perhaps?
yum install opscenter....
Error: Package: python26-rrdtool-1.2.27-1.i386 (opscenter)
           Requires: librrd.so.2
Assistant: Try installing rrdtool via yum, that should contain librrd.so.2 and correct your issue.
