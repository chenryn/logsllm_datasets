Based on my article:
http://www.triview.com/articles/hibernate/validator/canmeetyourneeds.html
provide built in integration with hibernate validator.
This may be broken down into several issues:
  1. Extend JSP tag library to search for validation annotations via reflection. Render fields with css classes such as required, email, etc. Add maxlength attribute, etc.
  2. Native support to invoke the proper Hibernate ClassValidator and convert the InvalidValue array to a Spring Errors object.
  3. Extend JSP tags to render semantic html wrapper around form fields. Include div, label and field.
  4. Extend JSP tags to render with enhanced features, such as adding popup calendar for Date. Consider extracting info from assigned PropertyEditor.
  5. Add basic, included JavaScript validation support and/or integration with a major javascript framework such as prototype, jquery, ext, etc.
