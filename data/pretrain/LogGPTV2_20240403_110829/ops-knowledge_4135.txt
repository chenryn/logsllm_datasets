Question: "Imagine you are designing a Secure Enclave similar to Apple's, and you are concerned about the potential security risks if the device's electronics are operated outside their safe voltage and frequency envelope. Which of the following features would you incorporate to mitigate these risks, based on Apple's Secure Enclave design?"
 "A": "A monitoring circuit with a larger operating envelope than the rest of the Secure Enclave to detect illegal operating points and halt Secure Enclave clocks."
 "B": "An external voltage regulator that adjusts the power supply to the Secure Enclave according to the device's overall power consumption."
 "C": "A software-based watchdog timer that restarts the Secure Enclave if the operating envelope is exceeded."
 "D": "A built-in battery backup to maintain the Secure Enclave's operation even when the device's power fluctuates beyond acceptable levels."
Answer: A
