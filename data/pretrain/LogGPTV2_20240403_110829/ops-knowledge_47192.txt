When I run `python blabla.py`, the script executes successfully. However, when I try to run it with `./blabla.py`, I get an error: "no such file or directory" on CentOS 6.3.

I have confirmed that `/usr/bin/env python` correctly opens Python. I am new to Linux and would greatly appreciate any help in resolving this issue.

**Additional Information:**
- I have included the `#!/usr/bin/env python` line at the beginning of my script.
- The command `which python` returns `/usr/bin/python`.
- I have also set the executable permission using `chmod +x blabla.py`.
- The exact error message is "no such file or directory" when running `./blabla.py`, but `python blabla.py` works fine.

Could someone please assist me? Thank you in advance!

**Assistant:**

To resolve the issue, ensure that your script starts with the shebang line:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
```

This line tells the system to use the `env` utility to find the Python interpreter and execute your script with it. 

However, since you have already included the shebang and set the executable permissions, there might be other issues to consider:

1. **File Path**: Ensure that the script file `blabla.py` is in the current working directory or provide the full path to the script.
2. **Environment Variables**: Check if the `PATH` environment variable includes the directory where `blabla.py` is located.
3. **File Permissions**: Verify that the file has the correct permissions. You can check this with `ls -l blabla.py`. It should show something like `-rwxr-xr-x` for the permissions.
4. **File Type**: Ensure that `blabla.py` is a regular file and not a symbolic link or a special file type.

If the problem persists, you can try the following steps:

1. **Check the Full Path**:
   ```sh
   ls -l /path/to/your/directory/blabla.py
   ```

2. **Run with Full Path**:
   ```sh
   /path/to/your/directory/blabla.py
   ```

3. **Verify Shebang Line**:
   Open the file and confirm that the first line is exactly:
   ```python
   #!/usr/bin/env python
   ```

If you still encounter issues, please provide more details about the directory structure and the exact commands you are using.
