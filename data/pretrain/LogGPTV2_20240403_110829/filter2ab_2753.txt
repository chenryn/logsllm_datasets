### Title: The Cereals Botnet at botconf2019

A recently discovered botnet, known as "The Cereals," has been targeting Network Access Storage (NAS) and Network Video Recorder (NVR) devices. This botnet, which traces its origins back to 2013, exploits a known vulnerability to infect devices and remains active to this day. Our research indicates that it primarily targets devices from a well-known vendor in the consumer software market. However, due to the widespread use of these devices, compromised units can be found not only in small businesses but also in government networks.

What sets The Cereals botnet apart is its construction from readily available components, with only a few custom-built binaries. Additionally, the botnet's architecture features a separation of subnets, and the communication between host nodes and the Command and Control (C2) server is uniquely designed. Despite the vendor having patched the targeted vulnerability, a significant number of infected devices have either never received firmware updates or have not been restarted in years, allowing the botnet to persist.
