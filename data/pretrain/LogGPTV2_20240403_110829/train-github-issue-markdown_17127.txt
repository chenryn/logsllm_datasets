After few seconds working on a PHP file, the editor panel hangs and the whole
program needs to be killed.  
Only the editor panel stops responding, while the menu bar can be clicked (but
clicking on "Exit" doesn't produce any effect).
Task manager shows a stable 40% CPU load coming from code.exe process.
