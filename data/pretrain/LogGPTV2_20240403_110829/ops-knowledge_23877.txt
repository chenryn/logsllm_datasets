"A": "A secure hash function is keyed and requires a secret key to compute the hash of a message.",
"B": "If the same message is hashed twice using the same hash function, the result will be two identical hash values.",
"C": "Changing even a single bit in the message will result in an unpredictable change in the hash value.",
"D": "A secure hash function will always produce a variable-length output to ensure security."
Answer: BC
