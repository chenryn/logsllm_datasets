**Title: Botconf 2014 - The Russian DDoS One: From Booter Services to Botnets**

**Abstract:**
The Russian DDoS One (RD1) is an informal network of threat actors who primarily offer DDoS booter services on Russian-language underground forums. While these actors frequently advertise their services, provide contact information, and occasionally engage in public disputes, the majority of their operations are conducted in private, making them difficult to trace. This includes the back-end infrastructure responsible for executing DDoS attacks.

To provide a more comprehensive understanding of RD1, this presentation will delve into the activities of several key threat actors within this group. We will examine their booter services and the associated DDoS botnets that support these operations. By shedding light on these elements, we aim to offer valuable insights into the inner workings of RD1 and the broader landscape of DDoS-for-hire services.
