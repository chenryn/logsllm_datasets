## Bug Report
Webpack5 `beta.30` has enabled strict mode on the ESM modules imports
https://github.com/webpack/webpack/releases/tag/v5.0.0-beta.30
webpack/webpack#11467 has noted people with code problems, however
`@babel/runtime` appears to have code that doesn't follow the strict `"type":
"module"` requirements, as expected for node / webpack.
`.\node_modules\@babel\runtime\helpers\esm\package.json` has `"type":
"module"` being set and libraries that depend on `@babel/runtime` with ESM
modules are broken as a result.
I expect the code generator should be outputting with the file extensions to
satisfy the requirements of ESM modules
https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#esm_differences_between_es_modules_and_commonjs
**Current behavior**
@babel/runtime/helpers/esm/*.js contains extensionless imports for
dependencies.
**Expected behavior**
@babel/runtime/helpers/esm/*.js to contain fully specified extensions for
imports
**Babel Configuration (babel.config.js, .babelrc, package.json#babel, cli
command, .eslintrc)**
N/A - this is npm published module
