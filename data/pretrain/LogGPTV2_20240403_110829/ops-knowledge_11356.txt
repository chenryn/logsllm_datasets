User: I'd like to run periodic tasks on my django project, but I don't want all the complexity of celery/django-celery (with celerybeat) bundled in my project.
I'd like, also, to store the config with the times and which command to run within my SCM.
My production machine is running Ubuntu 10.04.
While I could learn and use cron, I feel like there should be a higher level (user friendly) way to do it. (Much like UFW is to iptables).
Is there such thing? Any tips/advice?
Thanks!
Assistant: In my personal opinion, i would learn how to use cron. This won't take more than 5 to 10 minutes, and it's an essential tool when working on a Linux server.
What you could do is set up a cronjob that requests one page of your django instance every minute, and have the django script figure out what time it is and what needs to be done, depending on the configuration stored in your database. This is the approach i've seen in other similar applications.
