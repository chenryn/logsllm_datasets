User: I setup PyDev with this path for the python interpreter
/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/Python
since the one under /usr/bin were alias and Eclipse won't select it. I can run my python script now but cannot run the shell as an external tool. The message I get is
variable references empty selection ${resource_loc}
Same if I use {container_loc}
Any thoughts ?

Assistant: Common practice seems to be to install an up-to-date Python 2.5 from python.org and use that instead of the system installation. I saw that recommended here and there when I got started on Mac OS X.
It installs under /Library (as opposed to /System/Library) so the system Python is intact. Pydev has /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/Resources/Python.app/Contents/MacOS/Python as its configured Python interpreter and all is well.
Can't state for sure that your trouble is due only to using the system's Python installation; in any case this way I have no trouble. Also, this way when you fiddle with your development environment (install things in site-packages, upgrade Python), anything that uses the system Python is sure to be unaffected.
