evident: it is difﬁcult for certiﬁcates to be issued without
alerting either the domain owner or clients. Additionally, the
logs are both monitored and publicly auditable, allowing any
user to check their integrity at any time. We use the certiﬁcates
collected from the CT logs to check for mis-issuance of X.509
certiﬁcates.
V. DNS ANALYSIS
During our collection period, we collected over 775 million
DNS queries to over 17.2 million unique Fully Qualiﬁed
Domain Names (FQDN). The responses of these queries
returned over 2.5 million distinct destination IP addresses. The
collected raw data comprised over 179 GBs. In this section, we
analyze the DNS data and compare it to the OpenDNS dataset
and blacklisted trafﬁc to characterize potentially malicious
behavior.
A. General DNS Behavior
We conducted an analysis on the top 100 e2LDs present in
both our dataset and the OpenDNS data. We chose to analyze
only the top 100 domains because this analysis was conducted
manually in order to determine afﬁliation and role of every
domain. To accurately assess the role of every domain, we
resolved it and then categorized it as either entertainment,
service related, or hospital related. The top 100 domains
account for over 60.98% of the trafﬁc in our dataset.
Shared Top Domains: Overall, the top 100 domains from
our dataset and the OpenDNS dataset had 36 domains in
common. Domains that fell into this category included large
entertainment domains (e.g., netflix.com), search engines,
and large services such as microsoft.com that are likely
used by the hospital. These shared domains accounted for
approximately 31% of the total trafﬁc in our dataset. We had
initially expected to see a larger overlap between the top sites
from the hospital and OpenDNS. However, upon observing our
5
own top e2LDs it became clear why there is a large deviation
between the two datasets.
Infrastructure Domains: 36 of our dataset’s top e2LDs were
directly related to the hospital. These domains were either
controlled by the hospital itself, large-scale service providers
employed by the hospital (for services including security, anti-
virus, data analytics, etc.), or directly intended for use by
medical providers (e.g., the National Institutes of Health’s
domain nih.gov). Overall,
infrastructure related-domains
generated 18.6% of the total trafﬁc in the network.
Other Unshared Top Domains: The healthcare-speciﬁc do-
mains were a part of a larger set of 64 domains that were
present in the hospital’s top domains but not in the OpenDNS
dataset. The non-infrastructure domains accounted for 11.3%
of the total trafﬁc in our dataset. The other domains that
were not afﬁliated to healthcare were predominately con-
tent distribution networks, software provider domains (e.g.,
mozilla.com), smaller entertainment domains, or various
regional domains. We believe that these sites simply represent
the unique subculture and demographic makeup of the hospital
system which we were studying. We do not go into any
further detail about these domains to prevent deanonymizing
the hospital which we observed.
By comparing the hospital network’s top domains to the
top domains of the Internet at large, we observe the hospital
network signiﬁcantly deviating in several ways. From this
D-HAI analysis, we saw that the top domains for medical
supporting devices contained a large quantity of services that
are directly related to the hospital’s functions. Additionally,
we saw a large number of domains that were associated with
anti-virus and network security providers. More interesting
are the services that were not present in our dataset. Overall
it appears that medical supporting devices interact with en-
tertainment domains, cloud providers, and non-work related
domains less than the Internet at large. While expected, we
believe this is still worth mentioning for the following reason:
given the sensitive nature of medical records, having a limited
domain footprint decreases the likelihood of a computer being
compromised through a web browser via a drive-by download
or malicious JavaScript.
B. Trafﬁc Categorization
As part of the D-HAI analysis, we categorized our data
into three sets in order to contextualize it. Our data is divided
into whitelisted, blacklisted, and unknown categories. In total,
we categorized 502, 051, 633 requests or 64.78% of the DNS
trafﬁc as whitelisted. The trafﬁc that was whitelisted came
from 119,117 (0.69%) unique FQDN that were associated to
29,085 (1.68%) distinct e2LDs. From these values, we can
see that on average each e2LD has 4.09 unique FQDNs (e.g.,
mail.domain.com is an FQDN of domain.com) associ-
ated with it. We categorized 84,669 requests or 0.01% of the
trafﬁc queries as connections to blacklisted domains. Overall,
the blacklisted trafﬁc was intended for 2, 483 unique domains
across 2, 281 unique e2LDs. Unlike the whitelisted domains,
it appears that blacklisted domains have a lower association
rate between unique FQDNs and distinct e2LDs. On average,
an e2LD in our blacklisted dataset has approximately 1.08
FQDNs associated with it.
Fig. 2: Each category of domain is divided into ﬁve divisions
based off the number of FQDNs that associated to each e2LD.
We observe that domains found in our unknown trafﬁc regu-
larly have a higher amount of self-association than blacklisted
domains. This gives us reason to believe that the majority of
domains with the unknown category are more similar to those
in the whitelisted category and therefore benign.
We believe this occurs because reputable domains are more
likely to want to reuse their e2LD for multiple sub-domains.
By doing so, reputable domains can easily pass on their
reputations to their sub-domains. Unlike reputable domains,
malicious domains do not wish to pass their reputation to
newer sites and are thus more likely to change their e2LDs
frequently. This is illustrated in Figure 2, which shows the
average number of sub-domains for each e2LD within a certain
subset of that category. The categories are divided into subsets
by the number of FQDNs that are associated to each e2LD.
For example, the N > 2 subset contains only those e2LDs
that had at least 3 unique FQDNs associated with it. If we
assume our whitelisted and blacklisted categories are accurate
representations of benign and suspicious trafﬁc, then we can
gain some perspective on the unknown category through the
same analysis.
We can use this same technique to characterize ma-
licious behavior in the unknown category of domains. In
total,
the unknown category contains 271,363,949 unique
requests or 35.02% of the total
trafﬁc. These connections
went to 17,186,699 (99.72%) distinct FQDNs across 1,721,311
(99.76%) e2LDs. On average, e2LDs in the unknown category
are associated with 9.98 unique FQDNs. This rate of self-
association makes the unknown category appear to be less
malicious. However, this category had a long tail of FQDNs
(72.4%) that were only queried once. 93.9% of the domains
had under 10 total queries targeting them. When we look at
the trafﬁc distribution as it relates to e2LDs, queries that had
more than 50 requests accounted for only 4.64% of our total
e2LDs but over 85.03% of the trafﬁc in the unknown category.
In fact, some of the most visited domains in our dataset ended
up in the unknown category.
While the above metrics tells us that the distribution of
6

us insight into how we should categorize the queries. To see
if unknown trafﬁc is indeed behaving similarly to whitelisted
trafﬁc, we collected all e2LDs present in our whitelisted trafﬁc
and checked if the unknown category also had those e2LDs
present. In the case of an e2LD collision, we mark the query as
benign due to self association. By examining these collisions,
we mark almost half (45.25%) of the unknown trafﬁc as
benign. This occurs because many services tend to use one
time DNS requests to encode information (e.g., anti-virus
services). While the service’s e2LD may be part of the top
100,000 domains, the one-time DNS request will not be.
Finally, after removing the e2LD collisions of the unknown
queries, only 19.17% of the hospital’s total trafﬁc remained
in the unknown category. After manually checking the top
e2LDs,
the remaining trafﬁc appears to be predominately
comprised of domains useful
to the hospital’s operations.
These include domains internal to the hospital, outside services
(e.g., customer relations management), and software that was
purchased by the hospital for daily healthcare operations (e.g.,
payroll and administrative). This is consistent with the previous
subsection’s analysis of the hospital’s top 100 domains. Al-
though we cannot claim that all trafﬁc categorized as unknown
is universally benign, it appears that the majority of it is.
While the effectiveness of blacklists/whitelists for the open
this shows that blacklists and
Internet are still unknown,
whitelists used to categorize Internet trafﬁc may miss large
amounts of trafﬁc seen in healthcare networks. We believe
that hospital medical supporting devices and their networks
could beneﬁt from more customized whitelists and blacklists
for domains speciﬁc to the hospital. Given our limited visibility
into the internal network, we are unable to perform this
analysis here.
C. Potentially Malicious Behavior
While investigating the DNS data, we found several
signs of potentially malicious activity. Speciﬁcally, we looked
for known botnet command and control (C&C) channels,
as well as spam networks and other known malicious
actors. We used a curated list of known entities from
emergingthreats.net collected on April 3 and July
30, 2018. This list contained several categories of threats
including IP addresses for the Feodo and Zeus botnets, spam
nets identiﬁed by SpamHaus, and the top attackers listed by
DShield. We compared this list to our full dataset. We found
5, 552 connections to IP addresses that were members of the
emergingthreats dataset. When we looked for when these
queries were made, there appeared to be no discernible pattern
throughout our collection period. This is concerning given the
highly sensitive data that medical supporting devices access.
However, further analysis is needed to determine whether or
not our concern is warranted.

Zeus and Feodo were found in the hospital network trafﬁc.
In addition, only 0.0007% of the total trafﬁc in our dataset
was related to potential bot activity. While the low volume of
potential activity appears reassuring, the fact that any exists
is still concerning as DNS data does not reveal additional
communication occurring over other protocols. The low rate
of bot activity could represent false positives generated by
misclicks, temporal artifacts of the emergingthreats list
(e.g., a site visited months before or after it was deemed
malicious), or collisions caused by CDNs. We were not
able to conﬁrm the intent of these queries from our network
vantage point, but we notiﬁed system administrators of our
ﬁndings.
The vast majority of bot activity seen was related to Zeus,
accounting for over 94.78% of potential bot queries. The
connections were made to 1, 722 unique FQDNs associated
with 1, 514 distinct e2LDs. Interestingly, all the domains in
our botnet trafﬁc resolved to just 37 unique IP address. The
top 3 IP address had 540, 341, and 308 different e2LDs
associated with them, accounting for over 77% of unique
e2LDs observed. On further investigation, we found that two
of the three IP addresses were controlled by domain hosting
sites. The last IP address was for a trafﬁc redirection site for
Internet advertisements. While these services may have once
hosted malicious activity, we have no indication that they are
still actively malicious.
D. Summary
The DNS analysis highlights several aspects of the ob-
served hospital network. First, the top domains that traverse
this network are substantially different from those of the Inter-
net at large. The trafﬁc indicates that the majority of domains
visited on the network are related to the hospital’s healthcare
role, thus shrinking the network’s attack surface. While the
hospital may beneﬁt from whitelists and blacklists intended
for general use on the Internet, this type of categorization
misses a large section of domains speciﬁcally related to the
hospital (e.g., their AV service) and a more domain speciﬁc
categorization method would greatly beneﬁt the community.
Additionally,
there were detectable, albeit small, signs of
malicious actors in the network. While our analysis was not
conclusive with regards to their benign or malicious activity,
administrators should be concerned that these actors represent
potential
threats to the hospital network and could lower
the network’s overall ability to provide patient care if left
unchecked.
VI. TLS/SSL COMMUNICATIONS
Because hospital networks contain EHRs and other per-
sonal identiﬁable information (PII), secure communication is
important for ensuring the integrity and conﬁdentiality of such
data. DNS requests tell us from whom the medical supporting
devices are requesting information, but provide only a limited
view of the security of their communications. To broaden
the scope of the D-HAI analysis, we also collected quality
metrics for TLS/SSL sessions we observed. In particular, this
section focuses on the protocols and cipher suites negotiated
in established sessions, as well as certiﬁcates presented by the
server in fresh (non-resumed) sessions. The vast majority of
sessions (97.66%) involved no client certiﬁcate authentication,
as is expected. The conclusions in this section uses the Censys’
data as a baseline, which reﬂects the server’s preference of
TLS/SSL establishment parameters.
