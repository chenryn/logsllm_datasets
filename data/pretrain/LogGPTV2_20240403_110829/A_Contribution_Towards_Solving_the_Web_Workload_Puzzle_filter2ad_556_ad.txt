Table 3. αHill, αLLCD, and R2 for session length in
number of requests
bytes transferred per session, including the Low, Med, and High
intervals. Even more, the values of α for CSEE server are around
1 or even below 1 (implying inﬁnite mean).
It is obvious that
under the Pareto model, the number of bytes transferred per ses-
sion has the heaviest tail compared to the other two intra–session
characteristics. One obvious reason for the heavy–tailed behav-
ior of the number of bytes transferred per session is due to the
fact that the distributions of ﬁles sizes and ﬁles transferred are
heavy–tailed [2], [3], [7].
6 Concluding remarks
In this paper we have presented a rigorous statistical analysis
of request level and session level Web workload based on data
extracted from four real Web servers. Our goals included devel-
opment of a FULL-Web model which provides comprehensive
view on Web workload and clear identiﬁcation of the speciﬁc lim-
itations associated with methods used for establishing long–range
dependence and heavy–tailed behavior.
Our results show that all Web servers considered in this study
have long–range dependant request arrival process. Unlike the
related work on Web workload characterization which either
avoided non–stationarity by focusing on one hour intervals or ig-
nored it completely, we test the stationarity of the request–based
time series and eliminate the trend and periodicity before study-
ing the long–range dependence phenomenon. We show that not
accounting for the trend and periodicity leads to overestimating
the level of long–range dependence. Furthermore, we show that
the piecewise Poisson process with ﬁxed 1-hour or 10-minute
rates cannot be used to model the request arrival process.
In addition to the analysis of the request–based Web work-
load, we provide a comprehensive model of session–based Web
workload which has not been considered earlier. Thus, we study
the Web session arrival process and show that, unlike TELNET
and FTP trafﬁc, it is long–range dependant for all servers consid-
ered in this paper. Even though piecewise Poisson process with
ﬁxed hourly rates models well some four hour intervals under low
to moderate workload, it fails on longer periods (e.g., one week).
We also study several intra–session characteristics, such as
session length in time, number of request per session, and bytes
transferred per session. Since long–range dependence is usu-
ally accompanied with heavy–tailed distributions, for each intra–
session characteristic we examine whether it follows heavy–tailed
distribution. For this purpose, we use several different methods
(i.e., LLCD plot, Hill plot, and curvature test for the extreme
tail). Some highlights of this analysis include: (1) In most cases
LLCD plot and Hill estimator give consistent results. (2) Based
on the curvature test, the intra-session parameters are modelled
well with both Pareto and lognormal distributions. (3) The results
of the curvature test for Pareo distribution are somewhat sensitive
to the estimated values of the tail index and simulated sample of
Pareto distribution. (4) The reason behind the difﬁculty to statis-
tically distinguish between Pareto and lognormal distribution is
the small number of observations in the extreme tail. (5) Under
the Pareto model, intra–session characteristics for some intervals
exhibit heavy-tailed behavior.
In summary, in this paper we presented a comprehensive
model which contributes towards better understanding of Web
workloads. We also showed that, despite of almost ten years of
research efforts in this area, a number of challenges remain to be
addressed in the future work.
