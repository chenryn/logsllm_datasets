### Problem description
I simply have this code:
    handleExpandChange = (expanded) => {
            this.setState({expanded: expanded});
        };
        handleToggle = () => {
            this.setState({expanded: !this.state.expanded});
        };
        render() {
            return (
                            zxczxc
            );
        }
I can't get the controlled card working like example. Is this anything issue
with React 15,6.1?
I read #7129 there is an issue with the touch event. Is this any impact with
the card components?
I've tried change FlatButton to use regular button and use onClick still not
working.
