ABSTRACT
Smartphones are playing an increasingly important role in
personal life and carrying massive private data. Unfortu-
nately, once the smartphones are stolen, all the sensitive
information, such as contacts, messages, photos, credit card
information and passwords, may fall into the hands of ma-
licious people. In order to protect the private data, remote
deletion mechanism is required to allow owners to wipe the
sensitive data on the stolen phone remotely. Existing re-
mote deletion techniques rely on the availability of either
WiFi for Internet connection or SIM card for cellular net-
work connection; however, these requirements may not be
satisﬁed when the phones are stolen by some sophisticated
adversaries. In this paper, we propose a new remote dele-
tion mechanism that allows the phone owner to delete the
private data remotely even if the WiFi is disabled and the
SIM card is unplugged. The basic idea is to use emergency
call mechanisms to establish a communication connection
with a service provider to verify the state of the phone and
perform remote deletion. We present a case study of our
mechanism with the Universal Mobile Telecommunications
System (UMTS) network.

INTRODUCTION
Smartphones are playing an increasingly important role
in our daily life to access personal and corporate email, pre-
pare tax returns, and review customer documents, etc [6].
US military also announced that it will equip soldiers with
Android devices for accessing classiﬁed documents [10]. S-
mart phones provide massive non-volatile memory to store
private and sensitive data such as SMS (Short Message Ser-
vice) messages, photos, credit card information and social
security numbers, user names and passwords [15]. The pop-
ularity of mobile devices raises serious and yet unsolved con-
cerns, particularly with respect to data security on stolen or
lost devices. From the mid-1990s many crimes have declined
signiﬁcantly, but the theft of mobile phones has become an
increasingly serious problem - 49% New Yorkers have expe-
rienced mobile loss/theft [11]. Once a smartphone is lost, its
sensitive data may be compromised through directly break-
ing into the phone system or connecting the phone to a PC
as an external USB storage.
A number of smartphone wipe-out mechanisms have been
developed to delete the sensitive data from lost smartphones.
One solution is to automatically delete the sensitive data
after a number of failed authentication attempts [12]. How-
ever, it may cause accidental data deletion when the owner
forgets the password or someone plays with another’s phone.
Moreover, an adversary still may access the sensitive data by
connecting the smartphone to a PC. Remote wipe-out mech-
anisms allow owners to remotely delete the sensitive data by
sending a wipe-out command to the lost devices through the
Internet or SMS. For example, iCloud remote wipe-out sys-
tem [4] can initiate the deletion of all user data by sending
“kill” messages to lost mobile devices through the Internet.
All existing solutions have to rely on the Internet or cellular
network to send speciﬁc commands to the smartphone.
Unfortunately, sophisticated adversaries can defeat all ex-
isting remote wipe-out mechanisms by removing the SIM
(Subscriber Identity Module) card and turning oﬀ the WiFi.
Once a smartphone is stolen, since the adversary can phys-
ically access the device, he/she can remove the SIM card
537to disrupt normal communication through cellular network
and disable or jam all the WiFi connections to the Internet.
Thus, without receiving a wipe-out command, the smart-
phone has no chances to be remotely wiped out.
In this paper, we develop a remote wipe-out mechanism
that allow owners to remotely wipe out a smartphone even
if WiFi is unavailable and the SIM card has been unplugged.
The basic idea is allow the smartphone use emergency call
channel of the cellular network to receive remote command-
s. When the SIM card is unplugged, no normal calls can
be made since the service carrier requires the SIM card for
authentication and billing. However, the smartphone stil-
l can make emergency calls such as 911 in the US. In our
solution, when the smartphone detects the removal of the
SIM card, it will initiate a stealthy emergency call to the
wipe-out service provider, who will send back a wipe-out
command after conﬁrming that the phone has been lost or
stolen. The adversary will be blind to the undergoing emer-
gency call. To the best of our knowledge, our solution is the
ﬁrst to enable remote data erasure without relying on the
availability of SIM card or the WiFi connection. Our system
guarantees that only the real owner can activate the remote
wipe-out service through user authentication. Moreover, we
can prevent the service provider from accidentally deleting
user’s data. We choose strong data deletion mechanisms to
prevent adversaries from recovering the deleted data after
the remote wipe-out process. The whole wipe-out process is
unobservable to the adversary.
To demonstrate the feasibility, we provide an example of
such a remote wipe-out service in the Universal Mobile T-
elecommunications System (UMTS) cellular network. Our
system only requires a small extension to the current emer-
gency call mechanism, and there is no change on current
network structure.
In summary, we make the following contributions:
• We propose a remote wipe-out framework that enables
the owner to remotely wipe the data on a smartphone
even if the adversary removes the SIM card and dis-
ables the WiFi connection.
• We evaluate the feasibility of our design by providing
a prototype in the UMTS network.
The next section discusses related work. Section 3 de-
scribes the threat model and assumptions. In Section 4, we
describe the design of our remote wipe-out mechanism. In
Section 5, we take UMTS network environment as a study
case. Section 6 discusses the integration of our proposed
mechanism with current existing remote data erasure mech-
anisms. Section 7 concludes this paper.
2. RELATED WORK
To protect sensitive data on stolen smartphones, several
anti-theft schemes have been proposed. Tang et al.
[14]
presented an Android-based scheme called CleanOS, which
identiﬁes and tracks sensitive data in RAM and on stable
storage, encrypts them with a key, and evicts that key to
the cloud when the data is not in active use on the device.
However, CleanOS requires network connectivity with the
cloud all the time.
[7] found that
most users do not trust the cloud provider. As a home-based
scheme, Avinash et al. [12] proposed a PIN-based extended
security mechanism for iOS devices that can be wiped out
In addition, Ion et al.
automatically after a certain number of attempt failures.
Unfortunately, this may cause accidental deletion.
Kuppusamy et al. [9] proposed a model to control a stolen
smartphone remotely via SMS. However, it is subject to the
removal of the SIM card. Another remote control system,
proposed by Joe et al.
[8], communicates with remote de-
vices through the Internet. However, none of these solutions
can communicate with a smartphone with neither the SIM
card nor the WiFi connection.
To improve the privacy and security of lost and stolen s-
martphones, various anti-theft applications exist and help
increase post-theft data control, such as Find My iPhone of
iCloud [4], Avast Free Mobile Security [5], Norton Mobile
Security [13]. All these apps support remotely wiping the
data on an on-line stolen or lost smartphone. However, they
all rely on the Internet connection based on the WiFi or the
data service from cellular network. Some apps also allow
the user to wipe conﬁdential ﬁles by sending a special SMS,
such as Avast Free Mobile Security [5] and Norton Mobile
Security [13]. All SMS-based solutions only work on a s-
martphone with the SIM card plugged; however, since most
devices or data thieves tend to immediately disable the WiFi
and remove the SIM card, these solutions cannot guarantee
to wipe out the sensitive data remotely.
3. THREAT MODEL AND ASSUMPTIONS
In our threat model, we allow the adversary to remove the
SIM card from a stolen smartphone and turn oﬀ the WiFi.
We assume that the adversary is interested in obtaining its
locally stored data, but has not extract the storage chips
or transferred the user data before removing the SIM card.
We do not consider the sophisticated adversaries who keep
a stolen smartphone switched oﬀ or position the phone in
an electromagnetic shielding environment or keep the bat-
tery unplugged all the time. For example, if the attacker
performs the attack inside a cage or underground chamber
without any signal from the cellular network, our wipe-out
mechanism cannot work correctly.
IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity) is used
to identify and authenticate a subscriber and is a unique
identiﬁcation associated with all cellular networks. For a
GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication) phone,
this number is provisioned in the SIM card. The R-UIM (Re-
movable User Identity Module) card used by the CDMA2000
(Code Division Multiple Access 2000) phone is analogous to
the SIM card for a GSM phone. In this paper, we use the
SIM card to represent all similar components which have the
same functionality in diﬀerent networks.
We perform remote control through emergency call chan-
nel. However, not all the cellular networks support using the
IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) instead of
the IMSI as identiﬁcation in the emergency call establish-
ment. We assume that the operator accepts the emergency
call that uses the IMEI as the identiﬁcation.
Although the IMEI is usually a unique number to identify
mobile phones, sophisticated attackers may be able to tam-
per with this number. However, this number is still used to
uniquely identify a stolen smartphone in most countries. For
example, Australia ﬁrst implemented IMEI blocking across
all GSM networks, in 2003 [1]. We assume that the IMEI is
unique for a stolen smartphone.
Some smartphones use an internal SIM card instead of
In addition, some mobile phones
a removable SIM card.
538have an IMSI written by special software module. For those
devices, the adversary cannot remove the SIM card easily,
so we can remotely wipe the device through the SMS or the
Internet-based solutions as [13, 5, 4] do.
1 The smartphone attaches a deletion indicator to an emer-
gency call, and makes this customized emergency call at-
tempt on the mobile cellular network. The IMEI is used
as the equipment identiﬁcation.
4. WIPE-OUT SYSTEM DESIGN
4.1 Overview
To provide sensitive data protection for a stolen smart-
phone without the SIM card and the WiFi connection, we
put forward a remote wipe-out mechanism, as shown in Fig-
ure 1. Our proposed mechanism allows users to remote con-
trol their stolen phones through the emergency call channel,
which in our opinion is the only communication channel be-
tween such a smartphone and the outside.
Figure 1: Remote Wipe-out Framework
To remotely wipe sensitive data on a stolen smartphone,
the owner interacts with the service provider as follows:
1 The owner subscribes to the remote wipe-out service from
the service provider and registers his/her phone before
it is stolen. After a successful registration, the service
provider records the IMEI number of the phone in the
IMEI database and marks its state as normal.
2 The owner reports the loss and asks for erasing the data
on the device, as soon as he realizes the lost of the smart-
phone. After authenticating the user, the service provider
tags the associated item of the reported phone as stolen
in the IMEI database.
To enable the remote wipe-out service, a backstage appli-
cation is required to be installed on the phone. Once the
SIM card is removed from a smartphone, it may imply that
the phone is stolen.
In this circumstance, the backstage
application starts to ask for data erasure through making
a customized emergency call automatically and stealthily.
The backstage application will be triggered to make a cus-
tomized emergency call by either of the following two events:
the SIM card is removed from a switched-on smartphone or
the smartphone is powered on with the SIM card unplugged.
Stealthy operation means that the procedure runs in the
backstage: the screen neither lights up nor shows any re-
lated information, and any other relevant reminder program
could not be activated, for the purpose of preventing the
adversary from being conscious of the running procedure.
Once the call control entity of the network receives a wipe-
out request from the smartphone, it will check the state of
this phone in the IMEI database of the service provider.
Here we detail this procedure:
2 The call control entity checks the state of the smartphone
in the IMEI database of the service provider, after re-
ceiving the request for setting up a customized emergency
call.
3 If the smartphone is tagged as stolen in the database, the
call control entity sends the wipe-out command to the
smartphone. Otherwise, the call control entity responds
with a call accepted message which is the same as the
access permission for a normal legal emergency call.
The smartphone performs stealthy data erasure after re-
ceiving the wipe-out command. If the smartphone receives
the call accepted message (case 3), it ends the ongoing e-
mergency call. The customized emergency call can be di-
aled only once, which consumes little power. But in this
case, if the adversary removes the SIM card before the own-
er realizes and reports the theft, the stolen phone will have
no chance to receive the wipe-out command, as the service
provider/owner has already missed the only call. To provide
higher security, the smartphone can make customized emer-
gency calls periodically until the reception of the wipe-out
command. The higher frequency of making such emergency
calls, the higher possibility of wiping the data before the ad-
versary peeks at or transfers the user data. However, high
frequency results in high power consumption and heavy bur-
den on network as well.
In case there is a normal emergency call dialed on the
screen, the backstage application stops making customized
emergency call attempts and the ongoing customized emer-
gency call is cancelled instantly. Moreover, the backstage
application keeps monitoring the state change of the SIM
card. If a SIM card is plugged in after the backstage appli-
cation has detected the absence of the SIM card, the device
stops making the customized emergency call and the data on
the device can be remotely wiped out through other current
existing mechanisms.
4.2 Device Registration
To remotely wipe sensitive data on a stolen phone without
the SIM card and the WiFi connection, a user needs to sub-
scribe to the remote wipe-out service before the smartphone
gets lost. The owner registers the service with identiﬁcation
information (e.g., ID card information) that can uniquely
identify himself to the service provider and installs our ap-
plication on the smartphone. The application may be down-
loaded from a speciﬁed web site or obtained through any
other way following the speciﬁcation of the service provider.
The identity information can be submitted online or through
any other speciﬁed way. The service provider records the
IMEI number of the registered smartphone and marks its
state as normal in the IMEI database.
4.3 Report of Lost Smartphone
If the smartphone is stolen, the owner could request for
remotely wiping out the device through a service call or we-
b interface, or even the SMS. The speciﬁc way to report
the theft is dependent on the speciﬁcation of the service
provider. But the service provider must authenticate the
539user before recording the report and perform follow-up pro-
