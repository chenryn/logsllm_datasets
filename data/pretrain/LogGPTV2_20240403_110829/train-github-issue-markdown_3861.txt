  * OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):Debian
  * Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
  * TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):binary
  * TensorFlow version (use command below):1.13.1,1.14.0，2.0.0a0，1.9.0
  * Python version:3.7,3.6
  * Bazel version (if compiling from source):
  * GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
  * CUDA/cuDNN version:Cuda 10/7.5.0,7.4.2,7.4.1,7.4.0,Cuda 9 can't support 2060
  * GPU model and memory:rtx 2060 6GB
You can collect some of this information using our environment capture  
script  
You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with: 1. TF 1.0: `python -c "import
tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"` 2\. TF 2.0: `python -c
"import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.version.GIT_VERSION, tf.version.VERSION)"`
