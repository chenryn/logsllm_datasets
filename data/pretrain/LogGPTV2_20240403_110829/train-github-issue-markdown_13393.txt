It seems that if you're conditionally rendering between two elements then they
can't have a different root node, for example switching between an input and a
div. In order to get around the issue you have to wrap everything in a common
container element for React to be able to handle it.
Sample plunkr is here which demonstrates the behavior. I'd expect in this case
it to switch between showing 'Test' and 'Test 2' when activating the checkbox,
instead it ends up duplicating the node.
Interestingly I don't get any errors in this simplified test case, in a more
complex app React complains about two unrelated nodes sharing the same React
id after activating the checkbox.
