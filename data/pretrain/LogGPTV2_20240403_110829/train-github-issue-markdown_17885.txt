Challenge Target the same element with multiple jQuery Selectors has an issue.  
User Agent is: `Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36

Please describe how to reproduce this issue, and include links to screenshots
if possible.
My code:
      jQuery Playground
          #left-well
            #target1
            #target2
            #target3
          #right-well
            #target4
            #target5
            #target6
When I try to run the test for this excersice, it doesnt appear the "to do"
list below the "run test, help," etc. buttons, also it doesnt run the test (I
belive the code is correct and it doesnt let me check that).
Help?
