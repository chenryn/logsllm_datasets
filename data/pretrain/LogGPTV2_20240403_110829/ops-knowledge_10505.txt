User: I have installed both versions of python that is python 2.7 and python 3.5.3. When I run python command in command prompt, python 3.5.3 interpreter shows up. How can I switch to python 2.7 interpreter?
Assistant: Usually on all major operating systems the commands python2 and python3 run the correct version of Python respectively. If you have several versions of e.g. Python 3 installed, python32 or python35 would start Python 3.2 or Python 3.5. python usually starts the lowest version installed I think.
Hope this helps!
