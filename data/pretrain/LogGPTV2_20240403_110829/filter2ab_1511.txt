**ATT&CK ID:** M1038  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Execution Prevention

**Description:**
Configuring system settings to prevent the execution of applications that have not been downloaded from legitimate repositories can help mitigate certain security risks. Additionally, disallowing the execution of unsigned applications can further reduce potential vulnerabilities.

**Recommendations:**
- Ensure that system policies only permit the execution of applications obtained from trusted and verified sources.
- Implement controls to block the execution of unsigned or unverified applications.
