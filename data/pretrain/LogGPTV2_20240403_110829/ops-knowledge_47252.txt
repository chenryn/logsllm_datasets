User: The Python module tempfile contains both NamedTemporaryFile and TemporaryFile. The documentation for the former says

Whether the name can be used to open the file a second time, while the named temporary file is still open, varies across platforms (it can be so used on Unix; it cannot on Windows NT or later)

What is the point of the file having a name if I can't use that name? If I want the useful (for me) behaviour of Unix on Windows, I've got to make a copy of the code and rip out all the bits that say if _os.name == 'nt' and the like.
What gives? Surely this is useful for something, since it was deliberately coded this way, but what is that something?
Assistant: You don't want to "rip out all the bits...".  It's coded like that for a reason. It says you can't open it a SECOND time while it's still open.   Don't.  Just use it once, and throw it away (after all, it is a temporary file).  If you want a permanent file, create your own.
"Surely this is useful for something, since it was deliberately coded this way, but what is that something".  Well, I've used it to write emails to (in a binary format) before copying them to a location where our Exchange Server picks them up & sends them.  I'm sure there are lots of other use cases.
