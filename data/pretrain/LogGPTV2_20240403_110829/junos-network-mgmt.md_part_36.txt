### Understanding SNMP Support for Routing Instances in Junos OS

Junos OS allows SNMP managers to request and manage SNMP data related to specific routing instances and logical system networks. Here’s a detailed breakdown of how SNMP support is handled in Junos OS:

#### Access to MIB Objects
- **Clients from Non-Default Routing Instances:**
  - Clients from routing instances or logical systems other than the default can access MIB objects and perform SNMP operations only on the routing instance and/or logical system networks to which they belong.
  
- **Clients from the Default Routing Instance:**
  - Clients from the default routing instance can access information related to all routing instances and logical system networks.

- **Junos Management Routing Instance (mgmt_junos):**
  - This is a special instance. Clients from the management routing instance are treated as if they were in the default routing instance and can access information related to all routing instances and logical system networks.

#### Historical Context
- **Before Junos OS Release 8.4:**
  - Only the SNMP manager in the default routing instance (inet.0) had access to MIB objects.

- **With Increased VPN Service Offerings:**
  - This feature is particularly useful for service providers who need to obtain SNMP data for specific routing instances. Service providers can use this information for their own management needs or export the data for use by their customers.

#### SNMP Agent Behavior
- **If No Routing Instance is Specified:**
  - For non-routing table objects, all instances are exposed.
  - For routing table objects, only those associated with the default routing instance are exposed.
  
- **Protocol Data Units (PDUs):**
  - The actual PDUs are still exchanged over the default (inet.0) routing instance, but the data contents returned are determined by the routing instance specified in the request PDUs.

### SNMPv3 Management Routing Instance

#### Overview
- **Starting in Junos OS 19.4R1:**
  - You can access information related to all routing instances and logical system networks by configuring the SNMPv3 management interface in a required routing instance. The management instance configuration statement is configured at the `[edit snmp v3]` hierarchy level.

#### Benefits
- **SNMPv3 Management Routing Instance:**
  - Enables all SNMPv3 requests from non-default routing instances as if they were from the default routing instance.
  - Allows access to information related to all routing instances and logical system networks.

#### Configuration
- **Enable the Management Routing Instance:**
  1. Configure the `management-instance` statement:
     ```shell
     [edit]
     user@host# set snmp v3 management-routing-instance
     ```
  2. Commit the configuration:
     ```shell
     [edit]
     user@host# commit
     ```

- **Remove the Management Routing Instance:**
  1. Delete or deactivate the SNMPv3 management routing instance statement:
     ```shell
     [edit]
     user@host# delete snmp v3 management-routing-instance
     ```

- **Note:**
  - You cannot configure the Junos management routing instance (mgmt_junos) at the `[edit snmp v3 management-routing-instance]` hierarchy level since it has access to all routing instances by default.

### MIBs Supported for Routing Instances

#### Table 28: MIB Support for Routing Instances (Juniper Networks MIBs)

| Object | Support Class | Description/Notes |
|--------|---------------|--------------------|
| jnxProducts(1) | – | Product Object IDs |
| jnxServices(2) | – | Services |
| jnxMibs(3) | Class 3 | Objects are exposed only for the default logical system. |
| jnxBoxAnatomy(1) mpls(2) | Class 2 | All instances within a logical system are exposed. Data will not be segregated down to the routing instance level. |
| ifJnx(3) | Class 1 | Only those logical interfaces (and their parent physical interfaces) that belong to a specific routing instance are exposed. |
| jnxAlarms(4) | Class 3 | Objects are exposed only for the default logical system. |
| jnxFirewalls(5) | Class 4 | Data is not segregated by routing instance. All instances are exposed. |
| jnxDCUs(6) | Class 1 | Only those logical interfaces (and their parent physical interfaces) that belong to a specific routing instance are exposed. |
| jnxPingMIB(7) | Class 3 | Objects are exposed only for the default logical system. |
| jnxTraceRouteMIB(8) | Class 3 | Objects are exposed only for the default logical system. |
| jnxATM(10) | Class 1 | Only those logical interfaces (and their parent physical interfaces) that belong to a specific routing instance are exposed. |

### Support Classes for MIB Objects

- **Class 1:**
  - Data is segregated according to the routing instance in the request. This is the most granular of the segregation classes.
  
- **Class 2:**
  - Data is segregated according to the logical system specified in the request. The same data is returned for all routing instances that belong to a particular logical system. Typically, this applies to routing table objects where it is difficult to extract routing instance information or where routing is managed at the logical system level.

- **Class 3:**
  - Objects are exposed only for the default logical system.

- **Class 4:**
  - Data is not segregated by routing instance. All instances are exposed.

### Summary
To support routing instances, MIB objects fall into one of the following categories:
- **Class 1:** Data is segregated according to the routing instance in the request.
- **Class 2:** Data is segregated according to the logical system specified in the request.
- **Class 3:** Objects are exposed only for the default logical system.
- **Class 4:** Data is not segregated by routing instance; all instances are exposed.

This structured approach ensures that SNMP data is managed and accessed appropriately based on the routing instance and logical system context.
