Assistant: This log chunk shows that the system is attempting to renew a lease for [DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1] and is also attempting to contact the RM server at msra-sa-41:8030. However, the system is detecting address changes for both the lease renewal and the RM server, and is unable to contact the RM server. The system is retrying both the lease renewal and the RM server connection, but is unable to successfully complete either.
