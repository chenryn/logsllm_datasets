  * I tried using the latest `xxxx/xxxx.d.ts` file in this repo and had problems.
  * I tried using the latest stable version of tsc. https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript
  * I have a question that is inappropriate for StackOverflow. (Please ask any appropriate questions there).
  * I want to talk about `knex/knex.d.ts`.

It looks like the knex.d.ts definition file declares a dependency on bluebird
2.0 typings. The current version of knex.js relies in the 3.x branch of
bluebird. Using bluebird (3.0) at the top level and knex in the same project
results in `error TS2300 Duplicate identifier 'export='` errors, as the type
system seems to be looking at both types/bluebird (for 3.0) and
types/knex/node_modules/types/bluebird (for 2.0). Manually modifying the
package.json and types/knex directories in my node_modules directory clear
this problem up.
