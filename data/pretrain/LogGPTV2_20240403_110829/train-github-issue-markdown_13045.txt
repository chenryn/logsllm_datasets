I encountered issues while attempting to use the latest `xxxx/xxxx.d.ts` file from this repository. Here are the details and steps I have taken:

1. I used the latest stable version of TypeScript, as indicated on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript).
2. My inquiry is not suitable for StackOverflow. (Please direct any appropriate questions there.)
3. I would like to discuss the `knex/knex.d.ts` file.

### Issue with `knex/knex.d.ts`

The `knex.d.ts` type definition file declares a dependency on Bluebird 2.0 typings. However, the current version of knex.js relies on the 3.x branch of Bluebird. When using Bluebird 3.0 at the top level and knex in the same project, I encounter the following error:

```
error TS2300: Duplicate identifier 'export='
```

This error occurs because the TypeScript compiler is looking at both `@types/bluebird` (for 3.0) and `@types/knex/node_modules/@types/bluebird` (for 2.0).

### Temporary Solution

To resolve this issue, I manually modified the `package.json` and `@types/knex` directories in my `node_modules` directory. This cleared up the problem, but it is not an ideal long-term solution.

### Request for Assistance

Could the maintainers or contributors of `knex/knex.d.ts` please update the type definition to be compatible with Bluebird 3.0? This would help avoid the duplicate identifier errors and provide a more seamless experience for users.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
