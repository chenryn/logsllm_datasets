Actually,  the  system  unsafety  should  depend  on  the 
number  of  vehicles  in  each  platoon  that  might  be 
affected  by  failures.  The  number  of  vehicles  depends 
on  the  frequency  at  which  vehicles  join  and  leave  the 
platoon. In order to have a better understanding of the 
combined  influence  of  the  join  and  leave  rates,  we 
analyze the evolution of system unsafety as a function 
of the load of the system  =

n=10 vehicles/platoon, join rate=12/hr, leave rate=4/hr  
Figure  12  shows  the  impact  of  the  failure  rate  on 
system  unsafety  when  the  maximum  number  of 
vehicles  per  platoon,  n,  increases  from  10  to  18, 
considering  6  hour  trip  duration.  We  can  see  that  the 
failure  rate  has  more  impact  for  smaller  number  of 
vehicles per platoon.  
Figure 13:  S (t) versus trip duration 
different join and leave rates,  =10-5/hr, n=8  
The results are plotted in Figure 13 considering the 
case  =1 and  =2, with different values for the join and 
leave  rates.  It  is  interesting  to  see  that  similar  trends 
are  observed  for  all  the  curves  corresponding  to  the 
same 
,  with  the  highest  unsafety  observed  for  the 
highest join rate. 
Comparison of the results corresponding to different 
values  of   and  a  fixed  value  of  the  leave  rate  shows 
that  the  highest  value 
leads  to  the  highest  level  of 
unsafety. However, the results are of the same order of 
magnitude.  
4.4. Influence of coordination strategy   
All  the  results  presented  in  Sections  4.2  and  4.3 
correspond  to  the  case  of  a  decentralized  inter-  and 
intra-platoon  coordination  strategy  (DD).  Figure  14 
compares the unsafety for the four strategies presented 
in Table 3: DD (Decentralized inter- and intra-platoon) 
DC (Decentralized inter-platoon and Centralized intra-
platoon),  CD 
and 
Decentralized  intra-platoon),  and  CC  (Centralized 
inter-  and  intra-platoon).  We  can  see  that  the  inter-
platoon  strategy  has  more  impact  than  the  intra-
platoon,  with  a  higher  safety  observed  for 
the 
decentralized  inter-platoon  strategy.  This  is  due  to the 
fact  that  more  vehicles  are  involved  in  the  centralized 
inter-platoon coordination (see Section 2.2.1).

In this  paper, we  have presented a modeling approach 
to evaluate the safely of an automated highway system. 
The  models  take  into  account  the  failure  modes 
affecting  vehicles,  their  severity  level,  and  their 
associated 
recovery  maneuvers.  The  modeling 
approach  has  been  designed  to  master  the  complexity 
of  the  models  taking  into  account  the  dynamic 
evolution of the highway system. The proposed models 
are  based  on  stochastic  activity  networks.  The  system 
model is elaborated based on submodels characterizing 
the  vehicles  behavior  resulting  from  failures  and 
recovery  maneuvers,  that  are  then  replicated  and 
composed with other submodels describing the system 
configuration and its dynamic evolution as the result of 
vehicles joining and leaving the highway. 
To  illustrate  the  feasibility  of  the  approach  and  the 
kind of results that can be achieved, we considered the 
case  of  a  highway  composed  of  two  platoons.  We 
performed  sensitivity  studies  to  analyze  the  impact  of 
several  parameters  on  the  safety  of  an  automated 
highway  system:  the  failure  rates  associated  with 
failure modes affecting vehicles, the maximum number 
of  vehicles  per  platoon,  and  different  coordination 
strategies.  In  particular,  the  analyses  we  made  have 
allowed  us  to  quantify  and  perform  a  comparative 
analysis of the level of safety that can be expected with 
the  system  studied  for  different  configurations  and 
parameters ranges.   
Figure 14:  S (t)  versus trip duration  
n=10,  =10-5/hr, join rate=12/hr, leave rate=4/hr  
The impact of the coordination strategy is low even 
for  higher  values  of  n.  This  is  shown  in  Figure  15 
where  the  system  unsafety  at  t  =  6hrs  is  plotted  for 
different values of n.  
5. Conclusion and future work

The work and results presented in this paper can be 
considered  as  a  preliminary  step  in  addressing  the 
safety  evaluation  of  automated  highway  systems. 
Nevertheless, 
results  already  provide  some 
preliminary  indication  about  the  following  factors:  1)
