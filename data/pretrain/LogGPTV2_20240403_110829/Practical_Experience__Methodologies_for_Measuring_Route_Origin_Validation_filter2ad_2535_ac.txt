### Mathematical Formulation

The following expressions define the conditions for the indicators \( v \), \( v' \), and \( v'' \):

1. **Indicator \( v \)**:
   \[
   v(d, A, \rho) = 
   \begin{cases} 
   1 & \text{if } \forall P \in \{P_1, P_2\}, R(d, P, A, \rho) = 1 \\
   0 & \text{otherwise}
   \end{cases}
   \]

2. **Indicator \( v' \)**:
   \[
   v'(d, A, \rho) = 
   \begin{cases} 
   1 & \text{if } \exists P \in \{P_1, P_2\}, R(d, P, A, \rho) = 1 \land (P, A) \notin \rho \\
   0 & \text{otherwise}
   \end{cases}
   \]

3. **Indicator \( v'' \)**:
   \[
   v''(d, A, \rho) = 
   \begin{cases} 
   1 & \text{if } \exists P \in \{P_1, P_2\}, R(d, P, A, \rho) = 1 \land (P, A) \in \rho \\
   0 & \text{otherwise}
   \end{cases}
   \]

### Interpretation of Indicators

- **Indicator \( v \)**: This symbol indicates probe destinations \( d \) that, within the time frame \( \rho \), delivered only responses to addresses in the correct prefix according to the valid ROA set for AS \( A \).
- **Indicator \( v' \)**: This symbol indicates destinations \( d \) that, at least once, delivered a response to AS \( A \) which contradicted the ROA in the time frame \( \rho \).
- **Indicator \( v'' \)**: This symbol indicates destinations \( d \) that, within the time frame \( \rho \), delivered at least one response to AS \( A \) according to valid ROAs.

Using these indicators, we can define groups of destination IP addresses. The upper bound group is defined as:

\[
\{d | \forall i, j \in \{1, 2\} : v(d, A_i, \rho_j) = 1 \land v'(d, A_i, \rho_j) = 0\}
\]

However, this upper bound is too permissive because it includes all destinations for which there is no negative evidence, even those that do not respond to any probes. More precise requirements yield the following sets:

- **Likely Protected**: 201 (0.03%)
- **Unresolvable**: 45163 (6.66%)

### Probing Results

The results contain a considerable number of unresolved destinations that failed to consistently respond to at least one of the ASes \( A_1 \) or \( A_2 \). The probing batches consist of three uniform probes sent with approximately 3-second delays between them. Packet loss percentage for each destination was determined from all measurement batches and from both capturing points in \( A_1 \) and \( A_2 \) combined. A destination was marked as unresolvable if it exhibited more than 90% packet loss for at least one prefix of \( P_1 \) or \( P_2 \), as the absence of negative evidence in these cases might be due to packet loss rather than ROA validation. Additionally, we observed a considerable number of random routing cases (inconsistent routing behavior within or among probing batches), which were classified as unprotected.

### Comparison of Approaches

Figure 6 compares the results from the three methods. The higher percentage of protected entities found by the control-plane analysis and the Atlas traceroute experiment suggests that these measurement platforms may introduce a positive selection bias towards progressive technologies and better network management. The active TCP probing experiment confirmed that Internet core autonomous systems do not deploy ROV, but there are some indisputable ROV deployments that have the potential to protect certain portions of regional traffic. Unfortunately, large-scale ROV deployments were not found.

### Benefits from ROV Adoption

Our results indicate that very few ASes enforce ROV—less than previous evaluations showed [13], [21]. To understand the impact on Internet security against prefix hijacks, we performed simulations on empirically derived datasets. Our simulations compute BGP routes using methods in [26], [27], [28] over the CAIDA AS-connectivity graph from December 2016. The results average over 10^6 combinations of attacker and victim ASes, both selected uniformly at random from the set of all ASes, as in [26], [28]. Figure 7 shows the projected upper bound of ROV adoption's impact on the number of autonomous systems that would not be affected by simulated hijacking incidents, thus improving routing security in the Internet.

### Security Against BGP Prefix Hijacks

In this section, we demonstrate the impact of current ROV adoption on the security of the Internet against BGP prefix hijacks and provide recommendations for countermeasures.

### Countermeasures

Given the state of security against prefix hijacks, the adoption of ROV is paramount. However, our results show that ROV adoption is essentially non-existent. One of the main obstacles to wide enforcement of ROV is the concern about traffic loss if ROV is applied, mainly due to problematic ROAs, often caused by errors in ROA issuance and lack of coordination between different providers and customers. We recommend a two-step solution: detect erroneous ROAs and then apply ROV only on ROAs that appear to be correct.

- **Step 1**: Use tools like roalert.org to validate whether an AS has a valid ROA.
- **Step 2**: Identify and ignore problematic ROAs, filtering BGP announcements only according to 'good' ROAs.

### Conclusions

ROV enforcement by ASes is critical to protecting the Internet against BGP prefix hijacks. Previous efforts on measuring ROV adoption focused on uncontrolled [13] and controlled [21] control-plane experiments. We demonstrate that the control-plane provides an inaccurate estimate of the number and percentage of ROV adopters. We provide two new approaches and describe our experiments based on them. We show that the percentage of adopters is smaller than found in previous research and that the current ROV-enforcing ASes have only a negligible impact on Internet security. We provide recommendations for tackling the main problem hindering wide deployment of ROV—the erroneous ROAs.
