titleblackhat:eu-18 A Measured Response to a Grain of Rice
Over time, our hardware has become smaller, faster, cheaper - and also incredibly more complicated. Just like with software, this complexity brings with it both increased attack surfaces and a more difficult detection problem.Unfortunately right now, when it comes to hardware attacks, the discourse is focused on sensationalism. We've got reports of devices few people have heard of, doing things few people realize is possible, perhaps happening on a scale fewer people understand. When it comes to hardware details, they're incomprehensible to laypeople, as well as to most software security experts.I'll start with a background on real examples of what we'd call 'hardware implants' to set the context and understand the scenarios where hardware implants make sense. We'll examine a few recent cases of claimed hardware implants to understand how we can classify them in terms of complexity and risk. With that information, we can then make rational decisions on where these and other hardware threats fit in your threat model.With these examples in hand, you will better understand when it make sense to respond to hardware threats, as well as how to prioritize your response to best reduce your overall risk.
