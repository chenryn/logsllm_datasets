**Analysis and Solution for Log Error**

**Log Entry:**
```
[Sun Dec 04 17:43:12 2005] [error] mod_jk child init 1 -2
```

**Error Analysis:**
- **Existence of Exception:** Yes, the log entry indicates an error.
- **Exception Type:** Web server application exception.
- **Error Description:** This error occurs when the Apache web server attempts to start a child process through the `mod_jk` module. Specifically, it indicates that child process 1 encountered an initialization error with a return code of `-2`.

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Insufficient System Resources:** The child process may fail to start due to insufficient system resources such as memory or disk space.
2. **Permission Issues:** There might be a problem with the sub-process permission settings, preventing the child process from starting correctly.

**Recommended Solutions:**
1. **Check System Resources:**
   - **Memory:** Ensure that the server has sufficient available memory. Use tools like `top`, `free -m`, or `htop` to monitor memory usage.
   - **Disk Space:** Verify that there is enough free disk space. Use commands like `df -h` to check disk usage.

2. **Verify Permission Settings:**
   - Ensure that the user running the Apache server has the necessary permissions to start and manage child processes. Check the configuration files and the user/group settings in the Apache configuration (e.g., `httpd.conf`).

3. **Restart Apache Server:**
   - After addressing any resource or permission issues, restart the Apache web server to apply the changes and ensure that the service is running normally. You can use the following command to restart Apache:
     ```sh
     sudo systemctl restart apache2
     ```
     or
     ```sh
     sudo service apache2 restart
     ```

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the error and ensure that the Apache web server operates correctly.
