User:  Please analyze whether the log contains error information, and if so, give the corresponding solution [Sun Dec 04 17:43:12 2005] [error] mod_jk child init 1 -2
Assistant: Existence of exception: Existence of exception Exception type: Web server application exception Exception reason/solution: This error log is an error that occurs when the Apache Web server starts a child process through the mod_jk module, showing that process 1 encountered a -2 error. The possible reason is that the sub-process fails to start due to insufficient system resources or a problem with sub-process permission settings. You should check the system resource status of the server, especially whether the memory and disk space are insufficient, and confirm whether the system permission setting is correct. After checking, you need to restart the Apache web server to ensure the normal service.
