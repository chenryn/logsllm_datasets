rights in actions or types. For example, (s)he can customize
rights to play a video segment 3 times or in a time period.
After the user ﬁnishes customizing the rights, the trigger

can also be reached to the content service.
It is worth noting that DRM is a special area for security.
We do not use any benchmark in our experiments. A DRM
system involves too many domains, for example, encryp-
tion/decryption, network transmission, the implementation
technology of the compliant client and servers; therefore,
there is no public benchmark so far.
7. Experiments
We conduct extensive experiments on the performance
of our proposed CS-DRM scheme and Phosphor. In this
section, the experimental setting is described at ﬁrst. Then,
extensive experimental results are reported to show the
eﬀectiveness and the eﬃciency of the CS-DRM scheme.
For the aspect of the eﬃciency, we only focus on the
license service, because the results of the experiments on the
7.1. Experimental Setting. Experiments run on both a cluster
of machines locally as a private cloud and the GAE platform
as a public cloud. In the private cloud, each local machine
has 4 single-core processors (2.1 GHz), 4 GB main memory,
and 1.5 TB hard disk. Each physical machine runs Ubuntu
9.04 with Java SE 6.0. In the experimental environment,
Hadoop 0.19.2 and HBase 0.19.3 are used as the datastore,
Apache Tomcat 6 as the http server, Axis2 as the web service
tool. In order to compare with private cloud environment,

feel intolerable or boring. Removing the time cost of these
artiﬁcial operations, our scheme has excellent eﬀectiveness.
7.3. Eﬃciency. As mentioned in Section 5.3, the low access
speed and long latency are two major factors limiting the
development of the mobile Internet. In the CS-DRM scheme,
the response time of the communication between cloud
clients and cloud services becomes the most important
indicator of the performance. Both the license service and
content service are deployed in the cloud. We consider that
the performance of these two services is the key for CS-DRM
to provide a better user experience. Naturally, the response
time for user requests is an appropriate indicator for the
performance. Here we focus on the life cycle of a license,
which is involved in the LAP.
In this experiment, we simulate simultaneous users
sending requests to license service for acquiring licenses and
calculate the response time—Total and Average. Total is the
running time from the ﬁrst user sending a request to the last
user receiving a response and represents the longest delay the
user may incur. Average is the average response time of each
user and is calculated as

the license service is also deployed on the GAE. However,
since we only have a free account of GAE, there are a
lot of limitations. For example, the maximum number of
simultaneous dynamic requests (users) is 30. It means that
we cannot simulate hundreds of users to connect the license
server concurrently. But it is enough for us to study the
performance of application services in both the private and
public clouds.
7.2. Eﬀectiveness. We run our program in the N76 to
illustrate the eﬀectiveness of CS-DRM according to a general
process. We divided the general process into four main steps
under diﬀerent scenarios. The ﬁrst scenario starts when a
user browses the content portal web site and ends when
(s)he selects her/his favorite. The second scenario starts
when the user clicks the “play” button to check for a
license for watching the content and ends when the rights
customization web page appears in the browser. The third
scenario starts when the user customizes the rights and ends
when (s)he acquires the license. The fourth scenario starts
when the user gets the license and ends when the user can
watch the media. As shown in Figure 10, we measure the
approximate running time of the whole general process,
which includes the time of artiﬁcial operations, such as ﬁlling
out forms.
Analyzing the running time of each scenario of CS-DRM,
we conclude that the third scenario takes more time than
other scenarios. It takes about 8 seconds in this scenario to
customize the rights, authenticate, and transmit the license.
Users need to do some artiﬁcial operations during the entire
process. Just because of artiﬁcial operations, users would not
where n is the number of simultaneous users and Timek is
the response time of the kth user. In this experiment, lots of
mobile phone simulators are utilized to run on computers,
because there are not enough physical mobile devices to
simulate hundreds of simultaneous users. The number of
simultaneous users for the private cloud increases from 50 to
500 with a step 50. Meanwhile, the number for GAE increases
from 5 to 30 with a step 5. If the number of simultaneous
users in GAE is bigger than 30, the error rate of requests
for GAE will raise extremely fast due to the limitation on
the maximum number of simultaneous requests for free. For
example, when the number of simultaneous users is 100, the
error rate is 78.4%.
As shown in Figures 11 and 12, both Total and Average
increase when the number of simultaneous users scales up.
Meanwhile, the total running time is a little longer than the
response time of the individual user. The results on both
GAE and the private cloud are reasonable. As shown in
Figure 11, for GAE, when the number of simultaneous users
is lower than the quota, the license service can get enough
resources to deal with requests without much latency. Also,
there are several interesting features. Firstly, Average of GAE
increases abruptly when the number of simultaneous users
increases from 5 to 10. But Average remains with very little
increase when the number increases from 15 to 30. For the
free account of GAE, we guess a watershed of the number of
simultaneous users is a number between 5 and 10. When the
number of simultaneous users is less than the watershed, one
cluster of machines can deal with the requests. If the number
of simultaneous users is larger than the watershed and lower
than the quota, another cluster of machines joins. The result
is that the simultaneous requests are dealt with without much
latency. Secondly, when the number of simultaneous users
reaches 30, less than 5% requests receive error responses,
