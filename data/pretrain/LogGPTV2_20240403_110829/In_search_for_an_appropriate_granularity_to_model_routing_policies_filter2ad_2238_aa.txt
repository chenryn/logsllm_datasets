ABSTRACT
Routing policies are typically partitioned into a few classes that
capture the most common practices in use today [1]. Unfortunately,
it is known that the reality of routing policies [2] and peering rela-
tionships is far more complex than those few classes [1,3]. We take
the next step of searching for the appropriate granularity at which
policies should be modeled. For this purpose, we study how and
where to conﬁgure per-preﬁx policies in an AS-level model of the
Internet, such that the selected paths in the model are consistent
with those observed in BGP data from multiple vantage points.
By comparing business relationships with per-preﬁx ﬁlters, we
investigate the role and limitations of business relationships as a
model for policies. We observe that popular locations for ﬁlter-
ing correspond to valleys where no path should be propagated ac-
cording to inferred business relationships. This result reinforces
the validity of the valley-free property used for business relation-
ships inference. However, given the sometimes large path diversity
ASs have, business relationships do not contain enough informa-
tion to decide which path will be chosen as the best. To model
how individual ASs choose their best paths, we introduce a new
abstraction: next-hop atoms. Next-hop atoms capture the different
sets of neighboring ASs an AS uses for its best routes. We show
that a large fraction of next-hop atoms correspond to per-neighbor
path choices. A non-negligible fraction of path choices, however,
correspond to hot-potato routing and tie-breaking within the BGP
decision process, very detailed aspects of Internet routing.

INTRODUCTION
The Internet is composed of a large number of independently
administered networks (Autonomous Systems or ASs), coupled by
the inter-domain routing protocol (BGP) into a single globe span-
ning entity. Inter-domain routing is controlled by diverse policies,

decided locally by each AS, and is not directly observable from
available BGP data. Those policies act globally across the entire
system [4]. Hence the topology of the inter-domain graph is not, in
itself, enough to model the reality of inter-domain routing. Policies
also need to be considered to capture the reality of the path choices
made by each AS.
Policies are not easily deﬁned [1] as they encompass the busi-
ness and engineering decisions made by each AS, both commercial
agreements (business relationships) and technical aspects (router
conﬁguration, inter-domain routing behavior, etc.). In this paper,
we aim to capture the appropriate level of detail about policies to
be used in a model of the Internet. Our ultimate objective, which
is not achieved yet in this paper, is to build a model of the Internet
with a sufﬁciently detailed view of the AS-level connectivity and
its policies so as to be able to have useful predictive capabilities
about BGP paths.
So far, models of the network structure have been mostly inter-
domain level models that do not care about details of the ASs [5–7].
However ASs are not simple nodes in a graph. Rather they consist
of routers spanning often large geographic regions. The internal
structure of an AS does matter. It inﬂuences inter-domain routing,
for instance via hot-potato routing [8,9]. Further, there are multiple
connections between ASs, typically from different routers in differ-
ent locations, which adds to the diversity of known routes [10, 11].
The main goal of this paper is to study the granularity of rout-
ing policies in the Internet as they are observed from BGP data
from multiple vantage points. We do not blindly rely on exist-
ing notions of routing policies such as business relationship infer-
ence [5,12,13]. Rather, we rely purely on what we observe in BGP
data and attempt to learn as much as possible about the “correct”
level-of-detail needed to model actual routing policies. Our main
concern is not to shrug off existing approaches, but to pinpoint their
advantages and disadvantages and how they are related to one an-
other.
Our approach is similar to that of [14], as we build an AS con-
nectivity graph that enables the propagation of all routes present in
observed BGP paths. To match observed routing, we introduce “ag-
nostic” policies, since it is impossible to infer all of the details of an
AS’s policies without access to router conﬁgurations. However, we
go beyond the agnosticism of [14] as we compare inferred policies
with business relationships. The gained insights are important for
our study of the right granularity to model routing policies.
Our work reveals two dimensions to policies: (i) which routes are
allowed to propagate across inter-domain links (route ﬁltering); and
(ii) which routes among the most preferred ones are actually cho-
sen (route choice) and thus observed by BGP monitors. In terms
of the ﬁrst dimension we show that the granularity of business
relationships is largely consistent with observed paths. AS rela-
tionships provide the right abstraction to prevent unnecessary paths
from propagating in a model of the Internet. For the second dimen-
sion, however, the classes of neighbors deﬁned by business rela-
tionships are not precise enough. When only business relationships
are used as policies in a model of the Internet, there are still many
possible candidate paths among which the best path can be cho-
sen. Business relationships are not sufﬁcient to determine among
all possible valid paths, which one should be chosen as best by the
model to be consistent with observed BGP data.
To crystallize the choice of paths an AS makes, we introduce a
new concept: next-hop atoms. Next-hop atoms capture the different
sets of neighboring ASs that each AS chooses for its best routes.
We show that a large fraction of next-hop atoms correspond to per-
neighbor path choices. A non-negligible fraction of path choices,
however, correspond to hot-potato routing and tie-breaking within
the BGP decision process, very detailed aspects of Internet routing.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2
introduces the BGP data used and presents our AS-topology model.
Section 3 analyzes the known bounds for policies studied in the lit-
erature. In Section 4, we search for the right granularity to model
policies: we infer per-preﬁx ﬁlter rules (Section 4.1) and compare
them with business relationships (Section 4.4). The insights gained
are important for Section 5 where we discuss the difference be-
tween routing policies and path choices.
In Section 5 we come
up with a new abstraction that captures the selection of paths by
ASs: next-hop atoms. The related work is described in Section 6.
Finally, Section 7 concludes and discusses further work.
2. AS-TOPOLOGY MODEL
To study the granularity of policies, we need a topology model
of the Internet. The measured routing data, used throughout this
paper, is described in Section 2.1. Section 2.2 describes some prop-
erties of the AS connectivity observed in this data, which precedes
our explanation in Section 2.3 of how the AS graph of our model is
built from the observed paths.
2.1 Data
Different techniques exist to collect BGP feeds from an AS. One
of the most common techniques is to rely on a dedicated worksta-
tion running a software router that peers with a BGP router inside
the AS. We refer to each peering session from which we can gather
BGP data as an observation point, and the AS to which we peer as
the observation AS.
We use BGP data from more than 1,300 BGP observation points,
including those provided by RIPE NCC [15], Routeviews [16],
GEANT [17], and Abilene [18]. The observation points are con-
nected to more than 700 ASs, and in 30% of these ASs we have
feeds from multiple locations.
As we are currently not interested in the dynamics of BGP we use
a static view of the routes observed at a particular point in time. The
table dumps provided by the route monitors are taken at slightly
different times. We use the information provided in these dumps
regarding when a route was learned to extract those routes that were
valid table entries on Sun, Nov., 13, 2005, at 7:30am UTC and have
not changed for at least one hour. In future work we are planning
to also incorporate the AS-path information from BGP updates.
Our dataset contains routes with 4,730,222 different AS-paths
between 3,271,351 different AS-pairs. An AS-level topology is
derived from the AS-paths. If two ASs are next to each other on
a path we assume they have an agreement to exchange data and
are therefore neighbors in the AS-topology graph. We are able to
identify 21,159 ASs and 58,903 AS-level edges.

2.2 AS-Level Connectivity
As already shown in [7,14], for an AS topology model to capture
route diversity, ASs cannot be considered atomic entities. In order
to represent the intra-domain routing diversity, we allow each AS
to consist of multiple quasi-routers. A quasi-router represents a
group of routers within an AS, all making the same choice about
their best routes. Thus the “quasi-router topology” does not rep-
resent the physical router topology of a network, rather the logical
partitioning of its observed path choices. An AS has to be mod-
eled with multiple quasi-routers if it receives and chooses as best
multiple paths towards at least one preﬁx.
Figure 1 provides the number of quasi-routers per AS that are
required to capture BGP path diversity. In any data analysis results
of this paper, we do not consider stub ASs, i.e., ASs that appear as
the last AS hop on any AS path in our data (pure originating AS)1.
Among the 3,535 remaining ASs, 267 require more than a single
quasi-router. Only 2 ASs need as many as 8 and 9 quasi-routers to
account for their observed routing diversity. Typically, well-known
tier-1 ASs require several quasi-routers. This is consistent with [10]
which showed, based on active measurements, that tier-1 ASs have
high path diversity. On the other hand, a low number of quasi-
routers per AS is due both to the sampling of the available paths of
the observed BGP paths, as well as the loss of BGP routing diver-
sity inside ASs [19].
Diversity of the AS paths is strongly related to the AS-level con-
nectivity. Figure 2, in which we consider the same 3,535 ASs as in
Figure 1, shows a scatterplot of the relationship between the num-
ber of required quasi-routers and the number of neighboring ASs.
We observe that ASs that do not have many neighbors also tend to
have a small number of quasi-routers. Highly connected ASs on the
other hand may have many quasi-routers, although this is not nec-
essarily always true. Some ASs have hundreds of neighbors, yet a
single quasi-router is enough to account for their routing diversity.
As previously stated, there are two reasons why an AS requires
several quasi-routers: (i) the AS receives and selects as best mul-
tiple paths towards a given preﬁx from a given neighbor; and (ii)
the AS receives and selects as best different paths towards a pre-
ﬁx but from different neighbors. From Figure 2, we can observe
that highly connected ASs have a far larger number of neighbors
than quasi-routers. ASs thus select a very small subset of best paths
compared to the number of paths they may receive from their neigh-
bors, for any preﬁx. Note that the ﬁrst reason why an AS might
need several quasi-routers does not seem to be common. For only
1Although being transit domains, some ASs may only have one AS
neighbor after removing stub ASs.

Figure 2: Relationship between number of neighboring ASs
and number of quasi-routers.
623 pairs of neighboring ASs do we observe in the data that an AS
chooses from one of its neighbors more than one path towards at
least one preﬁx. Further, in only 19 cases do we observe an AS
receiving more than 2 distinct paths from a given neighbor towards
at least one preﬁx.
2.3 Building a Quasi-Router-Level Graph
For our study of the granularity of routing policies we need a
topology model of the Internet. We capture the inter-domain con-
nectivity via an AS-topology graph as extracted from the BGP data
(see Section 2.1). In order to represent the intra-domain routing
diversity, we allow each AS to consist of multiple quasi-routers.
To ensure the connectivity of our model is minimal, the topology
is built when assigning to quasi-routers AS path sufﬁxes observed
in the data. A sufﬁx s of an AS path P is any substring Q such
that P = Qs. The AS topology we create has as few quasi-routers
per AS as possible, and an edge exists between two quasi-routers if
some sufﬁx has to be propagated between the two quasi-routers.
Our assignment works on a per-preﬁx basis. First we set all
quasi-routers as free to be assigned paths towards the considered
preﬁx, and set all sufﬁxes towards this preﬁx as to be assigned.
Then, as long as there are sufﬁxes that are not assigned, we try to
assign them by starting with those sufﬁxes closest to the originat-
ing AS(s) of the preﬁx. When assigning sufﬁxes, we ﬁrst re-use
existing connectivity between quasi-routers. If no link between the
ﬁrst two ASs on the sufﬁx can be re-used for this preﬁx, we then
create a new link between a free quasi-router in the ﬁrst AS on the
sufﬁx and the next AS. Note that the creation of the topology (links
between quasi-routers) follows directly from the path assignment.
Due to space limitations, we do not explain in detail how our AS
topology is built.
The number of necessary quasi-routers in an AS is not the only
parameter that matters for allowing an AS topology model to re-
produce the paths observed in BGP data. Even though only few
quasi-routers might be necessary to account for the routing diver-
sity of an AS [14], the way quasi-routers between two ASs are con-
nected also matters. If, in general, an AS requires the same number
of inter-domain links as it has neighboring ASs, it means that even
though this AS might have many neighbors, only a single neighbor
at a time is used as next hop AS in the best routes for any preﬁx. If
an AS in our model has substantially more inter-domain links than
neighboring ASs on the other hand, it means that the considered
AS uses several neighboring ASs for its best routes towards some
preﬁxes.
3,150 among the 3,535 transit ASs of our data require a single
inter-domain link with any of their neighboring ASs. Only 386 ASs
require more than one inter-domain link per neighbor, and 41 ASs
more than 2 inter-domain links. As seen from BGP data, only a
very small fraction of the ASs choose their best paths from several
neighbors at the same time towards any of their preﬁxes.
3. BOUNDS ON POLICY GRANULARITY
To ﬁnd an appropriate way to model policies in the Internet, it
is important to start with realistic bounds that deﬁne the ﬁnest and
coarsest granularities at which policies are applied in the Internet.
There are two ends to this spectrum. The ﬁnest granularity is the
one of BGP atoms [20, 21], which are sets of preﬁxes originated
by a given AS that receive equivalent treatment by routers in the
Internet. BGP atoms are as ﬁne as the set of policies that the ob-
served BGP paths encounter, which can be as ﬁne as on a per-preﬁx
basis. The coarsest granularity does not depend on the originated
preﬁxes, but only on the neighbors from which routes are received.
It is the granularity of business relationships. ASs may conﬁgure
policies as coarse as per-neighboring AS, hence treating all pre-
ﬁxes, received from a given neighbor, in the same way.
3.1 BGP Atoms
For inter-domain routing, each preﬁx is handled independently
from other preﬁxes. However, groups of preﬁxes may receive equal
treatment by a given set of BGP routers, due to the granularity of
routing policies. The analysis of BGP routing tables has shown
that clusters of preﬁxes originated by given ASs undergo the same
routing policies [20, 21]. Groups of preﬁxes (originated by a given
AS) that receive equivalent treatment by a set of BGP routers are
called BGP atoms [20, 21]. As BGP monitors see only a sample
of the outcome of routing policies through observed AS paths, not
the policies themselves, a BGP atom is deﬁned as a set of preﬁxes
that share the same set of AS paths as seen from a set of BGP
routers [21]. Two preﬁxes are put in the same BGP atom if their
AS-PATH is the same, as seen by all observation points. The ﬁnest
granularity of a BGP atom is a single preﬁx, whereas the coarsest
is all the preﬁxes originated by an AS (or a set of origin ASs in the
case of MOAS preﬁxes [22]).
Atoms’ sizes vary across and within origin ASs. A large fraction
of atoms consist of a single preﬁx, while some atoms consist of tens
of preﬁxes. As BGP atoms are deﬁned with respect to a given set
of vantage points, policies applied by single ASs might be coarser
than per BGP atom.
