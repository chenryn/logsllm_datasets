User: I have different versions of python installed on my mac. My system default python is ($ which python)
"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python". 
And if I install something with pip command such as pip install numpy, the package will be installed in the system python's site-package "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages"
However, I want to setup ipython & Qt working environment. So I brew install pyqt, brew install PySide And these packages are installed in my home-brew python pack-control part. My home-brew python is in "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages".
Now my python just can't import any Qt or PySide...
Any suggestions? How can I fix this?
Assistant: Use the /usr/local/bin/python instead of the system installed python.
brew doctor should tell you that /usr/local/bin is not early enough in your path. By putting /usr/local/bin first (or earlier than /usr/bin) in your path, your shell will find homebrew versions of executables before system versions.
If you don't want to adjust your path, you can invoke which python you want to run. /usr/local/bin/python instead of just python at the shell prompt.
