To set up a local domain name server on Windows Server 2019, please follow these steps:

1. Open **Server Manager** and select **Add Roles and Features**.
2. Click **Next** and select **Role-based or feature-based installation**.
3. Choose the server you want to configure and click **Next**.
4. In the **Server Roles** section, select **DNS Server** and click **Next**.
5. Confirm the features to be installed by clicking **Next**.
6. Click **Install** to install the DNS Server role.
7. Once the installation is complete, open **DNS Manager**. Right-click on the server name and select **New Zone**.
8. Follow the **New Zone Wizard** to create a new domain name zone. You can choose between primary, secondary, or stub zones based on your requirements.
9. In the **Resource Records** section, add the necessary DNS resolution records (e.g., A, CNAME, MX).
10. After completing the setup, test your DNS server to ensure it is functioning correctly.

**Important Notes:**
- Ensure that your firewalls and routers are properly configured to allow DNS traffic (typically on UDP and TCP port 53) to flow through your network.
- Verify that the DNS server is correctly configured as the preferred DNS server on your network clients.
- Regularly back up your DNS configuration to prevent data loss in case of unexpected issues.
