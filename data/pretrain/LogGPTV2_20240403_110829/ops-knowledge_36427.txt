User: So I installed python 2.7.11 a few months ago, now the class I'm about to take uses 3. So I installed 3 and it works fine. I also uninstalled 2.7.11 by going to applications and removing it, but going to terminal and typing which python, the directory is Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python, which means this it's still not removed.
What should I do...leave it alone? I only need Python 3, but this is bothering me a bit.
Thanks.
Assistant: This doesn't answer the question in the post's title, but leave Python 2 as the default python. If you want to run Python 3, you run python3 or maybe python3.4 or python3.5, depending on your installation. The system and other third-party software depend on python being Python 2. If you change it, you may encounter puzzles down the road. 
I'm not sure if having a third-party Python 2 is good (OS X ships with Python 2 already), but it should be fine.
Edit: Sorry, didn't see there was already an answer. It was posted as I was typing.
