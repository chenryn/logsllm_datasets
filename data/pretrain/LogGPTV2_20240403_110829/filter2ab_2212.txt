**ATT&CK ID:** T1577  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Compromise Application Executable

Adversaries may compromise applications installed on a device to establish persistent access to a victim. By maliciously modifying legitimate applications, adversaries can embed their own code, enabling these applications to execute adversary-controlled tasks when they are in use. This technique allows the attacker to maintain a foothold within the victim's environment while remaining undetected.
