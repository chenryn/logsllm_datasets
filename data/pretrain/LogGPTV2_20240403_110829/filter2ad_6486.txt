Abuse Detection and Prevention Systems at a Large Scale Video Sharing Website

1. Overview
Abuse on a large-scale website such as YouTube comes
in various forms — scraping, email spam, hate speech, or
“black-hat” search engine optimization to name a few —
and must be fought accordingly. The detection of abu-
sive behaviors uses supervised (machine learning) as well
as unsupervised algorithms to mine billions of requests and
predict the likelihood of abuse of each. We describe here
an unsupervised system scoring incoming trafﬁc for spam,
more speciﬁcally bot activity, through some simple statisti-
cal anomaly detection rules we found to be quite effective.
Each incoming record includes a number of characteris-
tics or entities, such as user id or IP address, used to group
the trafﬁc into slices; for each entity type we have a num-
ber of metrics known to correlate with anomalous behavior
in that large values, observed over large slices, reliably in-
dicate anomalous behaviour. Each metric, for each slice,
produces a score β ∈ [0, 1] which represents a conservative
estimate (0 for most slices), based on that metric alone, of
the proportion of undesirable (automated) trafﬁc.
We map metric values to scores using the key fact that
each metric is a log-ratio; thus the most standard outlier
detection method — ﬂagging as suspicious any value x of
metric X more than α standard deviations σ above the mean
µX — naturally extends into a scoring method by yielding
a goodness score γ = exp(− max(0, x − µX − ασ)), then
a badness (or spam) score β = 1 − γ. The quantity σ =
x combines two very different sources of noise :
the (weighted) standard deviation σX of the metric across
entities, and the sampling error σx on its measurement x.

2. Metric types
These metrics are implemented using Sawzall [3].
2.1. Ratio and Unique metrics
Assume we have a binary feature such that given a slice
of N records, the ratio q = C/N of records with that feature
on is cause for suspicion if well below its average p; the
associated ratio metric is RC = log(p/˜q), where the sample
estimate ˜q of q and its standard error σrC can be obtained
by standard methods [2]. The resulting spam score is quite
intuitive : say that ratio turns out 10 times smaller than it
should be, even taking into account the error margin, i.e.
rC = µRC + ασ + log(10); this will result in β = 0.9.
If we break this slice’s trafﬁc by another entity type or
dimension D (e.g. a user’s comments broken down by tar-
get video), an interesting extension using the “novelty” fea-
ture (“Is this a new video within this slice?”) replaces the
counter C with the number U of unique items along this
dimension, producing the associated unique metric UD.
2.2. Divergence and Concentration metrics

Assume the distribution P = {pd}d∈D along a certain
dimension is largely stationary (at least across its most com-
mon values); an extension of the ratio metric idea mea-

predominance of usually rare items, leading to KL(2)

of an extremely spread out reference distribution (pd (cid:28) 1)
we can, in practice, dispense with it entirely and use ab-
solute, rather than relative, entropy, leading to the concen-
