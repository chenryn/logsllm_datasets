Certainly! Here is an optimized and more professional version of the KQL (Kusto Query Language) query for detecting attempts to turn off System Restore:

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where InitiatingProcessFileName =~ "rundll32.exe"
    and InitiatingProcessCommandLine !contains " "
    and InitiatingProcessCommandLine != ""
    and FileName in~ ("schtasks.exe")
    and ProcessCommandLine has_any ("Change", "SystemRestore", "disable")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Filtering `rundll32.exe`**: The query starts by filtering events where the initiating process is `rundll32.exe`.
2. **Empty Command Line Check**: It then checks that the command line of the initiating process is not empty and does not contain any spaces.
3. **Created Process Check**: The query ensures that the created process is `schtasks.exe`.
4. **Command Line Analysis**: Finally, it looks for specific keywords (`Change`, `SystemRestore`, `disable`) in the command line of the created process to identify attempts to disable System Restore.

This query is more concise and clearly structured, making it easier to read and understand.
