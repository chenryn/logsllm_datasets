Abstract—To address the increasing demand for wireless
bandwidth, cognitive radio networks (CRNs) have been pro-
posed to increase the efﬁciency of channel utilization; they
enable the sharing of channels among secondary (unlicensed)
and primary (licensed) users on a non-interference basis. A
secondary user in a CRN should constantly monitor for the
presence of a primary user’s signal to avoid interfering with
the primary user. However, to gain unfair share of radio
channels, an attacker (e.g., a selﬁsh secondary user) may
mimic a primary user’s signal to evict other secondary users.
Therefore, a secure primary user detection method that can
distinguish a primary user’s signal from an attacker’s signal
is needed. A unique challenge in addressing this problem is
that Federal Communications Commission (FCC) prohibits
any modiﬁcation to primary users. Consequently, existing
cryptographic techniques cannot be used directly.
In this paper, we develop a novel approach for authenticating
primary users’ signals in CRNs, which conforms to FCC’s
requirement. Our approach integrates cryptographic signa-
tures and wireless link signatures (derived from physical radio
channel characteristics) to enable primary user detection in
the presence of attackers. Essential to our approach is a helper
node placed physically close to a primary user. The helper
node serves as a “bridge” to enable a secondary user to verify
cryptographic signatures carried by the helper node’s signals
and then obtain the helper node’s authentic link signatures
to verify the primary user’s signals. A key contribution in
our paper is a novel physical layer authentication technique
that enables the helper node to authenticate signals from its
associated primary user. Unlike previous techniques for link
signatures, our approach explores the geographical proximity
of the helper node to the primary user, and thus does not
require any training process.

I. INTRODUCTION
The proliferation of emerging wireless applications re-
quires a better utilization of radio channels [4]. To address
the increasing demand for wireless bandwidth, cognitive
radio networks (CRNs) have been proposed to increase the
efﬁciency of channel utilization under the current static
channel allocation policy [17]. They enable unlicensed users
to use licensed channels on a non-interference basis, thus
serve as a solution to the current low usage of radio chan-
nels [8]. For example, IEEE 802.22 Standard on Wireless
Regional Area Networks (WRANs) employs cognitive radio
to allow the sharing of geographically unused channels
allocated to television broadcast services, and therefore bring
broadband access to hard-to-reach low-population-density
areas (e.g., rural environments) [9].
In CRNs, there are two types of users: primary users
and secondary users [17]. Primary users are licensed users
who are assigned with certain channels, and secondary users
are unlicensed users who are allowed to use the channels
assigned to a primary user only when they do not cause
any harmful
interference to the primary user [17]. For
example, in IEEE 802.22 WRANs, TV transmission towers
are primary users, and radio devices that use TV channels
for communication are secondary users.
An essential issue in CRNs is primary user detection,
in which a secondary user monitors for the presence of a
primary user’s signal on target channels [4]. If a primary
user’s signal is detected, the secondary user should not use
those channels to avoid interfering with the transmission of
the primary user.
Existing methods for primary user detection can be cat-
egorized as energy detection and feature detection [17]. In
energy detection methods (e.g., [30]), any captured signal
whose energy exceeds a threshold is identiﬁed as a primary
user’s signal. In feature detection methods (e.g., [12], [25],
[26], [29], [37]), secondary users attempt to ﬁnd a speciﬁc
feature of a captured signal, such as a pilot, a synchroniza-
tion word, and cyclostationarity. If a feature is detected, then
the captured signal is identiﬁed as a primary user’s signal.
Due to the open nature of wireless communications and
the increasingly available software deﬁned radio platforms
(e.g., Universal Software Radio Peripherals (USRPs) [10]),
it is necessary to consider potential threats to normal op-
erations of CRNs. Indeed, CRNs do face several threats.
In particular, an attacker may transmit with high power or
mimic speciﬁc features of a primary user’s signal (e.g., use
the same pilots or synchronization words) to bypass the
existing primary user detection methods [4]. Consequently,
secondary users may incorrectly identify the attacker’s signal
as a primary user’s signal and do not use relevant channels.
Such attacks are called primary user emulation (PUE)
attacks [4].
It is necessary to have a secure primary user detection
method that can identify a primary user’s signal in the pres-
ence of attackers. At ﬁrst glance, a cryptographic signature
seems to be a good candidate for this task. Unfortunately,
CRNs face a unique constraint that prevents it from being
employed. Speciﬁcally, Federal Communications Commis-
sion (FCC) states that “no modiﬁcation to the incumbent
system (i.e., primary user) should be required to accom-
modate opportunistic use of the spectrum by secondary
users” [6]. As a result, any solution that requires changes
to primary users, such as enhancing primary users’ signals
with cryptographic signatures, is not desirable.
There has been a recent attempt that uses a location
distinction approach to distinguish between a primary user’s
signal and an attacker’s signal [4]. Speciﬁcally, this ap-
proach uses received signal strength (RSS) measurements
to estimate the location of the source of a signal, and
then determines if the signal is from the (static) primary
user based on the known location of the primary user [4].
However, as indicated in [23], RSS based location distinction
can be easily disrupted if an attacker uses array antennas to
send different signal strengths in different directions simul-
taneously. Moreover, it requires multi-node collaboration,
which is expensive in terms of bandwidth and energy.
Link signatures (i.e., radio channel characteristics such as
channel impulse responses) have been developed recently
to obtain more secure and robust location distinction [23],
[38]. Unfortunately, it remains non-trivial to exploit link
signature based location distinction approach for primary
user detection in the presence of attackers. In particular,
a receiver needs to know a transmitter’s historical
link
signatures in order to verify if a newly received signal is
from the transmitter. In CRNs, however, it is impossible for
a secondary user to know a primary user’s historical link
signatures, unless the secondary user can ﬁrst authenticate
whether a signal is from the primary user or not.
In this paper, we develop a novel approach that integrates
traditional cryptographic signatures and link signatures to
enable primary user detection in the presence of attackers.
Our approach does not require any change to primary users,
and thus follows the FCC constraint properly.
A key component of our approach is a helper node placed
close (and physically bound) to a primary user. Though we
cannot modify any primary user due to the FCC constraint,
we can put necessary mechanisms on each helper node,
including the use of cryptographic signatures. Moreover,
since the helper node is placed very close to the primary
user, their link signatures observed by a secondary user are
very similar to each other. The helper node thus serves
as a “bridge” that enables a secondary user to ﬁrst verify
the cryptographic signatures included in the helper node’s
signals, then learn the helper node’s authentic link signa-
tures, and ﬁnally verify the primary user’s link signatures. In
other words, our approach properly integrates cryptographic
signatures and wireless link signatures to enable primary
user detection in CRNs in the presence of attackers.
The contributions of this paper are summarized below:
• We develop a new primary user detection method that
integrates cryptographic signatures with wireless link
signatures to distinguish a primary user’s signal from
an attacker’s signal. Our method conforms to the FCC’s
requirement of not modifying primary users. Unlike the
previous approach [4], our method does not require the
deployment of a monitoring network, and thus avoids
the weakness of the previous approach.
• We develop a novel physical-layer authentication tech-
nique that enables a helper node to authenticate sig-
nals from its associated primary user. Unlike previous
proposals for link signatures, our approach explores
the geographical proximity of the helper node to the
primary user rather than historical link signatures. A
key consequence is that our method does not require
any training process.
• We evaluate the effectiveness of our method through
both theoretical analysis and experiments using real-
world link signatures obtained from the CRAWDAD
data set [22]. Moreover, we demonstrate the feasibility
of our proposed method by a prototype implementation
on a software-deﬁned radio platform [10].
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II
gives background information about link signatures. Sec-
tion III explains our assumptions and threat model. Sec-
tion IV gives an overview of our method. Sections VI and V
present the primary user detection at a helper node and
a secondary user, respectively. Section VII discusses the
experimental evaluation. Section VIII describes a prototype
implementation of our method. Section IX discusses related
work, and Section X concludes this paper.
II. PRELIMINARIES
In this section, we provide some preliminary information
on link signatures, which will be used for primary user
detection.
Radio signal generally propagates in the air over multiple
paths due to reﬂection, diffraction, and scattering [23].
Therefore, a receiver usually receives multiple copies of the
transmitted signal (See Figure 1). Since different paths have
different distances and path losses, signal copies travel on
multiple paths typically arrive at the receiver at different
times and with different attenuations [23]. The sum of those
signal copies forms the received signal. For the sake of
presentation, we refer to a signal copy that travels along one
path as a multipath component. For example, in Figure 1,
signals s1, s2, s3, and s4 are multipath components.
Multipath effect might be reduced by using directional an-
tennas. However, directional antennas usually cannot provide
perfect laser-like radio signals. For example, the beamwidth
of a 3-element Yagi Antenna, the most common type of
directional antennas, is 90 degrees in the vertical plane
and 54 degrees in the horizontal plane [18]. Thus, it is in
general hard to completely eliminate multipath effect. For
long distance transmission, the amount of multipath effect
seen by a receiver may be much more due to the reduced
focusing power at the receiver [2].

Example of a multipath effect. The wireless signal sent by
transmitter Tx is reﬂected by the ionosphere, a building, and the ground.
Thus, radio waves propagate over paths 1, 2, 3, and 4. The receiver Rx
receives signal copies s1, s2, s3, and s4 from paths 1, 2, 3, and 4, and the
received signal is the sum of all signal copies.
Note that a multipath component herein refers to a resolv-
able multipath component (i.e., the arrival of a multipath
component does not interfere with that of its subsequent
multipath component). Figure 2 is an example that shows the
difference between resolvable and non-resolvable multipath
components.

the arrivals of two multipath components do not interfere with each other.
Therefore, they are resolvable. In (b), the arrival of the second multipath
component interferes with that of the ﬁrst multipath component. Therefore,
they are non-resolvable.
A radio channel consists of multiple paths from a trans-
mitter to a receiver, and each path of the channel has a
response (e.g., distortion and attenuation) to the multipath
component traveling on it [23]. For convenience, we call
the response to each multipath component a component re-
sponse. Essentially, the channel impulse response is formed
by the superposition of many component responses, each
representing a single path [23]. Therefore,
impulse response, denoted by h(τ ), is given by
the channel
L
h(τ ) =
alejφl δ(τ − τl),
(1)
Xl=1
where L is the total number of multipaths, δ(τ ) is the Dirac
delta function, and al, φl, and τl are the channel gain, the
phase, and the time delay of the l-th multipath component,
respectively [23].
If a transmitter moves from one place to another, the
multiple paths from the transmitter to the receiver change,
and thus the channel impulse response also changes. As
a result,
the channel impulse responses can be used to
determine whether the transmitter changes its location or
not. A channel impulse response is referred to as a link
signature [23]. A location distinction algorithm using link
signatures has been proposed in [23]. Speciﬁcally, a history
of n link signatures are measured and stored while the
transmitter is not moving. For a newly measured link signa-
ture, the receiver computes the distance between the newly
measured link signature and the historical link signatures. If
the distance is larger than a threshold, then a location change
is detected.
III. ASSUMPTIONS AND THREAT MODEL
Our system consists of primary users and secondary users.
A primary user is assumed to be at a ﬁxed location (e.g.,
a TV broadcast tower) [4]. As stated by FCC, TV stations
and radio infrastructures should maintain physical security
through a combination of security personnel, card restricted
access, video surveillance, and other methods [27]. Thus,
we assume that primary users are physically protected and
any unauthorized entity cannot be physically close to a
primary user due to those physical protection methods. We
assume that secondary users are equipped with wireless radio
devices and are allowed to transmit signals on the channels
allocated to primary users only when the primary users are
not transmitting.
We assume that an attacker’s objective is to prevent other
secondary users from using the primary users’ channel and
get an unfair share of the bandwidth when the primary users
are not transmitting. Jamming attacks, which affect other
users as well as the attackers themselves, are thus not in the
scope of this paper.
We assume that attackers can mimic a primary user’s
signal and inject their fake signals into the primary user’s
channel. We assume that an attacker has the following
capabilities: (1) He knows the signal feature of a primary
user and is able to generate a fake signal with the same
feature. (2) He can transmit signals on the a primary user’s
channel to mislead the primary user detection process at
secondary users. (3) He has a large maximum transmit power
that can be several times of that of a primary user. However,
we assume that an attacker cannot be physically close to a
primary user due to the physical protection.
We assume all secondary users have reliable ways to
obtain the public key of each helper node, and an attacker
cannot compromise the helper node.
IV. OVERVIEW
Our goal is to provide secondary users with the ability
to determine whether a received signal is from a primary
user or not in the presence of attackers. One possibility is
to use the link signature of the received signal. However,
as discussed in the Introduction, it is non-trivial for any
secondary user to obtain the historical link signatures of a
primary user in an authenticated way, given FCC’s restriction
on (no modiﬁcation of) primary users.
In this paper, we develop a novel approach that integrates
traditional cryptographic signatures and link signatures to
enable primary user detection in the presence of attackers.
Speciﬁcally, we propose to place a helper node close (and
physically bound) to each primary user. Given the FCC
requirement on the physical security of primary users such
as TV stations, such helper nodes can also be physically
protected. Though we cannot modify any primary user due
to the FCC constraint, we do have the ﬂexibility to put
necessary mechanisms on each helper node, including the
use of cryptographic signatures. Moreover, since each helper
node is placed physically close to the primary user, their link
signatures observed by a secondary user are very similar to
each other.
To enable secondary users to authenticate signals from a
primary user, we propose to use the helper node associated
with the primary user as a “bridge”. Speciﬁcally, we propose
to have the helper node transmit messages when the target
channel is vacant. These messages include cryptographic
signatures, which will allow secondary users to verify their
authenticity. As a result, secondary users can authenticate
messages from the help node, then obtain the helper node’s
authentic link signatures, and ﬁnally verify the primary
user’s link signatures using those learned from the helper
node. Note that our approach does not require any change to
primary users, and thus follows the FCC constraint properly.
Issues of spacing multiple independent radio wave trans-
mitters very close to each other (e.g., on the same mast)
have been explored and demonstrated feasible [3], [19].
These techniques can be readily adopted to facilitate the
deployment of helper nodes close to primary users in CRNs.
For the sake of presentation, in this paper, we focus our
discussion on one primary user and its associated helper
node. However, all discussion in this paper applies to the
situations where there are multiple primary users and helper
nodes, as long as the association of each primary user and
its helper node is clear.
A. Technical Challenges
Two technical problems need to be resolved to make the
proposed approach work. First, the helper node has to have
a reliable way to detect primary user’s signals. In particular,
the attacker may target at the helper node. Note that the
proposed approach requires that the helper node transmit
messages to secondary users so that the secondary users can
obtain valid training link signatures. However, the attacker
may pretend to be the primary user and inject fake signals
into the target channel. This can effectively stop the helper
node, and the proposed approach will fail. Thus, it is critical
for the helper node to distinguish signals from the primary
users and those from the attacker.
At ﬁrst glance, this seems to be the same problem as
what we are trying to solve, and thus put us in a “chicken-
ﬁrst or egg-ﬁrst” situation. However, we will show that this
is not the case due to the proximity of the helper node
to the primary user. We will develop a novel physical-
layer authentication technique to enable the helper node to
properly authenticate messages from the primary users with-
out using any training link signatures. This is dramatically
different from traditional link signatures, where training is a
necessary part of the scheme. The details will be discussed
in Section V.
Second,
the interaction between the helper node and
secondary users must be properly protected with lightweight
mechanisms. In particular, the integration of cryptographic
signatures and link signatures is a critical component of the
proposed approach, and must be done efﬁciently. Moreover,
there has to be a mechanism to prevent the attacker from
replaying messages originally sent by the helper node. Oth-
erwise, the attacker may simply reuse the valid cryptographic
signatures to mislead secondary users into accepting invalid
training link signatures. We will discuss critical design issues
for the protocol between the helper node and a secondary
user in Section VI.
V. AUTHENTICATING PRIMARY USER’S SIGNAL AT THE
HELPER NODE
As discussed earlier, the helper node transmits signals
using the channels allocated to its primary user such that
secondary users can “learn” the link signatures of the
