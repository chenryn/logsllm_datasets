### System info

  * Operating System: All

### Source code
  * I provided exact source code that allows reproducing the issue locally.
**Config file**
**Test file (self-contained)**
    import { test as base } from '@playwright/test';
    export const test = base.extend({
      foo: [
        async ({}, use) => {
          // Some stuff here
          await use(); // TS error: Expected 1 arguments, but got 0.
          // Other stuff here
        },
        { auto: true }
      ],
    });
**Expected**
Allowing `use` to be called without arguments, as demonstrated in the docs
under Automatic Fixtures.
**Actual**
`Expected 1 arguments, but got 0.`
