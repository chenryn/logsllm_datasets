User: when I run the subl command, it just pauses for a moment and doesn't give me any feedback as to what happened and doesn't open. I am currently on windows 10 running the latest sublime text 3 build. I already copied my subl.exe from my sublime text 3 directory to my system32 directory. What am I missing? I've tried subl.exe ., subl.exe detect.py, subl, subl.exe
Please help me with this setup
Assistant: After adding a path environmental variable, you have just to type subl.exe in command prompt
