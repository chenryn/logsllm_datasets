User: Since Python 2.6 is backward compatible to 2.52 , did anyone succeeded in using it with Google app Engine ( which  supports 2.52 officially ).
I know i should try it myself. But i am a python and web-apps new bee and for me installation and configuration is the hardest part while getting started with something new in this domain.
( .... I am trying it myself in the meanwhile ....)
Thanks
Assistant: There are a few issues with using Python 2.6 with the SDK, mostly related to the SDK's sandboxing, which is designed to imitate the sandbox limitations in production. Note, of course, that even if you get Python 2.6 running with the SDK, your code will still have to run under 2.5 in production.
