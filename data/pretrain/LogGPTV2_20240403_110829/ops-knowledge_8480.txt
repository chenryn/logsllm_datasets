Question: Bob wants to update his iMessage Name and Photo Sharing preferences to reflect his new profile picture and nickname. What cryptographic processes will his iPhone perform to securely update and share this information with his contacts?
"A": "Bob’s device will randomize a 128-bit record key and derive three subkeys using HKDF-HMAC-SHA256. Each field (name, photo, and filename) is encrypted with AES-CTR using one of the subkeys.",
"B": "Bob’s device will generate a 256-bit key for each iMessage contact, encrypt his name and photo using AES-GCM, and then securely share the keys with each contact over iMessage.",
"C": "Bob’s device will create a digital signature for the name and photo using his private ECDSA key, which his contacts can use to verify the authenticity of the shared information.",
"D": "Bob’s device uploads the encrypted name and photo to the public CloudKit database under a RecordID, and when sharing, sends the RecordID along with the record key in the iMessage payload."
