ABSTRACT
Key establishment is a fundamental prerequisite for secure com-
munication in wireless sensor networks. A new node joining the
network needs to efﬁciently and autonomously set up secret keys
with his communication partners without the use of a central in-
frastructure. Most cited current research papers focus on a prob-
abilistic distribution of sets of keys from larger key pools to new
nodes. This results in unnecessary expensive communication and
memory consumption, growing linearly with the size of the net-
work, and guarantees secure connections only with a certain proba-
bility. This work presents a novel approach for efﬁcient and secure
key establishment of nodes joining the network by utilizing the fact
that communication in sensor networks follows a paradigm called
aggregation. Keys are split into shares and forwarded using dis-
joint paths in the network. The approach is self-organizing and
minimizes memory consumption as well as radio transmissions ef-
ﬁciently – down to logarithmic behavior.

INTRODUCTION
With the emergence of sensor networks in more and more situa-
tions of daily life, data security becomes an important aspect of this
new technology. In many scenarios, conﬁdentiality of transported
data can be considered as critical, like data from sensors measur-
ing patients health information, heartbeat or blood pressure details.
Since all data is transported wirelessly between nodes, it is typi-
cally prone to interception and eavesdropping. As a result of cost

or simple feasibility reasons, tiny sensor hardware is not tamper-
proof and therefore an attacker willing to eavesdrop or even modify
essential data might compromise a loyal node for his purposes or
add a malicious node to the network.
Consequently, data transportation starting from a sensor node
towards a data sink has to be protected against such threats. To
protect data, a security relation between communicating nodes has
to be initiated – usually by employing cryptographic keys. How-
ever, one of the crucial problems for security in wireless sensor
networks lies in the distribution and establishment of these keys
between nodes or in particular a new node joining a network and
the nodes it is going to communicate with. Tiny microprocessor-
based hardware of current sensor nodes with scarce memory and
processing power prohibits the use of complex security protocols
known from the PC/LAN world. Although public-key cryptogra-
phy is becoming feasible on these platforms, its frequent use is still
too expensive in terms of computing time and thus energy con-
sumption. Therefore key establishment should generally rely on
symmetric primitives. As wireless sensor networks lack permanent
available infrastructure components, new key establishment proto-
cols or schemes have to be self-organizing and must not rely on
key-distribution centers or any central authorities.
This paper presents a new, efﬁcient key establishment protocol
for sensor networks. It utilizes the fact that nodes in a sensor net-
work do not need to share keys with arbitrary other nodes in the
network but only with those nodes lying on their aggregation tree.
The beneﬁts are:
• Efﬁcient scaling with O(log n), n the number of nodes, be-
havior in terms of memory consumption and radio transmis-
sions. Related publications consume memory and radio en-
ergy with linear O(n) behavior. Our scheme uses only cheap
symmetric encryption.
• Key establishment between a joining node and his partners
in the network is done autonomously without usage of online
infrastructures like key-distribution centers.
• The protocol is able to support dynamic changes of aggrega-
tion and nodes leaving the network.
• In contrast to related work, if no unexpected node failure oc-
curs, this scheme guarantees secure key establishment not
only with a probability p  1 nodes. In every scenario, the attacker has a certain amount
of money, time, and effort he is able or willing to spend on com-
promising at most k nodes. As all nodes are assumed to be similar
difﬁcult to access and to compromise, his amount does not change
with the total number of nodes available. Consequently, by captur-
ing one or more nodes from the network, the attacker might pretend
to be a legal player to a new node entering the network. By imi-
tating good behavior, all compromised nodes might work together
and take part in an establishment protocol to get to know the new
key to be exchanged. Therewith, the attacker is capable of decrypt-
ing all further communications using this key. The major challenge
for a secure key establishment protocol is to cope with the pres-
ence of compromised nodes, not exactly knowing which nodes are
malicious.
In the following, ﬁrstly the presence of exactly one malicious
compromised node is assumed for simplicity and better understand-
ing. However, the key establishment scheme can be extended easily
to k attackers. First, 5.2 describes the scheme with the presence of
only one malicious node, Section 5.4 extends the scheme to cope
with k malicious nodes.
4.2 Use of a Master Device
Assume the situation of a new sensor node, say i, going to join
the network. Node i does not know anything about the network,
because i has just been bought. There must be something like an
initial deployment of trust or a trust anchor to i that will help i to
further establish keys and make it securely join the network. Such
a pairing for the network can never be done autonomously with-
out any user interaction, because otherwise an attacker would also
be able to legally add an arbitrary number of malicious nodes to
the network. Consequently, the user or a special device, the so
called Master Device (MD) representing the user, must establish
the initial pairing. The act of pairing itself, as a preparation for a
new node, can be done using a location limited channel, a secure
channel, e.g., physical contact, between MD and a new node [2].
This allows secure information exchange between MD and the new
node. Examples for appropriate Master Devices are rings or key
fobs like iButtons [6]. See [8] for a discussion on Master Devices.
User or MD interaction with the sensor network is only necessary
during an a priori pairing and the MD does not know anything about
the current network conﬁguration at all time: MD is stateless with
respect to the network topology or conﬁguration. During normal
sensor network operation, MD is ofﬂine and can not assist nodes,
so it is not an online server.
It is quite obvious that one has to take special care of an MD’s se-
curity. If an MD is stolen or compromised, an attacker may misuse
it to legally add malicious nodes to the network, give away secrets,
and thereby compromise the whole network. However, it is fair
to assume a tamper-proof, small, and handy MD which is carried
around by the user and taken special care of, e.g., a key fob.
4.3 Notation
This paper uses quite a simple notation: A symmetric key K
shared between node x and node y is called Kx,y. K is symmetric,
that is, Kx,y = Ky,x. Encryption of data using K is denoted
C = EK(data). Decrypting C is not explicitly used here.
5. KEY ESTABLISHMENT SCHEME
The key establishment scheme is deﬁned inductively. Assume
that at a certain point in time, a subtree of an even larger sensor net-
work’s aggregation tree looks like the example in Figure 2. Nodes
e, f and g send their measured values to b, which aggregates them
and sends the resulting aggregate to a and so on. The vertexes
in this graph simply indicate a direct aggregation-relation between
nodes. This implies that secret keys have been established between
adjacent vertices like g and b, but as discussed in Section 3, it is
important to notice that there are also pairwise keys between, e.g.,
g and a – keys between a node and every predecessor on its aggre-
gation tree. The actual network and key conﬁguration at this point
may be seen as an induction hypothesis. At this time, a new node,
say i, wants to enter the network. It will have to talk to aggrega-
tion nodes f, b, a, . . . as seen in Figure 2 and therefore keys must
