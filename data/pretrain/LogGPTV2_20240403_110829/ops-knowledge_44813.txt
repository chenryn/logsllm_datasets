User: Please describe the role of the cluster and list common cluster application scenarios.
Assistant: cluster is a collection of computing resources composed of multiple computers or servers, which can work together to achieve high availability and high performance. Common cluster application scenarios include: 1. Load balancing: By distributing requests to different servers, the purpose of load balancing is achieved, and the availability and performance of the system are improved. 2. High availability: By distributing the same application or data on multiple servers, when a server fails, other servers can continue to provide services, thereby ensuring high availability of the system. 3. Data storage: Use a distributed storage system to store data on multiple servers to ensure data security and reliability. 4. Computing cluster: Use multiple computers for collaborative computing to realize massive data processing, machine learning and other tasks, and improve data processing speed and efficiency. 5. Container cluster: Use container technology to package applications into individual containers, deploy and run them in clusters, and improve the flexibility and portability of applications.
