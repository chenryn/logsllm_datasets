ﬁnding surprising since these sectors have robust incentives
for security investments. While the ﬁnance sector, and pos-
sibly the government sector as well, are often not willing
to collaborate with non-commercial white hats [3], we infer
from the Wooyun data that they can disproportionally bene-
ﬁt from the involvement of the white hat community. Partic-
ipating in disclosure programs may also reduce the likelihood
that vulnerabilities ﬂow into the black market [21].
Portal sites, telecommunication and e-commerce organi-
zations have the highest number of vulnerability reports
in the IT-sector. A possible explanation is that web ser-
vices and systems from these domains are large and com-
plex which increases the amount of latent vulnerabilities.
Further, these companies serve substantial user populations
which increases their desirability for vulnerability researchers.
4.3.4 Response and Resolution
After the initial submission of a vulnerability report, the
typical follow-up process on most bounty platforms con-
tains the following steps: triage/conﬁrm, resolve, and dis-
close. During this process, the white hat and the secu-
rity/development team of the organization may collaborate
together to address the identiﬁed problem. A delayed re-
sponse likely increases the risk of a security breach, since it
increases the time frame for rediscovery of the vulnerabil-
ity, and stealthy exploitation of stockpiled vulnerabilities by
malicious agents. Given its full disclosure policy, a delayed
response to a submission on Wooyun may be even more se-
rious because details will be disclosed publicly after 45 days.

bility reports (per month) on Wooyun.

ties by organizations on Wooyun and

Figure 12: Number of vulnerability re-
ports for non-IT businesses (left), and
IT-sector businesses (right) on Wooyun.
Our data allows us to examine how organizations respond
and resolve vulnerability reports in the studied ecosystems.
HackerOne maintains a detailed handling history for each
vulnerability report. Unfortunately, only a small portion of
all resolved reports (732 of 10,997) are publicly disclosed.
For these disclosed reports, we determined the time distri-
bution for three types of response activities (see Figure 13).
The median time for the ﬁrst response (e.g., a conﬁrma-
tion of receiving the report) is 0.18 days, and the median
time for triage is 0.88 days. The median resolve time is 6.49
days, and 75% of the disclosed reports are resolved in 25
days. However, one should be cautious when generalizing
from these observations since the data is possibly biased.
Particularly, the analysis likely underestimates the time re-
quired for triaging and resolving vulnerabilities, since the
organizations that are willing to disclose vulnerabilities may
be more eﬃcient in handling reports and may have more
experience in running bounty programs.
Figure 13: Boxplots for the time of three types of response
activities based on publicly disclosed reports on HackerOne.
Wooyun shows four types of responses by organizations:
conﬁrmed by organization (CO), conﬁrmed and handled by
a third party such as CNCERT (CT), ignored by the or-
ganization (IG), and no response (NO). Since all reports
are classiﬁed in this way, the Wooyun response data is con-
siderably larger, but provides less details. For example, it is
diﬃcult to discern whether the organization eventually ﬁxed
the vulnerability (or not), but the ﬁrst two types of response
can serve as an indication that the organizations recognizes
the problem. The third type of response suggests that the
organization considers the vulnerability report invalid. The
fourth type means that the organization did not respond to
the report at all. We use the count of the fourth type as
a rough estimate for the number of cases when an organi-
zation fails to address a vulnerability report, and consider
the other three types of responses as situations when the
vulnerability is likely being handled.

Table 4: Percentages of diﬀerent types of responses by or-
ganizations on Wooyun.
Table 4 shows the percentages for the diﬀerent types of
response as a breakdown by the popularity of the websites.
We observe that overall, the majority (77%) of the vulnera-
bility reports have been handled. Popular websites address
more vulnerabilities by themselves, while less popular web-
sites rely more often on third parties. In addition, less pop-
ular websites have a higher rate of no response, possibly due
to limited resources for vulnerability management.
4.3.5 Monetary Rewards
We also examine the role of monetary rewards oﬀered by
some organizations. We observe that in their absence, white
hats still make contributions to Wooyun and HackerOne for
the purpose of making the Internet safer and for reputation
gains. For example, 33 of the public programs on HackerOne
do not provide monetary rewards, yet they still have received
1201 valid reports from the white hat community. But as
Table 1 shows, most platforms oﬀer monetary rewards as an
additional incentive for white hats to contribute their time
and expertise.
We conduct a preliminary analysis based on the disclosed
bounties for public programs on HackerOne. Given a total of
3886 bounties, 1638 have the amount information disclosed.
The maximum bounty is $7560, paid by Twitter, and the
average bounty amount is $424 which varies considerably
by organizations. Yahoo pays $800 on average, followed by
Dropbox ($702) and Twitter ($611). We hypothesize that
the current reward level is attractive to many white hats,
and we explore this topic in more detail with a regression
study in Section 4.3.7.
4.3.6
Improvements to Organizations’ Web Security
The participation in a bug bounty program should over
time improve the web security of an organization in a no-
ticeable way. In particular, it is reasonable to expect that the

web systems (and the stockpile of web vulnerabilities held
by black hats) would gradually diminish. Our data allows us
to investigate whether the number of vulnerability reports
per month is changing over time which is a relevant metric
in this context. Moreover, it is a type of analysis that can be
conducted by external evaluators if the bug bounty program
is public, and provides stakeholders an indication of the web
security of an organization. For example, the Cobalt bounty
platform oﬀers security seals for organizations that use their
services, which is expected to improve the public percep-
tion of the organization’s security [37]. Other services (e.g.,
cyber-insurance companies), can also beneﬁt from such se-
curity assessments (e.g., for the determination of insurance
premiums) [23, 25].
Figure 14: Trend of vulnerability report count for three or-
ganizations on Wooyun.
To initially explore this question, we show the vulnerabil-
ity report trends for three large organizations on Wooyun in
Figure 14. While one notices a slight decreasing trend for
Tencent, it is hard to observe a clear tendency for the other
two organizations. More importantly, Wooyun may not ex-
clusively host these organizations’ bounty programs which
could inﬂuence the analysis.
Figure 15: Trend of vulnerability report count for three or-
ganizations on HackerOne.
In contrast, HackerOne is tasked to exclusively host bounty
programs for participating organizations which ensures a
more reliable analysis. We show the vulnerability trends
for the three organizations with the most vulnerabilities on
HackerOne (Figure 15).
Interestingly, these organizations
have received a large volume of vulnerability reports right
after the launch of their bounty programs. We propose three
possible explanations. First, the monetary compensation of-
fered by HackerOne provides stronger incentives for white
hats to compete for vulnerability discoveries in the early
stage of a bounty program since the bounty program only
rewards the ﬁrst discoverer. Second, the target range for
white hats on HackerOne is much more limited compared
to Wooyun, thus concentrating white hats’ focus. Third,
some white hats might have stockpiled vulnerabilities to of-
ﬂoad them for reward in anticipation of the opening of new
reward programs. After these initial spikes, the number
of vulnerability reports on HackerOne drops signiﬁcantly,
possibly because the diﬃculty of ﬁnding new vulnerabilities
is increasing. However, even though we observe decreasing
trends, these organizations still receive a positive number of
vulnerability reports every month. These additional discov-
eries may either be related to further latent vulnerabilities
in existing code or stem from new code. Therefore, we sug-
gest that organizations continuously collaborate with white
hats.
To further examine the vulnerability trends for organiza-
tions, we apply the Laplace test [32] to the vulnerability
history of organizations who have received at least 50 re-
ports and have a bounty program for more than 4 months.
We also excluded data before 2012-02 and 2014-02 (the ini-
tial growth periods), for Wooyun data and HackerOne data,
respectively. This test indicates whether there is an increas-
ing trend, a decreasing trend, or no trend for the number of
reported vulnerabilities for a given organization (Table 5).

Table 5: Trend test results for organizations on Wooyun and
HackerOne. The conﬁdence level is 0.95.
Only 11 of the 109 organizations on Wooyun (which match
the criteria) ﬁt a decreasing trend, while most selected orga-
nizations have an increasing trend for the number of vulner-
ability reports. The data omission bias discussed previously
could be one reason of the result. A suﬃciently large pool
of latent vulnerabilities in combination with increasing ac-
tivity on Wooyun could serve as an alternative explanation.
For organizations on HackerOne, 32 of 49 have a decreasing
trend indicating a positive eﬀect of the vulnerability discov-
ery ecosystem.
The trend test, however, cannot completely assess the web
security status of an organization for several reasons which
we have partly discussed above. Further, as a possible part
of their vulnerability discovery strategy (see Section 4.2.3),
white hats might switch to new organizations or newly de-
ployed web systems which are expected to have more low
hanging fruits. In general, we suggest that a reliable assess-
ment requires careful modeling and statistical analysis of the
whole ecosystem which is an important area for future work.
4.3.7 Attracting Vulnerability Reports
How can an organization harvest more vulnerability re-
ports from the white hat community to improve its web
security? To address this question, we ﬁrst study the corre-
lation between the number of vulnerability reports per or-
ganization and the number of contributing white hats.
Figure 16 plots the number of white hats that have made
at least one discovery, and the number of vulnerabilities, for
each organizations (with at least 20 vulnerability reports) on
Wooyun and HackerOne. We observe very strong positive
linear (Pearson) correlations for these measures (as shown
in the ﬁgures). Therefore, the following strategies are likely

beneﬁcial: (1) While paying special attention to top con-
tributors is a useful strategy, it is also important to increase
the total number of contributors. A possible reason to ex-
plain the observed eﬀect is that vulnerability discovery re-
quires diversity, i.e., investigators with diﬀerent expertise
using diﬀerent tools may ﬁnd diﬀerent vulnerabilities; (2) It
is important to incentivize new participation, for example,
by oﬀering an extra bonus (e.g., badge or money) for the
ﬁrst valid submission of a white hat to a platform or speciﬁc
program.
Other factors such as the popularity of the target, the
expected bounty amount, and the number of alternative
choices are all related to a bounty program’s attractiveness
to white hats. To better understand these factors, we con-
duct a linear regression by taking the number of vulnerabil-
ity reports as the dependent variable and other factors as
independent variables, as the following equation shows:
Vi = β0 + β1Ri + β2Ai + β3Mi + i
where for each organization, Vi is the average number of
vulnerabilities per month, Ri is the expected reward, Ai is
the log Alexa rank of i’s website, and Mi is the average
platform manpower during the lifetime of organization i’s
bounty program. Mi is deﬁned as the time-weighted number
of white hats divided by the time-weighted number of peer
organizations during the lifetime of i’s bounty program:
