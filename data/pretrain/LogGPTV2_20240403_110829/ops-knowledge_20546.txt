**Subject: Issue Installing wxPython on Mac OS X 10.8.3**

I am currently trying to install wxPython on my Mac OS X 10.8.3, but I am encountering an issue. After downloading the disk image from the wxPython downloads page and mounting it, I receive an error message stating that the package is damaged and cannot be opened.

I have also attempted to open the package through the terminal, but this approach has not been successful.

Do you have any suggestions for how I can resolve this issue?

Thank you in advance for your assistance.

**Response:**

To resolve the issue you are facing, you can try the following steps:

1. Open **System Preferences**.
2. Navigate to **Security & Privacy**.
3. Go to the **General** tab.
4. Under the section labeled "Allow apps downloaded from," select **Anywhere**.

This should allow you to install the wxPython package. If you continue to experience issues, please let me know.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
