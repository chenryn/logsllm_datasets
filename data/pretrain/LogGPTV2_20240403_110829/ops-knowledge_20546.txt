User: I am trying to install wxpython onto my Mac OSX 10.8.3. I download the disk images from their downloads page and mount it. When I try to install the package I get an error that saying that the package is damaged and can't be opened. Any suggestions on how I can fix this?
I have also tried opening the package through the terminal but no luck.
Thanks in advance.
