Abstract
Cryptographic systems often rely on the secrecy of cryp-
tographic keys given to users. Many schemes, however,
cannot resist coercion attacks where the user is forcibly
asked by an attacker to reveal the key. These attacks,
known as rubber hose cryptanalysis, are often the easiest
way to defeat cryptography. We present a defense against
coercion attacks using the concept of implicit learning
from cognitive psychology.
Implicit learning refers to
learning of patterns without any conscious knowledge of
the learned pattern. We use a carefully crafted computer
game to plant a secret password in the participant’s brain
without the participant having any conscious knowledge
of the trained password. While the planted secret can
be used for authentication, the participant cannot be co-
erced into revealing it since he or she has no conscious
knowledge of it. We performed a number of user studies
using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk to verify that partici-
pants can successfully re-authenticate over time and that
they are unable to reconstruct or even recognize short
fragments of the planted secret.

Introduction
Consider the following scenario: a high security facility
employs a sophisticated authentication system to check
that only persons who know a secret key, possess a hard-
ware token, and have an authorized biometric can enter.
Guards ensure that only people who successfully authen-
ticate can enter the facility. Now, suppose a clever at-
tacker captures an authenticated user. The attacker can
steal the user’s hardware token, fake the user’s biomet-
rics, and coerce the victim into revealing his or her secret
key. At this point the attacker can impersonate the victim
and defeat the expensive authentication system deployed
at the facility.
So-called rubber hose attacks have long been the bane
of security systems and are often the easiest way to de-
feat cryptography [22]. The problem is that an authen-
ticated user must possess authentication credentials and
these credentials can be extracted by force [19] or by
other means.
In this work we present a new approach to preventing
rubber hose attacks using the concept of implicit learn-
ing [5, 17] from cognitive psychology.
Implicit learn-
ing is believed to involve the part of the brain called the
basal ganglia that learns tasks such as riding a bicycle or
playing golf by repeatedly performing those tasks. Ex-
periments designed to trigger implicit learning show that
knowledge learned this way is not consciously accessible
to the person being trained [17]. An everyday example
of this phenomenon is riding a bicycle: we know how to
ride a bicycle, but cannot explain how we do it. Section 2
gives more background of the relevant neuroscience.
Implicit learning presents a fascinating tool for design-
ing coercion-resistant security systems. In this paper we
focus on user authentication where implicit learning is
used to plant a password in the human brain that can be
detected during authentication, but cannot be explicitly
described by the user. Such a system avoids the problem
that people can be persuaded to reveal their password.
To use this system, participants would be initially trained
to do a speciﬁc task called Serial Interception Sequence
Learning (SISL), described in the next section. Training
is done using a computer game that results in implicit
learning of a speciﬁc sequence of key strokes that func-
tions as an authentication password. In our experiments,
training sessions last approximately 30 to 45 minutes and
participants learn a random password that has about 38
bits of entropy. We conducted experiments to show that
after training, participants cannot reconstruct the trained
sequence and cannot even recognize short fragments of
it.
To be authenticated at a later time, a participant is pre-
sented with multiple SISL tasks where one of the tasks
contains elements from the trained sequence. By ex-
hibiting reliably better performance on the trained ele-
1
ments compared to untrained, the participant validates
his or her identity within 5 to 6 minutes. An attacker
who does not know the trained sequence cannot exhibit
the user’s performance characteristics measured at the
end of training. Note that the authentication procedure
is an interactive game in which the server knows the
participant’s secret training sequence and uses it to au-
thenticate the participant. Readers who want to play
with the system can check out the training game at
brainauth.com/testdrive.
While in this paper we focus on coercion-resistant
user authentication systems, authentication is just the tip
of the iceberg. We expect that many other coercion-
resistant security primitives can be designed using im-
plicit learning.
Threat model. The proposed system is designed to be
used as a local password mechanism requiring physical
presence. That is, we consider authentication at the en-
trance to a secure location where a guard can ensure that
a real person is taking the test without the aid of any elec-
tronics.
To fool the authentication test the adversary is allowed
to intercept one or more trained users and get them to re-
veal as much as they can, possibly using coercion. Then
the adversary, on his own, engages in the live authentica-
tion test and his goal is to pass the test.
We stress that as with standard password authentica-
tion, the system is not designed to resist eavesdropping
attacks such as shoulder surﬁng during the authentica-
tion process. While challenge-response protocols are a
standard defense against eavesdropping, it is currently
an open problem to design a challenge-response proto-
col based on implicit learning. We come back to this
question at the end of the paper.
Beneﬁts over biometric authentication. The trained
secret sequence can be thought of as a biometric key
authenticating the trained participant. However, unlike
biometric keys the authenticating information cannot be
surreptitiously duplicated and participants cannot reveal
the trained secret even if they want to.
In addition, if
the trained sequence is compromised, a new identifying
sequence can be trained as a replacement, resulting in a
change of password.
We discuss other related work in Section 6, but brieﬂy
mention here a related result of Denning et al. [4] that
uses images to train users to implicitly memorize pass-
words. This approach is not as resistant to rubber hose
attacks since users will remember images they have seen
versus ones they have not, giving an attacker informa-
tion that can be used for authentication. Additionally,
image-based methods require large sets of images to be
prepared and used only once per user making the system
difﬁcult to deploy. Our combinatorial approach lets us
lower bound the entropy of the learned secrets, is simple
to set up, and is designed to leave no conscious trace of
the trained sequences.
User studies. To validate our proposal we performed
a number of user studies using Amazon’s Mechanical
Turk. We asked the following core questions that explore
the feasibility of authentication via implicit learning:
• Is individual identiﬁcation reliable? That is, can
trained users re-authenticate and can they do it over
time?
• Can an attacker reverse engineer the sequence from
easily obtained performance data from a trained par-
ticipant?
Across three experiments, we present promising initial
results supporting the practical implementation of our
design. First, we show that identiﬁcation is possible
with relatively short training and a simple test. Second,
the information learned by the user persists over delays
of one and two weeks: while there is some forgetting
over a week, there is little additional forgetting at two
weeks suggesting a long (exponentially shaped) forget-
ting curve. Finally, in a third experiment we examined an
attack based on having participants complete sequences
containing all minimal-length fragments needed to try to
reconstruct the identiﬁcation sequence: our results show
that participants do not express reliable sequence knowl-
edge under this condition, indicating that the underlying
sequence information is resistant to attack until longer
subsequences are guessed correctly by the attacker.
2 An Overview of the Human Memory
System
The difference between knowing how to perform a well-
learned skill and being able to explain that performance
is familiar to anyone who has acquired skilled expertise.
This dissociation reﬂects the multiple memory systems
in the human brain [14]. Memory for verbally reportable
facts, events and episodes depends on the medial tem-
poral lobe memory system (including the hippocampus).
Damage to this system due to stroke, Alzheimer’s dis-
ease neuropathology, or aging leads to impairments in
conscious, explicit memory. However, patients with im-
pairments to explicit memory often show an intact abil-
ity to acquire new information implicitly, including ex-
hibiting normal learning of several kinds of skills. The
types of learning preserved in memory-disordered pa-
tients are those learned incidentally through practice:
even in healthy participants the information thus ac-
quired cannot be easily verbally described.
Several decades of experimental cognitive psychology
have led to the development of tasks that selectively de-
2
pend on this type of implicit, non-conscious learning sys-
tem. These tasks typically present information covertly
with embedded structure in a set of experimental stim-
uli. Although participants are not attempting to learn this
structure, evidence for learning can be observed in their
performance.
The covertly embedded information often takes the
form of a statistical structure to a sequence of responses.
Participants exhibit improved performance when the re-
sponses follow this sequence and performance declines
if the structure is changed [12]. The improvement in
performance can occur completely outside of awareness,
that is, participants do not realize there is any structure
nor can they recognize the structure when shown [17].
The lack of awareness of learning indicates the mem-
ory system supporting learning is not part of the explicit,
declarative memory system and instead is hypothesized
to depend on the basal ganglia and connections to motor
cortical areas [6].
Less is known about the information processing char-
acteristics of the cortico-striatal memory system oper-
ating in the connections between the basal ganglia and
motor cortical areas. Most prior research has examined
learning of simple structures with small amounts of in-
formation, typically repeating sequences of actions 10-
12 items in length. However, more recent studies have
found that long, complex sequences can be learned fairly
rapidly by this memory system and that learning is rela-
tively unaffected by noise [18]. The ability to learn re-
peating sequences that are at least 80 items long rela-
tively rapidly and the fact that this training can be hid-
den within irrelevant responses (noise) during training
suggests an intriguing possibility for covertly embedding
non-reportable cryptographic data within the cortico-
striatal memory system in the human brain.
2.1 The SISL Task and Applet
The execution of the Serial Interception Sequence Learn-
ing (SISL) task is central to the authentication system
that we have developed. Here we introduce the SISL task
in the context of the human memory system in order to
provide background for describing our design and prac-
tical experiments.
Originally introduced in [17], SISL is a task in
which human participants develop sensitivity to struc-
tured information without being aware of what they have
learned. The task requires participants to intercept mov-
ing objects (circles) delivered in a pre-determined se-
quence, much like this is done in the popular game “Gui-
tar Hero”. Initially each object appears at the top of one
of four different columns, and falls vertically at a con-
stant speed until it reaches the “sink” at the bottom, at
which point it disappears. The goal for the player is to
intercept every object as it nears the sink. Interception
is performed by pressing the key that corresponds to the
object’s column when the object is in the correct verti-
cal position. Pressing the wrong key or not pressing any
key results in an incorrect outcome for that object.
In
a typical training session of 30-60 minutes, participants
complete several thousand trials and the order of the cues
follows a covertly embedded repeating sequence on 80%
of trials. The game is designed to keep each user at (but
not beyond) the limit of his or her abilities by gradually
varying the speed of the falling circles to achieve a hit
rate of about 70%. Knowledge of the embedded repeat-
ing sequence is assessed by comparing the performance
rate (percent correct) during times when the cues follow
the trained sequence to that during periods when the cues
follow an untrained sequence.
All of the sequences presented to the user are de-
signed to prevent conspicuous, easy to remember pat-
terns from emerging. Speciﬁcally, training as well as
random sequences are designed to contain every ordered
pair of characters exactly once with no character appear-
ing twice in a row, and thus the sequence length must
be 4× 3 = 12 when four columns (characters) are used.
The result is that while the trained sequence is performed
better than an untrained sequence, the participant usually
does not consciously recognize the trained sequence. In
order to conﬁrm this in experimental work, after SISL
participants are typically asked to complete tests of ex-
plicit recognition in which they specify how familiar var-
ious sequences look to them.
Figure 1: Screenshot of the SISL task in progress.
For the current application, we extended the traditional
deﬁnition of the SISL task in order to accommodate its
use as an authentication mechanism. First, we increased
the number of columns to six, which increases the poten-
tial complexity of the trained sequence. Using the same
constraints on sequence order as the 4-column version of
the task, the training sequences are 30 items long. As a
result, the number of possible sequences that can be used
3
as a secret key is increased exponentially from only 256
to nearly 248 billion, as explained in the next section.
Second, we added an empty column in the middle of the
layout (Figure 1). In early experimental testing we found
out that the empty column facilitates the visual percep-
tion of the falling objects and helps the user to “map”
them to the correct hand, especially for objects in the
middle columns which are otherwise easily confused at
high speed.
The SISL task is delivered to users as a Flash appli-
cation via a web browser. Participants navigate to our
web site, www.brainauth.com, and are presented with a
consent form. Once they agree to participate, the ap-
plet downloads a random training sequence and starts the
game. Upon completion of the training and test trials, the
explicit recognition test is administered, and results are
uploaded to the server. Once we describe our authenti-
cation system, we will return to describe how the SISL
applet functions in the bigger scheme of our experiments
with multiple users.
