which can be sent over the channels in C per unit time. Recall
that for each source symbol, the protocol chooses an M ⊆ C
and transmits one share on each channel in M. Channel i can
be an element of this M at most ri times over one unit time,
so the protocol must choose its channels strategically if it is
to achieve the maximum rate.

channel i using an optimal scheduling strategy. One way to

since μ is the average ratio of shares to source symbols. There
(cid:5)
are two constraints governing the values of r
i. First, the number
of shares sent on each channel obviously cannot exceed the rate
ri of that channel. Second, since the protocol is not permitted
to send more than one share of any given source symbol on any
given channel, the number of shares which can be transmitted
on any channel is at most RC. So the number of shares to send
on each channel is constrained by the following inequalities:

Theorem 1. The achievable multichannel rate is at least that
of the channel with the (cid:8)μ(cid:9)th-highest individual rate.
Proof. Let S be a set of channels with the (cid:8)μ(cid:9) highest rates,
i.e., S ⊆ C with |S| = (cid:8)μ(cid:9) and

One implication of these constraints is that the channels
cannot always be fully utilized if they have different rates. If
we are interested in full utilization, we can determine the range
of choices for μ which will allow it for a given set of channels.
Theorem 2. Full utilization of every channel is possible if and
only if the average share multiplicity is at most the ratio of
total available rate to that of the fastest channel.

Proof. If all ri are equal, then(cid:8)

and μ ≤ n in any valid set of parameters.
It will be useful in later theorems to deﬁne a set to distinguish
between those channels which are fully utilized and those which
are limited by Equation 3.
Deﬁnition 1. The fully-utilized set is the set
A = {i ∈ C : ri ≤ RC}
377
of all channels with rates which can be fully utilized under
given protocol parameters.
Corollary 2. The size of the fully-utilized set is greater than
n − μ.
Proof. Since by Theorem 1, RC is at least the rate of the
(cid:8)μ(cid:9)th fastest channel,
|A| ≥ n − (cid:8)μ(cid:9) + 1.
Equivalently, since |A| and n are integers,

ity μ and the optimal multichannel rate is
|A| > n − μ.

Proof. We wish to ﬁnd the maximum RC for which the
previously mentioned three constraints are satisﬁable. From
Equation 1 we note that RC is proportional to the sum of

possible. Given the two inequalities, we can say that this is
the case when

To eliminate r

This is, on its own, a useful result. If we have a target
multichannel rate and wish to balance this with other properties,
we can use this formula to ﬁnd the highest value of μ for which
the overall rate is at least the target. However, we also wish to
derive an expression for the reverse: the rate achievable for a
speciﬁed μ. To set this up, we will use the set A to differentiate
between the two cases in the min-expression.

and channel rates ri is given by

The set A needs to be eliminated, as it is deﬁned in terms
of RC. This can be accomplished by recognizing that A is
the unique set of more than n − μ channels which minimizes
the expression. In other words, we will show that, for any set

D. Optimal Privacy, Loss, and Delay at Optimal Rate
Optimizing strictly for privacy, loss, or delay, even with a
pre-selected κ and μ, will usually force the protocol to transmit
at a rate signiﬁcantly lower than RC. The linear program from
Section IV-B often ﬁnds a single (k, M ) which yields the
best value and transmits using only those parameters until
it has exhausted the rate of the slowest channel in M. Any
channels not in this “best” M are left completely unused. This
is typically not desirable behavior.
It would be more useful to know, for given parameters κ
and μ, how to compute and achieve the best privacy, loss, or
delay while maintaining maximum rate. This would ensure
that the protocol is making full use of the available network
resources, while still judiciously choosing its share schedule
to optimize whatever property is deemed important. We can
modify the earlier linear program to suit this purpose, but we
will need a way to express the maximum-rate constraint as an
equation linear in the values of p. Recall from Equation 4 that
overall rate is maximized when the number of source symbols
for which channel i carries a share is the lesser of its rate and
378
the overall rate. To convert this to an expression using p, we
note that the proportion of symbols using channel i is

This constraint ensures that the share schedule p can achieve
the maximum rate RC. Since Theorem 4 allows us to calculate
RC, we may use it as a constant in the new linear program:
