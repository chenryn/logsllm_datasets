While working with Flutter, I encountered a situation where I needed to access a Flutter plugin from my native code. Specifically, I set some `SharedPreferences` using Flutter and wanted to access these preferences from Java.

To achieve this, I examined the plugin's source code to determine the `SharedPreferences` name and how the plugin stores its keys. This approach worked as expected, but I'm curious if there is a more straightforward method to accomplish this. 

Is there an easier way to access `SharedPreferences` set by a Flutter plugin from native Java code?
