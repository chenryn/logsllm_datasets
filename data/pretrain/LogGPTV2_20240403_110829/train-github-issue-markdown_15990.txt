while i was working with flutter i came across a situation that i want to
access flutter plugin from my native code  
example
> i set SharedPreferences using flutter code and i want to access this  
>  prefs from java
i achieved that by reading plugin source code and get SharedPreferences name
and how the plugin store keys and every thing worked as expected , but i
wonder if there easier way that i can use ?
