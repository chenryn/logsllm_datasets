User: Hi im running a subprocess with threads trough a python wrapper and I get the following warning when I use the subprocess module.
"The _posixsubprocess module is not being used,  Child process reliability may suffer if your program uses threads."
What dose this mean?
How can I get rid of it?
Assistant: check if you can import _posixsubprocess manually, subprocess tries to import this in it's code, if it produces an exception this warning is produced.
