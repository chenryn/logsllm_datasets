User: I want to run a python script without Abaqus GUI and this already works well with the command:
abaqus cae nogui = scriptname.py
As I want to include a subroutine I have to run it in Abaqus version 12-1 but I have also version 13-1 installed (running the script in cae, I always got an error while using 13-1 but not with 12-1).
With the command above I don't know which version will be used. Is there a way to specify the used version in the cmd?
Assistant: on windows using abaqus cae will call the most recent version of abaqus installed. If you want to run on a specific version use this call instead abq6121 cae nogui = scriptname.py
