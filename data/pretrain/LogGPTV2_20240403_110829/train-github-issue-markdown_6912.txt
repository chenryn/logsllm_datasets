I have a few filters on my dashboard, and the dashboard data does not load until I click the **Filter** button in the sidebar. One of the filters has the **Select the first value** option checked. When I uncheck this option, the data loads without any issues. However, I need to keep the **Select the first value** option enabled.

Is there a way to fix this issue while still having the **Select the first value** option checked?
