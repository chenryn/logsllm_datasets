### The problem
Although they are not commonly used, SecurityBundle provides some useful
functions called `logout_path()` and `logout_url()` (see reference).
In regular Symfony applications I don't use them because I always know exactly
the URL or the route name associated with the logout action. However, when
developing some code that can be integrated in any Symfony application I can
no longer know the logout URL and I must use `logout_*()` functions.
The problem is that these functions, obviously, require the name of the user
provider to generate the URL. But again, I cannot know the name of the user
provider for the Symfony application which is going to use this software.
### The solution
The current solution seems verbose and a bit weird to me:
    Close session
What do you think about making this argument optional? If you set it, the URL
is generated for that provider. If you don't set the argument, the function
automatically selects the right provider for the current user:
    Close session
