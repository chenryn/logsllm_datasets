### Graphical Password Schemes and Their Security Implications

#### Introduction to Graphical Passwords
Graphical password schemes are a form of authentication that uses images or graphical elements instead of traditional text-based passwords. One such scheme, DAS (Draw-A-Secret) [19], requires users to draw a password on a background grid. Cued schemes, on the other hand, provide users with a visual cue to base their password on. For example, a click-based password using a single background image is a cued graphical password where the user's password is a sequence of clicks on the image.

Blonder [4] originally proposed the idea of a graphical password with a click-based scheme, where the password consists of one or more clicks on predefined image regions. In the Picture Password variation by Jansen et al. [18], the entire image is overlaid with a visible grid, and the user must click on the same grid squares each time they log in. Birget et al. [3] allow clicking anywhere on an image without a visible grid, using "robust discretization" to tolerate errors. Wiedenbeck et al. [45, 46, 47] implemented this method as PassPoints and studied its usability, including memorability, general perception, error rates, the effect of allowed error tolerance, the impact of image choice, and login and creation times. They found that PassPoints' usability was comparable to text passwords, except for longer login times. The implementation also showed acceptable success rates, accuracy, and entry times [6].

#### User Choice Patterns
Davis et al. [8] explored user choice patterns in variations of Passfaces and Story, two recognition-based schemes that involve selecting an image from a panel of many different images. Their study revealed strong patterns, such as a preference for images of attractive people and those of the same racial background. These findings motivated the current work, although the results do not directly extend to click-based schemes that select unrestricted areas from a single background image. Thorpe et al. [41, 42] discussed likely patterns in user choice for DAS, such as mirror symmetry and small stroke count, which were later corroborated by Tao's user study [40]. While these results do not directly apply to the present work, they highlight the importance of understanding attack dictionaries.

#### Generative Attacks on Behavioral Biometrics
Lopresti et al. [24] introduced the concept of generative attacks on behavioral biometrics. Ballard et al. [1] successfully applied a generative handwriting-recognition attack based on population statistics of handwriting collected from a random sample of 15 users with the same writing style. In what is arguably the most realistic study of threats to behavioral biometrics, they found that generative attacks were more effective than those by skilled and motivated forgers [1]. The most successful attack in Section 4.2 of this paper can also be viewed as generative; it uses click-points harvested from a small population of users, performs additional processing (clustering), and recombines subsets of them as guesses. This approach differs in its application (click-based graphical passwords) and the required processing to generate a login attempt.

### Discussion and Concluding Remarks

Our results demonstrate that harvesting data from a small number of human users allows for quite effective offline guessing attacks against click-based graphical passwords. This makes individual users vulnerable to targeted (spear) attacks, as an attacker could easily gather a small set of human-generated data for a specific image. For instance, an attacker could collect points by protecting an attractive web service or contest site with a graphical password, or by paying a small group of people or using friends. This partially defeats the hope of improving security through a customized image.

We found that our human-seeded attack strategy was quite successful, guessing 36% of passwords with a 31-bit dictionary in one instance and 20% of passwords with a 33-bit dictionary in another. Preliminary work shows that click-order patterns can further reduce the size of these dictionaries while maintaining similar success rates. The success of our human-seeded attack dictionaries appears to be related to the amount of hot-spotting on an image. Our studies update previous assumptions that half of all click-regions on an image will be chosen by users. After collecting 570 and 545 points, we observed only 111 and 133 click-regions (for pool and cars, respectively). Thus, one quarter to one third of all click-regions is a more reasonable estimate, even for highly detailed images, and the relative probabilities of these regions should be expected to vary considerably.

Our purely automated attack, using a combination of image processing measures, already gives cause for concern. For images on which Itti et al.'s [17] visual attention model worked well, our model appeared to do a reasonable job of predicting user choice. For example, an automatically-generated 28-bit dictionary from our tools guessed 8 out of 37 (22%) observed passwords for the icons image and 6 out of 35 (17%) for the Philadelphia image. Our tools guessed 9.1% of passwords for the cars image in both the short-term lab and long-term field studies. Improvements to pursue include adding object centroids to the bitmask used in creating the cornered saliency map.

Our attack strategies could also be used defensively as part of proactive password checking [38, 7, 2]. An interesting avenue for future work would be to determine whether graphical password users create other predictable patterns when their choices are disallowed by proactive checking. Additionally, the visual attention model may be used proactively to determine background images to avoid, as those images on which the visual attention model performed well (e.g., identifying some areas as much more interesting than others) appear more vulnerable to purely automated attacks.

An important remaining question is whether altering parameters (e.g., pixel sizes of images, tolerance settings, number of click-points) in an attempt to improve security can result in a system with acceptable security and usability simultaneously. Any proposal with significantly varied parameters would require new user studies exploring hot-spotting and usability.

Overall, the degree of hot-spotting confirmed by our studies, and the successes of the various attack strategies, call into question the viability of click-based schemes like PassPoints in environments where offline attacks are possible. In such environments, a 43-bit full password space is clearly insufficient, so one would assume some level of password stretching (e.g., [15, 34]) would be implemented to increase the difficulty of attack. Regardless of these implementation details, click-based graphical password schemes may still be a suitable alternative for systems where offline attacks are not possible, e.g., systems currently using PIN numbers.
