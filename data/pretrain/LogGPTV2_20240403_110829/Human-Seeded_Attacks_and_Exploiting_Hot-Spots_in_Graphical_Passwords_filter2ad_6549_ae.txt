password; e.g., DAS (Draw-A-Secret) [19] asks users to
draw a password on a background grid. Cued schemes
show the user something that they can base their graphi-
cal password upon. A click-based password using a sin-
gle background image is an example of a cued graphical
password scheme where the user password is a sequence
of clicks on a background image. Blonder [4] originally
proposed the idea of a graphical password with a click-
based scheme where the password is one or more clicks
on predeﬁned image regions.
In the Picture Password
variation by Jansen et al. [18], the entire image is over-
layed by a visible grid; the user must click on the same
grid squares on each login.
Birget et al. [3] allow clicking anywhere on an image
with no visible grid, tolerating error through “robust dis-
cretization”. Wiedenbeck et al. [45, 46, 47] implement
this method as PassPoints, and study its usability includ-
ing: memorability, general perception, error rates, the ef-
fect of allowed error tolerance, the effect of image choice
on usability, and login and creation times. They report
the usability of PassPoints to be comparable to text pass-
words in most respects; the notable exception is a longer
time for successful login. The implementation we study
herein is also reported to have acceptable success rates,
accuracy, and entry times [6].
Regarding explorations of the effect of user choice,
Davis et al. [8] examine this in a variation of Passfaces
and Story (see above), two recognition-based schemes
which essentially involve choosing an image from one or
more panels of many different images. Their user study
found very strong patterns in user choice, e.g., the ten-
dency to select images of attractive people, and those
of the same racial background. The high-level idea of
ﬁnding and exploiting patterns in user choice also mo-
tivated our current work, although these earlier results
do not appear directly extendable to (cued recall) click-
based schemes that select unrestricted areas from a sin-
gle background image. Thorpe et al. [41, 42] discussed
likely patterns in user choice for DAS (mirror symme-
try and small stroke count), later corroborated through
Tao’s user study [40]. These results also do not appear to
directly extend to our present work, aside from the com-
mon general idea of attack dictionaries.
Lopresti et al. [24] introduce the concept of generative
attacks to behavioral biometrics. Ballard et al. [1] gen-
erate and successfully apply a generative handwriting-
recognition attack based on population statistics of hand-
writing, collected from a random sample of 15 users with
the same writing style.
In arguably the most realistic
study to date of the threats faced by behavioral biomet-
rics, they found their generative attacks to be more ef-
fective than attacks by skilled and motivated forgers [1].
Our most successful attack from Section 4.2 may also
be viewed as generative in nature; it uses click-points
harvested from a small population of users from another
context (the lab study), performs some additional pro-
cessing (clustering), and recombines subsets of them as
guesses. Our work differs in its application (click-based
graphical passwords), and in the required processing to
generate a login attempt.
7 Discussion and Concluding Remarks
Our results demonstrate that harvesting data from a
small number of human users allows quite effective of-
ﬂine guessing attacks against click-based graphical pass-
words. This makes individual users vulnerable to tar-
geted (spear) attacks, as one should assume that an at-
tacker could ﬁnd out the background image associated
with a target victim, and easily gather a small set of
human-generated data for that image by any number of

means. For instance, an attacker could collect points by
protecting an attractive web service or contest site with
a graphical password. Alternatively, an attacker could
pay a small group of people or use friends. This at least
partially defeats the hope to improve one’s security in a
click-based scheme through a customized image.
We found that our human-seeded attack strategy was
quite successful, guessing 36% of passwords with a 31-
bit dictionary in one instance, and 20% of passwords
with a 33-bit dictionary in another. Preliminary work
shows that click-order patterns can be used to further
reduce the size of these dictionaries, while maintaining
similar success rates. The success of our human-seeded
attack dictionaries appears to be related to the amount of
hot-spotting on an image. The prevalence and impact of
hot-spots contrasts earlier views which underplayed their
potential impact, and suggestions [47] that any highly
detailed image may be a good candidate. Our studies
allow us to update previous assumptions that half of all
click-regions on an image will be chosen by users. Af-
ter collecting 570 and 545 points, we only observed 111
and 133 click-regions (for pool and cars respectively);
thus, one quarter to one third of all click-regions would
be a more reasonable estimate even from highly detailed
images, and the relative probabilities of these regions
should be expected to vary quite considerably.
Our purely automated attack using a combination of
image processing measures (which likely can be consid-
erably improved) already gives cause for concern. For
images on which Itti et al.’s [17] visual attention model
worked well, our model appeared to do a reasonable job
of predicting user choice. For example, an automatically-
generated 28-bit dictionary from our tools guessed 8 out
of 37 (22%) observed passwords for the icons image, and
6 out of 35 (17%) for the philadelphia image. Our tools
guessed 9.1% of passwords for the cars image in both
the short-term lab and long-term ﬁeld studies. Improve-
ments to pursue include adding object centroids to the
bitmask used in creating the cornered saliency map.
Our attack strategies (naturally) could be used defen-
sively, as part of proactive password checking [38, 7, 2].
Thus, an interesting avenue for future work would be to
determine whether graphical password users create other
predictable patterns when their choices are disallowed
by proactive checking. Additionally, the visual attention
model may be used proactively to determine background
images to avoid, as those images on which the visual at-
tention model performed well (e.g., identiﬁes some areas
as much more interesting than others) appear more vul-
nerable to the purely automated attacks from Section 5.
An interesting remaining question is whether altering
parameters (e.g., pixel sizes of images, tolerance settings,
number of click-points) in an attempt to improve security
can result in a system with acceptable security and us-
ability simultaneously. Any proposal with signiﬁcantly
varied parameters would require new user studies explor-
ing hot-spotting and usability.
Overall, the degree of hot-spotting conﬁrmed by our
studies, and the successes of the various attack strate-
gies herein, call into question the viability of click-based
schemes like PassPoints in environments where off-line
attacks are possible.
Indeed in such environments, a
43-bit full password space is clearly insufﬁcient to start
with, so one would assume some tolerable level of pass-
word stretching (e.g., [15, 34]) would be implemented
to increase the difﬁculty of attack. Regardless of these
implementation details, click-based graphical password
schemes may still be a suitable alternative for systems
where ofﬂine attacks are not possible, e.g., systems cur-
rently using PIN numbers.
