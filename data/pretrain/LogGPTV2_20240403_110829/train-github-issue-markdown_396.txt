**Migrated issue, originally created by Anonymous**
Versions of Firebird prior to 2.0 were subject to the following bug
http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/CORE-356
The gist of CORE-356 is that values in the RDB$DEFAULT_SOURCE column of the
RDB$RELATION_FIELDS table can have leading whitespace.
Trying to use meta.reflect on one of these tables results in errors like this:
    File ".../site-packages/sqlalchemy/databases/firebird.py", line 501, in reflecttable
        assert row['fdefault']('fdefault').upper().startswith('DEFAULT '), row
    AssertionError: (u'ARCHIVED           ', None, u'TEXT', 0, 1, None, 0, " DEFAULT 'N'")
A simple fix for this is to add a TRIM to the tblqry around the COALESCE or
since the fdefault value is being modified with .upper anyway line 501 might
be a better spot to "fix" this
    assert row['fdefault']('fdefault').upper().lstrip().startswith('DEFAULT '), row
