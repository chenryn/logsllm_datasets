**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Search Victim-Owned Websites

Adversaries may search websites owned by the victim to gather information that can be used for targeting. These websites often contain a wealth of details, such as:

- **Department and Division Names:** Information about the structure and organization of the victim's company.
- **Physical Locations:** Addresses and locations of offices, facilities, and other key sites.
- **Key Employee Data:** Names, roles, and contact information (e.g., email addresses) of important personnel.

This information can provide adversaries with valuable insights into the victim's organizational structure, key personnel, and operational practices, which can be leveraged for further attacks or social engineering efforts.
