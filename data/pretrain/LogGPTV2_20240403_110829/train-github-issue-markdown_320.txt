If not I would like to request this feature.
Given the fact that npm modules have been hacked before and that I/we will use
modules from the registry it would be nice if we could reduce the threat of
these modules and only give permissions to each module if necessary.
If this is possible I would suggest a new parameter like --block-external
which would deny all given permissions from cached/external modules and than
each permission could be extended by a list that would come after it.
I don't really know if this is feasible.  
Btw good job on Deno! Its pretty cool so far.
