User: 你作为资深数据库管理员，帮助解答一些数据库故障诊断问题。请描述 abnormal_plan_time 如何作为数据库性能问题的根因排查
Assistant: This function checks for abnormal execution plan generation in slow SQL instances. It calculates the ratio of plan time to execution time and compares it to the plan time rate threshold. If the ratio is greater than or equal to the threshold and the number of hard parses is greater than the number of soft parses, it indicates abnormal plan time. This could be due to the lack of support for PBE in the business. The function suggests modifying the business to support PBE. If the condition is met, it is a root cause of the issue. If not, it is not a root cause.

辅助排查的数据来自以下prometheus性能监控指标：- n_soft_parse
- n_hard_parse
- plan_time
- exc_time
