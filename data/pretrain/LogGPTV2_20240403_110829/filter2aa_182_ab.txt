UCSniff 2.1 GARP Research
Credit:  Harsh Kupwade
We researched the way different IP Phones respond to Gratuitous 
ARP via the traditional method of unicast ARP reply packets.   
Successful ARP Poisoning is the basis for the MitM condition.
Cisco 7985 Video Phones can’t be ARP Poisoned unless running 
UCSniff for 10 minutes.  We found a new way:  spoofed unicast
ARP requests allow immediate ARP Poisoning.  100% effective.
Avaya IP Phones will not respond to unicast Gratuitous ARP Reply 
packets (traditional method).  Unicast ARP requests are 100% 
effective, immediately.
Cisco Unified IP Phones have a “GARP Disabled” security feature.  
We didn’t address this until UCSniff 3.0.  We can now bypass it.

UCSniff 3.0 GARP Disabled
What is “GARP Disabled”?  
• A feature in Cisco Unified IP Phones.  
• GARP Disabled is default for all new CUCM installations 
• GARP Disabled means that the IP Phone doesn’t populate its ARP 
cache when an attacker sends spoofed, Unicast ARP Reply 
packets.

UCSniff 3.0 GARP Disabled
No successful ARP Poisoning = no MitM condition
With GARP Disabled, we can’t ARP Poison the connection from IP 
Phone 
 Network.  We can, however, ARP Poison the connection 
from Network 
 Phone.
At best, we can only receive ingress RTP media stream from 
network inbound to IP Phone.

UCSniff 3.0 GARP Disabled
GARP Disabled is a “Security feature” that is advertised in Cisco 
best practices, which can defeat a casual attacker to run MitM.
Observations on the way Cisco Unified IP Phones behave with 
ARP requests when “GARP Disabled” is in effect
• When IP Phone boots, sends ARP request to communicate to 
remote IP gateway, for the traffic communicated to CUCM
• Doesn’t send ARP request for remote RTP peer until it receives 
SCCP StartMediaTransmission message
Winning the “Race Condition”
• It is difficult to Poison the ARP request that the phone sends as it 
boots up, for the IP gateway (to send traffic to remote server)
• However, during an active call setup, we can predict when the IP 
Phone will ARP for its remote RTP peer.

UCSniff 3.0 GARP Disabled
UCSniff 3.0 has a new feature, GARP Disablement Bypass:
• ucsniff –i eth0 --garpdb // //
The way it works:
1.
When a call is starting, UCSniff intercepts the ‘StartMediaTransmission’ message 
sent from UCM  IP Phone (since we are MitM from network  IP Phone)
2.
UCSniff learns the IP address of both RTP peers.  This is how the IP Phone knows 
who to talk to on the remote end.
3.
UCSniff builds a spoofed unicast ARP reply packet, if the phone is on our source 
VLAN
4.
We flood the IP Phone with spoofed unicast ARP reply packet
5.
Cisco Unified IP Phone sends an ARP request for valid remote RTP peer
6.
Cisco IP Phone receives spoofed unicast reply packet from UCSniff before it 
receives the legitimate reply from the valid IP Phone
7.
Flooding continues for a threshold of microseconds after legitimate reply
8.
The IP phone populates its ARP entry with the spoofed entry
9.
UCSniff wins the race condition, ARP Poisoning the IP Phone

UCSniff 3.0 GARP Disabled
Impact of this
• If both IP Phones are in the same VLAN as attacker, we can 
successfully ARP Poison both IP Phones, and receive bi-directional 
RTP media
• If IP Phone is communicating to an RTP peer in remote network, we 
can still only receive RTP media stream from remote peer inbound 
to IP Phone

UCSniff 3.0 GUI
We used JUCE Libraries to create UCSniff GUI
• Website:  http://www.rawmaterialsoftware.com
• “JUCE (Jules' Utility Class Extensions) is an all-encompassing C++ 
class library for developing cross-platform applications”
• “It's particularly good for creating highly-specialised user interfaces 
and for handling graphics and sound.”
Many props and thanks to Julian Storer
We wanted nice bells, dials, and whistles for video eavesdropping
Very easy to create GUI application using the JUCER & Demo App
We wanted a cross-platform C/C++ application so that UCSniff GUI 
can look the same way in Mac, Linux, and Windows.

Finding a valid H.264 RTP stream
• Easy to find an H.264 RTP stream, if we can intercept the signaling 
(SIP/Skinny/RTSP/SDP) that negotiates the RTP port and other 
codec parameters.
• Signaling and session negotiation takes place only once and it does 
not happen very frequently.
• Particularly, in case of IP video surveillance,  media could be 
streamed to the monitoring end point for days without any signaling. 
• We came up with a module to intelligently detect an RTP stream 
based on the:
- IP and UDP parameters
- RTP Version
- Payload Type
- SSRC
- Monotonically increasing sequence number and timestamp

H.264 payload format and fragmentation
•
Four types of H.264 RTP payload formats. (Single NALU, FU, STAP, MTAP)
•
If the H.264 payload size exceeds the MTU, the payload gets fragmented at the 
H.264 level . These H.264 format are called FU-A or FU-B.
•
Some H.264 clients like Cisco 7985 don’t handle FU-A or FU-B H.264 payload 
formats.
•
For Cisco 7985 phones, VideoJak automatically converts FU type payload to Single 
NALU payload type and fragments them at the IP level.

•
