**ATT&CK ID:** T1055.013  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Process Doppelgänging

Adversaries may use process doppelgänging to inject malicious code into the address space of a legitimate, running process. This technique allows them to evade process-based defenses and potentially elevate their privileges. Process doppelgänging involves executing arbitrary code within the context of a separate, live process, thereby making it difficult for security solutions to detect and mitigate the malicious activity.
