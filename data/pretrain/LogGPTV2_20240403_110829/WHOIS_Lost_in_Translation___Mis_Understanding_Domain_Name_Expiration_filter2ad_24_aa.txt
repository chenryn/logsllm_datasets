ABSTRACT
Internet domain names expire when not renewed and
may be claimed by a new owner. To date, despite exist-
ing work on abuses of residual trust after domain own-
ership changes, it is not well understood how often and
how fast re-registrations occur, and the underlying pro-
cesses are often over-simpliﬁed in scientiﬁc literature,
leading to a potential bias in those studies. While in
principle registration data is available in Whois data-
bases, scalability issues and data ambiguities make re-
registrations a challenging subject of study in practice.
By focusing on domains about to be deleted, we were
able to track 7.4 M com, net, org, biz and name domains
over up to ten months to gather data for a survival ana-
lysis of re-registrations. Our results show that expira-
tion processes may vary, and that many re-registrations
happen soon after deletion, especially for older domains.
We also discuss intricacies of Whois data to aid in
avoiding potential pitfalls, as fast domain ownership
changes combined with hidden domain states may pose
challenges to operational and research communities.

INTRODUCTION
Internet domain names are typically assigned on a
ﬁrst-come, ﬁrst-served basis. Registrations are valid for
a limited time period and must be renewed regularly
in order to remain active. When an owner fails to do
so, they can still rescue their domain during a short
redemption period, but ultimately it will be deleted and
can be re-registered by any interested party.

In this paper, we aim to quantify the phenomenon of
Internet domain expiration and re-registration. While
it is known that re-registrations are sometimes done for
malicious purposes [8, 13, 15, 17], in general it is not well
understood what fraction of expired domains is even-
tually re-registered, and what the temporal aspects of
re-registrations look like. Furthermore, the expiration
process of domains is often over-simpliﬁed in the literat-
ure; registrars have a considerable degree of freedom for
their implementations. We aim to shed light on how the
process varies in practice, and how it could potentially
bias studies that do not account for these subtleties.
An important challenge to answering these questions
is that historical domain registration data is diﬃcult
to obtain in a scalable way.
Information about cur-
rently registered domains is publicly available through
the Whois protocol, but there is no complete archive of
prior registrations. Furthermore, as researchers previ-
ously pointed out [16], Whois is designed for occasional
manual use rather than bulk access. The data format
of the text-based protocol can be inconsistent, and rate
limits restrict the number of possible lookups. Even
worse, we show in this paper that there are various am-
biguities in Whois data that can make it quite complex
to correctly infer the state of a domain.
We built a system that discovers domains about to
be deleted in DNS zone ﬁles and tracks their Whois re-
cords through the various states of expiration and po-
tentially re-registration. Overall, we track 7.4 M com,
net, org, biz and name domains from August 2015 to
June 2016. We carefully ﬁlter the collected data to
account for various Whois intricacies and perform a
survival analysis of 6.5 M expired domains with about
16.5 % observed re-registrations.
Our ﬁndings show higher rates of re-registration for
larger zones and older domains; for instance, around
20 % of expired com domains are re-registered within
300 days. Furthermore, there appears to be signiﬁcant
competition over re-registrations since many of them oc-
cur in spikes around the earliest availability. The latter

date does not follow the same pattern for all domains,
which contradicts the common misconception of a ﬁxed
deletion delay. On a diﬀerent level, our results also in-
clude several lessons about working with Whois data
that we learned the hard way. Fast domain ownership
changes combined with the diﬃculty of distinguishing
the Whois records of a recently renewed domain from
one that is about to be deleted, for instance, are po-
tential pitfalls when identifying origins of malicious be-
haviour or surveying the domain ecosystem. We hope
that this work will raise awareness for these issues.
2. BACKGROUND & RELATED WORK
Names in the Domain Name System (DNS) are struc-
tured hierarchically. Top-level domains (TLDs) such as
com or net are created by the Internet Corporation for
Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and then del-
egated for day-to-day operation to a registry such as
Verisign. Each registry maintains a directory of the
registered second-level names and their authoritative
name servers, called a DNS zone. Registries delegate
billing and customer support to ICANN-accredited re-
gistrars, companies such as GoDaddy or Gandi, which
sell domain names to registrants or domain owners.
Domain Lifecycle: Domains are registered for a
period of one or more years.
If a domain is not re-
newed before its expiration date, it goes through a series
of phases that permit late renewals before the domain
is ultimately deleted. Registrars manage the state of
the domains they sponsor by connecting to the regis-
tries’ systems using the Extensible Provisioning Pro-
tocol (EPP) [7]. Figure 1 shows a subset of possible
domain states [3], and how EPP commands cause trans-
itions between them [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]. The most common
case for domain expiration, and typically the only case
mentioned in related work, is a 45-day auto-renew grace
period followed by a 30-day redemption period and a 5-
day pending delete state [13, 15] – a total of 80 days
between the expiration date and the earliest opportun-
ity for re-registration. The corresponding path in the
ﬁgure is highlighted with bold arrows. In practice, how-
ever, registrars have a considerable degree of freedom
when implementing this state machine.
In fact, a domain enters the auto-renew state only if
it is not renewed or deleted by the registrar before its
expiration date. The registry automatically renews do-
mains past their expiration date for one year and grants
the registrar up to 45 days to cancel the renewal without
becoming liable for the renewal fee. During this time,
at the discretion of the registrar, the domain may still
be active in the DNS zone and continue to resolve.
When a domain is marked for deletion by the regis-
trar, it is deactivated in the zone and stops resolving.
The redemption period gives the registrant a ﬁnal 30 day
chance to restore the domain. If not restored, the do-
main is moved into pending delete, and after 5 days, it
can be re-registered on a ﬁrst-come, ﬁrst-served basis.
The Whois Protocol: Registries maintain data-
bases of registration information for currently registered
domains, including creation and expiration dates, the
ID of the respective registrar, and currently active EPP
status code ﬂags [3]. These databases are accessible to
the public via the Whois protocol, e.g. to look up the
owner of a domain or check availability for registration.
Whois servers are optimised for manual investigations;
they allow lookups of one domain at a time, are heavily
rate limited, and contain data about only the current
registration in a semi-structured, textual format that is
not always consistent [16]. While commercial archives of
Whois data do exist, the available granularity of data
can vary from domain to domain, and the companies do
not disclose when and how they collect the data, which
all makes these archives ill suited for a systematic study
of domain expiration and re-registration.
Related Work: Prior research in the area of domain
registrations includes the work on registration intent by
Halvorson et al. [10, 11, 12], and a study of registration
abuses such as domain tasting [9]. Schlamp et al. [17]
describe an attack to take over protected resources by
re-registering the expired domains of email addresses.
Attackers have also been reported to re-register expired
domains that built up a good reputation [8, 13, 15].

Two works present a more systematic examination of
domain re-registrations: Hao et al. [13] investigate char-
acteristic registration patterns of spam domains and
ﬁnd that among re-registered domains, those later used
for spamming tend to be registered faster than non-
malicious domains. Lever et al. [15] analyse the ma-
liciousness of domains before and after re-registration
with a focus on when malicious behaviour occurs, not
when or why a domain is re-registered.
Liu et al. [16] propose a machine learning approach
to parse the responses of registrar-level Whois servers,
which do not have a standardised format. Our work is
orthogonal in the sense that we describe how certain do-
main states may not be visible in a single observation.
3. METHODOLOGY
To measure the re-registration behaviour of domains,
we need to know which domains are about to expire,
and we need to track how they progress through the ex-
piration states, are deleted, and possibly re-registered.
3.1 Expiring Domain Discovery
It is important to ﬁnd domain expiration candidates
early so that we can extract their original creation and
expiration dates before they are deleted. Since some
DNS zones are very large, it is ineﬃcient to discover
domains approaching their expiration date through ex-
haustive crawling of Whois records; e.g., it took Liu et
al. multiple months to crawl the com zone [16].
As a more targeted approach, and similar to prior
work [15], we consider as expiration candidates the do-
mains removed from the DNS zone. Under their ICANN
agreements, registries grant researchers access to daily
snapshots of their DNS zone ﬁles, that is, the data used
to run the zone’s name servers—a list of all second-
level domain names that have at least one authoritat-
ive name server conﬁgured. We download these zone
ﬁles daily from the registries of com, net, org, biz and
name; Table 1 shows the median of the overall zone size
as well as the entries added and removed relative to the
