# Chapter 9: Post-Exploitation

## Introduction
After successfully exploiting the target and gaining access, we enter the post-exploitation phase. This is the final stage of our penetration testing process, where we aim to further exploit the target, escalate privileges, and penetrate the internal network more deeply. Meterpreter, a powerful tool in Metasploit, simplifies this process with its built-in Ruby scripts and extensibility.

### Goals of This Chapter
- Gaining situational awareness on Windows/Linux after compromising the target.
- Using Meterpreter scripts for reconnaissance.
- Employing various methods to escalate privileges.
- Maintaining access.
- Penetrating the internal network further.

## Acquiring Situational Awareness
Immediately after compromising a host, it is crucial to gather information about the host's location within the internal network, its functionality, and the services it is running. Familiarity with the operating system will aid in enumeration.

### Enumerating a Windows Machine
Windows is a common target due to its widespread use in corporate environments. Assuming we have compromised a Windows host using an exploit like `ms08_067_netapi` and opened a Meterpreter session, here are some commands to gain situational awareness:

- **IP Configuration:**
  - `ipconfig`: Lists all interfaces, IP addresses, gateways, and MAC addresses.
  - `ipconfig /all`: Provides additional information such as DNS servers.
  - `ipconfig /displaydns`: Displays the DNS cache.

- **ARP Cache:**
  - `arp -a`: Shows the ARP cache, helping identify reachable systems.

- **Network Connections:**
  - `netstat -ano`: Lists all connections established from the current computer on specific ports.

- **Routing Table:**
  - `route print` or `netstat -r`: Displays the routing table.

- **Service Enumeration:**
  - `tasklist /svc`: Lists all services running on the target computer.
  - `net start` and `net stop`: Display and control running services.
  - `netsh firewall set opmode disable`: Disables the firewall (requires administrative privileges).

- **User and Group Enumeration:**
  - `net user`: Lists local users.
  - `net localgroup`: Lists local groups.
  - `net user \domain`: Lists users in a domain.
  - `net user \domain`: Lists all users in a particular domain.

### Enumerating a Linux Machine
Linux hosts are less common but still important. Here are some commands for enumerating a Linux-based host:

- **Interface Information:**
  - `ifconfig`: Displays interfaces and associated IP/MAC addresses.

- **Current Directory and Files:**
  - `pwd`: Shows the current directory.
  - `ls`: Lists files in the current directory.
  - `find <path> -name <filename>`: Finds a specific file in a given path.

- **User and Login Information:**
  - `who` and `last`: Show currently logged-in users and login history.
  - `whoami`: Displays the current user's privileges.

- **System Information:**
  - `uname -a`: Displays kernel version and other system information.

- **File Operations:**
  - `touch <filename>`: Creates a zero-byte file (requires write permissions).
  - `cat /etc/passwd`: Lists local users.
  - `cat /etc/hosts`: Maps domain names to IP addresses.
  - `cat /etc/group`: Lists local groups.
  - `cat /etc/resolv.conf`: Locates name servers on the local machine.

### Enumerating with Meterpreter
Meterpreter provides built-in capabilities to execute OS commands, making it a powerful tool for enumeration and data mining. Here are some key commands:

- **System Information:**
  - `sysinfo`: Provides detailed information about the target system.

- **Networking Commands:**
  - `ipconfig`, `ifconfig`, `portfoward`, and `route`: Similar to their counterparts in Windows/Linux.

- **Process Identification:**
  - `ps`: Lists all processes.
  - `getuid`: Returns the current user ID.
  - `getpid`: Prints the current process ID.

- **Interacting with the System:**
  - `cd <directory>`: Navigates between directories.
  - `cat <file>`: Outputs the contents of a file.
  - `search <pattern>`: Searches for a specific pattern in files.

By leveraging these commands and techniques, you can effectively gather the necessary information to proceed with further exploitation and privilege escalation.
