User: The following is 20 lines of a system log. Each line consists of a timestamp, log level, process id, relevant software component, and the log content. Think step-by-step and step and summarize this log chunk:

Assistant: This log chunk shows multiple errors related to the switch module and cluster filesystem. The switch module had link errors on the broadcast tree Interconnect-1T00:00:2:0 on two separate occasions. The cluster filesystem had multiple domains that were full, and multiple domains that were no longer served by a node.
