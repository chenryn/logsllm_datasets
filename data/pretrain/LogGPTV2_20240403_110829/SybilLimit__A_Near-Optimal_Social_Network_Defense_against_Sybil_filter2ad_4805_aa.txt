Abstract
Decentralized distributed systems such as peer-to-peer
systems are particularly vulnerable to sybil attacks, where a
malicious user pretends to have multiple identities (called
sybil nodes). Without a trusted central authority, defending
against sybil attacks is quite challenging. Among the small
number of decentralized approaches, our recent SybilGuard
protocol [42] leverages a key insight on social networks to
bound the number of sybil nodes accepted. Although its
direction is promising, SybilGuard can allow a large number
of sybil nodes to be accepted. Furthermore, SybilGuard
assumes that social networks are fast mixing, which has
never been conﬁrmed in the real world.
This paper presents the novel SybilLimit protocol that
leverages the same insight as SybilGuard but offers dramati-
√
cally improved and near-optimal guarantees. The number
of sybil nodes accepted is reduced by a factor of Θ(
n),
or around 200 times in our experiments for a million-node
system. We further prove that SybilLimit’s guarantee is at
most a log n factor away from optimal, when considering
approaches based on fast-mixing social networks. Finally,
based on three large-scale real-world social networks, we
provide the ﬁrst evidence that real-world social networks are
indeed fast mixing. This validates the fundamental assump-
tion behind SybilLimit’s and SybilGuard’s approach.
1. Introduction
Decentralized distributed systems (such as peer-to-peer
systems) are particularly vulnerable to sybil attacks [11],
where a malicious user pretends to have multiple identities
(called sybil identities or sybil nodes). In fact, such sybil
attacks have already been observed in the real world [18, 39]
in the Maze peer-to-peer system. Researchers have also
demonstrated [34] that it is surprisingly easy to launch sybil
attacks in the widely-used eMule system [12].
When a malicious user’s sybil nodes comprise a large
fraction of the nodes in the system, that one user is able to
“out vote” the honest users in a wide scope of collaborative
tasks. Examples of such collaborative tasks range from
Byzantine consensus [17] and voting schemes for email
spam [30] to implicit collaboration in redundant routing and
data replication in Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) [7]. The
exact form of such collaboration and the exact fraction of
sybil nodes these collaborative tasks can tolerate may differ
from case to case. However, a generic requirement is that the
number of sybil nodes (compared to the number of honest
users) needs to be properly bounded.
To defend against sybil attacks, simply monitoring each
node’s historical behavior is often insufﬁcient because sybil
nodes can behave nicely initially, and then launch an attack.
Although a trusted central authority can thwart such attacks
by issuing credentials to actual human beings or requiring
payment [21], ﬁnding such a single entity that every user
worldwide is willing to trust can be difﬁcult or impossible
(especially if that entity requires users to provide sensitive
information).
Without a trusted central authority, defending against
sybil attacks is much harder. Among the small number of
approaches, the simplest one perhaps is to bind identities to
IP addresses or IP preﬁxes. Another approach is to require
every identity to solve puzzles that require human effort,
such as CAPTCHAs [35]. Both approaches can provide only
limited protection—the adversary can readily steal IP ad-
dresses with different preﬁxes in today’s Internet [31], while
CAPTCHAs can be re-posted on an adversary’s website to
be solved by users seeking access to that site.
The SybilGuard approach. Recently, we proposed Sybil-
Guard [42], a new protocol for defending against sybil at-
tacks without relying on a trusted central authority. Sybil-
Guard leverages a key insight regarding social networks
(Figure 1). In a social network, the vertices (nodes) are iden-
tities in the distributed system and the (undirected) edges

correspond to human-established trust relations in the real
world. The edges connecting the honest region (i.e., the
region containing all the honest nodes) and the sybil region
(i.e., the region containing all the sybil identities created
by malicious users) are called attack edges. SybilGuard en-
sures that the number of attack edges is independent of the
number of sybil identities, and is limited by the number of
trust relation pairs between malicious users and honest users.
SybilGuard observes that if malicious users create too many
sybil identities, the graph will have a small quotient cut—
i.e., a small set of edges (the attack edges) whose removal
disconnects a large number of nodes (all the sybil identities).
On the other hand, “fast mixing” [25] social networks do
not tend to have such cuts. SybilGuard leverages the small
quotient cut to limit the size of sybil attacks.
SybilGuard is a completely decentralized protocol and
enables any honest node V (called the veriﬁer) to decide
whether or not to accept another node S (called the suspect).
“Accepting” means that V is willing to do collaborative tasks
with S. SybilGuard’s provable (probabilistic) guarantees
hold for (1− )n veriﬁers out of the n honest nodes, where 
is some small constant close to 0. (The remaining nodes get
degraded, not provable, protection.) Assuming fast-mixing
√
social networks and assuming the number of attack edges is
o(
n/ log n), SybilGuard guarantees that any such veriﬁer,
with probability at least 1− δ (δ being a small constant close
√
to 0), will accept at most O(
n log n) sybil nodes per attack
edge and at least (1 − )n honest nodes.
While its direction is promising, SybilGuard suffers from
two major limitations. First, although the end guarantees
of SybilGuard are stronger than previous decentralized ap-
√
proaches, they are still rather weak in the absolute sense:
Each attack edge allows O(
n log n) sybil nodes to be
accepted. In a million-node synthetic social network, the
number of sybil nodes accepted per attack edge is nearly
2000 [42]. The situation can get worse: When the num-
ber of attack edges g = Ω(
n/ log n) (or g > 15, 000 in
the million-node synthetic social network), SybilGuard can
no longer bound the number of accepted sybil nodes at all.
Second, SybilGuard critically relies on the assumption that
social networks are fast mixing, an assumption that had never
not been validated in the real world.

SybilLimit: A near-optimal protocol for real-world so-
cial networks. In this paper, we present a new protocol that
leverages the same insight as SybilGuard but offers dramat-
ically improved and near-optimal guarantees. We call the
protocol SybilLimit, because i) it limits the number of sybil
nodes accepted and ii) it is near-optimal and thus pushes the
approach to the limit. For any g = o(n/ log n), SybilLimit
√
can bound the number of accepted sybil nodes per attack
√
edge within O(log n) (see Table 1). This is a Θ(
n) fac-
n log n) guarantee. In
tor reduction from SybilGuard’s O(
our experiments on the million-node synthetic social net-
work used in [42], SybilLimit accepts on average around
10 sybil nodes per attack edge, yielding nearly 200 times
improvement over SybilGuard. Putting it another way, with
SybilLimit, the adversary needs to establish nearly 100,000
real-world social trust relations with honest users in order
for the sybil nodes to out-number honest nodes, as compared
to 500 trust relations in SybilGuard. We further prove that
SybilLimit is at most a log n factor from optimal in the fol-
lowing sense: for any protocol based on the mixing time
of a social network, there is a lower bound of Ω(1) on the
number of sybil nodes accepted per attack edge. Finally,
SybilLimit continues to provide the same guarantee even
√
when g grows to o(n/ log n), while SybilGuard’s guaran-
tee is voided once g = Ω(
n/ log n). Achieving these
near-optimal improvements in SybilLimit is far from trivial
and requires the combination of multiple novel techniques.
SybilLimit achieves these improvements without compro-
mising on other properties as compared to SybilGuard (e.g.,
guarantees on the fraction of honest nodes accepted).
Next, we consider whether real-world social networks are
sufﬁciently fast mixing for protocols like SybilGuard and
SybilLimit. Even though some simple synthetic social net-
work models [16] have been shown [6, 14] to be fast mixing
under speciﬁc parameters, whether real-world social net-
works are indeed fast mixing is controversial [2]. In fact, so-
cial networks are well-known [3, 15, 23, 37] to have groups

HonestnodesSybilnodesAttackEdgesor communities where intra-group edges are much denser
than inter-group edges. Such characteristics, on the surface,
could very well prevent fast mixing. To resolve this question,
we experiment with three large-scale (up to nearly a mil-
lion nodes) real-world social network datasets crawled from
www.friendster.com, www.livejournal.com, and
dblp.uni-trier.de. We ﬁnd that despite the existence
of social communities, even social networks of such large
scales tend to mix well within a rather small number of hops
(10 to 20 hops), and SybilLimit is quite effective at defend-
ing against sybil attacks based on such networks. These
results provide the ﬁrst evidence that real-world social net-
works are indeed fast mixing. As such, they validate the
fundamental assumption behind the direction of leveraging
social networks to limit sybil attacks.
2. Related work
The negative results in Douceur’s initial paper on sybil
attacks [11] showed that sybil attacks cannot be prevented
unless special assumptions are made. Some researchers [9]
proposed exploiting the bootstrap graph of DHTs. Here, the
insight is that the large number of sybil nodes will all be
introduced (directly or indirectly) into the DHT by a small
number of malicious users. Bootstrap graphs may appear
similar to our approach, but they have the drawback that an
honest user may also indirectly introduce a large number
of other honest users. Such possibility makes it difﬁcult to
distinguish malicious users from honest users. Instead of
simply counting the number of nodes introduced directly and
indirectly, SybilLimit distinguishes sybil nodes from honest
nodes based on graph mixing time. It was shown [9] that
the effectiveness of the bootstrap graph approach deterio-
rates as the adversary creates more and more sybil nodes,
whereas SybilLimit’s guarantees hold no matter how many
sybil nodes are created. Some researchers [5] assume that
the attacker has only one or small number of network posi-
tions in the Internet. If such assumption holds, then all sybil
nodes created by the attacker will have similar network coor-
dinates [28]. Unfortunately, once the attacker has more than
a handful of network positions, the attacker can fabricate
arbitrary network coordinates.
In reputation systems, colluding sybil nodes may artiﬁ-
cially increase a (malicious) user’s rating (e.g., in Ebay).
Some systems such as Credence [36] rely on a trusted cen-
tral authority to prevent this. There are existing distributed
defenses [8, 13, 32] to prevent such artiﬁcial rating increases.
These defenses, however, cannot bound the number of sybil
nodes accepted, and in fact, all the sybil nodes can ob-
tain the same rating as the malicious user. Sybil attacks
and related problems have also been studied in sensor net-
works [27, 29], but the approaches and solutions usually rely
on the unique properties of sensor networks (e.g., key predis-
tribution). Margolin et al. [22] proposed using cash rewards
to motivate one sybil node to reveal other sybil nodes, which
