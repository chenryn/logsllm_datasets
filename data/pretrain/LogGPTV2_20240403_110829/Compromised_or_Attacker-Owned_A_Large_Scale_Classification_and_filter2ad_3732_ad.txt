- **Lookup Count**: The number of lookups recorded for the domain in PDNS.
- **SOA Domains Count**: The number of Start of Authority (SOA) domains under which the domain was hosted.
- **Apex Match**: Whether the apex of the domain is the same as the apex of the SOA domain.

#### Lexical Host Features
- **Subdomain Levels**: The number of levels in the subdomain part of the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN).
- **Dashes Count**: The number of dashes appearing in the FQDN.
- **Alexa Top 1000 Impersonation**: Whether the domain impersonates a popular Alexa top 1000 brand.
- **Levenshtein Similarity**: Whether the domain contains words within Levenshtein distance 2 of a popular Alexa top brand.
- **Fake gTLD**: Whether the domain name includes a fake gTLD (e.g., com, edu, net, org, gov).
- **Popular Keywords**: Whether the domain name includes popular keywords.
- **FQDN Entropy**: The entropy of the FQDN.

#### Lexical Path Features
- **Brand in Path**: Whether the path has an Alexa top 1000 brand name(s).
- **Similar in Path**: Whether the path contains words within Levenshtein distance 2 of a popular Alexa top brand.
- **URL Length**: The length of the URL.
- **Query Parameters Count**: The number of query parameters in the URL.

### Observations on Compromised vs. Attacker-Owned Domains

Attackers often leverage compromised domains because:
1. **Reputation Riding**: Attackers exploit the reputation of compromised domains, which are typically long-lived and harder to detect by current reputation systems.
2. **Economic Feasibility**: Many private apex domains are not well-maintained or patched, making them easy targets. Compromising these domains is more cost-effective than setting up new ones, which incurs registration costs.

These findings align with prior research on phishing websites and public threat intelligence reports. Our study, however, covers a broader range of malicious domains using a comprehensive dataset from VirusTotal.

### Figure 10: Average Alexa Rank Distribution
- **Attacker-Owned Domains**: Most have low Alexa rankings or no rank, but some have ranks below 100K.
- **Compromised Private Apexes**: About 10% are not ranked, indicating attacks from less popular benign websites.

### Figure 11: Days from Registration to First Malicious Behavior
- **Attacker-Owned Domains**: 20% are used soon after registration, while others are used months later.
- **Compromised Benign Domains**: Often compromised years after registration due to outdated technologies and unpatched servers.

### 5.3 Attacker-Owned/Compromised Website Classifier for Public Apexes

#### 5.3.1 Ground Truth Collection
- **Dataset**: Manually created from DS1, including 613 compromised and 1157 attacker-owned public websites.
- **Identification**: Checked content and used information from services like 000webapphost.com and blogspot.com to identify and block attacker-owned sites.

#### 5.3.2 Feature Engineering
- **Features**: Utilized all features from Table 6 except hosting features, as public websites share similar infrastructures.
- **Additional Path Features** (Table 7):
  - **#URLs**: Number of URLs corresponding to the website.
  - **Std_Path_Depth**: Standard deviation of the path depth of URLs belonging to the website.
  - **Std_Query_Params**: Standard deviation of the number of query parameters for each URL belonging to the website.

#### 5.3.3 Model Training and Observations
- **Model**: Random Forest (RF) classifier with a balanced dataset.
- **Performance**: Accuracy of 97.2%, precision of 97.2%, and recall of 98.1% with 10-fold cross-validation.
- **Observations**: Unlike private apexes, attackers primarily create their own subdomains or path prefixes on public domains (80.5%).

### 6.1 Applicability to Other URL Intelligence Sources

#### Adaptation to Phishtank
- **Ground Truth Collection**: 7756 URLs from Phishtank, resulting in 6377 private phishing URLs and 2804 private apex domains.
- **Feature Extraction**: All features except VT-specific ones.
- **Model Training**: RF classifier with balanced dataset, achieving 91.2% accuracy, 93.5% precision, and 93.5% recall.
- **Performance**: Slightly lower than VT dataset, attributed to smaller dataset size and fewer features.

### 5.4 Summary of Attack Types

| Type | Apexes | URLs | Sites |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Public** | 1% | 46.5% | 20.5% (Compromised), 79.5% (Attacker-Owned) |
| **Private** | 99% | 53.5% | 65.6% (Compromised), 34.4% (Attacker-Owned) |

### 6.4 Impact of Noisy Labels and Training Data Size

- **Noisy Labels**: Classifiers show linear correlation with noise level; significant mislabeling (e.g., 15%) greatly reduces accuracy.
- **Training Data Size**: Smaller datasets reduce performance, but the impact is manageable with careful feature selection and model tuning.
