3. THE CATS
The congestion avoidance techniques (CATs) are moti-
vated by the following expectation of network behavior [8].
As illustrated in Figure 2, when network load is small, in-
creasing the load should result in a comparable increase in
network throughput with only a small increase in round-
trip times (RTT). At some point, when the load is large
enough, packets start queuing at the bottleneck. Therefore,
increasing the load further should result in a smaller in-
crease in throughput, and a larger increase in round-trip
times (this occurs at the “knee” of the load-throughput
curve). If the load is increased further, at some point, the
network throughput should drop sharply, while round-trip
times should become extremely large.
Three CATs are summarized below. The CATs are im-
plicitly based on the notion that there will be some response
from the network to a congestion window size (“load”) change
for a TCP connection. The CATs measure this response as a
function of round-trip times and/or throughput, and recom-
mend reducing or increasing the congestion window based
on the observed response. The various functions used in
these heuristics are motivated by the curves in Figure 2.

TCP-Vegas [5] requires a TCP sender to keep track of
the BaseRT T , deﬁned as the minimum of all RT T s mea-
sured during the TCP connection. When acknowledgement
for the i-th monitored packet P Wi is received, the sender
compares the quantity
BaseRT T (cid:2) W (P Wi)
BaseRT T
− W (P Wi)
RT T (P Wi)(cid:3)
with two thresholds α and β, where α > T1
Figure 3: Frequency distribution of connections by
bottleneck link speed
connections through a bottleneck bandwidth in the interval
[b − 8KBps, b). Figure 3 exhibits two peaks. The rightmost
peak is not a real one:
it relates to all bandwidths higher
than T1 (in this set of bandwidths higher than T1, no band-
width dominates). They correspond approximately to 64
Kbits/s and the T1 bandwidth. A separation line is drawn
between slow and fast bottleneck links at 64 KBytes/s. Since
there are not many connections between the two peaks at
64 Kbits/s and T1, the actual location of the separation
line between these two peaks is not very critical (so long
as it is not close to either peak). In the rest of this paper,
a connection Cl would be said to be a slow connection, if
its bottleneck link is slow (i.e., B(Cl) ≤ 64 KBytes/s); else
Cl would be said to be a fast connection. Similarly, a path
(or route) that contains a slow (fast) bottleneck link will be
said to be a slow (fast) path. Note that Figure 3 relates to
an old set of data: today, bandwidth dramatically increased
and peaks at T3 would certainly appear.
4.2 Correlation between RT T and W
Figure 4 presents four plots: one for each population of
packets (relevant packets Pi on Figure 4.a, monitored pack-
ets P Wi on Figure 4.b, front packets P Fi on Figure 4.c,
and tail packets P Ti Figure 4.d). Each plot represents the
frequency distribution of the coeﬃcients of correlation for
a given population of packets separately for slow and fast
paths. On the horizontal axis, values vary from −1 to 0.8.
in steps of 0.2. A point at (x, y) on the curve for fast (resp.
slow) pathss indicates the fraction of fast (resp. slow) TCP
connections that have a coeﬃcient of correlation in the inter-
val [x, x+0.2) is y. For example, on Figure 4.b, observe that
approximately 26% of the connections on slow links have a
coeﬃcient of correlation between 0.8 and 1. For fast bot-
tleneck links, only 6% of the connections have a coeﬃcient
of correlation between 0.8 and 1. First, observe that the
curves are quite similar for all types of packet populations.
Also observe that for slow bottleneck links, there is a sig-
niﬁcant (about 35%) proportion of connections with a high
(≥ 0.6) coeﬃcient of correlation. This supports the general
opinion that there exists a higher correlation between round
trip time and the amount of data in ﬂight on a slow link
(than on a fast link). On fast links, only about 11% of the
connections exhibit a coeﬃcient of correlation larger than
0.6.
