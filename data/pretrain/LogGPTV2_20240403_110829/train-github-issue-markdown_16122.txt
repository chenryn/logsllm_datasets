It would be nice to have the published development docs to actually reflect
the current state of master.
This has come up recently with a couple of issues being raised about typos
etc. in them which were already fixed on master (e.g. #7444 )
I would envision a similar solution to the one that scipy uses
scipy/scipy#5383
I'd be happy to work on this but I think this will need to have some input
from one the numpy devs. Their solution hosts the devdocs on github pages then
redirects the docs.scipy.org to point to that. Obviously as a mere mortal that
part I wouldn't be able to setup!
