The following tests are failing on clusters where the master is at HEAD and
the nodes are at 1.0 (in kubernetes-upgrade-gke-step3-e2e-old):
  * Kubernetes e2e suite.DNS should provide DNS for services
  * Kubernetes e2e suite.DNS should provide DNS for the cluster
They are both failing with:
    Unexpected number of pods (2) matches the label selector k8s-app=kube-dns,kubernetes.io/cluster-service=true
These tests are **not** failing once the nodes have been upgraded to HEAD to
match version with the master.
See runs 33 - 39 of the kubernetes-upgrade-gke Jenkins job.
