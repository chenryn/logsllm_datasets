People have voiced the need for form input filtering various times. Filtering
could be added to the Form component very easily by creating an (optional)
extension that enables the following API:
    $builder->add('content', 'textarea', array(
        // a single filter or an array of filters
        'filters' => new StripTags(),
    ));
The big question is which library to use for filtering. Upon short research, I
came upon two existing alternatives:
  * Zend\Filter
    * appears mature
    * potentially brings in other ZF2 baggage, which I don't care about once ZF2 supports Composer properly and unless the baggage creates further disadvantages
  * DMS-Filter
    * very young
    * supports annotation-based filtering in POPOs
Does anyone know further filtering libraries? Does anyone have experience with
Zend\Filter in non-ZF(2) projects?
#### Comparison Sheet
Zend\Filter | DMS-Filter | Comment  
---|---|---  
Alnum | Alnum | both support Unicode, Zend has special treatment for Japanese,
Chinese and Korean  
Alpha |  |  
Boolean | Boolean | DMS does a simple cast, Zend's implementation is more
complicated, but supports localized "yes" and "no" as well as leaving the
original value unchanged unless it evaluates to false (use case?)  
Callback |  |  
Digits |  |  
File\LowerCase |  |  
File\Rename |  |  
File\UpperCase |  |  
| Float |  
HtmlEntities |  |  
Int | Int |  
PregReplace |  | supports Unicode  
StringToLower | ToLower | both support Unicode  
StringToUpper | ToUpper | both support Unicode  
StringTrim | Trim | both allow the specification of a character list to be
trimmed  
StripNewlines | StripNewlines |  
StripTags | StripTags | Zend allows to specify allowed tags, attributes and
comments; DMS only allowed tags (using `strip_tags` internally).  
Not a filter, but a transformer
