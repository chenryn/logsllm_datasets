We are currently running on superset 0.22.1 with python 2.7 on Ubuntu 16.04
LTS.  
We are planning to upgrade superset to 0.35.0 version with python 3.6.9 on
Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS.  
Can you kindly let us know whether we can use old superset 0.22.1 dashboards
after upgrading to superset 0.35.0 ?  
OR  
Should we build all the superset dashboards from scratch after upgrading to
0.35.0 version ?
### Environment
