We are currently operating Superset version 0.22.1 with Python 2.7 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. Our plan is to upgrade to Superset 0.35.0 and Python 3.6.9, running on Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS.

Could you please advise whether the existing Superset 0.22.1 dashboards will be compatible and functional after the upgrade to Superset 0.35.0? Alternatively, will we need to recreate all the Superset dashboards from scratch following the upgrade to version 0.35.0?

### Current Environment

- **Superset Version:** 0.22.1

### Target Environment

Thank you for your assistance.
