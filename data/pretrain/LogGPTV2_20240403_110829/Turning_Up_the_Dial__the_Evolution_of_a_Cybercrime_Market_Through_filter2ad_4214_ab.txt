Contract Process. To create a contract, the maker specifies the
details and the user they want to trade with. If the receiving party
denies the proposed contract, it becomes denied. If they accept,
the contract becomes an active deal and they become the taker.
Otherwise, the contract is marked as expired after 72 hours if no
decision is made. After both parties accept the contract’s terms
and obligations and complete their own obligations, they can mark
the contract as complete and users can rate each other (commonly
known as B-rating). If either party is unsatisfied with the deal, they
can open a dispute. The detailed process is shown in the Appendix.
Contract Taxonomy. We observe all contracts belong to one of
five types: Sale, Purchase, and Vouch Copy are one-way, while
Exchange and Trade are bi-directional. For the economic analysis,
we exclude Vouch Copy, which was recently introduced in Febru-
ary 2020, as it represents a proof of reputation, not an economic
trade. Table 1 shows the number and proportion of contracts for
each type among all collected data. Overall, Sale dominates the oth-
ers, accounting for 64.9% of contracts created, around three times
higher than Exchange (21.5%), but has the highest non-completion
rate (54.3%). Purchase, the reverse type of Sale, accounts for 11.9%
of contracts, while Trade accounts for only 1.3%. Exchange has the
highest completion rate, at 69.8%, more than double the completion
rate of Sale (32.7%), indicating that Exchange are more likely to be
accepted and settled. Vouch Copy is the only type with no denials.
Contract Visibility. Contracts can be public (users with an up-
graded account can view all details) or private (some information
is restricted to involved parties). Information available relating to
private contracts include the maker, taker, type of deal, created
date, and expiry date. Public contracts also include the obligations
of each party, terms, goods to be exchanged, and ratings. If a user
opens a dispute, the contract becomes public regardless of its previ-
ous visibility. Table 2 shows the visibility of contracts by category.
Among created contracts, the proportion of public and private con-
tracts is 12.0% and 88.0% respectively. For completed transactions,
the percentage of public contracts is about 30% higher, accounting
for 15.7% of contracts, with 84.3% remaining private. This suggests
users tend to hide the majority of their contract details. Public
contracts are more likely to be settled, with 57.0% transactions com-
pleted compared to 41.7% in private contracts. For both created and
completed transactions, while the proportions of public Purchase,
Exchange, Trade, Vouch Copy over the total are around 20%, the
percentage of public Sale among all Sale contracts is considerably
smaller, accounting for 8.0% and 12.1%, respectively. This indicates
that contracts created by the sellers are more likely to be private.
Threads and Posts. To advertise goods or services, traders often
create a thread describing their offerings, which can then be associ-
ated with a contract. Not all of the threads associated with contracts
are advertisements, some are more general discussion threads from
elsewhere on the forum. In our dataset, we observe 68.4% of public
contracts (8.2% overall) are associated with a thread. Our dataset
includes around 6,000 threads containing roughly 200,000 posts
made by nearly 30,000 members from June 2018 to June 2020.
4 THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY
In this section, we describe the evolution of the Hack Forums
marketplace in terms of trading activities, payment methods, trans-
action values, number of contracts, parties involved, and completion
time of contracts. We also examine market centralisation over time
by looking at the social network formed by contractual relation-
ships between users. Note that for analyses relying on contractual
obligations, we only use public contracts, as the information is
hidden in private ones.
4.1 Members and Contracts
Figure 1 shows an unstable fluctuation in the monthly growth of
new contracts and new members who are party to a contract over
the three eras. Overall, while there are significant shifts between

Figure 1: Monthly growth of new members and contracts
the eras, the number of new contracts created and new members
tend to fluctuate together, except during the Set-up era, when the
number of new contracts gradually grew but the number of new
members joining the marketplace moderately decreased. During the
9-month Set-up era, the number of monthly created and completed
contracts roughly doubled, despite the number of new members
joining gradually decreasing. This indicates that on average, users
were making more contracts each month during this era.
The Stable era begins with a policy change requiring contracts
for all marketplace transactions. Compared to the month before,
created contracts increase by 172% and completed contracts by 73%.
A peak in April 2019, likely due to adoption of the new regulation,
with around 12,500 contracts made and 5,000 completed, is followed
by a gradual decline, to around 8,000 contracts made and 3,000
completed per month. From the end of Set-up to the end of Stable,
the number of monthly created contracts doubles, but completed
contracts only increase by 27%. At the beginning of this era, many
new members start participating, peaking in March 2019 with 276%
and 143% more new members involved in creating and completing
contracts compared to the month before. The participation of new
members then moderately declines to less than 50% of the peak at
the end of Stable with around 1,500 and 700 users, respectively.
The last 4-months of data collection in the Covid-19 era show
a sharp but fairly short-lived peak in both new contracts and new
members joining the market. In April 2020, there are more than
13,000 created and 5,500 completed contracts, even surpassing the
peak during the Stable era. While the number of new members
also increases, this does not outpace the past peak, indicating es-
tablished members are contributing more at this time. During this
era, the ratio of the new members involved in created and com-
pleted contracts stays unchanged, with nearly 50% users involved
in contracts not completing. This indicates while there is a stimulus
in the Covid-19 era, the users involvement of the market remains
stable. After the peak in April 2020, we see a drop in both number
of users and contracts, showing a decrease of trading activities on
the marketplace. It appears the lockdown intensively affected to
the market for only a short period after the pandemic was declared.
Contract Visibility. Figure 2 shows the proportion of created and
completed public contracts declines over the three eras. The propor-
tion of completed public contracts is consistently higher, indicating
public contracts are more likely to be completed. The biggest shift
is in the Set-up era, when the percentage of public contracts began
Figure 2: The proportion of public contract over time
Figure 3: Contract type proportions by months
at around 45%, peaking in August 2018 at over 50%, then decreasing
to around 20%. At the beginning of Stable, when contracts are
made compulsory, the proportion dropped again, accounting for
around 10% then remained mostly unchanged afterwards.
Contract Types. Figure 3 shows the evolution of monthly pro-
portion of contract types from June 2018 to June 2020. For both
created and completed contracts, the market is mostly occupied
by Sale, Purchase, and Exchange. Trade and Vouch Copy con-
stantly account for a small proportion (mostly less than 2%). During
Set-up, the proportion of created and completed contract types
stays mostly the same. At the beginning, Exchange accounts for
the largest proportion (around 50%), followed by Sale (about 40%).
Purchase starts around 10%, then gradually increases over time.
At the beginning of the Stable era, the market composition
shifts, with Sale and Exchange swapping positions. Sale domi-
nates the other types, accounting for over 70% of created and 55% of
completed contracts. The percentage of Exchange declines to less
than 20% of created and 30% of completed contracts. The proportion
of Purchase also drops to around 10% and 15%, respectively. In
this era, although the ordering of contract types stays the same, the
proportion of completed Sale is lower than completed Exchange,
indicating Exchange is more likely to be completed.
Despite the increase in contracts and members in Covid-19, we
observe little change in the proportion of contract types, suggesting
a market stimulus rather than a transformation. At the end of this
era, Sale still dominate, accounting for over 70% of created, and
55% of completed contracts. Vouch Copy, adopted in February 2020,
rapidly outpaces Trade, and continues to increase. In June 2020,
the number of Vouch Copy increased by around 91% for created
and 160% for completed contracts, compared to the end of Stable
(February 2020). This rise suggests an increased desire to establish
reputation within the market, which has a known history of scams.

Contract Completion Time. Overall, contracts complete faster
over time (see Figure 4). The maximum completion times occur in
the early months of Set-up, with the exception of Vouch Copy,
which also saw a drop in completion time after its introduction
in February 2020. The minimum completion times for all contract
types occur during Covid-19, with contracts taking less than 10
hours to complete in June 2020. This increased speed over time is
presumably due to users becoming more familiar with the contract
system, or to increased trading demand. There is a drop from Set-up
to Stable for all types; likewise, during Covid-19, completion times
for most contract types decrease, except for abnormal short-lived
peaks observed in Trade in February and April 2020. Along with
quickly completed contracts, we see some very time-consuming
transactions of Trade. As the number of Trade is rather small, it is
likely that those peaks are due to noise. We note for this analysis we
only consider contracts in which the completion date is provided,
however, as these contracts account for around 70% of all completed
contracts, we believe this is representative of the marketplace.
4.2 Market Centralisation
In most communities, centralisation naturally occurs around highly
influential members. Our dataset shows that the market is largely
centralised, with a small number of threads and members covering
the majority of transactions. Figure 5 shows the relationship be-
tween the percentage of contracts made and the corresponding top
percentile of threads and members involved. For both created and
completed contracts, about 5% of users are responsible for over 70%
of contracts, and around 70% of contracts associated with a thread
are linked to the top 30% of threads, suggesting a few influential
members and threads play a prominent role. We denote top 5%
influential members and threads contributing to the most contracts
555
Figure 7: Degree distribution of the contractual network
each month (both as maker and taker) as key members and key
threads, respectively. Note that key members and key threads can
be different for each single month.
Figure 6 shows the proportion of contracts made by key members
and threads each month. While the proportion of key members
over created contracts is consistently higher than over completed
contracts, we see a opposite with key threads, which account for a
higher proportion of completed contracts than created contracts.
Except for created contracts of key threads, where we see a drop at
the end of Set-up, the proportion of both key members and threads
increases in Set-up, being more stable during Stable, and then
drop at the end of this era. We observe a rapid increase of all types
at the beginning of Covid-19, indicating the market became more
centralised in response to the pandemic.
Network Centralisation. By looking at the underlying social
graph made by the members, we find that the forum is also highly
centralised around influential individuals in term of contractual
connectivity. We consider two users n and m have a raw connec-
tion if they share at least one contract. An inbound connection is
made from n to m if m accepts a contract from n while an outbound
connection is made from n to m if n initialises a contract to m. Note
that if a bidirectional contract (Exchange or Trade) is made from
n to m or vice versa, both inbound and outbound connections will
be taken into account for both n and m. The raw, inbound, and
outbound degrees are the number of members that n has made at
least a raw, inbound, or outbound connection with. These degrees
reflect the connectivity representing the influence of members over
the entire network. The higher the degree of n, the more influential
n is in the marketplace.
Figure 7 illustrates the degree distributions (including raw, in-
bound, and outbound) of the market, over created and completed
contracts (we omit plotting degrees that exceed 15). We observe

as removing stop-words, delimiters, digits, and unifying synonyms.
We then use regular expressions to categorise trading activities into
manually defined buckets. An uncategorised bucket is used for cases
where the description is too short or ambiguously general to infer
the category. Some of the categories are drawn from Motoyama
et al. [16], while others have been added as they arose in the data,
based on our domain-specific knowledge and from common goods
observed from the text itself. We note that some contracts are placed
in more than one category, for example, ‘buying fortnite account’
would be categorised as both gaming-related and account/license.
Most makers initiate only a small number of contracts, with 49%
making one transaction, 16% making two, and only 5% exceeding 20.
Few makers account for the long tail, with just two users initiating
over 700 contracts. Equally, most takers accept few contracts, with
46% responding to one, 16% to two, and 9% exceeding 20 contracts.
The tail is longer for takers than makers, with two takers accepting
more than 9,000 contracts. Therefore, although there is a small
number of prolific users, most activity involves one-off transactions.
Products include automated bots, hacking tutorials, remote ac-
cess tools (RATs), and eWhoring packs [18]. There is evidence the
platform is being used as a cash-out market, with considerable activ-
ity trading giftcards, Bitcoin, and in-game currencies. Table 3 shows
the top 15 commonly traded products and services, and number
of unique users involved. We split the data by maker and taker to
differentiate the parties involved. We note the total for all trading
activities does not equal the sum of individual categories as some
contracts fit into more than one category. For some transactions
(e.g., exchanging currency), both sides are counted as one category,
therefore the total is smaller than the sum of makers and takers.
A small number of categories account for the majority of trades
with currency exchange and payments accounting for the largest pro-
portion of contracts and unique users – currency exchange accounts
for about 75% of all activities, over 70% higher than payments. Gift-
card and accounts/license also account for a high proportion. In sixth
place, hackforums-related refers to virtual Hack Forums products,
such as buying bytes (a type of internal currency using within the
forum), and vouch copies (the seller gives away the offered products
for free, in exchange for vouches to gain more reputation). This
Figure 8: The growth of network degrees over time
for both created and completed contracts, for raw and inbound de-
grees, the network follows a power-law distribution, with most the
nodes having few connections (mostly ranging from 1-15), however,
there exists some nodes that are extremely linked (with raw degrees
up to 5,004 for created and 1,790 for completed contracts, while
inbound degree up to 4,992 for created and 1,789 for completed
contracts). This distribution reflects a naturally grown scale-free
network, which is different to randomly created ones, where the
degrees of all nodes are typically distributed around the average.
