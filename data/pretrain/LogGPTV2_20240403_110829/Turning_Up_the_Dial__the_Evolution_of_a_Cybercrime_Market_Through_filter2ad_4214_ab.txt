### Contract Process
To initiate a contract, the maker specifies the details and selects the user they wish to trade with. If the receiving party declines the proposed contract, it is marked as denied. Upon acceptance, the contract becomes an active deal, and the receiving party is designated as the taker. If no decision is made within 72 hours, the contract is marked as expired. Once both parties agree to the terms and obligations and fulfill their respective responsibilities, they can mark the contract as complete. Users can then rate each other, a process commonly known as B-rating. If either party is dissatisfied with the deal, they can open a dispute. The detailed process is outlined in the Appendix.

### Contract Taxonomy
Contracts fall into one of five types: Sale, Purchase, Vouch Copy, Exchange, and Trade. Sale, Purchase, and Vouch Copy are one-way, while Exchange and Trade are bi-directional. For economic analysis, we exclude Vouch Copy, which was introduced in February 2020, as it serves as a proof of reputation rather than an economic transaction. Table 1 provides the number and proportion of contracts for each type among all collected data. 

Overall, Sale contracts dominate, accounting for 64.9% of all created contracts, approximately three times higher than Exchange (21.5%). However, Sale has the highest non-completion rate at 54.3%. Purchase, the reverse of Sale, accounts for 11.9% of contracts, while Trade accounts for only 1.3%. Exchange has the highest completion rate at 69.8%, more than double that of Sale (32.7%), indicating that Exchange contracts are more likely to be accepted and settled. Vouch Copy is the only type with no denials.

### Contract Visibility
Contracts can be either public or private. Public contracts are visible to users with upgraded accounts, who can view all details. Private contracts restrict some information to the involved parties. Information available for private contracts includes the maker, taker, type of deal, creation date, and expiry date. Public contracts also include the obligations of each party, terms, goods to be exchanged, and ratings. If a user opens a dispute, the contract becomes public, regardless of its previous visibility. Table 2 shows the visibility of contracts by category.

Among created contracts, 12.0% are public, and 88.0% are private. For completed transactions, the percentage of public contracts is about 30% higher, accounting for 15.7% of contracts, with 84.3% remaining private. This suggests that users tend to keep the majority of their contract details private. Public contracts are more likely to be settled, with 57.0% of transactions completed compared to 41.7% in private contracts. For both created and completed transactions, while the proportions of public Purchase, Exchange, Trade, and Vouch Copy over the total are around 20%, the percentage of public Sale contracts is significantly smaller, accounting for 8.0% and 12.1%, respectively. This indicates that contracts created by sellers are more likely to be private.

### Threads and Posts
Traders often create threads to advertise their goods or services, which can be associated with a contract. Not all threads associated with contracts are advertisements; some are general discussion threads from elsewhere on the forum. In our dataset, 68.4% of public contracts (8.2% overall) are associated with a thread. Our dataset includes approximately 6,000 threads containing roughly 200,000 posts made by nearly 30,000 members from June 2018 to June 2020.

### The Underground Economy
In this section, we describe the evolution of the Hack Forums marketplace in terms of trading activities, payment methods, transaction values, number of contracts, parties involved, and contract completion times. We also examine market centralization over time by analyzing the social network formed by contractual relationships between users. Note that for analyses relying on contractual obligations, we only use public contracts, as the information is hidden in private ones.

#### Members and Contracts
Figure 1 illustrates the monthly growth of new contracts and new members who are party to a contract over the three eras. Overall, while there are significant shifts between the eras, the number of new contracts created and new members tends to fluctuate together, except during the Set-up era. During the 9-month Set-up era, the number of monthly created and completed contracts roughly doubled, despite a moderate decrease in the number of new members joining the marketplace. This indicates that, on average, users were making more contracts each month during this era.

The Stable era begins with a policy change requiring contracts for all marketplace transactions. Compared to the previous month, created contracts increased by 172%, and completed contracts by 73%. A peak in April 2019, likely due to the adoption of the new regulation, saw around 12,500 contracts created and 5,000 completed, followed by a gradual decline to around 8,000 created and 3,000 completed per month. From the end of Set-up to the end of Stable, the number of monthly created contracts doubled, but completed contracts only increased by 27%. At the beginning of this era, many new members started participating, peaking in March 2019 with 276% and 143% more new members involved in creating and completing contracts, respectively. The participation of new members then moderately declined to less than 50% of the peak at the end of Stable, with around 1,500 and 700 users, respectively.

The last 4 months of data collection in the Covid-19 era show a sharp but short-lived peak in both new contracts and new members joining the market. In April 2020, there were more than 13,000 created and 5,500 completed contracts, even surpassing the peak during the Stable era. While the number of new members also increased, it did not outpace the past peak, indicating that established members contributed more at this time. During this era, the ratio of new members involved in created and completed contracts remained unchanged, with nearly 50% of users involved in contracts not completing them. This indicates that, while there was a stimulus in the Covid-19 era, user involvement in the market remained stable. After the peak in April 2020, we observed a drop in both the number of users and contracts, showing a decrease in trading activities on the marketplace. It appears that the lockdown intensely affected the market for only a short period after the pandemic was declared.

#### Contract Visibility
Figure 2 shows the proportion of created and completed public contracts declining over the three eras. The proportion of completed public contracts is consistently higher, indicating that public contracts are more likely to be completed. The biggest shift occurred in the Set-up era, when the percentage of public contracts began at around 45%, peaked in August 2018 at over 50%, and then decreased to around 20%. At the beginning of the Stable era, when contracts became compulsory, the proportion dropped again to around 10% and remained mostly unchanged thereafter.

#### Contract Types
Figure 3 shows the evolution of the monthly proportion of contract types from June 2018 to June 2020. For both created and completed contracts, the market is primarily occupied by Sale, Purchase, and Exchange. Trade and Vouch Copy consistently account for a small proportion (mostly less than 2%). During the Set-up era, the proportion of created and completed contract types remained mostly the same. Initially, Exchange accounted for the largest proportion (around 50%), followed by Sale (about 40%). Purchase started around 10% and gradually increased over time.

At the beginning of the Stable era, the market composition shifted, with Sale and Exchange swapping positions. Sale dominated the other types, accounting for over 70% of created and 55% of completed contracts. The percentage of Exchange declined to less than 20% of created and 30% of completed contracts. The proportion of Purchase also dropped to around 10% and 15%, respectively. In this era, although the ordering of contract types remained the same, the proportion of completed Sale was lower than completed Exchange, indicating that Exchange contracts were more likely to be completed.

Despite the increase in contracts and members during the Covid-19 era, we observed little change in the proportion of contract types, suggesting a market stimulus rather than a transformation. At the end of this era, Sale still dominated, accounting for over 70% of created and 55% of completed contracts. Vouch Copy, adopted in February 2020, rapidly outpaced Trade and continued to increase. In June 2020, the number of Vouch Copy increased by around 91% for created and 160% for completed contracts, compared to the end of the Stable era (February 2020). This rise suggests an increased desire to establish reputation within the market, which has a known history of scams.

#### Contract Completion Time
Overall, contracts complete faster over time (see Figure 4). The maximum completion times occurred in the early months of the Set-up era, with the exception of Vouch Copy, which saw a drop in completion time after its introduction in February 2020. The minimum completion times for all contract types occurred during the Covid-19 era, with contracts taking less than 10 hours to complete in June 2020. This increased speed over time is presumably due to users becoming more familiar with the contract system or to increased trading demand. There was a drop from the Set-up to the Stable era for all types; likewise, during the Covid-19 era, completion times for most contract types decreased, except for abnormal short-lived peaks observed in Trade in February and April 2020. Along with quickly completed contracts, we observed some very time-consuming transactions of Trade. As the number of Trade is relatively small, it is likely that those peaks are due to noise. For this analysis, we only consider contracts in which the completion date is provided, however, as these contracts account for around 70% of all completed contracts, we believe this is representative of the marketplace.

#### Market Centralization
In most communities, centralization naturally occurs around highly influential members. Our dataset shows that the market is largely centralized, with a small number of threads and members covering the majority of transactions. Figure 5 shows the relationship between the percentage of contracts made and the corresponding top percentile of threads and members involved. For both created and completed contracts, about 5% of users are responsible for over 70% of contracts, and around 70% of contracts associated with a thread are linked to the top 30% of threads, suggesting that a few influential members and threads play a prominent role. We denote the top 5% influential members and threads contributing to the most contracts each month (both as maker and taker) as key members and key threads, respectively. Note that key members and key threads can be different for each single month.

Figure 6 shows the proportion of contracts made by key members and threads each month. While the proportion of key members over created contracts is consistently higher than over completed contracts, the opposite is true for key threads, which account for a higher proportion of completed contracts than created contracts. Except for created contracts of key threads, where we see a drop at the end of the Set-up era, the proportion of both key members and threads increases in the Set-up era, remains more stable during the Stable era, and then drops at the end of this era. We observed a rapid increase of all types at the beginning of the Covid-19 era, indicating that the market became more centralized in response to the pandemic.

#### Network Centralization
By analyzing the underlying social graph made by the members, we find that the forum is also highly centralized around influential individuals in terms of contractual connectivity. We consider two users, n and m, to have a raw connection if they share at least one contract. An inbound connection is made from n to m if m accepts a contract from n, while an outbound connection is made from n to m if n initializes a contract to m. Note that if a bidirectional contract (Exchange or Trade) is made from n to m or vice versa, both inbound and outbound connections will be taken into account for both n and m. The raw, inbound, and outbound degrees are the number of members that n has made at least a raw, inbound, or outbound connection with. These degrees reflect the connectivity representing the influence of members over the entire network. The higher the degree of n, the more influential n is in the marketplace.

Figure 7 illustrates the degree distributions (including raw, inbound, and outbound) of the market, over created and completed contracts (we omit plotting degrees that exceed 15). We observe that for both created and completed contracts, for raw and inbound degrees, the network follows a power-law distribution, with most nodes having few connections (mostly ranging from 1-15), however, there exist some nodes that are extremely linked (with raw degrees up to 5,004 for created and 1,790 for completed contracts, while inbound degree up to 4,992 for created and 1,789 for completed contracts). This distribution reflects a naturally grown scale-free network, which is different from randomly created ones, where the degrees of all nodes are typically distributed around the average.
