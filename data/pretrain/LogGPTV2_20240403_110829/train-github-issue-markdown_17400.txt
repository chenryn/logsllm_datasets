I have a strong habit of opening files from Windows Explorer. My prefered
method is to double-click the file. Herein lies the issue: Atom is not only
hidden in %appdata% where it can be difficult to find, but there is no static
file to associate to since atom.exe is in a versioned directory.
My suggestion is to create a very basic launcher that opens the latest version
of Atom installed so that users can associate files to Atom without needing to
update associations every update.
