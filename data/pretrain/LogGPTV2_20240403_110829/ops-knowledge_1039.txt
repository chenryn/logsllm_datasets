User: What is DDoS attack in network security, what is its harm, and what are the defense methods?
Assistant: DDoS attack is a malicious attack that uses many computers, servers or other network devices to send a large amount of data traffic exceeding its processing capacity to a target system at the same time, so as to achieve network paralysis or even service interruption. A DDoS attack is usually a joint attack by a malicious control device controlling a "botnet" composed of multiple "broilers". DDoS attacks have brought serious harm, including but not limited to: 1. Paralysis of the target website, server or even the entire network service, making it impossible for legitimate users to access the service normally; 2. Extreme congestion of the target system, or even exhaustion of network bandwidth and hardware resources, unable to work and handle business normally; 3. Bring huge business losses, and even lead to bankruptcy and shutdown of the company; 4. Harm to public opinion, which greatly affects the corporate image. At present, there are mainly the following methods for defending against DDoS attacks: 1. Traffic cleaning: The traffic cleaning service can be set between the target server and the network. By checking information such as traffic type and source address, normal requests are forwarded to the target server to filter out DDoS Attack traffic; 2. Load balancing: By setting up load balancing devices at the front end of the network, the traffic is distributed to multiple servers according to different rules and policies, reducing the load pressure on a single server and improving availability, thereby enhancing the ability to resist DDoS attacks; 3. Limit concurrent connections: limit the flow of each connection by setting the upper limit of the number of connections, limit the speed of a single IP, etc., to avoid a large number of connections and occupy bandwidth and affect normal access requests; 4. Security hardening: harden the server, set Firewall, close unnecessary services, maintain system and application security patches, etc., to fundamentally reduce the possibility of vulnerability attacks; 5. Increase network bandwidth: increasing network bandwidth can increase the capacity of the target network and enhance the ability to resist DDoS attacks ability.
