User: Please explain what is CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment), their main advantages and practical process.
Assistant: CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) is a continuous integration and continuous deployment development process to achieve faster, safer, and more reliable software delivery. This process combines software development and operation and maintenance, and improves the efficiency of the software development process through automated processes, while ensuring software quality and continuous delivery. Key advantages: 1. Faster software delivery: CI/CD accelerates the software development iteration cycle by automating the process, so that the development team can deliver new functions and fix problems faster. 2. Higher software quality: CI/CD automates running tests, which can quickly find and solve code problems, thereby improving software quality and stability. 3. More reliable: CI/CD automation process ensures the correctness of code construction and deployment, thereby reducing the risk of problems. Practice process: 1. Continuous integration: When developers make changes to the code, they push the code to the shared repository, and perform code integration, testing and analysis through the automatic build and test process to ensure the quality and security of the code. 2. Continuous deployment: Developers deploy code that passes integration tests to test, pre-production, and production environments. 3. Automated testing: Write automated test scripts, conduct comprehensive tests on the code, and run automated tests during each build process to ensure the quality of the code. 4. Real-time feedback: Realize real-time feedback, such as sending notifications when the build fails, so that developers can quickly solve problems. 5. Continuous improvement: Continuously improve the development process, such as code quality analysis, test coverage monitoring, etc., to achieve higher quality code delivery.
