Rayleigh’s Criterion leads to a lower bound on the di-
ameter of the telescope which is necessary to obtain sharp
images from a given distance [3]. Avoiding any suitable
hiding places for an adversary within these bounds thus
constitutes a viable countermeasure. This approach offers a
reasonable level of security for those cases where the build-
ing grounds can be easily controlled, however, it performs
badly if there are other buildings in proximity. However,
this bound is not necessary guaranteed. Although quite
unlikely, it might be possible to build an array of several
small telescopes that yields better optical resolution than
a single one. Technological advances may result in more
compact telescopes that offer resolution beyond the Rayleigh
bound (using so-called “super-lenses” based on materials
with “negative refraction index” [21], [9]). Furthermore,
one has to keep in mind that Rayleigh’s Criterion is not
necessarily a strict bound. Given prior knowledge about
the scene, in our case images of text, it is possible to use
deconvolution algorithms to improve on this bound ([29],
page 2).
In the following we present some more advanced coun-
termeasures that offer better security, at higher costs.
4.1. Polarization
It
is well-known that
two (linear) polarization ﬁlters
aligned at 90 degrees will block all light, but a single ﬁlter
will let 50% of (previously unpolarized) light pass through.
Putting one ﬁlter on the monitor and a rotated ﬁlter on the
window, the user can still read the monitor with slightly
reduced brightness, but an attacker outside the window can
not. This was proposed in [22] as a measure to protect
privacy. Today this is even easier to implement, as all modern
LCD monitors contain a polarization ﬁlter.
In theory two aligned ﬁlters should block 100% of the
in practice ﬁlters are not blocking per-
light. However,
fectly, and even perfect ﬁlters are difﬁcult
to align in
a working environment. Consequently, actual effectiveness
will be slightly lower than 100% (see Figure 14). Using
longer exposure times, the monitor image can be recovered.
Furthermore, metallic surfaces change the polarization of
light, rendering the ﬁlters ineffective.
4.2. Notch-Filter
Another possible countermeasure is based on optical
notch-ﬁlters, optical ﬁlters that block a very narrow band
of wavelengths and let all other wavelengths pass through
(Figure 15). The optical spectrum emitted by TFT monitors
is mainly determined by the characteristics of the back-
ground light. Colored LEDs typically have a very narrow
spectrum. Some specialized recent monitors, e.g. the ACER
AL1917L, use LEDs as background light, and thus do
have a very characteristic spectrum. The measured spectrum
for a fully white monitor image is shown in Figure 16.
Although the manufacturer’s intention is to improve the
color-characteristics of the monitor, we can exploit
this
for our purposes. By designing very narrow optical notch
ﬁlters designed to match these frequency bands it would
be possible to suppress the monitor image completely. For
images that are created by continuous spectra, e.g. those
emitted by sunlight or light-bulbs, the image quality is hardly
inﬂuenced.
When trying to implement this countermeasure we faced
a practical problem. Commercially available optical notch
ﬁlters do not match our speciﬁc needs, as only a few
common center frequencies are available. The custom design
of these ﬁlters in small quantities is prohibitively expensive.
However, for the red band emitted by the monitor with a
peak at 634.56 nm, there is a commercially available ﬁlter
which almost suits, with a peak at the laser-line 632.6 nm
(HeNe-laser). The width of this ﬁlter is 31.6 nm, which
is slightly too narrow for our monitor. Still, measurements
show that it blocks 88% of the red light emitted by the

Figure 14. These images show that the protection offered by suitably aligned polarization ﬁlters is far from being
perfect. While blocking most light (ﬁrst image), metallic objects change polarization of light, making the monitor
content readable (second image, magniﬁcation from ﬁrst image). Increased exposure times still reveal the monitor
contents (third image), in particular if the alignment of the two polarization ﬁlters is not perfect (fourth image).

informed the user upfront and asked for his permission to
mount the attack. We left the ofﬁce untouched except that we
displayed our test image on the screen for privacy reasons,
and for comparability with lab experiments. Differences to
lab conditions include: There was a window in between,
the heating was turned on, and it was raining and windy
outside. The fourth line of our test chart is still readable in
the captured reﬂections, which means that the resolution we
obtained is approximately a factor of two lower than under
lab conditions.
6. Conclusion
Prior to our work, compromising reﬂections could only
be exploited in the presence of stationary, reﬂecting objects
such as tea pots, glasses, or spoons. Removing these objects
from the work place rendered the attack impossible.
We explored several possibilities for spying on conﬁ-
dential data in the absence of these objects and evaluated
appropriate countermeasures. First, we demonstrated that
reﬂections in the user’s eye can be successfully spied on
using image deconvolution algorithms. These results also
improve our ability to spy on stationary objects. Second, we
explored to what extent diffuse reﬂections can be used to

monitor, while barely affecting “normal” light. Figure 17
shows the ﬁlter in front of red text (left image), and in
front of an apple lightened by an ordinary energy-saving
light bulb, which has a (partly) continuous spectrum (right
image). This countermeasure protects also against diffuse
reﬂections and reﬂections in metallic objects.
5. The Attack In-ﬁeld
Finally, for the sake of exposition, we mounted the attack
in-ﬁeld on reﬂections in stationary objects. Figure 18 shows
the setup of the attack, the ofﬁce that we spied on, and
the reﬂections we captured. Because of privacy (laws), we

reconstruct the original image, and were able to give bounds
stating that in all interesting cases such an attack will not
reveal more than basic shapes. Third, we evaluated several
possible countermeasures. Compared to previous work, our
improvements led to roughly a four times better resolution
for a given telescope diameter than previous work. Finally,
for the sake of exposition, we mounted the attack in-ﬁeld
on stationary reﬂecting objects.
