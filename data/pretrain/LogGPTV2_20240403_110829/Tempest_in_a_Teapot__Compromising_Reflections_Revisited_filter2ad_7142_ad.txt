### Introduction

Blinds may be partially opened accidentally or by someone unaware of the potential security threat. According to Rayleigh’s Criterion, there is a lower bound on the diameter of a telescope required to obtain sharp images from a given distance [3]. Ensuring that no suitable hiding places for an adversary exist within these bounds can serve as a viable countermeasure. This approach provides a reasonable level of security in scenarios where the building grounds can be easily controlled. However, it becomes less effective if there are other buildings in close proximity. It is important to note that this bound is not guaranteed. Although unlikely, it might be possible to construct an array of several small telescopes that could achieve better optical resolution than a single one. Technological advancements may also lead to more compact telescopes that offer resolution beyond the Rayleigh bound, such as those using "super-lenses" based on materials with a negative refractive index [21], [9]. Additionally, deconvolution algorithms can improve image resolution if prior knowledge about the scene, such as text, is available [29].

### Advanced Countermeasures

In the following sections, we present some advanced countermeasures that offer enhanced security, albeit at higher costs.

#### 4.1. Polarization

It is well-known that two linear polarization filters aligned at 90 degrees will block all light, while a single filter will allow 50% of previously unpolarized light to pass through. By placing one filter on the monitor and a rotated filter on the window, the user can still read the monitor with slightly reduced brightness, but an attacker outside the window cannot. This method was proposed in [22] as a privacy protection measure. Modern LCD monitors already contain a polarization filter, making this solution relatively easy to implement.

In theory, two aligned filters should block 100% of the light. However, in practice, filters do not block light perfectly, and aligning them precisely in a working environment can be challenging. Consequently, the actual effectiveness will be slightly lower than 100% (see Figure 14). Using longer exposure times, the monitor image can still be recovered. Furthermore, metallic surfaces can change the polarization of light, rendering the filters ineffective.

#### 4.2. Notch-Filter

Another potential countermeasure involves the use of optical notch-filters, which block a very narrow band of wavelengths and allow all other wavelengths to pass through (Figure 15). The optical spectrum emitted by TFT monitors is primarily determined by the characteristics of the backlight. Colored LEDs typically have a very narrow spectrum. Some specialized monitors, such as the ACER AL1917L, use LEDs as the backlight, resulting in a characteristic spectrum (Figure 16).

By designing very narrow optical notch-filters to match these frequency bands, it would be possible to completely suppress the monitor image. For images created by continuous spectra, such as those emitted by sunlight or light bulbs, the image quality is hardly affected.

When attempting to implement this countermeasure, we encountered a practical issue: commercially available optical notch-filters do not meet our specific needs, as only a few common center frequencies are available. Custom designing these filters in small quantities is prohibitively expensive. However, for the red band emitted by the monitor with a peak at 634.56 nm, there is a commercially available filter with a peak at 632.6 nm (HeNe-laser) that almost suits our needs. The width of this filter is 31.6 nm, which is slightly too narrow for our monitor. Nevertheless, measurements show that it blocks 88% of the red light emitted by the monitor, while barely affecting "normal" light (Figure 17). This countermeasure also protects against diffuse reflections and reflections in metallic objects.

### In-Field Attack

For the sake of exposition, we conducted an in-field attack on reflections in stationary objects. Figure 18 shows the setup, the office we spied on, and the captured reflections. Due to privacy laws, we informed the user upfront and obtained their permission to mount the attack. We left the office unchanged except for displaying our test image on the screen for privacy and comparability with lab experiments. Differences from lab conditions included the presence of a window, the heating being on, and rainy and windy weather. The fourth line of our test chart was still readable in the captured reflections, indicating that the resolution obtained was approximately half that of lab conditions.

### Conclusion

Prior to our work, compromising reflections could only be exploited in the presence of stationary, reflecting objects such as teapots, glasses, or spoons. Removing these objects rendered the attack impossible. We explored various methods for spying on confidential data in the absence of such objects and evaluated appropriate countermeasures. First, we demonstrated that reflections in the user's eye can be successfully spied on using image deconvolution algorithms, which also improves our ability to spy on stationary objects. Second, we investigated the extent to which diffuse reflections can be used to reconstruct the original image and provided bounds stating that in most cases, such an attack will not reveal more than basic shapes. Third, we evaluated several possible countermeasures, leading to roughly four times better resolution for a given telescope diameter compared to previous work. Finally, for the sake of exposition, we mounted the attack in-field on stationary reflecting objects.
