lines.
To avoid this and always use one space when joining the two lines, set the
following option.
:set nojoinspaces

Hack 30. Write Part of File to another File
To write part of a file to a new file you can use any of the following methods.
Method 1: Select the particular lines in the visual mode. Go to visual mode
(using either v or V) and navigate to the desired line, then do the following.
:w newfilename
Method 2: To write a part of file into another file, you can specify the range
as shown below. This will write the lines from 5th to 10th of current file to the
new file.
:5,10w newfilename
Hack 31. Swap Adjacent Characters
If you make a simple typing mistake with misplaced adjacent characters, you
can use xp. For example, if you’ve typed ‘teh’ instead of ‘the’, navigate to e

xp
In reality, xp is really not fixing the typo.
• x – deletes the current character (e), which also moves the cursor to
next character (h)
• p – Pastes the previously deleted character (e) after the current
character (h).
• The mnemonic for xp is "transpose".
Hack 32. The power of the . (dot) Command
The . (dot) command is simple and yet powerful. The . (dot) command
repeats the last file-content-affecting command. The following example
demonstrates the use of the . command.
1. Search for a string in a file using: /john
2. Replace john with jason using: cwjason
3. Search for the next occurrence of john: n
4. Replace john with jason using: . (dot)
In the above example, at step#4, you don’t need to type cwjason again.
Instead, simply type . (dot), which will execute the last change command,
which is cwjason.

previous insert and use it as normal mode commands which in this
case change the word john to Jason.

$ cat ~/.vimrc
inoremap  u@.
Note: There is a . (dot) next to ‘@’ at the end of the above line
