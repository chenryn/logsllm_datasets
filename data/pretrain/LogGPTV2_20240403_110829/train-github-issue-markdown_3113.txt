Currently we don't have a consistent way of handling error in our build, which
results in confusing or duplicate errors being logged to console.
  * some broccoli plugin logs stuff to console (e.g. broccoli-typescript plugin prints type errors) and throws at the end to indicate that a build failed
  * `AngularBuilder` captures any broccoli plugin errors, prints them and rethrows them
  * gulp tasks also print any errors caught and often add more task-level errors to the output
