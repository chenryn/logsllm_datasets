User: I'd like to search for a given MAC address on my network, all from within a Python script.  I already have a map of all the active IP addresses in the network but I cannot figure out how to glean the MAC address.  Any ideas?
Assistant: You would want to parse the output of 'arp', but the kernel ARP cache will only contain those IP address(es) if those hosts have communicated with the host where the Python script is running.
ifconfig can be used to display the MAC addresses of local interfaces, but not those on the LAN.
