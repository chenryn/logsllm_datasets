**ATT&CK ID:** S1020  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Window Hiding

This technique, often referred to as "Kevin," involves hiding the current window from the targeted user by utilizing the `ShowWindow` API function. [23]

### Explanation
The `ShowWindow` API function can be used to change the state of a window, including minimizing, maximizing, or hiding it. In the context of this technique, an adversary may use this function to hide a malicious window from the user's view, thereby evading detection and maintaining persistence on the system.
