User: How to optimize a web application to improve its performance and stability?
Assistant: The following are some suggestions for optimizing web applications: 1. Cache static resources: Cache static resources such as CSS, JS, and images on the browser or CDN to reduce request response time and bandwidth consumption. 2. Compress resources: Compress CSS, JS, pictures and other resources to reduce file size and improve loading speed. 3.

Use CDN: Use CDN service to distribute static resources to multiple servers around the world to improve access speed. 5. Back-end cache: Use the cache mechanism to cache some frequently requested data on the server to reduce database requests. 6.
