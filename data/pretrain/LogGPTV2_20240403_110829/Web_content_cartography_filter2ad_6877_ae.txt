Figure 7: Top 20 ASes in content delivery potential.
Figure 8: Top 20 ASes in normalized content delivery potential.
20: (i) all these ASes host Akamai caches that boost their content
delivery potential and (ii) all these ASes host some content that no
other AS can provide. Given the widespread deployment of Aka-
mai caches in carriers, the second factor is actually more important
and explains why some ASes appear among the top and why others
do not. A content-centric AS-ranking should be able to cope with
the bias introduced by the deployment of highly distributed hosting
infrastructures within ASes.
An AS-ranking based on the normalized content delivery poten-
tial does exactly this. It spreads the weight of distributed content
infrastructure across all ASes that serve their hosted content. Fig-
ure 8 provides the top 20 ASes in terms of normalized content de-
livery potential. Our ﬁrst observation is that the only overlap with
the non-normalized ranking is NTT. The ASes that appear on the
top of the normalized ranking do so because of the exclusiveness
of the content they host as reﬂected by their CMI values. As ex-
pected, Google is among the top ranked ASes due to its importance
in popular content. We also see data-center content infrastructures:
ThePlanet, SoftLayer, Rackspace, 1&1 Internet, OVH, Amazon,
Leaseweb, and Hetzner Online. A limited number of ISPs in China
seem to have a monopoly on a considerable fraction of popular
content.
When comparing the normalized potential for all hostnames with
TOP2000 and EMBEDDED, two more ASes enter the picture, Abit-
cool China and China Networks Inter-Exchange. In addition, slight
re-rankings can be observed.
4.4.1 Content vs. Traditional AS Rankings
Many topology-driven rankings have been proposed [5, 22, 3, 2].
In this section we compare content-based rankings, described in the
previous section, with topology-driven ones. Among the most well-
known AS rankings are two from CAIDA [5]: one based on AS-
degree and another on the size of the customer cone of an AS. Fixed
Orbit [2] calculate an the Knodes Index, a centrality based metric.
Labovitz et al. [22] provide an AS ranking based on the amount of
trafﬁc by monitoring inter-domain trafﬁc from 110 ASes.
Table 5 compares seven different AS rankings: the CAIDA AS-
degree (CAIDA-degree) and customer cone (CAIDA-cone) rank-
ings [5], a ranking similar to CAIDA’s by Renesys (Renesys) [3],
the Knodes Index (Knodes) as reported by Fixed Orbit [2], the traf-

ﬁc exchanges-based ranking by Labovitz et al. [23]2 (Arbor), and
ﬁnally our content-based rankings (potential and normalized poten-
tial). The purely topological rankings like the ones from CAIDA
and Renesys tend to rank large transit carriers high. Besides the
case of Google and Comcast, the top of Arbor’s ranking leads to
similar results to topological rankings. Our content infrastructure-
driven rankings on the other hand give more weight to those ASes
that deliver a large amount of content. We notice that our normal-
ized potential leads to similar top ranked ASes as topological and
trafﬁc-based rankings, while of course favoring ASes that host con-
tent.
We argue that no AS ranking captures all relevant aspects of the
importance of an AS. All aspects of the Internet are important, i. e.,
topology, trafﬁc, and content, and need to be taken into considera-
tion to understand the Internet ecosystem.
4.4.2
Summary
We proposed two different ways to rank ASes based on their
content potential. We showed that these rankings reveal different
aspects of content hosted by ASes: replicated content and content
exclusively hosted by a given AS. We proposed an index, called the
content monopoly index, which measures the degree to which an
AS hosts content not available elsewhere, compared to content that
is replicated in other ASes. Finally, we related our content-centric
rankings to those presented in the literature.
5. DISCUSSION
The deployment of hosting infrastructures is dynamic in multi-
ple ways, e. g., by growing their existing infrastructure, by chang-
ing their peerings with ISPs, or by placing part of the infrastructure
inside ISP networks. Our methodology is an automated tool that
makes it possible to monitor the state of hosting infrastructures de-
ployment in the Internet at a given point in time. Given the chang-
ing nature of the hosting infrastructures ecosystem, as observed by
Labovitz et al. [22], it is important to have tools that allow the dif-
ferent stakeholders in the Internet to better understand the space in
which they evolve.
With the commoditization of the content delivery and hosting
landscape, content producers have more and more choice as to
where they can place their content, for example to better target their
user base. With the rise of user-generated content, e. g., through
Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, content producers also need to
deliver a mix of different media for which multiple suitable content
delivery platforms might be available. Meta-CDNs such as Meebo,
an instant messenger aggregator, or Conviva3, a video delivery plat-
form, distribute the content demand across different CDNs. To un-
2Some of the entries of the Arbor ranking were intentionally omit-
ted by [22].

derstand the trade-offs involved in their business decisions, content
producers need to be able to measure the actual server diversity vis-
ible to different users from different places in the world, as well as
the performance delivered by different CDNs. Our work is a step
in this direction.
Given the already wide deployment of hosting infrastructures
around the world, existing and new CDNs need to understand the
marginal utility of deploying more infrastructure. Indeed, competi-
tion among CDNs is intense, and exacerbated by the fact that ISPs
have already deployed and are deploying more hosting infrastruc-
tures inside their network. The recently created Content Delivery
Networks Interconnect (CDNi) [25] working group at the IETF,
aimed at standardizing interconnection between CDNs, is a proof
of the maturity of the CDN market that now considers collabora-
tion.
Some ISPs nowadays deploy their own CDN, data-centers,
caches, or even CDN boxes such as those from Akamai. The in-
creased availability of content caching and hosting with ISP net-
works further complexiﬁes the current and future hosting infras-
tructures landscape. With the signiﬁcant server diversity from
which a given content can be obtained [31], both outside and inside
their network, the trafﬁc engineering task of ISPs is becoming even
more challenging. Separating intradomain trafﬁc engineering from
peering engineering is indeed becoming less and less relevant. ISPs
need to think globally about the network and understand what con-
tent can be obtained from where before making trafﬁc engineering
and peering decisions. Web content cartography, combined with
a better understanding of content delivery performance, can help
ISPs to an adequate strategy to deliver content to their customers.
It is worth mentioning the critical role of virtualization for host-
ing infrastructures. Virtualization is one of the highly disruptive en-
ablers that we believe will change the hosting infrastructures land-
scape in the near-future. Indeed, virtualization technology offers
ﬂexibility that can be exploited by content producers and providers,
as well as ISPs, to dynamically move content. By exploiting virtu-
alization, we expect to see a hosting infrastructures market that is
richer, that better utilizes the available resources, and better serves
end-users. Virtualization has both a positive and a negative impact
on Web content cartography. On the negative side, the use of vir-
tualization, together with collaboration between CDNs and meta-
CDNs, will pose challenges to Web content cartography. On the
positive side, it will make it more necessary to keep track of the
dynamic mapping of content onto hosting infrastructures.
The research community also needs an understanding of the
evolving ecosystem of hosting infrastructures, given its importance
as a driver in the evolution of the Internet. In light of the recent ob-
servations by Labovitz et al. [22] that showed signiﬁcant changes in
the whole Internet ecosystem, it is important for the research com-
munity to be able to foresee the impact of hosting infrastructures to
work on the most relevant technical challenges that the future Inter-
595net may face. Our work is a ﬁrst step in the direction of creating a
comprehensive map of the whole Internet ecosystem that includes
hosting infrastructures. A map of hosting infrastructures combined
with a corresponding view of the paths (and their performance) to
the end-users, would constitute a signiﬁcant step forward in our
understanding of Internet content delivery.
6. RELATED WORK
Our work on Web content cartography is motivated by recent
studies that provide evidence in support of the signiﬁcant rise of
Web content trafﬁc [15, 12, 22, 27]. Two major reasons are the
growth of video trafﬁc and the increasing penetration of broadband
access. To cope with these changes, large-scale content distribution
networks are being deployed [24, 30]. In addition, applications,
such as ﬁle sharing, that used to rely on peer-to-peer delivery are
nowadays increasingly served from data-centers [21], or One-click
Hosters [8].
Labovitz et al. [22] observed consolidation of Web content traf-
ﬁc as well as a signiﬁcant shift in peerings to better facilitate con-
nectivity to content providers. They analyzed inter-domain trafﬁc
over a two year period, relying on data from 110 commercial ISPs
and content providers. They detect global shifts in inter-domain
trafﬁc and the AS ecosystem. Our approach is complementary and
focuses on hosting infrastructures, not inter-domain trafﬁc. The ad-
vantage of our approach is our extensive coverage of popular host-
ing infrastructure, whose importance may be underestimated when
analyzing only inter-domain trafﬁc. For example, a signiﬁcant frac-
tion of the trafﬁc delivered by a highly distributed infrastructure
such as Akamai as well as data-centers located within ISPs, does
not cross AS boundaries.
Shue et al. [34] observed, by looking at the .com and .net
domains, that a vast majority of Web servers are co-located. Our
results, on a more diverse set of domains, conﬁrm that there is co-
location of servers as well as hosting infrastructures.
Huang et al. [17], Su et al. [35], and Triukose et al. [36] lever-
age DNS requests to understand the distribution of Web content.
However, their work is restricted to the study of speciﬁc CDNs,
and does not try to detect different types of hosting infrastructures.
Utilizing DNS replies of popular content in order to identify the
location of hosting infrastructures shares similarities with work by
Ager et al [7], by Krishnamurthy et al [20], by Feldmann et al. [14],
and by Chang et al. [9]. Yet, their focus was on studying the per-
formance of DNS resolvers [7, 20] or on deriving empirical models
of inter-domain trafﬁc matrices [14, 9], rather than leveraging DNS
for Web content cartography.
Other approaches have been proposed to identify hosting infras-
tructures. Gill et al. [16] performed traceroutes towards large host-
ing infrastructures from distributed vantage points. They relied on
DNS resolution from a single vantage point inside a university, pro-
viding a limited view of the network footprint of hosting infrastruc-
tures. Recently, Wang et al. [39] proposed a measurement method-
ology to estimate the distance between end-users towards two large
CDNs. They rely on embedded measurement scripts within multi-
ple websites and collect the measurements performed by the end-
users. Our approach differs in that we do not require the targeted
hosting infrastructure to be known a priori.
Clustering has been used in the past in different contexts, e. g., to
group end-users from the perspective of routing [19] or DNS reso-
lution [11]. Our approach does not focus on clustering of end-users,
but rather on the identiﬁcation and clustering of hosting infrastruc-
tures in the Internet.
7. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we introduce Web content cartography. We propose
a lightweight and fully automated approach to discover Web con-
tent hosting and delivery infrastructures based only on DNS mea-
surements and BGP routing table snapshots. To the best of our
knowledge this is the ﬁrst attempt to identify hosting infrastruc-
tures based on DNS replies and routing information, rather than
relying on pre-identiﬁed signatures such as CNAMES. The advan-
tage of this method is that is general enough to identify new hosting
infrastructures as well as cluster them based on their operation as
revealed by DNS.
Our results show that by utilizing traces from a small number of
well distributed vantage points it is possible to make qualitative ob-
servations for the deployment of hosting infrastructures and content
replication. A key insight of our study is that a signiﬁcant fraction
of the content is exclusively delivered by hosting infrastructures
such as Google or geographical regions, e. g., China. Furthermore,
by deriving content-centric AS rankings that complement existing
AS rankings we shed light on recent observations about shifts on
the AS topology.
Our work is an important step towards answering crucial ques-
tions for content producers, content providers, ISPs, and the re-
search community. For ISPs, knowing the locations from which
popular content can be obtained is a key factor in peering de-
cisions and network dimensioning. For content producers, geo-
graphic and network footprint of a CDN is an important factor in
choosing how to deliver content best to their customer base. For
content providers, Web content cartography can help them improve
their competitiveness in the content delivery market. Moreover,
the research community needs to understand and track the evolv-
ing ecosystem of hosting infrastructures, given their importance as
a driver in the evolution of the Internet. Web content cartography
is complementary to other maps of the Internet, e. g., router-level
and AS-level maps, and enables further investigation of the shap-
ing forces of the Internet. In particular it will allow researchers to
investigate the interplay of content infrastructures with the Internet
topology.
