data ﬁelds typically embedded in a photo, a speciﬁc photo often has a large
portion of its metadata information missing. According to our measurement
results, we found that two metadata ﬁelds, camera make and model, are the
most fundamental metadata information. That is, if they are missing in a photo,
most other metadata ﬁelds are missing too. Thus, we decide whether a photo
contains metadata information based on these two ﬁelds. A photo is regarded as
containing metadata if either of the two ﬁelds has a non-empty value.
With the help of a third-party library [2], we examined the prevalence of
metadata information among 612 “fresh” photos. We also examined if “fresh”
photos contain any sensitive metadata ﬁelds, including geolocation, owner’s
information, and modiﬁcation history, as mentioned in Sect. 2. Figure 1 shows
the percentages of photos containing metadata and sensitive metadata ﬁelds.
As high as 86.4 % of “fresh” photos contain metadata, which demonstrates the
prevalence of metadata information among freshly taken digital photos. As of
the sensitive metadata ﬁelds, 15 % of fresh photos are tagged with geolocation
information. The results show that although nearly all smartphones are now

GPS-equipped, only some of them are GPS-enabled. The percentage is expected
to be even lower if more people are aware that smartphones may automatically
embed geolocation into photos and then choose to turn the GPS functionality
oﬀ. None or hardly any of “fresh” photos contain photographers’ information or
modiﬁcation history in their metadata. We speculate that it is due to (1) our
strict task requirements and (2) the possibility that these two kinds of sensitive
metadata ﬁelds may not be automatically embedded at the time of a photo shot.
Impact of Smartphone OS on Geolocation Metadata. It is interesting to
examine which kind of smartphone OSes are more likely to automatically embed
the sensitive geolocation information into photos. Figure 2 shows that about one
third of iOS and Windows phones automatically embed geolocation into photos
while only about 10 % of Android and Blackberry phones do this.
4 Intact Photos
In the “intact” stage, photos have been posted online while retaining intact
metadata information. From this perspective, “intact photos” could reﬂect the
status of metadata in digital photos at the time of being shared online. In this
section, we describe our data collection method for “intact” photos and examine
the embedded metadata information in them.
4.1 Data Collection
To collect such photos, we crawled photos from Flickr, a large photo-sharing
website, using its API with the download option of “original size,” which guar-
antees that the photos remain original and intact from the site. More speciﬁcally,
we collected two sets of “intact” photos from Flickr. The ﬁrst set denoted by
Flickr p contains 18,404 photos exclusively taken with smartphones. Those pho-
tos were crawled from the Flickr group “Smartphone Photography” where all
photos were taken with smartphones. The other set denoted by Flickr 6 contains
43,704 photos uploaded within six months from July 1, 2014 to December 31,

2014. Our further examination shows that 94.3 % of the photos in Flickr 6 were
taken with digital cameras.
4.2 Metadata Information Embedded
Similarly, we examined the percentage of “intact” photos containing metadata
information, especially sensitive metadata ﬁelds. Figure 3 shows the percentages
of “intact” photos containing metadata and sensitive metadata ﬁelds.
It shows that intact photos in Flickr p and Flickr 6 have quite high per-
centages containing metadata information, 76.4 % and 94.1 %, respectively. The
results indicate that most digital photos taken with either digital cameras or
smartphones contain metadata when being uploaded online. In addition, 37.1 %
Flickr p and 27.2 % Flickr 6 photos contain GPS information. Considering 15 %
of “fresh” photos tagged with geolocation, we speculate that some photo owners
may embed GPS information into photos during post processing to better show
their photographic works on Flickr. Moreover, up to 65.6 % and 88.1 % Flickr p
and Flickr 6 photos contain the photographer information, which could pose
a great risk of identity leakage to photo owners. Additionally, about a half of
Flickr 6 photos contain modiﬁcation information. Most photos in the set are
taken with professional digital cameras and photo owners often show intense
interest in reﬁning their works with image processing software. By contrast, a
much lower percentage of Flickr p photos taken with smartphones are modiﬁed.
5 Wild Photos
In the “wild” stage, most online photos have lingered on the Internet for a while
and may have experienced multiple modiﬁcations by the hosting sites. In this
section, we attempt to ﬁgure out the metadata information remaining in the
“wild” photos and explore how the top media sites handle the photos hosted
on them.

5.1 Data Collection
We employed two methods to collect “wild” photos. The ﬁrst method is to
randomly collect photos by Google Images Search. In the custom search control
panel, we set the image type as photo, ﬁle type as JPG/JPEG ﬁles, image size as
larger than 400*300, and the date range from January 1, 2012 until January 1,
2015. Nearly all digital photos are in JPEG format. The speciﬁed image size can
ﬁlter out most of graphs, drawings, and other non-photo images. In addition,
we only focus on the photos posted online in the past three years. We totally
collected 38,140 photos in this way and denoted them by GoogleImage.
Secondly, to investigate top media sites’ policies on handling photos, we
need to obtain a representative set of media sites. Alexa categorizes millions
of sites and deﬁnes a list of site categories [4], from which we selected seven
categories, which are “social networking,” “weblog,” “news,” “college,” “gov-
ernment,” “classiﬁed,” and “shopping”. The reason why we chose them is that
presumably the sites in these categories usually host large amounts of photos.
Alexa provides for each category a list of the top 500 sites. We selected the top
100 sites for each category and thus we had 700 unique top ranked sites in total
as our subject representative of online media sites.
Not every photo appearing on a site is hosted by the site. A photo is consid-
ered being hosted on a site only if its image URL has the same domain as the
site URL. Only the photos hosted on a site are eligible to be used for studying
the site’s polices. During our photo collection from each site, we only crawled the
photos hosted on that site. Speciﬁcally, for each of the 700 sites, we attempted to
crawl 1,000 photos that appeared online after January 1, 2012. Those photos are
expected to reﬂect the photo policy used by the hosting site under an assumption
that the site has not made signiﬁcant changes to its photo handling policy in the
recent years. Due to unexpected factors including network connection failure and
access permission denied, we were able to crawl 97,664 photos from 679 unique
sites. To ensure the representativeness of these photos, we ﬁltered out the sites
from which less than 10 photos were collected. Finally, we had 97,403 photos
for 611 unique sites as our dataset for the study, about 160 photos per site on
average. This set of photos are denoted as TopSitesPhoto.
Figure 4 depicts the number of photos crawled from each site. It shows that
about 80 % of sites have over 60 photos crawled, about 35 % of sites have over
120 photos crawled, and about 20 % have over 300 photos crawled. We crawled
a maximum number of 1,026 photos for one site3.
5.2 Metadata Information Embedded
Figure 5 shows the percentages of “wild” photos containing metadata, especially
those sensitive metadata ﬁelds. It shows that the percentages of “wild” photos
containing metadata information in the sets GoogleImage and TopSitesPhoto are
41.5 % and 40.4 %, respectively, which are much smaller than that of “intact”
3 We crawled the site twice and collected over 1,000 photos.

photos (up to 94.1 %). In addition, very few “wild” photos are tagged with GPS
coordinates. In GoogleImage and TopSitesPhoto, the percentages are 0.6 % and
1.8 %, respectively, smaller than those of “fresh” and “intact” photos. Moreover,
only 13.2 % of GoogleImage photos and 8.7 % of TopSitesPhoto photos contain
photographers’ identiﬁcation information. About 25.4 % of GoogleImage photos
and 14.1 % of TopSitesPhoto photos contain modiﬁcation history information.
These results imply that compared to “fresh” and “intact” photos, a considerable
proportion of “wild” photos have their embedded metadata stripped away.
5.3
Inferring Online Sites’ Photo Handling Policies
Based on TopSitesPhoto, we have built a set of photos for each of the 611 unique
sites. We attempt to infer a site’s photo handling policy by characterizing the
photos collected from the site. Speciﬁcally, we aim to answer two questions about
a site’s photo handling policy. One is whether the site resizes the photos it hosts,
