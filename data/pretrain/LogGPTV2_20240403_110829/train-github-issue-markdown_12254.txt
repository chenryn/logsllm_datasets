Using SQLAlchemy 1.2.14, I attempted to reflect a schema from a customer which
contained several thousand tables, and noticed this was very slow. Using
echo="debug" as an option on the engine, I noticed that the SQLAlchem
reflection code is iteratively querying the database for table metadata,
instead of issuing one query.
I believe this is sub-optimal, and performance would be greatly enhanced if
the SQLAlchemy reflection code issued one query to the backend instead of
iterating over the table list.
Example times: MS SQL Server database with 3,300 tables: 15 minutes.  
PostgreSQL database with 694 tables: 4 minutes.  
PostgreSQL database with 18,000+ tables: 45 minutes.
