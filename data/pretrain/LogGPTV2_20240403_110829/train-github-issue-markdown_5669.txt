## üêõ Bug
The sample C++ program for libtorch results in an incorrect Makefile because
the path to libculibos.a is hardcoded somewhere as
`/usr/local/cuda/lib64/libculibos.a`.  
On Arch Linux, the default install directory for CUDA is `/opt/cuda`.  
**This is handled correctly for other linked libraries.**
## Workaround
After running CMake, modify `CMakeFiles/(project).dir/build.make` and modify
the line:  
(project): /usr/local/cuda/lib64/libculibos.a  
to:  
(project): /opt/cuda/lib64/libculibos.a
This fixes the problem for me with CUDA 10.
## To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
  1. Be on Arch Linux with libtorch downloaded from the official download link.
  2. Try to follow the [minimal C++ example]: https://pytorch.org/cppdocs/installing.html
  3. You will get an error when running `make`, which can be fixed with the temporary workaround shown above.
