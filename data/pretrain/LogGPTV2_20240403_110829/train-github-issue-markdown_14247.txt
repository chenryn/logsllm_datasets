### Apache Airflow version
Other Airflow 2 version
### What happened
Airflow 2.2.5
Airflow scheduler will fail to start with the following lof when a
task_instance has a blank queued_dttm  
Setting the start_dt as queued_dttm resolved the issue. I am not sure when a
task would have an empty queued_dttm

### What you think should happen instead
The scheduler should be able to start or a empty queued_dttm should not be
allowed
### How to reproduce
Have a task instance with null queued_dttm
