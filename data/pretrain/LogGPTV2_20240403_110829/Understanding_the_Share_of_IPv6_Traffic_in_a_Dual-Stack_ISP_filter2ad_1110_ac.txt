# Understanding the Share of IPv6 Traffic in a Dual-Stack ISP

## Abstract
The transition to IPv6 is a significant operational effort. This study delves into the lesser-known aspect of IPv6 usage, revealing obstacles that hinder IPv6 traffic in dual-stack ISPs. These include Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) devices not supporting IPv6, applications falling back to IPv4, and a general lack of IPv6 support among service providers. Despite these challenges, we report a notable increase, intent, and potential for growth in IPv6 traffic. We expect that as IPv6 traffic shares grow, it will eventually become the primary protocol of the Internet.

## 1. Introduction
The Internet's transition to IPv6 is a massive operational undertaking. The research community supports this effort by providing measurements of IPv6 adoption across the Internet. In this work, we explore a less-studied aspect: IPv6 usage. We identify barriers to IPv6 traffic in dual-stack ISPs, including CPE devices without IPv6 support, applications reverting to IPv4, and a widespread lack of IPv6 support from service providers. Despite these obstacles, we observe a significant increase, intent, and potential for growth in IPv6 traffic. We anticipate that increasing IPv6 traffic shares will make IPv6 the primary protocol of the Internet.

## 2. Methodology
### 2.1 Data Collection
We collected data from a large dual-stack ISP, focusing on both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. We used a combination of passive monitoring and active probing to gather detailed information about the network's behavior.

### 2.2 Metrics
- **TCP Handshake and DNS Resolution Times:** We compared the differences in TCP handshake and DNS resolution times between IPv4 and IPv6.
- **Subscriber Connectivity:** We analyzed the connectivity status of subscribers, distinguishing between IPv6-active and IPv6-inactive users.
- **Service Time Differences:** We measured the time differences in service delivery between IPv4 and IPv6.
- **FQDNs Enabling IPv6:** We estimated the maximum possible share of IPv6 traffic if all FQDNs enabled IPv6.

## 3. Results
### 3.1 TCP Handshake and DNS Resolution Times
Figure 3 shows the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of the differences between IPv6 and IPv4 TCP handshake and DNS resolution times per host name. Positive values indicate longer transactions for IPv6 and AAAA records.

### 3.2 Maximum Possible Share of IPv6 Traffic
Figure 4 presents an upper bound for the share of IPv6 traffic when top traffic-contributing FQDNs enable IPv6. We provide two estimates: one assuming no changes in subscriber connectivity and another assuming all subscribers become IPv6-active.

### 3.3 Happy Eyeballs
Given that part of the traffic carried over IPv4 could be carried over IPv6, we studied RTT estimates and DNS resolution times for dual-stack applications and devices. Our results show that dual-stack services generally offer similar conditions, with around 80% of the values within a range of 10 ms. This suggests that happy-eyeball implementations are likely to select IPv6.

## 4. Case Studies
### 4.1 Large Search Provider
Our first case study involves a large search provider that actively supports and promotes IPv6. 37.6% of its traffic is IPv6, contributing 69.9% of all IPv6 traffic in the trace. After annotating 91.8% of the traffic with FQDNs, we found that almost all content (98.7%) requested by users is available over IPv6. IPv4-only and IPv6-inactive subscribers generate 74.1% of the IPv4 traffic, while the share of IPv6 traffic for IPv6-active subscribers is 70.5%.

### 4.2 Large CDN
For the second case study, we annotated 84.7% of the CDN traffic with FQDNs. Only 2.5% of the traffic is carried over IPv6, and only 3.3% of the CDN traffic relates to IPv6-ready services. This indicates that the server side is the bottleneck for IPv6, as only 2.1% of the content requested with AAAA is exchanged over IPv6.

## 5. Discussion
While our vantage point is not representative of the entire Internet, our observations likely apply to other dual-stack ISPs. These insights can help ISPs and service providers in provisioning for IPv6 and understanding traffic dynamics during the transition phase. For example, IPv4-only service providers could exchange up to 30% of their traffic over IPv6 if they enable IPv6. Virtual CPEs could facilitate the transition to IPv6 and simplify troubleshooting.

## 6. Conclusion
The Internet's transition to IPv6 is a significant operational effort. Our study reveals obstacles hindering IPv6 traffic in dual-stack ISPs, but also reports a pronounced increase, intent, and potential for growth in IPv6. We expect that as IPv6 traffic shares grow, it will become the primary protocol of the Internet.
