When I change app code, vendors.js will have a slight change as following
image shows, this prevents me from doing long term caching.  
It seems that chunk 0 refers to my app chunk, but it's unnecessary to have
this in my vendors file.  
How am I supposed to do to keep my vendors content same when I just change my
app code?
