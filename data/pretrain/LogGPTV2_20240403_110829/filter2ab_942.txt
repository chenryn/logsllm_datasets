**ATT&CK ID:** T1136  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Create Account

Adversaries may create new accounts on victim systems to maintain persistent access. If they have sufficient privileges, adversaries can use these newly created accounts to establish secondary, credentialed access. This method allows them to avoid the need for persistent remote access tools, as they can log in using the credentials of the created account.
