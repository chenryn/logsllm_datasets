User: How to log in to a remote Linux server through the SSH protocol?
Assistant: To log in to a remote Linux server through the SSH protocol, follow the steps below: 1. Open a terminal or command line interface. On the Windows system, you can use tools such as PuTTY or PowerShell; on the Linux or MacOS system, you can directly use the terminal. 2. Enter the ssh command followed by the IP address or hostname of the remote server you want to log into. For example: ```ssh username@192.168.1.100``` or: ```ssh username@example.com``` where username is the username on the remote server, 192.168.1.100 is the IP address of the remote server, example .com is the hostname of the remote server. 3. After connecting to the remote server, you need to enter the password of the user on the remote server to log in. 4. After successful login, you can execute various commands or edit files and other operations. You can use the exit command to log out and disconnect from the remote server. It should be noted that when connecting to the remote server for the first time, you may receive a prompt similar to "The identity of this computer cannot be verified". This is because the SSH protocol uses public key encryption. In order to ensure the security of the connection, the public key of the remote server needs to be added to the trust list of the local machine. You can operate according to the prompts, or manually add the public key to the ~/.ssh/known_hosts file, and you will not receive this prompt again in the future.
