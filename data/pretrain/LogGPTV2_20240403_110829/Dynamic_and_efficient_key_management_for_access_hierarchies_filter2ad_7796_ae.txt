To complete the proof of O(1) amortized shortcuts main-
tenance time, we must now show that a linear number of
operations must have taken place before we were forced into
a linear-time shortcuts-recomputation. To do this, we can
think of the eﬀect of insertions/deletions as implicitly re-
deﬁning the notion of centroid to be more ﬂexible than that
of “no subtree of size more than n/2 when the centroid
is removed”. That is, hypothetically suppose that in our
construction we replaced the notion of centroid by that of
c-approximate-centroid: A node whose removal leaves sub-
trees with respective sizes of no more than cn for a con-
stant c ≥ 0.5 (e.g., c = 3/4).
If we did that, our claim
of O(log log n) performance would obviously still hold (only
the constant factor hiding behind the “O” notation would
change). Now note that, before any insertions and dele-
tions, we have shortcuts that are consistent with the “rigid”
(i.e., n/2) notion of a centroid. When we initiate a re-
computation of shortcuts, the shortcut edges violate every
c-approximate-centroid notion (because otherwise, as just
stated, all ancestor-to-descendant paths would have double-
logarithmic length). In order for shortcuts in a speciﬁc sub-
tree with n nodes to go from being initially consistent with
a rigid n/2 notion of a centroid, to not being consistent
with an (e.g.) (3n/4)-approximate-centroid notion, a linear
number of insertions/deletions must have occurred in that
subtree. This completes the proof.
6.6 More general hierarchies
Although this section dealt mainly with trees, the basic
ideas can be adapted to more general hierarchies.
If we
moved from a tree to a more general graph, the notion of
centroid is replaced by that of a separator — a “small” sub-
set of the vertices whose removal leaves connected compo-
nents of size no more than cn for some constant c = O(1).
Such subsets are known to exist: A separator of size O(√n)
exists for planar graphs [32], and the whole (recursive) sep-
arator structure for such a graph can be computed in linear
time [20]. More general classes of graphs also have small
separators, e.g., graphs of bounded genus [19]. Bounded
genus seems to capture most RBACs (in fact, even the class
of genus zero – planar graphs – seems to capture many com-
monly found “practical” RBACs).
7. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
In summary, we give the ﬁrst solution to the problem of
access control in an arbitrary hierarchy G with the following
properties:
1. Only hash functions are used for a node to derive a
descendant’s key from its own key;
2. The space complexity of the public information is the
same as that of storing graph G;
3. The derivation by a node of a descendant’s access key
requires O(`) bit operations, where ` is the length of
the path between the nodes, for arbitrary hierarchies
and log log n or less for trees;
4. Updates are handled locally and do not “propagate”
to descendants or ancestors of the aﬀected part of G;
5. The scheme is resistant to collusion in that no subset
of nodes can conspire to gain access to any node access
to which they cannot legally obtain;
6. The private information at a node consists of a single
key associated with that node.
We also provided simple modiﬁcations to our scheme that
allow to handle Crampton’s extensions of the standard hier-
archies to “limited depth” and reverse inheritance [13], and
gave shortcut schemes that permit to signiﬁcantly reduce
key derivation time for tree hierarchies.
Future directions of this work include:
1. Extend our scheme to support temporal constraints.
2. Extend our scheme to support “limited depth” per-
mission inheritance in access graphs that are not lay-
ered without adding virtual nodes and in a collusion
resilient manner.
3. Give a more developed shortcut scheme for general hi-
erarchies.
