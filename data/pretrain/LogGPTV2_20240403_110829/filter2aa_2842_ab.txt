Your Mind: Legal Status, Rights and Securing Yourself - DEFCON17
33
When we transition from “remember 
something” to “remember to do some 
action”… there’s a natural extension to:
“Make a decision for me.”
This is getting really close to the legal 
definition of agency.
We’re already doing this. My Outlook client 
decides whether or not to accept meeting 
invitations based on criteria that I give it.

Is there a bright line we can draw to 
distinguish your thoughts and 
memories from those you’ve recorded?
…At what point does the
computer become a legal agent?

How am I related to my:
» Computer
»
hardware – chattel 
»
software – explicit license with multiple
corporations
» Data Storage
»
local - chattel
»
remote – contract with 3rd party
» Transmission Capability
»
direct – explicit license with the FCC
»
internet – contract with 3rd party

But is it even possible to “own” a 
computer in the sense that I can own a 
carrot?
If I’m not an owner but merely a 
licensee, who really owns my 
computer?
What the *&^#%!!!!!

37
…but if the computer isn’t “mine” in a 
reasonable sense, can it still make 
decisions that I am bound to?

…is there any other situation where a 
licensed non-entity can apparently 
enter into contracts on behalf of a 
natural person?

Do I have an explicit or implicit contract 
with my computer?

Can a computer do these things and 
somehow become legally “alive”?

What does it take to become "legally" an 
agent - for yourself or others?

Can we map out a "cognitive ladder" that 
one of these 
data/computer/information systems 
can climb towards legal maturity?

43
We already have a set of cases which 
describe the legal nature of less than 
adult. Are computer-based agents 
similar to children?
2009-08-02

44
Various "adult" ages:
» Age of Majority
» Age of License
» Age of Consent
» Age of Criminal Responsibility
All of these vary from 7 - 21
There's quite a gap there in terms of 
capability or capacity for cognition.

The other obvious place where the law 
has considered the concept of 
cognitive maturity as it relates to legal 
maturity is in the case of mentally 
handicapped adults.
Could a computer pass these tests?

Do these cognitive agents represent your 
thoughts?
If they do, they should have the same 
protections as your mind.
But if they don’t…

You can move actual memory out of 
your head and into a device.

You’ve probably already done this with 
some things…
•
Do you keep track of phone 
numbers anymore?
•
What about important dates?
•
What are you doing next Thursday?
Let me just ‘borrow’ your phone – how’s 
your memory now?

Record of your actions or activities…
•
Are you establishing intent?
•
Can you ever take it back?
•

over text messages – sometimes 
even without a subpoena.

Public Surveillance beyond the simple CCTV
Future Attribute Screening Technology
(FAST) assesses pre-crime thoughts.
FAST is grounded in research on human behavior and 
psychophysiology, focusing on new advances in 
behavioral/human-centered screening techniques. The aim 
is a prototypical mobile suite (FAST M2) that would be used 
to increase the accuracy and validity of identifying persons 
with malintent (the intent or desire to cause harm). 
Identified individuals would then be directed to secondary 
screening, which would be conducted by authorized 
personnel.

RFID + Security: Don't Mess With Las Vegas?
Third Eye has a new RF-based security system, 
SATS (Security Alert Tracking System) based on a 
wristband biosensor (from SPO Medical) that 
monitors employee's heart rate. 
If the rate suddenly increases, management is 
alerted by an RF signal from the wristband.
The premise is that if a casino employee's heart 
starts suddenly beating rapidly, they are likely 
under stress. This could be due to some 
emergency such as a robbery, or possibly 
because the employee is planning a theft.

In conclusion, we're asking you to do 
your part to engage with the general 
public, legislators and vendors. Help 
them to understand that we may not 
need entirely new ways of dealing with 
what we're creating, but we MUST 
consider the implications prior to 
unleashing our new overlords.
