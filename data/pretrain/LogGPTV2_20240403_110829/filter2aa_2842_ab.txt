# Your Mind: Legal Status, Rights, and Securing Yourself - DEFCON17
## August 2, 2009

### Slide 33
When we transition from "remember something" to "remember to do some action," there is a natural extension to "make a decision for me." This is getting very close to the legal definition of agency. We are already doing this. For example, my Outlook client decides whether or not to accept meeting invitations based on criteria that I provide.

### Slide 34
Is there a clear line we can draw to distinguish your thoughts and memories from those you've recorded? At what point does the computer become a legal agent?

### Slide 35
How am I related to my:
- **Computer Hardware**: Chattel
- **Software**: Explicit license with multiple corporations
- **Data Storage**:
  - **Local**: Chattel
  - **Remote**: Contract with a third party
- **Transmission Capability**:
  - **Direct**: Explicit license with the FCC
  - **Internet**: Contract with a third party

### Slide 36
But is it even possible to "own" a computer in the same sense that I can own a carrot? If I am not an owner but merely a licensee, who really owns my computer? What the *&^#%!!!!!

### Slide 37
If the computer isn't "mine" in a reasonable sense, can it still make decisions that I am bound to?

### Slide 38
Is there any other situation where a licensed non-entity can apparently enter into contracts on behalf of a natural person?

### Slide 39
Do I have an explicit or implicit contract with my computer?

### Slide 40
Can a computer do these things and somehow become legally "alive"?

### Slide 41
What does it take to become "legally" an agent—whether for yourself or others?

### Slide 42
Can we map out a "cognitive ladder" that one of these data/computer/information systems can climb towards legal maturity?

### Slide 43
We already have a set of cases that describe the legal nature of individuals who are less than adults. Are computer-based agents similar to children?

### Slide 44
Various "adult" ages:
- **Age of Majority**
- **Age of License**
- **Age of Consent**
- **Age of Criminal Responsibility**

These vary from 7 to 21, indicating a significant gap in terms of capability or capacity for cognition.

### Slide 45
The law has also considered the concept of cognitive maturity as it relates to legal maturity in the case of mentally handicapped adults. Could a computer pass these tests? What happens when ELIZA meets Rainman?

### Slide 46
Do these cognitive agents represent your thoughts? If they do, they should have the same protections as your mind. But if they don’t...

### Slide 47
What happens when...

### Slide 48
You can move actual memory out of your head and into a device.

### Slide 49
You’ve probably already done this with some things:
- Do you keep track of phone numbers anymore?
- What about important dates?
- What are you doing next Thursday?

Let me just 'borrow' your phone—how’s your memory now?

### Slide 50
Record of your actions or activities:
- Are you establishing intent?
- Can you ever take it back?
- Your cell phone provider will turn over text messages—sometimes even without a subpoena.

### Slide 51
But I’m a hipster and I want to have access to my memory everywhere—I use Cloud Memory!!! Who really controls your information?

### Slide 52
**Prosthetic Memory**
- The Microsoft Research SenseCam
- Proven successful in aiding memory recall of Alzheimer's patients.

### Slide 53
...but you actively chose to use all of those things...you’ve done this to yourself...but what if you have no option?

### Slide 54
Medical prosthetics are no longer “dumb” devices:
- Pacemakers
- Automatic Defibrillator (BH 2008-Kohno, Fu)
- Insulin / Drug Pumps
- Seizure Detection/Control

They include event loggers, wireless communications, and vulnerability to subpoena.

### Slide 55
**Public Surveillance beyond Simple CCTV**
- Future Attribute Screening Technology (FAST) assesses pre-crime thoughts.
- FAST is grounded in research on human behavior and psychophysiology, focusing on new advances in behavioral/human-centered screening techniques. The aim is a prototypical mobile suite (FAST M2) that would be used to increase the accuracy and validity of identifying persons with malintent (the intent or desire to cause harm). Identified individuals would then be directed to secondary screening, which would be conducted by authorized personnel.

### Slide 56
How the USA Department of Homeland Security views these things...

### Slide 57
...

### Slide 58
- Are your thoughts legible at a distance?
- Are you okay with a blanket grant on what you might be thinking?
- How do you control your biometric data once it’s measured and taken by others?

### Slide 59
Employers collecting biometric data on employees—what does it reveal about your thoughts?
- FBI is collecting biometric data stored in the Clarksburg, West Virginia facility.

### Slide 60
**RFID + Security: Don't Mess With Las Vegas?**
- Third Eye has a new RF-based security system, SATS (Security Alert Tracking System), based on a wristband biosensor (from SPO Medical) that monitors an employee's heart rate.
- If the rate suddenly increases, management is alerted by an RF signal from the wristband.
- The premise is that if a casino employee's heart starts suddenly beating rapidly, they are likely under stress. This could be due to some emergency such as a robbery, or possibly because the employee is planning a theft.

### Slide 61
Where is the boundary between thoughts that are private and thoughts that are available in the public realm? Is the man with the magic box stealing my soul?

### Slide 62
So, my thoughts can be made public and can be used against me. At least that's out of my control. What if my thoughts conspire against me?

### Slide 63
It's not like there's ever been software written that had a flaw...

### Slide 64
...and bad people like to exploit flaws in computer software and wouldn't mind knowing what I'm thinking about...

### Slide 65
...and since my computer is legally an agent and can make binding decisions—even contracts on my behalf...

### Slide 66
...or the government could retroactively declare some thought or memory as illegal and prosecute me for it...

### Slide 67
Thanks for scaring the crap out of me. What can be done? How can I protect myself?

### Slide 68
**James: IANALJASD**
- I am not a lawyer, just a security dude.
**Tiffany: IAALBNYL**
- I am a lawyer, but not your lawyer.
*Note: If you follow this advice, you’re likely safer, but you can still be screwed.*

### Slide 69
Practical measures for keeping your thoughts safe while they are stored:
- Keep them in your home.
- Use encryption.
- Don't give any cause to make them look hard. Truecrypt hidden partitions are findable.
- Store data in difficult-to-subpoena places.
- Launch your own data storage satellite.

### Slide 70
Practical measures for managing newly forming cognitive agents:
- Beware licensing.
- Limit capability.
- Resist the urge to join the digerati.
- Work to maintain and improve digital civil liberty and privacy legislation.

### Slide 71
The best advice is simple awareness that your mind and your memory aren't necessarily your own.

### Slide 72
In conclusion, we're asking you to do your part to engage with the general public, legislators, and vendors. Help them understand that we may not need entirely new ways of dealing with what we're creating, but we MUST consider the implications prior to unleashing our new overlords.

### Slide 73
- If you’re inspired by Carrie Underwood’s "Before He Cheats," don’t get caught doing it on camera…

### Slide 74
- Or if you happen to be in range of a FAST camera, think nice thoughts…

### Slide 75
- …or go into a database forever with the caption “…There can be only one!” associated with your legal name.
