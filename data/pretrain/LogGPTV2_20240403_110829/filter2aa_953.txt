PCI: 
Compromising Controls 
and 
Compromising Security 
PCI? At DefCon? 
Compliance is changing the way companies "do 
security", and that has an effect on everyone, 
hacker, defender, attacker, and innocent 
bystander. 
One result is that companies fear QSAs more 
than 0-days.

Usual disclaimers 
• We do not speak for our employers, clients or 
customers.  Nor for our spouses, siblings, or 
offspring.  But my dog will back me up. 
• Our opinions are our own, the facts are as we 
see them. 
• We aren’t lawyers…etc. 
• These QSAs are not your QSAs. 
PCI. Discuss. 
• PCI vs. Security. Is it really “vs.” security? 
• PCI hampers the advanced. Right? Really? 
• At least it is timely.  And the three years cycle 
insures that. 
• PCI has an impact on ALL of us, even if not 
under the heel of its hobnail boot. Or does it? 
Obligatory Bell Curve Slide 
More accurate curves 
With pictures, even. 
Zombie resistant housing? 
PCI and metrics. 
• PCI could provide some very useful data about 
security postures, exposures, breaches, and all 
kinds of cools stuff. 
• Could. 
• Does it? 
• Should it? 
Moving forward 
• How do we move forward? 
• Who do we have to convince? 
• What moves them?

Thank you 
Please continue the conversation, learn, engage, 
act.   
Compliance, and specifically PCI, is poised to 
steal security from those of us who care about 
it.
