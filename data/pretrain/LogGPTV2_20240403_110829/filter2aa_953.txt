### PCI: Compromising Controls and Security

#### Introduction
The topic of Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance and its impact on security is a critical one, especially in the context of events like DefCon. Compliance standards are reshaping how companies approach security, affecting all stakeholders, including hackers, defenders, attackers, and innocent bystanders. One notable outcome is that companies often fear Qualified Security Assessors (QSAs) more than zero-day vulnerabilities.

### Discussion Points

#### PCI vs. Security
- Is PCI truly at odds with security, or can they coexist?
- Does PCI hinder advanced security practices? 
- The three-year cycle ensures timely assessments, but is this sufficient?

#### Impact of PCI
- PCI has a broad impact, even on those not directly subject to its requirements. But does it affect everyone equally?

#### Metrics and Data
- PCI could provide valuable data on security postures, exposures, and breaches.
- Does it currently do so? Should it?

### Moving Forward
- How can we progress in this area?
- Who needs to be convinced, and what will motivate them?

### Conclusion
Thank you for your attention. We encourage you to continue the conversation, learn, engage, and take action. Compliance, particularly PCI, is at risk of undermining the very security measures it aims to enforce.
