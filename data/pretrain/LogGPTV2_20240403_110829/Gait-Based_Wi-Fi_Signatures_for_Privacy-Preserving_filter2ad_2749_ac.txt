Because the non-correlative nature of the thermal noise, we
can assume x∗(k)η(t) to be suﬃciently small, and thus it can
be removed. Based on the values of the correlator function,

burst and the original signal shows the time delayed, multi-
pathed signals.
a heuristic value of half the peak correlation describes the
signature. Therefore, let Mmax be the max correlation value
and Mmax /2 be the correlation value half of the max amount.
Let max and max2 be the index associated with those values
respectively. Therefore we can deﬁne the distance of the
correlation to be S2(i) = max2 − max. The same processing
method deﬁned in Equation 17 produced the second feature
vector.
4.7 Wavelets Characterization of Signatures
This section describes use of wavelet transforms, which
characterizes signature by creating feature vector used in
classiﬁers. The continuous wavelet transforms (CWT) sum
orthonormal series, generated by wavelets, to represent the
original signal (deﬁned in Equation 19) [9].

s(t)Ψa,b)(t) =
1√

ψ

R
Where a is wavelet’s scale. b is the wavelet’s translation, ψ
is the mother wavelet, and Ψa,b is the scaled and translated
wavelet. The wavelet transform is similar to the Fourier
transform, which sums Sine waves. Suppose that the local
minimum of the signal is deﬁned as Msig. We can deﬁne
Equation 20 as the signature Equation.
Msig(t) = M (t) + B(t) + C, t ∈ (t1, t2)
(20)
Where M (t) is the minimum; B(t) is the baseline function
with zero mean; C is a constant; t deﬁnes local minimum in
the region of t1 and t2.

tures used the standard Mexican Hat wavelet for the mother
wavelet for symmetry. Because the wavelet has a zero mean
and the Mexican Hat wavelet is symmetrical (Equation 22),
the second and last term can be removed. Equation 21 is
left with just the minimum points.

4.8 Naïve Bayes Classiﬁer
This section describes using a na¨ıve Bayes classiﬁer to dis-
tinguish between persons using the feature from Section 4.7.
First the data was ﬁltered. The ﬁlter was a simple thresh-
old that removed items from the array that were close to
baseline cases. The feature points that fell outside the 10%
standard distribution were also removed, as they were arti-
facts caused by noise. The na¨ıve Bayes used two fold cross
validation upon the feature sets.
Let classes be k individuals (Ak); cross correlation (fcc(k)),
pilot tone (fpt(k)), and packet count (f(p cnt)(k)) are the ob-
served features. Thus the naive Bayes classiﬁer is deﬁned in
Equation 23, selecting the largest and closest probability
given the observations.

5. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
This section discusses the empirical implementation to
measure the two features. The challenge addressed is setting
up a repeatable realistic test environment, producing a visu-
alization demonstrating diﬀerentiation, and then producing
a statistical description of diﬀerentiation. Section 5.1 dis-
cusses the control or the baseline cases, showing noise rejec-
tion. Section 5.2 shows the 12 signatures obtained from the
experiment. Section 5.3 discusses location and multipathed
physical layer channel encoding using empirical data. Sec-
tion 5.4 demonstrates the signature as distinguishable.
To simulate a clinic in which individuals with diﬀerent age
ranges and sexes visited, we selected seven diﬀerent individ-
uals. The individuals selected were three males and three
females. Their ages range from teens to 60s. Depending
on the individual, the entire walk path lasted between 7-
13 seconds. Based on the packet count, recorded time, and
start location, the location of the individual was recorded
throughout the experiment.
Seven individuals walked in the middle hallway and in
a room for about ﬁve meters, repeating this action several
times. For the NLoS case, the horn antenna was placed
in a diﬀerent room, 0.5 meters away from the wall, while
577Figure 14: Human signatures of seven individuals walked repeatedly multiple times (shown in colors) demonstrated stability
and uniqueness. Based on elapsed time, location markers for 2 and 5 meters (shown in red and green highlights) demonstrate
localization. Person 1 was male, age 29. Person 2 was female, age 26. Person 3 was male, age 49. Person 4 was female, age
59. Person 5 was male, age 19. Person 6 was female, age 15. Person 7 was male, age 21.
578Figure 15: Signatures of one individual in ﬁve locations demonstrate that the signatures are stable and location dependent in
NLoS case. These graphs provide empirical evidence that the signatures are encoded by room conﬁguration and human gait.
The reason for the diﬀerent signatures at diﬀerent locations is that multipath channel varies from location to location.
579individuals passed by repeatedly. The broadcasting omni-
directional antenna was placed in the center of the room
(NLoS) or hallway (LoS), and the receiving horn antenna
was placed at an approximate height of 1.5 meters at the
end of the hallway or room facing the test subjects. For the
LoS case, the signal capture happened in a hallway, where
the individuals were walking repeatedly in front of the horn
antenna. The test subjects were told to walk as naturally
and consistently as possible. The TX was placed in the room
or hallway, simulating a Wi-Fi deployment using a 100 ms
beacon from an omnidirectional antenna. The RF acqui-
sition was aligned to the start and stop times, such that
recorded time determined the location of the individuals.
5.1 Baseline: Control Case Signature
The challenge addressed in this section is the stability of
the baseline signature with no movement. The control case
was a hallway of an oﬃce and room devoid of movement.
As expected, both signatures remained ﬂat, because there
was no movement to cause Doppler shift or multipathing
(Figure 16).
Figure 16: LoS (black) and NLoS (red) ﬂat baselines demon-
strate multipath and Doppler features with no movement.
5.2 Repeatability and Uniqueness
The experiments demonstrated the uniqueness and re-
peatability of the signature. Seven individuals walked the
same area at least ﬁve times. The signature graphs’ dif-
ferent colored lines, in each line-of-sight and behind-wall
cases, show that the structures of the graphs are similar and
make good signatures. Figure 14 shows the signatures from
seven individuals in both LoS and NLoS cases. These sig-
nature graphs demonstrated that the signatures are unique
for each person and repeatable. Signatures for the persons
are dependent on the antennas’ locations and room conﬁgu-
ration, which, if changed, would require recalibration due to
new signatures. However in most homes, we can reasonably
assume that furniture movement happens infrequently. In
most Wi-Fi network deployments, router locations remain
ﬁxed.
5.3 Location Signature Uniqueness
Figure 15 shows unique signatures for the same person at
ﬁve diﬀerent locations in NLoS. The signature was acquired
from multiple locations in the same room. The antenna was
placed at varying heights, ranging from one to three meters
from the ground, at various angles. Based on the signa-
tures, we can reasonably conclude that the signatures are
encoded by the location and room conﬁguration. Wobly can
safely preserve privacy by encoding multipath and Doppler
Eﬀect from gaits and room conﬁgurations. Diﬀerent an-
tenna placements and room conﬁgurations cause diﬀerent
multipath channels, and thus produce diﬀerent signatures.
