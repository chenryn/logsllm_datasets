Welcome to the flick boot2root!
- Where is the flag?
- What do you need to flick to find it?
Completing "flick" will require some sound
thinking, good enumeration skills & time! The
objective is to find and read the flag that
lives /root/
As a bonus, can you get root command execution?
Shoutout to @barrebas & @TheColonial for testing
it out first :)
$ sha1sum flick.ova

Good Luck!
