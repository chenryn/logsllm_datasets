Server Clock, Current User, and Options Dropdown
The server clock is shown to the right of the bar gauges, along with the currently logged-in user’s name and the options dropdown.
The server clock displays the Logger server’s system time. This may be different from the user’s local time. Click the down-arrow by the user name to access the Options, Help, About, and Logout links.Micro Focus Logger (7.0.1) 	Page 62 of 74
Installation and Configuration Guide
The Options Page
The Options page allows to admin rights users to set the range on the EPS In and EPS Out bar gauges. If the event rate exceeds the specified maximum, the range is automatically increased.
From here, you can Upload a logo (.png file) and replace the ArcSight Logger logo with your custom logo. The logo must be in .png format. The recommended size is 175x50pixeles and the maximum file size is 1MB.Additionally, you can set the default start page (home page) for all users and specific start pages for individual users here. The start page is the user interface page Logger displays when a user logs in. 
 Logout
Click the Logout link on any page to return to the Login screen. Logging out is good security practice, to eliminate the chance of unauthorized use of an unattended Logger session. Logger automatically logs you out after a user-configurable length of time (15 minutes by default). For more information on how to update the logout time, see the .Micro Focus Logger (7.0.1) 	Page 63 of 74

Summary
The Summary page is a global dashboard that provides summarized event information about your Logger in one screen. It enables you to gauge incoming events activity and the status of indexing.
DashboardsDashboards
Dashboards are an all-in-one view of the Logger information of interest. You can assemble various search queries that match events of interest to you, status of Logger components such as receivers, forwarders, storage, CPU, and disk, or a combination of both on a single dashboard.Each Dashboard contains one or more panels of these types: Search Results and Monitor. The Search Results panels display events that match the query associated with the panel. The Monitor panels display the real-time and historical status of various Logger components such as receivers, forwarders, storage, CPU, and disk. 
For more details about Dashboards, refer to the  .
Micro Focus Logger (7.0.1) 	Page 64 of 74Chapter 9: Searching for Events
Once Logger has stored events from heterogeneous sources on your network, you can search through those events for a wide array of uses such as unsuccessful login attempts, the number of events by source, SSH authentications. Additionally, you might want to include matching events in a report, or forward events to another system such as ArcSight  ESM.You need to create queries to search for events. Queries can be as simple as a term to match, such as “login” or an IP address; or they can be more complex, such as events that include multiple IP addresses, ports, and occurred between specific time ranges from devices that belong to a specific device group.Searching through stored events is very simple and intuitive on Logger. It uses a flow-based search language that allows you to specify multiple search commands in a pipeline format. In addition, you can customize the display of search results, view search results as charts, and so on.
Example Queries
Simple query examples:
l error
l sourceAddress=192.0.2.0
l hostA.companyxyz.com
Complex query example:Complex query example:
_storageGroup IN ["Default Storage Group"] _deviceGroup IN ["192.168.22.120 
[TCPC]"] name="*[4924TestAlert]*" AND ("192.168.*" OR categoryBehavior 
CONTAINS Stop) | REGEX=":\d31" | cef name deviceEventCategory | chart _count 
by name
Syntax of a Query
A Logger search query contains one or more of the following types of expressions:
Query Element 	DescriptionQuery Element 	Description
Keyword expression 	A keyword: a word expressed in plain text; for example:
warning 
 failed
 login
Micro Focus Logger (7.0.1) 	Page 65 of 74
Installation and Configuration Guide
Query Element 	Description
Field-based expression 	A field-based expression: searching for values in the fields of an event. This includes searches for 
uncommon values in specific fields; for example:name="failed login"
 message!="failed login"
 sourceAddress=192.0.2.0
Search operator 	A search operator expression: an expression that uses search operators to refine the data that 
expression 	matches the expressions specified by the keyword and the field-based expression.
The following search operators are available in Logger 7.0.1: 
cef, chart, dedup, eval, extract, fields, head, keys, rare,regex, rename, replace, rex, sort, tail, top, transaction, where
Extraction operator 	The rex search operator is useful for syslog events (raw or unstructured data) or if you want to 
expression 	extract information from a specific point in an event, such as the 15th character in an event.
For example, to extract an IP address from the following event:
[Thu Jul 30 01:20:06 2009] [error] [client 69.63.180.245] PHPWarning: Can't connect to 10.4.31.4:11211 
and assign it to a field called “IP_Address”, use the following rex expression:
| rex "(?\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3})"
Implied field extraction operator You can specify the event fields directly in queries; for example:.
To display search results of the count of unique values device addresses in a chart form:
failed | chart _count by deviceAddressfailed | chart _count by deviceAddress
To display search results of the most common values for the deviceAddress field in table form. 
That is, the values are listed in order from the highest number of matches to the lowest.
failed | top deviceAddress
For detailed usage and examples of the search expressions, refer to the  .
Building a Query
When you build a query, you must specify the following elements:l Query Expression: the search conditions to use when selecting or rejecting an event.
l Time range: the time range within which to search.
l Field Set: the fields of an event to display for matching events; for example, you can select to display 
only the deviceAddress and deviceReceiptTime fields of matching events.
In addition, you can also include constraints that limit the search to specific device groups and storagegroups. For more information about specifying constraints, refer to the ArcSight Logger Administrator’s 
Guide.
Micro Focus Logger (7.0.1) 	Page 66 of 74
Installation and Configuration Guide
l A Storage Group enables you associate a retention policy with it. Therefore, by defining multiple storage 	groups, you can store events for different periods of time.l A Device Group enables you to categorize devices of your choice into a group. You can associate a device group to a storage rule that defines in which storage group events from a specific device group are stored. 
Run a Query
To run a query:
1. Click Analyze > Classic Search. 
2. Specify the query expression in the Search text box. 3. Select the time range and (optionally) the field set. 4. Click Go.Tip: If your receive syntax error when running a query, ensure that the syntax of the query 
follows the requirements specified in the “Syntax Reference for Query Expression” section of the 
ArcSight Logger Administrator’s Guide.
Query Building Tools
Logger offers the following tools to assist you in building queries that are complex:
l Search BuilderThe Search Builder tool is a Boolean-logic conditions editor that enables you to build search queries quickly and accurately. The tool provides a visual representation of the conditions you are including in a query. You can specify keywords, field-based conditions, and regular expressions using this tool. In addition, the tool enables you to specify search constraints such as device groups and storage groups. Click Advanced Search below the Search text box to access this tool. For information about how to use this tool, refer to the ArcSight Logger Administrator’s Guide.Micro Focus Logger (7.0.1) 	Page 67 of 74
Installation and Configuration Guide
l Regex Helper
Creating a regular expression for the rex extraction operator can be complex and error prone. The Regex Helper tool enables you to create regular expressions to use with the rex pipeline operator to extract fields of interest from an event. This tool not only simplifies the task of creating regular expressions for the rex operator but also makes it efficient and error free. For details about this tool, refer to the ArcSight Logger Administrator’s Guide.l Search Helper
Search Helper is a search-specific utility that provides the following features:
oSearch History: Displays the recently run queries on Logger, thus enabling you to select and reuse 	previously run queries without typing them again.
oSearch Operator History: Displays the fields used previously with the search operator you have 	entered in the Search text box.oExamples: Lists examples relevant to the latest query operator you entered.
oSuggested Next Operators: List of operators that generally follow the current query. For example, if 	you type logger, the operators that often follow are rex, extract, or regex. 
oHelp: Provides context-sensitive help for the last-listed operator in your query.oList of Fields and Operators: Depending on the query you enter, Logger displays either a 	complete list of fields that possibly match the field name you are typing, or a list of available operators.
Exporting Search Results
You can export search results in these formats:
Micro Focus Logger (7.0.1) 	Page 68 of 74
Installation and Configuration GuideInstallation and Configuration Guide
l PDF: Useful in generating a quick report of the search results. The report includes a table of search results and any charts generated for the results. Both raw and CEF events can be included in the exported report.
l Comma-separated values (CSV) file: Useful for further analysis with other software applications. The 	report includes a table of search results. Charts cannot be included in this format.To export search results:
1. Run a search query.
2. Click Export Results. ()
Saving Queries for Later Use
If you need to run the same query regularly, you can save it in two ways: 
l Saved filter: Save the query expression, but not the time range or field set information. 
l Saved search: Save the query expression and the time range.
For more information about saving queries and using them again, refer to the ArcSight Logger Administrator’s Guide.System Filters (Predefined Filters)
Your Logger ships with a number of predefined filters, also known as system filters. These filters define queries for commonly searched events such as unsuccessful login attempts or the number of events by source.
Micro Focus Logger (7.0.1) 	Page 69 of 74
Installation and Configuration Guide
To use a system filter:
1. Click Analyze > Classic Search.1. Click Analyze > Classic Search.
2. Click the Load a Saved Filter icon () to view a list of all system filters.
3. Click Load+Close.
Tuning Search Performance
Search performance depends on many factors and will vary from query to query. Some  factors that can affect search performance are listed below. 
To optimize search performance, ensure that you follow these recommendations:l Take advantage of super indexes where possible, for the fastest search results. Refer to the ArcSight 	Logger Administrator’s Guide for more information on how to search super-indexed fields.l The amount of time it takes to search depends on the size of the data set that must be searched, the 	complexity of the query, and whether the search is distributed across peers. To limit the data set, ensure 	that time range you specify does not result in a query that needs to scan multimillions of events. l Limiting search to specific storage groups or peers typically results in better search performance than 	when the storage groups or peers are not specified.l Reduce the load on the system when your query needs to run, for example, scheduled jobs, running

multiple reports, or large number of incoming events. 
Tip: Full-text indexing and Field-based indexing for a recommended set of fields are automatically 
enabled at Logger initialization time. In addition to these fields, Micro Focus strongly recommendsthat you index fields that you will be using in search and report queries. Refer to the 
ArcSightLogger Administrator’s Guide for more information on indexing fields.
Micro Focus Logger (7.0.1) Page 71 of 74
Example Queries 
This section provides a few example queries that you can use on Logger. These queries assume that your Logger is receiving and storing events. You can also modify these queries to suit your needs.Tip: To form a rex expression, use the Regex Helper tool available on your Logger. For details about 
the Regex Helper tool, refer to the ArcSight Logger Administrator’s Guide.
l Extract the IP address from any event that contains the word “failed” and show the top IP addresses: 	failed | rex “(?[^ ]\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3})” | top 	 
l Extract the network ID from an IP address:The IP address is captured by the first rex expression and the network ID (assuming the first three 	bytes of the IP address represent it) to which the IP address belongs is extracted from the captured IP 	address: 
	error | rex “(?[^ ]\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3})” | rex 	field=src_ip “(?\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3})”l Extract all URLs from events and generate a chart of the URL counts, excluding blank URLs: 	http | rex “http://(?[^ ]*)” | where customURL is not null | 	chart _count by customURL | sort - _count 
l Extract the first word after the word “user” (one space after the word) or “user=”: 
	The word “user” is case-insensitive in this case and must be preceded by a space character. That is, 	words such as “ruser” and “suser” should not be matched.user | rex “\s[u|U][s|S][e|E][r|R][\s|=](?[^ ]*)” | chart _ count by CustomUser

Other Logger Features
In addition to the Logger features highlighted in this guide, Logger provides many other features. This section provides an overview of some of those features. For an in-depth understanding and how to use Logger, refer to the ArcSight Logger Administrator’s Guide and ArcSight Logger Web Services API Guide.Scheduling Tasks
You can configure Logger to run jobs such as Configuration Backup, Event Archive, File Transfers, and Saved Searches on recurring basis. 
Archiving Events
Event Archives let you save the events for any day in the past, not including the current day. The archive location can be a local directory or a mount point that you have already established on the system on which Logger software is installed. You can also schedule a daily archive of the events.  Archives are indexed at the creation; this will enable searches on archived events to be as fast as searches in live storage.Access Control on Logger Users
You can create users with different access privileges on Logger. For example, you create Joe with only Logger search privileges and give Jane Logger search and administration capabilities.
Enriching Data Through Static CorrelationThe Lookup feature enables you to augment data in Logger with data from an external file, and display this data in the Search results. This enables geo-tagging, asset tagging, user identification, and so on, through static correlation. For example, if you want the search results to include which country source IP addresses are located in, you can create a file listing the IP addresses and countries and then upload that file to Logger as a Lookup file. After that, you can use the lookup search operator to correlate the sourceAddress field in the events and the IP address column in the Lookup file, and display the country in the search results.Web Services
Logger includes SOAP and REST web services that you can use to integrate Logger functionality in your own applications. For example, you will be able to create programs that execute searches on stored Logger events or run Logger reports, and feed them back to your third-party system. Refer to the Logger Web Services API guide for more information on this feature.Micro Focus Logger (7.0.1) 	Page 73 of 74
