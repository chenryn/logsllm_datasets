# Installation and Configuration Guide

## Real-Time Alerts and Saved Search Alerts

For saved search alerts, the specified start and end times must fall within the defined time range. You can also use dynamic time ranges (e.g., `$Now-1d`, `$Now`, etc.).

### Example
- **Start Time:** 5/11/2016 10:38:04
- **End Time:** 5/12/2016 10:38:04
- **Match Count:** 5
- **Threshold:** 3600 seconds (1 hour)

An alert will trigger if five or more events occur within any one-hour period between May 11th, 2016, 10:38:04 a.m. and May 12th, 2016, 10:38:04 a.m.

### Configuring Alerts
Refer to the ArcSight Logger Administrator’s Guide for detailed instructions on creating both real-time and saved search alerts.

## Chapter 8: Overview of the Logger User Interface

This section provides a high-level view of the Logger User Interface, with an emphasis on the Search interface. For more information and additional user interface options, refer to the "Navigating the User Interface" section.

### Navigation and Information Band
A navigation and information band runs across the top of every page in the user interface. It includes:
- Menu tabs
- Quick navigation field
- Events gauges
- System clock
- Options, Help, About, and Logout menu

The bar gauges at the top of the screen provide an indication of throughput and CPU usage, which are available in more detail on the Monitor Dashboard (refer to "Dashboards" on page 64). The name of the logged-in user is displayed below the clock, to the right of the gauges.

### Take Me To
To the right of the menu tabs, the "Take me to..." navigation box allows quick and easy navigation to any location in the user interface (UI). This feature enables you to navigate to any Logger feature by typing its name. Access the "Take me to..." navigation box by clicking it or using the hot keys `Alt+o`, `Alt+p`, or `Ctrl+Shift+o`. Type a word to display a dropdown list of matching results. Use the arrow keys to select an option and press `Enter` to navigate.

**Note:** You can open the online help for your current UI page by typing "help" in the "Take me to..." search box.

### Server Clock, Current User, and Options Dropdown
- **Server Clock:** Displays the Logger server's system time, which may differ from the user's local time.
- **Current User:** The name of the currently logged-in user is shown to the right of the bar gauges.
- **Options Dropdown:** Click the down-arrow by the user name to access the Options, Help, About, and Logout links.

### The Options Page
The Options page allows administrators to set the range on the EPS In and EPS Out bar gauges. If the event rate exceeds the specified maximum, the range is automatically increased.

From this page, you can:
- Upload a custom logo (in .png format, recommended size: 175x50 pixels, maximum file size: 1MB).
- Set the default start page (home page) for all users and specific start pages for individual users.

### Logout
Click the Logout link on any page to return to the Login screen. Logging out is a good security practice to prevent unauthorized use of an unattended Logger session. Logger automatically logs you out after a user-configurable length of time (default: 15 minutes). For more information on how to update the logout time, refer to the ArcSight Logger Administrator’s Guide.

---

## Summary
The Summary page is a global dashboard that provides summarized event information about your Logger in one screen. It enables you to gauge incoming events activity and the status of indexing.

### Dashboards
Dashboards offer an all-in-one view of Logger information. You can assemble various search queries to match events of interest, status of Logger components such as receivers, forwarders, storage, CPU, and disk, or a combination of both on a single dashboard. Each Dashboard contains one or more panels of these types:
- **Search Results:** Display events that match the query associated with the panel.
- **Monitor:** Display the real-time and historical status of various Logger components.

For more details about Dashboards, refer to the ArcSight Logger Administrator’s Guide.

## Chapter 9: Searching for Events

Once Logger has stored events from heterogeneous sources on your network, you can search through those events for various uses such as unsuccessful login attempts, the number of events by source, SSH authentications, and more. You need to create queries to search for events. Queries can be simple, such as a term to match, or complex, involving multiple IP addresses, ports, and specific time ranges.

### Example Queries
- **Simple Query Examples:**
  - `error`
  - `sourceAddress=192.0.2.0`
  - `hostA.companyxyz.com`

- **Complex Query Example:**
  ```plaintext
  _storageGroup IN ["Default Storage Group"] 
  _deviceGroup IN ["192.168.22.120 [TCPC]"] 
  name="*[4924TestAlert]*" AND ("192.168.*" OR categoryBehavior CONTAINS Stop) 
  | REGEX=":\d31" 
  | cef name deviceEventCategory 
  | chart _count by name
  ```

### Syntax of a Query
A Logger search query contains one or more of the following types of expressions:
- **Keyword Expression:** A keyword expressed in plain text (e.g., `warning`, `failed`, `login`).
- **Field-Based Expression:** Searches for values in the fields of an event (e.g., `name="failed login"`, `message!="failed login"`, `sourceAddress=192.0.2.0`).
- **Search Operator Expression:** Uses search operators to refine the data that matches the expressions specified by the keyword and the field-based expression. Available search operators in Logger 7.0.1 include `cef`, `chart`, `dedup`, `eval`, `extract`, `fields`, `head`, `keys`, `rare`, `regex`, `rename`, `replace`, `rex`, `sort`, `tail`, `top`, `transaction`, and `where`.

### Extraction Operator
The `rex` search operator is useful for extracting information from specific points in an event, such as the 15th character in an event.

**Example:**
```plaintext
[Thu Jul 30 01:20:06 2009] [error] [client 69.63.180.245] PHPWarning: Can't connect to 10.4.31.4:11211
| rex "(?\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3})"
```
This extracts an IP address and assigns it to a field called `IP_Address`.

### Building a Query
When building a query, you must specify:
- **Query Expression:** The search conditions to use when selecting or rejecting an event.
- **Time Range:** The time range within which to search.
- **Field Set:** The fields of an event to display for matching events.

You can also include constraints that limit the search to specific device groups and storage groups. For more information, refer to the ArcSight Logger Administrator’s Guide.

### Run a Query
1. Click **Analyze > Classic Search**.
2. Specify the query expression in the Search text box.
3. Select the time range and (optionally) the field set.
4. Click **Go**.

**Tip:** If you receive a syntax error when running a query, ensure that the syntax follows the requirements specified in the "Syntax Reference for Query Expression" section of the ArcSight Logger Administrator’s Guide.

### Query Building Tools
Logger offers the following tools to assist in building complex queries:
- **Search Builder:** A Boolean-logic conditions editor that enables you to build search queries quickly and accurately.
- **Regex Helper:** Simplifies the task of creating regular expressions for the `rex` pipeline operator.
- **Search Helper:** Provides features such as Search History, Search Operator History, Examples, Suggested Next Operators, and context-sensitive help.

### Exporting Search Results
You can export search results in the following formats:
- **PDF:** Useful for generating a quick report of the search results, including a table of search results and any charts generated.
- **Comma-separated values (CSV) file:** Useful for further analysis with other software applications. Charts cannot be included in this format.

To export search results:
1. Run a search query.
2. Click **Export Results**.

### Saving Queries for Later Use
If you need to run the same query regularly, you can save it in two ways:
- **Saved Filter:** Save the query expression but not the time range or field set information.
- **Saved Search:** Save the query expression and the time range.

For more information, refer to the ArcSight Logger Administrator’s Guide.

### System Filters (Predefined Filters)
Your Logger ships with predefined filters that define queries for commonly searched events such as unsuccessful login attempts or the number of events by source.

To use a system filter:
1. Click **Analyze > Classic Search**.
2. Click the **Load a Saved Filter** icon to view a list of all system filters.
3. Click **Load + Close**.

### Tuning Search Performance
Search performance depends on several factors. To optimize search performance:
- Take advantage of super indexes where possible.
- Limit the data set by specifying a reasonable time range.
- Limit searches to specific storage groups or peers.
- Reduce the load on the system when your query needs to run.

**Tip:** Full-text indexing and field-based indexing for a recommended set of fields are automatically enabled at Logger initialization time. Micro Focus strongly recommends indexing fields used in search and report queries.

### Example Queries
- **Extract the IP address from any event that contains the word "failed" and show the top IP addresses:**
  ```plaintext
  failed | rex “(?[^ ]\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3})” | top
  ```
- **Extract the network ID from an IP address:**
  ```plaintext
  error | rex “(?[^ ]\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3})” | rex field=src_ip “(?\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3})”
  ```
- **Extract all URLs from events and generate a chart of the URL counts, excluding blank URLs:**
  ```plaintext
  http | rex “http://(?[^ ]*)” | where customURL is not null | chart _count by customURL | sort - _count
  ```
- **Extract the first word after the word "user" (one space after the word) or "user=":**
  ```plaintext
  user | rex “\s[u|U][s|S][e|E][r|R][\s|=](?[^ ]*)” | chart _count by CustomUser
  ```

### Other Logger Features
- **Scheduling Tasks:** Configure Logger to run jobs such as Configuration Backup, Event Archive, File Transfers, and Saved Searches on a recurring basis.
- **Archiving Events:** Save events for any day in the past, not including the current day. Archives are indexed for fast searching.
- **Access Control on Logger Users:** Create users with different access privileges.
- **Enriching Data Through Static Correlation:** Use the Lookup feature to augment data in Logger with data from an external file.
- **Web Services:** Integrate Logger functionality into your own applications using SOAP and REST web services.
