User: How to configure LVM storage management on a Linux server, and perform operations such as capacity expansion and formatting?
Assistant: LVM is a storage management solution that can perform operations such as logical volume division, dynamic expansion, and data migration on a group of hard disks without hardware RAID support, so as to improve the elasticity and reliability of the storage system. The following are detailed steps for configuring LVM storage management on a Linux server, and performing operations such as capacity expansion and formatting: Step 1. Prepare hard disks. When installing the system, create a partition on each disk, and the partition type is "Linux LVM ". You can view disk and partition information with the following command: fdisk -l Step 2. Install the LVM package Most Linux distributions include the LVM package in the default installation. If you are using a Debian-based distribution (such as Ubuntu), you need to install it manually: sudo apt-get install lvm2 Step 3. Create a physical volume Convert each partition to a physical volume (PV): sudo pvcreate /dev/sdb1 Among them, /dev/sdb1 is the name of the partition to be used as a physical volume. You can use the following command to view the physical volume information: sudo pvdisplay Step 4. Create a volume group to form multiple physical volumes into a volume group (VG): sudo vgcreate my_vg /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1 Wherein, my_vg is the name of the volume group, / dev/sdb1 and /dev/sdc1 are the names of the physical volumes to be added to the volume group. You can use the following command to view the volume group information: sudo vgdisplay Step 5. Create a logical volume Create a logical volume (LV) from the volume group: sudo lvcreate -L 10G -n my_lv my_vg Among them, the -L option specifies the size of the logical volume, and my_lv is Logical volume name, my_vg is the volume group name. You can use the following command to view the logical volume information: sudo lvdisplay Step 6. Format the file system to format the logical volume: sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/my_vg/my_lv Among them, /dev/my_vg/my_lv is the device node name of the logical volume . Step 7. Mount the file system Mount the logical volume to the directory of the file system: sudo mkdir /data sudo mount /dev/my_vg/my_lv /data Among them, /data is the mount directory. You can view the mount information with the following command: df -h Step 8. Expand the logical volume If you need to expand the size of the logical volume, you first need to expand the size of the physical volume, and then expand the logical volume. Expand the size of the physical volume: sudo pvresize /dev/sdb1 Among them, /dev/sdb1 is the name of the physical volume to be expanded. You can view the physical volume information through the following command: sudo pvdisplay Then expand the size of the logical volume: sudo lvextend -L +5G /dev/my_vg/my_lv Among them, the -L option specifies the size to be increased, and +5G means to increase the size by 5GB. /dev/my_vg/my_lv is the device node name of the logical volume to be expanded. You can use the following command to view the logical volume information: sudo lvdisplay Step 9. After adjusting the file system to expand the logical volume, the file system does not automatically expand. The file system size needs to be adjusted manually: sudo resize2fs /dev/my_vg/my_lv Among them, /dev/my_vg/my_lv is the device node name of the logical volume to be adjusted. Step 10. Unmount the file system Before adjusting the file system, you need to unmount the file system: sudo umount /data Step 11. After adjusting the size of the file system, remount the file system: sudo mount /dev/my_vg/my_lv /data Step 12. Check the logical volume space to check whether there is free space in the logical volume space: sudo lvdisplay /dev/my_vg/my_lv to determine whether it is necessary to increase the number of sectors when expanding the disk. In general: ``` disk partition -> physical volume (PV) -> volume group (VG) -> logical volume (LV) -> format file system -> mount expansion logical volume: expand the size of the physical volume -> Expand the size of the logical volume -> Adjust the file system -> Unmount the file system -> Perform the adjustment operation```
