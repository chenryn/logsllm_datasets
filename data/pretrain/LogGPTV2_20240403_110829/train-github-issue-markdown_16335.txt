Reporting a bug

**What is the current behavior?**  
The React Developer Tools do not appear in the Chrome Developer Tools.

**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and, if possible, a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will be resolved more quickly if we can run your code and it does not have dependencies other than React. Please paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**

1. Download and install the latest version of the React Developer Tools Chrome extension.
2. Visit https://reactjs.org.
3. Open the Chrome Developer Tools (F12 or right-click and select "Inspect").

**What is the expected behavior?**  
The React tab should appear in the Chrome Developer Tools.

**Which versions of React, and which browser/OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**

- React: N/A
- Browser: Google Chrome 77.0.3865.75
- OS: Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS (Bionic Beaver)

This worked in previous versions of Chrome and the Chrome extension, but I am unsure when exactly the bug surfaced, as I haven't used it in a while.

Thank you in advance for any help. React is awesome! :smiley:
