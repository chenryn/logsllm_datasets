**What is the current behavior?**  
React dev tools don't appear in chrome dev tools
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and
if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster
if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React.
Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or
CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**  
Download latest chrome extension and go to https://reactjs.org, open dev tools
**What is the expected behavior?**  
React dev tools tab should appear in chrome
**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?
Did this work in previous versions of React?**
React: N/A
    ▶ lsb_release -a
    No LSB modules are available.
    Distributor ID: Ubuntu
    Description:    Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS
    Release:        18.04
    Codename:       bionic
    ▶ google-chrome --version
    Google Chrome 77.0.3865.75
This worked in previous versions of chrome/chrome extension, but I'm not sure
when exactly the bug surfaced, since I haven't used it in a while.
Thanks in advance for any help, React is awesome :)
