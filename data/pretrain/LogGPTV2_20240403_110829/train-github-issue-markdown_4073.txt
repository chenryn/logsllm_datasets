The build section of the user docs says:
> Compilers
>
> To build any extension modules for Python, you'll need a C compiler. Various
> NumPy modules use FORTRAN 77 libraries, so you'll also need a FORTRAN 77
> compiler installed.
This is incorrect, and inconsistent with the instructions in the main install
file, which state:
> Fortran compiler isn't needed to build Numpy itself; the numpy.f2py tests
> will be skipped when running the test suite if no Fortran compiler is
> available. For building Scipy a Fortran compiler is needed though, so we
> include some details on Fortran compilers in the rest of this section.
The former is probably a remnant of the old scipy docs.
I'm happy to submit a fix, but it would be good to know how folks want to deal
with the duplication of those files. As long as that information is carried in
two duplicate locations, problems of divergence will keep reappearing. Ideally
there should be only one location to describe the source build process.
