Certainly! Here is a more polished and coherent version of your text:

The "Build" section of the user documentation states:
> **Compilers**
>
> To build any extension modules for Python, you will need a C compiler. Additionally, various NumPy modules use FORTRAN 77 libraries, so you will also need a FORTRAN 77 compiler installed.

This information is incorrect and inconsistent with the instructions in the main installation file, which state:
> A Fortran compiler is not required to build NumPy itself. If no Fortran compiler is available, the `numpy.f2py` tests will be skipped when running the test suite. However, a Fortran compiler is necessary for building SciPy. Therefore, we include details on Fortran compilers in the rest of this section.

The former statement is likely a remnant from the old SciPy documentation.

I am willing to submit a fix, but it would be helpful to know how the team prefers to handle the duplication of these files. As long as this information is maintained in two separate locations, issues of divergence will continue to arise. Ideally, there should be a single, authoritative location for describing the source build process.
