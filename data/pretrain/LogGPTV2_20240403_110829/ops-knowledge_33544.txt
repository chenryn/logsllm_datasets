User: How to set up SSH access on a Linux server for remote management of the server?
Assistant: To set up SSH access for remote management of a Linux server, follow these steps: 1. Make sure the SSH service is installed In most Linux distributions, the SSH service is usually pre-installed. You can confirm that the SSH service is installed by running the following command on the server terminal: ``` sudo systemctl status sshd ``` If the SSH service is installed, you should see some output about the status of the SSH service. If the SSH service is not installed, you can run the following commands on the server to install the SSH service: ``` sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install openssh-server ``` 2. Setting up SSH access By default, SSH access is All users and IP addresses are open. If you want to restrict SSH access to specific users or IP addresses, please follow the steps below: a. Edit the SSH configuration file Run the following command on the server terminal to open the SSH configuration file: ``` sudo nano /etc/ssh/ sshd_config ``` b. Restricting access To restrict SSH access, you can use the following options: - AllowUsers: Allow access only to specific users - AllowGroups: Allow access only to specific user groups - DenyUsers: Block specific user access - DenyGroups: Block specific user groups Access - ListenAddress: Allow access only from specific IP addresses. For example, if you only want to allow user john to access the server, you can add the following line: ``` AllowUsers john ``` Or, if you only want to allow access from IP address 192.168.1.100 To host access to the server, you can add the following line: ``` ListenAddress 192.168.1.100 ``` c. Saving and closing the file When you are done modifying, use the "CTRL+X" keys to save and close the file. d. Restart the SSH service Run the following command on the server terminal to restart the SSH service: ``` sudo systemctl restart sshd ``` Now, SSH access has been restricted to allow only specific users or IP addresses to access your server.
