**ATT&CK ID:** M1037  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Filter Network Traffic

To effectively filter network traffic, consider leveraging services provided by Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) or specialized providers that focus on mitigating Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. These services can help filter traffic upstream from your services, reducing the load on your infrastructure.

Additionally, implement boundary traffic filtering by:
- Blocking source IP addresses that are originating the attack.
- Blocking ports that are being targeted by the attack.
- Blocking protocols that are being used for malicious transport.

By combining these strategies, you can significantly enhance your network's resilience against DoS and other similar attacks.
