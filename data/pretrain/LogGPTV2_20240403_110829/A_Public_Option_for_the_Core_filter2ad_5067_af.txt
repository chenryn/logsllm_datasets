neutrality focus on service differentiation, whereas we only consider
termination fees. We view termination fees as the most fundamental
violation of network neutrality, whereas (as mentioned earlier) of-
fering different qualities of service, if done on an open basis with
posted prices, is a very different matter which we do not address
(and take no stand against).
In addition, there are concerns that ex ante network neutrality
regulation (i.e., regulations imposed before significant violations
occur) might interfere with the Internet‚Äôs evolution [20]. Because
we do not take a hard stance against QoS, we are not limiting future
design choices, only specific revenue mechanisms. Moreover, once
termination fees start being imposed it will be hard to claw them
back, so ex ante regulation seems to be exactly what is called for.
Also, it has sometimes been argued that the last mile provider
needs to share (via termination fees) in the profits of the content
provider to maintain adequate bandwidth. But this argument neglects
two important points. First, such termination fees can be applied
even in the absence of bandwidth needs, so the solution (termination
fees) seems ill-suited to solve this particular problem (incentives for
bandwidth expansion). Second, the last mile provider can, even in
the presence of network neutrality, charge its consumer for the traffic
volume. See [40] for recent work that establishes how better adapted
pricing policies by the last mile providers can substantially improve
the usage of broadband networks.
At a more detailed level, two significant ways we differ from the
existing literature is that (i) we do not model CSP-CSP or ISP-ISP
competition at all (as opposed to, for example, [6]); and (ii) we
model the CSP-ISP interaction as a Nash bargaining problem rather
than as a non-cooperative game with a Nash equilibrium (which
is the dominant approach in the literature). The former decision is
because Nash equilibria of toy models of the CSP and ISP markets
often depend on small details in the modeling, and thus are not
sufficiently representative; moreover, we don‚Äôt see such competition
as changing the essence of our results here (though it may change the
values of the parameters ùëüùë†
ùëô ). For the latter decision about modeling
CSP-ISP interactions via NBS, the closest paper to ours in this spirit
is [1] but in that work the bargaining power was given exogenously,
where here it was derived from the nature of the disagreement point.
5 Are We Crazy?
We end by considering two questions.
Is major change needed? The problems we are addressing all stem
from a single cause: the Internet was not designed with a business
model in mind. The peering practices that emerged from the early
days of the commercial Internet were never able to produce revenue
flows that were tightly tied to the way value is delivered and cost is
incurred in the modern Internet. The resulting debate about network
neutrality was doomed to intellectual failure, because it operated
within a model where value and revenue would always be somewhat
disconnected. We approached this problem more fundamentally by
asking how could we redesign the infrastructure so that the value
and revenue chains could be cleanly aligned.
The motivation for our approach is quite simple. Today‚Äôs large
ISPs combine the tasks of transit and last-mile-delivery, and often
play the role of both CSP and ISP. There is no way the Internet‚Äôs
current transitive method of passing on traffic and recouping cost
could possible encompass this kind of complexity. Our alternative is
to cleanly separate transit and last-mile-delivery, and then have the
LMPs and CSPs turn directly to their own customers to recoup costs
and extract revenue from the value delivered.
We are proposing this as the fundamental economic architecture
of the Internet, one that we think can continue to apply even under
massive changes in the services provided, the content shared, and
the resulting costs incurred.
Is such a change possible? We first note that while the POC is
radically different from the status quo, it is incrementally deployable.
We are not engaging in clean-slate fantasies here, but instead hoping
that a radically different way of structuring the Internet could start
off almost as a demonstration project, and then grow over time into a
true alternative that competes with the current Internet infrastructure.
If more and more LMPs find the POC attractive (and the success of
IXPs in Europe suggest that this is not farfetched) then over time the
POC can have a substantial impact on the Internet.
But does the POC have a chance of becoming real? From a straight
business perspective, it is a dubious proposition, since it would
take years to gain the confidence of LMPs, who would be risking
their own financial future on the fate of the POC. However, there
is another strong force at work here, one that is captured in the
phrase ‚ÄúCommoditize Your Complement‚Äù. This is a strategy first
identified by Joel Spolsky [50] that we now briefly explain. In today‚Äôs
technology marketplace, delivering value to consumers typically
requires several different products to work together: for instance,
displaying a movie on a phone requires the mobile device itself,
the cellular infrastructure, the Internet infrastructure, and the movie
service. All these products are complements of each other. Spolsky‚Äôs
insight [50] was simple: ‚ÄúDemand for a product increases when
the prices of its complements decrease.‚Äù Simply put, a consumer is
willing to pay a certain amount to watch movies on her phone; as
the other components of this process become cheaper the remaining
components can charge more.
Currently the ISPs and the CSPs are complements of each other
in a hugely lucrative business, and the network neutrality debates
are nothing more than an argument about how to share the proceeds.
The POC would be a way for the CSPs to commoditize the ISP
market, by explicitly turning transit into a nonprofit and creating a
competitive market in LMPs. As such, the success of the POC would
be extremely valuable to the large CSPs. They could easily provide
the initial set of leased links, along with some guarantees for the
POC‚Äôs longevity, which would supply the much-needed credibility.
While this does not answer the question about our sanity, we hope
it provides some hope for the Internet‚Äôs future stability.
