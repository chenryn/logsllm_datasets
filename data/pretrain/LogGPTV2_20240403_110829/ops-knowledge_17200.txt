I have been using the `dnspython` module in Python. However, I encountered an issue when trying to use it on a new Linux installation. The module is not being loaded, even after attempting to clean up and reinstall.

### Details

- **Python Version:**
  ```bash
  $ python --version
  Python 2.7.3
  ```

- **Installation Attempt:**
  ```bash
  $ sudo pip install dnspython
  Downloading/unpacking dnspython
    Downloading dnspython-1.11.1.zip (220Kb): 220Kb downloaded
    Running setup.py egg_info for package dnspython

  Installing collected packages: dnspython
    Running setup.py install for dnspython

  Successfully installed dnspython
  Cleaning up...
  ```

- **Verification:**
  ```bash
  $ python
  Python 2.7.3 (default, Sep 26 2013, 20:03:06) 
  [GCC 4.6.3] on linux2
  Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
  >>> import dns
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "", line 1, in 
  ImportError: No module named dns
  ```

### Additional Information

- **Python and Pip Versions:**
  ```bash
  $ which python
  /usr/bin/python
  $ python --version
  Python 2.7.3
  $ pip --version
  pip 1.0 from /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages (python 2.7)
  ```

- **Firewall Consideration:**
  I have a firewall installed on the new machine. Although I am not certain if it should affect the import, I have tried disabling it, but the issue persists.

### Potential Cause and Solution

In my case, I had a file named `dns.py` in the same directory as my script. This caused a naming conflict with the `dnspython` package. Renaming the script file resolved the issue.

Thank you for your assistance.
