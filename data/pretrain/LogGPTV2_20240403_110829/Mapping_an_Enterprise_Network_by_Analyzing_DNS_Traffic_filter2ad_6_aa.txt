**Abstract:**
Enterprise networks are becoming increasingly complex and dynamic, making it challenging for network administrators to track all potential cyber attack exposures. We present an automated method to identify and classify organizational assets by analyzing just 0.1% of the enterprise traffic volume, specifically DNS packets. By examining live, real-time streams of DNS traffic from two organizations (a large university and a mid-sized government research institute), we:
- Highlight differences in DNS query and response patterns between recursive resolvers, authoritative name servers, web-servers, and regular clients.
- Identify key attributes that can be efficiently extracted in real-time.
- Develop an unsupervised machine learning model to classify enterprise assets.

Our method was applied to 10 Gbps live traffic streams from the two organizations, yielding results verified by their respective IT departments and revealing new insights. This demonstrates the value of our automated system for mapping and tracking enterprise assets.

## 1. Introduction
Enterprise networks are not only large, with many thousands of connected devices, but also highly dynamic. Hosts, web-servers, DNS resolvers, and name servers are frequently added or removed to adapt to changing organizational needs. Currently, IT departments manually track these assets using spreadsheets and configuration files, which is cumbersome, error-prone, and difficult to keep up-to-date. Consequently, many network administrators are unaware of their internal assets, leading to an increased attack surface.

This problem is particularly acute in university and research institute campus networks due to:
- The presence of sensitive and valuable data, including intellectual property, research datasets, social security numbers, and financial information.
- An open-access culture, decentralized control, and federated access to data, making them vulnerable to unauthorized access, unsafe internet usage, and malware.
- High-speed network infrastructure, making them attractive targets for volumetric reflection attacks.

In this paper, we develop an automated method to map internal hosts of an enterprise network by focusing on DNS traffic, which:
- Is a key signaling protocol carrying valuable information and bypassing firewalls easily.
- Constitutes a tiny fraction of total network traffic (less than 0.1%).
- Can be easily captured with a few flow entries in an OpenFlow-based SDN switch.

By capturing and analyzing DNS traffic, we dynamically and continually identify DNS resolvers, name-servers, public-facing servers, and regular client hosts. This helps network administrators track changes in host roles and configure appropriate security measures, such as protecting DNS resolvers from unsolicited responses and authoritative name servers from amplification requests.

## 2. Profiling Enterprise Hosts
In this section, we analyze the characteristics of DNS traffic collected from the border of two enterprise networks: a large university campus (UNSW) and a medium-sized research institute (CSIRO). The IT departments of both enterprises provided a full mirror (both inbound and outbound) of their Internet traffic (each on a 10 Gbps interface) to our data collection system. Appropriate ethics clearances were obtained for this study. We extracted DNS packets in real-time by configuring rules for incoming/outgoing IPv4 UDP packets for port 53 on an SDN switch. The study considers data collected over one week, from May 3 to May 9, 2018.

### 2.1 DNS Behavior of Enterprise Hosts
Enterprises typically operate two types of DNS servers:
- **Recursive Resolvers:** These act on behalf of end-hosts to resolve the network address of a URL and return the answer. They commonly cache positive responses to reduce frequent recursion.
- **Authoritative Servers:** These receive queries from anywhere on the Internet for the network address of a sub-domain within the zone they are authoritative for.

To better understand the DNS behavior of various hosts, we divide the DNS dataset into two categories:
- Outgoing DNS queries from enterprise hosts and incoming DNS responses.
- Incoming DNS queries from external hosts and outgoing DNS responses.

This analysis helps us identify important attributes related to host DNS behavior, characterizing their type and function, such as authoritative name server, recursive resolver, generic public-facing server, or end-host inside the enterprise.

#### Outgoing Queries and Incoming Responses
Figure 1 shows a time trace of DNS outgoing queries and incoming responses for the university campus, with a moving average over 1-minute intervals on a typical weekday. The university network handles an average of 353 outgoing queries and 308 incoming responses per second. We found that 17.28% of outgoing queries are unanswered, and 5.24% of incoming responses are unsolicited. A similar pattern, with lower numbers, is observed in the research institute network, which experiences approximately double the amount of unanswered queries and unsolicited responses compared to the university network.

#### Query per Host
The majority of outgoing DNS queries are generated by two primary recursive resolvers in both networks, accounting for 68% of the total in the university campus and 82% in the research institute. Additionally, we observe a number of secondary recursive resolvers and end-hosts configured to use public DNS resolvers.

#### Response per Host
A larger number of "other" hosts in both organizations are observed, with most being the destinations of unsolicited responses. Figure 3(a) shows the CCDF of total unsolicited incoming responses per host over a day for the university campus. The primary recursive resolvers in both organizations are top targets, receiving a significant portion of unsolicited responses.

#### Incoming DNS Queries
Enterprises commonly receive DNS queries from the Internet addressed to their authoritative name servers. We observed that a large number of hosts in both organizations receive queries from the Internet, but a significant majority of these queries are unanswered. These hosts are not supposed to receive queries, indicating potential security issues.
