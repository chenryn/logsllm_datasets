User: For a complex application system, please build an end-to-end performance monitoring and debugging system.
Assistant: To build an end-to-end performance monitoring and debugging system, the following aspects need to be considered: 1. Select appropriate monitoring tools and technologies: a combination of multiple tools and technologies can be used, such as application performance management (APM), log analysis , network analysis, and infrastructure monitoring. Commonly used technologies include JMX, Rizhiyi, etc. 2. Set monitoring indicators and alarm thresholds: It is necessary to set key indicators and alarm thresholds in the monitoring system, so that when abnormalities occur, alarms can be issued in time and debugging can be carried out. 3. Integrate monitoring system with application system: By integrating monitoring tools in application code, data about application performance, real-time and historical data, and some other important information can be collected. 4. Analyze and optimize application performance: By analyzing the continuously collected performance data, application bottlenecks and problems can be found, and then optimized and improved. 5. Use visualization tools to display performance data: By using visualization tools, such as dashboards, charts, or visual maps, you can better display application performance data and improve the efficiency and accuracy of diagnosing problems. To sum up, building an end-to-end performance monitoring and debugging system needs to consider many factors, and it cannot be done overnight. It needs to comprehensively consider the actual application scenarios and requirements for selection and adjustment.
