**Migrated issue, originally created by Maik Riechert (@letmaik)**
    mybool = Column(Boolean, nullable=False, default=False)
I use PostgreSQL which has a native boolean type. If I then also use naming
convention:
    "ck": "ck_%(table_name)s_%(constraint_name)s",
Then sqlalchemy complains:
sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError: Naming convention including
%(constraint_name)s token requires that constraint is explicitly named.
If I define the column as
    isPublic = Column(Boolean(create_constraint=False), nullable=False, default=False)
it works, so I think this is a bug in which sqlalchemy doesn't connect the
fact that there is a native Boolean and no constraint exists actually.
