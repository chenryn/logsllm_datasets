APPENDIX B
MODELING INTER-ORGANIZATIONAL HIERARCHY
We used the IP preﬁx allocation database [49] and con-
structed the tree formed by IP-preﬁx assignments to orga-
nizations, we refer to it as the preﬁx allocation tree. We

include?

tree. In particular, we identiﬁed the owners of all preﬁxes that
are announced in BGP (since those are associated with an
AS number). We thus believe that our measurements provide
a good approximation as to the extent of inter-organizational
dependencies.
Next, we identify the owners of ROAs. We use the AS
numbers speciﬁed in ROAs to indicate which ASes are al-
lowed to announce the protected IP preﬁxes, and the mapping
from ASes to organizations in [12], to identify the owner
organizations. Finally, we ﬁnd the owners of RCs. The RPKI
speciﬁcation [38] does not identify the owner in the RC, to
get around this we use a combination of our preﬁx and ROA
mappings. If the RC was used to issue a ROA, we assign the
owner of the ROA to that RC. Otherwise, we use the owner
of the largest preﬁx speciﬁed in this RC.
B. Measuring upward dependencies
For each preﬁx in the allocation tree, we ﬁnd the ﬁrst
“ancestor IP preﬁx” that is covered by an RC. Importantly,
the owner of this preﬁx is the one who must ﬁrst issue an
RC to its descendant (and the owner of that descendant to
its descendant, until reaching the original preﬁx). We then
ﬁnd the number of intermediate IP preﬁxes in the allocation
tree, i.e., preﬁxes that must be covered by RCs before the
original preﬁx may be covered by RC. Finally, we count the
distinct organizations on the path between the preﬁx and its
ancestor preﬁx, excluding the organization owning the original
preﬁx and the organization owning the ancestor preﬁx. We
thus quantify the number of organizations that lie between an
organization that wishes to issue a ROA and the organization
that must initiate the chain of RC issuing.
C. Measuring downward dependencies
For each preﬁx in the allocation tree, we ﬁnd the number
of preﬁxes below it (i.e., subpreﬁxes) that are announced in
BGP and are not protected by ROAs. These “child preﬁxes”
will be considered invalid by the routers that perform ROV if
the parent is issued a ROA. We count the number of distinct
organizations that own them.
Fig. 23: Survey. Where is your network?
obtain the RCs and ROAs using Miro, a tool developed by
Reuter et al. [48]. The datasets are from July 2016. From
each RIR we root an RPKI-object tree that illustrates the RC
and ROA hierarchy (i.e., which RC was used to issue other
RCs or ROAs). Each vertex in both trees identiﬁes the owner
organization as we next describe.
A. How to map preﬁxes, RCs, and ROAs to their owners?
To understand RPKI’s deployment status we must be able
map IP preﬁxes, ROAs, and RCs, to the organizations that
“own” them. This turns out to be a nontrivial feat.
We begin by ﬁnding the owner of the preﬁxes in the
allocation tree. We use Route Views [54] to ﬁnd preﬁxes
advertised through BGP, and identify their owner by the AS
number that advertised the preﬁx (using CAIDA’s ASN to
organization mapping [12]). For all other preﬁxes, which are
owned by organizations yet unannounced through BGP, we use
the Whois databases of the ﬁve RIRs [2], [3], [4], [6], [7] to
identify the owner. We further use the “contact e-mail address”
domain, commonly included in Whois entries, to match IP-
preﬁxes owned by the same organization. In case we could
not identify the owner of the preﬁx, we assume that the parent
organization still owns that IP space and remove that preﬁx
from the IP allocation tree. We were able to identify the owners
of 92.3% of the preﬁxes, whereas almost all the preﬁxes we
could not resolve to an owner are leaves in the preﬁx allocation
