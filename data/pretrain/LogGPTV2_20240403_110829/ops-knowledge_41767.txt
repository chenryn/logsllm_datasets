User: How to configure Nginx server to support HTTPS? What issues need attention?
Assistant: To configure the Nginx server to support HTTPS, you need to perform the following steps: 1. Obtain an SSL certificate: You need to obtain an SSL certificate from a trusted certificate authority (CA) in order to install it on the Nginx server. You can buy an SSL certificate or use a free SSL certificate such as Let's Encrypt. 2. Install the certificate: Install the SSL certificate on the server. Typically, certificate files are stored in the server's /etc/ssl directory. You need to store both certificate and key files in this directory. 3. Configure the Nginx server: Modify the Nginx configuration file to support HTTPS. Open the /etc/nginx/sites-available/default file and add the following line to the configuration file: ``` server { listen 443 ssl; server_name your.domain.com; ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/yourdomain.crt; ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/yourdomain.key; ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:10m; ssl_session_timeout 5m; ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on; ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2; AESGCM:AES256+EECDH:AES256+ EDH'; } ``` In the configuration file example above, you need to replace your.domain.com with your domain name. You also need to substitute the path and name of the certificate file. 4. Restart Nginx: You need to restart the Nginx server for the configuration file to take effect. Type the following command in the terminal: ``` sudo systemctl restart nginx ``` In addition, you need to pay attention to the following points: - HTTPS requires SSL encrypted communication. Therefore, you need to ensure that the communication between the client and server is encrypted. - HTTPS uses port 443. Unlike HTTP, HTTPS communicates using the encrypted SSL protocol, so a different default port needs to be used. - If you are using CDN, HTTPS communication between CDN server and Nginx server is required. In this case, you need to ensure that your CDN supports HTTPS, and properly configure the Nginx server to accept HTTPS requests. - Although both HTTP and HTTPS use the same infrastructure for requests and responses, the response headers may differ. Therefore, you need to ensure that the response headers are set correctly to support HTTPS.
