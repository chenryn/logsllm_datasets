allocate / deallocate

- No need to model the POSIX API!
- Otherwise real(istic) programs.

- No filesystem -> no flag?
- CGC Quals: crash == exploit
- CGC Finals: two types of exploits
1. "flag overwrite": set a register to X, crash at Y
2. "flag read": leak the "secret flag" from memory

The DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge
The CGC Final Event (CFE)
• The competition is divided in rounds (96), with short 
breaks between rounds
• The competition begins: The system provides a set of  
Challenge Binaries (CBs) to the teams’ CRSs
– Each CB provides a service (e.g., an HTTP server)
– Initially, all teams are running the same binaries to implement 
each service
• For each round, a score for each (team, service) tuple is 
generated
The CGC Final Event (CFE)
• Availability: how badly did you fuck up the binary?
• Security: did you defend against all exploits?
• Evaluation: how many n00bs did you pwn?
• When you are shooting blindfolded automatic 
weapons, it’s easy to shoot yourself in the foot…
Code Freeze?

Object-relational model for database:
- What CS are fielded this round?
- Do we have crashes?
- Do we have a good patch?
- ...
Our ground truth and the only
component reasonably well tested*
* 69% coverage

Fuzzing
• Fuzzing is an automated procedure to send inputs and 
record safety condition violations as crashes
– Assumption: crashes are potentially exploitable
• Several dimensions in the fuzzing space
– How to supply inputs to the program under test?
– How to generate inputs?
– How to generate more “relevant” crashes?
– How to change inputs between runs?
• Goal: maximized effectiveness of the process
