Conclusion
Summary of the Contributions
In this thesis, we presented a new public-key encryption that satisﬁes a strong security no-
tion, which prevents many users to collude and perform complex, large-scale attacks. Our
construction, which appeared in [GHKW16], was the ﬁrst CCA-secure encryption scheme with
a tight security reduction from the DDH assumption, without using pairings. It also has short
ciphertexts (they only contain three group elements). Figure 1.1 gives the state of the art for
tightly CCA-secure encryption.
Our proof techniques depart from the long line of prior works [HJ12, LJYP14, LPJY15] that
uses non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs with tight simulation soundness, for which we have
no eﬃcient construction from standard assumptions without pairings. Other works [HKS15,
AHY15a, GCD+16] ﬁrst build a tightly-secure IBE to then obtain CCA-secure encryption.
However, IBE is notoriously hard to build without pairings in the standard model [BPR+08],
let alone with a tight security proof and short ciphertexts. To get rid of the pairings, we revisit
techniques from [CW13] together with the hash-proof system approach used in [CS98].
We address the major limitation of our construction in [GHK17], where the size of the
public key is reduced to a constant number of group elements, using techniques from [Hof17].
We chose to only present the predecessor [GHKW16] here.
We also presented new functional encryption schemes from standard assumptions. We
followed a bottom-up approach, where we explored new constructions for larger classes of
functions, with new features, starting from simple constructions, that rely on well-understood
assumptions. Namely, we extended the original functional encryption schemes for inner prod-
ucts from [ABDP15, ALS16] to a multi-input setting:
• in Chapter 4, we present a multi-input functional encryption scheme (MIFE) for inner
products based on the MDDH assumption in prime-order bilinear groups. Our construc-
tion works for any polynomial number of encryption slots and achieves adaptive security
against unbounded collusion, while relying on standard polynomial hardness assump-
tions. Prior to this work, which was published in [AGRW17], we did not even have a
candidate for 3-slot MIFE for inner products in the generic bilinear group model. Our
work is also the ﬁrst MIFE scheme for a non-trivial functionality based on standard
cryptographic assumptions, as well as the ﬁrst to achieve polynomial security loss for
a super-constant number of slots under falsiﬁable assumptions. Prior works required
stronger non-standard assumptions such as indistinguishability obfuscation or multilin-
ear maps. The construction presented in Chapter 4 improves upon [AGRW17] in that
security handles corruption of input slots, with no additional eﬃciency cost or extra
assumption.
• in Chapter 5, we present constructions of multi-input functional encryption (MIFE)
157

Chapter 8. Conclusion
schemes for the inner-product functionality that improve those from Chapter 4 in two
main directions.
First, we put forward a novel methodology to convert single-input functional encryption
for inner products into multi-input schemes for the same functionality. Our transforma-
tion is surprisingly simple, general and eﬃcient. In particular, it does not require pairings
and it can be instantiated with all known single-input schemes. This leads to two main
advances. First, we enlarge the set of assumptions this primitive can be based on, no-
tably, obtaining new MIFEs for inner products from plain DDH, LWE, and Decisional
Composite Residuosity. Second, we obtain the ﬁrst MIFE schemes from standard as-
sumptions where decryption works eﬃciently even for messages of super-polynomial size.
This work appeared in [ACF+18]. As for the pairing-based MIFE presented in Chapter 4,
the novelty of the work presented in Chapter 5 of this thesis is that its security handles
corruptions of input slots.
Then, we turned our attention to multi-client functional encryption for inner products,
which enhances multi-input functional encryption in the following way. In MCFE, the encryp-
tion algorithm takes as an additional input a label (typically a time-stamp), and ciphertexts
from diﬀerent input slots can only be combined when they are encrypted under the same label.
This limits the leakage of information from the encrypted messages. Multi-input functional
encryption corresponds to the case where every message is encrypted under the same label.
In Chapter 6, we give the ﬁrst MCFE for inner products from standard assumptions,
namely, bilinear groups. We ﬁrst give a simple construction whose security is based on the De-
cisional Diﬃe Hellman assumption in the random oracle model, which only satisﬁes a somewhat
weak security model. This construction appeared in [CDG+18a].
Then, we give several transformations to strengthen security, using a new primitive that we
called Secret Sharing Encapsulation; and an extra layer of single-input functional encryption on
top of the original scheme. The resulting scheme is fully secure, and relies on bilinear groups,
in the random oracle model. We also show a generic way to decentralize the generation of the
functional decryption keys, and the setup of the scheme. These can be performed independently
by all users, without interaction. We obtain a multi-client functional encryption where there is
no need for trusted authority holding any master secret key. These transformations appeared
in [CDG+18b].
Finally, in Chapter 7, we give the ﬁrst functional encryption that supports the evaluation
of degree-2 polynomials on encrypted data, from standard assumptions. This work appeared
in [BCFG17]. The ciphertexts are succinct: their size only depends linearly on the encrypted
message, and not the functions for which functional decryption keys are generated. This is as
far as it goes in terms of functional encryption beyond predicate encryption, for constant de-
gree polynomials, from standard assumptions. Recall that in [LT17], it is shown that succinct
functional encryption which supports the evaluation of degree-3 polynomials on encrypted data
already implies indistinguishability obfuscation (together with the existence of block-wise 3-
local PRG), a powerful tool that has surprisingly many applications in cryptography, including
solving long standing open problems (see [SW14]). Unfortunately, there is no known construc-
tion of such functional encryption (with unbounded collusion) from standard assumptions.
Open Problems
Tight security. Can we exhibit tight security reduction for more advanced encryption
schemes, such as attribute-based encryption, or functional encryption? Even though tightly
secure identity-based encryption are known [CW13, HKS15, AHY15a, GCD+16], all of these
schemes have a large public key (it contains Ω(λ) group elements, where λ denotes the security
parameter), or rely on composite-order pairings [CGW17], which are less eﬃcient than their
prime-order counterpart. Current techniques, such as adaptive partitioning from [Hof17], have
8.2 Open Problems
159
thus far been unsuccessful at providing a tightly-secure IBE with compact ciphertexts and
public key, in the prime-order setting.
More generally, we believe bridging the gap between currently known attacks against cryp-
tographic schemes and their security proof is a fruitful research agenda. Finding tighter se-
curity reductions is one way to bridge that gap, by ruling out more attacks than traditional,
asymptotic security reductions. Another approach consists of ﬁnding explicit attacks against
particular cryptosystems that match as much as possible the security proof. As far as we know,
there are no known attacks against concrete public-key encryption schemes which make use of
the fact that the security reduction is not tight. This deserves to be investigated.
Interesting open problems include building functional encryption

that supports the evaluation of degree-2 polynomials on encrypted data with large messages.
Current constructions [BCFG17, DGP18] crucially rely on the use of pairings, which only allows
decryption to recover the value in the exponent of a group element. Since correctness involves
solving a discrete logarithm in this group, we require the size of the message to be bounded
by a polynomial in the security parameter (note that discrete logarithm should be hard to
compute for large values, for the security of the scheme). Because they would probably require
radically new techniques, and most likely avoid the use of pairings, such functional encryption
with large messages would be much insightful.
Besides, exploring larger classes of functions from standard assumptions, in particular get-
ting degree-3 succinct functional encryption from standard assumptions (and thereby, indis-
tinguishability obfuscation, given the result of [LT17]) would be a breakthrough.
On the more practical side, mitigating the reliance on trusted third party (which holds
a master secret key) would increase the practical relevance of functional encryption. Decen-
tralized multi-client functional encryption goes into that direction. We hope this work will
inspire further research following the same approach for other classes of functions, or predicate
encryption.
