User: I understand that if you want to include external packages you have to include them in your project. So I was wondering how do you do this? 
Do people use one general script that auto imports them from a location. Maybe some kind of config file that lists all the external packages? Do you always zip the packages and use zipimporter?
Anway, I guess I am looking for a good general strategy for import external packages. I learned some already from looking at source code but extra info/examples would be super.
Assistant: Just place the package's folder in the root directory of your GAE application, easy!
