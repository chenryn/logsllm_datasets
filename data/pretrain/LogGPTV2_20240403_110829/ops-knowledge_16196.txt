User: Please describe the architectural principles of Kubernetes container clusters, including the roles and relationships of Master nodes, Node nodes, Pods, and Services.
Assistant: The architectural principle of the Kubernetes container cluster is a distributed system, which consists of Master nodes and Node nodes. The Master node is responsible for managing and controlling the state of the entire cluster, while the Node nodes run applications and are responsible for managing containers. The master node consists of three main components: the first is the API server, which is responsible for exposing the cluster API and allowing developers to operate on the cluster; the second is the controller manager, which is responsible for managing the state of all controllers and ensuring that the cluster The state of the container in is always as expected; the third is the scheduler, which is responsible for picking the right node for each new Pod on the Node node. Node nodes are working nodes in the Kubernetes cluster. They consist of two main components: the first is kubelet, which is responsible for managing containers and Pods on the node; the second is kube-proxy, which manages network and service discovery in the cluster . Pod is the smallest deployment unit of Kubernetes, which represents a group of containers that share the same network space and code environment on the same node. A Pod can contain one or more Containers, which can share filesystem, network, and other resources. In a Kubernetes cluster, Service is an abstract logical concept that represents a set of Pods and their access methods. A Service can expose a single Pod's port, or multiple Pods' ports, and bundle them together to provide load balancing and service discovery within the cluster. Service can also be configured to read/write data volumes in the Kubernetes cluster, and provide reliable service discovery and load balancing for Pods.
