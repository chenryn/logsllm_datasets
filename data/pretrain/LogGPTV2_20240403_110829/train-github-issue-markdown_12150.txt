When I open the Samples tab in data table, it show "No results" even though
the row counter shows that there are rows available to display and inspection
of the request in the console shows that data was fetched.  
I think the bug might have been introduced in PR #16299 \- it uses columns
from chart query to display data tables Results and Samples, even though
Samples might (and usually does) have different columns than Results. It will
actually show only those columns from Samples query that are present in
current chart query.
#### How to reproduce the bug
  1. Open a chart, for example 'Games per Genre over time'
  2. Go to Samples tab
  3. It shows only "Genre" column, even though there are many more available.
### Expected results
All columns of Samples query should be displayed in data table
### Actual results
Only columns that are present in both Samples query and current chart query
are displayed in Samples data table.
