Question: When designing an application that handles sensitive data, such as user credentials or financial information, which of the following data types and practices should be preferred to minimize the exposure of sensitive data in memory?
"A": "Utilize immutable data types like `String` or `BigInteger` to store sensitive information as they are secure by default.",
"B": "Centralize the handling of sensitive data using primitive, mutable data structures like `byte[]` and `char[]` and overwrite them with dummy data after use.",
"C": "Rely on `StringBuffer` and `StringBuilder` for modifying sensitive data and ensure the buffer is not copied when it exceeds capacity.",
"D": "Use third-party services and SDKs without review since they are commonly equipped to handle sensitive data securely."
Answer: B
