### Introduction
- **Why This Talk?**
  - The cloud is a hot topic, but it's often dismissed as "nothing new" or "same old, same old."
  - We need to focus on the real issues and not get sidetracked by semantics.

- **What Exactly *Is* the Cloud?**
  - The cloud encompasses various delivery models, including Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).

### Why Break the Cloud?
- **It Will Be Where the Action Is**
  - The cloud is becoming a critical part of many organizations' IT strategies.
  - There are concerns about the dark side of cloud computing, such as security vulnerabilities.
  - We are repeating some of the same security mistakes, but we don't have to.

### Drivers of Cloud Adoption
- **Management by In-Flight Magazine**
  - Managers and geeks alike are influenced by media and industry trends.
- **Poor History from IT**
  - Past failures in IT management are driving the search for more efficient solutions.
- **Economic Factors**
  - Cost savings are more attractive during economic downturns.
  - Cloud computing allows for a shift from Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) to Operational Expenditure (OPEX).
  - Private clouds are also gaining attention.

- **Attractive Options**
  - Services like Amazon EC2 are highly appealing due to their flexibility and scalability.

### Challenges in Testing the Cloud
- **Transparency**
  - Lack of transparency in cloud services can be a significant issue.
- **Compliance in the Cloud**
  - Regulatory compliance is a major concern. For non-regulated data, exploration is feasible, but regulated data requires more caution.
  - Tim Mather, RSA Security Strategist, notes that there is a lack of comfort with putting sensitive/regulated data in the cloud.

- **Privacy and Legal Issues**
  - Jim Dempsey from the Center for Democracy and Technology warns of the loss of 4th Amendment protection for US companies.
  - Legal orders can be used to obtain data without notifying the user.
  - There is no legal obligation to inform users when their data has been accessed.

- **Simple Solution: Crypto Pixie Dust!**
  - Encryption is often proposed as a solution, but trusting encryption on a potentially compromised system is risky.

- **Vendor Lock-in**
  - Vendor lock-in can be a significant problem. If the relationship with the cloud provider ends, how do you regain access to your data?

- **Availability**
  - Even large providers can experience downtime.
  - Issues like account lockout and "malicious activity from your account" can affect availability.

- **Monoculture**
  - Monocultures of networked computers are susceptible to attacks.
  - SmugMug, a heavy AWS user, exemplifies the risks associated with a monoculture environment.

- **Extending Your Attack Surface**
  - Moving to the cloud can increase the attack surface, making it easier for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities.

- **Phishing and Trust**
  - Phishing attacks can be more effective in a cloud environment where trust is a key factor.

- **Cloud Failures**
  - Examples of cloud failures include MediaMax Online Storage, Nokia Ovi, and Salesforce, which highlight the potential risks.

- **Trust and Red Herrings**
  - Trust is essential, but it must be balanced with vigilance. Just as you trust Microsoft not to backdoor your OS, you must trust cloud providers not to compromise your data.

- **Web Application Security**
  - Using the cloud for security testing, such as Dino Dai Zovi's Debian key generation and Ben Nagy's MS Office fuzzing, can be both effective and cost-efficient.

- **Case Studies**
  - **DDZ vs. Debian**: Generating RSA keys using 20 VMs on EC2.
  - **Zynamics && DMolnar**: Using EC2 for malware classification and fuzz testing.

- **Players in the Cloud Market**
  - Overview of key players in the cloud market and the services they offer.

- **Autoscaling and Usage Costing**
  - Autoscaling is a valuable feature, but it can also introduce new security risks.

- **Storage as a Service**
  - Simple model, but it comes with its own set of challenges, including security and accessibility.

- **Amazon EC2 Secure Wiping**
  - Ensuring secure data wiping is crucial, especially in a cloud environment.

- **Brute Force Attacks**
  - Brute force attacks on password reset links, such as those found in SugarSync, highlight the importance of strong security measures.

- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**
  - Salesforce is an example of both SaaS and PaaS, with a robust platform for developers and architects.

- **Salesforce Backstory**
  - Salesforce started as a web-based CRM software and has grown into a major player in the cloud market, offering both SaaS and PaaS solutions.

- **Business Model**
  - Salesforce's business model is built on providing scalable, flexible, and secure cloud solutions to a wide range of customers.
