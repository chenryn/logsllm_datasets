Introduction
The Semi-Security State of Compliance
• Overview of Compliance Benefits and 
Standards
• Things Compliance Gets Wrong
• Detrimental effects of Compliance
Compliance Benefits
• Old, hard-to-sell controls finally being 
implemented
• Standardization of common controls
• Credentials for lazy people who don’t want to 
work or go to school (OK, so that’s not a 
benefit…)
Compliance Standards
• COBIT
• PCI DSS
• HIPAA
Compliance Standards (Cont)
• GLBA
• SOX
• ISO
• ITAF
The Psychological Impact of 
Compliance on the Enterprise
• False Senses of Security
• Misinterpretations of concepts
• Budgetary and Resource Shifting and 
Mayhem
• The “Pass the Audit” vs. “Secure the Systems” 
Paradox
Compliance brings us a new 
fingerprinting foundation
• Standards == Defined Attack Matrix
– Passwords (length, complexity, age, etc), Data 
Retention, Encryption Standards, Focal Points
• Data retention
– What data is known to exist before it is even found
• Configuration Management
– Workstation, Server, Data Centers, Infrastructures
• Policy
– Policy-level weaknesses and vulnerabilities
Other Standardizations
• Encryption requirements
– standard algorithms
• No time wasted forcing non-compliant algorithms
– sensitive data flagging
• Encryption flags the “juicy stuff”
– Key management
Compliance is the Self-Devouring 
Serpent
• Misrepresented/Misinterpreted Postures
• Conflict of Interests
• Governance Hypocrisies
• "Secure" vs. "Passing Audit" paradox
• Things you may not have known about 
compliance boards
The Anti-Progression Trap
• Compliancy can lock organizations into “old” 
technologies and architectures
– Requiring Firewalls where emerging concepts 
don’t call for one
– “Anti-virus is Dead”
Notes on the "Risk Bandwagon"
• Definition
• A new mentality is evolving
– Knowing the enemy before you know who it is
