### Subnet-Centric Approach versus Ground-Truth in Figure 3(a)
The subnet-centric algorithm effectively captures at least 90% of the ground truth vertices and edges while using less than 60% of the full probing load required by the ground-truth method.

### 4.2 Interface Set Cover
Next, we evaluate the performance of the Interface Set Cover (ISC) algorithm, excluding the "change-driven" logic (§3.2). Specifically, we focus on how ISC compares to full trace set cover, the degradation of performance over time as the topology changes, and comparative load metrics.

For these experiments, we randomly selected 20,000 routed IP destinations. Each day over a two-week period, we probed the same set of destinations from the same vantage point. The results from the first probing cycle were used to "train" both the full set cover and ISC. Figure 4(a) shows the fraction of missing interfaces for each set cover technique relative to the interfaces discovered from the full set of traces in that cycle.

After one day, the full trace set cover misses less than 1% of the interfaces, while ISC misses approximately 2%. However, the full trace set cover uses about 60% of the ground-truth probing load, whereas ISC uses less than 20%, resulting in significant savings. Note that this comparison excludes the last hop (the destination). If the destination were included, and considering that only one vantage point traces to a given destination (as with Ark), the full trace set cover would yield no savings.

Over time, the performance of both set cover techniques degrades, with ISC degrading faster to 7% missing interfaces relative to the ground truth after 11 cycles. Therefore, while set cover techniques can significantly reduce probe traffic, they are insufficient alone due to changing topologies. To address this, we augment ISC with "change-driven" logic. We expect that the substantial savings in probe traffic with ISC, compared to full traces, will outweigh the additional probing needed to detect deviations (new and absent interfaces) from the previous cycle.

### 4.3 Vantage Point Influence
To understand how to assign destinations to vantage points, we conducted a tightly controlled experiment where 2,000 randomly selected destinations were each probed from 38 different vantage points. Our goal was to determine whether adding more vantage points increases the discovered topology and to identify the point at which the gain diminishes. Figure 5(a) shows the average number of discovered interfaces for each probed destination as a function of the number of vantage points. The standard deviation error bars indicate that the variance in discovered interfaces increases as the number of vantage points increases. We found that up to approximately ten vantage points, the number of discovered interfaces is linear, after which the influence of additional vantage points decreases, albeit slowly. This suggests that each additional vantage point still provides significant value. This finding contrasts with earlier results [2], indicating that AS-level peering and interconnections have become richer [6].

Next, we examined vantage point spreading in the context of two other strategies: "random," which models Ark's current methodology, and "single," which uses a single vantage point to probe all /24s within a prefix. Figures 5(b) and 5(c) show the number of vertices and edges in the inferred topology using each strategy. As expected, the "single" strategy performs poorly. While the "random" assignment strategy performs well, our VP spreading algorithm achieves approximately a 6% gain in leveraging network knowledge. A reasonable goal for our primitives is to achieve substantial savings in probing traffic while attaining a rich or nearly as rich interface topology. For the latter, if we consider being within 1% of the number of discovered interfaces as with full traces, then the 6% gain in interfaces is well within the scope of concern.

Analytically, for random assignment of /24s to vantage points, and for a prefix with a mask of \( m \) (where \( k = 2^{24-m} \) /24s in the prefix), and for \( N \) vantage points, where \( k \leq N \), the probability that all \( k \) /24s are probed by a unique vantage point is:
\[ P = \prod_{i=0}^{k-1} \frac{N - i}{N} \]

Given 23 vantage points, there is only a 25% chance that the 8 /24s in a /21 would be assigned to distinct vantage points. The chance for the 16 /24s in a /20 is 0.1%. Empirically, our experiments find, on average, each of the 16 /24s in a /20 prefix is hit by approximately 12 unique vantage points when performing assignment at random.

In summary, vantage point spreading is simple and imposes no additional probing load, yet the use of additional vantage points results in a worthwhile improvement in the estimated topology.

### 5. Discussion
Reducing the number of measurements required to infer network topologies has been explored in the past, notably in DoubleTree [8]. However, our primitives are the first to exploit structural knowledge of the network to reduce measurement costs, while the ISC algorithm extends DoubleTree to the multiple-round tracing scenario.

Prior work [12] examines using externally generated and collected synthetic network coordinates to iteratively select probe destinations where the topological distance is most different from the inferred Euclidean distance. While their ultimate goal of reducing measurement cost is the same as ours, their problem formulation entails constructing efficient overlay topologies among a known set of nodes by inferring their underlay connectivity. In contrast, we leverage external network knowledge to guide the selection of destinations for topology characterization of an entire AS.

In the broader context, we view these techniques as important building blocks for a new generation of "Internet-scopes" capable of performing one complete round of probing within a day. With the substantial load savings of these primitives, our hope is to utilize the resulting probing budget gain to more completely characterize the Internet—capturing small-scale dynamics and previously hidden structure.

One challenge in combining these primitives into a single system design is that the ISC technique, by nature, has its search space constrained by historical views. To capture changes in Internet topology, the supplemental "change-driven" logic needs to be integrated into ISC and will likely need further refinement.

We also note the complementary interaction between subnet-centric probing and vantage point spreading. In isolation, vantage point spreading discovers network ingress points, while subnet-centric probing finds internal network sub-netting structure. Used together, both goals can be accomplished without exhausting probing budgets. Subnet-centric probing is used for stub networks with a limited number of ingress points, whereas vantage point spreading is designed for exploring path diversity in transit networks with many peering points but not many internal subnets. In other words, we do not need to perform subnet-centric probing per vantage point; we can use the same set of probes to accomplish both objectives by independently choosing their source and destination addresses.

Our abstraction of the narrow waist in Figure 2, and its impact on topology measurement strategy and vantage point selection, is less relevant for core networks. A top-tier network peers with other top-tiers in multiple cities and provides transit for many downstream networks. Since these interconnections often occur at inter-exchange points, the number of border router interfaces of a top-tier network, though more than for an edge network, is less than the number of its connections to other ASs. Thus, discovering the topology of a core network, for which additional vantage points are key, has less opportunity for reduction in probing than edge networks. We intend to quantify the extent of probe reduction possible in measuring core topologies in future work.

Finally, this paper targets an interface-level graph. An additional alias resolution step, with more probing, is required to reduce an interface-level graph to a router-level graph. We leave the question of how to efficiently perform alias resolution to future work.
