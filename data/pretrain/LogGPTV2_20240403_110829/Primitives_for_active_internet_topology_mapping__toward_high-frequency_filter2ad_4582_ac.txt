subnet centric approach versus the ground-truth in Figure 3(a).
The subnet centric algorithm is able to capture ≥ 90% of the
ground truth vertices and edges while using less than 60%
of the ground truth full probing load.
4.2
Interface Set Cover
Next, we examine the performance of the Interface Set
Cover algorithm, but excluding the “change driven” logic
(§3.2). In particular, we are concerned with how the perfor-
mance of ISC compares with full trace set cover, the degra-
dation of performance over time as the topology changes,
and comparative load metrics.
We select 20,000 routed IP destinations at random for
these experiments. Each day over a two-week period, we
probe the same set of destinations from the same vantage
point. The results from the ﬁrst probing cycle are used
to “train” the full set cover and ISC. Figure 4(a) show the
fraction of missing interfaces using each set cover technique
relative to the interfaces discovered from the full set of traces
in that cycle.
We see that after a single day, the full trace set cover
misses less than 1% of the interfaces while ISC misses ap-
proximately 2%. However, while the full trace set cover uses
approximately 60% of the ground-truth probing load, ISC
uses less than 20% – a huge savings. Note that for this
comparison, we omit consideration of the last hop, the des-
tination.
If the destination were included and given that
just one vantage point traces to a given destination (as is
the case with Ark), then the full trace set cover yields no
savings.
The performance of both set cover techniques degrades
over time, with ISC degrading faster to 7% interfaces missing
relative to ground-truth after 11 cycles. Thus, while set
cover techniques can provide a signiﬁcant savings in probe
traﬃc, they alone do not suﬃce, as the topology changes
over time. Thus, we augment ISC with ”change driven” logic.
Our expectation, to be tested in future experiments, is that
the substantial additional savings in probe traﬃc with ISC,
as compared with full traces, will dominate the amount of
additional probing stimulated by the discovered deviations
(new and absent interfaces) from the prior cycle.
4.3 Vantage Point Inﬂuence
To gain intuition over how to assign destinations to van-
tage points, we ﬁrst perform a tightly controlled experiment
where 2000 randomly selected destinations were each probed
from 38 diﬀerent vantage points. We wish to understand
whether adding additional vantage points to probe the same
destination increases the discovered topology, and at what
point the gain in adding additional vantage points (VPs)
diminishes. Figure 5(a) shows the average number of dis-
covered interfaces for each probed destination as a function
of the number of vantage points. In addition, the standard
deviation error bars shows that the variance in discovered
interfaces increases as the number of probing vantage points
increases. We ﬁnd that up to approximately ten vantage
points, the number of discovered interfaces is linear, after
which the inﬂuence of additional vantage points decreases.
Yet, the decrease is quite slow – suggesting again that there
is signiﬁcant value in each additional vantage point. This
ﬁnding contrasts with earlier results [2], suggesting that AS-
level peering and interconnections have become richer [6].
Next, we examine vantage point spreading in the context
of two other strategies: “random” which models Ark’s cur-
rent methodology and “single” which uses a single VP to
probe all /24’s within a preﬁx. Figures 5(b) and 5(c) show
the number of vertices and edges in the inferred topology
using each strategy. As expected, the “single” strategy per-
forms poorly. And while the “random” assignment strategy
performs well, we achieve approximately 6% gain in lever-
aging network knowledge via our VP spreading algorithm.
A reasonable goal for our primitives is substantial savings
in probing traﬃc while attaining as rich or almost as rich
interface topology. For the latter, if we consider the criterion
of being within 1% the number of discovered interfaces as
with full traces, then the above 6% gain in interfaces is well
within the scope of concern.
Analytically, for random assignment of /24’s to VPs, and
for a preﬁx with a mask of m (k = 224−m /24’s in the preﬁx),
and for N vantage points, where k ≤ N , then the probability
that all k /24’s are probed by a unique VP is:

Figure 5: Vantage Point spreading algorithm performance.
Given 23 vantage points, there is only a 25% chance that the
8 /24’s in a /21 would be assigned to distinct vantage points.
The chance for the 16 /24’s in a /20 is 0.1%. Empirically,
our experiments ﬁnd, on average, each of the 16 /24’s in
a /20 preﬁx is hit by approximately 12 unique VPs, when
performing assignment at random.
In summary, vantage
point spreading is simple and imposes no additional probing
load, and yet the resulting use of additional vantage points
attains worthwhile improvement in the estimated topology.
5. DISCUSSION
Reducing the number of measurements required to infer
network topologies has been explored in the past, notably
in DoubleTree [8]. However, our primitives are the ﬁrst to
exploit structural knowledge of the network to reduce mea-
surement cost, while the ISC algorithm is the logical exten-
sion of DoubleTree to the multiple-round tracing scenario.
Prior work [12] examines using externally generated and
collected synthetic network coordinates to iteratively select
probe destinations where the topological distance is most
diﬀerent from the inferred euclidean distance. While their
ultimate goal of reducing measurement cost is the same as
ours, their problem formulation entails constructing eﬃcient
overlay topologies among a known set of nodes by inferring
their underlay connectivity. In contrast, we leverage exter-
nal network knowledge to guide the selection of destinations
for topology characterization of an entire AS.
In the big picture, we view the preceding techniques as
important building blocks for a new generation of “Internet-
scopes” capable of performing one complete round of prob-
ing within a day. With the substantial load savings of these
primitives, our hope is to utilize the resulting probing budget
gain to more completely characterize the Internet – captur-
ing small-scale dynamics and previously hidden structure.
One challenge in combining these primitives into a single
system design is that the ISC technique, by nature, has its
search space constrained by historical views. To capture
the changes in Internet topology, the supplemental “change
driven” logic needs to be integrated into ISC and will likely
need further reﬁnement.
We also note the complimentary interaction between subnet-
centric probing and vantage point spreading. In isolation,
VP spreading probes discover the network ingress points
while subnet centric probing ﬁnds internal network subnet-
ting structure. Used together, however, both goals can be
accomplished without exhausting probing budgets. Subnet
centric probing is used for stub networks that have a limited
number of ingress points whereas vantage point spreading
is designed for exploring path diversity of transit networks
that have many peering points but not many internal sub-
nets.
In other words, we do not need to perform subnet
centric probing per vantage point; we can use the same set
of probes to accomplish both objectives, by independently
choosing their source and destination addresses.
Our abstraction of the narrow waist in Figure 2, and its
impact on topology measurement strategy and vantage point
selection, is less relevant for core networks. A top-tier net-
work peers with the other top-tiers, in multiple cities, and
provides transit for its many downstream networks. Since
these interconnections often occur at inter-exchange points,
the number of border router interfaces of a top-tier network,
though more than for an edge network, is less than the num-
ber of its connections to other AS’s. Thus, discovering the
topology of a core network, for which additional vantage
points is key, has less opportunity for reduction in probing
than does edge networks. We intend to quantify the extent
of probe reduction possible in measuring core topologies in
future work.
Finally, this paper only targets an interface-level graph.
An additional alias resolution [3] step, with more probing, is
required to reduce an interface-level graph to a router-level
graph. We leave the question of how to eﬃciently perform
alias resolution to future work.
