 **Sam Brannen** opened **SPR-6050** and commented
In the Spring TestContext Framework (i.e., specifically in
AbstractGenericContextLoader), annotation-driven autowiring is automatically
enabled. In other words, all ApplicationContexts created by subclasses of
AbstractGenericContextLoader (e.g., GenericXmlContextLoader) are automatically
configured to process annotations.
If you explicitly wish that annotation processing not be enabled for the
configuration files you specify -- for example, if some of the beans are
annotated with `@Autowired`, etc. but you do not want those beans to be
autowired -- you are at a loss: there is currently no way to disable this.
As indirectly suggested in the forum, it would be nice if Spring provided a
mechanism for disabling automatic annotation-driven autowiring in tests.
