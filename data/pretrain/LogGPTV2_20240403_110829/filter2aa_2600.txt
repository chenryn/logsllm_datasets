“Regardless of its other uses, some are worried 
by politicians using psychological profiling. Peter 
Kinderman, professor of clinical psychology at the 
University of Liverpool, notes that politicians have 
used psychological tricks throughout history. But 
if they want to use psychological profiling they 
should obtain informed consent, as scientific 
researchers and clinicians are required to do. 
‘They should be honest and we should be 
aware.’”
