# Summary of the new feature/enhancement
Allow mapping the Windows key alone as the shortcut key for PowerTools Run,
disabling the windows start menu launch, but still allowing the windows combo
shortcuts (WIN+L, WIN+1, WIN+TAB etc) to work. One can still access the start
menu or it's search by clicking with mouse.
Reason: I would like to replace the traditional windows menu/search with this
instead.
