    what you did to
    reproduce the problem.  Thanks.
    What steps will reproduce the problem?
    1. Checkout the latest version of the Go code
    2. Try to build a simple Hello World application:

        fmt.Println("Hello")
    }
    What is the expected output?
    The expected output is that Go will build the application.

    Please provide any additional information below.
    I think the latest changes to the Go cmd caused the problem because this was working
    correctly yesterday morning (03/01/2012).
