User: I have virtualenv-13.1.2 set up with python 3.4 (global python is python-2.7) in ubuntu 14.04. When I try to install GoogleScraper using coammandpip install GoogleScraper it gives an error 

setuptools must be installed to install from a source distribution

If I do pip install setuptools

Requirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): setuptools in ./env/lib/python3.4/site-packages

If I do pip install setuptools --upgrade 

Requirement already up-to-date: setuptools in ./env/lib/python3.4/site-packages

How can I successfully install GoogleScraper?
Assistant: After upgrading the python3.4 package in Ubuntu 14.04 I get the same error.
A quick solution is to delete and re-create the virtualenv.
