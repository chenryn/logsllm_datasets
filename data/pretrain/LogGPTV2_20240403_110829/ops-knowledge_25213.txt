**Issue Description:**

I have set up a virtual environment (virtualenv-13.1.2) with Python 3.4 on Ubuntu 14.04, while the global Python version is 2.7. When I attempt to install `GoogleScraper` using the command `pip install GoogleScraper`, I encounter the following error:

```
setuptools must be installed to install from a source distribution
```

However, when I try to install or upgrade `setuptools` within the virtual environment, I receive the message that the requirement is already satisfied or up-to-date.

**Steps Taken:**

1. **Install `setuptools`:**
   ```sh
   pip install setuptools
   ```
   - Output:
     ```
     Requirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): setuptools in ./env/lib/python3.4/site-packages
     ```

2. **Upgrade `setuptools`:**
   ```sh
   pip install setuptools --upgrade
   ```
   - Output:
     ```
     Requirement already up-to-date: setuptools in ./env/lib/python3.4/site-packages
     ```

**Solution:**

After upgrading the Python 3.4 package on Ubuntu 14.04, I still encountered the same error. A quick and effective solution is to delete and re-create the virtual environment.

**Detailed Steps:**

1. **Deactivate the current virtual environment:**
   ```sh
   deactivate
   ```

2. **Remove the existing virtual environment:**
   ```sh
   rm -rf ./env
   ```

3. **Recreate the virtual environment:**
   ```sh
   virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3.4 ./env
   ```

4. **Activate the new virtual environment:**
   ```sh
   source ./env/bin/activate
   ```

5. **Install `GoogleScraper`:**
   ```sh
   pip install GoogleScraper
   ```

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully install `GoogleScraper` in your virtual environment.
