The `prnqctl` command is a Visual Basic script located in the `%WINdir%\System32\printing_Admin_Scripts\` directory. It is used to print a test page, pause or resume a printer, and clear a printer queue. To use this command at a command prompt, you can type `cscript` followed by the full path to the `prnqctl` file, or change directories to the appropriate folder. For example:
```shell
cscript %WINdir%\System32\printing_Admin_Scripts\en-US\prnqctl
```

**Syntax:**
```shell
cscript Prnqctl {-z | -m | -e | -x | -?} [-s <ComputerName>] [-p <PrinterName>] [-u <UserName> -w <Password>]
```

**Parameters:**

- **-z**: Pauses printing on the printer specified by the `-p` parameter.
- **-m**: Resumes printing on the printer specified by the `-p` parameter.
- **-e**: Prints a test page on the printer specified by the `-p` parameter.
- **-x**: Cancels all print jobs on the printer specified by the `-p` parameter.
- **-s <ComputerName>**: Specifies the name of the remote computer that hosts the printer you want to manage. If not specified, the local computer is used.
- **-p <PrinterName>**: Required. Specifies the name of the printer you want to manage.
- **-u <UserName> -w <Password>**: Specifies an account with permissions to connect to the computer that hosts the printer you want to manage. All members of the target computer's local Administrators group have these permissions, but they can also be granted to other users. If not specified, you must be logged on under an account with these permissions for the command to work.

**Remarks:**
- The `prnqctl` script is a useful tool for managing printer queues and performing common printer maintenance tasks from the command line.

**Examples:**

1. **Print a Test Page:**
   To print a test page on the `Laserprinter1` printer shared by the `Server1` computer, type:
   ```shell
   cscript %WINdir%\System32\printing_Admin_Scripts\en-US\prnqctl -e -s Server1 -p Laserprinter1
   ```

2. **Pause Printing:**
   To pause printing on the `Laserprinter1` printer on the local computer, type:
   ```shell
   cscript %WINdir%\System32\printing_Admin_Scripts\en-US\prnqctl -z -p Laserprinter1
   ```

3. **Cancel All Print Jobs:**
   To cancel all print jobs on the `Laserprinter1` printer on the local computer, type:
   ```shell
   cscript %WINdir%\System32\printing_Admin_Scripts\en-US\prnqctl -x -p Laserprinter1
   ```

By following these examples and using the appropriate parameters, you can effectively manage your printer queues and perform necessary maintenance tasks.
