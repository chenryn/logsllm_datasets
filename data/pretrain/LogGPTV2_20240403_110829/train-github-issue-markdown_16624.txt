Subject: Issue with Error Message and React Developer Tools in Production Build

Hello,

We are currently experiencing an issue where the following error is displayed:
![screenshot_20170919_161441](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/378859/30689628-d46232a2-9ec1-11e7-8fbf-5b81c3b3bcc0.jpeg)

However, the React Developer Tools indicate a different message:
![reach_notification](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/378859/30689654-ebe05864-9ec1-11e7-8000-9fe165cc6f9a.jpg)

We have set `NODE_ENV=production` for building our JavaScript files using Browserify. Additionally, we have attempted to use `envify`, but the red warning persists.

Could you please provide some guidance on how to resolve this issue?

Thank you,
[Your Name]
