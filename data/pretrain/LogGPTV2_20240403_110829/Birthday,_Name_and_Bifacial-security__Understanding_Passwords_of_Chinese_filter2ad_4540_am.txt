over odd ones. Another interesting observation is that,
CSDN exhibits only one peak in its length distribution
curve and has many fewer passwords (i.e., only 2.16%)
with length<8. This might be due to the password policy
that requires the length to be no shorter than 8 on this site.
Frequency distribution. Fig. 3 portrays the frequency
vs.
the rank of passwords from different datasets in a
log-log scale. We ﬁrst sort each dataset according to
the password frequency in descending order. Then, each
individual password will be associated with a frequency
fr, and its rank in the frequency table is denoted by
r.
Interestingly, the curve for each dataset closely ap-
proximates a straight line, and this trend will be more
pronounced if we take all the nine curves as a whole.
This well accords with the Zipf’s law [53]:
fr and r
follow a relationship of the type fr = C · rs − C · (r −
1)s ≈ C · s · rs−1, where C ∈[0.01, 0.06] and s ∈[0.15,
0.40] are constants. Particularly, 1 − s is the absolute
value of the Zipf linear regression line’s slope. The
Zipf theory indicates that the popularity of passwords
decreases polynomially with the increase of their rank.
This further implies that a few passwords are overly
popular (explaining why online guessing [56] can be
effective, even if security mechanisms like rate-limiting
and suspicious login detection [16] are implemented
at the server), while the least frequent passwords are
very sparsely scattered in the password space (explaining
why ofﬂine guessing attackers need to consider cost-
effectiveness [4] and weigh when to stop).
Top popular passwords. Table 3 shows the top-10
most frequent passwords from different services. The
most frequent password among all datasets is “123456”,
with CSDN being the only exception due to its password
policy that requires passwords to be of length 8+ (see
Fig. 2). “111111” follows on the heel. Other popular
Chinese passwords include “123123”, “123321” and
“123456789”, all composed of digits and in simple
patterns such as repetition and palindrome. Love also
shows its magic power: “5201314”, which has a sim-
ilar pronunciation of “I love you forever and ever” in
Chinese,2 appears in the top-10 lists of four Chinese
