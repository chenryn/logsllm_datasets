**Current behavior**  
Currently we have two ways to work with forms:
  1. Declarative with `ngModel`:
    //user.component.html:
    //user.component.ts:
    this.user = user;
You can clearly see that it can be quite verbose. Name has to be specified two
or three times, elvis operator does not work with assignments. This example is
simplified, see how ugly it could be:
  2. Reactive, manually building `FormGroup`:
    //user.component.html:
    //user.component.ts:
    public group:FormGroup;
    this.group = this.createFormGroup();
    createFormGroup() {
        let group: any = {};
        group['name'] = new FormControl('', Validators.required);
        return new FormGroup(group);
    }
    group.updateValue(user);
It is even more verbose - name has to be specified twice, most of time in two
separate files, `FormGroup` is created manually. This is particularly annoying
when form has many inputs.
**Expected behavior**
Can't we take best from both? We already have all necessary information to
create `FormGroup` from markup.
    //user.component.html:
    //user.component.ts:
    ViewChild(FormGroupDirective)
    private group:FormGroupDirective;
    group.updateValue(user);
This is much cleaner, shorter, less error prone.
