**ATT&CK ID:** G0032  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Lazarus Group

The Lazarus Group has employed a variety of sophisticated techniques to execute malicious code. One such method involves changing memory protection permissions, allowing the group to overwrite in-memory DLL function code with shellcode. This shellcode is then executed through KernelCallbackTable hijacking. Additionally, the Lazarus Group has utilized shellcode embedded within macros to decrypt and manually map DLLs into memory at runtime.
