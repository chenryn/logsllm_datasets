_Original tickethttp://projects.scipy.org/numpy/ticket/1400 on 2010-02-18 by
trac user ChristianMarquardt, assigned to unknown._
When compiling numpy-1.4.0 with the Sun Studio Compilers (v12 Update 1) on
Linux (an OpenSUSE 11.1 in my case), about 30 tests in numpy.test() fail; all
failures are related to the arctan2 function.
I've found that in r7732 a patch was applied to
trunk/numpy/core/src/private/npy_config.h in response to #1799, #1800, and
#1801, #undef'ing the HAVE_ATAN2 variable in order to fix a broken atan2()
implementation on Solaris. This does no good with the SunStudio 12.1 compiler
on Linux, though; it apparently only works without failures with HAVE_ATAN2
defined.
The attached patch ensures that the original patch is only applied on Sun
platforms (i.e., not on Linux). If applied, all tests are completed
successfully under Linux. BTW, I did not observe #1802 or #1803...
I have no access to a Solaris machine, so I don't know if the original patch
(which was for Sun workshop 6 - I think that's not available any more) is
required with Sun Studio 12.1 at all.
