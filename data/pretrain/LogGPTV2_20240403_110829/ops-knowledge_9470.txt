User: I'm working on a project that runs off Google App Engine (Python) which stores various user details inside GAE's datastore. I have Flex content which users can use and once done the Flex app needs to send data to the Python backend to 'mark' the user off for that task. Any suggestions?
Assistant: Have flex send a request to the Python server. COuld be a form post or JSON data or whatever.
