User: Now there is a 64-bit CentOS server with Intel Xeon processor, 8GB memory, I want to install Docker, please provide a detailed installation steps.
Assistant: The following are the installation steps of Docker on CentOS 64-bit: 1. Install the necessary packages and dependencies: ```shell sudo yum install yum-utils device-mapper-persistent-data lvm2 ``` 2. Add Dockerâ€™s official yum source: ```shell sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo ``` 3. Install Docker: ```shell sudo yum install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io ``` 4. Start the Docker service: ```shell sudo systemctl start docker ``` 5. Verify that Docker has been successfully installed: ```shell sudo docker run hello -world ``` If all goes well, you should see Docker running successfully. 6. Set Docker to start automatically: ```shell sudo systemctl enable docker ``` 7. After the installation is complete, you can use the following command to check the version: ```shell sudo docker version ``` So far, you have successfully installed Docker.
