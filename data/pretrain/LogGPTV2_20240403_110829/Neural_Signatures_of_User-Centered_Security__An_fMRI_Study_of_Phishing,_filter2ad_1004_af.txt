were  conscientiously  making  an  effort  as  to  differentiate 
“fake” websites from “real” websites.

Both  phishing  and  malware  tasks  in  our  study  involved 
decision-making, perhaps in slightly different ways. While the 
malware 
tested  whether  participants  were  paying 
attention to security  warnings  while reading a news item, the

VII.  DISCUSSION: STUDY INSIGHTS AND IMPLICATIONS  
In this section, we summarize and further discuss the main 
findings from our study.  The neural signatures (activation in 
unique brain regions) associated with, and across, the phishing 
detection  and  malware  warnings  tasks  are  summarized  in 
Table VI. 
Distinguishing between  fake  and real  websites underlying 
the phishing task produced increased activation in many areas 
of the brain associated with decision making, problem solving, 
attention  and  visual  search.  This  means  that  the  participants 
were  undergoing  significant  effort  in  making  the  “fake”  or 
  12 
“real”  decisions.  Our  neuroimaging  results  also  show  extra 
activation  in  decision-making  areas  such  as  RMFG  while 
identifying  a  fake  website  compared  to  identifying  a  real 
website,  perhaps 
task  difficulty. 
Moreover, the comparison between the phishing and phishing 
control  tasks  clearly  highlighted  the  decision-making  aspect 
associated  with  the  former  (as  opposed  to  just  the  visual 
demands associated with both of them).  
reflecting 
increased 
While our neuroimaging data showed that users exhibited 
significant brain activation during the phishing detection task, 
their  accuracy  in  this  task,  as  determined  by  the  behavioral 
data, was only slightly better than making a random guess (in 
line with a prior lab study [10]).  This suggests that although 
the eventual decision made by the participants to differentiate 
between fake and real websites may be far from accurate, they 
certainly  were  putting  a  considerable  effort  in  making  this 
decision  as  reflected  by  their  brain  activity  in  regions 
correlated with higher order cognitive processing. Perhaps this 
was  because  many  of  the  participants  did  not  know  what 
markers  to  look  for  (e.g.,  URL  or  logo)  on  the  sites  to  make 
their  decisions.  We  note  that  a  large  fraction  of  our 
participants  belonged  to  a  non-technical  (non-computer) 
background. Overall, these findings further justify the need for 
specialized  education  and  training  for  every  day  users 
focusing on phishing in particular (such as the efforts of [47, 
48]) and security in general (such as [49, 50]). These training 
and  awareness  programs  may  help  improve  users’  phishing 
detection  performance  and  reduce  the  chances  of  their 
susceptibility  to  other  attacks.  At  the  same  time,  the  findings 
also  motivate  the  need  for  continued  research  on  designing 
phishing resistant software solutions and user interfaces.

warnings, 
significantly  more  activation

inspection.  This  suggests  that  the  participants  were  reading 
through  the  warnings  carefully  to  understand  the  message 
conveyed by the warnings and making an attempt to take  an 
appropriate  decision.  Indeed,  this  was  validated  via  our 
behavioral  data  which  showed 
that  participants  heeded 
warnings about 90% of the times (also in line with the recent 
large-scale field study of [11]). We therefore believe that our 
study provides a neurological basis as to the users’ capability 
to process and heed malware  warnings, further validating the 
results  of  [11].  It  should  be  noted  that  since  our  security 
warnings  were  quite  simplified,  our

underestimate  users’  performance  when  faced  with  malware

(such  as  those  employed  by  modern  browsers  and  variants 
thereof [11]). 
results  seem 
Another  key  component  of  our  study  was  to  asses  users’ 
performance  in  user-centered  security  tasks  based  on  their 
personality  traits.  Specifically,  we  studied  the  effect  of 
impulsivity  measured  via  a  simple  questionnaire.  We  found 
that,  in  both  phishing  detection  and  malware  warnings  tasks, 
impulsive

solving.  This  implies  that  impulsive  behavior  might  be 
counter-productive 
to  phishing  detection  and  malware 
warnings task performance. A long-term impact of this finding 
can be in developing targeted security training programs.  For 
example,  an  organization  may  concentrate  their  security 
training  efforts  on  employees  who  are  highly  impulsive,  as 
determined  by  their  scores  in  the  impulsivity  questionnaire 
[1]. Similarly, school authorities  may  focus their online child 
safety efforts on children with high trait impulsivity.  
A unique advantage of our study was that it allowed for a 
direct  comparison  between 
the  phishing  detection  and 
malware  warnings tasks. In this respect,  we found significant 
correlation  in  participants’  brain  activity  governing  decision-
making  regions  (bilateral  middle  frontal  gyri).  This  suggests 
that  both  tasks  involve,  at  a  higher  level,  some  similar 
cognitive  processes  and  that  users’  performance  in  the  two 
tasks might be correlated with each other.  Note that, although 
language  comprehension  is  unique  to  the  malware  task,  both 
tasks involved a crucial decision making aspect. Broadly, this 
seems  to  indicate  that  the  cognitive  mechanisms  underlying 
these  security  tasks  are  related,  which  may  translate  into 
similarity in users’ performance in the two tasks.  
Although  fMRI  scans  are  expensive,  we  believe  that  our 
methodology  could  also  serve  the  purpose  of  security 
screening of individuals involved in high-security operations, 
such as in the national defense sector. 
VIII.  CONCLUSIONS AND  FUTURE WORK 
users’ 
towards 
capability 
perspective 
In this paper, we presented an fMRI study to bring insights 
into  user-centered  security,  specifically  focusing  on  phishing 
detection, and malware warnings. Our results provide a largely 
positive 
and 
performance  vis-à-vis  these  crucial  security  tasks.  We  found 
that users show significant brain activity in key regions known 
to  govern  decision-making,  attention,  and  problem-solving 
ability  (phishing  and  malware  warnings)  as  well  as  language 
comprehension and reading (malware warnings). This level of 
activation  indicates  that  users  were  actively  engaged  in  these 
tasks, and were not ignoring or bypassing them (as many prior 
lab studies seem to have concluded [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]). In 
the  case  of  the  malware  warnings  task,  brain  activity  and 
behavioral performance (accuracy) were complementing each 
other validating that users heed malware warnings with a high 
likelihood (as also shown by a recent field study [11]). For the 
phishing  task,  however,  task  performance  was  poor  despite 
significant  brain  activity  associated  with  decision  making. 
This divergent result demands future investigation. It could be 
attributed  to  users’  lack  of  knowledge  as  to  the  markers  for 
“fake”  vs.  “real”  decisions  (e.g.,  URLs),  which  may  be 
overcome  by  user  education  and 
training.  We  also 
demonstrated that individuals with higher impulsive traits may 
not  utilize  their  neural  resources  as  efficiently  as  non-
impulsive individuals, and may result in poorer cognitive and 
behavioral  outcomes.  This  suggests  it  would  be  valuable  to 
study whether individual trait characteristics should factor into 
user-center  security  design.  Finally,  we  discovered  a  high 
degree  of  correlation  in  brain  activity  (with  respect  to 
decision-making  regions)  across  phishing  detection  and 
malware  warnings tasks. This correlation suggests that users’ 
behavior in one task may be predicted by their behavior in the 
other task.  
We see a clear path-forward for subsequent research using 
neuroimaging  techniques  (e.g.,  fMRI,  EEG  or  fNIRS)  to 
inform  the  design  of  user-centered  security  systems.  In  the 
long-run, such studies may provide a neural signature for poor 
and good security decisions which can be used for predicting 
as well as correcting users' security behavior. Future research 
may  conduct  subsequent  evaluation  with  diverse  participant 
samples,    study  the  effect  of  warning  fatigue  or  habituation, 
consider  user-centered  security  domains  other  than  phishing 
detection and malware warnings (e.g., password memorization 
and  recall),    and  evaluate  the  effect  of  security  training  and 
education on users’ performance.
