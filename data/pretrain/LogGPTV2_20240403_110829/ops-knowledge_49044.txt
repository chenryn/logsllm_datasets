User: I have a Python script I developed within a virtualenv on Windows (Python 2.7).
I would now like to compile it into a single EXE using Py2exe.
I've read and read the docs and stackoverflow, and yet I can't find a simple answer: How do I do this? I tried just installing py2exe (via the downloadable installer), but of course that doesn't work because it uses the system-level python, which doesn't have the dependencies for my script installed. It needs to use the virtualenv - but there doesn't seem to be such an option.
I did manage to get bbfreeze to work, but it outputs a dist folder crammed with files, and I just want a simple EXE file (one file) for my simple script, and I understand Py2Exe can do this.
tl;dr: How do I run Py2Exe within the context of a virtualenv so it correctly imports dependencies?
Assistant: You can do that this way:

Activate your virtualenv and then ...
easy_install py2exe-0.6.9.win32-py2.7.exe
