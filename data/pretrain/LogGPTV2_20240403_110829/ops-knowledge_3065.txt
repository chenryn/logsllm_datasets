Question: An application developer insists that their web application is secure against Execution After Redirect (EAR) attacks because they have implemented a whitelist for IP address validation. What is the most effective counterargument to this claim?
"A": "IP address whitelisting does not prevent the execution of code after an HTTP redirect, which is the primary concern of an EAR vulnerability.",
"B": "Whitelisting IP addresses can be bypassed through DNS poisoning, rendering the security measure ineffective against EAR.",
"C": "IP address whitelisting is a strong security measure and will make the application immune to EAR attacks.",
"D": "Implementing a whitelist for IP addresses can prevent SQL injection, which is often confused with EAR."
Answer: A
