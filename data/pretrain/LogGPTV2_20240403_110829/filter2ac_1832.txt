**ATT&CK ID:** T1543  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Create or Modify System Process

Adversaries may create or modify system-level processes to repeatedly execute malicious payloads as a means of establishing persistence. During the boot process, operating systems typically start various processes that perform essential background functions. 

- **Windows and Linux:** These system processes are commonly referred to as "services." 
- **macOS:** The equivalent processes are known as "Launch Daemons" and "Launch Agents," which are managed by the `launchd` system. Launch Daemons handle system-level initialization tasks, while Launch Agents are responsible for loading user-specific parameters.

By creating or modifying these system processes, adversaries can ensure that their malicious code is executed automatically whenever the system boots up, thereby maintaining persistent access to the compromised system.
