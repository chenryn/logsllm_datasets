Verifying That the Analyzer Has Been Correctly Created | 1112
To confirm that the configuration is working properly, perform these tasks:
Verifying That the Analyzer Has Been Correctly Created
Purpose
Verify that the analyzer named employee-monitor or employee-web-monitor has been created on the switch with
the appropriate input interfaces and appropriate output interface.
Action
You can verify the analyzer is configured as expected by using the show forwarding-options analyzer
command. To view previously created analyzers that are disabled, go to the J-Web interface.
1113
To verify that the analyzer is configured as expected while monitoring all employee traffic on the source
switch, run the show analyzer command on the source switch. The following output is displayed for this
configuration example:
user@switch> show forwarding-options analyzer
Analyzer name : employee-monitor
Mirror rate : 1
Maximum packet length : 0
State : up
Ingress monitored interfaces : ge-0/0/0.0
Ingress monitored interfaces : ge-0/0/1.0
Egress monitored interfaces : ge-0/0/0.0
Egress monitored interfaces : ge-0/0/1.0
Output VLAN : default-switch/remote-analyzer
Meaning
This output shows that the employee-monitor instance has a ratio of 1 (mirroring every packet, the default),
the maximum size of the original packet that was mirrored (0 indicates the entire packet), the state of
the configuration is up (which indicates the proper state and that the analyzer is programmed, and is
mirroring the traffic entering ge-0/0/0 and ge-0/0/1 and is sending the mirrored traffic to the VLAN
called remote-analyzer). If the state of the output interface is down or if the output interface is not
configured, the value of state will be down and the analyzer will not be programmed for mirroring.

1114
NOTE: This example uses Junos OS for EX Series switches with support for the Enhanced Layer
2 Software (ELS) configuration style.
EX4300 switches enable you to configure mirroring to send copies of packets to either a local interface
for local monitoring or to a VLAN for remote monitoring. You can use mirroring to copy these packets:
• Packets entering or exiting a port
• Packets entering a VLAN on EX4300 switches
You can analyze the mirrored traffic by using a protocol analyzer application running on a remote
monitoring station if you are sending mirrored traffic to an analyzer VLAN.
This topic includes an example that describes how to mirror traffic entering ports on the switch to the
remote-analyzer VLAN through a transit switch, so that you can perform analysis from a remote monitoring
station.
BEST PRACTICE: Mirror only necessary packets to reduce potential performance impact. We
recommend that you:
• Disable your configured mirroring sessions when you are not using them.
• Specify individual interfaces as input to analyzers rather than specifying all interfaces as
input.
• Limit the amount of mirrored traffic by using firewall filters.
This example describes how to configure remote mirroring through a transit switch:
Requirements
This example uses the following hardware and software components:
• An EX4300 switch connected to another EX4300 switch through a third EX4300 switch
• Junos OS Release 13.2X50-D10 or later for EX Series switches
Before you configure remote mirroring, be sure that:
• You have an understanding of mirroring concepts.
• The interfaces that the analyzer will use as input interfaces have been configured on the switch.

Overview and Topology
IN THIS SECTION
Topology | 1115
This example describes how to mirror traffic entering ports on the switch to the remote-analyzer VLAN
through a transit switch so that you can perform analysis from a remote monitoring station. The example
shows how to configure a switch to mirror all traffic from employee computers to a remote analyzer.
In this configuration, an analyzer session is required on the destination switch to mirror incoming traffic
from the analyzer VLAN to the egress interface to which the remote monitoring station is connected.
You must disable MAC learning on the transit switch for the remote-analyzer VLAN so that MAC learning
is disabled for all member interfaces of the remote-analyzer VLAN on the transit switch.
Figure 40 on page 1115 shows the network topology for this example.
Topology
Figure 40: Remote Mirroring Through a Transit Switch Network–Sample Topology
In this example:
• Interface ge-0/0/0 is a Layer 2 interface, and interface ge-0/0/1 is a Layer 3 interface (both
interfaces on the source switch) that serve as connections for employee computers.
1116
• Interface ge-0/0/10 is a Layer 2 interface that connects to the transit switch.
• Interface ge-0/0/11 is a Layer 2 interface on the transit switch.
• Interface ge-0/0/12 is a Layer 2 interface on the transit switch and connects to the destination
switch.
• Interface ge-0/0/13 is a Layer 2 interface on the destination switch .
• Interface ge-0/0/14 is a Layer 2 interface on the destination switch and connects to the remote
monitoring station.
• VLAN remote-analyzer is configured on all switches in the topology to carry the mirrored traffic.

Step-by-Step Procedure
To configure remote mirroring through a transit switch:
1. On the source switch:
• Configure the VLAN ID for the remote-analyzer VLAN:
[edit vlans]
user@switch# set remote-analyzer vlan-id 999
1118
• Configure the interfaces on the network port connected to transit switch for trunk mode and
associate it with the remote-analyzer VLAN:
[edit interfaces]
user@switch# set ge-0/0/10 unit 0 family ethernet-switching interface-mode trunk
user@switch# set ge-0/0/10 unit 0 family ethernet-switching vlan members 999
• Configure the employee-monitor analyzer:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor input ingress interface ge-0/0/0.0
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor input ingress interface ge-0/0/1.0
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor input egress interface ge-0/0/0.0
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor input egress interface ge-0/0/1.0
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor output vlan remote-analyzer
2. On the transit switch:
• Configure the VLAN ID for the remote-analyzer VLAN:
[edit vlans]
user@switch# set remote-analyzer vlan-id 999
• Configure the ge-0/0/11 interface for trunk mode, associate it with the remote-analyzer VLAN:
[edit interfaces]
user@switch# set ge-0/0/11 unit 0 family ethernet-switching interface-mode trunk
• Configure the ge-0/0/12 interface for trunk mode, associate it with the remote-analyzer VLAN, and
set the interface for egress traffic only:
[edit interfaces]
user@switch# set ge-0/0/12 unit 0 family ethernet-switching interface-mode trunk
user@switch# set vlans remote-analyzer interface ge-0/0/12
1119
• Configure the no-mac-learning option for the remote-analyzer VLAN to disable MAC learning on all
interfaces that are members of the remote-analyzer VLAN:
[edit interfaces]
user@switch# set vlans remote-analyzer no-mac-learning
3. On the destination switch:
• Configure the VLAN ID for the remote-analyzer VLAN:
[edit vlans]
user@switch# set remote-analyzer vlan-id 999
• Configure the ge-0/0/13 interface for trunk mode, associate it with the remote-analyzer VLAN, and
set the interface for ingress traffic only:
[edit interfaces]
user@switch# set ge-0/0/13 unit 0 family ethernet-switching interface-mode trunk
user@switch# set vlans remote-analyzer interface ge-0/0/13 ingress
• Configure the interface connected to the remote monitoring station for trunk mode:
[edit interfaces]
user@switch# set ge-0/0/14 unit 0 family ethernet-switching interface-mode trunk
• Configure the employee-monitor analyzer:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor input ingress vlan remote-analyzer

Verifying That the Analyzer Has Been Correctly Created
Purpose
Verify that the analyzer named employee-monitor has been created on the switch with the appropriate
input interfaces and the appropriate output interface.
Action
You can verify whether the analyzer is configured as expected by using the show analyzer command. To
view previously created analyzers that are disabled, go to the J-Web interface.
To verify that the analyzer is configured as expected while monitoring all employee traffic on the source
switch, run the show analyzer command on the source switch. The following output is displayed for this
example configuration:
user@switch> show forwarding-options analyzer
Analyzer name : employee-monitor
Mirror rate : 1
Maximum packet length : 0
State : up
Ingress monitored interfaces : ge-0/0/0.0
Ingress monitored interfaces : ge-0/0/1.0
Egress monitored interfaces : ge-0/0/0.0
Egress monitored interfaces : ge-0/0/1.0
Output vlan : default-switch/remote-analyzer
Meaning
This output shows that the employee-monitor analyzer has a ratio of 1 (mirroring every packet, the default),
is mirroring the traffic entering ge-0/0/0 and ge-0/0/1, and sending the mirrored traffic to the analyzer
remote-analyzer.
