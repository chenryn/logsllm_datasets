The following issue was reported by @HDembinski in a comment on gh-15489. If the described behavior is indeed a mismatch, it should be considered a bug and investigated further.

> The command `python dev.py lint` should also run `flake8`, and the PEP8 checks should be consistent between the two. Can you provide a branch where one of these commands fails while the other passes?

I apologize for not having a clean reproducer, but I believe the patch [0545e5e](https://github.com/your-repo/commit/0545e5e) was made after `python dev.py lint` did not report any issues with my new code. However, the CI job running `python tools/lint_diff.py` identified some problems. Although I have not delved into the implementation details, it appears that these two commands are not applying the same set of rules.
