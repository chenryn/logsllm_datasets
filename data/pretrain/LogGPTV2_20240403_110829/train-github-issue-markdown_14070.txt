The below was reported by @HDembinski in a comment on gh-15489. That should be
considered a bug if it's indeed not matching, so this should be looked at.

Sorry, I don't have a clean reproducer, but I think this patch here  
`0545e5e`  
was a change that I made after `python dev.py lint` gave me no complains
(about my new code), but `python tools/lint_diff.py` run by the CI job found
those issues. I haven't looked into the implementation, but these two commands
apparently do not apply the same rules.
