### Suggested Instantiation Based on Client and Server Requirements

We recommend selecting the instantiation based on the client's output needs and the classifier information that the server is willing to disclose. If the client requires a fine-grained output to analyze the distribution of different classes, they may request access not only to the plurality-vote class but also to the selected class of each tree. However, this approach will reveal more information about the underlying random forest model compared to disclosing only the plurality-vote class.

#### Identification Risks in DNA Methylation Data

The two most relevant papers on the risk of identifying DNA methylation data are summarized below:

1. **Genotype Inference from Methylation Data**:
   - The first paper on this topic demonstrated that approximately 1,000 genomic positions, as well as alcohol consumption and smoking habits, can be inferred from certain methylation data [43]. The authors warned that such genotype inference could represent personally identifiable information. However, they did not further investigate how genotypes could be matched to methylation profiles or quantify the success rate of such attacks under various conditions.
   
2. **Privacy-Preserving Guidelines for Methylation Data**:
   - Dyke et al. proposed high-level guidelines for disclosing methylation data while preserving privacy [9]. They suggested restricting access to methylation data highly correlated with the genotype. Despite these recommendations, a concrete scenario for evaluating the threat and the protection provided by their countermeasures was not provided.

#### Similar Approaches and Studies

- **Bayesian Method for Genotype Matching**:
  - Schadt et al. introduced a Bayesian method to predict and match genotypes to RNA-expression profiles [44]. Using 1,000 eQTLs (expression quantitative trait loci), they achieved a matching accuracy of over 97% for more than 300 individuals. They also simulated a dataset of 300 million individuals, demonstrating a matching accuracy of 97%.

- **Microbial Patterns for Individual Identification**:
  - Franzosa et al. studied whether individuals possess unique microbial patterns that can be used for identification [45]. Their results showed that over 80% of individuals could be uniquely identified among a population of hundreds, even up to one year later in the case of the gut microbiome.

- **Tracking MicroRNA Expression Profiles**:
  - Backes et al. investigated the tracking of microRNA expression profiles over time [46]. They found that such data could be linked with a 90% success rate, and the success rates remained constant even with a one-year time shift between profiles. They proposed two countermeasures: one involving hiding part of the microRNA expressions and the other using probabilistic sanitization of the microRNA expression profiles. Additionally, they showed that microRNA-based datasets are vulnerable to membership inference attacks based on the average statistics of microRNA expression values [47].

#### Re-identification of Genotypes

- **Re-identification via Genetic Genealogy Databases**:
  - Gymrek et al. demonstrated that genotypes can be re-identified by querying genetic genealogy databases containing surnames with short tandem repeats on the Y chromosome [21]. By combining inferred surnames with metadata such as age and state, they successfully traced back the identities of multiple contributors in public databases.

- **Inference of Phenotypic Traits**:
  - Humbert et al. showed that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can be exploited to infer phenotypic traits like eye color or blood type, which can further re-identify anonymous genotypes [22]. This work highlights that once the genotype corresponding to a DNA methylation profile is identified, it becomes relatively straightforward to recover the real identity of the owner of the methylation profile.

#### Privacy-Preserving Disease Prediction

- **Private Classification Protocols**:
  - Bost et al. developed three main private classification protocols, including decision trees, that protect both patient data and the classifier model [23]. These protocols were proven secure in the honest-but-curious adversarial model and evaluated on real medical datasets. Our work builds upon their constructions for our private random forest classifier.

- **Statistical Tests on Encrypted Data**:
  - Duverle et al. proposed a protocol for privately computing statistical tests on patient data using exact logistic regression [48]. Their performance evaluation showed that they could perform statistical tests with more than 600 SNPs across thousands of patients in several hours.

- **Homomorphic Encryption for Disease Susceptibility Tests**:
  - Ayday et al. developed schemes for private disease susceptibility tests using homomorphic encryption and proxy-encryption [24], [49]. These tests are based on linear combinations of SNPs and other environmental and clinical factors, and do not involve complex machine-learning classifiers. Danezis and De Cristofaro improved the protocol of [24] by using an alternative SNP encoding and making the patient-side computation more efficient [26].

- **Practical Privacy-Preserving Scheme for HIV Outcomes**:
  - McLaren et al. used a similar security architecture to develop a practical privacy-preserving scheme for predicting HIV-related outcomes [25]. All these works assume an honest-but-curious adversary, which is considered realistic in the healthcare environment.

### Conclusion

In this study, we demonstrated that DNA methylation datasets can be re-identified by accessing an auxiliary database of genotypes. Using a Bayesian approach, we achieved an accuracy of 97.5% to 100% depending on the attack scenario, with a few hundred methylation regions and genotype positions. We empirically showed that the few wrongly matched pairs could be correctly identified and rejected, resulting in a false-positive rate of 0 and a true-positive rate of 1 for appropriate statistical thresholds. Our identification attack was robust to a decrease in methylation-meQTL pairs and an increase in the database size to more than 2,500 genotypes.

To address this severe threat to epigenetic privacy, we proposed a novel cryptographic scheme for privately classifying tumors based on methylation data. Our protocol uses random forests and homomorphic encryption and is proven secure in the honest-but-curious adversarial model. We implemented our private classifier in C++ and evaluated its performance on real data, showing that it can accurately classify brain tumors into nine classes of tumor subtypes based on 900 methylation levels in less than an hour. Given the high re-identification risk, we strongly recommend removing DNA methylation profiles from public databases, especially as genotypes are increasingly available online, sometimes with their owners' identifiers [11].

### Future Work

- **Tissue-Specific meQTL-Methylation Pairs**:
  - We plan to investigate if the identification attack remains successful when meQTL-methylation pairs are learned from different tissue data.

- **Alternative Machine-Learning Algorithms**:
  - We aim to study other machine-learning algorithms and propose private schemes for those that are efficient in classifying methylation data. Differentially private approaches will also be explored, although they may degrade utility too much for typical medical needs [50].
