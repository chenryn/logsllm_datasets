Idaho designated Ada County as its metropolitan area (area), which includes unincorporated portions of Ada 
County; the cities of Boise, Eagle, Garden, Kuna, Meridian, and Star; and the Boise Air Terminal. 
Governance: Advanced Implementation 
Communications interoperability is a clear priority for Ada County as demonstrated in the breadth of 
membership in the Ada County (Idaho) Emergency Communications Planning Committee (ECPC) (e.g., 
Idaho State Communications).  Ada County is currently moving to a new system, and agreements are 
regularly updated among all agencies to facilitate the transition.  Ada County has a strategic plan in place for 
interoperability that includes fire, public works, and hazardous materials agencies.  Organizations within Ada 
County consider multi-agency interoperability (e.g., interoperability with the area’s countywide system) 
when procuring communications equipment and have dedicated local funding (e.g., 9-1-1 tax) for new 
technology, upgrades, and maintenance, which reduces the area’s reliance on federal grants for 
interoperability funding.  The Ada County Sheriff is the approving authority in the area and, along with the 
governor, has shown political and fiscal support for communications interoperability across the area.  With 
such success in the area of communications governance, Ada County should consider expanding its 
communications interoperability efforts with surrounding jurisdictions outside of the area. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Proactively recruit new participants, including regional, state, and federal agencies (e.g., Federal Bureau 
of Investigation, Bureau of Land Management), and define roles and responsibilities for all governance 
group members 
• 
Review the strategic plan annually  
• 
Align regional and state strategic planning efforts to ensure that regional interoperability needs are met

Ada County has long-established SOPs for interoperability within the county and has disseminated them to 
participating agencies.  The area used existing policies and procedures in creating the Tactical Interoperable 
Communications Plan (TICP).  Many of the regional SOPs were not followed during the TICP validation 
exercise, which demonstrates the need for further dissemination of and training on these policies and 
procedures beyond Ada County.  National Incident Management System (NIMS)/Incident Command System 
(ICS) was implemented in Ada County more than 1 year ago, and the exercise evaluators noted that the 
performance of the acting Communications Unit Leader was “noteworthy” during the exercise.  Because of 
the limited scope of the exercise, assessing the use of regional SOPs and command and control in a 
multijurisdictional environment (beyond Ada County agencies) was difficult.  According to the After Action 
Report, the participants did not demonstrate proficiency with regional SOPs (e.g., when gateways were used, 
the TICP gateway request and deactivation procedures were not followed).

Ada County reports daily use of shared channels, gateways, and the county’s shared system.  All available 
interoperability methods (i.e., shared channels, gateways, shared system) were successfully demonstrated 
during the TICP validation exercise.  The limited scope of the exercise did not necessitate much cross-
jurisdictional communications, but the Boise Bomb Squad, a regional first responder resource, was able to 
effectively communicate when the scenario required it.  The successful TICP validation exercise can serve as 
a model for future cross-jurisdictional exercises.  Dispatchers appeared somewhat unfamiliar with identifying 
and manipulating existing patches, but the patch was used successfully to connect multiple agencies.  
Officials in Ada County suggest that area agencies’ response to recent day-to-day events with confident and 
successful use of available interoperability solutions has further demonstrated the Ada County public safety 
community’s frequent use of and familiarity with communications interoperability resources. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Regularly test and exercise the deployment of regional communications interoperability resources to 
improve user proficiency (e.g., gateways) 
• 
Consider adding interagency/multijurisdictional communications interoperability (including federal 
agencies) as a component for all future exercises

Technology Overview    
Ada County communications are currently fragmented between the very high frequency (VHF) band and the ultra high 
frequency (UHF) band.  Law enforcement agencies primarily operate on the UHF band while fire agencies and 
emergency medical services use the VHF band.  This situation will be rectified when Ada County agencies transition to 
the new 700 megahertz (MHz) digital Project 25 (P25)-compliant trunked system.  The transition is scheduled to be 
complete by the end of the first quarter of calendar year 2007. 
While the Idaho Statewide Interoperability Executive Council released a plan in July 2005 that focuses on the 700 MHz 
statewide P25-compliant backbone, cost issues will probably force the state to an integrated P25 solution using 700 
MHz primarily in populated areas and a combination of UHF and VHF in rural areas.  Because 65 percent of the land in 
Idaho is federally owned, the VHF band will probably be used for coordination with federal agencies as well.

Although officials noted that the Emergency 911 (E911) Board deals with equipment interoperability and 
that the Total Quality Improvement (TQI) group addresses general public safety issues, the relationship 
among the two groups and their decision-making responsibilities and authorities for ensuring interoperable 
communications in the area is not clearly documented.  Ottumwa has some agreements in place (e.g., South 
East Iowa Response Group formal mutual aid agreements) and a mix of formal and informal partnerships 
among the agencies in the area.  Formalizing these partnerships through documented agreements will ensure 
regionwide participation in achieving interoperable communications.  Although strategic planning efforts 
exist broadly for public safety issues, the area does not have a specific strategy focused on improving 
interoperable communications.  The area procures communications equipment based on agency-specific 
needs and does not have a long-term or regionwide funding plan addressing interoperability.  Additionally, 
officials in the area indicated that leadership had only recently become aware of the need for and challenges 
of public safety interoperable communications. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Clarify how the two decision-making groups (i.e., E911 Board and TQI committee) are related through a 
formalized charter and define roles and responsibilities of each of the groups 
• 
Develop regional interoperability agreements (e.g., memoranda of understanding) beyond the existing 
mutual aid agreements and involve all participant agencies  
• 
Consider including interoperable communications as part of the overall strategic planning process 
• 
Develop, document, and implement a regional strategic plan (beyond the operational focus of the 
Tactical Interoperable Communication Plan [TICP]) with participant approval, adoption, and acceptance 
that takes into account a long-term communications funding strategy (beyond grants) 
• 
Begin to prioritize and identify funding sources to meet regional interoperability needs and identify long-
term (e.g., 3 to 5 years) sustainable funding for communications interoperability beyond grants 
• 
Identify a champion(s) that would more fully support a regional strategic plan for interoperability 
• 
Raise communications interoperability priority across the area and broadly involve senior government 
leadership

this distribution occurs, there is no way to ensure that agencies are fully informed of the procedures to 
achieve interoperable communications.  Ottumwa has implemented and has been practicing SOPs compliant 
with the National Incident Management System (NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS) for more than 1 
year and was able to demonstrate familiarity with command and control communications during its TICP 
validation exercise.  However, during the TICP validation exercise, there were indicators that more practice 
of command and control SOPs is needed.  For example, during the exercise, the Communications Unit 
Leader was pre-designated but did not demonstrate a full understanding of the responsibilities, ICS forms 
were not completed, and participants did not use plain language. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Document and distribute regional interoperability SOPs (beyond the TICP) and put them into practice 
through regular training (e.g., in-service refreshers and basic training courses), exercises, and usage  
• 
Consider developing policy on use and limitations of commercial services (e.g., cellular telephones)

Within the limited scope of the TICP validation exercise (e.g., exercise participants represented mainly 
Ottumwa County and not other jurisdictions in the area), the participants demonstrated an understanding of 
the available interoperable communications equipment (radio caches and shared channels).  However, 
because only two local agencies beyond Ottumwa County were represented in the exercise (e.g., Wapello 
County Sheriff’s Department, Southeast Iowa Response Group).  The participants encountered usage issues, 
such as interference on the statewide mutual aid channel, when attempting to leverage interoperability 
solutions. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Follow the recommendations provided to the area in the Exercise Evaluation Guide (e.g., address 
interference issues, available frequencies, radio cache protocols) 
• 
Regularly test and exercise deployment of regional interoperability communications resources (e.g., 
cached radios, shared channels) to improve proficiency of use 
•

The Ottumwa Police Department uses an ultra high frequency radio system, while most other public safety entities, such 
as the Ottumwa Fire Department and emergency medical services, use very high frequency (VHF) radio systems.  
Interoperability is limited to four VHF cache radios and three shared channels that are only shared within disciplines 
rather than across disciplines.  There are no interoperability gateways or shared systems available.    
For the future, the State of Iowa is planning to purchase a Raytheon ACU-1000M interoperability gateway with 2 
dedicated portable radios for each of the 17 counties (including Wapello County) in Iowa Homeland Security Region 5.  
Additionally, the state is planning to establish a radio cache of 10 portable radios for each Region 5 county.  The radio 
cache frequency band would be decided by each county.

The Communications Management Board serves as the regional decision-making group for the area.  The 
board has the authority and mission to manage regional interoperability, and members include city and 
county law enforcement and fire services.  It is unclear how well emergency medical services (EMS) is 
represented within the decision-making group.  The area has formal agreements (e.g., shared user agreements 
and other interlocal governmental agreements) with local public safety organizations.  The area has a 
strategic plan for interoperable communications in place; however, it is unclear how regularly the plan is 
reviewed.  The area has provided for long-term regional fiscal support for interoperable communications 
systems through a tax in place on landline and cellular telephones.  The area’s leadership should be 
commended for involving all participating agencies in prioritizing communications interoperability, and 
identifying long-term sustainable funding.  
Recommendations: 
• 
Ensure decision-making group membership represents all first responders and public support disciplines 
(e.g., EMS, hospitals, public health) 
•

Previously existing agreements (e.g., Mutual Agreements for Regional Dispatch Center, and Originating 
Agency Identifier Agreements) were incorporated into the Topeka Tactical Interoperable Communications 
Plan (TICP).  The area has begun to disseminate these SOPs through the TICP Implementation Workshop 
and by including them with the gateways.  National Incident Management System (NIMS)/Incident 
Command System (ICS) was implemented more than 1 year ago, and a wide variety of public support 
organizations (e.g., hospitals, churches) are being trained on these processes.  During the TICP validation 
exercise, participants experienced some communications command and control problems attributable to a 
failure of NIMS/ICS (e.g., law enforcement communications bypassed the Operations section chief, multiple 
Operations command nets [one per branch] were established, common terminology and standard naming 
conventions were not always used).

The Topeka area frequently uses its available means of interoperable communications (e.g., gateways and 
shared systems).  During the exercise, the participants effectively established interoperable communications 
among agencies, and participant’s demonstrated proficiency and familiarity with the equipment (e.g., cache 
radios, gateways, shared channels, and shared systems).  There was a good level of participation from local, 
state, and federal agencies (e.g., railroads, Kansas Highway Patrol, Federal Bureau of Investigation).  The 
area should be commended on its effective use of amateur radio during day-to-day communications unit 
staffing, via its amateur communications capability program, to reduce the dispatch workload in times of 
heavy traffic.  Topeka Amateur Radio Emergency Services also demonstrated knowledge and effective use 
of the available interoperability solutions (e.g., gateway).

The State of Kansas identified the City of Topeka as its focus for the TICP.  All major public safety and governmental 
agencies in the City of Topeka operate on an 800 megahertz, Motorola SMARTNET™ system.  The system consists of 
approximately 70 agencies and 250 talk groups.  All radios have been configured with interoperability channels listed as 
Event 1, Event 2, and Event 3.  Law enforcement and fire radios use common channels.  All radios have been 
programmed with National Public Safety Planning Advisory Committee channels.   
Shawnee County uses a Motorola 2-site, 15-channel, simulcast, trunked system.  The system was developed in 
partnership with the Kansas Department of Transportation.  The state is a licensee of the system while the county 
provides the infrastructure and assists in system maintenance.  In addition, the county has use of two conventional 
channels: a mutual aid call and mutual aid Tactical (TAC) and has recently updated the controllers in its east and west 
radio sites. 
The State of Kansas point of contact has stated intentions to develop TICPs for other major metropolitan centers using 
Topeka plan as a model.  The current status of these intentions is unknown.  Plans for such efforts are developed by the 
Kansas Department of Transportation, which also maintains the radio system for the Kansas Highway Patrol.  The state 
system is planned to be expanded to allow other counties to buy or lease radios and rent space on the system.  The state 
is also expecting to transition to a digital system soon.

The Portland area has a communications-specific committee made up of agency directors and department 
commissioners from public safety, emergency medical services, and the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency (among others).  The area indicated that  multiple groups were addressing interoperability in the area 
(State of Maine Homeland Security Advisory Council [HSAC], Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan 
(TICP) Working Group, Radio Network Board, and the communications-specific Concept of Operations 
[CONOPS] group), and it appears that the decision-making authority and the implementation responsibilities 
are not clearly defined among them.  There is strong state support for the planning that has occurred to date, 
but the area appears to lack sufficient local representation (from Portland) in implementing the TICP.  
Formal agreements are in practice among all organizations in the area, which are regularly updated and 
distributed.  Beyond the operational TICP, there was no reference to a strategic plan for interoperable 
communications other than the CONOPS plan that outlined operational means of interoperability (e.g., 
simplex frequencies licensed to the State of Maine for certain circumstances).  Despite the lack of a
