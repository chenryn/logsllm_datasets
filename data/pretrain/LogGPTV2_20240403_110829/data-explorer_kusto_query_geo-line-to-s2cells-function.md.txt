# geo_line_to_s2cells()
Calculates S2 cell tokens that cover a line or multiline on Earth. This function is a useful geospatial join tool.
## Syntax
`geo_line_to_s2cells(`*lineString* [`,` *level*[ `,` *radius*]]`)`
[!INCLUDE [syntax-conventions-note](../../includes/syntax-conventions-note.md)]
## Parameters
|Name|Type|Required|Description|
|--|--|--|--|
| *lineString* | `dynamic` |  :heavy_check_mark: | Line or multiline in the [GeoJSON format](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946).|
| *level* | `int` | | Defines the requested cell level. Supported values are in the range [0, 30]. If unspecified, the default value `11` is used.|
| *radius* | `real` | | Buffer radius in meters. If unspecified, the default value `0` is used.|
## Returns
Array of S2 cell token strings that cover a line or a multiline. If the radius is set to a positive value, then the covering will be of both input shape and all points within the radius of the input geometry.
If any of the following:  line, level, radius is invalid, or the cell count exceeds the limit, the query will produce a null result.
> [!NOTE]
>
> * Covering the line with S2 cell tokens can be useful in matching coordinates to lines, thus finding points nearby lines.
> * The line covering tokens are of the same S2 cell level.
> * The maximum count of tokens per line is 65536.
> * The [geodetic datum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodetic_datum) used to measure distance on Earth is a sphere. Line edges are [geodesics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic) on the sphere.
> * If input line edges are straight cartesian lines, consider using [geo_line_densify()](geo-line-densify-function.md) in order to convert planar edges to geodesics.
**Choosing the S2 cell level**
* Ideally we would want to cover every line with one or just a few unique cells such that no two lines share the same cell. 
* In practice, try covering with just a few cells, no more than a dozen. Covering with more than 10,000 cells might not yield good performance.
* Query run time and memory consumption might differ greatly because of different S2 cell level values.
**Performance improvement suggestions**
* If possible, reduce coordinates table size before join, by grouping coordinates that are very close to each other by using [geospatial clustering](geospatial-grid-systems.md) or by filtering out unnecessary coordinates due to nature of the data or business needs.
* If possible, reduce lines count due to nature of the data or business needs. Filter out unnecessary lines before join, scope to the area of interest or unify lines.
* In case of very big lines, reduce their size using [geo_line_simplify()](geo-line-simplify-function.md).
* Changing S2 cell level may improve performance and memory consumption.
* Changing [join kind and hint](join-operator.md) may improve performance and memory consumption.
* In case positive radius is set, reverting to radius 0 on buffered shape using [geo_line_buffer()](geo-line-buffer-function.md) may improve performance.
## Examples
The following query finds all tube stations within 500 meters of streets and aggregates tubes count by street name.
> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> Run the query
```kusto
let radius = 500;
