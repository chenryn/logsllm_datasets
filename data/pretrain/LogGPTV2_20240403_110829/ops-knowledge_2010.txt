User: Using the bulk loader, I've downloaded the live datastore, and am now trying to upload it to the development server. When running the upload_data command to upload the datastore to the dev server I get the following error, 
BadRequestError: Illegal string "dev~s~app_id" in dataset id.
The command I'm using the upload the data is 
appcfg.py upload_data --url=://localhost:8080/_ah/remote_api --filename=datastore_2-11-14
The command I used the downlaod the data is 
appcfg.py download_data --url=://app_id.appspot.com/_ah/remote_api --filename=datastore_2-11-14
Assistant: I managed to discover the problem on my own.
The issue was with adding s~ before the app_id in the app.yaml file.
Despite the Google App Engine documentation stating that s~ should be before the app_id for applications using the High Replication Datastore, this apparently causes an error when uploading the the development server.
