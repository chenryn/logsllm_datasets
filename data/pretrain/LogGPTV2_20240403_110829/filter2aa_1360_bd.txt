### Qwant: A Comprehensive Search Engine

Qwant, launched in 2013 after two years of research, aims to consolidate results from various types of search engines into a single, user-friendly interface. The layout is reminiscent of Google, with results displayed in columns labeled Web, News, Images, Videos, Maps, and Music. Users can customize the layout to their preferences.

#### Interface and Functionality
- **User-Friendly Design**: The interface is clean and intuitive, making it easy for users to navigate.
- **Diverse Results**: A default search of a personal name, for example, yields expected results similar to those from Google and Bing. Clicking on the tabs at the top provides additional results, including recent posts from social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and MySpace.

#### Unique Features
- **Privacy-Focused**: Qwant does not track or record any user data, which is a significant advantage for privacy advocates and those conducting sensitive investigations.
- **Augmented Results**: It enhances traditional search results with information from crowd-sourced websites such as Wikipedia and Wolfram Alpha, improving the relevance and accuracy of the results.

#### Performance and Capabilities
- **Document Search**: Qwant excels in finding documents that mention the target within the text. The "filetype" operator works similarly to other search engines.
- **Voxalead**: This Exalead-powered feature searches within audio and video files using speech-to-text technology, presenting results in a timeline view. Currently, most results are linked to news media and public news video files.

### DuckDuckGo: Privacy and Anonymity

DuckDuckGo (duckduckgo.com) is another privacy-focused search engine. It routes queries through StartPage's servers, protecting the user's IP address from being monitored by the target website. While this technique offers a layer of protection, it may not be foolproof for highly sensitive searches.

### Additional Features of Qwant
- **Exportable Results**: One of Qwant's standout features is the ability to easily export search results as CSV, JSON, or RSS files. This is particularly useful for conducting multiple searches and analyzing results later.

### Million Short: Focusing on Lesser-Known Sites

Million Short (millionshort.com) allows users to exclude results from the most popular one million websites, focusing instead on lesser-known sites. Users can choose to remove the top 100,000, 10,000, 1,000, or 100 results.

### Tor-Based Search Engines

Tor (The Onion Router) is free software that enables anonymous communication by routing internet traffic through a volunteer network, concealing the user's location and activity. Tor-based search engines and proxies are essential for accessing and searching the dark web, where illegal activities often occur.

- **Ahmia (ahmia.fi)**: Launched in 2019, Ahmia is a promising Tor search engine. It indexes Tor sites well and is effective for querying email addresses.
- **Dark Search (darksearch.io)**: Dark Search is another powerful Tor search engine, providing more comprehensive results than Ahmia.
- **Not Evil**: Accessible only via the Tor Browser, Not Evil is one of the most thorough Tor search engines available. It can be accessed through Tor2Web if you are not using the Tor Browser.

### FTP Search

File Transfer Protocol (FTP) servers are often overlooked in online research. Many FTP servers are publicly accessible and can contain valuable, confidential documents. 

- **Google and Bing**: These search engines index most publicly available data on FTP servers. For example, a search for "Cisco" and "PDF" can yield numerous results.
- **Napalm FTP (searchftps.org)**: Provides very recent content and displays the date the data was last confirmed.
- **Mammoth (mmnt.ru)**: Allows filtering results by the country hosting the content and includes a "Search within results" option.

### Nerdy Data: Searching Source Code

Nerdy Data (nerdydata.com/reports/new) searches the programming code of websites, revealing hidden information and identifying sites that use specific code. This can be useful for detecting stolen proprietary code, cloned sites, and validating the popularity of certain programming functions.

### IntelTechniques Search Engines Tool

To simplify the initial search process, the IntelTechniques Search Engines Tool (Figure 9.10) allows users to quickly search across multiple engines, including Google, Bing, Yandex, Baidu, and others. Each search opens in a new tab, and the "Submit All" option runs the query across all listed services.

By leveraging these tools and techniques, researchers can conduct more comprehensive and efficient searches, ensuring they cover a wide range of sources and maintain their privacy.
