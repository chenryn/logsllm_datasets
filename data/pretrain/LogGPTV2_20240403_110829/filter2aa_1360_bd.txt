Qwant attempts to combine the results of several types of search engines into one page. It was launched in 2013 
after two years of research. It has an easily digestible interface that displays results in columns tided Web, News, 
Images, Videos, Maps, and Music. There is a Google "feel" to it and the layout can be changed to your own 
preferences. A default search of my own name provided the expected results similar to Google and Bing. 
Clicking on the tabs at the top introduced new results not found on the other engines. The results included 
recent posts from Twitter, Facebook, Unkedln, and Myspace from and about people with my name.
This search engine with a clean interface offers two unique services. It has gained a lot of popularity because it 
does not track anything from users. Engines, such as Google, record and maintain all of your search history and 
sites visited. This can be a concern to privacy advocates and those with sensitive investigations. Additionally, it 
uses information from crowd-sourced websites such as Wikipedia and Wolfram Alpha to augment traditional 
results and improve relevance. You will receive fewer results here than at more popular search engines, but the 
accuracy of the results will improve.
Headquartered in Paris, this search engine has gained a lot of popularity in the United States. The main search 
engine provides many results on popular searches. I have found that individual targets without a strong internet 
presence do not get many, if any, results on this site. However, this site excels in two areas. It works well in 
finding documents that include the target mentioned within the document. The "filetype" operator used in other 
engines works the same here. Voxalead, an Exalead search engine, searches within audio and video files for 
specific words. This is thanks to speech to text technologies. Voxalead will search within all of the spoken audio 
of a file for references to the text searched. The results are presented in a timeline view. Currently, the majority 
of the results of this new product link to news media and public news video files.

The final benefit of this service over all others is the easy ability to export search results as a file. The "Links" 
section to the right of all search pages displays options to download a csv, json, or rss file of the results. The csv 
option is a simple spreadsheet that possesses all of the search results with descriptions and direct links. I find 
this helpful when I have many searches to conduct in a short amount of time, and I do not have the ability to 
analyze the results until later.

This website offers a unique function that is not found on any other search engine. You can choose to remove 
results that link to the most popular one million websites. This will eliminate popular results and focus on lesser- 
known websites. You can also select to remove the top 100,000,10,000,1,000, or 100 results.
Tor is free software for enabling anonymous communication. The name is an acronym derived from the original 
software project name The Onion Router. Tor directs internet traffic through a free, worldwide, volunteer 
network consisting of more than six thousand relays to conceal a user's location and usage from anyone 
conducting network surveillance or traffic analysis. Using Tor makes it more difficult for internet activity to be 
traced back to the user. This also applies to a website that is hosted on the Tor network. Usually, these sites 
include illegal drug shops, child pornography swaps, and weapon sales. Because these sites are not hosted on 
publicly viewable networks, they are hard to locate and connect. Tor-based search engines and a proxy aid this 
process.
Whenever you see a URL like libertygb2nyey ay .onion, it is a Tor Onion website. As mentioned earlier, you 
cannot connect directly to these links without being connected to the Tor network. However, you can replace 
".onion" within the address to ".onion.ly" in order to view the content. In the above example, navigating to the 
website libertygb2nyeyay.onion.ly will display the content using the Tor2Web proxies. This connects you with 
Tor2web, which then talks to the onion service via Tor, and relays the response back. This is helpful when 
locating Tor links on Twitter.
This engine appeared in 2019 and appears quite promising. When I conducted a search of "OSINT" within 
/\hmia, 1 received 5 results. The same query' on Dark Search revealed 51 results. It appears to index Tor sites 
well, and I received many' results when querying email addresses of targets. This has replaced Ahmia for many 
of my Tor-based investigations.
I believe some of the strongest Tor search engines exist only on the Tor network. You cannot access them from 
a standard internet connection, and the Tor Browser is required for native use. My favorite is "Not Evil", which 
can be found at the following address if connected to Tor.
This is a very' powerful Tor search engine. While no engine can index and locate every' Tor website, this is the 
most thorough option that 1 have seen. It should be the first engine used when searching Tor related sites. The 
links in the results will not load if searching through a standard browser and connection. Using the Tor Browser 
discussed previously' is the ideal way to use this service.
This service relies on Google's indexing of Tor sites which possess URL proxy links. However, I find some 
"hidden" sites with this utility' which were not presented by the previous options.

Since Tor2\Veb allows us to use their proxy, we can connect to "Not Evil" by navigating directly to the following 
Tor2\Veb proxy address, without being on the Tor Browser.
This presents the home page of the search site, and allows for a keyword search. However, searching through 
this portal while being connected through the Tor2Web proxy can present difficulties. Instead, consider 
conducting a search within a URL submission. In the following web address, I am connecting to Tor2\Veb's 
proxy of the search engine and requesting a search results page for the term OSINT.
I believe I could fill several chapters with tutorials for the hundreds of search engines available today. Instead, I 
point you toward two of the best collections 1 have found.
Search Engine Colossus (searchenginecolossus.com)
This website is an index of practically every search engine in every country. The main page offers a list of 
countries alphabetically. Each of these links connects to a list of active search engines in that country. I stay 
away from this service when searching American-based subjects. However, if my target has strong ties to a 
specific country, I always research the engines that are used in that area through this website.
Fagan Finder (faganfinder.com)
This website offers an interactive search page which populates your query into hundreds of options. Enter your

offhne search tool provided at the end of this chapter.
FTP Search
I believe that the searching of File Transfer Protocol (FTP) servers is one of the biggest areas of the internet 
that is missed by most online researchers. FTP servers are computers with a public IP address used to store files. 
While these can be secured with mandated access credentials, this is rarely the case. Most are public and can be 
accessed from within a web browser. The overall use of FTP to transfer files is minimal compared to a decade 
ago, but the senders still exist in abundance. I prefer the manual method of searching Google for FTP 
information. As mentioned earlier, Google and Bing index most publicly available data on FTP servers. A
This type of submission wall be much more reliable than counting on the proxy to conduct your search and 
return an additional proxy-delivered page. An alternative to Not Evil is Haystack, which can be accessed at 
http://haystak5njsmn2hqkewecpaxetahtwhsbsa64jom2k22z5afxhnpxfid.onion. Similar to the previous query, 
we can search this Tor sendee without the Tor browser with the following standard URL.
http:// haystak5njsmn2hqkewecpaxetahtwhsbsa64jom2k22z5afxhnpxfid.onion.ly/?q=osint
I have also had limited success with Tor66 at the following URL.
http://tor66sewebgixw'hcqfhp5inzp5x5uohhdy3kvtnyfxc2e5mxiuh34iid.onion
All of the options presented within these pages are available for automatic queries within your custom search 
tool, as presented in a moment. Please note that these sites appear, disappear, and reappear often.

Manually changing the last "01" to "02" loads the second chapter of the book. However, it is easier to eliminate 
the document name altogether and browse the directory titled "cisco". The first of the following addresses 
displays the contents of that folder, while the second displays the content of the "pub" folder. Copy these directly 
into a web browser to see the results.
This type of manual navigation will often reveal numerous publicly available documents that traditional searches 
withhold. I have located extremely sensitive files hosted by companies, government agencies, and the military. 
Most File Transfer Protocol (FTP) servers have been indexed by Google, but there are other third-party options 
that are worth exploring. At the end of each description, I identify the number of results included for the search 
"Cisco" "PDF".
This FTP search engine often provides content that is very recent. After each result, it displays the date that the 
data was last confirmed at the disclosed location. This can help locate relevant information that is still present 
on a server. While it generated the most results of all four services, many of them were no longer available on 
the target FTP servers. Some could be reconstructed with cached copies, but not all.
The result will include only files from ftp servers (inurkftp); will exclude any web pages (-inurl: (http | https); and 
mandate that the term "confidential" is present (""). I have located many sensitive documents from target 
companies with this query. The above search yielded 107,000 FTP results. However, these specific hits are not 
the only valuable data to pursue. Consider the following example. I want to locate PDF documents stored on 
FTP servers that contain "cisco" within the tide or content, and I conduct the following search on Google.
custom search string will be required in order to filter unwanted information. If I were 
including the term "confidential" in the tide, I would conduct the following search on
This results in 20,000 options within multiple FTP servers hosted on numerous domains. The first result is 
hosted on the Southwest Cyberport FTP server and connects to a PDF document at the following address. It 
appears to be a chapter of a textbook.
This Russian FTP server allows you to isolate search results by the country that is hosting the content. This is 
likely determined by IP address. While most of the filtered results will be accurate, 1 recommend searching 
through the global results before dismissing any foreign options. My favorite feature of this engine is the "Search 
within results" option. After conducting my search, I checked this option and my search field was cleared. I 
entered "router" and clicked search again. I was prompted with die 436 results widiin my original hits that also 
included the word router. While this could have been replicated manually, I appreciate the option.
For comparison, Google found 19,600 results for inurkftp -inurl:(http | https) "Cisco" "PDF".

Nerdy Data (nerdydata.com/reports/new)
166 Chapter 9
In later chapters, you will learn about free services that try to identify additional websites that may be associated 
with your target website. The backbone of these services relies on the indexing of programming data of websites. 
Nerdy Data may be the purest way of searching for this data. If you were to look at the source code of one of 
my previous websites (no longer online), you would have seen at the bottom that 1 used a service called Google 
Analytics. This senice identifies die number of visitors to a website and the general area where they are located. 
The following is the actual code that was present.
Google, Bing, and other search engines search the content of websites. They focus on the data that is visually 
present within a web page. Nerdy Data searches the programming code of a website. This code is often not 
visible to the end user and exists within the HTML codeJavaScript, and CSS files with which most users are 
not familiar. This code can be extremely valuable to research in some scenarios. Viewing the source code of a 
website can be done by right-clicking on the background of a page and selecting "View Source". The following 
two examples should explain a small portion of the possibilities with this service.
Many web designers and programmers steal code from other websites. In the past, this would be very difficult 
to identify without already knowing the suspect website. With Nerdy Data, you can perform a search of the code 
of concern and identify websites that possess the data within their own source code. In 2013,1 located a custom 
search website at the \ GN Ethical Hacker Group that inspired me to create my own similar search service. I 
wras curious if there were any other search websites that possessed this basic code that might give me more ideas. 
I looked at the source code of the website and located a small piece of code that appeared fairly unique to that 
service. I conducted a search on Nerdy Data for the following code.
http://yehg.net/q?[keyword]&c=[category] (q?yehg.net&c=Recon)
This code was within the JavaScript programming of the search website. The search results identified 13 w'ebsites 
that also possessed the same code. Two of these results were hosted on the creator’s website, and offered no 
additional information. Three of the results linked to pages that were no longer available. Three of the results 
linked to pages that were only discussing the code within the target website and how to improve the functionality. 
However, four of the results identified similar search services that were also using the programming code 
searched. This revealed new search services that were related to the website in which I was interested.
This Chinese service is less robust than the previous options, but it should not be ignored. In 2020, I was 
searching for documents in reference to an international fraud investigation. This was the only service which 
presented contracts signed by my target.
The important data here is the "UA-8231004-3". That was my unique number for Google Analytics. Any website 
with which I used the service would have needed to have that number within the source code of the page. If 
you searched that number on Nerdy Data a few years prior, you would have received interesting results. Nerdy 
Data previously' identified three websites that were using that number, including computercrimeinfo.com and 
two additional sites that I maintained for a law firm. You can often find valuable information within the source 
code of your target’s website.

This same technique could be used to identify websites that arc stealing proprietary’ code; locate pages that were 
created to attempt to fool a victim into using a cloned site; or validate the popularity’ of a specific programming 
function being used on hacking websites globally.
At this point, y’ou may’ be overwhelmed with the abundance of search options. I can relate to that, and I do not 
take advantage of every’ option during every’ investigation. During my initial search of a target, I like to rely on 
the basics. 1 first search Google, Bing, Yandex, and the smaller search engines. In order to assist with this initial 
search, I created a custom tool that will allow you to quickly get to the basics. Figure 9.10 displays the current 
state of this option, which is included in the search tools archive mentioned previously.
