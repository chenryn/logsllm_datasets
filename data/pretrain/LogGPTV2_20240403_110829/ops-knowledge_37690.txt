User: How to check the resources occupied by a process on the server and optimize it?
Assistant: 1. Use the top and htop commands to observe process resource usage. The top command can be used to view the processes running in the system and the resources they occupy. They can be sorted according to CPU, memory, and running time. The htop command can display process resource usage more intuitively, including CPU usage, memory usage, process status, etc. 2. Use the ps command to obtain detailed process information. The ps command can obtain detailed process information, including process ID, parent process ID, execution path, occupied memory, running time, etc., which can be used to locate process exceptions and optimize process resource occupation. 3. Use the lsof command to view open files and network connections. The lsof command can list open files and network connection information in the system, including process details, open file descriptors, etc., which can be used to check whether a process uses file resources abnormally, and Optimize network connection. 4. Use the strace command to track process system calls The strace command can track the activities of the process at the system call level, including reading and writing files, network communication, memory management, etc., and can be used to locate process performance bottlenecks and exceptions. 5. Increase the resource limit and optimize the configuration to adjust according to the resource usage, such as increasing the CPU time allocation of the process, memory limit, etc. At the same time, it should also be optimized in conjunction with the business scenario of the process, such as optimizing the database connection pool, increasing the process thread pool, etc. Measures to maximize process performance.
