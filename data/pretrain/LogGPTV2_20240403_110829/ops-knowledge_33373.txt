User: I work on a system and the hosting guys don't want to use an install script that uses pip. Now we have a large pip requirements file that install the dependencies. Is there any other way to do it than using pip? Can it be done using yum or apt-get ? We are using Linux.
Assistant: For god's sake, please do not fall back to using the distribution's package manager just because your hosting guys do not understand what pip+virtualenv is good for.
Python packages in Linux distribution repositories are often outdated and may come with quirks that other Python package authors did not plan for. This is especially true for Python packages with compiled code. If a documentation tells you that a certain dependency should be obtained directly from PyPI via pip, then you better follow that requirement. Convince your hosting guys to use the right tools, namely pip combined with virtualenv. The latter will create an isolated environment and make sure that the system will stay clean (really, nobody needs to do a sudo pip install, which probably is the thing your hosting guys are afraid of).
