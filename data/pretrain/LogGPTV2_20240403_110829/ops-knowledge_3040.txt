User: I generally use Python 2.7 but recently installed Python 3.5 using Miniconda on Mac OS X. Different libraries have been installed for these two versions of python. Now, the entering either of the keywords 'python' or 'python3' in terminal invokes python 3.5, and 'python2' returns '-bash: python2: command not found'. How can I now invoke them specifically using aliases 'python2' and 'python3' respectively?
I am currently using OS X El Capitan.
Assistant: I just follow up the answer from @John Wilkey.
My alias python used to represent python2.7 (located in /usr/bin).
However the default python_path is now preceded by /usr/local/bin for python3; hence when typing python, I didn't get either the python version.
I tried make a link in /usr/local/bin for python2:
ln -s /usr/bin/python /usr/local/bin/
It works when calling python for python2.
