User: Please provide a Docker-based web application deployment solution
Assistant: The following is a Docker-based web application deployment solution: 1. Prepare the environment to install Docker and Docker Compose. 2. Write a Dockerfile Write a Dockerfile to specify the image of the application. 3. Write docker-compose.yml Write a docker-compose.yml file to define the service. Here are several key parameters that need to be set, such as startup commands, port mapping, dependencies, etc., and configure them according to actual needs. 4. Build the image Execute the following command to build the image: docker-compose build 5. Start the container Execute the following command to start the container: docker-compose up -d 6. Verify the IP and mapped port of the deployment access service to ensure that the service has started. 7. Manage containers Use docker-compose to stop, restart, delete or view container status and logs. In this way, Docker-based web application deployment can be completed. Note that the specific deployment plan needs to be planned in combination with business requirements, environment, security and other aspects.
