User: You want to access your server from another machine, but the firewall has set a rule that prohibits external access, please provide a solution.
Assistant: Port forwarding technology can be used to realize the solution of external access to the internal server. The specific steps are as follows: 1. Set port forwarding rules on the firewall to forward the externally requested port to the corresponding port on the server. 2. Modify the firewall rules of the server to allow external IP to access the port of the server. 3. If there is a public network IP, you need to perform port mapping in the router to map the externally requested port to the corresponding port on the firewall. 4. Use the public IP of the server and the forwarded port number to access it on another machine. It should be noted that port forwarding will increase network security risks, and it is recommended to take necessary security measures when using it.
