User: hi everybody
i wanna take a dir from one directory and os doesn't allow me to do this work(for example /etc/openvpn in linux) and i know i should be root but i don't know how can i do this with python.
Assistant: you have to start the process as root.  You can run "sudo yourscript.py" as your normal user account or log in as root or run "su -" to become root and then run your script.
Your script cannot obtain root privileges after it starts running.  That's just not how unix/linux systems work.
