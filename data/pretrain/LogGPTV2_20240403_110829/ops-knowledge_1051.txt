User: I have two applications, written on twisted framework, for example one using twisted.web, and other using twisted.protocols.*, not web. How can I "merge" them in one, effectively sharing one reactor for both apps?
What are the best practices for that tasks? Actually I need to connect SIPSimpleApp and TornadoWeb. They both can use twisted reactor.
Assistant: So far I found, that if you merge two twisted applications, you should remove reactor.run() from one of them, leaving only one reactor.run() in the end. And be sure that twisted.reactor implementation is same for both applications.
More comments welcome.
