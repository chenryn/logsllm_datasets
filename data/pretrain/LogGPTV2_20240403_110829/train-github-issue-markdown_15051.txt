I think the title is quite self-explanatory. Steps to reproduce this are:
    wget http://openml.liacs.nl/data/download/29/dataset_29_credit-a.arff
    python -m scipy.io.arff.arffread dataset_29_credit-a.arff
The problematic lines in the .arff file are 578 and 579, and in scipy 600-606.
The problem is that scipy first checks if a line is a comment, then it
iterates until it finds a non-comment line. Next it checks if a line is empty,
and iterates until it finds a non-empty line. Then, it does not check if this
non-empty line is a comment. Changing lines 600-606 to
    for raw in row_iter:
            while r_comment.match(raw) or r_empty.match(raw)::
                raw = next(row_iter)
            row = raw.split(delim)
            yield tuple([convertors[i](row[i]) for i in elems])
would fix this problem. I benchmarked this on an .arff file with MNIST data
(240MB, 70000 lines, 785 attributes). The old, broken version took took an
average of 21.166 seconds (10 runs), the fixed one seems to be a bit faster,
taking only 19.6645 seconds.
If you consider this as a bug, I am willing to provide a pull request
including a fix.
