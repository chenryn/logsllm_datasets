- **MCU**: Coordinates the firing process.
- **Firing Pin**: Aligns with the hole, allowing the gun to fire.
- **View**: Longitudinal perspective.

## Patent Information
- **US Patent 8,966,803**.

## Weapon Overview
- **Actual Weapon**: Detailed view.
- **Electromagnet**: Top view of the receiver.
- **Mechanism in Slide**: Contains ferrous material.
- **Cam**: Presses on the mechanism.
- **Profile and Bottom Views**: Detailed views of the slide.

## Mechanical Attack
- **Method**: Use a strong magnet.
- **Application**: Place the magnet next to the pistol to replace the electromagnet.
- **Strength Considerations**: Needs to be strong but not too strong to avoid stopping all movement.
- **Recommended Magnets**: Three N52 neodymium magnets, 1.25” diameter, 0.2” height.

## Magnet Attack
- **MCU**: Longitudinal view.
- **External Magnet**: Pulls the ferrous material, unblocking the firing pin, allowing the gun to fire.

## Magnet Specifications
- **Type**: N52 neodymium magnets.
- **Dimensions**: 32 mm x 5 mm.
- **Cost**: $19 for a four-pack (only three required).
- **Total Cost**:
  - Magnets: $14.75
  - Scrap dowel: $0.20
  - Stainless screw: $0.05
  - Total: $15

## Completed Magnet Tool
- **Alignment**: Specific alignment for optimal performance.

## Magnet Attack Results
- **Effectiveness**: Works well, allowing the pistol to fire without the watch or batteries.
- **Caveats**:
  - May prevent the trigger from resetting.
  - Occasional light primer strikes.

## Demonstration
- **Magnet Attack Demo**.

## Defensive Measures
- **Avoidance**: Do not use magnets or solenoids.
- **Alternatives**: Consider motor-driven mechanisms.
- **Detection**: Detect external magnetic fields and activate a secondary lock.

## Lessons for Future Designs
- **Security**: A lock is only as strong as its weakest link.
- **Robust Electronics**: Secure electronics are ineffective if they can be bypassed with a magnet.
- **Future Mechanisms**: Contemplated in Armatix patents; why were they not used?

## Conclusion
- **Thanks!**
- **Updated Slides**: Available on the DEF CON website within a few weeks.
- **Contact**: PI:EMAIL, @_plore

## Backup Slides
- **Available After DEF CON**.

## Armatix iP1 Overview
- **Design**: Custom semi-auto pistol.
- **Cartridge**: .22 LR.
- **Firing Mechanism**: Hammer-fired.
- **Introduction**: Around 2015.
- **Authorization**: "Smart" via a paired wristwatch.

## Field Strip
- **Pistol Field Strip**.

## Size Comparison
- **Glock 17, Armatix iP1, Ruger SR22**.

## Internal Design
- **Microcontroller**: MSP430.
- **Transceiver**: Murata TR1000, 916.5 MHz, OOK modulation.
- **NFC Coil**: Ferrite-core.
- **FCC Database**: Interior photos and EMC test results.

## Unlock Sequence
- **Pistol Chirp**: 5.35 kHz CW for 1.5 ms.
- **Watch Response**: Sends unlock code on 916.5 MHz.
- **Pistol ACK**: 100 ms later.
- **LED Indicators**:
  - Green: Authenticated, ready to fire.
  - Red: Not authenticated, cannot fire.

## Operation Overview
- **Pairing**: Watch and pistol with a long PIN.
- **Synchronization**: Time-dependent auth tokens, frequent sync due to clock drift.
- **Activation**: 5-digit PIN, valid for 2-8 hours.
- **Firing Process**:
  - Squeeze pistol backstrap.
  - Pistol sends chirp to watch.
  - Watch sends auth code.
  - Firing pin unblocked.

## Communication Details
- **Modulation**: OOK, Manchester coding.
- **Data Rate**: 30 kbit/s raw, 2 kbytes/s net.
- **Checksum**: 8-bit.
- **Frame Sizes**:
  - Watch to pistol: 19 bytes.
  - Pistol to watch: 13 bytes.

## Spectrum Analysis
- **Watch and Pistol Signals**: 916.5 MHz.
- **Signal Strength**: -40 dBm.

## Proximity Defeat
- **Relay Method**:
  - First device: Detects 5.35 kHz chirp, sends indication over backhaul.
  - Second device: Generates 5.35 kHz chirp near watch.
  - Watch sends auth token, 916.5 MHz reply strong enough for at least 3 m.
- **Results**:
  - Reliable up to 3 m.
  - Latency: 630 us.
  - Limit: 916.5 MHz radio link.

## Hardware for Proximity Defeat
- **Pulse Listener**:
  - Tuned coil, 5.35 kHz bandpass filter/amplifier, microcontroller, 2.4 GHz transmitter.
- **Pulse Generator**:
  - Tuned coil, microcontroller, Class C amplifier, 2.4 GHz receiver.

## Interference Sensitivity
- **OOK Modulation**: Highly susceptible to interference.
- **Signal Strength**: -40 dBm at 10 cm, TX power about -20 dBm.
- **Interference Threshold**: -50 dBm at pistol to prevent reception.

## Theory
- **Carrier Effects**: Constant carrier effective up to 1 m.
- **Pulsed Carrier**:
  - Short range: Strong pulse sets slicer level too high.
  - Mid range: High bit interference.
  - Long range: Prevents packet/byte sync.

## Transmitter Output
- **Unmodulated and Modulated Spectra**.

## Electronic Attacks
- **Impersonation and Replay Attacks**: Investigated but not detailed.

## Mechanical Operation
- **Hammer**: Always falls.
- **Firing Pin**: Blocked unless authorized.
- **Authorization**: Electromagnet energized when backstrap pulled.
- **Trigger Half-Pull**: Moves cam, partially unblocks firing pin.
- **Ferrous Material**: Pulled by electromagnet, fully unblocks firing pin.

## Additional Notes
- **Retail Packaging**: Magnets can be used without removing them from packaging.
- **Firing Pin Visibility**: Visible through inspection port after successful bypass or normal authorization.

## Tools for Reverse Engineering
- **Government Resources**:
  - Patents: Detailed drawings and explanations.
