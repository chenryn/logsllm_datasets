systems to organizations, since non functional aspects of workflows can be described.
The model is predictive. Based on the QoS of workflow components (tasks), the QoS of
workflows (networks) can be automatically computed. This feature is important,
especially for large processes which in some cases may contain hundreds of tasks. We
present a mathematical model that formally describes the formulae to compute QoS
metrics among workflow tasks. Based on these formulae, we have developed an
algorithm (SWR algorithm) to automatically compute the overall QoS of a workflow.
The algorithm applies a set of reduction rules to a workflow, until only one task remains
which represents the QoS for the entire workflow. We also describe how a simulation
system can be used with a workflow system to carry out efficient workflow QoS
simulations.
To test the validity of our QoS model and of our mathematical model we have
deployed a set of production workflows in the area of genetics (Fungal Genome Resource
laboratory). We have executed several workflow instances and the generated QoS data
have been collected and analyzed. The analysis of the data corroborates our initial
hypothesis which states that our QoS model and mathematical model give a suitable
framework to predict and analyze the QoS of production workflows.

3.1 ABSTRACT
Workflow management systems (WfMSs) have been used to support various types of
business processes. As organizations adopt new working models, such as e-commerce,
new challenges arise for workflow systems. One such challenge is that of quality of
service (QoS) management. QoS management includes mechanisms that specify,
compute, monitor, and control the quality of service of the products or services to be
delivered. A good management of QoS directly impacts the success of organizations
participating in e-commerce activities by better fulfilling cusotmer expectations and
achieving customer satisfaction. In this paper we present an implementation of a
comprehensive QoS model for workflows we have specified earlier. While the
implementation is being carried out for the METEOR workflow system, the ideas
presented here can also be applied to other workflow systems. In this work we describe
the components that have been changed, or added, and discuss how they interact to
enable the specification, computation, and monitoring of QoS .
3.2 INTRODUCTION
Organizations are constantly seeking new and innovative information systems to better
fulfill their missions and strategic goals. The use of workflow Management Systems
(WfMSs) allows organizations to streamline and automate business processes and
reengineer their structure, as well as increase efficiency and reduce costs. Workflow
systems are also a valuable asset for managing e-commerce applications that span
multiple organizations (Sheth, Aalst et al. 1999). As the number of online services
increases, workflow systems are needed to coordinate and manage the interaction among
Web services (Berners-Lee 2001; Fensel and Bussler 2002).
Organizations operating in modern markets, such as e-commerce, require systematic
design, planning, control, and management of business processes. One particular
92
important aspect is the quality of service (QoS) management. Products and services with
well-defined specifications must be available to customers. This is especially important
since when using the Internet to trade goods, customers do not have a tangible access to
the products to be delivered. A good management of quality leads to the creation of
quality products and services, which in turn fulfill customer expectations and achieve
