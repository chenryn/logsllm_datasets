Hello.
I read
https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/introduction/ios_install/ios_install.html#ios-
installation for iOS development.
"sudo ln -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer Developer" fails on
macOS Catalina as below.
    ln: Developer: Read-only file system
Are there any workarounds?
Thanks.
