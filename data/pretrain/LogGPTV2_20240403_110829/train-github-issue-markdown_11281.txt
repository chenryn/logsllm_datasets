Hello,

I recently read the OpenCV iOS installation guide available at [this link](https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/introduction/ios_install/ios_install.html#ios-installation) for iOS development. When attempting to execute the following command on macOS Catalina:

```bash
sudo ln -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer Developer
```

I encountered the following error:

```bash
ln: Developer: Read-only file system
```

Are there any known workarounds for this issue?

Thank you.
