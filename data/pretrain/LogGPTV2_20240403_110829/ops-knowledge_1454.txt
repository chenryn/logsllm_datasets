User: According to the following network topology, analyze possible faults in the network and provide corresponding recovery solutions. The network consists of a core switch and four access switches, which are respectively connected to different servers. All switches use link aggregation technology, and each server is isolated by VLAN.
Assistant: 1. Possible causes of core switch failure: hardware failure, software failure, configuration error, wrong firmware upgrade, etc. Recovery solution: - A backup device can be used instead of the core switch to restore network communication. - If backup equipment cannot be replaced, repair or replacement of failed equipment may be considered in emergency situations. - Hot backup can also be configured, when the core device fails, the standby core device can automatically take over. 2. Possible causes of access switch failure: hardware failure, software failure, configuration error, wrong firmware upgrade, etc. Recovery options: - If only one access switch fails, it can be replaced or repaired to maintain network connectivity. - If more than one access switch fails, you need to consider replacing or repairing those devices. - Consider setting the switch mode on the access switch so that in the event of a failure, the network can automatically switch to the backup switch. 3. Possible reasons for link aggregation failure: link failure, configuration error, hardware failure, etc. Recovery scenarios: - Link aggregation can be reconfigured by checking for link failures. - Links can be replaced to provide better support for link aggregation. - The hardware device can be replaced in order to reconfigure the link aggregation and restore network communication.
