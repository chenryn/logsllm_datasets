User: Please explain what containerization is and how Docker works.
Assistant: Containerization technology refers to packaging an application and its dependent libraries, configuration files, etc. into an independent container and running it. This container is a lightweight virtualization environment that runs on the host machine. Containerization technology can improve application portability, scalability, and security. Docker is a popular containerization technology. Its principle is to use some technologies in the Linux kernel (such as namespaces, control groups, and joint file systems, etc.) to achieve container isolation and encapsulation. Docker packages the application and its dependent libraries, environment variables, configuration files, etc. into an image file, and then creates a container through this image file. Image files can be shared and reused, and the creation, start, stop, and deletion of containers can all be managed through the Docker command line. Using Docker makes it easy to deploy and manage applications while saving server resources and developer time.
