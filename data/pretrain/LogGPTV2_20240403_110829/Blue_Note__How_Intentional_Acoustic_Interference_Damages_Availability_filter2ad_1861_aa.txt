Abstract—Intentional acoustic interference causes unusual
errors in the mechanics of magnetic hard disk drives in desktop
and laptop computers,
leading to damage to integrity and
availability in both hardware and software such as ﬁle system
corruption and operating system reboots. An adversary without
any special purpose equipment can co-opt built-in speakers or
nearby emitters to cause persistent errors. Our work traces the
deeper causality of these risks from the physics of materials to the
I/O request stack in operating systems for audible and ultrasonic
sound. Our experiments show that audible sound causes the
head stack assembly to vibrate outside of operational bounds;
ultrasonic sound causes false positives in the shock sensor, which
is designed to prevent a head crash.
The problem poses a challenge for legacy magnetic disks that
remain stubbornly common in safety critical applications such
as medical devices and other highly utilized systems difﬁcult to
sunset. Thus, we created and modeled a new feedback controller
that could be deployed as a ﬁrmware update to attenuate the
intentional acoustic interference. Our sensor fusion method pre-
vents unnecessary head parking by detecting ultrasonic triggering
of the shock sensor.

INTRODUCTION
Availability is the most important security property of
a consumer hard disk drive (HDD). Without availability, it
is difﬁcult to meaningfully consider preservation of security
properties such as conﬁdentiality and integrity. Our work
explores to what extent an adversary can intentionally damage
HDDs with malicious audible and inaudible acoustic waves
(Figure 1) and what are the limits of defenses.
Magnetic HDDs remain common [1] because of the long
tail of legacy systems and the relatively inexpensive cost for
high capacity storage. However, sudden movement can damage
the hard drive or corrupt data because of the tight operating
constraints on the read/write head(s) and disk(s). Thus, modern
drives use shock sensors to detect such movement and safely
park the read/write head. Previous research has indicated that
loud audible sounds, such as shouting or ﬁre alarms, can cause
drive components to vibrate, disturbing throughput [2], [3],
[4], [5]. Audible sounds can even cause HDDs to become
unresponsive [6].
What remains a mystery is how and why intentional
vibration causes bizarre malfunctions in HDDs and undeﬁned

sustained, intentional vibration at resonant frequencies can
cause permanent data loss, program crashes, and unrecoverable
physical loss in HDDs from three different vendors (Figure
2). We also propose, simulate, and implement several defenses
against such attacks on HDDs. Moreover, our research addresses
the gap in knowledge in how ultrasound affects HDDs by trig-
gering the sensor, a different causality from audible interference.
Our contributions explore the physics of cybersecurity [7] for
availability and integrity of systems that depend on hard disk
drives:
•
Physical Causality: How intentional audible and
ultrasonic sounds cause physical errors in hard disk
drives.
System Consequences: How intentional physical er-
rors in the hard disk drive lead to system level errors.
Defenses: We simulate, implement, and propose de-
fenses that can prevent damage to availability.

park its head. Audible tones can vibrate the read/write head(s)
and disk outside of operational bounds. Both of these different
methods result in improper function of the drive.
System Consequences: Our case studies show that an
attacker can use the effects from hard disk drive vulnerabilities
to launch system level consequences such as crashing Windows
on a laptop using the built-in speaker and preventing surveil-
lance systems from recording video. We delve into the details
of the Windows and Linux operating systems to uncover the
root causes of the crash in the I/O request stack.
Defenses: We simulate, discuss, and implement defenses
against both hard disk drive vulnerabilities. In our simulation,
we show how a new feedback controller can attenuate the
physical effect on the head stack assembly. We implement
and evaluate noise attenuating materials as a defense. Finally,
we propose sensor fusion as a means to detect malicious
acoustic signals, allowing the drive to operate when attacked
by ultrasonic signals.
II. BACKGROUND
A. Threat Model
Our work assumes an adversary that uses vibration to
interfere with a HDD on a target machine, typically induced
through use of a speaker. The adversary may catalog frequencies
that are most effective for a given model of hard drive to speed
up the attack. We foresee two distinct types of delivery: a self
stimulation attack [8] and a physical proximity attack.
Self-Stimulated Attacks.
An adversary can attack a
HDD by inducing vibration via acoustic emitters built into the
victim system (or a nearby system). In this case an adversary
would temporarily control an emitter in the system though
some means. The attack is more likely to succeed when the
emitter is powerful and/or very close to the victim.
A self-stimulated attack may use a standard phishing attack,
malicious email, or malicious javascript to deliver audio to a
laptop’s speakers. Most laptops have speakers and the ability to
browse the Internet. Modern browsers support JavaScript and
HTML5, both of which are capable of playing audio without
user permission. Therefore, should a victim visit a page owned
by the attacker, the attacker would be able to play audio over
the victim’s speakers.
Fig. 3. Acoustics disturb the HDD head stack assembly and shock sensor.
Modern HDDs use sensor-driven feedforward controllers to adjust the head’s
position. Our work ﬁnds that ultrasonic vibration triggers false positives for
head parking; audible tones vibrate the head—causing poor positioning.
The frequency response of a built-in speaker may limit the
ability for an adversary to deliver ultrasonic attacks, but some
speakers may be able to deliver ultrasonic or near ultrasonic
tones.
Physical Proximity Attacks. An attacker can induce
vibration using a speaker near the victim system. The attacker
must either control a speaker close to the victim HDD, or
place a speaker in the proximity of the system. The case of
controlling a speaker close to the victim HDD is similar to that
of the self-stimulated attack. An example of this would be the
attacker controlling an AM or FM station of a radio playing
sound near the victim HDD with the desired signal.
When the attacker is able to physically place the speaker,
the attacker can choose a speaker with the desired frequency
range (audible, near ultrasound, or ultrasound). In addition, the
attacker can choose non-traditional acoustic emitters that may
beamform signals to attack a drive from long distance. A Long
Range Acoustic Device (LRAD) can send audible acoustic
waves above 95 dB SPL miles away in open air [9].
B. Hard Disks and Acoustics
Acoustics vibrate the HDD head stack assembly and shock
sensor, leading to throughput loss and physical damage.
Hard Disk Mechanics. A HDD read/write head ﬂoats
(∼10 nm) above the surface of each spinning disk. Data is
organized in tracks that circle the disk. To read or write data,
the head stack assembly (HSA) must position the head above
the desired track. There is a narrow margin of error (on the
scale of nm) within which the read/write head can operate. For
writes, there is a narrower margin of 10% of the width of the
track, while there is a 15% margin for reads [10].
Vibration poses problems for HDD designers. First, vibra-
tion may push the head away from the center of the track and
render the drive temporarily unable to write. Second, the head
may crash into the surface of the platter, physically damaging
the disk and leading to possible data loss.
Compensating for Vibration.
Two approaches can
correct for positional error due to vibration (Figure 3): (1)
a standard feedback controller that adjusts the head position
using the current positional offset of the head from the center

using a G.R.A.S. Type 26CB microphone, a G.R.A.S. 12AL
preampliﬁer, and a PicoScope 5444B.

frequencies using a Keysight N5172B EXG X-Series RF Vector
Signal Generator, a CRY584 Power Ampliﬁer, and a NU C
Series Ultrasonic Sensor. The setup measures the emitter’s
actual output using a CRY343 microphone and a RIGOL
DS4022 oscilloscope.
C. Measuring the Effects of Vibration
The effects of vibration on HDDs during operation are
typically: (1) throughput loss, (2) program crashing when using
the HDD, and (3) writes or reads taking an indeﬁnite amount of
time to return (even if the acoustic interference subsides in the
middle of the write). The challenge is ensuring the measurement
program is not affected by the effects it is monitoring. Our
measurement program is shown in Algorithm 1.
The testing computer measures throughput using writes to
the victim disk via the Linux dd utility with the fdatasync
option. dd is a well known and tested tool for basic throughput
measurement. The testing computer writes 1MB of pseudo-
random data directly to a pseudorandom location on the disk
to avoid caching that may speed up the write process. The
fdatasync option forces dd to wait for each block of data
to be physically written to disk before writing the next block.
tested, dd often crashes or hangs
indeﬁnitely during use. By monitoring dd in a separate process,
errors can be quickly intercepted and logged.
