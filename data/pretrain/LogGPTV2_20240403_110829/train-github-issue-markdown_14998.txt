I have installed a number of modules system-wide under
`/usr/share/julia/environments/v1.0` using a Linux distribution package
https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/julia-ijulia/
With Julia 1.0.2 these packages are detected and loaded, e.g.:
    $ strace -f -estat julia
    ...
    julia> using IJulia
    [pid 30509] stat("/home/jonathon/.julia/environments/v1.0", 0x7ffdf6e551e0) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
    [pid 30509] stat("/usr/local/share/julia/environments/v1.0", 0x7ffdf6e551e0) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
    [pid 30509] stat("/usr/share/julia/environments/v1.0", {st_mode=S_IFDIR|0755, st_size=242, ...}) = 0
    [pid 30509] stat("/usr/share/julia/environments/v1.0/JuliaProject.toml", 0x7ffdf6e551e0) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
    [pid 30509] stat("/usr/share/julia/environments/v1.0/Project.toml", 0x7ffdf6e551e0) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
    [pid 30509] stat("/usr/share/julia/environments/v1.0", {st_mode=S_IFDIR|0755, st_size=242, ...}) = 0
    [pid 30509] stat("/usr/share/julia/environments/v1.0/JuliaProject.toml", 0x7ffdf6e55340) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
    [pid 30509] stat("/usr/share/julia/environments/v1.0/Project.toml", 0x7ffdf6e55340) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
    [pid 30509] stat("/usr/share/julia/environments/v1.0/IJulia.jl", 0x7ffdf6e55340) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
    [pid 30509] stat("/usr/share/julia/environments/v1.0/IJulia/src/IJulia.jl", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=12461, ...}) = 0
    ...
Note that it looks under the path
`/usr/share/julia/environments/v1.0/IJulia/src/IJulia.jl`.
With 1.0.3 this fails:

    ERROR: ArgumentError: Package IJulia not found in current path:
    - Run `import Pkg; Pkg.add("IJulia")` to install the IJulia package.
Note that it no longer looks in subdirectories under the path
`/usr/share/julia/environments/v1.0/`.
I am currently investigating `eb8a933` and `71748da` as potentially related
but I don't really know if they are.
