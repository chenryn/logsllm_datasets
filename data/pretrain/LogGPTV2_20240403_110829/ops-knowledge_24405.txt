Question: Alice is setting up an RSA signature scheme for her secure messaging application. She needs to generate keys, sign messages, and allow receivers to verify the signatures. Based on the RSA signature scheme outlined in the text, which of the following statements are true regarding the setup and functionality of Alice's RSA signature scheme?
"A": "Alice should select two 1024-bit primes p and q, where both are congruent to 2 modulo 3, to form the public key n = pq.",
"B": "To sign a message M, Alice will use the signing algorithm Sign_d(M) = H(M)^3 mod n.",
"C": "The verification algorithm will output 'true' if and only if H(M) equals S cubed modulo n, where S is the signature of message M.",
"D": "If the private key d is compromised, it becomes computationally feasible for an attacker to compute cube roots modulo n, thus breaking the security of the signature scheme."
Answer: ACD
