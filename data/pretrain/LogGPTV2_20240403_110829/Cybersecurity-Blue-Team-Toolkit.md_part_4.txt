submarines or bats, then you\'re probably geekier like me.
Packet InterNet Groper, or what we affectionately call *ping*, is a
networking utility. It is used to test whether a host is "alive" on an
Internet Protocol (IP) network. A host is a computer or other device
that is connected to a network. It will measure the time it takes for a
message sent from one host to reach another and echo back to the
original host. Bats are able to use *echo‐location*, or bio sonar, to
locate and identify objects. We do the same in our networked
environments.
Ping will send an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo request
to the target and wait for a reply. This will report problems, trip
time, and packet loss if the asset has a heartbeat. If the asset is not
alive, you will get back an ICMP error. The command‐line option for ping
is easy to use no matter what operating system you are using and comes
with multiple options such as the size of the packet, how many requests,
and time to live (TTL) in seconds. This field is decremented at each
machine where data is processed. The value in this field will be at
least as great as the number of gateways it has to hop. Once a
connection is made between the two systems, this tool can test the
latency or the delay between them.
[Figure 1.1](#c01.xhtml#c01-fig-0001){#c01.xhtml#R_c01-fig-0001} shows a
running ping on a Windows operating system sending four echo requests to
`www.google.com` using both IPv4 and IPv6.

[]{#c01.xhtml#Page_3 .pagebreak title="3" role="doc-pagebreak"}What this
figure translates to is that my computer can reach through the network
and touch a Google server. The `www.google.com` part of this request is
called a *uniform resource locator* (URL). A URL is the address of a
page on the World Wide Web (WWW). The numbers you see next to the URL is
called an *IP address*. Every device on a network must have a unique IP
network address. If you are attempting to echo‐locate another host, you
could substitute the URL `www.google.com` for an IP address. We will do
a deeper dive on IPv4 and IPv6 in [Chapter 9](../Text/c09.xhtml), Log
Management.
There are more granular `ping` commands. If you type `ping` along with
an option or switch, you can troubleshoot issues that might be occurring
in your network. Sometimes these issues are naturally occurring
problems. Sometimes they could signal some type of attack.
[Table 1.1](#c01.xhtml#c01-tbl-0001){#c01.xhtml#R_c01-tbl-0001} shows

  `/?`         Lists command syntax options.
  `‐t`         Pings the specified host until stopped with Ctrl+C. `ping``‐t` is also known as the *ping of death*. It can be used as a denial‐of‐service (DoS) attack to cause a target machine to crash.
  `‐a`         Resolves address to hostname if possible.
  `‐n count`   How many echo requests to send from 1 to 4.2 billion. (In Windows operating systems, 4 is the default.)
  `‐r count`   Records route for count hops (IPv4 only). The maximum is 9, so if you need more than 9, `tracert` might work better (covered later in the chapter).
  `‐s count`   Timestamp for count hops (IPv4 only).
  `‐i TTL`     Time to live; maximum is 255.

Did you know that you could ping yourself? [Figure
1.2](#c01.xhtml#c01-fig-0002){#c01.xhtml#R_c01-fig-0002} shows that
127.0.0.1 is a special reserved IP address. It is traditionally called a
*loopback address*. When you ping this IP address, you are testing your
own system to make sure it is working properly. If this IP doesn\'t
return an appropriate response, you know the problem is with your
system, not the network, the Internet service provider (ISP), or your
target URL.

What is the name of your host? As you can see in [Figure
1.2](#c01.xhtml#c01-fig-0002), mine is DESKTOP‐OU8N7VK. A hostname is
comprised of alphanumeric characters and possibly a hyphen. There may be
times in the future you know an IP address but not the hostname or you
know a hostname but not the IP address. For certain troubleshooting
steps, you will need to be able to resolve the two on a single machine.

## IPConfig {#c01.xhtml#head-2-3}
The command `ipconfig` is usually the next tool you will pull out of
your toolbox when you\'re networking a system. A lot of valuable
knowledge can be gleaned from this tool.
Internet Protocol is a set of rules that govern how data is sent over
the Internet or another network. This routing function essentially
creates the Internet we know and love.
IP has the function of taking packets from the source host and
delivering them to the proper destination host based solely on the IP
addresses in a packet. The datagram that is being sent has two parts: a
header and a payload. The header has the information needed to get the
information where it should go. The payload is the stuff you want the
other host to have.
In [Lab 1.2](#c01.xhtml#c01-fea-0002){#c01.xhtml#R_c01-fea-0002},
you\'ll use the `ipconfig` command.

Now you have a wealth of information to begin your troubleshooting
hypothesis. In [Figure
1.3](#c01.xhtml#c01-fig-0003){#c01.xhtml#R_c01-fig-0003}, you see the IP
addresses and default gateways for each network adapter on the machine.

[]{#c01.xhtml#Page_6 .pagebreak title="6" role="doc-pagebreak"}To find
your router\'s private IP address, look for the default gateway. Think
of this machine as a literal gateway that you will use to access the
Internet or another network. What tool would you use to make sure that
the router is alive? Why, ping of course!

## THE INTERNET IS DOWN---NOW WHAT? {#c01.xhtml#head-2-5}
::: section
[]{#c01.xhtml#c01-sec-0006}
The Internet is down.
You ping yourself at 127.0.0.1, and everything is fine on your machine.
You ping `www.google.com`, and it times out. You do an `ipconfig /all`
on your host machine. What can you assume if your `ipconfig /all`
command listed the default gateway as being 0.0.0.0? The router!
As an experienced IT person will tell you, the best thing to do is turn
any device off and on again---first your host and then the router. Still
not working? Expand your hypothesis to another host on your
network---can it reach the Internet or the router? Does it pull an IP
address from the router? When you are troubleshooting, it is all about
the scientific method. Form a hypothesis, test, modify, and form a new
hypothesis.

Here are two more acronyms to add to your IT vernacular: DHCP and DNS.
DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. Let\'s isolate each
word.
-   [**Dynamic**: Ever‐changing, fluid]{#c01.xhtml#c01-li-0010}
-   [**Host**: Asset on a network]{#c01.xhtml#c01-li-0011}
-   [**Configuration**: How the asset is supposed to
    work]{#c01.xhtml#c01-li-0012}
-   [**Protocol**: Rules that allow two more assets to
    talk]{#c01.xhtml#c01-li-0013}
DHCP is a network management tool. This is the tool that dynamically
assigns an IP address to a host on a network that lets it talk to other
hosts. Most simply, a router or a gateway can be used to act as a DHCP
server. Most residential routers will get their unique public IP address
from their ISP. This is who you write the check to each month.
In a large enterprise, DHCP is configured on servers to handle large
networks\' IP addressing. DHCP decides which machine gets what IP
address and for how long. If your machine is using DHCP, did you notice
in your `ipconfig /all` command how long your lease was? If you are not
leasing, then you are using a static IP address.
Here are two more commands for you to use if you want a new IP address:
-   [`ipconfig /release`: This releases all IPv4
    addresses.]{#c01.xhtml#c01-li-0014}
-   [`ipconfig /renew`: This retrieves a new IP address, which may take
    a few moments.]{#c01.xhtml#c01-li-0015}
[]{#c01.xhtml#Page_7 .pagebreak title="7" role="doc-pagebreak"}DNS is an
acronym for Domain Name System. This is a naming system for all hosts
that are connected to the Internet or your private network. As you do
what you do on the Internet or in a private network, DNS will remember
domain names. It will store this data in something we call a *cache*
(pronounced "cash"). This is done to speed up subsequent requests to the
same host. Sometimes your DNS cache can get all wonky---sometimes by
accident, sometimes by a hacker.

### NOTE
Cache poisoning---sometimes called *DNS spoofing*---is an attack where a
malicious party corrupts the DNS cache or table, causing the nameserver
to return an incorrect IP address and network traffic to be diverted.
