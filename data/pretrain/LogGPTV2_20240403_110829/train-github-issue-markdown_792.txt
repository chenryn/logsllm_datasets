Bug
**What is the current behavior?**
`webpack2` causes this bug in `redux-form`. I think the reason is two copies
of `SubmissionError` classes are created and can be referenced separately,
causing `instanceof` confusions.
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**
Please see the error demonstration here:
https://github.com/aq1018/webpack2-redux-form-submission-error-weirdness
**What is the expected behavior?**
`instanceof` should return true from instance of classes imported from either
import methods.
**If this is a feature request, what is motivation or use case for changing
the behavior?**
**Please mention other relevant information such as the browser version,
Node.js version, webpack version and Operating System.**
