User: I am developing an App Engine project on Windows using Eclipse and Python 2.5 and Django 0.96. Everything in my app, including Django, is working nicely.
My problems arise when I try to use command line. For example, I'm told that if I want to clear the local datastore I can enter "python manage.py reset" but when I do so the response is "python: can't open file 'manage.py'".
I feel as if I have missed a configuration step. I have checked my system variables and "Path" includes "C:\Python25" (which I had added manually) but nothing Django or App Engine related. My .py extension is associated with C:\Python25\python.exe.
In my quest to solve this, and in trying to understand what manage.py is, I see that I might have had to create a Django project using "django-admin.py startproject [myproject]" but because everything works nicely from Eclipse I'm not sure if this is necessary now. In any case, if I try to enter this from the command line I get "'django-admin.py' is not recognized..."
Please, what am I missing?
Assistant: If you're using Django 0.96 templates within a 'normal' App Engine app, then manage.py isn't involved at all.
/path/to/dev_appserver.py --clear_datastore .
is what you want, assuming you're CD'd to the root of your app.
