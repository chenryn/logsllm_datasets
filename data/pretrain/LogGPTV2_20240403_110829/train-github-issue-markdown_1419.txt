1. Horizontally shrink the page so that the navigation bar collapses into a dropdown menu.
2. Click to open the dropdown menu.
3. While the dropdown menu is still open, stretch the page horizontally again.
4. Reopen the dropdown menu, and you will notice an unsightly scrollbar appearing in the header. To access the dropdown menu, you need to scroll down.

1. Reduce the page width until the navigation bar collapses into a dropdown menu.
2. Open the dropdown menu.
3. With the dropdown menu still open, expand the page width again.
4. Reopen the dropdown menu, and you will see an unwanted scrollbar in the header. To view the dropdown menu, you must scroll down.
