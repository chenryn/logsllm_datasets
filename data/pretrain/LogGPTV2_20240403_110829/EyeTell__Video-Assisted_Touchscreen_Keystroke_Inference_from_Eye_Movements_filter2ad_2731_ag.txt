3) Experiments on Inferring PINs on PIN Keyboard: For
these experiments, a participant input 10 4-digit PINs and 10 6-
digit PINs on an iPhone 6s under task randomization. The PINs
were randomly generated when preparing all the tasks for each
participant. As shown in Table XVI, EyeTell can infer 4-digit
PINs with average top-1, top-5, top-10, and top-50 accuracy up
to 37.5%, 67.2%, 78.0%, and 92.0%, respectively. In addition,
the average top-1, top-5, top-10, and top-50 accuracy on 6-
digit PINs are 38.8%, 68.9%, 81.3%, and 91.0%, respectively.

C. Additional Results on Sentence Inference
Here we show more experimental results on sentence
inference. As mentioned in Section VI-F, we involved four
participants to take part in the experiments on sentence infer-
ence. Table XVII, Table XVIII, and Table XIX show the results
for the other three participants. As we can see, the results for
the four participants are comparable.
