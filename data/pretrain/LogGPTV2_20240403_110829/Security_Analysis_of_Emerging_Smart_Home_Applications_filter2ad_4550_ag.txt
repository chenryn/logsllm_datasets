Question #1
Do you own SmartThings hub(s)?
Answer
Yes
No
Question #2
Imagine that the following battery-powered devices are con-
nected with your SmartThings hub:
1. SmartThings motion sensor
: Triggering an event when motion is detected
2. SmartThings presence sensor
: Triggering an event when the hub detects presence sensors
are nearby
3. Schlage door lock
: Allowing you to remotely lock/unlock and program pin codes
4. FortrezZ siren strobe alarm
: Allowing you to remotely turn on/off siren or strobe alarm
We are evaluating the user experience of installing and using
SmartThings apps. The app we are using in this survey is
a battery monitor app. Below is a screenshot of the battery
monitor app:

APPENDIX D: VENDOR FOLLOWUP RESPONSE
On April 15, 2016, the SmartThings security team followed
up on their initial response and requested us to add the
following message: “While SmartThings explores long-term,
automated, defensive capabilities to address these vulnerabili-
ties, our company had already put into place very effective
measures mentioned below to reduce business risk. Smart-
Things has a dedicated team responsible for reviewing any
existing and new SmartApps. Our immediate mitigation is to
have this team analyze already published and new applications
alike to detect any behavior that exposes HTTP endpoints and
ensure that every method name passed thru HTTP requests
are not invoked dynamically. Our team members also now
examine all web services endpoints to ensure that these are
benign in their operation. SmartThings continues its effort to
enhance the principle of least privilege by limiting the scope
of valid access to only those areas explicitly needed to perform
any given authorized action. Moreover, it is our intention
to update our internal and publicly available documentation
to formalize and enforce this practice using administrative
means.”
