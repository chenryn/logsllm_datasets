**Colin Sampaleanu** opened **SPR-2285** and commented
The bean factory and application context contract clearly states (as per our
docs) that within one definition xml file a bean id must be unique.
This is enforced by the XML parser when using the "id" attribute exclusively
because this is flagged as an XML IDREF attribute. However, by combining the
use of the id attribute and the name attribute, or just using the name
attribute exclusively, it is possible to have 2 or more bean definitions in
the same xml file with the same id. This is silently accepted with the last
bean definition winning out.
The bean definition reader must basically track ids, however they are
supplied, and enforce the same semantics from usage of the "name" attribute as
from usage of the "id" attribute.
A related question is what should happen in the case of ? An argument
could be made either way here.
