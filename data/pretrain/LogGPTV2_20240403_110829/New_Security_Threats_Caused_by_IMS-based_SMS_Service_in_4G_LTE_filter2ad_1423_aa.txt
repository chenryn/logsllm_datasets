ABSTRACT
SMS (Short Messaging Service) is a text messaging service for mo-
bile users to exchange short text messages. It is also widely used to
provide SMS-powered services (e.g., mobile banking). With the
rapid deployment of all-IP 4G mobile networks, the underlying
technology of SMS evolves from the legacy circuit-switched net-
work to the IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) system over packet-
switched network.
In this work, we study the insecurity of the
IMS-based SMS. We uncover its security vulnerabilities and ex-
ploit them to devise four SMS attacks: silent SMS abuse, SMS
spooﬁng, SMS client DoS, and SMS spamming. We further dis-
cover that those SMS threats can propagate towards SMS-powered
services, thereby leading to three malicious attacks: social network
account hijacking, unauthorized donation, and unauthorized sub-
scription. Our analysis reveals that the problems stem from the
loose security regulations among mobile phones, carrier networks,
and SMS-powered services. We ﬁnally propose remedies to the
identiﬁed security issues.

INTRODUCTION
SMS (Short Message Service) is one of the fundamental ser-
vices in mobile networks. It is supported by almost all cellular-
connected mobile devices (7.4 billion devices in 2014). It is not
only used for interpersonal communications, but also employed by
SMS-powered services, which empower companies to reach or/and
authenticate their customers via SMS. They have been used by var-
ious types of industries, such as social network (e.g., Facebook,
Twitter), grocery (e.g., Walmart), airline (e.g., American Airline),

bank (e.g., Chase), apparel (e.g., A&F), courier (e.g., Fedex, UPS)
and instant messaging application (e.g., Whatsapp), to name a few.
The success of the SMS-based approach stems from two rea-
sons. First, the delivery of SMS messages within mobile networks
protects conﬁdentiality and integrity [21]. Though it has some se-
curity issues (e.g., the unauthorized SMS messages sent by the
phone-side malware or the spoofed SMS messages sent from the
Internet), thanks to the efforts of research community and indus-
try [8, 9, 15, 37, 43, 48, 49], they are well addressed in the 2G/3G
networks, at least for the top four largest US carriers. Second,
SMS, a fundamental service of mobile phones, is the most con-
venient way for service providers to reach billions of mobile users.
Since the 4G LTE network supports only packet-switched (PS)
domain, the services of the conventional circuit-switched (CS) do-
main shall be migrated to the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) [1]
over the PS domain. The PS domain is used for the data plane
of mobile networks, whereas the CS domain is mainly for the sig-
naling messages on the control plane. Thus, the underlying tech-
nology of SMS has to shift from the control-plane CS to the data-
plane IMS. At this point, the natural question is: given the dramatic
change of the SMS design in the 4G network, are mobile phones,
carriers’ SMS infrastructures and SMS-powered services as secure
as usual?
Unfortunately, our study yields a negative answer. Our results
show that all of those three parties may suffer from the attacks
caused by the change of underlying security semantics.
In par-
ticular, 28 out of the 40 SMS-powered services (summarized in
Table 2) which we choose from some big companies of various in-
dustries, are vulnerable to SMS security threats. Due to space limit
and similarity, we do not list other studied SMS-powered services
from USPS, Dollar Tree, ZipCar, Weather.com, etc.
Speciﬁcally, we devise four attacks based on the vulnerabilities
of the IMS-based SMS: silent SMS abuse, SMS spooﬁng, SMS
client DoS, and SMS spamming towards IMS. The victims of the
ﬁrst three attacks are mobile users, whereas those of the last at-
tack are carriers. We further discover that those vulnerabilities can
be exploited to launch three major attacks against SMS-powered
services: social network account hijacking, unauthorized donation,
and unauthorized subscription. Table 1 summarizes our ﬁndings.
Note that our presumed attack model is relatively simple: the at-
tacker uses only commodity smartphones and has no control of car-
rier networks. Moreover, we evaluate those attacks in a responsible
and controlled manner (i.e., the victims are only the participants of
this project).

Table 1: Summary of our main ﬁndings on IMS-based SMS vulnerabilities and proof-of-concept attacks.
The identiﬁed attacks root in the security vulnerabilities span-
ning mobile phones, carrier networks, and SMS-powered services.
On the mobile phones, the SMS-related security mechanisms (e.g.,
SMS permission control) remain invariant while the SMS tech-
nology evolves; thus, they are easily bypassed. For the carrier
networks, though the standards provide several SMS security op-
tions, the ﬂexibility of which helps carriers accommodate the di-
versiﬁed service demands of mobile users, they may expose both
carriers and mobile users to the serious security threats. The SMS-
powered service providers still rely on the existing defense, which
is used to be against the legacy SMS threats. Therefore, the un-
precedented SMS threats introduced by the IMS-based SMS may
hurt the SMS-powered services.
In summary, we study the insecurity of the IMS-based SMS by
systematically exploring all the parties involved: mobile phones,
carrier networks, and SMS-powered services. The paper makes
three major contributions.
1. We identify four vulnerabilities of the IMS-based SMS on
mobile phones and the IMS system. They come from the se-
curity issues of its fundamental designs (i.e., software-based
client, ﬂexible protocol, data-plane communication channel),
and the security mechanisms stipulated by the standards.
2. We devise proof-of-concept attacks against mobile users, car-
riers, and SMS-powered service providers, by exploiting the
identiﬁed vulnerabilities. We assess their impact in two ma-
jor US carriers.
3. We point out root causes and propose recommended solu-
tions. The lessons we learned not only help secure the global
deployment of IMS-based SMS, but also beneﬁt the mobile
industry.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. §2 introduces the
background of SMS. §3 describes the potential security issues of
IMS-based SMS, as well as threat model and methodology. In §4,
we present four security vulnerabilities of IMS-based SMS, and
sketch four proof-of-concept attacks. We then devise three major
attacks against SMS-powered services in §5. We propose solutions
and discuss several remaining issues in §6 and §7, respectively. §8
presents related work, and §9 concludes the paper.
2. BACKGROUND
ment of the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), which is the desig-
nated solution of offering multimedia services in mobile networks.
It shifts from the legacy circuit-switched (CS) technology to the
IMS-based, packet-switched (PS) design. To empower the Internet
users to communicate with mobile users via SMS, there exists the
other Internet-based SMS. Based on this technology, many SMS-
powered services are developed by companies to interact with their
customers via SMS (e.g., Uber contacts users via SMS).
Figure 1 shows the architecture of the Internet-based, CS-based
(i.e., the legacy), and IMS-based SMS services. Each of them has
an SMS client at the end device. The client sends/receives SMS
messages to/from a central controller called SMS Center. The SMS
center is responsible for store-and-forward of SMS messages. We
next elaborate each SMS service.
Internet-based SMS.
The SMS client maintains a session with
the server of the Internet SMS provider (e.g., Twilio, Vibes, etc.).
The server forwards SMS messages between the Internet client and
the SMS center in the mobile network. The interface used between
the server and the SMS center relies on SMPP (Short Message Peer-
to-Peer) protocol.
CS-based SMS.
It is mainly used in 2G/3G networks. The SMS
client on the mobile phone relies on the CS gateway to forward
SMS messages to/from the SMS center. The messages are carried
by a particular control signaling through the control plane of the
mobile network.
IMS-based SMS. Unlike the CS-based SMS, its messages are
carried by particular data packets through the data plane, which
is taken care of by the PS gateway. Speciﬁcally, it relies on the
popular Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [36] to control the SMS
delivery. A SIP-based session is maintained between the phone’s
SMS client and the IMS server. The IMS server is responsible for
bridging the SIP session and the SMS center 1.
2.1 Current Threats and Defenses
The practical security issues of the IMS-based SMS are less ex-
plored, but those of both the CS-based and Internet-based SMS ser-
vices have been well studied [8, 15, 26, 30, 39, 45]. There are two
major SMS threats in those two SMS services: unauthorized SMS
access and SMS spooﬁng. The former mainly happens on mobile
phones, whereas the latter takes place on both mobile and the In-
ternet devices. We describe each threat and its defenses below.

sends out SMS messages without user consent. This threat has been
largely prevented by most antivirus applications (e.g., Kaspersky
and McAfee) and mobile OS. Both of them monitor all the SMS
activities from mobile applications, and then take actions when any
malicious behaviors are detected (e.g., users send SMS messages to
the numbers that would cause monetary loss). Some actions have
been taken by antivirus applications, such as stopping malicious
SMS activities, bring them to users’ attention, etc. The major action
