## Abstract
Short Message Service (SMS) is a widely used text messaging service for mobile users, and it also supports various SMS-powered services such as mobile banking. With the transition to all-IP 4G mobile networks, the underlying technology of SMS has evolved from the legacy circuit-switched network to the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) over packet-switched networks. This paper investigates the security vulnerabilities of IMS-based SMS and identifies four types of attacks: silent SMS abuse, SMS spoofing, SMS client DoS, and SMS spamming. We further demonstrate that these vulnerabilities can be exploited to launch three malicious attacks on SMS-powered services: social network account hijacking, unauthorized donations, and unauthorized subscriptions. Our analysis reveals that the security issues arise from the loose security regulations among mobile phones, carrier networks, and SMS-powered services. Finally, we propose remedies to address the identified security issues.

## 1. Introduction
Short Message Service (SMS) is a fundamental service in mobile networks, supported by nearly all cellular-connected devices. It is not only used for personal communication but also for various SMS-powered services, which enable companies to reach and authenticate their customers via SMS. These services are employed across multiple industries, including social networks, retail, banking, and more.

The success of SMS-based services is attributed to two main factors: the protection of confidentiality and integrity within mobile networks, and the convenience of reaching billions of mobile users. However, with the shift to 4G LTE networks, which support only packet-switched (PS) domain, the conventional circuit-switched (CS) domain services must migrate to the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) over the PS domain. This migration raises the question: Are mobile phones, carrier SMS infrastructures, and SMS-powered services as secure as they were in 2G/3G networks?

Our study reveals that the answer is no. The dramatic change in SMS design in 4G networks introduces new security vulnerabilities. Specifically, 28 out of 40 SMS-powered services from various industries are vulnerable to these new threats. We identify four types of attacks based on these vulnerabilities: silent SMS abuse, SMS spoofing, SMS client DoS, and SMS spamming towards IMS. Additionally, we show that these vulnerabilities can be exploited to launch three major attacks against SMS-powered services: social network account hijacking, unauthorized donations, and unauthorized subscriptions.

In summary, our study systematically explores the insecurity of IMS-based SMS across mobile phones, carrier networks, and SMS-powered services. The key contributions of this paper are:
1. Identification of four vulnerabilities in IMS-based SMS on mobile phones and the IMS system.
2. Development of proof-of-concept attacks and assessment of their impact in two major US carriers.
3. Proposal of root causes and recommended solutions to secure the global deployment of IMS-based SMS.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides background on SMS. Section 3 describes the potential security issues, threat model, and methodology. Section 4 presents the four security vulnerabilities and sketches the proof-of-concept attacks. Section 5 details the three major attacks against SMS-powered services. Sections 6 and 7 propose solutions and discuss remaining issues, respectively. Section 8 covers related work, and Section 9 concludes the paper.

## 2. Background
### 2.1 Evolution of SMS Technology
The evolution of SMS technology has been driven by the deployment of the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), which is designed to offer multimedia services in mobile networks. The transition from the legacy circuit-switched (CS) technology to the IMS-based, packet-switched (PS) design is a significant change. To enable Internet users to communicate with mobile users via SMS, Internet-based SMS services have been developed. Many companies use these services to interact with their customers, such as Uber using SMS for user communication.

### 2.2 Architecture of SMS Services
Figure 1 illustrates the architecture of Internet-based, CS-based, and IMS-based SMS services. Each service has an SMS client at the end device, which sends/receives SMS messages to/from a central controller called the SMS Center. The SMS Center is responsible for store-and-forward of SMS messages.

- **Internet-based SMS:** The SMS client maintains a session with the server of the Internet SMS provider (e.g., Twilio, Vibes). The server forwards SMS messages between the Internet client and the SMS Center in the mobile network using the SMPP (Short Message Peer-to-Peer) protocol.
- **CS-based SMS:** Used primarily in 2G/3G networks, the SMS client on the mobile phone relies on the CS gateway to forward SMS messages to/from the SMS Center. The messages are carried through the control plane of the mobile network.
- **IMS-based SMS:** Unlike CS-based SMS, messages are carried through the data plane, managed by the PS gateway. It uses the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to control SMS delivery. A SIP-based session is maintained between the phone's SMS client and the IMS server, which bridges the SIP session and the SMS Center.

### 2.3 Current Threats and Defenses
While the practical security issues of IMS-based SMS are less explored, the threats and defenses for CS-based and Internet-based SMS services are well-studied. The two major SMS threats are unauthorized SMS access and SMS spoofing.

- **Unauthorized SMS Access:** A mobile application sends SMS messages without user consent. This threat is largely prevented by antivirus applications and mobile operating systems, which monitor and block malicious SMS activities.
- **SMS Spoofing:** An attacker sends SMS messages pretending to be someone else. This threat is addressed by verifying the sender's identity and implementing stricter authentication mechanisms.

## 3. Potential Security Issues, Threat Model, and Methodology
### 3.1 Potential Security Issues
The transition to IMS-based SMS introduces new security challenges due to the fundamental changes in the underlying technology. The software-based client, flexible protocol, and data-plane communication channel create new vulnerabilities.

### 3.2 Threat Model
Our threat model assumes an attacker using commodity smartphones and having no control over carrier networks. The attacks are evaluated in a responsible and controlled manner, with participants being the only victims.

### 3.3 Methodology
We systematically explore the security vulnerabilities of IMS-based SMS by analyzing the interactions between mobile phones, carrier networks, and SMS-powered services. We then develop and assess proof-of-concept attacks to demonstrate the potential impact.

## 4. Security Vulnerabilities and Proof-of-Concept Attacks
### 4.1 Identified Vulnerabilities
We identify four main vulnerabilities in IMS-based SMS:

1. **Leakage of SIP Session Information (V1):** The SIP session information can be intercepted and misused.
2. **Injection of Forged SIP Messages (V2):** Malicious actors can inject forged SIP messages into the IMS system.
3. **Insufficient SMS Access Defense at Phone (V3):** The SMS client on the phone lacks robust defense mechanisms.
4. **Spoofable SMS Messages at IMS Server (V4):** The IMS server does not adequately verify the authenticity of incoming SMS messages.

### 4.2 Proof-of-Concept Attacks
Based on these vulnerabilities, we devise four proof-of-concept attacks:

1. **Silent SMS Abuse:** Adversary exploits malware on the victim's phone to silently send SMS messages.
2. **SMS Spoofing:** Adversary sends SMS messages on behalf of the victim without their awareness.
3. **SMS Client DoS:** Adversary exhausts the resources of the SMS client on the victim's phone.
4. **SMS Spamming towards IMS:** Adversary sends spam SMS messages to the IMS system, affecting carrier operations.

## 5. Attacks Against SMS-Powered Services
### 5.1 Social Network Account Hijacking
Adversary hijacks the victim's Facebook account and abuses it. This attack exploits the lack of runtime authentication in Facebook's SMS-based verification process.

### 5.2 Unauthorized Donation
Adversary donates money to Red Cross from the victim's bill. This attack takes advantage of weak authorization mechanisms in the Red Cross donation system.

### 5.3 Unauthorized Subscription
Adversary makes mobile users subscribe to a service, leading to complaints of unauthorized subscription. This attack exploits weak authorization in the service provider's system, such as Home Depot.

## 6. Proposed Solutions
To address the identified security issues, we recommend the following solutions:

1. **Enhanced SIP Session Security:** Implement stronger encryption and authentication mechanisms for SIP sessions.
2. **Robust SMS Access Control:** Strengthen the SMS client's defense mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access.
3. **Improved SMS Verification:** Enhance the verification process for SMS messages at the IMS server to prevent spoofing.
4. **Stricter Authorization Mechanisms:** Implement more stringent authorization and authentication processes for SMS-powered services.

## 7. Discussion of Remaining Issues
Despite the proposed solutions, several issues remain. For example, the flexibility of the IMS protocol and the diverse service demands of mobile users may still pose challenges. Ongoing research and collaboration between industry and academia are essential to continuously improve the security of IMS-based SMS.

## 8. Related Work
Previous studies have focused on the security of CS-based and Internet-based SMS services. Our work extends this research by examining the unique security challenges of IMS-based SMS in 4G networks.

## 9. Conclusion
This paper investigates the security vulnerabilities of IMS-based SMS in 4G LTE networks and identifies four types of attacks. We also demonstrate how these vulnerabilities can be exploited to launch three major attacks on SMS-powered services. By proposing solutions and discussing remaining issues, we aim to contribute to the secure deployment of IMS-based SMS and benefit the mobile industry.
