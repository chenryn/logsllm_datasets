# Bug report
## Describe the bug
my nextjs version is 9.1.7-canary.14,but it's still not work when I downgrade
to 9.0.0  
here the code is:
    import Router from 'next/router';
    ...
    handleClick = (index) => {
            Router.push('/user');
        };
    ...
    click
I've tried :  
import {withRouter} from'next/router'  
import Link from'next/link'  
and all above don't work on ios10.x.x
## To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior, please provide code snippets or a repository:
  1. create-next-app next-demo
  2. cd next-demo and create a new test page file in pages folder 'test.js',and then type some code in this file
    import React from 'react'
    const Test = (props) => (
        test
    )
    export default Test 
  3. and add router to home page:  
import {useRouter}from 'next/router'  
const router=useRouter()  
the whole test content in home.js is:
    import React from 'react'
    import {useRouter}from 'next/router'
    const Home = () => {
      const router=useRouter()
      const handleClick=()=>{
        console.log('click')
        router.push('/test')}
      return (
          welcome to Next!
    )}
    export default Home
  4. 
start developing,run yarn dev,you will find that all above works well ,you
click the h1 tag and page changed, but this will not work on ios 10.x.x
## Expected behavior
next/router support ios10.x.x
