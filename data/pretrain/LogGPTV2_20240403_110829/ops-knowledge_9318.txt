User: I was able to install pip by using distribute_setup.py and get-pip.py. However, I had to add pip to path by adding C:\Python27\Scripts.
This worked for a little while but I had to do a system restore for other reasons and now when I type pip in the command prompt it returns: 'pip' is not recognized as an internal or external command.
I tried adding C:\Python27\Scripts to path again both to the user variable and system variable but to no avail. I also tried re-installing pip but it just said I had the latest version installed already. Pip can be imported without any error within python so I am at a loss here. Can anyone help?
Thanks in advance.
Assistant: Try using easy_install
easy_install -U pip
This will remove pip.
If you don't have easy_install ... installed, do that first.
After uninstalling pip, simply reinstall it using the get-pip.py file.
