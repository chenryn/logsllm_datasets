I was able to install `pip` using `distribute_setup.py` and `get-pip.py`. However, I had to add `pip` to the system path by including `C:\Python27\Scripts`.

This solution worked for a while, but after performing a system restore for unrelated reasons, typing `pip` in the command prompt now returns: `'pip' is not recognized as an internal or external command`.

I tried adding `C:\Python27\Scripts` to both the user and system environment variables, but this did not resolve the issue. Additionally, I attempted to reinstall `pip`, but the installation process indicated that I already have the latest version. I can import `pip` without any errors within Python, so I am unsure how to proceed. Can anyone provide assistance?

Thank you in advance.

**Response:**

Try using `easy_install` to update `pip`:

```sh
easy_install -U pip
```

If `easy_install` is not installed, you will need to install it first. After uninstalling `pip`, simply reinstall it using the `get-pip.py` file.
