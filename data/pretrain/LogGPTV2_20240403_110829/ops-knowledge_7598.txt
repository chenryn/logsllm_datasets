Question: How does the unique device identifier (ECID) contribute to the security of the mobile device's boot process?
"A": "It ensures that each device has a unique boot sequence, making it difficult for an adversary to predict the boot process and inject malicious code.",
"B": "It allows Apple's servers to sign upgrades specifically for a device's ECID, preventing adversaries from installing an out-of-date OS kernel.",
"C": "It creates a unique encryption key for each device's storage, which is used to encrypt the Boot ROM and iBoot loader.",
"D": "It enables the boot sequence to verify that the signature of the iBoot and OS kernel corresponds to the specific device, thwarting downgrade attacks."
