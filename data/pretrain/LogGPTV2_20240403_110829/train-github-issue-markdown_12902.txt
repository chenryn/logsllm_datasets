Challenge Sum All Odd Fibonacci Numbers has an issue.

Please describe how to reproduce this issue, and include links to screenshots
if possible.
The issue I am having is with receiving a "SyntaxError: Unexpected token ;"
syntax error. This issue has to do with the semicolon at the end of the do
while, which is syntactically correct. This prevents the code from running.
While there is a work around, I just wanted to shed some light.
Thanks
My code:
    function sumFibs(num) {
      var prevNum = 1;
      var curNum = 1;
      var result = 2;
      do {
        var newNum = prevNum + curNum;
        if (newNum % 2 !== 0 && newNum <= num) {
          result += newNum;
        }
        prevNum = curNum;
        curNum = newNum;
      } while (curNum < num);
      console.log(result);
      return result;
    }
    sumFibs(1000);
