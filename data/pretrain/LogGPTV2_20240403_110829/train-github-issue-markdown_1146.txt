### Vue.js version
1.0.21
### Reproduction Link
http://matkovsky.com/vue-svg/  
(The left icon is inside a `` block, the right one is not.)
### Steps to reproduce
Put an `` tag with an external svg file (with symbols) inside a
`` block.
### What is Expected?
The SVG should be there. (And it is there in Safari, Firefox, Opera, but not
in Chrome.)
### What is actually happening?
The SVG is not loaded. Not even if the same symbol is already used on the site
elsewhere.

I'm not entirely sure whether this is a Chrome bug or a Vue bug.
