_homeview_appbar_background.xml_ (my drawable alias)
Using this code to load does not work, because a drawable.xml alias file is
used and not the original file itself.
    Glide.with(this)
         .load(R.drawable.homeview_appbar_background)
         .into(imageView);
However, this works, because glide directly references the .png drawable.
    Glide.with(this)
         .load(R.drawable.homeview_appbar_background)
         .into(imageView);
Note: "does not work" means that nothing happens when the glide loading is
called.
