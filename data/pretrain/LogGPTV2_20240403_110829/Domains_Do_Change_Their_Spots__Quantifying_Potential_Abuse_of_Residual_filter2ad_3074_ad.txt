making a request for a specific URL on HTTP(S) will expect to receive
certain content and, if this expectation is not met, they may attempt
a request for another URL. With each request, we are able to log
HTTP headers of interest and potentially collect an associated browser
fingerprint. Thus, our pipeline for HTTP(S) traffic is more intricate and
has more filters than our pipeline for the credentials-based services.
In fact, because our credentials-based services collect minimal
information, it is hard to distinguish trust traffic from bot
traffic for these services. For SSH and Telnet traffic, we find that
no IP addresses were marked trust; for FTP traffic, we find that
one IP address (0.017%) was marked trust with the repeated
credentials filter. This IP address sent two requests to one of our
domains from a Google IP address; we can conclude with high
confidence that this case is a false positive because the domain was
not affiliated with Google. As such, we focus our discussion on our
findings from the HTTP(S) traffic.
Most of our domains did not receive substantial trust traffic, as
shown in Figure 9. The two cumulative distribution functions of the
percentage of IP addresses marked bot or trust are symmetrical.
Notably, although the majority of our re-registered domains have little
potential for abuse of residual trust, they are not the ones that we are
concerned with. Rather, the outliers that lie at the extremes of each
curve are of most interest. These are high-volume domains with traffic
originating from millions of IP addresses. We summarize the impact of
the domains with the highest trust-related HTTP(S) traffic in Table III.
Figure 4 details the breakdown of the effects of each bot and
trust indicator from Section III-D. Each node in the diagram
represents a stage in the filtering process and its corresponding set
of unique IP addresses, and the width of each flow from node A
to B represents the number of unique IP addresses in A that were
filtered by B. The sets of IP addresses represented by each node
are exclusive and the top-down order of nodes describes the unique
criteria satisfied by those IP addresses. In summary, we find that at
least 50.58% of the IP addresses in our HTTP(S) traffic are unaware
of changes in domain ownership and send residual trust traffic to
our servers. In contrast, approximately 43.59% of the IP addresses
exhibit bot-like behavior and 5.82% could not be classified as
either bot or trust using our indicators.
Fig. 9. CDF of the percentage of bot and trust HTTP(S) traffic for each domain in
terms of unique number of IP addresses. Over 95% of domains received over 95%
bot traffic, and only 7% of domains received over 1% trust traffic.
D. Temporal Characteristics
Figure 10 visualizes both the daily number of unique IPs that
contact domains on high-volume, non-honeypot ports on the left and
the daily number of unique trust-tagged IP addresses that visit
domains with a large percentage of trust-related traffic on the right.
From the left-hand plot, it appears that the number of IPs that attempt
to contact a non-honeypot service on these domains largely remains
constant over our analysis time window. This suggests that residual
trust traffic is not guaranteed to decay over time, or, at least, not within
a period of a few months after an expired domain is re-registered.
As for the right-hand side, we see evidence for both sides, namely
that residual trust traffic may largely remain stable or that it may grad-
ually decay. Domains labstats.go, avantmobile.com
and facecommute.com exposed APIs which were accessed by
automated and unaware clients and exhibited stable trust-related traffic.
This implies that the clients who attempt to contact these domains
have not been updated. Similarly, domain tianxingmeng.com
likely hosted a radio and music streaming station and now also
experiences stable trust-related traffic after re-registration. The
other two domains, cpttrk.com and parastrok.info,
previously hosted an advertising service and a sports news website
and they both experience volatile trust-related traffic. In particular,
we see that the curve for parastrok.info, which previously
offered news articles, dies off less than a month after re-registration
of the domain. The curve for cpttrk.com also decreases, but
gradually over time and experiences large and sudden spikes.
Both plots suggest that residual trust traffic is not guaranteed to
decay over time. Depending on what the domain was previously used
for and the clients that contact it, it may be difficult to reconfigure
the clients to use another point of contact. On the other hand, we
also see evidence that residual trust traffic could decay over time.
In fact, we see that in some cases it may suddenly drop, indicating an
update or reconfiguration in the clients, or gradually decay over time
with a volatile instantaneous behavior. In conclusion, although we see
that the potential for residual trust abuse may be mitigated over time,
we cannot rely on this phenomenon because it is not guaranteed.
V. CASE STUDIES
In this section, we present several case studies from our pool of
registered domains, demonstrating the magnitude and wide range
of abuse possible via the mere re-registration of previously-popular
domains. Table III presents the statistics of the HTTP(S) traffic for

their website [48]. Residual trust traffic requests are for the paths
/Assign/ServerSlot and /Api/Client. Control of this
domain would allow for large-scale exfiltration of data from higher
education facilities. In a similar fashion, owning fgmail.com
would also yield valuable information because it previously
functioned as an email tracker. We know from prior work that email
tracking is privacy-harming and it is not uncommon for senders to
intentionally leak email addresses to third-party trackers [49].
Control of avantmobile.com would allow for gathering
of personally identifiable information on a much larger scale
because it exposed an API for an Android libary. Profiling this
domain was the result of combining different pieces of residual
information. We began by noting that the majority of requests
are HTTP POSTs to /log and /sync for the subdomain
api.avantmobile.com with the User-Agent header set to
a version of okhttp, a popular Android HTTP library. Using
a Java decompiler to investigate archived versons of Android
applications, we found that disparate apps that were on Google
Play [50], [51], [52] used a common third-party haptics library,
com.immersion.content, which contained string references
to api.avantmobile.com. It is unclear whether this library
was the original or a modified version as it is no longer offered by
the publisher, but it appears to have been used by many Android
apps. These apps are no longer available in the Google Play store,
but an APK mirror self-reports over 500K downloads for one of
them from their website [52]. We confirmed our suspicions when we
captured DNS queries for api.avantmobile.com by running
these mobile apps on an emulator and monitoring network traffic.
Furthermore, the top 10 ASNs by the number of IPs observed in the
traffic to the avantmobile.com domain are all ISPs that offer
telecommunications services. The last mentions we found for the do-
main are social media accounts on Facebook [53] and Instagram [54]
referring to an “Avant Mobile” company that lists the domain as their
website, although we suspect this to be a front for malicious behavior.
In summary, obtaining control of high-volume APIs can be quite
attractive to attackers. In the case of a torrent tracker, the new owner
can learn which peers host which files, their locations, and attempt
to attack connecting clients. In the case of a service trusted by many
educational institutions, the new owner gains a method to attack many
geographically diverse institutions trusted by the general populace.
In the case of a suspicious domain contacted by a widely-used mobile
application library, the new owner can gather highly confidential
information about a vast array of people for further use.
b) Malicious activity: We discovered multiple domains in
our dataset linked to malicious activity. Of this group, facecom-
mute.com received the largest amount of traffic. According to
some malware detection services, it previously functioned as a
command-and-control server [55]. Common request paths to this do-
main include /bots/{log,install-failure,update-
additional-data} and /api/{poll,log}. Query key
parameters in the requests point to an entity named cloudnet
(e.g., cloudnet_{guid,file,process}) and likely refer
to their C2 entities hosted in the cloud. Another expired domain
previously used for malicious purposes is gbox-data.net.
According to VirusTotal,
is linked to a family of PUPs
named Guardbox [56]. This domain was unique in that clients
used subdomains as if they were request paths (i.e., clients
would send a GET / request
to gb-alive-msg.gbox-
data.net instead of a GET /gb-alive-msg request to
it

the top ten domains with the highest percentage of trust-tagged
IP addresses, while Table IV shows the statistics in non-honeypot
service traffic to high-volume domains.
a) APIs: ipv6tracker.org previously functioned as a
popular torrent tracker, a component that aids peers in discovering
one another. Torrent trackers maintain a list of peers that expressed
interest in a given torrent, enabling the tracker to inform new clients
about the peers it can connect to. This expired domain received
the most traffic to honeypot services in our dataset, and it was
beyond our expectations and ability to efficiently handle. We only
retain data for a one-month window for this domain, and we note
from Figure 6 that its presence led to a system-wide outage of our
infrastructure near the beginning of September. Because we did not
expect significant new findings from this domain, we opted to leave
it offline to limit further resource use and log space consumption.
We observe a daily average of approximately 7M requests before
the container started to experience availability problems. Almost all
requests are to /announce, /announce33, and /scrape
on host tracker.ipv6tracker.org with query keys
such as info_hash, peer_id, port, uploaded, down-
loaded, and left and the User-Agent header set to a torrent
client (e.g., uTorrent, BitTorrent, and qTorrent). This trivially grants
the ability to gather information and create a database of files seeded
and downloaded by all the peers in the network. Controlling such a
popular torrent tracker would expose a large threat vector that would
affect over 2.5M unique IP addresses situated in over 9.4K ASNs.
