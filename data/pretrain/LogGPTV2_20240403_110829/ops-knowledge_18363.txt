To gain full access to the terminal and install Python, I need to enable developer mode on my Chromebook. However, I am concerned about losing automatic updates for ChromeOS.

Does enabling developer mode in ChromeOS disable automatic updates?

**Response:**
Enabling developer mode in ChromeOS does not disable automatic updates. I have had my Chromebook in developer mode for over a year, and I have continued to receive all the regular updates without any issues.
