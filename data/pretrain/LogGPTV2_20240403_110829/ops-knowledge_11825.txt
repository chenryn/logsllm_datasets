User: There is a large-scale distributed system that needs to be monitored and managed. Please describe a Prometheus-based system monitoring solution and explain its advantages and disadvantages.
Assistant: Prometheus-based system monitoring solution: 1. Install and configure the Prometheus server: the Prometheus server is the master node, responsible for monitoring the indicator data of all distributed systems, and can provide functions such as data storage, query, and alarm. 2. Install and configure Prometheus Exporter in the monitored system: Exporter is a client program responsible for collecting monitoring data of the system where it is located and sending it to the Prometheus server for storage and processing. 3. Design and implement monitoring indicators: users can customize monitoring indicators according to system requirements, and Prometheus supports multiple types of monitoring indicators. 4. Configure the Grafana visualization component: Grafana is an open source visualization tool that can graphically display the data provided by Prometheus. Users can view and analyze monitoring data in real time through Grafana. Advantages: 1. Strong flexibility: Prometheus supports multiple types of monitoring indicators, which can meet a variety of monitoring needs, and supports custom monitoring indicators. 2. Lightweight: Prometheus itself is a lightweight monitoring system with small size and high performance. 3. High availability: Prometheus can realize data backup and redundancy through data replication and distributed storage to improve system availability. 4. Scalability: Prometheus supports horizontal expansion, that is, the ability to expand the monitoring system by adding Prometheus server nodes. Disadvantages: 1. Higher learning costs: Prometheus configuration and use are more complicated, requiring users to have certain technical background and experience. 2. Limited storage capacity: The storage capacity of Prometheus is relatively limited. If the amount of monitoring data is large, the data needs to be cleaned up regularly. 3. Does not support log monitoring: Prometheus does not support log monitoring, and users need to use other tools to process log data.
