User: I'm writing a python script that generates html file. Every time I run this script I'd like at the end to open default system browser for this file. It's all in OS X environment.
What python code can launch Safari/Firefox/whatever is system default html viewer and open given file? subprocess.call doesn't seem to do the trick.
Assistant: import ic
ic.launchurl('file:///somefile.html')
