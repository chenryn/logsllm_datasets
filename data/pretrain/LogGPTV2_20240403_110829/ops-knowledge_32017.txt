User: I'm trying to use a MongoDB Database from a Google App Engine service is that possible? How do I install the PyMongo driver on Google App Engine? Thanks
Assistant: It's not possible because you don't have access to networks sockets in App Engine. As long as you cannot access the database via HTTP, it's impossible.
