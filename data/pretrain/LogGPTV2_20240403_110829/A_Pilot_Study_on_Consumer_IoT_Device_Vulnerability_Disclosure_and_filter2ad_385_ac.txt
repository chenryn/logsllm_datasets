have studied the vulnerability disclosure and patch release behav-
iors of 3 prominent consumer IoT device vendors in JP and 3 in
US over the 12 years from 2006 to 2017. Overall, we are encour-
aged to see that 5 out of 6 included vendors have been releasing
patches in a timely manner. However, our dataset also reveals sev-
eral less-desirable behaviors of the included vendors, such as (i)
their patch release delays do not show significant improvement
over the covered years, and (ii) they do not appear to prioritize
patches for vulnerabilities that are more severe.
One interesting investigation enabled by our bi-country dataset
is to contrast the two markets. Indeed, we observed notable dif-
ferences between them in our stratified analyses, which led us to
discover different trends in their disclosure coordination. We be-
lieve one interesting future study would be to include more markets,
which likely requires further automation as we suggested in §7.
Finally, our investigation has also uncovered three alarming
vendor practices which may pose significant risks of 1-day exploits.
We believe vendors can reduce the risk to their customers by (i)
reducing the patch release gaps during incremental patch releases
or among regional subsidiaries and (ii) publishing End-of-Support
information in every region.
