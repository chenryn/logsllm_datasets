### Vulnerability Disclosure and Patch Release Behaviors of Consumer IoT Vendors

We have analyzed the vulnerability disclosure and patch release behaviors of three prominent consumer IoT device vendors in Japan and three in the United States over a 12-year period from 2006 to 2017. Our findings are generally encouraging, as five out of the six vendors have been releasing patches in a timely manner. However, our dataset also reveals several concerning trends:

1. **Patch Release Delays**: The delays in patch releases have not shown significant improvement over the years.
2. **Prioritization of Severe Vulnerabilities**: Vendors do not appear to prioritize patches for more severe vulnerabilities.

#### Cross-Market Analysis

Our bi-country dataset allowed us to compare the two markets, revealing notable differences in their disclosure coordination. These differences highlight different trends in how vendors handle vulnerability disclosures and patch releases. We believe that future studies should include more markets, which would likely require further automation, as suggested in §7.

#### Alarming Vendor Practices

Our investigation uncovered three alarming practices by vendors that may pose significant risks of 1-day exploits:
1. **Incremental Patch Gaps**: Significant gaps during incremental patch releases or among regional subsidiaries.
2. **Lack of End-of-Support Information**: Vendors often fail to publish End-of-Support information in every region.

To reduce these risks, we recommend that vendors:
1. **Reduce Patch Release Gaps**: Minimize the time between incremental patch releases and ensure consistency across regional subsidiaries.
2. **Publish End-of-Support Information**: Clearly communicate End-of-Support dates in all regions where their products are sold.
