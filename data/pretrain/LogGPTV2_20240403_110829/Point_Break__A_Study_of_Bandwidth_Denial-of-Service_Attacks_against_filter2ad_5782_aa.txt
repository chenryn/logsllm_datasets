Abstract
As the Tor network has grown in popularity and importance
as a tool for privacy-preserving online communication, it has
increasingly become a target for disruption, censorship, and
attack. A large body of existing work examines Tor’s sus-
ceptibility to attacks that attempt to block Tor users’ access
to information (e.g., via trafﬁc ﬁltering), identify Tor users’
communication content (e.g., via trafﬁc ﬁngerprinting), and
de-anonymize Tor users (e.g., via trafﬁc correlation). This
paper focuses on the relatively understudied threat of denial-
of-service (DoS) attacks against Tor, and speciﬁcally, DoS
attacks that intelligently utilize bandwidth as a means to sig-
niﬁcantly degrade Tor network performance and reliability.
We demonstrate the feasibility of several bandwidth DoS
attacks through live-network experimentation and high-
ﬁdelity simulation while quantifying the cost of each attack
and its effect on Tor performance. First, we explore an at-
tack against Tor’s most commonly used default bridges (for
censorship circumvention) and estimate that ﬂooding those
that are operational would cost $17K/mo. and could reduce
client throughput by 44% while more than doubling bridge
maintenance costs. Second, we explore attacks against the
TorFlow bandwidth measurement system and estimate that
a constant attack against all TorFlow scanners would cost
$2.8K/mo. and reduce the median client download rate by
80%. Third, we explore how an adversary could use Tor
to congest itself and estimate that such a congestion attack
against all Tor relays would cost $1.6K/mo. and increase the
median client download time by 47%. Finally, we analyze
the effects of Sybil DoS and deanonymization attacks that
have costs comparable to those of our attacks.
1 Introduction
Tor [28] is the most popular anonymous communication sys-
tem ever deployed, with an estimated eight million daily ac-
tive users [59]. These users depend on Tor to anonymize
their connections to Internet services and distributed peers,
and also to circumvent censorship by local authorities that
control network infrastructure. Tor is used by ordinary citi-
zens and businesses to protect their privacy online, by jour-
nalists and activists to more freely access and contribute dig-
ital content [7], and by criminals to perform illegal activities
while avoiding identiﬁcation [67].
As a result of its popularity, open-source codebase [9], and
transparent development processes [10], Tor has gained sig-
niﬁcant attention from researchers who explore attacks that
aim to deanonymize its users by gaining an advantageous
view of network trafﬁc [13]. Research directions for Tor at-
tacks include website ﬁngerprinting [18, 41, 42, 56, 69, 70,
77, 84, 85], routing [15, 16, 79, 81, 83], end-to-end cor-
relation [54, 57, 58, 65, 66], congestion [31, 34, 51, 64],
and side channels [43, 63]. Many of these attacks repre-
sent realistic threats for Tor users: some attacks are reported
to have been launched by state sponsors against Tor in the
wild [21, 22, 73, 76]. However, relatively understudied but
arguably more viable is the threat of denial-of-service (DoS).
The Threat of Denial-of-Service: Bandwidth-based DoS
against Tor is a relatively understudied but relevant threat.
Previous work has explored the exhaustion of Tor relays’
memory [51], CPU [14, 71], and socket descriptor re-
sources [35], as well as selective service refusal [16]. While
bandwidth-based DoS attacks against a single target have
been considered [31], we are the ﬁrst to study the feasibil-
ity, cost, and effects of launching such attacks against the
entire Tor network of relays and other particularly vulnera-
ble Tor components. Given Tor’s limited resources and slow
performance relative to the open web, further reducing per-
formance through bandwidth DoS attacks also has the po-
tential to reduce security by driving away users who may be
unwilling to endure even slower load times [16, 25].
We argue that DoS attacks in general, and bandwidth DoS
attacks in particular, are less complex and therefore more vi-
able than many previous deanonymization attacks. Our DoS
attacks either can be outsourced to third party “stresser” ser-
vices that will ﬂood a target with packets for an amortized
cost of $0.74/hr. per Gbit/s of attack trafﬁc (see §3.1), or
utilize lightweight Tor clients running on dedicated servers
at an amortized cost of $0.70/hr. per Gbit/s of attack traf-

ﬁc (see §3.2). Nation-states are known to sponsor DoS at-
tacks [60], and the ease of deployment and low cost of our
attacks suggest that state actors could reasonably run them to
disrupt Tor over both short and long timescales. We specu-
late that nation-states may, e.g., choose DoS as an alternative
to trafﬁc ﬁltering as Tor continues to improve its ability to
circumvent blocking and censorship [32]. Non-state actors
could also reasonably deploy the attacks since they require
only a few servers or can be completely outsourced.
Tor DoS attacks are not a hypothetical threat: existing evi-
dence indicates that DoS attacks against the network have al-
ready been successfully deployed [23, 38, 40], requiring Tor
to develop a subsystem to mitigate its effects [24, 39] (the
subsystem does not mitigate our attacks). Although it may
be challenging to detect and counter bandwidth-based DoS
attacks, especially those that are designed to mimic realistic
and plausible usage patterns, we believe that it is imperative
to better understand such a threat as we develop defenses.
Our Contributions: This paper focuses on the costs and ef-
fects of DoS attacks that intelligently utilize bandwidth as a
means to signiﬁcantly degrade Tor performance and reliabil-
ity. Following a discussion of the current pricing models for
“stresser” (i.e., DoS-for-hire) services (§3.1) and dedicated
servers (§3.2), we ﬁrst explore the threat of a na¨ıve ﬂood-
ing attack in which an adversary uses multiple “stresser” ac-
counts to consume Tor relays’ bandwidth by ﬂooding them
with packets (§4). We estimate that the cost to carry out such
an attack against the entire Tor network is $7.2M/mo.
We then demonstrate the feasibility and effects of 3 ma-
jor bandwidth DoS attacks against Tor in order of decreasing
cost. First, we explore in §5 an attack that attempts to disrupt
Tor’s censorship circumvention system by ﬂooding Tor’s de-
fault bridges with packets, thereby causing bridge users to
migrate to non-default bridges or lose access to Tor. We esti-
mate that ﬂooding Tor’s 12 operational default bridges would
cost $17K/mo. and would reduce bridge user throughput by
44% (if 25% of the users migrated to other bridges) while
more than doubling meek bridge maintenance costs.
Second, we explore in §6 an attack that attempts to dis-
rupt Tor’s load balancing system by ﬂooding TorFlow band-
width scanners with packets, thereby causing inaccurate and
inconsistent relay capacity measurement results. Through
high-ﬁdelity network simulation using Shadow [47], we ﬁnd
that such an attack reduces the median client download rate
by 80%. We estimate that a constant ﬂooding attack against
Tor’s 5 TorFlow scanners would cost $2.8K/mo.
Third, we explore in §7 an attack that uses the Tor pro-
tocol to consume relay bandwidth resources. In the attack,
a Tor client builds thousands of 8-hop circuits and congests
relays by downloading large ﬁles through the network. Us-
ing Shadow, we ﬁnd that such an attack using 20k circuits
increases the median client download time by 120% at an
estimated cost of $6.3K/mo. and achieves a bandwidth am-
pliﬁcation factor of 6.7. We also ﬁnd that a stop reading strat-
egy [51] reduces the estimated cost of a 20k circuit attack to
$1.6K/mo., increases the median client download time by
47%, and achieves a bandwidth ampliﬁcation factor of 26.
Finally, we analyze in §8 the effects of relay Sybil attacks
that have costs comparable to those of our attacks.
Ethics and Responsible Disclosure: We emphasize that we
do not carry out attacks against the live Tor network. We con-
duct some measurement experiments on Tor to better under-
stand its composition and performance characteristics. How-
ever, we neither observe nor store any information about any
Tor users (other than ourselves). We evaluate our attacks us-
ing high-ﬁdelity Shadow simulations that are constructed to
resemble the live Tor network. Additionally, we discussed
our project with Tor developers, shared some of our results
before submission of this paper, and sent a pre-print of our
paper prior to its acceptance. We anticipate providing sup-
port as they develop any mitigations to our attacks.
2 Related Work
In this paper we focus speciﬁcally on attacks that target the
Tor network, noting that attacks that target Internet protocols
(e.g., TCP) or resources (e.g., web servers) have been rigor-
ously studied in previous work.
Anonymity Attacks against Tor: There is a large body
of work that examines attacks against Tor. The majority
of these attacks aim to compromise anonymity—that is, to
de-anonymize either targeted users or Tor users en masse.
We highlight that research directions for anonymity attacks
include website ﬁngerprinting [18, 41, 42, 56, 69, 70, 77,
84, 85], routing [15, 16, 79, 81, 83], end-to-end correla-
tion [54, 57, 58, 65, 66], congestion [31, 34, 51, 64], and side
channels [43, 63]. (The reader may refer to previous work
for a more complete taxonomy [13].) Although anonymity
attacks are certainly problematic for Tor, the primary focus
of this paper is on bandwidth-based DoS attacks that sig-
niﬁcantly degrade Tor network performance and reliability.
Note that we compare our attacks to Sybil attacks that can be
used for deanonymizing Tor users in §8.
Denial-of-Service Attacks against Tor: We are not the ﬁrst
to explore the network’s susceptibility to DoS. In their semi-
nal work, Evans et al. [31] exploit the lack of an upper bound
on the length of Tor circuits in older Tor versions. They
show that an attacker can perform a bandwidth ampliﬁca-
tion DoS attack by creating cyclic, arbitrary length circuits
through high bandwidth Tor relays. The congestion created
by the DoS attack affects the latency of legitimate circuits
which can be used to determine the guard relay on a circuit.
To mitigate this attack, Tor has since imposed a cap of eight
relays in circuit creation [27, §5.6].
Similarly, Pappas et al. [71] propose an asymmetric, am-
pliﬁcation packet-spinning DoS attack against legitimate Tor
relays. The goal of the attack is to increase the chances of le-
gitimate clients choosing the attacker’s relays by keeping the
legitimate relays busy with expensive cryptographic opera-

tions. The attacker uses a malicious relay to create a circular
Tor circuit that starts and ends at the malicious relay. Their
focus is on de-anonymization and they do not consider DoS
attacks against the entire Tor network.
Borisov et al. [16] show that an attacker can de-anonymize
a large fraction of Tor circuits by performing selective DoS
on honest Tor relays to increase the probability that the at-
tacker’s relays will be chosen as guard and exit relays (and
thus capable of performing trafﬁc correlation [80]). Tor has
since deployed a route manipulation (path bias) detection
system to mitigate the effects of such an attack [26, §7].
Barbera et al. [14] propose an asymmetric DoS attack
against Tor relays. The attack ﬂoods a targeted relay with
CREATE cells that require public key operations to decrypt
the cell. They show that by strategically targeting important
relays, the attacker can slow down the entire Tor network
due to overload on the remaining relays that are not under
DoS attack. This is similar in aim to our work. However, our
focus is less on protocol vulnerabilities and more on enumer-
ating hotspots in Tor that, when attacked, could disrupt the
network at large. We explore multiple avenues for causing
network-wide performance and disruption.
Geddes et al. [35] demonstrate socket exhaustion attacks
against various proposed replacements [12, 37] of Tor’s
transport protocol. They show that an attacker can disable ar-
bitrary relays by exhausting their socket ﬁle descriptors and
prevent legitimate connections from succeeding. However,
the attack does not apply to the deployed Tor network, which
does not employ the vulnerable transport protocols.
Jansen et al. [51] propose the Sniper Attack, a memory-
based DoS attack that exploits Tor’s end-to-end reliable data
transport to consume memory by ﬁlling up the application
level packet queues. Using simulation on Shadow [47], they
show that an attacker can sequentially disable 20 exit relays
in 29 minutes and make the Tor network unusable, while re-
maining undetected. The Tor Project has since rolled out
defenses against the sniper attack [45]. We use some of the
techniques from the sniper attack in our congestion attacks.
3 Threat Model and Attacker Costs
We consider an attacker who is determined to deny service
to the Tor network. We make few assumptions about the
capabilities or makeup of our adversary. In particular, our
adversary need not control large regions of the Internet or be
able to observe a large fraction of Tor trafﬁc.
Instead, we model an adversary who has some bandwidth
and computing capacity at its disposal. Certainly, a nation-
state has such resources, but we imagine that such an adver-
sary would likely prefer to avoid attribution and not conduct
attacks from its own networks. More generally, our adver-
sary can acquire (or rent) a distributed network of machines
capable of sending trafﬁc into the Tor network. We high-
light two potential avenues for obtaining the resources neces-
sary to carry out network-wide attacks against Tor: dedicated
DoS “stresser” services (§3.1) and the use of more traditional
(and legal) dedicated hosting services (§3.2).
We do not require that the adversary be able to position
itself in arbitrary locations on the Internet, although we do
assume that some portion of its trafﬁc will reach its intended
targets. For some attacks, we additionally require the ad-
versary to operate a Tor relay, but as we describe below, it
is advantageous for such attacks to run a relay that provides
negligible bandwidth to the Tor network; that is, the relay
could be cheaply instantiated on a shared cloud provider or
other low-cost hosting service.
Attacker Goals: The goal of the attacker is to disrupt either
(i) the Tor network in its entirety or (ii) a portion of it that af-
fects an entire subpopulation of Tor users. The latter includes
attacks against Tor’s bridge infrastructure, the set of unpub-
lished relays that permit the participation of users who are
otherwise prevented from accessing the Tor network directly
(e.g., due to censorship).
In general, we consider an attack successful if it entirely
prevents users from accessing Tor or if it degrades perfor-
mance to such an extent that the anonymity service becomes
too burdensome to use. The latter is of course subjective,
but informally, we set a high threshold for what we con-
sider unusable performance. We also note that even in the
current (non-attacked) Tor network, its slow performance is
already perceived as an impediment to its more widespread
use [13]. Degrading performance much beyond Tor’s current
levels may cause many users to abandon the network.
Attacker Costs: One of our goals is to estimate the mon-
etary cost of performing various bandwidth DoS attacks
against different elements of Tor infrastructure. To esti-
mate such costs to the attacker, we build a cost model from
publicly available information on pricing of various online
stresser services and dedicated hosting services.
3.1 Stresser Services
There is an active online market for stresser (also called DoS-
for-hire or booter) services. These provide the capability to
launch DoS attacks against any target, using a web-based
interface, at a relatively low monthly cost. Most commonly,
the attacks use a distributed botnet of compromised hosts to
target a single victim, ﬂooding it with requests.
