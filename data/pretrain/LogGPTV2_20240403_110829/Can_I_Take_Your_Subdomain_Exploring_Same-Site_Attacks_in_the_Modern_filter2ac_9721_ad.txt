### Analysis of Complex and Heterogeneous Public-Facing IT Infrastructures

Public-facing IT infrastructures often translate into a high number of subdomains. By restricting our analysis to the .edu top-level domain (TLD), we observed 1,229 domains, each with an average of 6,033 subdomains. The percentage of domains with at least one vulnerable subdomain is 7.32%, which is significantly higher than any other TLD considered. For comparison, the percentage in .com is 1.81%.

Overall, we identified vulnerabilities affecting top domains across all categories. For example, we found subdomain takeover vulnerabilities on news websites like cnn.com and time.com, university portals like harvard.edu and mit.edu, governmental websites like europa.eu and nih.gov, and IT companies like lenovo.com and cisco.com. Although most of these issues could be easily fixed by routinely checking the validity of DNS records, our large-scale vulnerability assessment raises concerns due to the number and pervasiveness of the identified threats.

### 5.1.2 Analysis of Third-Party Services

We examined 26 service and hosting providers and 5 dynamic DNS services, totaling 31 third-party services. Our selection includes services mentioned in previous work [33] and community efforts [22], excluding those that required payment for our analysis.

#### Summary of Results

The results are summarized in Table 4. We combined manual testing and review of the documentation to assess the capabilities available to a registered user of each service. We also evaluated the considered services against the security pitfalls described in ยง3.2.1:
1. **Wildcard**: The domain ownership verification allows attackers to claim subdomains of an already mapped domain, e.g., due to the presence of a wildcard DNS entry.
2. **Redirect**: If the www subdomain of a mapped domain automatically redirects to the parent domain, whether the former can be claimed by a different account.
3. **PSL (Public Suffix List)**: If the service allows users to create a website under a specific subdomain, whether the parent domain of the assigned website is included in the PSL.

Table 3 shows the distribution of vulnerable subdomains across service providers. The majority of the vulnerable subdomains (93%) are hosted on the first four most used services: WordPress, Shopify, Tumblr, and GitHub Pages. These prominent services allow users to host a website with a valid TLS certificate for the associated domain. Users can customize the markup and JavaScript code of the pages, and for Tumblr and GitHub Pages, users can upload arbitrary files to their websites. The capabilities obtained by an attacker controlling a service vary depending on the specific platform, ranging from content only (UptimeRobot) to full host control (ngrok). We found that 19 out of 26 services grant the `js` and `https` capabilities, while 21 provide the `js` capability alone. The `file` capability is the most uncommon, being available for only 4 services.

Surprisingly, we discovered that in 20 out of the 31 analyzed services, any registered user controls a website that is in a related-domain position to all other websites hosted on the platform. Tumblr and WordPress, along with 11 additional services, even share their primary domain with user-controlled websites, e.g., `attacker.tumblr.com` is related to `tumblr.com`. Only GitHub and ngrok prevent this threat by including the apex domains assigned to their users in the PSL.

Lastly, we found that 17 services have issues with the ownership verification mechanism. Among the four most used services, only WordPress prevents attackers from claiming subdomains of an already mapped domain. Moreover, 8 service providers perform an automatic redirection from the `www` subdomain to the parent domain. Therefore, users of these services might erroneously assume that the `www` subdomain is implicitly bound to their account and cannot be claimed by others. Only Shopify and Launchrock do not prevent this subdomain from being mapped to different accounts. We reported the vulnerabilities discovered in the domain ownership verification process to GitHub and Shopify, two of the major service providers. GitHub acknowledged the problem and stated that they are "exploring various changes to the custom domain flow that will improve this situation by requiring formal domain ownership verification." Shopify awarded us $1,000 for the report and shipped a fix on April 12, 2021.

#### Dynamic DNS Services

The adoption of the PSL across different dynamic DNS providers is shown in Table 5, together with the number of domains that a user can choose from. We observed that only 2 providers listed all their domains in the PSL. Noip and DynDNS left out a small number of the domains they offer, but it is not clear whether this is due to negligence or a deliberate choice. FreeDNS, with more than 50k domains, did not include any of them in the list, leaving their massive user base at risk. We reported this major flaw to the FreeDNS maintainer, who acknowledged it but took no action, as it would be impossible to maintain an updated list of thousands of domains in the PSL, given the lack of an API to manage PSL entries.

### 5.2 Web Threats

We now turn our attention to the web application security implications of our analysis, as summarized in Tables 3 and further detailed in Table 6.

We start by discussing the confidentiality and integrity of session cookies. Overall, our crawler collected 85,169 cookies, out of which 24,924 were labeled as session cookies by our heuristic. Among these, we identified 3,390 (14%) cookies from 5,051 (33%) domains on 687 sites (81%) whose confidentiality can be violated by a related-domain attacker. This shows that related-domain attackers can often get access to session cookies, which may enable attacks like session hijacking. Our analysis also shows that the state of cookie integrity is even worse: in particular, we identified 24,689 (99%) session cookies from 14,964 (99%) domains on 834 (99%) sites.

Tables 3 and 6 provide a detailed breakdown of the affected domains and sites, highlighting the extent of the vulnerabilities and the potential for exploitation by related-domain attackers.
