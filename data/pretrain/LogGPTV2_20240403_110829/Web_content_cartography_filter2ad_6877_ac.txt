The diagonal is more pronounced than for TOP2000 (Table 1).
continents, namely Africa, Oceania, and South America, do not
appear to serve a lot of popular hostnames.
Another observation from Table 1 is a strong diagonal in the ma-
trix, indicating that at least part of the hostnames are fetched from
the same continent. Subtracting the minimum of a column from the
corresponding element in the diagonal reveals that up to 11.6 % of
the hostname requests are served from their own continent. This
locality of hostnames availability provides evidence that a consid-
erable fraction of content is replicated in different regions of the
world. Note, by choosing the granularity of countries, the existing
diversity within continents is hidden. In addition, we observe an
almost identical behavior for hostnames requested from Africa and
Europe. Two factors are likely to cause this behavior: (i) a limited
number of traces from Africa and (ii) the fact that Internet connec-
tivity in Africa is mostly provided via Europe coupled to the lack of
local content replication infrastructure. Oceania and Asia localize
to a lesser degree than either Europe or North America.
4.1.2 Content-dependent Replication
Content varies in both popularity and type. This is the reason
why we distinguish not only popular and less popular hostnames,
but also different types of embedded objects (see Section 2). In this
section, we reﬁne the previous analysis of the relationships between
the locations of content requester and content origin by comparing
with the other two subsets of hostnames: TAIL2000 and EMBED-
DED.
Surprisingly,
the content delivery matrix for TAIL2000 (not
shown) is almost identical to the one for TOP2000 (Table 1). The
largest difference is a stronger concentration towards North Amer-
ica, with up to 1.4 % points higher entries for TAIL2000. This in-
dicates that the degree to which replicated hosting infrastructures
are used in TOP2000 and TAIL2000 is very similar. How does that
relate to the fact that top content has a far better utility in sam-
pling large amounts of the address space than TAIL2000, cf. Sec-
tion 3.4.2? The hosting infrastructures of highly popular content

both on TOP2000 and EMBEDDED,
are distributed to a larger degree within each continent, when com-
pared to hosting infrastructures predominantly used for less popular
content.
When comparing the matrix of EMBEDDED (Table 2) with the
others (TAIL2000 not shown, TOP2000 in Table 1), we observe
that the diagonal is more pronounced for EMBEDDED. This in-
dicates that embedded objects are, on a continent-level, more lo-
cally available than content from the other sets. We notice that
Asia appears stronger for EMBEDDED compared to TOP2000 and
TAIL2000, while North America appears weaker.

Summary
In this section, we analyzed the relative weights of Web con-
tent in different continents. We showed the prevalence of North
America, Europe, and Asia in Web content presence, and how each
region relies on each other. We observed a considerable local avail-
ability of content in most continents, implying that a considerable
fraction of content is replicated across multiple continents.
4.2 A Portrait of Hosting Infrastructures
We turn our attention to the independent hosting infrastructures
that are serving the hostnames from our list.
In this section we
identify the prominent hosting infrastructures, detect where they
are actually located by AS and country, and classify them accord-
ing to their network location footprint. Moreover, we study the geo-
graphic properties of hosting infrastructures and provide a ranking
of countries according to their capability of serving popular Web
content.
4.2.1 Clustering Validation
As ﬁrst step, we validate the output of our algorithm of Sec-
tion Section 2.3. Table 3 presents the top 20 clusters by hostname
count. We ﬁnd out by manually cross-checking that, indeed, all
top 20 clusters correspond to networks that host large amounts of
content.
Moreover, we leverage additional information about the Akamai
and Limelight hosting infrastructures. In the case of Akamai we
know the names present in the A records at the end of the CNAME
chain inside DNS replies, which follow typical patterns.

frastructure clusters.
case of Limelight, we can use the same approach, and also verify
that IP addresses belong to the AS number of Limelight. Scrutiniz-
ing this additional source of information, we ﬁnd a few hostnames
that are not included in the top clusters of Table 3. Typically, such
hostnames are only available at a very small subset of the whole
infrastructure, and are therefore separated in the ﬁrst step of the
clustering algorithm (Section 2.3) due to their unusual features. We
conjecture these hostnames are intentionally treated differently by
the hosting infrastructures.
4.2.2 Clustering Results
Overall, the output of our algorithm leads to the identiﬁcation
of more than 3000 potentially distinct hosting infrastructures. Fig-
ure 5 shows, for each hosting infrastructure cluster, the number of
hostnames from our list that are served by the hosting infrastruc-
ture of that cluster, on a log-log scale. Hosting infrastructure clus-
ters are ranked in decreasing order of hostname count. We observe
that a few hosting infrastructure clusters are serving a large number
of hostnames. Most of the hosting infrastructure clusters serve a
single hostname. Hosting infrastructure clusters that serve a single
hostname have their own BGP preﬁx. We infer that these are likely
to be located in a single facility and in most of the cases serve
non-replicated content. The top 10 largest hosting infrastructures
clusters are serving more than 15 % of the hostnames from our list.
The top 20, still less than 1 % of all clusters, are serving about 20 %
of the hostnames.
The resulting clustering allows us to make qualitative observa-
tions, namely that well-known hosting infrastructures are repre-
sented. Table 3 lists the top 20 clusters in terms of the number
of hostnames from our list. Among them, we ﬁnd well distributed
CDNs such as Akamai, “hyper-giants” such as Google, and data-
centers, such as ThePlanet. Note the different deployment strate-
gies as coined by Leighton [24].
As can be seen in Table 3, we ﬁnd multiple hosting infrastructure
clusters run by the same infrastructure authority. Possible expla-
nations include the observation that different types of services are
hosted by hosting infrastructures, the geographic disparity of the
infrastructure deployment, and acquisition or mergers. For Akamai
and Google, the network footprints of their clusters are different
enough to be separated by the k-means step (ﬁrst step) of the clus-
tering algorithm (Section 2.3), while the ThePlanet clusters are only
separated by the similarity step (second step).
For Akamai, the top two clusters have about twice as many
locations as the other two clusters. Further investigation reveals
that the ﬁrst two Akamai clusters correspond to servers in the
akamai.net second level domain (SLD), and the latter two are
hosted on servers in the akamaiedge.net SLD.
Similar observations are made for the two Google clusters. The
cluster with rank 3 is used for the standard Google services includ-
ing Web search and the YouTube front page. The hostnames in
this cluster are served from more than 200 IP addresses. The clus-
ter with rank 5 hosts doubleclick.net, googleapis.com,
blogspot.com, and several other Google related SLDs, which
are served by 40 to 130 IP addresses each.
For ThePlanet, hostnames rarely map to more than one IP ad-
dress. The clusters only emerge in step 2 of the clustering algo-
rithm (Section 2.3), because the content is hosted on different BGP
preﬁxes.
In addition, Table 3 shows the content-mix that is hosted on dif-
ferent hosting infrastructure clusters as bar-plot. We add CNAMES
(which come out of the Alexa Top 5000) to TOP2000 and report
it as top content.
In addition, we separate hostnames which are
on both TOP2000 and EMBEDDED into a category of its on, top
and embedded, to facilitate the interpretation of the content mix
bar-plot. The order of the categories in the bar-plot (cf. caption
of Table 3) is crafted to allow visually adding content of the top
and embedded category to either the TOP2000 or the EMBEDDED
category.
As expected, embedded content is prevalent on the top host-
ing infrastructures. Several hosting infrastructure clusters even al-
most exclusively serve embedded content, e. g., Limelight, Sky-
rock, Xanga, Edgecast, and the ad-service ivwbox.de. On oth-
ers, e. g., the Akamai clusters, the ﬁrst Google cluster, and AOL,
top content accounts for a large fraction of the served hostnames.
Some hosting infrastructure clusters serve mainly tail content, e. g.,
Wordpress, ThePlanet, and the second Google cluster. This may
appear surprising at ﬁrst, but it is a result of content consolida-
tion. For example, blogs hosted by Google and Wordpress can be
found amongst this content. This highlights how helpful less popu-
lar content can be in identifying and classifying the hosting infras-
tructures. The above mentioned results show that separating the
hosting infrastructure of certain organizations into multiple clus-
ters is both justiﬁed and necessary, because the infrastructures are
not used homogeneously [30].
4.2.3 Geographic Deployment of Hosting Infras-
tructures
The clustering of the hosting infrastructures presented in the pre-
vious section is agnostic with respect to geographic locations. To
provide insight about the geographic deployment of the different
clusters as well as to better understand the degree of co-location
in the content infrastructure, we map the clusters to the geographic
locations of their preﬁxes.
Distinguishing between content infrastructures that rely on a few
