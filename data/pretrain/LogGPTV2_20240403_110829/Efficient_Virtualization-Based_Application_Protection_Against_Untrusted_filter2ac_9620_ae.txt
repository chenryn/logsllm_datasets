### TCB and P-MAPS Comparison

TCB. P-MAPS is conceptually similar to our scheme at a high level. However, the detailed specifications of P-MAPS are not publicly available, which precludes a comprehensive comparison.

### Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) Technology

Intel SGX [10] enhances application security by extending hardware processors. It introduces Enclaves—isolated memory regions for code and data within an application’s address space. Only code executing within the same enclave can access its data, and any attempts to access this data, even from privileged software or System Management Mode (SMM), are rejected. Data exchanged between the processor cache and main memory is encrypted, making bus sniffing attacks ineffective.

Compared to AppShield, Intel SGX offers stronger security, particularly against bus sniffing attacks. However, it incurs a performance overhead due to the frequent encryption and decryption of data. In contrast, AppShield operates at native speed without any cryptographic operations on memory accesses.

### Microkernel-Based Protection

EROS [26], Perseus [24], Microsoft’s NGSCB [13], and Nizza [16] are microkernel-based solutions. These systems aim to run commodity operating systems and untrusted applications in low-assurance partitions, while applications with higher security requirements run in high-assurance partitions, isolated and protected by the microkernel. However, these solutions often face compatibility issues, as they may require splitting or redesigning applications.

### Virtualization-Based Protection

Approaches like TERRA [14] and Proxos [31] use hypervisor-based trust partitioning to isolate and protect applications in trusted domains with application-specific operating systems. These systems have a large Trusted Computing Base (TCB) because they include all secure domains. Additionally, they remain vulnerable if the application-specific OSes are compromised.

OverShadow [6], CHAOS [5], and SP3 [34] aim to protect entire application executions against malicious applications and OSes. However, they require complex encryption and decryption operations, which can reduce performance and increase latency. None of these systems claim to protect against mapping reorder attacks, leaving the integrity of data and code potentially vulnerable to a compromised OS.

InkTag [17] protects applications and verifies OS behavior using paraverification, but this technique requires modifying the kernel source code, which is not always feasible. Virtual Ghost [12] provides security through ghost memory, but it also requires compiler instrumentation on kernel code and complete control-flow integrity checking, which are challenging to implement in practice.

### BIOS-Based Protection

Lockdown [33] uses a BIOS-assisted lightweight hypervisor and an ACPI-based mechanism to create two switchable worlds: a green world for trusted applications and a red world for untrusted applications. It provides verifiable protection via a trusted path built on LEDs. The main drawback is the high switch latency, approximately 40 seconds. SecureSwitch [30], a similar system, has a lower switch latency of about 6 seconds. Both approaches require shutting down one world to run another, preventing simultaneous execution. In contrast, AppShield allows coexistence, enabling protected and unprotected applications to run simultaneously.

### Conclusions

In this paper, we present the design and implementation of AppShield, a system that reliably and flexibly protects critical applications with complete isolation, rich functionalities, and high efficiency. AppShield addresses newly identified threats where the kernel manipulates address mapping. We implemented a prototype using a small bare-metal hypervisor and evaluated its performance impact on CPU computation, disk I/O, and network I/O using both micro and macro benchmarks. The results show that AppShield is lightweight and efficient.
