User:  Please explain the main difference between HTTP protocol and HTTPS protocol, and provide an application scenario.
Assistant: The main difference between the HTTP protocol and the HTTPS protocol lies in the security of data transmission. The HTTP protocol is transmitted in plain text, and the data is easy to be stolen, tampered with and forged, and the security of the data is not guaranteed; while the HTTPS protocol is encrypted and transmitted through SSL/TLS, and the data is encrypted during transmission to ensure the security of the data. One application scenario is that when making online payments, using the HTTPS protocol can ensure the security of the user's personal and bank information during transmission and prevent it from being stolen or tampered with by hackers.
