### Simulation and Analysis of Link-Access Guarantees

#### Path-Identifiers and Bandwidth
- **Bandwidth Ratio**: The ratio of requested bandwidth to allocated bandwidth.
- **Legitimate Paths**: Even under extreme attack scenarios, the ratio of legitimate paths remains close to the theoretical packet service probability, ensuring high guarantees.

#### Packet Service Probability
- **Service Rate**: The service rate is much higher than probabilistic guarantees, as illustrated in the figure.
- **Stationary Bandwidth Utilization**: This is derived from the stationary packet service probability of an M/M/1/k queueing system.

#### Link-Access Guarantees
- **Attack Location Independence**: Next, we demonstrate that link-access guarantees are independent of the attack location.
- **Simulation Setup**: For this simulation, we use a 40-path unbalanced tree (Fig. 3), with 200 sources assigned to each leaf node.

#### Queueing System Analysis
- **Derivation**: The stationary packet service probability for an M/M/1/k queueing system is given by:
  \[
  P(\text{ISI} \mid S) = \frac{p(1 - p_s)}{1 - p_s}
  \]
  where \( p \) is the request rate and \( p_s \) is the service rate.

#### Defense Scheme Performance
- **Request Drop Ratio**: Figures 4 and 5 show the request drop ratio and service probability of legitimate paths.
- **Error Bars**: Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals.

#### Aggregation Effect
- **Aggregation Impact**: Figure 6 illustrates the request drop ratio of legitimate paths with respect to attack location.
- **Buffer Space Allocation**: Our scheme provides uniform protection against flooding attacks, regardless of the attackers' location.
- **TVA Performance**: TVA's performance is highly dependent on the buffer space assigned to nearby domains.

#### Aggregation and Protocol Conformance
- **Aggregation Increase**: As the fraction of bots increases, the request service ratio for legitimate paths also increases.
- **Bandwidth Distinguishability**: Bandwidth alone cannot distinguish between attack and legitimate paths when the same request rates occur in all paths.

#### Rolling Attacks
- **Rolling Attack Evaluation**: We evaluate the effectiveness of our protocol against rolling attacks.
- **Simulation Setup**: A 64-path balanced tree is configured such that the number of nodes attached to leaf nodes is identical.
- **Time Variation**: Figure 8 shows the time variation of goodput ratio at the congested link.

#### Conclusion
- **Differential Guarantees**: Our design provides differential link-access guarantees based on domain contaminations.
- **Effectiveness**: The results show the effectiveness of our design in providing link-access guarantees that are independent of the location of global attack sources.
