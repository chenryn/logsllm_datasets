User: How to configure domain-based virtual hosting to support multiple websites?
Assistant: To configure a domain name-based virtual host to support multiple websites, you need to follow the steps below: 1. Determine the domain names of the multiple websites that need to be supported, for example, the domain name of website A is www.a.com, and the domain name of website B is www. .b.com. 2. Create a default website on the server to handle requests that do not match any virtual host domain name. The domain name of the default website can be set to the IP address or hostname of the server. 3. Add multiple virtual host configurations in the configuration file of the web server, one for each domain name. For example, in the Apache server, you can create a virtual host configuration file www.a.com.conf and www.b.com.conf in the httpd.conf or sites-available directory, respectively containing the following content: ``` <VirtualHost *:80> ServerAdmin admin@a.com ServerName www.a.com DocumentRoot /var/www/a </VirtualHost> <VirtualHost *:80> ServerAdmin admin@b.com ServerName www.b.com DocumentRoot /var/www /b </VirtualHost> ``` Among them, DocumentRoot specifies the root directory of each website. 4. Restart the web server to make the configuration take effect. Enter the URL addresses of www.a.com and www.b.com in the browser, and you should be able to access different websites. Note: When configuring domain name-based virtual hosting, you need to ensure that DNS resolution resolves each domain name to the server's IP address.
