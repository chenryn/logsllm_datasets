proposed blocks since in practice many transactions in a
received block will already have been received and validated
by the node as it attempts to construct its own contribution
to the block chain; (b) execution time is a poor metric in
the context of Bitcoin, since miners are concerned with
actual monetary operating cost; (c) since mining is typically
performed using GPUs and to a lesser extent FPGAs and
ASICs, which are far more efﬁcient at computing hash
collisions, the CPU cost measured here is likely insigniﬁcant.
Finally, our experiment neglects the load on a node both
from processing incoming transactions and from solving
the proof of work. Again, we contend that most nodes will
probably use GPUs for mining, and as such the latter is
not an issue. The former, however, remains an unknown. At

will then be spent in actual transactions, resulting in far lower transaction
volumes.

VIII. PREVIOUS WORK
A. E-Cash and Bitcoin
Electronic cash has long been a research topic for cryp-
tographers. Many cryptographic e-cash systems focus on
user privacy and typically assume the existence of a semi-
trusted coin issuer or bank. E-cash schemes largely break
down into online schemes where users have contact with
a bank or registry and ofﬂine schemes where spending can
occur even without a network connection. Chaum introduced
the ﬁrst online cryptographic e-cash system [30] based on
RSA signatures, later extending this work to the ofﬂine
setting [31] by de-anonymizing users who double-spent.
Many subsequent works improved upon these techniques
while maintaining the requirement of a trusted bank: for
example, by making coins divisible [32, 33] and reducing
wallet size [34]. One exception to the rule above comes
from Sander and Ta-Shma [35] who presciently developed
an alternative model that is reminiscent of our proposal: the
central bank is replaced with a hash chain and signatures
with accumulators. Unfortunately the accumulator was not
practical, a central party was still required, and no real-world
system existed to compute the chain.
Bitcoin’s primary goal, on the other hand, is not anonymity.
It has its roots in a non-academic proposal by Wei Dai
for a distributed currency based on solving computational
problems [36]. In Dai’s original proposal anyone could create
currency, but all transactions had to be broadcast to all clients.
A second variant limited currency generation and transaction
broadcast to a set of servers, which is effectively the approach
Bitcoin takes. This is a marked distinction from most, if not
all, other e-cash systems since there is no need to select one
or more trusted parties. There is a general assumption that
a majority of the Bitcoin nodes are honest, but anyone can
join a node to the Bitcoin network, and anyone can get the
entire transaction graph. An overview of Bitcoin and some
of its shortcomings was presented by Barber et. al. in [2].
B. Anonymity
Numerous works have shown that “pseudonymized” graphs
can be re-identiﬁed even under passive analysis. Narayanan
and Shmatikov [5] showed that real world social networks
can be passively de-anonymized. Similarly, Backstrom et
al. [37] constructed targeted attacks against anonymized
social networks to test for relationships between vertices.
Previously, Narayanan and Shmatikov de-anonymized users
in the Netﬂix prize data set by correlating data from
IMDB [38].
Bitcoin itself came into existence in 2009 and is now
beginning to receive scrutiny from privacy researchers. De-
anonymization techniques were applied effectively to Bitcoin
even at its relatively small 2011 size by Reid and Harrigan [3].
Ron and Shamir examined the general structure of the Bitcoin
network graph [1] after its nearly 3-fold expansion. Finally,
we have been made privately aware of two other early-stage
efforts to examine Bitcoin anonymity.
IX. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Zerocoin is a distributed e-cash scheme that provides
strong user anonymity and coin security under the assumption
that there is a distributed, online, append-only transaction
store. We use Bitcoin to provide such a store and the
backing currency for our scheme. After providing general
deﬁnitions, we proposed a concrete realization based on RSA
accumulators and non-interactive zero-knowledge signatures
of knowledge. Finally, we integrated our construction into
Bitcoin and measured its performance.
Our work leaves several open problems. First, although our
scheme is workable, the need for a double-discrete logarithm
proof leads to large proof sizes and veriﬁcation times. We
would prefer a scheme with both smaller proofs and greater
speed. This is particularly important when it comes to
reducing the cost of third-party veriﬁcation of Zerocoin
transactions. There are several promising constructions in the
cryptographic literature, e.g., bilinear accumulators, mercurial
commitments [13, 39]. While we were not able to ﬁnd an
analogue of our scheme using alternative components, it is
possible that further research will lead to other solutions.
Ideally such an improvement could produce a drop-in
replacement for our existing implementation.
Second, Zerocoin currently derives both its anonymity
and security against counterfeiting from strong cryptographic
assumptions at the cost of substantially increased computa-
tional complexity and size. As discussed in section VI-B,
anonymity is relatively cheap, and this cost is principally
driven by the anti-counterfeiting requirement, manifesting
itself through the size of the coins and the proofs used.
In Bitcoin, counterfeiting a coin is not computationally
prohibitive, it is merely computationally costly, requiring the
user to obtain control of at least 51% of the network. This
provides a possible alternative to our standard cryptographic
assumptions: rather than the strong assumption that com-
puting discrete logs is infeasible, we might construct our
scheme on the weak assumption that there is no ﬁnancial
incentive to break our construction as the cost of computing
a discrete log exceeds the value of the resulting counterfeit
coins.
For example, if we require spends to prove that fresh
and random bases were used in the commitments for the
corresponding mint transaction (e.g., by selecting the bases
for the commitment from the hash of the coin serial number
and proving that the serial number is fresh), then it appears
that an attacker can only forge a single zerocoin per discrete
log computation. Provided the cost of computing such a
discrete log is greater than the value of a zerocoin, forging a
coin is not proﬁtable. How small this allows us to make
408

the coins is an open question. There is relatively little
work comparing the asymptotic difﬁculty of solving multiple
distinct discrete logs in a ﬁxed group,23 and it is not clear
how theory translates into practice. We leave these questions,
along with the security of the above proposed construction,
as issues for future work.
Finally, we believe that further research could lead to
different
tradeoffs between security, accountability, and
anonymity. A common objection to Bitcoin is that it can
facilitate money laundering by circumventing legally binding
ﬁnancial reporting requirements. We propose that additional
protocol modiﬁcations (e.g., the use of anonymous creden-
tials [40]) might allow users to maintain their anonymity
while demonstrating compliance with reporting requirements.

input and outputs a set C and transaction string R using
