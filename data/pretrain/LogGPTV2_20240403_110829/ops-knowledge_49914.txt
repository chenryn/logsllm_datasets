User: Please explain what is virtualization technology (virtualization), and list several popular virtual machine software.
Assistant: Virtualization technology is a technology that distributes multiple operating systems or applications onto a single physical computer. This process is accomplished through software, called a hypervisor, which divides a physical computer into multiple virtual environments, each of which can run a separate operating system or application. The following are several popular virtual machine software: 1. VMware Workstation: A desktop virtualization software that can run virtual machines on Windows and Linux operating systems. 2. VirtualBox: A free desktop virtualization software that can run virtual machines on a variety of operating systems. 3. Hyper-V: A software primarily used for server virtualization, available on Windows Server. 4. KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine): An open source server virtualization software, especially suitable for Linux operating systems. 5. Docker: A containerization platform that packages applications into an independent container so that these containers can run concurrently on the same physical computer. Virtualization technology can help enterprises use hardware resources more efficiently, improve security and flexibility, and simplify management and maintenance tasks.
