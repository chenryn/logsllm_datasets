User: In old consumer configs of Kafka, there is a property num.consumer.fetchers in order to configure the number fetcher threads used to fetch data.
In the new consumer configs of Kafka, is there any property with this same function?
And if not, how is the new consumer working on that?
Assistant: The new consumer is single-threaded (excluding the background heartbeat thread), so no equivalent config is offered.  
By the way, 'num.consumer.fetchers' does not specify the number of fetcher threads as the doc says. It actually controls the possible maximum number of fetcher threads that Kafka can create.
