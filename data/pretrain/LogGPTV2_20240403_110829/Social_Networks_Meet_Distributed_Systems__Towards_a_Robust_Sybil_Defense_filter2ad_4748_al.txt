### Attack Resilience in the Face of Heavy Churn and Strategic Sybil Attacks

We first describe our simulation environment and then examine the impact of various parameters on the robustness of the system. Additionally, we evaluate the effectiveness of state-of-the-art Sybil defense schemes when applied to social overlay networks experiencing churn.

#### 6.1 Experimental Setup

**Datasets:**
Table 1 lists the datasets used in our experiments. These datasets have been previously studied in the Social Network Security (SNSD) field [23, 30, 21]. The AstroPhysics [4] and Facebook [29] graphs are undirected, while the Epinions [4] dataset is directed. Following the recommendation in [24], we convert the directed graph of Epinions into an undirected graph by considering only node pairs with edges in both directions. In our experiments, we focus on the largest connected component (LCC) of each dataset to represent the honest region.

**Metrics:**
We measure the system's robustness in terms of network connectivity and attack resilience using the following metrics:

- **Disconnection Probability:** This metric measures the probability that an online honest node belongs to the LCC of online honest nodes. A lower disconnection probability indicates a higher likelihood of a path between any two online honest nodes consisting only of honest nodes as intermediate nodes.
  
- **Escape Probability:** This metric measures the probability that a uniform random walk of length \( w = O(\log((1 - c) \cdot n)) \), starting from a node in the LCC of online honest nodes, will escape into the Sybil region. Most SNSD schemes, whether decentralized [32, 31, 18] or centralized [13], use variants of uniform random walks for their effectiveness. Therefore, the escape probability metric effectively captures the notion of attack resilience for a generic SNSD scheme.

**Overlay Links:**
- **One-Hop Heuristic:** Each node adds overlay links to its 1-hop neighbors (Fig. 1(b)).
- **Two-Hop Heuristic:** Each node adds overlay links to all its 2-hop neighbors, in addition to the 1-hop network (Fig. 1(c)). This heuristic is similar to the one proposed in the MCON study [28].
- **Random Heuristic:** Each node initiates links to at most \( k \) of its 2-hop neighbors, chosen uniformly at random.
- **Common Neighbors Heuristic:** This heuristic differs from the Random Heuristic in the selection process. For each node \( v \), the neighborhood overlap of each 2-hop neighbor \( y \in N_2(v) \) is computed as \( |N(v) \cap N(y)| \). The top \( k \) 2-hop neighbors with the highest overlap are selected for link initiation.
- **Degree Heuristic:** Each node generates a ranked list of its 2-hop neighbors based on their node degrees and selects the top \( k \) for link initiation.

**Default Experimental Settings:**
- **Graph Representation:** We use a graph from Table 1 to represent the honest region. The Sybil region is generated with an equal number of Sybil nodes as there are honest nodes (\( n \)). The Sybil region follows the Barab√°si-Albert preferential attachment model [9] with an average node degree five times that of the honest region.
- **Attack Edges:** The ratio of the number of 1-hop attack edges (\( g \)) created between honest and Sybil nodes to the number of honest nodes (\( n \)) is set to 0.05 (\( g/n = 0.05 \)). The adversary employs a strategic attack where each attack edge is placed based on degree centrality, meaning the endpoints are chosen with a probability proportional to their degrees in their respective regions.
- **Comparison with Previous Studies:** Our experiments show that this degree-centrality-based attack strategy is more potent than those used in previous studies.
