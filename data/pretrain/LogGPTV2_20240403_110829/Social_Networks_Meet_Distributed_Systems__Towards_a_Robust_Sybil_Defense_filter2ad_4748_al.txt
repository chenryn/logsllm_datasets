attack resilience in the face of heavy churn and a strategic
Sybil attack. We ﬁrst describe our simulation environment,
and then study the impact of various parameters on the ro-
bustness of the system. We also examine the suitability of
applying oﬀ-the-shelf state-of-the-art Sybil defense schemes
on social overlay networks incurring churn.
6.1 Experimental Setup
Datasets. Table 1 shows the datasets used in our experi-
ments. We note that these datasets have already been stud-
ied in previous works in the SNSD ﬁeld [23, 30, 21]. While
the graphs of AstroPhysics [4] and Facebook [29] are undi-
rected in nature, the relationships in the original dataset of
Epinions [4] are directed. As recommended in [24], we derive
an undirected graph by considering only the node pairs with
edges in both the directions in the original directed graph.
In our experiments, we consider only the largest connected
component in each dataset to represent the honest region.
Metrics. We measure the system robustness in terms of
network connectivity and attack resilience respectively with:
• Disconnection Probability: It measures the probability of
513an online honest node belonging to the largest connected
component (LCC) of online honest nodes. The smaller the
disconnection probability, the greater the likelihood of a
path between any two online honest nodes comprising only
honest nodes as its intermediate nodes.
• Escape Probability: It measures the probability of a uni-
form random walk of length w = O(log((1− c)∗ n)) start-
ing from a node in the largest connected component of
online honest nodes to escape into the Sybil region. We
note that most SNSD schemes, in decentralized [32, 31,
18] as well as centralized [13] settings, employ variants of
the uniform random walks for their eﬀectiveness. Thus,
we believe that the escape probability metric captures the
notion of attack resilience of a generic SNSD scheme.
overlay links to only its 1-hop neighbors (Fig. 1(b)).
most k of all its 2-hop neighbors uniformly at random.
Baseline Heuristics. We compare the system robustness
enabled by our proposed heuristic (MinEC) with that of:
• One-Hop heuristic is the default one, where each node has
• Two-Hop heuristic mimics the one proposed in the MCON
study [28], where each node adds overlay links to all its
2-hop neighbors on top of the 1-hop network (Fig. 1(c)).
• Random heuristic enables each node to initiate links to at
• Common Neighbors heuristic diﬀers from the Random one
in the selection process of the k 2-hop neighbors. For each
node v, the extent of neighborhood overlap of each 2-hop
neighbor y ∈ N2({v}) is computed as |N ({v}) ∩ N ({y})|,
and then the top k of these 2-hop neighbors are selected
for initiation of the links.
• Degree heuristic enables each node to generate its ranked
list comprising k of all its 2-hop neighbors with the highest
node degrees.
Default Experimental Settings. Here we describe our
experimental procedure with default settings, as shown in
Table 2. We consider a graph from the Table 1 to repre-
sent the honest region. For the Sybil region, we generate as
many Sybil nodes as there are honest nodes (n). The graph
structure of the Sybil region, however, follows the Barab´asi-
Albert preferential attachment model [9]. The average node
degree of the Sybil region is set to 5 times that of the hon-
est region. Furthermore, the ratio of the number of 1-hop
attack edges (g) created between honest and Sybil nodes to
the number of honest nodes (n) is set to 0.05 (= g/n). The
adversary employs a strategic attack where each attack edge
is placed based on degree-centrality in that its honest and
Sybil endpoints are chosen with a probability proportional
to their degrees in their respective regions. Our experiments
reveal that this degree centrality-based attack strategy is
much stronger than the one used in previous studies where
