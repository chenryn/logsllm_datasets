If the \" \"message continues to occur even after re-starting \" \"the signalling process several times then contact \" \"your technical support representative for \" \"assistance.\" TSP tunnels are signalled using the RSVP protocol.  When a TSP tunnel is configured or enabled at the head  end the Signaller initiates RSVP signalling by requesting  that an RSVP Path message be sent to the tunnel destination.  The Path message establishes path state information for the  tunnel in each of the nodes that it traverses. Tag switching  state is established when a corresponding Resv message  is sent down the reverse path requesting tagging. This  requires that the signalling module at the tunnel  destination be notified of arriving Path messages that  terminate locally so that it can initiate a Resv message for  each. It is also required that the RSVP module at every  hop along path have access to a mechanism which allows it to  install or remove the tag switching state requested in Resv  messages. In order to perform these two functions  the signalling module registers a Listener and a Tag Handler  with RSVP respectively. The error message being addressed"
