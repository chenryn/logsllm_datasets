简介

本文包含日志的参数介绍、产生原因、处理建议等，为用户进行系统诊断和维护提供参考。
除了 H3C MER系列路由器特有的日志信息外，本文还包含 H3C MER系列路由器 Release0809
版本基于的Comware V7平台版本的日志信息，其中的部分日志信息本产品可能并不支持，请以设
备的实际情况为准。
本文假设您已具备数据通信技术知识，并熟悉H3C网络产品。
1.1 日志格式说明
缺省情况下，日志信息根据输出方向不同，采用如下格式：
• 日志主机方向（RFC 3164定义的格式）：
TIMESTAMP Sysname %%vendorMODULE/severity/MNEMONIC: location; CONTENT
• 非日志主机方向：
Prefix TIMESTAMP Sysname MODULE/severity/MNEMONIC: CONTENT
表1-1 日志字段说明
字段 描述
优先级标识符，仅存在于输出方向为日志主机的日志信息。优先级的计算公式为：facility
×8＋severity
 • facility表示日志主机的记录工具，由 命令设置，主要用于
info-center loghost
在日志主机端标志不同的日志来源，查找、过滤对应日志源的日志
• severity表示日志信息的严重等级，具体含义请参见表1-2
信息类型标识符，仅存在于输出方向为非日志主机方向的日志信息
Prefix • 百分号（%）：表示该日志信息为Informational级别及以上级别的日志
• 星号（*）：表示该日志信息为Debug级别的日志
时间戳记录了日志信息产生的时间，方便用户查看和定位系统事件
• 日志主机方向：时间戳精确到秒，用户可以通过
info-center timestamp
TIMESTAMP 命令自定义时间显示格式
loghost
• 非日志主机方向：时间戳精确到毫秒，用户可以通过 命
info-center timestamp
令自定义时间显示格式
Sysname 生成该日志信息的设备的名称或IP地址
厂家标志，%%10表示本日志信息由H3C设备生成
%%vendor
只有发往日志主机的日志中携带该字段
MODULE 生成该日志信息的功能模块的名称
severity 日志信息的等级，具体说明请参见表1-2
MNEMONIC 助记符，本字段为该日志信息的概述，是一个不超过32个字符的字符串
定位信息，用来标识该日志信息的产生者。本字段为可选字段，只有在日志信息发往日志
主机时才会存在，可能包含以下参数：
location
• -MDC=XX，表示生成该日志的MDC的编号
53
字段 描述
• -DevIp=XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX，表示日志发送者的源IP
• -Slot=XX，表示生成该日志的Slot编号
• -Chassis=XX-Slot=XX，表示生成该日志的Chassis编号和Slot编号
格式如下：
-attribute1=x-attribute2=y…-attributeN=z
定位信息和日志描述之间用分号和空格“; ”分隔
日志手册中以输出到非日志主机方向的日志为例，不提供location字段。
该日志的具体内容，包含事件或错误发生的详细信息
CONTENT
对于本字段中的可变参数域，本文使用表1-3定义的方式表示
日志信息按严重性可划分为如表1-2所示的八个等级，各等级的严重性依照数值从0～7依次降低。
表1-2 日志严重等级说明
级别 严重程度 描述
0 Emergency 表示设备不可用的信息，如系统授权已到期
1 Alert 表示设备出现重大故障，需要立刻做出反应的信息，如流量超出接口上限
2 Critical 表示严重信息，如设备温度已经超过预警值，设备电源、风扇出现故障等
3 Error 表示错误信息，如接口链路状态变化，存储卡拔出等
4 Warning 表示警告信息，如接口连接断开，内存耗尽告警等
5 Notice 表示正常出现但是重要的信息，如通过终端登录设备，设备重启等
表示需要记录的通知信息，如通过命令行输入命令的记录信息，执行ping命令
6 Informational
的日志信息等
7 Debug 表示调试过程产生的信息
本文使用表1-3定义的方式表示日志描述字段中的可变参数域。
