## Abstract
Evaluating and characterizing access ISPs is crucial for consumers seeking alternative services and governments assessing broadband availability. We introduce Dasu, a service that leverages crowdsourcing to characterize ISPs at the network edge. Implemented as an extension to a popular BitTorrent client [5], Dasu has been available since July 2010. Although the prototype uses BitTorrent, its design is agnostic to the host application. The demo will showcase our current implementation using both a prerecorded execution trace and a live run.

## 1. Introduction
Evaluating and characterizing access ISPs is essential for subscribers, companies, and governments. Given the lack of publicly available information, several recent projects have explored various approaches for profiling edge network services. These range from web-based technologies to dedicated servers and special networking devices. However, these methods often face trade-offs between extensibility, vantage point coverage, and continuous monitoring.

### Challenges with Existing Approaches
- **Dedicated Servers**: While scalable, they cannot capture the end-user perspective, which is typically behind middle boxes and not open to unsolicited measurements.
- **Web-Based Approaches**: They can capture the user’s perspective but are susceptible to whitelisting by ISPs and limited by infrastructure and bandwidth costs.
- **Home Network Devices**: Provide continuous monitoring but are geographically limited and inflexible, affecting the representativeness of the data.

We argue that hosting ISP characterization on end systems running network-intensive applications can avoid these trade-offs. Our approach, implemented in a BitTorrent client, passively monitors user-generated traffic, offering a scalable and flexible solution. By combining passive monitoring with dynamically extensible active measurements, it achieves the effectiveness of hardware-based solutions without their associated costs.

## 2. Dasu System
Dasu is implemented as an extension to a popular BitTorrent client [5]. It passively monitors user-generated BitTorrent traffic, collecting detailed performance data. The system includes:

### 2.1 Data Collection
- **Per-Torrent Statistics**: Number of RSTs received, upload and download rates.
- **Application-Wide Statistics**: Total upload and download rates, number of active torrents.
- **System-Wide Statistics**: Connection-related statistics reported by the operating system, such as the number of active, current, and passive connections, and failed connections.

### 2.2 Active Measurements
Each Dasu client includes an extensible set of probe modules for active measurements, such as traceroute, ping, and the MLab’s Network Diagnostic Tool (NDT). These probes add results to the client’s working memory or knowledge base, which drives the rule engine to fire monitoring rules and launch new probes as needed.

### 2.3 System Components
- **Configuration Server**: Registers clients and provides configuration files.
- **Monitoring Rule Servers**: Serve measurement rules for both passive and active monitoring.
- **Database Server**: Collects and stores measurement results.
- **Web Server**: Provides experiment descriptions.

### 2.4 Monitoring Rules
Rules specify conditions and consequences. For example, a rule might trigger a Vuze BitTorrent Speed Test when requested, adding the result to the knowledge base and retracting the triggering fact.

### 2.5 Demonstration
The demonstration will showcase the current implementation of Dasu using both a prerecorded execution trace and a live run, highlighting the plugin interface and the execution of monitoring rules.
