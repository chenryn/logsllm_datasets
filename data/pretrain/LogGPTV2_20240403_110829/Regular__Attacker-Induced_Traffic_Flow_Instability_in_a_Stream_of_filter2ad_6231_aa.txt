Abstract—We show that a stream of automated vehicles travel-
ing along the highway can be destabilized to catastrophic effect
through modiﬁcation of the control laws of individual vehicles.
Speciﬁcally, one active attacker who introduces errors, in addition
to one or many passive attackers who amplify the error, may,
by the modiﬁcation of a single parameter,
induce oscillatory
trafﬁc jams that cause delay, driver discomfort, excess energy
expenditure, and increased risk of accidents that could result in
serious injury or death. We determine the conditions under which
an attacker(s) is able to violate the primary design criterion of
automated vehicle streams, known as string stability, to guarantee
system instability. Furthermore, we prove that once the stream
has been destabilized it will continually deviate from the desired
state, even in the absence of additional input to the system—i.e.
the jammed condition will self-perpetuate. Through a comparison
with a behavioral human driver model, this work demonstrates
that automated vehicle systems are more vulnerable to disruption
than their non-automated counterparts. The postulated attack is
demonstrated on a scaled system and identiﬁcation of attackers
is discussed.
I. INTRODUCTION
Roadways are seeing ever increasing congestion. Recent
reports showed that by 2010 the number of registered vehicles
worldwide exceeded 1 billion units [1], [2]. The Texas
Transportation Institute 2007 urban mobility study estimates
the time an urban America driver spends delayed in trafﬁc
rose from 14 hours per year in 1982 to 38 hours in 2005,
an increase of over 270%. in 2005 alone a total of 14.2
billion hours and 2.5 billion gallons of fuel were wasted due
to congested trafﬁc [3]. As trafﬁc density worldwide increases
traditional human driving is projected to worsen the situation,
as human drivers are incapable of maintaining stable trafﬁc ﬂow
patterns in dense trafﬁc, instead causing stop-and-go waves to
propagate through the system. This phenomenon occurs even
in the absence of obstructions such as an accident or merging
vehicles [4]. Congestion and stop-and-go trafﬁc increase driver
and passenger stress, as well as the possibility of accidents.
Additionally, highway systems are underutilized due to large
inter-vehicle following distances required as a result of slow
human reaction times.
Automated vehicles promise to increase roadway capacity,
efﬁciency, and safety by assisting drivers, or removing the
human element of driving altogether [5]–[7]. A fully automated
highway systems (AHS), where vehicles follow each other in
closely knit groups called platoons are projected as a long
term technology (2025-30) according to the National Highway
Trafﬁc Safety Administration (NHTSA) [8]. This report also
projects the implementation of adaptive cruise control (ACC),
and Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC), as near-
term (2012-17) and midterm (2017-25) solutions. These semi-
automated technologies use local sensors to maintain relative
inter-vehicle spacing and velocity according to a longitudinal
control scheme, while the human driver maintains control
over the steering of the vehicle [9]–[13]. Additionally CACC
incorporates inter-vehicle communication, allowing vehicles
to safely merge or change lanes within the automated trafﬁc
system [14], or predict acceleration requirements to maintain
smaller safe inter-vehicle spacing [9].
While the theoretical beneﬁts of automated vehicles are
clear, we propose that vehicle automation technologies actually
make transportation systems more vulnerable to disruption by
malicious actors. In this work we focus on current and near-term
vehicle automation, ACC and CACC. These semi-automated
systems are designed to ensure string stability, which guarantees
inter-vehicle spacing and velocity errors will attenuate toward
the rear of the trafﬁc system/vehicle stream [15]. This is critical
as string stability is intended to ensure trafﬁc ﬂow stability
even in the presence of perturbation. Our work shows that
the act of automating vehicles, and the inherently coupled
nature of such systems when traveling together, makes them
vulnerable to destabilizing attacks. Speciﬁcally, we show it is
possible for malicious actors to induce global string instability
and instability in a stream of automated vehicles by exploiting
weaknesses in the underlying control mechanisms. The effect
on the system as a whole is to cause trafﬁc instability which
manifests itself as large velocity deviations and stop-and-go
waves (phantom trafﬁc jams), resulting in congested trafﬁc
and wasted energy consumption. Such instability could cause
catastrophic failure of the system, including multi-vehicle
collisions and human fatalities. The beneﬁts of automation
are effectively destroyed in such a scenario.
The contributions of this work include:
• Existing work [16], [17] on the security of the control
systems of automated vehicles has focused on vehicular
platooning and localized effects (e.g. causing the platoon
to become unstable). While the control algorithms we
study are drawn from the platooning literature, they are
being considered for nearer term deployment in CACC

systems or have already been used in some form for ACC
[18]. The attacks we demonstrate are thus relevant for
present (ACC) and near-term systems (CACC), not just
future platooned systems.
• We also study the efﬁcacy of our attack in mixed-trafﬁc
scenarios, wherein a combination of automated and non-
automated vehicles use the same lane (a common condition
on today’s roads), and show that attackers in control of a
critical number of vehicles are still able to induce trafﬁc
irregularities that lead to jams and/or severely decreased
roadway capacity.
• Ours is the ﬁrst work to offer experimental validation of
attacks, using scaled models of vehicles, which shows that
actual vehicle dynamics do not prevent vehicular control
systems from being successfully exploited.
A. Related work
As mentioned previously string stability is considered one
of the most important issues in the safety and performance of
systems of automated vehicles [19], [20]. The relative stability
of automated vehicles has been studied extensively in the
context of string stability and string instability, or the slinky
effect as it is referred to in some works. These concepts refer
to the attenuation, or ampliﬁcation, of relative spacing and
velocity errors between consecutive vehicles that are interacting
autonomously [9], [18], [21]–[25]. Methods have been proposed
to simplify the analysis of string stability and aid in selecting
appropriate gains [19], [20]. A common theme amongst all of
these works is the assumption that all vehicles in the system are
utilizing the same control algorithm and acting appropriately.
The aforementioned works do not consider operation in a
adversarial environment. In particular, they assume vehicles in
the system behave strictly according to the speciﬁed control
law, but not the possibility of malicious actors within the
stream of vehicles. Additionally these works assume that all
information exchanged is authentic. These assumptions leave
the proposed control algorithms open to the possibility of
destabilizing attacks.
A non-destabilizing attack against automated vehicular
transportation systems detailed in [26] focuses on degrading
efﬁciency by causing surrounding vehicles to needlessly expend
energy. This is accomplished by optimal sequences of braking
and acceleration. This attack focuses on trafﬁc stability from
the perspective of energy expenditure, but is not destabilizing
in a strict sense.
The operation of automated vehicles in an adversarial envi-
ronment is discussed in [16], where a platooning environment is
explicitly considered utilizing a bidirectional control algorithm.
Two attacks are detailed demonstrating that given a system
of vehicles utilizing the same control scheme (homogeneous
case), an attack vehicle can judiciously modify their gains to
affect the stability of the platoon. Our attack is more general
in that semi-automated systems such as ACC and CACC are
not constrained to a platooning structure but are simply acting
in a cooperative manner due to the proximity of neighboring
vehicles, and need not be utilizing similar control schemes. In
short we consider a cooperative heterogeneous system of semi-
automated vehicles. In [17] a number of additional attacks,
stemming from misinformation and vehicle misbehavior, were
considered against a platooning law employing vehicle-to-
vehicle communications. Our work differs from each of these
in its scope, in that we consider the impact on the entire trafﬁc
stream and not just a single platoon. Additionally, the laws
examined in previous work were designed with the cooperation
of vehicles in mind; i.e. they implicitly assume that other
vehicles are following the same control law. The ACC-like
laws we examine may be used in mixed trafﬁc without the
assumption that other vehicles follow similar, or indeed any,
automation law.
The literature does provide stability analysis from the broader
scope of a cyber physical system (CPS), deﬁned as a system
of computational elements collaboratively controlling physical
systems. In [27] threats against such systems are discussed,
including possible vulnerability to resonance as a form of attack.
A related subject, vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANET’s) are
considered by [28]. They discuss the challenging question
of securing inter-vehicle communication in the presence
of malicious drivers, which needs to be considered in the
implementation of CACC systems.
B. Paper structure
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In
Section II we describe the semi-automated vehicle control
algorithms selected for analysis and present a threat model
against such vehicles. The stability and string stability of
a heterogeneous vehicle stream in the presence of attackers
is examined in Section III. The security implications of our
ﬁndings are discussed in Section IV. An experimental validation
of the postulated attack is provided in Section V. Methods
which could be implemented to detect the attack are discussed
in Section VI. Finally, we give concluding remarks and offer
avenues of future work in Section VII.
II. VEHICLE AND THREAT MODELS
We formally describe the control algorithms used for
analysis in this work, the rationale for selecting them, and
the capabilities and goals of the attacker.
A. Automated Vehicle Models
Our analysis focuses on the exploitation of longitudinal
control schemes, which are intended to allow an automated
vehicle to maintain a desired separation/velocity from adjacent
vehicles as they travel a straight path. Currently vehicles with
such capabilities are available from the major manufacturers in
the form of ACC. Vehicles equipped with CACC are expected
to become available in the near future (e.g. [29]). A trafﬁc
system consisting of such automated vehicles is an inherently
coupled system as the motion of each vehicle has the potential
to inﬂuence surrounding vehicles. Thus we consider a coupled
and cooperative system of vehicles traveling on a straight
trajectory at a constant velocity. All vehicles in the system
are assumed to share similar performance characteristics and
utilize the same control law.

We selected ﬁve control laws for analysis that display many
characteristics desired by the highway automation community
(Table I). These laws use various policies to ensure proper inter-
vehicle spacing (constant spacing policy (CSP), variable time
gap (VTG), and constant time gap (CTG)). With reference to
...x i = ji,
the equations given in Table II, xi, ˙xi = vi, ¨xi = αi,
represent the position, velocity, acceleration requirement, and
jerk requirement, of the ith vehicle, respectively. For control
laws 1–3 kp, kd, and kh represent system gains, h0 and h are the
desired steady state time headway and time headway constants,
respectively. The value vd denotes the desired nominal velocity.
Referring to control laws 4 and 5, δi(t), ˙δi(t), τ, and d are
the relative distance and velocity errors, time constant, and
mechanical drag for the ith vehicle, respectively, h is the time
headway in seconds, k1, k5, Cp, Cv, Ca, Kv, and Ka are
system gains.
These laws govern how a vehicle should behave with respect
to the movements of the preceding vehicle1. Due to this
interaction a system of cooperative vehicles can be described
using coupled differential equations. A stream of n vehicles
(Figure 1) using control algorithm 1, for example, can be
described as follows:
˙x1 = v1
˙v1 = kp(x2 − x1 − h ˙x1) + kd( ˙x2 − ˙x1)
...
˙xn−1 = vn−1
˙vn−1 = kp(xn − xn−1 − h ˙xn−1) + kd( ˙xn − ˙xn−1)
˙xn = vn
˙vn = u.

The equivalent state-space representation of the linear-time-
invariant (LTI) system deﬁned by (1) is:
˙x = Ax + Bu
y = Cx

where x = [x1, v1, x2, v2, ..., xn−1, vn−1, xn, vn](cid:2) ∈ R
are the vehicle states, A ∈ R

and u is a scalar input. Because all the vehicle states are
assumed to be measurable C is deﬁned as an identity matrix.
B has one non-zero entry for the lead vehicles input.

While we cannot be certain, without reverse engineering
the control systems of a large number of vehicles, that the
1Describing the kinematics of vehicles using acceleration inputs is general
enough to be applicable to different types of car/engine types. A split level
architecture, wherein an upper-level controller is used to determine the speed
and heading of the vehicle while another controller ensures the vehicle achieves
the commanded speed/direction, allows for the use of a single following law
for heterogeneous vehicle types by abstracting individual vehicle dynamics.

attacker directly controls a vehicle within a stream of automated
vehicles traveling at a steady velocity. One or multiple passive
