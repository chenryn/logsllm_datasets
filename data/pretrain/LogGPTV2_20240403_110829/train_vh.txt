whereby a kernel using 64 kb as a base page size may still use 4 kb
pages for the mmu on older processors.
to distinguish the two attributes, the "mmupagesize" line
(also available since linux 2.6.29)
reports the page size used by the mmu.
.ip
the "locked" indicates whether the mapping is locked in memory
or not.
.ip
the "protectionkey" line (available since linux 4.9, on x86 only)
contains the memory protection key (see
.br pkeys (7))
associated with the virtual memory area.
this entry is present only if the kernel was built with the
.b config_x86_intel_memory_protection_keys
configuration option (since linux 4.6).
.ip
the "vmflags" line (available since linux 3.8)
represents the kernel flags associated with the virtual memory area,
encoded using the following two-letter codes:
.ip
    rd  - readable
    wr  - writable
    ex  - executable
    sh  - shared
    mr  - may read
    mw  - may write
    me  - may execute
    ms  - may share
    gd  - stack segment grows down
    pf  - pure pfn range
    dw  - disabled write to the mapped file
    lo  - pages are locked in memory

    ar  - architecture specific flag
    wf  - wipe on fork (since linux 4.14)
    dd  - do not include area into core dump
    sd  - soft-dirty flag (since linux 3.13)
    mm  - mixed map area

the kernel stores nice values as numbers
in the range 0 (high) to 39 (low),
