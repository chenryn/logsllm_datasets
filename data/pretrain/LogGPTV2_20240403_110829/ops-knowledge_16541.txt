Open a command line terminal and install the AWS CLI. 2. Run the following command to start or stop the instance: To start the instance: aws ec2 start-instances --instance-ids instance_id1 instance_id2 ... instance_idn To stop the instance: aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids instance_id1 instance_id2 ... instance_idn 3 . Replace Instance ID with the ID of the instance you want to stop or start. Using the AWS Management Console: 1. Open the AWS console, go to the EC2 console, and select the instance to stop or start. 2. From the Actions menu, choose Stop Instance or Start Instance. 3. In the confirmation popup, select "Yes" to continue. Caution: Bulk operations may take a while to complete. After you stop an instance, you might incur charges depending on the instance type and duration you used. Make sure to start and stop instances promptly when not needed to avoid unnecessary charges.
