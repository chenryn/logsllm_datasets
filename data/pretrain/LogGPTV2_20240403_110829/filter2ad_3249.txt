**Figure 1: Continuous Classification Results vs. Number of Images Searched**

The figure above illustrates the performance of the continuous fingerprint classification system as the number of images to be searched increases. The results demonstrate that the proposed method maintains a high level of accuracy even with a large number of images.

**Conclusion:**
The use of symmetrical filters in continuous fingerprint classification shows promising results, providing a robust and efficient solution for large-scale fingerprint recognition systems.
