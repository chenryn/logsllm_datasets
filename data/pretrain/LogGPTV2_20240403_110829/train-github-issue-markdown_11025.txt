# Bug report
**What is the current behavior?**
When I upgrade Webpack from 4.29.2 to 4.29.3, import() breaks.
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**
Using a relatively straightforward, up-to-date package.json, code that
formerly worked using import() stops building after upgrading from 4.29.2 to
4.29.3. The error message is, e.g:
    ERROR in ./js/registry.js 22:44
    Module parse failed: Unexpected token (22:44)
    You may need an appropriate loader to handle this file type.
Downgrading to the previous version eliminates this error.
In other words, the bug has been easy for me to reproduce/ toggle on/off since
I isolated the package version bump which introduced it. (I can induce the bug
by `rm -rf node_modules/*; npm install` after upgrading my `package.json` and
just as easily quell it again by the same operation after downgrading the
webpack requirement in `package.json` back down to 4.29.2.)
Apologies, I have not yet had time to come up with a minimal example, but here
are my config files.
package.json: https://gist.github.com/1attice/dde6cd694fcb5202ebb78497772417b5  
webpack.config.js:
https://gist.github.com/1attice/1eef81fbd36ab67b9bd26600bf320e5b  
.babelrc: https://gist.github.com/1attice/906515f7386b5c36d03dcb420872cb04
And here is the code that occasions the error:  
registry.js: https://gist.github.com/1attice/bb922e8e3d155db53ad1942de7ccd31c
**What is the expected behavior?**
Compilation should proceed normally, as under 4.29.2.
webpack version: 4.29.3  
Node.js version: 10.14.1  
Operating System: MacOS 10.14.2
