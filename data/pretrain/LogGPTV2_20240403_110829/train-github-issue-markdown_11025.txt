# Bug Report

## Current Behavior
After upgrading Webpack from version 4.29.2 to 4.29.3, the `import()` function breaks during the build process.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Use a relatively straightforward and up-to-date `package.json`.
2. Upgrade Webpack from version 4.29.2 to 4.29.3.
3. Run the build process (e.g., `npm run build`).

### Error Message
```
ERROR in ./js/registry.js 22:44
Module parse failed: Unexpected token (22:44)
You may need an appropriate loader to handle this file type.
```

### Additional Details
- The issue can be toggled on and off by changing the Webpack version in `package.json` and running `rm -rf node_modules/; npm install`.
- The bug is consistently reproducible with the specified package versions.
