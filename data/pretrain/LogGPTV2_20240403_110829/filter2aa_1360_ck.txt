### Domain Contact Information and Analysis

When registering a domain, three primary contact roles are required: the registrant, administrative, and technical contacts. These can be the same individual or different people. The contact information includes a full name, business name, physical address, telephone number, and email address. This data is provided by the domain registrar to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), making it publicly available through various online resources. However, while ICANN requires accurate information, this is not always enforced, leading to potential inaccuracies, especially in cases of fraudulent registrations.

#### WHOIS Data and Its Challenges

WHOIS data, which is publicly available, can change frequently. Different WHOIS search sites may provide varying levels of detail. Some offer basic information, while others provide enhanced details. There are numerous WHOIS search tools available, and I will highlight those I find most useful. After demonstrating these tools, I will present my own custom online tool that automates many of these processes.

One of the biggest challenges with WHOIS data is privacy controls. Many domain owners use private registration services to protect their personal information. These services replace the owner's details with their own, making it difficult to identify the true registrant. While a court order can usually penetrate this anonymity, we will focus on public resources to help in these situations. Additionally, some web hosts now offer free masking services, further complicating the process. In such cases, historical record queries become crucial.

#### Example: WHOIS Search for cnn.com

For our first example, let's use the domain `cnn.com`. Assume this website is the focus of your investigation, and you want to gather as much information as possible about the site, its owner, and the content provider. For standard WHOIS searches and other options, I prefer using ViewDNS.info.

#### Conclusion

To effectively investigate a domain, start with WHOIS searches and then delve into historical records and cross-referencing. Use tools like ViewDNS, Whoxy, and Whoisology to gather comprehensive information. Remember, while many domains now use privacy protection, historical data can often reveal the true registrant. By combining these methods, you can obtain valuable insights into domain ownership and related entities.
