with the domain. These can be three unique individuals or the same person for all. The contact information 
includes a full name, business name, physical address, telephone number, and email address. These details are 
provided by the registrar of the domain name to the sendee where the name was purchased. This service then 
provides these details to Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). From there, the 
information is publicly available and obtained by hundreds of online resources. While ICANN declares that the 
provided information is accurate, this is rarely enforced. While most businesses supply appropriate contacts, 
many criminals do not. While we must consider searching this publicly available information, often referred to 
as W’hois details, we will also need to dig deeper into domain analysis in order to obtain relevant results. First, 
we will focus on the easy queries.
) are ver}’ simple searches, but are not all equal. While this data is public, it 
could change often. Some WTiois search sites display die bare bones details while others provide enhanced 
information. There are dozens of options from which to choose, and I will explain those that I have found 
useful. After the demonstrations, I present my own custom online tool that automates many processes.
The biggest hurdle with WTiois data is privacy controls. Many domain owners have started using private 
registration sen ices in order to protect their privacy. These services provide their own data within the WTiois 
search results, and only these companies know the true registrant. WTiilc a court order can usually penetrate this 
anonymity, 1 will discuss public resources to help in these situations later. Some web hosts now provide free 
masking sen ices for domain owners, which is making this problem worse. Historical record queries will be vital 
if you sec this happening. Until then, let’s focus on current registration data. For the first example, I will use a 
target domain of cnn.com. Assume that this website is the focus of your investigation and you want to retrieve 
as much information as possible about the site, the owner, and die provider of the content. For the standard 
W hois search, as well as many other options, I prefer ViewDNS.info.

This utility attempts to search the domain in order to locate other domains owned by the same registrant. In our 
example, it located 28 additional domains associated with our target. If the domain possessed private registration, 
this technique would fail.
Next, you should translate the domain name into the IP address of the website. ViewDNS will do this, and 
display additional domains hosted on the same server. This service identified the IP address of cnn.com to be 
151.101.1.67 and stated the web server hosted dozens of additional domains related to this company. These 
included weather.cnn.com and cnnbusiness.com. If the results had included domains from websites all over the 
world without a common theme, it would have indicated that this was a shared server, which is very common.
This online port scanner looks for common ports that may be open. An open port indicates that a senice is 
running on the web server that may allow public connection. A search of cnn.com revealed that ports 21, 80, 
and 443 are open to outside connections. Port 80 is for web pages and port 443 is for secure web pages. These 
are open on practically every website. However, port 21 is interesting. ViewDNS identifies this as a port used 
for F1P sen’ers, as was discussed previously. This indicates that the website hosts an FTP server and connecting 
to fip.cnn.com could reveal interesting information.
The administrative and technical contacts were identical to the registrant shown above. This data identifies the 
company which owns site and associated contact details. We also know it was created in 1993 and the record 
was updated in 2020. This is a great start, if the provided details are accurate. I have found that ViewDNS will 
occasionally block my connection if I am connected to a VPN. An alternative Whois research tool is who.is.

This tool translates a domain name to IP address and identifies previous IP addresses used by that domain. A 
search of cnn.com reveals the following details. The first column is the IP address previously associated with 
the domain, the second column identifies the current user and company associated with that IP address, and the 
last column displays the date these details were collected by ViewDNS.

The utilities hosted at ViewDNS are always my first stop for a couple of reasons. First, the site has been ver}’ 
reliable over the past ten years. More vital, it allows query via static URL. This is beneficial for submission 
directly from our tools. The following displays the URL structure for the previous techniques, with cnn.com 
as the target.

This option presents a complete report on the DNS settings for the target domain. This tool is designed to 
assist webmasters and system administrators diagnose DNS related issues, but we can use it to peek into their 
settings, including DNS and mail server details.
The search option in the upper right allows us to query email addresses, names, and keywords. This can be 
extremely valuable when you do not know which domain names your target has owned. Searching "OSINT" 
reveals a surprising amount of people and companies purchasing domains associated with this topic. Whoxy 
offers many paid services if the free tier is not sufficient. Of die paid services, this one is the most affordable, 
allowing you to purchase small amounts of information without committing to any specific level of subscription.
This is one of the very few premium services which offer a decent free tier. Searching my own domain, which 
currently possesses private registration, reveals valuable results. The general registration data was "protected" 
and confirms what I found on ViewDNS. Scrolling down the page reveals powerful historical records. These 
identify my real name, multiple email addresses used during various registrations, and a date next to each entry 
to tie it all together. Figure 23.01 displays one of the results. This confirms that duringjuly of 2015, my site was 
briefly registered without privacy protection. The "9 Domains" link reveals even more information. Figure 23.02 
displays this result which identifies numerous domains which I had previously created from 2007 through 2018. 
This resource has single-handedly exposed more private domain registrations than any other free sendee during 
my investigations throughout 2019. Furthermore, it allows submission via URL which will benefit our search 
tools, as follows.
As stated previously, many domains now possess private registration. This means that you cannot see the owner 
of a domain publicly. Many hosts are now offering private registration as a free sendee, further complicating 
things for investigators. If you query a domain and see a name entry such as "WhoisGuard Protected", you know 
that the domain is protected. There are two ways to defeat this. The first requires a court order, which is outside 
the scope of this book. The second way to reveal the owner is through historical domain records. If the domain 
has been around a while, there is a very good chance that the domain was not always private. There are several 
free and paid domain history services, and I present my favorites in order of usefulness.

The name, address, and other data can be found on any Whois search website. However, die numbers in 
parentheses identify the number of additional domains that match those criteria. In this example, there are a 
total of 88 domains registered to Brad Carter, and seven domains registered to the email address of 
brad@noda.com. Clicking on any of these pieces of data will launch a new page with all of the matching domain 
information. As an example, clicking on PI:EMAIL will display the 7 domain names associated with his 
email address. Clicking 8144225309 will display the 4 domain names associated with his telephone number. One 
of these is a new domain that is not direcdy associated with him. However, since it was registered with the same 
phone number, there is now a connection.
This sen-ice appeared in 2014 and becomes more powerful even’ month. Like Whoxy, it provides historical 
domain records as a reverse-domain search utility. The home page of Whoisology presents a single search field 
requesting a domain or email address. Entering either of these will display associated websites and die publicly 
available Whois data. This is where the publicly available free features end. Any further details require 
registration. I encourage all readers to create a free account. Once logged in as a free user, you receive much 
more detail within your searches. The first basic feature that you see is the display of standard Whois data which 
will identify the registered administrative contact, registrant contact, technical contact, and billing contact. These 
will often be die same individual for most personal websites. The advanced feature within this content is the 
ability to immediately search for additional domains associated within any field of this data. As an example, a 
search for die domain of phonelosers.org reveals the following data.

their historical domain data, but both require access through their API.

If you navigate directly to https://who.is/whois/phonelosers.org, you can see that the domain possesses 
WhoisGuard protection and the owner's identity is masked. This is displayed in Figure 23.03 (left). However, it 
is possible that the Wayback Machine captured this exact page. The following URL displays any results.
If you ever encounter an investigation surrounding a domain or any business that possesses a website, I highly 
encourage you to conduct research through Whoxy and Whoisology. They also offer access through their API 
at a cost. The individual queries through their website are free. Whoisology restricts free accounts to only one 
historical record and three searches every 24 hours. Because of this, Whoxy receives my overall 
recommendation. I believe Whoisology offers the most data for those looking to purchase a subscription in 
order to query numerous domains, but it can be quite expensive.
Domain Big Data is free and similar to Whoisology and Whoxy. However, it does not offer many options for 
cross-reference search of data fields. It does offer a limited historical view of the Whois registration data as well 
as related domains based on email addresses. A search of the domain notla.com revealed the standard Whois 
data, an associated email address of PI:EMAIL, and two additional domains associated with that email 
address. There were over a dozen historical records of this domain's registration details. Most of them were very 
recent and identified redundant information. However, one historical record was from six months prior and 
identified a previous domain registrar. Searching my own domain confirmed that I possess private registration, 
but public registration from 2013 exposed the following details.
You now know there are many ways to identify the owner of a domain through historical Whois captures. You 
might get lucky through a free preview of previous registration data or be required to purchase access in order 
to see all records dating back decades. We have one last free option which has been successful for me throughout 
several investigations. Wc can query the Wayback Machine for the exact historical URL of a domain registration. 
Let's conduct a demonstration.
This type of cross-reference search has not been found through many other services. Another powerful feature 
of Whoisology is the historical archives. This service constantly scans for updates to domain registrations. When 
new content is located, it documents the change and allows you to search the previous data. As an example, a 
search of computercrimeinfo.com reveals the current administrative contact telephone number to be 
6184628253. However, a look at the historical records reveals that on October 16, 2012, the domain contact 
number was 6184633505. This can be a great way to identify associated telephone numbers that have since been 
removed from the records. Whoisology will also provide details from the search of an email address. In my 
experience, Whoisology will provide a more detailed and accurate response than most other resources. However, 
this comes at a cost. Whoisology continues to minimize the free options in order to maximize sales. Your usage 
may vary by the time you try the free services. A search of the email address PI:EMAIL revealed the 
following domains associated with that account.

This URL defaults to a capture from 2017 which displays the owner's name, address, telephone number, and 
email. This can be seen in Figure 23.03 (middle). Clicking the earliest archive presents a capture of this data from 
2010, as seen in Figure 23.03 (right). We now have accurate historical domain registration data without a 
premium membership, and two additional telephone numbers to investigate. This is not the only domain
