has been eﬀectively introduced as a system to reduce the
risk of collisions among vessels, especially in open sea where
no port authority monitoring is in place. The AIS system,
in fact, allows for automatic response upon detection and
expectation of a collision. This feature is called CPA (closest
point of approach) and works by computing the minimal
distance between two ships in which at least one is in motion.
Using CPA, a ship can be conﬁgured to trigger an alert, both
visually on the captain’s console or acoustically via a siren,
and change course in order to avoid a collision. The threat
consists of spooﬁng a ship navigating on a collision course
with a targeted vessel. This triggers a collision alert in the
CPA system on the victim ship, and could lead the vessel
oﬀ course into a rock or running it aground during low tide.
AIS-SART Spooﬁng [RF].
Apart from collision avoidance, AIS is largely used for
search and rescue operations. Search and rescue transpon-
ders (SARTs) are self-contained, waterproof devices intended
for emergency, mainly to help the detection and location of
vessels and people in distress, i.e. a man overboard. An
AIS-SART activates automatically when in contact with wa-
ter, and sends a distress radio beacon followed by the GPS
position to help aid in locating the survivor. The threat
we identiﬁed consists of generating a false distress beacon
for a man overboard at coordinates chosen by the attacker.
By protocol speciﬁcation, AIS transponders are required to
generate an alert when such a message is received. In this
scenario, the attacker (i.e., a pirate) triggers a SART alert
to lure its victim into navigating to a hostile and attacker-
controlled sea space. Note that by law a vessel is required to
join a rescue operation upon receiving a search and rescue
message.
Weather Forecasting [RF].
One application of AIS is the communication of dynamic
data reﬂecting the changing environment like currents and
climate conditions. A special type of messages, namely bi-
nary, is used to convey such information. This threat con-
sists of announcing false weather forecasts, for example a
sunny day when a squall is expected.
AIS Hijacking [SW/RF].
AIS hijacking consists of altering any information about
existing AIS stations, e.g. about the cargo, speed, location
and ﬂag of country of a real vessel. As another example,
the attacker can maliciously modify the information pro-
vided by aids-to-navigation installed at port by authorities
for vessels assistance and monitoring. In the software variant
of the attack, the attacker eavesdrops (i.e., MiTM) on the
communication and replaces AIS information arbitrarily; in
the radio-frequency version, the attacker overrides the origi-
nal AIS message with a higher powered fake signal. In both
cases, the recipient receives an attacker-modiﬁed version of
the victim’s original AIS message.
Availability Disruption Threats [RF].
We identiﬁed three attacks that go under the same cat-
egory, namely availability disruption. Since these attacks
can be performed only in radio-frequency, we describe their
practical implementation later in detail in Section 6. Here,
we summarize them:
• Slot Starvation: This attack consists of impersonating
the maritime authority to reserve the entire AIS trans-
mission “address space”, in order to prevent all stations
within coverage in communicating; this includes ships
and aids-to-navigation, as well as AIS gateways used
in traﬃc monitoring. As a result, the attacker can
disable AIS systems on a large scale;
• Frequency Hopping:
In a frequency hopping attack,
the attacker impersonates the maritime authority to
instruct one or more AIS transponders to change their
frequencies of operation. By protocol speciﬁcation,
the receiving station is required to maintain the in-
formation, which makes the attack persistent even if
the system is rebooted. In addition, this operation can
be bound to a geographical region, i.e. an attacker can
“program” a targeted ship into switching the frequency
upon reaching a region chosen by the attacker; this
makes AIS useless. Note that for class-B devices, the
AIS standard prevents a manual reset of the transpon-
der, and not notify the user of the frequency change;
• Timing Attack : In this attack, the malicious user in-
structs the AIS transponder(s) to delay its transmis-
sion time – the attacker, by simply renewing the com-
mand, can prevent the transponder(s) from further
communicating its position. This makes a vessel dis-
appear from the AIS-enabled radars, for example. In-
versely, the attacker can overload (i.e., ﬂoods) the ma-
rine traﬃc, including ships and vessel traﬃc services,
by requesting the existing stations into sending AIS
information and updates at a very-high rate.
4. SOFTWARE EVALUATION
In this Section, we discuss the software-based threats that
we identiﬁed. We evaluated three popular online AIS providers,
namely Marine Traﬃc7, AisHUB8 and Vessel Finder9, and
showed that they are aﬀected by the same threats.
When referencing AIS, we have to address AIVDM, the
application layer protocol used by AIS to exchange data sen-
tences, i.e. from vessels’ AIS transponder broadcasting their
position, or from vessel traﬃc services (VTS) monitoring the
ships at port. AIVDM speciﬁes 27 message types; each one
having a corresponding purpose and value that designates
its purpose. The full list is given in [10]. For example,
message type 1 is used in communications between ships
and ship-to-VTS to exchange updated position reports, and
message 24 describes the type of ship, its cargo, dimensions
and name. For our experiments, we implemented an encod-
ing tool written in Python, named AIVDM Encoder, that
we used to generate arbitrary AIVDM sentences and con-

duct both the software and the radio-frequency evaluation
of AIS10.
While AIS installations on ships involve hardware, soft-
ware is used to upstream AIS data to online providers. While
these services are very useful for tracking and navigation,
there are security issues with their implementations. Be-
cause of the loosely implemented nature of AIS receivers,
online providers are often required to accept any data they
receive, since they represent a consortium of users and en-
thusiasts sharing data. This however, introduces several se-
curity issues.
AIS providers allow multiple ways of collecting AIS data
like pre-formatted emails, mobile apps11 and forwarding soft-
ware such as AIS Dispatcher12. When an AIS message is
generated, the forwarding software duplicates and sends the
message to the desired providers – e.g., over UDP/5321 for
Marine Traﬃc. The interval of forwarding these messages
can be established, thus forwarding near real-time statistics
to AIS providers. The same software can be used to up-
stream AIS messages received from an AIS gateway, i.e. a
local VHF receiver one may have in their home. Gateways
are often located along coast lines and present in vessel traf-
ﬁc services operated by port authorities.
Throughout our analysis, we identiﬁed security issues with
all of the aforementioned online providers. These providers,
for example, lack source vetting. They do not check to en-
sure the message originating for a vessel comes from the
same region as the vessel purportedly sending the message.
Likewise, there is no authentication present to ensure the
vessel sending the AIVDM sentence is the proper sender.
As shown in Table 1, the identiﬁed problems allow an at-
tacker to carry out both spooﬁng and MiTM-style attacks
against the aﬀected providers as we discuss in the following.
Spooﬁng consists of crafting valid AIS information re-
motely, e.g. a non-existent ship or aid to navigation, from
nowhere near a body of water or a real AIS station. To
verify this threat we ﬁrst used our AIVDM Encoder to gen-
erate an innocuous AIVDM sentence indicating low tide in a
closed lake nearby. We upload it to the providers by using a
generic networking client like netcat. Note that message 21
is reserved for AtoNs reports and type 13 is used for buoys.
In addition, AtoNs have a MMSI in the form of 99MIDXXXX
as per speciﬁcation. An example is given in the following

Second, we generated a pre-formatted email report for a
moored vessel, i.e. of Listing 2, and sent it to the receiving
address of the targeted provider:

we conducted to show that our concerns are real and aﬀect
all AIS transponders installed on vessels worldwide.
5.1 Architecture
Our AIS transmitter that we called AISTX, is designed
and implemented as a software deﬁned radio (SDR)16.
A SDR consists of a software application, which imple-
ments the signal elaboration chain, and a hardware periph-
eral, which converts binary data to radio-frequency signals
for over-the-air transmission. The growth of personal com-
puters’ computational capabilities and the drop of hardware
acquisition costs have made SDR peripherals available at af-
fordable costs. One example is the universal software radio
peripheral (USRP), being one of the most used SDR periph-
erals. Our AISTX is built on top of GnuRadio17, an open
source framework widely used to design and implement eﬃ-
cient software deﬁned radios. While it has been extensively
used to conduct research in security, for example in evalua-
tion of the ADS-B aviation protocol [7], GSM security [26]
and RFID used in Taipei Metro’s EasyCard [5], we believe
we are the ﬁrst to adopt it for building an AIS transmitter.
Figure 3 shows the general architecture of AISTX. We
generate the AIS frames with a block called AIS Frame
Builder, thoroughly described later in Section 5.2. We then
realize a GMSK modulation of each frame, and over the two
AIS channels. GMSK (Gaussian Minimum Shifting Key-
ing) is a form of digital modulation widely used in mobile
communication, e.g. in GSM and DECT transmission. The
GMSK modulator is conﬁgured with parameters as per AIS
speciﬁcation [11]: A bandwidth-time product (BT) of 0.4, a
bit rate (R) of 9,600 bps, and a samples/symbol as rounded
ratio of sampling and bit rate.
The modulated frames, generated at baseband, are then
transposed to the default operating frequencies that the AIS
speciﬁcation dictates. We ﬁrst modulate the baseband signal
around the frequencies of ± 25 KHz, by multiplying it by two
sinusoids of said frequency. To prevent signal clipping and
linearity distortion in the digital-to-analog converter (DAC)
of the SDR peripheral, the amplitude range of the signal is
reduced from ± 1 to ± 0.9. Finally, we shift the resulting
signal over the carrier frequency of 162 MHz, resulting in
two signals over the AIS standard frequencies of 161.975
MHz and 162.025 MHz. The UHD: USRP Sink block acts
as a driver for the SDR peripheral.
5.2 Building an AIS Frame
Although GnuRadio comes with a wide range of commonly-
used pre-deﬁned blocks – e.g. ﬁlters, signal generators and
converters – for the purposes of our work, we extended the
suite with a custom block, named AIS Frame Builder, which
serves as generator of AIS frames. As Figure 4 shows, our
block implements the full AIS stack, and it is composed
of three main components covering respectively the appli-
cation/presentation layers, the link layer and the physical
layer, as deﬁned in the protocol speciﬁcation for AIS. Our
block works as following. It takes as input a AIS message,
formatted using the AIVDM format. At ﬁrst, it encodes the
message using a 6-bit ASCII alphabet. Only capital letters

scribe later will be made publicly available on the Security
Intelligence Blog of Trend Micro [19] and on the personal

Finally, we implemented an automated script that uses
Google Earth’s KMZ ﬁles to make a spoofed AIS station to
follow a path over time, e.g. a ﬁctional generic ship spelling
the word PWNED in the Mediterranean Sea, as depicted in
Figure 2. Overall, all of the experiments were successful,
and allowed us to spoof and upstream valid AIS messages
to the evaluated providers.
Man-in-the-middle involves the modiﬁcation or injection
of erroneous data in the AIS communication of a station
transmitting valid AIVDM sentences. We ﬁrst physically in-
tercepted valid AIVDM sentences transmitted via air from a
nearby station (i.e. our AIS transponder13), by deploying an
AIS gateway we controlled. We conﬁgured it with AIS Dis-
patcher and an USB dongle AIS receiver14. We then used a
proxy server to intercept, modify and upstream the AIS mes-
sages to the online providers, which accepted any tampered
message unhindered. In a second experiment, we picked an
existing ship being rendered on online providers15 and we
spoofed via software – as described previously – modiﬁed in-
formation for the vessel. We were able to make the providers
rendering the ship in a diﬀerent location from where initially
located.
5. AIS TRANSMITTER
In the previous Section, we described the software-based
threats that we identiﬁed, i.e. how to upstream arbitrary
AIVDM sentences to AIS providers and how to tamper with
existing AIS information sent by real ships to the providers.
In the following, we focus on radio-frequency-based threats.
We describe the system that we designed and implemented
for generating and transmitting arbitrary AIS messages over
the air. Later in Section 6, we present the experiments that

our own AIS transponder for this and the following experi-
ment.

transponder.

chronize the sender and receiver, and permits synchronous,
code-transparent data transmission. This concludes the op-
erations carried out in the link layer module.
Finally, the physical layer prepares the frame for the GMSK
modulation, which takes place following in the AIS transmis-
