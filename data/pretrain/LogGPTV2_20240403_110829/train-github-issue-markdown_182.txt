## Expected Behavior
When navigating on Client side and also when directly enter path on browser
address bar, it should show `Page B` content for path `/a` and `Page A` for
`/b` path.
## Current Behavior
On client side: when navigating by clicking links it shows `Page A` content
for path `/a` and when I refresh page it shows `Page B` content for path `/a`,
same for path `/b`.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. Clone issue repository
  2. `yarn dev`
## Context
Trying to use custom server routing.
## Your Environment
Tech | Version  
---|---  
next | 4.2.3  
node | 8.5.0  
OS | macOS  
browser | Chrome  
## Question
When using custom server routing, this `path-pattern` shouldn't be customized
in some how? So when serving pages when navigating on client side
(`http://localhost:3000/_next/[id]/page/a.js`) it will use same patterns.
Example:
    if (page === '/a') {
      page = '/b';
    } else if (page === '/b') {
      page = '/a';
    }
