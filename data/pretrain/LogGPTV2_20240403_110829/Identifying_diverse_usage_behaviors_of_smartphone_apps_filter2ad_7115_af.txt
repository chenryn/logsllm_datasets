larger or longer, but we expect that a device that allows for better
interaction will have on average more large ﬂows and longer ﬂows.
In Figure 16, we compare the individual trafﬁc volume and in-
dividual access time between device 2 and device 4, and between
device 3 and device 4. For our analysis, we aggregate all the pop-
ular apps to ﬁrst compute directly the individual access time and
individual trafﬁc volume for these three platforms, and then com-
pute the relative differences by comparing device 2 against device
4, and device 3 against device 4. According to Figure 16(a), the
individual access time for device 2 and device 4 are very close, i.e.,
the median relative difference is 0. However, individual trafﬁc vol-
ume for device 2 is much smaller. The median difference of the
individual trafﬁc volume is −30%. Such a big difference indicates
that the user experience is substantially different between these two
device categories; users of device 4 consume much more data, typ-
ically through video. Figure 16(b) shows the comparison between
device 3 and device 4; these two device categories are much closer
than device 2 and device 4. There may be two explanations. First,
a faster device tends to give users better overload experience and
encourages them to download more content from the network. Sec-
ond, power user are more likely upgrade to the latest smartphone,
while users not as active may be more likely to keep using their
older devices.

IMPLICATIONS
In previous sections, we investigate the usage patterns of smart-
phone apps from spatial, temporal, user, and device perspectives.
We believe that our previous observations have important implica-
tions for the smartphone community. In this section, we discuss
these implications following our previous observations.
5.1 Content Providers
In the analysis of spatial patterns of smartphone usages, we ob-
serve a considerable number of local apps (20%) which contribute
2% of the trafﬁc volume in the smartphone apps category. The
content provided by these local apps are very deterministic, e.g.,
news apps, regional radio online services, weather forecast apps,
etc. Given both the customers and locations for these apps are very
closely clustered, content placement and delivery can be further op-
timized accordingly. It is therefore beneﬁcial to place the content
close to GGSNs in the cellular networks [28] for cellular users and
place the content close to the geographic location of WiFi users.
Besides local apps, for national apps, the distribution of geographic
