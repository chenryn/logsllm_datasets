User: I have a medium size (~100mb) read-only database that I want to put on google app engine. I  could put it into the datastore, but the datastore is kind of slow, has no relational features, and has many other frustrating limitations (not going into them here).  Another option is loading all the data into memory, but I quickly hit the quota imposed by google. A final option is to use django-nonrel + djangoappengine, but I'm afraid that package is still in its infancy.
Ideally, I'd like to create a read-only sqlite database that uses a blobstore as its data source. Is this possible?
Assistant: django-nonrel does not magically provide an SQL database - so it's not really a solution to your problem.
Accessing a blobstore blob like a file is possible, but the SQLite module requires a native C extension, which is not enabled on App Engine.
