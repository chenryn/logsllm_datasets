to prevent the attack we present in this paper, it is important
to detect whether it occurred when resolving cases where
a customer disputes a transaction. While assisting fraud
victims who have been refused a refund by their bank, we
have requested the IAD so as to discover whether the card
believes PIN veriﬁcation succeeded, but have almost always
been refused. This paper illustrates that while the IAD can
be considered trustworthy (after its MAC has been veriﬁed),
the TVR and merchant receipt must not.
In fact, dispute resolution processes we have seen in the
UK are seriously ﬂawed, even excluding the protocol failure
described here. In one disputed transaction case we assisted
in, the customer had his card stolen while on holiday, and
then used in an EMV transaction. The issuer refused to
refund this customer on the basis that their records showed
the PIN was used. Luckily, the customer managed to obtain
the merchant receipts, and these contained the TVR. This
indicated that the PIN was not used, and the merchant opted
to fall back to signature. We decoded the TVR and informed
the customer, who was then able to get a refund.
Other customers are less fortunate: it is unusual for the
TVR to be included on the receipt, and often the merchant
receipt has been destroyed by the time the dispute is being
considered. In these cases we have not been able to obtain
the TVR, IAD, or even a statement by the bank as to how
they established that the cardholder was veriﬁed through the
correct PIN being entered.
they fail
Our demonstration therefore exposes a deeper ﬂaw in
EMV and the associated systems:
to produce
adequate evidence for dispute resolution or litigation. Pro-
cedures are also a mess. For example, once a transaction
is disputed a typical bank either destroys the card or asks
the customer to do so, preventing information from being
extracted which might show whether the card was actually
used. Transaction logs are commonly only kept for 120 days,
and by the time the dispute is being heard the bank may
have destroyed most of the records. (This was the case in
the well-known Job v. Halifax trial: even though the Halifax
had been notiﬁed that the transaction was being disputed, the
logs were then destroyed in deﬁance of Visa guidelines [16].)
These general issues are discussed by Murdoch [17], but
the vulnerability described in this paper poses a problem for
such banks. If they have indeed destroyed all record of the
IAD, they will be unable to show that disputed transactions
actually used the correct PIN. So our ﬁndings might help
banks understand that it is in their interest to retain evidence
rather than destroy it.
Another evidential issue is that even if the issuer were able
to establish whether the attack we present here had occurred,
this may not help customers because the typical receipt
still states that the PIN was veriﬁed. Although this may be
false, many people evaluating evidence (adjudicators, judges,
and jury members) will not know this. In one particular
case, from 2009, the issuing bank, and government-approved
adjudicator, explicitly relied upon the “Veriﬁed by PIN”
indicator on the merchant receipt, in concluding that the
transaction was PIN-veriﬁed and therefore the customer was
liable. For this reason we propose that terminals no longer
print “Veriﬁed by PIN” unless the protocol actually supports
this assertion.
VIII. RELATED WORK
EMV has been available for 14 years and is now widely
deployed despite little published research on its security. In
1999, Herreweghen and Wille [18] evaluated the suitability
of EMV for Internet payments and identiﬁed the problem of
not being able to determine if the Verify command was ever
executed because it is not authenticated. In their proposed
Internet-based payment scheme,
the
ARQC should only be generated if the Verify command has
been successful. But their paper did not consider that the
result of PIN veriﬁcation is included in the IAD, nor that
the Verify message could be tampered with by a man-in-the-
middle in a point-of-sale transaction.
they suggested that
More recently, interest in EMV has increased since it
was widely deployed in 2005, but perhaps due to the
speciﬁcation’s complexity and incompleteness, the closed
user community, and difﬁculties in carrying out experiments,
researchers have not done much work on it. Anderson et
al. [19] described how bank customers might have difﬁculty
in obtaining refunds once transactions were authorized by
PIN. That paper also outlined some potential attacks against
Chip and PIN, such as cloning SDA cards for use in ofﬂine
transactions, and the likelihood that criminals would migrate
towards cross-border fraud if and when legacy magnetic
strip transactions were disabled at domestic ATMs. It also
brieﬂy considered the attack line described in this paper, but
did not follow though at the time with detailed analysis or
performing experiments.
Another potential EMV weakness outlined in [19] was the
relay attack, which was reﬁned and demonstrated by Drimer
and Murdoch [20]. Here, the criminal sets up a tampered
441
Chip and PIN terminal, which the victim uses to make a
small transaction (e.g. buying a meal at a restaurant). Rather
than placing the transaction, the terminal relays the session
to a fake card which is being used for a far larger transaction
elsewhere (e.g. buying diamonds at a jewelery shop). The
authors also described a defence against this attack, in which
the terminal and card engage in a cryptographic exchange
which not only establishes authenticity but also a maximum
distance bound, either eliminating or greatly limiting the
applicability of the attack.
Another attack is to tamper a terminal to merely record
card details, and then use them for a fraudulent transaction
later. Drimer et al. [21] demonstrated that current Chip and
PIN payment terminals have inadequate tamper resistance,
and a tapping device can be surreptitiously added to record
the customer’s PIN and enough details to allow a cloned
magnetic strip card to be created. Criminals are now known
to have carried out variants of this attack, so banks are now
taking action: the chip no longer has a copy of the magnetic
strip (one data ﬁeld is replaced), and magnetic strip fallback
transactions are gradually being phased out.
The work presented in this paper is a signiﬁcant advance
in our understanding of attacks against EMV because it is
applicable to online transactions (unlike cloned SDA “yes
cards”); it does not require criminals to synchronise their
fraudulent purchase with that of an unwitting customer (as
the relay attack does); and it does not depend on mag-
netic strip fallback (unlike the payment terminal tampering
attacks). As a consequence, it may be one of the most
realistic and attractive attacks for criminals, if and when
magnetic strip transactions are no longer permitted. It could
even be used at the moment, by criminals who wish to
make purchases in countries which now mandate EMV
transactions at point of sale. It may explain a number of
the transaction dispute cases reported to us.
If this attack becomes more widely used, its net effect
will be that criminals can use stolen cards in shops without
the cardholder being negligent – exactly as was the case
with magnetic strip cards before the introduction of EMV.
However, so long as the public is not aware of this, the banks
will be able to get away with blaming cardholders for fraud.
We have therefore decided on a policy of responsible dis-
closure, of publishing this paper some time after informing
bank regulators in the UK, Europe and North America of
the vulnerability.
At present, we understand that there is a lot of pressure
on the US Federal Reserve from the banks it regulates to
countenance a move from magnetic strip cards to EMV.
This paper shows that such a move may be premature. It’s
not reasonable for the smart card industry to foist a broken
framework on the US banking industry and then leave it
to individual issuer banks to come up with patches. The
EMV consortium should ﬁrst publish its plans for ﬁxing
the framework, presumably with the next version (v 5) of
the EMV speciﬁcation. The Fed should then satisfy itself of
three things.
First, will the ﬁx work technically? For this, only open
peer review will do. Second, will the high level of consumer
protection so far enjoyed by US cardholders be preserved?
Third, will the introduction of the remediated system intro-
duce any systemic risks, because of moral hazard effects?
For these last two questions to be answered in the afﬁrma-
tive, we believe that there must be no associated ‘liability
shift’ as there has been in Europe and Canada.
IX. RESPONSE
The response to our paper has been largely positive, with
most knowledgeable respondents agreeing that the attack
works. However there was substantial discord regarding our
conclusion that “Chip and PIN is broken”, which can mainly
be explained by differences in the way that respondents
deﬁne and measure success. In this section we summarise
and comment only on the discordant responses: the positive
responses speak for themselves.
Respondents who measure success differently have argued
that Chip and PIN is de facto successful because its deploy-
ment has reduced lost and stolen card fraud; others argued
that it is successful because the chip itself still has not been
fully cloned by criminals.
We measure the success of Chip and PIN by its two core
goals: ﬁrst, to prevent counterfeit card fraud using the chip,
and second to prevent lost and stolen card fraud using the
PIN. Because stolen cards can be used without knowing the
PIN, by our deﬁnition, Chip and PIN is broken. We do not
believe that the system is broken beyond repair, but neither is
it the case that a simple ﬁx will sufﬁce, due to the unmanage-
able complexity of EMV. This has been demonstrated by the
spirited disagreement among experts discussing the attack
on our blog [22] and proposing different favoured solutions,
and by the continued absence of a ﬁx at the time of writing,
almost three months since the industry was notiﬁed.
Some of our respondents argued that Chip and PIN was
a success on economic grounds, claiming that it saved more
money from fraud than it cost to deploy. However they did
not present ﬁgures to back up this claim. And counterfactual
history is hard: how would one show that in the absence of
EMV, fraud would have increased even more than it in fact
has? Other respondents agreed that Chip and PIN simply
pushed fraud to other areas such as card-not-present fraud,
undermining the argument of economic success.
Some respondents argued that our attack would be dif-
ﬁcult to deploy, for instance because of the bulk of the
equipment and because of the narrow window of opportunity
between theft of a card and its cancellation once the card-
holder reports it stolen. Some even insisted on characterising
it as theoretical, despite the fact it was deployed against live
terminals at real merchants at three different sites. Whilst our
demonstration equipment was indeed bulky, miniaturization
442
is straightforward and well within the capabilities of crimi-
nals who already miniaturize hi-tech point-of-sale skimmers
and ATM skimmers. Skimmers perform far more complex
actions than blocking a single command from a protocol run.
Those who argued that the window of opportunity for abuse
is small fail to recognise that the very reason the PIN is used
is to prevent abuse of lost/stolen cards, so clearly the threat
must have been substantial enough to justify investment in
PIN technology in the ﬁrst place. A larger window for abuse
can also be achieved by postal interception of replacement
cards, by stealing the victim’s mobile phone at the same time
as a card, or by pickpocketing rather than mugging: there
really is no shortage of opportunity to abuse stolen cards.
Other respondents argued that the problem was not sig-
niﬁcant because systems could be patched to prevent it.
Commenters proposed various cross-checking measures that
might be performed by the issuing banks: checking the
correspondence between CVMR and IAD (we also proposed
this ourselves), or checking terminal capabilities and various
acquirer ﬁelds such as POS data entry mode (deﬁned in
standard ISO 8583) against the IAD. But deﬁnite suggested
ﬁxes are generally remarkable by their absence. Indeed,
some respondents claimed that card schemes were aware
of this attack as far back as 2002; so if any straightforward
cross-checks could ﬁx the problem, surely they would have
been implemented either now, or within the three months
during which our paper circulated privately in the industry.
Others argued that banks might simply move to online PIN
at point-of-sale – in essence to abandon Chip and PIN in
favour of an older approach – or move to CDA, where
proprietary card checks such as the “terminal erroneously
considers PIN OK” ﬂag might help detect the subterfuge.
Unfortunately none of these patches are easy. They require
either a card re-issue, or re-engineering of the POS acquirer
networks in those countries not set up to support online PIN.
Both would be expensive. In particular, CDA has not been
widely adopted because it is very sensitive to cryptographic
errors: because more data are authenticated, it is more likely
that a bug or incompatibility will cause an authentication
failure. Many countries simply do not have the quality of
engineering in their payment networks to be able to use
CDA – a symptom of the excessive complexity of EMV.
A third class of respondents admitted the attack worked,
but argued that because the IAD would be the most trusted
source, and since this would not record PIN use, customers
would never be liable for the losses. Unfortunately, in nearly
all the disputes where we have assisted, banks have been
extremely reluctant to provide any cryptographic evidence
at all. Instead they have relied upon summary records of the
transaction (not on any raw transaction data), or even on the
printed receipts from the merchant, which we have proven
to be untrustworthy.
Finally, some respondents agreed there was a problem
but felt we had misattributed the blame. They argued that
it was not EMV that was at fault, or the card schemes’
speciﬁcations, but the issuing banks. When contacted for
comment, these same issuing banks referred us back to
central bodies such as card schemes or trade associations.
No-one wants to take responsibility. It is true that EMV is
