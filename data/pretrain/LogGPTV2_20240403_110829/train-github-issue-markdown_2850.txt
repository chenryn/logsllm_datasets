This is a small new feature/improvement.  
If you have in parameters.yml a parameter as Array :
    database:
        blog:
            host: blog-host
            name: blog-name
        store:
            host: store-host
            name: store-name
You can retrieve the parameter from a container
    $container->getParameter('database');
However, there is no way to use that parameter from a config.yml definition,
for instance (as an example) this parameter is not usuable to feed a doctrine
connection.
    doctrine:
        dbal:
            connections:
                blog:
                    driver:   %database_driver%
                    host:     %database[blog][host]% #Doesn't work
                    port:     %database_port%
                    dbname:   %database[blog][name]% #Doesn't work
                store:
                    driver:   %database_driver%
                    host:     %database[store][host]% #Doesn't work
                    port:     %database_port%
                    dbname:   %database[store][name]% #Doesn't work
