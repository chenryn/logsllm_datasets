### Configuring DNS Settings

#### General and Networking Tabs
1. On the **General** tab (for a local area connection) or the **Networking** tab (for any other connection), click **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)** or **Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)**, and then click **Properties**.

2. Click **Advanced**, and then click the **DNS** tab.

3. Perform one or more of the following actions:
   - To use DNS dynamic update to register the IP addresses for this connection and the full computer name, select the **Register this connection's addresses in DNS** check box. This check box is selected by default.
   - To configure a DNS suffix for the specific connection, type the DNS suffix in the **DNS suffix for this connection** field.
   - To use DNS dynamic update to register the IP addresses and the domain name specific to this connection, select the **Use this connection's DNS suffix in DNS registration** check box. This check box is not selected by default.

#### Enabling DNS Dynamic Update on a DNS Server
To enable DNS dynamic update on a DNS server running Windows Server 2008 or Windows Server 2003, follow these steps:
1. In the console tree of the DNS snap-in, click the appropriate zone in the **Forward Lookup Zones** or **Reverse Lookup Zones** node.
2. On the **Action** menu, click **Properties**.
3. On the **General** tab, verify that the zone type is either **Primary** or **Active Directory-integrated**.
4. If the zone type is **Primary**, in the **Dynamic Updates** list, select either **Nonsecure and secure** or **Secure only**.

#### Configuring DNS Dynamic Update for a DHCP Server
To configure DNS dynamic update for a DHCP server running Windows Server 2008 or Windows Server 2003, follow these steps:
1. In the console tree of the DHCP snap-in, click the appropriate DHCP server or a scope on the appropriate DHCP server.
2. Right-click the **IPv4** node, the server, or the scope, and then click **Properties**.
3. Click the **DNS** tab.
4. Do one of the following:
   - To enable DNS dynamic update for DHCP clients that support it, select the **Enable DNS dynamic updates according to the settings below** check box and either the **Dynamically update DNS A and PTR only if requested by the DNS clients** check box (selected by default) or the **Always dynamically update DNS A and PTR records** check box.
   - To enable DNS dynamic update for DHCP clients that do not support it, select the **Dynamically update DNS A and PTR records for DHCP clients that do not request updates** check box. This check box is cleared by default.

### Secure Dynamic Update
- **Secure DNS dynamic update** is available only for zones that are integrated into Active Directory. After integrating a zone, you can add or remove users or groups from the ACL for a specified zone or resource record using the DNS snap-in.
- Once a zone is integrated with Active Directory, DNS servers running Windows Server 2008 or Windows Server 2003 allow only secure dynamic updates by default. For standard zone storage, the DNS Server service blocks dynamic updates on its zones by default. You can change the zone to allow both secure and unsecured dynamic updates.
- DNS clients attempt to use unsecured dynamic update first. If an unsecured update is refused, they try to use secure dynamic update.

### DNS and WINS Integration
- If DNS and Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) are integrated, the DNS Server service can look up DNS names in WINS if it cannot resolve the names by querying DNS servers.
- Two specific resource record types can be enabled for any zone to integrate WINS lookup:
  - **WINS resource record**: Enables WINS lookup into forward lookup zones. It is specific to DNS servers running Windows and can be attached only to the root domain of a forward lookup zone.
  - **WINS-R resource record**: Enables IPv4 address-to-NetBIOS name lookups for reverse lookup zones. It is also specific to DNS servers running Windows and can be attached only to the root domain of a reverse lookup zone.

### How WINS Lookup Works
When a DNS client sends a recursive or iterative query to a DNS server that is authoritative for the domain portion of an FQDN, the DNS server performs the following steps:
1. The DNS server separates the host part of the FQDN contained in the DNS query and converts the host part to a 16-byte NetBIOS name.
2. The DNS server sends a NetBIOS Name Query Request message to the WINS server.
3. If the WINS server can resolve the constructed NetBIOS name, it returns the IPv4 address to the DNS server using a NetBIOS Name Query Response message.
4. The DNS server constructs an A resource record using the IPv4 address resolved through the WINS server and sends a DNS Name Query Response message containing the A record to the requesting DNS resolver.

### Using the Nslookup Tool
The Nslookup diagnostic tool allows you to interact with a DNS server using either individual command-line queries or interactively as a name resolver or another DNS server. It is the primary troubleshooting tool for DNS.

#### Nslookup Modes
Nslookup has two modes: interactive and non-interactive.
- **Interactive mode**: Use for multiple resource record queries. To interrupt commands, press `CTRL+C`. To exit, use the `exit` command.
- **Non-interactive mode**: Use for single resource record queries.

#### Nslookup Syntax
```sh
nslookup [-Options] [ComputerToFind | - [Server]]
```
- **-Options**: Specifies one or more Nslookup commands as a command-line option.
- **ComputerToFind**: Look up information for `ComputerToFind` using the current default server or the specified `Server`.
- **Server**: Use this server as the DNS name server. If omitted, Nslookup uses the currently configured default DNS server.

### Examples of Nslookup Usage
1. **Interactive Mode**:
   ```sh
   C:\USERS\DEFAULT>nslookup
   Default Server:  dnssrv1
   Address:  157.54.9.193
   >
   ```
2. **Forward Query**:
   ```sh
   C:\USERS\DEFAULT>nslookup filesrv17
   server =   dnssrv1
   Address:  157.54.9.193
   Name:    filesrv17.example.com
   Address:  131.107.21.19
   ```
3. **Forward Query Using Another DNS Server**:
   ```sh
   C:\USERS\DEFAULT>nslookup msgsrv3 â€“dnssrv9
   server =   dnssrv9
   Address:  157.60.10.41
   Name:    msgsrv3.central.example.com
   Address:  157.60.10.201
   ```
4. **Debug Information**:

### Chapter Summary
- **DNS Client Configuration**: Can be done manually using Network Connections or automatically using DHCP, PPP, or Computer Configuration Group Policy.
- **Name Resolution**: The DNS Client service uses primary or connection-specific DNS suffixes (with name devolution on the primary suffix) or a configured list of DNS suffixes.
- **DNS Server Installation**: Can be installed using the Server Manager snap-in, Add or Remove Programs, Dcpromo.exe, or the Manage Your Server Wizard.
- **Active Directory and DNS**: Active Directory requires DNS to locate domain resources. Storing DNS zones in Active Directory can take advantage of multi-master administration, security, and replication.
- **DNS Server Administration**: Requires configuring server properties, forward and reverse lookup zones, delegation, and zone transfers.
- **Resource Records**: Typical records to manually add are A, AAAA, and PTR.
- **IPv6 Support**: To enable DNS traffic over IPv6, configure the DNS server to listen for DNS traffic over IPv6 and configure clients with the unicast IPv6 addresses of the DNS servers.
- **DNS Dynamic Update**: Allows DNS clients to dynamically update their A, AAAA, and PTR records with the primary name server for the zone. Secure dynamic update is available for zones integrated with Active Directory.
- **WINS Lookup**: Allows a DNS server to use WINS for name resolution when no A record for the host is found. WINS reverse lookup uses NetBIOS Adapter Status messages to perform reverse lookups when no PTR record is found.

- **DNS (Domain Name System)**: A hierarchical, distributed database that contains mappings of DNS domain names to various types of data, such as IP addresses.
- **DNS Dynamic Update**: A DNS standard that permits DNS clients to dynamically register and update their resource records in the zones of the primary name server.
- **DNS Server**: A server that maintains a database of mappings of DNS domain names to various types of data, such as IP addresses.
- **Domain**: Any tree or subtree within the DNS namespace.
