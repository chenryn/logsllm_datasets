User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Windows module installer delaying login, server 2008 R2 We updated our servers this weekend (windows updates), everything went fine except one of our terminal servers now hangs at login with the message, "waiting for windows modules installer." It eventually times out and leaves an event log message that the service has stopped unexpectedly. I have disabled the service and users can now login in a reasonable time frame. However we will need to re-enable the service in order to install further updates. I'm not sure where to start with this one, I'm an entry level admin and my colleagues are on vacation today, thank God this isn't a serious problem. 

Further details:

-It affects all users.
-The only third party software on the server is our ERP software and screwdrivers from Tricerat. 
-The only event log message is that the service has stopped unexpectedly.
-The server manager screen does not display any information about roles it just says, "error".
-The remote desktop roles all seem to be functioning properly, Remote app works as well as standard RDP. 

Let me know if there is any further details I can provide, I will be checking this frequently throughout the day.

Assistant: Be patient, give the server time to do what is needed, mine took nearly 30 minutes after going a disk cleanup on the C Drive. I would certainly let it go 30-45 minutes, a hard reboot when the server is deep in thought is not a good thing.
