User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Apache logs accesses on an already rotated log file I usually create my access and error logs in a domain-name folder under /var/log, and these files are rotated with logrotate using this conf : 

/var/log/mydomain.org/access.log
{
  weekly
  missingok
  rotate 52
  compress
  delaycompress
  notifempty
  create 640 root adm
  sharedscripts
  prerotate
      /usr/local/awstats/wwwroot/cgi-bin/awstats.pl -update -config=mydomain.org &amp;&gt; /dev/null
  endscript
  postrotate
      if [ -f /var/run/apache2.pid ]; then
          /etc/init.d/apache2 restart &gt; /dev/null
      fi
  endscript
}


I have regularly this problem : my access.log is rotated to access.log.1, but apache2 keeps on logging access on access.log.1.

I can't figure out why this is happening. Any help ?

Thanks in advance.

Assistant: I'm going to guess that you're apache process is not putting a pid file in "/var/run/apache2.pid" and therefore your postrotate never executes.
While troubleshooting (as faker's comment suggests) maybe try this:


   ...
   postrotate
          /etc/init.d/apache2 restart > /tmp/apache_restart.txt
    endscript
    }


Then tomorrow look at /tmp/apache_restart.txt with more /tmp/apache_restart.txt
