## Abstract
This paper presents a real-time demonstration of a full-duplex point-to-point link, where transmission and reception occur simultaneously in the same spectrum band. We first build a full-duplex radio by implementing self-interference cancellation techniques on top of a traditional half-duplex radio architecture. Using a pair of these radios, we establish a point-to-point link capable of transmitting and receiving OFDM packets. By varying the environmental conditions around the full-duplex radios, we demonstrate the robustness of the self-interference cancellation in adapting to changing environments.

## 1. Introduction
Full-duplex radios offer significant advantages over their half-duplex counterparts. Several works on full-duplex radios [5, 3, 7, 6, 4, 8] have proposed various hardware and algorithmic techniques to achieve different levels of self-interference cancellation required for full-duplex operation. However, these works have not fully addressed the skepticism in both academia and industry regarding the feasibility and adaptability of these techniques to dynamic environmental conditions. This demonstration has two main objectives: first, to implement a working full-duplex radio using the architecture proposed in [5], and second, to build a full-duplex radio link that can adapt to changing environmental conditions.

In [5], it was shown that to achieve full-duplex communication with the regulatory power limits of existing half-duplex WiFi radios, 110 dB of self-interference cancellation is required. This level of cancellation was achieved in two stages: analog and digital cancellation filters. After applying these cancellations, the residual self-interference signal falls below the noise floor, allowing the receiver to detect weak incoming signals. We demonstrate this level of self-interference cancellation using WARP software radios and a host PC.

Using two such full-duplex radios, we establish a full-duplex point-to-point link, where each radio transmits and receives data from the other via the established link. To maintain a stable full-duplex link, it is essential to achieve cancellation that quickly adapts to changing environments. This paper demonstrates a dynamically adaptive cancellation system that maintains a robust full-duplex link even when environmental conditions change frequently. The rest of the paper describes the implementation of the cancellation techniques and the full-duplex point-to-point link.

## 2. Adaptive Cancellation
To enable full-duplex communication, we need to cancel the major components of the self-interference signal. In Figure 1a, T represents the signal fed to the antenna for transmission. Part of this signal is reflected back from the environment and the antenna itself, and part leaks directly to the receive path through spurious paths in the circulators. These reflected and leaked signals, denoted as aT, are typically 15 dB smaller than the original signal T, requiring 95 dB of self-interference cancellation.

The transmitted signal T consists of three parts: a linear form of the transmitted digital data, non-linear distortion of the transmitted digital data, and transmitter noise. Since the transmitter noise cannot be modeled digitally, it is canceled in the analog domain. As described in [5], 70 dB of analog cancellation is needed to eliminate the self-interference due to transmitter noise.

Analog cancellation also addresses reflections from the near-field region and impedance mismatches. After analog cancellation, the residual signal iT remains, consisting of contributions from linear and non-linear distortions in the transmit chain and reflections from the far-field region. This residual component is adaptively modeled using the WiFi preamble to train the digital taps, which then eliminate the residual signal.

In typical radio operation, the near-field environment is relatively stable, while the far-field region can experience rapid changes, mainly due to the movement of people. Therefore, the taps used in analog cancellation remain fairly constant, and slower adaptation is sufficient. The taps for digital cancellation, however, need to be adjusted more frequently to adapt to the changing far-field conditions.

To demonstrate a dynamic and robust full-duplex radio, we built the analog and digital cancellation circuits using WARP radios [2], as shown in Figure 1b. A video of this demonstration is available in [1]. Even when the environment around the full-duplex radio is not changing, the taps of the digital cancellation filters frequently adjust to adapt to the changing far-field conditions. The taps for analog cancellation remain relatively fixed, as the near-field region and reflections due to impedance mismatch do not vary much over time. To demonstrate the adaptability of analog cancellation, we introduce a metallic reflector close to the antenna, causing strong self-interference in the near-field region. Adjusting the analog taps compensates for this interference. When the reflector is moved away, the taps return to their previous values.

## 3. Point-to-Point Full-Duplex Link
In this section, we demonstrate the application of full-duplex radios by creating a full-duplex point-to-point communication link. The setup consists of two full-duplex radios communicating simultaneously on the same spectrum band. We use a standard 802.11n PHY-based WiFi modem for this demonstration. Figure 1c shows the user interface of the demo, including various signals and evaluation metrics for one of the radios.

To compare the performance of the full-duplex link to that of a half-duplex link, we alternate the operation between full-duplex and half-duplex modes for every alternate packet and show the results together. The first column in Figure 1c shows the self-interference signals at different stages of cancellation and the weak received signal after self-interference cancellation. In full-duplex mode, after self-interference cancellation, the received signal (black) should closely resemble the signal received in half-duplex mode (green). The similarity of these two signals in the attached video indicates that the full-duplex link is operational.

The quality of the link can be visually evaluated by plotting the constellation of the received signal after demodulation. The second column of Figure 1c shows the constellation at various stages of the full-duplex link and the half-duplex link. The top plot shows the constellation after only analog cancellation, where the constellation appears as a single blob instead of the 16 constellation points used for this demo. The middle plot shows the constellation after both analog and digital cancellations, with the constellation points tightly grouped around the true points, indicating high link quality. The bottom plot shows the constellation for the half-duplex link, which closely resembles the full-duplex constellation points, confirming the operational status of the full-duplex link.

A more quantitative metric to gauge link quality is the Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) of the constellation after demodulation. EVM measures the deviation of the constellation points in the received signals from the true constellation points. A lower EVM indicates higher link quality. The third column of the user interface in Figure 1c plots the EVM of the links. The full-duplex link shows a slight degradation compared to the half-duplex link, with about a 2% difference in EVM. As reported in [5], the noise floor after self-interference cancellation is roughly 1 dB higher than that of a half-duplex radio, accounting for the EVM difference. The top plot shows the EVM for each subcarrier, and the middle plot shows the EVM of each packet for the last 100 packets. Occasional increases in EVM for the full-duplex link are due to the sudden introduction of a reflector close to the radio. The analog cancellation taps take some time to adapt to this new change, causing a temporary increase in EVM. Once the taps have adapted, the link quality improves. This momentary degradation is an artifact of the current implementation and can be improved with faster hardware support. Finally, the bottom plot shows the near doubling of throughput via the full-duplex link compared to its half-duplex counterpart.
