Here δ is the probability that the BS accepts a message
forgery by A, |s| is the length of the vector indicating
the number of the helper’s ON slots, and pI is the prob-
ability of inferring the helper’s activity during one MC
ON-OFF bit when D and H do not co-transmit. Here, δ
is a negligible function of |s|. In eq. (4), it is assumed
that a strongly universal hash function is used as part of
the HELP primitive.
Proof. Assume that the adversary A wants to modify
the message mD sent from D to the BS to a message
D (cid:54)= mD. To accept m(cid:48)
m(cid:48)

slots. The modiﬁcation of mD to m(cid:48)
D can be made by
canceling mD and injecting m(cid:48)
D. However, to pass veriﬁ-
cation, A has to modify [h(mD)] to [h(m(cid:48)
D)]. Since, mD is
unknown to the adversary while [h(mD)] is being trans-
mitted due to the one-wayness of h(·), A cannot predict
the signal transmitted from D.
To modify [h(mD)], the adversary must launch a sig-
nal cancellation on [h(mD)] + mH and inject [h(m(cid:48)
D)] at
the same time. Moreover, all the ON slots denoted in
the helper’s location vector s must remain as ON slots in
[h(m(cid:48)
D)] after mH is
removed. This can be achieved if A does not apply any
cancellation on the ON slots indicated in s and modiﬁes
the rest of the slots (OFF slots in mH) to decode to the
desired message. The signal injections of A are made
according to Table 1.
D)]. Also, the BS must decode [h(m(cid:48)
The derivation of the probability δ that the adversary’s
modiﬁcation is accepted at the BS is performed in two
parts.
In the ﬁrst part, we derive the probability that
A’s cancellation/injection is detected, when A modiﬁes
the transmission one bit. We then compute the prob-
ability of detecting signal modiﬁcations by A over all
bits. Consider the ith bit of h(m(cid:48)
D) which corresponds
to Manchester-coded slots t2i−1 and t2i.
Here, we assume a probability pI, which is the prob-
ability of inference of detecting the presence of H’s sig-
nal. This is discussed in details in the Section 6. Here
we state an assumption, that if H’s signal is detected the
adversary does not cancel the signal. The probability of
cancel is (1− pI).
The adversary is detected for ith bit on which H is ac-
tive, for two conditions with wrong inference (1 − pI).
(a) First, the helper bit is zero i.e. H injects energy on t2i
slot, device bit is one slot and adversary bit is one. (b)
Second, the helper bit is one i.e. H injects energy on the
t2i−1 slot, device bit is zero and the adversary bit is zero.
Let Pr denote the probability that the BS rejects the
corresponding bit of [h(m(cid:48)
D)] at bit bi due to cases (a)
and (b). This probability can be calculated as:
pr = (Pr[bH
+Pr[bH

i = 0])

In (5), bX
i denotes the transmitted value of device X at
bit bi, and pI is the probability of inference of helper’s
activity by the A on a given bit. For (5), we have used
the fact that a strictly universal hash function is the part
of HELP. For a strictly universal hash function, output
hashes for two different inputs differ on each bit with
probability 1/2.
The probability δ of accepting the modiﬁed message
of A at the BS is computed by taking into account all |s|
cardinality of the set of bits on which the helper was ac-
tive. The adversary’s modiﬁed message is accepted by
the BS if none of the bits in |s| is rejected. Each bit bi
is rejected with probability pr given by (5). As rejection
on each slot occurs independently, the overall probabil-
ity of accepting [h(m(cid:48)
D)] is computed via the Binomial
distribution with parameter pr. That is,

This proves that (1 − pr)|s(cid:48)| is a negligible function for
a (cid:54)= 1 or equivalently pr (cid:54)= 0.
After the attacker extracts mD, the rogue BS needs
to pass the challenge-response authentication in the
key conﬁrmation phase.
Assuming the use of a
strongly universal hash function to compute the response
hkD,BS(cid:48) (IDBS||CD||0), he can only pass this authentication
if he has the correct key kD,BS(cid:48). Otherwise, his successful
probability ε is negligible. But he can only obtain the
correct key by extracting the correct mD value. There-
fore, the success probability of the rogue BS to pair with
the device is upper bounded by δ +ε, where ε is a negli-
gible function (of the length of the hash function). Since
δ is a negligible function of |s(cid:48)| which can be the same
as the message length (and here the mD is a DH public
number, whose bit length is typically larger or equal to
the hash length), the overall probability is a negligible
function. This concludes the proof.

Proof. Assume that the adversary A wants to decode the
mD which contains the key public parameter zD from
[h(mD),mD] + mH without the knowledge of set s.
I < 1.
For [h(mD),mD] a bit zero corresponds to (OFF, ON)
whereas a bit one corresponds to (ON, OFF). With su-
perimposing H’s signal, the BS will also receive slots
combinations of (ON, ON). The adversary can extract
some information of mD from the (OFF, ON) and (ON,
OFF) slots in the [h(mD),mD] + mH. But to extract the
information from (ON, ON) slots without the knowledge
of s. The adversary has to make intelligent guesses for
received (ON, ON) slots, which is parameterized as the
probability of inferring the helper’s activity by A.
I be the inference probability for detecting the
presence of H’s signal. This is discussed in details in
Section 6. Note that, if H’s signal is wrongly inferred
(with probability (1 − p(cid:48)
I)), A maps the received bit on
which H was active to a wrong outcome.
The adversary makes wrong mapping when it receives
(ON, ON) slots on received [h(mD),mD] + mH. It hap-
pens when A cannot detect the presence of the helper’s
signal on the slot where D has injected no energy.

Each bit is wrongly mapped with probability pr, given
by (8). As rejection on each slot occurs independently,
