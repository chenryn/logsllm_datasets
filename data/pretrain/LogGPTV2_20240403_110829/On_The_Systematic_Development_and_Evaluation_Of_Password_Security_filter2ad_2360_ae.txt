A.3 Technologies to Protect User Credentials
In order to mitigate the attacks described in the previous section,
multiple technologies are available to users. For each introduced
technology, rst a general description is provided. Then, advantages
and disadvantages of the technology are listed. Last but not least,
where available, additional hints are provided to the participant.
A.3.1 Technology: Fingerprint Readers.
Description of the Technology. Fingerprint readers can be used to
replace regular passwords with a biometric feature.
Advantages and disadvantages of the technology. On the one hand,
using ngerprint readers is faster than entering passwords and also
prevents shoulder surng. On the other hand, photos or ngerprints
taken from touched surfaces might be used to copy ngerprints.
Further, changing ones ngerprints is not possible, if they are com-
promised.
Hints for using ngerprint readers. Fingerprint readers are read-
ily available in a large variety of new consumer products. Some
implementations can be used to replace large sets of dierent types
of passwords (e.g. when the ngerprint is used to unlock a pass-
word manager or system keychain). Other biometric sensors in
consumer products, such as face detection, might not be as mature
and therefore not as secure.
A.3.2 Technology: Graphical Passwords.
Description of the Technology. Graphical passwords are used to
replace text passwords or PINs and consist of graphical informa-
tion. Examples include the Android pattern lock or the graphical
password of the Windows operating system. Graphical passwords
do not change the security level when compared to text passwords.
Advantages and disadvantages of the technology. Graphical pass-
words can be easier remembered by humans, however entry may

Peter Mayer, Christian Schwartz, and Melanie Volkamer
take longer allowing attackers more time to observe the entry. Fur-
thermore, graphical passwords are incompatible with password
managers.
Hints for using graphical passwords. If services allow for the use
of graphical passwords, they usually can be used in conjunction
with traditional text passwords. Similarly to text passwords, it is
also possible to choose weak graphical passwords. Examples include
symmetric patterns or clickable locations which are faces of persons,
red items or corners and centres of items.
A.3.3 Technology: Hardware Tokens.
Description of the Technology. Hardware tokens can replace text
passwords as authentication mechanisms. Examples for hardware
tokens include USB devices, smartwatches and special chip cards.
Advantages and disadvantages of the technology. Hardware to-
kens prevent shoulder surng and increase the diculty of guessing
attacks. However, if the token is stolen, the thief can authenticate
using the token.
Hints for using hardware tokens. In the business context, the
integration of hardware tokens should be coordinated with the IT
department. Many hardware tokens can also be used as part of two
factor authentication.
A.3.4 Technology: Password Manager.
Description of the Technology. Password managers support users
in creating and storing secure passwords. They are available for
many mobile and desktop platforms, some allow the synchroni-
sation between dierent devices. Many security professionals use
password managers, as they are an eective tool to prevent many
of the attacks explained earlier.
Advantages and disadvantages of the technology. Password man-
agers create secure, long passwords defending against guessing at-
tacks. The use of browser plugins which allow auto-ll of passwords
on websites for which passwords were previously stored, prevent
phishing and shoulder surng attacks. In most cases the secure
usage of a password manager requires a strong master-password.
If the master-password is lost, access to the stored passwords may
become impossible.
Hints for using password managers. Selection of a password man-
ager should consider the users requirements, for example if a browser
plugin is required. Users should select a password manager which
can also generate secure passwords. Secure master passwords should
be selected, for example by concatenating multiple words. Weak
legacy passwords (i.e. not generated using the password manager)
should be replaced with stronger passwords when added to the
password manager. New passwords for services should be created
using the password managers password generator functionality.
A.3.5 Technology: Privacy filters.
Description of the Technology. Privacy lters can be used to pre-
vent shoulder surng by restricting the viewable angle of screens.
This reduces the risk posed by observers behind or next to the user,
for example while travelling via train.
Advantages and disadvantages of the technology. Privacy lters
reduce the risk of shoulder surng, however they may reduce the
brightness of screens and the sensitivity of touch input.
Hints for using privacy lters. Depending on the user’s device,
dierent types of privacy lter may be required. In enterprise envi-
ronments the use of privacy lters should be coordinated with the
IT department.
A.3.6 Technology: Single-Sign-On.
Description of the Technology. Single-sign-on technologies allow
users to authenticate to one service, which in turn conrms the
identity and authenticity of the user to other services. This tech-
nology is common in enterprise environments but also available in
private settings. If single-sign-on is used, the selection of a strong
password for the identity provider is especially important.
Advantages and disadvantages of the technology. Single-sign-on
solutions reduce the number of passwords and authentications
required. Furthermore, single-sign on allows sharing of data associ-
ated to user accounts between the single-sign-on service and other
services (and it thus does not have to be entered on each service
individually, saving time during registration). As the other services
require no password, guessing attacks and password attacks are not
possible. However, the single-sign-on service is able to store infor-
mation about services used by the user which might incur privacy
issues. Additionally, the single-sign-on service represents a remote
single point of failure. If the single-sign-on service experiences an
outage, no authentication to the associated services is possible. If
it is compromised, all accounts connected to the single-sign-on
service are compromised as well.
Hints for using single-sign-on. The user is provided with an exam-
ple of setting up a single-sign-on authentication using as example
a popular webservice.
A.3.7 Technology: Two-factor authentication.
Description of the Technology. Two-factor authentication requires
authentication using dierent factors, such as something you know,
something you are or something you have.
Advantages and disadvantages of the technology. Two-factor au-
thentication ensures that an attacker cannot access an account
even if the users password is compromised, increasing the security
level signicantly. Two-factor authentication is recommended as
an easy way to increase the security of important accounts such
as the primary email address to which password reset emails are
delivered. However, if two-factor authentication is used, all factors
are required in order to authenticate. If the second factor is lost,
restoring access requires more eort than a traditional password
reset.
Hints for using two-factor authentication. Today, many services
allow users to enable two-factor authentication. If dierent types
of factors are available, the use of SMS authentication should be
avoided [13].

Systematic Creation Of Awareness-Raising Materials On Password Security
ACSAC ’18, December 3–7, 2018, San Juan, PR, USA
Table 2: APPENDIX B: This table lists all scenarios used in the study. Since we conducted our study in Germany, the scenarios
were originally developed and used in German and translated for this publication. For each attack there are two scenarios, one
representing secure behaviour and one representing insecure behaviour.

Scenario
#
1 Mr. Schmidt works together with his colleague Müller on the same project. Mr. Schmidt is the vacation substitution
for his colleague. He receives an email in which his colleague asks him to send the project plan to his private email
address, because he wants to work on it in his rainy vacation. Mr. Schmidt does not send the information to the
private email address.
2 Mr. Schmidt’s boss is on a business trip to visit a client. Mr. Schmidt receives an email in which his boss informs him
that a person from the help desk of the client will contact Mr. Schmidt to get access to the web-interface of the project
management software. Shortly after, Mr. Schmidt’s phone rings: it is the person from the help desk. Since he received
the announcement of the call from the email-address of his boss, Mr. Schmidt gives the person from the help desk the
required password.
e 3 Mr. Schmidt nds it dicult to remember his passwords. Therefore, he keeps a note of his private passwords at home
in a locked drawer of his desk, which only he can open.
e 4 Mr. Schmidt has to change the password for one system in the company every 90 days. He already had to call the
help desk of his company multiple times to have them reset a pass-word he could not remember after a mandatory
change. When changing the password for the next time, he makes a note of it and stores the note under his mousepad
on his desk.

5 Mr. Schmidt sits in the train on his way to a client. The train is fully booked, the seat next to him taken. Mr. Schmidt
checks emails using his smartphone. Due to an urgent request from his boss, he has to access the web-interface of the
project management software used in this company to list a cost report. He notices that the person in the seat next to
him tries to look at the screen of his smartphone inconspicuously. Therefore, he leaves his seat and moves to an area
in the train where he is undisturbed, so that no one can spy on the sensitive data he is accessing.
6 Mr. Schmidt is sitting in a café and waits on his colleague to have lunch together. Since his colleague sent him a text
message saying that he will be 30 minutes late, Mr. Schmidt wants to use the time to work on his laptop. While he is
working a couple approaches and asks whether they can join him at the table. Since all other tables in the café are
fully occupied, Mr. Schmidt agrees. One of them sits down on the opposing side of the table, one sits down next to Mr.
Schmidt who continues his work and logs in multiple times to the web-interface of the project management software
of his company.
e 7 Mr. Schmidt sits in his oce. He is printing presentation slides for a meeting. The printer is located at the other end
of the corridor. Before Mr. Schmidt leaves his desk to fetch the print-out, he locks his laptop.
e 8 Mr. Schmidt has to share a le with this colleague Mr. Müller. The le is too large to attach it to an email. Since he has
no USB stick at hand, he uses the one he found last week in the parking lot of his company.

e 9 Mr. Schmidt is on his way to a client. Unfortunately, the train is delayed. Therefore, he sits down in a café at the train
station. There he uses an open wi. He uses his laptop as usual, but pays attention that he visits all websites using an
encrypted connection.
e 10 Mr. Schmidt is on a business trip visiting a client in a dierent city. There he stays in a hotel and uses its charged
premium unencrypted wi to work in his room. To login to the wi, he has to enter a user name and a password.
e 11 Mr. Schmidt has to access the web-interface of a client’s system. He receives a warning that no encrypted connection
is possible although this has worked in the past. Therefore, Mr. Schmidt calls the client using a phone number known
to him, describing the problem. He does not access the web-interface until the problem is solved.

12 Mr. Schmidt is at a client in a dierent city to prepare a new project. He has to stay several nights and books a room
in a hotel. Once he is in his room, he tries to access the web-interface of the project management software of his
company. He receives a warning stating there is problem with the security of the connection, although the connection
is encrypted. The problem does not occur with the web-interface of his email account. He infers that the web-interface
of the project management software is miscongured and enters his credentials.
