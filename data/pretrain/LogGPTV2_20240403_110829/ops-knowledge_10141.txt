User: Is there anyway of forcing the GAE dev server to keep full text search indexes after restart? I am finding that the index is lost whenever the dev server is restarted.
I am already using a static datastore path when I launch the dev server (the --datastore_path option).
Assistant: Look like this is not an issue anymore. according to documentation (and my tests):

"The development web server simulates the App Engine datastore using a
  file on your computer. This file persists between invocations of the
  web server, so data you store will still be available the next time
  you run the web server."

Please let me know if it is otherwise and I will follow up on that.
