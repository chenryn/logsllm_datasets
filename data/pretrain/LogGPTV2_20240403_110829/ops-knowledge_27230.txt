User:  How to merge code between different branches when using GitLab for code management?
Assistant: Merging code in GitLab can be achieved through the following steps: 1. Create a new branch: In GitLab, create a new branch from the source branch (usually the master branch). 2. Pull the source branch code: use the Git client on the local computer, and use the git pull command to get the latest code from the source branch. 3. Switch to the new branch: Use the git checkout command to switch to the new branch. 4. Merge the source branch code into the new branch: Use the git merge command to merge the code in the source branch into the new branch. 5. Resolve conflicts: If a code conflict occurs during the merge process, you need to manually resolve the conflict and submit the code. 6. Submit code: Submit the merged code to GitLab. 7. Create a merge request: Create a merge request in GitLab to merge the code in the new branch into the source branch. In merge requests, code diffs can be viewed and code reviews performed. 8. Review Merge Requests: Other developers can review merge requests and suggest changes, which ensures the quality of the merged code. 9. Merge code: After review, the administrator can approve the merge request and merge the code into the source branch.
