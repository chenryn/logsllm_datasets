User: I need your help. I'm a newbie and I'm learning python. I know to write basic codes. But, when I execute the code in Python(command line) it closes immediately. Is there any piece of code that can prevent this from happening or a trick? Please help me out. Cheers!
P.S: I use Python 2.7 in Windows.
Assistant: If you're seeing a Command Prompt open and immediately close when you double-click your .py file, that's to be expected - it's not how you're supposed to run a console-based Python script.
What you should do is start a Command Prompt via the Start menu, then run your program by typing c:\python27\python.exe myscript.py or similar.
Alternatively, use a Python IDE (eg. Idle) or an editor (eg. Scite) that can run Python scripts.
