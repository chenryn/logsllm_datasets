I'm unable to link my GitHub account to FreeCodeCamp
(http://www.freecodecamp.com/fccbd1cb0b2). It gives me the message: Your
GitHub is already associated with another account. You may have accidentally
created a duplicate account. No worries, though. We can fix this real quick.
Please email us with your GitHub username: team@freecodecamp.com.
I sent an email to PI:EMAIL last week and have not yet heard
back.
