I am experiencing difficulty linking my GitHub account to FreeCodeCamp (http://www.freecodecamp.com/fccbd1cb0b2). When I attempt to do so, I receive the following message: "Your GitHub account is already associated with another account. You may have accidentally created a duplicate account." The message also suggests that this issue can be resolved quickly by emailing the FreeCodeCamp team with my GitHub username at team@freecodecamp.com.

I sent an email to the provided address last week but have not yet received a response. Could you please look into this for me?
