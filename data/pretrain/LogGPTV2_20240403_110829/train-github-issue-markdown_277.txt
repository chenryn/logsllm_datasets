The scope of a block of PHP code that is enclosed inside of a separate
language (ie. within a JS block in a page) is not detected properly if the
enclosing PHP tags are both on the same line. If the tags are not separated
onto different lines then Atom thinks the code is just part of the enclosing
code block.
For example, this bit of code is incorrectly detected as part of the
JavaScript block:

While this code is properly detected as being a PHP block:
