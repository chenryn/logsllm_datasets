User: I am trying to import the OpenGL.GL module.
Given the py file with that line, I can perform "python file.py" just fine, but I cannot run that same file when used in Aptana or Eclipse. Both IDEs have PyDev installed.
I do have PyOpenGL installed.
I wish to point out that I can still import other modules (PIL, numpy), which were installed the same way as the PyOpenGL. I am confident that there is only 1 python running on my MacOS.
Assistant: I had the same problem after installing a different version of PyOpen and my Eclipse PyDev path is messed up. What I did was remove the interpreter link and re-added the old one which made PyDev to re-scan my libs. This seems to fix the problem. Don't forget for all your projects, you need to go to the property (Right click project->properties) and re-select the interpreter.
