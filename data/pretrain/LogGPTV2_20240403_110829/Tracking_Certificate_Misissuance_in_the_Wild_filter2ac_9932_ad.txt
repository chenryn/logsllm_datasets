### Popular Libraries and Techniques

Popular libraries [8], [12], [24] often employ a combination of fuzzing, differential testing, and symbolic execution to identify code paths in validation libraries that deviate from standards or introduce exploitable bugs. For instance, Sivakorn et al. used black-box testing on SSL/TLS libraries to verify the correctness of the hostname validation process in various client-side libraries [40]. In contrast, our work focuses on the quality of the certificates and the organizations that issue them, rather than the quality of the libraries and applications that verify them.

### Conclusion

In this study, we introduced ZLint, a linter designed to check certificates for compliance with published technical standards. We applied ZLint to browser-trusted certificates in Censys and characterized the misissuance in the Web PKI. Our findings indicate a significant reduction in misissuance over the past five years, with only 0.2% of certificates containing errors in 2017. However, a subset of 295 authorities continues to misissue at least 10% of their certificates, and 18 authorities have errors in all of their certificates. Most of these organizations are small Certificate Authorities (CAs) that have issued fewer than 1,000 certificates. We observed a correlation between misissuance, other types of mismanagement, and, in some cases, browser actions. This suggests that lint errors can help identify CAs with concerning operational practices. However, many of the authorities with the highest misissuance rates have not been publicly discussed. We conclude with a discussion on how the community might better use lint data to strengthen the Web PKI.
