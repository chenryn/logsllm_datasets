User: I'm searching for a way to generate a (limited time license) .so
when a user starts the program . it has to check license date first before the program runs.
but the problem is :
i tried a couple of solutions . one of them is python's time.ctime , (to check time and see if it's realy during the license time) and it returns the time of the machine, so whenever a user want to use software without license he'll just change time of the machine. 
 i hope the idea is clear enough
any better ideas?
please inform me if you want more explanation
Assistant: Nearly every standard function will return the machine time that can be adjusted by the user.
One possibility is to call a web service that returns the "correct" time. But this is only possible if you can assume internet access.
And may be should ask your self the question if that hassle is really worth the effort?
