User:  How to set the timeout period of SSH connection to improve server security?
Assistant: To set the SSH connection timeout, you can follow the steps below: 1. Edit the SSH configuration file Open the SSH configuration file, usually located at /etc/ssh/sshd_config. Open this file with a text editor, for example, use the nano command: ``` sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config ``` 2. Add the timeout configuration Add the following line at the end of the file, set the timeout to 10 minutes (600 seconds) : ``` ClientAliveInterval 600 ClientAliveCountMax 0 ``` Among them, ClientAliveInterval indicates how many seconds the server sends a keep-alive message, and ClientAliveCountMax indicates the number of sending times. The above method will not limit the number of sending to unlimited. 3. Save and restart the SSH service After saving the file, restart the SSH service: ``` sudo service ssh restart ``` Now, the SSH connection will automatically disconnect after 10 minutes of no activity. Note: Setting an SSH connection timeout that is too short may affect user experience. It is recommended to set an appropriate timeout. In addition, in terms of improving server security, you can also take the following measures: - Disable root account login - Use SSH key authentication - Disable insecure SSH protocol version - Enable a firewall, and limit the IP address and port range of SSH connections - Regularly change SSH login passwords - monitor and record SSH login behaviors, and respond to abnormal behaviors in a timely manner.
