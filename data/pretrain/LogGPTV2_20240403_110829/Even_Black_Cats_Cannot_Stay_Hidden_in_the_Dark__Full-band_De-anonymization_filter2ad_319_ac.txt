simultaneous BT connections, which we seek to monitor.
We develop scripts to enable dynamic control of the con-
nections and trafﬁc exchanged between peers. With this
testbed, we are able to evaluate the performance of our
system against known ground truth, thereby establishing
a system performance baseline.
B. Controlled Single-connection Testbed
The second testbed serves to investigate the success of
snifﬁng a single connection while varying the distance
between the ‘attacker’ and ‘target’. For this, we consider
two representative use cases, namely (1) a Ford S-
Max car (equipped with CarPlay streaming functionality)
that connects to a mobile phone (Apple iPhone SE)
and (2) a phone (Huawei P20) streaming to a headset
(Sony WH1000-XM3). Also in these scenarios, a full-
band trace is ﬁrst recorded using two B210 SDRs and
processed on the same workstation as before.
version of our system with a single SDR and capable
of processing up to 16 channels in real-time, which is
deployed on the 4th ﬂoor of a building (14.5 m elevation)
and connected to a Yagi-Uda antenna with 13 dB gain,
pointed at a trafﬁc junction for a total of 5 days, and
(2) a vehicular testbed, whereby the snifﬁng system is
deployed within a car that travels on the highway for
∼2.5 hours and processes 4 channels over 8 MHz of
spectrum. With both set-ups we aim to estimate how
many distinct cars equipped with BT can be observed
and infer user commuting patterns.
Privacy preservation in data collection: In our in-
the-wild experiments, we do not persistently store any
information that could identify individual users (e.g., the
actual discovered BT address). Instead, we compute on
the ﬂy a hash of this information, which is kept in RAM
for as little as necessary and only to generate the statistics
presented here. We also dispose of RF recordings to
prevent future privacy breaches that could arise, e.g., via
physical interface ﬁngerprinting.
VII. EVALUATION
In this section we provide a comprehensive evaluation
of the designed BT snifﬁng and re-identiﬁcation system.
We begin by assessing in our controlled environment
the time required to re-identify devices, in the pres-
ence/absence of trafﬁc and with varying number of
devices. We compare the performance of our system
in terms of detection time and accuracy against that of
Ubertooth [17], which is the only existing open-source
commodity platform for BT snifﬁng. We then study the
impact of the distance to target on device detection time,
via experiments with CarPlay and wireless headset sys-
tems. We use this set-up to also investigate how choosing
different (sub)sets of channels for snifﬁng affects the
re-identiﬁcation performance. Finally, we investigate the
potential of attacks on user privacy in the wild, assessing
how many connected cars we can identify and inferring
user commuting patterns. The following section gives
a detailed comparison with Ubertooth, the only open
platform with functionality similar to that of our system,
while in Appendix B we take the sniffer on the highway
and offer further perspectives on the seriousness of the
privacy threats our platform enables. Our systematic
study will demonstrate that concerns for BT user privacy
are well justiﬁed.
C. In-the-wild Environment
A. Re-identiﬁcation Time
Lastly, we measure the performance of our system
in the wild, using two distinct set-ups: (1) a smaller

can be conﬁgured to generate IP packets using iperf.
We consider two scenarios: (1) with no IP trafﬁc, so
that only BT keep-alive frames are transmitted, and
(2) with IP trafﬁc between peers (similar to streaming
applications). We position the sniffer’s antenna at ap-
proximately 2 meters from the targets (all RP devices
are placed next to each other on a 1 meter wide board).
We perform full-band snifﬁng for 30 seconds and process
each captured trace starting from three different points
in time, separated by 2 seconds. We then measure the
time required to detect all sessions. The obtained results
are shown in Fig. 7, where we report the Empirical
Cumulative Distribution Function (ECDF) of the time
required to retrieve LAPs and identifying the UAPs for
each connection. Once found, we discard a UAP and
restart re-identiﬁcation from scratch. In this way, we
can obtain statistical signiﬁcance of detection times by
running our technique on a single trace.
Observe that when IP trafﬁc is present, our system
can detect and de-anonymize 80% of the BT sessions
within less than 1 s of snifﬁng. In the absence of data
trafﬁc, we still require only 2 s of trafﬁc to detect 80%
of sessions. All connections are identiﬁed in just over 3
seconds when connections exchange trafﬁc and in less
than 7 seconds if only keep-alive frames are present.
Turning attention to the time required to compute
the UAP of the master for each connection, in Fig. 8
we plot the histograms of the trace time required when
IP trafﬁc is absent/present. We remark that the average
time between the ﬁrst observation of a BT session and
the successful resolution of the associated UAP is only
516 ms when IP trafﬁc exists on the connection, while
1.119 s are required when the connection is up but not
actively used to transmit data.

B. Impact of Distance to Target
Next, we focus on assessing the impact of the distance
to a target connection on re-identiﬁcation performance.
For this purpose, we work with the controlled single
device testbed (see Sec. VI-B), considering both outdoor
(CarPlay) and indoor (headset) scenarios.
We report in Fig. 9a the performance of our sys-
tem when we seek to intercept and de-anonymize a
connection between the vehicle and the phone, as we
increase the distance from the sniffer, while measuring
the average number of UAPs solved per second (top sub-
plot) and the time require to compute the target UAP
(bottom sub-plot). Frames are assumed to be correctly
received if the Access Code is valid and the 1/3 FEC
decoding of the Header does not need error correction
(i.e., all bits within 3-bit groups have the same value).
We compute statistics when the target connection is 40 m
away from the sniffer and does not perform any audio
streaming and respectively when at a 85 m distance, with
streaming on. To put things into perspective, we also
consider a “garage” scenario where the car is very close
to the sniffer and the phone streams music to it.
The ﬁrst thing to observe is the notable difference
between the “garage” scenario and the “outdoor” ones
in terms of time required to successfully solve a target
UAP (bottom). This can be attributed to the fact that
RF signals attenuate with the distance and the medium
becomes more prone to noise and external interference.
The median time to solve UAPs outdoors is in the
300 ms range. We also note that the number of frames
processed before a successful UAP resolution, when the
BT connection is idle and respectively used to stream
music, is comparable. On average, fewer than 7 frames
need to be sniffed when the CarPlay connection is

actively used, while approximately 11 frames are needed
if the connection is up but not used to stream music.
In Fig. 9b, we show the results of similar experi-
ments conducted in the headset scenario, i.e., where a
connection between a mobile phone that streams music
to a wireless headset is targeted at different distances.
In the “walk” experiments, the target is moving within
a 10 m range from the sniffer, while the rest of the
measurements correspond to cases where the user is in
a ﬁxed location at the indicated distances. It is clear that
the performance of our system depends on the distance to
the target connection, i.e., we can solve the target UAP
much faster if the BT devices are closer. However, in
all cases less than 6 frames are needed to re-identify
the master UAP. This is consistent with the CarPlay
experiments in which the phone was streaming music.
C. Impact of Number of Channels Sniffed
Undoubtedly, the number of channels employed for
snifﬁng impacts on the accuracy of the snifﬁng and re-
identiﬁcation system, but also on applicability. Snifﬁng
fewer channels at a time would make real-time surveil-
lance possible, but can also miss some potential targets.
To understand how monitoring different parts of the
spectrum used by BT affects the success of attacks, we
conduct new experiments in the CarPlay scenario where
the phone streams music, whilst we sniff frames on all
channels, half of them, then 20, 10, 2, and respectively
1 channel(s). Results are summarized in Fig. 10.
It comes at no surprise that we are able to infer
the UAP of the target connection within milliseconds,
if all channels are observed. The performance degrades
only marginally if we listen on either the lower or the
upper part of the spectrum. The target UAP can still
