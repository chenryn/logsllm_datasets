User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题WDS Service Won't Start Server 2008 R2

When attempting to start the WDS service we're getting the following error:

Windows could not start the Windows Deployment Services Server on Local Computer. For more information review the System Event Log. If this is a non-Microsoft service, contact the service vendor and refer to service-specific error code 8.

Okay then. In the system log we're seeing the following:

The Windows Deployment Service Server service terminated with service-specific error Not enough storage is available to process this command.

This is not a disk space issue as there's plenty available on all disks.

We're thinking it could be something with Windows internal database? but I honestly have no clue how to start troubleshooting that.

There are other information messages in the Application log for MSSQL that may support this theory? 

The description for Event ID 18456 from source MSSQL$MICROSOFT##SSEE cannot be found. Either the component that raises this event is not installed on your local computer or the installation is corrupted. You can install or repair the component on the local computer.

If the event originated on another computer, the display information had to be saved with the event.

The following information was included with the event: 

NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE
 [CLIENT: ]

The specified resource type cannot be found in the image file

It may be helpful to note that this seemed to start happening right after we migrated WSUS from another server onto this one.

I've been searching all over the internet for someone who has this exact error and I'm not finding anything. (Don't you hate it when that happens?)

I've tried completely removing the WDS role and reinstalling it -- didn't help. 

I suppose I'd really just like some guidance on where to go from here if anyone has any ideas.

Assistant: If you configured WSUS to use WID as well, then it sounds like something may have gone awry with WID. You should be able to have both applications using the same WID instance, so it's not like this is necessarily a compatibility issue. 

I would either restore from a pre-WSUS backup and reinstall WSUS again, or completely uninstall the WDS, WSUS roles and remove the WID feature, and reinstall them all.
