  * Have a single go implementation of the "List then Watch" pattern. Use this everywhere. 
    * This is about hiding the details of calling list and watch and restarting watches.
    * This is about apiserver watches. Etcd use cases going away, so don't worry about them.
    * The `Reflector` object in `pkg/client/cache` is trying to be this.
    * Reconcile duplicated implementations in `pkg/proxy/config` and `pkg/client/cache` (the latter used by scheduler, and by kubelet after #3385 is merged. differences include: 
      * Jittering in `pkg/proxy/config/api.go`,
      * resource-specific `ServicesWatcher` interface in `pkg/proxy/config` vs generic `ListerWatcher` interface in `pkg/client/cache`.
      * one writes complete state to a Store and the other writes deltas to a channel.
      * differences in error handling in the watch implementations: make sure we keep best from each.
