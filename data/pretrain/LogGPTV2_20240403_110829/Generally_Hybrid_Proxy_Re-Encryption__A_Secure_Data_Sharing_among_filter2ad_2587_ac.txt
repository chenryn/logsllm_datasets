Necessity of Temporary Public Keys in Construct-
ing GHPRE. It is clear that any initial PRE ciphertext
of β can not be directly decrypted by a private key of α.
Hence, to construct GHPRE, a certain of transformation on
an initial PRE ciphertext of β is needed before decrypting
it by a private key of α. According to Deﬁnition 3, its re-
encryption function is the only one transformation on an
initial PRE ciphertext. Moreover, the regular application
of the re-encryption function only can transform an initial
PRE ciphertext into a new ciphertext that can be decrypted
by a private key of β not of α. Hence, we have to propose a
new method to apply the re-encryption function. It is clear
that the promising new method is to apply the re-encryption
function with the temporary public keys, since any method
to apply the re-encryption function with the real public keys
is the regular application.
Consistency Proof. According to the general deﬁnition
of PRE, γ must satisfy two kinds of consistencies. For the
ﬁrst consistency, it is obvious that γ is satisfactory, if the
PRE scheme β is consistent. The second consistency of γ is
guaranteed by the following theorem, which is proven in the
full version of this paper.
Theorem 1. Suppose both the PKE scheme α and the
PRE scheme β are consistent. For any re-encrypted PRE ci-

IND-S-CPA Security Proof. We reduce the security
of our proposed GHPRE scheme to the securities of its two
underlying PRE and PKE schemes. In this reduction, we
suppose there is an adversary A can break our scheme, and
the underlying PKE scheme is secure. Then we construct
another adversary B who leverages the capability of A to
break the underlying PRE scheme, and prove that if A suc-
ceeds then B also succeeds. Hence, if the underlying PRE
scheme is secure, then the assumption of adversary A is not
true. In other words, no one can break our scheme if the un-
derlying PRE and PKE schemes are secure. Speciﬁcally, the
security of γ is guaranteed by the following theorem, which
is proven in the full version of this paper.

Theorem 2. Let A be a PPT adversary who has advan-
tage AdvIN D-S-CP A
to break the GHPRE scheme γ in the
IND-S-CPA game. Suppose the PKE scheme α is IND-CPA
secure, and A can not query the temporary private keys
whose corresponding temporary public key were employed
for the challenge public key to generate re-encryption keys.
Then we can construct a PPT adversary B with advantage
AdvIN D-S-CP A
to break the PRE scheme
β in the IND-S-CPA game.

INTERACTION VS NON-INTERACTION
FOR GHPRE
α, SK 0
β, SK 1
In γ, algorithm RKγ(MPγ, P K 0
β) runs Extractβ(
MPβ, MSβ, aux1
β) to generate a pair of temporary pub-
lic and private keys (P K 1
β) of the PRE scheme β,
.
and then generates the re-encryption key RKγ,P K0
β→P K0
In application, algorithm RKγ(MPγ, P K 0
β) is imple-
mented by the user who is the owner of the private key SK 0
β
(the user SK 0
β for short), and the master secret parameter
MSβ only be held by KGCβ. So the user SKβ must inter-
act with KGCβ to run Extractβ(MPβ, MSβ, aux1
β). This
interaction consists of two passes of communication, and its
main communication cost is a pair of temporary public and
private keys. Although γ requires this interaction, it is still
much more practical and general than some non-interactive
GHPRE schemes.
α, SK 0

α, SK 0
Inspired by γ, if the user SK 0
β knows the main secret
parameter MSβ, then he can non-interactively run RKγ(
MPγ, P K 0
β). But this method obviously causes a se-
rious risk that all users’ private keys will be leaked to the
user SKβ. In order to overcome this risk as well as construct
a non-interactive GHPRE scheme, we can require that each
user independently sets up a PRE scheme. In other words,
all users will use diﬀerent PRE schemes. When any user
wants to securely store his cloud data, he will encrypt his
cloud data by his own PRE scheme. When any user wants
to securely share his cloud data with another user, he will
use γ to complete this work. Since any user knows the
master secret parameter of his own PRE scheme, he can
non-interactively run RKγ. However, this non-interactive
GHPRE scheme obviously is impractical.
Suppose many users commonly use a PRE scheme (ini-
tialized by a KGC) to securely store and share their data in
cloud for a long time. When these users would like to se-
curely share their data with the users of another PRE/PKE-
917based cloud, the above non-interactive GHPRE scheme re-
quires that all users independently set up a PRE scheme
and encrypt their existing cloud data again by their own
PRE schemes. Obviously, no one would like to accept this
requirement in practice. On the contrary, the proposed (or
interactive) GHPRE scheme γ does not require these users
do anything before employing it.
In addition, it is observable that γ can be transformed into
a non-interactive one if the PRE scheme β (the building
block of γ) can provide some special features. But it is
obvious that these special requirements on β let the resulted
GHPRE schemes lose their generality. For example, if the
public keys of β are certiﬁcate-based, then γ directly is a
non-interactive one since the main secret parameter M Sβ =
N U LL. Another example is that if the public keys of β
are hierarchically identity-based, then all users can generate
their temporary public and private keys by their private keys
instead of by the main secret parameter M Sβ. Clearly, γ
can be easily transformed into a non-interactive one if some
special features are given. But these transformations let the
GHPRE scheme γ lose its generality.
5. CONCLUSIONS
In order to achieve the secure data sharing among diﬀer-
ent PRE schemes, this paper proposes the GHPRE scheme.
Without loss of generality, given a PRE scheme β and a
PKE scheme α, the GHPRE scheme allows users of β to
delegate re-encryption keys to a proxy, who can re-encrypt
users’ outsourced encrypted data into the new ciphertexts
to be decrypted by the intended users of α. To guarantee
the generality of the GHPRE scheme, we ﬁrst unify the def-
initions of the existing PRE and PKE schemes and their
IND-CPA and IND-S-CPA securities. Then taking the gen-
erally deﬁned PRE and PKE schemes as inputs, we utilize
temporarily generated pairs of public and private keys to
construct the GHPRE scheme, and prove that if the input
PRE and PKE schemes are secure, the GHPRE scheme is
secure. Finally, we analyze the GHPRE scheme. Although
this scheme employs an interactive process to generate each
re-encryption key, we demonstrate that this scheme is a gen-
eral method as being practical to securely share data among
any PRE schemes.
