After installing the prerequisites (and setting the following environment
variables):
    export NO_CUDA=1
    export NO_DISTRIBUTED=1
    export NO_MKLDNN=1 
    export NO_NNPACK=1
    export NO_QNNPACK=1
I could not complete the build with the following command:
`make -VERBOSE=1`
The tail of the error messages is:
    /home/pi/projects/pytorch/build/confu-srcs/pthreadpool/include/pthreadpool.h:223:2: warning: ‘pthreadpool_function_4d_tiled_t’ is deprecated [-Wdeprecated-declarations]

I understand that trying to install **pytorch** on RPi0W detracts but I'm
willing to be an able-bodied tester since I have quite a few Raspberry Pi Zero
W boards where I need **pytorch** to work. The RPi0 boards have many other
packages (for vision/image/ML) working and I was hoping to install **pytorch**
too. Any help will be sincerely appreciated.
Kind regards.
