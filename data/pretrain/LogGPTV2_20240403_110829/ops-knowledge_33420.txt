User: Python has its own RotatingFileHandler which is supposed to automatically rotate log files. As part of a linux application which would need to rotate it's log file every couple of weeks/months, I am wondering if it is any different than having a config file in logrotate.d and using a WatchedFileHandler instead.
Is there any difference in how they operate? Is one method safer, more efficient, or considered superior to the other?
Assistant: RotatingFileHandler allows a log file to grow up to size N, and then immediately and automatically rotates to a new file.
logrotate.d runs once per day usually. If you want to limit a log file's size, logrotate.d is not the most helpful because it only runs periodically.
