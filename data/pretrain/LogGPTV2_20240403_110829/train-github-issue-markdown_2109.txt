Since the default recommended filters for scipy are now SOS, it should make
sense to use them for decimate (and other internal uses)
This is the current state of scipy.signal.decimate
            if zero_phase:
                y = filtfilt(b, a, x, axis=axis)
            else:
                y = lfilter(b, a, x, axis=axis)
Sorry if this isn't the right class of Issue, new to doing this.
