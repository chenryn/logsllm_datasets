**Subject: Using a Remote Python Interpreter with Eclipse PyDev**

Is it possible to configure Eclipse PyDev to use a remote Python interpreter?

I am interested in this feature because the Linux server I need to connect to has several optimization solvers (such as CPLEX, Gurobi, etc.) that my scripts utilize. Currently, I write the scripts locally using Eclipse, then transfer all the files to the remote machine. I log in via SSH and run the scripts there using `python script.py`.

Ideally, I would like to be able to click the "Run" button in Eclipse and have the script execute directly on the remote server, without the need for manual file transfers and SSH commands.

Thank you.

**Response:**

Unfortunately, Eclipse PyDev does not support using a remote Python interpreter directly. However, you can remotely connect to your Linux server using the Remote System Explorer (RSE) plugin, but this will not allow you to use the remote interpreter within the IDE.

As an alternative, I recommend using PyCharm. PyCharm's Professional Edition supports remote interpreters and allows you to run and debug your scripts directly on the remote server. The Community Edition of PyCharm is free and also quite powerful, though it lacks some of the advanced features available in the Professional Edition. The Professional Edition is reasonably priced and has been working great for me.

I hope this helps!
