User: is there a posibility to make eclipse PyDev use a remote Python interpreter?
I would like to do this, as the Linux Server I want to connect to has several optimization solvers (CPLEX, GUROBI etc.) running, that my script uses.
Currently I use eclipse locally to write the scripts, then copy all the files to the remote machine, log in using ssh and execute the scripts there with "python script.py".
Instead I hope to click the "run" button and just have everything executed within my eclipse IDE.
Thanks
Assistant: Unfortunately no. You can remotely connect to your Linux server via Remote System Explorer (RSE). But can't use it as a remote interpreter. I use Pycharm. You can use the free Community Edition or the Professional Edition for which you have to pay for it. It is not that expensive and it has been working great for me.
