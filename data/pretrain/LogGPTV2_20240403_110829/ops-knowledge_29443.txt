User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How can I prevent Apache from logging 404 errors? So, whenever a user tries to fetch a file on my Apache server that doesn't exist I get a 404 line in the Access log:

[29/Sep/2010:12:14:45 +0200] "GET /asdf HTTP/1.1" 404


And I also get this in the Error log:

[Wed Sep 29 12:14:45 2010] [error] [client] File does not exist: /www/site/asdf


Is there a way to suppress 404 erros from showing up in the error log- only in the access log?

Assistant: ErrogLog(http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/core.html#errorlog) have not conditional.
You can send the logs to syslog or script and filter it.
