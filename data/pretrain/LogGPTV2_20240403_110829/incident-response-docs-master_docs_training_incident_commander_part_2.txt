!!!warning "Can someone..."
    Never say "Can someone..." as this leads to the [bystander effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect). Tasks should always be assigned directly to an individual, and never just thrown out with the hope that someone will pick it up.
> IC: Bob, please investigate the high latency on web app boxes. I'll come back to you for an answer in 3 minutes.
> Bob: Understood
Keep track of how many minutes you assigned, and check in with that person after that time. You can get help from your deputy to help track the timings.
### Gaining Consensus (Polling During a Decision)
If a decision needs to be made, it comes down to the IC. Once the IC makes a decision, it is final. But it's important that no one can come later and object to the plan, saying things like "I knew that would happen". An IC will use very specific language to be sure that doesn't happen, and to gain implicit consensus of everyone on the response.
> The proposal is to [EXPLAIN PROPOSAL]
> Are there any strong objections to this plan?
> (pause)
> Hearing no objects, we are proceeding with this proposal.
If you were to ask "Does everyone agree?", you'd get people speaking over each other, you'd have quiet people not speaking up, etc. Asking for any STRONG objections gives people the chance to object, but only if they feel strongly on the matter. It also means that the information you care about the most (objections to proceeding) are heard loud and clearly.
### Status Updates
It's important to maintain a cadence during a major incident call. Whenever there is a lull in the proceedings, usually because you're waiting for someone to get back to you, you can fill the gap by explaining the current situation and the actions that are outstanding. This makes sure everyone is on the same page.
> While we wait for [X], here's an update of our current situation.
> We are currently in a SEV-1 situation, we believe to be caused by [X]. There's an open question to [Y] who will be getting back to us in 2 minutes. In the meantime, we have Tweeted out that we are experiencing issues. Our next Tweet will be in 10 minutes if the incident is still ongoing at that time.
> Are there any additional actions or proposals from anyone else at this time?
### Reducing Scope
Once you've identified the cause of an incident, you can take some time to reduce the scope of your call. For example, if you've identified that a bad deploy is the cause, there's no need to keep your network engineering responder on the call. Responders will usually appreciate not having to stick around for something that doesn't involve them, especially when it's 3am. Generally, it's best to list out the people you want to remain on the call (rather than listing those that can leave), as this not only re-affirms who is required, but makes sure you won't forget about anyone who can leave.
> Now that we've identified the primary cause and are on the way to recovery, I need the Deputy, Scribe, Support, and site-reliability experts to stay on the call. Everyone else, thanks very much for your response, feel free to drop-off at your discretion.
There's no need to forcibly remove anyone from the call, leave the choice open. Sometimes responders prefer to remain to see how the incident eventually resolves, since they're already awake anyway.
### Spinning Off Sub-Teams
When handling [complex incidents](../before/complex_incidents.md), it will sometimes be necessary to spin off a sub-team (or multiple sub-teams) to investigate specific issues in more detail before reporting back. This is to ensure that you can maintain an effective span of control. To do this, you should assign a team leader, give them a specific task (time-boxed in the usual way), and re-affirm that they are your primary contact and that all communication from their team should come via the leader. Use our pre-defined team names of Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie to avoid confusion when creating the teams.
> IC: Anne, I'd like you to lead a sub-team to investigate the ongoing latency in the web-tier. Please gather your desired team and investigate, get back to me in 20 minutes. All communication from your team should be filtered through you. Use the Alpha team rooms and phone bridge.
> Anne: Understood, I'll get back with an update in 20 minutes.
You do not need to prescribe who their team consists of. Either they will have a pre-existing team structure they can utilize, or they should take the initiative to assemble a team on their own. You should pick your team leaders accordingly.
### Transfer of Command
Transfer of command, involves (as the name suggests) transferring command to another Incident Commander. There are multiple reasons why a transfer of command might take place,
* Commander has become fatigued and is unable to continue.
* Incident complexity changes.
* Change of command is necessary for effectiveness or efficiency.
* Personal emergencies arise (e.g., Incident Commander has a family emergency).
Never feel like you are not doing your job properly by handing over. Handovers are encouraged. In order to handover, out of band from the main call (via Slack for example), notify the other IC that you wish to transfer command. Update them with anything you feel appropriate. Then announce on the call,
> Everyone on the call, be advised, at this time I am handing over command to [X].
The new IC should then announce on the call as if they were joining a new call (see above), so that everyone is aware of the new commander.
Note that the arrival of a more qualified person does NOT necessarily mean a change in incident command.
### End of Call Sign-Off
At the end of an incident, you should announce to everyone on the call that you are ending the call at this time, and provide information on where follow-up discussion can take place. It's also customary to thank everyone.
> Ok everyone, we're ending the call at this time. Please continue any follow-up discussion on Slack. Thanks everyone.
## Handling Problems
Things don't always go smoothly on incident response calls, so as an Incident Commander you need to be prepared for instances where the conversation gets derailed, either intentionally or unintentionally. Here are some procedures and lingo you can follow when things get disruptive, in order to get things back on track.
### Maintaining Order
Often times on a call people will be talking over one another, or an argument on the correct way to proceed may break out. As Incident Commander it's important that order is maintained on a call. The Incident Commander has the power to remove someone from the call if necessary (even if it's the CEO). But often times you just need to remind people to speak one at a time. Sometimes the discussion can be healthy even if it starts as an argument, but you shouldn't let it go on for too long.
> (noise)
> Ok everyone, can we all speak one at a time please. So far I'm hearing two options to proceed: 1) [X], 2) [Y].
> Are there any other proposals someone would like to make at this time?
> ...etc
### Getting Straight Answers
You may ask a question as IC and receive an answer that doesn't actually answer your question. This is generally when you ask for a yes/no answer but get a more detailed explanation. This can often times be because the person doesn't understand the call etiquette. But if it continues, you need to take action in order to proceed.
> IC: Is this going to disable the service for everyone?
> SME: Well... for some people it....
> IC: Stop. I need a yes/no answer. Is this going to disable the service for everyone?
> SME: Well... it might not do...
> IC: Stop. I'm going to ask again, and the only two words I want to hear from you are "yes" or "no. Is this going to disable the service for everyone?
> SME: Well.. like I was saying..
> IC: Stop. Leave the call. Backup IC can you please page the backup on-call for [service] so that we can get an answer.
### Executive Swoop - Overriding the Incident Commander
> Executive: Ignore the incident commander, do what I say!
This is an extreme example, but illustrates the concept of "Executive Swoop", whereby someone who would be senior to you during peacetime comes on the call and starts overriding your decisions as IC. This is unacceptable behaviour during wartime, as the IC is in command. This is rare, but can cripple the response process if it happens. There is a simple question you can ask as an Incident Commander to get things back on track, "Do you wish to take command?",
> Executive: No, I don't want us doing that. Everyone stop. We need to rollback instead.
> IC: Hold please. [EXECUTIVE], do you wish to take over command?
> Executive: Yes/No
> (If yes) IC: Understood. Everyone on the call, be advised, at this time I am handling over command to [EXECUTIVE]. They are now the Incident Commander for this call.
> (If no) IC: In that case, please cause no further interruptions or I will remove you from the call.
This makes it clear to the executive that they have the option of being in charge and making decisions, but in order to do so they must continue as an Incident Commander. If they refuse, then remind them that you are in charge and disruptive interruptions will not be tolerated. If they continue, remove them from the call.
### Executive Swoop - Anti-Motivation
> Executive: Let's try and resolve this in 10 minutes please!
It's rare for an executive to maliciously derail an incident response call, usually it is done with the best of intentions. However, these good intentions can still derail your response process and demotivate responders. As an Incident Commander you will need to recognize and respond to these situations. In the case above, it seems motivational, however it assumes responders aren't already working as hard as possible to solve the problem, and adds no value to the response process. You can respond to this by reminding the commenter that these things should be kept until after the incident is over.
> IC: We're in the middle of an incident, please keep your comments until the end.
### Executive Swoop - Wants Information
> Executive: Can I get a spreadsheet of all affected customers?
The most common case of executive swoop is a request for more information. Unfortunately, when in the middle of an incident, you typically cannot spare the resources to gather such information. As an Incident Commander you should remind the executive of this, and that the incident takes priority.
> We can either get you that list, or fix the incident. Not both. The incident takes priority.
Note that this isn't phrased as a question, you've already made the decision as Incident Commander, you're just informing the executive of that decision.
### Executive Swoop - Questioning Severity
> Executive: Is this really a SEV-1?
Our severity levels determine the scale of response we give to an incident. Conversations on what severity an incident is can very quickly consume the entire call and doesn't change the fact that there is an incident on-going. We do not discuss incident severity during an incident call, as we treat an incident as the highest severity we think it could be. We can downgrade the severity during the postmortem, however we cannot waste time litigating severities on an incident call. So simply remind folks of this in order to get things back on track:
> IC: We do not discuss incident severity during the call. We're treating this as a SEV-1.
### The Belligerent Responder
Sometimes you will have a responder who does not follow instructions and/or is being actively disruptive to your response call. Perhaps this is being done intentionally, or it could even be unintentional (an un-muted microphone while in a loud environment, etc). In either case, you need to resolve the situation and get back to the incident at hand. State the fact that the individual is being disruptive, provide them a way to save face, but also state what will happen if they don't stop. No second chances, if they don't follow through, remove them from the call.
> You're being disruptive. Please stop, or I will have to remove you from the call.
## Examples From Pop Culture
PagerDuty employees have access to all previous incident calls, and can listen to them at their discretion. We can't release these calls, so for everyone else, here are some short examples from popular culture to show the techniques at work.
---
Here's a clip from the movie Apollo 13, where Gene Kranz (Flight Director / Incident Commander) shows some great examples of Incident Command. Here are some things to note:
* Walks into the room, and immediately obvious that he's the IC. Calms the noise, and makes sure everyone is paying attention.
* Provides a status update so people are aware of the situation.
* Projector breaks, doesn't get sidetracked on fixing it, just moves on to something else.
* Provides a proposal for how to proceed and elicits feedback.
    * Listens to the feedback calmly.
    * When counter-proposal is raised, states that he agrees and why.
* Allows a discussion to happen, listens to all points. When discussion gets out of hand, re-asserts command of the situation.
    * Explains his decision, and why.
* Explains his full plan and decision, so everyone is on the same page.
---
Another clip from Apollo 13. Things to note:
* Summarizes the situation, and states the facts.
* Listens to the feedback from various people.
* When a trusted SME provides information counter to what everyone else is saying, asks for additional clarification ("What do you mean, everything?")
* Wise cracking remarks are not acknowledged by the IC ("You can't run a vacuum cleaner on 12 amps!")
* "That's the deal?".. "That's the deal".
* Once decision is made, moves on to the next discussion.
* Delegates tasks.
