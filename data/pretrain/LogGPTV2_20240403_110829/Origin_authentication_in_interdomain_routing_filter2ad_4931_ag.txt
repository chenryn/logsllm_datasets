organization, respectively. Hence, the veriﬁer will perform either 1
or (cid:14) signature operations to validate the preﬁxes. The storage costs
are one signature plus the number of preﬁxes, or (cid:14) signatures plus
the number of preﬁxes associated with those ASe/organizations.
The veriﬁer need only validate a single signature in all tree schemes.
This represents a minimal cost, and can be used to vastly reduce the
computational requirements placed on veriﬁers. The storage costs
associated with authentication delegation trees are dependent on
the locality of reference. That is, the costs are low where the proofs
have common ancestors in the proof tree.
The storage costs of each approach is illustrated through the
following ﬁctional example. Assume that a signature size is 110
bytes (from [18], (cid:30) (cid:0) (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:5)), four-byte AS/organization identiﬁers
((cid:31) (cid:0) (cid:8)), and the output of the hash function is 16 bytes (e.g.,
as per MD5 [29],  (cid:0) (cid:1)(cid:7))), and that the veriﬁer is validating 100
preﬁxes (out of 1000 issued by an ownership source,  (cid:0) (cid:1)(cid:5)(cid:5),
 (cid:0) (cid:1)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)) associated with 20 unique ASes/organizations (evenly,
(cid:14) (cid:0) (cid:2)(cid:5)(cid:3) (cid:10) (cid:0) (cid:29)(cid:5)). The space used by simple attestations is 11400
bytes, 4110 for authenticated delegation lists, 6200 for AS authenti-
cated delegation lists, and 2110 to 8510 bytes for an authentication
delegation tree.
6.2 Simulation
It is not immediately clear which of the several origin authenti-
cation service designs is the most appropriate for the Internet. In
this section, we evaluate origin authentication services via trace-
based simulation. For simplicity, we do not simulate authentica-
tion dictionaries. Obtained from the RouteViews corpus, all exper-
iments use a trace of BGP updates arriving at a single BGP speaker
on April 2, 2003. The trace contains 653,649 UPDATE messages
recorded over a 24 hour period (midnight to midnight).
The OAsim simulator models the operation of a single BGP speaker.
After preprocessing a delegation map, this simulator accepts timed

BGP UPDATE streams and computes the costs associated with
the validation and storage of the associated origin authentication
proofs. OAsim implements four service designs modeled in the
previous section: simple attestations, authenticated delegation lists,
AS authenticated delegation lists, and authentication delegation
trees. The simulator maintains a variable size (LRU) cache which
models the unique storage costs of each approach. Proof sizes are
derived using the formulas presented in the previous section. We
assume that all certiﬁcates are stored locally (e.g., not considered
when calculating cache sizes).
In all tests, we model online operation as transmitting delega-
tion and assignment proofs through the BGP optional transitive at-
tributes [32] . The bandwidth experiments ignore the current BGP
MTU (4096 bytes). We seek to understand the efﬁcacy of optimal
solutions, and as such relax relax this systemic limitation. Note that
the only construction likely to be frequently affected by the MTU
limitation is the authenticated delegation list. The modeled off-line
schemes simply acquire proofs from external entities where cached
values are not sufﬁcient (e.g., S-BGP repositories, IRVs).
A ﬁrst battery of tests makes a broad comparison of the origin
authentication methods. Figure 4 shows the computational costs
as measured by signatures in 5 minute increments of the 24 hour
trace period (for legibility, the ﬁgures only show a representative 4
hour period during the trace). In all schemes, signature validation
dominates other computational costs (e.g., parsing, hashing, etc.),
and hence, is a good estimate of overall computation. The most
costly solution is the simple attestation:
this stands to reason as
every (uncached) UPDATE leads to a signature validation. This is
followed by the AS authenticated delegation lists which incur a half
to a third fewer signatures.
The authenticated delegation lists and authentication delegation
trees are more efﬁcient – both require at times an order of magni-
tude less computation than simple attestations. Delegating organi-
zations in these schemes issue proofs for all delegations simultane-
ously. Hence, a large cache (in this case 1M) eliminates the need
for many validations. The authentication delegation trees are gen-
erally more effective because each authentication delegation tree
proof is cached separately.
A second set of tests compare the costs of on-line and off-line
OA. As depicted in Figure 5, bandwidth costs in online OA are
