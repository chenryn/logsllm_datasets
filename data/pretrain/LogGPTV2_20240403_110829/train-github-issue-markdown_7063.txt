# Bug report
AMP pages include the query string in the canonical URL.
## Describe the bug
On AMP pages the canonical link includes the query string. This has potential
to cause duplicate content SEO issues on post pages, etc.
Using https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9 as an example:
  * https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9 (``)
  * https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9?utm_source=google (``)
  * https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9?foo=bar (``)
In this example the query string does not affect the content, however each URL
has a different canonical value.
## To Reproduce
Visit an AMP page such as https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9 with and without
query strings. Inspect the canonical link and note the inclusion of the query
string.
## Expected behavior
In the example above, the canonical link should not include the query string.
However, this is nuanced, since in some situations including the query string
(or a subset of the params) might be necessary when building the canonical
link. For example, a URL such as `/post?id=123456&foo=junk` could potentially
require a canonical link of ``
for correct SEO.
Ideally Next would allow full control over the canonical, i.e. it could be
overridden. See #7706 for a similar feature request and #7373.

## Additional context
We are using hybrid AMP rendering for our post pages. We already set our
canonical for the non-AMP version, and there are lots of business and SEO
concerns when it comes to canonical links (we are a media company). Having
full control over the canonical in the AMP context would be incredibly useful
for us.
