After the most recent build and restart of my server, I can access the website using the IP address without any issues. However, when I try to open it using the web URL, I encounter the following error:

```
Uncaught TypeError: c.default.oneOfType is not a function
    at Object.<anonymous> (app.js:1)
    at n (app.js:1)
    at Object.<anonymous> (app.js:7)
    at n (app.js:1)
    at Object.<anonymous> (app.js:9)
    at n (app.js:1)
    at Object.<anonymous> (app.js:154)
    at n (app.js:1)
    at Object.<anonymous> (app.js:66)
    at n (app.js:1)
```

I apologize if this issue has already been reported. I have not been able to resolve it.
