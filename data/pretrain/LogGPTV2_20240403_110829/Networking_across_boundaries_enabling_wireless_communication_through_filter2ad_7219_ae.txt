### 8.3 Robustness to Waves

Finally, we aim to investigate the performance of TARF in the presence of surface waves. Given that TARF communicates by measuring minute vibrations on the water surface, naturally occurring waves are expected to interfere with the communication signals. To evaluate the effectiveness of TARF's interference cancellation in dealing with these waves, we conducted a controlled evaluation in a water tank.

#### Experimental Setup
- **FMCW Radar Positioning**: The FMCW radar was fixed 30 cm above the water surface.
- **Speaker Positioning**: The speaker (acoustic transmitter) was placed 30 cm below the water surface.
- **Wave Emulation**: We manually generated 2 Hz to 3 Hz waves at different peak-to-peak amplitudes, as described in ยง7. Wave amplitudes were measured using a graded ruler, with an estimated uncertainty of approximately 1 cm.
- **Modulation Scheme**: BPSK modulation was used for TARF communication.

#### Results and Observations
- **Throughput vs. Wave Amplitude**: Figure 13 shows the mean and standard deviation of the throughput as a function of the peak-to-peak wave amplitude.
  - **Minimal Degradation up to 6 cm Waves**: TARF maintained minimal degradation in throughput for waves with peak-to-peak amplitudes up to 6 cm. This is significant because such waves are 100,000 times larger than the surface vibrations caused by the underwater acoustic transmitter (as observed in Fig. 3(a)). TARF's ability to handle this large interference is attributed to its unwrapping and filtering stages, which effectively mitigate the slower-moving waves.
  - **Throughput Drops to Zero for Larger Waves**: For waves with peak-to-peak amplitudes of 22 cm or more, TARF's throughput dropped to zero. This performance drop can be attributed to two main factors:
    1. **Phase Unwrapping Limitations**: The phase wraps too quickly for the unwrapping stage to reliably process it.
    2. **Signal Deflection**: Larger waves may deflect the radar reflection away from the receiver due to the partially specular nature of radio waves, leading to a reduction in overall SNR.

### Key Limitations and Development Opportunities

- **One-Directional Communication**: TARF currently only supports uplink communication from the underwater sensor to an airborne node. While this limits the scope of the design, it still opens up many exciting applications in underwater networking.
- **Ocean Wave Amplitude**: Our current prototype can sustain a communication link in the presence of surface waves with peak-to-peak amplitudes up to 16 cm. Extending TARF to operate under stronger waves and inclement weather conditions is desirable. One promising approach is to actively track the surface waves by both the transmitter and receiver and adapt the communication protocol accordingly.
- **Misalignment**: Our evaluation has shown that TARF's performance degrades when the transmitter and receiver are misaligned. An airborne TARF receiver will need to finely scan the water surface to localize the underwater transmitter. This limitation could be mitigated by innovative scanning solutions that adapt the beam profiles of both the acoustic and radar devices based on height, depth, and expected SNR.

Despite these limitations, we believe that TARF represents a significant step toward practical and scalable cross-medium communications. It can enable various applications, including submarine-to-drone communication, deep-sea exploration, and subsea IoT (Internet of Things). We hope that this paper will motivate researchers to explore TARF as a means to achieve truly ubiquitous communication across boundaries.

### 9. Limitations and Opportunities

This paper introduces TARF, the first technology enabling underwater sensors to wirelessly communicate with compact airborne nodes. By transforming the water-air boundary, traditionally considered an obstacle for communication, into a communication interface, TARF holds promise for solving the long-standing problem of cross-medium communications.
