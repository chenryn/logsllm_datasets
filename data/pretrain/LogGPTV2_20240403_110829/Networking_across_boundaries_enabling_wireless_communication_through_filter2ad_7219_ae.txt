the acoustic transmitter and FMCW radar.
8.3 Robustness to Waves
Lastly, we are interested in investigating TARF’s performance
in the presence of surface waves. In particular, because TARF
communicates by measuring minute vibrations on the water
surface, we expect naturally occurring waves to interfere with

Figure 12—SNR vs Misalignment. The figure shows that TARF’s SNR
degrades as a function of the horizontal misalignment between the transmitter
and the receiver. Error bars indicate standard deviation.

the communication signals. Hence, we would like to evaluate
the effectiveness of TARF’s interference cancellation in deal-
ing with these waves. To this end, we performed controlled
evaluation in the water tank, where we fixed the FMCW radar
30cm above the water surface and fixed the speaker 30cm be-
low the surface. In order to quantify the effect of waves with
our system, we emulate naturally occurring waves by creating
2Hz − 3Hz waves [58] at different peak-to-peak amplitudes
and perform TARF communication with BPSK modulation.
Waves were generated manually as described in §7, and their
amplitudes were measured with a graded ruler. We estimate
the uncertainty in our wave amplitude measurement to be of
the order of 1 cm.
Fig. 13 plots the mean and standard deviation of the
throughput as a function of the peak-to-peak amplitude. We
make the following observations:
• TARF’s channel maintained minimal degradation up to
6 cm waves, which are 100, 000× larger than the surface
vibrations caused by the underwater acoustic transmitter, as
observed in Fig. 3(a). TARF’s ability to deal with this large
interference arises from its unwrapping and filtering stages,
which significantly mitigate the slower moving waves.
• For waves whose peak-to-peak amplitude is 22 cm or larger,
TARF’s throughput drops to zero. Multiple factors that
contribute to this performance. First, the phase wraps too
quickly for the unwrapping stage to reliably unwrap it. And
second, larger waves may deflect the radar reflection away
from our receiver (due to radio waves’ partially specular
nature), leading to a reduction in the overall SNR.
Below, we highlight some of TARF’s key limitations and
potential development opportunities:
• One-directional Communication: TARF only enables up-
link communication from the underwater sensor to an air-
borne node. As described in §3, this limits the scope of the
design, but still opens up many exciting applications in the
underwater networking.
• Ocean Wave Amplitude: Our current prototype can sustain
a communication link in the presence of surface waves
with peak-to-peak amplitudes up to 16 cm. It is desirable to
extend TARF to operate with stronger waves and inclement
weather conditions. One promising approach is to actively
track the surface waves by both the transmitter and receiver
and adapt the communication protocol accordingly.
• Misalignment: Our evaluation has demonstrated that
TARF’s performance degrades when the transmitter and
receiver are misaligned. As a result, an airborne TARF re-
ceiver will need to finely scan the water surface in order to
localize the underwater transmitter. This limitation may be
mitigated by innovative scanning solutions that adapt the
beam profiles of both the acoustic and radar devices with
height, depth, and expected SNR.
Despite these limitations, we believe that TARF marks an
important step toward practical and scalable cross-medium
communications. It can enable many applications including
submarine-to-drone communication, deep-sea exploration,
and subsea IoT (Internet of Things). We hope that this paper
will motivate researchers to explore TARF as a means to
enable truly ubiquitous communication across boundaries.
9 LIMITATIONS AND OPPORTUNITIES
This paper presents TARF, the first technology that enables
underwater sensors to wirelessly communicate with com-
pact airborne nodes. TARF transforms the water-air boundary,
which has been traditionally considered an obstacle for com-
munication, itself into a communication interface. As such,
it holds promise to solve the long-standing problem of cross-
medium communications.
