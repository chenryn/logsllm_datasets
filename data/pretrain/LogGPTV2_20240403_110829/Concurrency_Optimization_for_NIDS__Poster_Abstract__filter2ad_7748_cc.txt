Metabolomics with Matrigel-based 3D cell culture: analytical challenges
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Janina Tokarz, Helmholtz Zentrum München, Research Unit Molecular Endocrinology and Metabolism, Germany
CO-AUTHORS: Gabriele Möller, Cornelia Prehn, Jerzy Adamski
Cell culture metabolomics is a versatile tool to understand metabolic processes in cells Two-dimensional (2D) cell culture allows for easy 
manipulation of cells and is well established in metabolomics experiments However, cells in 2D encounter a non-physiological environment and 
are known to loose key functionalities such as their xenobiotic metabolizing capacity These limitations can be overcome by cultivating the cells in 
three-dimensions (3D) supported by extracellular matrices such as Matrigel Our goal was to analyze the feasibility of combining Matrigel-based 
3D cell culture with targeted metabolomics Hep G2 cells were seeded in varying densities into Matrigel Solidified Matrigel-cell complexes were 
covered with culture medium The cell complexes were harvested by scraping them in ice-cold extraction solvent consisting of 80% methanol and 
subsequently disrupted using bead-based homogenization After centrifugation, metabolites were analyzed with the Biocrates AbsoluteIDQTM 
p180 Kit 2D cultured cells and plain Matrigel samples were analyzed in parallel We observed significant ion suppression by Matrigel In addition, 
some metabolites, mostly lipids, showed higher concentrations in cell than in Matrigel samples Many amino acids and the hexoses were higher 
concentrated in Matrigel samples without cells, indicating diffusion of these metabolites from the culture medium into the matrix Our data 
demonstrate that targeted metabolomics with Matrigel supported 3D cell culture samples is possible However, due to the matrix, metabolites 
provided by culture media remain in the sample despite washing steps Thus, the extracellular matrix causes a major contamination and remains a 
challenge for metabolomics experiments

Feature-Based Molecular Networking of Non-targeted Mass Spectrometry Data: Bridging MS-DIAL, MZmine2, OpenMS,  
and XC-MS, with the GNPS web-platform

Molecular networking has become an essential bioinformatic tool to annotate non-targeted tandem mass spectrometry data (MS/MS) Available 
on the GNPS web-platform (http://gnpsucsdedu), molecular networking accelerates the annotation of molecular/spectral families by propagating 
spectral library matches across the networks Based on the MS-Cluster algorithm, molecular networking enables the large scale metabolomics 
meta-analysis, up to thousands of files However, as MS-Cluster uses the MS/MS spectral counts as a proxy for the ion distribution between 
samples, other methods are needed to estimate the relative ion abundance, especially when analysing a single study In the present work, 
we introduce feature-based molecular networking (FBMN), a collection of computational tools integrated together into a seamless LC-MS 
data processing pipeline combined with molecular networking on the GNPS web-platform (https://ccms-ucsdgithubio/GNPSDocumentation/
featurebasedmolecularnetworking/) Utilizing software with advanced graphical user interface (MS-DIAL, MZmine2, MetaboScape) or advanced 
computational libraries (OpenMS, and XC-MS), the workflows serves both experimentalists, bioinformaticians, and software developers We 
benchmarked FBMN on dilutions of the NIST serum samples, and results showed that it improves the estimation of ion relative distribution between 
samples, and reduced considerably the number of spectral artefacts These results were observed for both Orbitrap and QTOF instruments, and 
different sample types, indicating that FBMN has significant advantages over MS-Cluster based molecular networking Nonetheless, the FBMN is 
proposed to serve as a complementary tool to the “classical”, MS-Cluster-based molecular networking which is a robust and nearly parameterless 
method, and is the only method capable of performing large scale meta-analysis of non-targeted LC-MS/MS metabolomics datasets

A comparison of untargeted metabolomic methods applying 2.1 and 1.0 mm ID UHPLC columns for the study of  
mammalian metabolomes
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Annie Harwood-Stamper, University of Birmingham, United Kingdom
CO-AUTHORS: Lukàš Najdekr, Mark R. Viant, Caroline A. Rowland, Warwick B.Dunn
Untargeted ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) metabolomics has been successfully applied for the 
study of a wide variety of sample types Standard methods employ columns with 21mm internal diameters (ID) where sample volume is available in 
sufficient quantities However, if sample volumes are limited (<10µL), more sensitive analytical methods are required because of the requirements 
for sample dilution Previous research has shown that use of a smaller ID column provides the required increase in sensitivity for a limited number 
of sample types and complete characterization of sensitivity improvements has not been performed (Gray et al, 2016, Gray et al, 2015, Plumb et al, 
2004) Therefore, the aim of the study presented here was to determine the influence of column ID on sensitivity and volume of sample required by 
comparing 21mm ID column and 10mm ID column methods Human plasma and urine were prepared in serial dilutions and UHPLC columns of two 
different IDs (21 and 10mm) but with the same stationary phase composition and particle size were used to optimize the analysis Three different 
analytical assays were used: lipophilic reversed phase C18, aqueous end-capped reversed phase C18 for semi-polar metabolites and hydrophilic 
interaction chromatography (HILIC) for polar metabolites The 10mm methods were then applied to the analysis of mammalian tear samples which 
are available in volumes of <10µL Results show that following optimization, the 10mm ID methods are more sensitive than the 21mm ID methods for 
the same sample volume and are appropriate for untargeted mammalian tear analysis

A simple strategy to improve data quality in LC-MS-based metabolomics studies of human urine
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Adriana Nori de Macedo, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Brazil

An important challenge in metabolomics when using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is the variation of signal intensity during 
sample analysis, due to accumulation of sample components in the column and front parts of the MS system Herein, we suggest simple changes 
to improve data quality in LC-MS-based metabolomics, which were tested for urine samples (n=176) from renal transplant patients These changes 
include the use of a divert valve to direct the column effluent to waste at the beginning of the chromatographic separation (00-08 min) and during 
column cleanup and equilibration (120-200 min), combined with a longer column cleanup between injections (60 min at 06 mL/min, instead of 
10 min at 04 mL/min) The method was tested before and after introducing these modifications by analyzing individual urine samples, quality 
controls (QCs), blanks, and calibrant solutions using an UPLC (Waters) and QExactive (Thermo), along with Skyline for data monitoring QCs showed 
great improvement in peak area repeatability, with relative standard deviations (RSDs) of selected metabolites going from ~60% to ~10% as the 
divert valve and longer column cleanup were introduced Similarly, RSDs of peak areas for internal standards spiked into individual urine samples 
improved from ~40% to ~10% Moreover, calibrant solutions injected firstly and lastly in the analytical sequence had more comparable signals after 
introducing the modifications Therefore, in addition to current protocols of preventative maintenance prior to sample analysis, we recommend the 
use of a divert valve and extended column cleanup as simple modifications to improve data quality in metabolomics studies

High-throughput Targeted Lipidomics Analysis of Dihydroceramide Desaturase-1 (DES1) Knockout Mice
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Mackenzie Pearson, SCIEX, United States
CO-AUTHORS: Santosh Kapil Kumar Gorti, Trevor S. Tippetts, Scott A. Summers
Amide column chemistry was chosen for lipid class separation and minimize isomeric interference The target list of lipids is comprehensive, 
covering most major lipid classes and categories, and MRMs were selected to cover lipids containing fatty acids with 14 to 22 carbons and 0 to 6 
double bonds The method is customizable, so new lipid categories, classes and molecular species can be added to the MRMs list This method 
provides quantitative measurement of over 1150 different lipid molecular species in a rapid, highly reproducible manner The sMRM Pro Builder 
template which was developed to streamline the method optimization process, enables assigning the retention time, optimize dwell weight and set 
window size per MRM to enhanced coverage and sensitivity of the method This optimization improved results quality especially on low abundant 
lipids Liver and eWAT tissues were harvested from dihydroceramide desaturase-1 (DES1) knockout mice DES1 is the enzyme responsible for 
inserting the 4,5-trans-double bond into the sphingolipid backbone causing the dihydroceramide conversion to ceramide While both of these 
classes of lipids are lower in abundance in the chosen tissues, this method shows significant changes in these lipid classes in a quantitative manner 
However, lipids from another 17 classes were not changing Lipid standards from 19 different classes, which are either heavy isotopic labeled lipids 
or odd chain lipids, served as internal standard This method provided extensive lipid class coverages including, CE, CER, DCER, HCER, LCER, TAG, 
DAG, MAG, LPC, PC, LPE, PE, LPG, PG, LPI, PI, LPS and PS

A novel approach of untargeted plant secondary metabolic profiling and its application to studying resistance-related 
metabolites in maize
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Zaifang Li, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China

Secondary metabolites are the end products of complex metabolic pathways in plants They are widely involved in physiological processes such 
as growth, development, and defense Plants fight against biotic and abiotic stress by synthesizing and releasing defensive secondary metabolites 
However, comprehensive identifications of secondary metabolites are difficult because of plant chemical diversity, highly species/tissue-specific 
and time-dependent accumulations It is necessary to develop a comprehensive analytical method for secondary metabolites In this study, a novel 
metabolic profiling method based on ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography−high-resolution mass spectrometry was established and applied 
to investigate secondary metabolites of maize A high coverage MS/MS acquisition method was developed by a segmented scan Then, a multi-
informational molecular network was constructed for comprehensive identification of secondary metabolites in maize The secondary metabolites 
composition of maize leaves, silk and seeds were investigated using the developed method A tissue-specific accumulation of secondary metabolites 
was observed Herbivore-induced alterations in secondary metabolites of maize silk were studied We found that a great variation was observed on 
the secondary metabolism of maize silk after insect attack The insect-resistant metabolites, benzoxazinones, phytoalexins belonging to terpenes (KB1, 
KA2, KA3, ZB1 and dolabradiene, etc), hydroxycinnamic acid amides and its precursor cinnamic acids were significantly accumulated in maize silk 
While flavonoids and its flavonoid phytoalexins (maysin) were significantly decreased after the attack These results show the developed untargeted 
metabolic profiling method is very useful for novel insights into secondary metabolites defense in crops

Deeper Level of Comprehensive Metabolite Quantitation with Data Independent Acquisition
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Baljit Ubhi, SCIEX, United States
CO-AUTHORS: Zuzana Demianova
The major challenge in the field of metabolomics is to accurately identify and quantify hundreds of metabolites in a single run Recently variable 
window SWATH acquisition has shown to identify a higher number of metabolites compared to the traditional Data Dependent Acquisition (DDA) 
approach, thus enabling broader metabolome coverage Here we have implemented a variable window SWATH acquisition method for enhanced 
quantitation of selected metabolites using MS/MS, with reduced matrix interferences and improved signal-to-noise Using MS/MS fragments for 
metabolite quantitation provides better selectivity, and ultimately increased sensitivity Variable window SWATH Acquisition provided quality 
quantitative data for metabolites in complex matrix Due to many coeluting metabolites in complex matrix, using only the MS spectrum and retention 
time is often not sufficient for metabolite identification MS/MS information is necessary to obtain further structural knowledge about the metabolite 
Complete full scan MS and MS/MS data is available in every SWATH file for improved ID In addition, MS/MS quantitation of metabolites often leads 
to lower detection limits due to significantly improved signal to noise ratios vs MS data Measuring the whole MS/MS spectrum allows selection of 
the best fragments for metabolite quantitation SCIEX OS software combines comprehensive qualitative and quantitative data analysis, making data 
processing easier and more efficient SWATH Acquisition on all detectable metabolites is successfully utilized for identification, and accurate MS/MS 
level quantification of metabolites in urine

Automated High-Throughput Flux Analysis of Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma Cells Grown in vitro in Two and  
Three Dimensions
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Agnes Corbin, Nonlinear Dynamics/Waters SAS, France
CO-AUTHORS: Abhishek Jha, Raghav Sehgal, Johannes PC Vissers, Amrita Cheema
Cell lines are widely used to study disease and treatment Monolayer (2D) cell cultures are commonly used for this purpose The geometry of these 
cell cultures is however believed to be inadequate to recreate the growth environment of cells Spheroid (3D) cell cultures are considered to be 
more viable in vitro alternatives since they better mimic the in vivo conditions The different outcomes from 2D and 3D culture studies can therefore 
have a significant impact on the relevance of experimental findings H1299 cells were grown as 2D monolayers in Eagle’s media, and to generate 
3D spheroids, cells were grown in 2% pHEMA dissolved in ethanol Following sample preparation, the samples were injected onto an LC-oaToF-
MS system Next, the LC-MS fluxomics data were processed with an informatics pipeline that consists of data transfer, data conversion into open 
source standards, and import of the converted data for peak detection, curation, natural abundance correction and visualization The analysis of the 
human non-small cell lung carcinoma cells flux data indicated that the lactate fractional enrichment of the 13C3 isotopologue is significantly higher 
in spheroid vs monolayer cell cultures Since 13C3-lactate is the major isotopologue produced from 13C6-glucose, the observations suggest that 
glycolysis is significantly upregulated in spheroid cell cultures Moreover, key intermediates in the TCA cycle had higher 13C2 isotopologues In turn, 
synthesis of pyruvate 13C3 isotopologues can be attributed to 13C6-glucose, suggesting a higher contribution of glucose to the TCA cycle via acetyl 
CoA in spheroid cell cultures

Meta-analysis of tracer-biotransformation experiments of exogenic and endogenic isotopically-labeled tracer compounds  
with LC-HRMS and MetExtract II
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Christoph Bueschl, IFA-Tulln, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences BOKU, Vienna, Austria
CO-AUTHORS: Bernhard Kluger, Maria Doppler, Jacqueline Meng-Reiterer, Asja Ceranic, Rainer Schuhmacher, Rudof Krska
Tracer-based metabolomics studies have become more popular with the increased availability of isotopically-labeled tracers By spiking a 
biological organism (eg plants, fungi, mammals) with these labeled tracers, virtually all biotransformation-products can be detected that are 
newly synthesized under the tested experimental conditions A powerful workflow for the detection of biotransformation-products from secondary 
metabolism reactions of either endogenous or exogenous tracers, is the TracExtract workflow It combines LC-HRMS with the custom-tailored 
software MetExtract-II for the fully automated and untargeted detection of novel biotransformation-products In this work, the results of several 
such studies are summarized Mainly 13C-labeled tracers were studied with the TracExtract workflow (eg the mycotoxins deoxynivalenol, T2/
HT2 and zearalenone in wheat ears, tryptophan and phenylalanine in wheat and grapes, methylation artifacts during sample preparation, glucose 
for the detection of RNA-modifications) For example, 172 biotransformation-products of phenylalanine in wheat plants infected with Fusarium 
graminearum, more than 50 novel detoxification products of mycotoxins in different cereal plants, and 88 sampling artifacts of methanol were 
successfully detected The number of identified metabolites varied greatly (10-172) depending on the studied tracers No modifications of the 
general workflow or LC-HRMS setup were required for the majority of the performed experiments The automated, untargeted search for novel 
biotransformation products was very specific in all experiments and resulted in only few (1-5) false-positives on average The results demonstrate 
that isotopically-labeled tracers and the developed workflow are generic, highly specific and can be applied to virtually any isotopically-labeled 
tracer as there is no need for complicated experimental setups

Comparison of Methanol, Acetonitrile and Ethanol with Respect to Solvent-Induced Artifact Formation in Biological Samples
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Bernhard Seidl, IFA-Tulln, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna (BOKU), Austria
CO-AUTHORS: Christoph Bueschl, Michael Sulyok, Rainer Schuhmacher
Organic solvents play a critical role in metabolomics experiments They are usually indispensable for extraction or separation of metabolites from 
biological matrices Ideally, the solvent should behave in an inert state and in no way alter the metabolites to be analyzed While, it has already 
been shown that the extraction of plant material with methanol resulted in the formation of numerous solvent-induced artifacts (Sauerschnig et al, 
2017), no studies on other common solvents have been published so far Here, we have used a similar approach to investigate and compare artifact 
formation by acetonitrile, ethanol and methanol To this end, the filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei was cultivated in synthetic minimal liquid 
medium and both the culture media supernatant and the fungal mycelium were extracted separately with each of the three solvents In each case, 
the native and deuterated form of the solvent was used in parallel The experiment was also performed on fully labeled 13C samples to be able to 
unambiguously classify metabolites to be of biological origin and on a defined standard mix The samples were measured by LC-HRMS and the 
respective measurement data was then searched for coeluting feature pairs with identical peak shape and whose m/z values differed by exactly a 
multiple of the mass increment between 1H and 2H Similar to Sauerschnig et al (2017), numerous artifacts induced by methanol were found The 
poster will demonstrate that ethanol- and acetonitrile-derived extracts did also contain solvent-induced artifacts, albeit to a much lesser extent than 
in case of methanol

Investigating metabolic flux in central metabolic pathways associated with isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutations  
using [1,2-13C2]Glucose
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Areesha Nazeer, University of Oxford, UK, United Kingdom
CO-AUTHORS: John Walsby-Tickle, Edward Smith, David Hauton, James S.O. McCullagh
Isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations are found in a range of cancers including glioma and amyloid leukaemia and produce a change of enzyme 
function leading to the production of significant amounts of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), a metabolite that has now become one of the best known 
small molecule biomarkers in cancer The mechanism of tumorigenesis is still not fully understood however A number of metabolomics studies have 
investigated changes in metabolite profiles but few have investigated the impact of the mutation on metabolic flux In this study [1,2-13C2] glucose 
was used as a tracer to quantify metabolic flux in LN18 IDH mutant (IDH1) and IDH wild type cells Anion-chromatography coupled to a Q-exactive 
orbitrap MS system was used to measure glycolytic, pentose phosphate pathway and TCA cycle metabolites and concomitant isotopomer 
distributions INCA was then used to calculate flux values for each metabolic transformation by minimizing the difference between the measured 
labelling patterns and those simulated by the metabolic model with 95% confidence intervals LN18 mutant cells show altered flux through central 
metabolic pathways, a high flux from α-ketoglutarate to 2-hydroxglutrate with a decreased flux from α-ketoglutarate to succinate, fumarate and 
malate indicated decreased oxidation of glucose in the TCA cycle compared to LN18 wild type cells A decreased flux through PDH and an increased 
flux from pyruvate to lactate through LDH suggested that IDH1 mutant cells undergo broader metabolic reprogramming than has previously been 
reported It is anticipated these metabolic alterations in mutant IDH1 cells will help identify potential new therapeutic targets

Tracer-based metabolomics for Immune Cells: Exploring Central Carbon Metabolism in Human Natural Killer Cells
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Doriane Lorendeau, Janssen R&D, Belgium
CO-AUTHORS: Liesbeth Vereyken, Ian Strickland, Rob J. Vreeken
While immunotherapy is emerging as a successful alternative approach to classical drug therapy for many disease areas, such as cancer and chronic 
infectious diseases, still little is known about the fine-tuning between metabolism and functions of immune cells in health and disease states 
Notably, central carbon metabolism, as a central metabolic pathway providing energy, cellular building blocks and precursors for cell signaling 
and epigenetic factors, is of key interest to understand the major metabolic routes sustaining immune cells functions To quantify central carbon 
metabolites and determine the relative contribution of specific metabolic pathways (ie intracellular metabolic fluxes), we established a tracer-based 
metabolomic platform using stable isotopes together with metabolic network modeling At first, we established in vitro immune cell line models 
Specifically, human lymphoma NK-92 and leukemia KHYG-1 natural killer cells were fed with 13C6-glucose for 24h, to reach isotopic steady state 
prior to metabolite extraction To monitor the major branching routes of central carbon metabolism, including glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, 
pentose-phosphate pathways, we developed a general analytical method for small molecules-amino acids and -organic acids, using an UPLC HILIC 
column system for separation coupled with a Q-Exactive HF orbitrap mass spectrometer First experiments demonstrated incorporation of the 
13C isotope label into downstream metabolites of glucose Next, this platform will be further validated by dissecting the various metabolic modes 
associated with different activation or inhibitory stimuli on NK cells in vitro and finally on (pre-)clinical samples of chronic infectious diseases (eg 
Hepatitis B, HIV…)

Glutamine and nitrogen metabolism in cancer
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Susanne Fürst, BIMSB, MDC, DKFZ, DKTK, Germany
CO-AUTHORS: Safak Bayram, Guido Mastrobuoni, Christin Zasada, Stefan Kempa
Metabolic reprogramming is a required step during oncogenesis It is triggered by activation of oncogenes and loss of tumor suppressors and leads 
to an activation of central metabolic pathways to support cell growth and proliferation Already in the 1920th Otto Warburg identified glycolysis as 
deregulated in cancer These findings highlighted central metabolism as therapeutic target Beside the activation of the glycolytic pathway also 
nitrogen metabolism is enhanced in order to support the de-novo biosynthesis of nucleotides as building blocks of DNA and RNA synthesis The 
required nitrogen can stem from amino acids like glutamine or alanine or from free ammonium In order to quantify the usage and activity of metabolic 
pathways in vitro and in vivo we have developed pulsed stable isotope resolved metabolomics (pSIRM) The applied GC-MS based technology 
enables the absolute quantification of metabolites and at the same time the determination of stable isotope incorporation In a next step to quantify the 
dynamics of nitrogen and carbon metabolism simultaneously we are developing new methods by applying ultra high resolution mass spectrometry 
With the new technology we hope to better characterize the metabolic mode of cancer cells and to identify suitable therapeutic targets
