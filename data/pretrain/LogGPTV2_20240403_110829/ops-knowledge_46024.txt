To effectively implement CIS Control 4.3, which involves configuring automatic session locking on enterprise assets, an organization should follow these key procedures:

1. **Define Inactivity Periods:**
   - For general-purpose operating systems (such as desktops and laptops), set the inactivity period to no more than 15 minutes.
   - For mobile end-user devices (such as smartphones and tablets), set the inactivity period to no more than 2 minutes.

2. **Implement Automatic Session Locking:**
   - Configure the system settings to automatically lock sessions after the defined period of inactivity. This can typically be done through group policies or device management tools, depending on the type of asset.

3. **Verify Configuration:**
   - Ensure that the automatic session locking settings are correctly applied and functioning as intended. This may involve testing on a sample of devices and verifying that the sessions lock as expected.

4. **Document and Communicate:**
   - Document the configuration settings and the rationale behind the chosen inactivity periods. Communicate these policies and procedures to all relevant users and stakeholders within the organization.

**Additional Information:**
- **Asset Type:** Users
- **Security Function:** Protect

By following these steps, the organization can enhance its security posture by ensuring that unattended sessions are locked, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
