User: Web servers in a certain network are subjected to a large number of DDoS attacks every day, and you need to come up with some preventive measures, including hardware and software.
Assistant: Hardware precautions: 1. Use intrusion detection systems (IDS) and firewalls to monitor and intercept attack requests in network traffic. 2. Use a load balancer to share network traffic and prevent web servers from being attacked by a single point. 3. Configure and use traffic cleaning equipment to reduce the load on the web server by filtering malicious requests. Software precautions: 1. Regularly update server software patches and operating systems to ensure that security holes and weaknesses are patched in time. 2. Use network security software (such as anti-virus software, malware scanners, etc.) to monitor and prevent servers in real time. 3. Restrict access to the server, only allow authorized IP addresses and users to access, and prevent unauthorized users from attacking. 4. Implement key management and authentication measures, such as HTTPS, SSL and other protocols to ensure the security of network communication.
