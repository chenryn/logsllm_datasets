I am relatively new to Google App Engine (GAE), web development, and Python, but I am actively learning and improving my skills. For some time now, I have been attempting to integrate xhtml2pdf into a GAE project, but I have not had any success. Despite downloading various packages and trying different versions of these packages and their dependencies, I keep encountering errors related to missing modules. Even when using the "required dependency" versions specified for xhtml2pdf, the issues persist.

According to a Stack Overflow post from 2010, xhtml2pdf was once compatible with GAE, but I am unsure if this is still the case. It's possible that the GAE team has since recommended or implemented an alternative solution that they consider more suitable.

Additionally, I suspect that my `app.yaml` file might be preventing the application from running correctly. Whenever I attempt to import the `pisa` module, my application fails to start.

Could anyone provide guidance on how to successfully set up xhtml2pdf within a GAE project? Specifically, I would appreciate advice on:
- How to properly install the necessary packages and their dependencies.
- The correct placement of these packages within my project directory (please note that I am working on a Windows system).
- Any required settings or configurations that should be added to my `app.yaml` file.

Update: I have found a solution. Instead of using xhtml2pdf, I recommend using ReportLab on its own.
