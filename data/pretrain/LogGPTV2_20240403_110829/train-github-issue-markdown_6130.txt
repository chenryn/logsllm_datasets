Hi all,
I've got some problems with the intl component.
I have a form where the user can pick a date and a time, but when the time is
"cast" in the controller, the hours is two hours back. For example if i pick
10:10 in the form i will have 08:10 in my controller.
Please take a look at my post (it's french but the important think are the
code and the profiler view)

timezone?page=1#message-91356928
Setting Europe/Zurich in the php.ini doesn't resolve the bug (and the default
timezone is set to Europe/Zurich as we can see).
Removing the intl component fix the bug, so i think i'm missing some
configuration at one moment
Thanks in advance for your help :)
