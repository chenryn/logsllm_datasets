Subject: Issue with Timezone in Intl Component

Hello Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am currently experiencing an issue with the `intl` component in my application and would appreciate your assistance.

### Problem Description
In my form, users can select both a date and a time. However, when the selected time is processed in the controller, it is being offset by two hours. For example, if a user selects 10:10, the controller receives 08:10.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. User selects a time (e.g., 10:10) in the form.
2. The form submits the data to the controller.
3. The controller processes the time, but it is incorrectly set to 08:10.

### Additional Information
- Setting the timezone to `Europe/Zurich` in the `php.ini` file does not resolve the issue.
- The default timezone is already set to `Europe/Zurich`.
- Removing the `intl` component fixes the problem, which suggests that there might be a configuration issue related to the `intl` component.
