Major Initiatives: 
• 700 MHz projects that has linked Bannock and Ada counties. 
• To support the Governor's State Executive Interoperability Council and to 
purchase equipment to enhance interoperable communications as well as 
additional IC planning and design efforts. 
• Purchase equipment to enhance capabilities to respond to CBRNE events. 
• The Idaho State Communications Center is the primary dispatch facility for 
the State of Idaho. The center provides communication services for police, fire, 
emergency medical services, hazardous materials response and numerous other life safety 
services throughout the state of Idaho. The building and the area surrounding the complex 
has significant security 
vulnerabilities, and 
funding is required to 
harden the facility, and 
mitigate the 
vulnerabilities to the 
center.

Background 
The Communications Committee of the Illinois Terrorism 
Task Force (ITTF) has the responsibility for developing 
solutions to communications interoperability for all of the 
state’s emergency response organizations and developing an 
infrastructure that supports that interoperability.  The focus 
of the Communications Committee remains committed toward the development and 
maintenance of an all-hazards approach. 
Major Accomplishments (2005-2006) 
Statewide Warning and Alerting Systems 
 Phase III of the statewide EMnet installation was completed in February 2006.  EMnet is 
a satellite-based data system capable of receiving simultaneous, authenticated text 
messages from the State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC).  EMnet terminals were 
installed in all county 
warning points, regional 
hospital command 
centers, and key state 
agencies. 
 Phase IV of the EMnet 
system, involving the 
installation of terminals 
in nineteen broadcast 
radio stations responsible 
for activation of the 
Emergency Alert System 
(EAS), is near

completion. Additionally, EAS activation software and related equipment has been sent 
to each of the 102 counties and Chicago. Training courses for county emergency 
managers regarding the development of EAS plans are ongoing. 
 System surveys for Phase V, the installation of EMnet in 9-1-1 centers statewide, have 
been completed and equipment installation is scheduled for 2006. 
Incident Scene Management and Interoperability 
 Accepted delivery of nine regional communications suites, known as the Illinois 
Transportable Emergency Communications System (ITECS). A tenth ITECS suite is 
being assigned to the Illinois Emergency Management Agency. 
Installation of electronics into the trailers continues, with project completion scheduled 
for August 2006. 
 Ordered mobile interoperable radios that are designed to enhance or develop system 
interoperability on various levels.  This includes VHF interoperability.  The radios were 
ordered and distributed by the corresponding statewide mutual aid organization – IESMA 
(EMA), MABAS (fire), and ILEAS (police). 
 In cooperation with the statewide law enforcement mutual aid system (ILEAS), funded 
the purchase of interoperable communications to be installed in the 13 Mobile Command 
vehicles that will be deployed statewide. 11 of 13 vehicles have been delivered as of 
February 2006. 
Infrastructure to Support Interoperable Scene Communications 
 Ordered equipment for the Medical Emergency Radio System of Illinois (MERCI) – a 
base station system, provided to every hospital statewide, designed to support Emergency 
Medical System (EMS) interoperability. 
 Began installation of STARCOM21 800 MHz radios at public safety agencies throughout 
the state. Radios were offered to every police, fire, emergency management, public health 
and other public safety agencies.  The radios provide an interoperable communications 
link to the SEOC and are the same statewide radio system that Illinois State Police will be 
switching to in the fall of 2006.  
 Established the Illinois Radio Emergency Assistance Channel (IREACH), which is a 
mobile and portable system.  Equipment was provided to public health agencies 
statewide, designed to improve interoperability between first responders and public 
health agencies.

Current Interoperable Communications Initiatives 
Project Hoosier SAFE-T (Safety Acting for Everyone - Together) is an innovative 
approach in the development of a statewide 800 MHz interoperable, wireless 
public safety communication system for Indiana local, state, and federal first 
responders and public safety officials.  SAFE-T is a major undertaking, reaching 
across the entire state with 126 communication sites.  To date, with 91 
communication sites completed, approximately 80% of the state of Indiana is 
covered at 95% reliability and includes 69 of the 92 counties and approximately 
20,000 users.  This includes first responders in 55 counties, 16 state agencies 
(including 2500 state Department of Transportation workers and 2500 Corrections Officers); and 
three federal agencies.  Project Hoosier SAFE-T is building and maintaining the system 
backbone: towers, antennas, shelters, generators, transmitters, base stations, cabling and 
frequencies. Participating agencies provide their own user equipment, including dispatch 
consoles, radios and computers, which they can buy at a 20-25% discount through the state. 
Participation is voluntary and agencies pay no user fees. The goal is to make interoperable 
communications affordable and available for every community. The system is scheduled for 
completion in 2007. 
Indiana was able to leverage 
partial funding for this project 
through an existing small fee 
attached to vehicle registrations.  
These funds were being used by 
the state for information 
technology projects and a portion 
of the proceeds were re-directed 
to interoperable communications.

with federal dollars and local partnerships, will allow the state to complete their project 3 months 
early and $12 million under budget.  In addition to forging statewide interoperable 
communications, Indiana spurred the creation of the Midwest Public Safety Communication 
Coalition (MPSCC), an alliance with Michigan, Illinois, Kentucky and Ohio, dedicated to 
creating regional interoperability between these neighboring states.

Current Interoperable Communications Initiatives 
One of the biggest interoperable communications initiatives in Iowa is 
an interoperable voice, data and video system for command 
operations.  The primary driver behind this project is the development 
of real-time information sharing between EOCs in the region; this 
system will not only allow voice interoperability, but is expanded to 
include data and video communications.  This is being done in 
Region 5 of the state, which includes 17 counties in southeast Iowa.  The state is looking at the 
technology behind this system and exploring the possibility of expanding it to the other five 
regions in the state. 
Another interoperable communications initiative is a statewide communications plan.  This is 
similar to the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP) as required in the FY05 grant 
guidance; however, the state is expanding that plan for statewide implementation to include not 
only voice interoperability but also data and video communications.  The governance structure of 
this plan is currently in development. 
 Iowa received a $6 million 
grant from DHS/ICE to 
implement the Tri-State 
Homeland Security First 
Responder Communications 
Interoperability project.  This 
project allows the use of 
equipment and technologies to 
increase interoperability within
