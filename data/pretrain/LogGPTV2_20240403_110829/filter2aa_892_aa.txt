Brief history of telephone switching
● Manual cordboards
– Labor-intensive
● Step / Panel / Crossbar
– Electromechanical
– Simple and effective, but limited in function
– Expensive to maintain
● No. 1 / 1AESS
– Electronically-controlled analog switching
– Much wider array of services available
– More flexibility than electromechanical switches
– Some still in use today in North America
Brief history of telephone switching
● 4 ESS / 5 ESS / DMS
– Digital time-division switching
– Greatly increased flexibility and array of services
– Much cheaper to maintain than previous systems
– Huge and expensive
Part I:
Asterisk Overview
(or... what the &$#%@ is this thing?)
What is Asterisk?
● Free, open-source PBX that runs on Linux
– Best thing since sliced bread
● Originally written by Mark Spencer
– Now has a large number of contributors
Why Asterisk?
● It's FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!
– How much are you paying your PBX vendor now?
● Runs on commodity PC hardware
● Broad support for VoIP protocols and hardware
● Easy to interconnect with other boxes
– Form your own VoIP network
● Configurable to do (almost) whatever you want
– Tweak it to your needs
– Write your own code 
– It will still not do your dishes, unfortunately
Asterisk and Hardware
Asterisk Hardware Requirements
● Will run on surprisingly out-of-date hardware
– 133MHz Pentium I w/16MB RAM
● supports 3 concurrent SIP calls before quality degrades
● Any PC you have lying around will work
– 2.4 GHz P4 w/512 MB RAM
● 790 simultaneous calls

Interconnecting Asterisk:
Signaling Protocols
Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
● Signaling protocol only
– Actual media transport handled by RTP
● Protocol developed by IETF, not ITU-T
– Uses URLs instead of telephone numbers
● sip:PI:EMAIL
● Intended to be a peer-to-peer protocol
● Fairly ubiquitous
– Most VoIP phones, terminal adapters, etc speak SIP
– Used by Vonage, Packet8, Broadvoice, etc
● Does not play well with NAT
H.323
● Developed in 1996 by ITU-T
● Far more similar to traditional telephony signaling 
protocols than SIP
● Uses RTP for media transport
● Used internally by interexchange carriers
● Fairly unpopular in the do-it-yourself VoIP world
– Difficult to implement in software
– Major pain in the ass to get working correctly
“Just don't use H.323 and all your problems will be solved”
- JerJer on #asterisk
Inter-Asterisk EXchange (IAX)
● Developed by Mark Spencer of Digium
● Covers both signaling and media transport
– Streamlined, simple protocol
● Does not suffer from NAT traversal issues
– Data and signaling happen via UDP on port 4569
● Well-supported by Asterisk
● Support in terminal equipment is rare
– Digium IAXy terminal adapter speaks IAX
● Preferred protocol for many PSTN termination 
providers
Other protocols
● Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP)
● Cisco's Skinny Client Control Protocol (SCCP)

Digital Audio Basics – (A)DPCM
● Differential Pulse Code Modulation
– Uses four bits to describe the change from the last 
sample, regardless of original source resolution
● Adaptive Differential PCM
– Uses a varying number of bits depending on the 
complexity of the sample
Digital Audio Basics – LPC
● Linear Predictive Coding
● Uses vocoders to compress speech
– Vocoders are also used to create the “singing 
synthesizer” effect in some modern music
Voice on the PSTN
● 64 kilobit per second synchronous bandwidth for 
wireline telephones
– µ-law companding in North America
– a-law companding in the rest of the world
– 56 kilobits per second if doing in-band supervision 
signaling on a DS0 (i.e. bit-robbing)
● 4 to 13 kilobit per second synchronous bandwidth 
for mobile phones
– All sorts of crazy audio codecs
– Sounds like crap
Costs of speech compression
● Increased CPU power required for transcoding
● No guarantee that two pieces of equipment will 
speak the same codecs
– Especially true if using nonstandard bitrates
● Some codecs require LICEN$ING
● Codecs do not handle all kinds of sounds well
– People will have trouble understanding certain words
– Difficult to understand anyone who has poor diction
– Music on hold in codec land is pure torture
● Be like Oedipus!  Gouge your eyes out!
Benefits of speech compression
● Each call uses less bandwidth
Codecs supported by Asterisk
● G.711
– 64kbps µ-law or a-law companding
● G.726
– 32kbps Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation
● G.729
– 8kbps Conjugate-Structure Algebraic Code-Excited 
Linear Prediction
– Requires a license
● GSM
– 13kbps Regular Pulse Excitation Long-Term Prediction
Codecs supported by Asterisk
● Internet Low Bandwidth Codec (iLBC)
– 13.3kbps Linear Predictive Coding
– This is the codec used by Skype
● Speex
– 13.3kbps Code-Excited Linear Prediction
– Open Source codec
● LPC10
– 2.4kbps Linear Predictive Coding
– Sounds more ghastly than you can possibly imagine

Network Design
ENUM / E.164
● Based on DNS
● Allows any number to be queried
– If it exists, you can bypass the PSTN saving money.
● Designed by the ITU
● Officially 'supposed' to be used by Telcos
– e164.org – Free DIY solution
● Over 350,000 Numbers on record
● 78,000,000 Special PSTN services (800 numbers, etc)
How ENUM Works
ENUM problems
● A very 'top-down' way of doing lookup
– Centrally managed
– Centrally served
– Centrally centralized
● Not in use by any(?) PSTN providers
– Why should they save YOU money?
● Nowhere near critical mass yet
DUNDi - Distributed Universal 
Number Discovery
● Designed by the good folks at Digium
– Therefore, it has to be good
● A fully peer-to-peer E.164 solution
● Easily set up your own telephone network with 
friends
● DIY alternative to waiting for your telephone 
company to implement E.164
How DUNDi works
http://www.dundi.com/dundi-e164-big.png
DUNDi Problems
● Requires everyone to be honest
– Hey Hey! I'm the white house!
● Scalability
● Not officially a standard (yet)
● Only in CVS HEAD version of asterisk
● The 'i' looks silly at the end.
Quality of Service
● Ensure that calls receive enough bandwidth and 
low latency
– Priority Queueing
– Bandwidth Shaping
● Many residential routers are now VoIP-aware and 
will do a decent job out-of-the-box
● Tweak a Cisco router to do this on a large scale or 
if you're a control freak
