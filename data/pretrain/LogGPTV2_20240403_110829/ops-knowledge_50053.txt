Assistant: This log chunk shows multiple connections from the same IP address (202.82.200.188) to the ftpd software component at the same time (Fri Jul 1 07:57:30 2005). It also shows multiple sessions opened and closed for the user 'test' by the sshd(pam_unix) software component. Lastly, it shows two authentication failures for the user 'root' from the IP address 195.129.24.210.
