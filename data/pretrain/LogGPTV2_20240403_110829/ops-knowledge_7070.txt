User: I would periodically like to delete the contents of a Windows directory which includes files and sub directories that contain more files.  However I do not there is one specific file that I do not want to remove (it is the same file every time). I am using shutil.rmtree to delete the contents of a folder but I am deleting the file I wish to keep also. How would I make an exception preventing the removal of the file I would like to keep and is shutil the best method for this?
Assistant: rmtree does not appear to have any kind of filtering mechanism that you could use; further, since part of its functionality is to remove the directory itself, and not just its contents, it wouldn't make sense to.
If you could do something to the file so that rmtree's attempt to delete it fails, you can have rmtree ignore such errors, thus leaving your file but deleting the others.  If you cannot, you could resort to os.walk to loop over the contents of your directory, and thus decide which items to remove for yourself.
