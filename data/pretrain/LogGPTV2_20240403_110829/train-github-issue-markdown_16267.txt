Eval_const_expr is used in the front end in several places. This code quasi-
duplicates stuff that trans should probably be doing (in Graydon's words).
Any evaluation of compile-time values should likely be moved to a pass
somewhere in the middle end. I assume there is a way to get a compile-time
value out of LLVM, but I'm not sure.
