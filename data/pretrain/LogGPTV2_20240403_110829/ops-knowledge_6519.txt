User: Please provide a reliable system monitoring solution for real-time monitoring of server CPU, memory, disk and network usage, so as to discover and solve performance bottlenecks in time.
Assistant: A solid system monitoring solution can use the following tools and technologies: 1. Nagios or Zabbix: These are open source network monitoring tools that monitor system performance and network traffic and send alerts to administrators. 2. Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) or Collectd: These are system performance monitoring tools that can diagnose performance bottlenecks. 3. Graphite and Grafana: These tools are used to track performance data and visualize it to help administrators make better decisions. 4. SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol): This protocol allows administrators to remotely monitor and control devices in the network. The system monitoring solution using these tools can monitor the CPU, memory, disk and network of the server in real time. Administrators can easily diagnose performance bottlenecks and take timely action.
