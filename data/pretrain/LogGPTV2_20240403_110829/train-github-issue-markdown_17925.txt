In the same vein as #1107, it would be super useful (at least to me) to have
the openapi models be available outside of FastAPI. I've been working on a
Python client generator (built with Typer!) which will hopefully be much
cleaner than the openapi-generator version, and I already use FastAPI for some
testing.
I don't want to ship a copy of FastAPI with my tool just to get the openapi
module, but it also feels silly to be rewriting a lot of what you already have
when I could just parse a spec into your models and work from there. So what
I'll probably do is extract a copy of the openapi module and use it (with
proper attribution of course), but it would be much cleaner to add your module
as a pip dependency.
https://github.com/triaxtec/openapi-python-client is the project in question,
just FYI.
