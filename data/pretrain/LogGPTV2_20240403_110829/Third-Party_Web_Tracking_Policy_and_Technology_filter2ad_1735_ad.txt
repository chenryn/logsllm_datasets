### My Opt-Outs: Balancing Usability and Privacy

My opt-out mechanisms, while effective in mitigating privacy issues, often come at the cost of usability.

#### AdChoices Icon and User Awareness

Many online advertising companies have started to incorporate an "AdChoices" icon (13x13px) and accompanying text (10pt) into display ads (Figure 2(b)). This initiative aims to enhance user awareness about behavioral targeting and the self-regulatory choice mechanisms available. Clicking the icon provides users with additional information on how the ad was targeted and, in many cases, a link to a landing page where they can set opt-out cookies.

However, several studies have questioned the effectiveness of the self-regulatory opt-out model. Before the deployment of the AdChoices icon, an industry-funded policy group conducted a large-scale usability survey [106]. The study found that a 31x31px icon with 18pt font (Figure 3(a)) was not very effective in conveying information about behavioral targeting practices. It concluded that substantial repetition and consumer education might be necessary to improve the icon's communication effectiveness over time. Additionally, the text "AdChoice" performed worse than alternative options.

McDonald and Cranor [34] conducted a large-audience survey on user perceptions of a self-regulatory opt-out page. While 88% of participants understood that the page related to online advertising and opting out, only 11% correctly identified that the page allows opting out of behavioral targeting, as opposed to tracking (34%), ads from specific companies (25%), or some proportion of advertising (18%).

Leon et al. [107] examined the usability of two other self-regulatory websites with five in-laboratory participants each. On the Digital Advertising Alliance website, only one of the five users could opt out without guidance, and none correctly understood the implications of opting out. On the Evidon website, four out of five users managed to opt out without assistance, but it took one participant 47 minutes to opt out of all companies. None of the users fully grasped what opting out would do.

#### Prevalence and Usage of AdChoices

Hernandez et al. [105] measured the prevalence of the AdChoices program on the Alexa U.S. top 500 homepages. They found the icon in only 9.9% of third-party ads and both the icon and text in just 5.1%. Online advertising trade groups have declined to provide overall usage statistics for opt-out cookies, but anecdotal reports (e.g., [108]) suggest usage is less than 1% of browsers.

#### Blocking as a Solution

Given the various methods of tracking a browser, the most effective user self-help tools function by blocking third-party web content. These tools typically consist of a block list, either available as a subscription for a browser extension or integrated into a configurable browser extension.

To evaluate the effectiveness of blocking, we conducted three consecutive FourthParty crawls of the Alexa U.S. top 500 sites with each of 11 blocking tools installed [110]. We also conducted a baseline crawl to estimate which PS+1s were third-party trackers. For each tool, we calculated three values relative to the baseline and averaged across all trackers: pages with an HTTP request to a tracker, pages with an HTTP Set-Cookie response from a tracker, and cookies added versus deleted by a tracker. Figure 3 presents our results, showing significant variability in performance. The most effective tool was a combination of community-maintained Fanboy’s Lists for blocking ads, surreptitious tracking, and social content. The TRUSTe block list was the least effective and even allowed tracking by several sizable third parties.

Leon et al. [107] examined the usability of Ghostery, Adblock Plus, and Internet Explorer Tracking Protection List. Two of the five Ghostery users believed they had enabled the extension’s blocking feature when they had not. All five Adblock Plus users configured the extension with a default advertisement blocking list but did not install additional lists to block non-advertising trackers. All five Internet Explorer Tracking Protection List users retained the default setting, believing they had configured the option to substantially or completely block tracking.

In summary, while blocking can be fairly effective, it is primarily a realistic solution for advanced users.

#### Do Not Track (DNT)

Do Not Track (DNT) combines technology and policy to provide consumer choice over web tracking. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is currently standardizing DNT, though the working group has not yet reached consensus on the technology or policy components. The DNT technology is simply an HTTP header, DNT, that signals a user’s preference about web tracking. Associated technologies have been proposed to allow websites to request exceptions and signal their own tracking status. Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, and Opera currently support a DNT opt-out preference (sending the DNT: 1 header). Google has pledged to add this feature to Chrome. As of late 2011, Mozilla [111] reported 5.6% usage in desktop Firefox and 17.1% in Firefox Mobile.

Approximately twenty websites honor the DNT technology, and the Digital Advertising Alliance recently pledged [39] that its approximately eighty member companies would begin supporting the header. DNT enforcement could be achieved through measurement of tracking technologies using tools like FourthParty. In mid-2011, we identified two advertising companies that were surreptitiously taking steps to honor DNT [113], suggesting the approach is viable.

The DNT policy defines what websites must do when they receive a DNT header. Debates over the DNT policy have largely mirrored debates over third-party web tracking policy (see Section III-E). Policymakers, consumer advocates, and researchers are in general agreement that DNT must significantly curtail third-party information collection. The recent DAA commitment only requires a third-party website to stop per-device content personalization if it receives a DNT signal (see Section IV-C).

### Conclusion

This paper surveyed policy and technology issues in third-party web tracking as of early 2012. The field is rapidly evolving, with new announcements, questions, and research results emerging frequently. We hope the information provided here equips security and privacy researchers with the background necessary to contribute to this developing field and participate meaningfully in the ongoing public debate.
