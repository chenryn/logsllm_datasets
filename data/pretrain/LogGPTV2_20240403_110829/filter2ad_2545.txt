ABSTRACT
The Internet of Things (IoTS) is expected to seamlessly con-
nect everything and everyone and bring about the promise
of smart environments, industry 4.0, intelligent infrastruc-
ture management, environmental monitoring and disaster
recover, etc. In fact, ABI Research [1] and Gartner [2] es-
timate that there will be between 20 and 30 billion devices
on the IoTS by 2020. The explosion in the number of in-
terconnected devices makes it a challenge to guarantee their
security, the security of their networks and the privacy of
the data collected by them. The Workshop on Trustwor-
thy Embedded Devices (TrustED) focuses on all aspects of
security and privacy related to embedded systems and the
IoTS. TrustED 2014 continues a successful series of work-
shops, which were held in conjunction with ESORICS 2011,
IEEE Security & Privacy 2012, and ACM CCS 2013 (see
http://www.trusted-workshop.de for details). The goal of
this workshop is to bring together experts from academia
and research institutes, industry, and government in the ﬁeld
of security and privacy in cyber physical systems.

1. BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION
The paradigm of ubiquitous computing and permanent,
mobile connectivity has already become reality through mod-
ern technologies that allow electronic systems to be em-
bedded practically everywhere, most prominently with the

smart phone. It is predicted [1, 2] that the number of Inter-
net connected devices will increase exponentially, reaching
over 20 billion by 2020. Examples of such ubiquitous inter-
connected systems include sensor nodes, smart meters, fem-
tocells, automotive platforms, home gateways, smart homes,
and IPTV boxes, to name a few. Unfortunately, the new op-
portunities created by smart environments and infrastruc-
tures also come with new security and privacy risks. This is
particularly true when embedded systems are involved, with
which we are expected to closely and, sometimes unknow-
ingly, interact in our daily lives. Embedded devices diﬀer
signiﬁcantly from ”classical” systems, such as desktop PCs
in several aspects:
• Constrained resources: they have limited power,
memory and computation capabilities, and therefore
standard security solutions have to be re-designed.
• Ease of accessibility: malicious parties can access
them, replace them or physically tamper with them.
• Connectivity: we expect most (future) embedded
devices to be network enabled and often connected
to more powerful devices or gateways. This network
topology and the previous two characteristics makes
them perfect targets for network attacks.
Thus, the challenge is to develop security solutions that
guarantee trust, security, and privacy while meeting the con-
straints of embedded systems. Furthermore, guaranteeing
security across diﬀerent layers of the the embedded system
(hardware, OS, and application) while at the same time min-
imizing overhead is both a challenge and a requirement to
enable successful system deployment.
2. SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES
Summing up, security for embedded systems is a highly in-
terdisciplinary topic. This poses, both, new challenges and
new possibilities. A promising approach is to exploit spe-
cial features in embedded devices and their environment for
establishing novel security and privacy mechanisms. Exam-
ples include the identiﬁcation and deployment of new out-
of-band channels, such as NFC-based schemes, the explicit
use of physical properties, such as distance bounding proto-
cols, signal ﬁngerprinting, information theoretic secret key
derivation from wireless fading channels, or secure execu-
tion environments provided by new generations of proces-
sors. In general, the use of hardware-entangled cryptogra-
phy (e.g., schemes based on physically unclonable functions),
and hardware-assisted cryptographic protocols represent a
1548promising technological development towards trustworthy
embedded devices and networks.
In this workshop, we consider selected aspects of cyber
physical systems and their environments. We aim to bring
together experts from academia, industry and government
organizations to discuss and investigate the problems, chal-
lenges, and recent scientiﬁc and technological developments
in this ﬁeld. The workshop topics include (but are not lim-
ited to) the following:
• Embedded system security
• Privacy aspects of embedded systems (e.g., medical
devices, electronic IDs)
• Physical and logical convergence (e.g., secure and pri-
vacy preserving facility management),
• Hardware entangled cryptography
• Foundation, development, and applications of physical
security primitives (e.g., physically unclonable func-
tions - PUFs),
• Remote attestation
• IP protection for embedded systems
• Reverse engineering
• Secure execution environments (e.g., TrustZone, TPMs,
etc.) on mobile devices
• New protection paradigms for trustworthy embedded
systems
