Table 2 lists MTTDL values of all the codes evaluated in

5.1. Eight-disk configurations
Figure 2. (5,3)-FLAT, 4-bimodal.
In this section we exhaustively evaluate the three flat
codes of size 8 on various configurations. First, consider
the 4-bimodal distribution. Figures 1, 2, and 3 respectively
show MTTDL histograms for (4,4)-RAID 10, (5,3)-FLAT, and
(6,2)-FLAT. These histograms are constructed by simulating
the MTTDL of the 8! = 40320 possible placements.
Each histogram is annotated with a vertical line. The ver(cid:173)
tical line corresponds to the MTTDL for the FTV. The FTV
is described in §3, it estimates the MTTDL of the median
placement. In these figures, the FTV MTTDL is indeed near
the median MTTDL over all possible placements.
Each histogram is also annotated with a series of lines
labeled with integers. These lines are related to RME cal-

culations. For each of these codes, the BF-RP algorithm
is used to determine the RME of each distinct placement.
We were surprised to discover that for each of these codes,
only a small number of distinct RME values were produced.
From this, we hypothesized that there are isomorphic place(cid:173)
ments, i.e., different placements that have the same RME and
MTTDL.
Each line on each histogram is effectively a sub(cid:173)
histogram for an isomorphic class of placements. The in(cid:173)
teger labels on the classes are in order of RME value, so line
ohas a lower RME than line 1. Note that we expected there
to be no more than (~) = 70 distinct RME values for the
4-bimodal configuration because the first four and last four
devices are identical. Figures 1, 2, and 3 show that there are
respectively 3, 7, and 6 isomorphic classes.
To better understand isomorphic placements, consider
(4,4)-RAID 10. The following are example placements for
each isomorphic placement class: 0 : (81, 83, 85, 87, 80,
8 2, 8 4, 8 6), 1 : (80, 81, 82, 84, 83, 85, 86, 87), and 2 : (80,
81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87). The first four symbols in each
placement is on a lOOk device, and the second four symbols
are on a 500k device. We already discussed the placements
for classes 0 and 2 in §4.1. The placement for class 1 is
consistent with the prior discussion: one pair of replicated
symbols is on the lOOk devices and so we expect the MTTDL
to fall between class 0 (two pairs of replicated symbols on
1OOk devices) and class 2 (no pairs ofreplicated symbols on
1OOk devices).
The ordering of sub-histograms in each experiment
strongly support our hypothesis that the RME correctly or(cid:173)
ders different placements with regard to reliability. The
spread within each sub-histogram is due to statistical vari(cid:173)
ance; remember that each simulation to produce a histogram
data point was run for only 100 iterations. Because the MEL
for (5,3)-FLAT and (6,2)-FLAT contain more entries than that
of (4,4)-RAID 10, they each have more isomorphic place(cid:173)
ment classes. The distribution of isomorphic placement
classes is interesting: the density of placements in the me(cid:173)
dian classes appears to be greater than in the "best" class.
This suggests that good placements are less common.
Now consider the uniform configuration instead of the
4-bimodal configuration. Figures 4, 5, and 6 respectively
show MTTDL histograms for (4,4)-RAID 10, (5,3)-FLAT,
(6,2)-FLAT. The FTV MTTDL is annotated on these his(cid:173)
tograms. Sub-histograms for isomorphic placement classes
are not presented. The uniform configuration leads to too
many such classes to illustrate. To be more precise, there
are respectively 105, 840, and 280 distinct classes. These
values are all much lower than the 8! = 40320 poten(cid:173)
tial distinct RME values, and so these results also support

the idea of isomorphic placement classes. Instead of sub(cid:173)
histograms, a vertical line is shown for a placement from
each of the following isomorphic placement classes: Worst
RME, Q3 (third quartile) RME, Q2 (second quartile) RME,
Q1 (first quartile) RME, and Best RME.
Our hypothesis is that the MTTDL ofthe placement from
the Worst RME class would be less than that of the place(cid:173)
ment from the Q3 RME class, and so on. The results sup(cid:173)
port this hypothesis. One exception is the results for Q1
RME and Q2 RME for (6,2)-FLAT which are out of order.
The difference between the MTTDLresults for Q1 RME and
Q2 RME is small though; we conclude that the Q1 RME and
Q2 RME placements simply have quite similar reliabilities.
We expect the FTV MTTDL to provide an estimate of the
median placement, because it is computed using the FTV, a
probability vector derived from the MEV. As a consequence
the FTV MTTDL should align with the Q2 RME MTTDL. Our
results support this hypothesis, allowing us to use the FTV
MTTDL as a reference when comparing the reliability of
placements.
Table 3 summarizes results for all of the bimodal con(cid:173)
figurations and the uniform configuration. For each code,
the FTV MTTDL and the Best RME MTTDL are listed. In all
cases, the Best RME MTTDL is better than that of the FTV
MTTDL.
All of these experiments support our hypothesis that the
RME can be used to identify placements of erasure-coded
symbols that maximizes reliability. The reliability differ(cid:173)
ence between the worst placements and best placements
range from from around a factor of two for (4,4)-RAID 10
to an order of magnitude for (5,3)-FLAT. Table 3 shows
that across all configurations, differences between the FTV
MTTDL and the Best RME MTTDL range from no difference
to a factor of six.
5.2. Twelve-disk configurations
For 12-disk configurations, it is not feasible to evaluate
every possible placement via simulation, but it is feasible
to do so via the RME metric. We ran the BF-RP algorithm
for the (9,3)-FLAT, and (10,2)-FLAT codes for all possible
bimodal configurations and the uniform configuration. We
also ran the SA-RP algorithm on these configurations. We
run the SA-RP algorithm for a total of 1000000 steps; if the
RME does not improve in 25 steps, the placement reverts to
the last best placement for this execution; if the best RME
placement does not improve in 1000 steps, a new execu(cid:173)
tion is initialized with a random placement.
In all cases,
the SA-RP algorithm identified a placement from the same
isomorphic placement class as the BF-RP algorithm (i.e., its
RME is the same as the Best RME).
To determine the quality of the placements selected by
the BF-RP and SA-RP algorithms, we simulated the Best
RME MTTDL and the FTV MTTDL for a subset of config-
urations. The results are listed in Table 4. In most cases, the
MTTDL of the placement with the Best RME is significantly
better than that ofthe FTV. For the 9-bimodal configuration,
the MTTDL values for (10,2)-FLAT are effectively the same.
From the BF-RP results, we also can identify the Worst
RME, Q3 RME, Q2 RME, and Q3 RME placements. We sim(cid:173)
ulated the MTTDL of these placements as well as 1000 ran(cid:173)
dom placements to generate low fidelity histograms. An ex(cid:173)
ample of such a histogram for (9,3)-FLAT in the 6-bimodal
configuration is given in Figure 7. The histograms further
support the hypothesis that the RME metric correctly orders
placements by reliability.
5.3. Twenty-disk configurations
For 20-disk configurations, it is infeasible to evaluate ev(cid:173)
ery possible placement via simulation or the RME metric.
Instead, we use the SA-RP algorithm to identify an Approx(cid:173)
imate Best RME placement for these configurations. We ran
the SA-RP algorithm for the (17,3)-FLAT, and (16,4)-FLAT
codes for all of the bimodal configurations and the uniform
configuration. The SA-RP algorithm is run in the same man(cid:173)
ner as for the 12-disk configurations.
To determine the quality of the placements selected by
the SA-RP algorithm, we simulated the MTTDL of the Ap(cid:173)
proximate Best RME placement found by SA-RP and com(cid:173)
pare it with the FTV MTTDL for a subset of configurations.
The results are listed in Table 5. In all cases, the Approxi(cid:173)
mate Best RME MTTDL is significantly better than the FTV
MTTDL.
6. Discussion
The redundancy placement algorithms based on the RME
effectively find reliable placements. However, we have not
characterized how sensitive the redundancy placement al(cid:173)
gorithms are to different failure models. Specifically, we
do not have a good characterization of the conditions nec(cid:173)
essary for the RME to correctly order placements by their
reliability.
We believe that extensive simulation will permit us to do
such characterization. Unfortunately, the HFR Simulator is
currently too slow to run the potentially millions of analy(cid:173)
ses necessary to do such characterization. The existence of
isomorphic placement classes suggests an avenue for speed(cid:173)
ing up the redundancy placement algorithms. If we identify
the sets of symbols that are equivalent, i.e., that if swapped
yield a new placement in the same isomorphic class, then
