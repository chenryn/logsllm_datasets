Task:
    - name: install authorized keys
      action: authorized_key user={{item}} key="{{ lookup('file', 'authorized_keys') }}"
      with_items: ssh_key_users
This worked under ansible 1.3.3. With devel branch I get:
    TASK: [ssh_key | install authorized keys] *************************************
    fatal: [ubutest] => One or more undefined variables: 'lookup' is undefined
    FATAL: all hosts have already failed -- aborting
