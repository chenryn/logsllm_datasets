Cookie syncing
Right before the GDPR took effect,
companies updated their privacy
policies; cookie notices lack usabil-
ity.
Websites set 49 % less cookies if
users from the EU visit them.
Effects of the GDPR on third-party
usage is not clear.
The GDPR has global reach (e. g.,
cookie banners) but tracking is of-
ten still present even if opted out.
49 % of websites do not honor the
cookie directive.
Large trackers (slightly) gain in cov-
erage while shares of smaller track-
ers (clearly) decreas.
News websites use less social media
content; cookie usage, without con-
sent, is decreased by around 22 %.
GDPR has a statistically significant
impact on cookie syncing, which is
reduced by around 40%.

et al. performed a study on cookie syncing on a dataset the collected
over the course of one year including browsing activity from 850
mobile devices [39]. According to their measurement, over 97 %
of users are exposed to cookie syncing and an ID is shared with
3.5 companies on average. Karaj et al. monitored the online track-
ing landscape over a period of ten months using data provided by
real users through a browser extension [30]. They try to illumi-
nate effects of the GDPR on the online tracking business and argue
that more transparency and accountability is needed since users
struggle to keep control of their data.
3.3 ID Sharing
In addition to the studies referenced in Subsection 3.2, work has
been conducted regarding ad networks. Falahrastegar et al. investi-
gated the connections between third parties focusing on ID shar-
ing [18]. They found that domains show more syncing activities
when a user is logged out and group the sharing domains based
on their content. Most recently, Bashir et al. introduced a so-called
inclusion graph that models the diffusion of online tracking through
Real-Time Bidding [4]. They show that 52 advertisers or analytics
companies obverse over 90 % of an average user’s online clickstream.
The work differs from ours since we do not want to shed light on
the connection of online advertising companies but measure effects
of the GDPR. A method to identify server-side information flow
in the ad economy was presented by Bashir et al. [3]. They use
re-targeted ads to reveal information flows.
3.4 Computer Law and Privacy Policies
Aside from the presented more technical papers, our work is related
to work that focuses on the legal aspects of the GDPR. Recently,
Libert presented his work on an automated approach to auditing
disclosure of third-party data collection in websites’ privacy poli-
cies [32]. The work shows empirically that it is unmanageable for a
person to read the privacy policies of the first and third parties. De
Hert et al. [24] discuss the right to data portability from a computer
law point of view. De Hert et al. give a systematic interpretation
of the new rights and propose two approaches how to interpret
the legal term “data provided” in the GDPR. The authors describe a
minimal approach, where only data directly given to the controller
(e. g., data entered into a form) can be seen as “provided.” They also
describe a broad approach which also labels data observed by the
controller (e. g., browser fingerprints) as “provided.” The authors
propose to adopt the extensive approach.
3.5 Distinction from Previous Work
The introduced related work measures the tracking capabilities
and other privacy implications of websites—some in relation to
the GDPR. However, previous work related to the GDPR simply
looked at the third parties present on websites and if their presence
changed [8, 43], measured tracking techniques and their preva-
lence [1, 16], or analyzed cookie setting practices of third par-
ties [15, 41]. In this work, we go deeper and provide insights in
the connections of third parties as far as these are observable on
the client. We focus on the amount of sharing connections, the
typologies how companies are related to each other, and provide

some case studies on specific companies and how they adopted
the new legislation. Figure 2 highlights our contribution and its
distinction from previous work.
4 MEASUREMENT APPROACH
We conducted a measurement study of cookie syncing in the browser
to gain insights into information sharing between tracking compa-
nies and the impact of the GDPR on these practices. In the following,
we describe our measurement framework and explain how we mea-
sure the syncing relations of third parties.
4.1 Measurement Framework
To measure the extent of cookie synchronization and the existing
networks in the sharing economy, we used the OpenWPM [16] plat-
form. For our study, we deployed the platform on two computers at
a European university to ensure a European origin of our generated
web traffic. We chose not to use a scalable web service (e. g., Amazon
EC2) to automate our measurement since it is easier for a website
to detect such automated crawls [28]. Additionally, we conducted
two additional measurements using US-based IP addresses using a
VPN service to validate the effects of geolocation.
OpenWPM was configured to log all HTTP request and response
headers, HTTP redirects, and POST request bodies as well as various
types of cookies (e. g., Flash cookies). We did not set the “Do Not
Track” HTTP header and allowed third-party cookies. We used
simple bot detection mitigation techniques (i. e., scrolling randomly
up and down on each visited website and randomly jiggling with the
mouse) to make it more difficult to detect our crawler. As OpenWPM
is an instrumentation of the Firefox browser, our measurement is
limited to cookie syncing on the browser level.
In each subsequent measurement of our analysis, we created
400 browsing profiles. A “browser profile” is a separate browser
instance with its own cookie store, caching, and browsing history.
Each profile had its own browser storage to make sure cookies
could be separately stored for each session. We created 20 profiles
for the top 20 countries with the highest number of Internet users
worldwide [27]. The top 20 countries account for 71 % of all Internet
users. The list contains six countries from the EU, three countries
from the Americas, six countries from Asia, and five countries from
Africa and the Middle East. We choose to use the worldwide top

build the browser profiles which we use to visit the web-
sites. Based on the captured traffic, we build the third-party
graphs which we analyze regarding ID syncing.
countries, and not just EU top countries, since GDPR applies to all
companies that offer services to EU residents. Furthermore, we ran-
domly assigned a popular user-agent string and a common screen
resolution1 to each browser profile that remained constant during
the crawling process per session. Each profile was assigned at ran-
dom so that all 400 profiles used its own set of user agent and screen
resolution (around 312 different combinations in each country). We
used an artificially populated cookie store and browsing history in
each browser profile which we created by browsing 100 random
websites selected from the Alexa top 1,000 list.
For each profile, we took the Alexa top 500 list of the correspond-
ing country [2] (as off May 2018) and randomly chose 100 to 400
websites to be visited. We randomized the number of websites to
mimic a more realistic user behavior and capture more realistic
cookie syncing activities. During the course of all our measure-
ments, we used the same Alexa top lists to allow better comparabil-
ity across our measurements. We limited our measurement to the
top 500 websites to be able to conduct measurements in a reasonable
time (one measurement took about one week). In all measurements
each website was visited with at least one profile and no websites
excluded EU residents from their service (e. g., by showing error
pages or sending HTTP error codes). To mimic interactions with
the websites, we extracted all first-party links from their landing
pages. For example, when visiting foo.com, we extracted all links
to pages on foo.com and randomly visited two to four of those. In
the remainder of this paper we call these links subsites since they
are all associate with the same website but have a distinct URL.
We decide to randomize the visited websites because we wanted to
measure the effects of the new legislation on a broader scale and not
just the effect of a chosen set of domains or sub sites. Overall, we
visit between 120,000 and 800,000 (221,656 on average (SD 10,609))
distinct URLs per measurement. An overview of the measurement
approach is given in Figure 3.
We conducted twelve measurements (M#1–M#12) over the course
of ten months. The first measurement started just days before the
GDPR went into effect (May 19, 2018), the second right after the
GDPR went into effect (May, 25 2018). The following measurements
were made in intervals of about four weeks (i. e., one measurement
in the third calendar week (CW) of each month, from 05/18 to 03/19).
We performed two reference measurements with US-based IP ad-
dresses via a VPN connection in October 2018 and January 2019
1User agents were collected from TechBlog [45], most common screen resolution set
as reported by Global Stats counter [20].
to compare the results with Europe-based traffic from the same
time. VPN services can potentially inject content (e. g., ads) into
the traffic, which might affect the results [31]. However, the Terms
of Service of the used VPN service (NordVPN) neither stated that
this might happen nor did we find any information about content
injection for this VPN service. To avoid dishonest statements of the
VPN service provider regarding the location of their servers [57],
we checked at the beginning of each experiment if the VPN service
had assigned an IP address associated with an US geolocation using
different services (e. g., “IP Location Finder” [29] or “What Is My IP
Address” [58]) and monitored that this address did not change dur-
ing the experiment. For each measurement, we use a newly created
profile (i. e., new and different cookie stores) to avoid pollution of
our dataset.
4.2 Identification and Mapping of Third-Party
Relations
To analyze the sharing of personal or digital identifiers (IDs), we
first need to define them. For every visited domain we analyzed
the HTTP GET and POST requests and split the path or body of the
requests at characters that are typically used as delimiters (e. g., ’&’
or ’;’). As a result, we obtained a set of ID candidates we stored as
key-value pairs for later analysis. We identified IDs according to
the following rules inspired by Acar et al. [1]:
• Eliminate ID candidates with the same key but where val-
ues differ in length. We expected that IDs are of consis-
• Eliminate all ID candidates that were observed for multi-
ple profiles. Every identifier should be unique to each pro-
file (e. g., we eliminate c1 = (p_id, 1234abcd) and c2 =
(p_id, 1234abcd) if they were observed in two profiles).
tent length (e. g., the candidates c1 = (data, 3rw3) and
c2 =(data, 70д63b5д) would be eliminated).
differ significantly (e. g., the candidates c1 =(id, AAAC) and
c2 =(id, AABA) would be eliminated).
candidate c =(key, 1hдtz) is excluded).
• Eliminate candidates whose values do not contain enough
entropy (according to the Ratcliff/Obershelp pattern recogni-
tion algorithm [40]) to contain an ID. Since we only observe
a small fraction of the potential ID space, we expect that IDs
• Exclude candidates whose length is too short to contain
enough entropy to hold an ID. To provide enough entropy,
we expect an ID to have at least eight characters (e. g., the
To measure the syncing relations of third parties, it is neces-
sary to identify URLs in a request that contain user IDs (e. g., foo.
com/sync?partner=https://bar.com?/id=abcd-1234). To do
so we attempt to decode (e. g., BASE64) and deflate (e. g., gzip)
every HTTP GET and POST argument. Since any of these arguments
might be encoded/inflated multiple times, as observed by Starov
et al. [44], we repeated this process multiple times (if necessary).
We used regular expressions to parse the decoded values for URLs.
When an URL was found, we check if this URL has GET parameters
that might be an ID, according to our definition of an ID.
We used the WhoTracks.me database [9] to cluster all observed
third-party websites based on the company owning the domain.
These clusters served as nodes for the construction of an undirected
graph. We added two types of edges to the graph to connect the
nodes: (1) direct relations (i. e., a website embeds a third-party
object) and (2) syncing relations (i. e., two third parties that perform
cookie syncing). Thus, we can measure (1) how many websites
make use of a specific third party and (2) with how many other
third parties IDs were synced. If we found a request was used to
sync user IDs, we created a link in the constructed graph for the
measurement in which the syncing was observed.
5 RESULTS AND EVALUATION
To analyze the effects of the GDPR regarding cookie synchronisa-
tion, we performed monthly measurements between May 2018 and
March 2019 (twelve in total). Excluding the US reference measure-
ments, we visited 2,659,873 URLs in our study, resulting in over
1 TB of data, in terms of size of the OpenWPM databases. We refer
to our first measurement as pre-GDPR measurement, because it
was conducted before the GDPR went into effect, and to all other
measurements as post-GDPR measurements. Based on the data
gathered in our measurements, we created graphs to represent the
ID sharing between different companies. The resulting graphs show
a steep decrease in sharing after the GDPR went into effect.
Table 2 provides an overview of the size of each measurement,
which varied due to some randomization introduced as described
in Section 4. The table lists the number of domains visited in each
measurement to allow for comparison of our results with related
work. For the remainder of the paper, we cluster the observed third
parties based on the respective owning owning company (see Sec-
tion 4). Figure 4 illustrates the size of the pre-GDPR measurement
in relation to the post-GDPR measurements. While the number of
visited domains was above average (8,448) but within the interquar-
tile range (25th and 75th percentile), the amount of actually visited
websites in M#1 is above the median (but slightly below the average
of 221,656) but also within the interquartile range.
In line with previous work [15, 43] our data shows that the aver-
age number of third parties embedded in websites did not change
before and after the GDPR went into effect. But when considering
the whole ecosystem, changes can be observed.

ment the number of visited domains, the visited number of
subsites, and the observed third parties are given.
