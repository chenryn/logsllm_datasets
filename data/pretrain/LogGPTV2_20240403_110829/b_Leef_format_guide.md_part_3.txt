Glossary
This glossary provides terms and definitions for the IBM QRadar SIEM software and products.
The following cross-references are used in this glossary:
• See refers you from a nonpreferred term to the preferred term or from an abbreviation to the spelled-
out form.
• See also refers you to a related or contrasting term.
For other terms and definitions, see the IBM Terminology website (opens in new window).
A
accumulator
A register in which one operand of an operation can be stored and subsequently replaced by the result
of that operation.
active system
In a high-availability (HA) cluster, the system that has all of its services running.
Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
A protocol that dynamically maps an IP address to a network adapter address in a local area network.
administrative share
A network resource that is hidden from users without administrative privileges. Administrative shares
provide administrators with access to all resources on a network system.
anomaly
A deviation from the expected behavior of the network.
application signature
A unique set of characteristics that are derived by the examination of packet payload and then used to
identify a specific application.
ARP
See Address Resolution Protocol.
ARP Redirect
An ARP method for notifying the host if a problem exists on a network.
ASN
See autonomous system number.
asset
A manageable object that is either deployed or intended to be deployed in an operational
environment.
autonomous system number (ASN)
In TCP/IP, a number that is assigned to an autonomous system by the same central authority that
assigns IP addresses. The autonomous system number makes it possible for automated routing
algorithms to distinguish autonomous systems.
B
behavior
The observable effects of an operation or event, including its results.
bonded interface
See link aggregation.
burst
A sudden sharp increase in the rate of incoming events or flows such that the licensed flow or event
rate limit is exceeded.

C
CIDR
See Classless Inter-Domain Routing.
Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)
A method for adding class C Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. The addresses are given to Internet
Service Providers (ISPs) for use by their customers. CIDR addresses reduce the size of routing tables
and make more IP addresses available within organizations.
client
A software program or computer that requests services from a server.
cluster virtual IP address
An IP address that is shared between the primary or secondary host and the HA cluster.
coalescing interval
The interval at which events are bundled. Event bundling occurs in 10 second intervals and begins
with the first event that does not match any currently coalescing events. Within the coalescing
interval, the first three matching events are bundled and sent to the event processor.
Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
A scoring system by which the severity of a vulnerability is measured.
console
A display station from which an operator can control and observe the system operation.
content capture
A process that captures a configurable amount of payload and then stores the data in a flow log.
credential
A set of information that grants a user or process certain access rights.
credibility
A numeric rating between 0-10 that is used to determine the integrity of an event or an offense.
Credibility increases as multiple sources report the same event or offense.
CVSS
See Common Vulnerability Scoring System.
D
database leaf object
A terminal object or node in a database hierarchy.
datapoint
A calculated value of a metric at a point in time.
Device Support Module (DSM)
A configuration file that parses received events from multiple log sources and coverts them to a
standard taxonomy format that can be displayed as output.
DHCP
See Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol.
DNS
See Domain Name System.
Domain Name System (DNS)
The distributed database system that maps domain names to IP addresses.
DSM
See Device Support Module.
duplicate flow
Multiple instances of the same data transmission received from different flow sources.
16 IBM QRadar : Log Event Extended Format (LEEF)
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
A communications protocol that is used to centrally manage configuration information. For example,
DHCP automatically assigns IP addresses to computers in a network.
E
encryption
In computer security, the process of transforming data into an unintelligible form in such a way that
the original data either cannot be obtained or can be obtained only by using a decryption process.
endpoint
The address of an API or service in an environment. An API exposes an endpoint and at the same time
invokes the endpoints of other services.
external scanning appliance
A machine that is connected to the network to gather vulnerability information about assets in the
network.
F
false positive
An event or flow that the user can decide should not create an offense, or an offense that the user
decides is not a security incident.
flow
A single transmission of data passing over a link during a conversation.
flow log
A collection of flow records.
flow sources
The origin from which flow is captured. A flow source is classified as internal when flow comes from
hardware installed on a managed host or it is classified as external when the flow is sent to a flow
