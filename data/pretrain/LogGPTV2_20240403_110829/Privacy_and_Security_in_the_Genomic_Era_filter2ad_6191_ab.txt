### Genetic Traits and Their Implications

As of 2014, over 1,600 genetic traits have been reported in the literature, encompassing a wide range of conditions. These include metabolic disorders such as phenylketonuria (caused by a mutation in the PKU gene), neurodegenerative diseases like Huntington’s disease (caused by a mutation in the HD gene [MacDonald et al., 1993]), and blood disorders such as sickle cell anemia (caused by a mutation in the HBB gene [Saiki et al., 1985]). While some of these conditions can be managed through dietary changes or pharmacological treatments, others remain without effective interventions.

Despite the lack of cures for some genetic conditions, many individuals choose to learn their genetic status. This knowledge allows them to make informed decisions about their lives and contribute to medical research [Mastromauro et al., 1987]. Additionally, genetic testing can be used prenatally to detect factors that may influence health outcomes, such as congenital defects like Tay-Sachs disease [Lippman, 1991].

However, most variations in an individual's genome do not follow the one-gene-one-disease (OGOD) model. Instead, genetic variation is often associated with changes in susceptibility to certain diseases or behaviors [Botstein and Risch, 2003]. For example, cancer-predisposing variants in genes such as BRCA1/2 or those linked to Lynch Syndrome are well-known. Such variations can also affect an individual's response to pharmaceuticals. Some individuals are strong or weak metabolizers, requiring adjusted dosages or different medications. This information has been leveraged to optimize dosing for various medications, including blood thinners after heart surgery and hypertension management [Pulley et al., 2012]. Furthermore, genomic changes detected in tumor cells can guide the selection of appropriate cancer treatments [McDermott et al., 2011].

### Research Advances in Genomics

The field of genomics continues to discover new associations between genetic variations and diseases or treatment responses on a weekly basis. Technological advancements have significantly reduced the cost of genome sequencing, making it feasible to collect, store, and analyze genomic data at a fine-grained level and across large populations. For instance, the Kadoorie biobank in China and the UK Biobank aim to sequence the genomes of 500,000 individuals each by the end of 2014, while the U.S. National Cancer Institute is initiating its Million Cancer Genome Project [Haussler et al., 2012]. However, computational analysis remains more expensive than sequencing itself.

Advances in genome sequencing are converging with the big data revolution in healthcare. Large datasets from electronic health records (EHRs) are now being used to support research on clinical phenotypes, which were previously too complex to model [Gottesman et al., 2013b]. Consequently, genome sequences have become essential components of biomedical research [Kohane, 2011].

### Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) Genome Sequencing

Historically, genome sequencing was a complex and costly process, primarily conducted in large research laboratories or diagnostic services. In recent years, DTC genome sequencing has become more accessible, allowing individuals to directly engage in the collection, processing, and analysis of their genomic data [Prainsack and Vayena, 2013]. DTC services enable individuals to learn about their disease susceptibility risks and even perform genetic compatibility tests with potential partners. Moreover, DTC services provide individuals with digital representations of their genome sequences, giving them control over how this information is disclosed, to whom, and when.

Not all DTC products are focused on health applications. For example, genomic data is increasingly used to determine and track kinship, such as tracing ancestral heritage and determining the relatedness of individuals with the same surname [Jobling, 2001].

### Legal and Forensic Applications

Given the static nature of genomic sequences, they are often used for investigative purposes. For instance, DNA evidence can be used in contested parentage suits [Anderlik, 2003] and in criminal investigations [Kaye and Smith, 2003]. Law enforcement may compel residents to provide tissue samples to aid in investigations [Greely et al., 2006], and DNA from unknown suspects can be compared to relatives to identify potential criminals.

However, the retention and use of DNA by law enforcement raise concerns. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that law enforcement can collect and retain DNA from suspects, even if they are not prosecuted [Liptak, 2013]. Once DNA is shed (e.g., from saliva on a coffee cup), it is considered an "abandoned" resource, and the individual relinquishes ownership rights [Joh, 2006]. This means that DNA collected from discarded materials can be sequenced and used without the individual's consent.

### Relevance of Genomic Privacy

Genomic data has numerous distinguishing features and applications, and the misuse of this information can have serious implications, such as genetic discrimination in insurance, employment, or education, or blackmail [Gottlieb, 2001]. A notable example of genetic discrimination was shared by Dr. Noralane Lindor at the Mayo Clinic’s Individualizing Medicine Conference (2012). During her study, she sequenced the grandchildren of a cancer patient, two of whom had the same cancer mutation. One grandchild, who applied to the U.S. Army to become a helicopter pilot, was rejected after revealing her genetic test results, despite genetic testing not being required for military recruitment [Lindor, 2012].

The familial aspect of genomics complicates privacy issues. A recent example is the debate between the family members of Henrietta Lacks and medical researchers [Skloot, 2013]. Ms. Lacks, who died in 1951, had her cancer cells removed for research, which led to significant medical advances. Recently, researchers sequenced and published her genome without her family's consent, raising concerns about the privacy of her living relatives. Although the NIH entered into an agreement with the Lacks family, there is no consensus on the control individuals and families should have over the use of their genetic data [Ritter, 2013].

### Threats and Protection of Genomic Data

Threats to genomic data arise from the potential for leakage, which can occur through various sources, such as reckless clinicians, hospital IT breaches, or sequencing facilities. If data storage is outsourced, it can also be compromised by hackers or disgruntled employees. Individuals storing their own genomic data (e.g., on smartphones) are also at risk from malware. Surprisingly, sometimes the leakage is performed by the genome owner, such as uploading variants to genome-sharing websites like OpenSNP.org, sometimes with identifying information.

Legal and policy measures, such as the U.S. Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) [Altman and Klein, 2002], aim to protect genomic privacy. However, enforcing these laws is challenging, and they may leave loopholes. For example, GINA does not apply to life insurance or the military. Therefore, legislation alone is insufficient to prevent privacy violations.

Technical solutions, such as cryptography and obfuscation, can enhance genomic privacy but may reduce the efficiency and utility of the data. Balancing privacy and the need for efficient data use is crucial, especially in personalized medicine and law enforcement. Techniques that ensure the security and privacy of genomic data without significantly degrading its use in research and healthcare are needed.

### Expert Survey on Genomic Privacy

To better understand the perspectives of the biomedical community on genomic privacy, we conducted a survey of biomedical professionals. The survey aimed to explore widely held beliefs about genome privacy, ongoing research directions, and the sharing of genomic data. Our sample size, while limited, provides statistically meaningful results. The survey was conducted both online and via paper, using snowball sampling to recruit participants. Approximately 53% of the participants were from the US, and 45% were from Europe. The survey form is available at http://goo.gl/wy7UXH.
