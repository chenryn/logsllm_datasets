Risch, 2003]. As of 2014, there were over 1,600 of these traits reported on in
the literature5, ranging from metabolic disorders (e.g., phenylketonuria, which
is caused by a mutation in the PKU gene) to neurodegenerative diseases (e.g.,
Huntington’s chorea, which is caused by a mutation in the HD gene [MacDonald
et al., 1993]) to blood disorders (e.g., Sickle cell anemia, caused by a mutation
in the HBB gene [Saiki et al., 1985]). While some of these diseases are man-
ageable through changes in diet or pharmacological treatments, others are not
and have no known intervention to assist in the improvement of an individual’s
health status. Nonetheless, some individuals choose to learn their genetic sta-
tus, so that they may order their aﬀairs accordingly and contribute to medical
research [Mastromauro et al., 1987] (as elaborated upon below). Moreover, ge-
netic tests can be applied in a prenatal setting to detect a variety of factors

that can inﬂuence health outcomes (e.g., if a fetus is liable to have a congenital
defect that could limit its lifespan, such as Tay-Sach’s disease) [Lippman, 1991].
Yet, the majority of variations in an individual’s genome do not follow the
OGOD model. Rather, it has been shown that variation is associated with
change in the susceptibility of an individual to a certain disease or behavior [Bot-
stein and Risch, 2003]. Cancer-predisposing variants in genes such as BRCA1/2
or the Lynch Syndrome are well-known examples. Such variation may also mod-
ify an individual’s ability to respond to a pharmaceutical agent. For instance,
some individuals are strong (weak) metabolizers, such that they may require
a lesser (greater) amount of a drug than is standard practice, or may gain the
greatest beneﬁt from a diﬀerent drug entirely. This variation has been leveraged
to provide dosing for several medications in practice, including blood thinners af-
ter heart surgery (to prevent clotting) and hypertension management (to lessen
the severity of heart disease) [Pulley et al., 2012]. Additionally, changes in an
individual’s genome detected in a tumor cell can inform which medications are
most appropriate to treat cancer [McDermott et al., 2011].
III.B Research
While the genome has been linked with a signiﬁcant number of disorders and
variable responses to treatments, new associations are being discovered on a
weekly basis. Technology for performing such basic research continues to un-
dergo rapid advances [Brunham and Hayden, 2012]. The dramatic decrease
in the cost of genome sequencing has made it increasingly possible to collect,
store, and computationally analyze genomic sequencing data on a ﬁne-grained
level, as well as over populations on the order of millions of people (e.g., China’s
Kadoorie biobank [Chen et al., 2011] and UK Biobank [Allen et al., 2014] will
each contain genomic data on 500,000 individuals by the end of 2014, while the
U.S. National Cancer Institute is at the beginning of its Million Cancer Genome
Project [Haussler et al., 2012]). Yet, it should be recognized that computational
analysis is separate from, and more costly than, sequencing technology itself
(e.g., the $1K analysis of a genome is far from being developed).
Moreover, technological advances in genome sequencing are coalescing with
a big data revolution in the healthcare domain. Large quantities of data derived
from electronic health records (EHRs), for instance, are being made available
to support research on clinical phenotypes that, until several years ago, were
deemed to be too noisy and complex to model [Gottesman et al., 2013b]. As a
consequence, genome sequences have become critical components of the biomed-
ical research process [Kohane, 2011].
III.C Direct-to-Consumer Services
Historically, genome sequencing was a complex and expensive process that, as
a result, was left to large research laboratories or diagnostic services, but in the
past several years, there has been a rise in DTC genome sequencing from various
7
companies [Prainsack and Vayena, 2013]. These services have made it aﬀord-
able for individuals to become directly involved in the collection, processing,
and even analysis of their genomic data. The DTC movement has enabled in-
dividuals to learn about their disease susceptibility risks (as alluded to earlier),
and even perform genetic compatibility tests with potential partners. Moreover,
and perhaps more importantly, DTC has made it possible for individuals to be
provided with digital representations of their genome sequences, such that they
can control how such information is disclosed, to whom, and when.
Of course, not all consumer products are oriented toward health applications.
For example, genomic data is increasingly applied to determine and/or track
kinship. This information has been applied for instance to track an individual’s
ancestral heritage and determine the extent to which individuals with the same
surname are related with respect to their genomic variance [Jobling, 2001].
III.D Legal and Forensic
Given the static nature of genomic sequences, this information has often been
used for investigative purposes. For instance, this information may be applied
in contested parentage suits [Anderlik, 2003]. Moreover, DNA found at a crime
scene (or on a victim) may be used as evidence by law enforcement to track down
suspected criminals [Kaye and Smith, 2003]. It is not unheard of for residents
of a certain geographic region to be compelled to provide tissue samples to
law enforcement to help in such investigations [Greely et al., 2006]. Given
the kinship relationships that such information communicates, DNA from an
unknown suspect has been compared to relatives to determine the corresponding
individual’s likely identity in order to better facilitate a manhunt.
One of the concerns of such uses, however, is that it is unclear how law en-
forcement may retain and/or use this information in the future. The U.S. Supreme
Court recently ruled that it is permissible for law enforcement to collect and re-
tain DNA on suspects, even if the suspects are not subsequently prosecuted [Lip-
tak, 2013]. Once DNA is shed by an individual (such as from saliva left on a
coﬀee cup in a restaurant) it has been legislated as an “abandoned” resource [Joh,
2006], such that the corresponding individual relinquishes rights of ownership.
While the notion of “abandoned DNA” remains a hotly contested issue, it is
currently the case in the U.S. that DNA collected from discarded materials can
be sequenced and used by anyone without the consent of the individual from
which it was derived.
IV Relevance of Genomic Privacy
As discussed in Section II, genomic data has numerous distinguishing features
and applications. As a consequence, the leakage of this information may have
serious implications if misused, as in genetic discrimination (e.g., for insurance,
employment, or education) or blackmail [Gottlieb, 2001]. A true story exempli-
fying genetic discrimination was shared by Dr. Noralane Lindor at the Mayo
8
Clinic’s Individualizing Medicine Conference (2012) [Lindor, 2012]. During her
study of a cancer patient, Dr. Lindor also sequenced the grandchildren of her
patient, two of whom turned out to have the mutation for the same type of
cancer6. One of these grandchildren applied to the U.S. army to become a
helicopter pilot. Even though genetic testing is not a required procedure for
military recruitment, as soon as she revealed that she previously went through
the aforementioned genetic test, she was rejected for the position (in this case
legislation does not apply to military recruitment, as will be discussed below).
Ironically, the familial aspect of genomics complicates the problems revolv-
ing around privacy. A recent example is the debate between the family members
of Henrietta Lacks and the medical researchers [Skloot, 2013]. Ms. Lacks (de-
ceased in 1951) was diagnosed with cervical cancer and some of her cancer cells
were removed for medical research. These cells later paved the way to impor-
tant developments in medical treatment. Recently, researchers sequenced and
published Ms. Lacks’s genome without asking the consent of her living family
members. These relatives learned this information from the author of the best-
selling book “The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks” [Skloot and Turpin, 2010],
and they expressed the concern that the sequence contained information about
her family members. After complaints, the researchers took her genomic data
down from public databases. However, the privacy-sensitive genomic informa-
tion of the members of the Lacks family was already compromised because some
of the data had already been downloaded and many investigators had previously
published parts of the cells’ sequence. Although the NIH entered into an agree-
ment with the Lacks family to give them a voice in the use of these cells [Ritter,
2013], there is no consensus about the scope of control that individuals and their
families ought to have over the downstream of their cells. Thousands of people,
including James Watson [APOC, 2009], have placed their genomic data on the
Web without seeking permission of their relatives.
One of the often voiced concerns regarding genomic data is its potential for
discrimination. While, today, certain genome-disease and genome-trait associ-
ations are known, we do not know what will be inferred from one’s genomic
data in the future. In fact, a grandson of Henrietta Lacks expressed his concern
about the public availability of his grandmother’s genome by saying that “the
main issue was the privacy concern and what information in the future might
be revealed”. Therefore, it is likely that the privacy-sensitivity of genomic data,
and thus the potential threats will increase with time.
Threats emerging from genomic data are only possible via the leakage of
such data, and, in today’s healthcare system, there are several candidates for
the source of this leakage. Genomic data can be leaked through a reckless clini-
cian, the IT of a hospital (e.g., through a breach of the information security), or
the sequencing facility. If the storage of such data is outsourced to a third party,
data can also be leaked from such a database through a hacker’s activity or a
disgruntled employee. Similarly, if the genomic data is stored by the individual
6Having a genetic mutation for cancer only probabilistically increases the predisposition to
cancer.
9
himself (e.g., on his smartphone), it can be leaked due to a malware. Further-
more, surprisingly, sometimes the leakage is performed by the genome owner.
For example, on a genome-sharing website, OpenSNP.org, people upload the
variants in their genomes – sometimes with their identifying material, including
their real names.
One way of protecting the privacy of individuals’ genomic data is through
the law or via policy. In 2007, the U.S. adopted the Genetic Information Nondis-
crimination Act (GINA), which prohibits certain types of discrimination in ac-
cess to health insurance and employment. Similarly, the U.S. Presidential report
on genome privacy [Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues,
2012] discusses policies and techniques to protect the privacy of genomic data.
in 2008, the Council of Europe adopted the convention concerning genetic test-
ing for health purposes [Council of Europe, 2008]. There are, in fact, hundreds
of legal systems in the world, ranging in scope from federal to state / province,
and municipality level and each can adopt diﬀerent deﬁnitions, rights, and re-
sponsibilities for an individual’s privacy. Yet, while such legislation may be put
into practice, it is challenging to enforce because the uses of data cannot always
be detected. Additionally, legal regimes may be constructed such that they are
subject to interpretation or leave loopholes in place. For example, GINA does
not apply to life insurance or the military [Altman and Klein, 2002]. Therefore,
legislation alone, while critical in shaping the norms of society, is insuﬃcient to
prevent privacy violations.
The idea of using technical solutions to guarantee the privacy of such sen-
sitive and valuable data brings about interesting debates. On one hand, the
potential importance of genomic data for mankind is tremendous. Yet, privacy-
enhancing technologies may be considered as an obstacle to achieving these
goals. Technological solutions for genome privacy can be achieved by various
techniques, such as cryptography or obfuscation (proposed solutions are dis-
cussed in detail in Section VII). Yet, cryptographic techniques typically reduce
the eﬃciency of the algorithms, introducing more computational overload, while
preventing the users of such data from “viewing” the data. And, obfuscation-
based methods, reduce the accuracy (or utility) of genomic data. Therefore, es-
pecially when human life is at stake, the applicability of such privacy-enhancing
techniques for genomic data is questionable.
On the other hand, to expedite advances in personalized medicine, genome-
phenome association studies often require the participation of a large number
of research participants. To encourage individuals to enroll in such studies,
it is crucial to adhere to ethical principles, such as autonomy, reciprocity and
trust more generally (e.g., guarantee that genomic data will not be misused).
Considering today’s legal systems, the most reliable way to provide such trust
pledges may be to use privacy-enhancing technologies for the management of
genomic data.
It would severely discredit a medical institution’s reputation
if it failed to fulﬁll the trust requirements for the participants of a medical
study. More importantly, a violation of trust could slow down genomic research
(e.g., by causing individuals to think twice before they participate in a medical
study) possibly more than the overload introduced due to privacy-enhancing
10
technologies. Similarly, in law enforcement, genomic data (now being used in
FBI’s Combined DNA Index System – CODIS) should be managed in a privacy-
preserving way to avoid potential future problems (e.g., mistrials, law suits).
In short, we need techniques that will guarantee the security and privacy of
genomic data, without signiﬁcantly degrading the eﬃciency of the use of genomic
data in research and healthcare. Obviously, achieving all of the aforementioned
properties would require some compromise. Our expert survey (discussed in
Section V) begins to investigate what tradeoﬀs users of such data would consider
appropriate.
V Genomics/Genetics Expert Survey
The ﬁeld of genomics is relatively young and, its privacy implications are still
being reﬁned. Based on informal discussions (primarily with computer scien-
tists), we identiﬁed eight common beliefs. To investigate the extent to which
these beliefs are held by the biomedical community, we designed and obtained
Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval to conduct a survey of biomedi-
cal professionals regarding security and privacy7. Speciﬁcally, the survey was
designed to inquire about (i) widely held beliefs about genome privacy, (ii)
ongoing and existing research directions on genome privacy, and (iii) sharing
of an individual’s genomic data. Several prior surveys focused on genome pri-
vacy have been conducted and have focused on the perspectives of the general
public [Kaufman et al., 2009, 2012; Platt et al., 2013; Cristofaro, 2013] and ge-
neticists [Pulley et al., 2008]. Our survey is novel because it investigates the
opinion of biomedical researchers with respect to the intention of data protec-
tion by technical means. We note that our sample size is suﬃcient to
provide statistically meaningful results. Yet, the main goal of the
expert survey (opinion poll) is to address many confusions computer
scientists have about genomic privacy.
We conducted our survey both online and by paper. Snowball sampling [Good-
man, 1961] was used to recruit subjects for the online survey. This approach en-
ables us to get more responses but the frame is unknown and thus response rate
cannot be reported. We only asked biomedical experts to ﬁll out the survey and
asked them to forward it only to biomedical experts. A URL for the online survey
was sent to the people familiar with genomics/genetics (i.e., molecular biology
professors, bioinformaticians, physicians, genomics/genetics researchers) known
to us and they were asked to forward it to similar people they know. Email
and Facebook were used to conduct the survey. Eight surveys were collected
by handing out paper copies to participants of a genomics medicine conference.
Overall the survey was administered to 61 individuals. Assuming an arbitrarily
large population of people familiar with genetics, this sample size provides a
conﬁdence interval of 12.5 with a conﬁdence level of 95%, as computed using
the formula described in http://goo.gl/krtGGG. Approximately 53% of the
participants were from the US and 45% from Europe (the rest selected “other”).
