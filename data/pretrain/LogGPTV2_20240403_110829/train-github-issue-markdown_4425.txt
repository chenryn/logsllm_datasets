The default Deno NotFound error:
    error: Uncaught NotFound: No such file or directory (os error 2)
Is supremely unhelpful. Yes, I probably should have added more logging or
whatever, but I would really have preferred to see _what_ file my script was
expecting to find and was missing, diagnose the issue and continue, than that
I have to guess at it or add `console.log()`s to find out.
Is it that hard to put the missing path in the error message? It would really
help a lot.
