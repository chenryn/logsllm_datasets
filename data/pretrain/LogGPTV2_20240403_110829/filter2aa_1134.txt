Transcending Cloud Limitations 
by Obtaining Inner Piece 
WITH DEEPACK CHOPPA 
Who am I? 
   I am the terror that flaps in the night 
   The modren man (secret secret) 
   Just this crazy guy, y’know?

Mechanism of Action I 
   SIZE-quota Storage 
   TIME-limit History 
   2 Independent Quota Measurement Dimensions 
   = Unlimited Storage* 
   *Technically limited by provider upload bandwidth 
Mechanism of Action II 
   Storage: 
   Take a large file 
   Cut it up into fragments 
   Upload each fragment as a ‘version’ 
   Top it off with an 0b-sized chunk 
   Retrieval: 
   Pull & concat all ‘versions’ in uploaded order

Vertical Storage Management Framework 
Introducing: DeePack 
Choppa 
What is it? 
   “Pluggable Service Framework” 
   Abstracts out API/Implementation Specifics 
   Maintains storage db backend 
   Provides CLI access to core functions 
Demo 
   It’s been running the whole time 
Aftermath 
What can be done? 
Blue-Team Concerns I 
Detection Method 
   Constantly Rewriting  
Fixed Size/Time/Name 
   API Key Ban Whackamole 
   Null Caps 
Countermeasure 
   Generators to introduce 
variability & flexibility 
   Get a new one 
   1-byte?  
Blue-Team Concerns II 
   Unlimited space undermines business model 
   Barring large binary writes may break existing 
compatibility 
 encfs, git, etc. 
   Deep analysis is time consuming/frowned upon
