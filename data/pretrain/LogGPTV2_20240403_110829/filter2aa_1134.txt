#### Cloud Storage Provider Comparison
| Service | Web Accessible | Free Quota Limit | API Available | History Retention | Quota Counts Î”s |
|---------|----------------|------------------|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| A       | Yes            | 25GB             | Yes           | Yes               | Yes             |
| B       | Yes            | 2GB*             | Yes           | 28 days           | No              |
| C       | Yes            | 5GB              | Yes           | ?                 | ?               |

#### Data Representation
- **Time and Space**: Understand how data is stored and accessed over time and space.
- **Account Use**: Analyze how accounts are utilized in terms of time and space.

#### The Vulnerability
- **Mechanism of Action I**:
  - **SIZE-quota Storage**: Utilize the storage quota effectively.
  - **TIME-limit History**: Manage history retention within the allowed time frame.
  - **Two Independent Quota Measurement Dimensions**: Combine size and time to achieve unlimited storage (technically limited by provider upload bandwidth).

- **Mechanism of Action II**:
  - **Storage**:
    - Take a large file.
    - Cut it into fragments.
    - Upload each fragment as a 'version'.
    - Top it off with a 0-byte-sized chunk.
  - **Retrieval**:
    - Pull and concatenate all 'versions' in the uploaded order.

#### Enlarged to Show Texture
- **Time Representation II**: Detailed visualization of time and space usage.
- **Account Use**: Enhanced understanding of account utilization.

#### Vertical Storage Management Framework
- **Introducing DeePack Choppa**:
  - **Pluggable Service Framework**: Abstracts out API and implementation specifics.
  - **Maintains Storage DB Backend**: Ensures data integrity and accessibility.
  - **Provides CLI Access to Core Functions**: Simplifies user interaction.

#### Demo
- **Live Demonstration**: DeePack Choppa has been running throughout this presentation.

#### Aftermath
- **What Can Be Done?**
  - **Blue-Team Concerns I**:
    - **Detection Method**: Constantly rewriting fixed-size/time/name.
    - **API Key Ban Whackamole**: Frequent key bans.
    - **Null Caps**: Handling null capacities.
  - **Countermeasure**:
    - **Generators to Introduce Variability and Flexibility**: Enhance security.
    - **Get a New One**: Regularly update keys.
    - **1-byte?**: Consider minimal increments.

- **Blue-Team Concerns II**:
  - **Unlimited Space Undermines Business Model**: Potential revenue loss.
  - **Barring Large Binary Writes May Break Existing Compatibility**: Impact on tools like encfs, git, etc.
  - **Deep Analysis is Time-Consuming/Frowned Upon**: Balancing thoroughness and efficiency.

#### Special Thanks
- **Randy Fortier**: For original security interest.
- **Sarah Harvey**: For encouraging a DEFCON talk.
- **Tao Wang**: For supporting the pursuit of innovation.
- **Marlinspike, Schneier, Goldberg, DT et. al.**: For their contributions to the field.
