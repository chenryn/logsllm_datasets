**Applies to:**
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
The `binary` command sets the file transfer type to binary. The FTP protocol supports both ASCII (default) and binary image file transfer types. It is recommended to use binary mode when transferring executable files, as it ensures that the file is transferred in one-byte units without any modifications.

**Syntax:**
```plaintext
binary
```

**Examples:**
To set the file transfer type to binary, enter the following command:
```plaintext
binary
```

**Explanation:**
- **ASCII Mode:** This is the default file transfer type. It is suitable for text files but may alter non-text files during transfer.
- **Binary Mode:** This mode is used for transferring files that are not plain text, such as executable files, images, or compressed archives. In binary mode, the file is transferred in its original format, ensuring no data corruption.

By using the `binary` command, you can switch the FTP session to binary mode, which is essential for maintaining the integrity of non-text files during transfer.
