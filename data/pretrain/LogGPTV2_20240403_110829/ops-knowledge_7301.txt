User: How to achieve failover and ensure business continuity?
Assistant: Failover refers to automatically or manually transferring the workload of the system to the standby system or standby equipment when the system fails, so as to ensure business continuity and high availability. Here are several ways to achieve failover and ensure business continuity: 1. Redundant backup: By adding a backup system or backup device next to the primary system or device, when the primary system or device fails, the backup system or device is automatically activated. device for failover. For example, adding redundant database servers or spare hard drives, etc. 2. Load balancing: distribute business requests to multiple servers or devices. When one server or device fails, other servers or devices will automatically undertake the remaining business requests. For example, use a load balancer to distribute requests across multiple web servers. 3. Cluster: Multiple servers or devices form a cluster. When a server or device fails, other servers or devices automatically undertake related services to realize failover. For example, use clusters that back up each other to support database servers. 4. Automatic fault detection: use automatic detection technology to detect system or equipment faults, and automatically transfer to the backup system or equipment when a fault is detected. For example, use heartbeat detection to detect system status. 5. Backup data: keep backups of key data, and use the backup data to restore business when the primary data fails. For example, use a backup database to restore a failed database. 6. Hot backup: keep the redundant system or equipment in running state. At this time, the standby system or equipment is ready to take over business requests. When the main system or equipment fails, it will automatically transfer to the standby system or equipment. For example, a storage array system that uses hot spares. In short, to achieve failover, it is necessary to select an appropriate failover strategy based on specific business and system requirements, combined with system architecture, equipment configuration, disaster recovery plan, and emergency plan, to ensure business continuity and high availability.
