title:botconf2018 Everything Panda Banker
The Panda Banker malware was first spotted in the wild in early 2016. It has since seen consistent development, gained a significant threat actor user base, and has become one of the most advanced and persistent banking malwares in the current threat landscape. This presentation compiles together the author’s research and tracking of Panda Banker complemented with the prior work of other malware researchers studying the threat. Its aim is to provide a detailed survey of everything Panda Banker: what it is, where did it come from, what it does, how it works, who’s using it, how effective they are, who is being targeted, and where is it going. The hope is for researchers and defenders to walk away with a better understanding of Panda Banker and maybe some ideas on how to better detect and mitigate it.
