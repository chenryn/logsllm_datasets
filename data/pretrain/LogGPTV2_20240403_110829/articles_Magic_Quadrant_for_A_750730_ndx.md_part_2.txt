of Elastic’s customers are split between the Americas and EMEA. Elastic’s product
roadmap includes improved support for OpenTelemetry, security use cases and AI.
Strengths
■ Unified agent: In 2021, Elastic launched a new unified agent to simplify installation
and configuration of large numbers of agents, with integrated security capabilities.
Gartner, Inc. | G00750730 Page 10 of 37
This research note is restricted to the personal use of hao.xiangshan@yottabyte.cn.
■ Open source: Elastic has long been known as a strong proponent of open-source
software (OSS) and contributes to many projects, including OpenTelemetry. This
enables clients to start with their own small deployments, which may grow to take
advantage of commercial offerings.
■ Deployment models: Elastic offers on-premises and cloud-based versions of its APM
and observability products, with broad feature parity between the two.
Cautions
■ Market awareness: Elastic is best known for log analysis; many clients and existing
customers of Elastic are unaware of the capabilities beyond its core area.
■ Pricing estimate: In contrast with other vendors in this market, Elastic bases its
pricing model on compute resources. Although Elastic offers a pricing calculator,
comparison during procurement or review, and forecasting of costs and budgets, can
be challenging.
■ Architecture complexity for on-premises deployment: The deployment of Elastic
Stack for on-premises environments can be complex, requiring high levels of skill to
implement and operate at scale. It also requires significant manual tuning to support
large volumes of data storage.
Honeycomb
Honeycomb is a Leader in this Magic Quadrant. Honeycomb’s service comprises a data
store and query engine optimized for exploratory identification and investigation of
patterns and anomalies in application and infrastructure telemetry. Honeycomb is thus
more observability-focused than APM and is delivered as a SaaS product. Its clients are
global, but are concentrated in North America and EMEA. Recent updates have
strengthened support for OpenTelemetry, added an API for data exchange and introduced
metrics. Honeycomb’s roadmap includes a service-mapping capability, service-level
objective (SLO) enhancements and tailoring the product for enterprise use.
Strengths
■ Innovative analytics: Honeycomb enables operators to quickly identify interesting
anomalies in the collected telemetry. In particular, the “BubbleUp” tool is a novel
innovation that visually represents data in a heat map in a way that clearly identifies
correlated anomalies, enabling the operator to interactively explore the different
dimensions of this data. This reduces the amount of time the operator needs to
spend manually analyzing the data.
Gartner, Inc. | G00750730 Page 11 of 37
This research note is restricted to the personal use of hao.xiangshan@yottabyte.cn.
■ Integrated reliability workflows: Honeycomb includes native support for defining
service-level indicators (SLIs) and measuring service-level objectives (SLOs) and
burn rate in a way that ties them directly to the telemetry that defines them and
informs cause analysis.
■ Community engagement: Honeycomb’s commitment to community building and
outreach efforts are noteworthy. Some of these efforts include a free tier of service,
community events, open office hours and one book (so far). The modern use of
observability outside of its control theory origins can largely be traced to
Honeycomb’s founders.
Cautions
■ Single location: Honeycomb’s service is delivered from the AWS us-east-1 (Northern
Virginia) region. This may prove limiting in the future, not only from a latency
perspective, but because there may be organizations for which secure tenancy is not
sufficient or that want an observability platform closer to their applications.
■ Uniqueness of offering: Honeycomb’s product differs significantly from traditional
APM solutions, making it difficult for end users to explain its purpose as part of the
business case to obtain approval to procure it.
■ Pricing rigidity: The tiered pricing plan is rigidly volume-based between tiers.
Demands for flexibility are likely to increase as the customer base grows.
IBM (Instana)
IBM is a Leader in this Magic Quadrant. IBM acquired Instana in 2020, and its Instana
APM product is offered as a SaaS product and as a self-hosted option, using a single-
agent architecture. Its operations are mostly focused in North America and Western
Europe, with a smaller number of clients in other regions. Its client base is midsize-to-large
enterprises. IBM’s position and capacity in monitoring has substantially improved with its
recent acquisitions. IBM Instana’s roadmap includes further integration for Turbonomic
(another acquisition) and IBM Z Mainframe, as well as further support for OpenTelemetry
and Kubernetes.
Strengths
■ Simple pricing model: IBM Instana’s pricing model, based on a per-host metric, is
straightforward to understand and is competitively priced in the market. Pricing
varies for the SaaS version, compared with the on-premises model, and list prices are
available on the Instana website.
Gartner, Inc. | G00750730 Page 12 of 37
This research note is restricted to the personal use of hao.xiangshan@yottabyte.cn.
■ IBM client base: The IBM acquisition gives Instana access to a wider audience and a
larger sales team. It also enables Instana to target legacy IBM installations for
modernization.
■ Designed for modern architectures: Instana APM is focused on monitoring for
containerized and hybrid environments and is suitable for clients looking for an APM
solution, with an emphasis on monitoring modern infrastructure.
Cautions
■ No synthetics, no integrated security: Instana APM has no integrated synthetic
monitoring, relying instead on third-party tools, such as Apica, to provide this
functionality. An integrated synthetics tool is on the IBM Instana roadmap. Similarly,
Instana lacks an integrated security tool, so it relies on other IBM tools, such as
StackRox, to provide such functionality.
■ Unclear transition from legacy IBM: There are still large deployments of legacy IBM
monitoring tools, including those from the Tivoli portfolio. Clients are unsure of the
upgrade paths available to them, and the value of upgrading remains unclear. IBM
has initiated activities to help clients with the transition process.
■ Lack of ServiceNow integration: Unlike most tools, Instana does not have an out-of-
the-box offering to integrate with ServiceNow, the leading IT service management
(ITSM) solution on the market. Instead, it relies on custom integration via webhooks.
Logz.io
Logz.io is a Visionary in this Magic Quadrant. Its APM and observability product set
includes distributed tracing, infrastructure monitoring and log management. Logz.io
leverages the Prometheus-compatible M3DB for metrics and OpenSearch for logs and
traces. OpenTelemetry is used to collect trace data, which is visualized in Jaeger. A cloud
security information and event management (SIEM) capability is available as well. All are
delivered as SaaS-only solutions, hosted in multiple cloud providers. Its operations are
geographically diversified, and its clients tend to be open-source-friendly enterprises of
any size. Logz.io’s roadmap includes a simplified agent architecture, service mapping and
improved AI/ML. Digital experience monitoring is also planned.
Strengths
Gartner, Inc. | G00750730 Page 13 of 37
This research note is restricted to the personal use of hao.xiangshan@yottabyte.cn.
■ Open source: Logz.io heavily leverages OSS throughout its product set. It
demonstrates how organizations interested in following a similar path for their own
use can better understand the capabilities of the components. Organizations that
have found self-managing these tools to be onerous and costly may wish to migrate
to Logz.io to reduce their overhead.
■ Geographic footprint: With at least two points of presence in each of the North
America, EMEA and the APAC regions distributed across two cloud providers, Logz.io
offers wide geographic diversity and support for data sovereignty.
■ Cost-effective data management: With Logz.io’s Smart Tier, as log data is ingested
or aged, it can be placed into one of three tiers that help balance availability,
performance and cost.
Cautions
■ UI consistency: Because Logz.io is literally a collection of OSS deployed together,
variations in user interface (UI) as you switch between perspectives are apparent,
and may be confusing to end users.
■ Forked open source: To create the Logz.io products, many of the underlying open-
source components have been forked, although to what degree is unclear. This has
the potential to create latency in the incorporation of security remediations.
■ Agent sprawl: As currently implemented, separate client-side agents may be required
to transmit different types of telemetry to the Logz.io platform. For example,
Prometheus or Telegraf for time series, Fluentd or Fluent Bit for log data, and an
OpenTelemetry collector for traces. This increases complexity and adds to
administrative burden.
ManageEngine
ManageEngine is a Niche Player in this Magic Quadrant. The company is the IT
management division of privately held Zoho Corp., and its Applications Manager and
Site24x7 products focus on on-premises and SaaS deployments, respectively. The
company’s operations are geographically diversified, and its clients tend to be small or
midsize businesses (SMBs). ManageEngine’s roadmap includes a focus on increasing its
support for OpenTelemetry as a standard, improving log file analysis, expanding DEM
capabilities, and integrating AIOps for analysis and noise reduction.
Strengths
Gartner, Inc. | G00750730 Page 14 of 37
This research note is restricted to the personal use of hao.xiangshan@yottabyte.cn.
■ Investment from parent company: Zoho, the parent company of ManageEngine, is
making a number of investments in AI solutions, from which ManageEngine should
benefit.
■ SMB-optimized option: ManageEngine’s products are competitively priced and
straightforward to implement for smaller enterprises with limited budgets and staff.
■ Ecosystem of tools: ManageEngine’s portfolio of products extends the company’s
capabilities beyond APM to include IT operations functions, such as network
monitoring, infrastructure and ITSM help desk.
Cautions
■ Scalability: ManageEngine solutions have a small market footprint and are rarely
seen in large organizations. Gartner clients have mentioned issues with scaling the
solution for complex and/or large environments.
■ Variable integration capability: ManageEngine has a long list of integrations, but
many are limited in scope, making integrations with other areas of IT, such as
DevOps toolchains, lengthy and more complex.
■ Immature analytics: The lack of integrated AI/ML capabilities in ManageEngine’s
offering was apparent during this research. This is an area in which it noticeably
lags the competition.
Microsoft
Microsoft is a Challenger in this Magic Quadrant. Its Azure Monitor includes Application
Insights for APM and Log Analytics for observability. Delivery is via SaaS. As the
Microsoft Azure-native monitoring solution, there is substantial geographic diversity, and
clients tend to be midsize-to-large enterprises. Microsoft’s APM roadmap includes broader
support for OpenTelemetry, managed Prometheus and Grafana, and advanced problem
analysis based on AI. Microsoft’s roadmap also includes enhancing synthetic monitoring
with screen capture and increasing support for on-premises and multicloud observability
with Azure ARC.
Strengths
■ Service mapping: Application Map automatically creates a topological
representation of distributed applications and their dependencies. Nodes on the map
provide health and status information, and support drill-down to additional levels of
detail.
Gartner, Inc. | G00750730 Page 15 of 37
This research note is restricted to the personal use of hao.xiangshan@yottabyte.cn.
■ Data analytics: Microsoft Azure Monitor Log Analytics enables the interactive
exploration of ingested telemetry, using a language called KQL. Most APM use cases
require only Application Insights, but more-complex problem identification and
behavior analysis may require the use of KQL.
■ Consumption-based pricing: Microsoft Azure Monitor pricing is based primarily on
daily ingested data, which customers can manage, depending on the type and
amount of data being ingested into the Azure Monitoring platform, especially for
larger deployments.
Cautions
■ Limited adoption of monitoring outside of Azure: Microsoft has positioned Azure
Monitor as a solution for monitoring workloads hosted outside Azure and those
hosted in other cloud providers. Adoption of Azure Monitor for use outside of Azure
has been limited, and potential clients should carefully evaluate whether Azure
Monitor can provide the same benefits as a dedicated solution.
■ Cost predictability: Azure Monitor is priced based on consumption, as is common
with public-cloud-based services. The number of consumable services and the
complexity of the levers involved makes comparison with other vendors difficult.
■ UI complexity: Microsoft Azure Monitor’s UI has remained similar to previous years,
and is falling behind competing products. Customer feedback states that the UI and
the product lack intuitive workflows.
New Relic
New Relic is a Leader in this Magic Quadrant. Its New Relic One platform covers many
areas of observability, including infrastructure, APM and DEM. Its operations are
geographically diversified, and its customers tend to be midsize-to-large enterprise
organizations. New Relic’s roadmap focuses on improving integration with the application
development life cycle and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) tools, a
new security offering, and enhanced integrations with hyperscalers and other partners.
Strengths
■ Business model and pricing: New Relic offers a clearly differentiated and disruptive
pricing model in the field that has contributed to its recent growth in the number of
accounts. Pricing is based on the number of users and the volume of telemetry
ingested, which overcomes many of the challenges associated with element-based
pricing. This model is increasingly resonating with clients looking to manage ever-
increasing monitoring bills.
Gartner, Inc. | G00750730 Page 16 of 37
This research note is restricted to the personal use of hao.xiangshan@yottabyte.cn.
■ Developer tools: Launched in early 2022, the core user license is targeted at
developers and is based on its CodeStream acquisition. Developers can investigate
problems in production from their usual integrated development environment (IDE),
allowing tighter integration between the production and development worlds.
■ Support for open standards: New Relic has added enhanced support for a number
of open standards, including OpenTelemetry, eBPF and Grafana. This move away
from proprietary standards provides clients with greater flexibility in their
deployments.
Cautions
■ Security product: At the time of research, New Relic did not have a security product
as part of its portfolio. In May 2022, New Relic announced its new Vulnerability
Management tool.
■ Licensing confusion: Most enterprises will purchase either the Pro or Enterprise
license type from New Relic. However, Gartner clients have indicated that they are
unsure which of the two license types is correct for them, leading to clients either
under- or overprovisioning. In addition, there is no way to mix the two license types,
which some clients find frustrating.
■ Log management: New Relic have recently changed its log tool to automatically
collect log files where the APM agent is deployed. Although this will allow for greater
insights by combining application logs with APM metrics, clients should ensure that
New Relic’s security controls are correctly enabled so that sensitive data (e.g.,
financial or health information) isn’t inadvertently collected. They should also
monitor telemetry consumption, because log files are significantly more verbose
than metric data.
Oracle
Oracle is a Niche Player in this Magic Quadrant. Its Oracle Cloud Observability and
Management (O&M) platform is a SaaS solution that supports database, infrastructure
and APM generally within the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and enterprise applications
customer base. Its operations are geographically diversified, and its clients tend to be
midsize-to-large organizations, including government agencies. The roadmap for O&M
APM, a relatively new product, includes augmented ML/AI-based anomaly detection and
improved support for hybrid and multicloud workloads.
Strengths
Gartner, Inc. | G00750730 Page 17 of 37
This research note is restricted to the personal use of hao.xiangshan@yottabyte.cn.
■ Flexible ingestion: In addition to its own agents, tracers and APIs, O&M supports
ingesting telemetry in industry-standard formats, such as OpenMetrics
(Prometheus), OpenTelemetry and OpenTracing.
■ Broad geographic coverage: Because of Oracle’s worldwide, direct presence,
customers and prospects can access O&M services on a wide geographic basis.
■ Full-featured synthetic monitoring: O&M includes extremely flexible synthetic
monitoring that supports browser and API-based, multistep transactions.
Cautions
■ Limited APM-specific go-to-market: OCI is the full suite of Oracle cloud
infrastructure services, and O&M is the full OCI monitoring platform. Its APM product
is a small part of this broader platform. Similar to other third-party APM providers, it
does not have a specific go-to-market (GTM) strategy. This may limit the broader
growth potential of O&M outside the OCI ecosystem.
■ Oracle-centric pricing model: As with other portfolio vendors with vast product
offerings, Oracle’s pricing model of universal credits is optimized for its customer
base, limiting the appeal for non-Oracle customers and prospects looking for stand-
alone APM solutions.
■ Language support: The set of languages for which a native agent is available
comprises Java, JavaScript (Node), .NET (CLR) and Ruby.
Riverbed (Aternity)
Riverbed (Aternity) is a Niche Player in this Magic Quadrant. Aternity, launched as a
separate entity in 2019, was recently reunified with Riverbed. Aternity’s Digital Experience
Management platform is focused on endpoint visibility, as well as back-end
instrumentation. Its operations focus mainly on North America, with an additional market
in Europe and Australia/New Zealand. Its clients tend to be midsize-to-large organizations.
Aternity’s roadmap for APM is focused heavily on unified observability, with a combined
offering from Riverbed and Aternity. The company also plans to add continued
enhancement support for open telemetry and serverless environments.
On 28 April, Riverbed announced a new product offering Alluvio, which will comprise
elements of Aternity, combined with Riverbed NPM and ITIM. Alluvio was not evaluated
for this research.
Strengths
Gartner, Inc. | G00750730 Page 18 of 37
This research note is restricted to the personal use of hao.xiangshan@yottabyte.cn.
■ Benchmarking of data: Aternity provides benchmark data for various metrics that
enable clients to easily see where and how they compare with their peers. These can
be viewed by industry, geography and other categories.
■ DEM capability and focus: Aternity has extensive DEM agent-based capabilities that,
when integrated with the company’s APM functionality, provide an end-to-end view
of application traffic and detailed endpoint visibility.
■ Integration: Bringing Aternity back into the Riverbed portfolio creates opportunities
to grow through customer base expansion and greater access to additional
development and operational resources.
