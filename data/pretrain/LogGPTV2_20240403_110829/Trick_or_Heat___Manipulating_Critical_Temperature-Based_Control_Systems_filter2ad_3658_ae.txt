technique allows for a “tunable filter", which we can utilize for a
tunable detector. Once the signal is digitally converted, amplitude
and phase information of the malicious signals at the intermediate
frequency can be then analyzed by the processor: (1) providing
feedback on the temperature data reliability, (2) allowing the es-
timation of the measurement error, and (3) compensating it at the
software level. The detector can be periodically activated when a
temperature measurement is required. A variable oscillator can be
used to select multiple vulnerable frequency bands.

and instrumentation amplifiers used in temperature-based control
systems.
Delsing et al. [35] and Esteves et al. [37] empirically observed the
general reaction of specific cyber-physical systems under strong in-
terference. Delsing et al. verified the susceptibility of a MULLE node
sensor network [48]. They observed disturbances in the Bluetooth
communication, data losses and occasionally rebooting of the sensor
network node. They also tested the sensor interface using a temper-
ature sensor, revealing a vulnerability of the device due to the use of
a long non-shielded connection between the sensor and the MULLE-
device. Esteves et al. investigated a common-off-the-shelf (COTS)
civilian quadricopter. They listed several reading errors induced
in the drone sensors and interfaces by continuous interference,
without exploring the causality of the measured effect.
Recent studies [33, 70, 71] investigated the injection of strong
near-field interference to modify the input voltage of GPIO pins
in microcontrollers. In particular, the authors used EMI injection
to induce a rectification effect in the Electr-Static Discharge (ESD)
protection circuit. The ESD protection circuit is used in microcon-
trollers GPIO pins to prevent the ADCs to be exposed to out-of-band
input voltage when connected to an external analog or a digital
sensor. In contrast with these works, our rectification attack directly
affects the sensor amplification stage, and in particular the internal
transistors in analog sensor amplifiers, before the connection with
a microcontroller or the analog-to-digital conversion stage. In ad-
dition, instrumentation and operational amplifiers that work with
low bias currents such as in temperature sensors, often do not im-
plement external ESD protection circuits at the amplifier input,
but only external current limiting resistors [32]. This approach is
used because it provides adequate protection against overvoltage,
it does not provoke high current leakage at increasing temperature
as it happens using ordinary diodes, and the resistors are already
present in the signal conditioning chain, since they constitute part
of the low-pass filters used to reject differential and common-mode
noise.
Physical-level Attacks on Sensors. Sensors are fundamental for
cyber-physical systems such as autonomous vehicles, drones, and
medical devices. Existing security studies on sensors have shown
how they can be compromised by different kinds of signal injections
other than EMI such as mechanical waves (i.e. sound), and light.
For instance, by injecting different types of light signal using lasers,
Park et al. [64] compromised medical infusion pumps to make them
over/under-infuse, while Petit et al. [66] and Shin et al. [72] generate
fake obstacles in LiDARs systems for automotive applications. Other
works demonstrate how intense acoustic waves can incapacitate
or manipulate some models of micro-electro-mechanical systems
(MEMS) inertial sensors [73, 76, 77, 80], while Zhang et al. [86] used
ultrasonic waves to send inaudible commands to voice assistance
systems, such as Google Home and Alexa. Similar to our work,
these attacks modulate the malicious signal on top of a carrier
to infiltrate the system. However, they exploit different physical
phenomena, such as the demodulation effect, or aliasing, rather than
rectification. For this reason, defenses that mitigate these effects
might be not sufficient to mitigate rectification attacks, since the
physics principle exploited is different.

the thermal chamber. In this simulation, our detector can detect
signals from 550 MHz to 1 GHz - the range which major affected
the sensor (shown in Fig. 6). The simulation was designed using
the Simulink environment [16], and consists of an LNA filter with
50 dB gain 3-order Butterworth band-pass filter, followed by a
mixer block to down-convert the simulated EMI frequency to an
IF frequency of 400 MHz, and an IR filter for filtering the spectral
image components. Then, a subsequent 3-order Butterworth IF filter
block is followed by an IF amplifier block with 100 dB gain and a
noise figure of 2.5 dB. An RF Blockset testbench is used to simulate
the EMI injection attack with an emitting power of 35 dBm.
To evaluate our design, we use a Software-Defined Radio (SDR)
RTL-SDR device [61]. We choose the Realtek RTL2832U chipset
with the R820T2 tuner chip that can detect frequencies from 500
kHz up to 1.75 GHz. An RF exposed connection, collocated with the
temperature sensor breakout board, is followed by an RF filter and
an LNA amplifier at 50 dB. A mixer with a local oscillator is used
for the frequency transposition. The detector also uses Automatic
Gain Control (AGC), where the gain varies with the available input
power level. As a proof of concept demonstration, we successfully
selectively detect a malicious signal at a 3 meter distance from
the transmitting antenna, in open air, at a frequency of 503 MHz
(corresponding to one of the major effective peaks in Fig. 6). The
signal is down-converted to 400 MHz (as shown in Fig. 15). By
varying the local oscillators frequency, the detector can also isolate
the other vulnerable frequency bands.
7 RELATED WORK
Analog sensor circuits are especially susceptible to EMI. Various
works demonstrate the exploitability of the non-linearities of dif-
ferent circuit components to cause system malfunctions or sensor
misreadings (see Table 2).
Foo Kune et al. [56] showed that bogus signals can be injected
through low-power EMI into analog sensors such as microphones,
and implantable medical devices such as pacemakers and defibrillat-
ors. Their attack method exploited the generation of sub-harmonics
of injected high frequency signals passing through common circuit
components (e.g. wires, capacitors, amplifiers, and ADCs). This un-
intentional demodulation effect down-converts the high frequency
signals into low frequency ones. In turn, these low frequency sig-
nals are able to pass the protective low-pass filters and enter into
the system, compromising its functionality. In automotive field,

injecting strong interference, causing sensor denial-of-service in
cars. Unlike these previous works, our EMI injection exploits the

8 DISCUSSIONS
8.1 Limitations
In our study we only consider commercial temperature-based sys-
tems that use analog temperature sensors. Our analysis focuses
on low-power attacks (less than 4 W) in the Ultra High Frequency
range (UHF) 300 MHz - 3 GHz. These assumptions are acceptable
considering that our work shows how the rectification attack can
be successful with a low-power injection, even if the target system
already employs traditional EMI defenses. Also, we assume that an
adversary can attempt the attack with little effort by building a small
device or modifying a commercial system (e.g. a walkie-talkie) that
can emit EMI signals in the vulnerable frequency range. Although
the attack distance can be increased with specialized equipment
and higher transmitting power, our goal is to demonstrate that
simple amplitude-modulated EMI can induce a controllable voltage
offset in temperature sensing circuits large enough to deceive and
manipulate a target system.
To improve the attack success rate, an adversary might need
some additional information regarding the target device, such as
the presence of automatic temperature alarms and their threshold
values. These information can be retrieved from the publicly avail-
able manuals and datasheets of the target system.
During our experiments, we observe that the amount of induced
DC offset can be affected by various factors, including the noise
rejection circuitry and shield used in the target system, the charac-
teristics of the antenna used to perform the attack (e.g., directional,
monopole, etc.) and its orientation with respect to the target device.
In addition, to optimize the attack effect, the adversary often needs
to position the antenna to target the parts of the victim system that
are usually more susceptible (e.g., the temperature sensor trans-
ducer, the control panel, etc.).
8.2 Attack Generalization
By exploiting this hardware-level vulnerability, adversaries could
also affect systems equipped with different classes of sensors that
use similar signal conditioning processes. For example, we find
that pressure or pH sensors may also be susceptible to adversarial
control through rectification attacks, since the transducer signal of

these sensors is weak and requires an amplification stage similar
to temperature sensors.
Pressure Sensor. Scales use pressure sensors to measure the weight
of an object. Sensor wires distributed inside of the device can make
it vulnerable to EMI injection. We test a CGOLDENWALL high-
precision lab digital scale that has an accuracy of 0.01 g, which
can be used in jewelry, laboratory measurements. We are able to
decrease the reading of the scale by 6.37 g at a distance of 0.5 m
with an attack frequency of 685 MHz. We also test an Escali L600
L-Series High Precision Lab Scale. At an attack distance of 0.5 m,
we can decrease the reading of the scale by 7 g, or increase the
reading by 13.9 g. Using the same attack technique we show in this
work, adversaries might be able to spoof the pressure or force meas-
urement in data acquisition or control systems to cause unexpected
consequences.
PH Sensor. A pH meter measures a low-level difference in elec-
trical potential between a pH electrode and a reference electrode.
We test an Apera Instruments PH700 Benchtop Lab pH Meter that
has an accuracy of 0.01 pH. At an attack distance of 0.5 m, we
can increase the measured pH value by 0.42 with EMI signal in-
jections at a frequency of 515 MHz. PH sensors can be used in
closed-loop control in SCADA systems such as water treatment
facilities. Adversaries might attempt to manipulate the actual pH
value to damage the facilities of such systems by exploiting pH
sensors.
9 CONCLUSION
Temperature-based control systems fundamentally rely on sensors
to make critical decisions. So it is important to assess and improve
the resilience of the system in situations when temperature sensors
could be compromised. This work showed how adversaries can ma-
nipulate these systems to cause unexpected consequences, without
tampering with the victim system or triggering temperature alarms.
The attack leveraged an unintended rectification effect in ampli-
fiers to control the DC voltage of temperature sensor signals. We
validated the attack on sensors and investigated the threat on sev-
eral real-world temperature control systems. Our experimental
results showed that these systems blindly trust spoofed temperat-
ure sensor readings, leading to manipulated decision makings of a
victim system. To mitigate the risks, we discussed several conven-
tional defensive techniques, and proposed a prototype design of
