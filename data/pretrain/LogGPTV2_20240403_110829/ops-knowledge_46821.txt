Question: You are tasked with testing the security of a web application that uses GraphQL. During this process, you decide to utilize introspection queries to gather more information about the GraphQL schema. Which of the following statements best describes the reason for using introspection queries in this context and identifies a potential security implication?
"A": "Introspection queries are used to determine the GraphQL schema's efficiency and performance characteristics, potentially exposing the application to denial of service attacks.",
"B": "Introspection queries are used to retrieve the supported queries, data types, and schema details of the GraphQL deployment, possibly revealing sensitive information that could be exploited by attackers.",
"C": "Introspection queries are primarily used for search optimization within the application, providing little to no security risk.",
"D": "Introspection queries are used to modify the GraphQL schema at runtime, which could lead to unauthorized data alterations if not properly secured."
Answer: B
