**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Native API

Adversaries may directly interact with the native operating system (OS) application programming interface (API) to access low-level system functions. Native APIs provide a controlled mechanism for calling OS services within the kernel, such as those related to hardware, devices, memory, and processes. These APIs are utilized by the OS during system boot, when other system components have not yet been initialized, and during routine operations to handle various tasks and requests.
