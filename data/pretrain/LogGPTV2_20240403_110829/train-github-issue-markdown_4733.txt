### Current Behavior:
The docs for npm@7 mention hook scripts as a feature:
> If you want to run a specific script at a specific lifecycle event for ALL
> packages, then you can use a hook script.
>
> Place an executable file at `node_modules/.hooks/{eventname}`...
^ https://github.com/npm/cli/blob/latest/docs/content/using-
npm/scripts.md#hook-scripts
### Expected Behavior:
This section should be removed from NPM docs since the hook script
functionality no longer works. It appears to be no longer supported in npm@7,
according to the @npmcli/run-script readme:
> Hook scripts are not run by this module. If the caller wishes to run hook
> scripts, then they can override the default package script with an explicit
> cmd option pointing to the node_modules/.hook/${event} script.
