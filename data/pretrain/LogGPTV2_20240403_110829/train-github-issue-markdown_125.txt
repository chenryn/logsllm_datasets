Subject: Assistance Needed with 'setup.py' Compilation Errors in 'cuda' Directory

Hello,

I recently attempted to compile the `setup.py` file located in the `cuda` directory of the `extension-cpp-master` project. During this process, I encountered two errors, as illustrated in the attached image:

This was done using PyTorch version 1.0.1 on a Windows 7 (x64) system.

Could you please provide some guidance or suggestions on how to resolve these issues?

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Best regards,
