Problem 
• 97% of data breach cases worldwide involve SQL injection 
attacks somewhere down the line. 
• On average the cost of data breach response and 
remediation is between $194 - $222 per record. 
• As of July 9th, privacyrights.org cites 330 breaches in 2012 
effecting 18.6 million records. 
(datalossdb.org reports much higher at 723 breaches thus far)

Fly a bunch of consultants to a data center 
They image the server 
Analyze the logs 
Determine what was exfiltrated from reviewing those 
logs. 
Typically running SQL commands against SQL server 
Only going to get costlier
