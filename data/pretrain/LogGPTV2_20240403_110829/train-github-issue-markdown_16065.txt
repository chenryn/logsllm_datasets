Hi all.  
I was using the class gaussian_kde with a similar code snippet:
density = gaussian_kde(data)  
xs = numpy.linspace(xmin, xmax, 2*len(data))  
ys = density(xs)
the problem is that when data is an array of integers (dunno if it was a numpy
array of ints or a python array of ints) then the array ys contains only
zeros. There must be a division by an integer somewhere. Converting data to an
array of floats solves the problem, but it took me quite some time to
understand what was going on.
