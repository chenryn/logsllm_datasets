COIN [53], which alert registered users whenever another
user in the vicinity takes a photo. In general these studies
fall under the paradigm of relying on the owner’s device to
enforce preferences, and they require people to subscribe to
such a system and convey privacy preferences. Our approach
instead assumes no involvement from people in the photo and
attempts to increase people’s privacy considerations when they
make the decision to share a photo.
In the second category of limiting information in photos,
several prior researchers proposed redaction methods that
are suitable in social-media settings. Li et al. [54] and Sun
et al. [55] proposed several obfuscation methods (such as
blurring, pixelating, and head inpainting) to obscure human
identity. Hassan et al. [56] proposed cartoon transformations
of objects to obscure sensitive elements from a photo. Hasan et
al. reported an experiment where they studied the effectiveness
of obfuscation methods to obscure photo content as well as
the impact of these obfuscations on photo utility [57]. More
recently, Hasan et al. studied relationships among several
utility variables and how they might be boosted to encourage
the use of obfuscation methods [58]. In contrast, our method
is designed to alter user decision making and, in turn, photo-
sharing behavior. However, behavioral interventions that we
study could be applied to decision making related to choosing
privacy enhancing redactions and would be interesting to study
in future work.
E. Pilot study
Prior to the initiation of the current study, a pilot study was
conducted to test the efﬁcacy of our methods and to assess
whether we could inﬂuence photo sharing responses with a
perspective-taking manipulation. We enrolled 166 participants
from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk and assigned them to one
of three conditions: In a baseline condition, participants were
asked while viewing each photo whether they liked the photo
and how likely they would be to share the photo on social
media. More speciﬁcally, participants were asked to rate with
a slider on the screen the likeability of each photo (0 = strongly
dislike to 100 = strongly like), and to rate each photo on
how likely they would be to share it on social media (0 =
not at all likely to 100 = very likely). In the two additional
conditions, participants were asked how likely they would be
to share the photo if it was a photo of them (0 = not at all
likely to 100 = very likely). This reference to themselves was
designed to facilitate perspective taking. In one of these two
conditions, the reference to themselves was limited to the ﬁrst
question asked, which was new and designed to address the
perceived valence of the photo, “If this was a photo of you,
would you view this as negative or positive?” In the second
perspective-taking condition, the reference to themselves was
included with the new question as well as with the two
questions that were used in the baseline condition. It was

unknown prior to this study whether the perspective-taking
reference should be included with every question. The results
conﬁrmed that the perspective-taking manipulation should be
included with every question because it signiﬁcantly increased
the differences between conditions.
The inclusion of the question about the perceived emotional
valence of the photos in the two perspective-taking conditions
enabled us to classify the photos into four categories: very
negative, negative, positive, and very positive. Conceivably,
we could have also added photo valence as a covariate,
but the nonlinear distribution of the scores suggested that a
categorical variable was more appropriate. This classiﬁcation
of the photos proved very informative – the results revealed
that the likelihood of sharing photos differed as a function
of emotional valence. Participants were signiﬁcantly more
likely to share positive than negative photos, and this result
was signiﬁcantly greater for the second perspective-taking
condition than for the baseline condition. In addition, there was
no difference among conditions in the likelihood of sharing
photos that were very negative.
Overall, these results suggested that the method was promis-
ing, but
it was premature to draw any ﬁrm conclusions
because of a few limitations in the design of the study. Most
importantly, the ratings of the perceived emotional valence
of the photos were not
independent of the likelihood to
share scores because the same participants responded to both
questions. Moreover, it was unknown whether asking multiple
questions to each participant could bias their likelihood to
share responses. We suspected that
these limitations were
responsible for not ﬁnding any evidence that the perspective-
taking manipulation would reduce the likelihood of photo shar-
ing relative to the baseline condition, especially for negative
valence photos. In the subsequent research, these problems
were eliminated by ﬁrst conducting a study to independently
collect emotional valence ratings on the photos. This study was
followed by the main study in which participants were asked
only to indicate their likelihood of sharing each photo. Also,
some of the photos were removed and replaced by new photos
to increase the likelihood of a more balanced distribution of
photos ranging from very negative to very positive valences.
Lastly, we suspected that the use of a slider constrained the
range of responses more than expected, and thus decided to
use categorical ratings in future research.
III. CURRENT STUDIES
A. Study 1: Photo Valence Ratings
1) Participants: A preliminary study was used to identify
photo valence, or the extent to which memes portrayed photo
subjects as positive or negative. Four hundred participants were
enrolled from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk online recruitment
system. Participants were eligible to participate in the study if
they were 18 years or older, had been living in the United
States for a minimum of ﬁve years, and used a laptop or
desktop computer to complete the experiment. We followed
the recommended procedures to minimize the chances that
participants were not following our instructions [59]. This
included restricting participation in the survey to workers who
have at least 95% approval ratings and have completed at least
1,000 HITs.
One hundred and seventy-four (43.5%) and 221 (55.3%)
participants identiﬁed themselves as female and male respec-
tively. Participants were divided among four age groups: 150
(37.7%) were 18–29 years old, 210 (52.8%) were aged 30–
49 years old, 25 were 50–64 years old, and 12 participants
were 65 years or older. Sixty-seven percent (267) of the
participants identiﬁed themselves as Caucasian, followed by
Asian (53, 13.3%), Black or African American (31, 7.8%),
American Indian or Alaska Native (19, 4.7%), and Hispanic
or Latino (13, 3.3%). One hundred and sixty-nine participants
(42.04%) had a Bachelor’s degree, 99 (24.63%) had some
college education, 54 (13.43%) were high school graduates
or had a GED, 41 (10.2%) had an Associate’s degree, and 38
(9.45%) had a Master’s degree. Participants had on average
3.2 (SD = 1.58) social media accounts. A majority of the
participants (264, 66.3%) reported that they visit social media
multiple times a day, and the frequency for sharing photos
online had a mode response of ‘multiple times a week’ (96,
24.1%).
2) Stimuli: Ninety-eight publicly-available photos were se-
lected from popular social media sites, including Reddit and
Pinterest, based on the following criteria: First, all photos
included people, hereon referred to as “photo subjects.” Sec-
ond, photos were also accompanied by text with 50 words
or less, which provided context for photos. For example, one
photo portrayed a woman and a man sitting together in a ﬁeld
surrounded by ﬂowers, with text that read “Husband spends
2 years planting thousands of scented ﬂowers for his blind
wife to smell & get her out of depression.” Another photo
included derogatory text directed toward a smiling subject with
bad teeth, saying “9/10 dentists would recommend suicide.”
The text provided a common reference point for interpreting
and evaluating the photos and their subjects. Third, photos
varied in terms of how the photo subjects were portrayed:
Some photo subjects were shown in ways that highlighted
their accomplishments (e.g., completing a degree) or positive
personal traits (e.g., performing an act of care). Other photo
subjects were shown in ways that violated social norms (e.g.,
excessive alcohol
intake) or highlighted negative personal
traits (e.g., clumsiness). Fourth, we excluded photos that
appeared to include children, as well as photos that presented
sexist, racist, or otherwise bigoted messages. Each participant
was presented with all of the photos (in random order).
3) Procedure: All procedures were carried out in accor-
dance with a protocol approved by our institution’s review
board for the conduct of human research. After completing
the informed consent form, participants viewed a sequence
of 98 photos at the top center of their Amazon Mechanical
Turk survey. One question was displayed below each photo,
which asked participants “Does this portray the subject of
the photo negatively or positively?” Participants provided
ratings for each photo using a seven-point Likert scale (-3 =
Extremely negative, -2 = Negative, -1 = Somewhat negative,

Asian, 27 (7.1%) as Black or African American, 16 (4.2%)
as Hispanic or Latino, 18 (4.7%) as biracial or multiracial
or “other,” and six (1.6%) as American Indian. Participants
ranged in education from having some high school education
(0.53%) to having doctoral (0.26%) or professional degrees
(1.1%). The mode for education level was a bachelor’s degree
(44.1%), followed by having completed some college (21.6%),
and then high school graduate or GED (15.31%). Participants
reported having an average of 3.26 (SD = 1.36) social
media accounts. They modally reported visiting those accounts
‘multiple times per week’ (n=267, 61.1%) and sharing photos
through those accounts ‘multiple times per week’ (n = 90,
21.84%).
2) Stimuli and Experimental Manipulation: The 98 photos
from the previous study (including their text captions) were
shown one-at-a-time in random order on Amazon’s Mechani-
cal Turk. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three
conditions (see Table I). In the Baseline condition (n = 126),
participants were asked to respond to the following question
appearing below each photo using a seven-point Likert scale:
“How likely are you to share this photo on social media?”
(-3 = Extremely unlikely to 3 = Extremely likely). In the
Perspective-Taking (PT) condition (n = 126), participants
were asked to put themselves in the position of the photo
subject, “If this was a photo of you, how likely are you to share
this photo on social media?” (-3 = Extremely unlikely to 3 =
Extremely likely). In the Privacy-Perspective (PP) condition
(n = 127), participants were cued to consider the privacy
of the photo subject before rating the likelihood they would
share the photo. They were asked, “Taking into account the
privacy of the person in the photo, how likely are you to
share this photo on social media?” (-3 = Extremely unlikely
to 3 = Extremely likely). A power analysis demonstrated that
a sample size of 48 participants per condition was required
to attain power of .95 using a one-way ANOVA with three
conditions and a projected effect size, ηp
2 = 0.10.
3) Questionnaires: The Social Media Usage Questionnaire
was designed to assess online social-media behavior. Ques-
tions asked participants to indicate the social media platforms
for which they had an account, the extent to which they use
the accounts and post photos, and the content that they and
their friends post on social media websites. For example, one
multiple-choice question asked participants, “How often do
you share photos on social media?” (see Appendix B for the
complete questionnaire).
Fig. 1. Histogram of variances for valence scores per photo.
0 = Neither negative nor positive, 1 = Somewhat positive,
2 = Positive, 3 = Extremely positive). By rating the photo
as positive or negative, participants were providing ratings
of photo “valence,” or the degree to which participants were
portrayed in an aversive or bad way, versus an attractive or
good way. Each participant was paid $3 and the average time
to complete the survey was approximately 36 minutes.
4) Results: Each photo was assigned a valence score by
averaging ratings across participants. The means range from
−1.74 to 2.45 for the 98 photos. The standard deviations
ranged from 0.88 to 1.93 (Figure 1). Notably, the distributions
of responses for each photo revealed that the means were not a
function of a bimodal distribution of scores, but rather were a
function of one or two consecutive Likert ratings constituting
the most frequent response.
Photos were then ordered from most negative to most
positive and divided into four quartiles with regard to how they
portrayed subjects in the photos: very negative (M = −1.15,
SD = 0.34, N = 25), negative (M = −0.29, SD = 0.17,
N = 24), positive (M = 0.38, SD = 0.23, N = 24), or very
positive (M = 1.47, SD = 0.49, N = 25). Perceived valence
ratings obtained from this study were used in the second study
to differentiate photos into four valence categories to assess
whether valence moderates likelihood of sharing responses.
B. Study 2: Behavioral Interventions for Decreasing the Like-
lihood of Photo Sharing
1) Participants: Participants were enrolled from Amazon’s
Mechanical Turk online recruitment system using the same
eligibility criteria described in the previous study. In addition,
participants were excluded if they answered incorrectly on
one or both attention checks, which instructed participants
to provide a speciﬁc Likert-scale response (e.g., “Select the
third option for this question.”). Of the 444 respondents,
379 responded correctly to both attention checks and were
retained for the ﬁnal sample. A majority of participants were
between the ages of 30–49 years (209, 55%), followed by
18–29 years (124, 32.7%), 50–64 years (36, 9.5%), and
65 years or older (10, 2.6%). One hundred and ﬁfty-seven
participants (41.4%) identiﬁed as female and 221 (58.3%)
identiﬁed as male. Two hundred and ﬁfty-one participants
(66.2%) identiﬁed themselves as Caucasian, 61 (16.1%) as

Five questions were designed to assess users’ experiences
