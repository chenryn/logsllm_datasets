Assistant: Server operation and maintenance plan: 1. CPU usage: 80% - Check processes or services with high CPU usage, and optimize or upgrade them. - Optimize system configuration, adjust related parameters, and prevent CPU resource waste. 2. Memory usage: 90% - Check for processes or services with high memory utilization, and optimize or upgrade them. - Clean up memory, release wasted resources, and improve memory utilization efficiency. 3. Hard disk usage: 70% - Delete useless files, perform disk cleanup, and optimize disk space utilization. - Partition or upgrade the hard disk, and put unnecessary files into the lower disk partitions to ensure the stable operation of the system. 4. Frequent errors in the system log - According to the error information, find and fix system problems. - Perform system optimization and configure related parameters to avoid errors. 5. The latest security patches are not installed - Update the system in time and install the latest security patches. - Strengthen system security settings to prevent external attacks and information leakage. Perform maintenance and optimization tasks: - Weekly check CPU, memory, hard disk usage, record historical data and analyze trends. - Analyze the system log every week, record error information and repair it in time. - Conduct monthly security checks on the system, and perform security settings and software updates. - Regular backup of critical data and files to avoid data loss.
