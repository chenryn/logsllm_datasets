4.2 Security Analysis
The anonymous RBAC scheme achieves selective security
and anonymity which are described in Section 3.2 based on
the decision l-BDHE assumption, the BSD assumption , the
l-cDH assumption and the l-cDHE assumption deﬁned in
Section 2. Formally, we have the following Theorems.
Theorem 1. Let G be a group of composite order N =
p · q, equipped with an eﬃcient bilinear map. Suppose that
the Decision (n+2)-BDHE assumption and BSD assumption
holds in G. Then our proposal is semantic secure under the
formal semantic security model deﬁned in Section 3.2.1.
Theorem 2. Let G be a group of composite order N = p·
q, equipped with an eﬃcient bilinear map. Suppose that (n +
1)-cDH assumption and (n + 1)-cDHE assumption holds in
G. Then our proposal is anonymity secure under the formal
anonymity model deﬁned in Section 3.2.2.
We prove Theorem1 and Theorem2 through the following
games between an adversary and a challenger.
• Game1: CT1 = ((C1, C2, C3, ), En)
• Game2: CT2 = ((C1, C2, C3, ), En · Rp)
• Game3: CT3 = ((C1, C2, C3, ), En · R = REn)
• Game4: CT4 = ((R1, C2, C3, ), REn)
• Game5: CT5 = ((R1, R2, R3, ), REn)
where Rp is randomly chosen from GT,p; R, REn are u-
niformly distributed in GT ; R1, R2, R3 are uniformly dis-
tributed in G.
Lemma 1. Let G be a group of composite order N = p · q
If G satisﬁes the
equipped with an eﬃcient bilinear map.
(t, 1, n + 2)-BDHE assumption, then there is no polynomial
time algorithm that can distinguish Game2 from Game1 with
advantage 1.
Lemma 2. Let G be a group of composite order N = p · q
If G satisﬁes the
equipped with an eﬃcient bilinear map.
(t, 2)-BSD assumption, then there is no polynomial time
algorithm that can distinguish Game3 from Game2 with ad-
vantage 2.
If group generator algorithm G
Proof of Theorem 1.
satisﬁes the (t, 1, n + 2)-BDHE assumption and the (t, 2)-
BSD assumption, then Lemma 1 and Lemma 2 show that
there is no polynomial time adversary that makes at most
qs key extraction queries to distinguish Game1 and Game3
with advantage 1 + 2. Ciphertext of Game3 does not leak
any information about the EHR data since the component
regarding to EHR in ciphertext of Game3 is a random group
element. Therefore, if the group G with composite order
N = p · q satisﬁes the (t, 1, n + 2)-BDHE assumption and
the (t, 2)-BSD assumption, then our proposed scheme is
semantic secure with advantage 1 + 2.
Lemma 3. Let G be a group of composite order N = p · q
If G satisﬁes the
equipped with an eﬃcient bilinear map.
(t, 3, n + 1)-cDH assumption, then there is no polynomi-
al time algorithm that can make at most qs key extraction
queries and distinguish Game4 from Game3 with advantage
3/(1 − p+q−1
Lemma 4. Let G be a group of composite order N = p · q
If G satisﬁes the
equipped with an eﬃcient bilinear map.
(t, 4, n + 1)-cDHE assumption, then there is no polynomi-
al time algorithm that can make at most qs key extraction
queries and distinguish Game5 from Game4 with advantage

If group generator algorithm G

satisﬁes the (t, 3, n + 1)-cDH assumption and the (t, 4, n +

that there is no polynomial time adversary that makes at
most qs key extraction queries to distinguishe Game3 and
Game5 with advantage 3/(1− p+q−1
N )qs .
Ciphertext of Game5 does not leak any information about
the roles of medical staﬀ and the identity of patient since the
components regarding to roles and identity in ciphertext of
Game5 are random group elements. Therefore, if the group
G with composite order N = p· q satisﬁes the Decision (n +
2)-BDHE, BSD, (n+1)-cDH and (n+1)-cDHE assumptions,
then our proposed scheme is anonymous with advantage 1 +

In Appendix, we provide the concrete proof steps.
IMPROVING USER EXPERIENCE
5.
For the purpose of perfect user experience, we speed up
the data processing in the procedure of key generation, key
delegation and EHR encapsulation. We apply online/oﬄine
[15] cryptography to our scheme. Online/oﬄine technique is
initiated by Goldreich and Micali [28] for signature scheme.
Guo et al. [12] extents the oﬄine algorithm to the identity-
based encryption system. Brieﬂy speaking, online/oﬄine
technique splits the encryption or key generation process in-
to two phases: the oﬄine phase ﬁrst executes most of heavy
computations by assuming a set of random identities, and
then the online phase only performs light computations to
produce the ciphertext or secret key once the identities are
available.In the oﬄine EHREnc phase, we assume a random
access policy PB with bound B on the maximum number of
atom roles for medical staﬀ. Denote IB = {i : zi ∈ SPB},
where zi are regarded as intermediate atom roles and they
are randomly chosen from ZN . We also assume the inter-
mediate patient identity y where y R← ZN . Next, we create
a ciphertext by encrypting to the intermediate roles and i-
dentity with randomness s R← ZN . The resulting ciphertext
header will have the form C1 = Gs · Z1, C2 = F s · Z2, C3 =
Z3. The oﬄine algorithm stores these ci-
phertext components as well as zi, y and s. These together

online phase, a user (a medical staﬀ or a patient) gets the
actual access policy P and identity Id. The user just need
to add the ”correction factors” s · (Ri − zi) and s · (Id − y)
to the ciphertext components C1, C2, C3. As symmetric en-
cryption time En = SymEnc(K, EHR) is relative fast, the
cost for it can be ignored. The dominant cost in online phase
are (|| (cid:126)P|| + 1) multiplications and subtractions in ZN only.
The online/ oﬄine work for KeyGenM follow the same way.
We assume a random role (cid:126)RB = (x1, x2, ..., xB) for a med-
ical staﬀ, which is used to generate the intermediate secret
key in oﬄine phase. Once the actual role become known, we
assemble the actual secret key in online phase.
The detailed oﬄine and online algorithms are speciﬁed in
full version [32].
6. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
6.1 Theoretical Analysis
Table 2 shows the eﬃciency of our proposed scheme in
details. The system parameter, the master secret key and
secret keys (for medical staﬀ and patients) are linear with
the maximum atom role number. The header only contains
three group elements in G, which achieves constant size ci-
phertext and independent of the maximal depth of the hier-
archy for the access policy set (cid:107)P(cid:107). In Table 2, we denote te
as one exponent operation time in G, tm one multiplication
operation time in G and tp one pairing operation time. In
the procedures of KeyGenM, KeyDelegM, KeyGenP, EHREnc,
exponentiations can be pre-computed by choosing random
exponents.
Table 3 compares four schemes in terms of anonymity, or-
ders of bilinear group and performance. We denote “Ours &
Improved” as our scheme with user experience improvement.
Other symbols have the same meaning as those in Table 2.

6.2 Experimental Performance
We conduct experiment on an Intel Core i7 processor with
8GB RAM and 2.6GHZ CPU clock speed. We use elliptic
curve type A1 with elliptic curve expression y2 = x3 + x for
the Tate symmetric pairing. The group order of ZN is set
1024 bits, and the element size in G is conﬁgured 1024 bits
as well. The experiment is executed with the jPBC library
(http://gas.dia.unisa.it/projects/jpbc/index.html).
We test the operational time for key generation, key del-
egation, EHR encapsulation and decapsulation for medical
staﬀ. The performance results are shown in Figure 3a, Fig-
ure 3b, Figure 3c and Figure 3d. Figure 3e and Figure 3f
show the operational time after user experience is improved.
7. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we propose an anonymous RBAC scheme to
secure identity privacy in EHR system. We achieve ﬂexible
access control, where EHR data can be encapsulated ac-
cording to an on-demand access policy, while only the users
whose roles satisfy the access policy can decapsulate it. Pa-
tient privacy is preserved by using bilinear group with two
subgroups, where one of the subgroups is used for blinding i-
dentities and the other one is used for key generation. Based
on the decisional bilinear group assumptions, we prove that
the proposed model has the property of both semantic se-
curity and anonymity. To achieve better user experience,
we apply “online/ oﬄine” approach to speed up the data
processing in the procedures of key generation and EHR
encapsulation. Experimental results show that the online
performance of our scheme reaches to millisecond-level.
