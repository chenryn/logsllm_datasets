User: Provide an automated deployment solution based on Ansible.
Assistant: The following is an automated deployment solution based on Ansible: 1. Install Ansible Install Ansible on the management node. Depending on the operating system, the specific installation method can refer to the official document: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/index.html 2. Configure Ansible Create an Ansible configuration file on the Ansible management node, usually "ansible.cfg", and define the configuration options of Ansible in it. For example: ``` [defaults] inventory = /etc/ansible/hosts remote_user = deploy private_key_file = /home/deploy/.ssh/id_rsa ``` Here defines the host inventory file, remote user and SSH private key used by Ansible by default . 3. Define the host inventory Create an inventory file on the Ansible management node, usually "hosts", and list all the hosts that need to be managed and their related information. For example: ``` [web] web1.example.com ansible_ssh_host=192.168.1.101 web2.example.com ansible_ssh_host=192.168.1.102 [db] db1.example.com ansible_ssh_host=192.168.1.201 db2.example.com ansible_ ssh_host=192.168. 1.202 [all:vars] ansible_ssh_user=deploy ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa ``` Two host groups are defined here, namely "web" and "db", and the SSH address of each host is specified, as well as Ansible The remote user and SSH private key to use. 4. Write a playbook Create a playbook file on the Ansible management node to perform a series of operations. For example: ``` - name: deploy web servers hosts: web vars: app_name: "myapp" app_version: "1.0" tasks: - name: install required packages yum: name: "{{ item }}" state: present with_items: - httpd - php - name: copy application files copy: src: "{{ app_name }}-{{ app_version }}.tar.gz" dest: /var/www/html/ owner: apache group: apache - name: start httpd service service: name: httpd state: started - name: deploy database servers hosts: db vars: db_name: "mydb" db_user: "dbuser" db_password: "mypassword" tasks: - name: install mysql server yum: name: mysql state : present - name: create database mysql_db: name: "{{ db_name }}" state: present - name: create database user mysql_user: name: "{{ db_user }}" password: "{{ db_password }}" priv: " {{ db_name }}.*:ALL" state: present ``` This playbook defines two parts, namely "deploy web servers" and "deploy database servers". Each section specifies the host group on which the task needs to be performed, along with the variables and task list to be used. In the task list, a series of operations are defined, such as installing software packages, copying files, starting services, and so on. 5. Execute the playbook Use the "ansible-playbook" command to execute the playbook. For example: ``` ansible-playbook deploy.yml ``` This will execute the task list in the playbook on the management node for all hosts that need to be deployed, and automatically complete the deployment.
