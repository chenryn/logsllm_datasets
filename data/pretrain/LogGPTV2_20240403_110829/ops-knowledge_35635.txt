Question: In the design review of a new web application, you are tasked with evaluating statements about the use of reverse DNS resolution for authentication purposes. Which of the following statement(s) correctly reflect the security risks associated with reverse DNS resolution for determining trusted hosts?
"A": "Reverse DNS resolution is an effective standalone security measure for authenticating hosts because DNS records are well-protected against tampering.",
"B": "The possibility of DNS cache poisoning undermines the reliability of reverse DNS resolution as a security measure, leading to potential bypass of authentication.",
"C": "Reverse DNS resolution should be used in conjunction with other authentication methods, such as IP address verification, to enhance security.",
"D": "Security decisions should not be based on the outcome of reverse DNS resolution alone due to the potential for attackers to control or spoof DNS records."
