Please describe how to reproduce this issue, and include links to screenshots
if possible.
My code:
    function palindrome(str) {
        console.log(str);
      str = str.replace(/[ ,.]/ig, "").toLowerCase();
      console.log(str);
      for (var i = 0, j = str.length -1 ; i  this is not a palindrome '_' v.s. '-' even
If I replaced that the str that gets passed in as a param is not "0_0 (: /-\
:) 0-0" console.log says it's "0_0 (: /- :) 0-0" it's missing the ""
