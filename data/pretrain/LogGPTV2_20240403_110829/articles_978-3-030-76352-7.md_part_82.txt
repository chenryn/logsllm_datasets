learning Plant Leaf Disease Detection
1 Introduction
Plant diseases are one of the major sources of yield and quality declining for
agriculture in the world including Africa. Considering this, early diagnosis of
plant diseases is an important task against starvation. Traditional approach
for detecting diseased plants consists in the naked eye observation by experts
[7]. This method of visual assessment, being a subjective task, can lead to
errorsduetobias(psychologicalandcognitivephenomena)andopticalillusions.

Ontheotherhand,laboratorytestssuchasmolecular,immunological,orrecom-
mended approaches on the culture of pathogens are often time consuming and
not responding in a timely manner.
Plant diseases most often take the form of an alteration of the plant which
modifies or interrupts its vital functions such as photosynthesis, transpiration,
pollination, fertilization, germination, etc. Disease manifestations are usually
seen on the leaves, fruits and stems of the plant. These diseases are caused by
pathogenic organisms (fungi, bacteria and viruses) or by unfavorable factors
resultinginharmfulchangesintheshape,developmentorthewholeoftheplant
thus causing partial damage or death of the plant [7].
Majorityofexistingdigitalmethodssofararebasedondigitalimageprocess-
ing.Mostmethodsarebasedontheplantleavesaspectsandcolortransformation
duetothedisease.Advantageofleaves-basedtechniquesisthatleavesarealmost
observable while flowers and fruits depend on the period of the season.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques are intensively used for leaf plant dis-
eases such as K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN); Artificial Neural Networks (ANN),
Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), Genetic Algorithm, Support Vector
Machine, Linear Regression Analysis (LDA) Fuzzy logic and Deep Learning
which is largely used nowadays [7].
However, these AI techniques classifiers in practice will face challenges
in African agriculture’s context. For instance, most of african computation
resources, if they exist, are in town and are poorly connected to rural areas. So,
having AI Solution that needs CPU, ubiquitous connectivity and large datasets
wouldn’t be successfully deployed. Operational challenges will be connectivity
that doesn’t exist in farms (at most GSM network is the most widespread) and
power energy supply is not guaranteed. However, since smartphones are very
widespreadlastly,alightweightanddecentralizedsolutionwillmemoreadapted
to this context.
In this paper we propose an IoT based Edge-AI framework that is based on
KMeans Kernel method to provide an Core-AI service for Plant Leaf Diseases
Detection. That framework has Edge AI-IoT Network Segment and Core AI
Service Segment. These two segments are connected to share data and machine
learning models. Our goal is to design lightweight AI that can be deployed in
IoTdevicestodetectplantleafdiseases.TheMachineLearningK-MeansKernel
LearningisusedforclusteringmethodsonKernelImages.Andthenthesemodels
areusedfordiseasedetectiononplantleafimages.Mainoutcomesofourproposal
are a low-computation and economic Edge AI framework that is as efficient
as sophisticated methods such as CNN, SVM, KNN...This framework reduces
the need for large training datasets to be efficient and the learned model is
embeddable in IoT devices near the plants in rural area.
Thepaperisorganizedasfollows:Section2presentsrelatedworksontheAI-
based Plant Disease detection researchs while Sect.3 gives a general overview of
plant diseases detection methods. In Sect.4 we present the general architecture
oftheframeworks,theKMeanKernelModels,KernelImageSelectionalgorithm
and evaluation. Finally we conclude in Sect.5.

2 Related Works
In last decades, several techniques has been developed for Plant Leaf Diseases
Detection(PLDD).ForArtificialIntelligence(AI)/MachineLearningbasedtech-
niques, the most intensively used are classifiers such as K-Nearest Neighbors
(KNN),RadialBasisFunction(RBF),ArtificialNeuralNetworks(ANN),Prob-
abilistic Neural Networks (PNN), and the Back-Propagation Network (BPN),
Support Vector Machines (SVM), KMeans Clustering, and SGDM [7].
Deep Learning related techniques (ANN, CNN, DNN, ...) show excellent
results in the topic of plant leaf disease detection and took the attention of
researchers [8] during the last years. Authors in [2] applied GLCM (Gray-Level
Co-Occurrence Matrix) for image characteristics extraction (Homogeneity, Cor-
relation, Entropy, ...) of tomato disease, then used CNN for convolutional
Neural Network for other authors to classify the leaf into diseased leaf and
healthy leaf. Comparisons of different methods in [2] gave the following accu-
racy results: Artificial Neural Network (ANN) 92.94%, (Deep Neural Network)
AlexNet 95.75% and CNN 99.25% based on the Plant Village database. Works
in [12] uses ANN to classify Banana Leaf and Fruit Diseases to detect them at
theirearlystage.Theycollected60imagesandused25fordetectionandtherest
for training. They presented visual results and mean, standard deviation, but
have not given explicit accuracy parameters. Proposal in [1], is about a tomato
cropdiseasedetection systemusing a CNN basedmodel. The CNN architecture
has3convolutionsandmaxpoolinglayerswithvaryingnumberoffiltersineach
layer. The training Dataset contains more than 10000 images and the average
testing accuracy of the model is 91.2%.
Support Vector Machine classifier (SVM) is a supervised learning model
formally defined by separating hyperplanes used also to identify the diseases
on the leaves [6,11]. The authors in [10] have focused on implementing image
analysis and classification techniques for detection of leaf diseases. They use
K-means clustering to detect diseased areas; feature extraction by Gray-Level
Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and finally Support Vector Machine for clas-
sification. Islam et al. in [6] an approach that integrates image processing and
machine learning to allow diagnosing diseases from leaf images. This automated
methodclassifiesdiseasesonpotatoplantsfromapubliclyavailableplantimage
database ‘Plant Village’. Their segmentation approach and utilization of sup-
port vector machines demonstrate disease classification over 300 images with an
accuracy of 95%.
The third category of classifier for plant leaf disease detection is K-Nearest
Neighbors(KNN) based solutions. Authors in [13] propose to replace the SVM
classifier with KNN classification. They extracted the characteristics resulting
fromthetransformationoftheRGBimagetoHSVtoclassifythelatterwiththe
KNNtechnique.Withthe250imagesselected,including45fortrainingand105
for testing, the authors were able to detect 4 types of disease: Early Leaf spot,
LateLeafspot,RustandBudNecrosis.Preliminaryresultsseempromisingwith
this technique but accuracy of their proposal has not been fully evaluated. In
[5] the authors use the GLCM for the extraction of mean, Standard Deviation,

the classification of 200 leaf images from five disease classes and 37 independent
leaf images for classifier performance testing. With this method the authors
obtained an efficiency of 96.76%.
K-means clustering is an unsupervised algorithm used to form different clus-
ters of datasets so that similar data are grouped into K clusters identified by K
Means. This technique is used by several works more specifically for segmenta-
tion [4]. Proposition in [9] uses KMeans for segmentation of images into clusters
thatisolatediseasedpartoftheleafimage.P.Badaret.al.hasusedanapproach
of segmentation using KMeans Clustering [3] on various features of Potato leaf
image samples such as color, texture, area, etc. and applied Back Propagation
Neural Network algorithm for identifying and classifying the disease in the leaf
image in which they obtained a classification accuracy of 92% [3].
However, all of these classifiers of AI techniques in practice may face two
major challenges in the context of African agriculture:
– Most rural areas of Africa do not have computer equipment powerful enough
in terms of CPU and energy to implement the resources necessary for the
proper functioning of these classifiers. And funding for the acquisition of its
equipment remains inaccessible.
– African rural areas also face difficulties in accessing the 3G or higher mobile
network for transmitting and receiving data. However, smartphones remain
widespread.
Our proposal aims at detecting diseased plants leaves with very low resource
consumption, with a very fast and reliable execution time. This Framework is
based on Kernel KMeans method to provide an edge AI service for Leaf Plant
Diseasedetection.Thereexistotherworksusingsimilarapproacheshoweverthey
all need large training datasets and more computation than our proposition.
Works that use KMeans do Machine Learning models for each plant leaf image
but we use Kernel instead to have mode general models than can be used as
general Models.
3 Background Concepts for Plant Disease Detection
There are several techniques for detecting diseased plants based on the color or
texture of the leaf. In a diseased plant leaf, the pixels can be grouped into two
groups:thepixelsoftheinfectedpartandthepixelsofthehealthyparttofinally
extract the information concerning the diseased pixels. This type of process
is called Region based. Edge based methods like gradient, log, canny, sobel,
laplacian,robert,leafborderbasedarealsowidelyusedtoidentifydiscontinuities
that exist on the leaf. Threshold based which, as its name suggests, is based on
thresholdvaluesobtainedfromthehistogramoftheseedgesoftheoriginalimage.
Another much more widely used method in disease detection is the clustering
algorithmcalledK-meanswhichallowstheimagetobesegmentedandclassified
intomultipleclusters.Itwillbeusedinthisarticleforthedetectionofthedisease
