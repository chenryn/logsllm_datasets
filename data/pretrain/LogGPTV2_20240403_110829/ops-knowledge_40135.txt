User: I am working on a project that requires reading text files, extracting data from them, and then generating reports (text files). Since there are a lot of string parsing, I decided to do it in Perl or Python or PHP (preference in that order). But I don't want to expose the source code to my client. Is there any good compiler for compiling perl/python/php scripts into linux executables?
I am not looking for a 100% perfect one, but I am looking for an at least 90% perfect one. By perfect, I mean the compiler doesn't require to write scripts with a limited subset of language features.
Assistant: There are 3 options of encrypting Perl code:

Use PAR to create executable file with PAR::Filter::Obfuscate or PAR::Filter::Crypto
Use Filter::Crypto::CryptFile (will require some modules installed on target OS)
Turn into module and encrypt into Module::Crypt.

Also you can try B::C - it was removed from core Perl distribution and is now available on CPAN.
