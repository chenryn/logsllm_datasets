## Abstract
Twitter is vulnerable to malicious tweets containing suspicious URLs used for spam, phishing, and malware distribution. Existing detection schemes have relied on account features or relation features in the Twitter graph, which can be easily fabricated or are resource-intensive. Previous URL detection methods have used various features such as lexical properties, redirection, and HTML content, but these can be evaded. In this paper, we introduce WARNINGBIRD, a system that detects suspicious URLs by analyzing correlated redirect chains across multiple tweets. By focusing on shared resources, WARNINGBIRD achieves high accuracy with low false-positive and false-negative rates. We trained a statistical classifier using a large dataset of tweets and their context information, and present WARNINGBIRD as a real-time system for classifying suspicious URLs in the Twitter stream.

## 1. Introduction
Twitter, a popular social networking and information sharing service, allows users to exchange short messages (tweets) of up to 140 characters. Malicious users often exploit Twitter by distributing suspicious URLs for spam, phishing, and malware. These URLs are often shortened using services like bit.ly and tinyurl.com to fit within the character limit.

Existing Twitter spam detection schemes fall into two categories: account feature-based and relation feature-based. Account feature-based schemes use attributes like the ratio of tweets containing URLs and the account creation date, which can be easily manipulated. Relation feature-based schemes, while more robust, require significant time and resources to extract features from the Twitter graph.

Suspicious URL detection schemes typically use static or dynamic crawlers to analyze URLs, but these can be bypassed using evasion techniques. For example, malicious servers may deliver benign content to crawlers while serving malicious content to regular browsers.

In this paper, we propose WARNINGBIRD, a system that detects suspicious URLs by analyzing correlated redirect chains in multiple tweets. This approach leverages the fact that attackers must reuse limited resources, leading to shared redirect chains. We collected a large dataset of tweets and trained a statistical classifier with features derived from these correlated URLs and tweet context information. Our classifier achieves high accuracy with low false-positive and false-negative rates, and we present WARNINGBIRD as a real-time system for detecting suspicious URLs in the Twitter stream.

## 2. Case Studies

### 2.1 blackraybansunglasses.com
**blackraybansunglasses.com** is a suspicious site associated with spam tweets. First encountered in April 2011, it remains active. Using a one percent sample of tweets from July 11, 2011, we found that the site uses a page, `redirect.php`, to conditionally redirect users to random spam pages. It employs 6,585 different Twitter accounts and shortened URLs, accounting for about 2.83% of the 232,333 tweets with URLs in our sample. When a user clicks on a shortened URL, they are redirected through a private site, such as `beginnersatlanta.tk`, before being directed to `blackraybansunglasses.com`. The site checks if the visitor is a normal browser or a crawler, and redirects them to `forexstrategysite.com` or `google.com` accordingly. Notably, the site abuses the Twitter Web interface rather than APIs to distribute its spam.

### 2.2 24newspress.net
**24newspress.net** is another suspicious site distributed via tweets. First detected at the end of June 2011, it remains active. Using a one percent sample of tweets from July 23, 2011, we found 6,205 tweets related to this site, representing about 2.41% of the 257,329 tweets with URLs in our sample. Unlike `blackraybansunglasses.com`, it does not perform conditional redirection but uses IP addresses and domain names for cloaking, similar to IP fast flux and domain flux methods. It has five other domain names and uses a mobile Twitter Web interface to distribute spam.

### 2.3 Frequent URL Redirect Chains
We analyzed three days' worth of tweet samples from July 23 to 25, 2011, extracting frequent URL redirect chains and ranking them by frequency after removing whitelisted domains. Many suspicious sites, such as `jbfollowme.com`, were highly ranked (see Table 1).

### 2.4 Observations
From these examples, we identified several characteristics of suspicious URLs:
- They use multiple Twitter accounts and shortened URLs.
- They employ multiple domain names and IP addresses for cloaking.
- They use long redirect chains to avoid investigation.
- They appear more frequently in the Twitter public timeline than benign URLs.
These characteristics form the basis for the feature models used in our classification system.

## 3. Proposed System

### 3.1 Motivation and Basic Idea
Our goal is to develop a robust system, WARNINGBIRD, for detecting suspicious URLs in Twitter. By focusing on correlated redirect chains, we aim to overcome the limitations of existing detection methods. Attackers' limited resources necessitate the reuse of redirect chains, making them a reliable indicator of suspicious activity.

### 3.2 System Architecture
WARNINGBIRD consists of the following components:
- **Data Collection**: Collects a large number of tweets from the Twitter public timeline.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extracts features from correlated URL redirect chains and tweet context information.
- **Classifier Training**: Trains a statistical classifier using the extracted features.
- **Real-Time Detection**: Classifies suspicious URLs in real-time as they appear in the Twitter stream.

### 3.3 Evaluation
We evaluated WARNINGBIRD using a comprehensive dataset and found that it achieves high accuracy with low false-positive and false-negative rates. The system effectively identifies suspicious URLs by leveraging the shared nature of redirect chains.

## 4. Conclusion
In this paper, we introduced WARNINGBIRD, a system for detecting suspicious URLs in Twitter. By focusing on correlated redirect chains, WARNINGBIRD overcomes the limitations of existing detection methods and provides a robust solution for real-time classification of suspicious URLs. Future work will include further refinement of the system and exploration of additional features to enhance its performance.
