Introduction
Twitter can suffer from malicious tweets containing sus-
picious URLs for spam, phishing, and malware distribution.
Previous Twitter spam detection schemes have used account
features such as the ratio of tweets containing URLs and
the account creation date, or relation features in the Twitter
graph. Malicious users, however, can easily fabricate ac-
count features. Moreover, extracting relation features from
the Twitter graph is time and resource consuming. Previous
suspicious URL detection schemes have classiﬁed URLs us-
ing several features including lexical features of URLs, URL
redirection, HTML content, and dynamic behavior. How-
ever, evading techniques exist, such as time-based evasion
and crawler evasion. In this paper, we propose WARNING-
BIRD, a suspicious URL detection system for Twitter. In-
stead of focusing on the landing pages of individual URLs in
each tweet, we consider correlated redirect chains of URLs
in a number of tweets. Because attackers have limited re-
sources and thus have to reuse them, a portion of their
redirect chains will be shared. We focus on these shared
resources to detect suspicious URLs. We have collected
a large number of tweets from the Twitter public timeline
and trained a statistical classiﬁer with features derived from
correlated URLs and tweet context information. Our clas-
siﬁer has high accuracy and low false-positive and false-
negative rates. We also present WARNINGBIRD as a real-
time system for classifying suspicious URLs in the Twitter
stream.

nology through the National Research Foundation of Korea(R31-10100).
Twitter is a well-known social networking and informa-
tion sharing service [15] that allows users to exchange mes-
sages of fewer than 140-character, also known as tweets,
with their friends. When a user Alice updates (or sends) a
tweet, this tweet will be distributed to all of her followers,
who have registered Alice as one of their friends. Instead
of distributing her tweets to all of her followers, Alice can
send a tweet to a speciﬁc twitter user Bob by mentioning
this user by including @Bob in the tweet. Unlike status
updates, mentions can be sent to users who do not follow
Alice. When Twitter users want to share URLs with friends
via tweets, they usually use URL shortening services [1] to
reduce the length of these URLs, because tweets can only
contain a restricted number of characters. bit.ly and
tinyurl.com are widely used services, and Twitter also
provides its own shortening service t.co.
Owing to the popularity of Twitter, malicious users of-
ten try to ﬁnd a way to attack it. Most common forms
of Web attacks, including spam, scam, phishing, and mal-
ware distribution attacks, have appeared on Twitter. Be-
cause tweets are short in length, attackers use shortened ma-
licious URLs that redirect Twitter users to external attack
servers [6, 11, 19, 23].
To cope with malicious tweets, many Twitter spam de-
tection schemes have been proposed. These schemes can be
classiﬁed into account feature-based [2,16,23,28] and rela-
tion feature-based [21, 31] schemes. Account feature-based
schemes use the distinguishing features of spam accounts
such as the ratio of tweets containing URLs, the account
creation date, and the number of followers and friends.
However, malicious users can easily fabricate these account
features. The relation feature-based schemes rely on more
robust features that malicious users cannot easily fabricate
such as the distance and connectivity apparent in the Twitter
graph. Extracting these relation features from the Twitter
graph, however, requires a signiﬁcant amount of time and
resources, because the Twitter graph is tremendous in size.
A number of suspicious URL detection schemes [3, 17–
19, 24, 30] have also been introduced. They use static
or dynamic crawlers and may be executed in virtual ma-
chine honeypots, such as Capture-HPC [4], HoneyMon-
key [29], and Wepawet [7], to investigate newly observed
URLs. These schemes classify URLs according to several
features including lexical features of URLs, DNS informa-
tion, URL redirection, and the HTML content of the landing
pages. Nonetheless, malicious servers can bypass investi-
gation by selectively providing benign pages to crawlers.
For instance, because static crawlers usually cannot han-
dle JavaScript or Flash, malicious servers can use them to
deliver malicious content only to normal browsers. Even
if investigators use dynamic crawlers that have (almost) all
the functionalities of real browsers, malicious servers may
be able to distinguish them through IP address, user inter-
action, browser ﬁngerprinting [8], or honeyclient detection
techniques [14]. A recent technical report from Google has
also discussed techniques for evading current Web malware
detection systems [20]. Malicious servers can also employ
temporal behaviors—providing different content at differ-
ent times—to evade investigation [24].
In this paper, we propose WARNINGBIRD, a suspicious
URL detection system for Twitter. Instead of investigating
the landing pages of individual URLs in each tweet, which
may not be successfully fetched, we considered correlated
redirect chains of URLs included in a number of tweets. Be-
cause attackers’ resources are limited and need to be reused,
a portion of their redirect chains must be shared. We found
a number of meaningful features of suspicious URLs de-
rived from the correlated URL redirect chains and related
tweet context information. We collected a large number of
tweets from the Twitter public timeline and trained a sta-
tistical classiﬁer with their features. The trained classiﬁer
has high accuracy and low false-positive and false-negative
rates.
The contributions of this paper can be summarized as
follows:
• We present a new suspicious URL detection system for
Twitter that is based on correlations of URL redirect
chains, which are difﬁcult to fabricate. The system can
classify suspicious URLs found in the Twitter stream
in real time.
• We introduce new features of suspicious URLs: some
of them are newly discovered and others are variations
of previously discovered features.
• We present some investigation results regarding suspi-
cious URLs that have been widely distributed through
Twitter over the past several months and continue to
remain active.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In
Section 2, we discuss case studies on suspicious URLs in
Twitter. In Section 3, we introduce our system, WARNING-
BIRD. In Section 4, we present the evaluation results. In
Section 5, we discuss the limitations of the proposed sys-
tem.
In Section 6, we discuss related work. Finally, we
conclude this paper in Section 7.
2 Case Study
2.1 blackraybansunglasses.com
We
consider
blackraybansunglasses.com,
which is a suspicious site associated with spam tweets.
We ﬁrst encountered this site in April 2011 and it remains
active. We use a one percent sample of tweets collected
on July 11, 2011, to conduct an in-depth analysis of the
site (see Figure 1). blackraybansunglasses.com
has a page, redirect.php, that conditionally redirects
users to random spam pages. It uses a number of different
Twitter accounts and shortened URLs to distribute its
URL to other Twitter users. According to our dataset,
it uses 6, 585 different Twitter accounts and shortened
URLs, and occupies about 2.83% of all
the 232, 333
tweets with URLs that we sampled. When a user clicks
on one of the shortened URLs, such as bit.ly/raCz5i
distributed by zarzuelavbafpv0, he or she will
be redirected to a private redirection site,
such as
beginnersatlanta.tk, which seems to be managed
by the operator of blackraybansunglasses.com.

redirec-
tion site blackraybansunglasses.com evaluates
whether its visitors are normal browsers or crawlers using
several methods, including cookie or user-agent checking.
When it is sure that a current visitor is a normal browser,
it redirects the visitor to forexstrategysite.com,
which then ﬁnally redirects him or her to random spam
pages. When blackraybansunglasses.com de-
termines that a current visitor is not a normal browser,
it simply redirects the visitor to google.com to avoid
investigation. Therefore, crawlers may not be able to see
forexstrategysite.com or the further random spam
pages.

not use Twitter APIs to distribute malicious tweets. Instead,
it abuses the Twitter Web interface. Previous Twitter spam
detection schemes usually assumed that many spammers
would use Twitter APIs to distribute their spam tweets.
Smart Twitter spammers, however, no longer rely on
Twitter APIs, because they know that using APIs will

distinguish their tweets from normal tweets. For instance,
tweetattacks.com [26] sells a Twitter spam program
that uses the Web interface instead of APIs to make spam
receivers believe that the received tweets are not spam and
to circumvent API limits.
2.2
24newspress.net
Let us also discuss 24newspress.net, which is a
suspicious site distributed via tweets. We ﬁrst found this
site at the end of June 2011 and it remains active. We
use one percent of the tweet samples collected on July
23, 2011, to conduct an in-depth analysis of the page (see
Figure 2). Unlike blackraybansunglasses.com
24newspress.net does not perform conditional redi-
rection to avoid investigation. Instead, it uses a number of
IP addresses and domain names for cloaking like IP fast ﬂux
and domain ﬂux methods [12, 22]. It has ﬁve other domain
24dailyreports.net, 7reports.net,
names:
job365report.net,
and
week-job.net.
It also uses a number of different
shortened URLs and different Twitter accounts to distribute
tweets to Twitter users.
In our dataset, we found 6, 205
tweets related to 24newspress.net, which represent
about 2.41% of all the 257, 329 tweets with URLs sampled.
In addition, it abuses a mobile Twitter Web interface to
distribute its spam tweets.
jobs-post.net,
2.3 Frequent URL Redirect Chains
We performed a simple investigation on three days’
worth of tweet samples culled from July 23 to 25, 2011.
We extracted frequent URL redirect chains from the sam-
ple data and ranked them according to their frequency af-
ter removing whitelisted domain names. Many suspicious
sites, such as jbfollowme.com, which attempts to at-
tract Justin Bieber’s fans, proved to be highly ranked (see
Table 1).
2.4 Observations
From the previous examples, we can identify meaningful
characteristics of suspicious URLs. They use a number of
different Twitter accounts and shortened URLs, or a number
of domain names and IP addresses to cloak the same suspi-
cious URLs. They also use long redirect chains to avoid
investigation. Moreover, they appear more frequently in the
Twitter public timeline than benign URLs. These charac-
teristics are the basis for the feature models we employ to
classify suspicious URLs.
