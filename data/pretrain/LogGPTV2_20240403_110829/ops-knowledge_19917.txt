User: Develop a simple web application using the Python Flask framework.
Assistant: 1. Install Flask First, you need to install Flask, which can be installed through pip. The command is as follows: ``` pip install Flask ``` 2. Create a Flask application After installing Flask, you can use the following code to create a simple Flask application. ``` from flask import Flask app = Flask(__name__) @app.route('/') def index(): return 'Hello, world!' if __name__ == '__main__': app.run(debug=True) ``` In this code, we define a Flask application that returns a string 'Hello, world!' on the home page ('/'). At the same time, Flask's development server is started. 3. Run the Flask application After creating the Flask application, we can run the application, the command is as follows: ``` python app.py ``` After running, visit http://localhost:5000/ in the browser, you can See the string 'Hello, world!'. 4. Create a dynamic route Although we have implemented a simple route above, this route is a static route, that is, every visit will return the same result. In fact, we often need to create dynamic routes, such as returning different results according to different users. The following code shows how to create a dynamic route: ``` from flask import Flask app = Flask(__name__) @app.route('/user/<username>') def show_user(username): return 'User %s' % username if __name__ == '__main__': app.run(debug=True) ``` In this code, we create a dynamic route /user/<username>, where <username> is a dynamic parameter. When we visit http://localhost:5000/user/John, it returns 'User John'. 5. Create a template Although we can already return some simple strings, in practical applications, we often need to return complex HTML pages. In order to achieve this functionality, we need to create templates. The following code shows how to create a simple HTML template: ``` <!doctype html> <html> <head> <title>{{ title }}</title> </head> <body> <h1>{ { title }}</h1> <p>{{ content }}</p> </body> </html> ``` In this HTML template, we use the Flask template language, such as {{ title }} and {{ content }}. These statements are automatically replaced with real values by Flask. 6. Using the template After creating the template, we can apply this template to our Flask application. For example: ``` from flask import Flask, render_template app = Flask(__name__) @app.route('/') def index(): return render_template('index.html', title='Home', content='Welcome to my website!') if __name__ == '__main__': app.run(debug=True) ``` In this code, we use the render_template function to apply the index.html template to our Flask application. Also, we pass some variables to the template, such as title and content. Visit http://localhost:5000/ in the browser, and you can see the rendered HTML page. 7. Summary Through this simple example, we learned how to use the Flask framework to create a simple web application, including creating routes, using templates, and more. The Flask framework is very flexible and ideal for rapid development and prototyping.
