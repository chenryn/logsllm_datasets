Figure 5. CDF of spam scores from SpamAssassin
edu, mx2.umich.edu and mx3.umich.edu. We
ﬁnally record the results of querying the IP address
141.211.22.134 for the three blacklists.
4.2 Appear(cid:173)once IP addresses and new IP
trend
In our data set, we observe that more than 80% of IPs
were active only for one day. Most of these IPs sent only
one to ﬁve spam emails, however, collectively they con-
tributed to about 40% of all the spam emails and 2.4% of
all the ham (non-spam) emails received. Further analysis
shows that about 34.6% of these appear-once IPs are dy-
namic IPs. In contrast, only 15.3% of the remaining IPs
are dynamic, suggesting that appear-once IP addresses
are more likely to be dynamic IPs, thus are less likely
legitimate mail servers. Nevertheless, we cannot simply
block them as they might send valid emails as well.
These appear-once IPs span across the entire training
period. To quantify their impact, we compute the num-
ber of new IP addresses observed on a monthly basis.
The result indicates this number keeps increasing each
month starting at 189,994, reaching 603,284 in the last
month. We expect it to continue growing given our small
vantage point until we observe most IPs. Thus, main-
taining a reputation history for individual IP addresses
will not work well, as there will always be new instances
of unseen IPs appearing every day. This result conﬁrms
previous results that about 85% of IP addresses send less
than 10 emails [21].
4.3 Data cleaning
Since we use the spam classiﬁcation produced by
an imperfect detector – SpamAssassin, we may not
have the ground truth. Figure 5 shows a mostly bi-
modal spam score distribution assigned by SpamAssas-
sin where most of the emails either have a high score
(much higher than 5.0) or a low score (much less than
0). However, we do see a fraction of emails (less than
8%) that fall into the score range of 5(±3), which may
contribute to false positives and false negatives using the
default threshold of 5.
To investigate the false negative behavior, we set up
a honeypot account within our department (advertised
since 2007 on personal Web pages but not used), through
which we found that SpamAssassin has a non-negligible
false negative rate—155 (16%) missed spams out of 965
recent spam emails. The false positive rate of SpamAs-
sassin, however, is very low as reported by previous
work [25].
It is important to reduce the false negatives of Spa-
mAssassin, as those IP addresses sending spam may ap-
pear legitimate and thus cause inaccurate evaluation of
clustering. One source of information we use is IP-based
DNSBLs. Previous studies [16, 23, 21] show that signif-
icantly more spam are detected by combining multiple
blacklists. Further, these studies show that a large frac-
tion of spammer IP addresses will eventually be listed
after some time (e.g., 2 months or so) in blacklists if not
at the time spams from such addresses are received. As
a result, we decided to conduct the data cleaning process
by querying 5 popular blacklists (Spamhaus, Spamcop,
SORBS, NJABL, CBL) approximately 2 months after
we received the emails. Any IP address listed in at least
two of the blacklists will be considered bad and we treat
all the emails they sent as spam.
Another source of information to facilitate our anal-
ysis is obtained from Hotmail servers. IP addresses that
send purely spam to Hotmail server (reported by the
Hotmail spam ﬁlter) will be considered as spamming ad-
dresses as well. For IPs that send any legitimate email to
Hotmail server, we conservatively do not consider them
as bad IPs to prevent false positives.
To summarize, we consider a given IP address as bad
or spamming IP if it satisﬁes any of the following three
conditions.
1. It has a high spam ratio > 90% (reported by Spa-
mAssassin)
2. It is captured by at least two blacklists that are
queried after two months.
3. It never sends legitimate email to Hotmail and all
the emails sent by the IP are classiﬁed as spam.
We are able to reduce the false negative rate down to
4.5% in the honeypot account after applying these rules
while introducing 0 false positives in 3 of our personal
accounts. After the data cleaning process, we can char-
acterize the spamming behavior more accurately.
Note that our approach is conservative to obtain fairly
accurate false negative evaluation by ensuring that bad
IPs identiﬁed for evaluation are not misclassiﬁed. Nev-
ertheless, it is not possible to completely ensure that all
bad IPs are caught in this manner, and those IPs may
appear in the evaluation result as good IPs while clas-
siﬁed as bad IPs due to the its cluster’s reputation, thus
still causing slightly inﬂated false positives in our eval-
uation.
4.4 Different clusters analyzed
In this study, we measure the characteristics of each
cluster type based on BGP preﬁx and DNS informa-
tion and then propose ways to integrate them to ob-
tain increased beneﬁt while minimizing the shortcom-
ings of individual approaches. Speciﬁcally, the clus-
ters we build include BGP preﬁx clusters, DNS clusters
(rANS information combined with rDNS name informa-
tion). Since BGP preﬁx is a well-known technique, we
use it as the baseline for comparison. In the next section,
we explore the relationship between the BGP preﬁx and
DNS clusters to investigate how to utilize the DNS infor-
mation in combination with the BGP preﬁx information
to cluster IP addresses for accurate spam detection.
5 Cluster-based Spam Filtering
In this section, we study the effectiveness of cluster-
based blacklists. We ﬁrst consider BGP preﬁx clusters
since they are one of the most common ways of cluster-
ing IP addresses. However, as stated before, the accu-
racy of BGP preﬁx cluster depends on the visibility of
the preﬁx structure in public routing data. We also study
DNS-based clusters as DNS information may be used to
track the corresponding host administrative boundaries.
We found DNS-based clusters sometimes yield better
prediction accuracy than BGP preﬁxes, especially in the
cases where they provide more ﬁne-grained boundaries.
Given that these two types of information can comple-
ment each other, we consider combining them to derive
“combined clusters,” which are found to improve spam
detection by more accurately predicting host spamming
behavior.
5.1 BGP preﬁx clusters
From Route Views [24], a public BGP data source,
we sampled routing table snapshots of 7 distinct days
from March 7th to March 13th 2009. We use the longest
matching preﬁx of the format “1.2.3.4/16” to represent
IP’s cluster. For those 5000 IP addresses not associated
with any preﬁx, we resort to whois database [10] to ﬁnd
their associated preﬁxes.
5.2 DNS clusters
To utilize DNS information, we consider two ways
for cluster construction.
rANS clusters: The Reverse Authoritative Name
Server Cluster (rANS cluster) groups hosts by their
authoritative name servers.
For each incoming IP,
we perform reverse DNS lookup iteratively to iden-
tify its authoritative name servers. Note that a recur-
sive lookup is needed to collect several levels of name
servers, each returned by a different level of author-
ity such as 1.in-addr.arpa., 2.1.in-addr.
arpa. and so on. For instance, take Figure 3 as an ex-
ample, dns101-103.comcast.net is the last level
rANS for IPs in all BGP preﬁxes. Note that all the three
rANS are associated with all other BGP preﬁxes, mean-
ing that their granularity is the same. However, there
can be some rANS that are associated with more BGP
preﬁxes (e.g., our university uses rANS from another
university as backup). Even for IPs without a reverse
hostname, i.e., NXDOMAIN response, we can still ob-
tain additional information of other servers in the DNS
hierarchy. Note we do not use the host name reported
in the HELO message of an SMTP connect because the
hostname can be easily spoofed. An IP address may be
resolved by multiple name servers (e.g., for load balanc-
ing). We only pick the name servers in the lowest level
which represent the most ﬁne-grained administrative do-
main. If there are multiple ones at the lowest level (as is
the case in Figure 3), we pick the one that is associated
with the minimum number of BGP preﬁxes indicative of
the most ﬁne-grained administrative domain.
Naming cluster: Within an administrative boundary,
hosts play different roles. Usually only a subset of IPs
are used to set up mail servers. It is necessary to sepa-
rate these mail-servers from the remaining ones. The re-
verse DNS-names of IP addresses provide hints on how
to classify them. Within each administrative boundary
identiﬁed by a BGP preﬁx and/or rANS, we identify four
common naming patterns:
1. All rDNS names are in the same domain and share
a similar naming pattern. Table 1 shows one such
example, where all IPs are dynamic IPs with an ag-
gregated spam ratio of 99.6%.
2. All rDNS names are within the same domain, but
with non-uniform naming patterns. For instance, an
enterprise can have several legitimate mail servers
as well as other non-server hosts. To discover the
former, we resort to other sources of information -
MX records, SPF sender IP ranges and naming con-
vention as speciﬁed in RFC [6] that recommends
the DNS names of mail servers to begin with key-
word ’smtp’, ’mail’, or ’mx’. The example in Ta-
ble 2 includes a legitimate mail server listed in the
ﬁrst row, conﬁrmed by MX records of the domain
tvtel.pt. For clustering purposes, these servers are
separated into their own naming clusters.
3. IPs without any rDNS names are mixed together
with IPs with rDNS names. They are separated into
different naming clusters as shown in Table 3.
4. Many domains exist, with each including only a
few IPs. Table 4 shows one such example. Based
on our observation, such cases are usually corre-
lated with spamming behavior. With many do-
mains registered within the same administrative do-
main, it is highly likely that they are owned by
spammers who set up corresponding MX records
or SPF to make them appear as legitimate mail
servers.
Here we normally use the last two tokens as domain
name (e.g., umich.edu from www.umich.edu). How-
ever, if the last code is country code, then we use the
last three tokens as domain name (e.g., www.sjtu.edu.cn

from sjtu.edu.cn). Exception for this is that when
there are only three or even two tokens altogether for
a country-code-ending rDNS name, we will still use
the last two tokens as domain name (e.g., yahoo.cn
from www.yahoo.cn). To fully utilize DNS information,
we construct DNS clusters by converting naming-based
clusters to rANS clusters. For each rANS cluster, we at-
tempt to match any of the four common naming patterns
to further split it into smaller clusters. This enables us to
discern good IPs that may share the same administrative
domain with spamming IPs.
5.3 Cluster granularity
Ideally, we want to identify clusters consisting of
mostly good or bad IPs. Obviously the granularity of the
clusters plays an important role here. The extreme case,
where each cluster consists of a single IP, falls back to
the per-IP based scheme and is no longer useful for pre-
dicting spamming behavior of unseen IPs.
First we cluster the 2,737,006 distinct IP addresses
described previously into 92,449 BGP preﬁx clusters
and 60,659 rANS clusters, respectively. Thus on av-
erage, BGP preﬁx clusters are more ﬁne-grained than
rANS clusters. However, it is the distribution instead of
the average that matters. Figure 6 shows the distribution
