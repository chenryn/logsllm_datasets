3.2 Limitations of mapping technique
Our data has several limitations. First, a reverse DNS
mapping from IP address to hostname may not exist; such
records existed for only 50%-60% of all unique reachable
IP addresses. Second, undns may not have a parsing rule
to map the hostname to a location; our ruleset assigned
locations to about one-third of known hostnames. Third,
undns may return incorrect IP-to-AS number mappings.
Finally, some destinations were not reachable via tracer-
oute. We now discuss mitigating factors for the ﬁrst two
limitations and solutions for the latter two.
While we could resolve the hostnames of less than 60%
of IPs, we found that internal ISP routers—as opposed to
gateway routers or customer addresses—were more com-
monly missing reverse DNS records. These routers are
unlikely to express more geographic diversity than that al-
ready captured by gateways and customers, so this limita-
tion should not signiﬁcantly affect our results.
Even though undns assigned locations for only one-
third of all unique hostnames, two factors reduced the im-
pact of this poorer coverage. First, our ruleset provides
very good coverage for real-world trafﬁc patterns, as we
supply more detailed rules for popular ASes. In fact, we
resolved the location of 90% of probed IPs in Servers (i.e.,
when counting all instances, instead of only unique in-
stances, of hostnames). Second, the hostnames that had
no locality information were most commonly at the net-
work edges where dynamic addressing is used (e.g., cable
modem, DSL, and dialup connections). This may inﬂate
the number of hosts with unassigned locations.
undns uses the hostname of an IP address to determine
its AS number, which could cause us to mistakenly believe
an ISP is announcing a discontiguous preﬁx. For exam-
ple, an IP address in AS 6395 (Broadwing Communica-
tions) carries the hostname sufﬁx .northwestern.edu, even
though its corresponding /14 preﬁx is announced solely
by Broadwing, which provides transit service for North-
western University (AS 103). To solve this problem, we
assigned an AS number to an IP address by performing
longest-preﬁx matching against the RouteViews table.
Finally, many destinations were not directly reachable
when performing traceroutes: 57% of addresses in Clients,
52% in Servers, and 76% in Breadth. This limitation is
generally due to ﬁrewalls blocking ICMP packets at large
portions of the networks’ edges. and many destinations
in Breadth were unused IP addresses. To solve this prob-
lem, we assigned an unreachable destination IP address
to the location of its last reachable upstream router. Our
use of traceroutes enables us both to discover routable IP
addresses for ﬁrewalled or unused destinations and to de-
termine the upstream addresses for inherited locations.
4. Results
We ﬁrst examine the geographic diversity of individual
IP preﬁxes, paying particular attention to the maximum ge-
ographic distance between any two pairs of IP addresses
within a single preﬁx. We then study the extent to which
a single AS advertises multiple discontiguous preﬁxes that
refer to endpoints at a single location, as well as the causes
of these advertisements. Finally, we study the extent to
which an AS advertises contiguous preﬁxes for hosts in
diverse geographic locations.
4.1 Single preﬁx with multiple locations
In this section, we study the extent to which a single
IP preﬁx comprises hosts in multiple geographic locations
(thus potentially obscuring potentially useful information
by over-aggressive aggregation). Figure 1(a) shows the
number of distinct geographic locations contained within
a single geographic preﬁx for the Clients dataset. As ex-
pected, shorter preﬁxes tend to comprise more geographic
locations.
Figure 1(b) shows that, not only do the shorter preﬁxes
span more geographic locations, but these hosts also span
a much wider geographic distance: nearly half of the pre-
ﬁxes in the /8-/15 range span a distance of more than 100
miles. Several of the preﬁxes in this range are either Eu-
ropean backbones or broadband access providers in the
United States: for example, from the Clients dataset, we
ﬁnd that AS 7132 (SBC) advertises a single /16 that con-
tains 64 distinct locations spread across the United States.
Transit ASes with smaller address allocations also ad-
vertised preﬁxes containing geographically diverse hosts:
e.g., AS 7657 (The Internet Group, a New Zealand ISP),
advertised a /24 whose IP addresses span 1,400 miles.
Because ASes (particularly US-based backbone ISPs)
often allocate sub-preﬁxes from a single large IP preﬁx, we
expected that preﬁxes that are allocated to transit ISPs are
more likely to have geographically diverse preﬁxes than
those that are allocated to ASes that do not transit trafﬁc
for others. As shown in Figure 1(c), roughly 97% of all
preﬁxes announced by stub ASes (and more than 99% of
all preﬁxes in the /24-/31 range announced by stub ASes)
were announced from the same location.1 The remain-
1Classifying an AS as a “stub” turns out to be difﬁcult, as acquisitions,
unorthodox transit relationships (e.g., Harvard University appears as a
transit for MIT in RouteViews), etc., preclude classifying the leaves of
the RouteViews graph as stub ASes. Instead, we classify an AS as a stub

ing preﬁxes announced by stub ASes, however, may con-
tain locations that span large distances. For example, AS
6316 (StarNet) advertises a single /18 that contain hosts
spanning over 2,000 miles in 9 locations. Another strik-
ing example is AS 4637 (Reach, an Asia-Paciﬁc backbone
“with direct connectivity to the US and Europe”), which
advertises several /24 preﬁxes spanning over 10,000 miles
(such as 202.84.142.0/24, which contains hosts in Perth,
Australia and Dallas, Texas)!
About half of preﬁxes in the /8-/15 range contain IP ad-
dresses in multiple geographic locations, and about 97%
of both preﬁxes longer than /24 and preﬁxes announced
by stub ASes refer to IP addresses in only a single ge-
ographic location, which is expected. When stub ASes
do advertise preﬁxes that contain hosts in different geo-
graphic locations, however, it is often the case that these
hosts are not close together at all.
We hypothesized that, because large preﬁxes exhibit ge-
ographic diversity, large ASes might exhibit similar ge-
ographic diversity. That is, ASes with high degree (ac-
cording to the RouteViews table) might announce preﬁxes
from many diverse geographic locations.
Interestingly,
there are many small ASes that nevertheless announce ge-
ographically diverse preﬁxes as well: the correlation co-
efﬁcient between AS degree and maximum distance be-
tween IP addresses contained within that AS is only 0.07,
and many ASes with small degree commonly contain geo-
graphically diverse hosts. For example, AS 6509 (Canarie
Inc., Canada), a relatively small organization with an out-
degree of only 38 in the RouteViews table, announces a
preﬁx 205.189.32.0/24 that spans locations that are 2,300
miles apart.
4.2 Discontiguous preﬁxes with single location
In this section, we analyze how frequently discontiguous
preﬁxes (which cannot be aggregated) are announced by
if it has fewer than 5 downstream “customer” ASes per the classiﬁcation
algorithm from Gao [4].

an AS from the same geographic location. We found that
discontiguous preﬁxes formed between 70% and 74% of
the total number of preﬁxes mapped in the three datasets.
Discontiguous preﬁxes from the same geographic location
and AS indicate that an IP preﬁx is too ﬁne-grained.
Table 3 summarizes possible reasons for ASes announc-
ing discontiguous preﬁxes from the same location, as well
as their relative frequencies in our three datasets. Frag-
mented allocation is the single biggest reason for discon-
tiguous preﬁxes being announced from the same AS and
location: 65% of the discontiguous preﬁxes that appear in
the routing table result from regional routing registries al-
locating discontiguous preﬁxes to ASes. We now analyze
the causes for discontiguous preﬁxes in greater detail.
4.2.1 Fragmented allocation
IPv4 addresses are allocated by four Regional Internet
Registries (RIRs): APNIC (Asia Paciﬁc), ARIN (North
America), LACNIC (South America and the Caribbean),
and RIPE (Europe, Central Asia, and the Middle East).2
The registries publish information on every block of IP
space allocated by them. A typical allocation appears as:
arin|US|ipv4|19.0.0.0|16777216|19880615|assigned
This record speciﬁes that a block of 16,777,216 contiguous
addresses (i.e., a /8) beginning from IP address 19.0.0.0,
had been assigned to an organization on June 15th, 1988.
2In February 2005, a ﬁfth RIR (AfriNIC) began full operation, covering
registration for Africa. However, our datasets included the older registra-
tions managed by ARIN and RIPE.
