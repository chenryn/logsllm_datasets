ABSTRACT
To cope with the immense amount of content on the web,
search engines often use complex algorithms to personalize
search results for individual users. However, personalization
of search results has led to worries about the Filter Bub-
ble Eﬀect, where the personalization algorithm decides that
some useful information is irrelevant to the user, and thus
prevents them from locating it.
In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to ex-
plore the impact of location-based personalization on Google
Search results. Assessing the relationship between location
and personalization is crucial, since users’ geolocation can
be used as a proxy for other demographic traits, like race,
income, educational attainment, and political aﬃliation. In
other words, does location-based personalization trap users
in geolocal Filter Bubbles?
Using our methodology, we collected 30 days of search re-
sults from Google Search in response to 240 diﬀerent queries.
By comparing search results gathered from 59 GPS coordi-
nates around the US at three diﬀerent granularities (county,
state, and national), we are able to observe that diﬀerences
in search results due to personalization grow as physical dis-
tance increases. However these diﬀerences are highly depen-
dent on what a user searches for: queries for local estab-
lishments receive 4-5 diﬀerent results per page, while more
general terms exhibit essentially no personalization.

INTRODUCTION
Search engines are the primary gateway to information in
the developed world. Thus, it is no surprise that Google has
been the most visited site on the Internet for several years
now [1]; it receives more than 48,000 queries every second [2].
The importance of content and ordering in search results is
exempliﬁed by Europe’s recent Right to be Forgotten rul-
ing [21], as well as the thriving Search Engine Optimization
(SEO) industry [23].
To cope with the immense amount of content on the web,
search engines use complex algorithms to personalize search
results for individual users [9]. In many cases, personalized
search results are useful:
if two people on opposite ends
of the US search for “coﬀee shop” they should probably be
shown search results for local caf´es.
However, personalization of search results has also led to
worries about the Filter Bubble Eﬀect, where the algorithm
decides that some useful information is irrelevant to the user,
and thus prevents them from locating it [19]. This issue is
particularly concerning in the context of political and news-
related information: personalization based on a user’s polit-
ical preferences may trap them in an “echo-chamber” where
their pre-existing beliefs are constantly reinforced.
Motivated by concerns about Filter Bubbles, our prior
work set out to explore which factors triggered person-
alization in Google Search [11]. We found that Google
infers users’ geolocation based on their IP address, and
that location-based personalization caused more diﬀerences
in search results than any other single feature. However,
while these initial ﬁndings are intriguing, many questions
remain, such as: does location-based personalization impact
all types of queries (e.g., politics vs. news) equally? At what
distance do users begin to see changes in search results due to
location? Answering these questions is crucial, since users’
geolocation can be used as a proxy for other demographic
traits, like race, income-level, educational attainment, and
political aﬃliation. In other words, does location-based per-
sonalization trap users in geolocal Filter Bubbles?
In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to explore
the impact of location on Google Search results. We use
the JavaScript Geolocation API [12] to present arbitrary
GPS coordinates to the mobile version of Google Search.
Google personalizes the search results based on the location
we speciﬁed, giving us the ability to collect search results
from any location around the globe. Although we focus on

Google Search in the US, our methodology is general, and
could easily be applied to other search engines like Bing.
Using our methodology, we collected 30 days of search re-
sults from Google Search in response to 240 diﬀerent queries.
By selecting 75 GPS coordinates around the US at three
granularities (county, state, and national), we are able to ex-
amine the relationship between distance and location-based
personalization, as well as the impact of location-based per-
sonalization on diﬀerent types of queries. We make the fol-
lowing observations:
• As expected, the diﬀerences between search results
grows as physical distance between the locations of the
users increases.
• However, the impact of location-based personalization
changes depending on the query type. Queries for
politicians’ names (e.g., “Joe Biden”) and controversial
topics (“abortion”) see minor changes, while queries for
local terms (“airport”) are highly personalized.
• Surprisingly, only 20-30% of diﬀerences are due to
Maps embedded in search results. The remainder are
caused by changes in “normal” search results.
• Also surprisingly, the search results for local terms are
extremely noisy, i.e., two users making the same query
from the same location at the same time often receive
substantially diﬀerent search results.
Outline.
The rest of the paper is organized as fol-
lows: in Section 2, we give an overview of our data collection
methodology, and then present analysis and ﬁndings in Sec-
tion 3. We discuss related work in Section 4 and conclude
in Section 5.
2. METHODOLOGY
Our goal is to explore the relationship between geoloca-
tion and personalization on Google Search. Thus, we re-
quire the ability to send identical queries to Google Search,
at the same moment in time, from diﬀerent locations.
In
this section, we explain our methodology for accomplishing
these goals. First, we introduce the locations and search
terms used in our study. Next, we explain our technique for
querying Google Search from arbitrary locations, and how
we parsed Google Search results. Finally, we discuss how we
quantify diﬀerences between pages of search results.
2.1 Locations and Search Terms
Locations.
First, we must choose the locations in which
to execute queries. We decided to focus our study on Ohio,
since it is known to be a “battleground” state in US poli-
tics. This property is important, since we want to examine
whether demographics like political aﬃliation correlate with
location-based personalization.
Overall, we picked 66 locations for our study spread across
three granularities. For nation-level, we chose the centroids
of 22 random states in the United States. For state-level, we
chose the centroids of 22 random counties within Ohio. On
average, these counties 100 miles apart. Finally, for county-
level, we chose the centroids of 15 voting districts in Cuya-
hoga County, which is the most populous county in Ohio.
On average, these voting districts are 1 mile apart. By ex-
amining locations in diﬀerent granularities, we will be able
to observe changes in search results across small, medium,
and large-scale distances. This also gives us the ability to
compare search results served in places with diﬀerent demo-
graphics characteristics.
Search Terms.
Next, we must select search terms for
our study. We built a corpus of 240 queries that fall into
three categories: 33 local queries, 87 controversial queries,
and 120 names of politicians. Local queries correspond
with physical establishments, restaurants, and public ser-
vices such as “bank”, “hospital”, and “KFC”. We chose these
terms because we expect them to produce search results
that are heavily personalized based on location, i.e., we treat
them as an upper-bound on location-based personalization.
For politicians, we selected 11 members of the Cuyahoga
County Board, 53 random members of the Ohio House and
Senate, all 18 members of the US Senate and House from
Ohio, 36 random members of the US House and Senate not
from Ohio, Joe Biden, and Barack Obama. For national ﬁg-
ures like Barack Obama, we do not expect to see diﬀerences
in search results due to location; however, it is not clear how
