• Remember: a firmware is composed by many regions such 
as Flash Descriptors, BIOS, ME (Management Engine), GbE 
and ACPI EC.

ME: has full access to the DRAM, invisible at same time, is always working 
(even then the system is shutdown) and has access to network interface.

• Intel Boot Guard (controlled by ME), introduced by Intel, is 
used to validate the boot process through flashing the 
public key of the BIOS signature into FPFs (Field 
Programmable Fuses) from Intel ME. 
• Obviously, if vendors left closemnt fuse unset, so it could 
be lethal. 
• Of course, the SPI region must be locked and the Boot 
Guard configuration must be set against a SMM driver 
rootkit.

 Additionally, BIOS Guard running in the SMM, protects against not-
authorized:
• SPI Flash Access (through BIOS Guard Authenticated Code 
Module)  prevents an attacker to escalate privileges to SMM 
by writting a new image to SPI.  
• BIOS update  attacker (through a DXE driver) could update the 
BIOS to a flawed BIOS version. 
• Boot infection/corruption.
 BIOS Guard allows that only trusted modules (by ACM) are able to 
modify the SPI flash memory against rookit implants.

• Secure Boot:
• Protect the entire path shown previously against bootkit 
infection.
• Protects key components from kernel loading, key 
drivers and important system files, requesting a valid 
digital signature. 
• Prevents loading of any code that are not associated a 
valid digital signature.

•
Two essential items on Secure Boot are: 
• Platform Key (PK – must be valid), which establishes a trust 
relationship between the platform owner and the platform 
firmware, verifies Key Exchange Key (KEK). 
• KEK, which establishes a trust relationship between the OS 
and the platform firmware, verifies:
• Authorized Database (db)  contains authorized signing 
certificates and digital signatures
• Forbidden Database (dbx)  contains forbidden 
certificates and digital signatures.

• Obviously, if the Platform Key is corrupted, everything is 
not valid anymore because the SecureBoot turns out 
disabled when this fact happens. 
• Unfortunately, few vendors continue storing important
Secure Boot settings in UEFI variables. However, if these 
UEFI variable are exploited through ring 0/-2 malware or 
bootkit, so the SecureBoot can be disabled.

•
Without ensuring the UEFI image integrity, a rookit could load 
another UEFI image without being noticed. 
•
UEFI BIOS supports TE (Terse Executable) format (signature 
0x5A56 - VZ).
•
As TE format doesn’t support signatures, BIOS shouldn’t load 
this kind of image because Signature checking would be skipped.
•
Therefore, a rootkit could try to replace the typical PE/COFF 
loader by a TE EFI executable, so skipping the signature check 
and disabling the Secure Boot.

 Additionally, new releases of Windows 10 (version 1607 and 
later) has introduced interesting SMM protections as 
Windows SMM Security Mitigation Table (WSMT). 
 In Windows 10, the firmware executing SMM must be 
“authorized and trusted” by VBS (Virtualized Based 
Security).

These SMM Protections flags that can be used to enable or 
disable any WSMT feature.
• FIXED_COMM_BUFFERS: it guarantees that any input/output 
buffers be filled by value within the expected memory 
regions. 
• SYSTEM_RESOURCE_PROTECTION: it works as an indication 
that the system won’t allow out-of-band reconfiguration of 
system resources. 
• COMM_BUFFER_NESTED_PTR_PROTECTION: it is a 
validation method that try to ensure that any pointer whith the 
fixed communication buffer only refer to address ranges that 
are within a pre-defined memory region.

The BIOS_CNTL register contains:
• BIOS Write Enable(BWE)  if it is set to 1, an attacker could 
write to SPI flash. 
• BIOS Lock Enable (BLE)  if it is set to 1, it generates an SMI 
routine to run just in case the BWE goes from 0 to 1. 
•
Of course, there should be a SMM handler in order to prevent 
setting the BWE to 1. 
•
What could happen if SMI events were blocked? 
•
The SMM BIOS write protection (SMM_BWP) , which protects 
the entire BIOS area, is not enabled.

•
SPI Protect Range registers protect the flash chip against writes. 
•
They control Protected Range Base and Protected Range Limit 
fields, which set regions for Write Protect Enable bit and Read 
Protect Enable bit. 
•
If the Write Protect Enable bit is set, so regions from flash chip 
that are defined by Protected Range Base and Protected Range 
Limit fields are protected. 
•
However, SPI Protect Range registers DO NOT protect the entire 
BIOS and NVRAM. 
•
In a similar way to BLE, the HSFSS.FLOCKDN bit (from HSFSTS 
SPI MMIO Register) prevents any change  to Write Protect Enable 
bit. Therefore, malware can’t disable the SPI protected ranges for 
enabling access to the SPI flash memory.

Top Swap Mode, which is enabled by BUC.TS in Root Complex 
range,  is a feature that allows fault-tolerant update of the BIOS 
boot-block. 
•
Therefore, when Top Swap Configuration and swap boot-block 
range in SPI are not protected or even locked, any malware could
force an execution redirect of the reset vector to backup 
bootblock because CPU will fetch the reset vector at 0xFFFEFFF0 
instead of 0xFFFFFFF0 address. 
•
SMRR (System Management Range Registers) blocks the access 
to SMRAM (range of DRAM that is reserved by BIOS SMI 
handlers) while CPU is not in SMM mode, preventing it to execute 
any SMI exploit on cache.

• Most security professionals haven being facing problems to 
understand how to analyze malicious drivers because the 
theory is huge and not easy.
• Real customers are not awareness about ring -2 threats and 
they don’t know how to update systems’ firmwares. 
• All protections against implants are based on integrity 
(digital certificate and signature). However, what would 
happen whether algoritms were broken (QC - quantum 
computation)?
