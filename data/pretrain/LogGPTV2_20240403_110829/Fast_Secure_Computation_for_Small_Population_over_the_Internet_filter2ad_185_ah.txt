amounts to 72 KB − 1530 KB for the benchmark circuits. For the 3PC with guaranteed output delivery, we provide
implementation result only for LAN setting where the broadcast channel is emulated using an UDP physical
broadcast. We calculate separately the cost of communication over private channels and broadcast channel and
demonstrate that the latter communication is independent of the circuit size. Our protocols providing guaranteed
output delivery run in 3 rounds when the adversary does not strike. The round complexity stretches to 5 in the worst
case for our 5-round protocols. Tables 3-4 show performance for the 3-round runs. With minimal communication
and computation in the last two rounds, the overhead shows up mainly in the WAN runtime by a factor of half a
second and communication by less than 1 KB.

The x-axes indicate the type of the circuit used for evaluation 1-AES, 3-MD5, 5-SHA-256. The y-axis indicates Runtime in ms, s for
graphs (a), (b) respectively and communication data in MB for (c).
For a uniﬁed comparison with [MRZ15], we compute the average of the above parameters per party for all the
protocols and the results appear in Table 5. In terms of average computation time, LAN runtime and communica-
tion cost our 4PC turns out to be the winner inspite of providing the strongest notion of security. The improvement
per party comes from the fact that the costs of this protocol are almost similar to that of 3PC protocols inspite of
having one extra party in the system. It closely trails [MRZ15] in terms of WAN runtime due to the additional com-
munication involved in the InputCommit routine and the delayed opening of the committed decoding information
both of which are not present in the protocol of [MRZ15]. Our 3PC with fairness is almost on par with [MRZ15]
and yet achieves a stronger security notion. The extra overhead over [MRZ15] occurs primarily as a consequence
of commitments to the decoding information and the postponed opening of decoding information by the garblers in
order to achieve fairness. However, in [MRZ15], the use of soft-decoding avoided the need for additional commu-
nication to deliver the decoding information. The variation in the communication overhead over the circuits reﬂects
26
the fact that the output size and thus the size of information (openings of the commitments) related to decoding
information are different over the circuits. For example, the SHA-256 has 256 bit output, whereas the output size
of AES is half of it. Therefore, the communication overhead for SHA-256 for our protocol is almost double that of
AES, namely 10.74 KB vs. 5.63 KB. The WAN runtime overhead reﬂects the increased round requirement of our
fair protocol. The communication overhead of our 3PC with guaranteed output delivery is almost nominal over
[MRZ15] as both protocols use of soft-decoding. In Table 5, we show in bracket the increase for the 5-round runs
of our 4PC (5-round) and 3PC protocols providing guaranteed output delivery. The performance of our protocols
compared to that of [MRZ15] is plotted in Figure. 9.
