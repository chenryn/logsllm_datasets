#### Why is this important and How to do it?
I see a lot of job seeking websites are asking for Github username, because
they are interested to know what we have done till now with codding.
And that's where my idea comes from, we have so much code written in FCC and
so little in Github!  
Why not connect FCC with Github and whatever you Submit in FCC it would
transfer the same code in Github too.
#### I wish this will get done soon.
Because I hate copy & paste it from FCC to Github !  
It's so BORING !

#### Imagine how Amazing it would be if he had the same contributions !
If I where a CEO of a Company I would hire him immediately!
