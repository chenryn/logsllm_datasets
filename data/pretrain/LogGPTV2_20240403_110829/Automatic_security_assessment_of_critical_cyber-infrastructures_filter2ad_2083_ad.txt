**Tool and Action List:**
The list of possible actions is provided in Table 3. The available actions depend on the current state of the system. For example, consider the configuration described in Figure 5, where TR3 is not grounded, but TR2 is. The "workflow analysis" tool can perform model-checking to determine if the final state is reachable from the initial state (i.e., there are no deadlocks, etc.). Additionally, we can check for paths that complete the workflow with "No Risk."

**Path Analysis:**
Using Maude, we can search for paths that fulfill the workflow, each with its associated risk. For instance, searching for a path with "No Risk" fails in this scenario because no set of choices can complete the workflow without any risk. However, searching for paths with Availability and Integrity Risks for the configuration in Figure 5 yields the paths shown in Table 6. If we choose TR2, there is a potential integrity risk due to device DS8. Conversely, choosing TR3 introduces a potential availability risk because grounding the transformer involves using switch NR3, which has an availability risk. Other evaluations, such as using SCADA to close the switch at the task "Close Transformer Bus Breaker," are also possible but not shown.

**Recommendation:**
Given that the minimal risk for any workflow run is "Availability," we recommend that the operator choose "TR3" and, due to the dependency on the chosen transformer, manually close switch "DS12." The third workflow illustrates the evaluation after a change in the configuration (where TR3 is now grounded). Since TR3 is already grounded, the task "Ground Transformer" is no longer necessary. Therefore, the minimal risk run is the one that chooses "TR3" and offers a set of choices with no risk at all.

**Additional Notes:**
- We do not show other possible actions at other tasks, such as "Close Transformer Protection Breaker."
- Recall that the evaluated risk of a given workflow run is the least upper bound of all the risks of the individual actions performed during that run.

**Conclusion:**
In this work, we propose a security model that incorporates descriptions of the SCADA infrastructure and its workflow activities. By extending existing techniques for scalable attack graph generation, we evaluate risks and provide advisories on which workflows are safer based on a cost-lattice. We implemented a toolchain that automates most of the process of generating our models from CIM specifications. This toolchain updates configuration information dynamically from an event aggregator, ensuring accurate results.

**Future Work:**
We plan to evaluate the scalability of our approach using larger models and assess the impact on model-checking time. Currently, actions are limited to security properties associated with devices. A more realistic model would incorporate the side effects of actions and their impact on the system's state. Our model could potentially allow feedback modeling (e.g., via SMTP monitoring software) to detect changes in both device status and security provisions. Finally, we aim to expand our cost-lattice to include more properties of interest.
