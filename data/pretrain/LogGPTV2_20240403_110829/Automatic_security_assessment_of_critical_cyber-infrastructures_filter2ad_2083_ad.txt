tool and is given in Table 3. The list of possible actions also
depends on the current state of the system. For instance,
considering the conÔ¨Åguration described in Figure 5 (TR3 is
not grounded while TR2 is not), the ‚ÄúworkÔ¨Çow analysis‚Äù
tool can model-check if the Ô¨Ånal state is reachable from the
initial state (i.e., there are no deadlocks etc.,). Furthermore,
we can check if there is any path that can Ô¨Ånish the work-
Ô¨Çow with ‚ÄúNo Risk‚Äù. Searching for the paths that fulÔ¨Åll the
workÔ¨Çow in Maude gives us a list of paths each with its own
risk. For instance, searching for the path with ‚ÄúNo Risk‚Äù
fails in this scenario because there is no set of choices that
can fulÔ¨Åll the workÔ¨Çow with no risk at all. Searching for
paths with Availability and Integrity Risks for the conÔ¨Ågura-
tion in (Fig:5) gives us the paths as shown in in Table 6. Es-
sentially we see that if we choose TR2, then we have a po-
tential integrity risk 10 (because device DS8 has an integrity
risk), whereas if we choose the TR3, we have a potential
availability risk (because Grounding the Transformer, uses
switch NR3 which has an availability risk). There are also
other possible evaluations (such as using SCADA to close
the switch at the task ‚ÄúClose Transformer Bus Breaker‚Äù,
which we haven‚Äôt shown).
Since, the minimal risk for any workÔ¨Çow run is ‚ÄúAvail-
ability‚Äù , we recommend that the operator choose ‚ÄúTR3‚Äù
and (due to the dependency on the transformer chosen),
close switch ‚ÄúDS12‚Äù manually. The third workÔ¨Çow shown,
shows the evaluation after a change in the conÔ¨Åguration
(where TR3 is grounded). Note that because of the fact
that the Transformer TR3 is already grounded, we no longer
need to run the task ‚ÄúGround Transformer‚Äù and therefore
the minimal risk run is the one that chooses ‚ÄúTR3‚Äù trans-
former (as before) and there is a set of choices which the
operator can take which have no Risk at all.
9We do not show other actions possible at other tasks for instance
‚ÄúClose Transformer Protection Breaker‚Äù
10Recall that the evaluated risk of a given workÔ¨Çow run is the least upper
bound of all the risks of the individual actions performed during that run

7 Conclusion
In this work we propose a security model that incor-
porates descriptions of the SCADA infrastructure and its
workÔ¨Çow activities. By extending existing techniques for
scalable attack graph generation we evaluate risks and give
advisories on which workÔ¨Çows are safer than others based
on a cost-lattice. We implemented a tool-chain that auto-
mates most of the process of generating our models from
CIM speciÔ¨Åcations. Moreover the tool chain updates con-
Ô¨Åguration information dynamically from an event aggrega-
tor allowing our security model to give accurate results.
In the future we would like to evaluate the scalability of
our approach by using bigger models and see the impact on
the model checking time. Currently actions are limited to
security properties associated with devices. A more real-
istic model would be to incorporate side effects of actions
and their impact on the state of the system. Our model could
potentially allow feedback modeling (e.g. via SMTP mon-
itoring software) of the impact of Ô¨Åring certain actions in a
workÔ¨Çow and recalculation of the new security risks. The
feedback mechanism would allow us to detect changes in
not only status of devices but of security provisions as well.
Finally we would like to expand our cost-lattice to include
more properties of interest.
