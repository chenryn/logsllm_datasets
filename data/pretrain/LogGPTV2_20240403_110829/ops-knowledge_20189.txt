User: I have written a mapper program in python for hadoop Map-Reduce framework.
And I am executing it through the command:
hadoop jar /usr/hdp/2.3.2.0-2950/hadoop-mapreduce/hadoop-streaming.jar -mapper "python wordcount_mapper.py" -file wordcount_mapper.py -input inputfile -output outputfile3 
It is working properly if the directory inputfile contains only file.
But it is not working and showing error if there is sub directories into the directory inputfile . Like i have two sub directory in (KAKA and KAKU) in inputfile.
And the error is showing :

16/07/20 17:01:40 ERROR streaming.StreamJob: Error Launching job : Not
  a file: hdfs://secondary/user/team/inputfile/kaka

So, My question is that what will be the command to reach the files into the Sub Directory.
Assistant: Use regular expressions: 
inputfile/*   - will work for 1 level of sub directories
inputfile/*/* - will work for 2 level of sub directories 
Run As:
hadoop jar /usr/hdp/2.3.2.0-2950/hadoop-mapreduce/hadoop-streaming.jar -mapper "python wordcount_mapper.py" -file wordcount_mapper.py -input inputfile/* -output outputfile3
