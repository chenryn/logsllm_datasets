User: I'm a c# programmer by trade and looking to move my wares over to Ubuntu as a business concern. I have some experience of Python and like it a lot. My question is, as a developer which would be the best language to use when targeting ubuntu Mono c# or python as a commercial concern.
please note that I am not interested in the technical aspects but strictly the commercials of where Ubuntu is heading, I see that there is a lot of work done within using Python and thinking that maybe with the whole Mono issue of who "might" purchase them.
Assistant: I cannot say much about the market for Ubuntu. And since business is your primary concern, the programming language is, as you say yourself, secondary. I would say that in any business, choose the language and tools that solves the business problem most effectively. When release comes do your end users really care?
That said, if you can do it with Mono/C# I would encourage you to do so since you already have C# and .Net experience. But knowing a second language and development environment will only make you stronger.
