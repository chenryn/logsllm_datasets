## Abstract
The Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) enhance the authenticity and integrity of the Internet's naming system. Resolvers that validate DNS information must know the cryptographic public key used to sign the root zone. Eight years after its introduction and one year after the originally scheduled date, this key was replaced by ICANN for the first time in October 2018. ICANN deemed this event, known as a rollover, "an overwhelming success" with "no significant outages."

In this paper, we independently examine the rollover process from the events leading to its postponement in 2017 to the removal of the old key in 2019. We collected data from multiple vantage points in the DNS ecosystem throughout the rollover. Our analysis focuses on key events, including the telemetry signals that led to the postponement, the near real-time view of the actual rollover in resolvers, and the significant increase in queries to the root DNS once the old key was revoked. This study contributes significantly to identifying the causes of challenges observed during the rollover.

While the rollover passed without major issues from an end-user perspective, there are numerous opportunities for improvement and important lessons to be learned. Based on these insights, we propose enhancements to the process for future rollovers.

## 1. Introduction
The Domain Name System (DNS) is the naming system of the Internet. Since 2010, the root of the DNS has been secured with DNSSEC, adding a layer of authenticity and integrity. DNSSEC uses public-key cryptography to sign DNS content, enabling recursive resolvers to validate the authenticity of the information they receive. The sequence of cryptographic keys signing other keys is called a chain of trust, with the public key at the beginning known as a trust anchor. The Root Key Signing Key (KSK) acts as the trust anchor for DNSSEC and was added to the root zone in July 2010.

Eight years later, and after a one-year delay, the KSK was replaced for the first time, following established policy requiring regular rollovers of the Root KSK [1]. This event, referred to as the Root KSK Rollover (hereafter "the rollover"), required extensive preparation and was considered risky. Stakeholders expected, in the worst case, millions of Internet users (up to 13%) to become unable to resolve domain names [2].

ICANN, the organization responsible for coordinating and rolling the key, collected feedback from the community before the rollover. Two primary risks were identified: (i) resolvers not updating their local copy of the key [2] and (ii) resolvers unable to retrieve the key material from the root due to packet size limitations (explained in Section 2.2.1).

Leading up to the initially scheduled date of the rollover in October 2017, ICANN and stakeholders conducted measurements to estimate the potential impact of both risks. The actual impact was difficult to estimate, partly due to the introduction of a new protocol (RFC 8145 [3], explained in Section 3.1) that enabled resolvers to signal their configured key to root server operators. This protocol indicated that many resolvers only had the old key configured, leading to the decision to postpone the rollover [4]. Rescheduling the rollover allowed researchers to understand which resolvers sent this signal, and it was estimated that only a few users would be negatively affected [5]. This gave ICANN the confidence to proceed with the rollover, which was carried out on October 11, 2018. In their March 2019 review, ICANN concluded that "there were no significant outages" and that the rollover "was an overwhelming success" [6].

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the rollover, starting from the publication of the new key in July 2017 until the removal of the old key in March 2019. We use data actively and passively collected at key points in the DNS ecosystem over the entire duration of the rollover. As members of the DNS community, we supported the rollover process with timely data analyses, providing a unique perspective covering multiple vantage points. The main contributions of this paper are:

(i) The first in-depth analysis of the root KSK rollover, a unique event with a global impact.
(ii) Coverage of the event from multiple perspectives: root operators, resolver operators, and end users.
(iii) Validation of ICANN’s conclusion that the event was a success, while showing observable challenges at all stages of the rollover.
(iv) An in-depth analysis of the causes of the challenges seen at all stages of the rollover.
(v) Recommendations for improving telemetry, processes for root key management, and future rollovers.

In the remainder of the paper, we outline the basics of DNS and DNSSEC, the stages of the root rollover, and the associated risks (Section 2). Next, we introduce our measurement methods and data (Section 3). Then, we analyze the rollover in three sections: before, during, and after the rollover (Section 4). In Section 5, we discuss related work, and in Section 6, we provide recommendations based on our analysis. We conclude the paper in Section 7.

## 2. Background
This section explains the basics of DNS and DNSSEC, followed by a discussion of the Root KSK Rollover and its risks.

### 2.1 DNS and DNSSEC
The DNS uses resource records (RRs) to map domain names, such as example.com, to values. For example, an A record maps a domain name to an IPv4 address, and an NS record maps a domain name to the authoritative name server for a domain. These records are stored in a zone and made available at the domain’s authoritative name servers. End users typically use recursive caching resolvers to query for records in the DNS. The DNS is a hierarchical naming system, with the root at the top. Assuming an empty cache, a recursive resolver querying for the A record of example.com sends its first query to the authoritative name servers of the root, which refer the resolver to the authoritative name servers of .com, and finally to the name servers of example.com. Each RR also has a Time-To-Live (TTL) field that defines how long a resolver may cache the RR. Until the TTL expires, the resolver generally will not send another query for example.com but respond with the record from its cache.

**Figure 1: DNSSEC Chain of Trust, Starting at the Root**

DNSSEC allows a recursive resolver to validate that the response it receives from an authoritative name server has not been tampered with. Operators sign their records using public-key cryptography and publish the public key (in a DNSKEY RR) and the signatures (in an RRSIG RR) in the zone file. Often, operators create two keys: a Zone-Signing-Key (ZSK) used to sign most RRs and a Key-Signing-Key (KSK) to sign only the DNSKEY RRset. This is also the case for the root zone of the DNS.

DNSSEC adds a central point of trust to the DNS at the root zone—a so-called trust anchor (see Figure 1). Validating recursive resolvers, or "validators," only need to trust the KSK of the root to validate signatures in the DNS. Because the root signs a hash (DS) of the .com KSK and publishes it in its zone, and because .com also signs and publishes a hash of the example.com KSK in its zone, a chain of trust between the different domains is created. Generally, DNSSEC validation leads to one of three results: the secure state (successful verification of authenticity and integrity), the bogus state (invalid signatures), or the insecure state (unsigned response or no chain of trust). If a validator concludes a response is secure, it sets the Authenticated Data (AD) flag in its response to a client. If a response is bogus, the validator sends an error to the client with the SERVFAIL response code. If a response is insecure, the validator returns the response as-is, like a ‘classical’ DNS response.

### 2.2 The Root KSK Rollover
It is good operational practice for operators of zones signed with DNSSEC to periodically change, or "roll," the zone’s cryptographic keys. A rollover might be necessary in case of a security breach, to upgrade to a new algorithm, or to follow a key management policy [7]. The root zone’s ZSKs are rolled every calendar quarter [8]. When the root zone was first signed in 2010, it was generally accepted that the KSK would be rolled after a period of 5 years [1]. The parties involved in operating the root zone began discussing and planning a KSK rollover in 2013, but this work was put on hold when the NTIA announced its intention to transition oversight of the IANA functions to the Internet community [9]. Work on the rollover resumed in 2015, culminating in a 2016 Rollover Design Team report [2]. ICANN and Verisign, in their respective roles as the IANA Functions Operator and Root Zone Maintainer, used the design team report to develop a final set of operational plans [10].

These plans describe the process for replacing the old KSK, further referred to as KSK-2010, with a new KSK, now referred to as KSK-2017. Figure 2 shows a timeline of each phase of the rollover as described in the operational plan. We have highlighted six key events in red labeled I – VI. These six events are the focus of this paper. In the rest of this section, we explain the risks as identified in the design team report and specific considerations that stem from the special role of the root’s KSK as a trust anchor.

#### 2.2.1 Risks During the Rollover
The design team report [2] identifies two major risks: validating resolvers that are unable to configure the new KSK as a trust anchor, and the increase in response size of the DNSKEY RRset at certain stages of the rollover process.

**DNSKEY RRset Changes:** Resolvers need a copy or a hash of the root KSK and must configure it as a trust anchor. Some modern resolvers, such as BIND, ship with the current root KSK configured as a trust anchor. Thus, resolvers shipped with only KSK-2010 need a mechanism to fetch KSK-2017 before the rollover. If this does not occur, these resolvers fail validation as soon as they need to validate a signature signed with KSK-2017, when the root zone is published with its DNSKEY RRset signed by KSK-2017 (IV in Figure 2).

Resolvers that receive a DNSKEY RRset without a key that matches their trust anchor may start sending extra DNSKEY queries to the root. There are two reasons for this: First, some resolver implementations are designed to retry failures, including validation failures, at some or all of the available authoritative name servers. Second, resolvers typically cache such a failure for a short time only (so-called negative caching). Once the cached failure expires, the process starts again.
