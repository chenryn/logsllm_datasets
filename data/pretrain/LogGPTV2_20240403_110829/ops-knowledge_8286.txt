Question: You are updating an Android app to improve its security features. You decide to implement APK Signature Scheme v3 for your app's next release. Which of the following describes the correct format and purpose of the APK Signature Scheme v3?
"A": "The scheme allows for multiple signing keys and the convergence of different ancestor signing certificates to one, simplifying the management of app signatures.",
"B": "It introduces a proof-of-rotation struct to allow apps to rotate their signing certificate without being blocked by other apps, and to maintain a singly-linked list of older signing certs for trust continuity.",
"C": "The v3 scheme is designed to replace the v1 APK format completely, eliminating the need for an APK Signing Block and simplifying the installation process on Android devices.",
"D": "It supports APK key rotation by storing only the newest signing key in the APK signing block, and discards all previous keys for enhanced security."
Answer: B
