Abstract—Captchas are designed to be easy for humans but
hard for machines. However, most recent research has focused
only on making them hard for machines. In this paper, we
present what is to the best of our knowledge the ﬁrst large
scale evaluation of captchas from the human perspective, with
the goal of assessing how much friction captchas present to the
average user.
For the purpose of this study we have asked workers from
Amazon’s Mechanical Turk and an underground captcha-
breaking service to solve more than 318 000 captchas issued
from the 21 most popular captcha schemes (13 images schemes
and 8 audio scheme).
Analysis of the resulting data reveals that captchas are often
difﬁcult for humans, with audio captchas being particularly
problematic. We also ﬁnd some demographic trends indicating,
for example, that non-native speakers of English are slower in
general and less accurate on English-centric captcha schemes.
Evidence from a week’s worth of eBay captchas (14,000,000
samples) suggests that the solving accuracies found in our
study are close to real-world values, and that
improving
audio captchas should become a priority, as nearly 1% of all
captchas are delivered as audio rather than images. Finally our
study also reveals that it is more effective for an attacker to
use Mechanical Turk to solve captchas than an underground
service.
I. INTRODUCTION
Completely Automated Public Turing tests to tell Com-
puters and Humans Apart (CAPTCHAs) are widely used by
websites to distinguish abusive programs from real human
users. Captchas typically present a user with a simple test
like reading digits or listening to speech and then ask
the user to type in what they saw or heard. The image
or sound is usually distorted in various ways to make it
difﬁcult for a machine to perform the test. When successful,
captchas can prevent a wide variety of abuses, such as invalid
account creation and spam comments on blogs and forums.
Captchas are intended to be easy for humans to perform, and
difﬁcult for machines to perform. While there has been much
discussion of making captchas difﬁcult for machines (e.g.
[2], [4], [13]), to the best of our knowledge there has been
no large scale study assessing how well captchas achieve the
former goal: making it easy for humans to pass the test.
We address this problem by collecting captcha samples
from each of the 13 most used image schemes and 8 most
used audio schemes, for a total of over 318,000 captchas.

We then ask humans to solve these and analyze their
performance.
Our current annotation efforts have resulted in over 5000
captchas for each image scheme and 3500 captchas for each
audio scheme, each annotated by at least three different
humans from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. We also had an
additional 1000 captchas from each image scheme annotated
three times by an underground service which promises to
manually solve captchas in bulk. Based on an analysis of
these captchas, we make a number of important ﬁndings:
• Despite their goals, captchas are often hard for humans.
When we presented image captchas to three different
humans, all three agreed only 71% of the time on
average.
• Audio captchas are much harder than image captchas.
We found perfect agreement by three humans only 31%
of the time for audio captchas.
• Some captcha schemes are clearly harder for humans
than others. For example, three humans agreed on 93%
of authorize image captchas, but only 35% of mail.ru
image captchas.
We obtained statistics from eBay regarding 14 million
eBay captchas delivered over a week. This additional data
corroborates our Mechanical Turk and underground captcha
service statistics and underscores the importance of audio
captchas:
• Our Mechanical Turk assessment of eBay image
captchas is lower than eBay’s measured success rate:
our data shows 93.0% accuracy, compared to eBay’s
measured success rate of 98.5% on 14,000,000 eBay
site captchas.
• Evaluating the utility of audio captchas is important as
they account for almost 1% of all captchas delivered.
We also analyze human variations along a number of
demographic lines and ﬁnd some interesting trends:
• Non-native speakers of English take longer to solve
captchas, and are less accurate on captchas that include
English words.
• Humans become slightly slower and slightly more
accurate with age.
• Ph.D.s are the best at solving audio captchas.
Finally our study shows that for attackers, it is more
efﬁcient to use Mechanical Turk to solve captchas than the
underground service, as it is cheaper and more accurate.
All these ﬁndings contribute to a better understanding of
the human side of captcha tests. The remainder of the paper
is organized as follows: In Sec II, we discuss our study
methodology. In Sec. III, we introduce the 13 image and 8
audio schemes we analyzed. In Sec. IV. we provide usage
statistics for eBay on a 14 million captcha corpus gathered
over a 7 day period. In Sec. V, we present the results of our
study. In Sec VI, we discuss how the user demographics
affect the captcha solving process. In sec. VII, we present
some additional related work. Finally, we conclude and give
future directions in sec. VIII.
II. STUDY METHODOLOGY
We designed our study for two purposes: to collect infor-
mation on the speed and accuracy with which humans solve
captchas, and to collect information about a broad range
of design and demographic factors that could potentially
inﬂuence these results. To build our captcha corpus, we
collected eleven thousand captchas from the 21 most used
schemes: 13 image schemes and 8 audio schemes. In total
we scraped more than 90 000 captchas, as discussed in
section III below. For human subjects on which to test these
captchas, we relied on two sources: Amazon’s Mechanical
Turk and a underground captcha-breaking service called
Bypass-captcha.
A. Amazon’s Mechanical Turk
Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (AMT) is an online mar-
ketplace from Amazon where requesters can ﬁnd workers
to solve Human Intelligence Tasks (HITs). This service is
designed to tackle problems that are difﬁcult for a machine
to solve but should be easy for humans. Essentially, the AMT
service is intended as a way of crowd-sourcing interesting
problems, and has been used extensively to collect annotated
data on a variety of tasks, including image classiﬁcation
and ﬁltering of porn for websites. Since AMT provides
easy access to human intelligene, it is the perfect service
to conduct the task of solving captchas, which is supposed
to be easy for humans and hard for computers.
Any task that can be presented as a webpage can be
crowd-sourced through AMT, and workers will often per-
form complicated tasks for relatively small amounts of
money (for example, as little as $0.05 for solving one
of our captchas). AMT also has the advantage that
the
workers (colloquially, “Turkers”) are real people and can
be asked demographic information such as age, education
level, native language, etc., which, as we discuss in section
VI, are important for understand how taxing captchas are on
different people.
In our experiment, we presented Turkers ﬁrst with a
survey asking the following demographic information:
400
• Age
• Native language (one from the Wikipedia list1)
• Education (one of: no formal education, high school,
bachelors degree, masters degree, Ph.D)
• (If native language is not English) Years studying
• Industry (one of the United States Bureau of Labor
Standard Occupational Classiﬁcations)
• Country of birth
• Country of residence
• Years using the internet
• Frequency of internet use (daily, weekly, monthly or
English
yearly)
After ﬁlling out this survey, Turkers were then presented
with 39 image captchas or 24 audio captchas, one at a time,
and asked to type in their answers. We built a task scheduler
to ensure that three Turkers (see Sec. V) saw each captcha
even though some Turkers gave up on some tasks. As a
result, we ended up effectively having more that 318 000
captchas annotated by Turkers. In particular we had a very
high give up rate, around 50%, for audio captchas as they
are tedious to solve.
Our task scheduler presented the captchas to Turkers in
two different ways to make sure the order did not inﬂuence
the results of the study:
• Random Order: Fully randomly, where any captcha
from any scheme could follow any other.
• Blocks of Three: In blocks of three captchas from
the same scheme, where the schemes were ordered
randomly.
For each captcha, we recorded the time a Turker took to
solve it and their ﬁnal response2. Turkers were then paid
anywhere from $0.02 to $0.50 for solving their full set of
39 image or 24 audio captchas.
B. Underground captcha-Breaking Service
We also investigated using a underground captcha-
breaking service, captcha-bypass.com. This service promises
that captchas submitted to them will be solved by “qualiﬁed
specialists” for $0.005 per captcha. They used to provide
an web service that can be accessed via an application
programming interface (API) available for .Net, C++. PHP
and Java. Since it is a web based service, HTTP call can
also be used to interact with it from any language.
For the purpose of this study we used the PHP API
to collect data on accuracy and solving time. Of course,
the demographic information available through AMT is not
available through this service. However, we performed this
experiment because to the best of our knowledge, there

speakers
2We also recorded information about
their computing environment,
including their browser and operating system, with the hope of using this
information in furture research
have been no previous studies on how efﬁcient underground
services are at solving captchas, and this experiment can
therefore shed some light on an unexplored corner of the
black market. Overall we submitted 39000 captchas to this
service.
Baidu.
Baidu.com is the most popular Chinese search engine. Image
captchas from baidu.com consist of four black digits and
uppercase letters on a white background. To obfuscate
the text, a wavy line is drawn across the characters and
characters are individually tilted and placed so as to overlap
one another.

III. CAPTCHA COLLECTION
To run our study on humans, we ﬁrst needed to collect
a large number of captchas representative of what people
encounter on the web. We consulted the Alexa list of most
used websites3 and identiﬁed the top sites which presented
captchas as part of their account registration process. We
also collected captchas from sites which provide captchas to
other sites, e.g. recaptcha.net and captchas.net. We looked
both for image captchas and for audio captchas, which are
sometimes provided as an alternative to image captchas as an
accessibility measure. For each scheme, we collected 11,000
captchas. Tables I and II compare some of the features of
the captchas from each of these schemes, and the following
sections give a little more detail about the sites and their
captchas.
A. Image captchas
Authorize.
Authorize.net is a gateway through which other sites can ac-
cept credit cards and electronic check payments ala Paypal.
Image captchas from authorize.net consist of ﬁve black digits
and lowercase letters on a white background. To obfuscate
the text, the character sequence as a whole is squeezed and
tilted to varying degrees, and both the characters and the
background are spotted lightly with gray dots.
3http://www.alexa.com/topsites
captchas.net provides captchas to other sites such as
www.blog.de and www.blog.co.uk. Image captchas from
captchas.net consist of a white background with six black
lowercase letters. To obfuscate the text, individual characters
are randomly rotated and shifted up or down and spotted
with small white dots, and the background is spotted thickly
with small black dots.
digg.com.
Digg.com is a site where users can post web links and vote
on the links posted by others that they ﬁnd most interesting.
Image captchas from digg.com consist of ﬁve black digits
and letters (upper and lowercase) on a white and gray striped
background. To obfuscate the text, individual characters are
randomly rotated and shifted up or down, and a dense cross-
hatch of thin black and gray lines is drawn across the image.
eBay.
Ebay.com is the world’s largest online marketplace, where
users can buy and sell almost anything. Image captchas from
