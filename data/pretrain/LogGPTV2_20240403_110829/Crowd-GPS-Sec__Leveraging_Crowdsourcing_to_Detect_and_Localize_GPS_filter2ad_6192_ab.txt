Fig. 3. Cumulative distribution function (CDF) of deviation between spoofed
and reported position messages of the PowerFLARM Core transponder.
We put all devices in vicinity of each other and spoof
tracks with speeds of 0, 6, 30, 100, 300, and 1,000 km/h,
respectively. The difference between the fake target positions
emitted by the spoofer and the reported positions in the Flarm
advertisements is plotted in Figure 3. While the deviation
becomes larger with increasing speed, our experiments conﬁrm
that an attacker can exactly control the derived position and
speed at the Flarm devices. Even for speeds up to 1,000 km/h,
the deviation of both spoofed devices is always smaller
than 160 m, and thus signiﬁcantly smaller than the mandated
separation minima in aviation [35]. These experiments also
conﬁrm that such commercial transponders as deployed in
aerial vehicles do not perform plausibility checks on the
GPS signal input and simply report the spoofed GPS data
in the advertisement messages. This result is inline with air
trafﬁc communications not being protected against wireless
attacks [36].
GPS Spooﬁng Coverage Estimation. To validate the as-
sumption that a GPS spoofer will affect the GPS receivers
of multiple aerial vehicles at the same time, we evaluate the
reception range of a spoofer using the free-space path loss
model and a typical airspace density model as observed by
the OpenSky Network in the European airspace.
Since the power of GPS signals at the Earth’s surface is
very low (approx. −160 dBW), the necessary power to create
adequate spooﬁng signals is accordingly low. We assume an
attacker with standard equipment, who can reasonably achieve
a generated signal power of 15 dBm (USRP2 [37]) coupled
with an exemplary antenna gain of 12 dBi in the main lobe.
We also consider an additional signal attenuation at aircraft of
approx. 30 dB due to the fuselage and the downward direction.
Based on these estimations, we can calculate the reception
range with regard to the free-space path loss [38]:
Lfs = 32.45 + 20 log10(dkm) + 20 log10(fMHz),
(1)
where dkm is the distance between the source of the signal and
the receiver in kilometers and fMHz is the signal frequency
given in megahertz; the constant of 32.45 depends on the

beamwidth and the inclination angle. The ﬁgure uses a realistic airspace
density sampled from OpenSky Network data.
utilized units. The resulting reception range is based on the
signal power impaired by all attenuation sources and the
distance d from Equation (1):
Power − Lfs(d) − Attenuation ≥ −160 [dBW],
which results in a distance d of approx. 34 km. Considering
our parameter estimations, all aircraft within the main lobe
closer than 34 km will receive the spooﬁng signal with at
least −160 dBW.
In general, an attacker will be interested to exceed these
power levels to ensure the takeover of the GPS lock at the
intended targets. However, to remain as stealthy as possible,
the attacker is likely to use an attack setup with directional
antennas to avoid a wide signal broadcast detectable by, e. g.,
ground-based signal power sensors. A directional antenna
setup is characterized by its beamwidth inﬂuencing the signal
spread and the inclination angle determining how the main
lobe of the signal beam is targeted. Notably, an attack on
moving targets requires to increase the beamwidth and to use
higher inclination angles, resulting in a certain proliferation of
the affected area.
Based on data from the OpenSky Network of the European
airspace, we perform a conservative estimate of the average
number of aircraft affected by a spooﬁng attack targeting
a randomly selected aircraft, as shown in Figure 4. The
◦ beamwidth) is an attacker that can perfectly
baseline (0
pinpoint a victim, thus avoiding secondary targets. Such a
small beamwidth is however impossible to achieve in practice
and would further be very sensitive to small orientation errors
of the antenna. As we can see, already small beamwidths
and inclination angles span enough space to affect several
aircraft around the intended target, making it highly likely to
hit several additional aircraft. The assumption that our work
relies on is therefore realistic for dense airspaces such as found
in Europe.

III. CROWD-GPS-SEC
We propose Crowd-GPS-Sec as an independent system
infrastructure on the ground that continuously analyzes the
contents and the time of arrival of Flarm and ADS-B position
advertisements. As its name suggests, Crowd-GPS-Sec relies
on crowdsourcing to monitor those messages at global scale.
The sensors used for Crowd-GPS-Sec are part of the growing
OpenSky Network [39], a crowdsourcing initiative with the
purpose to make air trafﬁc communication data available to
the public.
The vast majority of the sensors are installed and operated
by aviation enthusiasts and volunteers which support
the
cause of the network. As of this writing, it collects more
than 200,000 messages per second at peak times from over
700 sensors which are distributed all over the world2 as shown
in Figure 5. Europe and the American continent exhibit a
particular high density of sensors such that individual position
advertisement messages are most likely being received by
more than four sensors.
The goals of Crowd-GPS-Sec are to detect GPS spoof-
ing attacks on aerial vehicles as quickly as possible and
to localize the position of the spoofer(s). To achieve these
goals, Crowd-GPS-Sec has three modules which continuously
process all position advertisements that are received from the
OpenSky Network, as shown in Figure 6. The multilatera-
tion (MLAT) module estimates the location of the aircraft
based on the time difference of arrival (TDoA) of position
advertisements between different sensors. This module is
fundamental to Crowd-GPS-Sec as it allows us to determine
the true position of the aircraft independently of the content
of the advertised messages. The spooﬁng detection module
checks for inconsistencies between multilaterated positions
and GPS-derived positions in the advertisement messages as
well as for inconsistencies between position advertisements
from different aircraft (e. g., when two aircraft advertise the
same position at the same time). The spoofer localization
module, ﬁnally, is triggered only when the spooﬁng detection
module has detected a GPS spoofer. It then estimates the
position of the spoofer by analyzing time differences between

which are then processed by Crowd-GPS-Sec for spooﬁng detection and
spoofer localization.
received positions in advertisements from the aircraft and the
true position as estimated by MLAT. We describe the modules
in the next three subsections.
A. Multilateration (MLAT)
The implementation of MLAT as an independent aircraft
localization will serve as an auxiliary component for one of
the spooﬁng detection tests and the subsequent spoofer local-
ization. To implement such a system, we make use of the fact
that in regions with high sensor density position advertisement
messages are received by multiple geographically distributed
sensors. Each message is timestamped at the receiver on arrival
and can be represented as a simpliﬁed tuple of the reported
position and the time of arrival:
ADS-B/Flarm Report := (ˆai, ts),
(2)
where ˆai denotes the reported position of aircraft i as derived
by GPS and ts is the timestamp as generated by sensor s.
Since the sensors are geographically distributed, propaga-
tion distances of the transmitted signals differ. Hence, the same
broadcasted message is timestamped differently at diverse sen-
sors. If the sensors are synchronized to the same global clock,
e. g., by GPS time synchronization, and are deployed at known
positions, we can formulate relations between the propagation
distances and the differences in the time of arrival (TDoA):
dist(si, A) − dist(sj, A) = Δti,j · c,
(3)
where si, sj denotes the position of sensor i and sensor j. The
TDoA of the same message from reference aircraft A between
these sensors is Δti,j = ti − tj, and c is the speed of light.
Equation (3) is fulﬁlled for all points that have the same
distance difference to both considered sensors determined by
the TDoA. By construction of at least four relations of this
type, we perform multilateration to approximate the position
of the targeted aircraft. Geometrically, each relation describes
a hyperbola in 2D and a hyperboloid in 3D. The intersecting
point of all relations indicates the aircraft position. Figure 7
provides a visual interpretation of this multilateration process.

B. GPS Spooﬁng Detection
Spooﬁng detection is the ﬁrst step in a mitigation strategy
to counter GPS spooﬁng attacks. The idea of Crowd-GPS-Sec
to detect GPS spooﬁng attacks is based on the broadcasted
ADS-B/Flarm reports containing potentially spoofed position-
ing information. We propose a veriﬁcation process consisting
of two complementary checks.
1) Time Alignment of Transmissions: Since ADS-B/Flarm
messages are broadcasted at variable transmission times, we
need to time-align those reports in order to make them
comparable. This is achieved by incorporating the results from
the MLAT computation. To align the position reports to a
reference global time, two steps are performed subsequently.
The ﬁrst step yields the transmission time tTX at which the
GPS-derived position was reported:
tTX = ts − dist(s, a)
c
,
(4)
with ts being the time at which sensor s has timestamped
the message, dist(s, a) representing the Euclidean distance
between the considered sensor and aircraft, and c being the
speed of light.
The second step is an interpolation to approximate the
aircraft position aREF at a global reference time tREF. We
need to consider the following three cases:
aTX·(tTX+1−tREF)+aTX+1·(tREF−tTX)
tTX+1−tTX
aTX
aTX·(tREF−tTX−1)+aTX−1·(tTX−tREF)
tTX−tTX−1
tTX  tREF
⎧⎪⎨
⎪⎩
aREF =
with aTX = ˆa denoting the aircraft position at transmission
time, TX−1, TX, and TX+1 being the previous, current, and
next transmission event, respectively. After this interpolation,
all reported positions are time-aligned and can be compared
with respect to the same time basis. In the remainder of this
paper, we assume time-aligned positions.

where i and j denote two different aircraft, ˆai and ˆaj are the
GPS-derived positions of aircraft i and aircraft j, dist() is the
Euclidean distance function, and T2 is a threshold tolerating
the GPS positioning noise. Choosing an appropriate T2 de-
pends on the mandated separation minima in the considered
airspace and the accuracy of the GPS information provided via
position reports. However, as accuracy is one of the design
goals of ADS-B and Flarm and the separation minima are
usually in the order of kilometers, a threshold as small as a
few hundreds of meters is appropriate.
