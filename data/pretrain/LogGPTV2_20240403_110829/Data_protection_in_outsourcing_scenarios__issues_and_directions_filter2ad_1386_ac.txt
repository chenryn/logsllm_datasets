|---------------|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Hypertension  | Nancy | 65/12/07  | White     |
| Gastritis     |       | 73/01/05  | Black     |
| Flu           | Ned   | 86/03/31  | Red       |
| Asthma        | Nell  | 90/07/19  | Asian     |
| Gastritis     | Nick  | 55/05/22  | White     |
| Obesity       | Noel  | 32/11/22  | Red       |
| Measles       | Nora  | 68/08/14  | Asian     |

### Group Definitions
- \( c0 = \{SSN\} \)
- \( c1 = \{Name, Illness\} \)
- \( c2 = \{Name, DoB\} \)
- \( c3 = \{Race, DoB, Illness\} \)

### Fragmentation
- **Fl (Left Fragment)**
  - Red
  - Red
  - Name | Race
  - Nancy | White
  - Noel
  - Nell
  - Nicole | White
  - Ned | Black
  - Nick
  - Nora | Asian
  - Norman | Hispanic

- **Fr (Right Fragment)**
  - Illness | DoB
  - Hypertension | 65/12/07
  - Gastritis | 73/01/05
  - Flu | 86/03/31
  - Asthma | 90/07/19
  - Gastritis | 55/05/22
  - Hypertension | 73/01/05
  - Obesity | 32/11/22
  - Measles | 68/08/14

## k-Loose Association
- An association is k-loose if every group association indistinguishably corresponds to at least k distinct associations among tuples.
- The degree of looseness characterizes the privacy and utility of the associations.
  - The probability of an association existing in the original relation may change from \( \frac{1}{\text{card(relation)}} \) to \( \frac{1}{k} \).
- If grouping satisfies given heterogeneity properties, the group association is guaranteed to be k-loose with \( k = k_l \cdot k_r \):
  - **Group Heterogeneity**: Ensures diversity of tuples within groups.
  - **Association Heterogeneity**: Ensures that for each real tuple in the original relation, there are at least \( k_l \cdot k_r \) pairs in the group association that may correspond to it.
  - **Deep Heterogeneity**: Ensures that all \( k_l \cdot k_r \) pairs in the group association to which each tuple could correspond contain diverse values for attributes involved in constraints.

## Group Heterogeneity
- No group can contain tuples that have the same values for the attributes involved in constraints covered by \( F_l \) and \( F_r \).
- Ensures diversity of tuples within groups.

## Association Heterogeneity
- No group can be associated twice with another group (the group association cannot contain any duplicates).
- Ensures that for each real tuple in the original relation, there are at least \( k_l \cdot k_r \) pairs in the group association that may correspond to it.

## Deep Heterogeneity
- No group can be associated with two groups that contain tuples that have the same values for the attributes involved in a constraint covered by \( F_l \) and \( F_r \).
- Ensures that all \( k_l \cdot k_r \) pairs in the group association to which each tuple could correspond contain diverse values for attributes involved in constraints.

## Research Directions
- Balance between encryption and fragmentation.
- Schema vs. instance constraints.
- Data dependencies not captured by confidentiality constraints.
- Enforcement of different kinds of queries.
- Visibility requirements.
- Balancing privacy and utility.
- External knowledge.

## Conclusions
- The development of information technologies presents:
  - New needs and risks for privacy.
  - New opportunities for protecting privacy.
- Many opportunities for new open issues to be addressed.
- Towards allowing society to fully benefit from information technology while enjoying security and privacy.
