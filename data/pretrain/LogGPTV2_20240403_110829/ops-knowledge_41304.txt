User: I've tried googling & looking up some other people's questions. However, I still couldn't find a clear/simple recipe to install PIL (for python 2.6 or 2.7) on mac os x 10.7.2 Lion.
Assistant: I was trying to execute a Python script with administrative privileges in a Mac (running on Lion) and looking at this post I found out that all I needed to do was launch Python with Administrative privileges by using the "sudo" command in the Terminal.
Like that: "sudo Python" and then executing the script.
I know it is pretty basic but it was exactly what I needed to get my script working...
