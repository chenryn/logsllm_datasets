User: How to set a fixed IP address under Linux?
Assistant: The steps to set a fixed IP address under Linux are as follows: 1. Open the terminal, enter the command ifconfig -a to view the current network configuration, and find the name of the network card to be set (usually eth0 or enp0s3, etc.). 2. To edit the network configuration file, enter the command sudo vi /etc/network/interfaces to enter the editing mode. 3. Add the following content at the end of the file, and replace the network card name, IP address, subnet mask, gateway address, and DNS server address with your own values. Note: IPv6 address needs to be set additionally. auto eth0 iface eth0 inet static address 192.168.1.100 netmask 255.255.255.0 gateway 192.168.1.1 dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4 4. Save the file and exit the edit mode, enter the command: wq. 5. To restart the network service, enter the command sudo service networking restart. 6. Check whether the IP address is set successfully, and enter the command ifconfig to check whether the IP address is the set value. Note: 1. To ensure that the set IP address does not conflict with other devices, you can use the ping command to test whether the IP address is available. 2. After Ubuntu 18.04, the network configuration file is /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml, and corresponding entries need to be added to this file to configure the IP address. For specific operations, refer to the official Ubuntu documentation.
