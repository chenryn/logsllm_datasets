**ATT&CK ID:** S0089  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** BlackEnergy

One variant of the BlackEnergy malware identifies existing driver services that have been disabled and drops its driver component into the path of one of these services, replacing the legitimate executable. The malware then configures the hijacked service to start automatically, thereby establishing persistence on the system.[1]
