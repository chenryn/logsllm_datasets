Certainly! Here is a more polished and professional version of your text:

For example:
```javascript
var geometry = new THREE.BoxBufferGeometry(1, 1, 1);
var material = new THREE.MeshNormalMaterial();
var mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
var m = new THREE.Mesh().copy(mesh);

console.log(m.geometry); // BufferGeometry with no attributes
console.log(m.material); // MeshBasicMaterial
```

Similarly, the `copy` method for `Line`, `LineSegments`, and `Points` exhibits the same behavior. However, it's important to note that the `Sprite` class does not copy the material when using the `copy` method.

This version improves readability by using consistent formatting and clear language. It also provides a more coherent flow and context for the code example and the subsequent explanation.
