increased without degrading the performance of individual
applications. To demonstrate this, we use Fig. 10 as an ex-
ample. Fig. 10 illustrates that Shiraz ﬁnds an optimal point
(i.e., k = 26) and Shiraz improves the overall useful work by
33 hours at this optimal point for the two given applications
with a checkpointing overhead ratio (δ-factor) of 100×. The
total runtime is 1000 hours and the MTBF is 5 hours. We use
20 hours and 5 hours MTBF to represent the failure rate of a
petascale and exascale systems, respectively [13, 25]. Note
that these failure rates are conservative estimates.
For deeper analysis, Fig. 10 also shows region of interest
where none of the two applications is being hurt and there
is an opportunity for improving the overall system through-
put. Simulation results (which can take more than a few
hours in some cases) conﬁrm the same optimal point as the
model predicts (which takes a few seconds). In fact, Table 2
shows that Shiraz model estimates the same optimal switch-
ing point as the simulation across different scenarios — the
maximum difference in the estimations is 2, which results
in a difference of less than 0.5% in the throughput improve-
ment. The δ-factor is the ratio of checkpointing overheads
of the heavy-weight and the light-weight applications (the
heavy-weight application’s checkpoint takes 30 mins).
In summary, Shiraz model can successfully identify re-
gions of beneﬁt and determine the optimal switching point
much more quickly than extensive simulation based method.
The next question to investigate is: how does the improve-
ment vary across scenario and the reasons behind that?
Impact of Shiraz on system throughput and individual
application performance: Next, we demonstrate that Shi-
raz improves overall system throughput without hurting in-
dividual applications’ performance for different situations.
Fig. 11 shows that Shiraz’s optimal switching point improves
system throughput (overall useful work done per unit time)
(a) as the scale of the system changes (MTBF changes),
and (b) as the checkpointing overhead ratio between the
heavy-weight and light-weight application changes (δ-factor
changes). From Fig. 11, we make following observations:
(1) Shiraz improves the system throughput in all cases
and does not penalize individual applications. In fact, Shi-
raz improves the performance of individual applications in
all cases. In the exascale case, both light-weight and heavy-
weight applications on an average observe approximately
