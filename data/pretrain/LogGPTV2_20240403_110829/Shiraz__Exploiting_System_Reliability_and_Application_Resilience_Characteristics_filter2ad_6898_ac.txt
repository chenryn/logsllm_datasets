### Analysis of Shiraz Performance and System Throughput

**Introduction:**
To demonstrate the effectiveness of Shiraz in improving system throughput without degrading the performance of individual applications, we use Figure 10 as an example. This figure shows that Shiraz identifies an optimal switching point (k = 26) where the overall useful work is increased by 33 hours for two given applications, with a checkpointing overhead ratio (δ-factor) of 100×. The total runtime is 1000 hours, and the Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) is 5 hours.

**Failure Rates:**
We use MTBF values of 20 hours and 5 hours to represent the failure rates of petascale and exascale systems, respectively [13, 25]. These values are conservative estimates.

**Deeper Analysis:**
Figure 10 also highlights a region of interest where neither application is adversely affected, and there is potential for improving the overall system throughput. Simulation results, which can take several hours to complete, confirm the same optimal switching point as predicted by the Shiraz model, which takes only a few seconds. Table 2 shows that the Shiraz model consistently estimates the optimal switching point across different scenarios, with a maximum difference of 2, resulting in a throughput improvement difference of less than 0.5%. The δ-factor is defined as the ratio of checkpointing overheads between the heavy-weight and light-weight applications, with the heavy-weight application's checkpoint taking 30 minutes.

**Summary:**
The Shiraz model successfully identifies beneficial regions and determines the optimal switching point much more quickly than extensive simulation-based methods. The next question to investigate is how the improvement varies across different scenarios and the reasons behind these variations.

**Impact on System Throughput and Individual Application Performance:**
Next, we demonstrate that Shiraz improves overall system throughput without penalizing individual applications' performance under various conditions. Figure 11 illustrates that Shiraz's optimal switching point enhances system throughput (overall useful work done per unit time) as the scale of the system changes (MTBF changes) and as the checkpointing overhead ratio between the heavy-weight and light-weight applications changes (δ-factor changes).

**Observations from Figure 11:**
1. **System Throughput Improvement:** Shiraz improves system throughput in all cases and does not penalize individual applications. In fact, it enhances the performance of both light-weight and heavy-weight applications.
2. **Exascale Case:** In the exascale case, both light-weight and heavy-weight applications, on average, observe significant improvements in performance.

**Conclusion:**
Shiraz provides consistent improvements across different scenarios, as shown in Figure 11. For all cases, the total runtime is 1000 hours, and the checkpoint duration (δ) of the heavyweight application is 0.5 hours. The model's ability to quickly identify optimal switching points makes it a valuable tool for enhancing system throughput and individual application performance.
