The referenced control is Select Field:

Select Field is a great component, but it lacks a feature that would be useful
for a lot of use cases. It would be great to be able to select more than one
item from the dropdown list.
For example, if "multiselect" mode is enabled, dropdown could be rendered as a
list of checkboxes and the dropdown value would be an array of currently
selected items.
Optionally, it would be nice to show comma-separated list of currently
selected items as the text of closed SelectField. (Tolerating the current
width of the control and showing all values in tooltip)
