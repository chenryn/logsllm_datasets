To  investigate  the  efficiency  of  the  proposed  design, 
some  important  SEU-tolerant  latches  and  our  proposed 
latch were analyzed and SEU injection experiments were 
carried out  by  the  means  of  HSPICE  tool.  Experimental 
results  showed  that  the  proposed  latch  can  tolerate  the 
effects  of  SEU  in  all  of  the  critical  nodes.  Also  it  was 
shown that there are some critical nodes in the previous 
proposed latches that were still vulnerable to SEUs.  
To  demonstrate  the  power  dissipation,  performance 
and  area  overheads  of  the  proposed  design,  simulations 
for 250nm, 180nm, 130nm, 90nm and 65nm technologies 
were  performed  and  compared  with  TMR  which  is  the 
effective method to completely tolerate the SEU effects. 
According  to  the  results,  the  proposed  latch  consumes 
50% less power and occupies 42% less area as compared 
with the TMR-latch regardless the technology size, while 
its reliability is almost the same as TMR-latch. 
The  switching  power  is  the  dominant  part  of  the 
dynamic power in a CMOS circuit. The switching power 
is proportional to the total capacitance, the supply voltage, 
the  clock  frequency  and 
the  expected  number  of 
transitions  per  clock  cycle   [30].  Since  switching  power 
dissipation is in direct proportion to switching activity of 
the  circuit  nodes,  it  can  be  minimized  by  performing 
circuit  optimization.  Since  in  the  TMR-latch  two  extra 
latches  along  with  some  other  circuits  is  exploited  only 
for 
the  switching  activity 
increases significantly in comparison with a simple latch. 
In  fact  the  redundancy  for  reliability  objectives  always 
increases 
in  extra 
switching power dissipation. As in the proposed latch, the 
number  of  transistors  is  reduced  by  about  50%  in 
comparison  with  the  TMR-latch,  the  switching  activity 
decreases by the same amount i.e., it consumes about 50% 
less switching power than the TMR-latch.  
the  switching  activity  resulting 
reliability  enhancement, 
On the other hand, the leakage current which is caused 
by the off-state transistors in the circuit is the main source 
of  leakage  power  dissipation.  Therefore  if  the  average 
number of off-state transistors per clock cycle is reduced 
in a design, the amount of leakage power dissipation will 
be also decreased. Since the number of transistors in the 
proposed latch is about half of the TMR-latch, the average 
number of off-state transistor per clock cycle is definitely 
diminished. 
The simulation for power dissipation is performed for 
250nm,  180nm,  130nm,  90nm  and  65nm  technologies 
using HSPICE tool. As it shown in Figure 19, the amount 
of total power dissipation is on average 50% of the TMR-
latch  regardless  of  the  technology  size.  As  mentioned 
earlier, the leakage power becomes the dominant part of 
total  power  dissipation  when  technology  shrinks.  But 
based on our simulation results the power reduction in the 
proposed latch is independent of the used technology. In 
the  other  words,  although 
sub-micron 
technologies  such  as  65nm 
is 
comparable  to  dynamic  power  but  it  can  be  seen  from 
Figure 19 that the total power reduction in the proposed 
latch is still remained at about 50%. Therefore it can be 
concluded that in the proposed latch the average number 
of off-state transistors per clock cycle is also about half of 
the TMR-latch.

leakage  power 
In short, the simulation results reveal that the proposed 
latch  has  approximately  50%  reduction  both  in  dynamic 
and  leakage  powers.  Therefore  it  makes  the  proposed 
SEU-tolerant  latch  suitable  for  use  in  deep  sum-micron 
technologies. 
In  order  to  investigate  the  power  efficiency  of  a 
method it is mandatory to consider the amount of imposed 
performance overhead too. Power delay product which is 
interpreted  as  energy  per  result  is  the  most  widely  used 
metric  to  compare  low  power  design  techniques   [30]. 
Some other simulations are carried out in order to extract 
the  propagation  delay  of  the  proposed  and  TMR-latch. 
Figure  20  shows  that  the  propagation  delay  of  the 
proposed  latch  is  less  than  the  TMR-latch  in  all
