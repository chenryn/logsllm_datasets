To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed design, we analyzed several Single-Event Upset (SEU)-tolerant latches and conducted SEU injection experiments using the HSPICE tool. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed latch can withstand SEU effects at all critical nodes, whereas previously proposed latches still had vulnerable critical nodes.

To further assess the power dissipation, performance, and area overheads of the proposed design, simulations were performed for 250nm, 180nm, 130nm, 90nm, and 65nm technologies. These results were compared with Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR), a widely recognized method for complete SEU tolerance. Our findings indicate that the proposed latch consumes 50% less power and occupies 42% less area than TMR-latch, regardless of the technology size, while maintaining comparable reliability.

In CMOS circuits, switching power is the dominant component of dynamic power. This power is proportional to the total capacitance, supply voltage, clock frequency, and the expected number of transitions per clock cycle [30]. Since switching power dissipation is directly related to the switching activity of circuit nodes, it can be minimized through circuit optimization. In TMR-latches, two additional latches and other circuits are used, which significantly increase the switching activity compared to a simple latch. Redundancy for reliability purposes always leads to increased switching power dissipation. By reducing the number of transistors by approximately 50% in the proposed latch, the switching activity and, consequently, the switching power consumption, are also reduced by about 50%.

Leakage current, caused by off-state transistors, is the primary source of leakage power dissipation. Reducing the average number of off-state transistors per clock cycle will decrease the leakage power dissipation. Given that the proposed latch has about half the number of transistors as the TMR-latch, the average number of off-state transistors per clock cycle is also halved.

Simulations for power dissipation were conducted for 250nm, 180nm, 130nm, 90nm, and 65nm technologies using the HSPICE tool. As shown in Figure 19, the total power dissipation of the proposed latch is, on average, 50% of that of the TMR-latch, irrespective of the technology size. While leakage power becomes more significant as technology scales down, our simulation results show that the power reduction in the proposed latch remains consistent across different technologies. Therefore, it can be concluded that the average number of off-state transistors per clock cycle in the proposed latch is also about half that of the TMR-latch.

In summary, the simulation results reveal that the proposed latch achieves approximately 50% reduction in both dynamic and leakage powers, making it suitable for use in deep sub-micron technologies.

To fully investigate the power efficiency of a method, it is essential to consider the performance overhead. Power delay product, often interpreted as energy per result, is a widely used metric for comparing low-power design techniques [30]. Additional simulations were carried out to extract the propagation delay of the proposed and TMR-latches. As illustrated in Figure 20, the propagation delay of the proposed latch is consistently lower than that of the TMR-latch across all tested technologies.
