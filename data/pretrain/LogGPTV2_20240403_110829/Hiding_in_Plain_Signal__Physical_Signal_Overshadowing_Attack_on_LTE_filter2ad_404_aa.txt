Abstract
Long-Term Evolution (LTE) communication is based on
an open medium; thus, a legitimate signal can potentially
be counterfeited by a malicious signal. Although most LTE
signaling messages are protected from modiﬁcation using
cryptographic primitives, broadcast messages in LTE have
never been integrity protected. In this paper, for the ﬁrst time,
we present a signal injection attack that exploits the funda-
mental weaknesses of broadcast messages in LTE and mod-
iﬁes a transmitted signal over the air. This attack, which is
referred to as signal overshadowing (named SigOver) has sev-
eral advantages and differences when compared with existing
attacks using a fake base station. For example, with a 3 dB
power difference from a legitimate signal, the SigOver attack
demonstrated a 98% success rate when compared with the
80% success rate of attacks achieved using a fake base station,
even with a 35 dB power difference. Given that the SigOver
attack is a novel primitive attack, it yields ﬁve new attack
scenarios and implications. Finally, a discussion on two po-
tential countermeasures leaves practical and robust defense
mechanism as a future work.
1 Introduction
Long-Term Evolution (LTE) technology utilizes broadcast sig-
nals to transmit essential information from a cellular network
to user devices. At minimum, the information broadcasted by
an LTE base station, which is referred to as an evolved NodeB
(eNB), includes the synchronization information and radio re-
source conﬁgurations required for a User Equipment (UE) to
access the cellular network. Based on the received broadcast
signals, a UE registers with the network by performing an
Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) procedure. After
registration, the UE monitors the broadcast signals for various
objectives. For example, when the UE does not have a con-
nection with an eNB due to its inactivity, it needs to listen to
paging messages regularly to check the messages transmitted
to it.Even when the UE has an active connection with an eNB,
the UE keeps listening broadcast signals to determine poten-
tial changes in system-wide radio conﬁgurations which are
required to be updated, and to identify the arrival of messages
intended to multiple UEs.
Despite its various practical applications, the broadcast sig-
nal is not security-protected at all. In LTE, communication
between a UE and network is secured only after successful
authentication and security handshake procedures, namely
Non-Access Stratum (NAS) and Access Stratum (AS) secu-
rity mode procedures for the protection of unicast messages.
Unprotected broadcast signals may be unavoidable to a cer-
tain extent in wireless communication; however, they subject
the system and UEs to various vulnerabilities that can be
exploited.
Previous studies [21, 26, 36, 39, 40] reported on several
attacks that exploit unprotected broadcast signals. In general,
such attacks employ a fake base station (FBS) that attracts
UEs to be connected to itself by transmitting a signal stronger
than those of the legitimate base stations. The attacks mainly
exploit the paging messages, resulting in undesirable effects
on the UE, e.g., out-of-service and battery drains. Notably,
such FBS-based attacks entail noticeable characteristics (e.g.,
high signal power) and/or outcomes (e.g., service denial) that
enable the victim UEs to identify the presence of the FBS
(see Section 3.5 for details).
In this paper, we propose a new approach referred to as the
SigOver attack, which injects a manipulated broadcast signal
into UEs without employing an FBS. The SigOver attack over-
writes a portion of the legitimate signal using the manipulated
attack signal. The SigOver attack is based on the fact that the
UE decodes a stronger signal when it concurrently receives
multiple overlapping signals, which is referred to as the cap-
ture effect [51]. The main technical component of the attack
is to synchronize the timing of the attack signal with that of
the targeted legitimate signal so that the UE only decodes the
attack signal (see Section 3). This attack is both stealthy and
far-reaching. It is stealthy because the attack signal, which is
transmitted at a signiﬁcantly low power level, only overshad-
ows the targeted signal; whereas the other signals/messages
between the victim UEs and network remain intact. It is far-

reaching because the attack signal can simultaneously affect
a large number of nearby UEs with low signaling and a low
computational cost. Note that the SigOver attack does not
require any active communication with the UEs, and it does
not relay messages between UEs and an eNB.
The SigOver attack is the ﬁrst practical realization of the
signal overshadowing attack on the LTE broadcast signals
using a low-cost Software Deﬁned Radio (SDR) platform and
open source LTE library [43]. The SigOver attack was made
practical by addressing the following challenge: time and fre-
quency synchronization. To overshadow the legitimate signal
using the malicious signal, the SigOver attack needs to be
tightly time-synchronized with the eNB’s downlink physical
channel to which the victim UE is listening. To achieve time
synchronization, we leverage the synchronization signals of
the eNB that are transmitted periodically with a ﬁxed time
gap. For accurate frequency synchronization, we employ a
Global Positioning System (GPS) disciplined oscillator.
The feasibility of the SigOver attack was veriﬁed by testing
it against 10 smartphones (listed in Section 5) connected to
an operational network1. For the experiments, we introduced
ﬁve new attack scenarios, which included the signaling storm,
denial of service (DoS) against UEs, network downgrade, and
UE location tracking (Section 5). The experimental results
reveal that the SigOver attack overshadows the target signal
and causes the victim device to decode it with a 98% success
rate and a power difference of only 3 dB from a legitimate
signal. On the other hand, attacks utilizing an FBS have only
80% success rate even with a 35 dB power difference. This
implies that the SigOver attack is signiﬁcantly more efﬁcient
than the attacks using the FBS.
Our contribution are summarized as follows:
Finally, two potential countermeasures against the SigOver
attack are discussed in Section 6: (1) digital signature based
solution and (2) channel estimation based detection. More-
over, a practical and robust solution to the SigOver attack is
left as a future work.
• First signal overshadowing attack on LTE: To the best
of our knowledge, the SigOver attack is the ﬁrst realization
of a signal overshadowing attack on LTE broadcast signals.
• Implementation and evaluation: We demonstrate the
practicality and stealthiness of the SigOver attack via ex-
tensive real world experiments with high attack success
rate.
• Novel attack scenarios and implications: We present
novel attack scenarios and analyze their implications in
detail based on the experiments.
• Countermeasures: We investigate prevention and detec-
tion strategies against the SigOver attack, e.g., the digitally
signing on broadcast signals for prevention, and leveraging
the changing nature of the physical signal for detection.

operators.

Figure 1: LTE network architecture
An LTE network consists of a UE, eNB, and Evolved Packet
Core (EPC) components as illustrated in Figure 1.
A UE is an end device that provides various LTE services
(i.e., voice and data services) to a subscribed user. It includes
a smart card referred to as the Universal Subscriber Identity
Module (USIM), which stores a permanent identity (Inter-
national Mobile Subscriber Identity, IMSI) or a temporary
identity (Globally Unique Temporary Identity, GUTI) for user
identiﬁcation, and a cryptographic key for encryption and
integrity protection.
An eNB is an LTE base station, which provides a wireless
connections for UEs to receive services enabled at the LTE
network. A single eNB covers multiple sites (referred to as
cells in LTE), which are identiﬁed by a Physical layer Cell
Identity (PCI).
An EPC network is responsible for control functions such
as authentication, mobility and session management, and user
plane services. For mobility management, a Mobility Man-
agement Entity (MME) in the EPC network manages a set of
Tracking Areas (TAs), each of which contains several eNBs.

Each frame has a duration of 10ms and comprises 10 sub-
frames, each of which has a duration of 1ms. A single sub-
frame is further divided into two slots of equal duration and
each slot comprises seven Orthogonal Frequency Division
Multiplexing (OFDM) symbols.
Downlink Scheduling. In LTE, radio resources are allocated
in the unit of the Physical Resource Block (PRB) [2] that
contains 12 subcarriers (each with a bandwidth of 15 KHz)
and consumes one slot in time (0.5ms). The number of avail-
able PRBs in a frequency band is determined by the system
bandwidth. Depending on the size of the data, an eNB allo-
cates PRBs within a subframe (1ms), which is the smallest
scheduling time interval.
Channel estimation. When a signal travels through a wire-
less channel, the signal gets distorted due to several factors,
e.g., attenuation, phase-shift, and noise. To accommodate
those factors, wireless devices estimate the channel using
the following equation: Y (k) = H(k)X(k), where Y (k), H(k)
and X(k) represent a signal received by a UE, the channel
coefﬁcient, and the signal transmitted by an eNB, respectively.
In LTE, a UE performs channel estimation based on the Refer-
ence Signal (RS) transmitted by the eNB. The UE calculates
H(k) from H(k) = Y (k)
X(k) as it already knows X(k) and Y (k)
value of RS. To minimize the effects of noise in the chan-
nel estimation, H(k) of RS is averaged using an averaging
window.
Cell search. When a UE is turned on, it has to ﬁnd a suitable
cell to establish radio connections. To this end, it ﬁrst attempts
to measure the Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) of
the candidate frequency channels. The UE selects the channel
with the highest RSSI based on the measurement. Thereafter,
the UE obtains time synchronization on a subframe basis and
the PCI of the cell by listening to a Primary Synchronization
Signal (PSS) and a Secondary Synchronization Signal (SSS).
The UE then decodes the Master Information Block (MIB) to
acquire the System Frame Number (SFN) and other physical
channels.
System information acquisition. After completing the cell
search procedure, the UE decodes a Physical Control For-
mat Indicator CHannel (PCFICH) and a Physical Downlink
Control CHannel (PDCCH) to decode downlink data. The
UE knows the number of OFDM symbols used to carry the
PDCCH at each subframe through the PCFICH. The UE then
decodes the PDCCH that contain the information on the re-
source blocks that the data and the demodulation scheme
required by the UE. After decoding the two channels, the UE
decodes the other system information broadcasted through a
Physical Downlink Shared CHannel (PDSCH). There are 22
System Information Blocks (SIBs), each of which contains
different cell-related system information [3]. Among them,
SIB1 and SIB2 are essential for a UE to connect to a cell. The
availability of other SIBs is indicated in SIB1.
Random access. A UE performs a Random Access CHannel
(RACH) procedure to establish a radio connection with the
eNB. To this end, the UE randomly chooses a Random Access
(RA) preamble sequence and transmits it to the eNB. Unless
the same preamble sequence is simultaneously transmitted
from a different UE, the UE successfully completes the RA
procedure.
2.3 Mobility Management
Radio Resource Control (RRC). When all the steps above
have been completed, the UE carries out a connection estab-
lishment procedure with the eNB (called RRC connection
establishment procedure). Upon the completion of the proce-
dure, the UE enters the RRC Connected state in which it can
communicate with the eNB. When there are no incoming and
outgoing data for a certain time period, the radio connection
between the UE and eNB is released, and the UE enters the
RRC Idle state, to reduce battery consumption.
Non-Access Stratum (NAS). NAS is a network layer pro-
tocol between the UE and MME for mobility and session
management. To register with the LTE network, the UE car-
ries out an ATTACH procedure. After the UE is successfully
registered with the LTE network, the MME knows the TA to
which the UE belongs and provides the UE of a list of TA
identiﬁers (TAIs). This TAI list is used by the UE to report its
location to the MME.
Idle state behavior. In the RRC Idle state, the UE periodi-
cally wakes up to read paging messages and SIB 1. When
there is incoming message to the UE, the MME that tracks
the UE sends a paging to all eNBs in the entire TAs assigned
to the UE, and those eNBs broadcast a paging message to
inform the UE of the arrival message. The paging message
contains either the temporary or permanent identity of the
UE. If the UE receives the paging message, it sends a RRC
connection request and a Service request message to the
LTE network. Paging is also used to notify the system in-
formation change or provide emergency alerts such as the
Earthquake and Tsunami Warning System (ETWS) and Com-
mercial Mobile Alert System (CMAS). The UE also reads the
SIB1 to identify the current TA. If the UE enters into a new
TA that is not in the TAI list, the UE sends a Tracking Area
Update (TAU) request to the MME to report its location. In
addition, the UE periodically measures the power and qual-
ity of the serving cell and neighboring cells by calculating
the Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) and Reference
Signal Received Quality (RSRQ). When the RSRP of a neigh-
boring cell is higher than that of the serving cell by a certain
threshold, the UE selects new cell and camps on it (i.e., cell
re-selection).
2.4 Establishing Security Context
When a UE establishes a wireless connection with an eNB,
it registers with the LTE network to achieve a full connec-
tion with the network (this behavior is called ATTACH) by
providing its permanent identity, IMSI. Then, the MME and
the UE mutually authenticate each other and carry out a key
