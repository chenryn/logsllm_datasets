ABSTRACT 
In  this  workshop,  we  focus  on  physical  attacks  and  their 
countermeasures. With the advent of the Internet of Things, the 
interest in embedded cryptographic systems and physical attacks 
on  these  systems  is  steadily  increasing,  both  in  academia  and 
industry.  Sophisticated  security  certification  and  evaluation 
methods  have  been  established  to  give  assurance  about  the 
security  claims  by  independent  evaluation  and  testing.  The 
certification  has  a  drawback  that  it  is  time  consuming  and 
expensive.  There  is  a  need  for  further  developing  provably 
secure protection methods and automated verification tools, but 
also  improving  the  efficiency  and  quality  of  certification  by 
integrating  these  tools  and  methods.  All  these  challenges 
motivate 
the  Theory  of 
Implementation Security.

BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION 
The more important information and communication technology 
becomes  in  our  professional  and  private  lives,  the  more 
important it is that this technology is trustworthy. Cryptography 
forms an essential building block for solutions that offer security 
and  privacy.  The  traditional  application  of  cryptography  is  the 
protection of communication lines. In this scenario it is assumed 
that both sender and receiver have equipment that is protected

by  physical  means  and  hence  are  not  subject  to  attacks.  Given 
this  assumption, 
there  exists  various  well  defined  and 
standardized  algorithms  and  protocols  that  can  be  used  today. 
However,  in  modern  applications  like  payment  cards,  set-top 
boxes,  IoT  devices,  etc.,  this  assumption  is  no  longer  true.  The 
attacker often has physical access to the device that is executing 
the  cryptographic  algorithm,  and  can  measure  side  channels 
(execution  time  [1],  power  consumption  [2],  electro-magnetic 
(EM)  radiation  [3])  or  perform  fault  attacks  (glitching  [4],  laser 
injection  [5],  electro-magnetic  perturbation  [6]).  With  the 
deployment  of  the  Internet  of  Things,  the  interest  in  physical 
attacks  on  embedded  systems  and  the  implementation  security 
of  these  systems  is  steadily  increasing,  both  in  academia  and 
industry. 
On  the  other  hand,  sophisticated  security  certification  and 
evaluation methods (FIPS, CC, etc.) have been established to give 
assurance  about  the  security  claims  by  independent  evaluation 
and  testing.  The  drawback 
is  time 
consuming,  expensive  and  sometimes  the  results  are  not 
repeatable. There is an emerging need from one side for further 
developing  provably  secure  protection  methods  and  automated 
verification tools and from another side improving the efficiency 
and  quality  of  certification  by  integrating  these  tools  and 
methods  which  will  allow  assessment  of  the  physical  attacks’ 
resilience  of  the  implementations  with  low  cost  and  reduced 
time.  
All these challenges motivate even more research on the Theory 
of  Implementation  Security.  This  is  also  reflected  in  the 
landscape  of  the  presented  papers  at  the  latest  ACM  CCS 
editions.  Each  of  them  in  the  last  5  years  contains  at  least  one

SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES 
In  this  workshop,  we  focus  on  physical  attacks  and  their 
countermeasures. Considering the limitations of an IoT device, 
we emphasize on efficiency and applicability as well as tools for 
sophisticated security certification and evaluation methods. The 
workshop topics include: 
Physical attacks and countermeasures 
Secure and efficient implementations of cryptographic 
algorithms 
  Designs of cryptographic algorithms with physical 
attack resistance 
  Verification and evaluation tools
