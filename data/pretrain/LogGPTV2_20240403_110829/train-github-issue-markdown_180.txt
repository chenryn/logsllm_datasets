    * Or, I already hit the "watch" button in this repository to receive notifications and I commit to help at least 2 people that ask questions in the future.

### Example
Now:
    from fastapi import FastAPI
    from typing import Dict, List
    app = FastAPI()
    @app.get("/", response_model=Dict[str, List[str]])
    def read_root():
        return {"Hello": ["tom", "hesus"]}
### The solution you would like
I want to do it through typehints:
    from fastapi import FastAPI
    from typing import Dict, List
    app = FastAPI()
    @app.get("/")
    def read_root() -> Dict[str, List[str]]:
        return {"Hello": ["tom", "hesus"]}
