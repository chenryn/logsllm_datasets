### 3. Survey Study Results

#### 3.1 Location-Shift Estimates

**Table 3: Location-Shift Estimates from the Survey Study**

|   | Interception Capability | Metadata Capability |
|---|------------------------|---------------------|
| **Long** | -0.67 | 0.00* |
| **Control** | -1.00 | -1.00 |
| **Medium** | m1, m2 | -1.00 |
| **Short** | s.meta, s.endpt, s.mech, s.risk, s.conf | -1.00 |

- **(a) Interception Capability Location-Shift Estimates:**
  - The table shows the change in participants' responses from the message in the row to the message in the column.
  - Significant cells (p ≤ 0.002) are indicated with an asterisk (*), and p ≤ 0.001 otherwise.
  - Darker colors indicate stronger effects: red/orange means the message performs worse than "Long," and blue/green means it performs better than "Control."

- **(b) Metadata Capability Location-Shift Estimates:**
  - Similar to (a), but for metadata capability.

**Key Findings:**
- No messages performed significantly better than "Long" or worse than "Control."
- Messages about non-end-to-end (not-e2e) encryption showed ceiling effects, as participants already had accurate mental models, leaving little room for improvement (e.g., Government, not-e2e encryption).

#### 3.2 Short Messages Convey Specific Points

- **Better than Control but Not Long:**
  - Short messages (s.conf and s.mech) that provide a brief overview of end-to-end (e2e) encryption performed significantly better than control but not as well as the "Long" version for interception capability.
  - This effect was observed for Employee, ISP, and Government adversaries.

- **Better for Specific Targets:**
  - Short messages targeting specific adversaries or capabilities (e.g., s.meta for metadata weakness) showed more improvement compared to Control, particularly for the targeted questions.

#### 3.3 Medium Messages: Similar to Long

- **Comparison to Long and Control:**
  - Medium messages were only compared to "Long" and "Control" if the corresponding Long vs. Control comparisons were significant.
  - Medium messages generally performed similarly to "Long" in terms of significance and effect size, especially for Employee, ISP, Government, and Malware adversaries, as well as the ISP-metadata pair.

- **Specific Examples:**
  - The Medium version that doesn't reference endpoint adversaries (m2) performed poorly with the malware adversary.

#### 3.4 Avoiding Overselling e2e Encryption

- **Goal:**
  - An important goal is to avoid causing participants to believe that e2e encryption provides more security than it actually does.
  - No significant results were found, but some weak trends suggested that short messages (s.conf, s.mech) might increase participants' belief that e2e encryption can protect metadata from app-company employees, ISPs, and the government.

### 4. Summary of Survey Study Results

- **Overall Findings:**
  - "Long" messages worked better than "Control," primarily for conveying information about interception capabilities.
  - "Medium" messages performed similarly to "Long."
  - "Short" messages worked reasonably well for relevant topics but did not improve much on metadata weaknesses and disadvantages of non-e2e systems, as participants already had strong mental models for these topics.

- **Implications:**
  - These results suggest that integrating educational messages into app workflows may help improve users' mental models.
  - A follow-up study was designed to test these messages in a more realistic context, including all "Short" messages from the survey study.

### 5. App Study: Methods

#### 5.1 The TextLight App

- **App Description:**
  - Participants used a modified and rebranded version of the Signal messaging app called TextLight for approximately three weeks.
  - Half of the participants (n=32) used an experimental version with Short and Long messages, while the other half (n=29) used a control version with no messages.

- **Educational Messages:**
  - Short messages from the survey study were incorporated, with minor modifications to mention e2e encryption in general and reduce habituation.
  - UI elements considered for message delivery included splash screen, profile setup, in-conversation, and conversation-list (Figure 2).

- **Message Display Logic:**
  - Messages were shown periodically to ensure users saw all messages without being annoyed.
  - Frequency rules were determined during piloting, aiming for approximately 0.75 messages per participant per day.

- **Other App Modifications:**
  - Unnecessary features were disabled to minimize privacy risks and simplify the installation process.
  - The app was instrumented to measure user interactions and store logs under participant pseudonyms.

#### 5.2 Study Structure

- **Pre-Screener and Recruitment:**
  - Participants were recruited from Proliﬁc and pre-screened to exclude those with too much e2e encryption knowledge.
  - Criteria included U.S. residency, Android 6.0 or above, no prior use of Signal, and willingness to participate in a remote interview.

- **Initial Questionnaire:**
  - Participants provided consent and completed a pre-intervention questionnaire, which introduced TextLight and asked a modified version of the communications privacy questionnaire.

- **Installation and Tutorial:**
  - Participants were guided through the installation and use of TextLight via a tutorial.
  - Installation was streamlined, and participants were provided with a phone number controlled by the research team to minimize personal information collection.

- **Daily Use and Follow-Up:**
  - Participants used TextLight for three weeks, with daily interactions and follow-up interviews for experimental participants.

This structured and detailed approach ensures that the text is clear, coherent, and professional, providing a comprehensive overview of the survey and app studies.
