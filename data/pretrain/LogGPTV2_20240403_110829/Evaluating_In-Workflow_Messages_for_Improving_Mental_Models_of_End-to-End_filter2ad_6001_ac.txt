had accurate mental models for these questions, leaving little
room to observe improvement. One example (Government,
not-e2e encryption) is shown in Figure 1, bottom.
4.2.3 Short messages can convey a speciﬁc point
Short messages generally work better than control, particu-
larly (as expected) for adversary-capability pairs they directly
target. As a reminder, we compare Short messages to Long
and Control messages only if the omnibus test comparing all
message versions is signiﬁcant and Long (our best explanation
attempt) signiﬁcantly diﬀers from control.
Better than control but not Long
Short versions that
aim to give a brief overview of e2e encryption (s.conf and
s.mech) perform signiﬁcantly better than control but not as
well as long for the interception capability (see eﬀect sizes
in Table 3a). We see this eﬀect for the Employee, ISP, and
Government adversaries.
Better than other messages for speciﬁc targets We also
ﬁnd that short messages targeting a speciﬁc adversary or ca-
pability tend to perform well on those questions. For instance,
the Short message that targets metadata weakness (s.meta)
oﬀers more improvement compared to Control (in terms of

with the malware adversary.
4.2.5 Some messages may oversell e2e encryption
An important goal of our educational intervention is to avoid
causing participants to believe that e2e encryption provides
more security than it actually does. We found no signiﬁcant
results to this eﬀect, but we do see some weak trends in the
wrong direction. For example, Short messages that give an
overview of e2e encryption but don’t mention its weaknesses
(s.conf, s.mech) show trends where participants may increase
their belief that e2e encryption can protect metadata from
app-company employees, the ISP, and the government. These
trends can be seen in the extended paper (see Appendix D).
4.3 Summary of survey study results
Overall, we ﬁnd that Long works better than Control, primar-
ily for conveying information about the interception capability.
Medium messages perform similarly to Long, and Short mes-
sages work reasonably well for relevant topics. We do not,
however, see much improvement related to metadata weak-
nesses and the disadvantages of systems that do not use e2e
encryption, primarily because participants seem to already
have reasonably strong mental models for these topics.
Overall, these results suggest optimism that integrating ed-
ucational messages into app workﬂows may help to improve
users’ mental models. We therefore decided to conduct a sec-
ond, more realistic, study to test these messages in context.
We opted to include all Short messages from the survey
study in the follow-up. We hoped that including all messages
would provide a reasonably complete view of e2e encryption
and avoid overselling. Further, we hoped that including mes-
sages where many participants already had a correct mental
model would reinforce when an existing model is correct.
5 App Study: Methods
Having found that the educational messages used in the sur-
vey study were reasonably useful in a controlled setting, we
next designed a longitudinal app study to gauge their impact
in a more realistic environment. Our participants (n=61) used
a modiﬁed and rebranded version of the Signal messaging
app 7 for Android (again called TextLight) for approximately
three weeks. Half of the participants (n=32) used an experi-
mental version of TextLight incorporating our Short and Long
messages, while the other half (n=29) used a control version
with no messages. We measure changes in mental models by
comparing responses to a pre- and post-study communica-
tions privacy questionnaire similar to that used in the survey
study. Participants in the experimental condition were invited
to a post-study interview to provide more in-depth insight.

warns against endpoint adversaries (s.endpt) is more eﬀective
(in terms of eﬀect size compared to Control) than any other
message for the Malware interception capability.
4.2.4 Medium: Better than Control, similar to Long
As with Short, Mediums were only compared to Long and
Control if the corresponding Long vs. Control comparisons
were signiﬁcant. Mediums are generally similar to Long both
in which results are signiﬁcant and in eﬀect size. For the
interception capability of Employee, ISP, Government, and
Malware adversaries, as well as the ISP-metadata pair, at least
one Medium is signiﬁcantly better than Control, with similar
eﬀect sizes to Long. As expected, the Medium version that

5.1 The TextLight App
Our participants interacted with TextLight, a modiﬁed version
of the Signal Android client, branched from version 4.48.14
on October 8, 2019. We developed two versions of TextLight:
an experimental condition that incorporated a variety of edu-
cational messages drawn from the survey study, and a control
condition that contained no such messages8. By comparing
these two versions, we can distinguish changes in mental mod-
els related to our educational intervention from any generic
eﬀects of using an app described as being e2e encrypted and
answering encryption-related questions in our pre- and post-
study questionnaires.
Educational messages
As the Short messages were ef-
fective in the survey study, we decided to mainly incorporate
Short messages into TextLight. We hypothesized that multiple
Short messages could convey a broad overview of concepts
without overwhelming the user with lengthy messages.
We made only minor modiﬁcations to the ﬁve Short mes-
sages from the survey study. We mentioned e2e encryption in
general rather than TextLight speciﬁcally, and we reworded
some messages slightly to diﬀerentiate them from each other
and hopefully reduce habituation (see Appendix B).
For consistency with Signal’s design language, we consid-
ered four existing UI elements that normally convey status
information (e.g, a missed call) or prompt for action (e.g.,
to make the app the default messenger). These included a
full-screen modal that appears on occasion when the app
is opened(splash screen, Figure 2a); a message that appears
when a user sets up their account (proﬁle, Figure 2b); a grayed-

tecture changed, causing TextLight to no longer work. As a result, the app

committee
out message that occasionally appears within a conversation
thread and scrolls up as new messages are exchanged (in-
conversation, Figure 2c); and a banner on top of the list of
conversations (conversation-list, Figure 2d).
In addition, we made the Long message available as a full-
page, scrollable message that could be accessed through the
settings page of TextLight, by clicking on the conversation-
list or in-conversation elements, or by selecting the “learn
more” option from the splash-screen element. We refer to this
as the long element (Figure 2e).
Our pilot participants reported being annoyed by the splash-
screen element (several considered it a glitch); we therefore
removed it before we launched the study.
Message display logic We set TextLight to show our
short messages periodically, aiming to ensure users would see
all messages while keeping low enough frequency to avoid
annoyance. Messages are shown round-robin, in the following
order: s.conf, s.mech, s.risk, s.meta, s.endpt.
The proﬁle element is shown when the user opens
the proﬁle-setup or username-settings screens. An in-
conversation message is shown each time the user initiates
a conversation with a new recipient. This is similar to What-
sApp’s current short notiﬁcation that a new conversation is
e2e encrypted. Messages are also shown probabilistically
each time the user starts a new session with the app, based on
the ﬁrst screen visited. If the user starts on the list of conversa-
tions, they have a 20% chance of seeing the conversation-list
message element; if they start within a conversation, they have
a 20% chance of seeing an in-conversation message element.
We constrained message frequency to ensure at least 8 hours
between probabilistic messages but require a message if more
than 43 hours have passed.
454    30th USENIX Security Symposium
USENIX Association
Conversation-list messages persist until they are dismissed,
but no more than one is displayed at a time. To ensure mes-
sage rotation, we automatically dismiss any conversation-list
message that has persisted for more than 10 hours, allowing a
new message to (probabilistically) take its place.
We determined these frequency rules during piloting; based
on pilot behavior, we expected approximately 0.75 messages
per participant per day.
Other app modiﬁcations We made other minor changes
from Signal to TextLight, including limiting unneeded fea-
tures, instrumenting the app to measure our participants’ in-
teraction with it, streamlining the installation process for par-
ticipants, and rebranding. We modiﬁed only the client app
and used Signal’s server-side infrastructure as is.
TextLight is designed only for use with our study, as our
instrumentation is not compatible with the privacy goals of
e2e encryption. To this end, we conﬁgured it to only work
within our study setup, and we clearly marked it in the Google
Play store as for a research study only.
We disabled unnecessary features that could create privacy
risks for our participants or require connection to external ser-
vices, including options to share Signal with friends, connect
to a desktop client, use SMS, and any features that access the
participant’s local contacts or pre-existing text messages. We
kept microphone, camera, and local storage permissions in
case participants opted to share media messages.
We instrumented the app to measure how much time users
spent on which pages, which UI elements they interacted with,
and when they sent messages. We stored logs on our server,
under participant pseudonyms we generated.
We also streamlined Signal’s standard registration process
for participants. After installing the app, participants only
needed to enter a phone number (provided by us); we auto-
mated other veriﬁcation and registration steps.
5.2 Study structure
The six stages our participants completed are detailed below9.
Pre-screener and recruitment We again recruited from
Proliﬁc. This time, we pre-screened participants to rule out
those with too much e2e encryption knowledge up front,
rather than removing their responses after the fact. The study
was advertised as “Messaging App Study” to avoid potential
privacy-related selection bias. We invited participants to the
study if:
• They resided in the U.S.;
• They had an Android 6.0 or above phone, in order to eﬀec-
tively use our TextLight app;
• They had never used Signal and would therefore not be
biased by prior perceptions;
9Survey and interview protocols are given in the extended paper (see
Appendix D)
• They were e2e encryption novices: They disagreed or
strongly disagreed that they could“describe what symmet-
ric key encryption is,” “describe what End-to-End Encryp-
tion is”, and “describe a scenario where Diﬃe-Hellman key
exchange is used.” Since we expected the change in mental
models to be more subtle than the survey study (due to the
more realistic scenario), we selected for slightly less e2e
encryption knowledge than previously; and
• They were willing to participate in a remote interview:
Although only experimental participants were invited to
interview, to avoid selection bias all participants were re-
quired to express willingness to interview.
Further, we collected IT background, gender, age, and ed-
ucation to ensure our sample was reasonably well balanced.
We invited qualiﬁed participants to the main study (randomly
assigned to either the control or experimental conditions).
Initial questionnaire
Participants who were invited to
the main study were ﬁrst asked to consent to the entire study,
then given a pre-intervention questionnaire. The question-
naire introduced TextLight and assured participants that the
app was e2e encrypted. Next, we asked a slightly modiﬁed ver-
sion of the communications privacy questionnaire described
in Section 3.1. The main modiﬁcation, based on piloting (Sec-
tion 5.2), was to organize all not-e2e encryption questions
together rather than distributing them among adversaries, to
avoid confusion. We further distinguished these questions by
tying them to a ﬁctional non-e2e encrypted app we named
MessageBright, to avoid any misinterpretation about Text-
Light. In addition, to reduce stress and discomfort, we remind
users that there are no right or wrong answers.
Installation and tutorial
Participants next viewed a tuto-
rial on how to install and use TextLight. Because participants
were recruited remotely and asynchronously, we aimed to
make installation as seamless as possible.
Participants were instructed to install TextLight through the
Google Play Store via a provided link. To minimize personal
information collected, participants were provided a phone
number controlled by the research team10 to use for registra-
tion. We automated portions of Signal’s registration conﬁrma-
tion process to minimize participant eﬀort. Participants were
shown an animation depicting a correct registration outcome.
Finally, via another animation, participants were instructed
to start a new text-message conversation with a provided
phone number. These numbers were operated by researchers;
however, participants were not explicitly told who the num-
bers belonged to. To reduce bias, researchers did not know
condition assignments; however, a few participants referenced
educational messages unprompted during the daily conversa-
tions, and researchers learned three participants’ conditions
during tech support.
10We obtained the numbers from Twilio.com, which also provides an API.
