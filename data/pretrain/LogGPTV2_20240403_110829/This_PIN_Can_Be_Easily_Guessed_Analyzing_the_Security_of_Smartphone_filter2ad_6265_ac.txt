Due to the short, online nature of our study, we are limited in
what we can conclude about the memorability of the PINs. The
entirety of the study is only around 5 minutes, while mobile
authentication PINs are used for indeﬁnite periods, and likely
carried from one device to the next. There are clear differences
in these cases, and while we report on the recall rates within
the context of the study, these results do not generalize.
Finally, we limited the warning messaging used when
a blacklist event occurred. We made this choice based on
evaluating the messaging as used by iOS, but there is a long
line of research in appropriate security messaging [38], [1],
[15], [18]. We do not wish to make claims about the quality
of this messaging, and a limitation of this study (and an area of
future work) is to understand how messaging affects changing
strategies and click-through rates.
V. PIN SELECTION ON SMARTPHONES
In the following section, we discuss the security of both 4-
and 6-digit PINs. Unless otherwise stated, our analyzed dataset
consists of the PINs entered before any blacklist warning in
Step (5) of the study. These so-called “ﬁrst choice” PINs (cf.
Table VI) are unaffected by the blacklists.
A. Strength of 4- and 6-digit PINs
a) Entropy-Based Strength Metrics: We analyzed PINs
in terms of their mathematical metrics for guessing resistance
based on entropy estimations. For this, we consider a perfect
knowledge attacker who always guesses correctly (in perfect
order) as described by Bonneau et al. [10]. The advantage of
such an entropy estimation approach is that it always models a
best-case attacker and does not introduce bias from a speciﬁc
guessing approach. Our results are given in Table V.
We report the β-success-rate, which measures the expected
guessing success for a throttled adversary limited to β-guesses
per account (e.g., λ3 = 3 guesses). Moreover, we provide the
Min-entropy H∞ as a lower bound estimate that solely relies
on the frequency of the most common PIN (1234, 123456).
Finally, we present the partial guessing entropy (α-guesswork)
Gα, which provides an estimate for an unthrottled attacker
trying to guess a fraction α of all PINs in the dataset. In three
cases, the calculation of (cid:101)G0.2 is based on PINs occurring only
once, due to the small size of the datasets. This constraint
would result in inaccurate guessing-entropy values which is
why they are not reported.
For a fair comparison among the datasets which all differ
in size, we downsampled First-4, Amit-4, Rock-4, and Rock-
6 to the size of the smallest dataset First-6 (369 PINs) in
our calculations. We repeated this process 500 times, removed
outliers using Tukey fences with k = 1.5. In Table V we report
the median values.

Overall,
the PINs we collected, speciﬁcally primed for
mobile authentication, have different (and stronger) strength
estimations than PINs derived from leaked text-based pass-
word datasets studied in the previous work. This is true for
both the 4- and 6-digit PINs, which supports our motivation
for conducting studies that collect PINs directly.
b) Guess Number-Driven Strength Estimates: Next, we
estimate the security of the PINs in regard to real-world
guessing attacks. For this, we consider an attacker as described
in Section III-A. Our attacker guesses PINs in decreasing
probability order based on the Amit-4, Rock-4, and Rock-6
datasets. When two or more PINs share the same frequency,
i.e., it is not possible to directly determine a guessing order,
Golla et al. [16] suggests ordering those PINs using a Markov
model. We trained our model on the bi-grams (4-digit PINs)
or tri-grams (6-digit PINs) of the respective attacking datasets
which simulates the attacker with the highest success rate for
each case without overﬁtting the problem.
An overview of our guessing analysis can be found in
Figure 6. In the throttled scenario, depicted in Figure 6(a), we
ﬁnd attacking 4-digit PINs with the Amitay-4-digit dataset ((cid:52))
is more effective than using RockYou-4-digit ((cid:53)). We simu-
late the stronger attacker by utilizing the Amitay dataset in
subsequent strength estimations of 4-digit PINs.
When comparing 4- ((cid:52)) and 6-digit PINs (×), we see that
guessing performance varies. For 10 guesses (the maximum
allowed under iOS), we ﬁnd 4.6 % of the 4-digit and 6.5 % of
the 6-digit PINs are guessed. For 30 guesses (a less determined
attacker on Android), 7.6 % of the 4-digit and 8.9 % of the 6-
digit PINs are guessed and for 100 guesses (a reasonable upper
bound on Android), 16.2 % of the 4-digit and 13.3 % of the
6-digit PINs.
Somewhat counter-intuitive is the weaker security for 6-digit
PINs for the ﬁrst 40 guesses. Upon investigation, the most-
common 6-digit PINs are more narrowly distributed than their
most-common 4-digit counterparts. The most common 6-digit
PINs consist of simple PINs, such as 123456 as deﬁned in
Table XII in Appendix E, and repeating digits. In contrast, the
most common 4-digit PINs consist of simple PINs, patterns,
dates, and repeating digits. As a result, the most common 6-
digit PINs may actually be easier to guess and less diverse
than the most common 4-digit PINs.

There could be many explanations for this counter-intuitive
ﬁnding. One explanation may be that users have more 4-digit
PIN sequences to draw on in choosing a PIN, such as dates,
but have fewer natural 6-digit analogs, and thus revert to less
diverse, more easily guessed choices. Another explanation may
be that users have a false sense of security that comes with
6-digit PINs as they are “two digits more secure” than 4-digit
PINs. Thus, users do not feel that they need more complexity
in their 6-digit PIN choices. Either way, future research is
needed to better understand this phenomenon, which has also
been observed by Aviv et al. [6] in the context of increasing
the size (4x4 vs. 3x3) of Android graphical unlock patterns.
Finally, we compare guessing resistance with other mobile
authentication schemes including Android’s graphical unlock
patterns drawn on a 3x3 grid ((cid:3)) and alphanumeric passwords
((cid:70)), along with a uniform distribution of 3-digit PINs (–).
In theory, a 3x3 grid allows 389 112 unique patterns, yet,
the distribution of patterns is highly skewed [39]. When
considering an attack throttled to 100 guesses, 35.5 % of the
patterns will be guessed. Against this attack, 4- and 6-digit
PINs are twice as good. Password-based authentication, on
the other hand, is the most secure scheme. After 100 guesses
only 1.9 % of the passwords are recovered.
Figure 6(b) shows the guessing time of an attacker due to
rate limiting based on Table II for iOS and Android. iOS has
stricter rate limiting with a maximum of 10 guesses that can be
completed in 1h 36m, at which point an attacker compromises
4.6 % of the 4-digit PINs and 6.5 % of the 6-digit PINs. At
the same time limit of roughly 1.5 h, an attacker on Android
is able to compromise 13.6 % of the 4-digit PINs and 11.7 %
of the 6-digit PINs because of less restrictive rate limiting.
Especially on iOS, rate limiting becomes more aggressive
after the initial guesses. For example, the ﬁrst 6 guesses on
iOS can be done within a minute, while the ﬁrst 8 guesses
already take 21 minutes. An attacker with only one minute
on iOS is able to compromise 3.5 % of the 4-digit PINs and
6.2 % of the 6-digit PINs. But there are only marginal gains
for 10 guesses which take 1h 36m on iOS with 4.6 % of the
4-digit PINs and 6.5 % of 6-digit PINs compromised. Hence,
after the ﬁrst minute with 6 guesses on iOS, it does not greatly
beneﬁt the attacker to continue through the aggressive timeouts
for 4 more guesses at 1h 36m. In contrast, an attacker on
Android would beneﬁt more from continuing to guess beyond
the initial large increases in rate limiting. Of course, in a
targeted attack setting, there may be additional information
or other motivations for the attacker not modeled here.

the number of guesses.
(b) Guessing performance against 4- and 6-digit PINs on Android and iOS
based on the required time. For 4-digit PINs, we only show the success
rate of an attack with Amit-4 as it outperforms Rock-4 (cf. Figure 6(a)).

based on the number of guesses. The bottom ﬁgure is based on the required
time and considers the different rate limits of Android and iOS (cf. Table II).
B. Selection Strategies
In Step (6) of our study, we asked participants about their
“strategy for choosing” their PIN. We analyzed the free-text
responses to this question by building a codebook from a
random sample of 200 PIN selection strategies using two
coders. Inter-rater reliability between the coders measured by
Cohen’s kappa was κ = 0.92. The 10 most popular strategies
are shown in Appendix E in Table XII. We found no difference
in the top 5 selection strategies between 4- and 6-digit PINs.
While the set of selection strategies is diverse, we found
that many of the participants chose their PINs based on dates,
especially birthdays and anniversaries. Followed by that are
PINs that were perceived memorable by participants who
have selected something “easy to remember.” Also popular are
patterns on the PIN pad and PINs that have some meaning to
the participants like a partial ZIP code or a favorite number.
To summarize, in line with previous work from Wang et
al. [46], we found no evidence that 6-digit PINs offer any
security advantage over 4-digit PINs considering a throttled
guessing attacker, which is the relevant threat model for mobile
unlock authentication. To support this claim, we performed
χ2 tests (α = 0.05) for both the 4- and 6-digit PINs
guessed within 10 [4.6 %, 6.5 %], 30 [7.6 %, 8.9 %], and
100 guesses [16.2 %, 13.3 %]. Neither the test for 10 guesses
showed a signiﬁcant difference (p = 0.16) in PIN strength,
nor the tests for 30 (p = 0.44) or 100 guesses (p = 0.19).
