#### Limitations of the Study

Due to the brief and online nature of our study, we can only draw limited conclusions about the memorability of the PINs. The entire study duration is approximately 5 minutes, whereas mobile authentication PINs are typically used for extended periods and often carried over from one device to another. These differences are significant, and while we report recall rates within the context of the study, these results do not generalize to long-term usage.

Additionally, we restricted the warning messages displayed during blacklist events. This decision was based on the messaging used by iOS, but there is extensive research on effective security messaging [38], [1], [15], [18]. We do not make claims about the quality of the messaging, and a limitation of this study (and an area for future work) is to understand how different messaging affects user behavior and click-through rates.

### PIN Selection on Smartphones

In this section, we discuss the security of both 4- and 6-digit PINs. Unless otherwise specified, our analyzed dataset consists of the PINs entered before any blacklist warning in Step (5) of the study. These "first choice" PINs (see Table VI) are unaffected by the blacklists.

#### A. Strength of 4- and 6-Digit PINs

**a) Entropy-Based Strength Metrics:**

We analyzed PINs using mathematical metrics for guessing resistance based on entropy estimations. For this, we considered a perfect knowledge attacker who always guesses correctly, as described by Bonneau et al. [10]. The advantage of this approach is that it models a best-case attacker without introducing bias from specific guessing strategies. Our results are presented in Table V.

- **β-Success-Rate:** Measures the expected guessing success for a throttled adversary limited to β-guesses per account (e.g., λ3 = 3 guesses).
- **Min-Entropy (H∞):** Provides a lower bound estimate based on the frequency of the most common PIN (1234, 123456).
- **Partial Guessing Entropy (Gα):** Estimates the number of guesses required for an unthrottled attacker to guess a fraction α of all PINs in the dataset.

For a fair comparison among datasets of different sizes, we downsampled First-4, Amit-4, Rock-4, and Rock-6 to the size of the smallest dataset, First-6 (369 PINs). This process was repeated 500 times, and outliers were removed using Tukey fences with k = 1.5. Table V reports the median values.

The low Min-Entropy of the Rock-6 dataset is due to the over-representation of the PIN 123456, which occurs 21 times more frequently than the second-most popular PIN. In contrast, the most common 4-digit PIN occurs only 1.7 times more frequently, leading to a higher H∞ value.

**Table V: Guessing Difficulty for a Perfect-Knowledge Attacker**

| Dataset | H∞ | G0.05 | G0.1 | G0.2 | Online Guessing (Success %) | Offline Guessing (bits) |
|---------|----|-------|------|------|-----------------------------|-------------------------|
| First-4† | 6.33 | - | - | - | 3.79% | 13.28% |
| Amit-4† | 5.81 | - | - | - | 7.86% | 16.53% |
| Rock-4† | 6.60 | - | - | - | 16.80% | 21.95% |
| First-6 | 4.74 | 5.19 | 3.10 | 7.11 | 9.49% | 16.26% |
| Rock-6† | 4.94 | 5.23 | 6.57 | 3.07 | 16.29% | 26.29% |

†: Datasets downsampled to the size of First-6 (369 PINs).

Overall, the PINs collected specifically for mobile authentication show different and generally stronger strength estimations compared to PINs derived from leaked text-based password datasets in previous studies. This holds true for both 4- and 6-digit PINs, supporting our motivation for conducting direct PIN collection studies.

**b) Guess Number-Driven Strength Estimates:**

Next, we estimate the security of the PINs against real-world guessing attacks. We consider an attacker who guesses PINs in decreasing probability order based on the Amit-4, Rock-4, and Rock-6 datasets. When two or more PINs share the same frequency, we use a Markov model to order them, as suggested by Golla et al. [16].

**Figure 6: Guessing Performance Analysis**

- **Throttled Scenario (Figure 6(a)):** Attacking 4-digit PINs with the Amitay-4-digit dataset is more effective than using RockYou-4-digit. We simulate the stronger attacker by utilizing the Amitay dataset in subsequent strength estimations of 4-digit PINs.
- **Comparison of 4- and 6-Digit PINs (Figure 6(b)):** For 10 guesses (the maximum allowed under iOS), 4.6% of 4-digit and 6.5% of 6-digit PINs are guessed. For 30 guesses (a less determined attacker on Android), 7.6% of 4-digit and 8.9% of 6-digit PINs are guessed. For 100 guesses (a reasonable upper bound on Android), 16.2% of 4-digit and 13.3% of 6-digit PINs are guessed.

Interestingly, 6-digit PINs show weaker security for the first 40 guesses. This is because the most common 6-digit PINs are more narrowly distributed, consisting of simple PINs like 123456 and repeating digits. In contrast, the most common 4-digit PINs include dates, patterns, and repeating digits, making them more diverse and harder to guess.

**Possible Explanations:**
- Users may have more 4-digit sequences to choose from, such as dates, but fewer natural 6-digit analogs, leading to less diverse and easier-to-guess choices.
- Users may have a false sense of security with 6-digit PINs, believing they are inherently more secure, and thus do not feel the need to create more complex PINs.

**Comparison with Other Authentication Schemes:**
- **Android’s 3x3 Grid Patterns:** In theory, a 3x3 grid allows 389,112 unique patterns, but the distribution is highly skewed. After 100 guesses, 35.5% of the patterns are guessed. 4- and 6-digit PINs are twice as resistant.
- **Alphanumeric Passwords:** After 100 guesses, only 1.9% of passwords are recovered, making them the most secure scheme.

**Rate Limiting Impact:**
- **iOS:** Stricter rate limiting allows a maximum of 10 guesses in 1h 36m, compromising 4.6% of 4-digit and 6.5% of 6-digit PINs.
- **Android:** Less restrictive rate limiting allows 13.6% of 4-digit and 11.7% of 6-digit PINs to be compromised in 1.5 hours.

**Conclusion:**
There is no evidence that 6-digit PINs offer any security advantage over 4-digit PINs when considering a throttled guessing attacker, which is the relevant threat model for mobile unlock authentication. χ2 tests (α = 0.05) for both 4- and 6-digit PINs guessed within 10, 30, and 100 guesses did not show significant differences in PIN strength.

### B. Selection Strategies

In Step (6) of our study, participants were asked about their "strategy for choosing" their PIN. We analyzed free-text responses by building a codebook from a random sample of 200 PIN selection strategies using two coders. Inter-rater reliability measured by Cohen’s kappa was κ = 0.92. The 10 most popular strategies are shown in Appendix E in Table XII. There was no difference in the top 5 selection strategies between 4- and 6-digit PINs.

Many participants chose their PINs based on dates, especially birthdays and anniversaries. Other popular strategies included selecting something "easy to remember," patterns on the PIN pad, and PINs with personal meaning, such as partial ZIP codes or favorite numbers.

### VI. Blacklists and PIN Selection

We now present results on our 7 blacklist treatments: 5 treatments for 4-digit PINs and 2 treatments for 6-digit PINs, as shown in Table VI.
