User: I just intstalled python 3.6.0b4 (default, Nov 22 2016) amd64 on my Win 7 computer. When I try to install pywin32-220.win-amd64-py3.6 I get the error message Python version 3.6-32 required, which was not found in the registry.  
Python version 3.6-32 sounds like the 32bit version, which seems inappropriate. Perhaps I misunderstand.
I've seen posts about a similar problem installing pywin 3.5-32, but none relating to 3.6b4 or the 64 bit version.
How do I fix this?
Assistant: Simply rename
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Python\PythonCore\3.6-32
To:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Python\PythonCore\3.6
This worked for Python 3.6.1 as well.
