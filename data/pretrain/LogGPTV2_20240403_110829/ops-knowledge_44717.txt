User: I'll like to create a python flask application that can run on any platform. I've put it in a Docker container. But unless I've misunderstood something the host machine still need docker installed to launch the container. Which in turn required Vagrant and and Ubuntu VM (at least on Mac). Am I missing something? What is the correct way to use a container as a standalone application?
Assistant: In order to use a Docker container, you will always need the basics - Docker installed on a Linux OS (that supports LXC and any other required filesystem type). In a production environment, you'd be running a recent, native install of Linux, and the initial install of Docker would be easy, and a one-time event (in a cloud environment, you'd probably not upgrade a working machine, but instead spin up a new one, with the latest pre-tested Docker version, and the equally upgraded & tested new containers).
On a MacOS, or Windows development machine, you need a virtual machine to host the Linux OS. There's no way around that.
