Need and Motivation behind 3D City Modelsiirs
• A 3D city model is a representation of an urban environment with a three-
dimensional geometry of common urban objects and structures, with
buildings as the most prominent feature.
• 3D City Models may be applied in a multitude of application domains for
environmental simulation and decision support
3D Data Models iirs
3D Data Models are of 2 types:
•Geometrical Models : defines the geometric
objects and elements types. They consist of different
spatial objects (points, linestrings, etc.) with the
representation of their properties.
e.g. COLLADA, VRML, X3D, etc.
•Semantic Models : defines entities and their non-
spatial characteristics and relationships among the
entities.
e.g. CityGML, IFC, gbXML, etc.

3D Data Types iirs
Main 3D data types to used in 3D data models:
•3D objects are represented by its boundaries (B-Rep),
•3D objects are represented by voxel elements,
•3D objects are represented by a combination of the 3D basic
block (CSG).

General Taxonomy of 3D Use Case iirs
Category 3DAnalysis Application Representation
1. Applications based on Estimation of the
Geometry shadow
2. Analysis based only on Estimation of the
geometry and semantic solar potential
information
3. Analysis based on domain Noise emission
specific extension and calculation
external data
But categories are not mutually exclusive in all cases

CityGML iirs
Features:
•Opendatamodel.
•XML-basedformat.
•Used for storing and exchanging virtual 3D objects and city models among
applications.
•HasbothGeometrical&Semanticmodelofinformation.
•Implemented as an application schema for the Geography Markup
Language3(GML3).
•Supports Multi-Scale Modeling according to the details level required in
differentapplications.
