## Abstract
This paper presents the first comprehensive analysis of methodologies for launching DNS cache poisoning attacks, including manipulation at the IP layer, hijacking inter-domain routing, and probing open ports via side channels. We evaluate these methodologies against DNS resolvers in the Internet, comparing their effectiveness, applicability, and stealth. Our study reveals that DNS cache poisoning is a practical and pervasive threat.

We then demonstrate cross-layer attacks that leverage DNS cache poisoning to target popular systems, ranging from security mechanisms like RPKI to applications such as VoIP. In addition to traditional adversarial goals like impersonation and Denial of Service (DoS), we show for the first time that DNS cache poisoning can enable adversaries to bypass cryptographic defenses. Specifically, we demonstrate how DNS cache poisoning can facilitate BGP prefix hijacking of networks protected with RPKI, even when other networks apply route origin validation to filter invalid BGP announcements. Our findings highlight that DNS plays a more central role in Internet security than previously assumed. We recommend mitigations for securing applications and preventing cache poisoning.

## 1. Introduction
The Domain Name System (DNS) [RFC1034, RFC1035] [59, 60] plays a central role in the Internet. Designed and standardized in the 1980s to provide lookup services, DNS has evolved into a complex infrastructure supporting a wide variety of existing and future applications and security mechanisms. Given the Internet's heavy reliance on DNS, it has become a lucrative target for attacks.

### DNS Cache Poisoning
In a cache poisoning attack, an adversary injects malicious DNS records into the cache of a victim DNS resolver. This enables the adversary to redirect users to malicious hosts instead of the genuine servers of the target domain, intercepting all services in the target domain.

### Methodologies for Cache Poisoning
We explore the practicality of off-path DNS cache poisoning attacks and how they can be exploited to launch cross-layer attacks against applications. The methodologies we evaluate include:
1. BGP prefix hijacking
2. Transport layer side channels
3. Injections into IP defragmentation cache

These methodologies have been used in previous research for issuing fraudulent certificates [22] or for hijacking bitcoins [17]. We perform the first comparative analysis of these methodologies, evaluating their effectiveness, applicability, and stealth.

### Vulnerable Applications
We also investigate the implications of cache poisoning for various Internet services and applications. Previous research has shown evidence of cache poisoning, primarily for redirecting victims to impersonating websites [64], but there is no comprehensive study of its impact on Internet clients and services.

We evaluate the cache poisoning methodologies against a range of popular applications, categorizing them into nine groups, including security mechanisms, VoIP, email, and intermediate devices (see Table 1). Our results demonstrate that off-path DNS cache poisoning poses a realistic threat to many Internet applications, enabling downgrade attacks, DoS, and impersonation.

### Off-Path Attacks
Our study focuses on off-path attackers, who can send packets from spoofed IP addresses. This is a realistic assumption, as around 30% of Internet networks do not enforce egress filtering [19–21, 55, 56, 58]. While on-path Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attackers can launch more devastating attacks, they are rarer and have limitations. Understanding the threat posed by off-path attackers is critical.

### Ethical Considerations
Our attacks were tested ethically against remote networks. We measured and evaluated vulnerabilities in DNS caches without hijacking traffic or placing incorrect DNS records for domains not under our control. We set up a victim AS and domains, as well as adversarial AS and hosts, to carry out the attacks.

### Contributions
- We present the first comprehensive study of the attack surface introduced by off-path DNS cache poisoning.
- We implement and evaluate three methodologies for launching off-path DNS cache poisoning attacks: BGP prefix hijacking, side-channels, and fragmentation.
- We demonstrate cross-layer attacks against widely used applications and services, showing that cache poisoning can bypass security mechanisms, cause DoS, and enable impersonation.
- We provide recommendations for countermeasures against cache poisoning and cross-layer attacks.

## 2. DNS Cache Poisoning Overview
### 2.1 Defenses Against Poisoning
DNS resolvers use several defenses to make successful cache poisoning attacks difficult, including randomizing certain fields in DNS requests, such as the UDP source port and the DNS transaction identifier (TXID). Additional defenses include nameserver randomization and 0x20 encoding. However, less than 1% of second-level domains are signed with DNSSEC, and most resolvers do not validate DNSSEC signatures. Recent proposals for DNS over HTTPS and DNS over TLS may enhance resilience but do not fully protect against cache poisoning.

### 2.2 History of DNS Cache Poisoning
Klein identified vulnerabilities in Bind9 and Windows DNS resolvers in 2007, allowing off-path attackers to reduce the entropy of TXID randomization. Kaminsky presented a practical cache poisoning attack in 2008, even against truly randomized TXIDs. Subsequent research has developed new approaches for cache poisoning, including side-channel attacks and fragmentation-based attacks.

### 2.3 DNS Cache Poisoning in the Wild
There is evidence of DNS cache poisoning attempts in the wild, often launched via BGP prefix hijacks or by compromising registrars or nameservers. We focus on network attacks that manipulate protocols remotely without compromising services or networks.

## 3. Taxonomy of Poisoning Methods
We use three methodologies for poisoning DNS caches, which have been shown to be practical in previous research:
1. **BGP Prefix Hijacking**: Intercepting DNS requests by hijacking BGP prefixes.
2. **Side-Channels**: Guessing challenge values in DNS requests via side-channels.
3. **Fragmentation**: Injecting malicious fragments into IP defragmentation caches.

These methodologies are evaluated against DNS resolvers and applications, providing a comprehensive understanding of their impact and potential mitigations.
