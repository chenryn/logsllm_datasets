**Marcel StÃ¶r** opened **SPR-9722** and commented
With #9462 support for default values was added.
However, I observed that they are applied too early if you have a hierarchy or
cascade of property placeholder configurers:
  * Spring loops through the prioritized list of configurers
  * if property X is not found in the first configurer the default value is returned  
\--> the whole list should be processed first before the default value is used
* * *
**Affects:** 3.1.1
**Issue Links:**
  * #14292 `@Value` assigns the default property value (if specified) before all property locations are examined, resulting in assigning a default to a property which is defined in a properties file. ( _ **"is duplicated by"**_ )
