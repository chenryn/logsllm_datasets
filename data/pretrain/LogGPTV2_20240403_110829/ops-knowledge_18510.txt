User: How to use Python to write a simple web crawler to grab relevant information of the target website? Please provide specific code and explanation.
Assistant: The following is a simple web crawler written in Python to grab relevant information of the target website: ``` # Import the required library import requests from bs4 import BeautifulSoup # Set the URL address and request header information of the target website url = 'https://example.com/' headers = {'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.3' } # Send a request and get the content of the webpage response = requests.get(url, headers=headers) html = response.text # Parse the content of the webpage and get the target information soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser') title = soup.title .string text = soup.get_text() # Print the obtained information print('Web page title:', title) print('Web page content:', text) ``` The above code uses the requests library to send HTTP requests to get the target website The HTML code, and then use the BeautifulSoup library to parse the HTML code, obtain the title and body information of the web page, and finally print the output. Among them, you need to pay attention to setting appropriate request header information to avoid being intercepted by the website's anti-crawler mechanism.
