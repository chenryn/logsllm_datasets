The default title for my powershell tabs is so long that (a) it is cut off and
(b) the 'X' to close the tab is not displayed, for example:

# Environment
    Windows build number: Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.18362.239]
    Windows Terminal version (if applicable):  0.3.2171.0
    Any other software? no
I did edit the settings to make two changes: The point size for all fonts is
now 12 instead of 10 and CMD is the default instead of powershell.
# Steps to reproduce
Open a powershell tab in Windows Terminal
# Expected behavior
At a minimum, I would expect the tab close control to remain visible or at
least a click where the control _belongs_ should close the tab.
# Actual behavior
The long path appears to overwrite the close tab control and prevent any
clicks from reaching the close tab control.
