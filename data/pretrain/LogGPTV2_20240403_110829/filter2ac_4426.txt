**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Filter Network Traffic

To enhance network security, consider enabling DHCP Snooping and Dynamic ARP Inspection on your switches. These features help in creating mappings between IP addresses requested via DHCP and the corresponding ARP tables. By tying these values to a specific port on the switch, you can effectively block unauthorized or bogus traffic, thereby improving the overall security of your network. [5][6]
