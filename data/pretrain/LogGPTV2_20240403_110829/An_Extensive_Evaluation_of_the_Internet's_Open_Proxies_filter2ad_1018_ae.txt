behavior and far greater stability and goodput, indicating that Tor
offers a safer and more reliable form of proxied communication.
While we remain wary about the use of open proxies, some
of the risks we identify can be at least partially mitigated. Tools
such as HTTPS Everywhere [7] can help reduce the risk of traffic
manipulation by forcing end-to-end protections. The continued
rollout of certificate transparency and similar measures will also
likely reduce (but not eliminate) risk, as they thwart the certificate
manipulation attacks described above.
We emphasize, however, that where e2e integrity and authentic-
ity guarantees are not possible (e.g., for unencrypted web traffic),
the use of open proxies still carries substantial risk. Given users’
difficulty in adhering to safe browsing habits even in the absence
of proxies [17, 28, 42], we are hesitant to recommend relying on
browser-based protections to defend against malicious proxy be-
havior. Our findings suggest that the risks of using open proxies
are plentiful, and likely far outweigh their benefits.
