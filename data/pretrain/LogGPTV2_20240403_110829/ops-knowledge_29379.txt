User: I know that I can grab a blob by BlobKey, but how do I get the blobkey associated with a given filename?
In short, I want to implement "get file by filename" 
I can't seem to find any built-in functionality for this.
Assistant: Every blob you upload, creates a new version of that blob (with that filename) in the blobstore. Ofcourse you can delete the old version(s) of the blob, if you uploaded a new version. But to make sure you have the latest version of a blob (of a filename) you have to store the filename in the datastore and make a reference to the latest version. This reference holds the blob_key.
