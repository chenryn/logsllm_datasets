User: How to monitor application performance with logging and monitoring tools?
Assistant: Use logs and monitoring tools to monitor application performance in real time. The following are specific steps: 1. Define performance indicators: According to application performance requirements, define the performance indicators that should be monitored, such as request response time, request volume, traffic, error rate, etc. . 2. Integrated monitoring tools: Select monitoring tools suitable for the application, such as Prometheus, Grafana, Zabbix, etc., and integrate them into the application. 3. Record logs: add log records for important processes or code segments of the application, including start and end time, input parameters, output results, etc. 4. Analyzing logs: Use log analysis tools for data statistics and visualization to record and troubleshoot errors in system operation. 5. Continuous monitoring: Push the collected data to the monitoring tool in real time, and continuously monitor whether the performance indicators of the application are up to standard within the specified time frame. 6. Alarm and diagnosis: set a threshold alarm, and issue a warning when some performance indicators of the application reach the preset threshold, and analyze the log to locate the problem, and make targeted adjustments and repairs. 7. Continuous optimization: Continuously optimize the performance of the application through data analysis and monitoring tools.
