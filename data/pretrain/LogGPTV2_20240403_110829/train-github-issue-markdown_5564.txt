Hello everyone,
first things first â€“ thanks to all of you for devoting your valuable time to
this project! I have not found a corresponding issue for this case and I am
not sure whether it is a bug or a feature. If it is a feature, please read
this post as a suggestion for a more explicit documentation of the behavior.
**Describe the bug**  
When I specify some request (or response) transformations in the default
config and then use an empty array (or one with less transformation functions
than the default has) in a request's transformation config, some of the
default transformations are still being applied.
**To Reproduce**
    client = Axios.create({
      transformRequest: [
        deepKebabTransform,
        JSON.stringify
      ]
    })
    // ...
    // a) 
    client.put(url, data, { transformRequest: [] })
    // b)
    client.put(url, data, { transformRequest: [data => data] })
In both cases, `JSON.stringify` is still run. In case a), both functions from
the default config are applied.
**Expected behavior**  
I would expect the default config entries for `transformRequest` and
`transformResponse` (if not all array entries) to be either replaced
completely by or merged with their counterparts in a request's config.
**Environment:**
  * Axios Version 0.18.0
  * OS: OSX 10.15.2
  * Browser: tested in Chrome 79.0.3945.88, Safari 13.0.4
**Additional context**  
Regarding the `merge` function in `utils` I came to the assumption, that the
arrays would likely be treated as objects and thus their entries are
effectively overridden positionally.
