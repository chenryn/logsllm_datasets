The following looks like a bug to me as DataFrame.duplicated() gives different
results on what should be identical inputs. To me it looks like the problem is
with the datetime64 values because if you look at the output of `dates.values`
it's clear that the last 4 values are duplicates.
Please see the code below that reproduces the problem:
    In [701]: dates = date_range('2010-07-01', end='2010-08-05')
    In [702]: tst = DataFrame({'symbol': 'AAA', 'date': dates})
    In [703]: tst.tail()
    Out[703]: 
                      date symbol
    31 2010-08-01 00:00:00    AAA
    32 2010-08-02 00:00:00    AAA
    33 2010-08-03 00:00:00    AAA
    34 2010-08-04 00:00:00    AAA
    35 2010-08-05 00:00:00    AAA
    In [704]: tst.duplicated().tail()
    Out[704]: 
    31    False
    32    False
    33    False
    34    False
    35    False
    In [705]: tst.duplicated(['date', 'symbol']).tail()
    Out[705]: 
    31    False
    32     True
    33     True
    34     True
    35     True
    In [706]: dates.values
    Out[706]:

I remember reading somewhere that there are problems with datetime64 in numpy
1.6 but I don't understand what coercions are taking place behind the scenes.
Also, if someone could please explain to me why the dates in `dates.values`
above are wrong and how to avoid this, I would appreciate it.
