## Abstract
We investigate the impact of perspective taking, privacy cues, and photo valence (i.e., how the subject is portrayed) on decisions to share photos of people via social media. In an online experiment, 379 participants evaluated 98 photos under three conditions: (1) Baseline, where participants judged their likelihood of sharing each photo; (2) Perspective-taking, where participants imagined themselves as the person in the photo; and (3) Privacy, where participants considered the privacy of the person in the photo. Across all conditions, participants were less likely to share photos that portrayed people negatively. Surprisingly, participants reported a higher likelihood of sharing photos when primed to consider the privacy of the person in the photo. Frequent photo sharers and individuals with weak personal privacy preferences were more likely to share photos, regardless of the photo's valence. A follow-up study with 100 participants revealed that the Privacy condition led to a lack of concern for others' privacy. These findings suggest that developing interventions to reduce photo sharing and protect privacy is a complex, multivariate problem, where seemingly straightforward solutions can have unexpected outcomes.

## I. Introduction
The rise of digital photography and social networking platforms has led to an unprecedented rate of photo sharing on services like Flickr, Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, and WhatsApp. It is estimated that over 1.8 billion photos are posted daily on popular social media platforms. According to Wikipedia, nine of the 25 most popular tweets ever contain images, accumulating more than 14 million retweets. The number of shared photos and their viewers continues to grow, with photo-sharing services now outpacing traditional social networks.

Sharing photos online, especially through re-sharing, raises significant privacy concerns. Photos can be taken out of context, leading to "context collapse" [9]–[11], and it is challenging to predict the real audience, causing a disconnect between the "imagined audience" [12], [13] and the actual audience. Re-sharing often results in internet memes, where humorous or embarrassing photos go viral, potentially causing psychological distress and disruption in the subjects' professional and personal lives [14]–[16].

While technical mechanisms, such as untagging and review features on Facebook, offer some protection, they cannot stop re-sharing across other users' networks. Researchers have explored co-ownership of photos [17], but a DRM-like approach is unlikely to succeed due to ownership challenges. Therefore, behavioral interventions may be a viable solution to regulate photo sharing by motivating users to consider the potential harm and privacy implications of their actions.

In this work, we investigate whether perspective taking (imagining oneself as the person in the photo) or adopting a privacy perspective (considering the privacy of the person in the photo) can influence photo-sharing decisions, particularly for highly positive or negative photos. We also examine individual differences, including gender, age, and past photo-sharing behavior, hypothesizing that habitual photo sharers may be less influenced by these interventions.

## II. Background and Related Work

### A. Engaging in Perspective Taking and Photo Sharing
Perspective taking, which involves imagining oneself in another's position, has been shown to influence thoughts and behaviors, often promoting prosocial goals. By having participants take the perspective of the person in the photo, we aim to reduce photo sharing, especially of highly negative photos. Perspective taking can trigger self-awareness, making people more concerned about how others view them, leading to more socially desirable responses [20]–[22]. Additionally, perspective taking can reduce prejudice and increase sympathy [23], [24]. Imagining being the person in the photo may increase the sharing of positive photos but not negative ones, as people generally prefer positive portrayals.

### B. Adopting a Privacy Perspective and Photo Sharing
Another focus is whether considering the privacy of others can influence photo-sharing behavior. Research shows that people often exhibit collaborative behaviors to protect each other's privacy on social media [25]. In the context of "lifelogging," photo owners often show altruistic or propriety behaviors, such as turning off wearable cameras to protect others' privacy [26], [27]. This aligns with broader sociological research on privacy, where people practice "civil inattention" or "pretense awareness" to protect others' privacy in public settings [28], [29]. We explore whether increasing awareness of privacy at the moment of sharing can make norms about protecting others' privacy more salient, especially for negative photos, as sharing negative information is a greater invasion of privacy.

### C. Individual Differences in Privacy and Photo Sharing
Past research on photo sharing has shown that individual differences, such as gender and age, are important. Women are more sensitive to privacy concerns and more risk-averse, leading to greater privacy protection behaviors [30], [31], [33], [34]. They may also be less willing to share negative photos, especially when privacy concerns are salient. Age also plays a role, with individuals over 45 responding differently to privacy concerns compared to younger individuals [32]. We assess the effects of gender and age on photo sharing and investigate whether past photo-sharing habits predict future behavior. Strong habits are harder to change, so we hypothesize that our interventions may be more effective for moderate photo sharers.

### D. Controlling Dissemination and Limiting Information
Our ultimate goal is to incorporate behavioral interventions into technical solutions. Existing approaches to control photo dissemination fall into two categories: restricting viewers and limiting content. Access-control mechanisms, such as privacy settings on Facebook, allow users to limit who can view shared content [40], [41]. Other approaches include using captions and tags to infer access-control policies [42], [43] and proposing automated ways to share images based on collective privacy preferences [44], [45], [46]. Some methods also limit information in photos by restricting photographers from capturing certain objects or redacting them [47]–[52]. These approaches, combined with behavioral interventions, could provide a more comprehensive solution to privacy concerns in photo sharing.
