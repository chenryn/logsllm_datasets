Abstract—We investigate the effects of perspective taking,
privacy cues, and portrayal of photo subjects (i.e., photo valence)
on decisions to share photos of people via social media. In an
online experiment we queried 379 participants about 98 photos
(that were previously rated for photo valence) in three conditions:
(1) Baseline: participants judged their likelihood of sharing each
photo; (2) Perspective-taking: participants judged their likelihood
of sharing each photo when cued to imagine they are the person
in the photo; and (3) Privacy: participants judged their likelihood
to share after being cued to consider the privacy of the person in
the photo. While participants across conditions indicated a lower
likelihood of sharing photos that portrayed people negatively,
they – surprisingly – reported a higher likelihood of sharing
photos when primed to consider the privacy of the person in
the photo. Frequent photo sharers on real-world social media
platforms and people without strong personal privacy preferences
were especially likely to want to share photos in the experiment,
regardless of how the photo portrayed the subject. A follow-up
study with 100 participants explaining their responses revealed
that the Privacy condition led to a lack of concern with others’
privacy. These ﬁndings suggest that developing interventions for
reducing photo sharing and protecting the privacy of others is a
multivariate problem in which seemingly obvious solutions can
sometimes go awry.

I. INTRODUCTION
With the rising popularity of digital photography and online
social-networking apps and services, people are capturing
and sharing photos on social media like Flickr [1], Insta-
gram [2], Snapchat [3], Facebook [4], and Whatsapp [5]
at an unprecedented rate. By one estimate, more than 1.8
billion photos are posted to popular social-media services
each day [6]. According to Wikipedia, nine of the 25 most
popular tweets ever contain images, accumulating more than
14 million retweets [7]. Both the number of photos shared
and the number of viewers of such photos will continue to
increase as photo-sharing services are now becoming more
popular than traditional social networks [8].
Sharing photos online (and the ‘re-sharing’ of photos from
social media contacts) can lead to various privacy concerns.
A photograph’s subject matter can be taken out of context
when viewed by unintended audiences (leading to ‘context
collapse’) [9]–[11], and it is often difﬁcult to anticipate the
real audience of a photo leading to a disconnect between the
‘imagined audience’ [12], [13] and the real audience. In fact,
the rampant re-sharing of photos, with additional alterations
such as text captions and annotations, often gives rise to
popular internet ‘memes,’1 where humorous or embarrassing
photos (often at somebody else’s expense) go ‘viral’ and reach
a large audience. At worst, as in the case with internet memes,
people in the photo can be maligned or embarrassed in front
of a large population, leading to psychological distress and
disruption in their professional and personal lives [14]–[16].
There already exist technical mechanisms, on platforms like
Facebook, to limit the sharing of images people are tagged
in (e.g., by allowing people to ‘untag’ themselves, or review
images they are tagged in before their own social contacts see
the image). While such approaches can offer a ﬁrst line of
protection by at least limiting what one’s own social contacts
can see, such approaches cannot effectively stop the re-sharing
of the content across other users’ social contacts. Researchers
have also explored the concept of co-ownership of photos
[17]. However, a general ‘DRM-like’ approach (akin to how
the sharing of music can be limited through ‘digital rights
management’) is unlikely to succeed because subjects within
a photo cannot always assert ‘ownership’ over photos taken
and shared by others; they may not even be a social contact
of the person posting the photo, or even use social media to
exert such control.
Because of the technical and ownership challenges to con-
trolling photo sharing, of particular interest is whether simple
behavioral interventions may be used to help regulate photo
sharing. In essence, if users can be motivated to consider
whether the effects of their photo sharing may be harmful to
others, or may violate privacy norms, perhaps individuals may
choose not to share some photos. Thus, in the present work
we investigate whether it is possible to inﬂuence people in the
position to violate – or protect – privacy to reconsider their
sharing decisions to improve the privacy of others. Speciﬁcally,

work are individual differences in potential photo-sharers. In
addition to investigating gender and age differences, we focus
on individuals’ past photo-sharing behavior. Although this has
not been an extensive focus of past research in the photo-
sharing literature, as we discuss below, we hypothesize that
habitual photo sharing may play a potent role in individuals’
future willingness to share photos. Balancing privacy and
accessibility is a chronic problem in security, and we believe
that behavioral interventions may play an important role in
helping people sensibly choose when photo-sharing may be
harmful to others. Herein, we report three studies in which
we focus on two potential manipulations – taking others’
perspective, and considering others’ privacy – that may have
the potential to reduce problematic photo-sharing behavior.
II. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
A. Engaging in Perspective Taking and Photo Sharing
Past research has shown that perspective taking – imagining
that the self is in another’s position – can powerfully inﬂuence
how one thinks about and behaves in a situation, often in
service of prosocial goals. Thus, of interest is whether having
participants take the perspective of the person in the photo may
reduce photo sharing, and particularly the sharing of highly
negative photos (i.e., those that portray the main subject of
the photo in a negative light). Perspective taking can inﬂuence
photo sharing for two reasons. First, perspective taking can
make people self-aware, which is the psychological state of
considering the self as the object of others’ attention [18]. Self-
awareness can be triggered by a variety of situational cues,
such as mirrors, cameras, and audiences [19]. However, much
like our perspective-taking condition, even considering how
one would be viewed by others can generate self-awareness.
Importantly, becoming self-aware can cause people to care
more about how others view them, generating more socially-
desirable responses [20]–[22]. Second, perspective taking also
leads to a variety of pro-social responses, such as reduced
prejudice and increased sympathy toward others [23], [24].
Thus, for multiple reasons, engaging in perspective taking
may have beneﬁcial effects on photo sharing. By imagining
being the person in the shared photo, this may trigger both
reputational concerns and sympathy for the person in the
photo. Both of these may actually increase the sharing of very
positive photos but not highly negative photos. Because we’d
all prefer our wedding photo to be shared more than a photo
of us falling into a puddle, one would expect taking others’
perspective when sharing photos of others should cause people
to share positive photos of others more than negative photos
of others.
B. Adopting a Privacy Perspective and Photo Sharing
A second interest of this research is whether adopting a
privacy perspective – considering the privacy of others – can
also inﬂuence photo-sharing behavior. Indeed, people often
show concern about others’ privacy. For example, Jia and Xu
have observed collaborative behaviors of people on social me-
dia, and found a tendency to collectively protect each other’s
the other). For example,
privacy [25]. Recent work in the context of ‘lifelogging’
has shown that owners of a photo can be altruistic or show
“propriety” behaviors in terms of protecting the privacy of
other people. When asked about their decisions to not share
certain photos or why they turned their wearable cameras off,
participants indicated privacy concerns for the people in the
photo as one of the top three reasons to not share a photo (other
than objects and the location depicted in the photo) [26], [27].
These ﬁndings in the domain of photo sharing map closely
onto broader work on the ‘Sociology of Privacy,’ as discussed
by Anthony et al. [28]: across a variety of contexts, people
often exhibit ‘civil inattention’ or what Goffman calls ‘tactful
inattention’ [29] (i.e., purposely ignoring available information
about others) and ‘pretense awareness’ (i.e., pretending not
to know information about
taxi
drivers often pretend to not hear private conversations of
their passengers (i.e., civil/tactful inattention), or one may ask
questions of a new colleague, such as their dissertation topic,
even though one has already closely read their application
materials (i.e., pretense awareness). These behaviors highlight
how people in society are willing to protect the privacy of
others in public settings for the sake of propriety. Yet, thus
far technical mechanisms that seek to leverage this sense of
‘propriety’ have not been adequately explored in the context
of photo sharing. Thus, of interest was whether increasing
awareness of privacy concerns at the moment of the photo-
sharing judgment may make norms about protecting others’
privacy more salient. Here again, any potential effects of a
privacy-perspective intervention might also be qualiﬁed by the
valence (i.e., the degree to which photos paint the subject in
a ‘positive’ or ‘negative’ light) of the to-be-shared photos. If
participants were made sensitive to the privacy of others, it is
plausible that this would be especially true for more negative
photos. Indeed, sharing negative information about others is a
greater invasion of privacy than sharing positive information.
C. Individual Differences in Privacy and Photo Sharing
Although past research on photo sharing has been relatively
limited, a number of previous studies have demonstrated that
individual differences are important in the context of online
privacy, and include users’ gender [30], [31] and age [32]. For
example, past work suggests that women are more sensitive
to privacy concerns than men [30], [31], and are also more
risk-averse [33], [34]. These differences may lead to greater
privacy protection behaviors amongst women, especially when
privacy concerns are salient. Additionally, because women are
more concerned with others [35], they may be less willing to
share negative photos of others, again especially when privacy
concerns are salient. There is also evidence that individuals
older than 45 respond differently to privacy concerns that
younger individuals, because they are either more or less
concerned with privacy than their younger counterparts [32].
Thus, we include in this study an assessment of the effects of
gender and age on photo sharing.
We also investigate the extent to which our interventions
are inﬂuential when considering past behavioral characteris-

tics. For this purpose, we assess whether users’ self-reports
of photo- sharing behavior may be a meaningful predictor
of their photo-sharing behavior. Indeed, past research has
reliably shown that established habits are particularly potent
predictors of future behavior, especially in domains (such as
photo sharing) where behaviors are high in frequency and the
situation remains similar [36], [37]. Thus, in the present work
we also investigate the extent to which participants are high-,
middling-, or low-frequency sharers of photos. Naturally, we
hypothesize that people who have been high-frequency photo-
sharers in the past will report a higher frequency of sharing
photos in our experiment. Of additional interest is whether our
perspective taking and our privacy perspective interventions
may be qualiﬁed by participants’ photo-sharing habits. Past
research has shown that very strong habits are harder to change
than are moderate habits [38], [39]. Given this, of interest is
whether our interventions are stronger for participants who are
middling-frequency photo-sharers, relative to participants who
almost always or almost never share photos.
D. Controlling Dissemination and Limiting Information
interest
Our eventual
is in incorporating behavior inter-
ventions into technical solutions. Thus we review relevant
approaches to control the dissemination of photos. Existing
approaches fall into two broad categories: restricting viewers
and limiting content. Using access-control mechanisms (such
as privacy settings in Facebook), users may choose to limit
who can view shared content. Ahern et al. compiled a taxon-
omy of common privacy and security concerns people express
while uploading photographs in the cloud and proposed design
considerations to mitigate those risks [40]. Besmer and Lipford
proposed a user interface to help Facebook users control
dissemination of photos they were tagged in [41]. Klemperer
et al. studied how captions and tags of a photo can themselves
be used to infer access-control policies [42] and found that tag-
based rules can simplify the task of access control for photos.
Such et al. studied common problems faced by online social-
network users and their conﬂict resolution mechanisms when
there are multiple owners of shared content [43]. Squicciarini
et al. proposed automated ways to share images based on
an extended notion of content ownership where all owners
collectively enforce the privacy policies preferred by each [44],
[45]. More recently, Vishwamitra et al. proposed a multiparty
access control model based on ﬁner grained information within
photos to provide a collaborative control mechanism for photos
with multiple owners shared over social networks [46].
Other approaches proposed limiting information in a photo.
Two of the most prominent approaches are restricting photog-
raphers from capturing certain objects (including people) and
redacting certain objects (or people) from the captured photos.
In the ﬁrst category, researchers have proposed using special
markers [47], hand gestures [48], and QR codes [49] to signal
that certain objects or people should not be photographed.
Researchers have also designed systems that can detect if a
photo was taken in a certain place [50] or contain certain
objects [51],
in which case the default sharing of those
photos could be restricted by the system. Additionally, there
are privacy-preserving sharing platforms that enable users to
publish privacy preferences so that nearby photographers can
learn and respect their preferences, including I-Pic [52] and
