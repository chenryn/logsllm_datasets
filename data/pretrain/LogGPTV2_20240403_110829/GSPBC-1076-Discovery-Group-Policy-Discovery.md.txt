Patch asset vulnerabilities
2.
Perform routine inspections of controls/weapons
3.
Maintain Antivirus/EDR application updates
4.
Create network segmentation
5.
Log traﬃc between network segments
6.
Incorporate threat intelligence
7.
Perform routine inspections of asset backups
8.
Conduct user security awareness training
9.
Conduct response training (this PBC)                 | 1.
Monitor for:
a.
abnormal LDAP queries with ﬁlters for groupPolicyContainer and high
volumes of LDAP traﬃc to domain controllers. Windows Event ID 4661
can also be used to detect when a directory service has been
accessed[2]
b.
suspicious use of gpresult. Monitor for the use of PowerShell functions
such as Get-DomainGPO and Get-DomainGPOLocalGroup and
processes spawning with command-line arguments containing
GPOLocalGroup[3]
c.
newly executed processes that may gather information on Group Policy
settings to identify paths for privilege escalation, security measures
applied within a domain, and to discover patterns in domain objects that
can be manipulated or used to blend in the environment[4]
d.
any attempts to enable scripts running on a system would be considered
suspicious.
If scripts are not commonly used on a system, but enabled,
scripts running out of cycle from patching or other administrator
functions are suspicious. Scripts should be captured from the ﬁle system
when possible to determine their actions and intent[5]
2.
Investigate and clear ALL alerts associated with the impacted assets or accounts
3.
Routinely check ﬁrewall,
IDS,
IPS, and SIEM logs for any unusual activity                   | 1.
Inventory (enumerate & assess)
2.
Detect | Deny | Disrupt | Degrade | Deceive | Destroy
3.
Observe -> Orient -> Decide -> Act
4.
Issue perimeter enforcement for known threat actor locations
5.
Archive scanning related artifacts such as IP addresses, user agents, and requests
6.
Determine the source and pathway of the attack
7.
Fortify non-impacted critical assets                           |  |  |
| 2 | (E) Eradication | (R) Recovery      | (L) Lessons/Opportunities |  |  |
| 3 | 1.
Close the attack vector by applying the Preparation steps listed above
2.
Perform endpoint/AV scans on targeted systems
3.
Reset any compromised passwords
4.
Inspect ALL assets and user activity for IOC consistent with the attack proﬁle
5.
Inspect backups for IOC consistent with the attack proﬁle PRIOR to system recovery
6.
Patch asset vulnerabilities                 | 1.
Restore to the RPO (Recovery Point Objective) within the RTO (Recovery Time
Objective)
2.
Address any collateral damage by assessing exposed technologies
3.
Resolve any related security incidents
4.
Restore aﬀected systems to their last clean backup                   | 1.
Perform routine cyber hygiene due diligence
2.
Engage external cybersecurity-as-a-service providers and response professionals
3.
Implement policy changes to reduce future risk
4.
Utilize newly obtained threat signatures
5.
Remember that data and events should not be viewed in isolation but as part of a
chain of behavior that could lead to other activities                           |  |  |
