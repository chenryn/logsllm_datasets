Denial of 
Information Attacks:
Intentional Attacks

human or otherwise 
alter their decision 
making

from Slashdot…
I have a little PHP script that I use whenever I 
get a phishing email. The script generates fake 
credit card numbers, expiration dates, etc. and 
repeatedly hits the phishing site's form dumping 
in random info.
Any halfway intelligent phisher would record 
the IP address of each submission and just dump 
all of mine when he saw there were bogus, but it 
makes me feel good that I at least wasted some 
of his time ;)

The Problem of Information Growth
• The surface WWW contains ~170TB (17xLOC) 
• IM generates five billion messages a day (750GB), 
or 274 terabytes a year. 
• Email generates about 400,000 TB/year. 
• P2P file exchange on the Internet is growing 
rapidly. The largest files exchanged are video files 
larger than 100 MB, but the most frequently 
exchanged files contain music (MP3 files).

In the end, all the power of the 
IDS is ultimately controlled by 
a single judgment call on 
whether or not to take action.
