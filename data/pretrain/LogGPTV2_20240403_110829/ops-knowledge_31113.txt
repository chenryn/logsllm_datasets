User: I installed Anaconda a while ago but recently decided to uninstall it and just install basic python 2.7.
I removed Anaconda and deleted all the directories and installed python 2.7.
But when I go to install PyGTK for Windows it says it will install it to the c:/users/.../Anaconda directory - this doesn't even exist. I want to install it to the c:/python-2.7 directory. Why does it think Anaconda is still installed? And how can I change this?
Assistant: In my computer there wasn't a uninstaller in the Start Menu as well. But it worked it the Control Panel > Programs > Uninstall a Program, and selecting Python(Anaconda64bits) in the menu.
(Note that I'm using Win10)
