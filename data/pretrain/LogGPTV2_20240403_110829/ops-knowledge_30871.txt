I understand that you have been experiencing difficulties with `virtualenv` on your Macbook for the past two days. Hereâ€™s a more structured and detailed explanation of the issue and the solution:

### Issue Description
- **Installation**: You installed `virtualenv` using `pip install virtualenv`.
- **Error**: When attempting to create a new virtual environment with `virtualenv venv`, you encountered the error: "virtualenv: command not found".
- **Verification**: Using `pip show virtualenv`, you confirmed that `virtualenv` is installed at `/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages`.

### Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Check Installation Path**:
   - The `virtualenv` package is installed, but the executable might not be in your system's PATH.
   - Verify the location of the `virtualenv` executable by running:
     ```sh
     which virtualenv
     ```
   - If this command returns nothing, it means the `virtualenv` executable is not in your PATH.

2. **Custom Python Installation**:
   - You mentioned having a custom Python installation, which might be causing the issue.
   - Ensure that the `virtualenv` executable is linked to the correct Python version.

### Solution
- **Using `python -m virtualenv`**:
  - A workaround that worked for you is to use the `-m` option with Python to run the `virtualenv` module directly:
    ```sh
    python -m virtualenv venv
    ```
  - This approach bypasses the need for the `virtualenv` executable to be in your PATH and ensures that the correct Python interpreter is used.

### Additional Recommendations
- **Update PATH**:
  - Add the directory containing the `virtualenv` executable to your PATH. For example, if the executable is in `/usr/local/bin`, add the following line to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file:
    ```sh
    export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
    ```
  - Reload the shell configuration:
    ```sh
    source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc
    ```

- **Check for Multiple Python Versions**:
  - Ensure that there are no conflicts between different Python versions. You can list all Python installations using:
    ```sh
    ls /usr/local/bin/python*
    ```
  - Use the appropriate Python version to install and manage `virtualenv`.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and create virtual environments without encountering the "command not found" error.
