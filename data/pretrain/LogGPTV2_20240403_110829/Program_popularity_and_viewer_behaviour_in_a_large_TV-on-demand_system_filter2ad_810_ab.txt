### 4. Program Popularity and Access Patterns

#### 4.1. Program Popularity

There is a small set of popular programs that account for a very large part of the requests. The Pareto principle, or the 80-20 rule, is often used to describe video popularity and the concentration of user interest towards a few popular programs [7], [26]. In the TV-on-Demand system, the 20% most popular programs account for more than 80% of the requests.

**Figure 5: Daily and Hourly Changes in Top 100 and Top 1000 Programs**
- **(a)** Daily change among the top 100 and top 1000 most requested programs.
- **(b)** Hourly change among the top 100 most requested programs. The figures also show the fraction of all programs that were not requested the day and hour before.

**Figure 6: Cumulative Distribution of Requests to Programs (1 day, 7 days, and 125 days)**
- This figure shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of requests per program for 1 day, 1 week, and the entire 125-day period.

**Figure 7: Log-Log Plot of Requests per Program (1 day, 7 days, 125 days)**
- This figure shows the number of times a program has been accessed versus its ranking in the dataset on a log-log scale.

**Key Observations:**
- For the entire 125-day period, the 2% most popular programs account for 48% of the requests, the 10% most popular programs account for 74% of the requests, and the 20% most popular programs receive 84% of the requests.
- The skewness in popularity for TV-on-Demand is between what has been described for user-generated content (e.g., YouTube) and traditional Video-on-Demand systems (e.g., PowerInfo).

#### 4.2. Access Patterns per Program Category

Different categories of programs have different access patterns. Figure 8 shows the number of requests per hour over two weeks for programs in four different categories: rental movies, TV news, drama, and children's programs.

**Figure 8: Access Patterns per Program Category**
- **Rental Movies:** Movie rentals are concentrated over weekends with large peaks in demand during Friday and Saturday evenings.
- **TV News:** Most requests are close to the scheduled broadcast times at 19:00 and 22:00.
- **Drama and Children's Programs:** Drama shows are watched more during the daytime, while children's programs have peaks in demand in the mornings and early evenings, especially on weekends.

#### 4.3. Access Patterns for Individual Programs

The popularity of a program changes over time, and the demand pattern varies depending on the program type. Figure 9 shows the number of requests per day for 20 different programs over 125 days.

**Figure 9: Requests per Day for Different Programs**
- **Rental Movies:** There is a slow decline in popularity over time, with clear weekly patterns and peaks in demand at the weekends.
- **TV News Programs:** These are mostly requested on the first evening and quickly lose popularity.
- **TV Reality Shows and Home Improvement Shows:** Request patterns for different episodes of the same show are similar, with an initial peak in demand followed by a quick decline.

#### 4.3.1. The Life of a Rental Movie

**Figure 10: Detailed Analysis of a Comedy-Drama Rental Movie**
- **(a)** Number of requests per day and rank over 16 weeks from the premiere.
- **(b)** Change in rank among the top 100 most popular programs each day, showing the movie jumping in and out of the top 10 and top 100 lists multiple times.

**Figure 11: Rank and Number of Requests per Hour During the First Week**
- The movie quickly climbs in rank and becomes one of the most popular programs, with large, predictable daily variations in demand and peaks in the evenings.

**Key Observations:**
- The movie is the most popular rental movie for 14 consecutive days and stays in the top 10 for one month and in the top 20 for two months.
- It is essential to have the right programs in the cache at peak times, such as Friday and Saturday evenings, to meet high demand.

### Conclusion

Understanding the popularity and access patterns of programs in a TV-on-Demand system is crucial for optimizing caching strategies. The 80-20 rule and the concentration of requests to a small set of programs highlight the importance of efficient caching. The dynamic nature of TV-on-Demand, with a large daily inflow of new content, requires careful consideration of program life cycles and demand patterns.
