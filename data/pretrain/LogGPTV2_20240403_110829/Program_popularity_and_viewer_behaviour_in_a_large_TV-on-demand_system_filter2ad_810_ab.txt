popular items will be is more predictable during weekends
when the demand also is the highest. This is even clearer
on an hourly basis.
Figure 5b shows the hourly change among the top 100
most requested programs. On average 51 out of the 100
most requested programs are the same as the hour before.
But the amount of change in the top 100 varies from hour
to hour in a distinct daily cycle. During night up to 92%
of the top 100 programs are changed from one hour to the
next. While during prime time (19:00 to 23:00) the top 100-
list becomes much more stable with down to 19% change
among the top 100 programs.
4. PROGRAM POPULARITY
There is a small set of popular programs that account
for a very large part of the requests. The Pareto princi-
ple, or the 80-20 rule, is often referred to when describing
video popularity and the concentration of user interest to-
wards a few popular programs [7], [26]. The users spread of
requests across programs in the TV-on-Demand system con-
forms with this principle. The 20 % most popular programs
account for more than 80% of the requests.
We calculated the number of requests for each program,
sorted them in order of popularity, and plotted the cumula-
tive distribution function shown in Figure 6. Here we can
see the number of requests per program as a CDF-plot for
1 day, 1 week and for the entire 125-day period.
If we consider the entire 125-day period, then the 2% most
popular programs account for 48% of the requests, the 10%
most popular programs account for 74% of the requests, and
the 20% most popular programs receive 84% of the requests.
The ﬁgures are similar on daily and weekly basis as well.
This skewness in popularity for TV-on-Demand is some-
where in between what has been described in the litera-
ture for user-generated content and traditional Video-on-
Demand systems. For Youtube traﬃc, investigated by Cha
et al. [7], 10% of the videos accounted for 80% of the re-
quests. In the chinese PowerInfo Video-on-Demand system
described by Yu et al. [26], 10% of the videos accounted for
60% of the accesses. TV-on-Demand systems are more dy-

namic than traditional VoD systems with a large daily inﬂow
of new content. As we will see in Section 4.2, there are pro-
grams that are popular for several weeks and accumulate a
lot of requests, but there are also many programs that have
a very short life-span and are only requested for a few hours.
Figure 7 shows the number of requests per program as a
log-log plot. It shows the number of times that a program
has been accessed versus the ranking of the program in the
data set.
There are a large number of research papers that deal with
the popularity distribution of web pages and video. Much
of the debate concerns whether the distribution of requests
is Zipf-like or not [6, 7, 9, 13, 26]. Here we do not try to
ﬁt the curve to a speciﬁc probability distribution. However,
we note that the curve does not follow a straight line on the
log-log scale. This implies that the distribution of TV-on-
Demand requests does not follow a Zipf-like distribution.
The 80-20 rule, and the concentration of requests to a
small set of programs is important for caching. This is inde-
pendent of what exact probability distribution best describes
the access frequency. In Section 5 we perform trace-driven
simulation, and directly use the sequence of requests to in-
vestigate the impact on caching.
4.1 Access patterns per program category
Diﬀerent categories of programs have diﬀerent access pat-
terns. Figure 8 shows the number of requests per hour over
two weeks for programs in four diﬀerent categories: rental
video, TV news, drama and children’s programs. The ﬁgure
demonstrates some clear and expected diﬀerences in access
patterns.
The top left ﬁgure shows the access pattern for rental
movies. These are movies that a viewer can pay to access
for 24 hours. We can see that movie rentals are concentrated
over weekends with large peaks in demand during Friday and
Saturday evenings.
For TV news the traditional TV schedule determines to a
large extent also when the program is requested on demand.
The TV news is scheduled daily at 19:00 and 22:00. At the
same time it becomes available for time-shifted viewing and
we can see that most requests are close to these times.
For the other two categories we note that the TV reality
and drama shows are watched during the daytime to a larger
degree than other programs. We also see that the children’s
programs have peaks in demand in the mornings and early
evenings. This is especially true for weekends.
4.2 Access patterns for individual programs:
how program popularity changes over time
The popularity of a program changes with time and the
demand pattern varies depending on the program type. Fig-
ure 9 shows the number of requests per day for 20 diﬀerent
programs over 125 days.
The top ﬁgures show the most requested rental movies and
TV news programs in the data set. For each movie we can
see a slow decline in popularity over time. The movies are
requested many weeks after their premiere. There is also a
clear weekly pattern with peaks in demand at the weekends.
For TV news programs the access patterns are very diﬀerent
compared to movies. A news program is mostly requested
the ﬁrst evening and then quickly becomes outdated and
loses its popularity when available on demand.
The ﬁgures at the bottom show the access pattern for
ﬁve episodes of a daily TV reality show and ﬁve episodes
of a weekly home improvement show. We can see that the
request patterns for diﬀerent episodes of the same show are
surprisingly similar. For the reality show we can also see
that after the initial peak in demand the program popularity
quickly decline with time. The programs are requested daily
also the following three months but there are often only a
few requests per day.
4.2.1 The life of a rental movie
Figure 10a shows the number of requests per day and the
rank for a comedy-drama rental movie. We can see the de-
cline in popularity over 16 weeks from the premiere. The

ﬁgure also demonstrates the typical peaks in popularity for
a rental movie during weekends where the number of re-
quests increases and the program increase in rank.
Figure 10b shows the change in rank in more detail among
the top 100 most popular programs each day. We can see
that the movie jumps in and out of the top 10 and top
100 lists a number of times. This has implications for the
choice of caching strategy. It is essential to have the right
programs in the cache at Friday and Saturday evenings when
the total demand is the highest. If the replacement policy
acts on popularity over a short time window the program
might be evicted when popularity temporarily goes down
during weekdays and the program will not immediately be
available in the cache when the demand increases again next
weekend.
Figure 10b also compare the rank for our movie among
all programs with the rank among only rental movies. The
movie is the number one most popular movie for 14 days in
a row and it stays in the top 10 for one month and in the
top 20 for two months.
Figure 11 shows the rank and the number of requests per
hour during the ﬁrst week that the movie is available. The
movie quickly climbs in rank and becomes one of the most
popular programs. It is in the top ten during the evenings
but the rank of the program sometimes drops during the
daytime and during night. There are large, predictable daily
variations in demand with peaks in the evenings. The num-
ber of requests increases signiﬁcantly during Friday and Sat-
