Abstract: Exchanging the channel state information (CSI)
in a multiuser WLAN is considered an extremely expen-
sive overhead. A possible solution to reduce the overhead is
to notify the analog value of the CSI, which is also known
as analog channel feedback. It however only allows nodes to
overhear an imperfect channel information. While some pre-
vious studies have theoretically analyzed the performance of
analog channel feedback, this work aims at addressing issues
of realizing it in practice and empirically demonstrating its
eﬀectiveness. Our prototype implementation using USRP-
N200 shows that analog channel feedback produces a small
error comparable to that of estimating CSI using reciprocity,
but however can be applied to more general scenarios.

INTRODUCTION
Exchanging the CSI in a multiuser WLAN is considered
an extremely expensive overhead. A possible solution to
overhead reduction for channel feedback is to leverage chan-
nel reciprocity, which is a property that the channels in the
forward and reverse directions are the same. Consider a
scenario where Alice is interested in knowing the channel
between Alice and Bob, which is called the forward chan-
nel in this work. To obtain the perfect channel information,
Bob should learn the channel from the preamble sent by
Alice, and send it back to Alice. However, by leveraging
reciprocity, we can ask Bob to send a preamble for Alice to
learn the channel between Bob and Alice, called the reverse
channel, and use it to estimate the forward channel without
channel feedback.
Though learning the CSI using reciprocity has been em-
pirically shown feasible in many practical systems, e.g., [1,
2], it however has two limitations. First, it requires hard-
ware calibration [1], which incurs additional overhead and
could be performed imperfectly, aﬀecting accuracy of chan-
nel estimation. Second, and more importantly, reciprocity is
only applicable to the above Alice and Bob example, where
a node wants to feedback the forward channel to its own

source, i.e., Alice. It however cannot be applied to a general
scenario where Bob needs to feedback its forward channel
to a node other than its source, say Chris. This scenario is
actually quite common and necessary for many applications,
e.g., interference alignment and MU-MIMO rate adaptation.
To address the above issues, an alternative solution is to
notify the analog value of the CSI without modulation and
coding, also known as analog channel feedback [3], which re-
quires signiﬁcantly less overhead than traditional quantized
(digital) channel feedback. Any node that overhears the
analog information can recover the imperfect but accurate
enough CSI. While some previous theoretical works [3] have
analyzed the performance of analog channel feedback, this
work aims at addressing issues of realizing it in practice and
empirically demonstrate its beneﬁt and limitation. Our pro-
totype implementation using USRP-N200 shows that analog
channel feedback produces a small error comparable to the
error of learning CSI using reciprocity, but however can be
applied to more real applications.
2. ANALOG CHANNEL FEEDBACK
In this section, we ﬁrst introduce analog channel feedback,
and discuss how to apply it in a MIMO system. We ﬁnally
investigate practical issues of realizing it in practice.
Analog channel feedback in a SISO system: The high
level idea of analog channel feedback is that, unlike the tradi-
tional approach, which represents data as digital (discrete)
values, analog channel feedback represents the CSI as analog
(continuous) values, and transmits these analog values di-
rectly without modulation and coding. Any node that over-
hears the information can simply decode the received signal
and get the channel information without demodulation and
the CRC check. The main diﬀerence is that the traditional
digital channel feedback ensures a node to receive exactly
the same channel information with what the notiﬁer learned
if it passes the CRC check, while a node receiving analog
channel feedback could recover imperfect channel informa-
tion with additive channel noise.
Lets consider again the Alice and Bob example. Assume
that Bob wants to announce the channel between Alice and
Bob hAB = a + bi. The traditional digital channel feed-
back requires Bob to convert the real part of hAB to the
binary number, e.g., (a)10 = (001··· 0)2, and convert the
image part to another binary number. It hence costs two
ﬂoating points to represent hAB. Analog channel feedback
diﬀers from the traditional approach in that Bob directly
transmits the complex number of the channel information
hAB = a + bi without any binary quantization and modu-
lation, and hence costs only one sample to send hAB. Any
neighboring node, say Chris, overhears the analog feedback
y = h(cid:2) ∗ hAB + n, where h(cid:2)
is the channel between Bob and
Chris and n is the additive channel noise. Chris can hence

recover hAB by decoding y, i.e., ˜hAB = y/h(cid:2)
= hAB + n/h(cid:2)
.
Accuracy of such imperfect channel information depends on
the error n/h(cid:2)
. To apply analog channel feedback in OFDM
channels, where each subcarrier has a distinct channel in-
formation, Bob can simply use each subcarrier to send the
analog channel information of that subcarrier, and hence
require only one OFDM symbol for channel feedback.
channel notiﬁer and ˜H is the estimated CSI recovered by
the node who is interested in this information, using either
reciprocity or analog channel feedback.
Analog channel feedback in a MIMO system: Con-
sider now a MIMO example where Alice has M antennas
and Bob has N antennas. Say Bob wants to announce its
M×N×K channel matrix between Alice and Bob, where K
is the number of OFDM subcarriers. Due to space limit,
we only discuss the case where Bob announces its CSI to a
node with more than or equal to N antennas and thus be-
ing able to decode N concurrent streams. In this case, each
of Bob’s N antennas is in charge of transmitting M×1×K
channel information, which is the channels from Alice’s M
antennas to that corresponding antenna over K subcarriers.
All of Bob’s N antennas can transmit their channels con-
currently. Analog channel feedback in this MIMO example
hence requires M OFDM symbols.
Practical issues: We now discuss some practical issues.
First, to eliminate the error, i.e., n/h(cid:2)
, in analog channel
feedback, we leverage the property that channel noise n is
typically additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), which fol-
lows a zero-mean normal distribution. In particular, a chan-
nel notiﬁer, e.g., Bob in the above example, can announce
the same analog CSI multiple times. Then, a node that over-
hears the feedback can average up multiple received analog
channels and approximate the error to zero. We will evaluate
in Sec. 3 how many repetitive announcements are suﬃcient
to cancel out most of the noise. Second, each hardware has
a linearity range, which is the range of input and output val-
ues for an ampliﬁer to ensure the linear function of signals.
Hence, the amplitude of analog channel feedback needs to
be within the linearity range of hardware to ensure proper
decoding. To achieve this goal, we allow a channel notiﬁer to
scale the analog channels by a coeﬃcient and then transmit
the scaled analog channels along with that coeﬃcient. Con-
sider again the same example. Instead of directly sending
the channel of the kth subcarrier hk
AB,
where α = L/|hmax
AB |, L is the hardware linearity range, and
|hmax
AB | is the maximum magnitude among the channels of
all subcarriers. A node can hence recover the analog CSI by
decoding ˜hk
AB, Bob can send α∗hk
AB = y/h(cid:2)/α.
3. EMPIRICAL EVALUATION
We implement analog channel feedback using the USRP-
N200 radios equipped with an RFX2400 daughterboard. Our
prototype implementation uses a 10MHz 802.11 OFDM chan-
nel, which includes 48 data subcarriers. We follow [1] and
use ΔH = (cid:3)H − ˜H(cid:3)/(cid:3)H(cid:3) to quantitatively examine accu-
racy of the CSI, where H is the true CSI learned by the
Impact of number of repetitive announcement: We
ﬁrst check how many repetitive analog CSI feedback is suf-
ﬁcient to cancel out the error. We implement the example
of Alice and Bob, both equipped with a single antenna, and
repeat the experiment in randomly-selected locations in our
testbed. Fig. 1(a) plots the average error (ΔH) over all the
experiments when Bob announces the analog CSI from once
to ten times. It veriﬁes that Alice can get a more accurate
channel information if it averages up more repetitive an-
nouncements of the analog channel information. The ﬁgure
however shows that averaging three repetitive analog CSI is
suﬃcient to reduce the error signiﬁcantly.
Accuracy Comparison: We next compare accuracy of
the CSI learned by analog channel feedback and using reci-
procity. We consider again the single-antenna Alice and
Bob example. Fig. 1(b) plots the CDFs of the error in the
CSI learned by using reciprocity and analog channel feed-
back with 3, 5, and 10 repetitive announcements, respec-
tively. The ﬁgure indicates that analog channel feedback
with three repetitive announcements requires only a little
bit more overhead, i.e., three OFDM symbols, than reci-
procity, but can outperform reciprocity in most of cases be-
cause the channels might not be perfectly symmetric and
the hardware might not be able to be calibrated perfectly.
Fig. 1(c) compares accuracy of the recovered CSI for the
2×2 MIMO scenario. It shows that sending analog CSI us-
ing the multiplex gain achieves a performance comparable
to reciprocity. We can further reduce the error by leveraging
the diversity gain. Note that the overhead is still very small,
i.e., few OFDM symbols, even if achieving the diversity gain
requires double overhead.
4. CONCLUSION
In this work, we empirically evaluate the eﬀectiveness
of analog channel feedback using USRP-N200, and discuss
some practical implementation issues. Our testbed results
show that analog channel feedback reduces the overhead sig-
niﬁcantly, but can produce an acceptable small feedback er-
ror, comparable to that learned by using reciprocity. How-
ever, unlike using reciprocity, analog channel feedback allows
a channel notiﬁer to broadcast its CSI to a node other than
its source, and hence can be applied in general scenarios.
