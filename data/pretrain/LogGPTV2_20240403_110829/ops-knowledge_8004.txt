User: Why do we need high availability and load balancing, and how are they implemented?
Assistant: High availability and load balancing are to ensure the stability, reliability, scalability and high-performance operation of the application system. 1. High availability High availability means that the system can still maintain normal operation in the event of hardware failure, system failure, network failure or other unpredictable situations. High availability can be achieved in the following ways: (1) Dual-machine hot standby: Deploy completely consistent application systems on two servers, one of which is the main server and the other is the standby server. When the main server fails, the standby server will automatically take over the work of the main server to ensure high availability of the application system. (2) Cluster: Use multiple servers to form a cluster, and ensure high availability of the application system through technologies such as shared resources, load balancing, and failover. 2. Load balancing Load balancing refers to distributing requests to multiple servers to avoid system crashes caused by excessive load on a single server. Load balancing can be achieved in the following ways: (1) Hardware load balancer: Use hardware devices to load balance requests. Commonly used hardware devices include F5, CISCO, etc. (2) Software load balancer: Use software to load balance requests. Commonly used software includes LVS, Nginx, HaProxy, etc. (3) DNS load balancing: Use DNS resolvers to distribute requests to different server IPs to achieve load balancing. In short, high availability and load balancing are key requirements for today's Internet application systems, and only in this way can the efficient and stable operation of the business be satisfied.
