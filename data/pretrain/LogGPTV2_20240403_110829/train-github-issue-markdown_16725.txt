### Superset version
0.22.1
### Expected results
Rearranging fields on "group by" and "metrics" should be easy. Using drag and
drop, we should be able to rearrange it.
### Actual results
I am not able to rearrange fields on fields chosen on "Group by" and
"Metrics". To rearrange it, I have to delete all chosen fields and then
arrange it in required order.
### Steps to reproduce
Rearrange the fields chosen on "group by" or "metrics"
