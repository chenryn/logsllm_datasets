### Superset Version
0.22.1

### Expected Results
Rearranging fields in the "Group By" and "Metrics" sections should be straightforward. Users should be able to easily rearrange these fields using a drag-and-drop interface.

### Actual Results
I am unable to rearrange the fields in the "Group By" and "Metrics" sections. To achieve the desired order, I must delete all selected fields and then re-add them in the required sequence.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Select multiple fields in the "Group By" or "Metrics" section.
2. Attempt to rearrange the fields by dragging and dropping them.
3. Observe that the fields cannot be rearranged and must be deleted and re-added to change their order.
