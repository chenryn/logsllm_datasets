ABSTRACT
We address the case in credential systems where a creden-
tial owner wants to show her credential to a veriﬁer with-
out taking the risk that the ability to prove ownership of
the same (and any other) credential is transferred to the
veriﬁer. We deﬁne credential ownership proof protocols for
credentials signed by standard signature schemes. We also
propose proper security deﬁnitions for the protocol, aiming
to protect the security of both the credential issuer and the
credential owner against concurrent attacks. We give two
generic constructions of credential ownership proofs based
on identity-based encryption and identity-based identiﬁca-
tion schemes. Furthermore, we show that signatures with
credential ownership proofs are equivalent to identity-based
identiﬁcation schemes, in the sense that any secure construc-
tion of each implies a secure construction of the other. Fi-
nally, we show that the GQ identiﬁcation protocol yields
an eﬃcient credential ownership proof for credentials signed
by the RSA-FDH signature scheme of Bellare and Rogaway
and prove the protocol concurrently-secure.

game, multiple games, or all games in a season. In the latter
two cases, although the same ticket can be used multiple
times, the system must ensure that for each game the ticket
is used only once.
A basic credential system based on digital signatures can
closely satisfy these requirements. The electronic ticket will
have a text m that states the entitlement of the user, and the
signature σ of the club on m. When the ticket is presented to
a ticket controller, the signature of the club is veriﬁed, and if
valid, the statement m will be honored. Tickets should not
be linked to individuals’ identities and users should have the
ﬂexibility to give their tickets to others as long as ‘one user
one ticket’ per game is enforced. Not including user-speciﬁc
information in tickets and allowing tickets to be circulated
among users, implies that there is no direct link between the
user and the ticket and so users’ privacy will be protected.
it appears secure as-
suming the signature system provides unforgeability; it is
eﬃcient and requires one signature generation and veriﬁ-
cation for ticket generation and checking, respectively; and
uses standard cryptography, so is easy to implement.
The system looks very attractive:
This basic system, however, is completely insecure against
ticket cloning. The ticket can be illegally copied (cloned) by
(i) legitimate ticket holders (who have legally purchased the
ticket), and (ii) ticket controllers during ticket veriﬁcation
phase. Protection against the former can be easily enforced
by adding a checking stage for the serial number of the pre-
sented tickets against a log of the serial numbers of already-
shown tickets and so eﬀectively prevent ‘double spending’ of
the ticket. However, the system is still vulnerable to copying
by a (real or fake) ticket controller. A malicious controller
will make a copy of the ticket during a showing by an honest
user, and then successfully use it for future games, simply by
making sure that he is the ﬁrst to present the ticket to the
system. This way, the user will eﬀectively lose the privilege
that the ticket needs to guarantee.
An immediate solution would be to require ticket holders
to prove ownership of the ticket without directly showing it
to the controller. A user can show her claimed privilege m
and then prove in zero knowledge (ZK) [19] that she knows
the club’s signature on the message. That is, she can use a
ZK protocol for proof of knowledge (PoK) [2] of a signature
on the claimed message, i.e. a ZK-PoK of a member of the
NP language L(pk,m) = {σ : Verify (pk, m, σ)}. The zero-
knowledge property, however, although guaranteeing that
no information other than the validity of the signature is re-
vealed to the controller, is computationally expensive and
requires many rounds of communication. Therefore, the
161
not address a system of diﬀerent credential holders. In Sec-
tion 3.1, we further elaborate on these deﬁnitions and show
that our security requirements captures all the requirements
of the above scenario.
In the following we outline other most relevant systems in
relation to our work.
Anonymous Credentials. Anonymous credential sys-
tems (a.k.a. pseudonym systems) ensure privacy of users in
securely accessing services of organizations. Organizations
issue credentials on users’ pseudonyms, and hence the name
‘pseudonym systems’. Pseudonym systems were introduced
by Chaum [10, 11] and more recently further formalized and
studied in [24, 23]. The aim of these systems is to simul-
taneously guarantee anonymity of credential holders, un-
linkability of credential showings, and non-transferability of
credentials. These property ensure ultimate users’ privacy
and organizations’ security at a high computation and com-
munication cost. Indeed, most of such systems use multiple
zero knowledge protocols for issuing and verifying creden-
tials (see e.g.
[9, 23]). In many real life applications, such
as our motivating scenario above, a more moderate level of
security is considered suﬃcient as long as much higher eﬃ-
ciency can be provided. It is however crucial to clearly state
the required security properties and prove it is achievable
for the proposed constructions. Our work is an step in this
direction.
Identification Protocols. One of the security goals
of a COP protocol, protection of the secret of the credential
holder, can be seen as parallel to the security goal of an iden-
tiﬁcation protocol, if authority’s signature is the prover’s se-
cret in the identiﬁcation protocol. Security requirement of
COP with regard to credential holder is in line with that
of identiﬁcation protocols as deﬁned in [17], with attacker’s
goal being impersonation of the prover, without having her
secret. The strongest attack model for identiﬁcation pro-
tocols allows the adversary to pose as a veriﬁer and run
arbitrary-interleaved (i.e. concurrent) sessions [5] with the
prover before taking up the role of a malicious prover. We
model a similar attacker for COP (having concurrent ses-
sions with prover) and also allow the attacker to have access
to signing oracle that models the credential issuer. COP
security also requires security for credential issuer, which is
not required in identiﬁcation protocols.
DMA and NTS Schemes. Deniable Message Authenti-
cation (DMA) [16] and Non-Transitive Signature (NTS) [14,
26] schemes enable a sender to construct an authenticated
message for a receiver such that the receiver cannot con-
vince a third party about the origin of the message. In other
words, they provide unforgeability guarantee of a digital sig-
nature but the message can be repudiated as the receiver can
simulate the transcript of the protocol. The security goals in
DMA and NTS schemes are complementary to a basic cre-
dential system as described above. That is, the credential
holder may require that his credential ownership proof be
repudiable. Although in a COP protocol the proof is inter-
active, but the proof transcript may not be simulatable and
so in this sense, non-repudiable. DMA and NTS systems
use zero knowledge proofs to provide repudiation property.
Such proofs are costly and we wish to avoid them in simple
credential systems, like the ones discussed above.
In fact
this (avoiding ZK proofs) has been one of the motivation of
our work.
question is: “Is there a more eﬃcient way of implementing
a credential system with the above requirements?”
In this paper we give a positive answer to the above ques-
tion by proposing an extension to signature schemes which
we call Credential Ownership Proof (COP), that captures
the required security property. We also give generic and
concrete constructions for COP protocols with provable se-
curity.
A COP for a signature scheme is an interactive protocol
attached to the scheme, that allows a credential holder to
prove interactively the ownership of a claimed credential to
a veriﬁer. A secure COP must ensure security of credential
holders and credential issuer, both. That is, prover’s in-
teraction with multiple veriﬁers should not allow mis-use of
the system by enabling successful run of the protocol with-
out having the required credentials. We show that COPs
can be much more eﬃcient than zero-knowledge proofs (see
Table 3).
In particular, the COP for RSA-based creden-
tials that we construct, is based on the GQ protocol [21],
which is known to be only honest veriﬁer zero knowledge
[21]. This makes COPs and their secure construction of
immediate practical importance. We note the following re-
marks with respect to users’ privacy in the above credential
system:
• In the above credential system, showings of a ticket are
linkable through the value of m, which, as mentioned
before, must be unique to prevent double spending.
However users cannot be traced as the tickets can be
purchased by any user. Such linkability property en-
ables conducting (anonymous) statistical analyses on
the behavior of users.
• The system allows users to make ‘clones’ of their tick-
ets and share them with their trusted friends. The
‘double spending’ protection of the ticket controlling
system ensures that for each game only a single user
will actually use the ticket. The users, however, have
higher ﬂexibility with the tickets and are able to share
their tickets, which is a very attractive property.
1.1 Related Work
Credential systems and their vast range of security prop-
erties in diﬀerent applications have been intensively stud-
ied in recent years. The closest work to ours is Universal
Designated Veriﬁer Signature Proofs (UDVSP) introduced
by Baek et al.
[1]. A UDVSP is similar to a COP as it
enables a signature holder to prove the ownership of a sig-
nature to a veriﬁer, however, the security properties of the
two are very diﬀerent. In UDVSP the goal is to remove a re-
striction of Universal Designated Veriﬁer Signature (UDVS)
proposed by Steinfeld et al.
[28] and the security model is
mainly geared to ensure security of a single credential holder
and with no concern about security of the credential issuer.
In particular, in their security model, there is no security
guarantee against an adversary who corrupts a number of
credential holders and gets to know their credentials (e.g.
ticket controller who collects many copies of tickets) or pos-
sibly can obtain tickets of his choice by directly asking the
credential issuer. Baek et al’s deﬁnition of security is one-
sided and resembles security deﬁnition of an identiﬁcation
protocol.
It focuses on the security of a single credential
holder (corresponding to the owner of the secret in identi-
ﬁcation protocols), but not the issuing authority, and does

1.2 Our Contributions
We formalize the security model of a credential system,
consisting of credential issuers, credential holders, and ver-
iﬁers, with emphasis on security of credential showing. A
credential issuer signs a credential using a secure (i.e. un-
forgeable against chosen message attack) signature scheme.
A credential holder wants to prove to a veriﬁer that he has
a credential but would like to make sure that the credential
cannot be copied. This protection against copying is crucial
in scenarios as described above and so it is imperative that
the credential holder only provide ‘proof’ for ownership of
the credential and not the actual credential. An immediate
question is what properties such a proof should have, and if
eﬃcient constructions exist.
In this paper, we deﬁne credential ownership proof (COP)
protocols for signature schemes. We give security notions
for COPs that capture precisely the security requirements
of the scenario given earlier, and guarantees security of cre-
dential holders and issuers both. COPs have also the de-
sirable property that they provide some level of control for
the credential holders over unwanted distribution of their
credentials. This, however, is not in the strongest sense of
repudiability of the credential, but as a side eﬀect of em-
ploying proofs.
Next we consider construction of COPs. We provide two
generic constructions for signature schemes and their as-
sociated secure COPs. The ﬁrst construction is based on
identity-based encryption (IBE) [27]. It has been observed
that a secure identity-based encryption scheme can be uti-
lized to construct a secure signature scheme1. We show
that it is possible to deﬁne a secure COP for this scheme
in a natural way. We reduce security of this COP to one-
wayness of the underlying IBE under chosen-ciphertext at-
tacks (denoted owe-id-cca). This is a new security notion
for IBE, that is, in terms of strength, in between the two
(folklore standard) notions of one-wayness (under chosen-
plaintext attacks, denoted owe-id) and indistinguishabil-
ity under chosen-ciphertext attacks (denoted ind-id-cca),
introduced in [7]. We show that this generic construction
results in a scheme provably-secure based on standard com-
putational assumptions in the standard model (i.e. not in
the random oracle mpodel ).
The second generic construction is based on identity-based
identiﬁcation (IBI) [3]. We show an equivalence between
a signature that is euf-cma (i.e. existentially unforgeable
under chosen-message attacks [20]) plus an associated COP
that is secure in our model, and an IBI that is secure against
impersonation under concurrent attacks (in the sense of [3]).
We show a one-to-one relationship between entities and al-
gorithms, and give a bilateral translation of security notions
of the two.
An interesting observation in this context with regard to
COPs is their application in construction of secure IBIs.
Kurosawa and Heng [22] gave a generic construction for an
IBI from a signature scheme and an HVZK proof of knowl-
edge (PoK) protocol. Security of their construction however
was proved only against a passive adversary. We show that
replacing PoK protocol with a COP protocol in their con-
struction will result in security against active and concurrent
attacks. This results in a generic construction of secure IBI
schemes from COP schemes.
