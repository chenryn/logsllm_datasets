## Bug Report
  * I would like to work on a fix!  
I have close to zero experience with Babel's internals though. I would not be
offended, if you think you can fix it yourself quicklier.
**Current Behavior**  
The `typescript` preset is incompatible with `d3-array/cumsum.js`. The issue
seems to only occur for arrow functions using the `+=` operator, nested inside
a ternary. When `typescript` is disabled, the code compiled without any
issues.
**Input Code**
  * Original broken `d3-array/cumsum.js`: REPL
  * Minimal reproduction: REPL
    0 ? v => (sum += v) : v => 0;
> /repl.ts: Only '=' operator can be used for specifying default value. (1:13)
>
>> 1 | 0 ? v => (sum += v) : v => 0;
**Expected behavior/code**  
Babel should compile the above code with `typescript` enabled.
