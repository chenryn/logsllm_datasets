## Bug Report

* I am interested in working on a fix for this issue. However, I have very little experience with Babel's internals. If you believe that you can resolve the problem more quickly, I would not be offended.

### Current Behavior
The `typescript` preset is incompatible with `d3-array/cumsum.js`. The issue appears to be specific to arrow functions using the `+=` operator within a ternary expression. When the `typescript` preset is disabled, the code compiles without any issues.

### Input Code
- **Original broken `d3-array/cumsum.js`:** [REPL](<link-to-repl>)
- **Minimal reproduction:** [REPL](<link-to-repl>)

```javascript
0 ? v => (sum += v) : v => 0;
```

**Error:**
```
/repl.ts: Only '=' operator can be used for specifying default value. (1:13)
```

### Expected Behavior
Babel should compile the above code successfully when the `typescript` preset is enabled.
