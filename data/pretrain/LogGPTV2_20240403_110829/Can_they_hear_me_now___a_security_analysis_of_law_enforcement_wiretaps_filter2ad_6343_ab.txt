target’s telephone switch. The ﬁrst of these lines carries a
Call Data Channel (CDC) that reports the signaling events
(call times, numbers dialed, line status, etc.) associated
with all lines being monitored by the agency at that switch.
Additional lines to the law enforcement agency carry Call
Content Channels (CCCs) that contain the live audio or
data stream of any active monitored lines for which content
interception has been authorized. The CDC carries call data
for every active target on the switch tapped by a particular
agency. The CCCs, on the other hand, carry only one audio
or data stream at a time, with their activity reported over
the CDC.
While CALEA applies only in the United States, J-standard
compliant switches and interception products are marketed
in other countries as well.
Other approaches
Law enforcement agencies in the US
generally use either loop extenders or CALEA for wiretaps
associated with criminal investigations.
Intelligence agen-
cies and other eavesdroppers (legal or illegal), however, may
use other techniques. The range of technically possible ap-
proaches to surveillance on modern communications plat-
forms is very wide. In this paper, however, we focus on the
much more limited set of tapping techniques used by US
(and other) law enforcement to gather evidence legally.
2. CALEA AND J-STD-025
In 1994, the Communications Assistance for Law Enforce-
ment Act (CALEA) [34] was enacted to regulate telecom-
munications compliance with lawful surveillance of digitally
switched telephone networks. The law was intended to pro-
tect consumer privacy in light of new communications ser-
vices [35], to avoid encumbering the development of new
communication technologies [35], and to clearly delineate
the responsibilities of telecommunications carriers with re-
spect to court authorized surveillance [11].
2.1 J-standard (J-STD-025)
While CALEA clearly deﬁnes the legal responsibilities of
telecommunications service providers (TSPs), it does not
provide technical speciﬁcations or protocols pertaining to
wiretap conﬁguration, data collection, or data delivery. Rather,
the law speciﬁes that a joint task force composed of repre-
sentatives from TSPs and Federal and State Law Enforce-
ment Agencies (LEAs) develop a voluntary industry stan-
dard. Consequently, the current standard has evolved as a
result of compromise amid conﬂicting interests between the
FBI, the telecommunications industry and interest groups.
Speciﬁcally, the Telecommunications Industry Association
(TIA), the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solu-
tions (ATIS), and various other industry organizations and
interest groups developed the interim standard J-STD-025 [3]
(the J-standard). The current revision of the J-standard, the
J-STD-025-B, was adopted in 2006 and adapts the Stan-
dard in order to accommodate new wireless services. Addi-
tional adaptations of the J-standard add support for VoIP
services [22, 15].
The vast majority of CALEA vendor equipment of which
we are familiar implement the J-standard or a derivative of
it. This architecture is the only currently ﬁelded standard
for complying with CALEA. Moreover, CALEA’s “safe har-
bor” provision, stating that any wireline, cellular, and broad-
band TSP that implements these standards is considered to
be in compliance with CALEA [34], further incentivizes its
adoption.
2.2 Architecture of J-standard CALEA Sys-
tems
TSP subscribers (regardless of whether they are a wire-
tap target) interface with the TSP through a collection of
network elements (e.g. telephone switches, home location
registers) which together form the TSPs network. Each ele-
ment is responsible for interpreting certain customer actions
in order to provide service.
The J-standard mandates that some or all network ele-
ments be able to function as interception access points (IAPs)
when authorized by a wiretap order. As shown in Figure 1,
each IAP feeds information into a Delivery Function (DF),
also located inside the TSP. IAPs forward call-identifying
information and optionally, call content, to the DF. The
DF serves as an aggregation point for the various IAPs and
transfers call-identifying information and (when authorized)
514calls, loss of LAESP messages may therefore cause recording
equipment at the LEA to fail to capture call content.
2.3 Lawfully Authorized Electronic Surveillance
Protocol (LAESP)
The J-standard speciﬁes the semantics and wire format
of the Lawfully Authorized Electronic Surveillance Protocol
(LAESP) used to convey call-identifying information over
the CDC. Like many telecommunications protocols, LAESP
is deﬁned using ASN.1 [18] notation, allowing a human-
readable description to be compiled into routines for un-
ambiguously marshalling of messages across a network. The
J-standard deﬁnes 17 LAESP message types (summarized in
Table 1), corresponding to classes of both high-level network
events and low-level subject/network signals.
Due to the generality of the J-standard, LAESP messages
contain “conditional” ﬁelds for parameters which are only
present in certain technologies (e.g., IMSI for ISDN, ESN
for wireless, or IP for VoIP), as well as variable-length ﬁelds
ﬁlled in with human-readable strings for identifying equip-
ment or locations. The size of a particular LAESP message
can vary signiﬁcantly based on the technology being moni-
tored and the policies of the TSP performing the collection.
3. VULNERABILITIES IN THE J-STANDARD
The architecture of the J-standard is a poor ﬁt for many
current (and emerging) communications services. The evolved
protocols no longer cleanly separate authoritative network
signaling events from captured content (thereby moving away
from one of the apparent original design goals of the system),
and bandwidth is provisioned according to assumptions that
no longer hold true. In this section, we show how these de-
ﬁciencies can be exploited in practice by wiretap targets to
suppress or inject uncertainty into the data stream delivered
to law enforcement. The result is that targets subscribed to
many of the most commonly wiretapped services (such as
cellular telephones) can eﬀectively prevent accurate records
from being delivered to law enforcement, often without the
possibility of detection.
Unlike more traditional eavesdropping countermeasures
(in particular, encryption), the attacks identiﬁed in this sec-
tion may be unilaterally deployed by the wiretap subject and
do not require the participation of the other communicating
party. Moreover, the attacks prevent not only call content
from being recorded (in the case of call-content wiretaps),
they additionally prevent accurate call records from being
delivered to law enforcement, often without the possibility
of detection. That is, unlike encryption that may be used
to obfuscate the content of calls, the techniques described
in this section may be used to additionally hide call records
(who called whom and when) from wiretap transcripts.
Law enforcement agencies (and their vendors) do not,
as a rule, reveal the precise equipment and conﬁgurations
used to conduct wiretaps. Therefore, we did not attempt
to test these attacks against speciﬁc implementations of the
CALEA standards. Instead, we conducted experiments on
various telecommunications services that we modeled as be-
ing wiretapped with the most generous (to law enforcement)
CALEA conﬁgurations recommended in the J-standard. Our
analytical and experimental results conservatively assume
that wiretap systems are provisioned with the maximum re-
sources described by the standard (i.e., a full T1 line be-
tween the TSP and the LEA). It is worth emphasizing that

tap subject with mobile, analog wireline, and ISDN
services. The J-STD-025 standard covers the inter-
face between the Delivery Function (DF) and the
Collection Function (CF).
call content to a Collection Function (CF) located at the
LEA.
The J-standard deﬁnes the interfaces between the DF
and the CF. Call-identifying information is transmitted us-
ing the Lawfully Authorized Electronic Surveillance Protocol
(LAESP), a message-based protocol that encodes actions
taken by the TSP or the wiretap subject. (LAESP is de-
scribed in detail in the following section.) LAESP messages
are transmitted via a unidirectional (and somewhat confus-
ingly named) call data channel (CDC) between the DF and
CF. Importantly, LAESP messages from multiple wiretap
orders may be multiplexed on the same CDC.
The CDC conveys call-identifying information for both
pen register and content wiretaps.
In the latter case, the
DF also relays call content over one or more call content
channels (CCCs). Each CCC is dedicated to relaying a par-
ticular bearer service (e.g., voice, packet data, etc.) for a
single wiretap order between the TSP and the LEA. CCCs
carry verbatim (i.e., unedited) copies of the wiretap sub-
ject’s communications. The number of CCCs is determined
by the LEA. CCCs may either be separated, conveying in-
bound (towards the subject) and outbound (away from the
subject) traﬃc using separate channels, or combined, relay-
ing bidirectional traﬃc on a single channel.
In particular, we note the following properties of the J-
standard: (a) The J-standard requires neither reliable com-
munication between the DF and CF nor the use of integrity
checks for LAESP messages. Congestion on the CDC may
therefore lead to message corruption and/or loss. (b) Since
LAESP messages do not contain sequence numbers, mes-
sage loss may be undetected by the LEA. (c) Furthermore,
since LAESP messages delineate the beginning and end of

since the discovered vulnerabilities arise from the architec-
tural design described by the Standard rather than from
any particular implementation defect, any CALEA system
and conﬁguration that abides by the J-standard would be at
least as vulnerable as our experiments and analyses suggest.
3.1 Call Data Channel (CDC) Resource Ex-
haustion
The Call Data Channel (CDC) transmits call-identifying
information for pen register and content wiretaps from the
Telephone Service Provider (TSP) to the Law Enforcement
Agency (LEA).
The engineering aspects of the CDC do not appear to have
been well explored either within the J-standard or in the
public literature. J-STD-025-B contains a 24 page annex on
proper CCC delivery, while the corresponding CDC annex is
less than two pages. Neither determining adequate CDC ca-
pacity nor the potential consequences of an improperly pro-
visioned CDC are included in the J-standard or its annexes.
Additionally, although the capacity of the CDC between the
telecommunications service provider (TSP) and law enforce-
ment agency (LEA) is a variable which can be conﬁgured
on a per-wiretap basis, the critical internal provisioning of
a TSP’s network for routing CDC messages to the Delivery
Function (DF) is far more diﬃcult to change.4 While provi-
sioning resources for the average case or based upon statis-
tical traﬃc models of normal communication patterns may
be suﬃcient if the target does not apply any countermea-
sures, a motivated wiretap subject (or any slightly paranoid
individual) need not conform to the TSP’s average customer
proﬁle.
Of particular concern, the “preferred” and highest band-
width CDC conﬁguration in the J-standard is a single ISDN
B channel (64 kbps). When congestion occurs on the CDC,
there is no preemption or notiﬁcation – messages are silently
dropped. While 64 kbps may be suﬃcient for “average” voice
signaling traﬃc volumes, modern services allow the subject
to generate events at a rate that will greatly exceed this,
especially after they are encoded under LAESP. This, as we
will see, provides a rich vector for attack on both the CDC
and the CCC.
The CDC as currently designed is a low-bandwidth, un-
4The J-standard speciﬁes only that this internal capacity be
“adequate”, while similar CALEA standards specify band-
width resources allocated based on “statistical call mod-
els” [22].
reliable, heavily multiplexed resource. All call-identifying
information generated by intercept access points (IAPs) are
transmitted via the same CDC to the LEA on a ﬁrst-come-
ﬁrst-serve non-queued basis, allowing a single IAP element
to consume the entire channel. If the CDC is occupied when
an IAP needs to relay signaling information, the LAESP
message is dropped without notiﬁcation or retry. A single
CDC is used between the DF and the LEA for a given wire-
tap, and this CDC may be further shared by other wiretaps
between the same TSP and LEA.
At the time the J-standard was ﬁrst developed, the tech-
nological landscape was relatively homogeneous. However,
in modern networks, the same CDC may carry call-identifying
information for voice calls, IP data, and SMS messaging.
Because messages on the CDC come from so many sources
and can relate to diﬀerent investigations, a signiﬁcant over-
head of descriptive information is required which would not
necessarily be needed on a less heavily shared channel.
