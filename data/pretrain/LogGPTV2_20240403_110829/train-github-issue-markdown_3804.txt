Hello,

I have the following code structure:

```php
interface FooInterface {}
abstract class AbstractBar implements FooInterface {}
class Baz extends AbstractBar {}

$object = new Baz();
$validator->validate($object, null, ['validator_group']);
```

When I define a constraint on `AbstractBar` in my configuration like this:

```yaml
AbstractBar:
    constraints:
        - MyConstraint:
            groups: [validator_group]
```

The `MyConstraint` is called once, as expected. However, if I change the configuration to apply the constraint to `FooInterface` instead, like this:

```yaml
FooInterface:
    constraints:
        - MyConstraint:
            groups: [validator_group]
```

`MyConstraint` is called twice. 

I am unable to determine the reason for this behavior. Could someone please help me understand why this is happening?

Thank you.
