### Issue with Displaying MIME Data using Python (2.6) CGI on Windows (Apache)

I encountered a problem while attempting to display MIME data, such as an image, using Python 2.6 and CGI on a Windows system (Apache). Below is the code I used:

#### `image.py`

```python
#!E:/program files/Python26/python.exe
# -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-
data = open('logo.png', 'rb').read()
print 'Content-Type: image/png'
print 'Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=logo.png'
print
print data
```

However, this code does not work correctly on Windows XP or 7 with Apache or IIS. The output data appears to be corrupted, especially in the first few lines.

Interestingly, the same code works perfectly fine on a Linux system with Apache:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-
data = open('logo.png', 'rb').read()
print 'Content-Type: image/png'
print 'Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=logo.png'
print
print data
```

### Solution

After some investigation, I found the solution for both Windows + IIS and Windows + Apache setups.

#### For Windows + IIS:
When adding the application mapping in IIS, use the following command:
```sh
C:\Python20\python.exe -u %s %s
```
Previously, I was using:
```sh
c:\Python26\python.exe %s %s
```
The `-u` flag ensures unbuffered binary stdout and stderr, which is crucial for correct MIME data transmission.

#### For Windows + Apache:
Add the following line at the beginning of your Python script:
```python
#!E:/program files/Python26/python.exe -u
```

This change ensures that the script runs with unbuffered output, which resolves the issue with the corrupted MIME data.
