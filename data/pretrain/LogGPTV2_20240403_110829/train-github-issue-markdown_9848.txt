### Problem
After upgrading the DependencyInjection component from 2.0.14 to 2.0.15 the
file **services-1.0.xsd** is missing. That generates a xml error:
    [WARNING 1549] failed to load external entity "file:////usr/local/zend/share/pear/Symfony/Component/DependencyInjection/Loader/schema/dic/services/services-1.0.xsd" (in n/a - line 0, column 0)
    [WARNING 3084] Element '{http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema}import': Failed to locate a schema at location 'file:////usr/local/zend/share/pear/Symfony/Component/DependencyInjection/Loader/schema/dic/services/services-1.0.xsd'. Skipping the import. (in in_memory_buffer - line 8, column 0)
    [ERROR 1845] Element '{http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services}container': No matching global declaration available for the validation root. (in /home/luis/Zend/workspaces/luis/pleno-integra/config/dic.xml - line 4, column 0)
### Possible cause
Looking at the **package.xml** of both versions, I saw that the role of that
file was changed from **php** to **doc** :
#### 2.0.14
#### 2.0.15
