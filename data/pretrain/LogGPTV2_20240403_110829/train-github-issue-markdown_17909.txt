    function foo()
        try
            error("error in foo")
        catch e
        end
    end
    function bar()
        try
            error("error in bar")
        catch e
            foo()
            rethrow(e)
        end
    end
    bar()
produces the misleading
    ERROR: error in bar
    Stacktrace:
     [1] foo() at ./REPL[1]:3
     [2] bar() at ./REPL[2]:5
This just hit me in a really wicked situation: The stacktrace actually lead me
to a line erroneously throwing the reported exception. I fixed it (to throw
the correct exception), but the same error kept showing, leaving me completely
puzzled for quite some time...
