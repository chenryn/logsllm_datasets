User: Using only a mapper (a Python script) and no reducer, how can I output a separate file with the key as the filename, for each line of output, rather than having long files of output?
Assistant: Is it possible to replace the outputFormatClass, when using streaming?
In a native Java implementation you would extend the MultipleTextOutputFormat class and modify the method that names the output file. Then define your implementation as new outputformat with JobConf's setOutputFormat method
you should verify, if this is possible in streaming too. I donno :-/
