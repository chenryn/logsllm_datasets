**Anatomy of Drug Testing**

### Legal Framework
- **Scheduling:**
  - **Purpose:** The scheduling system classifies drugs based on their potential for abuse, medical use, and safety.
  - **Schedule I:** Drugs with no accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse (e.g., heroin, LSD).
  - **Schedule II:** Drugs with some accepted medical use but a high potential for abuse (e.g., oxycodone, methamphetamine).
  - **Schedules III/IV:** Drugs with lower potential for abuse and accepted medical uses (e.g., anabolic steroids, benzodiazepines).

- **Regulatory Bodies:**
  - **Department of Transportation (DOT):** Regulates drug testing for safety-sensitive positions in transportation.
  - **Chain of Custody (COC):** Ensures the integrity and security of the sample from collection to analysis.
  - **Securing the Location:** Ensures the collection site is secure and private.
  - **Breath Alcohol Technician (BAT):** Conducts breath alcohol tests.
  - **Collection Sites:** Locations where samples are collected, which can be police stations or hospitals.

### Methodologies
- **Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) and Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA):** Used for initial screening.
- **Spectrophotometry:** Measures the amount of light absorbed or transmitted by a substance.
- **Chemiluminescence:** Detects substances through light emission.
- **Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS):** Highly accurate method for confirming the presence of specific substances.
- **Breathalyzer:** Measures alcohol concentration in the breath.

### Sample Types
- **Hair:** Provides a long-term history of drug use.
- **Urine:** Commonly used for routine drug testing.
- **Blood:** Provides the most accurate and immediate results.
- **Stool:** Rarely used but can detect certain substances.
- **Meconium:** Used to test for prenatal exposure to drugs.
- **Breath:** Used primarily for alcohol testing.
- **Body Tissues/Fluids:** Can include saliva, sweat, and other bodily fluids.
