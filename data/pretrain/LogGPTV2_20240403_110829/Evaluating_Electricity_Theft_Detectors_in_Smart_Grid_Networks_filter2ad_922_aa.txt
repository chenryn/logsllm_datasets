Abstract. Electricity theft is estimated to cost billions of dollars per
year in many countries. To reduce electricity theft, electric utilities are
leveraging data collected by the new Advanced Metering Infrastructure
(AMI) and using data analytics to identify abnormal consumption trends
and possible fraud. In this paper, we propose the ﬁrst threat model for the
use of data analytics in detecting electricity theft, and a new metric that
leverages this threat model in order to evaluate and compare anomaly
detectors. We use real data from an AMI system to validate our approach.

Introduction
The smart grid refers to the modernization of the power grid infrastructure with
new technologies, enabling a more intelligently networked automated system
with the goal of improving eﬃciency, reliability, and security, while providing
more transparency and choices to electricity consumers. One of the key tech-
nologies being deployed currently around the globe is the Advanced Metering
Infrastructure (AMI).
AMI refers to the modernization of the electricity metering system by replac-
ing old mechanical meters by smart meters. Smart meters are new embedded
devices that provide two-way communications between utilities and consumers,
thus eliminating the need to send personnel to read the meters on site, and
providing a range of new capabilities, such as, the ability to monitor electric-
ity consumption throughout the network with ﬁner granularity, faster diagnosis
of outage—with analog meters, utilities learned of outages primarily by con-
sumer call complaints—automated power restoration, remote disconnect, and
the ability to send information such as dynamic pricing or the source of elec-
tricity (renewable or not) to consumers, giving consumers more—and easier to
access—information about their energy use.
Smart meters are, by necessity, billions of low-cost commodity devices, with
an operational lifetime of several decades and operating in physically insecure
locations [16]. Hardening these devices by adding hardware co-processors and
tamper resilient memory might increase the price of smart meters by a few
dollars, and because utilities have to deploy millions of devices, the reality of the

market is that these additions are not considered cost-eﬀective in practice, and
are not even recommended as a priority [21].
Therefore, while some basic protective measures have been developed (tamper-
evident seals, secure link communications), they are not enough to prevent suc-
cessful attacks during the meter lifespan. In addition to vulnerabilities identiﬁed
by security researchers [17,9]—some of them allowing rogue remote ﬁrmware
updates [20]—hacked smart meters have been used to steal electricity, costing a
single U.S. electric utility hundreds of millions of dollars annually, as reported
by a cyber-intelligence bulletin issued by the FBI [14]. The FBI report warns
that insiders and individuals with only a moderate level of computer knowledge
are likely able to compromise and reprogram meters with low-cost tools and
software readily available on the Internet. The FBI report also assesses with
medium conﬁdence that as smart grid use continues to spread throughout the
country, this type of fraud will also spread because of the ease of intrusion and
the economic beneﬁt to both the hacker and the electric customer.
Detecting electricity theft has traditionally been addressed by physical checks
of tamper-evident seals by ﬁeld personnel and by using balance meters [10].
While valuable, these techniques alone are not enough. Tamper evident seals
can be easily defeated [5] and balance meters can detect that some of the cus-
tomers connected to it are misbehaving, but cannot identify exactly who they
are. Despite the vulnerabilities of smart meters, the high-resolution data they
collect is seen as a promising technology to improve electricity-theft detection.
In general, utilities are gathering more data from many devices and they are
leveraging big data analytics [15] to obtain better situational awareness of the
health of their system. One of the key services oﬀered by Meter Data Manage-
ment (MDM) vendors for turning big data into actionable information is called
revenue assurance, where data analytics software is used by the utility on the
collected meter data to identify possible electricity theft situations and abnor-
mal consumption trends [13]. Big data analytics is thus a new cost-eﬀective way
to complement the use of balance meters (which are still necessary to detect
when electricity thieves connect directly to the power distribution lines instead
of tampering with the meter) and physical personnel checking for tamper-evident
seals.
In this paper we focus on the problem of data analytics in MDM systems for
detecting electricity theft. While some MDM vendors are already oﬀering this
functionality, their methods and algorithms are not publicly available, so it is
impossible to evaluate the eﬀectiveness of these tests. In addition, the few papers
available on the topic have limitations [18,19,11,6]: (1) They do not consider a
threat model, and therefore, it is not clear how the detection algorithm will
work against sophisticated attackers, (2) they have lower resolution data, and
therefore they tend to focus on nonparametric statistics, instead of leveraging
advanced signal processing algorithms, and (3) they assume a dataset of attack
examples to test the accuracy of the classiﬁers, and therefore the evaluation will
be biased depending on how easy it is to detect attacks available in the database,
and the eﬀectiveness of the classiﬁer will be unknown to unseen attacks.

In this paper we make the following contributions: (1) We introduce an at-
tacker model for anomaly detectors in MDM systems. Previous work never as-
sumed an intelligent attacker and therefore might have easily been evaded by an
advanced attacker. This threat model is particularly important in digital meters,
as an attacker with access to a tampered meter can send an arbitrary ﬁne-grained
attack signal with a precision that was not previously available with mechani-
cal attacks to meters (such as using powerful magnets to aﬀect the metrology
unit). (2) We introduce a new metric for evaluating the classiﬁcation accuracy
of anomaly detectors. This new metric takes into consideration some of the fun-
damental problems in anomaly detection when applied to security problems: (a)
the fact that attack examples in a dataset might not be representative of fu-
ture attacks (and thus a classiﬁer trained with such attack data might not be
able to detect new smart attacks), and (b) in many cases it is hard to get at-
tack data for academic studies—this is particularly true for SCADA data and
data from sensor and actuators in industrial or power grid systems—therefore
we argue that we have to avoid training and evaluating classiﬁers with imbal-
anced and unrepresentative datasets. (3) Using real AMI data (6 months of 15
minute reading-interval for 108 consumers) provided by an utility, we evalu-
ate the performance of electricity-theft detection algorithms, including a novel
ARMA-GLR detector designed with the goal of capturing an attack invariant
(reducing electricity bill) in the formal model of composite hypothesis testing.
2 Evaluation of Classiﬁers in Adversarial Environments
In this section we describe a new general way of evaluating classiﬁers in adver-
sarial environments. Because this framework can be used for other problems,
we introduce the model in a general classiﬁcation setting. We focus on two top-
ics: (1) adversarial classiﬁcation, or how to evaluate the eﬀectiveness of a
classiﬁer when the attacker can create undetected attacks, and (2) adversarial
learning, or how to prevent an attacker from providing false data to our learning
algorithm.
2.1 Adversarial Classiﬁcation
In machine learning, classiﬁers are traditionally evaluated based on a testing
dataset containing examples of the negative (normal) class and the positive
(attack) class. However, in adversarial environments there are many practical
situations where we cannot obtain examples of the attack class a priori. There
are two main reasons for this: (1) by deﬁnition, we cannot obtain examples of
zero-day attacks, and (2) using attack examples which are generated indepen-
dently of the classiﬁer implicitly assumes that the attacker is not adaptive and
will not try to evade our detection mechanism.
In this paper we argue that instead of using a set of attack samples for evalu-
ating classiﬁers, we need to ﬁnd the worst possible attack for each classiﬁer and
evaluate the classiﬁer by considering the costs of this worst-case attack.

Model and Assumptions: We model the problem of evaluating classiﬁers by
generating worst-case attack patterns as follows:
1. A random process generates observations x ∈ X . These observations are the
realization of a random vector X with distribution P0.
2. We assume x is only observed by a sensor (e.g., a smart meter), and the
sensor sends y to a classiﬁer. Thus while P0 is known to the world, the
speciﬁc sample x is only known to the sensor.
3. The sensor can be in one of two states (1) honest, or (2) compromised. If the
sensor is honest, then y = x. If the sensor is dishonest, then y = h(x), where
h : X → X is a function such that the inferred probability distribution P1 for
Y satisﬁes a Relation (the attacker intent): g(X) R g(Y ) (e.g., E[Y ]  0 is an unknown value and quantiﬁes how small will the attacker
select Eγ[Y ] (the expectation of Y under probability distribution pγ).
Given Y1, . . . , Yn, we need to determine what is more likely: is this time series
distributed according to p0, or pγ? To address this problem we prove the following
