# 5. Findings

This section presents our findings from the smart crawls, providing an overview of the collected data, an analysis of tracking across channels, and the effectiveness of tracking countermeasures. Additionally, we discuss the security properties and practices observed on the two Over-the-Top (OTT) platforms we studied.

## 5.1 Data and Crawl Overview

As summarized in Table 1, we used several metrics to evaluate the success of each crawl:

1. **Completed Channels**: We counted the number of channels that were successfully installed, interacted with, and then uninstalled by our crawler. Some channels may fail during installation or launch due to issues such as network problems.
2. **Video Playback Reach**: We counted the number of channels for which our smart crawler was able to reach video playback using the remote control API. Complex interfaces, such as those requiring account logins, may prevent video playback.
3. **Unique Domains Contacted**: We counted the number of unique domains contacted by all channels during the crawl. This metric indicates the range of endpoints the device contacted.

These metrics provide a basis for validating the different crawls, each with varying parameters, on the same channel list.

### Key Observations
1. **TLS Interception Impact**: On both Roku and Amazon Fire TV, the success rates of crawls with and without TLS interception were similar, indicating that our TLS interception does not disrupt channel functionality.
2. **Consistent Video Playback Rates**: The video playback rates in our crawls are consistent with our initial experiments detailed in Section 3.2.2.

## 5.2 Tracker Prevalence

We analyzed the trackers contacted by Roku and Amazon Fire TV channels using data from the Roku-Top1K-MITM and FireTV-Top1K-MITM crawls. For brevity, we refer to tracking domains as "trackers."

### 5.2.1 Most Common Trackers
Table 2 lists the top 10 trackers in order of prevalence across all channels in the Roku-Top1K-MITM and FireTV-Top1K-MITM crawls.

**Roku Channels:**
- **doubleclick.net** (Google-owned) was the most prevalent, appearing in 975 out of 1,000 channels.
- Other common trackers include **google-analytics.com**, **scorecardresearch.com**, and **spotxchange.com**.

**Amazon Fire TV Channels:**
- **amazon-adsystem.com** was the most prevalent, appearing in 687 out of 1,000 channels.
- Other common trackers include **crashlytics.com**, **doubleclick.net**, and **google-analytics.com**.

### 5.2.2 Channels with the Most Trackers
To further examine tracker distribution, we analyzed their presence across channel categories and ranks. Figures 5a and 5b illustrate this distribution for Roku and Amazon Fire TV channels, respectively. Tables 3 and 4 list the top 10 channels based on the number of trackers they contact.

- **Roku Channels**: The "Games" category contains the most trackers, with 9 of the top 10 channels being games published by StuffWeLike.
- **Amazon Fire TV Channels**: Five of the top 10 channels with the most trackers are "News" channels, with the top three contacting nearly 60 tracker domains each.

This suggests that tracking behavior varies by channel category, and users of certain categories are more susceptible to tracking.

## 5.3 Identifier and Information Leakage

We investigated the information collected by the domains contacted by the channels in our dataset. This analysis reveals the behavior of existing and potentially new, previously unknown trackers.

### 5.3.1 Identifiers and Information Leaked
Table 5 lists the possible identifiers and information that trackers could collect about users. We searched for these identifiers in the HTTP traffic from the Roku-Top1K-MITM and FireTV-Top1K-MITM crawls, including URL-encoded, Base64-encoded, and hashed IDs.

- **Roku**: 4,452 of the 6,142 (73%) requests containing unique IDs (AD ID, Serial Number) are flagged as trackers.
- **Amazon Fire TV**: 3,427 of the 8,433 (41%) unique identifiers are sent in cleartext.

### 5.3.2 Cross-Device Tracking
To understand the implications of subscription services, we manually crawled 30 channels on both platforms. We found:
- Four channels (two on each platform) share the email address used for account creation with third-party trackers on the web.
- One Amazon channel shares the zip code with a third-party on the web.
- For each channel, tracking domains contacted both on the web (during registration or sign-in) and by the device can track users across web and OTT. On Roku, 4 channels had overlapping tracking domains, while on Amazon, 7 channels did.

### 5.3.3 Detecting New Tracking Domains
We used automated processing and manual false positive removal to detect previously unknown trackers. We built a list of domains that received unique identifiers, such as AD ID and Serial Number, and analyzed their behavior.

Table 6 provides an overview of the identifier and information leakage detected in the Roku-Top1K-MITM and FireTV-Top1K-MITM crawls, excluding leaks to platform domains (roku.com and amazon.com).

By combining these findings, we gain a comprehensive understanding of the tracking landscape on OTT platforms and the potential risks to user privacy.
