Today, I updated to version 0.10.10, hoping to try out the new JavaScript support with Salsa. Unfortunately, after the update, my Intellisense has stopped working properly. I am using type definition files from DefinitelyTyped (e.g., `express.d.ts`).

For example, in version 0.10.8, when I use the following code:

```javascript
var exp = require("express");
exp.Router;
```

I would see content assist for the "Router" function, and I could navigate to the definition file by right-clicking on "Router" and selecting "Go to Definition."

However, in version 0.10.10, "Router" no longer appears in the Intellisense list. Additionally, the list now includes variables that I defined earlier in my code, which are not relevant to the `express` module.

Could you please help me resolve this issue?
