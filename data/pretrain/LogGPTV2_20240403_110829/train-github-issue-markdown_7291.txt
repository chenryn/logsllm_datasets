I updated to 0.10.10 today, hoping to try out the new JavaScript support with
Salsa. Unfortunately, my Intellisense has stopped working. I am using type
definition files from definitely typed (e.g. the express.d.ts).
For example, using 0.10.8:
var exp = require("express");  
exp.Router
I will see the content assist for the "Router" function and I can visit the
definition file by right clicking on "Router" > Go to Definition
Now when I do the same thing in 0.10.10, I don't see "Router" in the
Intellisense list. In addition, the list seems to have variables I had defined
earlier in my code (which doesn't apply to express at all).
