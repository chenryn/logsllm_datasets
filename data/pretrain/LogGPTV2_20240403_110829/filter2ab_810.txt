**Title: Black Hat Asia 2022 - SMS PVA Services Fueled by Compromised Supply-Chain Mobile Botnets**

During our investigation of an SMS PVA (Phone Verification Automation) service provider, we uncovered a mobile botnet that was being used to provide SMS reception services. Our analysis revealed that the botnet had active devices in dozens of countries, with tens of thousands of devices operational at any given time. The majority of these devices were infected through a compromised supply chain, meaning that users unknowingly received pre-infected smartphones when they purchased new devices.

In this presentation, we will delve into the modus operandi of the SMS PVA service provider, examining the design and operations of the discovered botnet. We will also explore how other threat actors have utilized and misused these PVA services. Additionally, we will discuss the methods by which the devices were likely infected before being delivered to end users, shedding light on the vulnerabilities within the supply chain.

This comprehensive overview aims to provide a deeper understanding of the security risks associated with compromised supply chains and the broader implications for the cybersecurity landscape.
