title:blackhat:asia-22 SMS PVA Services Fueled by Compromised Supply-Chain Mobile Botnets
During our investigation of an SMS PVA service provider, we uncovered a mobile botnet that was used to provide SMS reception services. Whilst examining it, the botnet has active devices in dozens of countries with tens of thousands of active devices at any point in time. The devices within this botnet were mainly infected through a compromised supply chain. This means that the users of the newly acquired devices were getting pre-infected handphones when they purchased them. This presentation dives into the modus operandi of this SMS PVA service provider, discusses the design and operations of the uncovered botnet as well as the use and misuse of the PVA services by other threat actors. We will also discuss how the devices were possibly infected before being delivered to end users.
