User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Execute command over SSH while logging live output I'm trying to log the output of a remote ssh command.

I'm current using

ssh USER@IP | tee -a ~/random.log

and then run the command I need to run on the remote server which then logs to random.log.

I need this to be able to run in the background, currently it exits when I quit/close terminal.

I cannot log on the remote server as it is a router with very little free space (>800kb).

Assistant: You can use screen on the local machine as well, to prevent stopping the exit if you close your terminal window. 

screen


and in the screen session, 

ssh USER@IP | tee -a ~/random.log


If you accidentally close the window, just use screen -r to reattach. Note that this will not survive a reboot of your local machine.
