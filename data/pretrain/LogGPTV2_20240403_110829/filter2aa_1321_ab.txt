The pseudo random DNS label prefix attack is 
designed to cause resource starvation of DNS 
servers.  If this attack would be launched against an 
internal recursive DNS server, it would quickly 
result in the DNS server using up all its resources.  
This would then impact all network services which 
depend on DNS resolution, including web traffic, 
!
!
network based services and potentially IP telephony 
services as those often use DNS for translating 
numbers to Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI).  
The attack traffic for the flooding and reflection 
attacks will be generated as quickly as possible, 
potentially reaching high packet-per-second rates 
very quickly. A typical low end IoT device using a 
CPU similar to what is used in the Raspberry Pi 
computers can generate up to 8,000 packets per 
second which is enough to fill a 100Mbit link with 
large packets.  A more powerful IoT device, for 
example an Internet connected HD network camera, 
can easily saturate a Gigabit Ethernet link with 
traffic. 
A DDoS attack launched using internally based IoT 
devices could therefore potentially result in a flood 
of packets reaching Gigabit throughput.  This 
malicious traffic will have to traverse the internal 
network on its way to its target on the Internet, 
sometimes traversing internal WAN links and 
traversing devices which are in many cases not 
capable of forwarding such high volumes of traffic.  
This could then lead to network outages, both on 
internal WAN/LAN links but also on external links 
due to the high traffic volume. 
In addition, if the attack would use the infected IoT 
devices to launch DDoS attacks against internal 
targets, the impact could potentially be very high as 
most Enterprises do not protect internal resources 
against high-volume DDoS attacks originating from 
the inside. 
9 How to Mitigate this New Threat 
!
Defending against DDoS attacks from the internet 
is not trivial, especially if the network defenses are 
not secured properly to withstand such attacks.  A 
well architected multi-layer design using Intelligent 
DDoS Mitigation Systems (IDMS) is capable of 
withstanding almost any kind of DDoS attack.  
However, such defenses are, in almost all cases, 
focused on defending against external attacks, not 
from attacks originating from the inside. 
This new threat vector means that the network 
security designer will have to design the network to 
be resistant against attacks from both the inside and 
the outside.  Also, care has to be taken to harden the 
network against collateral damage from scanning 
activities and the sheer volume of potential attack 
traffic traversing the network.

Interestingly, most Internet Service Providers have 
been doing this successfully for more than 20 years 
and there is considerable amount of Security Best 
Current Practices available which can help the 
network security administrator to properly secure 
his network. 
Among those are: 
• 
Cisco Systems (equivalent functionality is 
provided in network infrastructure devices 
from other vendors): 
o Service Provider Security Best practices2 
o Router Security Strategies3 
• 
Arbor Networks: 
o Collection of security BCPs4 
• 
NANOG: 
o An Architecture for Automatically 
Detecting, Isolating, and Cleaning 
Infected Hosts5 
The information available is very comprehensive so 
a summary of the main phases for dealing with 
attacks are listed below: 
1. Preparation: Prepare and harden the network 
against attack 
2. Identification: Identify that an attack is taking 
place 
3. Classification: Classify the attack 
4. Traceback: Where is the attack coming from 
5. Reaction: Use the best tool based on the 
information gathered from the Identification, 
Classification and Traceback phases to mitigate 
the attack 
6. Post-mortem: Learn from what happened, 
improve defenses against future attacks. 
One of the most important aspects of successful 
network defense are visibility and understanding 
what is going on.  Without enough information, any 
kind of reaction has the potential to cause more 
harm than good.   A well-known quote from Sun 
Tzu explains this very well: 
“If you know the enemy and know 
yourself, you need not fear the result of a 
hundred battles. If you know yourself but 
not the enemy, for every victory gained 
you will also suffer a defeat. If you know 
neither the enemy nor yourself, you will 
succumb in every battle.” 
The most important priority during attack is to keep 
the network up and running.  If the network is 
down, no traffic will be able to traverse the 
network.

A brief overview of the most relevant security tasks 
is provided in the following sections. 
10 Mitigating Collateral Damage from 
Scanning Activity 
!
As explained earlier, a network of compromised 
IoT devices and Trojans will see high levels of 
scanning activity.  The scanning itself is not 
deliberately malicious but due to the high scanning 
volume, it can result in collateral damage on 
network devices like switches, routers and 
firewalls. 
To mitigating the impact of scanning activity, the 
following tasks should be implemented: 
• 
Segment the network such that devices with 
similar services/control are kept in their own 
segments. 
• 
Implement IP source guard and DHCP 
snooping to block devices from masquerading 
as other hosts using spoofed source IP 
addresses. 
• 
Only allow host devices and servers to 
communicate with the default gateway using 
Private VLANs thereby blocking the ARP 
packets from being seen by other devices on 
the same network segment.   
• 
Implement “storm control” on the network 
devices to stop floods of packets. 
• 
Implement the appropriate Control Plane 
Policing (CoPP) policies on network devices. If 
done properly, scanning activity with not 
impact the network devices. 
• 
Use infrastructure Access Control Lists 
(iACLs) to control the flow of traffic between 
devices on the same network segment and 
between networks.  Care has to be taken not to 
use stateful devices for this purpose as they 
have a tendency to collapse under heavy load, 
especially if a lot of small packets are being 
transmitted or if a DDoS attack is being 
launched from inside the network. 
11 Blocking Trojan and Bot Infection 
Vectors 
!
Both the Trojan and the Mirai IoT bot use network 
scanning to detect devices to attack.  The Trojan 
uses brute force login attacks against Microsoft 
SQL servers, MySQL server and RDP with the goal 
of gaining administrative privileges on the target 
computer.  Both the Trojan and the Mirai IoT bots 
scan for devices on TCP ports 22 (SSH), 23 
(Telnet), 5555 and 7547 (TR-069 SOAP 
management) and will use brute for login attacks 
against SSH and Telnet and exploiting a known 
vulnerability against TR-069 configuration 
protocol. 
To mitigate these activities: 
• 
Implement network segmentation to separate 
IoT devices and client computers into separate 
network segments; additionally, each group of 
IoT devices should be grouped into their own 
segments.   
• 
Implement strict control of network traffic to 
and from the individual network segments.  
These controls should be implemented using 
non-stateful controls like iACLs. 
• 
Only allow client devices and IoT devices to 
communicate with their default gateway, no 
inter communication should be allowed. One 
example of such controls is Private VLAN. 
• 
Wherever possible, separate Management 
traffic from data traffic and only allow 
management traffic originating from a specific 
set of IP ranges. 
Coming back to our castle scenario, a well-designed 
castle had multiple layers of castle walls, with 
guards monitoring external and internal activities. 
12 Mitigating the Impact of DDoS 
Attacks Launched from the Inside 
!
A DDoS attack launched using IoT devices located 
on the inside of an enterprise network will cause 
very high traffic volumes, measured in both 
Bandwidth and packets-per-second.  Even if the 
attack is destined towards external targets, the 
attack traffic will first have to traverse the internal 
network.  This can result in network link congestion 
on WAN and LAN segments and high CPU load on 
network devices, all potentially leading to network 
outages. 
To mitigate the impact of such attacks, the 
following should be implemented: 
• 
Implement flow telemetry (i.e., NetFlow, 
IPFIX, et. al.) export, collection, and analysis, 
along with collection and analysis of recursive 
DNS queries and responses. This will provide 
comprehensive visibility into network traffic 
and will quickly detect any abnormalities and 
internally launched DDoS attacks. 
• 
Implement Control Plane policing on all 
network devices. This will allow the network 
devices to withstand both direct attacks against 
the network elements and from having attack 
traffic traversing impacting the network device. 
• 
Secure Routing protocols against attacks and 
overload.  Without routing, no traffic can 
traverse the network. 
!
!
• 
Implement Management Plane Protection to 
secure and protect management traffic.  Also, 
reserve bandwidth and capacity on WAN and 
LAN links for management plane traffic. If you 
are not able to communicate with the network 
elements, the attack cannot be mitigated. 
• 
Implement Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding 
(uRPF) policing to drop spoofed packets, this 
will stop all DDoS reflection attacks. 
• 
Implement Data plane protection to filter and 
control what traffic should be allowed through 
the network.  Examples:  
o 
A DNS server farm should only 
receive DNS traffic.  
o 
Client computers should only 
communicate with specific services on 
specific ports, not each other. 
Data plane protection should be implemented 
using non-stateful controls like iACLs, stateful 
controls have to tendency to crash and burn 
during heavy attacks. 
• 
Do not trust any Quality-of-service tags made 
by clients, downgrade those such that 
management plane traffic has highest priority. 
• 
Implement Remote Triggered Blackhole 
(RTBH) and Source-based RTBH (sRTBH) 
mitigation on network devices to allow for 
mitigation of attacks based on destination and 
source address.  Properly implemented, 
RTBH/sRTBH are capable of stopping DDoS 
attacks with minimal impact to network 
devices. 
• 
Implement Flowspec on network devices to 
allow for granular mitigation of attack traffic. 
• 
Implement a quarantine system to isolate 
compromised devices.  By utilizing flow 
telemetry collection/analysis, recursive DNS 
collection/analysis, and other forms of 
detection and classification, make use of 
recursive DNS poisoning to implement a 
universal ‘soft’ quarantine, and both VLAN- 
and WiFi channel-based ‘hard’ quarantine 
mechanisms to isolate botted devices. 
13 Summary 
!
The Windows Mirai Seeder is a simple delivery 
vehicle for the more dangerous Mirai IoT bot.  
However, as it will infect computers inside the 
Internet firewall, the attack surface has expanded 
tremendously, allowing for the creation of even 
larger Mirai botnets that will consequently have the 
capability to cause inadvertent collateral damage 
and to launch DDoS attacks against internal 
devices. A situation which most enterprise 
networks are not prepared to defend against. 
A new threat scenario has emerged which has the 
potential to cause a myriad of issues in the future 
for networks with weak or non-existent defenses 
inside the corporate firewall. 
A network designed and secured using the security 
BCP’s described herein will be highly resistant to 
such compromise and the ramifications thereof. If 
one of your Windows systems becomes a traitor, it 
will not be able to subsume your innocent IoT 
population into an army of raving zombies…
