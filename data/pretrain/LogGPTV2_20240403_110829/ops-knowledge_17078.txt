User: Please list several common virtualization technologies and their application scenarios.
Assistant: 1. Containerization technology: Containerization technology can isolate different applications and services so that they can run on the same physical host, and can also utilize fewer resources than traditional virtualization, so it is especially suitable for cloud computing, continuous integration and Scenarios such as container orchestration. 2. Virtual machine technology: Virtual machine technology can create one or more virtual machines that actually look like hardware, so that multiple operating systems and applications can be isolated on the same physical host, so it is especially suitable for data centers, Scenarios such as disaster recovery and testing. 3. Network virtualization technology: Network virtualization technology can virtualize network resources into multiple virtual resources, thereby improving the utilization rate of network resources, enhancing the elasticity and manageability of the network, so it is especially suitable for data centers and cloud computing and Internet users business and other scenarios. 4. Storage virtualization technology: Storage virtualization technology can aggregate multiple physical storage devices into a centralized storage pool and abstract it into one or more virtual storage devices, thereby improving the utilization of storage resources and increasing The flexibility and manageability of storage make it especially suitable for scenarios such as data centers, cloud computing, and virtual desktops.
