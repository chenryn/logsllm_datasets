The August application logs a significant amount of sensitive data. With social engineering, or 
temporary access to the unlocked phone of an August user these logs can be extracted. The 
following procedure can be use to extract log data without the use of any special tools. 
Step 1: Open settings 
Step 2: Press and hold the application version number. 
Step 3: Enter "augustsupport" in the prompt. The prompt is case sensitive. ("DreadfulDow" can 
be used as well, but it permanently alters the app's settings.)  
Step 4: Tap send logs to August. 
Step 5: Change the destination to an email address you control. 
These logs which are ostensibly useful August support may include usernames, passwords, 
authentication tokens, offline keys, and firmware keys as shown in the following screenshot: 
Of note, the information extracted from log files by the above program is sufficient to not only 
interact with the lock, but also to bypass August's two step authentication system.
