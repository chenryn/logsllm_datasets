User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How do I delete the DMP files from Symantec Endpoint Protection's Data Install directory? I have Symantec Endpoint Protection on our server at the directory is full of 1GB DMP files going back 6 months, which has filled the server's disk.

I can't seem to be able to delete these files:



I've tried the following things without success


Stop all the Symantec services in Services ([as far as possible])2
Reboot
Use Unlocker to try and remove the files, even at next reboot

Assistant: I am Chetan Savade from Symantec Technical Support Team.

Could you try the following workaround.
