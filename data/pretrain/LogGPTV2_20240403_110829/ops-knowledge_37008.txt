Question: Consider a scenario where you are tasked with securing a banking application that currently allows users to perform transactions without any form of user authentication, exposing it to unauthorized access and fraud. Based on the principles of secure architecture and design, select the most appropriate measures to mitigate this risk.
"A": "Implement role-based access control by categorizing users as anonymous, normal, privileged, and administrative, and then require authentication for roles with access to sensitive operations.",
"B": "Use a custom authentication protocol for the primary communication channel and assume secondary channels are secure if the primary authentication is successful.",
"C": "Replicate any client-side security checks on the server side to prevent attackers from bypassing security controls by modifying client behavior.",
"D": "Avoid using established authentication frameworks or libraries, and instead create a custom authentication solution for each separate page or operation."
Answer: AC
