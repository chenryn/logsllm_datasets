User: How to install and configure the SSH service on the Linux system for remote login? Please provide the command and steps.
Assistant: The steps to install and configure the SSH service on the Linux system to realize remote login are as follows: 1. Install the SSH service. Open a terminal window and use the following command to install the SSH service: ``` sudo apt-get install openssh-server ``` 2. Configure the SSH service. By default, SSH will use port 22 as the default port. It is recommended to change to other ports to enhance security. Open the SSH configuration file and modify the port number: ``` sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config ``` Find Port 22 and modify it to a non-22 port. At the same time, you can configure other settings, such as disabling SSH root login, restricting login users, setting SSH password-free login, etc. For specific settings, please refer to relevant tutorials and materials. After modification, save and exit. 3. Restart the SSH service to make the modified configuration take effect. ``` sudo service ssh restart ``` 4. Firewall settings. If there is a firewall, you need to open the ports used in the firewall after configuring the SSH service. Take the Ubuntu system as an example, you can use the following command to open the port: ``` sudo ufw allow 2222/tcp ``` Here, it is assumed that the port used by the SSH service has been changed to 2222. Once installed and configured, you can use an SSH client to connect to a remote computer. You can use the following command to connect: ``` ssh username@ip_address -p port_number ``` Among them, username is the username on the remote computer, ip_address is the IP address of the remote computer, and port_number is the port number used by the SSH service. If SSH password-free login is set, you can directly connect to the remote computer, otherwise you need to enter a password to log in.
