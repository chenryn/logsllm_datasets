User: How to Harden the Security of the Linux System? Please list common reinforcement methods and methods, and explain their pros and cons and application scenarios.
Assistant: The security hardening of the Linux system needs to consider a variety of factors, including network security, file system security, access control, service management, etc. Common reinforcement means and methods include: 1. Configure firewall: the firewall can filter and control network traffic, which can better protect the network security of the system. Common firewalls include iptables and firewall, etc., which can be configured according to specific requirements. The advantage is that the configuration is more flexible, and fine control can be carried out according to the needs; the disadvantage is that it requires professional network knowledge, which is difficult for beginners to learn. 2. Close unnecessary services: In the Linux system, there are many unnecessary services that need to be closed according to the actual situation to reduce the attack surface of the system. You can use the command systemctl status to view the currently running services and shut them down as needed. The advantage is that it is simple and easy to implement, and can effectively reduce the attack surface of the system; the disadvantage is that it has high requirements on service dependence and operating environment, and improper shutdown will cause system abnormalities. 3. Modify the default password: After the Linux system is installed, the default password may be guessed by outsiders, and the password needs to be changed in time. You can use the command passwd to modify and set a strong password policy. The advantage is that it is simple and easy to operate, which can effectively improve the security of the system; the disadvantage is that the password needs to be changed regularly, which will increase the user's use cost. 4. Prohibit root remote login: root user has all system privileges by default, if hacked, it will pose a great threat to system security. You can edit the file /etc/ssh/sshd_config, find the PermitRootLogin item, and set it to no to prohibit the root user from logging in remotely. The advantage is that it can protect the security of the root user; the disadvantage is that the root user login needs to be restarted in an emergency. 5. Strengthen access control: Linux systems can use mechanisms such as ACL and SELinux to strengthen user access control, which can better protect system security. ACL can flexibly control access to files and directories, and can be set through the setfacl command; SELinux can restrict users' access to system resources and prevent attackers from moving laterally in the system. The advantage is that it can flexibly control access rights and improve system security; the disadvantage is that it needs a certain Linux technology foundation and may have a certain impact on system performance. In short, the security hardening of the Linux system needs to be comprehensively considered according to the actual situation, and an appropriate method should be adopted to strengthen it. Different reinforcement methods have their own advantages and disadvantages, and you need to choose the method that suits you in practical applications.
