To extract the pattern from the given log entry, you can use the following format:

**Pattern:**
```
attempt_\d{8}\d{4}_\d{6}_[a-z]_\d{6}:\ Committed
```

**Explanation:**
- `attempt_` is a fixed prefix.
- `\d{8}` represents the date in `YYYYMMDD` format (e.g., `20170609`).
- `\d{4}` represents the time in `HHMM` format (e.g., `2018`).
- `_` is a separator.
- `\d{6}` represents a sequence of six digits (e.g., `0024`, `000004`).
- `[a-z]` represents a single lowercase letter (e.g., `m`).
- `_` is another separator.
- `\d{6}` again represents a sequence of six digits (e.g., `1026`).
- `:\ Committed` is a fixed suffix.

This pattern will match entries like `attempt_201706092018_0024_m_000004_1026: Committed`.
