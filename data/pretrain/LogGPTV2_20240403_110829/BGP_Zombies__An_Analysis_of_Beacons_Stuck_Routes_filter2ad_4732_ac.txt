### Analysis of BGP Zombie Outbreaks and Their Relationship to Transit Networks

**Introduction:**
In our analysis, we found that 45% of IPv4 outbreaks involve between 1 and 6 Autonomous Systems (ASes). Through manual inspection, we identified specific patterns among these outbreaks. We hypothesize that the number of zombie ASes is often related to the importance of the transit networks affected by zombies.

**Methodology:**
To test this hypothesis, we selected the most prominent transit network affected by each outbreak using global AS hegemony, a measure of an AS's centrality in the Internet, with higher values indicating Tier-1 ISPs. By comparing the size of outbreaks to the highest AS hegemony score of affected ASes (Fig. 5b), we observed that small outbreaks typically involve only edge networks (low AS hegemony), while large transit networks are associated with the largest outbreaks.

**Case Studies:**
Figure 6 illustrates two notable outbreaks:
- **Figure 6a:** An outbreak where the zombie AS with the highest hegemony score is Init7, and all downstream ASes are also affected.
- **Figure 6b:** An outbreak involving a zombie in a Tier-1 network, Level(3). Due to Level(3)'s extensive customer cone, the scope of the outbreak is significantly larger, affecting about half of the RIS peers through Level(3).

**Transit Network Analysis:**
Table 2 lists the top 5 affected transit ASes for IPv4 and IPv6 across different measurement periods. The percentages represent the fraction of outbreaks that include each AS relative to the total number of outbreaks in the corresponding period.

- **IPv4:**
  - March/April 2017: Swisscom (46.13%), Fastweb (46.07%), MTS (9.93%)
  - October/December 2017: HE (14.84%), SURFnet (9.90%), DFN (9.18%)
  - July/August 2018: Elisa (9.90%), AARNet (9.38%), AT&T (19.81%)

- **IPv6:**
  - March/April 2017: Atom86 (39%), Init7 (39%), Hibernia (36%)
  - October/December 2017: Init7 (39%), Atom86 (39%), Interoute (8%)
  - July/August 2018: Init7 (57%), Atom86 (55%), AT&T (36%)

**Observations:**
- In the absence of zombies, fewer AS paths contain Init7 or Level(3), highlighting the role of path hunting in zombie propagation. When a beacon is withdrawn and a zombie appears on a transit network, downstream ASes select the zombie path as other paths are discarded.
- The frequency of zombies in transit networks is directly related to the topological spread of zombie outbreaks (Fig. 5a).
- For IPv4, the top-5 ASes vary significantly across the three measurement periods. For IPv6, Init7 and Atom86 are consistently the top two affected networks. Our data shows that Atom86, being downstream of Init7, is affected whenever Init7 has zombies. Init7's zombies typically propagate to 14 downstream ASes, explaining the large number of outbreaks involving about 15 ASes in IPv6 (Fig. 5a).

**Network Operator Insights:**
- Operators at Init7 acknowledged issues with IPv6 routes, likely due to misbehaving vendor software, and expressed the need for zombie reporting systems to address recurring customer complaints.
- Mitigation of BGP zombies usually required clearing some Route Reflector iBGP sessions within Init7’s network. Despite upgrading firmware, the problem persisted.

**Discussion:**
While detecting BGP zombies with RIS beacons is straightforward, identifying the root cause remains challenging. Erratic patterns and operator investigations suggest that zombies are primarily due to software bugs in routers, BGP optimizers, and route reflectors. Systematically identifying the root causes requires detailed and timely information from a complex and occasionally misbehaving infrastructure.

**Future Work:**
- Investigate the impact of zombies on large route leaks.
- Develop a rigorous method for detecting zombies in the wild to estimate their overall impact on routing tables and provide tools for network operators.

**Conclusion:**
Our study revealed that BGP zombies are seen daily, with the scope of outbreaks typically limited to a small fraction of monitored ASes. There is little regularity in their appearance, and numerous zombie paths emerge during path hunting. Future work will focus on identifying zombies for any prefix announced on the Internet and quantifying their impact. Our tools and traceroute results are publicly available [1] to assist researchers in their zombie hunt.
