ﬂexibility for security because software deﬁned networking
and cloud computing are among the key concepts of emerging
5G architectures.
3GPP follows the good practice of documenting exceptions
when speciﬁcation needs to deviate from the general security
design principles recommended by the security working group
(as was the case with L3 or D1/D2/D3). We recommend further
that each such exception should also trigger an analysis of its
implications. For example, if an exception is made to forego in-
tegrity protection for a denial message from the network, then
the standards group should consider what happens and how to
recover if the denial message contains incorrect information.
B. Countermeasures and discussion
information must be sent
We now discuss potential countermeasures against attacks
demonstrated in earlier sections. In particular, we identify
protocol-level and operational ﬁxes that can be implemented
by baseband vendors and mobile network operators. Some of
these countermeasures are much more straight-forward than
others. Similarly, some of our proposals may cause hidden de-
pendencies and more changes may be needed in the networks
than what is apparent from our descriptions.
Protection against location leaks: LTE broadcast information
include subscriber identities which enable tracking of UEs
(L1 and L2). The broadcast
in
unprotected messages from LTE system design perspective.
There are two solutions to avoid UEs being tracked. One
solution is to protect broadcast messages using a public key
mechanism but this requires relatively big changes in LTE
protocols. According to [54], 3GPP decided against usage of
public key mechanisms because its implementation cost was
deemed too high. However, our ﬁndings may have changed the
equilibrium in this trade-off. Consequently, a scheme where
public/private keys are used only for network elements could
possibly be justiﬁed now. Messages from the network could be
signed by using a public key digital signature mechanism; UEs
would then be able to verify the authenticity of such messages.
This would prevent rogue network elements from sending false
information, e.g., false messages indicating radio link failures
(L3). Messages towards the network could be encrypted using
the public key of the serving operator; UEs would not need
to send their identities in the clear to initiate network Attach
procedure. It is not easy to protect paging messages with public
key mechanisms, even if we would have public keys for UEs
because UEs would have to try to decrypt all paging messages.
All these proposed ﬁxes require ensuring global availability
and veriﬁability of public keys of network components (such
as eNodeB).
The second solution is more realistic as it does not require
change in protocols. Network operators would simply re-
allocate GUTIs often enough to avoid tracking. One of the
national operators to whom we reported our ﬁndings, acknowl-
edged the feasibility of our attacks and already conﬁgured
their networks to prevent
tracking based on GUTIs. This
solution would protect against passive attacks (L1). A certain
degree of protection against semi-passive adversaries could be
achieved by making the adversary’s actions more visible to the
subscriber. There are already such tools [31], [32] available

TABLE II: LTE attacks, vulnerability analysis, and ﬁxes
but the challenge is in making them usable and useful to all
types of subscribers. LTE speciﬁcation vulnerability regarding
UEs sending measurement reports without integrity protection
needs to be addressed by the 3GPP security group in order for
all baseband vendors to eventually implement the ﬁx in their
products. The simplest solution is to transmit measurement
reports only after setting up the security context.
Protection against DoS: The speciﬁcation vulnerabilities re-
sponsible for DoS attacks based on TAU procedure (D1 and
D2) can be ﬁxed without changes in the protocol itself. The
3GPP SA3 group may propose a new mechanism based on a
counter or timer value to recover from DoS attacks. If the UE is
detached from the network for a certain duration as a result of a
TAU reject messages, it should reset the conﬁguration settings
in the USIM or baseband to re-attach itself with the network
without bothering the user, i.e., without having to reboot or
require re-insertion of USIM. If there is an infrastructure
to support distribution of operator public keys, TAU reject
messages could be signed by the network and veriﬁed by UEs.
Next, we discuss protection against DoS stemming from
bidding down attacks (D3). During an Attach procedure, the
UE’s network and security capabilities are sent to the network.
The attacker can modify this list to downgrade capabilities
reported by the UE and and forward it to the network. To
protect against such modiﬁcation, both 3G and LTE contain the
partial ‘matching history’ mechanism discussed above. This
allows UE to check that its original list of security capabilities
are identical with the ones received by the network. We argue
that similar protection for network capabilities is required due
to the fact that the DoS attack has a persistent nature. This
would of course require change in the LTE protocols. Again,
with the use of operator public keys, it would be possible to use
digital signatures to protect lists of capabilities broadcast by the
network. Alternatively, the negotiation of network capabilities
could be done after AKA is successfully completed.
IX. RELATED WORK
In this section, we describe related work in GSM, 3G, and
LTE air-interface security area. Previous works have reported
attacks against 2G and 3G access network protocols [2],
[55], core network protocols [56], [57], [58], [59], as well as
services [60]. In passive attacks, Kune et al. [2] showed that
despite the use of temporary IDs, the location of a subscriber’s
UE in a GSM network can be leaked. In speciﬁc, it was shown
that an attacker can check if a UE is within a small area,
or absent from a large area, without subscriber’s awareness.
However, their location leaks granularity is lower and it is
improved with our attacks on LTE networks. The 3GPP discuss
a set of threats exposed in E-UTRAN [51] during LTE security
study. However, the attacks we presented are not identiﬁed
by the study. In active attacks, the authors in [61] present a
method to determine the presence of a subscriber in a particular
area by exploiting a vulnerability in 3G AKA protocol. By
leveraging a rogue eNodeB (femtocell), previously captured
authentication parameters are replayed to the UE and the
presence is conﬁrmed based on the response from the phone.
However their attack cannot reveal approximate location of the
UE in a given area.
In DoS attacks, the authors in [44] describe that unauthen-
ticated attach requests sent from a compromised UE/eNodeB
to ﬂood the MME and in turn to the HSS, leading to a DoS
attack. However their DoS attacks are against the network
and not against LTE subscribers. Through simulations the
authors in [62] show that Botnets can cause DoS attacks by
exhausting subscriber trafﬁc capacity over the air interface.
A proof of concept paper by P. Jover et al. [63] provides
an overview of new effective attacks (smart jamming) that
extend the range and effectiveness of basic radio jamming.
However according to [54], both aforementioned ﬂooding and
jamming attacks are non-persistent DOS attacks hence not
considered as a threat to address in the LTE architecture. In
contrast, our DoS attacks are persistent and targeted towards
the UE (subscribers). LTE security architecture and a detailed
list of security vulnerabilities existing in the LTE networks
have been presented in [64]. Our attacks are not presented
in this survey. Two recent papers [65], [66] discuss resource
stealing and DoS attacks against VoLTE, whereas our focus
is against LTE access network protocols. To the best of our
knowledge, there was no previous work evaluating practical
attacks on LTE access networks in the literature.
X. CONCLUSION
We have shown that
the vulnerabilities we discovered
in LTE access network protocols lead to new privacy and
availability threats to LTE subscribers. We demonstrated that
our attacks can be mounted using open source LTE software
stack and readily available hardware at low cost. The need for
engineering the correct trade-offs between security and other
requirements (availability, performance, and functionality) led
to the vulnerabilities in the ﬁrst place. Such trade-offs are
essential for the success of any large-scale system. But the
trade-off equilibrium points are not static. We recommend that
future standardization efforts take this into account.
Impact: We followed standard responsible disclosure prac-
tices of all affected manufacturers. We also notiﬁed affected
operators as well as the standards body (3GPP). All four
13
manufacturers acknowledged our report. Two of them have
already released patches [67], [68]. Two of three operators
have ﬁxed the conﬁguration issues in their networks. 3GPP has
initiated several updates to the LTE speciﬁcations to address
the issues we raised [69]. Up-to-date information about impact
may be found in the arXiv report version of this paper [6] and
on our project website8.
