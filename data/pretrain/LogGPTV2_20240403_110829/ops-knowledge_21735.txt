User: What is a network topology? Can you list several common network topologies?
Assistant: Network topology refers to the physical and logical connections between various devices in a computer network. Common network topologies include: 1. Star topology: All devices are connected to a central device such as a switch or hub. 2. Bus topology: All devices are connected to the same bus. 3. Ring topology: All devices are connected in a ring. 4. Tree topology: devices are connected into a tree structure, there is a root node, and the devices linked by each child node can form child nodes again. 5. Mesh topology: Each device is connected to other devices to form a mesh structure. 6. Hybrid topology: Combines a variety of different topologies to form a more complex network structure.
