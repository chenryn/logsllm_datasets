User: Where's the best place to get notified when celery workers die?
I'm aware of the worker_shutdown signal but does it get called also in sudden death of workers?
I have these pdf rendering workers and they suddenly died or at least became unresponsive to remote control commands so I'm looking for ways so I can get notified when things like this happen.
Assistant: A worker can't trigger signals after it has been killed.
The best way would be to write a plugin for Nagios, Munin or similar to notify when
the number of workers decrease.  See the Monitoring and Management guide in the Celery documentation.
