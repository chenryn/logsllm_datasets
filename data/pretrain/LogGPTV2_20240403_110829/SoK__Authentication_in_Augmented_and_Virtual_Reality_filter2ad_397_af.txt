factor methods in our evaluation, all of which combine
a knowledge-based method with a biometric. In GlassGes-
ture [76], the user nods or shakes their head in response to
displayed security questions, and their head movement bio-
metrics are collected for multi-factor authentication. Mathis et
al. present RubikBiom [55], [56], [57], which adds controller
biometrics on top of a Rubik’s Cube-style PIN mechanism.
Finally, Zhu et al.’s BlinKey [81] has a user blink in a
remembered pattern (a quasi-PIN) and measures the physi-
ological features of their blinks. Theoretically, GlassGesture
and RubikBiom could be Platform-Agnostic—if the biometric
layer is ignored on other platforms (as Mathis et al. propose),
the knowledge-based layer could be used to authenticate the
user anywhere. Notably,
in much lower
security: GlassGesture would be reduced to “yes” or “no”
security questions, and RubikBiom would map to a classic
PIN. Even so, few other methods oﬀer this important beneﬁt.
Improved security. Since the extra biometric component is
not obvious to the user,
the usability and accessibility of
multi-factor methods are no worse than that of knowledge-
based methods. In stark contrast to knowledge-based methods,
though, multi-factor methods do best in security. Requiring
the user to enter a correct secret on top of passing a biometric
layer means that multi-factor methods are both Resilient-to-
Guessing and Resilient-to-Physical-Observation. They even

this would result
Summary. As previously discussed, the primary beneﬁt of
incumbent methods such as password and PIN is that they are
Platform-Agnostic. Multi-factor methods could provide better
security for these methods on AR and VR while remaining
somewhat Platform-Agnostic. It is worth exploring ways to
implement
these methods in real systems so that we can
achieve stronger security on AR and VR (including protection
from shoulder surﬁng) without sacriﬁcing deployability.
VII. Discussion & Open Challenges
We provide a three-way review of authentication on AR/VR
devices from the viewpoint of users, developers, and re-
searchers. Researchers are looking into developing new mech-
anisms, but this is not reﬂected in the deployed apps. Though
users feel the pain of using traditional authentication methods
and newly proposed methods can provide better usability and
accessibility, most developers are still using passwords and
PINs. Here, we highlight key ﬁndings, present open problems,
and call for solutions that are practical, usable, and secure.
Improving the availability of usable authentication mecha-
nisms. Our evaluation highlights the wide variety of authen-
tication mechanisms proposed for AR and VR. Many new

methods oﬀer usability and accessibility improvements over
incumbent methods; however, most lack deployability. Though
our study indicates that AR/VR developers are willing to tailor
authentication methods to provide a better user experience,
there is not enough support or incentive for them to choose
these more usable options. We challenge creators of AR/VR
authentication methods to think critically about how to put
these new methods in the hands of developers.
Expectation of a companion device. Several apps use
authentication methods that necessitate a companion device.
For example, HTC Vive apps that use a Viveport paired
account leverage the fact that the headset is tethered to a PC
to provide automatic authentication. Here, the requirement of
a companion device is trivial since the headset is designed to
be connected to the PC at all times. However, we also see
this requirement in apps on the HoloLens 2, an untethered
device. The frequent use of these authentication methods
indicates that AR devices may be perceived as a companion
device to a computer or phone, rather than as a standalone
device. To our knowledge, authentication is the only part of
the apps requiring a companion device; with an alternative
authentication mechanism, these apps would not require a
companion device and could thus be used as a standalone
personal device as the community envisions.
Need for comprehensive evaluation. As indicated by the
number of † symbols in Fig. 4, many of the papers we looked
at do not comprehensively test the methods they propose. In
particular, several papers neglect to evaluate whether their
methods are Eﬃcient-to-Use, Infrequent-Errors, Low-Power-
Consumption or Resilient-to-Physical-Observation, despite the
importance of these considerations. We call on future AR/VR
authentication designers to pay careful attention to our evalua-
tion criteria when designing and evaluating new mechanisms.
Using biometrics safely. AR and VR, with their myriad built-
in sensors, are poised to implement behavioral and physical
biometrics. This is promising: biometrics tend to be more
usable than other methods and have the potential to augment
existing mechanisms or allow for continuous authentication.
However, developers must be wary of the consequences of
using biometric authentication on AR/VR.
Multi-use sensors. Biometric authentication should by de-
fault be handled by the platform and not individual apps.
However, in AR/VR, this alone cannot protect biometric data
from compromise because the same sensors used for authen-
tication may also be used in an app. If malicious, these apps
could easily collect the exact biometric information required
for authentication just by using the available sensors.
Privacy implications. The use of biometrics requires private
user data such as iris and ﬁngerprint images. (In our evaluation,
no biometric fully Protects-User-Privacy.) Thus, any biometric
should be used only with the consent of users, and secure stor-
age of this private data is critical. This is particularly important
because biometrics are a “who-you-are” type authentication
and cannot easily be replaced if compromised. If biometrics
are to be used in AR/VR, we must carefully understand the
privacy implications of that decision and clearly communicate
to users how their data is being used.
Unifying the authentication stack via federated login.
In Section V, we noted that several HTC Vive apps of-
fer automatic authentication via a Viveport account. Four
HoloLens 2 apps also oﬀer authentication via a Microsoft
account; however, for three of these apps, the user must fully
log in to their Microsoft account again (using a username and
password) despite having logged in to use the device in the
ﬁrst place. This is a missed opportunity. If HoloLens apps
leveraged the Microsoft account already logged in on the
device, they could gain the substantial usability beneﬁts of
automatic paired account authentication. Future work should
explore the security/usability concerns of this approach and
how to make federated login available to app developers.
Privacy concerns. Though unifying the authentication stack
could improve usability, we caution that it could also have
privacy implications. Consider Oculus devices, which users
unlock using their Facebook account. If Oculus required the
user to log in to apps with their Facebook account, then
Facebook would know about all of the diﬀerent kinds of
accounts the user has on their Oculus device. Future work will
need to consider the balance between eﬀortless authentication
and user consent when weighing this option for AR and VR.
Support for password managers. Password managers can
greatly reduce the user’s burden to memorize and enter pass-
words. Unfortunately, in AR and VR, “There is no pass-
word management on the device (like LastPass) and worse,
you cannot copy/paste a password from the LastPass vault”
(P048: M,45-54). Without a password manager, users must
use the virtual keyboard to manually input the password and
thus are subject to the usability and security issues of the
virtual keyboard. If password managers were available and
functional on AR/VR, it could potentially mitigate complaints
with passwords on AR/VR; however, password managers are
historically hard to design properly for new platforms [51],
[13]. Designing password managers for AR/VR is intriguing,
but requires careful consideration.
Limitations.
In Section III, we did not verify whether our
survey participants have indeed used or developed on AR/VR
devices; however, we carefully scrutinized the results for
consistency and removed entries with clear evidence of a lack
of experience on these platforms. Our survey results are also
biased towards male respondents, which may aﬀect the validity
of our results. Additionally, in Section V, we only consider
apps on the HoloLens 2 and HTC Vive, and thus cannot make
inferences about other AR or VR devices from our app review.
Finally, our literature survey Section VI considers papers from
only top publication venues and references from those papers,
meaning we could have missed some relevant prior work.
