### Factor Methods in Multi-Factor Authentication

In our evaluation, we examined several multi-factor authentication (MFA) methods that combine a knowledge-based method with a biometric component. 

1. **GlassGesture [76]**: This method involves the user nodding or shaking their head in response to displayed security questions. The system captures the user's head movement biometrics for MFA.

2. **RubikBiom [55], [56], [57]**: Presented by Mathis et al., this method integrates controller biometrics with a Rubik’s Cube-style PIN mechanism. The user manipulates a virtual Rubik’s Cube, and the system records both the PIN and the biometric data from the controller.

3. **BlinKey [81]**: Developed by Zhu et al., BlinKey requires the user to blink in a remembered pattern (a quasi-PIN). The system measures the physiological features of the blinks for authentication.

### Platform-Agnostic Considerations

Theoretically, GlassGesture and RubikBiom could be platform-agnostic if the biometric layer is ignored on other platforms. For instance, Mathis et al. propose that the knowledge-based layer can be used for authentication across different devices. However, ignoring the biometric layer would reduce the security:
- **GlassGesture** would be reduced to simple "yes" or "no" security questions.
- **RubikBiom** would revert to a classic PIN mechanism.

Despite these limitations, few other methods offer the benefit of partial platform-agnosticism while maintaining enhanced security.

### Improved Security

Multi-factor methods enhance security without significantly compromising usability and accessibility. Unlike knowledge-based methods, MFA methods are more resilient to guessing and physical observation. They also provide a level of user privacy protection, especially when the biometric component can be ignored on other platforms. No other type of authentication method performs as well in terms of security.

### Summary

Incumbent methods such as passwords and PINs are platform-agnostic but lack robust security. MFA methods can provide better security for AR and VR while remaining somewhat platform-agnostic. Implementing these methods in real systems can achieve stronger security, including protection against shoulder surfing, without sacrificing deployability.

### Discussion & Open Challenges

Our review of authentication on AR/VR devices from the perspectives of users, developers, and researchers highlights several key points:

#### Availability of Usable Authentication Mechanisms

While many new authentication mechanisms offer improvements in usability and accessibility over traditional methods, they often lack deployability. Although AR/VR developers are willing to tailor authentication methods for a better user experience, there is insufficient support or incentive to adopt these more usable options. We challenge creators of AR/VR authentication methods to think critically about how to make these new methods accessible to developers.

#### Expectation of a Companion Device

Several apps require a companion device for authentication. For example, HTC Vive apps use a paired account via Viveport, leveraging the fact that the headset is tethered to a PC. While this requirement is trivial for tethered devices, it is also seen in untethered devices like the HoloLens 2. This suggests that AR devices are often perceived as companion devices rather than standalone ones. Alternative authentication mechanisms could eliminate the need for a companion device, allowing AR/VR to function as standalone personal devices.

#### Need for Comprehensive Evaluation

Many proposed authentication methods lack comprehensive testing. Future AR/VR authentication designers should pay careful attention to criteria such as efficiency, error frequency, power consumption, and resilience to physical observation.

#### Using Biometrics Safely

AR and VR, with their built-in sensors, are well-suited for implementing behavioral and physical biometrics. These methods are generally more usable and can augment existing mechanisms or enable continuous authentication. However, developers must be cautious about the potential consequences of using biometric authentication, including data security and privacy concerns.

#### Multi-Use Sensors

Biometric authentication should be handled by the platform rather than individual apps. However, in AR/VR, the same sensors used for authentication may also be used by apps, potentially leading to the collection of biometric data by malicious applications.

#### Privacy Implications

Biometrics, such as iris and fingerprint images, require the handling of private user data. Any biometric method should only be used with user consent, and secure storage of this data is critical. Since biometrics are a "who-you-are" type of authentication, they cannot easily be replaced if compromised. Careful consideration of privacy implications is essential when implementing biometrics in AR/VR.

#### Unifying the Authentication Stack via Federated Login

Some HTC Vive apps offer automatic authentication via a Viveport account, and some HoloLens 2 apps use a Microsoft account. However, the need to log in again with a username and password reduces usability. Leveraging the already logged-in Microsoft account could improve the user experience. Future work should explore the security and usability concerns of this approach and how to make federated login available to app developers.

#### Privacy Concerns

Unifying the authentication stack could improve usability but also raise privacy issues. For example, if Oculus required users to log in to apps with their Facebook account, Facebook would have access to all the different accounts on the user's Oculus device. Balancing effortless authentication with user consent is crucial.

#### Support for Password Managers

Password managers can reduce the burden of memorizing and entering passwords. Unfortunately, AR and VR devices currently lack support for password managers, forcing users to manually input passwords using virtual keyboards, which can be cumbersome and insecure. Designing effective password managers for AR/VR is challenging but necessary.

### Limitations

- Our survey participants' experience with AR/VR was not verified, though results were scrutinized for consistency.
- The survey results are biased towards male respondents, which may affect the validity of the findings.
- The app review only considered HoloLens 2 and HTC Vive, limiting inferences about other AR/VR devices.
- Our literature survey focused on top publication venues, potentially missing relevant prior work.
