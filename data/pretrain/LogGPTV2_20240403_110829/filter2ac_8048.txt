Recent versions of mobile operating systems have implemented security measures to make it more difficult for users to inadvertently install untrusted certificates and configurations. 

For example, iOS 10.3 and later versions require an additional step for users to install new trusted Certificate Authority (CA) certificates and configuration profiles. This extra step helps ensure that users are aware of the potential risks and can make informed decisions.

On Android, applications targeting compatibility with Android 7.0 (API Level 24) and higher default to trusting only the CA certificates that are bundled with the operating system. This means that user- or administrator-added CA certificates are not trusted by default. This change significantly reduces the risk of successful adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) attacks, as malicious actors would have a harder time intercepting and manipulating network traffic.
