### ERP Planning: Separation of Duties

#### How to Use This Report
Criteria matrices are provided for each business area analyzed, developed based on ISACA's “Best Practices to Resolve Segregation of Duties Conflicts in Any ERP Environment.” Each matrix outlines employee roles and responsibilities, separated by key tasks within the business area, and identifies the optimal separation of duties to mitigate high-risk conflicts.

The criteria matrices should serve as a guide to understand conflicting tasks within a business area and where automation would be beneficial in the new ERP system to prevent employees from performing high-risk conflicting tasks. Exhibit 1 provides an example of a criteria matrix and how to read it. The report aims to identify areas of highest risk, assess existing mitigating controls, and encourage the use of system automation to mitigate such risks.

### Compliance with Government Auditing Standards
Although these practices are recommended, full implementation may not be possible due to constraints such as ERP configuration, City budget, staffing, or other resource factors. In such cases, manual controls may need to be substituted for automated processes.

This audit of ERP Separation of Duties was conducted in accordance with our FY 2017 and FY 2018 Annual Audit Work Plan and generally accepted government auditing standards. These standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions.

We would like to thank the management and staff in the Information Technology, Administrative Services, and Utilities Departments for their time, cooperation, and assistance during the audit process.

### Implementing Effective Separation of Duties
Implementing effective separation of duties and ensuring well-restricted user access controls for the new ERP system will decrease vulnerabilities and risks.

The City uses a combination of automated and manual processes to separate key business activities and duties among staff for high-risk activities, such as payroll processing, purchase orders and check processing, revenue collections, and asset management transactions. Although no major concerns were found, opportunities for improvement were identified. We assessed an employee’s ability to access and perform transactions within a high-risk area and provided an understanding of where the high-risk areas are within various workflows.

#### Accounts Payable (AP)
Accounts Payable is a division of the Administrative Services Department (ASD) responsible for processing, recording, and reporting citywide financial transactions. AP primarily uses SAP to maintain and process vendor invoices and payments. In FY 2017, the City issued 10,301 checks and purchased $122 million of goods and services. AP has four employees: a Senior Accountant, a Lead Account Specialist, and two Account Specialists.

Based on the matrix in Exhibit 2, nine conflicting tasks would need to be performed by at least nine different employees for maximum separation of duties. Given the current staffing of four employees, manual controls are necessary to mitigate the high risks in this work area.

**Finding Summary: Accounts Payable**
- **Exhibit 2: Accounts Payable Criteria Matrix**

**High-Risk Area: Invoice Entry and Payment Processing**
- AP employees can enter an invoice and process payment, creating an unnecessary risk.
- While other departments enter invoices into SAP for AP staff to process, occasionally AP staff processes their own invoices.
- All three Accounting Specialists in AP can enter an invoice and process the payment for supervisory approval, leading to a separation of duties conflict.
- Discontinuing AP’s access to certain SAP transactions and transferring this task to ASD Administration would immediately mitigate this high risk.

#### Payroll/Human Resources
Payroll is a division of ASD that primarily processes payroll for city employees through timesheet and check processing. Paychecks are processed for about 1,200 employees, totaling $116 million in authorized salary and benefits. Payroll has five employees: a Senior Accountant, an Accountant, two Payroll Analysts, and a Management Specialist.

Based on the matrix in Exhibit 3, five conflicting tasks would need to be performed by at least four different employees for maximum separation of duties. Staffing levels are sufficient with five employees in Payroll for effective separation of duties.

**Exhibit 3: Payroll Criteria Matrix**

**High-Risk Area: Access to All Payroll Operations**
- Payroll employees have access to all payroll operations, which creates a risk.
- Four of the five payroll employees have access to all payroll operations, including modifying employee master data or salary information and processing payroll fraudulently.
- High-risk tasks that should have restrictions, separation, or effective manual processes currently do not, allowing potential fraudulent activity:
  - Changing their own and each other’s salary data.
  - Modifying employee time data to increase regular or overtime pay.
  - Entering false personnel data and time to process a fraudulent payroll.

**Current Manual Controls**
- Payroll has a manual process in place to manage the risk of employees modifying master data and fraudulently processing the change through payroll, but the control can be more effective.
- Opportunities exist within the new ERP system to automate or separate duties between Human Resources and Payroll to achieve higher risk mitigation.

**Human Resources**
- The ISACA report listed only two high-risk areas within Human Resources:
  1. Changing employee HR benefits and then processing payroll without authorization.
  2. Changing master data and creating remittance to a third-party vendor.
- The first was categorized and reviewed as a Payroll item, and the second was determined as external and covered under AP.

#### Revenue Collections (RC)
Revenue Collections is a division in ASD responsible for collecting City revenue generated from various city services. RC collects over $97 million in revenue annually and is one of the most public-facing divisions of the City. RC has nine employees: a Manager, two Lead Account Specialists, and six Account Specialists.

Based on the matrix in Exhibit 4, three conflicting tasks would need to be performed by at least three different employees for maximum separation of duties. Staffing levels are sufficient with nine employees in RC for effective separation of duties.

**Exhibit 4: Revenue Collections Criteria Matrix**

**High-Risk Area: Cash Handling and Customer Service**
- RC uses a revenue collection system external to SAP that is integrated to upload transactions into SAP.
- Due to the customer service and cash handling nature of RC, and the need for desk rotation, multiple employees perform the same tasks, and many processes are manual and paper-based.
- Under the current process, RC has well-separated, administered, and mitigated high-risk tasks.
- Although RC has a manual process in place to manage the risk of employees stealing cash, the control can be more effective. Moving to an automated reconciliation and reporting process may be more effective.

#### Treasury
Treasury is a division of ASD responsible for managing and investing the City’s funds and assets and facilitating debt financing. Treasury manages $532 million of City cash and investments and has two employees: a Manager and a Senior Management Analyst.

Based on the matrix in Exhibit 5, two conflicting tasks need to be performed by at least two different employees for adequate separation of duties. Staffing levels are sufficient with two employees in Treasury.

**Exhibit 5: Treasury Criteria Matrix**

**High-Risk Area: Stock Trade Creation and Confirmation**
- The only high-risk conflicting task reviewed in Treasury was the ability to create and confirm the processing of a stock trade.
- The process for these tasks is completed manually and is separated properly.
- Automating some of these processes in the new ERP system, if possible, would achieve some efficiencies.

#### Utilities
The City’s Utilities Department operates and provides electric, gas, water, wastewater, and fiber optic services. Utilities performs many of the same high-risk duties as other divisions in the Administrative Services Department, but at a much lower and more limited capacity. These duties include maintaining utility customer data, processing customer bills and payments, and collecting utility revenue.

Due to the limited transactions, this area was not determined to be high-risk. However, Utilities should follow the same separation of duties processes and practices established by the Administrative Services Department when performing high-risk tasks.
