automated and manual. 
How to Use This Report  Criteria matrices are presented for each business area we analyzed, which 
we developed based on ISACA's “Best Practices to resolve Segregation of 
Duties conflicts in any ERP environment." Each matrix displays the 
employee roles and responsibilities, separated by key tasks within the 
business area, and identifies the optimum separation of duties to mitigate 
high‐risk conflicts. 
The criteria matrices should be used as guidance to understand the 
conflicting tasks within a business area and where automation would be 
beneficial in the new ERP system to prevent employees from performing 
high‐risk conflicting tasks. Exhibit 1 shows an example of a criteria matrix 
and how to read it. The intent of this report is to identify areas of highest 
risk, identify mitigating controls currently in place, and encourage the use 
of system automation to mitigate such risks.

standards 
Although these practices are recommended, full implementation may not 
be possible due to constraints such as ERP configuration, City budget, 
staffing, or other resource factors, in which case, manual controls may 
need to be substituted in lieu of automated processes.  
We conducted this audit of ERP Separation of Duties in accordance with 
our FY 2017 and FY 2018 Annual Audit Work Plan and generally accepted 
government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and 
perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a 
reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit 
objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable 
basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. 
We would like to thank management and staff in the Information Technology, Administrative 
Services, and Utilities Departments for their time, cooperation, and assistance during the 
audit process.

Implementing effective separation of duties and ensuring well‐
restricted user access controls for the new ERP system will 
decrease vulnerabilities and risks. 
The City uses varying automated and manual processes to 
separate key business activities and duties among staff for the 
high‐risk activities we reviewed, such as payroll processing, 
purchase orders and check processing, revenue collections, and 
asset management transactions. Although we did not find any 
major concerns, we identified opportunities for improvement. 
We assessed an employee’s ability to access and perform 
transactions within a high‐risk area.  We also offered an 
understanding of where the high‐risk areas are within various 
workflows. 
Accounts Payable (AP) is a division of the Administrative Services 
Department (ASD). Their goal is to process, record, and report 
citywide financial transactions. AP primarily uses SAP to maintain 
and process vendor invoices and payments. In FY 2017, the City 
issued 10,301 checks, and purchased $122 million of goods and 
services. AP has four employees: a Senior Accountant, a Lead 
Account Specialist, and two Account Specialists. 
Based on the matrix we developed in Exhibit 2, nine conflicting 
tasks would need to be performed by at least nine different 
employees for maximum separation of duties. Because this is not 
feasible with the four employees currently in AP, manual controls 
are needed to mitigate the high risks in this work area.

Accounts Payable employees can 
enter an invoice and process 
payment to that invoice, which 
creates an unnecessary risk 
PAYROLL/HUMAN RESOURCES 
While other departments enter invoices into SAP for AP staff to 
process, creating a separation of duties, occasionally AP staff 
processes their own invoices. All three Accounting Specialists in 
AP can enter an invoice and process the payment for supervisory 
approval. This creates a separation of duties conflict because 
payment may be made on a fraudulently created and entered 
invoice. User access allows invoices to be entered through three 
types of SAP transactions, each differing based upon the type of 
invoice entered for payment. Discontinuing AP’s access to these 
SAP transactions and transferring this task to ASD Administration, 
for example, would immediately mitigate this high risk. 
We reviewed other high‐risk areas on the ISACA list for AP and 
determined that they are well separated and well administered. 
Payroll is a division of ASD that primarily processes payroll for 
city employees through timesheet and check processing. 
Paychecks are processed for about 1,200 employees, and total 
$116 million dollars in authorized salary and benefits. Payroll has 
five employees: a Senior Accountant, an Accountant, two Payroll 
Analysts, and a Management Specialist. 
Based on the matrix we developed in Exhibit 3, five conflicting 
tasks would need to be performed by at least four different

employees for maximum separation of duties. Staffing levels are 
sufficient with five employees in Payroll for effective separation 
of duties. 
EXHIBIT 3 
Payroll 
SOURCE: Auditor’s analysis and summary of ISACA's “Best Practices to resolve Segregation of Duties conflicts in any ERP 
environment.” 
Payroll employees have access to 
all payroll operations, which 
creates risk 
Each City employee enters time into a timesheet system. A 
supervisor approves the time entered and Payroll approves and 
processes the timesheets for payroll processing.  
Four of the five payroll employees have access to all payroll 
operations, for all employees and themselves. This is a high‐risk 
access because it allows the ability to modify employee master 
data or salary information and then process payroll fraudulently. 
Some high‐risk tasks that should have restrictions, separation, or 
effective manual processes instituted, currently do not. These 
tasks allow for potential fraudulent activity, including the ability 
for Payroll staff to: 
  Change their own and each other’s salary data, which 
would allow the salary increase to go unnoticed. 
  Change employee time data by entering fraudulent time 
to increase regular or overtime pay. 
  Enter false personnel data and time to process a 
fraudulent payroll. 
Attachment AERP Planning: Separation of Duties 
Although Payroll has a manual process in place to manage the 
risk of employees modifying master data and fraudulently 
processing the change through payroll, the control can be more 
effective. There may be opportunities within the new ERP system 
to automate or separate duties between Human Resources and 
Payroll to achieve a higher level of risk mitigation. 
The ISACA report listed only two high risk areas within Human 
Resources: 1) change employee HR benefits then process payroll 
without authorization, and 2) change master data and creating 
the remittance to a third party vendor. The first was categorized 
and reviewed as a Payroll item because the high risk is in the 
fraudulent disbursement of a payroll check. The second was 
determined as external because the risk was associated with a 
third party vendor and check disbursement which was covered 
under AP. 
Revenue Collections (RC) is a division in ASD and is responsible 
for collecting City revenue generated from various city services. 
RC collects over $97 million in revenue annually and is one of the 
most public‐facing divisions of the City. RC has nine employees: a 
Manager, two Lead Account Specialists, and six Account 
Specialists. 
Based on the matrix we developed in Exhibit 4, three conflicting 
tasks would need to be performed by at least three different 
employees for maximum separation of duties. Staffing levels are 
sufficient with nine employees in RC for effective separation of 
duties.

environment.” 
TREASURY 
RC uses a revenue collection system external to SAP that is 
integrated to upload transactions into SAP. Due to the customer 
service and cash handling nature of RC, and the need for desk 
rotation, multiple employees are needed to fill the same role. 
Therefore, six of the nine employees in RC perform the same 
tasks and many of the processes are manual and paper‐based. 
Under this current process, RC has well separated, administered, 
and mitigated the high‐risk tasks. 
Although Revenue Collections has a manual process in place to 
manage the risk of employees stealing cash, the control can be 
more effective. The current control is paper‐based. It may be 
more effective to move to an automated reconciliation and 
reporting process. 
Treasury is a division of ASD and is responsible for managing and 
investing the City’s funds and assets and facilitating debt 
financing. Treasury manages $532 million of City cash and 
investments and has two employees: a Manager and a Senior 
Management Analyst. 
Based on the matrix we developed in Exhibit 5, two conflicting 
tasks need to be performed by at least two different employees 
for adequate SoD in the high‐risk areas. Staffing levels are 
sufficient with two employees in Treasury.

UTILITIES 
The only high‐risk conflicting task we reviewed in Treasury was 
the ability to create and confirm the processing of a stock trade. 
The process for the tasks is completed manually and is separated 
properly. However, automating some of these processes in the 
new ERP system, if possible, would achieve some efficiencies. 
The City’s Utility’s Department (Utilities) operates and provides 
electric, gas, water, wastewater, and fiber optic services. Utilities 
performs many of the same high‐risk duties as other divisions in 
the Administrative Services Department; however, the 
transactions are performed at a much less and more limited 
capacity. These duties include maintaining utility customer data, 
processing customer bills and payments, and collecting utility 
revenue. 
Due to the limited transactions, we did not determine this to be a 
high‐risk area. However, Utilities should follow the same 
separation of duties processes and practices established by the 
Administrative Services Department when performing the high‐
risk tasks.
