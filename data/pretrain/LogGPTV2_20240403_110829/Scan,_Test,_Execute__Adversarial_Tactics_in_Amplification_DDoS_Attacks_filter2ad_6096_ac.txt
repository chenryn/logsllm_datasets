to execute the attack with a specific vector. In this study, we focus on
six commonly abused protocols in amplification attacks [27]: NTP,
DNS, SSDP, CharGen, RIP, and Quote-of-the-Day (QOTD). Overall,
we find adversaries are abusing these long-established protocols
with conceptually similar vectors. We however also see glimpses
of innovation and capability development where attackers are not
bound to a specific protocol and perform attacks using multiple
protocols simultaneously. This however only occurs infrequently,
as only 252 of the 13,479 attacks leverage multiple protocols in their
attack.

5.2 Infrastructure reconnaissance
Before a server can be abused, an adversary needs to know about its
existence. This is typically executed through port scanning, which
our system can distinguish from attacks, as during a scan, only a
few packets are sent to one honeypot, wherein an attack, many
packets are sent from one IP address to multiple open services. To
identify scanners, we apply our auxiliary telescope datasets and
the honeypot servers that are only running a subset of services.
If source IPs connect to dark IP addresses or honeypots where a
service is not running, these requests are scanning and not part of
attack usage. We experimentally derived that actors use up to 20
packets from the same source IP to test honeypots. In the following,
we use this threshold to classify probes below this as scanning,
while flows of more than 20 packets towards two or more of our
honeypots are labeled as an attack.
Our honeypots report 3,650 distinct IP addresses sending scan-
ning probes to our system, in which NTP, DNS, and SSDP are much
more popular than the other protocols in terms of scanning activity.
Based on the data in the telescopes, we can identify whether hosts
scan the entire Internet or target the cloud providers in which our
honeypots are located. Surprisingly, only 56% of all scans seem to
target the Internet indiscriminately, and 44% was only observed on
our honeypots in the cloud locations. Additionally, we find that 39%
of IP addresses targeting only cloud instances are hitting only one
cloud location, which we can largely attribute to scans originating
from the same /24 subnets targeting their scans towards separate
cloud locations spread across the netblock. The remainder of the
scans targeting small parts of the network might originate from bot-
nets segmenting their scanning activity or from attackers probing a
single cloud provider. We observe a small fraction (6%) of all attacks
only using amplification servers located in a single cloud, which
we will show later, are not performed by sophisticated attackers.
Research scans are prevalent, and we need to account for
these to avoid biases. Not all scanning traffic is malicious, as ser-
vices such as Shodan, Censys, and Rapid7 scan the Internet for re-
search purposes and identify themselves as such using hostnames

vation on Sep 7th, traffic from recurring scanners increased
and only slowly declined after the shutdown on Sep 27.
such as worker-01.sfj.corp.censys.io and census6.shodan.io and orig-
inate from a known block of IP addresses. To obtain an accurate
view of scanning with malicious intent, we manually classified IP
addresses either as research, hosting provider, or residential, based
on reverse DNS, BGP data, and cloud customer IP ranges. Table 3
shows the result per protocol. It is striking that overall, research-
based scanning accounts for more than 30% of all scans and 37%
of all IP addresses. For DNS, research-based scans even amount to
over half of all scanning. While not common in scanning research,
it appears that careful curation is needed.
When considering the geolocation of scanning IP addresses, most
of the hosts are located in the US. However, as listed in table 4,
the large majority of IP addresses scanning from the US belong to
research institutions. In our analysis, we thus excluded research
scans from our dataset and instructed our honeypots not to respond
to these projects. By excluding scanning institutions such as Shodan
and Censys [7, 23] our honeypots will not appear on their publicly
available lists, meaning that attacks can only be a result of scanners
from the other categories: residential and hosting IP addresses.
Responsive IPs make scanners come back twice as fast. As
shown in figure 5, the number of IP addresses scanning our honey-
pots sharply increased after the services started to respond after
a week of passive listening. Richter et al. [26] have investigated
this by comparing scanning traffic in a CDN against a network tele-
scope and find that the presence of active services would trigger ad-
versaries to intensify their activities. By comparing the difference
of our baseline and the active experiment, we find that this increase
is primarily driven by intensified rescanning – IP addresses come
back to a vulnerable server on average two times faster than when
the scanned protocol is not present on the machine – and to a lesser
degree on new IP addresses emerging. After the infrastructure re-
turns to passive mode, previously connecting IP addresses slowly go
back to the baseline. As we will show later, the attacker’s “memory”
of which services used to be available at an IP easily spans months.
Initial testing happens during scanning. During a scan, adver-
saries are already interested in the first quantification of the system.
We have seen that even during the initial scan, the amplification
supplied by the server is tested; adversaries would use the same
packets that will eventually be used in attacks to immediately es-
tablish whether a server can be used later on based on the observed

where scans primarily request the BIND version running.
5.3 Target reconnaissance
Compared to DDoS attacks that exploit a particular vulnerability,
the amount of target reconnaissance activity is minimal in case of
amplification attacks. Though an attacker can direct any kind of
data to the victim to consume the bandwidth, we still observe slight
nuances in how victims are targeted in practice.
Victimization has changed since previous studies. The major-
ity of victims are located in the US and China, with 846 and 602
subnets being attacked, consistent with previous works and log-
ical given IP address allocation. Jonker et al. [13] found attacks
mostly follow Internet usage patterns with exceptions of, for ex-
ample, Japan, Russia, and France. We however observe a different
disproportional share of attacks on countries such as South Africa,
Poland, or Kuwait. We find that this disproportionality mainly
stems from different services located in these countries, such as
hosting providers which are extensively attacked during our study.
As our experiments only ran for a limited time due to the scale
of our honeypot system, we cannot identify seasonality in the at-
tacks, and we could therefore have a bias towards large attacks that
happened during our measurements. However, as we identify sig-
nificant changes in attack traffic than previous work, future work
should identify whether there are trends in DDoS attacks or are
largely spurred by opportunistic attacks.
Only 51% of all targeted IP addresses had a domain name pointed
to it during the attack based on passive DNS and a database of
daily active domain crawls. While we expect most DDoS attacks to
be targeted against servers that would commonly have a domain
name pointed to them, we find that there are also a large number
of DDoS attacks on residential IP address space without domain
names. As the domains are not only pointing towards web servers
but also to, for example, Minecraft servers, we queried the Shodan
API for active scanning data to find open ports on the victim devices.
Shodan lists the open ports for 1,289 (9,6%) of the IP addresses
that were attacked. While Jonker et al. [13] associate most UDP
amplification attacks with online gaming, we find that only a small
part of the attacks we have recorded are targeting game servers or
ports used by multiplayer games.
Attacks towards large domains are rare. Load balancing inter-
feres with an attacker’s objective, as taking down a host leaves a
service unimpaired, redirecting users to one of the hosts that are
still online. Performing an attack on these services requires an at-
tacker to attack all fronts, using the domain name resolution to
resolve all IP addresses of this service. By identifying attacks on
IP addresses hosting common domain names using passive DNS
and active domain lookups, we can find attacks conducted on mul-
tiple IP addresses addressed by a single domain name. In total, we
find 862 domain names for which more than one IP address was
part of an attack and find that not only do attacks target multiple
IP addresses for the primary domain but also multiple subdomains
simultaneously. In an attack on the Discord service, providing chat
rooms targeted at gaming communities, 61 servers were targeted,
aiming to bring down a specific region indicated by domains such
as russia17.discord.gg. Many of the attacks directed to multiple IP

Attacks are mostly conducted in the afternoon and evening,
except in the US where mainly data centers targeted at night.
addresses hosting domains are targeting CDN providers such as
yunjiasu-cdn.net or googleusercontent.com. As the attacks solely tar-
get the IP addresses where a domain is hosted and no other ad-
dresses belonging to the specific company, these attacks could only
have been conducted using DNS lookups.
Subnet-based attacks are increasingly rare. Attacking an enter-
prise can be daunting, as the resources or large organizations allow
them to switch between different IP addresses to mitigate an attack
rapidly. To avoid this, attackers choose not only to attack the IP ad-
dresses running a service but also to attack entire /24 subnets. These
attacks do not target hosts but exhaust the router’s capacity in front
of these hosts, rendering all hosts unreachable. We find these attacks
are increasingly rare as opposed to [32], as we observe 12 complete
subnets being attacked with another 29 subnets being partially at-
tacked during our entire study while Thomas et al. identify on aver-
age 5.39 of these attacks per day. All full subnet attacks we have iden-
tified are aimed at shared hosting providers, for which a single set of
amplifiers is used for the entire attack across all IP addresses. This
is implemented using a round-robin for the IP address of the subnet,
which are all hit consecutively in the full-subnet attacks observed.
Attacks are scheduled to hit during prime time. While related
work has not considered the time a DDoS attack is conducted from
the victim’s perspective, we find that DDoS attacks are aimed at a
victim during times that there would be the most impact. Figure 6
shows the start of attacks in the local timezone of the victims for
the top 5 attacked countries. We find that attacks occur mainly in
the afternoon and evening, where many people would be using the
attacked services. Based on open ports listed in Shodan, attacks on
websites occur evenly during the afternoon and evening. Interest-
ingly, we find that 83% of attacks on game servers occur after 6 PM
as adversaries hit these servers at their busiest times.
5.4 Weaponization
After the reconnaissance phases, the adversary needs to create
software and packet payloads to trigger the amplifiers. This might
result in attacker-specific and tool-dependent implementations.
Packet content shows high homogeneity between attacks. In
the first step of the analysis, we investigate the commands used
to trigger the amplification, where we find as shown in table 5
very high homogeneity of what techniques adversaries use, even
though we have observed 16,900 different payloads being directed
to our honeypots. In NTP the monlist packet is present in almost

all attacks, and similarly in RIP only one packet has been used for
all attacks. Attacks using SSDP however show the use of multiple
different strings, although the overall attack stays the same, where
they all request ssdp:discover in the packet, albeit with different
flags or different order in the fields sent. In QOTD however, 10%
of the attacks were observed leaving the message bigbo in our
honeypots, and another 8% of all attacks requested getstatus, which
has no meaning in the quote of the day protocol. DNS attacks were
mainly conducted with empty packets that did not request a server
to perform a lookup and return some record, which results in a
response containing a string of root servers, amplifying the DNS
header approximately six times. Attackers could obtain much higher
amplification rates when using servers enabling zone transfers,
which allows attackers to make a DNS server pass a copy of its
database to a victim. While we would expect adversaries to probe
our systems on whether this is possible, none of the attackers has
tried to identify non-restricted DNS servers.
Attackers care about the amplification power of a server - at
least in some protocols. We placed honeypots with different am-
plification factors throughout our network to test the differences in
how attackers located and used them. Intuitively, two things could
happen when attackers find several servers with various amplifica-
