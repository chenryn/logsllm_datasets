User: If I have a long running process that is running from file.py, can I edit file.py while it is running and run it again, starting a new process and not affect the already running process?
Assistant: Yes, Python is not constantly reading the file, the file is only interpreted once per run. The current instance that is already running will not be affected by changes in the script.
