ABSTRACT
Social interactions and interpersonal communication has undergone
signiﬁcant changes in recent years. Increasing awareness of privacy
issues and events such as the Snowden disclosures have led to the
rapid growth of a new generation of anonymous social networks
and messaging applications. By removing traditional concepts of
strong identities and social links, these services encourage commu-
nication between strangers, and allow users to express themselves
without fear of bullying or retaliation.
Despite millions of users and billions of monthly page views,
there is little empirical analysis of how services like Whisper have
changed the shape and content of social interactions. In this pa-
per, we present results of the ﬁrst large-scale empirical study of
an anonymous social network, using a complete 3-month trace of
the Whisper network covering 24 million whispers written by more
than 1 million unique users. We seek to understand how anonymity
and the lack of social links affect user behavior. We analyze Whis-
per from a number of perspectives, including the structure of user
interactions in the absence of persistent social links, user engage-
ment and network stickiness over time, and content moderation in
a network with minimal user accountability. Finally, we identify
and test an attack that exposes Whisper users to detailed location
tracking. We have notiﬁed Whisper and they have taken steps to
address the problem.

INTRODUCTION
Over the last decade, online social networks (OSNs) such as
Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter have revolutionized the way we
communicate. By formalizing our ofﬂine social relationships into
digital form, these networks have greatly expanded our capacity for
social interactions, both in volume and frequency.
Yet the industry landscape is changing. Content posted on Face-
book is now commonly used to vet job candidates, support divorce
litigation, and terminate employees. In addition, studies have ob-
served a signiﬁcant growth in privacy-seeking behavior, even de-
spite changes in social networks to encourage broader information
sharing [34]. Finally, these trends have only been accelerated by
recent revelations following the Snowden disclosures, with numer-
ous headlines reminding Internet users that their online behavior is
under constant scrutiny by NSA and other entities.
All these have contributed to the rapid rise of a new wave of
privacy-preserving communication and social networking tools.
These fast-growing services are pseudo-anonymous messaging mo-
bile applications: SnapChat made headlines for ensuring that pho-
tos self-destruct in a few seconds; Whisper allows users to anony-
mously post their thoughts to a public audience; and Secret allows
users to share content with friends without revealing their own iden-
tity. This is just the tip of the iceberg, as many similar services are
popping up with increasing frequency, e.g., Tinder, Yik-yak, and
Wickr.
The anonymous nature of these communication tools has drawn
both strong supporters as well as vocal critics. Supporters believe
that they provide valuable outlets for whistleblowers avoiding pros-
ecution, and allow users to express themselves without fear of bul-
lying or abuse [40, 41]. Critics argue that the lack of accountability
in these networks enables and encourages negative discourse, in-
cluding personal attacks, threats, and rumor spreading [2, 4]. Yet
all parties agree that these tools have had a dramatic impact on how
users interact and communicate.
In this paper, we describe our experience and ﬁndings in our
effort to study pseudo-anonymous social networks, through a de-
tailed measurement and analysis of Whisper. Whisper is a mobile
app that allows users to post and reply to public messages on top of
an image (e.g. Internet memes), all using anonymous user identi-
ﬁers. Whisper does not associate any personal identiﬁable informa-
tion with user IDs, does not archive any user history, and does not
support persistent social links between users. These design choices
are the polar opposite of those in networks such as Facebook. Yet
they have made Whisper one of the most popular new social net-
works, with more than 3 billion page views per month1. As our
working dataset, we captured 100% of the Whisper data stream for
a 3-month period starting in February 2014, including more than 24

137million whispers and replies written by more than 1 million unique
users.
We focus our study on the net impact of anonymity in Whisper,
compared to traditional social media with veriﬁed identities and so-
cial links. Given the large differences between Whisper and current
leaders such as Facebook and LinkedIn, our analysis can have sig-
niﬁcant implications on future infrastructures for social networks,
issues of user privacy in messaging networks, and our understand-
ing of social behavior. More concretely, our study also sheds light
on the long-term sustainability of anonymous communication net-
works, given the removal of persistent social links, often considered
key to the “stickiness” of today’s networks.
Our analysis provides several key ﬁndings.
• First, we seek to understand user interactions in the absence
of social links. We build interaction graphs and compare
them with those of traditional social networks like Twitter
and Facebook. Not surprisingly, we ﬁnd that user commu-
nication patterns show high dispersion, low clustering, sig-
niﬁcantly different from prior systems. Per user, we observe
that “friends” are highly ephemeral, and strong, long-term
friendships are rare.
• Second, our study of user activity over time shows that a con-
stant stream of new users contribute signiﬁcantly to content
generation, and users bifurcate clearly into short-lived (1-2
days) and long-term users. We demonstrate that users can be
accurately classiﬁed into either group by applying ML tech-
niques to only 1 week’s worth of activity history.
• Third, we study the question of abusive content through anal-
ysis of “deleted whispers.” We show that most deleted whis-
pers focus on adult content, and Whisper’s moderation team
usually deletes offensive whispers within a short time after
initial posting.
• Finally, we identiﬁed a signiﬁcant attack that exposes cur-
rent Whisper users to detailed location tracking. We describe
the attack in detail and our experiments. Note that we have
already notiﬁed Whisper of this vulnerability, and they are
taking active steps to mitigate the problem.
To the best of our knowledge, our work is the ﬁrst detailed study
on Whisper and pseudo-anonymous messaging systems as a group.
Their rapid user growth on mobile platforms suggests they may of-
fer a real challenge to today’s established OSNs. We believe our
initial work sheds light on these systems as new platforms for in-
terpersonal communication, and provides insight into designs for
network infrastructures to support Whisper and similar services.
2. BACKGROUND AND GOALS
In this section, we brieﬂy describe background information about
the Whisper network, followed by a high level summary of the
goals of our study.
2.1 Background: the Whisper Network
Whisper.sh is a two-year old smartphone app that has become a
leader in a new wave of pseudo-anonymous messaging and social
communication services, including Snapchat, Secret, Tinder, Yik-
yak, Ether and Wickr. While detailed functionality may vary, these
services generally provide ways for users to make statements, share
secrets or gossip, all while remaining anonymous and untrackable.
As a mobile-only service, Whisper allows users to send mes-
sages, receive replies using anonymous nicknames. It has grown
tremendously in popularity since launching in 2012, and averages
more than 3 billion monthly page views as of early 2014 [16]. The

functionality is very simple: the app overlays each user’s short text
message on top of a background image based on keywords from the
message (Figure 1). The resulting whisper is posted to the public
with the user’s random or self-chosen nickname. Others can heart
(Whisper’s version of “like”) a message anonymously, or post a
public followup reply with their own whisper. In addition, users
can send private messages to the author of a whisper to start a chat,
and private messages are only visible to the participants.
User Anonymity. Whisper’s focus on anonymity breaks some
of the core assumptions made in traditional social networks like
Facebook or Google+. First, Whisper users are identiﬁed only by
randomly assigned (or user-chosen) nicknames, not associated with
any personal information, e.g., phone numbers or email addresses2.
Second, Whisper servers only store public Whispers, and users’
private messages are only stored on their end user devices. There
is no functionality to search or browse a speciﬁc user’s historical
whispers or replies. Third, there is no notion of a persistent social
link between users (e.g., friends on Facebook, followers on Twit-
ter). Thus users are encouraged to interact with a wide range of
strangers instead of a known group of “friends.”
Public Feeds. Without social links, users browse content from
several public lists instead of the news feed of their friends (or fol-
lowees). These lists include a latest list which contains the most
recent whispers (system-wise); a nearby list which shows whispers
posted in nearby areas (about 40 miles of radius range); a popu-
lar list which only shows top whispers that receive many likes and
replies; and featured list which shows a subset of popular whispers
that are hand-picked by Whisper’s content managers. All these lists
sort content by most recent ﬁrst.
2.2 Goals
In its current form, Whisper represents an ideal opportunity to
study the impact of pseudo-anonymity on social networks. Three
key properties make it ideal for study and analysis. First, Whisper
is centralized, i.e.
there is a single stream of data accessible to
all users. Second, Whisper is amenable to periodic data gathering,
i.e. content is unencrypted and persistent for a moderate amount
of time. Third, we were able to meet Whisper’s management team,
and received permission to gather and analyze Whisper’s public
data stream.
2On the server side, Whisper associates new users with a globally
unique identiﬁer (GUID), and binds it to the DeviceID of user’s
phone. Users can transfer their accounts (private message history)
when switching to new phones via iCloud.
138At a high level, our primary goals are to understand how users
communicate on pseudo-anonymous social networks, how anonymity
affects user behavior, and its consequences on user interactions,
long term user engagement, and network stability. Beyond basic
analysis of the Whisper network structure, we can solidify our goals
into several speciﬁc questions. First, how do whisper users inter-
act in an anonymous environment, and do they form communities
similar to those in traditional social networks? Second, does Whis-
per’s lack of identities eliminate strong ties between users, and does
it eliminate the stickiness critical to long term user engagement in
traditional social networks? And given the lack of user-speciﬁc net-
work effects, is it possible to model and predict user engagement
using short term history cues? Finally, what are the implications of
pseudo-anonymity on user content and user privacy?
3. DATA AND INITIAL ANALYSIS
Before diving into our analysis of Whisper, we ﬁrst describe our
data collection methodology and collected datasets. We then de-
scribe some high level analyses of our dataset.
3.1 Data Collection
Our goal is to collect whispers and their replies posted in the
entire network. Given that Whisper does not archive historical data,
our method is to keep crawling newly posted whispers over a long
period (February to May 2014). We focus on the “latest” list, which
is a public stream of the latest whispers from all Whisper users.
Unlike other public lists e.g., “nearby” and “popular”, the “latest”
list provides access to the entire stream of whispers in the network.
Since Whisper does not provide a third-party API, we crawl the
“latest” list by scrapping Whisper’s website.
Each downloaded whisper includes a whisperID, timestamp, plain
text of the whisper, author’s GUID, author’s nickname, a location
tag, and number of received likes and replies. An author’s GUID
was not intended to act as a persistent ID for each user, but was
implemented that way due to Whisper’s dependency on a third-
party service for private messages. Authors’ GUIDs make it pos-
sible to track a user’s posts over time. After we reported this issue
to Whisper’s management team, they removed the GUID ﬁeld in
June 2014. The location tag shows user location at the city and
state level (e.g., Los Angeles, California), and is available only if
the whisper author enabled location sharing permission. Replies
to a whisper are similar, the only difference is that replies are also
marked with the whisperID of the previous whisper in the thread.
Crawling. We implemented a distributed web crawler with two
components, a main crawler that pulls the latest whisper list, and a
reply crawler that checks past whispers and collects all sequences
of replies associated with an existing whisper. We observe that
Whisper servers keep a queue of the latest 10K whispers. Running
the main crawler every 30 minutes ensures that we capture all new
whispers. In contrast, crawling for replies is more computationally
intensive. We crawl for replies every 7 days, and check for new
replies for all whispers written in the last month. In practice, we
observe that whispers usually receive no followup replies 1 week
after being posted.
We ran our crawler from February 6 to May 1, 2014. During this
period of roughly 3 months, we collected 9,343,590 total Whispers
with 15,268,964 replies and 1,038,364 unique GUIDs. Thanks to
server side queues, we collected a continuous data stream despite
a small number of interruptions to update crawler code. The only
point of note is that, at Whisper’s request on April 20, we shifted
our crawlers to crawl a different Whisper server using a new set
of API calls. The shift reduced load for Whisper, but produced

whispers without location tags. Since this only affected 10 days of
data, we believe this has little impact on our analysis of location-
based features.
Validating Consistency.
We further verify the completeness
of the “latest” stream using a small experiment. We use HTTP re-
quests to simultaneously crawl the “nearby” streams of 6 locations
near different cities: Seattle, Houston, Los Angeles, New York, San
Francisco and Chicago. We capture these streams for 6 hours, and
conﬁrm that the 2000+ whispers from 6 locations were all present
in the “latest” stream during the same timeframe.
Limitations.
There are two types of data our measurements do
not capture. First, we do not capture users who only read/consume
whispers but never post any content. Since these passive users do
not generate visible user interactions, they are unlikely to affect the
majority of our conclusions. Second, our data is limited to visible
public data, and we do not have access to private messages between
users. Thus our results represent a lower bound on user interac-
tions in the system. As we discuss later, we believe there should
be strong correlation between public interactions and private mes-
sages.
3.2 Preliminary Analysis
Next we present some high level results on our dataset of whis-
pers, replies and users. Our results in this section set the context
for more detailed analysis on user behavior and anonymity in later
sections.
Whispers Over Time.
We begin by looking at whisper posts
over time. Figure 2 shows number of new whispers and replies
posted every day during our study. As shown, new content in Whis-
per is relatively stable, averaging 100K new whispers and 200K
replies per day. One interesting observation is that in any time
frame, there are signiﬁcantly more replies than there are original
whispers.
During our data collection, we found that a signiﬁcant portion
of whispers is deleted by either the author or Whisper moderators.
As far as we can determine, old Whispers do not “expire” and stay
on Whisper servers, and can be referenced by following a chain of
replies. For deleted whispers, however, we receive an “the whisper
does not exist” error when we try to re-crawl their replies. Among
the 100K new whispers posted every day, roughly 18% are eventu-
ally deleted. We analyze deleted whispers in detail later in §6.
Replies.
Users can post replies to a new whisper or other
replies. Multiple replies can generate their own replies, thereby
forming a tree structure with the original whisper as the root. Fig-
ure 3 and Figure 4 show total replies per whisper and the longest
chain length (maximum tree depth) per whisper. Unsurprisingly,
55% of whispers receive no replies. Since all whispers are posted
to the same public lists, each whisper only has a short time window
