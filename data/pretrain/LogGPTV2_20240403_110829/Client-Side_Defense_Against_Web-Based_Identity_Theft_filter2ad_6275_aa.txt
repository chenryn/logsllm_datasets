## Abstract
Web spoofing is a significant problem involving fraudulent emails and websites that trick unsuspecting users into revealing private information. This paper discusses common aspects of these attacks and proposes a client-side defense framework: a browser plugin that examines web pages and warns the user when data requests may be part of a spoof attack. The plugin, SpoofGuard, has been tested using actual sites obtained through government agencies. We expect that web spoofing and other forms of identity theft will continue to be major issues in the coming years.

## 1. Introduction
Web spoofing, also known as "phishing" or "carding," is a significant form of Internet crime targeting hundreds or thousands of individuals daily. According to the US Secret Service and the San Francisco Electronic Crimes Task Force, approximately 30 attack sites are detected each day. Each site can defraud hundreds or thousands of victims, and many attack sites likely go undetected. A typical web spoof attack begins with bulk emails to unsuspecting victims, claiming an issue with their account at a legitimate site like E*Trade. Victims follow a link to a spoofed E*Trade site, where they enter their username and password, allowing the criminal to impersonate them and potentially withdraw money from their account or cause other harm.

We describe common characteristics of recent web spoofing attacks and propose a framework for client-side countermeasures. Our approach involves detecting characteristics of previously identified attacks, similar to virus detection and email spam filtering. We experiment with this approach using a browser plugin called SpoofGuard. The plugin monitors a user's Internet activity, computes a spoof index, and warns the user if the index exceeds a selected threshold. While internet-savvy users who carefully check the address bar and other information may not need SpoofGuard, it can help less sophisticated users. If widely deployed, phishers will likely take steps to circumvent such defenses, but further effort and study can produce better defenses. Synergistic server-side methods could also help thwart increasingly sophisticated attacks.

### Key Features of SpoofGuard
- **Domain Name and URL Analysis:** SpoofGuard evaluates the likelihood of a page being part of a spoof attack by analyzing domain names and URLs. For example, a URL like `etrade-maintenance.suspicious.org` or `PI:EMAIL/maintainance.asp` with an E*Trade logo would have a higher spoof index.
- **User History:** SpoofGuard considers whether the user has visited the domain before and if the referring page was from an email site like Hotmail or Yahoo!Mail.
- **Post Data Evaluation:** The plugin intercepts and evaluates user posts, checking fields like usernames and passwords against previously entered data from different domains. It uses a cryptographically secure hash to ensure plaintext passwords are never stored.

### Comparison to Other Security Measures
Stopping web spoofing is similar to intrusion detection, spam filtering, and thwarting traditional social engineering attacks. Intrusion detection systems typically monitor network and host activity, compute indices, and detect intrusions by comparing current activity to previous statistics. While web spoofing can be seen as a special case of intrusion detection, a browser plugin is more effective because it has access to both honest and spoof pages sent over HTTPS. A plugin alone does not have full information from email programs like Outlook or Eudora, but it can scan and parse pages from email sites like Hotmail or Yahoo!Mail, making it useful for non-expert users who read email through their browser.

### Evaluation
Like other intrusion detection efforts, SpoofGuard's effectiveness is evaluated by measuring its ability to prevent attacks, the false alarm rate, and its performance impact. We have tested SpoofGuard over time and found it effective in catching sample attacks without adding noticeable delays to web browsing. A good general spam solution could reduce the incidence of web spoofing, but current spam solutions are only partially effective, and there are no specific spam efforts aimed at identity theft. Browser-based techniques are complementary and independent of spam filtering, but combining email scanning with web page analysis could lead to better spoof prevention in the future.

### Previous Efforts
Previous work by the Princeton Secure Internet Programming group and others has addressed a different form of web spoofing, where an attacker causes all HTML page requests from a victim to pass through the attacker's site. These methods focused on maintaining the integrity of browser indicators like the URL in the status bar, rather than analyzing user behavior and web pages to stop sensitive information leakage. We use the term "web spoofing" as it is commonly used by law enforcement and concerned companies.

The goals of this paper are to raise awareness of the web spoofing problem and propose a framework for client-side protection. While sophisticated attackers can circumvent current tests, there is room for improving specific tests and tuning the coefficients of our spoof index function. We discuss the web spoofing problem in more detail in Section 2, our solutions in Section 3, the SpoofGuard implementation and user interface in Section 4, evaluation information in Section 5, suggestions for server-side methods in Section 6, speculative client-side methods in Section 7, and concluding remarks in Section 8.

### Terminology
- **Spoof Site or Spoof Page:** A malicious copy of a legitimate web page.
- **Attacker:** The person or organization setting up the spoof site.
- **Honest Site or Honest Page:** The legitimate site or page being spoofed.
- **Spoof Index:** A measure of the likelihood that a specific page is part of a spoof attack, described in Section 3.

A prototype version of SpoofGuard will be made publicly available shortly.

## 2. The Problem
According to the U.S. Secret Service San Francisco Electronic Crimes Task Force, the U.S. Governmentâ€™s Internet Fraud Complaint Center received over 75,000 complaints in 2002, with 48,000 cases resulting in further action requests. This is a three-fold increase over 2001, with total dollar losses estimated at more than $54 million compared to $17 million in 2001. A majority of these fraud complaints are intrusions, auction fraud, credit card/debit fraud, and computer intrusion. Web spoofing was first noticed in late 2001 and grew in popularity in 2002, correlating with the large increase in Internet fraud. A majority of the $37 million increase in losses from 2001 to 2002 can be attributed to web spoofing. Agents working fraud cases in the Bay Area report that a majority of their Internet cases involve web spoofing.

One factor that exacerbates web spoofing attacks is that many users use the same username and password across multiple sites. This allows a phisher to use stolen credentials on more than one site. Companies providing password-protected services are thus dependent on each other for security. If passwords from one site can be stolen, they can be used at other sites with more robust password protection.

### 2.1 Sample Attack
A recent attack described in a New York Times article involved fraudulent emails with the subject "Fraud Alert" sent to Best Buy customers. The emails claimed that Best Buy's fraud department required additional customer information. The email provided a link to a "special Fraud Department" page, which actually pointed to a fraudulent page. The spoof page resembled an official Best Buy page, using the Best Buy logo and elements from an official page, and requested the customer's social security number and credit card information.

### 2.2 Properties of Recent Attacks
We describe common properties of ten spoof web sites recently found:

- **Logos:** Spoof sites use logos from the honest site to imitate its appearance.
- **Suspicious URLs:** Spoof sites are located on servers unrelated to the honest site. The URL may contain the honest site's URL as a substring (e.g., `http://www.ebaymode.com`) or be similar (e.g., `http://www.paypaI.com`). IP addresses are sometimes used to disguise the host name (e.g., `http://25255255255/top.htm`).
- **User Input:** All spoof sites contain messages to fool the user into entering sensitive information, such as passwords, social security numbers, etc. Some successful spoofs even ask for names, addresses, mother's maiden names, and driver's licenses.
- **Short-Lived:** Most spoof sites are available for only a few hours or days, just enough time to defraud a high number of users. Defensive methods that alert users to spoof sites are more effective than reactive methods that attempt to shut down the site.
- **Copies:** Attackers copy HTML from the honest site and make minimal changes. Some spoof pages contain links to images on the honest site, and the names of fields and HTML code remain the same.
- **Sloppiness or Lack of Familiarity with English:** Many spoof pages have misspellings, grammatical errors, and inconsistencies. In the Best Buy scam, the fake web page listed a telephone number with a Seattle area code for a Staten Island, NY, mailing address.
- **HTTPS Uncommon:** Most spoof sites do not use HTTPS, even if the honest site does.
