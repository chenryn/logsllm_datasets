similar path as other authoritarian governments, giving monopoly control to a state-
controlled firm.233 The reason is simple – if one entity controls all gateways in and 
out of the country, surveillance is much easier, and the government can charge 
whatever price it desires.
In many countries, a major challenge for the government is the speed with which 
millions of its citizens have connected to the web. In 2001, there were just 1 million 
Internet users in Iran; today that number has increased to over 8 million.234
Former president Ali Mohammad Khatami stated that the Iranian government has 
tried to have the “minimum necessary” control over the Internet. Moreover, while 
Muslim values are emphasized, only sites that are “truly insulting” towards Islam 
are censored, and political opposition sites are accessible.
However, the OpenNet Initiative estimates that about one-third of all Internet sites, 
most often relating to politics, pornography, translation, and anonymizing software, 
are blocked by the Iranian government. Websites are more likely to be blocked if 
they are in Farsi than in English. In fact, in Iran it is technically illegal to access “non-
Islamic” websites, and the maximum penalties for doing so include severe punish-
ments. In addition, Iranian ISPs are required to install web- and email-filtering tools.
Human rights groups, such as Reporters Without Borders, argue that since 2006 
all Iranian websites have had to register with the authorities to demonstrate that 
they do not contain prohibited content. And many popular international sites, such 
as photo-sharing FlickR and video-sharing YouTube, are inaccessible for reasons 
of “immorality.”235 Iranian media publications are not legally allowed to contradict 
government goals. Media receive a list of banned subjects each week, and there is a 
dedicated press court.
On March 14, 2011, UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon stated that he was “deeply 
troubled by reports of increased executions, amputations, arbitrary arrests, unfair 
trials, and possible torture and ill-treatment of human rights activists, lawyers, jour-
nalists, and opposition activists”  in Iran. No UN human rights investigators have 
been allowed to visit the country since 2005. Since June 12, 2009, about 20 foreign

234 Iran has a population of almost 80 million, 18th on the world list, but it has just 120,000 Internet-
connected computers, good for 75th in the world (CIA World Factbook, 9 March, 2011).

journalists and correspondents have been expelled from Iran. A dozen were stripped 
of their press cards following a demonstration in February 2011 that was organized 
to support the revolution in Egypt. Abdolreza Tajik, the 2010 RSF-FNAC press free-
dom prize recipient, was given a six-year jail term.236
During the early-2011 unrest across the Middle East, Iranian authorities increased 
surveillance in cyberspace. In order to obstruct anti-government protests in Feb-
ruary 2011, independent and pro-opposition websites, including www.fararu.com 
and sahamnews.org, were blocked. Prior to anti-regime demonstrations, broadband 
speed has slowed down enormously. Mobile phone and text-message traffic was 
disrupted. Satellite TV broadcasts, especially relating to news about the revolution 
in Egypt, were jammed. Finally, in an effort to reduce the number of calls for protest, 
the name of the Persian month “bahman” (roughly corresponding to February 2011) 
was censored.237
Iranian citizens are Internet savvy, and this should hinder government attempts to 
control Iranian cyberspace in the future. Since 2000, blogging has become both a 
mainstream and an alternative form of communication, and even President Mahmud 
Ahmadinejad has his own blog. In August 2004, when a number of reformist news 
sites were blocked, their content was quickly mirrored on other domains. An anony-
mous system administrator posted an alleged official blacklist of banned sites. And 
reformist Iranian legislators have openly complained about censorship, even post-
ing their criticisms online.
In the Internet age, the power of communications within civil society to overwhelm 
government stability has risen to new heights. In a classic coup d’état, the national 
television, radio station and printing press were among the first paramilitary objec-
tives. But the Internet has changed the rules of the game.  Now anyone who owns 
a personal computer and a connection to the Internet possesses both a printing 
press and a radio transmitter in their own home. Furthermore, the entire world is 
potentially their audience.
Authoritarian governments, within their borders, will attempt to pare down the In-
ternet to a manageable size, both in terms of physical infrastructure (e.g., no un-
monitored Internet cafes) and information content (censorship). Common laws gov-

erning information and communications technology (ICT) are likely to include the 
following:
• all Internet accounts must be officially registered with the state,
• all Internet activity must be directly attributable to individual accounts,
• users may not share or sell Internet connections, and
• users may not encrypt their communications.
Clearly the Internet is a powerful tool in the hands of a despot. Through a monop-
oly of state-owned and operated telecommunications, the government can conduct 
country-wide and international ICT surveillance,238 including information manipula-
tion, even with some plausible deniability. Further, the government has an effective 
means to deliver political messages directly to its citizens, while at the same time 
denying that opportunity to rival political factions. Thus, network security designed 
for law enforcement purposes can be used not only to catch criminals but also to 
target political adversaries.
A challenge for any government – including those run by dictators – is to find a 
balance between too much and too little freedom of information. Although govern-
ments must be given appropriate law enforcement powers, there may be tempta-
tions to abuse them, and risks will follow.
Governments like those in North Korea are doomed to fail eventually. The Internet 
– and human beings – thrive on the open exchange of information. If civil society 
is not given sufficient freedom to flourish, the regime will die. In the Internet era, 
choking online freedom likely also entails choking long-term economic prospects, 
which will in turn threaten political stability.
In the next chapter, the author has translated a first-person account, written in Rus-
sian by a Belarusian computer expert, which examines the ongoing battle in cyber-
space between government authorities and civil society in Belarus.

Case Study: Belarus239
Foreword by Kenneth Geers240
Life in Belarus has not changed much since the Cold War. In 2001, U.S. Secretary of 
State Colin Powell called its autocratic President, Alexander Lukashenko, Europe’s 
“lone outlaw.”241
The Belarusian Presidential Administration directly controls nearly all media within 
the country.242 There are fewer than 10 professional quality printing presses outside 
of state control.243 Television and radio stations try to avoid news programming alto-
gether – for fear of losing their license – and even Russian TV is heavily censored.244 
In 2005, Freedom House ranked only Turkmenistan lower than Belarus in terms of 
democracy among the countries of the former Soviet Union.245
The state-owned Beltelecom monopoly is the sole provider of telephone and Internet 
connectivity, although about 30 national ISPs connect through Beltelecom. The only 
reported independent Internet link is via the government’s academic and research 
network, BasNet. Strict government controls are enforced on all telecommunica-
tions technologies; for example, transceiver satellite antennas and IP telephony are 
prohibited. Beltelecom has been accused of “persecution by permit” and of requiring 
a demonstration of political loyalty to access its services. At least one Belarusian 
journalist is reported to have “disappeared.”246
As in Zimbabwe, the Beltelecom monopoly status is intended not only for govern-
ment oversight, but also to maximize financial gain. It is the primary source of rev-
enue for the Ministry of Communications (MIC).247
The State Center for Information Security (GCBI), in charge of domestic signals intel-
ligence (SIGINT), controls the “.by” Top Level Domain (TLD) and thus manages both 
the national Domain Name Service (DNS) and website access in general. Formerly 
239 Following the Foreword, this chapter is a translation by the author of a Russian language paper writ-
ten by Fedor Pavluchenko of www.charter97.org, entitled “Belarus in the Context of European Cyber 
Security,” which was presented at the 2009 Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence Confer-
ence on Cyber Warfare.

part of the Belarusian KGB, GCBI reports directly to President Lukashenko.248 De-
partment  “K” (for Кибер or Cyber), within the Ministry of Interior, has the lead in 
pursuing cyber crime. A common media offense in Belarus is defaming the “honor 
and dignity” of state officials249.
Belarus already has a significant history of political battles in cyberspace. In 2001, 
2003, 2004, and 2005, Internet access problems were experienced by websites that 
were critical of the President, state referenda, and/or national elections. While the 
government announced that website availability problems were the result of access 
“overload,” the opposition countered that the sites were inaccessible altogether, and 
that the regime was deliberately blocking access. One of the affected sites had been 
characterized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as “political pornography”.250
The biggest cyber showdown took place during the March 2006 Belarusian presi-
dential elections, during which the opposition tried to use its youth and computer 
savvy to organize in cyberspace. The sitting government attempted the same, but 
because its supporters consisted of many rural and elderly voters who were still 
unconnected or new to the Internet, its efforts were uphill at best.251
Election Day 2006 provided the world an infamous example of modern-day cyber 
politics. As Belarusians went to the polls on March 19, thirty-seven opposition me-
dia websites were inaccessible from Beltelecom.252 “Odd” DNS (Internet address) er-
rors were reported, and the website of the main opposition candidate, Aleksandr 
Milinkevich, was “dead.”
President Lukashenko won the election by a wide margin. A week later, as anti-
government protestors clashed with riot police, the Internet was inaccessible from 
Minsk telephone numbers. A month later, when an opposition “flash-mob” was or-
ganized over the Internet, arriving participants were promptly arrested by waiting 
policemen.253
Similar to Iran, a primary lesson from Belarus is that Internet filtering and govern-
ment surveillance do not have to be comprehensive to be effective. Selective target-
ing of known adversaries and increased computer network operations at critical 
points in time, such as during elections, can be very useful to a sitting government.

BIRTH OF A CONCEPT: STRATEGIC CYBER SECURITY
“Belarus in the Context of European Cyber Security”
Written in Russian by Fedor Pavluchenko (www.charter97.org)
Translated to English by Kenneth Geers
During the first decade of the 21st century, Internet censorship in Belarus has 
become a government tool used to combat political dissent. This ongoing cyber 
conflict between state and non-state actors is similar to the struggle between the 
Russian government and its domestic adversaries in cyberspace.
State-sponsored, politically-motivated Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks against civil 
society are unacceptable. In Belarus, this violation of freedom of expression has 
become a national crisis. But the problem is not confined within these borders; it 
threatens the integrity of Internet resources in other European countries as well.
Modern technology offers the world significantly improved communications, but it 
also creates novel threats. Governments can abuse their power over state-controlled 
infrastructures. This not only violates human rights, but it engenders long-term 
political instability. Democratic states in Europe should work to strengthen inde-
pendent Internet institutions and extend the rule of law to the whole of European 
cyberspace.
Alexander Lukashenko has governed Belarus as an autocrat since a disputed politi-
cal referendum in 1996. His government has suppressed freedom of speech, and 
for over a decade there has been virtually no independent media in Belarus. The 
popular newspapers of the 1990s have ceased to exist or have seen their circulation 
greatly reduced, and independent radio stations have been closed. Sadly, there has 
never been an independent Belarusian television channel.
The Internet, despite its high cost in Belarus, has unsurprisingly become the only 
source of objective information for the majority of the citizens. The number of web 
users has now grown to nearly one-quarter of the country’s population.
The Charter ‘97 website has been a leading Belarusian venue for public policy dis-
cussion for over a decade. However, because Charter ‘97 is known for siding with Be-
larusian political dissidents, the site has been the target of myriad state-sponsored 
Internet information-blocking strategies.
September 9, 2001: Belarusian Internet users discovered the power of a govern-
ment to wage cyber warfare against its own citizens on the day of its own national 
presidential elections. At 1200, Beltelecom blocked access to many popular political 
websites. Although the prohibited sites remained accessible outside Belarus, no one 
in Belarus could view them until the following afternoon at 1600, when the Internet 
“filtering” stopped.
75
Cyber Security: Real-World Impact
From a technical perspective, this type of Internet censorship is easy for a telecom-
munications monopoly to perform. The data packets can be filtered at a government 
Internet Service Provider’s (ISP) network router, based solely on the Internet Proto-
col (IP) address of the websites in question.
However, it can be equally simple for an Internet user or the censored website to un-
derstand exactly what is happening. For example, the “traceroute” computer network 
utility, which measures the paths and transit times of packets across networks, can 
be used to spot the exact point of network interruption.
Some of the prohibited sites were hosted on servers in Belarus, within the “.by” 
Top Level Domain (TLD). These sites were disabled by altering their Domain Name 
Service (DNS) records to make them inaccessible. This is possible because “.by” is 
administered by the Operations and Analysis Center, a special state agency that falls 
under the direct control of the Belarusian President. On September 9, 2001, the fol-
lowing domains were unreachable on the Belarusian web: home.by, minsk.by, org.by, 
unibel.by, nsys.by, and bdg.by.
Numerous websites, including www.charter97.org, responded by creating “mirrors” 
or copies of their content at other web addresses in an effort to stay online. All 
such mirrors were promptly blocked by the government. Furthermore, websites that 
specialize in obscuring the source and destination of web searches, such as “ano-
nymizers” and “proxy” servers, were also blocked. In all, over 100 websites were 
inaccessible.
It is important to note that within Belarusian law there were no legal grounds to 
perform censorship of political content on the web. What happened in 2001 directly 
violated the constitution. Beltelekom and the Belarus Ministry of Communications 
both announced that the outage stemmed from too many Belarusians trying to ac-
cess the affected sites at the same time, and that this led to a self-inflicted Denial of 
Service. But this story is easy to disprove via simple technical analysis.
For its part, Belarusian government leadership had no comment, even though Inter-
net censorship and computer sabotage are an offense under Belarusian law. Further-
more, there was never any official investigation into the facts of this case.
October 24, 2001: The Charter ’97 website was completely deleted from its web 
server by an unidentified computer hacker. A few days after the attack, under pres-
sure from the Belarusian secret services, our hosting company broke the terms of 
our contract. www.charter97.org was no longer allowed space on its server.
January 20, 2004: For the first time, Charter ’97 was the target of a Distributed 
Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. The DDoS followed our publication of a journalistic 
investigation into a possible connection between high-ranking officials from the Be-
76
BIRTH OF A CONCEPT: STRATEGIC CYBER SECURITY
larusian Interior Ministry – which is responsible for investigating computer crimes 
– and the trading of online child pornography.
The DDoS attack lasted more than three weeks and was supported by a botnet that 
comprised more than 55,000 active IP addresses. This network of infected comput-
ers spanned the globe and included machines in Latin America, the United States, 
South-East Asia, China, and India. The source IPs and intensity of the attack changed 
several times, which indicated an active command and control (C2) over the activity.
Of course, it is impossible to prove that the DDoS attack was politically motivated, 
but external simultaneous factors corroborate this theory. On state television, a 
campaign of harassment targeted the employees of Charter ’97. Among other things, 
the employees themselves were accused of trading in online pornography. In addi-
tion, Natalya Kolyada, a human rights activist working with the site, was convicted 
on misdemeanor charges.
July 14-21, 2004: On July 14, for 2 hours, a cyber attack paralyzed the server that 
hosted the Charter ’97 website. It is believed that this event was a “test” to facilitate 
what happened one week later.
On July 21, there were mass protests in Minsk to demonstrate against the 10th anni-
versary of the Lukashenko government. Charter ’97 had planned to host a webcast 
in support of the protests. For the second time, the website came under a DDoS-
attack, which began at 1400 – 4 hours before the demonstrations began – and lasted 
until the political protests were over. This DDoS bore strong similarities to the first 
attack in January of 2004.
