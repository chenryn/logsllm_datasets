### Similar Path as Other Authoritarian Governments

Authoritarian governments often follow a similar path, granting monopoly control to a state-controlled firm. The rationale is straightforward: if a single entity controls all gateways in and out of the country, surveillance becomes much easier, and the government can set whatever price it desires.

### Rapid Internet Adoption

In many countries, one of the major challenges for the government is the rapid pace at which millions of citizens have connected to the web. For instance, in Iran, the number of Internet users grew from just 1 million in 2001 to over 8 million today. This rapid growth has posed significant challenges for the Iranian government in terms of regulation and control.

### Government Control and Censorship

Former President Ali Mohammad Khatami stated that the Iranian government aims to maintain "minimum necessary" control over the Internet. While Muslim values are emphasized, only sites that are "truly insulting" towards Islam are censored, and political opposition sites remain accessible. However, the OpenNet Initiative estimates that about one-third of all Internet sites, particularly those related to politics, pornography, translation, and anonymizing software, are blocked by the Iranian government. Websites in Farsi are more likely to be blocked than those in English. In Iran, accessing "non-Islamic" websites is technically illegal, with severe penalties for violations. Additionally, Iranian ISPs are required to install web- and email-filtering tools.

Human rights groups, such as Reporters Without Borders, argue that since 2006, all Iranian websites have had to register with the authorities to demonstrate that they do not contain prohibited content. Popular international sites like Flickr and YouTube are inaccessible due to "immorality." Iranian media publications are not legally allowed to contradict government goals and receive a list of banned subjects each week. There is also a dedicated press court.

### UN Concerns and Media Restrictions

On March 14, 2011, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed deep concern over reports of increased executions, amputations, arbitrary arrests, unfair trials, and possible torture and ill-treatment of human rights activists, lawyers, journalists, and opposition activists in Iran. No UN human rights investigators have been allowed to visit the country since 2005. Since June 12, 2009, about 20 foreign journalists and correspondents have been expelled from Iran. Following a demonstration in February 2011 supporting the revolution in Egypt, a dozen journalists were stripped of their press cards. Abdolreza Tajik, the 2010 RSF-FNAC press freedom prize recipient, was sentenced to six years in jail.

### Increased Surveillance and Censorship

During the early-2011 unrest across the Middle East, Iranian authorities intensified surveillance in cyberspace. To obstruct anti-government protests in February 2011, independent and pro-opposition websites, including fararu.com and sahamnews.org, were blocked. Prior to anti-regime demonstrations, broadband speeds were significantly reduced, and mobile phone and text-message traffic were disrupted. Satellite TV broadcasts, especially those covering news about the Egyptian revolution, were jammed. The Persian month "bahman" (corresponding to February 2011) was censored to reduce calls for protest.

### Civil Society and Internet Savviness

Iranian citizens are increasingly savvy in using the Internet, which hinders government attempts to control cyberspace. Since 2000, blogging has become both a mainstream and alternative form of communication. Even President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has his own blog. When reformist news sites were blocked in August 2004, their content was quickly mirrored on other domains. An anonymous system administrator posted an alleged official blacklist of banned sites, and reformist legislators openly criticized censorship online.

### The Power of Communication in the Internet Age

In the Internet age, the power of communication within civil society to challenge government stability has risen to new heights. In a classic coup d’état, national television, radio stations, and printing presses were among the first paramilitary objectives. However, the Internet has changed the rules of the game. Now, anyone with a personal computer and an Internet connection possesses both a printing press and a radio transmitter in their home, with the potential to reach a global audience.

### Authoritarian Governments and Internet Control

Authoritarian governments will attempt to manage the Internet within their borders, both in terms of physical infrastructure (e.g., no unmonitored Internet cafes) and information content (censorship). Common laws governing information and communications technology (ICT) may include:

- All Internet accounts must be officially registered with the state.
- All Internet activity must be directly attributable to individual accounts.
- Users may not share or sell Internet connections.
- Users may not encrypt their communications.

The Internet is a powerful tool in the hands of a despot. Through a monopoly of state-owned and operated telecommunications, the government can conduct nationwide and international ICT surveillance, including information manipulation, with some plausible deniability. The government can deliver political messages directly to its citizens while denying that opportunity to rival factions. Network security designed for law enforcement can be used to target political adversaries.

### Balancing Freedom and Control

A challenge for any government, including dictatorships, is to find a balance between too much and too little freedom of information. While governments need appropriate law enforcement powers, there is a risk of abuse. Governments like those in North Korea are doomed to fail eventually because the Internet and human beings thrive on the open exchange of information. If civil society is not given sufficient freedom to flourish, the regime will collapse. In the Internet era, choking online freedom also chokes long-term economic prospects, threatening political stability.

### Case Study: Belarus

**Foreword by Kenneth Geers**

Life in Belarus has not changed much since the Cold War. In 2001, U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell called its autocratic President, Alexander Lukashenko, Europe’s "lone outlaw."

The Belarusian Presidential Administration directly controls nearly all media within the country. There are fewer than 10 professional-quality printing presses outside of state control. Television and radio stations avoid news programming for fear of losing their licenses, and even Russian TV is heavily censored. In 2005, Freedom House ranked Belarus lower than Turkmenistan in terms of democracy among the former Soviet Union countries.

The state-owned Beltelecom monopoly is the sole provider of telephone and Internet connectivity, although about 30 national ISPs connect through Beltelecom. The only reported independent Internet link is via the government’s academic and research network, BasNet. Strict government controls are enforced on all telecommunications technologies; transceiver satellite antennas and IP telephony are prohibited. Beltelecom has been accused of "persecution by permit" and requiring a demonstration of political loyalty to access its services. At least one Belarusian journalist has reportedly "disappeared."

As in Zimbabwe, the Beltelecom monopoly status is intended not only for government oversight but also to maximize financial gain. It is the primary source of revenue for the Ministry of Communications (MIC).

The State Center for Information Security (GCBI), in charge of domestic signals intelligence (SIGINT), controls the ".by" Top Level Domain (TLD) and manages the national Domain Name Service (DNS) and website access. Formerly part of the Belarusian KGB, GCBI reports directly to President Lukashenko. Department "K" (for Кибер or Cyber) within the Ministry of Interior leads in pursuing cybercrime. A common media offense in Belarus is defaming the "honor and dignity" of state officials.

Belarus has a significant history of political battles in cyberspace. In 2001, 2003, 2004, and 2005, websites critical of the President, state referenda, and/or national elections experienced access problems. While the government claimed these issues were due to "overload," the opposition argued that the sites were deliberately blocked. One affected site was characterized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as "political pornography."

The biggest cyber showdown occurred during the March 2006 Belarusian presidential elections, when the opposition tried to use its youth and computer-savvy members to organize in cyberspace. The sitting government attempted the same, but its efforts were limited by its supporters, who were mostly rural and elderly voters unfamiliar with the Internet.

On Election Day 2006, thirty-seven opposition media websites were inaccessible from Beltelecom. "Odd" DNS errors were reported, and the main opposition candidate's website, Aleksandr Milinkevich, was "dead." President Lukashenko won the election by a wide margin. A week later, as anti-government protestors clashed with riot police, the Internet was inaccessible from Minsk telephone numbers. A month later, when an opposition "flash-mob" was organized over the Internet, arriving participants were promptly arrested by waiting policemen.

Similar to Iran, a primary lesson from Belarus is that Internet filtering and government surveillance do not have to be comprehensive to be effective. Selective targeting of known adversaries and increased computer network operations at critical points, such as during elections, can be very useful to a sitting government.

### "Belarus in the Context of European Cyber Security"

**Written in Russian by Fedor Pavluchenko (www.charter97.org)**
**Translated to English by Kenneth Geers**

During the first decade of the 21st century, Internet censorship in Belarus has become a government tool to combat political dissent. This ongoing cyber conflict between state and non-state actors is similar to the struggle between the Russian government and its domestic adversaries in cyberspace.

State-sponsored, politically motivated Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks against civil society are unacceptable. In Belarus, this violation of freedom of expression has become a national crisis. The problem is not confined within these borders; it threatens the integrity of Internet resources in other European countries as well.

Modern technology offers the world significantly improved communications but also creates novel threats. Governments can abuse their power over state-controlled infrastructures, violating human rights and engendering long-term political instability. Democratic states in Europe should work to strengthen independent Internet institutions and extend the rule of law to the whole of European cyberspace.

Alexander Lukashenko has governed Belarus as an autocrat since a disputed political referendum in 1996. His government has suppressed freedom of speech, and for over a decade, there has been virtually no independent media in Belarus. Popular newspapers from the 1990s have ceased to exist or have seen their circulation greatly reduced, and independent radio stations have been closed. There has never been an independent Belarusian television channel.

Despite its high cost, the Internet has become the only source of objective information for the majority of Belarusian citizens. The number of web users has grown to nearly one-quarter of the country’s population.

The Charter '97 website has been a leading Belarusian venue for public policy discussion for over a decade. However, because Charter '97 is known for siding with Belarusian political dissidents, the site has been the target of myriad state-sponsored Internet information-blocking strategies.

**September 9, 2001**: On the day of the national presidential elections, at 1200, Beltelecom blocked access to many popular political websites. Although the prohibited sites remained accessible outside Belarus, no one in Belarus could view them until the following afternoon at 1600, when the Internet "filtering" stopped.

From a technical perspective, this type of Internet censorship is easy for a telecommunications monopoly to perform. The data packets can be filtered at a government Internet Service Provider's (ISP) network router based solely on the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the websites in question. However, it can be equally simple for an Internet user or the censored website to understand exactly what is happening. For example, the "traceroute" computer network utility, which measures the paths and transit times of packets across networks, can be used to spot the exact point of network interruption.

Some of the prohibited sites were hosted on servers in Belarus, within the ".by" Top Level Domain (TLD). These sites were disabled by altering their Domain Name Service (DNS) records to make them inaccessible. This is possible because ".by" is administered by the Operations and Analysis Center, a special state agency under the direct control of the Belarusian President. On September 9, 2001, the following domains were unreachable on the Belarusian web: home.by, minsk.by, org.by, unibel.by, nsys.by, and bdg.by.

Numerous websites, including www.charter97.org, responded by creating "mirrors" or copies of their content at other web addresses to stay online. All such mirrors were promptly blocked by the government. Furthermore, websites that specialize in obscuring the source and destination of web searches, such as "anonymizers" and "proxy" servers, were also blocked. In all, over 100 websites were inaccessible.

It is important to note that within Belarusian law, there were no legal grounds to perform censorship of political content on the web. What happened in 2001 directly violated the constitution. Beltelekom and the Belarus Ministry of Communications both announced that the outage stemmed from too many Belarusians trying to access the affected sites at the same time, leading to a self-inflicted Denial of Service. However, this story is easy to disprove via simple technical analysis.

For its part, Belarusian government leadership had no comment, even though Internet censorship and computer sabotage are offenses under Belarusian law. Furthermore, there was never any official investigation into the facts of this case.

**October 24, 2001**: The Charter '97 website was completely deleted from its web server by an unidentified computer hacker. A few days after the attack, under pressure from the Belarusian secret services, the hosting company broke the terms of the contract, and www.charter97.org was no longer allowed space on its server.

**January 20, 2004**: For the first time, Charter '97 was the target of a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. The DDoS followed the publication of a journalistic investigation into a possible connection between high-ranking officials from the Belarusian Interior Ministry, responsible for investigating computer crimes, and the trading of online child pornography.

The DDoS attack lasted more than three weeks and was supported by a botnet comprising more than 55,000 active IP addresses. This network of infected computers spanned the globe and included machines in Latin America, the United States, South-East Asia, China, and India. The source IPs and intensity of the attack changed several times, indicating active command and control (C2) over the activity.

While it is impossible to prove that the DDoS attack was politically motivated, external simultaneous factors corroborate this theory. On state television, a campaign of harassment targeted the employees of Charter '97. Among other things, the employees themselves were accused of trading in online pornography. Natalya Kolyada, a human rights activist working with the site, was convicted on misdemeanor charges.

**July 14-21, 2004**: On July 14, for 2 hours, a cyber attack paralyzed the server that hosted the Charter '97 website. It is believed that this event was a "test" to facilitate what happened one week later.

On July 21, mass protests in Minsk demonstrated against the 10th anniversary of the Lukashenko government. Charter '97 had planned to host a webcast in support of the protests. For the second time, the website came under a DDoS attack, which began at 1400—4 hours before the demonstrations—and lasted until the political protests were over. This DDoS bore strong similarities to the first attack in January 2004.
