According to the documentation here:
http://celery.readthedocs.org/en/latest/userguide/workers.html#process-signals
I should be able to send a SIGTERM to my running worker process and have it
finish the task it is currently working on before it shuts down. However when
I call sigterm the process exits immediately with the following traceback.
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/edx/app/edxapp/venvs/edxapp/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/billiard/pool.py", line 1171, in mark_as_worker_lost
        human_status(exitcode)),
    WorkerLostError: Worker exited prematurely: signal 15 (SIGTERM).
I'm using Celery 3.1.18 with django 1.4, is there something special that has
to be done to integrate the signal handlers with django?
