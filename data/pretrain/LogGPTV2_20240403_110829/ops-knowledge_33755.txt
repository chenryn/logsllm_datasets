User: Please use Python to write a script that can read Excel files and perform simple analysis on the data
Assistant: The following is a simple Python script that can read Excel files and perform simple data analysis: ```python import pandas as pd # read Excel files data = pd.read_excel('data.xlsx') # view the first five rows of data print(data.head()) # View data statistics summary print(data.describe()) # Calculate mean mean = data.mean() print(mean) # Calculate median median = data.median() print( median) # Calculate the mode mode = data.mode() print(mode) ``` Please note that this script assumes that the name of the Excel file is "data.xlsx" and that the data is after the first row, without headers. If your Excel file has headers or data under different rows and columns, please change the reading method and analysis method in the code accordingly.
