**User:**
I have Eclipse set up with PyDev, and I really appreciate the ability to debug my scripts and applications. I recently started exploring Pylons and was wondering if there is a way to start the Paster server through Eclipse so that I can debug my web application.

**Assistant:**
To start the Paster server from within Eclipse on a Linux system, you will typically find the `paster` script at `/usr/bin/paster` or `/usr/local/bin/paster`. To configure this in Eclipse, you can use the following arguments:

```
serve ${workspace_loc}/${project_path}/development.ini
```

This setup should allow you to run and debug your Pylons web application directly from Eclipse.
