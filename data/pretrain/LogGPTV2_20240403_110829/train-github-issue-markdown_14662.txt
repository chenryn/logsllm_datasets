 **Set alphamap will make transparent material behind invisible**
In the screenshot, an aphamap is applied on the pink patch and set the
transparent = true. The blue patch also set transparent = true. It can be seen
that the part of the blue patch that behind the pink patch is invisible. If
the transparent = false (like purple patch), everything is fine.
