### Describe the bug
Mounting StaticFiles with an APIRouter doesn't work.
### To Reproduce
    from typing import Any
    from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, APIRouter
    from fastapi.staticfiles import StaticFiles
    from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
    router = APIRouter()
    @router.get("/")
    async def foo(request: Request) -> Any:
        # this raises starlette.routing.NoMatchFound
        return request.url_for("static", path="/bar")
    app = FastAPI()
    router.mount("/static", StaticFiles(directory="."), name="static")
    # uncomment to fix
    # app.mount("/static", StaticFiles(directory="."), name="static")
    app.include_router(router)
    client = TestClient(app)
    client.get("/")
  * Execute the script, raises NoMatchFound
  * Uncomment line to mount with app instead
  * Executes as expected
### Expected behavior
I can use APIRouter() as if it was a FastAPI() as noted in the docs.
