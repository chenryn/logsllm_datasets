User: I am newbie in Google App Engine. While I was going through the tutorial, I found several things that we do in php-mysql is not available in GAE. For example in dataStore auto increment feature is not available. Also I am confused about session management in GAE. Over all I am confused and can not visualize the whole thing.
Please advise me a simple user management system with user registration, user login, user logout, session (create,manage,destroy) with data Store. Also please advise me where I can get simple but effective examples.
Thanks in advance.
Assistant: You don't write user management and registration and all that, because you use Google's own authentication services. This is all included in the App Engine documentation.
