User: How to use Ansible to automate deployment and maintenance tasks? Please provide specific steps.
Assistant: Ansible is an automation tool that simplifies the process of deploying, managing, and maintaining large-scale systems. The following are the steps to use Ansible to automate deployment and maintenance tasks: 1. Install Ansible software on the Ansible host * On CentOS, you can use the command `sudo yum install ansible` * On Ubuntu, you can use the command `sudo apt-get install ansible ` 2. Configure the connection between the Ansible host and the target host* On the Ansible host, create an SSH key pair: `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096` * Copy the public key to .ssh/ on the target host In the authorized_keys file: `ssh-copy-id user@server_ip` 3. Create Ansible playbook * playbook is the core component of Ansible, it is a YAML file that specifies the list of tasks to execute and the list of hosts * On the Ansible host, create a New playbook file: `nano /etc/ansible/playbooks/task.yml` * Edit the playbook file and add tasks and host lists that need to be automated 4. Execute Ansible playbook * Use the command `ansible-playbook /etc/ansible/playbooks /task.yml` to execute the playbook * Ansible will connect to the target host and automatically execute the specified tasks 5. Automated deployment * Create a new playbook file, specify the application and configuration files to be deployed, etc. * Combine the tasks in the playbook file with Source code warehouse integration, automatically execute playbook every time the code is updated to achieve automated deployment In short, to use Ansible to automate deployment and maintenance tasks, you must first prepare the connection between the Ansible host and the target host, and then create an Ansible playbook and execute its tasks . At the same time, applications can be deployed automatically to achieve automated operation and maintenance.
