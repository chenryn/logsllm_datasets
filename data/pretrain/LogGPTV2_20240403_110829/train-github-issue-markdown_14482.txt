##### ISSUE TYPE
  * Bug Report
##### ANSIBLE VERSION
2.1
##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
OpenBSD 5.9
##### SUMMARY
Using unarchvie for tar-archives on OpenBSD (and possibly FreeBSD/NetBSD)
causes an error (Unexpected error when accessing exploded file: [Errno 2] No
such file or directory).  
From looking at the ansible 2.0 output it looks like ansible would make use of
the tar argument --diff. OpenBSD and FreeBSD doesn't have an --diff, -d,
--compare option for tar.
It runs fine against any Linux host (tested with CentOS 6.8).
##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
run unarchive with a tar.gz against OpenBSD 5.9
e.g.
  * name: unarchive mmonit  
unarchive:  
copy: no  
creates: /usr/local/mmonit-3.5.1  
dest: /usr/local  
src: https://mmonit.com/dist/mmonit-3.5.1-openbsd-x64.tar.gz
##### EXPECTED RESULTS
Command works
##### ACTUAL RESULTS
Command failed.
fatal: [xxx]: FAILED! => {"changed": false, "failed": true, "msg": "Unexpected
error when accessing exploded file: [Errno 2] No such file or directory:
'/usr/local/mmonit-3.5.1'", "stat": {"exists": false}}  
to retry, use: --limit @site.retry
