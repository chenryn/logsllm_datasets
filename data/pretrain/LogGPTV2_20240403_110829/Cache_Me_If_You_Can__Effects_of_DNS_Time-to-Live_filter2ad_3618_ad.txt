# Datasets and Resource Record (RR) Counts (Child Authoritative)

**Table 5: Datasets and RR counts (child authoritative)**

This table shows the number of resource records (RRs) for various datasets, including the root zone, top-level domains (TLDs), and popular second-level domains (SLDs) from Alexa and Majestic. The "Ratio" column indicates the proportion of unique RRs to the total RRs, and the "TTL (avg)" column provides the average Time-to-Live (TTL) values.

## Analysis of TTLs in Authoritative DNS Answers

Figure 9 illustrates the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of TTLs for different record types across each dataset. For TLDs in the root zone, A and AAAA records are reported for their respective name servers (NS). For other lists, only A records for the given domain names are considered. 

### Key Observations:

1. **Variation in TTL Values:**
   - TTLs vary widely, ranging from 1 minute to 48 hours.
   - In the root zone, approximately 80% of records have TTLs of 1 or 2 days.
   - For the Umbrella list, 25% of NS records have TTLs under 1 minute, reflecting the transient nature of cloud and CDN names.

2. **Record Type Trends:**
   - NS and DNSKEY records tend to have the longest TTLs (Figure 9a).
   - IP address records (A and AAAA) have the shortest TTLs (Figures 9b and 9c).

### Factors Influencing TTL Choices:

- **Administrative Actions:**
  - Changing authoritative servers is a deliberate and carefully planned action, leading to longer TTLs for NS and DNSKEY records.
  - IP addresses are often dynamic, with automated creation and deletion in cloud and CDN environments, resulting in shorter TTLs.

- **Service Dynamics:**
  - Cloud and CDN services frequently adjust their configurations based on load and demand, leading to more frequent changes in IP addresses and shorter TTLs.

### Diversity in TTL Choices:

The diversity in TTL choices among major domains suggests a combination of differing operational needs and a lack of consensus on optimal TTL values.

## TTLs and Content Types

In addition to our DNS crawler, we used DMap, an open-source multi-application crawler, to classify .nl domains based on their web content. On January 25, 2019, there were 58,310,209 domain names in the .nl zone, with 4,846,496 (83.1%) having both an A record and a web page.

### Classification Results:

- **Placeholders:**
  - 1,199,152 domains with default hosting provider web pages.
- **E-commerce:**
  - 148,564 domains with shopping cart functionality.
- **Parking:**
  - 127,551 parked domains.

### Median TTL Values:

- **NS Records:**
  - E-commerce: 4.0 hours
  - Parking: 24.0 hours
  - Placeholders: 4.0 hours
- **A and AAAA Records:**
  - E-commerce: 1.0 hour
  - Parking: 1.0 hour
  - Placeholders: 1.0 hour
- **MX and DNSKEY Records:**
  - E-commerce: 1.0 hour
  - Parking: 1.0 hour
  - Placeholders: 1.0 hour

### TTL of 0 Seconds

Setting a TTL to 0 seconds effectively disables caching at resolvers, increasing latency and reducing resilience. Table 8 shows the counts of domains with TTL set to 0 seconds, which are relatively few.

### Bailiwick Configuration in the Wild

Bailiwick configuration affects the choice of TTLs. Out-of-bailiwick servers require explicit fetching of authoritative server addresses, leading to different TTLs provided by parent and child zones.

### Summary of Bailiwick Distribution:

- **Alexa, Majestic, and Umbrella Lists:**
  - Over 90% of domains are configured with out-of-bailiwick NSes.
- **Root Zone:**
  - Approximately half of the TLDs are out-of-bailiwick, while the other half are either in-bailiwick or mixed.

### Discussions with Operators

Our crawl of the root zone revealed that 34 TLDs (including 8 country-code TLDs) have NS TTLs less than 30 minutes, and 122 TLDs have NS TTLs under 120 minutes. These short TTLs are only partially effective due to parent-centric resolvers.

This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the diverse TTL settings and their implications for DNS operations and performance.
