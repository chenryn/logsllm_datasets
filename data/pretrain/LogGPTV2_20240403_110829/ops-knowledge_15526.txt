User: How to conduct security practices for containerized applications? Please list common container security policies and application security testing methods.
Assistant: Commonly used container security policies include: 1. Restrict container permissions: When running containers, restrict container permissions. For example, sandboxing technology can be used to limit the access of containers to the host machine. 2. Install an updated kernel: Install an updated kernel on the host to fix known vulnerabilities. 3. Restrict container network access: By restricting container network access, reduce the risk of being attacked. 4. Use a safe image file: use a good security verified image to avoid unnecessary security risks. Commonly used application security testing methods include: 1. Static analysis tools: Use static analysis tools to scan the code in applications and container images to detect possible vulnerabilities. 2. Dynamic scanning tools: Use dynamic scanning tools to simulate attacks and test the reliability of applications and containers. 3. Simulated attacks: Simulate attacks in a simulated environment to test the security of applications and containers. 4. Security audit: regularly conduct security audits on applications and containers, find vulnerabilities and resolve them as soon as possible.
