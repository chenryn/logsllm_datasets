B QUESTIONS FOR MAIN SURVEY
The following questionnaire was first written in Japanese, and
then translated into English by authors who are native Japanese
speakers with 10 or more years of experience writing research
papers in English. Then, the translated questionnaire was proofread
by a native English speaking proofreader and a Japanese-English
bilingual to avoid any flaws in translation.
Introduction
The purpose of this questionnaire is to analyze security awareness
and behavior in software development project. The contents of the
answers for the questionnaires:
• will be used to analyze constraints that prevent the development
of secure software and to research/develop solutions to such con-
straints.
• may be published as statistical information in academic publica-
tions.
• will be provided only to the organization requesting this survey.
• will be treated as confidential and strictly managed to ensure that
they are not lost or leaked.
Please note that this survey is conducted anonymously and no
personally identifiable information/no organization–identifiable
information will be collected. Also, all questions are optional. If
you do not want to answer a question due to your position or
affiliation, please leave it blank/unselected.
The number of questions: 26
Rewards: Points equivalent to 10 USD in the currency of your
panel.
∗Only for those who answered all the questions.
∗Points will be given in 4 to 6 weeks.
Please proceed only if you agree to the above.
Notes
• The term “project” in this study refers to a plan for the develop-
ment of a software to provide a specific service/product, as well
as a team/group formed for that purpose.
• This survey includes questions about your company and devel-
opment project. If you are currently involved with more than
one company/project, please answer from the standpoint of the
affiliation that you spend the most time working for.
