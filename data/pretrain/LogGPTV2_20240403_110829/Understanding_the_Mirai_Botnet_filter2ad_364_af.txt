5 distinct /8 subnets and one attack on /0 subnet—the
entire IPv4 space. Each of the /8 and /0 subnets, (with
the exception of the local 10.0.0.0/8) contain a large
number of distributed network operators and total IP ad-
dresses, which drastically exceed the number of Mirai
bots. As such, the Mirai attacks against these subnets
likely had modest impact.
If we exclude targeted subnet (due to their unfocused
blanket dispersion across many networks), we ﬁnd that
Mirai victims were distributed across 906 ASes and
85 countries. The targets were heavily concentrated in the
U.S. (50.3%), France (6.6%), the U.K. (6.1%), and a long
tail of other countries. Network distribution was more
evenly spread. The top 3 ASes—OVH (7.8%), Cloud-
ﬂare (6.6%) and Comcast (3.6%)—only accounted for
18.0% of victims.
The three most frequently targeted victims were
Liberia’s Lonestar Cell (4.1%), Sky Network (2.1%), and
1.1.1.1 (1.6%). We examine Lonestar Cell in depth in
Section 6.3. Sky Network is a Brazilian company that
operates servers for Minecraft (a popular game), which is
hosted by Psychz Networks. The attacks against Psychz
began on November 15, 2016 and occurred sporadically
until January 26, 2017. 1.1.1.1 was likely used for test-
ing [95]. Additional game targets in the top 14 victims in-
cluded a former game commerce site longqikeji.com, and
Runescape, another popular online game. The prevalence
of game-related targets along with the broad range of other
otherwise unrelated victims shares many characteristics
with previously studied DDoS booter services [39].
For volumetric and TCP state exhaustion attacks, Mi-
rai optionally speciﬁed a target port, which implied the
type of service targeted. We ﬁnd a similar prevalence
of game targets—of the 5,450 attacks with a speci-
ﬁed port, the most commonly attacked were 80 (HTTP,
37.5%), 53 (DNS, 11.5%), 25565 (commonly Minecraft
servers [31,65], 9.2%), 443 (HTTPS, 6.4%), 20000 (often
DNP3, 3.4%), and 23594 (Runescape game server, 3.4%).
Interestingly, the 7th most common attack target was an
IP address hosted by Voxility that was associated with one
of the Mirai C2 servers, and we note that 47 of 484 Mirai
C2 IPs were themselves the target of a Mirai DDoS attack.
By clustering these 484 C2 IPs by attack command, we
identiﬁed 93 unique clusters, of which 26 (28%) were

6.3 High Proﬁle Attacks
Several high proﬁle DDoS attacks brought Mirai into the
limelight beginning in September 2016. We analyze the
following three Mirai victims as case studies: Krebs on
Security, Dyn, and the Liberian telecom provider Lones-
tar.
Krebs on Security The popular Krebs on Security blog
has had a long history of being targeted by DDoS attacks
(Figure 10), and on September 21, 2016 was subject to
an unprecedented 623 Gbps DDoS attack— with Mirai as
the prime suspect. Placing this attack in context, it was
signiﬁcantly larger than the previously reported largest
publicly-disclosed DDoS attack victim (i.e., Spamhaus at
300+ Gbps [77]), but we note that attacks to non-disclosed
targets of 500 Gbps and 800 Gbps were reported in 2015
and 2016 respectively [7]. To conﬁrm the origin of the
attack, we intersected a list of 12,847 attack IPs observed
by Akamai with the Mirai IPs we saw actively scanning
during that period. We found a 96.4% overlap in hosts.
Google Shield, who later took over DDoS protection of
Figure 10: Historical DDoS Attacks Targeting Krebs on Se-
curity—Brian Krebs’ blog was the victim of 269 DDoS attacks
from 7/24/2012–9/22/2016. The 623 Gbps Mirai attack on
9/21/2016 was 35 times larger than the average attack, and the
largest ever recorded for the site.
the site, separately maintained a larger sample of 158,839
attack IPs for an HTTP attack on September 25, 2016.
When given the Mirai scanning IPs from that day, they
found 96% of their attack IPs overlapped. Our results
illustrate the potency of the Mirai botnet, despite its com-
position of low-end devices concentrated in Southeast
Asia and South America. We also identiﬁed which C2
clusters were responsible for some of the largest attacks
by correlating attack commands with naming infrastruc-
ture, and we note that cluster 1 (Figure 7) was responsible
for this attack.
Dyn
On October 21, 2016, Dyn, a popular DNS
provider suffered a series of DDoS attacks that disrupted
name resolution for their clients, including high-trafﬁc
sites such as Amazon, Github, Netﬂix, PayPal, Reddit,
and Twitter [71]. Consistent with Dyn’s postmortem re-
port [36], we observed 23 attack commands that targeted
Dyn infrastructure, from 11:07–16:55 UTC. The ﬁrst
21 attacks were primarily short-lived (i.e., 25 second)

GRE IP attacks, and followed by sustained 1 hour and
5 hour SYN attacks on TCP/53. We note a 71% intersec-
tion between the 107K IPs that attacked Dyn and Mirai
scanning in our network telescope. This indicates that,
while the attack clearly involved Mirai, there may have
been other hosts involved as well.
Although the ﬁrst several attacks in this period solely
targeted Dyn’s DNS infrastructure, later attack commands
simultaneously targeted Dyn and PlayStation infrastruc-
ture, potentially providing clues towards attacker mo-
tivation.
Interestingly, the targeted Dyn and PlaySta-
tion IPs are all linked to PlayStation name servers—
the domain names ns.playstation.net re-
solve to IPs with reverse DNS records pointing to
ns.p05.dynect.net, and the domain names
ns.playstation.net resolve to the targeted
PlayStation infrastructure IPs.
The attacks on Dyn were interspersed amongst other
attacks targeting Xbox Live, Microsoft DNS infrastruc-
ture, PlayStation, Nuclear Fallout game hosting servers,
and other cloud servers. These non-Dyn attacks are either
ACK/GRE IP ﬂoods, or VSE, which suggests that the
targets were Valve Steam servers. At 22:17 UTC, the
botnet issued a ﬁnal 10 hour-long attack on a set of Dyn
and PlayStation infrastructure. This pattern of behavior
suggests that the Dyn attack on October 21, 2016 was not
solely aimed at Dyn. The attacker was likely targeting
gaming infrastructure that incidentally disrupted service
to Dyn’s broader customer base. The attack was carried
out by Cluster 6.
Lonestar Cell Attacks on Lonestar Cell, a large tele-
com operator in Liberia and the most targeted victim
of Mirai (by attack account), have received signiﬁcant
attention due to speculation that Mirai substantially de-
teriorated Liberia’s overall Internet connectivity [14, 42].
Others have questioned these claims [45]. We cannot pro-
vide insight into Liberia’s network availability; instead,
we analyze attack commands we observed. Beginning
at 10:45 UTC on October 31, 2016 until December 13,
2016, a single botnet C2 cluster (id 2) issues a series of
341 attacks against hosts in the Lonestar AS. 87% of the
attacks are SYN or ACK ﬂoods and targeted both full sub-
nets and addresses within 168.253.25.0/24, 41.57.81.0/24,
and 41.57.85.0/24, all of which belong to Lonestar Cell
or its parent company, MTN Group.
In addition to IP targets, we observe an NXDO-
MAIN attack issued on November 8, 2016 that targeted
simregistration.lonestarcell.com. A single C2
IP never seen previously or subsequently issued a single
attack on December 14. Attacks on Lonestar infrastruc-
ture continued again at 09:24 UTC on January 16, 2017
and persisted until February 8, 2017, issuing 273 attacks
from a single C2 IP address. In total there were 616 at-
tacks, 102 of which used reﬂect trafﬁc against Voxility,
Google, Facebook, and Amazon servers towards Lonestar
networks. The attack was carried out by C2 cluster 2
and used the C2 domains: “mufoscam.org”, “securityup-
dates.us”, “jgop.org”, and “zugzwang.me”.
As we have seen, Mirai primarily used direct, non-
reﬂective attacks on a wide range of protocols including
the less common GRE and VSE protocols. Even without
relying on ampliﬁcation attacks, Mirai was still able to in-
ﬂict serious damage as evidenced by high-proﬁle attacks
against Krebs on Security, Dyn, and Lonestar Cell. Fur-
thermore, the juxtaposition of attacker geography (largely
Southeast Asia and South America) and victim geography
(majority in the U.S.) places a spotlight on the importance
of global solutions, both technical and non-technical, to
prevent the rise of similar botnets. Otherwise, adversaries
will continue to abuse the most fragile hosts to disrupt the
overall Internet ecosystem.
7 Discussion
Mirai has brought into focus the technical and regulatory
challenges of securing a menagerie of consumer-managed,
interfaceless IoT devices. Attackers are taking advantage
of a reversal in the last two decades of security trends
especially prevalent in IoT devices. In contrast to desktop
and mobile systems, where a small number of security-
conscious vendors control the most sensitive parts of the
software stack (e.g. Windows, iOS, Android)—IoT de-
vices are much more heterogeneous and, from a secu-
rity perspective, mostly neglected. In seeking appropri-
