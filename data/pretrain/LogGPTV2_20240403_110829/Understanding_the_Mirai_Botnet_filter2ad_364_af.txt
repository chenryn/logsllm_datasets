### 5 Distinct /8 Subnets and One Attack on /0 Subnet

The analysis includes five distinct /8 subnets and one attack on the /0 subnet, which encompasses the entire IPv4 address space. Each of these /8 and /0 subnets, with the exception of the local 10.0.0.0/8, contains a large number of distributed network operators and a vast number of IP addresses, significantly exceeding the number of Mirai bots. Consequently, the Mirai attacks on these subnets likely had a modest impact.

### Exclusion of Targeted Subnets

When we exclude targeted subnets due to their unfocused, blanket dispersion across many networks, we find that Mirai victims were distributed across 906 Autonomous Systems (ASes) and 85 countries. The targets were heavily concentrated in the United States (50.3%), France (6.6%), the United Kingdom (6.1%), and a long tail of other countries. The network distribution was more evenly spread, with the top three ASes—OVH (7.8%), Cloudflare (6.6%), and Comcast (3.6%)—accounting for only 18.0% of the victims.

### Most Frequently Targeted Victims

The three most frequently targeted victims were:
- Liberia’s Lonestar Cell (4.1%)
- Sky Network (2.1%)
- 1.1.1.1 (1.6%)

#### Lonestar Cell
Lonestar Cell, a Liberian telecommunications provider, was targeted by 102 reflection attacks. This is discussed in detail in Section 6.3.

#### Sky Network
Sky Network, a Brazilian company that operates servers for Minecraft, hosted by Psychz Networks, experienced sporadic attacks from November 15, 2016, to January 26, 2017.

#### 1.1.1.1
This IP address was likely used for testing purposes [95].

Additional game-related targets among the top 14 victims included a former game commerce site, longqikeji.com, and Runescape, another popular online game. The prevalence of game-related targets, along with the broad range of other unrelated victims, shares many characteristics with previously studied DDoS booter services [39].

### Volumetric and TCP State Exhaustion Attacks

For volumetric and TCP state exhaustion attacks, Mirai optionally specified a target port, which implied the type of service targeted. Among the 5,450 attacks with a specified port, the most commonly attacked ports were:
- 80 (HTTP, 37.5%)
- 53 (DNS, 11.5%)
- 25565 (commonly Minecraft servers [31, 65], 9.2%)
- 443 (HTTPS, 6.4%)
- 20000 (often DNP3, 3.4%)
- 23594 (Runescape game server, 3.4%)

Interestingly, the 7th most common attack target was an IP address hosted by Voxility, associated with one of the Mirai C2 servers. We note that 47 out of 484 Mirai C2 IPs were themselves the target of a Mirai DDoS attack. By clustering these 484 C2 IPs by attack command, we identified 93 unique clusters, of which 26 (28%) were targeted at least once. This direct adversarial behavior reaffirms the notion of multiple, competitive botnet operators.

### High-Profile Attacks

Several high-profile DDoS attacks brought Mirai into the limelight starting in September 2016. We analyze the following three Mirai victims as case studies: Krebs on Security, Dyn, and the Liberian telecom provider Lonestar.

#### Krebs on Security
The popular Krebs on Security blog has a long history of being targeted by DDoS attacks. On September 21, 2016, it was subjected to an unprecedented 623 Gbps DDoS attack, with Mirai as the prime suspect. To confirm the origin of the attack, we intersected a list of 12,847 attack IPs observed by Akamai with the Mirai IPs we saw actively scanning during that period, finding a 96.4% overlap in hosts. Google Shield, who later took over DDoS protection of the site, maintained a larger sample of 158,839 attack IPs for an HTTP attack on September 25, 2016, and found a 96% overlap with the Mirai scanning IPs. Our results illustrate the potency of the Mirai botnet, despite its composition of low-end devices concentrated in Southeast Asia and South America. Cluster 1 (Figure 7) was responsible for this attack.

#### Dyn
On October 21, 2016, Dyn, a popular DNS provider, suffered a series of DDoS attacks that disrupted name resolution for their clients, including high-traffic sites such as Amazon, GitHub, Netflix, PayPal, Reddit, and Twitter [71]. Consistent with Dyn’s postmortem report [36], we observed 23 attack commands targeting Dyn infrastructure from 11:07–16:55 UTC. The first 21 attacks were primarily short-lived (i.e., 25-second) SYN floods on DNS port 53, along with a few ACK and GRE IP attacks, followed by sustained 1-hour and 5-hour SYN attacks on TCP/53. We noted a 71% intersection between the 107K IPs that attacked Dyn and Mirai scanning in our network telescope, indicating that while the attack clearly involved Mirai, there may have been other hosts involved as well.

Although the first several attacks in this period solely targeted Dyn’s DNS infrastructure, later attack commands simultaneously targeted Dyn and PlayStation infrastructure, potentially providing clues towards attacker motivation. The targeted Dyn and PlayStation IPs are all linked to PlayStation name servers. The domain names ns.playstation.net resolve to IPs with reverse DNS records pointing to ns.p05.dynect.net, and the domain names ns.playstation.net resolve to the targeted PlayStation infrastructure IPs.

The attacks on Dyn were interspersed amongst other attacks targeting Xbox Live, Microsoft DNS infrastructure, PlayStation, Nuclear Fallout game hosting servers, and other cloud servers. These non-Dyn attacks were either ACK/GRE IP floods or VSE, suggesting that the targets were Valve Steam servers. At 22:17 UTC, the botnet issued a final 10-hour-long attack on a set of Dyn and PlayStation infrastructure. This pattern of behavior suggests that the Dyn attack on October 21, 2016, was not solely aimed at Dyn. The attacker was likely targeting gaming infrastructure, which incidentally disrupted service to Dyn’s broader customer base. The attack was carried out by Cluster 6.

#### Lonestar Cell
Attacks on Lonestar Cell, a large telecom operator in Liberia and the most targeted victim of Mirai (by attack count), have received significant attention due to speculation that Mirai substantially deteriorated Liberia’s overall Internet connectivity [14, 42]. Others have questioned these claims [45]. We cannot provide insight into Liberia’s network availability; instead, we analyze the attack commands we observed. Beginning at 10:45 UTC on October 31, 2016, until December 13, 2016, a single botnet C2 cluster (id 2) issued a series of 341 attacks against hosts in the Lonestar AS. 87% of the attacks were SYN or ACK floods and targeted both full subnets and addresses within 168.253.25.0/24, 41.57.81.0/24, and 41.57.85.0/24, all of which belong to Lonestar Cell or its parent company, MTN Group.

In addition to IP targets, we observed an NXDOMAIN attack issued on November 8, 2016, targeting simregistration.lonestarcell.com. A single C2 IP, never seen previously or subsequently, issued a single attack on December 14. Attacks on Lonestar infrastructure continued again at 09:24 UTC on January 16, 2017, and persisted until February 8, 2017, issuing 273 attacks from a single C2 IP address. In total, there were 616 attacks, 102 of which used reflected traffic against Voxility, Google, Facebook, and Amazon servers towards Lonestar networks. The attack was carried out by C2 cluster 2 and used the C2 domains: “mufoscam.org”, “securityupdates.us”, “jgop.org”, and “zugzwang.me”.

### Discussion

Mirai primarily used direct, non-reflective attacks on a wide range of protocols, including the less common GRE and VSE protocols. Even without relying on amplification attacks, Mirai was still able to inflict serious damage, as evidenced by high-profile attacks against Krebs on Security, Dyn, and Lonestar Cell. Furthermore, the juxtaposition of attacker geography (largely Southeast Asia and South America) and victim geography (majority in the U.S.) highlights the importance of global solutions, both technical and non-technical, to prevent the rise of similar botnets. Otherwise, adversaries will continue to abuse the most fragile hosts to disrupt the overall Internet ecosystem.

### Conclusion

Mirai has brought into focus the technical and regulatory challenges of securing a menagerie of consumer-managed, interfaceless IoT devices. Attackers are taking advantage of a reversal in the last two decades of security trends, especially prevalent in IoT devices. In contrast to desktop and mobile systems, where a small number of security-conscious vendors control the most sensitive parts of the software stack (e.g., Windows, iOS, Android), IoT devices are much more heterogeneous and, from a security perspective, mostly neglected. In seeking appropriate solutions, it is crucial to address the underlying vulnerabilities and implement robust security measures.
