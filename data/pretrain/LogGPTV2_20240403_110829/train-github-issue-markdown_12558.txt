## Summary
Installing numpy on aarch64 via pip using command "pip3 install numpy" tries
to build wheel from source code
## Problem description
Numpy don't have wheel for aarch64 on PyPI repository. So, while installing
numpy via pip on aarch64, pip builds wheel for same resulting in it takes more
time to install numpy. Making wheel available for aarch64 will benefit aarch64
users by minimizing numpy installation time.
## Expected Output
Pip should be able to download numpy wheel from PyPI repository rather than
building it from source code.
@numpy-team, please let me know if I can help you building wheel/uploading to
PyPI repository. I am curious to make numpy wheel available for aarch64. It
will be a great opportunity for me to work with you.
