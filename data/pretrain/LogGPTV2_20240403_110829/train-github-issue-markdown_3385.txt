### Symfony Version(s) Affected
3.4

### Description
When implementing the `AuthenticatorInterface` instead of extending `AbstractGuardAuthenticator`, a deprecation warning is still thrown.

I created a class named `FormAuthenticator` that initially extended the `AbstractGuardAuthenticator`. After upgrading from Symfony 3.3 to 3.4 (LTS version), I ran Psalm, which flagged the `AbstractGuardAuthenticator` as deprecated and suggested implementing the `AuthenticatorInterface` instead. However, the `AuthenticatorInterface` itself extends the `GuardAuthenticatorInterface`, which is also marked as deprecated.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Implement a Guard by using the recommended `AuthenticatorInterface` for Symfony 3.4.
2. Use the file located at `symfony/src/Symfony/Component/Security/Guard/AuthenticatorInterface.php`.
3. Observe the deprecation warning at line 26:
   ```php
   interface AuthenticatorInterface extends GuardAuthenticatorInterface
   ```

### Possible Solution
To resolve this issue, you can duplicate the methods from the `AuthenticatorInterface` and implement them directly in your `FormAuthenticator` class, rather than extending the deprecated `GuardAuthenticatorInterface`.

This approach ensures that your implementation remains up-to-date and avoids the deprecation warnings.
