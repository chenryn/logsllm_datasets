ABSTRACT
In this paper we construct two new fuzzy identity-based en-
cryption (IBE) schemes in the random oracle model. Not
only do our schemes provide public parameters whose size
is independent of the number of attributes in each identity
(used as public key) but they also have useful structures
which result in more eﬃcient key extraction and/or encryp-
tion than the random oracle version of Sahai and Water’s
fuzzy IBE scheme, considered recently by Pirretti et al. We
prove that the conﬁdentiality of the proposed schemes is
relative to the Bilinear Decisional Bilinear Diﬃe-Hellman
problem.

INTRODUCTION
1.
Motivation. The concept of fuzzy identity-based encryp-
tion (IBE) recently introduced by Sahai and Waters [8] is
to provide an error-tolerance property for IBE. Namely, in
fuzzy IBE, a user with the secret key for the identity ω can
decrypt a ciphertext encrypted with the public key ω(cid:48) if ω
and ω(cid:48) are within a certain distance of each other.
As noted in [8], fuzzy IBE can directly be applied to the
situation where a user is traveling and another party wants
to encrypt at an ad-hoc meeting between them. Another
application of fuzzy IBE is “attribute-based encryption [8,
6, 7]” where a party can encrypt data to all users that
have a certain set of attributes, e.g. {company, division,
department}.

Related Work. Since Sahai and Water’s work, fuzzy IBE
has been discussed in the context of the attribute-based en-
cryption (ABE). Very recently, Goyal et al.
[6] proposed
an ABE scheme that provides ﬁne-grained sharing of en-
crypted data. Piretti et al.
[7] used Sahai and Waters’
“large universe” construction of fuzzy IBE, which we sim-
ply call “Sahai-Waters construction”, to realize their secure
information management architecture. They also observed
that if the random oracle [2] is employed, computational
overhead of the Sahai-Waters construction can greatly be
reduced. We remark that the random oracle not only re-
duces computational overhead but also provides a very short
public parameters whose size is independent of the number
of attributes associated with an identity or the number of
attributes in the deﬁned universe, which is crucial in the
storage constrained applications.
Our Contribution. In this paper, we go one step beyond
Pirreti et al.’s results by presenting fuzzy IBE schemes in the
random oracle model, which are structurally diﬀerent from
the Sahai-Waters construction. We show that the struc-
tural diﬀerence results in more eﬃcient schemes than even
the random oracle version of the Sahai-Waters construction
considered by Pirretti et al. [7]. We prove that our schemes
meet the security requirements as deﬁned in [8] assuming
that the Decisional Bilinear Diﬃe-Hellman (DBDH) prob-
lem is hard.
2. PRELIMINARIES
Computational Primitives. We ﬁrst review the deﬁni-
tion of the admissible bilinear pairing [3], denoted by e. Let
G1 and G2 be groups of the same order q which is prime.
q , we denote G1 \ {1} where 1 is the identity
(By G∗
element of G1, and ZZq \ {0} respectively). Suppose that G1
is generated by g. Then, e : G1 × G1 → G2 has the fol-
lowing properties: 1) Bilinear: e(ga, gb) = e(g, g)ab, for all
a, b ∈ ZZq and 2) Non-degenerate: e(g, g) (cid:54)= 1.
1 and ZZ∗
A computational problem that will be used throughout
this paper is the DBDH problem, a decisional version of
the Bilinear Diﬃe-Hellman problem on which Boneh and
Franklin’s IBE scheme [3] is based. Informally, the DBDH
problem refers to the problem where, given (g, ga, gb, gc) for
random a, b, c ∈ ZZ∗
q , a polynomial-time attacker A is to
distinguish e(g, g)abc from e(g, g)γ for random γ ∈ ZZ∗
q .
Fuzzy IBE and Its Security. The generic fuzzy IBE
scheme [8] consists of the following algorithms.

the Private Key Generator (PKG) runs this algorithm to

scheme is assumed to be the random oracle, which gives rise
to very short public parameters. However, we note that our
scheme has a diﬀerent structure compared to the random
oracle version of the Sahai-Waters construction considered
in [7]. The unique feature of EFIBE-I is that its private
key extraction algorithm (Extract) is structurally simple and
highly eﬃcient.
• Setup(): Generate a group G1 of prime order q. Con-
struct a bilinear map e : G1 × G1 → G2, where G2 is a
group of the same order q. Pick a generator g of the group
G1. Pick g1 ∈ G1 at random. Pick s ∈ ZZ∗
q at random and
q → G1.

Select a tolerance parameter d. Output a public parame-
ter params = (q, g, e, G1, G2, H, g1, g2, d) and a master key
mk = (q, g, e, G1, G2, H, g1, g2, x).
• Extract(mk, ID), where ID = (µ1, . . . , µn): Pick a ran-
dom polynomial p(·) of degree d − 1 over ZZq such that
p(0) = s and compute a private key Dµi = (γµi , δµi ) =
(H(µi)p(µi), gp(µi)) for i = 1, . . . , n. Return DID =
(Dµ1 , . . . , Dµn ).

It is easy to see that the decryption algorithm is correct.
The above EFIBE-I scheme is proven to be IND-FSID-CPA
secure in the random oracle model assuming that the DBDH
problem is hard. The proof is given in the full version of this
paper [1].
By the same argument as [8], the EFIBE-I scheme pre-
vents collusion attacks since each users’ private key com-
ponents are generated with diﬀerent random polynomials.–
Even if multiple users collude, they will not be able to com-
bine their private key components to form a key which is
useful to compromise the conﬁdentiality of the scheme.
Eﬃcient Fuzzy IBE-II (EFIBE-II) Scheme. Our sec-
ond fuzzy IBE scheme bears some similarities to the second
scheme based on the DBDH problem [8]. However, its pri-
vate key extraction has been simpliﬁed by using the outputs
of the chosen random polynomial as random exponents for
g1, in contrast to the scheme in [8] which introduces extra
random exponents and hence incurs extra exponentiations.
More precisely, our scheme computes ((g1H(µi))p(µi), gp(µi))
instead of (gp(µi)
1 H(µi)ri , gri ) [8] to generate a private key
associated with an identity ID
n). A descrip-
tion of the scheme is as follows.

which contains an error tolerance parameter d. Note that
params is given to all interested parties while mk is kept
secret.

identity ID as input, the PKG runs this algorithm to gener-
ate a private key associated with ID, denoted by DID.

message.
A ﬁrst security requirement of fuzzy IBE is “indistin-
guishability of encryptions under fuzzy selective-ID, cho-
sen plaintext attack (IND-FSID-CPA)” [8]. (Note that the
“selective-ID attack” [4] refers to the attack in which an at-
tacker commits ahead of time an identity that it intends to
attack.) The formal deﬁnition based on the game between
an attacker A and the “Challenger” is as follows.
In Phase 1, A outputs a challenge identity ID
∗. In Phase
2, the Challenger then runs the Setup algorithm to gener-
