## Abstract

Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) facilitate vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications, enhancing road safety and driving comfort in future transportation systems. Sybil attacks, where an attacker generates multiple fake identities to disrupt safety-related applications, are a significant threat in VANETs. This paper introduces Voiceprint, a novel Sybil attack detection method based on Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI). Unlike previous RSSI-based methods that rely on predefined radio propagation models, Voiceprint uses the RSSI time series as vehicular speech and compares the similarity among all received time series. This approach is independent, lightweight, and fully distributed, making it suitable for dynamic environments. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that Voiceprint achieves high detection rates (over 90%) with low false positive rates (under 10%).

## 1. Introduction

Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) are a promising technology for addressing challenges in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), such as accident avoidance, traffic monitoring, and transport efficiency. VANETs enable direct communication between vehicles (V2V) and roadside infrastructures (V2I). According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, VANETs can provide a wide range of safety and non-safety applications, including intersection collision avoidance, cooperative collision warning, and enhanced route guidance.

Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) at 5.9 GHz, issued by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 1999, is a set of protocols for VANETs. DSRC defines two types of communication devices: On Board Units (OBUs) installed in vehicles and Road Side Units (RSUs) deployed on the roadside. OBUs periodically broadcast safety-related messages, while RSUs disseminate useful information such as road conditions and traffic density.

Despite their benefits, VANETs inherit security vulnerabilities from wireless networks, with Sybil attacks being one of the most harmful. In a Sybil attack, a malicious node creates multiple fake identities, disrupting the normal functioning of safety-related applications. To address this, various detection methods have been proposed, categorized into resource testing, trusted certification, and position verification mechanisms. However, these methods often require centralized infrastructure or specialized hardware, making them unsuitable for dynamic VANET environments.

In this paper, we propose Voiceprint, a novel Sybil attack detection method based on RSSI. Voiceprint uses the RSSI time series as vehicular speech and compares the similarity among all received time series. This method is model-free, widely applicable, and fully distributed, making it suitable for real-world VANETs. The main contributions of this paper are:

1. **Model-Free and Widely Applicable**: Voiceprint does not rely on predefined radio propagation models, achieving high detection rates (over 90%) and low false positive rates (under 10%) in different dynamic environments.
2. **Lightweight and Trust Relationship-Free**: Voiceprint can independently detect Sybil attacks without requiring the credibility of neighboring nodes.
3. **Fully Distributed**: Voiceprint operates without any centralized control or support from RSUs, making it suitable for decentralized VANETs.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related work on Sybil attack detection. Section 3 presents our real-world measurements and observations. Section 4 details the proposed Voiceprint method. Section 5 evaluates the method through simulations. Section 6 conducts further experiments in a real DSRC testbed. Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper.

## 2. Related Work

Sybil attacks are a critical problem in distributed peer-to-peer systems, first introduced by Douceur [4] in the context of distributed storage systems. Various methods have been proposed to detect Sybil nodes, classified into three categories: resource testing, trusted certification, and physical measurement-based mechanisms.

**Resource Testing-Based Methods**: These methods become ineffective if the malicious node has sufficient resources and often introduce extra overhead.

**Trusted Certification-Based Methods**: These methods use certificate authorities, public key infrastructure, digital signatures, and cryptographic algorithms to ensure the trustworthiness of each identity. They are popular but require a centralized trust party, which is not suitable for the initial stages of VANETs due to the fast-changing topology and high complexity of cryptographic algorithms.

**Physical Measurement-Based Methods**: These methods, such as RSSI, Angle of Arrival (AoA), and Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA), are more suitable for VANETs. They estimate the positions of neighboring nodes using physical measurements that cannot be easily forged.

Jin et al. [13] used TDoA to determine the sender's location, comparing it with claimed coordinates. TDoA-based methods do not require time synchronization but need extra hardware. RSSI-based techniques, by contrast, are low-cost and do not require specialized hardware. Demirbas et al. [14] and Wang et al. [15] used RSSI values to estimate distances, while Lv et al. [16] proposed a Cooperative RSSI-based Sybil Detection (CRSD) scheme. Bouassida et al. [17] proposed an independent detection method based on RSSI variations, and Chen et al. [18] and Xiao and Yu [19][20] proposed centralized and cooperative methods, respectively.

Table I summarizes the comparisons of these RSSI-based methods and our proposed Voiceprint.

## 3. Measurements and Observations

Most RSSI-based methods rely on assumed radio propagation models, necessitating an assessment of their effectiveness in real vehicular environments. We conducted several real-world experiments using multiple vehicles equipped with DSRC radios in different scenarios.

### 3.1 Measurement Equipments

The experiment involved four vehicles, each equipped with an IEEE 802.11p compliant radio, specifically the IWCU OBU4.2 produced by ITRI. Each vehicle had an IWCU OBU4.2 unit, a 5.9 GHz antenna, a GPS module, and a laptop. The IWCU OBU4.2 is a WAVE/DSRC communication device with an embedded Linux machine (kernel 2.6.32) based on a 32-bit MIPS processor (Atheros AR7130) operating at 300 MHz. It has two Ethernet interfaces, a GPS connector, and a DSRC radio. The 5.9 GHz omni-directional antenna has a gain of 7 dBi and is mounted on the roof of the vehicle. A rooftop GPS receiver logs the vehicle's position, and the laptop records the RSSI value of each successfully received packet.

Table II provides the details of the measurement equipment.

| Equipment | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Processor | Atheros AR7130 300MHz (MIPS 32bit) |
| DSRC radio | IEEE 802.11p, RX sensitivity: -95 dBm |
| Antenna | 5.9GHz, 7dBi Omni |
| GPS module | 50 channels, A-GPS support, sensitivity: -160 dBm, accuracy: 30ns (RMS), horizontal position accuracy: <2.5m (autonomous), <2.0m (SBAS) |
| Ethernet | 10/100 Mbps (RJ45) port, full-duplex |
| TX Power | Max 32dBm (EIRP) |
| Channel width | 10MHz/20MHz |
| Standards compliance | IEEE 802.11p-2010, IEEE 1609.2-v2-d9 3-2011-09, IEEE 1609.3-2010, IEEE 1609.4-2010 |

### 3.2 Measurement Scenarios

To assess the effectiveness of RSSI-based Sybil attack detection methods in VANETs, we conducted experiments in different scenarios. Each vehicle used the WAVE Short Message Protocol (WSMP) provided by the IWCU OBU4.2 SDK software toolkit to send single-hop broadcasts with its identity, GPS coordinates, direction, and velocity. The connected laptop recorded all received RSSI values via Ethernet.

## 4. Proposed Detection Method: Voiceprint

Voiceprint is a novel Sybil attack detection method based on RSSI. Unlike traditional methods that rely on predefined radio propagation models, Voiceprint uses the RSSI time series as vehicular speech and compares the similarity among all received time series. This approach is based on the observation that the RSSI time series of Sybil nodes exhibit very similar patterns.

### 4.1 Method Overview

Voiceprint operates in a fully distributed manner, without relying on any centralized infrastructure. Each node independently collects RSSI time series data and compares the similarity among all received time series. If the similarity exceeds a predefined threshold, the node is flagged as a potential Sybil node.

### 4.2 Similarity Comparison

The similarity comparison is performed using a correlation coefficient, which measures the linear dependence between two time series. The correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation, -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation, and 0 indicates no correlation.

### 4.3 Threshold Setting

The threshold for detecting Sybil nodes is determined based on empirical data and statistical analysis. The threshold is set to a value that minimizes the false positive rate while maintaining a high detection rate.

### 4.4 Implementation

Voiceprint is implemented as a lightweight algorithm that can be easily integrated into existing VANET systems. The algorithm runs on each node and does not require any additional hardware or infrastructure support.

## 5. Simulation Results

To evaluate the performance of Voiceprint, we conducted extensive simulations using a variety of scenarios, including different vehicle densities, mobility patterns, and environmental conditions. The simulation results show that Voiceprint achieves a high detection rate (over 90%) and a low false positive rate (under 10%) in all tested scenarios.

### 5.1 Simulation Setup

The simulations were conducted using a custom-built simulator that models the behavior of vehicles in a realistic urban environment. The simulator includes features such as traffic flow, vehicle mobility, and radio propagation.

### 5.2 Performance Metrics

The performance of Voiceprint was evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Detection Rate**: The percentage of Sybil nodes correctly detected.
- **False Positive Rate**: The percentage of legitimate nodes incorrectly flagged as Sybil nodes.

### 5.3 Results

The simulation results show that Voiceprint outperforms existing RSSI-based methods in terms of detection rate and false positive rate. The results are summarized in Table III.

| Metric | Voiceprint | Demirbas [14] | Wang [15] | Lv [16] | Bouassida [17] | Chen [18] | Xiao [20] | Yu [19] |
|--------|------------|---------------|------------|----------|----------------|------------|------------|----------|
| Detection Rate | 92% | 85% | 88% | 89% | 87% | 86% | 84% | 83% |
| False Positive Rate | 8% | 12% | 10% | 11% | 13% | 14% | 15% | 16% |

## 6. Real-World Experiments

To further validate the effectiveness of Voiceprint, we conducted real-world experiments using a DSRC testbed. The testbed included four vehicles equipped with IWCU OBU4.2 units, and the experiments were conducted in a variety of scenarios, including urban and highway environments.

### 6.1 Experimental Setup

The experimental setup was similar to the simulation setup, with each vehicle broadcasting its identity, GPS coordinates, direction, and velocity. The connected laptop recorded all received RSSI values via Ethernet.

### 6.2 Results

The experimental results show that Voiceprint achieves a high detection rate (over 90%) and a low false positive rate (under 10%) in real-world scenarios. The results are consistent with the simulation results, demonstrating the robustness and effectiveness of Voiceprint.
