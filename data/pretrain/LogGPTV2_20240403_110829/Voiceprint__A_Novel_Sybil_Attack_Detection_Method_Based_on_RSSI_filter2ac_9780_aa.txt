Abstract—Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks
(VANETs) enable
vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) com-
munications that bring many beneﬁts and conveniences to
improve the road safety and drive comfort in future trans-
portation systems. Sybil attack is considered one of the most
risky threats in VANETs since a Sybil attacker can generate
multiple fake identities with false messages to severely impair
the normal functions of safety-related applications. In this paper,
we propose a novel Sybil attack detection method based on
Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), Voiceprint, to conduct
a widely applicable, lightweight and full-distributed detection for
VANETs. To avoid the inaccurate position estimation according
to predeﬁned radio propagation models in previous RSSI-based
detection methods, Voiceprint adopts the RSSI time series as
the vehicular speech and compares the similarity among all
received time series. Voiceprint does not rely on any predeﬁned
radio propagation model, and conducts independent detection
without the support of the centralized infrastructure. It has
more accurate detection rate in different dynamic environments.
Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate
that the proposed Voiceprint is an effective method considering
the cost, complexity and performance.
I. INTRODUCTION
Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) is a promising
technology to address the challenging issues in the intelligent
transportation system (ITS) such as accident avoidance, trafﬁc
monitoring and transport efﬁciency. VANETs enable a vehicle
to directly communicate with neighboring vehicles (vehicle-
to-vehicle, V2V) as well as roadside infrastructures (vehicle-
to-infrastructure, V2I). According to a report published by
National Highway Trafﬁc Safety Administration, VANETs
can provide a wide range of communication-based vehicle
safety and non-safety applications in ITS such as intersection
collision avoidance, cooperative collision warning, emergency
electronic brake lights, trafﬁc ﬂow control and enhanced route
guidance and navigation [1].
Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) at 5.9
GHz is a set of protocols for VANETs issued by the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) in 1999. There are two
kinds of communication devices deﬁned in DSRC, namely the
On Board Unit (OBU), which is installed in the vehicle, and
the Road Side Unit (RSU), which is deployed on the roadside.
Safety-related messages are broadcasted periodically on the
Control Channel (CCH) by OBUs with the vehicles’ identity,
location, velocity, acceleration, direction and etc. Meanwhile,
some useful information such as road condition, trafﬁc density
and accident zone are disseminated by RSUs to warn drivers
within their vicinity.
The main purpose of VANETs is to improve the road safety
as well as raise the trafﬁc efﬁciency. Nevertheless, VANETs
inherit all security vulnerabilities from the wireless networks,
which becomes the major issue to apply this technology into
practice. Many types of attacks can be launched in VANETs,
but one of the most harmful is Sybil attack [2]. As aforemen-
tioned, many safety or non-safety applications in VANETs
such as cooperative collision warning and enhanced route
guidance and navigation need cooperation of other vehicles.
This requires one vehicle gets enough credible information
from legitimate vehicles. However, in Sybil attack, adversary
(malicious node) generates multiple fake identities to create
many untrusted virtual nodes (Sybil nodes) in VANETs. This
violates the fundamental assumption in implementing those
applications [3].
Due to the severe damage when Sybil attack happens,
many detection methods are proposed by researchers. All these
techniques can be classiﬁed into three categories: resource test-
ing based, trusted certiﬁcation based and position veriﬁcation
based mechanisms. The resource testing based methods may
become invalid if the malicious node has more computation
or communication resources, and they bring extra overhead to
the system. Most of the trusted certiﬁcation based methods
run the detection algorithms in a centralized manner which
are not suitable for the VANETs due to the fast changing
dynamic topology. In addition,
the deployment of public
key infrastructure and the high complexity of cryptographic
algorithms are also uncertain issues in this type of methods.
Considering the low cost, wide availability and decentralized
nature, the physical measurement based position veriﬁcation
methods are better for detecting Sybil attacks in the initial
stage of VANETs.
In this paper, we proposed a novel Sybil attack detection
method based on RSSI, Voiceprint, to conduct a widely appli-
cable, lightweight and full-distributed detection for VANETs.
Unlike most of previous RSSI-based methods that compute
the absolute position or relative distance according to the
average RSSI values, or make statistic testing based on RSSI

distributions, Voiceprint uses the RSSI time series as the
vehicular speech to compares the similarity among all these
time series. This approach is based on the major observation in
our real-world experiments that the RSSI time series of Sybil
nodes have the very similar patterns. The main contribution
of this paper is three-fold:
1) Voiceprint can be widely applied to real VANETs with-
out any predeﬁned radio propagation model. Extensive
simulations and experiments show the applicability of
the proposed method. It has high detection rate over
90% and low false positive rate under 10% in different
dynamic environments. (model-free, widely applicable);
2) Voiceprint can make independent detection without any
help of other vehicles,
it does not require to
establish the credibility of neighboring nodes (trust
relationship-free, lightweight);
thus,
3) Voiceprint is a fully distributed algorithm without any
centralized control or support of RSU (infrastructure-
free, fully distributed).
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
reviews the related works of Sybil attack detection. Section
III reveals several important observations from the real-world
measurements that motivate our work. Section IV presents
our proposed detection method in detail. Section V conducts
simulations to evaluate our approach. Section VI carries out
further experiments in a real DSRC testbed. Finally, Section
VII draws the conclusion.
II. RELATED WORK
Sybil attack is a very critical problem in distributed peer-
to-peer systems. It was ﬁrst introduced by Douceur [4] in the
distributed storage system. Extensive works are done to detect
the malicious node and Sybil nodes in these systems. The goal
of these detection methods is to ensure each physical node
is bound with a valid unique identity [5]. All these methods
can be classiﬁed into three categories: (1) resource testing
based [4][6], (2) trusted certiﬁcation based [3], [7]–[12] and
(3) physical measurement based mechanisms [13]–[19].
The resource testing based methods are in vain if the
malicious node is equipped with sufﬁcient resources and they
usually bring extra overhead to the system when testing.
Trusted certiﬁcation based methods are the most popular
techniques to establish trust relationship among all nodes.
This type of approaches usually uses the certiﬁcate authority,
public key infrastructure, digital signatures and cryptographic
algorithms to ensure the trustworthiness of each identity. They
can ﬁnd Sybil nodes at the beginning of the attack. However,
this type of approaches usually requires a centralized trust
party to issue digital signatures or certiﬁcates which cannot
easily applied in the initial stage of VANETs.
Due to the fast changing dynamic topology of VANETs
and the high complexity of cryptographic algorithms,
the
lightweight and decentralized detection methods like position
veriﬁcation based methods are more suitable for the vehicular
environment. These approaches usually adopt some physical
measurements such as Received Signal Strength Indicator
(RSSI), Angle of Arrival (AoA) and Time Difference of
Arrival (TDoA) to estimate the positions of the neighboring
nodes. These measured values only depend on the hardware
and physical environment
that cannot be easily forged or
modiﬁed by the malicious node.
Jin et. al used relative time measurements TDoA to deter-
mine the sender node’s location and compared it with claimed
coordinates of the sender node [13]. If they are different loca-
tions, the source node is judged as a Sybil node by receiver.
TDoA-based method does not require time synchronization
but it needs extra hardware (three receiving sensors mounted
on different places of a vehicle). RSSI-based techniques,
by contrast, are low-cost methods without any specialized
hardware. They are on the basis of the idea that receiver
can estimate distance from the sender according to RSSI
values using theoretical radio propagation models. Demirbas
et al. used RSSI-based localization method to detect Sybil
nodes in a static Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) [14]. They
adopted ratio of RSSIs from multiple receivers to overcome
the time varying and unreliable nature of measured RSSI
values. Wang et al. proposed a similar method by assuming a
more realistic Rayleigh fading model [15]. Lv et al. proposed
a Cooperative RSSI-based Sybil Detection (CRSD) scheme
[16]. CRSD does not compute absolute positions, but relative
distances among different nodes. Then, each node broadcasts
the suspect identities with very closer distances. Finally, each
node takes the largest intersection among all received groups
as the detected Sybil nodes.
All above RSSI-based methods are decentralized techniques
that each node runs the detection algorithm locally without
the centralized infrastructure. However, these methods detect
Sybil attack in a cooperative manner that each node needs
the information from neighboring nodes, i.e., to get RSSI
values observed by other nodes around to solve the equations
or compute the intersection of suspect groups. Therefore, the
major problem in these methods is how to conﬁrm the cred-
ibility and honesty of the neighboring nodes, since the Sybil
nodes fabricated by the malicious node might send forged
RSSI values to impede the detection. To avoid this problem,
Bouassida et al. proposed an independent detection method
based on RSSI [17]. In this scheme, the authors checked RSSI
variations measured successively if they fall into a reasonable
interval or not. The unreasonable nodes are labeled as Sybil
nodes. But
the authors only verify the proposed methods
in a small scale testbed. Chen et al. proposed a centralized
approach based on RSSI [18]. In this scheme, landmark as the
trusted centralized party records all RSSI values transmitted by
sensors and conducts a statistical testing for each two RSSI
distributions. The nodes have similar RSSI distributions are
considered as Sybil nodes. Xiao and Yu [20][19] proposed a
cooperative detection method considering the trust relationship
among all neighboring nodes. In this cooperative detection
method, each vehicle ﬁrst periodically broadcasts its identity
and position as a claimer. After collecting enough information
from witnesses (part of neighboring vehicles), one vehicle
as a veriﬁer estimates the position of all neighboring nodes

according to the received RSSI values and the predeﬁned
propagation model. To avoid some Sybil nodes provide forged
location information, they assumed each vehicle can receive
a position certiﬁcation when passing through an RSU. And
the witnesses only selected from the opposite trafﬁc ﬂow
which has the issued position certiﬁcation. According to this
certiﬁcation, this cooperative method can ensure that each
node in witness group is a trusted physical entity. However, it
is not suitable for the sparse trafﬁc and one-way roads.

well as our proposed scheme are summarized in Table I.

III. MEASUREMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS
As most of RSSI-based methods heavily rely on the as-
sumed radio propagation models, we should ﬁrst assess the
effectiveness of such models in the real vehicular environment.
In this Section, we conduct several real-world experiments us-
ing multiple vehicles equipped with DSRC radios in different
scenarios.
A. Measurement Equipments
The experiment includes four vehicles that each one is
equipped with an IEEE 802.11p compliant radio, namely the
IWCU OBU4.2 produced by ITRI. The onboard equipments
for each vehicle are composed of an IWCU OBU4.2 unit, a
5.9GHz antenna, a GPS module and a laptop which are shown
in Figure 1.
IWCU OBU4.2 is a WAVE/DSRC communication device
mounted in a vehicle. It
is embedded Linux machine (k-
ernel 2.6.32) based on a 32 bits MIPS processor (Atheros
AR7130) working at 300MHz. It has two Ethernet interfaces,
a GPS connector and a DSRC radio based on the standard
IEEE 802.11p-2010 [21]. IWCU OBU4.2 is connected to the
5.9GHz omni-directional antenna with a gain of 7dBi. The
antenna is mounted on the roof of the vehicle. There is also
a rooftop GPS receiver placed by the side of the antenna to
log the vehicle’s position. The IWCU OBU4.2 also connects
to the laptop via an Ethernet interface, thus, the laptop can
record the RSSI value of each successfully received packet.
The details of measurement equipments are listed in Table II.

B. Measurement Scenarios
To assess the effectiveness of RSSI-based Sybil attack detec-
tion methods in VANETs, we conduct several experiments in
different scenarios. Each vehicle adopts WAVE Short Message

toolkit to send single-hop broadcast with its identity, GPS
coordinates, direction and velocity. At receiver, the connected
laptop records all received RSSI values via Ethernet. The basic
