battery’s charge, we initiated all tests with fully charged devices.
Battery levels were collected using system calls and utilities avail-
able on Android. Continuous messaging, appearing on the ﬁrst col-
umn, pertains to sending requests to the server as fast as receiving
the previous response. The results show that the effect on battery is
small even when reporting frequently. As such, we expect that the
major obstacle in submitting frequently will be lack of connectivity
in certain environments.
8.2.3 Privacy-preservation
We evaluated the performance of a privacy-preserving setup us-
ing our proof-of-concept implementation. As the main functional-
ity of Icelus is independent on how the (relative) positions are pro-
vided, these benchmarks are carried out separately from the main
server.
It would not require signiﬁcant engineering effort, apart
from storing encrypted locations, to create a combined implemen-
tation.
For fragments, trinkets and beacons, the computational load is
very similar to the encryption benchmarks presented earlier. For
the site and the hub, this setup will incur a noticeable overhead.
The experiments were conducted with requests corresponding to an
example user with 8 devices, requiring 18 distance computations.
The experiments used the DGK encryption scheme [16] with a
key-size of 2048 bits. The machines used was a normal workstation
with an Intel i7-4790 CPU running at 3.60GHz with 16 GB RAM,
and a MacBook pro with an 3.1 GHz Intel Core i7 CPU and 16 GB
RAM. The experiments indicate that the time needed to complete
the protocol is is about 2.2 seconds when executed between the
university campus and a home network in the geographic vicinity,
or about 0.81 seconds with minimalistic network delay where only
the workstation was used. The rest of the time needed by the hub to
compute the conﬁdence score is identical to that of a non-privacy-
preserving solution.
9. RELATED WORK
Utilizing a user’s location for authentication and augmenting se-
curity decisions, like deciding whether to permit raising a user’s
privileges, is conceptually described in a position paper by Den-
ning et al. [17]. Unlike this proposal, they propose an approach
based on geodetic signatures, that is, signatures that tie a user or
terminal to a particular physical location. The increasing popular-
ity of mobile phones has lead to approaches that use them to es-
tablish user location and perform fraud detection. Park et al. [46]
propose a mechanism where the bank sends a message to the user’s
phone when he performs a transaction, including the details of the
transaction and the location of the POS.
More recently, Marforio et al. [41] use the trusted platform mod-
ule (TPM) found on smartphones to sign GPS coordinates, prevent-
ing a compromised device from supplying forged location data. In
contrast, this proposal is more robust as it uses the entire intercon-
nected world instead of a single device to establish user location
and augment authentication.
Location-based authentication has also been explored in the con-
text of indoor “smart spaces” [6,8,27,47,64]. The common denom-
inator of such systems is attempting to identify that a particular user
is physically present in a room, usually through the use of prox-
imity sensors, to protect an asset from unauthorized access and,
less related to this proposal, customizing services (e.g., displays)
according to user preferences. In the same area, the work of Al-
Muhtadi et al. [6], which deﬁnes a context-aware security scheme
for smart spaces, does include the notion of conﬁdence that is af-
fected by the various sensors being present in a space and the type
of authentication a user performs. Unlike this proposal, research in
this area focuses on indoor spaces and relies on infrastructure that
can immediately detect a user entering one.
Also relevant to this paper are publications on predicting the
user’s location [7,9,13,20,36,38,49,53], relying primarily on a sin-
gle device and GPS, and implicit authentication based on learning
the user’s behavior patterns [33, 34, 50, 55, 57]. It should be noted
that these methods focus on a single device, typically a smartphone
or a portable computer.
Related to our location privacy-preserving protocol, there is large
body work on location privacy [35, 59] and biometric authenti-
cation [21] where similar problems are investigated. Steps 1–3
are closest to the work of Erkin et al. [21] who perform blinded
outsourced multiplication for privacy-preserving face recognition.
Steps 4–6 are closest to a building block of the Louis protocol by
Zhong et al. [66] to privately decrypt the result of a distance com-
putation.

CONCLUSION
We have presented a new approach that uses the IoT to establish
user location and use it as an additional factor of authentication.
Location-based authentication has been explored before [31, 41],
however, this work is the ﬁrst to propose using something as perva-
sive as the IoT to locate users and model their movement. Un-
deniably, smartphones will still play an important part, as their
proximity to their owner is high most of the time, but using the
numerous devices that are part of the IoT, we are able to locate
users more robustly. A major advantage of this approach is that,
in the future, it can operate even more effectively, as more IoT de-
vices become broadly available and integrated in the daily life of
users. Today, our evaluation with readily available devices shows
that our approach exhibits a low error rate and has negligible im-
pact on the performance of the tested devices. Finally, collecting
location information in a central location, even under the ownership
of the user, must have undoubtedly raised concerns. We described
a privacy-preserving protocol that can alleviate these concerns, and
argue that progress in the ﬁeld of privacy-preserving computation,
as well as, information-ﬂow tracking [45] and SGX [54] will fur-
ther diminish the risks.
