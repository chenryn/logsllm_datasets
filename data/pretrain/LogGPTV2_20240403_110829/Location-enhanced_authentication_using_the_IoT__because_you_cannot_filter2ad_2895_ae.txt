# Table 4: Effects of Reporting Period on Battery Consumption and Location Accuracy

| Reporting Period | Battery Consumption (%) | Location Accuracy (m) |
|------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| 30s              | 1.5%                    | 5m                     |
| 60s              | 0.8%                    | 17m                    |
| 300s             | 0.4%                    | 35m                    |
| 1800s            | 0.1%                    | 70m                    |
| 18000s           | 0.0%                    | 330m                   |

### Gear Live (as Trinket)
- 30s: 22.4%
- 60s: 4.5%
- 300s: 2.3%
- 1800s: 1.5%
- 18000s: 1.0%

### Gear Live (as Fragment)
- 30s: 10%
- 60s: 3%
- 300s: 1.3%
- 1800s: 1.0%
- 18000s: 1.0%

### Notes:
- **Location Accuracy**: How accurately we can estimate the user's location, assuming they are walking.
- **Battery Consumption**: All tests were initiated with fully charged devices, and battery levels were collected using system calls and utilities available on Android.

## 8.2.3 Privacy-Preserving Performance

We evaluated the performance of a privacy-preserving setup using our proof-of-concept implementation. The main functionality of Icelus is independent of how relative positions are provided, so these benchmarks were conducted separately from the main server. Integrating encrypted locations would not require significant engineering effort.

### Computational Load
- For fragments, trinkets, and beacons, the computational load is similar to the encryption benchmarks presented earlier.
- For the site and hub, this setup incurs a noticeable overhead.

### Experimental Setup
- **User Scenario**: 8 devices, requiring 18 distance computations.
- **Encryption Scheme**: DGK with a key size of 2048 bits.
- **Hardware**:
  - Workstation: Intel i7-4790 CPU @ 3.60GHz, 16 GB RAM.
  - MacBook Pro: Intel Core i7 CPU @ 3.1 GHz, 16 GB RAM.

### Results
- **Time to Complete Protocol**:
  - Between university campus and home network: ~2.2 seconds.
  - Minimalistic network delay (workstation only): ~0.81 seconds.
- **Hub Computation Time**: Identical to non-privacy-preserving solutions.

## 10. Conclusion

We have introduced a new approach that leverages the Internet of Things (IoT) to establish user location and use it as an additional factor in authentication. While smartphones remain crucial, the integration of numerous IoT devices enhances the robustness of user location. Our evaluation with readily available devices shows a low error rate and minimal impact on device performance. We also described a privacy-preserving protocol to address concerns about centralizing location data, and we anticipate further improvements with advancements in privacy-preserving computation, information-flow tracking, and SGX.
