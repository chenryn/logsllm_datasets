User: I am implementing a small distributed system (in Python) with nodes behind firewalls. What is the easiest way to pass messages between the nodes under the following restrictions:

I don't want to open any ports or punch holes in the firewall 
Also, I don't want to export/forward any internal ports outside my network
Time delay less than, say 5 minutes, is acceptable, but closer to real time would be nice, if possible.
1+2 â†’ I need to use a third party, accessible by all my nodes. From this follows, that I probably also want to use encryption

Solutions considered:

Email - by setting up separate or a shared free email accounts (e.g. Gmail) which each client connects to using IMAP/SMTP
Google docs - using a shared online spreadsheet (e.g. Google docs) and some python library for accessing/changing cells using a polling mechanism
XMPP using connections to a third party server 
IRC
Renting a cheap 5$ VPS and setting up a Zero-MQ publish-subscribe node (or any other protocol) forwarded over SSH and having all nodes connect to it

Are there any other public (free) accessible message queues available (or platforms that can be misused as a message queue)?
I am aware of the solution of setting up my own message broker (RabbitMQ, Mosquito) etc and make it accessible to my nodes somehow (ssh-forwardning to a third host etc). But my questions is primarily about any solution that doesn't require me to do that, i.e. any solutions that utilizes already available/accessible third party infrastructure. (i.e. are there any public message brokers I can use?)
Assistant: I would recommend RabbitMQ or Redis (RabbitMQ preferred because it is a very mature technology and insanely reliable). ZMQ is an option if you want a single hop messaging system instead of a brokered messaging system such as RabbitMQ but ZMQ is harder to use than RabbitMQ. Depending on how you want to utilize the message passing (is it a task dispatch in which case you can use Celery or if you need a slightly more low-level access in which case use Kombu with librabbitmq transport )
