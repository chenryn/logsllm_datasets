guessable gestures occupying low α levels.
I. Security Results: Clustering-based Dictionary Attack
Table VIII shows the number of clusters and the mean inter-
cluster distances for each algorithm and policy. We note that
the number of clusters are reduced compared to the ﬁrst study
due to the smaller sample sizes (1000 vs 2594); this likely
also accounts for some of the variations in mean inter-cluster
distances between the two studies. Looking at the differences
between the policies, we note the similarly between gestures
in each dictionary cluster is markedly higher in the lexical
policy than in baseline. This suggests that gestures in each
cluster in the lexical policy were more homogeneous than in
baseline. In contrast, the blacklist policy (for Protractor) and
the consolidated policy (for both recognizers) showed more
heterogeneity in the gestures within each cluster. The clusters
in these policies collected a more diverse set of gestures. The
results of dictionary attacks on all four policies are shown
in Figure 8. The charts suggest the lexical policy impairs
resistance to the dictionary attacks, while the blacklist and con-
solidated policies may enhance it. We tested these variations
for signiﬁcance at speciﬁc FRR values of 2.5% (DTW-only),
5% and 10% using sets of Bonferroni corrected Chi-squared
tests of independence. For Protractor, all differences in the

baseline (χ2 = 9.39, p = 0.013); the blacklist condition
showed reduced Day 2 Return Rates compared to consolidated
(χ2 = 7.5, p = 0.037) and; blacklist and consolidated
led to lower Day 2 Recall Rates than baseline (respectively,
χ2 = 7.04, p = 0.048 and χ2 = 7.46, p = 0.038). In sum:
our policies lengthened mean setup (by 9.63 to 53.21 seconds)
and recall (by 0.21 to 1.1 seconds) times and led to modest
reductions (of approximately 3%) in recall rates.
3) Policy Speciﬁc Measures:
In the lexical policy, only
24.2% of participants opted to change the word. They did
so a median of 3 times. This, in conjunction with the setup
times close to baseline, suggests a low degree of compliance
with the policy: most participants did not engage strongly
with the task. In the blacklist and consolidated policies,
participants attempted to create a gesture that matched one
in the dictionary a mean of, respectively, 1.99 times (σ: 3.24)
and 2.44 times (σ: 2.96). While this shows participants did
experience additional challenges in creating gestures due to
the blacklisted dictionaries, its not sufﬁcient to account for the
substantial increase in setup times alone – rather than make
repeated attempts, the blacklist and consolidated conditions led
to participants engaging more strongly with the task; spending
more time thinking about the gesture they would create.
G. Security Results: Preprocessing and EER
Appendix A shows a subjective categorization of gestures
from each policy, using the same categories and raters from
the ﬁrst study. We note that gestures in the blacklist and
consolidated conditions show increased rates of compound
gestures (complex gestures involving two or more distinct
forms) compared to baseline: both 39.0% versus baseline’s
16.6%. Additionally, lexical shows the highest rates for the
simple categories of geometric shapes and letters (54% in
total). Appendix B shows the distribution of all raw points in
creation gestures across all policies. We calculated EERs as in
the ﬁrst study; optimal re-sampling sizes were unchanged at
96 for Protractor and 24 for DTW. Table VIII shows the EERs
and the corresponding threshold values and Figure 7 the ROC

performance of clustering dictionary attack were signiﬁcant (at
p ≤ 0.0014 or lower, χ2 = 13.6 to 149.32) except between
blacklist and consolidated (all p ≥ 0.27, χ2 = 0.78 to 4.02)
and between baseline and consolidated at the 5% FRR level
(p = 0.2, χ2 = 4.57). Data for DTW tells a similar story.
All differences were signiﬁcant except between blacklist and
consolidated (all p = 1). Blacklist signiﬁcantly improved over
baseline at the 5% FRR level (p = 0.029, χ2 = 7.95) and all
other signiﬁcant differences were at p < 0.001 (χ2 = 17.48
to 609.9). To provide some speciﬁcs: using DTW and at the
11.54% FRR level derived from prior work and discussed in
the ﬁrst study, the best performing policy is consolidated. The
dictionary attack cracks 14.93% of gestures generated under
the consolidated policy, an improvement of 30.69% over the
21.54% cracked in the baseline condition at the same FRR.
We conclude our blacklist and consolidated policies improve
the security of gesture passwords, while our lexical policy
reduces it. A possible explanation is that the lexical policy
does not require compliance, while it is mandated in other
two policies, ensuring that participants can not use one of the
blocked gestures. In addition, participants generated relatively
simple (see Appendix A) and homogeneous (see Table VIII)
gestures with the lexical policy. We also note the lack of
signiﬁcant security improvements with the consolidated policy
compared to the blacklist policy suggests that
this more
comprehensive set of restrictions on gestures may only provide
marginal beneﬁts. Finally, we also note the results are aligned
with those from the ﬁrst study: DTW outperforms Protractor
by offering an increased resistance to dictionary attacks.

VI. DISCUSSION
By applying the proposed framework to the ﬁrst study,
we made two integral observations: (1) EERs alone cannot
adequately represent the security of gesture passwords, often
overestimating their security, and (2) our clustering-based
dictionary attack is highly effective, and many baseline gesture
passwords are vulnerable to online attacks due to the biased
ways in which people select easy-to-draw (simple) gestures.
Password policies may be able to mitigate these biases.
However, designing policies is challenging and characterized
by trade-offs; increasing security reduces usability [37]. Our
three gesture policy designs sought to improve security while
minimizing costs to usability through two different strategies:
the lexical policy sought to inspire and the blacklist and con-
solidated policies to restrict. The lexical policy maintained us-
ability, but reduced security. A major problem was compliance;
behavioral data (in terms of setup time and word update rate)
suggest participants did not engage with the task. Alternatively,
the inherent imageability [30] of words may have led them to
create homogeneous forms – this assertion is backed up by the
high similarity of gestures within each cluster (see Table VIII)
and data from the qualitative categorization of the gestures
that indicates the lexical policy led to a high proportion of
gestures based on simple shapes and letters – see Appendix A.
On the other hand, the blacklist and consolidated policies
enforced compliance and improved security at the cost of
increased setup and recall times. This may be due to increased
heterogeneity of the gestures: in qualitative categorization,
they led to high rates of compound categorizations, referring
to gestures with two or more elements, that we suggest will

be more diverse (and thus harder to guess) than simpler single
forms. Blacklist policies should be reﬁned in future work.
It is also worth comparing the gestures in this paper with
pattern locks, which can be considered as constrained gestures
– Cho et al. [14] provide a detailed analysis that includes
cracking results against patterns captured in a similar setting to
this work (on MTurk) and in a standard policy: in 20 guesses,
33% of patterns were cracked. With our baseline policy,
achieving a similar level of security would require a more
rigid match criteria than used in our studies. A threshold of 2.0,
used in prior work [10], would achieve this (23.13% to 31.49%
cracked) at a cost of increased FRRs – based on data in the ﬁrst
study, these would rise to 11.54%. We note this ﬁgure remains
reasonable; pattern lock errors are reported to run at 12.1% in
real world use [27]. While our blacklist policies offer an im-
provement on performance in terms of resistance to dictionary
attack (up to 14.93%), they do so at a cost in other metrics.
Cho et al. [14] report pattern setup times of 22 seconds,
whereas our blacklist policy and consolidated polices took
between three and four times as long, reﬂecting participants’
mandated engagement with the gesture password creation task.
While this is not ideal, free-form gesture passwords are novel
and setup times may improve with more training and use in
the future. There are further limitations to this work. MTurk
workers, and the gesture passwords they create, may not be
representative [29], and the security and usability incentives
we offered upon gesture selection may not match the real-
world intentions and needs. Attackers may be able to use other
sources of data (e.g., smudges [28]) to aid guessing attacks.
Alternative discretization methods may improve guessability in
n-gram models, and affect the partial guessing entropy results.
Larger data sets collected in the wild (e.g., through a real-
world mobile application) are a precursor to addressing these
challenges – we identify exploring alternative ways to gather
real-world samples as a challenge for future work.
It is also worth reﬂecting our characterization of gesture
passwords: we position them against the dominant (primary)
unlock methods of PINs and patterns. In this scenario, gesture
passwords improve on partial guessing entropy. Alternatively,
they could be positioned against secondary unlock methods
(e.g., biometrics) used in addition to a primary scheme.
Gesture passwords may still provide value in this case as
a complementary usable and secure secondary authentication
method. We note current smart-phones provide multiple sec-
ondary unlock options (e.g., face recognition, iris scanner,
and ﬁngerprint scanner) and allow users to operate different
schemes interchangeably. Indeed, multiple options are needed
due to limitations affecting the use of each secondary scheme:
ﬁngerprint scanners perform poorly when ﬁngers are oily or
dirty and recognition rates may decrease with user age [38];
face recognition and iris scanning do not work in poor lighting,
or when users are mobile or otherwise not looking at the phone
screen. Accordingly, users set up multiple authentication sys-
tems to unlock their devices in various situations. As such,
we believe gesture passwords, which can be readily entered
without close attention to the phone screen (i.e., they are
scale and position independent), provide a valuable alternative
means for users to quickly and easily unlock their phones. We
believe they would be beneﬁcial in common situations such
as when users are not attending to their phone screen (e.g.,
while walking or performing other activities [38]).
VII. CONCLUSION
This paper proposes a novel security assessment framework
for gesture passwords based on entropy assessment and auto-
mated clustering and dictionary generation capabilities. It val-
idates this framework by collecting and analyzing the largest
current sample of gesture passwords (N=2594). Responding
to the ease with which gesture passwords were cracked, we
