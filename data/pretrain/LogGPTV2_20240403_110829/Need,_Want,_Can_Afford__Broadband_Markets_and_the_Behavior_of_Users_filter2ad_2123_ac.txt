users in “control” and “treatment” groups. We use a caliper
to ensure that dissimilar users are not matched, requiring
that users be within 25% of each other for each confounding
factor. This means, for instance, that users with latencies of
50 and 62 ms and in regions where broadband Internet access
costs $25 and $30 (USD) per month are considered to be
suﬃciently similar in terms of latency and cost of broadband
access. Note the trade-oﬀ here, a tighter caliper will yield a
potentially more accurate comparison, but will also reduced
the number of comparisons we can perform.

The increase in demand is statistically signiﬁcant while
comparing groups of users with capacities less or equal to
6.4 Mbps (though the achieved p-value when comparing
groups (6.4, 12.8] and (12.8, 25.6]
is very close to 0.05).
When comparing users in bins above 12.8 Mbps, the dif-
ference tends to become random and our hypothesis holds
about 50% the time. These results suggest that increasing
capacity beyond ≈10 Mbps is less likely to have a signiﬁcant
impact on peak user demand.
For the FCC data, increased capacity tends to result in
increased demand across all bins. We believe that this is
largely due to the fact that the FCC vantage point set is
comprised solely of users in the US, where higher capacity
broadband services are available, but at a moderately higher
price (this does not apply in many of the countries in our
study). We also observed a similar trend of increased usage
when studying Dasu users in the US, as we will show in
Sec. 5.
4. LONGITUDINAL TRENDS IN USAGE
The last few years have witnessed a rapid growth on
the capacity, coverage and aﬀordability of broadband net-
works [4]. Concurrently, the volume of digital content and
total IP traﬃc continue to grow at rapid pace. A recent
Cisco report states that the total IP traﬃc has increased
18-fold since 2.4 exabytes in 2005 [10]. Meanwhile, the size
of the “digital universe”, the total amount of data created
and replicated reported to be 2.8 zettabytes in 2012, doubles
in size about every two years [18]. In this section, we look
for changes in demand over time to see if these changes are
reﬂected, and in what manner, in the network demand of
broadband users.
To this end, we carry a longitudinal analysis of broadband
connections in our dataset. We compare changing trends in
usage relative to capacity, both average and peak, between
2011 and 2013. Figure 6 shows average and demand over
this period, with and excluding BitTorrent traﬃc.
Trends in relative use are surprisingly diﬀerent than what
we expected. Despite the fourfold increase in global IP
traﬃc, we ﬁnd that subscribers’ demand on the network
remained constant at each speed tier. While we note a
slight increase in demand for users with very fast connections
(about 100 Mbps), overall the demand within the same
broadband class has remained fairly consistent throughout
the observation period.
Using a natural experiment, we are unable to ﬁnd any
signiﬁcant change in demand at any given speed tier between
2011 and 2013.
It would appear that growth in traﬃc is
likely due to an increase in the number of broadband sub-
scriptions and the increased capacity of available services.
5. PRICE OF BROADBAND ACCESS
This section examines the impact that the price of
broadband access has on user demand.
In recent years,
we have seen signiﬁcant growth in the number of people
accessing the Internet [4]. While increased aﬀordability has
played a critical role in this growth, the price of broadband
Internet access remains unaﬀordable in many parts of the
developing world.
In countries like Iran and Botswana,
a 1 Mbps plan could cost as much as $150 USD per
month, after accounting for purchasing power parity (PPP).

Table 3: Percentage of the time that increased price
results in increased usage for pairs of similar users
and corresponding p-values.
Contrast this with countries like Germany, Japan, and the
US, where a 1 Mbps plan (or faster) are available for less
than $25 per month.
We have seen how, up to a point, demand increases
with capacity. If price is a factor that aﬀects a customers’
decision when selecting a broadband plan, then we would
expect that higher prices will result in users signing up for
lower capacity services despite their needs. Similarly, if two
services with similar speeds are available at diﬀerent prices
in two markets, we would expect that the service in the more
expensive market would experience higher network demand
since subscribers are willing to pay more for it.
We design the following study to test this idea. We
deﬁne our hypothesis (H) such that users in markets where
broadband Internet access is more expensive will have
higher demands on the network than users in less expensive
markets. Our null hypothesis (H0) then, is that increased
price does not have an aﬀect on network demand.
For this experiment, we ﬁrst need to group users based
on price of broadband access in their region. We deﬁne the
price of broadband access in a country as the monthly cost
(USD PPP) of the cheapest service with a capacity of at least
1 Mbps. We grouped users by the cost of broadband access
using the following bins: less than $25 per month, between
$25 and $60 per month, and over $60 per month. Users in
countries such as Germany, Japan, and the US ﬁt in the
ﬁrst bin (< $25 per month). Countries such as Mexico, New
Zealand, and the Philippines had prices between $25 and
$60 per month, while prices in counties such as Botswana,
Saudi Arabia, and Iran were above $60 per month.
After placing users into groups based on the monthly price
of broadband access, we compared the demand of otherwise
similar pairs of users in each group. In these experiments, we
use peak usage (when not active on BitTorrent) to measure
demand.2 For this experiment, users are “treated” with
an increased cost, which our hypothesis says will increase
demand. The results are shown in Table 3. We ﬁnd that
indeed, as price increases, more users have a higher demand
than those with a similar connection where access is cheaper.
Case study. We now illustrate the impact that price can
have on usage with a concrete example using four markets:
Botswana, Saudi Arabia, the US and Japan. We selected
these four as examples of the diversity of markets in our
dataset.
We chose Botswana and Saudi Arabia given that both
countries were among those with the highest broadband ac-
cess costs, but diﬀered in terms of typical service capacities.
Since its independence Botswana has enjoyed one of the
highest GDP growth rates in the world.3 In recent years, the
country has seen rapid growth in the percentage of citizens

both average and peak demand were all comparable.

download capacity for the median user. We then matched the median capacity with the nearest speed tier

calculate the monthly cost in each country as a percentage of monthly income.
with access to the Internet (from 3% in 2005 to 12% in
20134). The cost of Internet access in Botswana, however,
remains comparatively high. A 1 Mbps service, including a
phone line, from Botswana Telecom costs about $150 per
month after accounting for purchasing power parity.
In
contrast, a 1 Mbps service in the US would cost about $20
per month.
Over the past decade, Saudi Arabia has also experienced
rapid growth in both GDP per capita (PPP) and the number
of Internet subscribers. The percentage of the population
using the Internet has tripled from just under 20% in 2007 to
over 60% in 2013. However, according to the ITU only about
5% of the population with broadband subscriptions are on
services faster than 10 Mbps (we see a similar percentage in
our global dataset). A 1 Mbps connection is also relatively
expensive in Saudi Arabia at about $60 USD (PPP) per
month, three times higher than a similar service in the US.
We include the US in our study as it presents another
interesting case as one of the most diverse broadband service
markets in terms of the available download capacities (from
about 1 Mbps to over 100 Mbps). Japan, on the other hand,
is one of the markets with widest availability of high-end
broadband services. While the range of broadband service
prices are similar to those in the US market, a larger fraction
of users in Japan subscribes to high capacity services.
Table 4 summarizes the users and services seen in each
market. We calculate the “typical” price of broadband in
each of the country by matching the median capacity to the

nearest service in our dataset. Compared to the US and
Japan, customers in Botswana and Saudi Arabia are paying
much more for slower services, especially as a fraction of
monthly GDP per capita. Users in both Japan and the
US appear to spend a similar fraction of monthly GDP
per capita (1.3%). However, ISPs in Japan oﬀered higher
capacities at the same fraction of monthly income. As a
result, users in Japan were more likely to subscribe to faster
services.

(Botswana, Saudi Arabia, the US, Japan). We ﬁnd a large
number of Botswana users on a ≈ 512 kbps service while
users in Saudi Arabia are heavily clustered around 4 Mbps.
Both the US and Japan show a wider distribution across
diﬀerent service levels. In Japan, however, a higher fraction
of users are on high-end services. The majority of users
in Japan (60%) have download speeds of at least 25 Mbps,
compared with over 71% of users in the US who are on
services slower than 25 Mbps.
It is interesting to contrast maximum download through-
out rates with the fraction of the link utilized during peak
usage for each user in these four countries (Fig. 7b). The
countries appears in exactly reverse order. Botswana shows
the highest peak utilization while Japan shows the lowest.
In Japan, and to some extent in the US, links tend to be
very underutilized, even at the 95th percentile.
Based on our earlier ﬁndings, we expect that users
in Botswana and Saudi Arabia will have higher network
demands than users with similar services in the US, due to
increased costs. On the other hand, users in Japan should
have lower demand on the network than users with similar
services in the US, due to lower service costs for the same
capacity.
Unfortunately, at this point it is diﬃcult to directly
compare user demand in each market due to the large
diﬀerences in service capacities. Therefore, we group users
into diﬀerent tiers of service based on their service capacity.
We then compare usage within the same tier across markets.
For this analysis, we selected the following tiers: below
1 Mbps, 1 to 8 Mbps, 8 to 16 Mbps, 16 to 32 Mbps, and
above 32 Mbps. The selection of tiers was based on the
speeds common among the broadband technologies in our
dataset and the range of capacities in each country. In the
following plots, we do not include data on a particular tier
for a country with less than 30 users in our dataset.
Figure 8 shows the 95th percentile utilization of users,
categorized by the aforementioned speed tiers. Figure 8a
represents the utilization for users in the US. In this case, as
customers sign up for faster services, they tend to be using
less of the link during peak usage.
Note the higher link utilization in Botswana (Fig. 8b)
compared to the utilization on the same tier in the US. In
Botswana, the average 95th percentile link utilization was
80%; in the US, the average peak utilization was about 52%.
