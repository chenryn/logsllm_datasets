User: How to use Git for version control, including basic operations such as creating branches, merging, and submitting changes?
Assistant: The following are the basic operations of Git for version control: 1. Create a repository To use Git for version control, you first need to create a repository. You can use the command "git init" to create a repository in a local directory, or you can use the command "git clone" clones a remote repository. 2. Add files to the repository Use the command "git add" to add local files to the local repository. 3. Submit the changes Use the command "git commit" to submit the file changes in the temporary storage area to the local version library, and you need to add the submission information. 4. View the version information Use the command "git log" to view the commit history information in the repository. 5. Create a branch Use the command "git branch" to create a new branch, and you can use the command "git checkout" to switch to the new branch for development. 6. Merge branches Use the command "git merge" to merge the two branches together, and you need to ensure that there is no conflict between the merged branches. 7. Undo changes Use the command "git checkout" to undo local file changes, and use the command "git reset" to undo the commits in the local repository. The above are the basic operations of Git for version control.
