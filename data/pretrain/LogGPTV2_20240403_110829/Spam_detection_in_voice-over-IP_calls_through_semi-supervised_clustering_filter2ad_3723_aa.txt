 Spam Detection in Voice-over-IP Calls through Semi-Supervised Clustering  Yu-Sung Wu, Saurabh Bagchi1 Navjot Singh2 Ratsameetip Wita3 1 School of Electrical & Computer Eng., Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907 2 Avaya Labs, 233 Mt.

SPIT detection is different from spam detection in email in that the process has to be soft real-time, fewer features are available for examination due to the difficulty of mining voice traffic at runtime, and similarity in signaling traffic between legitimate and malicious callers. Our approach differs from existing work in its adaptability to new environments without the need for laborious and error-prone manual parameter configuration. We use clustering based on the call parameters, using optional user feedback for some calls, which they mark as SPIT or non-SPIT. We improve on a popular algorithm for semi-supervised learning, called MPCK-Means, to make it scalable to a large number of calls and operate at runtime. Our evaluation on captured call traces shows a fifteen fold reduction in computation time, with improvement in detection accuracy.

Introduction   As the popularity of VoIP systems increases, they are being subjected to different kinds of security threats [1]. A large class of the threats such as call rerouting, toll fraud, and conversation hijacking incur deviations in the protocol state machines and can be detected through monitoring the protocol state transitions [2],[3]. Additionally, cryptographically secure versions of the common VoIP protocols, such as Secure SIP and Secure RTP, address many of the attacks presented in the literature. However, spam calls in VoIP [4], commonly called SPIT, are becoming an increasing nuisance. The ease with which automated SPIT calls can be launched can derail the adoption of VoIP as a critical infrastructure element. Existing monitoring and cryptographic solutions are not immediately applicable to SPIT detection. In this paper, we address the problem of detection of SPIT calls.  Detection of spam emails is a mature field and there are some similarities to our problem. In both domains, users can provide feedback about individual email or call, for the latter, through a built-in button in some commercially available VoIP phones. However, there exist significant differencesâŽ¯VoIP traffic is real-time and the detection should ideally be real-time as well; some features are expensive to extract in real-time, especially those in voice traffic; the signaling patterns are likely similar in legitimate and malicious calls rendering content-based filtering on signaling traffic ineffective; and features from multiple protocols used in VoIP may be relevant.  In this paper, we present the design of a system that uses semi-supervised machine learning for detection of SPIT calls. It builds on the notion of clustering whereby calls with similar features are placed in a cluster for SPIT or legitimate calls. Call features include those extracted directly from signaling traffic, those extracted from media traffic, such as proportion of silence in the call, and those derived from calls. However, previous approaches that use thresholds [5] on the call features are difficult to use in practice since the nature of SPIT calls varies widely. Therefore, we learn the features to use and their relative importance in clustering through runtime observations, which include user feedback.  The popular semi-supervised clustering algorithm called MPCK-Means [6] scales as O(N3) where N is the number of calls. This would generally be too expensive for real-time operation. We modify this to create our algorithm called eMPCK-Means, using VoIP specific features to reduce it to O(N). Such specialization includes the early use of user feedback and prior knowledge of the number of clusters. Additionally, we create an incremental protocol called pMPCK-Means, that can perform the detection as soon as the call is established.  We evaluate the protocols using four call traces with different characteristics of SPIT and non-SPIT calls, over different proportions of user feedback and accuracy of the user feedback. With a batch of 400 calls, eMPCK-Means is 15 times faster than MPCK-Means, while achieving better detection coverage in terms of true and false positives. Since pMPCK-Means can examine a limited set of call 978-1-4244-4421-2/09/$25.00 c(cid:13)2009 IEEE
