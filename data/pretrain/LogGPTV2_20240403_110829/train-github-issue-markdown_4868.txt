**Current behavior**  
Change detections running outside of zones have no effect.
**Expected behavior**  
Either the change detection should succeed or an explicit error should be
thrown.
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**
Demo: http://plnkr.co/edit/wtB971qbdZivPSyTkpvj
  * Cause an event to occur outside of Zone.js
  * Attempts to effect changes resulting from that event in an Angular component
  * (note: this also happens when the change detection strategy on `OnPush`)
**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
In general, any events that happen outside of Zones. My situation came about
as a result of listening to `paused` / `play` events on a video element, which
apparently Zone.js does not wrap properly or did not wrap in this situation.
It could also easily happen if a first or third-party module initializes some
routine when it is first imported on which events can be fired.
This would have been substantially more difficult to debug if it happened deep
in some such 3rd party dependency ðŸ˜›
