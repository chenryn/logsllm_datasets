What is all this multicast?
Me!
It’s Multicast DNS (mDNS)!
Purpose
Name Resolution (Peer-to-Peer)
History
AppleTalk Name Binding Protocol
Zero Configuration Networking 
Development
Multicast DNS
DNS-Service Discovery
Features
Messages
Same formats and operating 
semantics as conventional DNS
Based on “local” domain
Shared and unique records
Operations
Queries and responses sent to 
224.0.0.251
Utilizes UDP port 5353 for 
both resolvers and responders
Usage
Probe
Announcement
- Startup -
- For those resource records that it desires to be unique on the local link
- Proposed questions in the Authority Section as well
- Any “Type” record
- All shared and unique records in answer section
- Unique have their cache-flush bit set
- Repeated any time should rdata change
- Unsolicited response
(query)
(response)
224.0.0.251
224.0.0.251
Usage
Querying
Responding
- Resolution -
- One-shot queries, and continuous ongoing queries
- Source port determines compliance level of the resolver
- Fully compliant resolvers can receive more than one answer
- Known answer suppression
- Truncation is used for large known answer set
- Mutlicast or unicast response per the query parameter
- Unicast queries are always treated as having the “QU” bit set
- Cache-flush bit indicates an authoritative answer
- No queries in any response

Usage
Goodbye
- Resolution -
- Used for changes on “Shared” records
- Not needed for unique records because of the cache-flush bit
(query)
224.0.0.251

Grabbing Information from an mDNS Responder
mDNSHostName
Parameters (-t:Target)
Reverse lookup of the IPv4 address
Operates using a unicast legacy query to UDP port 
5353 of the target
mDNSLookup
Parameters [-t:Target] [-q:Question] [-r:Record Type]
Submits the question as given
Also operates using a unicast legacy query to UDP 
port 5353 of the target …
Demonstration
But wait ...
Isn’t this just flowing to my interface on it’s own?
OK … I could do some really cool things with this!
What could I do?
Me!

Requirements
Must have active responders (someone offering)
Connected to same switch as other resolvers (someone 
asking)
Or
Join yourself (if you must) to the multicast group
Works best on a busy network … because you need hosts 
out there asking a lot of questions so that you can collect 
the most answers!
First Cool thing … Host Discovery!
mDNSDiscovery
Parameters [-t:Range]
Reports on any host communicating to 224.0.0.251
Doesn’t join the group … only picks up traffic for the 
multicast group that is forwarded to all ports by the 
switch
Demonstration
End result?
Completely silent, passive 
host discovery
Network 
Security Guy!
Why don’t you 
go active so I 
can catch you!
But wait, there’s more …
Second Cool thing … Port Scanning!
Legitimate hosts performing (in essence) port 
scans with one packet
Couldn’t I perform a port scan with no packets?
That’s right … two, two products in one!
Is it magic?
It’s “Zero Configuration” Networking!
So Let’s Do This …
DNS-Service Discovery occurs continuously over 
the network
Listen for it over multicast DNS on the local link
Don’t rely on known service records … it’s too 
limiting
When a host responds to a discovery request …
report all the SRV record ports in it’s replies as 
ports open on that host
So Let’s Do This …
mDNSScan
Parameters [-t:Range] [-p:Ports]
Currently 22 services over 18 ports have been seen 
and identified using this method
Many more are possible based on the exhaustive list 
available
Doesn’t join the group either …
Demonstration
This is what our sensors see …
… in a typical active scan
And what do our network sensors see …
Me!
… during this passive scan
Me!
Nothing!
What does this mean?
Network 
Security Guy!
We are still 
unhappy!
Completely silent, passive 
port scans
OK, what else?
Unique Implementations
Unique Records
Unique Sets
Could this be used to fingerprint?
Yes … yes, it could

Someday … mDNSFingerprint
Build database of identifying record sets
Collect all incoming records and organize by host
Match against database and extract configuration 
information
Return identity and configuration information for 
each host
Limitations
Multicast
Routers between the recipient and the source must be 
multicast enabled 
mDNS
Querying (Link-Local Response Only)
Responses only accepted from local-link
Responses only sent to the local-link
Listening (Layer-2 Boundaries)
Broadcast Domain
VLAN containment
Sensors
Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems
Etherape
Netflow/StealthWatch
Detect
Other detection possibilities
Monitoring
IGMP (group membership)
mDNS (responders)
Management Applications?
Defenses (Host)
Anti-Virus/Anti-Spyware/Anti-Spam
Intrusion Prevention System
Firewall and Port Blocking
Application Control
Device Control
Others
Do these help any?
Defenses (Network)
Firewalls/Access Control Lists
Network Access Control
VLANs
How about these?
What can we do then?
IGMP
Implement IGMP snooping
Authenticate group membership (IGAP)
Track members (Membership reports)
What can we do then?
Multicast DNS
Locate mDNS responders
Disable the service
Harden the box … in particular the services that 
are offered
Sanitize records
Plan of Attack
Hunt down mDNS responders with these tools
Remove them or harden them
Implement any controls you have for multicast in 
your environment
IGMP snooping/MLDv2
IGAP or IPv6 multicast authentication mechanisms
Other Protocols
Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP)
Microsoft’s Answer to “Zero Configuration”
networking
HTTP-Based but also multicasted
Methods: NOTIFY, M-SEARCH
Link Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR)
Another Microsoft solution
DNS-Based but also multicasted
Both less developed, but still in use
Final Thoughts
Hosts are now actively advertising their available 
attack surfaces to anyone listening on the 
network 
Great for passive information gathering
Can be controlled to limit your exposure
But ultimately …This is not for the enterprise
