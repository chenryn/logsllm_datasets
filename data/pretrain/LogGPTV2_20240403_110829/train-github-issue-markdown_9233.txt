# Description of the new feature/enhancement
If some link is shown in the terminal, it would be nice to allow open it
whether clicking over it.
# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)
Maybe `ctrl+left mouse key` as default combination could produce a similar
behaviour like VSCode integrated terminal.  
If the link uses a file path such as `C:\myfile.txt`, clicking opens it.  
If the link is an URL, then default system browser will open it in a new tab.
