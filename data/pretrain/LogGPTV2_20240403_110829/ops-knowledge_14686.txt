User: Currently, I'm using Google's 2-step method to backup the datastore and than import it to BigQuery.
I also reviewed the code using pipeline. 
Both methods are not efficient and have high cost since all data is imported everytime.
I need only to add the records added from last import.
What is the right way of doing it?
Is there a working example on how to do it in python?
Assistant: There is no full working example (as far as I know), but I believe that the following process could help you :
1- You'd need to add a "last time changed" to your entities, and update it. 
2- Every hour you can run a MapReduce job, where your mapper can have a filter to check for last time updated and only pick up those entities that were updated in the last hour
3- Manually add what needs to be added to your backup.
As I said, this is pretty high level, but the actual answer will require a bunch of code. I don't think it is suited to Stack Overflow's format honestly.
