but removes nothing. Before our next example, let’s delete our previous work and Stan fresh. Note that deleting 
a workspace removes all associated data and reports. Make sure you have exported your evidence if needed. 
First, relaunch Recon-ng. The following commands display the current workspaces; delete the OSINT 
workspace; and create a new workspace tided location.

The techniques that you will read about in this chapter are for educational use only. Many, if not all, of the 
methods described here could violate organization policy if executed. While the chapter will only discuss publicly 
available data, possession could violate your security clearance or be determined illegal by state or federal law. 
Distribution of the types of content that will be discussed here will be illegal in most cases. However, I will 
explain ways that you can apply these practices in a legal way, and keep yourself employed. Overall, please do 
not take any action from this instruction unless you have verified with your organization's legal counsel or 
supervisory personnel that you have the authority to do so. Let’s begin.
This is where things get tricky. While you can find copies of thousands of stolen databases all over the internet, 
what are the legalities of downloading and possessing the data? First, let me say that I am not an attorney and I 
offer no legal advice. I have spoken with many attorneys and prosecutors about this, and the feedback was 
similar from each. If the data is publicly available, possession alone would likely be legal. This is similar to viewing 
an email stolen from Hillary Clinton posted on WikiLeaks or an internal document stolen from Google posted 
on Medium. If you do not violate the laws and policies applicable in your city, county, state, or country when 
you view this publicly available, yet stolen, data, then you could likely get away with viewing stolen credentials 
existing in the various database leaks online.
In previous chapters, 1 discussed the online services Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) and Dehashed as two amazing 
resources for email search. These services possess a huge database of publicly available leaks that were stolen 
from the host companies and distributed over the internet. In order to emphasize the concern, I will repeat that 
this data was originally stolen by criminals. When you search an email address on these services and are informed 
that it was compromised within the Linkedln data breach, this means that a partial copy of this stolen data 
resides within these services. HIBP and others are often applauded as a great resource to monitor your own 
accounts for any reported compromises. Well, what if we created our own collection of this data?
What matters most is that you never take any illegal action with the data that you possess. In a moment, I wall 
explain how to access valid email addresses and passwords of billions of accounts. Using this data as a search 
technique is one extreme, but attempting to use this data to access someone's account is another. There is no 
situation where gaining access to a target's account is acceptable, unless you have a valid search warrant or court 
order to do so. Since many of you are in law enforcement, this chapter may identify new strategies for you when 
you have the legal authority’ to access an account. We will start with some very basic legal data.
I previously presented websites that allowed you to search a real name and identify the voter registration record 
of the individual. This usually identifies a home address, telephone number, party’ affiliation, and occasionally 
an email address. These websites are committing no crime. Some states make the data freely available, and some 
charge a fee for digital access. All states' voter registration details are public record, which is why it is overly 
analyzed and scrutinized during election seasons. At the time of this writing, entire third-party state databases 
were available for download at the following addresses.
Ubuntu: Conduct the following steps within your OSINT Original VM.
• brew install ripgrep
unnecessary "tabs" in each
430 Chapter 28
Mac: Enter the following command within Terminal. You must have Brew installed, as explained in the 
beginning of the book.
cd '-/Deskcop/Voter-FL 
cat * > Voter-FL.txt
cd ~/Desktop/Databases
rg -a -F -i -N Williamson
Assume that you have downloaded the dozens of county files from the Florida link above. You now have a 
folder titled Voter-FL on your desktop of your Linux VM that was discussed in Secdon I. The reason we want 
the data inside Linux is because we can take advantage of built-in commands that will help us sort and collect 
our data. Furthermore, we will add Ripgrep to Linux, which allows extremely fast searching of large data sets. 
Personally, I do not like having a separate text file for each county in Florida. I would rather combine all of them 
into one single file and title it appropriately. If you start hoarding collecting data, you may want to keep your 
collection tidy. Therefore, I would open Terminal and type the following commands. The first navigates you 
into the folder, and the second combines all of the files into one file titled Voter-FL.txt.
The output appears sporadic and similar to the text below. This is because there are 
line which causes the text to appear broken.
You could now move that file to another folder on your desktop titled Databases, and delete the Voter-FL 
folder. This new large text file may take a long time to open, which is quite common with these datasets. 
Therefore, let's clean it up. First, we need to install a small utility titled Ripgrep. The following instructions 
explain the process for Mac and Ubuntu Linux. Ripgrep does not play well with Windows, hence the need for 
a Linux VM.
• 
Navigate to https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases/.
• 
In the "Assets" section, download the file ending with ".deb".
• 
Open the Files application, click on Downloads, and double-click this .deb file, which was 
ripgrep_12.1.1_amd64.deb at the time of writing.
• 
Click "Install" and follow the prompts.
These sites are all operated by the same individual. He files Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for 
copies of the public data, and discloses the content he is given by the government. If you believe this is not legal, 
consider Ohio. If you navigate to https://www6.ohiosos.gov/ords/f?p=VOTERFTP:HOME and click on the 
"Statewide Voter File" tab, you can download the entire database of registered voters directly from the official 
Ohio government domain. This is truly public data and avoids the use of third-party providers. The data set for 
Washington state is also available from the government if you promise not to further distribute or sell the 
content. You can download the entire database directly at https://www.sos.wa.gov/elections/vrdb/extract- 
requests.aspx. Other states' voter databases are also out there, and Google should get you to them. You may not 
see the value of downloading this data versus conducting queries on the various websites. Let's walk through an 
example to see where we can benefit from the full data set.
Now that we have Ripgrep installed, we can use it to peek into very large files. First, let's take a look at the 
structure. The following commands within Terminal in Linux or Mac will navigate you to the Databases folder 
on your desktop, and conduct a search for the name "Williamson" within the new file. The search parameters 
will be explained in a moment.

If you have your Terminal window maximized, this all fits quite nicely on one line. 1 may have created more 
confusion than provided answers, so let's dissect each process. This will be beneficial in our future examples. In 
order to search the data collected, we will be using Ripgrep, as previously mentioned. The commands we will be 
using are explained below.
Overall, we will almost always use the combination of rg -a -F -i -N "target". The commands that begin with 
"sed" tell the operating system to modify data. In the previous command of sed -i ' s/:: /: /g' Voter-
rg -a -F -i -N PI:EMAIL Search EXACTLY PI:EMAIL or PI:EMAIL
