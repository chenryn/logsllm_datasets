in all kinds of sTLDs. Altogether, SEISE detected around
1 million URLs leading to malicious content on 11,473
infected FQDNs under 9,734 sTLD domains. The results are
summarized in Table II and Table III.
To understand the magnitude of the threat towards individual
sTLDs, we studied the ratio of compromised FQDNs under each
domain category. For this purpose, we ﬁrst tried to get some
idea about how many FQDNs are under each sTLD, using the
passive DNS dataset from DNSDB [3]. The dataset includes
the records of individual DNS RRsets as well as ﬁrst-seen,
last-seen timestamps for each domain and the DNS bailiwick
from Farsight Security’s Security Information Exchange and the
authoritative DNS data. The number of FQDNs under an sTLD
was estimated from those under the sTLD queried between
2014/01 and 2015/08, as reported by the passive DNS records.
The results were further cross-validated by comparing them
with the estimated domain counts given by DomainTools [2]
for each TLD.
Table II illustrates the top-10 sTLD with the largest number
of infected domains, together with the number of domains we
monitored and the total number of domains we estimated for
each sTLD. According to our ﬁndings, gov.cn is the least
protected sTLD with a signiﬁcant portion of the FQDNs
compromised (12%), which is followed by edu.vn 3% and
edu.cn 3%. The top-3 sponsoring registrars with the most
infected gov.cn sites are sfn.cn, alibaba.com, xinnet.com. On
the other hand, .mil sites apparently are better protected than
others. Among the 456 .mil domains we monitored, only 8
domains are injected.
Figure 7 describes the distributions of the compromised
sTLD sites across 141 countries, as determined by their
geolocation. Based upon the number of infected domains,
countries are colored with different shades of blue. As we
can see here, most of infected sites are found in China (15%),
followed by United States (6%) and Poland (5%).
Impacts of the infections. We further looked into the Alexa
ranks of injected sTLD websites, which are presented in
Figure 6. Across different sTLDs, highly ranked websites were
found to be exploited, getting involved in various types of
malicious activities, SEO, Phishing, fake drug selling, academic
cheating, etc. Figure 6 illustrates the cumulative distributions of
the ranks: a signiﬁcant portion of the infections (75%) actually
happen to those among the top 1M. Figure 6 further shows
the top-20 websites with the highest Alexa ranks. Among

them, 12 are under .edu, including the websites of leading
institutions like mit.edu (Alexa:789), harvard.edu (Alexa:1034),
stanford.edu (Alexa:1050) and berkeley.edu (Alexa:1452), and
7 under .gov, such as nih.gov (Alexa:196), state.gov (Alexa:719)
and noaa.gov (Alexa:1126). In general, China is the country
that hosts most injected sTLD sites; however, when it comes
to top ranked sites (Alexa rank < 10K), 67% of them are in
the United States and Australia.
Also interesting is the types of malicious activities in which
those domains are involved. Table III shows the number of the
domains utilized for promoting each type of content (across
all 10 categories). As we can see here, most of the injected
sTLD sites (19%) are in the Gambling category, which is
followed by those related to Drug (15%) and General Product
(14%) such as shoes and healthcare products. When we look
at the top-20 domains, many of them are infected to promote
Drug. Also, many .edu domains advertise unlicensed pharmacy,
while .gov are mainly compromised to promote gambling and
fake AV. Interestingly, the injected domains associated with
different countries tend to serve different types of content. For
example, the most common promotions on Chinese domains
are gambling (which is illegal in that country), while most
injected US domains are linked to unlicensed online pharmacy.
Since the infected country code sTLDs (e.g., .cn) can make the
content they promote more visible to the audience in related
countries (e.g., boosting the ranks of malicious sites in the
results of country-related searches), it is likely that promotional
infections target speciﬁc groups of Internet users, just like
legitimate advertising.
Our study further shows that many of such infections have
been there for a while. Figure 8 shows the distribution of the
infection time for the injected page in sTLD sites. We estimated
the durations of their infections by continuously crawling the
20K injected pages (which were detected in 2015/08) every
two days from 2015/08 to 2015/11 to ﬁnd out whether they
were still alive. As we can see from the ﬁgure, most infections
last 10-20 days, while some of them have indeed been there
for a while, at least 1 months. A prominent example is the
injection on ca.gov, whose infection starts no later than 60
days.
B. Implications of Semantics Inconsistency
Our study shows that promotional infections, particularly
for those under sTLDs, are characterized by the inconsistency

sites across 141 countries.
718718
Fig. 8: The distribution of the infection time.
between the semantics of the promoted content and that of an
infected domain’s generic content: in our labeled bad set (the
collection of compromised domains reported by CleanMX; see
Section IV-B), all sTLD-related infections contain the malicious
content inconsistent with the semantics of their hosting websites.
The implication of this observation is that by exploiting this
feature, a weakness of the sTLD-based promotional infections,
a semantic-based approach, like SEISE, can effectively suppress
such a threat to sTLDs. This is signiﬁcant, since our study,
as elaborated below, shows that sTLDs are valuable to the
adversary because they are less protected and highly ranked.
