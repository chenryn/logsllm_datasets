User: In my terminal and in CodeRunner my Python is updated to 2.7.6 but when I ran a shell script in the OSX Automator I found that it is running 2.7.2  
How can I update the Automator Python to 2.7.6 like the rest of my compilers ?
Assistant: I couldn't specify explicitly which python for it to use.
So, I ran it in bash environment with following command:
$ your/python/path /path/to/your/python/script.py
And make sure first line of your python program contains the path to the python environment you wish to use. 
Eg:
#! /usr/local/bin/python
