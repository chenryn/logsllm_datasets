307 accounts, as explained in Section 3), while 111 leaked
accounts received friend requests (we leaked 619 functional
accounts). This shows that the attempted reach of criminals
extended beyond the corpus of credentials they obtained.
IP Addresses. 90% of the IP addresses recorded in the ac-
counts accessed less than 5 accounts each. 50% of them ac-
cessed exactly one account, as shown in Figure 2. The most
proliﬁc IP address accessed 93 accounts—an outlier, as shown
by the long tail in Figure 2. In a general sense, a variety of
attackers connected to the accounts—the recorded activity is
not simply a reﬂection of the activity of a handful of attackers.
In Section 4.10, we further discuss those IP addresses.
Next, we study the timing of activity in honey accounts,
with particular emphasis on how long the recorded accesses
lasted.
Figure 2: CDF of the number of accounts accessed by each IP
address. 90% of IP addresses accessed less than 5 accounts
each. 50% accessed exactly one account. A particularly pro-
liﬁc IP address accessed 93 accounts, hence the long tail.
4.4 Timing of Account Activity
We set out to understand the time patterns of accesses to ac-
counts. To this end, we measured how long it took criminals
to connect to the accounts after we leaked account creden-
tials, and how long they stayed connected to the accounts.
These measurements were carried out across all accounts, and
also on groups of accounts (by age range and gender), to ob-
serve differences in activity patterns across different types of
accounts. We present detailed measurements next.
Leaks to Logins. Recall that we leaked credentials of honey
accounts via paste sites to attract criminals to them. To ob-
serve how long it took them to connect to the accounts after
the leaks, we computed time lags between the ﬁrst leak (dated
June 1, 2018) and ﬁrst access to each account. Note that the
account credentials were leaked simultaneously at multiple
times. As the CDF in Figure 3 shows, the accounts were
mostly not accessed instantly. Instead, criminals connected to
them gradually over several days. By the 25th day, more than
50% of accounts that were visited had received at least one
access.
Spike in Accesses. The spike recorded in logins after the
25th day since ﬁrst leak (see Figure 3) was caused by the
previously mentioned proliﬁc IP address that accessed 93
accounts in a single day. Those accesses all occurred on June
28, 2018, which coincides with the spike in Figure 3. The
user-agent string associated with those accesses indicates that
the connections were made from an Android device—and
the accesses were possibly made in an automated manner.
However, this is just an indication, since user-agent strings
can be easily changed; they are not reliable.
Access Duration. To understand how long criminals stayed
in the honey accounts, we computed the duration of their ac-
cesses. To achieve this, we recorded the time that a cookie

sis), while hijacker accesses differ least (we cannot reject the
null hypothesis). Next, we compared adult and teen access
durations (p = .92). Likewise, we compared female and male
access durations (p = .13). In both tests, the null hypothesis
cannot be rejected.
4.5 Effects of Demographic Attributes
To understand whether the age and gender of an account affect
the actions performed by cybercriminals, we calculated the
proportions of access types in each age range and gender.
From the age perspective, Figure 7a shows that criminals add
and remove friends from adult accounts much more than they
do in teen accounts. On the other hand, they edit proﬁles and
are chattier in teen accounts than they are in adult accounts.
From the gender perspective, Figure 7b shows that female
accounts present more friend list modiﬁcation activity than
male accounts. On the other hand, search activity and proﬁle
editing occurs more in male accounts than female accounts;
no proﬁle edits were recorded in female accounts.
Statistical Tests on Age and Gender. To understand how
age and gender differences affect the activity of criminals,
we carried out Fisher’s exact test [25] to determine if access
types were independent of demographic attributes (i.e., age
range and gender). The null hypothesis states that there is no
association between demographic attributes and access types.
Table 2b shows that there is indeed a signiﬁcant relationship
between account age and access type, particularly in chatty
and friend modiﬁer accesses, for which we reject the null hy-
pothesis. Similarly, Table 2c shows a signiﬁcant relationship
between account gender and access type, especially in friend
modiﬁer, searcher, and proﬁle editor accesses. This shows
that the demographic attributes of accounts indeed inﬂuence
the activity of criminals in those accounts.
4.6 Action Sequences
A browsing session on social media does not comprise a
single action; it is usually a sequence of actions. To further
understand the activity of criminals in compromised accounts,
we studied transitions among actions in the accounts during
accesses. We studied these transitions to observe differences
across male and female accounts, and teen and adult accounts.
For instance, if a criminal connects to an account, clicks “like”
on a photo (emotional), sends a private message to another
account (chatty), and ﬁnally changes the password of the orig-
inal account (hijacker), we denote that ﬂow of ordered actions
as an emo→cha→hij chain. Note the use of shorthand labels.
Table 1 shows the full list of shorthand labels.
We modeled access types as states and then computed
probabilities of state transitions by following the ﬂows we
observed in the accounts. This resulted in directed graphs
with weighted edges. We present them in Figures 8 and 9 to
Figure 3: CDF of the time difference between ﬁrst instance
of credential leaks (across all outlets) and ﬁrst logins.
ﬁrst appeared in an account as t0, and the last time it appeared
in that account as tlast. Given this information, access duration
can be computed as tlast −t0 for each access. Figure 4 shows
CDFs of access duration grouped by access type. Curious ac-
cesses are mostly short-lived, with the exception of a long tail
of accesses, comprising a tiny fraction that stay in accounts
for 80 days or more. It is possible that curious accesses that
stayed connected to accounts for extended amounts of time
were made by stealthy criminals that perform no action in
stolen accounts to avoid being detected. Instead, they possibly
monitor the accounts for an extended period to observe new
sensitive content that could potentially beneﬁt them. Finally,
hijacker accesses mostly connect to accounts for less than one
hour in our dataset.
We further computed access duration by age range to see
if there were differences in access duration in adult accounts
compared to teen accounts. The CDFs in Figure 5 show that
criminals spend approximately the same time in teen accounts
as adult accounts, but accesses to adult accounts present a
longer tail than accesses to teen accounts. Finally, we com-
puted access duration by gender, to see if there were differ-
ences in access duration in female accounts compared to male
accounts. The CDFs in Figure 6 show that criminals spend
slightly more time in female accounts than in male accounts.
Statistical Tests on Access Duration. To test the statistical
signiﬁcance of differences in access duration, we relied on
the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test [33, 46]. The
null hypothesis is that both samples under examination be-
long to identical statistical distributions. The output of the
test is a KS statistic and p-value. A small KS statistic or high
p-value shows that we cannot reject the null hypothesis. First,
we tested the access durations of each access type against all
access durations, to see the access types for which we can re-
ject the null hypothesis. As Table 2a shows, searcher, curious,
and proﬁle editor accesses differ most from the distribution

shed light on differences in action transitions across different
age ranges and genders respectively. Note that the sum of
probabilities (weights) of outgoing edges do not always sum
up to 1, but instead to values close to 1, because of rounding
errors. Our approach is similar to the one employed by Wang
et al. [56] in building clickstream models to detect Sybil ac-
counts. In this section, we explore selected one-hop transitions
(e.g., emo→cha) that are particularly interesting and deserve
a closer look. These sequences of activities consider unique
accesses. They are therefore depicting the same attacker per-
forming a sequence of actions on a certain account during
the same browsing session. To outline their browsing session,
we tracked them using cookies (see Section 4.2), sorted their
actions in a chronological order, and built activity chains.
Age. As Figure 8 shows, pro→pro (0.7), emo→hij (0.17),
and emo→emo (0.083) transitions exist in teen accounts,
while they are absent from adult accounts. On the other hand,
emo→fri (0.17), emo→sea (0.17), and sea→emo (0.0067)
transitions exist in adult accounts, but are absent from teen
accounts. In our dataset, criminals remain in the proﬁle edit-
ing state in teen accounts only, and they stay in the searcher
state in teen and adult accounts at roughly the same rate
(approximately 0.7). Also, they remain in the chatty state
within teen accounts more than they do in adult accounts.
Conversely, criminals stay in the friend modiﬁer state within
adult accounts more than they do in teen accounts. These
ﬁndings corroborate and shed more light on the demographic
results presented in Section 4.5. They also indicate that ac-
tion sequences could possibly be used to distinguish between
attacker activity in teen and adult accounts.
Gender. The ﬁrst striking observation in Figure 9b is the
disconnected pro node; transitions to or from the pro state
do not exist on the female graph. This gender difference
is further highlighted by the relatively high probability
of accesses staying in the pro state within male accounts
(0.58). It indicates that proﬁle editing constitutes a strong
distinguishing activity from the gender perspective. Chatty
accesses tend to remain in the chatty state within male
accounts (0.62) more than they do in female accounts (0.53),
while friend modiﬁer accesses maintain their state in female
accounts (0.74) more than they do in male accounts (0.23).
Similar to our observations from the age range perspective,
criminals stay in the searcher state at roughly the same rate
in male (0.67) and female (0.65) accounts. Finally, Figure 9
shows pro→pro (0.58), pro→sea (0.33), and sea→pro
(0.023) transitions in male accounts only; they are absent
from female accounts. Conversely, it shows emo→emo
(0.083), emo→fri (0.082), and emo→sea (0.083) transitions

These ﬁndings indicate that behavioral patterns could po-
tentially help in distinguishing malicious users from benign
users in the future. However, that task is not in our scope
of work since we do not have access to the action ﬂows of
legitimate users (baseline ﬂows); large online services have
the capability to compute them.
4.7 What Searchers Seek
As shown in Table 1, searcher accesses were responsible for a
substantial share of actions in honey accounts (30%). Various
