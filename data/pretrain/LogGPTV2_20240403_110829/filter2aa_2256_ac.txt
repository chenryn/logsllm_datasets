### High-Risk Individuals and Situations

**High-Risk Individuals:**
- Executives or scientists at large companies
- Individuals who have recently filed an insurance claim
- People engaged in political demonstrations or activism
- Employees of defense contractors, the Department of Energy, or similar organizations
- Individuals in the upper income bracket
- Those who have noticed private investigators "poking around"

**High-Risk Business Situations:**
- Companies with publicly traded stock (or those planning to go public)
- Businesses experiencing labor problems, union activities, or negotiations
- Companies involved in litigation or lawsuits
- Organizations with pending or recent layoffs
- Firms in the fashion, automotive, advertising, or marketing industries

### Who Gets “Bugged”?

Anyone can be a target of covert eavesdropping, but certain individuals are at higher risk due to their financial position, occupation, legal, or domestic situation. Common targets include:
- Spouses bugging each other
- Parents bugging children
- Businessmen bugging other businessmen
- Scientists bugging other scientists
- Students bugging professors
- Attorneys bugging other attorneys and their clients
- Insurance companies bugging accident victims and other claimants
- Construction companies bugging other construction companies
- Salesmen bugging clients
- Collection agencies bugging debtors
- Police officers bugging suspects
- Executive recruiters bugging personnel directors
- Rock fans bugging rock musicians
- Department stores bugging customers and merchandise

### The Scale of the Problem

The U.S. State Department estimates that at least $800 million worth of illegal bugging and eavesdropping equipment is imported and installed into U.S. corporations annually. This equipment primarily comes from countries like France, Germany, Lebanon, Italy, Canada, Israel, England, Japan, Taiwan, South Africa, and others. Additionally, anyone with basic electronics knowledge and a soldering iron can build and install an eavesdropping device using materials easily obtained from consumer electronics.

In the United States, over $6 million worth of surveillance devices are sold to the public daily, often through storefront operations, spy shops, attorneys, and private investigators in major cities. This does not include the billions spent by law enforcement, military, and intelligence agencies on legitimate eavesdropping products. These devices range from a few dollars to under $1,000 for more sophisticated models. In New York City alone, there are over 85 companies that sell, install, and monitor eavesdropping devices.

### The FBI and Federal Law Enforcement

The FBI and other federal law enforcement agencies have repeatedly stated that they lack the resources and training to effectively address the technical security threat within the United States. Technical surveillance and industrial espionage pose a serious risk to both businesses and personal freedoms.

### What to Do If You Suspect You’ve Been “Bugged”

1. **Contact a Qualified TSCM Firm:** Corporate attorneys can provide recommendations.
2. **Make Contact from a Secure Location:** Avoid using suspect telephones, cordless, or cellular phones.
3. **Do Not Call the Telephone Company, Police, or FBI.**
4. **Keep Your Suspicions Confidential:** Discuss only on a need-to-know basis.

### Planning and Execution of a Proper Sweep

**1. Client Initiates Secure Contact:**
- Review the TSCM firm's website and materials.
- Make contact away from the suspect facility (e.g., pay phone at an airport).
- Arrange a secure face-to-face meeting if requested.
- Send relevant materials to the TSCM firm.

**2. Initial Meeting and Commissioning:**
- Conduct the initial meeting at a sterile location.
- Discuss concerns and vulnerabilities.
- Commission TSCM services if appropriate.
- Formulate a plan in case an eavesdropping device or security hazard is found.

**3. Pre-Inspection Survey, Research, and Facility Reconnaissance:**
- Review facility blueprints.
- Conduct an external RF survey (9 kHz to 26.5/40 GHz).
- Perform facility exterior reconnaissance.

**4. Vulnerability Analysis:**
- Assess threats, physical security, and electronic security.
- Conduct an internal RF survey.
- Audit communications systems and facilities.
- Inventory furnishings, fixtures, and artifacts.
- Evaluate structural elements.
- Sketch the suspect area and identify sensitive areas.
- Develop a threat model during normal office hours with appropriate cover.

**5. Silent/Passive Walk-Through:**
- Conduct non-alerting activities.
- Use automated bug and wireless microphone detection (9 kHz to 3 GHz).
- Inspect AC, telecom, LAN, and HVAC wiring.
- Detect infrared and laser surveillance devices.
- Perform video camera, tape recorder, VLF, and ultrasonic detection.
- Evaluate physical security, locks, and alarms.
- Most amateur and spy shop bugs will be detected during this phase.

**6. Passive Inspection - RF and Light Spectrum Monitoring:**
- Continue non-alerting activities.
- Conduct a full passive RF spectrum sweep (20 Hz to above 110 GHz) and light spectrum sweep (300nm to 1710nm / 83 THz to 450 THz).

**7. Active Inspection - Non-Alerting:**
- Create minor noise without alerting the eavesdropper.
- Check AC mains, HVAC controls, alarm and access control sensors, fire and safety sensors, and other areas.
- Evaluate and trace all phone lines back to the central office.
- Document and inspect all artifacts.
- Use oblique, UV, IR, and visible spectrum lighting for inspections.
- Check for telephone set modifications, PBX software and hardware anomalies, voice mail issues, and computer and LAN connections.
- Inspect laser printers and computer output devices.
- Professional bugs will be detected during this phase.

**8. Active Scan - Alerting:**
- Use chirp detection for hidden microphones and transducers.
- Employ IR, audio, and ultrasonic jamming as needed.
- Inspect furnishings, ceilings, walls, and conduct thermal and acoustical leakage inspections.
- Use bore scope inspection for electrical wall plates and boxes.
- Conduct a detailed electromagnetic energy search (above 110 GHz).
- Professional eavesdropping devices will be detected during this phase.

**9. Active Scan - Alerting/Evaluation:**
- Verify and trace all conductors using TDR/FEXT/NEXT.
- Evaluate PBX, ESS, and SN translation.
- Inspect voice mail systems, Xerox machines, and fax machines.
- Verify the security of PBX, alarm, HVAC, and audio systems.
- Evaluate all artifacts and conduct intense physical inspections.
- Diplomatic, law enforcement, and intelligence devices will be detected during this phase.

**10. Special Inspection Activities (as needed):**
- Use Non-Linear Junction Detectors (NLJD), X-ray, radiographic, and fluoroscope inspections, and magnetic anomaly inspections.

**11. Preventive Actions (by special request):**
- Seal and dust all cavities, wall plates, and artifacts.
- Install acoustic, ultrasonic, IR, and RF "cloaks."
- Install IPM alarms and associated security systems.
- Install encryption devices, high-security locks, doors, and hinges.
- Provide client education and training.

**12. Post-Inspection Activities:**
- Present findings verbally before leaving.
- Provide a hard copy report if requested.
- Implement corrective and follow-up actions.
- Offer recurring TSCM services if appropriate.

**13. If an Eavesdropping Device or Activity is Detected:**
- Collect documentation regarding the device or activity.
- Notify law enforcement agencies if appropriate.
- Conduct forensic identification and analysis of the device.
- Engage in counter-surveillance and counter-intelligence activities.
