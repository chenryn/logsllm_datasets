Spy Shop “Toys”
The U.S. State Department estimates that at least 800 million dollars of illegal
bugging and eavesdropping equipment is imported and installed into
corporations in the United States each year.  The majority of this equipment is illegally
imported into the United States from France, Germany, Lebanon, Italy, Canada, Israeli, England, Japan,
Taiwan, South Africa, and a host of other countries.  Additionally, anyone with a soldering iron and a basic
understanding of electronics can build and install an eavesdropping device. The raw materials to build such
a device may be easily obtained at Radio Shack, or salvaged from consumer electronic devices such as
cordless telephones, intercom systems, and televisions.  In the United States over six millions dollars worth
of surveillance devices are sold to the public each day. Most of these products are sold from storefront
operations, spy shops, attorneys, and via private investigators located in major metro areas such as New
York, Miami, Los Angles, San Francisco, Dallas, Chicago, and Minneapolis. This does not include the tens
of billions spent each year for legitimate eavesdropping products purchased by law enforcement, military,
and intelligence agencies. This equipment is commonly sold over the counter, via mail order, and through
the Internet. Most of these bugging devices cost only a few dollars, but highly sophisticated, quality products
may be purchased for less than one thousand dollars.  In New York City alone there are over 85 companies
which will not only sell you the eavesdropping device, but will break into the targets office to install the
device, and for an additional fee will provide a monitoring and transcription service.

The FBI and other federal law enforcement agencies have repeatedly
indicated that they lack the resources and training to enforce or properly
investigate the technical security threat within the United States.
Technical surveillance and industrial espionage is a serious problem which
can have a VERY GRAVE IMPACT on
your company and your own personal freedoms.
