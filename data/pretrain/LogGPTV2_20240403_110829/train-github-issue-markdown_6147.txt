The following shows only 1 failed test:
    julia> @testset "foo $i" for i=1:3
             @test 2==3+i
           end
    foo 1: Test Failed
      Expression: 2 == 3 + i
       Evaluated: 2 == 4

However, if you manually write out the loop, all three tests are run:
    julia> @testset "foo" begin
             @test 2==3+1
             @test 2==3+2
             @test 2==3+3

I don't think this is intended (see the discussion in #21594). If this is
intended behavior, it should probably be better documented.
