User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题SSH doesn't ask for password, gives "permission denied" immediately Trying to SSH using a user account; root account works but I am specifying a private key.  User account simply gives "Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-with-mic) without prompting me for my password at all.

How can I fix this so I can log in with a password, and NOT a key?  I don't want to use a private key for this right now, but a regular account.

Assistant: The server has setting

 PasswordAuthentication no 


Change it to yes and after a restart you'll be able to use password authentication.
