### Fingerprinting Detection and Verification

For each fingerprinting method, we have designed a detection algorithm that takes the context as input and returns a binary classification. This classification indicates whether a script uses a specific fingerprinting method when embedded on a first-party site. Additionally, the algorithm identifies any properties that are set or returned during this process.

#### Manual Verification Approaches

When manual verification is necessary, our approach varies based on the level of script obfuscation:

1. **Non-Obfuscated Scripts:**
   - We manually inspect the archived copy of the script, following the procedure outlined in Section 3.2.

2. **Obfuscated Scripts:**
   - For scripts that are heavily obfuscated and difficult to inspect directly, we embed a copy of the script in isolation on a dummy HTML page.
   - We then use the Firefox JavaScript Deobfuscator extension to inspect the script. The extension can be found [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/javascript-deobfuscator/).

We also perform occasional spot checks on live versions of sites and scripts, reverting to the archived copies if discrepancies are found.
