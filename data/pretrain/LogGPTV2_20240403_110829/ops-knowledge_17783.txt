**Issue: Running Jupyter Notebook on Mac OS X**

I was wondering if anyone has successfully installed and run Jupyter Notebook (previously known as IPython Notebook) on Mac OS X. I managed to run it in the terminal, but encountered problems when I tried to start the notebook version.

Here is the error message I received:

```python
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/tayyangki/anaconda/bin/ipython", line 9, in <module>
    load_entry_point('ipython==2.0.0-dev', 'console_scripts', 'ipython')()
  ...
  File "/Users/tayyangki/anaconda/lib/python2.7/locale.py", line 443, in _parse_localename
    raise ValueError, 'unknown locale: %s' % localename
ValueError: unknown locale: UTF-8
```

**Solution: Specifying the Python Version During Installation**

After some troubleshooting, I found the solution to this issue. For Mac OS X, the installation process can be tricky. Instead of using the generic `easy_install ipython` command, you need to specify the Python version. 

To install Jupyter Notebook for Python 2.7, use the following command:

```sh
easy_install ipython2.7
```

Once I used this specific command, everything worked smoothly, and I was able to run Jupyter Notebook without any further issues.

I hope this helps others who might encounter similar problems. If you have any additional questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask.
