User: I writing code that should compiled and run on both Windows and unix like Linux. I know about difference between line endings, but question is which to prefer for my code? Does it matter? I want it to be consistent - say all my code uses LF only, or is it better CRLF only? Are there critaria for comparing?
If it matters mostly I care for C++ and Python codes
Assistant: For the code itself, it does not matter. All reasonably modern editors and compilers handle both just as well (I presume you are not using notepad :-) ). Just use the line ending of the main development platform.
