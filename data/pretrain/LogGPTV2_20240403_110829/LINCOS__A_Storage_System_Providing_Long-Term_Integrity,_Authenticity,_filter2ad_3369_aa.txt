ABSTRACT
The amount of digital data that requires long-term pro-
tection of integrity, authenticity, and conﬁdentiality grows
rapidly. Examples include electronic health records, genome
data, and tax data. In this paper we present the secure stor-
age system LINCOS, which provides protection of integrity,
authenticity, and conﬁdentiality in the long-term, i.e., for an
indeﬁnite time period. It is the ﬁrst such system. It uses the
long-term integrity scheme COPRIS, which is also presented
here and is the ﬁrst such scheme that does not leak any infor-
mation about the protected data. COPRIS uses information-
theoretic hiding commitments for conﬁdentiality-preserving
integrity and authenticity protection. LINCOS uses proac-
tive secret sharing for conﬁdential storage of secret data.
We also present implementations of COPRIS and LINCOS.
A special feature of our LINCOS implementation is the use
of quantum key distribution and one-time pad encryption
for information-theoretic private channels within the proac-
tive secret sharing protocol. The technological platform for
this is the Tokyo QKD Network, which is one of worlds most
advanced networks of its kind. Our experimental evaluation
establishes the feasibility of LINCOS and shows that in view
of the expected progress in quantum communication tech-
nology, LINCOS is a promising solution for protecting very
sensitive data in the cloud.

sively grow in the future. For example, Japanese hospitals
use redundant cloud storage to protect sensitive medical
data from loss due to natural catastrophes [17]. Also, in his
state of the union address 2015, the U.S. President Barack
Obama announced a Precision Medicine Initiative which will
require to digitally store the health data of virtually all U.S.
citizens.
Protection requirements. Digitally stored data require pro-
tection throughout their whole lifetime which may be very
long. Important protection goals are integrity, authenticity,
and conﬁdentiality. Integrity means that illegitimate and ac-
cidental changes of the data can be discovered. Authenticity
refers to the origin of the data being identiﬁable. Conﬁden-
tiality guarantees that only authorized parties are able to ac-
cess the data. For example, consider medical data. Their in-
tegrity is extremely important because changes may lead to
incorrect treatment with serious health consequences. Au-
thenticity is required for liability reasons and conﬁdentiality
protects the privacy of the involved individuals. Medical
data may have to be kept as long as the respective patients
are alive or even beyond this time. So the required protec-
tion period may be more than 100 years. Other examples
for sensitive long-lived data are genome data, governmental
secrets, and tax data.
Current cryptography is unsuitable. Unfortunately, cur-
rent technology does not provide integrity, authenticity, and
conﬁdentiality protection over such a long time. The cryp-
tographic algorithms used today for such protection, such
as AES encryption and RSA signatures, fail to provide suﬃ-
cient security guarantees. They are complexity-based which
means that their security relies on the intractability of cer-
tain algorithmic problems, e.g., integer factorization. How-
ever, cryptanalytic power is steadily increasing. Accord-
ing to Moore’s law, the computing speed doubles every 18
months. Also, there is algorithmic progress. Hence, keys
chosen today will be too short in the future. For exam-
ple, in their original RSA paper [22], the authors estimate
the required RSA modulus size: “using 200 digits provides
a margin of safety against future developments.” However
less than 30 years later factoring 200 decimal digit numbers
became feasible [2]. This situation is very critical. Adver-
saries may store encrypted data now and decrypt them later
when the encryption algorithm becomes broken which may
happen during the lifetime of the protected data. Techno-
logically, this appears to be quite feasible. For instance, the
Utah Data Center of the NSA has an estimated capacity of
4614 to 12 Exabytes (1018 bytes) which allows to store huge
amounts of encrypted data for a long time.
The question arises whether it is possible and feasible to
provide long-term protection of integrity, authenticity, and
conﬁdentiality of digital data. Here and in the remainder of
this paper we deﬁne long-term protection as protection for
an indeﬁnite time period.
There exist several partial solutions to this problem. For
overviews of conﬁdentiality and integrity/authenticity re-
lated solutions see [5] and [27], respectively. These surveys
also contain the relevant references.
Conﬁdentiality of data in transit. In 1949 Claude Shan-
non presented his model of information-theoretic conﬁden-
tiality protection and proved that one-time-pad encryption
(OTP) provides such protection for transmitted data (data
in transit). However, OTP keys are as long as the pro-
tected data, can only be used once, and are required to
be exchanged in an information-theoretically secure fashion.
Therefore, OTP encryption has been only used for special
applications such as military applications with key exchange
by trusted couriers. In the past decades, other methods of
such key exchange have been developed, including schemes
based on the bounded storage, noisy channel, or limited ac-
cess models, and quantum key distribution (QKD). Among
these options, QKD is by far the most advanced, both the-
oretically and experimentally. For example, many countries
such as Austria, China, Japan, Switzerland, and the USA
are currently deploying QKD-protected backbones. For ex-
ample, they use QKD to protect keys for complexity-based
symmetric encryption. However, in this case no information-
theoretic security is achieved.
Conﬁdentiality of data at rest. Unfortunately, OTP en-
cryption is unsuitable for stored data. This is because OTP
requires using and protecting one-time keys that are as long
as the original data. Hence, nothing is gained by using OTP.
Instead, proactive secret sharing can be used to provide
information-theoretic conﬁdentiality protection of stored data.
Proactive secret sharing decomposes the secret into n shares
in such a way that a threshold number k ≤ n of shares is re-
quired to reconstruct the secret while any smaller number of
shares reveals no information about the secret. The shares
are renewed on a regular basis in order to prevent attacks
of mobile adversaries who may be able to learn more and
more shares over time. Such solutions are well suited for
cloud storage systems and are already used in this context
[19]. However, as in currently used secret sharing solutions
communication protection is only complexity-based, they do
not provide information-theoretic conﬁdentiality.
Integrity and authenticity. There are standardized solu-
tions for long-term integrity and authenticity protection (see
[11]) which are already used in practice. They utilize time-
stamp chains to prolong the validity of complexity-based dig-
ital signatures thereby protecting integrity and authenticity
for any length of time. However, these solutions prohibit
long-term conﬁdentiality protection. This is because they
submit hashes of the protected data to timestamp authori-
ties. As cryptographic hash functions only oﬀer complexity-
based security, they may leak information over time. This
is also why the solutions in [16] and [21] do not support
long-term conﬁdentiality protection.
In summary, the problem of long-term protection of in-
tegrity, authenticity, and conﬁdentiality of digital data is
urgent and a comprehensive solution that provides such pro-
tection is not known so far.
1.2 Contribution
In this paper we present the ﬁrst storage solution that si-
multaneously protects integrity, authenticity, and conﬁden-
tiality of digital data for an indeﬁnite period of time. We
analyze its security and experimentally study its feasibility.
As our solution uses a distributed storage system, it is suit-
able for cloud applications.
Conﬁdentiality-preserving long-term integrity protec-
tion. Our ﬁrst contribution is the new scheme COPRIS. It
is the ﬁrst long-term integrity scheme that is conﬁdential-
ity preserving, i.e., it does not leak any information about
the protected data to third party services. It also provides
authenticity protection if the protected data is signed and
the signature is protected together with the data. The idea
in COPRIS is to no longer timestamp the protected doc-
uments. Instead, information-theoretically hiding commit-
ments to these documents are timestamped. These com-
mitments never leak any information about the documents.
Information-theoretically hiding commitments can only be
computationally binding [4]. Therefore, commitments are
renewed on a regular basis.
Long-term integrity, authenticity, and conﬁdentiality
protection. Our second contribution is the secure storage
system LINCOS. It is the ﬁrst storage system that simultane-
ously protects integrity, authenticity, and conﬁdentiality of
stored data in the long-term. We present a security analysis
and report on our implementation and thorough experimen-
tal evaluation of LINCOS.
In LINCOS, a document owner communicates with an in-
tegrity system and a conﬁdentiality system. The integrity
system is based on COPRIS which we implemented as a Java
application. The conﬁdentiality system uses private chan-
nels and proactive secret sharing. We realize information-
theoretically secure private channels using QKD and OTP
in the Tokyo QKD Network. This network is one of worlds
most advanced QKD networks and allows for a reliable fea-
sibility study.
Experimental evaluation. We report on an experiment
that simulates protecting documents of diﬀerent sizes for 100
years (Appendix C). Integrity protection of our solution is
very eﬃcient in storage space and computation. In the case
of conﬁdentiality protection, the limiting factor turns out
to be the speed of QKD key generation. The average key
supply that we currently achieve is 40 kb/s. So transmitting
1 GB of data requires 2.3 days of prior key accumulation.
This allows for proactive secret sharing of 158 GB with a
share renewal period of 2 years. However, in the near future
key rates of 1 Mb/s can be expected which will reduce the
time for distributing a 1 GB key to 2.2 hours. Thus it will
be possible to protect 4 TB with a share renewal period of
2 years. For example, 4 TB is the size of the genomes of
roughly 5000 persons.
LINCOS is well suited for long-term storage systems. Avail-
ability requirements in such systems, in particular in case of
natural or other catastrophes, suggest to redundantly store
462the data in multiple locations which are far apart from each
other. In fact, redundant storage is already common prac-
tice in many scenarios (e.g., [17]). LINCOS can be used in
these scenarios and additionally achieves long-term integrity,
authenticity, and conﬁdentiality protection.
2. CRYPTOGRAPHIC COMPONENTS
In this section we give a brief overview of the crypto-
graphic components used in COPRIS and LINCOS. For a
more detailed description we refer to the full paper. Cryp-
tographic components may provide computational security
or information-theoretic security. Some components, such as
commitment schemes, may even have both properties for dif-
ferent functionalities. A computationally secure component
is usually parametrized with a security parameter which de-
termines the hardness of the underlying computational prob-
lem. The security parameter is chosen such that the cryp-
tographic component remains secure for the intended usage
period.
Timestamps. Timestamps are issued by timestamp services
using timestamp schemes [13, 1]. A timestamp scheme in-
volves a protocol Stamp for retrieving timestamps and an
algorithm Verify for veriﬁcation of timestamps. We require
timestamps to be computationally unforgeable [9].
Authenticated channels. An authenticated channel is a mu-
tually authenticated connection between a sender and a re-
ceiver. We require an authenticated channel to guarantee
computationally secure mutual authentication of the sender
and the receiver [3].
Private channels. We also use private channels. In addi-
tion to computationally secure mutual authentication, pri-
vate channels also provide information-theoretic conﬁden-
tiality of the transmitted data [26].
Commitment schemes. A commitment scheme allows a
party to commit to some document without revealing it. A
commitment scheme consists of algorithms Commit for creat-
ing a commitment and Verify for revealing the commitment
and verifying its validity. We require commitment schemes
to be computationally binding and information-theoretically
hiding [20, 10].
Proactive secret sharing. A proactive secret sharing scheme
allows a dealer to distribute a secret among a set of share-
holders such that each shareholder does not learn anything
about the secret. Protocol Share is used to distribute the
secret, protocol Reshare is used to renew the shares to pro-
tect against mobile adversaries who successfully attack one
shareholder after another over time, and protocol Retrieve is
for retrieving the secret from the shareholders. We require
proactive secret sharing schemes to provide information-theo-
retic conﬁdentiality in the mobile adversary model [14].

and authenticity protection and is long-term conﬁdential-
ity preserving, i.e., it does not leak any information about
the protected data. The security of COPRIS is discussed in
Appendix A.
Figure 1 illustrates the functionality of COPRIS. The set-
ting is as follows. A document owner stores a document d
at some time t. He keeps d secret and constructs a proof of
integrity PI for d. Later he may choose to reveal d to an-
other party. This party then uses PI to verify that d existed
at time t. To preserve the conﬁdentiality of d, the proof
of integrity PI is constructed in such a way that no infor-
mation about d is revealed to third parties involved in the
