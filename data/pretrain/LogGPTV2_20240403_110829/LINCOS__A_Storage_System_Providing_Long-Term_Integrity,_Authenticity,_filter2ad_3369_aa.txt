**ABSTRACT**

The volume of digital data requiring long-term protection for integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality is rapidly increasing. Examples include electronic health records, genome data, and tax data. In this paper, we introduce LINCOS, a secure storage system designed to provide these protections over an indefinite time period. LINCOS is the first such system to offer comprehensive long-term security. It employs the COPRIS scheme, which ensures confidentiality by not leaking any information about the protected data. COPRIS uses information-theoretic hiding commitments for confidentiality-preserving integrity and authenticity. LINCOS also incorporates proactive secret sharing for secure storage of sensitive data.

We present implementations of both COPRIS and LINCOS. A notable feature of our LINCOS implementation is the use of quantum key distribution (QKD) and one-time pad (OTP) encryption to establish information-theoretically secure private channels within the proactive secret sharing protocol. This implementation leverages the Tokyo QKD Network, one of the world's most advanced networks of its kind. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the feasibility of LINCOS and highlights its potential as a robust solution for protecting highly sensitive data in the cloud, especially with the expected advancements in quantum communication technology.

**INTRODUCTION**

### 1.1 Motivation and Problem Statement

Today, vast amounts of data are stored digitally, increasingly in cloud-based data centers, and this trend is expected to continue. For example, Japanese hospitals use redundant cloud storage to protect medical data from natural disasters [17]. Additionally, the U.S. Precision Medicine Initiative, announced in 2015, will require the long-term storage of health data for virtually all U.S. citizens.

**Protection Requirements:**
- **Integrity:** Ensures that unauthorized or accidental changes to the data can be detected.
- **Authenticity:** Verifies the origin of the data.
- **Confidentiality:** Ensures that only authorized parties can access the data.

For instance, medical data require high integrity to prevent incorrect treatments, authenticity for liability, and confidentiality to protect patient privacy. Such data may need to be stored for over 100 years, making long-term protection essential.

**Current Cryptography Limitations:**
Current cryptographic methods, such as AES encryption and RSA signatures, rely on computational complexity and are vulnerable to advances in cryptanalysis and computing power. As computing speeds double every 18 months (Moore's Law), keys chosen today may become insecure in the future. Adversaries can store encrypted data now and decrypt it later when the encryption becomes breakable. The NSA's Utah Data Center, with an estimated capacity of 461 to 12 Exabytes, illustrates the feasibility of storing large amounts of encrypted data for extended periods.

**Long-Term Protection:**
The challenge is to provide long-term protection for integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality. While there are partial solutions, a comprehensive approach is needed. For example, information-theoretic confidentiality can be achieved with one-time pad (OTP) encryption, but it is impractical for stored data due to the requirement of keys as long as the data itself. Proactive secret sharing can provide information-theoretic confidentiality for stored data but lacks information-theoretic security in communication.

**Existing Solutions:**
- **Data in Transit:** Claude Shannon's model of information-theoretic confidentiality using OTP provides strong security, but it requires secure key exchange, which is challenging. Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a promising method for secure key exchange.
- **Data at Rest:** Proactive secret sharing can protect stored data, but current implementations do not provide information-theoretic security in communication.
- **Integrity and Authenticity:** Standardized solutions like timestamp chains can extend the validity of digital signatures, but they do not support long-term confidentiality due to the potential leakage of information through hash functions.

### 1.2 Contribution

In this paper, we present LINCOS, the first storage solution that simultaneously protects the integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality of digital data for an indefinite period. We analyze its security and experimentally evaluate its feasibility. LINCOS is suitable for cloud applications due to its distributed storage system.

**COPRIS: Confidentiality-Preserving Long-Term Integrity Scheme**
- **COPRIS** is the first long-term integrity scheme that does not leak any information about the protected data. It uses information-theoretically hiding commitments instead of directly timestamping documents, ensuring confidentiality. These commitments are renewed regularly to maintain security.

**LINCOS: Long-Term Integrity, Authenticity, and Confidentiality Protection**
- **LINCOS** is the first storage system to provide long-term protection for all three security goals. It integrates COPRIS for integrity and authenticity and uses proactive secret sharing for confidentiality. Our implementation includes QKD and OTP for information-theoretically secure private channels, leveraging the Tokyo QKD Network.

**Experimental Evaluation:**
Our experiments simulate the protection of documents of various sizes for 100 years. The results show that LINCOS is efficient in terms of storage and computation for integrity protection. The limiting factor for confidentiality is the speed of QKD key generation, currently at 40 kb/s. However, with expected advancements, key rates of 1 Mb/s will reduce the time required for key distribution, making it feasible to protect large datasets.

LINCOS is well-suited for long-term storage systems, especially in scenarios requiring redundancy to ensure data availability during natural or other catastrophes.

**2. CRYPTOGRAPHIC COMPONENTS**

This section provides an overview of the cryptographic components used in COPRIS and LINCOS. For a detailed description, refer to the full paper.

- **Timestamps:** Issued by timestamp services, timestamps must be computationally unforgeable.
- **Authenticated Channels:** Ensure computationally secure mutual authentication between sender and receiver.
- **Private Channels:** Provide both computationally secure mutual authentication and information-theoretic confidentiality.
- **Commitment Schemes:** Allow a party to commit to a document without revealing it. They must be computationally binding and information-theoretically hiding.
- **Proactive Secret Sharing:** Distributes a secret among shareholders, ensuring information-theoretic confidentiality even against mobile adversaries.

**3. COPRIS: Confidentiality-Preserving Long-Term Integrity Scheme**

COPRIS ensures long-term integrity and authenticity while preserving confidentiality. The scheme involves a document owner who constructs a proof of integrity (PI) for a document \( d \). The PI is constructed in a way that no information about \( d \) is revealed to third parties. The security of COPRIS is discussed in Appendix A.

**Figure 1: Schematic of COPRIS**

The figure illustrates the functionality of COPRIS, where a document owner stores a document \( d \) at time \( t \), keeps \( d \) secret, and constructs a proof of integrity \( PI \) for \( d \). Later, if the owner chooses to reveal \( d \), another party can use \( PI \) to verify that \( d \) existed at time \( t \) without any information about \( d \) being leaked.
