**ATT&CK ID:** M1017  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** User Training

User training is a critical component in defending against social engineering and spearphishing attacks, including those that use malicious links or exploit OAuth 2.0 for phishing consent. Through comprehensive training, users can learn to recognize the signs of such attacks and take appropriate precautions. 

One effective practice is to visually verify the URLs of websites before visiting them. However, this method can be challenging due to the use of homographs in both ASCII and Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs), which can make it difficult to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent domains. 

To mitigate these risks, organizations should implement regular phishing and cybersecurity training programs. These programs can help raise awareness and educate users on the importance of carefully checking URLs and other indicators of potential threats. By fostering a culture of vigilance, organizations can significantly reduce the likelihood of successful social engineering and phishing attacks.
