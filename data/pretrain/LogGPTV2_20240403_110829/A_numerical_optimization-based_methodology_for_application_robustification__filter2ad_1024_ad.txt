**Optimization Techniques and Fault Tolerance in Numerical Algorithms**

**5.3.5 All Enhancements**
Incorporating all the above techniques, we observed that simulated annealing provides the most substantial benefit for any individual constraint. As shown in Figure 9, using these techniques, the solver achieves an 88% reduction in floating-point operations. This approach also reduces the penalty to the actual objective, especially if these constraints are periodically increased.

**5.4 Conjugate Gradient Method**
While stochastic gradient descent (SGD) can perform well, it often requires a large number of iterations, leading to significant computational costs. The Conjugate Gradient (CG) method, on the other hand, allows efficient convergence in at most \( n \) iterations, where \( n \) is the dimension of the problem. For a linear system \( Ax = B \), the CG method can guarantee convergence and provide high robustness. 

Figure 10 shows the accuracy of our CG-based implementation for the Least Squares problem when using 10 iterations. Experimentally, the CG-based implementation was 30% faster than the QR and SVD baselines and comparable in accuracy to the Cholesky baseline. Additionally, the CG method was, on average, 20-30% faster than the QR/SVD baselines. 

**6. Limitations and Future Work**
There are several simplifying assumptions in our methodology. For example, the control phases of the application are assumed to be error-free. In future work, we will explore ways to distinguish between data and control phases, and to decrease the number of iterations required for convergence. This will be key in making the methodology more useful and energy-efficient.

**7. Conclusion**
We propose a formal methodology to recast the voltage overscaling problem as an optimization problem and apply optimization-based techniques to find the solution. Our experimental results show that there is considerable potential for using the proposed methodology to reduce the energy consumption of software applications, particularly for data-intensive tasks such as IIR filtering and Least Squares problems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on a generic, optimization-based approach for timing error tolerance in processors.
