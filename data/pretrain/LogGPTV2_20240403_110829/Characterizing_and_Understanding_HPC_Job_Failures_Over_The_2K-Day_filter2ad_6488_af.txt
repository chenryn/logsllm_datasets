### Analysis of RAS Events and Job Failures in the IBM Blue Gene/Q Mira

#### Overview of RAS Events and Job Failures
1. **Termination Involving Message IDs:**
   - 25% of the job terminations are associated with the first two rows of Table XVI, which list specific message IDs.

2. **Most Frequent RAS Events:**
   - The most frequent RAS events are node errors (e.g., 00080014 and 0008000B), accounting for over 78.16% of system-reliability-based job failures (Table XVII).

3. **Network-Related Errors:**
   - Network-related errors constitute 2.81% of system-reliability-related job failures.
   - Software errors, such as those occurring in kernels, account for about 16.22% of these failures.

4. **Firmware as a Major Root Cause:**
   - Firmware, which provides low-level control for specific hardware, is the primary cause of job terminations.

#### Detailed Analysis
**Table XVI: Fraction of Message IDs Affecting Jobs**
- This table shows the percentage distribution of RAS event message IDs that affect jobs. For example, the message ID 000A000D accounts for 11.39% of the affected jobs.

**Table XVII: System-Reliability-Related Job Failures**
- This table provides a detailed breakdown of the types of RAS events and their contribution to job failures. Node errors (e.g., 00080014) are the most significant, followed by network-related and software errors.

**Table XVIII: Contingency Table with User Name and RAS Message ID**
- This table correlates RAS message IDs with user names, showing which users are more frequently affected by specific types of RAS events. For instance, users u5 and u10 are often associated with node errors (msg ID 00080014), while users u2 and u3 are more likely to be affected by kernel panic/errors (msg ID 000A000D).

**Table XIX: Contingency Table with Core-Hours and RAS Message ID**
- This table shows the correlation between core-hours and RAS message IDs. For example, the node error (msg ID 00080014) predominantly affects jobs with large core-hour requirements, while kernel panic/errors (msg ID 000A000D) are more common in jobs with core-hours in the [1k,2k) range.

#### Takeaways
1. **User-Specific RAS Events:**
   - Different users tend to be affected by specific types of RAS events, likely due to the unique characteristics of their jobs, such as execution scale, running settings, or application nature (computation-intensive or memory-intensive). For example, u5 and u10 are more prone to node errors, while u2 and u3 are more affected by kernel errors.

2. **Core-Hour Correlation:**
   - The RAS events affecting jobs are also correlated with the core-hours consumed. Large-core-hour jobs are more likely to experience node errors, while medium-core-hour jobs are more susceptible to kernel errors.

3. **Spatial Distribution of RAS Events:**
   - The spatial distribution of RAS events on compute and I/O racks is non-uniform. Some midplanes, such as R03-M0 and R1C-M0, have significantly more frequent issues than others, like R11-M0. The most error-prone rack and midplane have 35 and 27 fatal RAS events, respectively, while the minimum numbers of fatal events per rack and midplane are 6 and 1, respectively.

4. **MTTI (Mean Time to Interruption):**
   - The MTTI for the Mira system, from the perspective of jobs and users, is approximately 3.48 days, indicating the real system-related failure rate for users.

#### Future Work
- The study will be extended to include more supercomputers for a comprehensive comparison, providing a broader understanding of job failure features and their impact on system reliability.
