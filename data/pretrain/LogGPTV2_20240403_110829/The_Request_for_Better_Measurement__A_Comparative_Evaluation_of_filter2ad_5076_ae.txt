criteria in the future, in order to include those session-key-
related goals while eliminating the identiﬁed redundancies.
8. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we ﬁrst revisited 19 improvements over
Xu et al.’s scheme as case studies to show that the current
research pattern is unsatisfactory: more “improvements” ac-
tually yield less security and there is lack of fair assessment
of existing schemes. We then traced the root cause of the
failure by showing that, some critical criteria in the state-of-
the-art evaluation set are unworkable (impracticable) due
to a number of ambiguities. We further propose viable
ﬁxes and reﬁnements. The eﬀectiveness of our reﬁnements
are tested by a comparative evaluation of 34 representative
two-factor schemes. Particularly, we, for the ﬁrst time,
provide a taxonomy of smart-card-loss attacks. This in-
depth understanding of attacker behaviors constitutes a
substantial step forward in resolving the current crux in
achieving truly two-factor security. It is expected that this
work would facilitate better measurement of existing and
future two-factor schemes.
