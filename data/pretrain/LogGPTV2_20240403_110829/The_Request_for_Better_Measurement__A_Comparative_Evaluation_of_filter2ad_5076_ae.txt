### 8. Conclusion

In this paper, we first revisited 19 improvements over Xu et al.'s scheme as case studies to demonstrate that the current research pattern is unsatisfactory. Specifically, many of these "improvements" actually result in reduced security, and there is a lack of fair and comprehensive assessments of existing schemes. We then traced the root cause of this issue by identifying several critical criteria in the state-of-the-art evaluation set that are unworkable due to ambiguities. To address these issues, we proposed viable fixes and refinements. The effectiveness of our refinements was tested through a comparative evaluation of 34 representative two-factor authentication schemes. Notably, we provided, for the first time, a taxonomy of smart-card-loss attacks. This in-depth understanding of attacker behaviors represents a significant step forward in achieving truly robust two-factor security. It is expected that this work will facilitate better measurement and assessment of both existing and future two-factor authentication schemes.
