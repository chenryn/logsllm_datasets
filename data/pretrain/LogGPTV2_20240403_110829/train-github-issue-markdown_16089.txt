When selecting a new 'Canvas zone' I should, as a user, click on 'edit
layout'. However, I am able to click on 'Apply'. The screen closes, but
nothing happens and the zone is never created.

Additionally, the 'create new layout' button is visualized as a zone itself.  
Would make more sense to have this as an action button that will create the
zone and takes you to the Canvas zone editor directly.
