User: Write a Python script that finds a specific string from multiple files and replaces it with another string.
Assistant: The following is an example script written in Python 3 that can find and replace specific strings from multiple specified files: ```python import fileinput import os # Input the string to be found and replaced search_string = input("Enter the string to search for: ") replace_string = input("Enter the replacement string: ") # Enter the file path and name to be modified, use spaces to separate multiple files file_paths = input("Enter the file paths and names (separated by space ): ") # Split file path into list file_list = file_paths.split() # Loop through each file and replace string for filename in file_list: # Avoid creating duplicate files in local folder backup_filename = filename + ".bak " # Create a backup file os.rename(filename, backup_filename) # Open the backup file and write the replaced content with fileinput.input(backup_filename, inplace=True) as fin: for line in fin: line = line.replace(search_string , replace_string) print(line, end="") # Delete the backup file os.remove(backup_filename) print("String replacement complete!") ``` Please note that this script will replace all matching strings, so please Make sure the string you enter correctly matches what you want to replace. If you are not sure whether all matches should be replaced, replace `line.replace(search_string, replace_string)` in the script with `line.replace(search_string, replace_string, 1)` to replace only the first occurrence of a match item.
