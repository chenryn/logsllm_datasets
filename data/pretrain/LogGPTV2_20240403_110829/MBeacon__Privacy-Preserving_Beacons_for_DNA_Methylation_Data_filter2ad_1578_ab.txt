A. Threat Model
In general, the goal of membership inference attacks is
to predict whether the victim is a member of the database
given certain knowledge about the victim. For instance, an
attacker with access to the sequenced methylation values of
her victim aims to infer whether the victim is in the database
containing methylation data collected from some HIV carriers.
By knowing who is member of the study, the attacker is able
to infer the HIV status of her victim, even though (to the best
of our knowledge) the HIV status is not directly detectable
from the methylation values. This example demonstrates the
severe consequence of membership inference. Moreover, all
the existing attacks against genomic Beacons are membership
inference attacks [36], [29], [1], [45].
We assume that the adversary has access to the victim’s
methylation data m(v) and additional background knowledge
K that we instantiate later. The adversary’s goal is to perform
an attack A, to decide whether v is in the database of institution
I by querying the MBeacon BI. Formally, the membership
inference attack is deﬁned as follows:
A : (m(v), BI, K ) → {0, 1},
(2)
where 1 means that the victim is in the MBeacon database and
0 that she is not. If v’s methylation values are indeed part of
the MBeacon’s database (m(v) ∈ I) and the attack output is
1, then the attack achieves a true positive for v. If the output
is 0, then it is a false negative. However, if v’s methylation
values are not part of BI (i.e., m(v) /∈ I) and the attack output
is 0, this is a true negative, otherwise, if the output is 1, it is
a false positive.
B. Attacking Methylation Beacons
We rely on the likelihood-ratio (LR) test to realize our
membership inference attack for two main reasons. First, by
the Neyman-Pearson Lemma [20], [37], the LR test achieves
the highest power (true-positive rate) for a given false-positive
rate in binary hypothesis testing if the theoretical preconditions
are met. Second, the LR test has been successfully used by
Shringarpure and Bustamante [36] and Raisaro et al. [29] for
attacking genomic Beacons.
In general, the LR test formulates a null hypothesis H0
and an alternative hypothesis H1, and compares the quotient
of the two hypotheses’ likelihoods to a threshold. Our null
hypothesis H0 is deﬁned as the queried victim v not being in
the MBeacon (m(v) /∈ I), and the alternative hypothesis H1
as the queried victim being in the MBeacon (m(v) ∈ I).
The adversary submits a series
−→
Q = (cid:104)q1, . . . , qn(cid:105) (n ≤
M) of queries to BI with her victim’s methylation values,
−→
i.e., m(v), and get a list of responses, denoted by BI(
Q ) =
(cid:104)BI(q1), . . . , BI(qn)(cid:105). Assuming that the different responses
are independent,4 the log-likelihood of the responses is

Q )) =
L(BI(
BI(qi) log(Pr(BI(qi) = 1))+
(1 − BI(qi)) log(Pr(BI(qi) = 0)).
i=1
(3)
To implement the two hypotheses H0 and H1, we need to
model Pr(BI(q) = 1) and Pr(BI(q) = 0). The approach
in [36] cannot be directly applied as it is designed for genomic
data, which is discrete. In contrast to that, methylation data is
represented as a continuous value between 0 and 1. We propose
to bin the methylation values into b equal-width bins that
represent the range of values the querier might be interested
in.5 Here, b is a parameter of the MBeacon system, and we
empirically study the inﬂuence of different values for b on the
attack performance in Section V.
Thus, we represent a methylation Beacon as BbI . The
probability Pr(BbI (q) = 0) to get a “No” answer, respectively
Pr(BbI (q) = 1) to get a “Yes” answer can be described in our
case as:
Pr(BbI (q) = 0) =(1 − τ b(q))N
Pr(BbI (q) = 1) =1 − (1 − τ b(q))N
(4)
(5)
Here, N is the number of patients in the Beacon. Following
previous works on genomic Beacons [36], [29], we assume
N to be publicly known and therefore being part of the
attacker’s background knowledge K . Meanwhile, τ b is the
probability of a patient having a methylation value in the
4We assume the adversary does not submit a single query for multiple
times, and we assume correlations between different methylation positions
are not exploited, because they are not (yet) well studied. Note that the
same independence assumption has been used in previous works on genomic
Beacons [36], [29].
5There are two reasons why we only study equal-width bins: First, without
further knowledge about the data distribution underlying the Beacon, it is
hard to deﬁne a suitable bin width. Second, all Beacons should share the
same interface to combine the answers in a well-deﬁned way. This would not
be possible if the bins vary across different Beacons based on the dataset they
are composed of.
interval determined by the respective bin. We can assume
that the adversary has the exact probability as part of her
background knowledge K . However, if the exact probability
is not available and the adversary only knows the mean and
standard deviation of people’s methylation values at a certain
position, she can approximate the probability with normal
(Gaussian) distribution using µpos as the mean and σpos as the
standard deviation of the queried position.6 Concretely, τ b(q)
is estimated as:(cid:102)τ b(q) =(cid:102)τ b((pos, val )) =
cdf(µpos , σpos , br) − cdf(µpos , σpos , bl)
(6)
where cdf is the cumulative distribution function of the normal
distribution, and br (bl) denotes the value of the corresponding
bin’s right (left) edge. Notice that, like in the genomic setting,
the general probability of having a speciﬁc allele is required
as well, and it is realized by assuming the population’s allele
frequencies are part of the attacker’s background knowledge
K .
By inserting the probabilities from Equations 4 and 5 into
Equation 3, we get

BbI (qi) log(1−δ(1−τ b(qi))N−1)+
(1 − BbI (qi)) log(δ(1−τ b(qi))N−1).
i=1

(8)
Notice that for the H0 hypothesis, we consider all N patients
in the database. However, for the H1 hypothesis where we
assume the target being part of the database, we consider only
N−1 other patients that contribute to the answer in addition to
the target. It might occur that two measurements of methylation
data from the same patient and tissue type differ, either due to
measurement errors or changes over time. Thus, the target may
be part of the Beacon, but the attacker’s data differs from the
data entry in the Beacon. Similar to previous works, we denote
this probability, i.e., measurement error, by δ and empirically
evaluate its inﬂuence on our attack. We assume δ to be part
of the attacker’s background knowledge.
In the end, the log of the likelihood-ratio is given by:
Λ =LH0 (BbI (
n(cid:88)

(1 − BbI (qi)) log
(cid:19)

Q ))

1 − δ(1 − τ b(qi))N−1

If Λ is lower than some threshold t, we reject
the null
hypothesis and predict that the victim is in the MBeacon
database. Otherwise, we conclude that the victim is not.
Finally, the choice of the set of queries (cid:104)q1, . . . , qn(cid:105) in-
ﬂuences the attack performance as well. We follow the same

best, using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and a p-value of 0.1. Other ways to
approximate the probability are left for future work.

approach as Raisaro et al. [29] to rank all possible queries with
their expected information gain: For each methylation position
pos, the attacker computes the difference between the victim’s
methylation value m(v)pos and the general population’s value
(cid:102)τ b(pos, m(v )pos ). The larger this difference, the higher the
probability of getting a “Yes” answer if the target is part of
the Beacon, and simultaneously, the higher the probability of
getting a “No” answer if the target is not part of the Beacon.
Therefore, we assume the attacker decides on the set of queries
(cid:104)q1, . . . , qn(cid:105) using this difference and querying the n most
informative queries.
V. ATTACK EVALUATION
In this section, we evaluate the performance of our mem-
bership inference attack against simulated methylation Bea-
cons to demonstrate the privacy threat.
A. Datasets
For our experiments, we rely on eight diverse datasets
containing methylation proﬁles of patients carrying speciﬁc
diseases. In total, we use methylation proﬁles of 563 individ-
uals. The datasets are available online in the Gene Expression
Omnibus database (GEO),7 and we summarize them in Ta-
ble II. We use six brain tumor datasets, where the methylation
data was sequenced from the respective brain tumor. Moreover,
we also make use of an additional dataset with two types of
inﬂammatory bowel disease, where the methylation data was
sequenced from blood samples, reported in the last two lines
of Table II. All of these data were generated with the Illumina
450k array, effectively determining the DNA methylation at
450,000 ﬁxed positions.
Preprocessing. Most of the datasets have missing methylation
sites for speciﬁc patients or even for all the patients sharing the
same disease. We remove all methylation positions with miss-
ing data, which leaves us with 299,998 different methylation
sites for the combination of all our eight datasets.
Human Subjects and Ethical Considerations. All datasets
are publicly available in their anonymized form. Moreover,
they have been stored and analyzed in anonymized form with-
out having access to non-anonymized data. The membership
inference we carry out does not reveal any more information
than previously known by us.
B. Evaluation Results
We use our three largest8 datasets, i.e., GBM, and both
IBD datasets (referred to as IBD CD and IBD UC), to simulate
three methylation Beacons, respectively. For each methylation
Beacon, we randomly sample 60 patients to construct
its
Beacon database. We follow the approach of previous works
on Beacons testing with uniform sets of patients [36], [29],
[1], [45]. This ensures the attacker can only exploit individual
variances and not disease-induced systematic differences, i.e.,
variances that are unavoidably in the data. Later in Sec-
tion VIII, we explore another attack scenario on heterogeneous
methylation sets.
We assume the adversary has access either to a randomly
chosen sample from the methylation Beacon (“in” patient), or
from the patients with the same disease who are not included in
the methylation Beacon (“out” patient). For the “out” patients,
we use the remainder of the patients that we do not sample
into the methylation Beacon. For the “in” patients, we sample
the same number of patients from the methylation Beacon to
not introduce a bias between “in” and “out” test patients. To
reduce the size bias between GBM and the two IBD sets, we
sample at most 25 test patients. We repeat the random split
of patients into methylation Beacon and testing set 10 times,
which corresponds to a simulation of 500 attackers for GBM,
340 for IBD CD and 300 for IBD UC.
The attackers carry out the LR test as described previously
in Section IV. We simulate attackers without access to the
exact probability τ b(q), because it is an unrealistic assumption
that these are available. In fact, if such knowledge would be
available, a lot of privacy would already be lost. Instead, we
model attackers estimating the probabilities from a general
background population. We combine the main datasets GBM,
IBD UC, IBD CD with the other datasets (Ependymoma,
mHGA, ETMR-PNET, PA and DIPG) as an estimate for the
general population.9 From this combined background data, we
compute the attacker’s background knowledge K as mean and
standard deviation for each methylation position. Apart from
being used in the LR test to estimate frequencies, the means
are used to rank possible queries by their expected information
gain, as discussed in Section IV.
We adopt the AUC, i.e., area under the ROC curve, as
our evaluation metric since it does not
involve picking a
speciﬁc threshold for the LR test. The ROC curve is a 2D
plot which reﬂects the relation between true positive rate and
false positive rate over a series of thresholds for the LR test.
The AUC summarizes the ROC curve as a single value. A ROC
curve closer to top-left border of the plot, thus a larger AUC
value, indicates a better prediction performance. Moreover,
7https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/
8We exclude the mHGA dataset, since it is not uniform but a combination
of 4 subtypes.
9Since general population statistics do not exist yet for methylation values,
we had to estimate them. If the estimate was not accurate and a realistic
attacker could get better estimates, the attack performance could increase.
