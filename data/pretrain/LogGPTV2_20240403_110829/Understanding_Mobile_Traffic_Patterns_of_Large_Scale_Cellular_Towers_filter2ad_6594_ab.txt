tower is normalized by its maximum, and the color presents
the normalized value where red color indicates higher traﬃc
and blue color stands for lower traﬃc as shown in the col-
or bar.
In these measurements, we ﬁnd two observations.
First, the peak hour of one cellular tower, which is marked
as red, is vastly diﬀerent from another during the day time
when serving mobile users. In fact, the variance of the peak
among the selected towers is about 10 hours. Second, while
most of towers experience low traﬃc in early morning, the
ﬁrst several towers in Figure 4(a), of which the latitude is
around 121.60, also have low traﬃc during evening. There-
fore, signiﬁcant diﬀerences of data traﬃc are observed across
cellular towers. Such diﬀerences cause troubles for an ISP
to manage its cellular network. For example, because of the
unique pattern of individual traﬃc, an ISP cannot obtain
the optimal performance by using the same load balancing
strategy, which is built on top of traﬃc patterns, on diﬀer-
ent towers. Therefore, a natural question to ask is that is it
possible to model the traﬃc pattern of thousands of cellular
towers? More speciﬁcally, can we utilize a few simple pat-
terns to present the traﬃc of thousands of cellular towers?
Identifying these patterns of cellular towers would give an
ISP signiﬁcant beneﬁts on network management, including
load balancing, pricing, etc.
Our investigation suggests that at least two, maybe more,
traﬃc patterns exist among thousands of cellular towers.
Figure 5 shows the normalized traﬃc proﬁle of 40 selected
cellular towers deployed in residential area and in business
district for each 0.01 degree latitudes. Compared with the
disorder in both temporal and spatial dimension exhibited
in Figure 4, traﬃc variations for cellular towers in a single
kind of regions are more regular and similar to each other.
In addition, we ﬁnd other two observations in this investi-
gation. First, in terms of the traﬃc of residential area, all
residential towers experience similar traﬃc patterns where
the peak traﬃc is present around 9PM. In addition, only a
small amount of traﬃc is observed between 8AM and 4PM
because most users leave home for work. Similar conclu-
sion can be drawn for towers deployed in business district.
Second, the traﬃc pattern of residential towers is diﬀerent
from towers deployed in business district where peak hour

appears around 1PM. Inspired by these two observations,
we conclude that traﬃc patterns do exist among thousands
of cellular towers. One key question addressed by this pa-
per is ﬁnding out how many traﬃc patterns exist among
thousands of cellular towers and how to identify them.
3.2 Identifying Trafﬁc Patterns of Cell-towers
Investigating traﬃc patterns among thousands of cellular
towers is extremely challenging for three reasons. First, we
have little prior knowledge about the data traﬃc, and do not
know which cell towers may share the same traﬃc pattern
and how the pattern may look like. Second, the measured
cellular traﬃc data is huge in terms of tracing 9,600 cellular
towers for a month. To make matters worse, the measured
data is not clean in terms of unstructured logs. Last but
not least, the measured cellular traﬃc data is noisy where
large variation of traﬃc is observed because the absolute
traﬃc depends on the number of mobile users served. All
these factors make the analysis of cellular traﬃc patterns ex-
tremely challenging. To tackle these challenges, we design,
implement, and evaluate a system which is able to identify
the key traﬃc patterns of such large scale cellular tower-
s. Our system is composed by three key elements: traﬃc
vectorizer, pattern identiﬁer and metric tuner.
Traﬃc vectorizer: We implement a traﬃc vectorizer on
Hadoop platform to convert the large scale unstructured
traﬃc logs into traﬃc usage vectors. The key of designing
the traﬃc vectorizer is a parallel transformer, which takes
the time-domain traﬃc logs of thousands of cellular tow-
ers as its input and converts each cell tower’s logs into a
time-domain traﬃc vector. The vector is constructed in t-
wo phases — aggregation and normalization.
In the ﬁrst
phase, each cellular tower’s traﬃc logs are segmented into
thousands of chunks, with each chunk contains 10-minutes
228traﬃc logs. Then we aggregate the traﬃc logs in each chunk
and generate a traﬃc usage vector.
In the second phase,
we perform zero-score normalization on each vector to elim-
inate their diﬀerences in amplitude, in order to ﬁnd out the
similar traﬃc patterns without the interference of diﬀerent
amplitude. We deﬁne the traﬃc vector of cellular tower j as
Xj = (xj[1], ..., xj[N ])T , with xj[i] stands for the normalized
traﬃc amount in the ith 10-minute time slot. We remove 3
days from the month to make the duration consist of four
entire weeks. Thus, N is number of 28 days’ 10-minutes
segmentation, i.e., 4032 in our analysis.
Pattern identiﬁer: Pattern identiﬁer takes the vector-
ized data from the vectorizer and runs an unsupervised ma-
chine learning algorithm for identifying the key patterns of
cellular tower traﬃc. The pattern identiﬁer addresses one
key challenge of the mining process — unknown patterns,
by exploiting hierarchical clustering[4]. The basic idea of
hierarchical clustering is iteratively merging the nearest t-
wo clusters. It ﬁrst considers each input point as a cluster
and then bottom-up iteratively merges the nearest two clus-
ters until the stop condition is met. In the clustering, we
use the euclidean distance as the distance metric and deﬁne
the distance between clusters as average-linkage distance. In
addition, we set a threshold value as stop condition, which
stops the clustering when the distance between two clusters
is above the threshold value.
Metric tuner: As the number of traﬃc patterns is un-
known, a key question is when the identiﬁer should stop its
clustering. In our system, we use Davies-Bouldin index [18]
to explicitly inform the identiﬁer that the optimum number
of patterns have been identiﬁed. Davies-Bouldin index is
utilized because it measures both the separation of clusters
and cohesion within clusters, which mathematically guaran-
tees good clustering result. The mathematic formulation of
Davies-Bouldin index is as follows,

where the objective function is the Davies-Bouldin index, Xi
is the vectorized data of cellular tower i, Ai is the centroid
of each cluster, R is the number of clusters and Ti is the
numbers of towers within the ith cluster. We minimize the
Davies-Bouldin index by considering two factors — the dis-
tance between clusters Mi,j and Si, which are the average
distance from points to their cluster’s centroid. When the
minimum Davies-Bouldin index is obtained, the optimum
number of patterns is identiﬁed. The variation of DBI is
shown in Figure 6(a), according to which we set the stop
condition—threshold value at 16.33 to achieve optimal clus-
tering result.
Figure 6 shows the ﬁve time-domain patterns identiﬁed
by our system from the 9,600 cellular towers((c) to (g)) and
each cluster’s CDF of points’ distance to its centroid(b). The
ﬁve clusters diﬀer in terms of the time where peak traﬃc
appears as well as the amount of traﬃc experienced during
weekday and weekends. Figure 6(b) shows that the distance
CDF curves of clusters are similar and all of them increase
rapidly as distance increases. 80% of points’ distance to

their clusters’ centroid are less than 10, which implicates the
clustering result is good. The percentage of each cluster’s
cell towers is shown in Table 1, which indicates the third
cluster has most cell towers and second cluster the least.
In conclusion, we implement a system that is able to i-
dentify the key traﬃc patterns among thousands of cellular
towers in this subsection. Since the ﬁve clusters are given
by the hierarchical classiﬁer, an interesting question to ask
is what are the geographical locations where these ﬁve types
of towers are deployed?
3.3 Geographical Context of Trafﬁc Patterns
To understand the geographical locations of cell towers
of the ﬁve clusters, we ﬁrst manually label typical towers
in the ﬁve patterns with urban functional regions and then
validate the labels of all towers in each pattern with ground
truth.

3.3.1 Label Patterns with Urban Functional Regions
To understand the geographical context of traﬃc pattern-
s, we label the ﬁve traﬃc patterns using urban functional
regions. This process is nontrivial because given thousand-
s of cellular towers, labelling cannot be done one by one
manually. To address this challenge, we use a few human-
labeled areas and combine with points of interests (POI)
distribution to achieve accurate labelling. POI is a speciﬁc
point location of a certain function such as restaurant and
shopping mall. An area’s POI distribution reﬂects its func-
tion. Therefore, studying POI distribution of one location
can help us to accurately identify patterns’ labels. The POI
data we study is collected via APIs provided by Baidu Map
introduced before. For calculating the POI distribution, we
measure the number of four main types of POI, which are
resident, transport, oﬃce and entertainment, within 200m
of each cell towers. Figure 7 shows the geographical density
map of towers in each cluster where deep color stands for
higher density. Zooming in the urban area, for each clus-
ter we pick the point with the highest tower density and
calculate their POI distribution as summarized in Table 2.
Then, we infer the urban function region of each cluster by
checking the geographical location information in Figure 7
and POI distribution in Table 2. We obtain the following
geographical labels for the ﬁve clusters.
Resident area:
Figure 7 shows that the towers in this
cluster (green color) are mainly distributed on the surround-
ing areas of the city. In addition, the highest density point,
A, is located in a large resident neighborhood. Table 2 also
shows that the number of residential points in A is more
than others. Therefore,we label the area covered by this
cluster’s cell towers as residential area.
Transport area:
In Figure 7, the second cluster’s high-
est density point B is close to an area with three subway
stations and one overpass. In addition, Table 2 shows that
around location B the number of transport POI is high-
er than the rest even though its absolute number is small.
Therefore, we label this cluster as transport area.
Oﬃce area: Figure 7 shows that the highest density point
C is a well-known business district in Shanghai. This loca-
tion mark is also veriﬁed by the third row of Table 2 where
the number of oﬃce POI is dominant for the area 200m from
C . As a result, we label this cluster as oﬃce area.
(a) Area A
(b) Area B
Figure 8: Two case studies for validating the geo-
graphical context of the ﬁve identiﬁed patterns.
Entertainment area:
The highest density point D in
Figure 7 is a large shopping mall and entertainment park in
Shanghai. Table 2 also shows that its number of entertain-
ment POI is more than the rest. Therefore, we label this
cluster as entertainment area.
Comprehensive area: Figure 7 shows the tower density
map of the last cluster, where we observe uniform distri-
bution of towers across the city.
In addition, the highest
density point, E , is a comprehensive area, which includes
all kinds of urban functions, including residential area, of-
ﬁces, etc. The POI distribution of point E does not suggest
obvious land mark either. Therefore, it is labeled as com-
prehensive area.
3.3.2 Validate the Labels
In this section, we validate the labels of the ﬁve patterns
in both micro and macro scale. Our labels are obtained by
checking the geographical locations of a few towers in each
cluster and verifying with the corresponding POI distribu-
tion. However, the correctness of labelling across all 9,600
cellular towers remains unknown. Therefore, we perform
further analysis to validate our labels with POI data from
micro and macro two perspectives.
Validate with case study: To validate our labels in mi-
cro scale, we randomly choose two areas shown in Figure 8.
According to the POI data, we ﬁrst color diﬀerent functional
regions in the area with diﬀerent colors. Green represents
residential area, yellow represents transport area, red rep-
resents oﬃce area, and blue represents entertainment area.
After that, we investigate the labels of cell towers locating in
the area. Observing both Figure 8(a) and (b), we ﬁnd that
the labels attached to the cell towers exactly match with the
functional regions, which justiﬁes our labels’ correctness.
Validate with 9,600 towers’ POI: To validate our la-
bels in macro scale, we perform further analysis on all 9,600
towers’ POI. However, diﬀerent types POI vary in magni-
tude signiﬁcantly because of their diﬀerent nature. To elim-
inate this interference, we ﬁrst perform min-max normaliza-
tion on each type’s POI and then average them by clusters,
