User: The following is 20 lines of a system log. Each line consists of a timestamp, log level, process id, relevant software component, and the log content. Think step-by-step and step and summarize this log chunk:

Assistant: This log chunk shows that the kernel is logging information about the rbs signal handler, interrupts, and critical input interrupts. The log indicates that there were 0 microseconds spent in the rbs signal handler during 0 calls, 0 microseconds was the maximum time for a single instance of a correctable ddr, and there were a total of 1966, 10738, 10714, 10718, 10698, 10644, 10752, 10666, and 10738 interrupts. Additionally, there were 0 critical input interrupts and 0 microseconds total spent on critical input interrupts, with 0 microseconds max time in a critical input interrupt.
