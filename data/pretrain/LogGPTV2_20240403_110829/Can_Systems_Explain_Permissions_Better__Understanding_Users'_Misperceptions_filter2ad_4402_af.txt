### Contextual Integrity and User Permission Decisions

Wijesekera et al. [62] discovered that users may make different decisions for the same permission when it is used in different contexts. They further proposed a machine learning approach that leverages users' past permission decisions to predict future decisions each time permissions are requested [63]. Tsai et al. [60] introduced a context-aware permission manager to help users flexibly control data access, such as only allowing data access when the app is in the foreground. Different contexts can indeed influence users' permission decisions. Our study confirms that background access (or visibility, as discussed in [62, 63]) can affect permission decisions. However, we focus on more general questions: (1) whether users can comprehend the permission groups and their related security risks, and (2) what additional information can be provided to enhance user comprehension. Our work is significant in the context of contextual integrity. First, it is essential to ensure that users make informed permission decisions, especially when considering contextual integrity, where users' future permission decisions can be based on their previous ones [63]. Second, we identified decision factors that can affect permission decisions beyond the contexts defined by Wijesekera et al. [62]. These factors may also be used as features to improve privacy decision prediction models, aligning with user preferences [63].

### Permission Fatigue

Previous studies have found that repetitive warnings can lead to notice fatigue and habituation in software agreement notices [40], Android install-time notices [37, 39], and browser security warnings [56]. Our findings provide insights for addressing this fatigue problem (§6). To improve user attention, systems may allow users to customize decision factors based on their preferences. Additionally, systems can highlight negative messages to draw users' attention. Bravo-Lillo et al. [32, 33] found that forcing users to interact with essential information or adding attractors can effectively increase user attention and address habituation. Similarly, our findings in §5.3 suggest that it is necessary to highlight several important pieces of information (e.g., the provider of permission explanations) to draw users' attention.

### Discussion and Implications

#### 8.1 Explaining Permission Model Changes

In §4, our study revealed the prevalence of low-version Android apps and users' common misunderstanding about these apps. Low-version apps receive all permissions at install-time, even on new systems, while most users mistakenly expect them to request permissions at runtime. This misunderstanding can potentially be exploited to bypass users' consent at runtime, leading to privacy leaks.

During our study, two efforts were made to mitigate this issue. First, Google Play began to disallow the uploading of low-version apps [11]. Second, Android 10 asks users to decide whether to revoke dangerous permissions when the low-version app launches for the first time [22]. However, these efforts may not fully resolve the issue. Many low-version apps uploaded before may still exist on Google Play or third-party app stores, and the adoption of Android 10 may take a long time. Users may still be impacted by low-version apps if their operating systems are not updated to Android 10.

We hope our study raises awareness of this issue and inspires future work. Third-party app stores may consider forbidding low-version apps, as Google Play did. System designers may also consider providing explicit warnings about low-version apps to raise users' attention. More fundamentally, system designers should carefully examine the compatibility mechanism to avoid similar issues that may confuse users.

#### 8.2 Addressing Common Misunderstandings for Permission Groups

Our findings in §5 indicate that users commonly misunderstand the scope of permission groups. We suggest two potential approaches to reduce misunderstandings: (a) OSes can provide more explanations in the permission dialog, or (b) reorganize the permission groups to make them more intuitive (e.g., breaking down the permission groups into smaller ones). However, long explanations or excessive permission requests during runtime can increase users' cognitive load, leading to habituation and ignoring the explanations [29, 37, 39]. Future work could explore how to provide more explanations while balancing their complexity.

Our findings in §5.3 show that many iOS users often confuse app explanations with system-provided information. Additionally, previous work found that many app-specified explanations focus on user benefits and provide inaccurate information on the data being accessed [50, 57]. It is worthwhile to study how to assist app developers in providing better explanations and how to audit such explanations against app behaviors to avoid misleading users.

#### 8.3 Addressing Concerns with Decision Factors

In §6, we studied six factors that can affect users' permission decisions. We observed that negative messages about these factors are considered more helpful and more likely to influence user decisions than positive ones. Following our findings, future work can focus on how to extract information concerning these factors. Here, we discuss some potential approaches. Internal factors (i.e., background access and data transmission) can be collected by OSes. For example, background access can be tracked by logging related system APIs. Data transmission can be monitored by combining static and dynamic data flow analysis [28]. The information can be collected during testing or in real use. Recent updates in Android [2] and iOS [4] allow users to choose whether to grant background access to locations, which notifies users about potential background access.

External factors (i.e., rating, review, grant rate, and brand reputation) can be collected via crowdsourcing or through trusted organizations. Reviews and ratings are available in app stores. OSes can collect them using information retrieval techniques and present them to users. Grant rates can be collected by phone vendors from their users. Existing security and privacy standards like ISO/IEC 27001 or GDPR [3, 5] may reflect the company's reputation in protecting users' privacy. The general challenge concerning external factors is that this information may be manipulated by fraudulent third parties. More efforts are needed to ensure that the obtained information is trustworthy.

Our work mainly focuses on the simple variations of the messages for decision factors, namely positive and negative messages. Future work may study more fine-grained metrics on three decision factors (rating/review/grant rate), e.g., how specific values can impact users' decisions. Our study also shows that users' decisions may change differently for different decision factors (Finding 9), which aligns with previous studies indicating that users have different privacy needs [48, 49]. This implies the necessity for a framework that allows users to personalize and configure the information provided. Future work may further study users' capability and willingness to configure these decision factors.

### Conclusion

Current mobile systems play a neutral role in protecting users' private information—they provide simple descriptions and allow apps to explain their permission request intentions. This can easily lead to unintended privacy leaks due to users' poor understanding of permissions. In this paper, we investigated the problem through the analysis of real users' permission settings and large-scale user studies. We found that users have several common misunderstandings about certain permission groups, and many Android users are unaware of permission model changes. This motivates system designers to enhance systems by providing clearer permission-related information. We further studied what extra information can be provided by the systems to help users make more informed decisions. Our results suggest that information about background access and brand reputation was rated as the most helpful, and negative messages related to these factors can have a stronger impact on users' decisions. Such results can guide system designers to select relevant information that can raise users' attention when making permission decisions.
