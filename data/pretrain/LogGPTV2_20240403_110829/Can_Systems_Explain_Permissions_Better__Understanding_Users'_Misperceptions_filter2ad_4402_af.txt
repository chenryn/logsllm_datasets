al. [62] found that users may make different decisions for
the same permission when it is used in different contexts and
further proposed a machine learning approach that leverages
users’ past permission decisions to predict future decisions
each time when permissions are used [63]. Tsai et al. [60]
proposed a context-aware permission manager to help users
ﬂexibly control data access, e.g. only allow data access when
the app is in the foreground. Different contexts can indeed
affect users’ permission decisions. Our study conﬁrms that
background access (or visibility in [62,63]) can affect permis-
sion decisions. However, we focus on more general questions:
(1) whether users can comprehend the permission groups and
their related security risks, and (2) what additional informa-
tion can be provided to enhance user comprehension. Our
work is signiﬁcant concerning context integrity. First, it is es-
sential to ensure that users make permission decisions when
they can understand the permissions. This is the case espe-
cially when considering context integrity where users’ future
permission decisions can be made based on their previous
ones [63]. Second, we identiﬁed decision factors that can af-
fect permission decisions other than the contexts deﬁned by
Wijesekera et al. [62]. These factors may also be used as fea-
tures to improve privacy decision prediction model to make
permission decisions aligning with user preferences [63].
Permission Fatigue. Previous works found that repetitive
warnings can lead to notice fatigue and habituation in software
agreement notices [40], Android install-time notices [37, 39]
and browser security warnings [56]. Our ﬁndings provide
hints for addressing the fatigue problem (§6). In order to im-
prove user attentions, systems may allow users to customize
decision factors based on their preferences. In addition, sys-
tems can highlight negative messages to draw users’ attention.
Bravo-Lillo et al. found that forcing users interact with essen-
tial information or adding attractors can effectively increase
user attention and address habituation [32, 33]. Similarly, our
ﬁndings in §5.3 suggest that it is necessary to highlight sev-
eral important information (e.g. the provider of permission
explanations) to draw users’ attention.
8 Discussion and Implication
8.1 Explaining permission model changes
In §4, our study disclosed the prevalence of low-version
Android apps as well as users’ common misunderstanding
USENIX Association
30th USENIX Security Symposium    765
on these low-version apps. Low-version apps get all permis-
sions at install-time even on new systems, while most users
mistakenly expect they request permissions at runtime. This
misunderstanding may be potentially taken advantage to by-
pass users’ consent at runtime and cause privacy leakage.
At the same time of our study, two efforts have been made
to mitigate this issue. First, Google Play begins to disallow
uploading low-version apps [11]. Second, Android 10 asks
user to decide to revoke dangerous permissions or not when
the low-version app launches for the ﬁrst time [22]. However,
these efforts may not resolve the issue in total. First, many low-
version apps uploaded before may still exist on Google play
or third-party app stores. Second, the adoption of Android
10 may take a long time. Users may still be impacted by
low-version if their OSes are not updated to Android 10.
We hope our study can raise people’s awareness of this
issue and inspire future works. First, third-party app stores
may also consider forbidding low-version apps as Google
Play did. Second, system designers may consider giving ex-
plicit warnings of low-version apps to raise users’ attention.
Third and more fundamental, system designers may consider
to examine the comparability mechanism carefully to avoid
similar issues which may confuse users.
8.2 Addressing common misunderstandings
for permission groups
Our ﬁndings in §5 indicate that users commonly misun-
derstood the scope of permission groups. We suggest two
potential approaches to reduce misunderstandings: OSes can
(a) provide more explanations in the permission dialog, or (b)
reorganize the permission groups and make them more intu-
itive (e.g., breaking down the permission groups into smaller
ones). However, long explanations or excessive permission
requests during runtime increase users’ recognition burdens,
making them habituate and ignore the explanations [29,37,39].
Future work could therefore explore how best to provide more
explanations while balancing their complexity.
Our ﬁndings in §5.3 show that many iOS users commonly
confuse app explanations with system-provided information.
In addition, previous work found that many app-speciﬁed ex-
planations only focus on user beneﬁts and provide inaccurate
information on what data will be accessed [50,57]. It is worth-
while to study how to assist app developers in providing better
explanations and how to audit such explanations against app
behaviors to avoid misleading users.
8.3 Addressing concerns with decision factors
In §6, we studied six factors that can affect users’ permis-
sion decisions. We observed that negative messages of the fac-
tors are considered more helpful and more likely to affect user
decisions than the positive ones. Following our ﬁndings, fu-
ture work can focus on how to extract information concerning
the factors. Here, we discuss some potential approaches. Inter-
nal factors (i.e., background access and data transmission) can
be collected by OSes. For example, background access can
be tracked by logging related system APIs. Data transmission
can be monitored by combining static and dynamic data ﬂow
analysis [28]. The information can be collected during testing
or in real use. Recent updates in Android [2] and iOS [4]
allow users to choose whether to grant background access to
locations, which notiﬁes users about the potential background
access.
External factors (i.e. rating, review, grant rate and brand rep-
utation) can be collected via crowdsourcing or through trusted
organizations with efforts. Reviews and ratings are available
in app stores. OSes can collect them via information retrieval
techniques and present it to users. Grant rate can be collected
by the phone vendors from their users. Existing security and
privacy standards like ISO/IEC27001 or GDRP [3, 5] may be
used to reﬂect the company’s reputation in protecting users’
privacy. The general challenge concerning external factors
is that information of these factors may be manipulated by
fraudulent third parties. More efforts are needed to ensure
that the obtained information is trusty.
Our work mainly focuses on the simple variations of the
messages for decision factors, namely positive and negative
messages. Future work may study more ﬁne-grained metrics
on three decision factors (rating/review/grant rate), e.g. how
speciﬁc values can impact users’ decisions. Our study also
shows that users’ decisions may change differently for differ-
ent decision factors (Finding 9), which aligns with previous
study that users have different privacy needs [48, 49]. This
implies the necessity for a framework which allows users to
personalize and conﬁgure what information to be provided.
Future work may further study users’ capability and willing-
ness to conﬁgure these decision factors.
9 Conclusion
Current mobile systems play a neutral role in protecting
users’ private information—they just provide simple descrip-
tions and allow apps to explain their permission request in-
tentions. This can easily lead to unintended privacy leakage
because of users’ poor understandings of the permissions. In
this paper, we investigated the problem through analysis of
real users’ permission settings and large-scale user studies.
We ﬁnd that users have several common misunderstandings
on certain permission groups and many Android users are not
aware of permission model changes. This motivates system
designers to enhance systems by providing clearer permission-
related information. We further studied what extra information
can be provided by the systems to help users make more in-
formed decisions. Our results suggest that information about
background access and brand reputation were rated the most
helpful and the negative messages related to the factors can
have a stronger impact on users’ decisions. Such results can
guide system designers to select relevant information that can
raise users’ attention when making permission decisions.
