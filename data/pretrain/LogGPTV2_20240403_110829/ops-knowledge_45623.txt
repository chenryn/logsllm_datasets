User: Please describe the virtual machine live migration technology, and explain its application scenarios and advantages.
Assistant: Virtual machine live migration, also known as virtual machine migration, is a technology for migrating running virtual machines between physical servers. Its rationale is to move virtual machine memory state, computation, and network connections from one physical server to another while keeping the virtual machine running continuously. The virtual machine migration technology adopts network communication and data synchronization technology, such as virtual machine memory, status, and I/O disks are copied and synchronized, thus completing the entire migration process. The application scenarios of virtual machine dynamic migration include: 1. Server load balancing: When the load of a physical server is too high, the virtual machine can be migrated to another physical server through virtual machine migration to achieve server load balancing. 2. Online upgrade of virtual machines: Online upgrade of virtual machines can be realized through virtual machine migration, which saves time and cost, and reduces the complexity of system maintenance. 3. Failover: When a physical server fails, virtual machine migration technology can quickly migrate the virtual machine to other normal physical servers, thus ensuring the continuity and availability of the virtual machine. The advantages of virtual machine live migration are as follows: 1. Resource saving: virtual machine live migration can effectively use cluster resources, avoid waste of physical machine resources, and improve computing efficiency and performance. 2. Improve system availability: virtual machine dynamic migration can realize failover and load balancing, which improves system availability and stability. 3. Reduce maintenance costs: Live migration of virtual machines can achieve better resource utilization and load balancing, reducing system maintenance costs and operational difficulties. In short, virtual machine dynamic migration technology is one of the core technologies in the current cloud computing environment, which can greatly improve system availability and performance, and achieve better utilization and management of resources.
