GOOGLE SEARCH 
OPERATOR 
DESCRIPTION 
“search term” 
Force an exact-match search. Use this to refine 
results for ambiguous searches, or to exclude 
synonyms when searching for single words. 
Example: “steve jobs” 
OR 
Search for X or Y. This will return results 
related to X or Y, or both. Note: The pipe (|) 
operator can also be used in place of “OR.” 
Examples: jobs OR gates / jobs | gates 
AND 
Search for X and Y. This will return only results 
related to both X and Y. Note: It doesn’t really 
make much difference for regular searches, as 
Google defaults to “AND” anyway. But it’s very 
useful when paired with other operators. 
Example: jobs AND gates 
- 
Exclude a term or phrase. In our example, any 
pages returned will be related to jobs but 
not Apple (the company). 
Example: jobs -apple 
* 
Acts as a wildcard and will match any word or 
phrase. 
Example: steve * apple  
236 
( ) 
Group multiple terms or search operators to 
control how the search is executed. 
Example: (ipad OR iphone) apple 
$ 
Search for prices. Also works for Euro (€), but 
not GBP (£)  
Example: ipad $329 
define: 
A dictionary built into Google, basically. This 
will display the meaning of a word in a card-like 
result in the SERPs. 
Example: define:entrepreneur 
cache: 
Returns the most recent cached version of a web 
page (providing the page is indexed, of course). 
Example: cache:apple.com 
filetype: 
Restrict results to those of a certain filetype. 
E.g., PDF, DOCX, TXT, PPT, etc. Note: The “ext:” 
operator can also be used—the results are 
identical. 
Example: apple filetype:pdf / apple ext:pdf 
site: 
Limit results to those from a specific website. 
Example: site:apple.com 
related: 
Find sites related to a given domain. 
Example: related:apple.com 
intitle: 
Find pages with a certain word (or words) in the 
title. In our example, any results containing the 
word “apple” in the title tag will be returned. 
Example: intitle:apple 
allintitle: 
Similar to “intitle,” but only results containing 
all of the specified words in the title tag will 
be returned. 
Example: allintitle:apple iphone 
inurl: 
Find pages with a certain word (or words) in the 
URL. For this example, any results containing the 
word “apple” in the URL will be returned. 
Example: inurl:apple 
allinurl: 
Similar to “inurl,” but only results containing 
all of the specified words in the URL will be 
returned. 
Example: allinurl:apple iphone 
intext: 
Find pages containing a certain word (or words) 
somewhere in the content. For this example, any 
results containing the word “apple” in the page 
content will be returned. 
Example: intext:apple 
allintext: 
Similar to “intext,” but only results containing 
all of the specified words somewhere on the page 
will be returned. 
Example: allintext:apple iphone 
AROUND(X) 
Proximity search. Find pages containing two words 
or phrases within X words of each other. For this 
237 
example, the words “apple” and “iphone” must be 
present in the content and no further than four 
words apart. 
Example: apple AROUND(4) iphone 
weather: 
Find the weather for a specific location. This is 
displayed in a weather snippet, but it also 
returns results from other “weather” websites. 
Example: weather:san francisco 
stocks: 
See stock information (i.e., price, etc.) for a 
specific ticker. 
Example: stocks:aapl 
map: 
Force Google to show map results for a locational 
search. 
Example: map:silicon valley 
movie: 
Find information about a specific movie. Also 
finds movie showtimes if the movie is currently 
showing near you. 
Example: movie:steve jobs 
in 
Convert one unit to another. Works with 
currencies, weights, temperatures, etc. 
Example: $329 in GBP 
source: 
Find news results from a certain source in Google 
News. 
Example: apple source:the_verge 
_ 
Not exactly a search operator, but acts as a 
wildcard for Google Autocomplete. 
Example: apple CEO _ jobs 
#..# 
Search for a range of numbers. In the example 
below, searches related to “WWDC videos” are 
returned for the years 2010–2014, but not for 
2015 and beyond. 
Example: wwdc video 2010..2014 
inanchor: 
Find pages that are being linked to with specific 
anchor text. For this example, any results with 
inbound links containing either “apple” or 
“iphone” in the anchor text will be returned. 
Example: inanchor:apple iphone 
allinanchor: 
Similar to “inanchor,” but only results 
containing all of the specified words in the 
inbound anchor text will be returned. 
Example: allinanchor:apple iphone 
loc:placename Find results from a given area. 
Example: loc:”san francisco” apple 
location: 
Find news from a certain location in Google News. 
Example: loc:”san francisco” apple

OSQUERY 
BLUE TEAM 
THREAT HUNT 
WINDOWS/LINUX/MacOS 
osquery is a tool that exposes an operating system as a high-
performance relational database. It enables developers to write 
SQL-based queries that explore operating system data. 
Query for top 10 largest processes by resident memory size 
select pid, name, uid, resident_size from processes order by 
resident_size desc limit 10; 
Return process count, name for the top 10 most active processes 
select count(pid) as total, name from processes group by name order 
by total desc limit 10; 
Finding new processes listening on network ports 
select distinct process.name, listening.port, listening.address, 
process.pid from processes as process join listening_ports as 
listening on process.pid = listening.pid; 
Finding suspicious outbound network activity 
select s.pid, p.name, local_address, remote_address, family, 
protocol, local_port, remote_port from process_open_sockets s join 
processes p on s.pid = p.pid where remote_port not in (80, 443) and 
family = 2; 
Finding processes that are running whose binary has been deleted 
from the disk 
select name, path, pid from processes where on_disk = 0; 
242 
Finding specific indicators of compromise (IOCs) in memory or on 
disk 
select * from file where path = '/dev/ptmx0'; 
select * from apps where bundle_identifier = 'com.ht.RCSMac' or 
bundle_identifier like 'com.yourcompany.%' or bundle_package_type 
like 'OSAX'; 
select * from launchd where label = 'com.ht.RCSMac' or label like 
'com.yourcompany.%' or name = 'com.apple.loginStoreagent.plist' or 
name = 'com.apple.mdworker.plist' or name = 
'com.apple.UIServerLogin.plist'; 
Finding new kernel modules that have loaded 
#Run query periodically, diffing against older results 
select name from kernel_modules; 
Detect processes masquerading as legitimate Windows process 
SELECT * FROM processes WHERE LOWER(name)='lsass.exe' AND 
LOWER(path)!='c:\\windows\\system32\\lsass.exe' AND path!=''; 
SELECT name FROM processes WHERE pid=(SELECT parent FROM processes 
WHERE LOWER(name)='services.exe') AND LOWER(name)!='wininit.exe'; 
SELECT * FROM processes WHERE LOWER(name)='svchost.exe' AND 
LOWER(path)!='c:\\windows\\system32\\svchost.exe' AND 
LOWER(path)!='c:\\windows\\syswow64\\svchost.exe' AND path!=''; 
SELECT name FROM processes WHERE pid=(SELECT parent FROM processes 
WHERE LOWER(name)='svchost.exe') AND LOWER(name)!='services.exe'; 
Checks the hashes of accessibility tools to ensure they don't match 
the hashes of cmd.exe, powershell.exe, or explorer.exe 
SELECT * FROM hash WHERE (path='c:\\windows\\system32\\osk.exe' OR 
path='c:\\windows\\system32\\sethc.exe' OR 
path='c:\\windows\\system32\\narrator.exe' OR 
path='c:\\windows\\system32\\magnify.exe' OR 
path='c:\\windows\\system32\\displayswitch.exe') AND sha256 IN 
(SELECT sha256 FROM hash WHERE 
path='c:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe' OR 
path='c:\\windows\\system32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.ex
e' OR path='c:\\windows\\system32\\explorer.exe') AND 
sha256!='e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b78
52b855'; 
Timestamp Inconsistency

select path,fn_btime,btime from ntfs_file_data where 
device=”\\.\PhysicalDrive0” and partition=3 and 
directory=”/Users//Desktop/dir” and fn_btime != btime; 
select filename, path from ntfs_file_data where 
device=”\\.\PhysicalDrive0” and partition=2 and 
path=”/Users//Downloads” and fn_btime > ctime OR btime > 
ctime; 
Directory Unused Filename Entries
