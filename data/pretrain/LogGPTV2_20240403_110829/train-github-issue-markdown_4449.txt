HTML elements at in many in examples are using single quote instead of double
but examples in readme and blog of zeit are not. IMO It might make users
confused specially in terms of using lint like standard, which report an error
of double quotes in JSX. I'm not sure which style is your recommendation.
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
Using consistence expression for quote
## Current Behavior
Using mixin styles between examples project and document
