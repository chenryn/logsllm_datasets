User: I always ran my scripts on windows by double-clicking them. However after I reinstalled my python versions this is not happenning. My python installations are on C:\Python27 and C:\Python33. PATH has C:\Python27\ in it. If I try to run a script from cmd, it works ok. But when I double-click any .py file nothing happens. 
I am completely clueless as I don't use windows often for scripting. 
What can be the reason for that?
Assistant: I was having the same issue. The code works in the IDLE but not on double click. I ran the script through the command prompt and it gave me an error that the IDLE didn't find. Windows didn't like the ascii characters I was printing. I removed them and the script started to work on double click again.
