root causes. The sophistication and difﬁculty of attacking
the TLS protocol directly has apparently shifted attention,
over time, to the security of the CA/B infrastructure and its
reliance on human factors. Indeed, in the research literature,
it is becoming more common for threat models to assume
an adversary possesses a valid certiﬁcate for a targeted site.
From our comparative evaluation of proposals for en-
hancing the certiﬁcate infrastructure, several research trends
are apparent. Among these: a variety of pinning techniques
propose adding defence in depth (a) against attacks involving
fraudulent certiﬁcates, and (b) against SSL stripping attacks
(which are deceptively simple); many primitives rely on a
trusted initialization before providing protection; and the
continuing failure of HTTPS support as it exists today to
provide responsive certiﬁcate revocation information.
Replacing the CA infrastructure is often viewed by indi-
viduals in the computer industry as a way forward. This may
not, however, improve things unless the current underlying
weaknesses do not reappear. Though certiﬁcate issuance was
historically independent of DNS, tighter integration of the
certiﬁcate trust model with domain names, and potentially
