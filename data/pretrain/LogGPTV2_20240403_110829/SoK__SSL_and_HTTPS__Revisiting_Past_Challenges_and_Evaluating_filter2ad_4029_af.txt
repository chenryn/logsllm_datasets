### Root Causes and Trends in TLS Security

The complexity and difficulty of directly attacking the TLS protocol have, over time, shifted focus to the security of the Certificate Authority (CA) and Browser (CA/B) infrastructure, particularly its reliance on human factors. In recent research, it is increasingly common for threat models to assume that an adversary possesses a valid certificate for a targeted site.

From our comparative evaluation of proposals aimed at enhancing the certificate infrastructure, several key trends are evident:

1. **Pinning Techniques**: Various pinning methods aim to add defense in depth against attacks involving fraudulent certificates and SSL stripping attacks, which, despite their simplicity, can be highly deceptive.
2. **Trusted Initialization**: Many security primitives depend on a trusted initialization phase before they can provide effective protection.
3. **Certificate Revocation**: The current HTTPS support fails to provide timely and responsive certificate revocation information, a critical weakness in the existing system.

### Replacing the CA Infrastructure

Replacing the CA infrastructure is often seen as a potential solution by industry experts. However, this approach may not improve security unless the underlying weaknesses are addressed. Historically, certificate issuance was independent of DNS, but there has been a growing trend towards tighter integration of the certificate trust model with domain names, exemplified by DANE (DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities). This integration aims to enhance the security and reliability of the certificate validation process.

### Future of Certificate Validation

A pertinent question is: what tangible benefits does the best-possible, commercially viable certificate validation offer beyond simply binding domain names to public keys? The answer to this question may determine the future of CAs.
