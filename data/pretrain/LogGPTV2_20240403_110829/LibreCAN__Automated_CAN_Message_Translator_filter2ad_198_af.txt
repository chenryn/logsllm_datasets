A VEHICULAR SIGNALS
Table 8 depicts an overview of frequently installed ECUs in newer
vehicles. It also includes physical signals that each ECU might
generate.
In the following, we present a full list of physical relationships
between certain elements in set S:
τ ∝∼ rpm.
• Torque (τ) and engine speed (rpm) share a linear relationship
for engine speeds lower than 2000-3000 RPM, as can be
extracted from torque curves [6]. Since the engine speed is
lower than the aforementioned threshold during almost the
entire drive, we can assume that τ and rpm are proportional
to each other:
(6)
• Engine load (loadenдine) can be calculated as the fraction
of actual engine output torque (τ) to the maximum engine
output torque (τenдine,max ):
loadenдine ∝ τ .
(7)
• For engine speed values up to approximately 2000 RPM,
torque (τ) and pressure boost (pboost ) are linearly related [53].
Furthermore, for boosted engines, such as in vehicles with
turbochargers (all of our evaluation vehicles except Vehicle
C), the intake manifold pressure (pmap) is proportional to
pboost :
(8)
• The electrical circuitry in the Accelerator Pedal Position
(APP) and Throttle Position (TPS) sensors is identical [31].
Both sensors are fixed to the throttle body and convert the
position of the throttle pedal to a voltage reading. As a result,
accelerator pedal position (ACC_PED) and throttle position
(T HR_POS) are highly related:
τ ∝∼ pboost ∝∼ pmap .
ACC_PED ∝∼ T HR_POS.
(9)
• The centripetal acceleration (ay) is proportional to the prod-
uct of yaw rate and vehicle speed:
ay ∝ ωzv.
(10)
• The barometric pressure reading (p) obtained from phone
sensors does not only change with the weather, but is also a
function of the altitude (h) [2]. Via the barometric formula:
(11)
In this equation, k is a constant and M the molar mass of dry
air. Despite having an exponential curve, for small altitude
−k·h·M .
p ∝∼ e

changes, the relationship between p and h is approximately
constant. Furthermore, considering the fact that weather
does not change significantly during data collection, changes
in p can be directly linked to h.
