**Physical Relationships Between Certain Elements in Set S:**

- **Torque (τ) and Engine Speed (rpm):** 
  - For engine speeds lower than 2000-3000 RPM, torque and engine speed share a linear relationship [6]. Since the engine speed is below this threshold during most of the drive, we can assume that τ and rpm are proportional:
    \[ \tau \propto \text{rpm} \]

- **Engine Load (load<sub>engine</sub>):**
  - Engine load can be calculated as the fraction of actual engine output torque (τ) to the maximum engine output torque (τ<sub>engine,max</sub>):
    \[ \text{load}_{\text{engine}} \propto \tau \]

- **Torque (τ) and Pressure Boost (p<sub>boost</sub>):**
  - For engine speeds up to approximately 2000 RPM, torque and pressure boost are linearly related [53]. For boosted engines, such as those with turbochargers (all evaluation vehicles except Vehicle C), the intake manifold pressure (p<sub>map</sub>) is proportional to p<sub>boost</sub>:
    \[ \tau \propto p_{\text{boost}} \propto p_{\text{map}} \]

- **Accelerator Pedal Position (APP) and Throttle Position (TPS):**
  - The electrical circuitry in the APP and TPS sensors is identical [31]. Both sensors are fixed to the throttle body and convert the position of the throttle pedal to a voltage reading. Thus, accelerator pedal position (ACC_PED) and throttle position (THR_POS) are highly related:
    \[ \text{ACC_PED} \propto \text{THR_POS} \]

- **Centripetal Acceleration (a<sub>y</sub>):**
  - Centripetal acceleration is proportional to the product of yaw rate (ω<sub>z</sub>) and vehicle speed (v):
    \[ a_y \propto \omega_z v \]

- **Barometric Pressure (p) and Altitude (h):**
  - The barometric pressure reading from phone sensors changes with both weather and altitude [2]. Using the barometric formula:
    \[ p \propto e^{-k \cdot h \cdot M} \]
  - Despite the exponential curve, for small altitude changes, the relationship between p and h is approximately constant. Given that weather does not change significantly during data collection, changes in p can be directly linked to h.

- **Figure 12:** Vehicle A
- **Figure 13:** Vehicle B

Each figure shows the number of unique CAN IDs remaining after each filtering stage for the 53 events:

- **Raw Event Trace**
- **Stage 1: Constant Message Filtering**
- **Stage 2: Reference State Filtering**
- **Stage 3: Powertrain Filtering**

These figures provide a visual representation of how many CAN IDs are filtered out at each stage, helping to identify the relevant signals for each event.
