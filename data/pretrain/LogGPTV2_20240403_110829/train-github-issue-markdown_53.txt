Again from the paypal/bootstrap-accessibility-plugin, these changes should be
added to the documentation and the JS plugin.
### Tab Panel
  1. ~~Add ARIA roles like tablist, presentation, and tab for tabs UL, LI.~~
  2. Add tabIndex, ~~aria-expanded~~ , aria-selected, ~~aria-controls~~ for tab.
  3. Add ARIA roles of ~~tabpanel~~ , tabIndex, aria-hidden, and aria-labelledBy for tabPanel.
  4. Add keydown event listener for the tab to work with keyboard.
  5. Dynamically flip tabIndex, aria-selected, and ~~aria-expanded~~ for tab when it is activated and add aria-hidden to hide the previously visible tab.
