User: How to find application vulnerabilities and security risks through code audit? Please introduce some commonly used code auditing tools.
Assistant: Code audit refers to the analysis of the source code of the application to find the loopholes and security risks. The following are some commonly used code audit tools: 1. Static code analysis tool: It can analyze the source code of the application to find out some common vulnerabilities and defects, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting attack, file inclusion vulnerability, etc. Commonly used static code analysis tools include PMD, FindBugs, Checkstyle, etc. 2. Web application scanner: It can simulate the attack behavior and scan the application program to find out the loopholes and security risks in it. Commonly used web application scanners include Acunetix, Nessus, Nikto, etc. 3. Fuzzing tools: A large number of random tests can be performed on the application to find possible security holes in it. Commonly used fuzz testing tools include AFL, Peach Fuzzer, Spike Fuzzer, etc. 4. Decompilation tool: You can decompile the application to view the source code and internal structure, and find out possible loopholes and security risks. Commonly used decompilation tools include IDA Pro, OllyDbg, Hopper, etc. 5. Log analysis tool: It can analyze the operation log of the application program to find out the abnormalities and attack behaviors that may exist in it, and find out the hidden dangers in it. Common log analysis tools include Rizhiyi, Logstash, Graylog, etc. The above are the commonly used code audit tools, which can help analyze the source code of the application in different aspects, and find out possible loopholes and security risks. However, these tools cannot fully replace human audits, which are still one of the most effective methods.
