### Actual Result
Hello,  
There are two network cards in my machine, IP are 10.x.x.x and 172.x.x.x,
zookeeper IP is 172.x.x.x, after services start up, providers path in
zookeeper, service ip is 10.x.x.x. and because of all my business servers IP
are 172.x.x.x, this service who exported with IP 10.x.x.x could not be invoked
by other services.
I read the source code of Dubbo, it chooses IP from IP list only if one is a
valid IP address.

IP_PATTERN in this picture, just a regular expression which matches a valid IP
address.
Can we choose the IP first in the same IP segment with zookeeper address
instead of a random one? That's guaranteed that servers are reachable to each
other at default configure.
