### The Audit Trail Problem: The Athens Affair
- **Incident Overview**:
  - **Date**: 2004/2005
  - **Description**: Malware was installed on Ericsson cellular telephone switches, using rootkit-like techniques to hide from switch operators.
  - **Discovery**: Ericsson staff discovered the malware while auditing a core dump to isolate a bug.
  - **Impact**: Cellphones of at least 100 Greek government officials, including the Prime Minister, were monitored.
  - **Technique**: The malware exploited Lawful Intercept code in the phone switch. The interface for managing intercepts was separate from the software that performed the intercepts, and logs were kept in the management interface.

- **Security Implication**:
  - **Audit Trail Separation**: The separation of audit trails from the core functionality is a fundamental architectural flaw in many Lawful Intercept technologies, making it difficult to investigate allegations of misuse.

- **Technology Allowing Log Disabling**:
  - Potential technologies that might allow users to turn off logs include UNIX shells, DHCP servers, SMTP servers, HTTP servers, and RADIUS servers.

### European Data Retention Policies
- **Directive on Mandatory Retention of Communications Traffic Data**:
  - **Enacted**: March 2006
  - **Requirements**:
    - Service providers must retain data for 6 months to 2 years.
    - Data to be retained includes:
      - Source and destination of communication.
      - Date, time, and duration of communication.
      - Type of communication.
      - Communication device.
      - Location of mobile communication equipment.

- **Concerns**:
  - Network use is recorded and subject to investigation, but surveillance of the network is not recorded and cannot be audited.

### TAP-MIB: Flexibility of the Output Stream
```asn.1
cTapMediationTransport OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX     INTEGER {
        udp(1),
        rtpNack(2),
        tcp(3),
        sctp(4)
    }
    MAX-ACCESS read-create
    STATUS     current
    DESCRIPTION
        "The protocol used in transferring intercepted data to the
         Mediation Device. The following protocols may be supported:
         udp:     PacketCable udp format
         rtpNack: RTP with Nack resilience
         tcp:     TCP with head of line blocking
         sctp:    SCTP with head of line blocking"
    ::= { cTapMediationEntry 11 }
```

### Packet Spoofing and Access Lists
- **Full Out-of-Band Management Designs**:
  - **Advantages**: Limits access to SNMP.
  - **Disadvantages**: Expensive and SNMP connectivity is an indicator of network health.

- **SNMPv3 Infrastructure Access Control Lists**:
  - **Usage**: Many service providers use these lists.
  - **Vulnerability**: Interception requests can be spoofed, and obtaining or guessing SNMPv3 Engine values is theoretically possible.

- **Service LAN Security**:
  - **Myth**: ISP service LANs are impenetrable.
  - **Reality**: There are legitimate access points that can be misused, and the lack of audit trails invites insider misuse.

### Additional Access Control
- **SNMPv3 User-Group Access Control Lists**:
  - **Functionality**: Locks access to Lawful Intercept down to the IP address of the Mediation Device.
  - **Benefits**: Generates an audit trail and is useful when coupled with encryption.
  - **Drawbacks**: Still susceptible to spoofing.

### Encryption
- **Recommendations**:
  - **SNMPv3 Encryption**: Protects against CVE-2008-0960.
  - **IPSec ESP**: Mentioned in the Internet Draft for TAP-MIB, the only way to encrypt the output stream, effective if coupled with a User-Group access control list.

### Practicality of Attacks
- **Current Practices**:
  - Most service providers use SNMPv3 Infrastructure IP Access Control Lists.
  - Some were vulnerable to CVE-2008-0960.
  - Few use SNMPv3 User-Group IP Access Control Lists.

- **Implications**:
  - SNMPv3 Engine values are impractical to obtain from unauthorized sources.
  - Attacks from authorized addresses are practical in many real-world deployments.
  - The problem is exacerbated by CVE-2008-0960.

### Addressing Security Issues
- **Design, Implementation, and Deployment**:
  - **Recommendations**:
    - Patch CVE-2008-0960.
    - Use IP Sec for encryption.
    - Use a User-Group IP Access Control List.
    - Review overall protection of network infrastructure, mediation devices, and network management systems.
    - Consider out-of-band management networks.

### Recommendations for SNMPv3
- **User-based Security Model**:
  - Make authentication errors less helpful to attackers.
  - Send traps or informs on authentication failures.
  - Make Engine Values more difficult to predict and share.

### Recommendations for Lawful Intercept
- **Use Different Ports**: Easier to filter.
- **Limit Addresses for Output Stream**: Router administrators should have control.
- **Move Notification Control**: Prevent abuse by either party.
- **Multiple Destinations**: Configure for notifications about taps of varying sensitivity.

### Future Trends
- **Illegal Wiretapping**:
  - **Past**: Easy with accessible Telco junction boxes and frequency scanners.
  - **Present**: More challenging due to link layer encryption and expensive protocol analyzers.
  - **Future**: Software-defined radios might make it cheaper again.

- **End-to-End Encryption**:
  - People prefer seamless point-to-point encryption over end-to-end solutions.
  - Improving link layer encryption will reduce illegal wiretapping.

### Building Lawful Wiretapping Infrastructure
- **Academic Consensus**:
  - Risks of permanent wiretapping infrastructure are too great.
- **Law Enforcement View**:
  - Favor wiretapping suspects.
- **Infrastructure Types**:
  - **Temporary Devices**: Installed without audit trails.
  - **Permanent Infrastructure**:
    - **ETSI Style**: Minimization by service providers.
    - **Klein Declaration Style**: Minimization by law enforcement/intelligence.

### The Klein Declaration
- **Description**:
  - Filed in 2006 by Mark Klein in an EFF lawsuit.
  - Describes a telecommunications monitoring system operated by the NSA.
  - Uses fiber-optic splitters to send backbone link content to a monitoring room.

- **Comparison with Cisco Architecture**:
  - **Cisco Architecture**:
    - Collects specific traffic flows requested by LEA.
    - Allows collection of information authorized by a warrant.
    - Not a secret and open to public review.
    - May better protect personal privacy.

### Conclusion
- **Key Differences**:
  - Presence of human checks and balances.
  - Value of service provider access control in ETSI style infrastructure.
- **Peer Review**:
  - Important for ensuring security and legal appropriateness.
  - Cisco's publication of their architecture is a positive step.
- **Preventing Illegal Wiretapping**:
  - Encrypt insecure link layers.
  - Peer review lawful intercept systems.
  - Insist on secure, auditable, and peer-reviewed systems.
  - Support organizations challenging the status quo.

- **Final Note**:
  - Challenging questions are necessary to improve the situation.
