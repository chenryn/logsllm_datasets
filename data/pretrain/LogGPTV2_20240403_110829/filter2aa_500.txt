vulnerabilities 
No cables
Why isn’t it 
working?
Scared Poopless – LTE

DEMO
What did I just see?
This is not a                problem
Remember kids!
This is why you should do 
secure firmware updates

Got root shell!

• We have root shell on a linux run, independent device 
inside the physical platform.

Updater patch
• Updater checks CRC
• Updater calculates the correct CRC and compares to 
the one in the firmware image
• Modify updater code to save correct CRC in image 
instead of comparing it
• Total op code change = 6
(not including NOP padding)
How do I laptop?
Summary
• We had a cool demo!
• There is such a thing as an insider threat, literally.
• Secure your firmware updates.
