Currently (at least on 0.3.11, have checked master docs but not
implementation), abs does not behave in a mathematically correct manner:
abs(typemin(Int)) == typemin(Int) on my Linux x86-64 machine.
This problem plagues the C standard library abs(), llabs(), etc as well due to
subtle asymmetry in 2's complement arithmetic. The C standard leaves behavior
on INT_MIN, etc undefined, and this is fortunately documented, though easily
missed by many programs.
I thus see 2 possible approaches:
  1. Follow the C standard behavior, give no guarantee for abs(typemin), and document it.
  2. Do something special with typemin, and document it.
