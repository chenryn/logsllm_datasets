## Introduction
In November 2015, at BlackHat EU, Ravishankar Borgaonkar and Altaf Shaik introduced the concept of an LTE IMSI catcher and a DoS attack. This presentation will explore these concepts and their implications.

### IMSI Catcher
An IMSI catcher is a device that impersonates a legitimate cellular network to capture the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) of cellphones within its coverage area. When a cellphone enters the fake network's coverage, it reports its IMSI to the fake network.

### DoS Attack
A Denial of Service (DoS) attack can be executed by sending specific messages to the cellphone, such as:
- "You are an illegal cellphone!"
- "There is no network available. Please shut down your 4G/3G/2G modem."

### Redirection Attack
A redirection attack involves maliciously redirecting a cellphone from a legitimate LTE network to a fake GSM network. The fake LTE network might send a message like: "Hello cellphone, come into my GSM network…"

## Demo
- **Fake LTE Network**
- **Fake GSM Network**
- **USRP (Universal Software Radio Peripheral)**
- **Demo Video**

## Risks
- **If forced into a fake network:**
  - The cellphone will have no service (DoS).
  - The fake GSM network can make malicious calls and send SMS.
- **If forced into a rogue network:**
  - All traffic (voice and data) can be eavesdropped.
- **Femtocell controlled by an attacker:**
  - A femtocell can be used to create a controlled environment for attacks.

## Unauthorized Area: Attack Space
This section details how attackers can exploit the LTE procedure to perform various attacks.

### Procedure of IMSI Catcher
- Send a TAU (Tracking Area Update) reject, prompting the cellphone to send an Attach Request with its IMSI.

### Procedure of DoS Attack
- Use an Attach Reject message with a specific cause to deny service to the cellphone.

### Procedure of Redirection Attack
- Use an RRC Release message to provide cell information, directing the cellphone to a fake network.

## Building a Fake LTE Network
- **Hardware:**
  - Computer + USRP
- **Software:**
  - **Open Air Interface by Eurecom**
    - [Website](http://www.openairinterface.org/)
    - Most complete and open-source LTE software
    - Supports connecting cellphones to the Internet
    - Complex software architecture
  - **OpenLTE by Ben Wojtowicz**
    - [Website](http://openlte.sourceforge.net/)
    - Not yet stable for LTE data connections but functional for fake LTE networks
    - Simplified code architecture
    - Popular among security researchers

### OpenLTE Source Code
- **TAU Handling:**
  - In the current OpenLTE release, TAU requests are not handled, but the TAU reject message packing function is available.
  - Add code to handle TAU cases and provide appropriate TAU reject causes.
- **DoS Attack:**
  - Utilize the cause setting in the Attach Reject message to perform a DoS attack.
- **Redirection Attack:**
  - Insert `redirectCarrierInfo` into the RRC Connection Release message to redirect the cellphone.

## Security Considerations
### Why is RRC Redirection Message Not Encrypted?
- **Historical Context:**
  - "Security Vulnerabilities in the E-RRC Control Plane," 3GPP TSG-RAN WG2/RAN WG3/SA WG3 joint meeting, R3-060032, 9-13 January 2006
  - Documented a 'Forced handover' attack where an attacker can initiate a reconfiguration procedure, directing UEs to a chosen network.
- **3GPP’s Decision:**
  - "Reply LS on assumptions for security procedures," 3GPP TSG SA WG3 meeting #45, S3-060833, 31st Oct - 3rd Nov 2006
  - RRC integrity and ciphering are started only once during the attach procedure and cannot be deactivated later.
  - RRC integrity and ciphering algorithms can only be changed during an eNodeB handover.

### Why 3GPP Made Such Decisions
- **Special Cases:**
  - In scenarios like earthquakes or hot events, too many people may try to access one base station, causing overload.
  - To balance the network load, the base station can redirect new cellphones to another, less loaded base station.
  - If cellphones do not receive this information, they will inefficiently search for other base stations, increasing the overall network load.

## Network Availability vs. Privacy
- **Basic Requirements:**
  - Global roaming
  - Battery energy saving
  - Load balancing
- **High-Level Requirements:**
  - IMSI Catcher
  - DoS Attack
  - Redirection Attack
- **Examples:**
  - Wi-Fi MAC address tracking

## Countermeasures
### Cellphone Manufacturer Responses
- **Scheme 1:**
  - Do not follow the redirection command; instead, auto-search for other available base stations.
- **Scheme 2:**
  - Follow the redirection command but alert the user: "Warning! You are being downgraded to a low-security network."

### Standardization Efforts
- **Fixing Legacy Network Security:**
  - 3GPP TSG SA WG3 (Security) Meeting #83, S3-160702, 9-13 May 2016
  - Address legacy security issues and propose mitigation strategies.
  - Refuse one-way authentication.
  - Disable compromised encryption in mobile devices.
