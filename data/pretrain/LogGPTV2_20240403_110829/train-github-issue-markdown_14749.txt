Running numpy.dot normally produces the expected answer:
    $  python -c "import numpy ; f=numpy.ones(2,dtype=numpy.float32);print f.dot(f)"
    2.0
If I import a PyQt5 module first, I get a different answer:
    $  python -c "import PyQt5.QtWidgets ; import numpy ; f=numpy.ones(2,dtype=numpy.float32);print f.dot(f)"
    0.0
Other folks appear to have found the issue here, with an implied implication
of the Accelerate library being loaded first. I could not discover the
resolution they used, and I would prefer one that did not require fixing
python import order.
