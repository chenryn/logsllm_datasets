processing, about candidate hijacks to help conﬁrm them
or not. We (in)validate candidate hijacks using, besides the
collected routing data, daily archives of the following external
data sources:
•
•
•
•
Routing Information Base (RIB) dumps from RIPE
RIS [8] and Routeviews [14] consist of snapshots of
routers routing table providing the list of announced
IP address blocks and associated BGP AS paths.
Internet Routing Registry (IRR) dumps [5] pro-
vide registration information on IP address and AS
number holders as well as possible routing policies
established between interconnected networks (i.e., via
BGP import and export rules).
Spamhaus Don’t Route Or Peer (DROP) [10] is a
blacklist of IP address blocks allegedly controlled by
cybercriminals, including some claimed to have been
stolen from their legitimate owner.
Network operational mailing lists, such as [7], [9],
are sometimes used by network operators to report
BGP hijack incidents (e.g.,
the Link Telecom hi-
jack [16]).
We examine the routing history related to candidate hijacked IP
address ranges to study their routing characteristics including
(i) when they were publicly announced, (ii) the BGP origin
ASes used to advertise them, and (iii) the upstream provider
ASes seen in the AS paths. Because our data collection system
only collects routing information about IP address ranges for a
limited period of time, we built the routing history of candidate
hijacked IP address ranges from the archived dumps of routing
information bases (RIBs).
We leverage IRR dumps to identify the country of reg-
istration and, the name and the contact details of the owner
of IP address blocks and AS numbers involved in candidate
4
hijacks. We use this information to assess the legitimacy of
routing announcements and proﬁle IP address block and AS
number holders, e.g., to determine whether the owner of an
IP address block is also the owner of the originating AS or to
determine whether the owner of an announced IP address block
is still in business. As suggested in [41], we further assess the
consistency of inter-AS links observed in BGP AS paths using
the published routing policies when available. We consider an
inter-AS link consistent if both AS refer to each other in their
declared import/export rules.
We use feedback from the Spamhaus DROP list that is
a subset of SBL consisting of "IP address blocks that are
hijacked or leased by professional spam or cybercriminal
operations" [10].
Finally, in order to facilitate the communication among
network operators in the Internet, the operational community
uses public mailing lists, such as the North American Network
Operators’ Group (NANOG) mailing list [7] or the RIPE
Working Groups mailing lists [9]. We check our candidate
hijack cases against reported routing incidents in the archives
of these two mailing lists.
At the end of this stage, we should be left with a set of
hijack cases that should allow us to conﬁrm or not2 that BGP
hijacks as described in [35] are still ongoing and, if yes, what
their characteristics are.
D. Root cause analysis
While the external cross-validation of candidate hijacks
described here above should increase our conﬁdence in the
existence of BGP spectrum agility spammers in the real world,
