### Validation of Candidate BGP Hijacks

To validate or invalidate candidate BGP hijacks, we utilize a combination of collected routing data and daily archives from several external data sources. These sources include:

- **Routing Information Base (RIB) Dumps:**
  - RIPE RIS [8] and Routeviews [14] provide snapshots of router routing tables, which list announced IP address blocks and their associated BGP AS paths.
  
- **Internet Routing Registry (IRR) Dumps [5]:**
  - IRR dumps offer registration information on IP address and AS number holders, as well as possible routing policies established between interconnected networks through BGP import and export rules.

- **Spamhaus Don’t Route Or Peer (DROP) List [10]:**
  - This is a blacklist of IP address blocks allegedly controlled by cybercriminals, including some that are claimed to have been stolen from their legitimate owners.

- **Network Operational Mailing Lists:**
  - Mailing lists such as NANOG [7] and RIPE Working Groups [9] are used by network operators to report BGP hijack incidents, for example, the Link Telecom hijack [16].

### Analysis of Routing History

We examine the routing history of candidate hijacked IP address ranges to study their routing characteristics, including:
- The date and time when they were publicly announced.
- The BGP origin ASes used to advertise them.
- The upstream provider ASes seen in the AS paths.

Since our data collection system only captures routing information for a limited period, we reconstruct the routing history of candidate hijacked IP address ranges using archived RIB dumps.

### Leveraging IRR Data

We use IRR dumps to identify the country of registration, the name, and the contact details of the owners of IP address blocks and AS numbers involved in candidate hijacks. This information helps us assess the legitimacy of routing announcements and profile the holders of IP address blocks and AS numbers. For instance, we determine whether the owner of an IP address block is also the owner of the originating AS, or whether the owner of an announced IPIP address block is still in business. As suggested in [41], we further evaluate the consistency of inter-AS links observed in BGP AS paths using published routing policies when available. An inter-AS link is considered consistent if both ASes refer to each other in their declared import/export rules.

### Utilizing Spamhaus DROP List

We also use feedback from the Spamhaus DROP list, which is a subset of the SBL (Spamhaus Block List) and includes "IP address blocks that are hijacked or leased by professional spam or cybercriminal operations" [10].

### Mailing List Archives

To facilitate communication among network operators, we check our candidate hijack cases against reported routing incidents in the archives of public mailing lists, such as the North American Network Operators’ Group (NANOG) [7] and the RIPE Working Groups [9].

### Conclusion of the Validation Stage

At the end of this validation stage, we should have a set of confirmed hijack cases that allow us to determine whether BGP hijacks, as described in [35], are still ongoing and, if so, what their characteristics are.

### Root Cause Analysis

While the external cross-validation of candidate hijacks increases our confidence in the existence of BGP spectrum agility spammers in the real world, it is essential to conduct a root cause analysis to understand the underlying issues and develop effective mitigation strategies.
