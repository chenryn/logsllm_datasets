    go version go1.3 darwin/amd64
    What steps reproduce the problem?
    Example: http://play.golang.org/p/-GqZSloAM3
        1. fmt.Println(math.Sin(1.5e17))
    What happened?
        Program prints "1.231298118089368e+08"
    What should have happened instead?
        Program should print value in [-1,1] range
    Please provide any additional information below.
        Source code for math.Sin warns that "Results may be meaningless for x > 2**49 = 5.6e14". However, it says nothing about not respecting the [-1,1] range. 
        I discovered this when doing math.Sin(float64(time.Now().UnixNano())) returned 1.1828933275348654e+20
        Also, that information does not appear in godoc.
