## Abstract
We present MalONT2.0, an ontology designed for malware threat intelligence. This updated version includes new classes (e.g., attack patterns, infrastructural resources, static and dynamic analysis of binaries) and relations, expanding the scope to address a broader set of competency questions. MalONT2.0 facilitates the comprehensive capture of semantic and syntactic characteristics of Android malware attacks. This ontology serves as the foundation for the malware threat intelligence knowledge graph, MalKG, which we demonstrate through three distinct, non-overlapping examples. The features of the malware are extracted from openCTI reports on Android threat intelligence, sourced from blogs, threat intelligence reports, tweets, and news articles. These features are represented as RDF triples, consisting of head and tail entities connected by a relation. In our poster and demonstration, we will discuss MalONT2.0 and MalKG.

## Introduction
Malware attack intelligence provides detailed information about the working of attacks, including their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and the technology vulnerabilities they exploit. This intelligence is crucial for security researchers to develop better defenses against advanced cyber attacks and issue early warnings about future threats. Open cyber threat intelligence (openCTI) sources, such as blogs, threat intelligence reports, tweets, and news articles, offer a wealth of information. However, effectively utilizing this information requires rigorous techniques that can adapt to the complexities of malware attacks. Threat intelligence is most useful when it is timely, actionable, shared in a universally acceptable format, and contextual.

Vulnerability tracking programs like CVE and NVD provide semi-structured information through centralized platforms. Industry standards like STIX and TAXII offer language-agnostic frameworks for storing, sending, and receiving threat information. Despite these efforts, there is still a lack of context and transparency in sharing CTI. Analysts need more than just data; they require trustworthy sources, relevant threat indicators, and the motivations behind attacks. They also need context to understand the full picture of threats, victims, and the tactics used by attackers.

Malware threat ontologies, such as MalONT2.0, help by representing contextual openCTI feeds in a structured format. Our main contributions are:
1. **MalONT2.0**: An ontology that captures malware threat intelligence through classes and relations, combining semantic and factual data.
2. **Annotated openCTI Reports**: We annotated 25 openCTI reports on Android malware, where each annotation is instantiated into classes and relations defined in MalONT2.0. The instances are stored as RDF triples.
3. **MalKG**: A knowledge graph generated from openCTI reports, demonstrated through three queries.

## What's New in MalONT2.0
MalONT2.0 significantly improves upon its predecessor by comprehensively capturing semantic, syntactic, and factual descriptions of malware threats. The previous version focused on contextual information with partial factual data. The new version addresses the following competency questions:
- **a. Missing Intelligence**: Identify all missing intelligence from the KG related to various attack vectors, such as malware, actors, infrastructure, and TTPs.
- **b. Syntactic Intelligence**: Aggregate triples from diverse openCTI reports with syntactic intelligence from sources like VirusTotal to enrich the description of attack vectors.
- **c. Predictive Models**: Group similar properties and attack vectors to reveal latent behaviors and use them in predictive models for short- and long-term forecasting.

## Example Knowledge Graph
Figure 1 shows the main classes and relations in MalONT2.0. For example, an openCTI report on the Pegasus malware (also known as Chrysaor) logs user keystrokes and leaks app data. The report includes the hash for a single sample, first seen in April 2017 according to VirusTotal.

## System Architecture
Our framework gathers unstructured openCTI reports from the Internet using the Twitter API. It extracts threat intelligence information as RDF triples, assigns them classes and relations from MalONT2.0, and appends them to the existing MalKG. The main components are:
1. **CTI Reports Corpus**: We annotated 25 openCTI reports from 2011 to 2021, resulting in approximately 3,400 tags, 1,100 entities, and 2,300 relations.
2. **MalONT2.0**: Semantic text patterns map to classes and object properties defined by MalONT2.0, capturing malware behavior, vulnerabilities, and indicators.
3. **Knowledge Graph Generation**: We construct a knowledge graph by populating it with triple instances derived from openCTI reports. The graph uses a reasoner to draw associations among entities.
4. **Knowledge Graph Querying**: We run queries on the knowledge graph to extract and visualize sub-graphs, using Python and the academic Twitter API to extract unique occurrences of Android malware openCTI reports.

## Outline of Poster and Demonstration
Our demonstration will cover:
1. **MalONT2.0 Annotations**: Show the ontology in Protégé, configure BRAT using the OWL file, and demonstrate semantic features.
2. **MalKG Demonstration**: Generate and display the knowledge graph using annotated triples and all collected openCTI reports.
3. **Queries on MalKG**: Run live queries on the MalKG through the Neo4j platform, visualizing sub-graphs for entities like malware, applications, and vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion and Future Work
We present MalONT2.0, an ontology for capturing contextual threat intelligence from heterogeneous sources. OpenCTI reports provide semantic information, while VirusTotal offers additional syntactic information. Future work includes validating the triples generated for MalKG at scale and demonstrating the use of a dynamically growing MalKG for forecasting threat vectors.
