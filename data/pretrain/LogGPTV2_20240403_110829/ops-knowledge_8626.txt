User: I have a website which uses Amazon EC2 with Django and Google App Engine for its powerful Image API and image serving infrastructure. When a user uploads an image the browser makes an AJAX request to my EC2 server for the Blobstore upload url. I'm fetching this through my Django server so I can check whether the user is authenticated or not and then the server needs to get the url from the App Engine server. After the upload is complete and processed in App Engine I need to send the upload info back to the django server so I can build the required model instances. How can I accomplish this? I was thinking to use urllib but how can I secure this to make sure the urls will only get accessed by my servers only and not by a web user? Maybe some sort of secret key?
Assistant: apart from the Https call ( which you should be making to transfer info to django ), you can go with AES encryption ( use Pycrypto/ any other lib). It takes a secret key to encrypt your message.
