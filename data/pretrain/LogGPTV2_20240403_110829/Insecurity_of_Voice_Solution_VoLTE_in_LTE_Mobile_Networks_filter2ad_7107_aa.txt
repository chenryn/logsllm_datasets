## Abstract
VoLTE (Voice-over-LTE) is the designated voice solution for LTE mobile networks, currently being deployed worldwide. It transforms call services from traditional circuit-switched (CS) telephony to packet-switched (PS) Internet VoIP. This paper presents the first comprehensive study on VoLTE security before its full rollout. We identify several vulnerabilities in both the control-plane and data-plane functions, which can be exploited to disrupt both data and voice services in operational networks. Specifically, an adversary can gain free data access, shut down ongoing data access, or interrupt an ongoing call. We validate these proof-of-concept attacks using both rooted and unrooted commodity smartphones in two Tier-1 US mobile carriers. Our analysis reveals that the issues stem from both device and network infrastructure. The device OS and chipset fail to prevent non-VoLTE apps from accessing and injecting packets into VoLTE control and data planes. Additionally, the network lacks proper access control and runtime checks.

## 1. Introduction
Voice service is a fundamental utility for both mobile operators and users, serving as a key application in mobile networks for decades. As the infrastructure upgrades to Long Term Evolution (LTE), the fourth-generation (4G) mobile technology, voice services are also evolving. VoLTE (Voice over LTE) is the designated solution for 4G networks, transitioning from circuit-switched (CS) to packet-switched (PS) communication.

In essence, VoLTE is a Voice-over-IP (VoIP) scheme for the all-IP based LTE network. It carries voice messages in IP packets on the data plane, no longer through dedicated circuits. Each VoLTE call maintains a separate signaling session on the control plane, similar to VoIP over the Internet. VoLTE leverages high-priority, quality-of-service (QoS) features offered by the LTE network to ensure carrier-grade quality.

VoLTE offers several advantages over legacy 2G/3G call services, including improved call quality, additional features like video calling and voicemail, and better interoperability across different networks. However, the shift from CS to PS raises concerns about potential new security threats. In this work, we investigate whether VoLTE introduces new and unexpected vulnerabilities. Our study is motivated by the principle that major changes often introduce security risks. The transition from CS to PS may interfere with other system components, creating new security loopholes. 

Our findings confirm these suspicions. VoLTE can be exploited to disrupt both data and voice services. For instance, the VoLTE control session can be abused to carry PS data packets, leading to free data access and higher-priority, undeserved data access. Furthermore, VoLTE is vulnerable to new voice DoS attacks, where an unprivileged malware can mute an ongoing call by exploiting side-channel information. Table 1 summarizes our main findings, which are validated in two top-tier US carriers. We also propose remedies to secure VoLTE on both the control and data planes, as well as on the device and network sides.

The identified root causes are multifaceted, involving mobile technology standards, device OS and hardware, and network operations. Mobile standards lack strict regulations for control and data planes, allowing non-VoLTE packets to be transmitted. Device software and hardware do not adequately prevent unintended access to VoLTE, and network operations fail to enforce proper defenses.

In summary, this paper makes three contributions:
1. Identifying seven vulnerabilities spanning the control plane, data plane, and their coordination.
2. Devising proof-of-concept attacks to exploit these vulnerabilities and assessing their impact in operational networks.
3. Recommending solutions and sharing lessons learned, which can benefit the mobile Internet industry during the early stages of global VoLTE deployment.

## 2. New Security Issues When VoLTE Turns Voice into "Data"
In this section, we review VoLTE, identify its potential vulnerabilities, and describe the attack model and assessment methodology.

### 2.1 VoLTE Primer
VoLTE is the primary voice solution for LTE users, migrating from the legacy circuit-switched (CS) voice service to a packet-switched (PS) design. Figure 1 illustrates the simplified architecture supporting VoLTE, which includes the PS delivery subsystem and the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS).

Each VoLTE call involves two sessions: a control-plane session for call signaling via SIP and a data-plane session for voice packet delivery via RTP. The 4G gateway routes packets on both control and data planes between the device and the IMS core, leveraging multiple service classes to ensure high-quality calls.

### 2.2 Potential Vulnerabilities
The paradigm shift from CS to PS exposes LTE networks and users to new vulnerabilities. We focus on three security aspects:
1. **Access Control**: How to trick VoLTE to gain PS data access, despite its role for voice?
2. **Information Leakage**: How to learn private, critical information on voice calls from VoLTE?
3. **Policy and Operations**: Will voice-related policies and operations (e.g., billing and QoS control) work well in the VoLTE context?

### 2.3 Attack Model and Methodology
The presumed attacker is a mobile user, and the victims can be the network operator or other mobile users. The attacker uses a rooted smartphone to gain full programmability but has no remote access to victim phones. Some attacks require an unprivileged malware to monitor basic activities and generate spam traffic. Experiments are conducted in two top-tier US carriers using Android phones (Samsung Galaxy S5 and LG G3). Both rooted and unrooted phones are tested, and the results apply to both carriers unless specified.

We conduct this study responsibly, using only our own phones as victims and ensuring that experiments do not cause real damage. We aim to disclose VoLTE vulnerabilities and effective attacks without exacerbating the damages.

## 3. Perpetrating Mobile Data Service in VoLTE Control Plane
The first uncovered problem is that VoLTE can be exploited to carry mobile data service, which is unintended by its designers. VoLTE is developed to support calls but is not restricted to voice in operation. PS is used to exchange VoLTE signaling messages on the control plane, but it has not been hardened against non-VoLTE traffic.

### 3.1 Carrying Data in VoLTE Signaling
While VoLTE intends to use PS packets for signaling, it is not forbidden from turning PS data into VoLTE (signaling). Both data service and VoLTE require activating a bearer and obtaining IP connectivity within the LTE network. After activation, data packets can be delivered through the bearer. For VoLTE, SIP messages are exchanged through the signaling bearer upon a call request, and a voice bearer is invoked if the call is accepted.

With the packet-carrying capability, it is feasible to carry any data through the VoLTE signaling bearer under two vulnerabilities:
1. **Device Side**: No access control to prevent non-VoLTE packets from being injected into the signaling bearer (V1).
2. **Network Side**: Injected packets are allowed to pass (e.g., routed to the destination by the 4G gateway, V2).

These vulnerabilities allow an adversary to gain free data access, impose overbilling, and perform DoS attacks on normal data services.
