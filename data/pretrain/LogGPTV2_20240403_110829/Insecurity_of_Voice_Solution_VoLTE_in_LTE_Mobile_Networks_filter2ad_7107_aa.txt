ABSTRACT
VoLTE (Voice-over-LTE) is the designated voice solution to the
LTE mobile network, and its worldwide deployment is underway. It
reshapes call services from the traditional circuit-switched telecom
telephony to the packet-switched Internet VoIP. In this work, we
conduct the ﬁrst study on VoLTE security before its full rollout. We
discover several vulnerabilities in both its control-plane and data-
plane functions, which can be exploited to disrupt both data and
voice in operational networks. In particular, we ﬁnd that the adver-
sary can easily gain free data access, shut down continuing data
access, or subdue an ongoing call, etc. We validate these proof-
of-concept attacks using commodity smartphones (rooted and un-
rooted) in two Tier-1 US mobile carriers. Our analysis reveals that,
the problems stem from both the device and the network. The de-
vice OS and chipset fail to prohibit non-VoLTE apps from access-
ing and injecting packets into VoLTE control and data planes. The
network infrastructure also lacks proper access control and runtime
check.

INTRODUCTION
Voice is a simple utility service, yet vital to both mobile operators

is also going through its fast evolution. This solution to the 4G
network is called VoLTE (Voice over LTE).
In a nutshell, VoLTE is a Voice-over-IP (VoIP) scheme for the
packet-switched (PS)-only, all-IP based LTE network [5]. It aban-
dons the circuit-switched (CS), legacy call solution to 2G/3G net-
works. The design appears straightforward. It carries voice mes-
sages in IP packets on the data plane, no longer through the dedi-
cated circuit. To facilitate the voice communication, each VoLTE
call also maintains a separate signaling session on the control plane.
This is akin to VoIP over the Internet. However, VoLTE adopts
cellular-speciﬁc techniques to ensure carrier-grade quality. It lever-
ages high-priority, quality-of-service (QoS) offered by the LTE net-
work for both signaling and voice data sessions.
Consequently, VoLTE offers clear beneﬁts over its legacy 2G/3G
call service, including improved quality (e.g., crystal-clear calls via
high-ﬁdelity codecs), more options (e.g., video calling, voicemail
and conferencing), and better interoperability (e.g., over mobile
networks, WiFi and the wired Internet). It is thus mandatory and
designated as the ultimate call solution [5]. As VoLTE shifts its
design paradigm from CS to PS, we are interested in whether such
substantial changes would possibly imperil the LTE network, as
well as mobile users.
In this work, we examine whether VoLTE exposes new and un-
expected threats. Our study stems from a simple rule of thumb
in that any major change is probably a source for insecurity. With
the nontrivial changes from CS to PS in its core technology, VoLTE
may interfere with other system components, thereby inducing new
loopholes. Technology-wise, we suspect that identical, PS-based
operations for voice and data may open the door to run data over
VoLTE. Moreover, as IP forwarding is easily accessible by the mo-
bile OS, VoLTE extends the rigid CS access within the device chipset
(hardware), to the more open PS access in software (OS and mo-
bile apps). This likely invalidates the existing protection mecha-
nisms and security defenses for traditional voice. Last, different
from normal data services, VoLTE has higher priority in resource
allocation to ensure better quality. It may inadvertently act as the
side-channel to leak critical information.
Our study conﬁrms all above suspicions. VoLTE may disrupt
both data and voice. First, the VoLTE control session can be abused
to carry PS data packets, beyond voice signaling messages. More
threateningly, with no billing upon VoLTE control packets, this ex-
ploitation leads to free data access. Such free service is available
to both Mobile-to-Internet and Mobile-to-Mobile communications.
Furthermore, the control-plane exploitation empowers higher-priority,
yet undeserved data access. This shuts down progressing data ses-

sions (data DoS), or imposes data overcharges on the victim. Sec-
ond, VoLTE is prone to new voice DoS attacks. An unprivileged
malware can mute an ongoing call when the session information is
leaked from the side channels on the data plane or improper coor-
dination between both data and control planes. Table 1 summarizes
our ﬁndings, which are conﬁrmed in two top-tier US carriers. We
further propose remedies on both control and data planes, both de-
vice and network sides to secure VoLTE.
The identiﬁed root causes are also multi-faceted. The mobile
technology standards, the device OS and hardware, and the net-
work operations all contribute to the security weakness. First, mo-
bile standards offer loose regulations to operations on both control
and data planes. VoLTE carries both its control signaling and voice
message over IP packets. However, both planes can be tricked to
transmit or receive non-VoLTE packets. The mobile technology
standards do not stipulate mechanisms to permit only authentic
voice packets in VoLTE. Second, mobile devices cannot prohibit
unintended access to VoLTE. Software and hardware rely on each
other for protection. Non-VoLTE apps gain access via software to
VoLTE, thus injecting packets into the hardware chipset. Mean-
while, the hardware always trusts the trafﬁc coming from the soft-
ware (OS and apps) and allows it to pass on without due check.
Consequently, the device should also share the blame. Third, net-
work operations should also be held accountable. The carrier trusts
mobile devices (in fact, their chipsets), and proper defense on the
network side is not entirely enforced.
In summary, we conduct the ﬁrst empirical study on VoLTE in-
security by systematically considering all the dimensions: control
plane, data plane, and their coordination. We further conﬁrm our
ﬁndings over two US carriers. The paper makes three contributions.
1. We identify seven vulnerabilities on its control plane, data
plane and coordination between both. They span mobile de-
vices (hardware and software) and carrier networks, rang-
ing from access control, billing policy, to QoS schemes and
VoLTE operations.
2. We devise proof-of-concept attacks (e.g., free data access,
data overcharging, data and voice DoS attacks) to exploit
identiﬁed vulnerabilities. We assess their impact in opera-
tional networks.
3. We deduce root causes, recommend solutions, and share the
learnt lessons. The mobile Internet industry is likely to ben-
eﬁt from such lessons, since it is still at its early stage for
full-ﬂedged, worldwide VoLTE deployment. Note that the
security of control and data planes is a generic problem for
different network services. The exposed issues and learned
lessons from VoLTE can also be applied to them.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. §2 gives the back-
ground of VoLTE, its potential vulnerabilities, and the attack model
of this work. In §3 and §4, we disclose vulnerabilities of VoLTE and
sketch attacks in terms of VoLTE control and data planes, respec-
tively. We then propose recommended ﬁx in §5, discuss several re-
maining issues in §6, updates ongoing efforts to ﬁx these problems
in §7. § 8 and §9 present related work, and conclusion, respectively.
2. NEW SECURITY ISSUES WHEN VOLTE
TURNS VOICE INTO “DATA”
In this section, we ﬁrst review VoLTE and then identify its poten-
tial vulnerabilities. We describe the attack model and our assess-
ment methodology.
2.1 VoLTE Primer
VoLTE is projected as the primary voice solution to the LTE
users. It migrates the legacy, circuit-switched (CS) voice service
to the packet-switched (PS) design.
Network architecture for VoLTE.
Figure 1 depicts a simpliﬁed
architecture to support VoLTE. Two subsystems are involved. The
ﬁrst is the PS delivery subsystem (top), which exists before VoLTE
is enabled. Its role is to offer the PS connectivity to and from mo-
bile devices, thus accommodating versatile data services. The core
component is the 4G gateway, which forwards packets, akin to edge
routers in the Internet. It also provides certain control utilities such
as policy enforcement and data volume billing. The second is the
IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS, bottom), which supports IP tele-
phony and multimedia services [9]. It consists of two key elements:
the media gateway and the signaling server. The former is to deliver
multimedia (e.g., voice) trafﬁc to VoLTE users or traditional tele-
phony users. The latter is to perform call control functions among
the device, the media gateway and the 4G gateway.
How VoLTE works?
As illustrated in Figure 1, each VoLTE
call requires two communication sessions. The control-plane ses-
sion is to exchange the call signaling messages through the popular
317Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [30]; it is established and remains
active as long as the VoLTE feature is on. The data-plane session
handles the voice packet delivery, e.g., via the Internet Real-time
Transport Protocol (RTP) [6]; it is established on demand by the
control session. Note that no dedicated communication channel
(circuit) is reserved between the caller and the callee.
Instead,
all the voice trafﬁc and signaling messages are carried in packets
and delivered over IP. As a result, the 4G gateway not only relays
data packets to/from the Internet for ordinary mobile broadband
services, but also routes packets on both control and data planes
between the device and the IMS core.
To ensure carrier-grade call quality, VoLTE leverages the multi-
ple service classes (e.g., the guaranteed bit rate and different priori-
ties [8]) offered by LTE. Its data plane is carried by the guaranteed-
bit-rate class, which assures the lowest bit rate. Its control plane
uses the non-guaranteed-bit-rate category, but with the highest pri-
ority. In both cases, VoLTE signaling and voice are delivered with
higher priority than data services.
2.2 Potential Vulnerabilities
Ultimately, voice and data operate in the same, connection-less
IP network. However, this paradigm shift is double-edged, expos-
ing LTE networks and users to unanticipated vulnerabilities.
In this paper, we look into three security aspects.
1. How to trick VoLTE to gain PS data access, despite its des-
ignated role for voice? Technically, this relates to the access
control fences to VoLTE at the device and the network.
2. How to learn private, critical information on voice calls from
VoLTE? Note that VoLTE is IP based and more open and
accessible than the legacy CS call service.
3. Will the voice-related policies and operations (e.g., voice billing
and QoS control) work well in the VoLTE context? If not,
what are the imposed threats to LTE?
Our study covers three aspects of VoLTE operations: control-
plane, data-plane, and the coordination between control and data
planes. Such security issues span the device, the 4G Gateway and
the IMS core. In the following sections, we disclose how the cur-
rently employed or newly developed mechanisms fail to harden
VoLTE against attacks and how they are exploited to menace data
services (§3) and voice calls (§4).
2.3 Attack Model and Methodology
The presumed attacker is a mobile user, whereas the victims can
be the network operator or/and other mobile users. The adversary
uses a commodity smartphone rooted to gain full programability.
However, (s)he has no remote access, at least no privileged access
to the victim phones. In some attacks (i.e., data DoS, overbilling
and voice DoS), an unprivileged malware is required to monitor
basic activities and information (e.g., when the data transfer starts
and the IP information of network interfaces) on the victim phones.
The voice DoS also requires the malware to generate spam trafﬁc.
In all cases, the attacker has no control over the carrier network.
The network is not compromised.
To validate vulnerabilities and attacks, we conduct experiments
in two top-tier US carriers denoted as OP-I and OP-II1. They to-
gether represent almost 50% of market share. We use two An-
droid phone models that support VoLTE: Samsung Galaxy S5 and
LG G3, running Android 4.4.4 and 4.4.2, respectively. Note that
VoLTE functions on only a few recent models, because it requires
phone hardware and software upgrades (its rollout in US started in

them to ﬁx the identiﬁed issues.
2014). Both rooted and unrooted ones are tested. We focus on the
Android OS but we believe that the identiﬁed issues are applica-
ble to any other OS. The results also apply to both carriers unless
explicitly speciﬁed.
We bear in mind that some feasibility tests and attack evaluations
might be detrimental to users or operators. Therefore, we conduct
this study in a responsible manner through two measures. First,
we use only our own phones as the victims. Second, in those tests
beneﬁcial to mobile users (e.g., free data access), we carry out ex-
periments without exploiting them for real beneﬁt. Speciﬁcally, for
each phone, the total volume of free data services we test is always
less than that of data plan we have. We seek to disclose VoLTE vul-
nerabilities and effective attacks, but not to aggravate the damages.
We do not claim that the attacks are not the most powerful ones to
make damage.
3. PERPETRATING MOBILE DATA SERVICE
IN VOLTE CONTROL PLANE
The ﬁrst uncovered problem is that VoLTE can be exploited to
carry mobile data service, which is unintended by its designers.
VoLTE is developed to support calls but it is not restricted to voice
in operation. PS is employed to exchange VoLTE signaling mes-
sages on the control plane. However, it has not been hardened
against access to non-VoLTE trafﬁc (i.e., normal PS data service).
We discover that this can be indeed tricked to sustain two forms
of Mobile-to-Internet and Mobile-to-Mobile data access in opera-
tional networks. More threateningly, the billing scheme and quality
control for VoLTE can be abused to endanger LTE networks and
users. In the former, such unintended data access can bypass its
due charges, thereby yielding free data service, or result in over-
billing at victims. In the latter, it unjustly gains the highest priority
assigned to VoLTE signaling. It can be further manipulated for a
DoS attack against normal data service.
3.1 Carrying Data In VoLTE Signaling
While VoLTE intends to use PS packets to carry signaling mes-
sages, it is never forbidden from turning PS data into VoLTE (sig-
naling). Similar to the data service that retains a bearer (i.e., IP con-
nectivity), VoLTE also has a signaling bearer for its control-plane
operation. As shown in Figures 2a and 2b, both need to ﬁrst acti-
vate a bearer and obtain an IP connectivity within the LTE network.
Afterwards, data packets can be delivered through this bearer once
any service starts. The device sets the source address as that allo-
cated by the 4G Gateway and the destination as the target host’s.
For VoLTE, upon any call request, SIP messages are exchanged be-
tween the device and the IMS core through the signaling bearer. It
then on-demand invokes a voice bearer to carry conversation traf-
ﬁc if the call is accepted. When the call ends, the voice bearer is
released.
With the packet-carrying capability, it is feasible to carry any
data through the VoLTE signaling bearer under two vulnerabilities.
First, on the device side, there is no access control to prevent non-
VoLTE packets from being injected into the signaling bearer (V1).
Second, on the network side, these injected packets are allowed to
pass by (e.g., routed to the destination by the 4G gateway, V2).
