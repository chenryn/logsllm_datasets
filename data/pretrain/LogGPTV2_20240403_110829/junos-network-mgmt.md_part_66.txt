### Introduction to System Alarms and Interface Alarms

#### Overview
Starting with Junos OS Releases 12.3X48-D85, 15.1X49-D180, and 19.2R1, a system alarm is triggered when the Network Security Process (NSD) fails to restart due to one or more subcomponents failing. The alarm logs are saved in the `messages` log and are automatically cleared once NSD restarts successfully. The `show chassis alarms` and `show system alarms` commands have been updated to display the specific condition: "NSD fails to restart because subcomponents fail."

**Note:** When an alarm is raised, run the following commands for more information:
- `show system alarms`
- `show chassis alarms`
- `show chassis fpc pic-status`

For detailed information on these commands, refer to the documentation for `show system alarms`, `show chassis alarms`, and `show chassis fpc`.

### Alarm Severity Levels

Alarms are categorized into two severity levels:

- **Major (Red):** Indicates a critical situation that requires immediate action. This can be due to:
  - Hardware component failures.
  - Exceeding temperature thresholds.
  - Critical warnings on configured interfaces.

- **Minor (Yellow):** Indicates a non-critical condition that, if left unchecked, might cause service interruptions or performance degradation. This includes:
  - Missing rescue configuration.
  - Software license issues.

### Enabling Alarms on Device Interfaces

To enable alarms on a device interface, you must select both an alarm condition and its severity. Chassis and system alarms, however, come with preconfigured conditions and severities.

**Note:** For detailed information on chassis alarms, consult the Hardware Guide for your specific device.

### Interface Alarm Conditions

Table 78 lists the interface conditions, sorted by interface type, that can be configured for alarms. Each condition can trigger either a major (red) or minor (yellow) alarm. The corresponding configuration options are provided.

#### Table 78: Interface Alarm Conditions

### System Alarm Conditions

Table 79 lists the preset system alarms, the conditions that trigger them, and the corrective actions.

#### Table 79: System Alarm Conditions and Corrective Actions

| Alarm Type | Alarm Condition | Corrective Action |
|------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Configuration | Rescue configuration not set. | Set the rescue configuration. |
| License     | Valid feature license not installed. | Install a valid license key. |

**Note:** This alarm indicates a violation of the software license agreement. A valid license key must be installed to comply with all agreements.

### Release History

- **Junos OS Release 15.1X49-D60 and 17.3R1:** A new system alarm is introduced to indicate that PICs (I/O card or SPC) have failed to come online during system start time.
- **Junos OS Releases 12.3X48-D85, 15.1X49-D180, and 19.2R1:** A system alarm is triggered when the NSD fails to restart due to the failure of one or more subcomponents. The alarm is logged and automatically cleared upon successful restart.

### Example: Configure Interface Alarms

#### Requirements
- Establish basic connectivity.
- Configure network interfaces. See the Interfaces User Guide for Security Devices.
- Select the network interface and the condition to trigger the alarm.

#### Overview
In this example, we configure the system to generate red and yellow alarms based on various interface conditions.

#### CLI Quick Configuration
```plaintext
set chassis alarm ds1 ylw red
set chassis alarm ethernet link-down red
set chassis alarm serial cts-absent yellow dcd-absent yellow
set chassis alarm serial loss-of-rx-clock red loss-of-tx-clock red
set chassis alarm t3 ylw red exz yellow los red
set system login class admin login-alarms
```

#### Step-by-Step Procedure
1. Navigate to the `chassis alarm` hierarchy.
2. Configure DS1 and Ethernet alarms.
3. Configure serial alarms.
4. Configure T3 alarms.
5. Configure the system to display active system alarms.

#### Verification
- Use the `show chassis alarms` and `show system login` commands to verify the configuration.
- Enter `commit` to apply the configuration.

### IP Monitoring Overview

IP monitoring is used to check the reachability of upstream devices. It supports various actions such as preferred static route injection and multiple probe names under the same policy. The feature monitors IP addresses through RPM probes and takes predefined actions based on the reachability results.

#### Test Parameters and Thresholds
- **Probe Count:** 1
- **Probe Interval:** 3 seconds
- **Test Interval:** 1 second

#### Supported Thresholds
- **Successive-Loss:** Successive loss count of probes.
- **Total-Loss:** Total probe lost count.

### IP Monitoring Through Redundant Ethernet Interface Link Aggregation Groups

IP monitoring checks the reachability of an upstream device and allows a redundancy group (RG) to automatically failover if the monitored IP address is not reachable through the redundant Ethernet. Both primary and secondary devices in the chassis cluster monitor specific IP addresses to determine the reachability of an upstream device.

This comprehensive guide should help you understand and configure system and interface alarms, as well as IP monitoring, in Junos OS.
