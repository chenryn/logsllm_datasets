Question: "An adversary is attempting to evade detection by a cybersecurity team that is actively using debuggers to analyze malware behavior. The adversary's malware is designed to perform checks for debugging artifacts and alter its behavior upon detection. As a cybersecurity analyst, which of the following techniques would you consider monitoring to detect the adversary's evasion attempts?"
 "A": "Monitoring for the execution of API calls such as 'IsDebuggerPresent()' and 'NtQueryInformationProcess()'."
 "B": "Checking for the constant presence of the 'COR_ENABLE_PROFILING' environment variable on all system processes."
 "C": "Inspecting the system for any looping calls to 'OutputDebugStringW()' that may flood debug logs."
 "D": "Observing for the use of 'PTRACE_DENY_ATTACH' flag with 'ptrace' command to prevent debugger attachment."
