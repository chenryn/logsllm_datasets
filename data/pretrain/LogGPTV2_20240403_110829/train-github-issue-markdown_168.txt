Hey!  
PowerToys currently have a feature that lets you remap keys to other keys (key
-> key) and shortcuts to other shortcuts (shortcut -> shortcut). It would be
nice to be able to remap key -> shortcut too. For example: "Home -> Win+M"
would minimize all windows when pressing the Home button, by remapping the
Home key to the Win+M shortcut.  
The opposite would be nice too. For example: "Win+1 -> F1" would press the F1
key when you press the Win+1 shortcut.
