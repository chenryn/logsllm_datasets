Hello,

PowerToys currently offers a feature that allows you to remap keys to other keys (key-to-key) and shortcuts to other shortcuts (shortcut-to-shortcut). It would be beneficial to extend this functionality to include the ability to remap a single key to a shortcut. For example, remapping the "Home" key to the "Win+M" shortcut would minimize all windows when the Home key is pressed.

Conversely, it would also be useful to remap a shortcut to a single key. For instance, pressing "Win+1" could be remapped to trigger the "F1" key.

Thank you,
[Your Name]
