ﬁeld of opportunistic routing and coding based approaches
for mesh networks [3, 4, 5, 15]. These mechanisms exploit
the broadcast nature of the wireless medium and are based
on the possibility of overhearing (of data packets) in the
network. As shown in Figure 3 nearly 50% of the MAPs
have a degree of more than 3. This indicates that there
might be a good possibility of overhearing (of data packets)
in the mesh network.
In order to understand the achievable gains from overhearing-
based mechanisms in the MadMesh deployment, we take
the example of COPE [4], a network coding scheme based
on opportunistic overhearing of data packets, and calcu-
late an estimate of throughput improvements achievable at
each MAP. COPE achieves in-network data compression by
XORing multiple data packets together and transmitting a
single coded packet. The number of packets which can be
coded together at each MAP is determined by the coding
rule in [4]. which indicates that n packets (destined to n
neighboring MAPs) can be coded together only if the struc-
ture of the network permits each of the n neighboring MAPs
to overhear the other n − 1 packets. In such a case, a cod-
ing gain of n is said to be achieved at this MAP. In order
to estimate the throughput improvements possible at each
MAP, we derive the maximum coding gain at each of the
MAPs using the above coding rule. Note that, the coding
gain achievable in practice also depends on the underlying
routing mechanism, the number of ﬂows and the direction of
these ﬂows. Here, we are interested in ﬁnding out the net-
work coding opportunities the deployment inherently sup-
ports and we therefore look at the best case scenario i.e., we
assume that each of the MAPs always has backlogged traﬃc
to send to each of the other neighboring MAPs.
Figure 7 shows the maximum coding gain for each of the
MAPs in the network, if it were to act as the relay node (i.e.,
the node where the packets were being coded). We observe
that around 10% of the MAPs have no coding opportuni-
ties available as they were the leaf MAPs (MAPs with only
one neighboring MAP). For about 66% of the MAPs in the
network the maximum coding gain achievable was only 2
i.e., even though the number of neighboring MAPs for each
of these MAPs were more than 1, the structure of the net-
work did not permit coding more than 2 packets. However,
there are around 24% of the MAPs where coding gains of
more than 2 were possible with the maximum coding gain
reaching 6 for some of the MAPs.
This shows that techniques like network coding can po-
tentially improve the performance of such densely deployed
outdoor mesh deployments.
4. ON MESH ROUTING STRATEGIES
Routing in multihop wireless mesh networks has been a
ﬁeld of signiﬁcant research in recent times. Algorithms pro-
posed in [3, 1, 4] describe routing algorithms designed to
improve the performance of the network. Studying the func-
tioning of a routing algorithm in a mesh network spanning
a city is an exciting problem in its own right. Ideally, such
characterization would involve large scale experimentation.
However, the commercial nature of the mesh deployment
constrains the amount of experimentation feasible. In par-
ticular, we could not change the parameters of the routing
algorithm to observe its characteristics. Instead, we studied
the performance of the routing algorithm in terms of the
routing paths created and the relative stability of the rout-
ing paths. To reason about the quality and stability (or lack
thereof) of the routing paths, one needs to know about the
factors which aﬀect the routing decision. In this section, we
attempted to answer the following questions:
• How often do routes change and what speciﬁc events
(from the routing algorithm’s perspective) trigger these
changes?
• What is the consequence of the routing algorithms
used on the structure of data trees?
• What are potential ineﬃciencies in the routing mech-
anisms?
4.1 Understanding behavior of mesh routing
algorithm
In this section we present a study of the mesh routing
decision algorithm. Our goal is to correlate each possible
routing changes with its root cause. The current mesh de-
ployment uses ease metric for route creation. Details of this
metric are presented in [17]. The ease is based on a weighted
sum of the SNR and hop count of the potential MAPs. The
MAP chooses a neighbor which has the best value for the
metric. On comparing this metric with ETX [1], we ﬁnd
that ETX uses (expected transmission count) over a link as
an indicator of the quality of the link, in contrast the current
metric uses the SNR value as a predictor of the same. Both
of them sum the metric over the entire path.
On studying the SNMP logs to identify root cause of
a route change we found that both hop count and SNR
changes were involved in 0.9 of the entire parent changes
(1-0.1 = 0.9). For the rest 0.1 of the cases both SNR and
hopcount worsened due to the parent change. On closer in-
spection we found that in another .06 of the (total) cases
the one of the ancestors increased its hop in the routing tree
which made it a bad parent option and hence forced a rout-
ing tree change. We could not account for the rest 0.04% by
looking at the logs.
4.2 Implication of the mesh routing metrics
A routing metric which is a weighted sum of the link SNRs
and hop count, has some non-obvious implications on the
ﬁnal routing paths being used by the MAPs. We comment
on them below.
Implication on hop count of the MAPs
The SNMP data contains periodic updates about the hop
count of each MAP. We utilize this information to plot Fig-
ure 8 which depicts the distribution of average number of
MAPs on diﬀerent hops in the network. We observe that
around 15% of the MAPs in the network are RAPs. Also,
the average number of MAPs decrease with increase in the
hop count i.e., a higher number of MAPs are present at
the lower hops. Thus, the network is well deployed and the
routing algorithm performs well for most of the time.
However, we also observe that around 8% of the MAPs
have a hop count of more than 5. Conventional wisdom
suggests that the achievable throughput of the in a multi-
hop network degrades drastically with increasing hop count.

parent changes for all the MAPs (Note: Rest of the
MAPS did not show any parent change)
Implication on route stability
The MAPs in the network can form links to more than
one MAP in their neighborhood. A parameter of interest
to gauge the performance of the routing algorithm is the
relative stability of the routing paths. Large ﬂuctuations
in the path imply that the network conditions are unsta-
ble. These might be caused by the appearance of another
potential link with better characteristics, disappearance of
the current parent link or occurrence of certain other events
such as increased interference etc., which make a previously
unattractive parent link more attractive.
We show the stability characteristics of the mesh routing
algorithm in Figure 10. This ﬁgure shows the relative fre-
quency of the parent changes for all the MAPs occurring
in a given duration. The data was collected by analyzing
a parent change counter present in the SNMP log for each
MAP over the span of passive data collection. This plot
shows that some MAPs have a faster rate of changing their
parent than other MAPs. We observed that the high par-
ent change frequency for some of the MAPs was due to: (a)
presence of multiple parent choices with similar quality (in
terms of SNR and hop count) which coupled with momen-

Hop count
Figure 8: Plot showing fraction of MAPs at various
hops, and the number of users at each hop
be because of two reasons: (a) the network was not planned
well and therefore suﬃcient routing choices were not avail-
able (b) the routing algorithm is not choosing the right path.
To investigate, whether this high hop-count is a result of
bad deployment, we looked into the the best available neigh-
bors in terms of hop-count (i.e., neighbor MAPs with lowest
hop-counts) for MAPs with a hop-count greater than 4. We
have plotted the CDF of the hopcounts of such neighbors
with the best available hops and reasonable link quality (link
SNR higher than 14 dB) in Figure 9. As can be seen from
the plot, the MAPs at hop-counts higher than 4 always have
a neighbor with better hopcount available. This leads to the
conclusion that the phenomenon is not an artifact of the de-
ployment i.e., there were other (shorter) paths available in
the network, but the routing algorithm did not choose to
use it. This behavior is an implication of using a routing
metric which is a weighted sum of SNR and hop-count. A
neighbor with which the MAP has a better link (in terms
of SNR) is given priority as potential parent over another
MAP with lower hopcount and a relatively lower SNR. Such
long paths can be avoided if the route selection algorithm
uses a threshold on SNR for selecting the potential parents
and then decides amongst the potential parents based on
hop-count.
tary ﬂuctuations in the wireless characteristics makes one of
the links momentarily better than the rest forcing the MAP
to ﬂap its route. (b) he link to the parent for some inter-
mediate MAP (ancestor) has very bad SNR (less than 10
dB), this causes the intermediate MAP to choose a diﬀer-
ent parent frequently, thus causing a route ﬂap. A possible
remedy for reducing the amount of route ﬂapping would be
keep a threshold on the number of times a MAP can change
its route in a given quantum.
5. ON MESH USER EXPERIENCE
Robust client performance is important in commercial,
pay per use mesh network. Although careful evaluation of
SNMP logs provide us with valuable insight into the dynam-
ics of mesh infrastructure, client performance can be better
understood by carrying out targeted active measurements
at diﬀerent locations in the mesh. Speciﬁcally, we want to
know the following regarding client performance in commer-
cial mesh deployment under study:
• How good is the quality of client to mesh connectivity
in MadMesh ? Are coverage holes prevalent ? What
is the impact of client mobility on coverage holes?
• What is the maximum achievable throughput by a
mesh client ? What is the impact of hop-count, RSSI,
channel congestion on the client throughput?
• Is there any issue of starvation at higher hops when
clients are present at lower hops as well ?
Broadly, the aforementioned questions relate to two main
issues - how easily can a client connect to the network and
once connected, what is the observed performance. We ﬁrst
describe our measurements for characterizing client connec-
tivity in the mesh deployment, followed by a detailed anal-
ysis of client performance.
5.1 Client connectivity
Ubiquitous client connectivity is one of the most impor-
tant goals of large scale mesh deployments. In order to main-
tain client connectivity, it is important to have a monitoring
infrastructure in place which can identify ‘coverage holes’
created due to obstacles, weather and temporary interfer-
ence sources. Once such coverage holes are detected, correc-
tive action can be taken by adjusting power levels of diﬀer-
ent MAPs or by deploying new ones. Existing approaches
commonly used by leading vendors, employ pathloss mod-
els to estimate the expected area of coverage. Such models
describe the attenuation experienced by wireless signal as
a function of distance.
In order to assess the eﬃcacy of
such pathloss models, we ﬁrst perform detailed experiments
to characterize the pathloss exponent in our urban environ-
ment.
Characterizing pathloss exponent
In the following equation, α is the pathloss exponent, and ǫ
is the shadowing component that describes the variation in
pathloss exponent. PdBm(d) is the signal strength measured
at a given distance d, while PdBm(d0) is the signal strength
at the reference distance d0 [16].
