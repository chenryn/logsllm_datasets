The bottom of the quickstart page has a link: Sharing your Localhost Server
with Localtunnel to a page with old/outdated information on Localtunnel. (it
is pointing to Localtunnel here, which doesn't exist).
Localtunnel now appears to be: here or on github here, and is installed via
`npm`, not `gem`.
