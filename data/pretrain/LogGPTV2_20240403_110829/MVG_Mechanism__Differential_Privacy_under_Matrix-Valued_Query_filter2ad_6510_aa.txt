ABSTRACT
Differential privacy mechanism design has traditionally been tai-
lored for a scalar-valued query function. Although many mecha-
nisms such as the Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms can be ex-
tended to a matrix-valued query function by adding i.i.d. noise to
each element of the matrix, this method is often suboptimal as it
forfeits an opportunity to exploit the structural characteristics typi-
cally associated with matrix analysis. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel differential privacy mechanism called the Matrix-
Variate Gaussian (MVG) mechanism, which adds a matrix-valued
noise drawn from a matrix-variate Gaussian distribution, and we rig-
orously prove that the MVG mechanism preserves (ϵ, δ)-differential
privacy. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of directional noise
made possible by the design of the MVG mechanism. Directional
noise allows the impact of the noise on the utility of the matrix-
valued query function to be moderated. Finally, we experimen-
tally demonstrate the performance of our mechanism using three
matrix-valued queries on three privacy-sensitive datasets. We find
that the MVG mechanism can notably outperforms four previous
state-of-the-art approaches, and provides comparable utility to the
non-private baseline.

1 INTRODUCTION
Differential privacy [23, 24] has become the gold standard for a
rigorous privacy guarantee. This has prompted the development
of many mechanisms including the classical Laplace mechanism
[24] and the Exponential mechanism [67]. In addition, there are
other mechanisms that build upon these two classical ones such
as those based on data partition and aggregation [2, 15, 44, 57,
76, 80, 81, 94, 95, 97, 101], and those based on adaptive queries
[26, 37, 41, 58, 59, 64, 99]. From this observation, differentially-
private mechanisms may be categorized into the basic and derived
mechanisms. Privacy guarantee of the basic mechanisms is self-
contained, whereas that of the derived mechanisms is achieved
through a combination of basic mechanisms, composition theorems,
and the post-processing invariance property [22].
In this work, we design a basic mechanism for matrix-valued
queries. Existing basic mechanisms for differential privacy are de-
signed typically for scalar-valued query functions. However, in
many practical settings, the query functions are multi-dimensional
and can be succinctly represented as matrix-valued functions. Exam-
ples of matrix-valued query functions in the real-world applications
include the covariance matrix [8, 13, 27], the kernel matrix [55],
the adjacency matrix [34], the incidence matrix [34], the rotation
matrix [47], the Hessian matrix [85], the transition matrix [33], and
the density matrix [91], which find applications in statistics [32],
machine learning [88], graph theory [34], differential equations
[85], computer graphics [47], probability theory [33], quantum
mechanics [91], and many other fields [92].
One property that distinguishes the matrix-valued query func-
tions from the scalar-valued query functions is the relationship
and interconnection among the elements of the matrix. One may
naively treat these matrices as merely a collection of scalar values,
but that could prove suboptimal since the structure and relation-
ship among these scalar values are often informative and essential
to the understanding and analysis of the system. For example, in
graph theory, the adjacency matrix is symmetric for an undirected
graph, but not for a directed graph [34] – an observation which
is implausible to extract from simply looking at the collection of
elements without considering how they are arranged in the matrix.
In differential privacy, the standard method for a matrix-valued
query function is to extend a scalar-valued mechanism by adding
independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) noise to each element
• We introduce a novel concept of directional noise, and pro-
pose two simple algorithms to implement this novel concept
with the MVG mechanism.
• We evaluate our approach on three real-world datasets and
show that our approach can outperform four prior mech-
anisms in all experiments, and yields utility close to the
non-private baseline.
2 PRIOR WORKS
Existing mechanisms for differential privacy may be categorized
into two types: the basic mechanism [7, 10, 23–25, 62, 67, 86, 87];
and the derived mechanism [2, 12, 15, 17, 26, 37, 41, 41, 43, 44, 49,
50, 54, 57–60, 64, 76, 79–81, 94–97, 101]. Since our work concerns
the basic mechanism design, we focus our discussion on this type,
and provide a general overview of the other.
2.1 Basic Mechanisms
Basic mechanisms are those whose privacy guarantee is self-contained,
i.e. it does not deduce the guarantee from another mechanism. Here,
we discuss four popular existing basic mechanisms.
2.1.1 Laplace Mechanism. The classical Laplace mechanism [24]
adds noise drawn from the Laplace distribution scaled to the L1-
sensitivity of the query function. It was initially designed for a
scalar-valued query function, but can be extended to a matrix-
valued query function by adding i.i.d. Laplace noise to each ele-
ment of the matrix. The Laplace mechanism provides the strong
ϵ-differential privacy guarantee and is relatively simple to imple-
ment. However, its generalization to a matrix-valued query function
does not automatically utilize the structure of the matrices involved.
2.1.2 Gaussian Mechanism. The Gaussian mechanism [23, 25, 62]
uses i.i.d. additive noise drawn from the Gaussian distribution scaled
to the L2-sensitivity. The Gaussian mechanism guarantees (ϵ, δ)-
differential privacy. Like the Laplace mechanism, it also does not
automatically consider the structure of the matrices.
Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) Transform. The JL transform method
2.1.3
[7] uses multiplicative noise to guarantee (ϵ, δ)-differential privacy.
It is, in fact, a rare basic mechanism designed for a matrix-valued
query function. Despite its promise, previous works show that
the JL transform method can be applied to queries with certain
properties only, e.g.
• Blocki et al. [7] use a random matrix, whose elements are
drawn i.i.d. from a Gaussian distribution, and the method
is applicable to the Laplacian of a graph and the covariance
matrix;
• Blum and Roth [10] use a hash function that implicitly rep-
resents the JL transform, and the method is suitable for a
sparse query;
• Upadhyay [86, 87] uses a multiplicative combination of ran-
dom matrices to provide a JL transform that is applicable to
any matrix-valued query function whose singular values are
all above a threshold.
Among these methods, Upadhyay’s works [86, 87] stand out as
possibly the most general. In our experiments, we show that our

The schematic shows an example when m = n = 2.
of the matrix [23–25]. However, this method may not be optimal
as it fails to utilize the structural characteristics of the matrix-
valued noise and query function. Although some advanced methods
have explored this possibility in an iterative/procedural manner
[37, 41, 75], the structural characteristics of the matrices are still
largely under-investigated. This is partly due to the lack of a basic
mechanism that is directly designed for matrix-valued query func-
tions, making such utilization and application of available tools in
matrix analysis challenging.
In this work, we formalize the study of the matrix-valued differ-
ential privacy, and present a new basic mechanism that can readily
exploit the structural characteristics of the matrices – the Matrix-
Variate Gaussian (MVG) mechanism. The high-level concept of the
MVG mechanism is simple – it adds a matrix-variate Gaussian noise
scaled to the L2-sensitivity of the matrix-valued query function (cf.
Fig. 1). We rigorously prove that the MVG mechanism guarantees
(ϵ, δ)-differential privacy. Moreover, due to the multi-dimensional
nature of the noise and the query function, the MVG mechanism
allows flexibility in the design via the novel notion of directional
noise. An important consequence of the concept of directional noise
is that the matrix-valued noise in the MVG mechanism can be de-
vised to affect certain parts of the matrix-valued query function
less than the others, while providing the same privacy guarantee.
In practice, this property could be beneficial as the noise can be
tailored to minimally impact the intended utility.
Finally, to illustrate the effectiveness of the MVG mechanism, we
conduct experiments on three privacy-sensitive real-world datasets
– Liver Disorders [30, 61], Movement Prediction [4], and Cardiotocog-
raphy [18, 61]. The experiments include three tasks involving matrix-
valued query functions – regression, finding the first principal com-
ponent, and covariance estimation. The results show that the MVG
mechanism can outperform four prior state-of-the-art mechanisms
– the Laplace mechanism, the Gaussian mechanism, the Exponential
mechanism, and the JL transform – in utility in all experiments.
To summarize, our main contributions are as follows.
• We formalize the study of matrix-valued query functions in
differential privacy and introduce the novel Matrix-Variate
Gaussian (MVG) mechanism.
• We rigorously prove that the MVG mechanism guarantees
(ϵ, δ)-differential privacy.
approach can yield higher utility for the same privacy budget than
these methods.
2.1.4 Exponential Mechanism. The Exponential mechanism uses
noise introduced via the sampling process [67]. It draws its query an-
swers from a custom distribution designed to preserve ϵ-differential
privacy. To provide reasonable utility, the distribution is chosen
based on the quality function, which indicates the utility score of
each possible sample. Due to its generality, it has been utilized for
many types of query functions, including the matrix-valued query
functions. We experimentally compare our approach to the Expo-
nential mechanism, and show that, with slightly weaker privacy
guarantee, our method can yield significant utility improvement.
Summary. Finally, we conclude that our method differs from
the four existing basic mechanisms as follows. In contrast with
the i.i.d. noise in the Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms, the MVG
mechanism allows a non-i.i.d. noise (cf. Sec. 5). As opposed to the
multiplicative noise in the JL transform and the sampling noise in
the Exponential mechanism, the MVG mechanism uses an additive
noise for matrix-valued query functions.
2.2 Derived Mechanisms
Derived mechanisms – also referred to as “revised algorithms” by
Blocki et al. [7] – are those whose privacy guarantee is deduced
from other basic mechanisms via the composition theorems and
the post-processing invariance property [22]. Derived mechanisms
are often designed to provide better utility by exploiting some
properties of the query function or the data.
The general techniques used by derived mechanisms are often
translatable among basic mechanisms, including our MVG mecha-
nism. Given our focus on a novel basic mechanism, these techniques
are less relevant to our work, and we leave the investigation of in-
tegrating them into the MVG framework in the future work, and
some of the popular techniques used by derived mechanisms are
summarized here.
Sensitivity Control. This technique avoids the worst-case
2.2.1
sensitivity in basic mechanisms by using variant concepts of sen-
sitivity. Examples include the smooth sensitivity [76] and elastic
sensitivity [50].
2.2.2 Data Partition and Aggregation. This technique uses data
partition and aggregation to produce more accurate query answers
[2, 15, 44, 57, 80, 81, 94, 95, 97, 101]. The partition and aggregation
processes are done in a differentially-private manner either via the
composition theorems and the post-processing invariance prop-
erty [22], or with a small extra privacy cost. Hay et al. [43] nicely
summarize many works that utilize this concept.
2.2.3 Non-uniform Data Weighting. This technique lowers the level
of perturbation required for the privacy protection by weighting
each data sample or dataset differently [17, 37, 41, 79]. The rationale
is that each sample in a dataset, or each instance of the dataset itself,
has a heterogeneous contribution to the query output. Therefore,
these mechanisms place a higher weight on the critical samples or
instances of the database to provide better utility.
2.2.4 Data Compression. This approach reduces the level of pertur-
bation required for differential privacy via dimensionality reduction.
Various dimensionality reduction methods have been proposed. For
example, Kenthapadi et al. [54], Xu et al. [96], Li et al. [60] and
Chanyaswad et al. [12] use random projection; Jiang et al. [49]
use principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant
analysis (LDA); Xiao et al. [94] use wavelet transform; and Acs et
al. [2] use lossy Fourier transform.
2.2.5 Adaptive Queries. These methods use past/auxiliary infor-
mation to improve the utility of the query answers. Examples are
the matrix mechanism [58, 59], the multiplicative weights mecha-
nism [37, 41], the low-rank mechanism [99, 100], correlated noise
[75, 93], least-square estimation [75], boosting [26], and the sparse
vector technique [25, 64]. We also note that some of these adaptive
methods can be used in the restricted case of matrix-valued query
where the matrix-valued query can be decomposed into multiple
linear vector-valued queries [41, 42, 74, 75, 98, 100]. However, such
as an approach does not generalize for arbitrary matrix-valued
queries.
Summary. We conclude with the following three main observa-
tions. (a) First, the MVG mechanism falls into the category of basic
mechanism. (b) Second, techniques used in derived mechanisms are
generally applicable to multiple basic mechanisms, including our
novel MVG mechanism. (c) Finally, therefore, for fair comparison,
