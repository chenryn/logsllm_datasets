Many of these methods were aimed at teaching them 
to postpone judgement and interpretation, to let the 
situation speak to them as such, to engage in field 
research with an open mind. It is thus that which at 
first appears coincidental, acquires the traits of a skill 
which can be learnt.
Various coincidental encounters with people and 
situations, inspired and nudged students’ designs into 
sometimes surprising, new, but valuable directions 
which could hardly have been foreseen on beforehand. 
They had been inspired by the situation at hand, the 
richness of first-hand, unfiltered experience.
Yet they could only happen because the process left 
room for it. The danger of micromanaging processes 
in view of quick fixes or solutions by rushing forward 
is always lurking around the corner, especially there 
where stakes are high and preferred outcomes or 
results can be blinding. 
When learning is the primary purpose - for both schools 
and for example local policymakers - school-driven 
projects of design for social innovation generally 
benefit from a context which is shielded from pressures 
which would overemphasize the need for a particular 
solution in the shortest amount possible. 
The “Welcome to Saint-Gilles” project could thankfully 
take place without such pressures and could therefore 
also demonstrate to stakeholders the variety of 
solutions and changes in stakeholder dynamics to 
which design for social innovation could lead.
3.  CONCLUSIONS
The above are but a handful of lessons drawn from 
experiences in design initiatives aimed at social 
innovation in which design educators and students, 
citizens and policymakers collaborate. Although simple 
and straightforward, they point towards valuable 
insights regarding future points of attention/challenges 
for design practice, design education and policy making.

IMPLICATIONS FOR: 
DESIGN PRACTICE
In a context in which the public is involved to collaboratively look for improvements 
to society in its smallest to its largest manifestations, more than anything else, 
the designer’s or design team’s role can be considered as that of a catalyst of 
change. Through interaction they will set the stage for solutions to be designed 
collaboratively, later on continued and scaled. Sparking and maintaining momentum 
of (inter)action to enable change is the work of a catalyst. To do this well, knowledge 
of societal systems (e.g. public institutions) and its interactions as well as group 
facilitation skills are welcome assets. The design team has specific knowledge and 
expertise in terms of design processes moving from research and ideas through 
concepts to implementations. They are also skilled at integrating knowledge and 
insights from other disciplines in the design process, yet should not (wish to) become 
pseudo-experts in those disciplines as such. 
It is to be expected that designers will increasingly occupy also positions embedded 
within public sector structures. This will not only infuse design logic and processes 
within the context of policymaking and -implementation, yet also inform and inspire 
design practice to develop new approaches to tackling societal challenges. This body 
of knowledge and know-how will once more (need to) enrich the design discourse 
and the skills and expertise of agencies focussing on design for social innovation.
DESIGN EDUCATION
The “Welcome to Saint-Gilles” project has once again shown the need for design 
education to expand the knowledge and skill-set of educators and students to 
enable them to carry out multi-stakeholder design processes in a public context 
successfully. In this respect one can think of everything from facilitation and 
group dynamics to basic urban anthropology or sociology and business model 
development, all of which are valuable enrichments of the designer’s know-how. 
The consolidation and build-up of knowledge derived from experiences such as 
these - and to which the Public & Collaborative initiative is a welcome contribution - 
requires and deserves more attention. 
As skills shift and design teams will incorporate and adapt knowledge and know-
how from other disciplines, new people will also bring about new dynamics. Many 
design programs are still very much (over)focussed on educating the ‘individual 
designer’, while in view of future challenges and modes of knowledge creation, 
exchange and work, they could benefit from a more balanced approach which 
includes also the necessary team- and network-skills.
It is worth noting as well that education is not a tapas bar and no one exercise make 
an expert. Students would therefore benefit from more integrated curricula in which 
the knowledge and skills they acquire through their participation in real-life projects 
of design for social innovation can be deepened through multiple experiences and 
iterations.
47
Furthermore, considering the nature of the projects and the frequency and depth of 
interaction required, both the project and the students’ learning experience would 
benefit from extra-curricular involvement of students in local communities. In the 
case of “Welcome to Saint-Gilles” several students became passionately involved, 
putting in lots of extra(curricular) time to better understand their context and better 
serve the people their designs were intended to serve or influence. In the current 
educational climate, such passionate involvement should receive more attention, 
recognition and encouragement. Only then will we be able to ‘grow’ the design-
driven social innovators we as a society need.
POLICYMAKING
Getting involved early and deeply in design-driven initiatives of social innovation 
offers a unique opportunity for local policymakers to engage with their audience, 
increase their empathy for and understanding of the situation on the terrain.
As they are likely to be in the position of managing the projects or setting their 
constraints, it is crucial that policymakers understand the needs of the project 
and especially the process involved (e.g. room to experiment, flexibility, learning, 
etc.). As mentioned earlier (see for example “Managing expectations”) also lies an 
important role for the designer or coordinator to safeguard these principles and 
mediate between the interests and viewpoints of stakeholders involved. Involving 
policymakers in ongoing projects elsewhere before embarking on an adventure 
in their home context, can be a valuable way for them to get acquainted with the 
methods and approaches and allow them to assess the appropriate management 
style.
In terms of the latter, it is crucial that they understand that ‘process’ is as at least 
as important as ‘project’. This proves generally to be a steep challenge, since new 
initiatives taken by policymakers are often tightly linked to policy-cycles and other, 
fixed agendas, with a clear beginning, end and culmination point. However there are 
no guarantees that the evolution and momentum of a project of social innovation 
follows or should follow that same flow. As such processes often involve a change of 
ways and culture, they require flexibility in time and space.
When it comes to involving schools in designing for social innovation in local 
communities, there are a few points of attention worth to be addressed. Schools are 
first and foremost educational institutions. As policymaking, also education has its 
rhythm and calendar. Also these can be in or out of synch with the flow of activity 
required in terms of community interaction. 
Second, in times of budget cuts and diminished financial means, local policymakers 
may see in schools a ‘cheap alternative’ to address a problem/challenge rather 
than invest in a more costly professional design practice. This would be unfair 
to the schools, the design professionals and most of all the local community, yet 
unfortunately it happens. This is an important pitfall to avoid for all involved, 
including design schools.
48
IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICYMAKING (CONT.)
That being said, policymakers creating space for schools to engage in real life’s societal 
challenges and solutions is a valuable investment in the next generation of problem 
solvers and preventers, and a boost to community building efforts across generations. 
In many contexts, the valuable role design schools can play as catalysts of change and 
a low-threshold entry point to experiment with design for social innovation is still 
underestimated and undervalued. Last but not least, there are various ways in which 
schools and professional design practices could collaborate and be of complementary 
value to one another. So far these modi operandi have been insufficiently explored.
Last but not least, investing in whichever project of social innovation ought to be seen 
a long term investment and commitment. Policymakers and civil servants ought to be 
prepared to invest in continuation, experimentation and scaling, out of respect for local 
communities and stakeholders involved. Designers would do well to emphasize this 
more when and especially before engaging in participatory projects of design for social 
innovation.

ABOUT THE AUTHORS
Nik Baerten was trained as a knowledge engineer. For several years he was active as a multidisciplinary researcher 
at the Digital Culture department of the Maastricht McLuhan Institute. In 2004, he co-founded Pantopicon, a studio 
for futures exploration and envisioning based in Antwerp (Belgium), blending foresight & design. In 2013, the 
studio and its partner Concrete were awarded a Henry Van de Velde Design Label for their social design project 
“Museum in our street”. Nik lectures at the MAD Faculty in Genk (Belgium). Besides a foresight-oriented course 
entitled “futurestudio”, he also teaches - together with Virginia Tassinari - an applied course on design for social 
innovation, through which for several years they engaged students in community-oriented projects of “design for 
togetherness”.

LEARNING TOGETHER: STUDENTS AND COMMUNITY 
GROUPS CO-DESIGNING FOR CARBON REDUCTION IN 
THE LONDON BOROUGH OF CAMDEN
Adam Thorpe and Lorraine Gamman 
ABSTRACT
In 2012, the London Borough of Camden (Camden Council) identified 30 ‘Green Zones’ – local neighborhoods, 
including King’s Cross where Central Saint Martins College of Arts and Design (CSM) is located, that are 
characterized by the presence of community champions and/or community groups that are committed to 
delivering behavioral change that supports more sustainable ways of living within their neighborhoods.  This
article reflects on how the University of the Arts London (UAL) DESIS Lab, working in partnership with the 
London Borough of Camden’s Sustainability Team, supported students from CSM’s BA Product Design and MA 
Applied Imagination courses to collaborate with local residents to design new ways to change behaviors to 
reduce carbon emissions. Reflection on the practice of delivering the project confirms some of our previous
understandings about the best way to deliver student design projects that address societal challenges working 
with community groups. It also highlights further challenges that need to be addressed when seeking to deliver 
similar DESIS projects in the future.  Finally, we consider the implications of these findings for design practice, 
design education and policy makers.

1.  INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
The theme ‘Public and Collaborative’ was proposed 
and defined by Ezio Manzini and colleagues at 
Parsons, The New School for Design in September 
2011, with the intention of catalyzing a collaborative 
exploration of the design questions: ‘How are the 
emerging social networks meeting public services and 
innovation policies? And vice versa,  how can public 
services and innovation policies trigger, empower, direct 
the emerging social networks? What can design do to 
make this ‘promise’ more effective and fruitful?’ (See also 
the P&C Background Notes at http://www.desis-
clusters.org/background-notes). 
This paper shares insights into how the UAL DESIS Lab 
team at CSM taught BA Product Design students and 
MA Applied Imagination students to support social 
innovation1 initiatives and to work with and for the 
local community to design for social change, whilst 
adhering to the undergraduate students’ apparently 
contradictory course requirements and examination 
objectives.  We feel it is the insights that can be 
derived from the full account of how the project 
progressed, the challenges and barriers to success, 
as well as the final outcomes achieved that may be 
of interest to other design educators and provide a 
contribution to knowledge in this area of research and 
practice.  In doing so we contribute to an address to 
Margolin’s concern that ‘attention [has not] been given 
to changes in the education of product designers that 
might prepare them to design for populations in need 
rather than for the market alone’.2
1.1. UAL DESIS Lab structure
The UAL DESIS Lab is coordinated from within the 
Socially Responsive Design3 and Innovation Hub at the 
Design Against Crime Research Centre (DACRC).  We 
deliver practice-based and practice-led research in the 
field of socially responsive design for innovation and 
sustainability.  As a research centre we do not have 
1 
 New ideas (products, services and models) that simultaneously 
meet social needs and create new social relationships or 
collaborations. In other words, they are innovations that are both 
good for society and enhance society’s capacity to act. See: Murray, 
R., Mulgan, G., Caulier-Grice, J. (2008). How to innovate: The tools for 
social innovation. The Young Foundation.

direct access to a cohort of design students, so to work 
with our student cohort we have to negotiate with 
course leaders.  Typically, this requires planning twelve 
months ahead to run a student project with courses 
in the School of Communication, Product and Spatial 
Design, the school from which our Research Centre 
originated.  Working with students we deliver ‘thematic 
projects’ that explore our research interests or develop 
and test research questions and design resources.  We 
also work with students to deliver ‘client projects’ that 
apply the research and methods developed by the 
centre to the specific challenges of clients who set the 
project brief - such as banks seeking to reduce ATM 
fraud, police and other public service providers seeking 
to reduce cycle theft or local government and public 
service providers seeking to promote sustainable 
transport (see http://www.desis-network.org/content/
ual-university-arts-london-desis-lab ). 
1.2. A Socially Responsive Design approach
Typically DACRC projects are both ‘user centered’ and 
‘collaborative’ i.e. working with diverse stakeholders 
and duty holders4 to co-define design challenges 
and co-create designed responses.  Despite these 
collaborative activities, the term co-design does not 
clearly describe our project approach as a whole due 
to the varying intensities of collaboration that occur at 
various stages in the project/process.  Similarly whilst 
our projects typically apply a multitude of design tools 
and techniques often associated with service design 
e.g. stakeholder/duty holder mapping, agenda mapping, 
asset mapping, journey mapping, service blueprinting 
(or system mapping), the use of ethnographic design 
research techniques and appreciation and creation of 
personas (to understand the needs of diverse social 
actors), the term ‘service design’ does not accurately 
describe the projects we deliver which combine the 
infrastructuring of social networks with the design of 
products and services that address societal needs and 
challenges and constitute an account of design for 
social innovation and sustainability.

  ‘Stakeholders’ are the individuals and groups that have a stake in 
the issues/questions being addressed.  
‘Duty-holders’ are the individuals and groups that have a ‘duty of 
care’, a legal or moral obligation, in relation to the issues/questions 
being addressed. The Online Dictionary defines ‘duty’ as ‘something 
that one is expected or required to do by moral or legal obligation’ 
and ‘holder’ as three types of noun e.g. 1. something that holds 
(http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hold) or secures: 2. a person 
who has the ownership, possession (http://dictionary.reference.com/
browse/possession), or use of something; owner; tenant. 3. Law. a 
person who has the legal right to enforce a negotiable instrument.   
52
We use the term ‘socially responsive design’5 to 
embrace the range of design activities which, as design 
researchers and designers, we engage in with diverse 
actors that prioritize social goals and needs over those 
of the market.  This approach has been celebrated as 
an exemplar of social impact, and led to the licensing 
of designs and the creation of commercial and social 
enterprises6.  It is an approach that we have explained 
at length elsewhere7 .
2.  GREEN CAMDEN PUBLIC AND COLLABORATIVE 
(P&C) PROJECT SET-UP
In January 2012, Camden Council approached our 
research team to explore the possibility of a practice 
based research project focusing on assisting the council 
in changing the behaviors of social actors within the 
London Borough of Camden so as to reduce carbon 
emissions by exploring new ways of living and working 
in Camden.  The council’s Sustainability Team had 
identified three distinct stakeholder groups that they 
wished to target with initiatives to change behavior 
so as to reduce carbon emissions (linked to a desire to 
meet targets for carbon reduction of 40% by 2020).  The 
three groups were; (i) Camden Council staff (ii) Camden 
businesses, and (iii) Camden residents.  Each of these 
groups were to be addressed separately and each of the 
three initiatives were managed by a different budget and 
project lead.  We felt that Camden residents represented 
the best fit to the ‘Public and Collaborative’ call.
During these discussions with the council we became 
aware of their ‘Green Zone’ initiative8 which targeted
