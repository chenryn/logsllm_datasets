Currently, the Cassandra documentation recommends using a ReplicationController for deployment. I suggest updating the documentation to include DaemonSets as a valid and more practical method for deploying a single Cassandra node on each Kubernetes node. This approach better reflects real-world deployment scenarios.

For reference, see issue #15324.
