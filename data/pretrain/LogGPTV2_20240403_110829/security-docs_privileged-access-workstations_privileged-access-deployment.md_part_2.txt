   * Description - **Deployment of secure workstations**.
   * Set **Convert all targeted devices to Autopilot** to **Yes**. This setting makes sure that all devices in the list get registered with the Autopilot deployment service. Allow 48 hours for the registration to be processed.
1. Select **Next**.
   * For **Deployment mode**, choose [**Self-Deploying (Preview)**](/mem/autopilot/self-deploying). Devices with this profile are associated with the user who enrolls the device. During the deployment, it is advisable to use the Self-Deployment mode features to include:
      * Enrolls the device in Intune Microsoft Entra automatic MDM enrollment, and only allow for a device to be accessed until all policies, applications, certificates, and networking profiles are provisioned on the device.
      * User credentials are required to enroll the device. It's essential to note that deploying a device in the **Self-Deploying** mode will allow you to deploy laptops in a shared model. No user assignment will happen until the device is assigned to a user for the first time. As a result, any user policies such as BitLocker will not be enabled until a user assignment is completed. For more information about how to log on to a secured device, see [selected profiles](/intune/device-profile-assign). 
   * Select your Language (Region), User account type **standard**. 
1. Select **Next**.
   * Select a scope tag if you have preconfigured one.
1. Select **Next**.
1. Choose **Assignments** > **Assign to** > **Selected Groups**. In **Select groups to include**, choose **Secure Workstations**.
1. Select **Next**.
1. Select **Create** to create the profile. The Autopilot deployment profile is now available to assign to devices.
Device enrollment in Autopilot provides a different user experience based on device type and role. In our deployment example, we illustrate a model where the secured devices are bulk deployed and can be shared, but when used for the first time, the device is assigned to a user. For more information, see [Intune Autopilot device enrollment](/intune/device-enrollment).
### Enrollment Status Page
The Enrollment Status Page (ESP) displays provisioning progress after a new device is enrolled. To ensure that devices are fully configured before use, Intune provides a means to **Block device use until all apps and profiles are installed**.

1. Set **Show app profile installation progress** to **Yes**.
1. Set **Block device use until all apps and profiles are installed** to **Yes**.
1. Choose **Assignments** > **Select groups** > choose `Secure Workstation` group > **Select** > **Save**.
1. Choose **Settings** > choose the settings you want to apply to this profile > **Save**.
### Configure Windows Update
Keeping Windows 10 up to date is one of the most important things you can do. To maintain Windows in a secure state, you deploy an [update ring](/en-us/windows/deployment/update/waas-quick-start) to manage the pace that updates are applied to workstations. 
This guidance recommends that you create a new update ring and change the following default settings:
1. In the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), choose **Devices** > **Software updates** > **Windows 10 Update Rings**.
1. Enter:
   * Name - **Azure-managed workstation updates**
   * Servicing channel - **Semi-annual channel**
   * Quality update deferral (days) - **3**
   * Feature update deferral period (days) - **3**
   * Automatic update behavior - **Auto install and reboot without end-user control**
   * Block user from pausing Windows updates - **Block**
   * Require user's approval to restart outside of work hours - **Required**
   * Allow user to restart (engaged restart) - **Required**
   * Transition users to engaged restart after an auto-restart (days) - **3**
   * Snooze engaged restart reminder (days) - **3**
   * Set deadline for pending restarts (days) - **3**
1. Select **Create**.
1. On the **Assignments** tab, add the **Secure Workstations** group.
For more information about Windows Update policies, see [Policy CSP - Update](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-update).

### Finish workstation profile hardening
To successfully complete the hardening of the solution, download and execute the appropriate script. Find the download links for your desired **profile level**:
| Profile | Download location | Filename |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Enterprise | https://aka.ms/securedworkstationgit | Enterprise-Workstation-Windows10-(20H2).ps1 |
| Specialized | https://aka.ms/securedworkstationgit | Specialized - Windows10-(20H2).ps1 |
| Privileged | https://aka.ms/securedworkstationgit | Privileged-Windows10-(20H2).ps1 |
> [!NOTE]
> The removal of of admin rights and access, as well as, Application execution control (AppLocker) are managed by the policy profiles that are deployed.  
After the script successfully executes, you can make updates to profiles and policies in Intune. The scripts will create policies and profiles for you, but you must assign the policies to your **Secure Workstations** device group.
* Here's where you can find the Intune device configuration profiles created by the scripts: **Azure portal** > **Microsoft Intune** > **Device configuration** > **Profiles**.
* Here's where you can find the Intune device compliance policies created by the scripts: **Azure portal** > **Microsoft Intune** > **Device Compliance** > **Policies**.
Run the Intune data export script `DeviceConfiguration_Export.ps1` from the [DeviceConfiguration GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/powershell-intune-samples/tree/master/DeviceConfiguration) to export all current Intune profiles for comparison, and evaluation of the profiles.
## Set rules in the Endpoint Protection Configuration Profile for Microsoft Defender Firewall
Windows Defender Firewall policy settings are included in the Endpoint Protection Configuration Profile. The behavior of the policy applied in described in the table below.
| Profile |Inbound Rules | Outbound Rules | Merge behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Enterprise | Block | Allow | Allow |
| Specialized | Block | Allow | Block |
| Privileged | Block | Block  | Block|
**Enterprise**: This configuration is the most permissive as it mirrors the default behavior of a Windows Install. All inbound traffic is blocked except for rules that are explicitly defined in the local policy rules as merging of local rules is set to allowed.  All outbound traffic is allowed.
**Specialized**: This configuration is more restrictive as it ignores all locally defined rules on the device. All inbound traffic is blocked including locally defined rules the policy includes two rules to allow Delivery Optimization to function as designed. All outbound traffic is allowed.
**Privileged**: All inbound traffic is blocked including locally defined rules the policy includes two rules to allow Delivery Optimization to function as designed. Outbound traffic is also blocked apart from explicit rules that allow DNS, DHCP, NTP, NSCI, HTTP, and HTTPS traffic. This configuration not only reduces the attack surface presented by the device to the network it limits the outbound connections that the device can establish to only those connections required to administer cloud services.
| Rule | Direction | Action | Application / Service | Protocol | Local Ports | Remote Ports |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| World Wide Web Services (HTTP Traffic-out) | Outbound | Allow | All | TCP | All ports | 80 |
| World Wide Web Services (HTTPS Traffic-out) | Outbound | Allow | All | TCP | All ports | 443 |
| Core Networking - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6(DHCPV6-Out) | Outbound | Allow | %SystemRoot%\system32\svchost.exe | TCP | 546| 547 |
| Core Networking - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6(DHCPV6-Out) | Outbound | Allow | Dhcp | TCP | 546| 547 |
| Core Networking - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6(DHCP-Out) | Outbound | Allow | %SystemRoot%\system32\svchost.exe | TCP | 68 | 67 |
| Core Networking - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6(DHCP-Out) | Outbound | Allow | Dhcp | TCP | 68 | 67 |
| Core Networking - DNS (UDP-Out) | Outbound | Allow | %SystemRoot%\system32\svchost.exe | UDP | All Ports | 53 |
| Core Networking - DNS (UDP-Out) | Outbound | Allow | Dnscache | UDP | All Ports | 53 |
| Core Networking - DNS (TCP-Out) | Outbound | Allow | %SystemRoot%\system32\svchost.exe | TCP | All Ports | 53 |
| Core Networking - DNS (TCP-Out) | Outbound | Allow | Dnscache | TCP | All Ports | 53 |
| NSCI Probe (TCP-Out) | Outbound | Allow | %SystemRoot%\system32\svchost.exe | TCP | All ports | 80 |
| NSCI Probe - DNS (TCP-Out) | Outbound | Allow | NlaSvc | TCP | All ports | 80 |
| Windows Time (UDP-Out) | Outbound | Allow | %SystemRoot%\system32\svchost.exe | TCP | All ports | 80 |
| Windows Time Probe - DNS (UDP-Out) | Outbound | Allow | W32Time | UDP | All ports | 123 |
| Delivery Optimization (TCP-In) | Inbound | Allow | %SystemRoot%\system32\svchost.exe | TCP | 7680 | All ports |
| Delivery Optimization (TCP-In) | Inbound | Allow | DoSvc | TCP | 7680 | All ports |
| Delivery Optimization (UDP-In) | Inbound | Allow | %SystemRoot%\system32\svchost.exe | UDP | 7680 | All ports |
| Delivery Optimization (UDP-In) | Inbound | Allow | DoSvc | UDP | 7680 | All ports |
> [!NOTE]
> There are two rules defined for each rule in the Microsoft Defender Firewall configuration. To restrict the inbound and outbound rules to Windows Services, e.g. DNS Client, both the service name, DNSCache, and the executable path, C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe, need to be defined as separate rule rather than a single rule that is possible using Group Policy.
You can make additional changes to the management of both inbound and outbound rules as needed for your permitted and blocked services. For more information, see [Firewall configuration service](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-firewall/create-windows-firewall-rules-in-intune).
### URL lock proxy
Restrictive URL traffic management includes:
* Deny All outbound traffic except selected Azure and Microsoft services including Azure Cloud Shell and the ability to allows self-service password reset.
* The Privileged profile restricts the endpoints on the internet that the device can connect to using the following URL Lock Proxy configuration.
```
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings]
"ProxyEnable"=dword:00000001
"ProxyServer"="127.0.0.2:8080"
"ProxyOverride"="*.azure.com;*.azure.net;*.microsoft.com;*.windowsupdate.com;*.microsoftonline.com;*.microsoftonline.cn;*.windows.net;*.windowsazure.com;*.windowsazure.cn;*.azure.cn;*.loganalytics.io;*.applicationinsights.io;*.vsassets.io;*.azure-automation.net;*.visualstudio.com,portal.office.com;*.aspnetcdn.com;*.sharepointonline.com;*.msecnd.net;*.msocdn.com;*.webtrends.com"
"AutoDetect"=dword:00000000
```
The endpoints listed in the ProxyOverride list are limited to those endpoints needed to authenticate to Microsoft Entra ID and access Azure or Office 365 management interfaces.  To extend to other cloud services, add their administration URL to the list. This approach is designed to limit access to the wider internet to protect privileged users from internet-based attacks. If this approach is deemed too restrictive, then consider using the approach described below for the privileged role.
## Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps, URLs restricted list to approved URLs (Allow most)
In our roles deployment it is recommended that for Enterprise, and Specialized deployments, where a strict *deny all* web browsing is not desirable, that using the capabilities of a cloud access security broker (CASB) such as [Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/what-is-cloud-app-security) be utilized to block access to risky, and questionable web sites. The solution addresses a simple way to block applications and websites that have been curated. This solution is similar to getting access to the block list from sites such as the Spamhaus Project who maintains [the Domain Block List (DBL)](https://www.spamhaus.org/dbl/): a good resource to use as an advanced set of rules to implement for blocking sites.
