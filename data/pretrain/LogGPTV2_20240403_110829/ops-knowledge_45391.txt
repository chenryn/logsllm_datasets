User: Should Python library modules start with #!/usr/bin/env python?
Looking at first lines of *.py in /usr/share/pyshared (where Python libs are stored in Debian) reveals that there are both files that start with the hashbang line and those that do not.
Is there a reason to include or omit this line?
Assistant: if you want your script to be an executable, you have to include this line
