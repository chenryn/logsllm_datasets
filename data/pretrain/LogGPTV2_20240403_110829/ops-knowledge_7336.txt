User: i have thousands of servers(linux), some only has python 2.x and some only has python 3.x, i want to write one script check.py can run on all servers just as $./check.py without use $python check.py or $python3 check.py, is there any way to do this?
my question is how the script check.py find the Interpreter no matter the Interpreter is python2.x and python3.x
Assistant: In the general case, no; many Python 2 scripts will not run on Python 3, and vice versa. They are two different languages.
Having said that, if you are careful, you can write a script which will run correctly under both. Some authors take extra care to make sure their scripts will be compatible across both versions, commonly using additional tools like the six library (the name is a pun; you can get to "six" by multiplying "two by three" or "three by two").
However, it is now 2020, and Python 2 is officially dead. Many maintainers who previously strove to maintain Python 2 compatibility while it was still supported will now be relieved and often outright happy to pull the plug on it going forward.
