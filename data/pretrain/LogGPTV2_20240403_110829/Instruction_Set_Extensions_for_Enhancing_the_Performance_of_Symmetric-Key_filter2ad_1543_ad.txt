6.3 Hardware Resource Requirements
Table 8. Hardware Utilization — Xilinx
XC4VLX25 FPGA
Table 8 shows the component usage of the Xilinx Virtex-
4 XC4VLX25 FPGA by each added functional unit and the
total utilizations of the LEON2 processor with combinations
of instruction set extensions for each targeted algorithm. Due
to the number of storage bits needed for matrix conﬁguration
6.4 Algorithm Throughput Comparisons
Table 9 presents throughput data for baseline implementa-
tions of the target algorithms versus implementations of the
472472
target algorithms using the proposed instruction set exten-
sions when performing encryption in non-feedback mode.
The results are analyzed with respect to the hardware re-
sources required for each implementation to determine the
hardware cost associated with improving the execution time
of the targeted algorithms using the proposed instruction
set extensions. Throughput data is presented in terms of
Megabits per second (Mbps), hardware usage is presented
in terms of FPGA conﬁgurable logic block (CLB) slices, and
throughput/area (T/A) ratios are presented in bits per second
per slice.
The data shows that the instruction set extensions yielded
the best improvement for DES in terms of T/A ratio, with
the ratio increasing by a factor of 25.6. This increase is a re-
sult of nearly all of the DES functionality being off-loaded to
the added hardware. As expected, T/A ratios for Triple-DES
were approximately 1
3 of the corresponding values for DES
because both algorithms require the same hardware in order
to be implemented using the instruction set extensions. The
T/A ratio for Triple-DES increased by a factor of 25.8 when
instruction set extensions are used, matching the increase ev-
idenced by DES. In the case of IDEA, the instruction set
extensions had a signiﬁcant impact upon performance at a
reasonable hardware cost, with the measured T/A ratio in-
creasing by a factor of 5.9. For AES, the instruction set ex-
tensions used in conjunction with the column-oriented im-
plementations yield larger increases in throughput versus the
instruction set extensions used in conjunction with the row-
oriented implementations. As a result, the column-oriented
implementations yielded a greater increase in T/A ratio and
are superior to the row-oriented implementations when using
the proposed instruction set extensions.
7 Conclusions
Instruction set extensions for improving software im-
plementations of symmetric-key algorithms have been pro-
posed. Existing literature on the subject of enhancing the per-
formance of symmetric-key algorithms was discussed, fol-
lowed by detailed descriptions of the targeted processor and
the targeted cryptographic algorithms. Descriptions of the
custom instructions were given along with the functional
units that implement the underlying logical and arithmetic
operations. The results show that the proposed instructions
have a signiﬁcant positive effect on program code size for
all of the targeted algorithms, shrinking the number of code
bytes by up to a factor of 31.2. Execution time for all algo-
rithms was also improved, with demonstrated speedups by
factors of up to 32.8. The instruction set extensions required
only a 63% increase in the logic utilization of the LEON2
processor on the chosen FPGA device while decreasing the
maximum clock frequency by approximately 10%. All of
the targeted algorithms evidenced an increase in T/A ratio,
increasing by a factor of up to 25.8. Finally, it was demon-
strated that column-oriented implementations of AES are
superior to row-oriented implementations for all evaluation
metrics when using the proposed instruction set extensions.
