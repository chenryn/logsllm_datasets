s e section may produce results. I do not recommend searching from the main page, as there are no advanced 
options. Instead, click on any section title. For example, clicking on the "for sale" section will take us to that 
arefl fii tOP' th.6 Pa8c have a search field that will search all of the categories in this section. Additionally, 
we can ter yr price range, posts that contain images, or terms that only appear in the title of the post.
Craigslist also has features that allow' you to view results by list view, gallery' view, or map view. These locations 
wi o „ y' re er to the city of the item, and not exact GPS location. The gallery' view can be used as a "photo 
neup to i entify a stolen item. The map view can be beneficial when only' looking for items within surrounding 
°ur ncw °P°ons on the upper right of every’ result page allow you to sort the items by' newest listings 
( c au t), re cvance, lowest price, and highest price. Most pages with items for sale will also allow yo u to filter 
tic resu ts so that only' items being sold by individuals are listed. This would eliminate businesses and dealers.
c e a t is to show both, and I recommend it unless you are overwhelmed by' the number of results.
The results that are still current will link to the actual post and display all content of the post If a search result 
links to a post that has been deleted from Craigslist, a standard "page not found" error will be returned. ou 
can still get additional information from this deleted post by looldng through the text supplied on this search 
page. The brief description will often disclose an email address or telephone number. Some listings may have a 
cached view, but lately this has been rare. In a scenario where thousands of search results are presented by 
Google or Bing, you can add search terms to filter to a more manageable number of posts. Adding the make or 
model number of the product may quickly identify the stolen property.
Craigslist has a few advanced search operators that may be of interest. It supports a phrase search with quotation 
marks such as "low miles". It accepts the hyphen (-) operator to exclude terms such as honda black -red. This 
search finds postings that have 'honda' and 'black' but not 'red'. A pipe symbol (|) provides "OR" searches such 
as honda | toyota. This search finds postings that have 'honda' or 'toyota* (or both). You can group terms 
together in parentheses when queries are complicated. A search of red (toyota | honda) -2000 -2001 finds listings 
that have 'red' and either 'honda' or 'toyota' (or both) but do not have 2000 or 2001. Wildcards arc as follows.
Another way to search Craigslist posts is to identify screen names. Craigslist discourages inserting a screen name 
or email address within a post; however, most people have figured out how to bypass this limitation. Instead of 
someone typing their email address within their posts, they will insert spaces between the first portion of the 
email address (username) and the second portion of the email address (domain name). For example, instead of 
the user typing their email address as PI:EMAIL, he or she may identify the account as 
"JohnDoe911 at gmail com". This would be enough to prevent Craigslist's servers from identifying the text as 
an email address and prohibiting the post. Fortunately for the investigator, this information is indexed by 
Craigslist and other search engines to be retrieved.
You can also search by terms other than the product of interest. Many people that use Craigslist do not want to 
communicate through email sent from the website. Most users will include a telephone number in the post as a 
preferred method of communication. The overwhelming majority of these telephone numbers belong to the 
cellular telephone of the user submitting the post. This can be a huge piece of intelligence for an investigator 
attempting to identify a person associated with a telephone number. It is common that a criminal will purchase 
a cellular telephone with cash and add minutes to it as needed. This makes it difficult for someone to identify 
the criminal from the phone number. Ironically, the same criminal will post the telephone number as well as a 
name on a public internet site for the world to see. Sometimes, a person will post both a cellular and a landline 
telephone number on the same post. This allows an investigator to associate these two numbers, and a quick 
internet search should identify the owner of the landline telephone number.
If a thief sells the item on Craigslist, he or she will usually delete the post after the transaction is complete. If 
the post is deleted, it will not be listed in the results of a search on Craigslist This is where Google and Bing 
come into play. Both Google and Bing collect information from Craigslist posts to include in their search results. 
This collection can never be complete, but a large archive of posts is available. Searching Google or Bing with 
"sitexraigslist.org" (without quotes) will search through archived posts on Craigslist that are both active and 
removed. Similar to the previous example, you can search "site:craigslist.org laptop Edwardsville" (without the 
quotes). This search produced 572 results that match these criteria on Google. These include the current posts 
that were available with the live search on craigslist.org as well as posts that have been recently deleted from 
Craigslist. If you wanted to focus only on a specific regional area of Craigslist, changing the search to 
"site:stlouis.craigslist.org laptop Edwardsville" would filter results. This example would only show listings from 
the St. Louis section of Craigslist. You can use any region in your custom searches.
You can search any keyword in either the official Craigslist site or on Google and Bing using the "site" operator. 
In my experience, Bing offers more results of archived Craigslist posts than Google. If you do not have success 
with Bing, Google should be searched as well. Many private investigators find the "personals" section of interest. 
The "Casual encounters" area is well known for extramarital affairs. If you want to only search all live Craigslist 
posts, regardless of which geographical area it exists, you can use sites such as totalcraigsearch.com, 
adhuntr.com, and searchalljunk.com.

eBay is an online auction site. Since the site requires a user’s financial information or valid credit card to post 
items for sale, many thieves have moved to Craigslist to unload stolen goods. eBay offers an advanced search 
that will allow filters that limit to auctions from a specific location, or specified distance from the location. On 
any search page, there is an "Advanced" button that will display new options. Of these options, there is a category 
tided "show results". The last option in this category is tided "items near me". Here, you can select a zip code 
and filter results to a minimum of 10 miles from the zip code selected. This will now allow you to search for any 
item and the results will all be from sellers near a specific zip code. This location option will remain active as 
you search for different keywords. These searches will only search current auctions that have not expired. In 
order to search past auctions, select the "Completed listings" option under the category of "Search including". 
If you want to conduct your searches directly from a URL, or if you want to bookmark queries that will be 
repeated often, use the following structure. Replace TERMS with your search keywords and USER with your 
target's username.
Real World Application: Many thieves will turn to the internet to unload stolen items. While eBay requires 
banking information or a credit card to use their services, most thieves prefer Craigslist's offer of anonymity. 
My local police department successfully located a valuable stolen instrument this way and set up a sting to arrest 
the thief. Often, the thief will be willing to bring the item to you in order to get some quick cash. Another tip 
that has helped me during investigations is to look for similar backgrounds. When I had a group of gang 
members stealing iPhones from vehicles and pockets, they would sell them right away on Craigslist. Since there 
were hundreds of legitimate iPhones listed, identifying the stolen units can be difficult. By looking for similarities 
in the backgrounds, 1 could filter the list into interesting candidates. Finding unique backgrounds, such as tables 
or flooring, within several posts can be suspicious. Additionally, I have found posts that include "hurry", "must 
sell today", and "1 will come to you" to be indicators of illegal activity.
Craigslist's email alert feature has made third-party tools for this purpose unnecessary'. After logging in to your 
account, you can customize alerts to send an email to you when specific search terms are located.
An alternative to the location feature on the official eBay site is Flippity. This site performs the same function 
as mentioned previously, but with less work on the user's part. The results of your search will appear on a map 
with the ability to minimize and expand the radius as desired. This is a quick way to monitor any type of items 
being sold in a specific community.

Not everyone uses spellcheck. Some people, especially criminals, will rush to list an item to sell without ensuring 
that the spelling and grammar are correct. You could conduct numerous searches using various misspelled 
words, or you can use GoofBid. This site will take your correcdy spelled keyword search and attempt the same 
search with the most commonly misspelled variations of the search terms. Another alternative to this service is 
Fat Fingers (fatfingers.com).
This technique of using Google or Bing to search for profiles on websites that do not allow such a search can 
be applied practically everywhere. Many sites discourage the searching of profiles, but a search on Google such 
as "site:targetwebsite.com John Doe" would provide links to content matching the criteria. The difficulty arises 
in locating all of the sites where a person may have a profile. By now, you can search the major communities, 
but it is difficult to keep up with all of the lesser-known networks.
Amazon is the largest online retailer. Users flock to the site to make purchases of anything imaginable. After th*! 
receipt of die items ordered, Amazon often generates an email requesting the user to rate the items. This review 
can only be created if the user is logged in to an account This review is now associated with the user in the user 
profile. An overwhelming number of users create these product reviews and provide their real information on 
the profile for their Amazon account. While Amazon does not have an area to search for this information by 
username, you can do it with a search engine. A search on Google of site:amazon.com followed by any target 
name may link to an Amazon profile and several item reviews. The first link displays the user profile including 
photo, location, and the user's review of products purchased.
This service is steadily stealing the audience currendy dominated by Craigslist. OfferUp claims to be the simplest 
way to buy and sell products locally. A search on their main page allows you to specify a keyword and location. 
The results identify the usual information including item description and approximate location. OfferUp follows 
the eBay model of including the seller's username and rating. The unique option with OfferUp is the ability to 
locate the actual GPS coordinates associated with a post instead of a vague city and state. This information is 
not obvious, but can be quickly obtained. While on any post, right-click and choose to view the page source. 
Inside this new tab of text should be two properties tided place:location:latitude and placedocationdongitude. 
You can search for these in your browser by pressing "Ctrl" + "F" (Windows) or "command" + "F" (Mac). 
Next to these fields should display GPS coordinates. In my experience, these precise identifiers will either 
identify the exact location of the target, or a location in the neighborhood of the suspect. I would never rely on 
this all the time, but I have had great success getting close to my targets through this technique.
If you find yourself searching multiple geographical areas of Craigslist and eBay, you may desire an automated 
solution. Search Tempest will allow you to specify the location and perimeter for your search. It will fetch items 
from Craigslist, eBay, and Amazon. You can specify keywords in order to narrow your search to a specific area. 
Advanced features allow search of items listed within the previous 24 hours, reduction of duplicates, and filtering 
by categories. While I encourage the use of these types of services, I always warn people about becoming too 
reliant on them. These tools could disappear. It is good to understand the manual way of obtaining data.
There is an abundance of fake reviews on Amazon, which can make it difficult to determine which rexnews 
accurately describe a product and which are provided by employees associated with the seller. FakeSpot attempts 
to identify' products that are likely misrepresented by the review community. During a search for a remote-

Pinterest is an online "pinboard" where users can share photos, links, and content located anywhere on the 
internet. It is a way to rebroadcast items of interest to a user. People that follow that user on Pinterest can keep 
updated on things that the user is searching and reading. The search feature on die main website is useful for 
keyword searches only. It will search for any term and identify posts that include those words within the 
description. A search of my last name displayed several photos of people. Clicking each of these links will present 
the full-page view of the photo and any associated comments. This page will also identify the full name of the 
person that uploaded the content and the original online source. Clicking on the full name of the user will open 
the user profile which should include all "pinned" content. Unfortunately, you cannot search a person's full 
name or username on Pinterest and receive a link to their profile page. To do this, you must use Google. The 
following direct search URLs will identify the usernames (BILL) and keywords (CRAFTS) present on Pinterest.
controlled drone, I found that the Amazon "Best Seller" possesses over 53% fake reviews, and top reviewers 
"tri nguyen" and "EUN SUN LEE" appear to be automated reviewers based on other products. This service 
also supports analysis of reviewers on Yelp and Trip Advisor. FakeSpot now requires you to install a browser 
extension. If this sendee is valuable to your investigations, I find this sendee effective. If you rarely need this 
type of data, 1 would avoid any unnecessary extensions.
Similar to the previous search tools, this option attempts to simplify the various search techniques presented 
within this chapter. Figure 14.05 displays the current view. This tool should replicate all of the specific URLs 
cited within this topic. While the chances of your target appearing here are lower than large social networks, this 
resource should not be ignored. In my experience, the details obtained about a target from online communities 
are usually much more intimate and personal than the public blasts on the larger sites.
This utility may violate your departmental policies about online research. BugMeNot allows users to share their 
logins for various websites with the world. Technically, users of this sendee are giving the public consent to use 
their credentials in order to access data behind a login. However, this could violate the terms of sendee for a 
specific website. I once needed to access a private web forum which was hidden behind a login portal. This 
forum was not accepting new members. Searching the URL on BugMeNot revealed a username and password 
shared by a member of the forum for public use. This allowed me to access the site and find my desired data.
