User: I need to call a .bat file from anywhere in the directory without including the specific directory in the script. You'll just need to specify the name of .bat file you want to call and then run. Is this possible?
Assistant: do you mean calling a script without specifying the exact location from commandline?
there are two ways:

add it to your path (eg: set it in your PATH environment variable)
setup an alias/some sort of shortcut in your bashrc/whatever CLI you are using (since you are using windows, one example would be to setup a cmdlet in windows powershell or something)
