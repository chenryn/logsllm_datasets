User: I have a python module that is shared among several of my projects (the projects each have a different working directory).  One of the functions in this shared module, executes a script using os.spawn.  The problem is, I'm not sure what pathname to give to os.spawn since I don't know what the current working directory will be when the function is called.  How can I reference the file in a way that any caller can find it?  Thanks!
Assistant: Put it in a well known directory (/usr/lib/yourproject/ or ~/lib or something similar), or have it in a well known relative path based on the location of your source files that are using it.
