 **TypeScript Version:**
nightly (1.9.0-dev.20160429)
**Code**
    interface Foo {
        readonly foo: string;
    }
    const foo = {
        get foo(this: Foo): string { // <- A 'get' accessor cannot have parameters.
            return 'foo';
        }
    };
**Expected behavior:**
Ability to type `this` without errors.
**Actual behavior:**
Errors given when trying to type `this` in a `get` accessor.
While this example is non-sensical, `this` typing on other `get` accessors
would be a useful feature and since they are erasable, it isn't like the
accessor has an actual parameter.
