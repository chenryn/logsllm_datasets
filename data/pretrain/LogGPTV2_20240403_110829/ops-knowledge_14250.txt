Question: "Imagine that you are developing a new web application that requires secure storage of user passwords. To mitigate the risk of password leaks, you decide to use cryptographic hash functions. Considering the threat of length extension attacks and the need for secure hashing, which cryptographic hash algorithm would you choose to implement, and why?"
 "A": "SHA-256, because it is a member of the SHA2 family and has a 256-bit output, which is considered secure."
 "B": "SHA-512, because it is a member of the SHA2 family with a 512-bit output, providing higher security."
 "C": "SHA3-256, because SHA3 includes additional internal state that is not reflected in the output, making it resistant to length extension attacks."
 "D": "MD5, because it was one of the earliest hash functions and is well-understood in terms of security."
Answer: C
