host; (2) the differences between the metabolomes of uninfected and infected snails; (3) the possibility that soldier trematodes release an alarm 
pheromone to recruit other soldiers to the defense of the colony

Novel sources for Striga resistance: looking toward the rhizosphere
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Benjamin Thiombiano, University of Amsterdam, Netherlands
CO-AUTHORS: Dorota Kawa, Aimee Walmsley, Hanna Vahldick, Siobhan Brady, Harro Bouwmeester
Striga species are roots-parasitic plants widely distributed and able to infest rice, maize, sorghum and different other crops S hermonthica 
is considered the most serious worldwide parasitic weed, with an estimated affected area amounting to many millions of hectares Aside of 
intercropping, fertilization, Striga low germinant genotype, soil microbiome has also been explored Our preliminary data are suggesting that 
microbiome may lead to a decrease of Striga infestation rate To better understand the mechanisms of the microbes mediated decrease of Striga 
infestation rate, evaluating the intercommunication between plant and the microbe through sorghum roots chemical composition and roots 
exudates chemical profile is needed Here, we compared root exudates of sorghum under four different growing conditions (ie gamma radiated 
soil in presence and absence of Striga and non-gamma radiated soil in presence and absence of Striga) We analyzed roots and root exudates with 
a metabolomics approach and assessed phenotypic aspects such as Striga germination and attachment rate We showed that a Striga attachment 
was reduced in presence of microbes Using multivariate analysis, we observed a significant effect of the growing conditions on the root and roots 
exudate chemical composition Further advanced statistical analyses will be used to link the roots and root exudate chemical composition to the 
striga infestation rate in order to find the mechanisms involved in microbiome microbes mediated decrease of Striga infestation rate

Metabolomics studies of rhizosphere metabolites from 26 accession of Arabidopsis thaliana involve in plant interaction with 
rhizosphere microorganism
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Kourosh Hooshmand, Aarhus University, Denmark
CO-AUTHORS: Enoch Narh Kudjordjie, Rumakanta Sapkota, Tong Shen, Oliver Fiehn, Mogens Nicolaisen, Inge S Fomsgaard
Plants may regulate and selectively choose distinct members of a microbial community in the rhizosphere The belowground plant-microbe 
association is facilitated by exudation of a wide range of bioactive chemical compounds from the root which may lead to indirect plant resistance 
against the potential biotic challenges However, the underlying mechanism enabling the plants to shape its root microbiome structure has been 
poorly elucidated In this study, 26 accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana (wild types) were grown in soil, harvested, lyophilized and extracted The 
chemical composition of primary metabolites, secondary metabolites and lipids were determined by employing GC-TOFMS, HILIC-TripleTOF MS/
MS, and reverse phase-Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer (CSH, lipidomics) respectively GC-MS data was processed by BinBase and HILIC and 
CSH data were proceed by MS-DIAL_294 followed by post-processing with MS-FLO The bacterial and fungal composition was determined 
by Illumina MiSeq sequencing technique Carbohydrate, amino acids, and fatty acids were the main primary metabolites present in all the 
accessions Carboxylic acids, organooxygen, and benzene derivatives were also predominated polar metabolites classes, as well as fatty acyls, 
glycerophospholipids, and sphingolipids were the core lipids in all the accession Various statistical methods will be employed to identify the unique 
chemical substrates from the root of each A thaliana accessions associated with regulation of distinct members of beneficial rhizosphere microbes 
which can lead us into a more sustainable plant production

Metabolomics to exploit the primed immune system of tomato fruit
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Pierre Pétriacq, INRA & University of Bordeaux, France

Tomato is a major crop suffering substantial yield losses from diseases as fruit decay at a postharvest level can claim up to 50% of the total 
production worldwide Due to the environmental risks of fungicides, there is an increasing interest to exploit plant immunity through priming, 
which is an adaptive strategy that improves plant defensive capacity by stimulating induced mechanisms Broad-spectrum defence priming can be 
induced by the compound ß-aminobutyric acid (BABA) In tomato plants, BABA induces resistance against various fungal and bacterial pathogens 
and different methods of application result in durable protection Here, we examined whether treatment of tomato plants with BABA resulted in a 
durable induced resistance in tomato fruit against Botrytis cinerea, Phytophthora infestans and Pseudomonas syringae Targeted and untargeted 
metabolomics were used to investigate the metabolic regulations that underpin priming of tomato fruit against pathogenic microbes that present 
different infection strategies Assessment of infection showed a statistically significant reduction of disease symptoms in tomato fruit that originated 
from BABA-primed plants, thus confirming the broad effectiveness of BABA priming against various pathogens Metabolomic analyses revealed 
major changes after BABA treatment and after infection Remarkably, primed responses depended entirely on the type of infection, rather than 
showing a common fingerprint of BABA-induced priming Altogether, our results demonstrate that metabolomics is particularly insightful towards 
a better understanding of defence priming in fruit Further experiments are underway in order to identify key metabolites that mediate broad-
spectrum BABA-induced priming in tomato fruit

Metabolomic responses of tomato fruits and roots according to magnesium excess
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Min Cheol Kwon, Konkuk University, South Korea
CO-AUTHORS: Eun Sung Jung, Yangmin X. Kim, Seulbi Lee, Choong Hwan Lee
Green house cultivation uses excessive amounts of fertilizer due to the characteristics of intensive cultivation, causing nutrient salts that affect plant 
growth and development Tomato is an important economic crop that is continually threatened by salt stress To explore the effect of magnesium 
excess on metabolites of tomato plants, we performed non-targeted metabolite profiling Tomato was cultivated under three different conditions, 
ie control, high magnesium stress (MgH), and extremely high magnesium stress (MgEH), and fruits and roots were harvested In principal 
component analysis and heat map of fruit and root data, metabolite changing patterns of Mg stress showed different patterns in fruits and roots 
Tomato fruit metabolic variations by Mg stress included increases of amino acids, flavonoids and amines and decreases of organic acid, sugar and 
lysophospholipids Moreover, the highest anti-oxidant activity of tomato fruits was observed in MgEH group, which was positively correlated to the 
levels of flavonoids and amines Also, the decrease of fresh weight per fruit caused by MgEH was positively related to the variations of organic acids 
and sugars In tomato roots, MgEH decreased amino acids, organic acids and lysophospholipids Taken together, our results revealed that tomato 
fruits and roots responded differently in response to magnesium excess in terms of amino acids, which increased in fruits and decreased in roots

Stable isotope labelling and omics approaches to study the spatiotemporal regulation of diterpenoid resin acids biosynthesis 
in Norway spruce
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Monica Scognamiglio, Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology, Department of Biochemistry, Germany
CO-AUTHORS: Felix Feistel, Erica Perreca, Christian Paetz, Jonathan Gershenzon, Axel Schmidt
Many conifer species produce a complex mixture of terpenoids, known as resin, acting both as a mechanical and as a chemical barrier against 
herbivores and pathogens Although the biosynthetic pathways of the resin components are known, the way some species like Norway spruce 
(Picea abies) regulate their biosynthesis and accumulation is still not well understood, yet very important in helping elucidating resin’s biological 
and ecological significance In order to gain new insights into the spatiotemporal regulation of the biosynthesis of diterpenoid resin acids (the 
main components of resin besides monoterpenes), P abies saplings were placed in presence of 13CO2 during their growing season in an in-house 
built labelling chamber under controlled environmental conditions The 13C enrichment was monitored over time Thanks to a combination of 
metabolomics and target chemical analyses, it was possible to obtain information not only on the resin components’ biosynthesis during the year, 
but also on the associated orchestration of plant metabolism The results suggest that these compounds are synthesized and accumulated very 
early during the development of new growing tissues, while no turnover was observed in old tissues The chemical composition of the resin mixture 
is highly regulated and organ/tissue specific The identity and relative abundance of the different chemicals are very conserved in the branches, 
while they vary broadly and change over time in needles In conclusion, the used experimental approach helped us to shed light on important 
aspects of resin biosynthesis and accumulation and showed a fine tuning of both phenomena in Norway spruce

Elucidation of metabolic reprogramming that characterizes the plant growth promoting rhizobacteria priming of tomato plants
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Msizi Mhlongo, University of Johannesburg, South Africa
CO-AUTHORS: Fidele Tugizimana, Lizelle Piater, Ian Dubery
Plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are beneficial microbes found in the rhizosphere that directly or indirectly stimulate plant growth 
Some PGPR can prime plants for enhanced defense against a broad range of pathogens and insect herbivores In this study, four PGPR strains 
(Pseudomonas fluorescens N04, P koreensis N19, Paenibacillus alvei T19 and Lysinibacillus sphaericus T22) were used to induce priming in Solanum 
lycopersicum (cv Moneymaker) plants Seedlings were inoculated with an overnight culture of four PGPR strains and the different plant tissues 
(roots, stems and leaves) were harvested at 24 h and 48 h post-inoculation Metabolites were extracted with methanol and analysed by UHPLC-
MS/MS Chemometrics methods were applied to mine the data and characterize the differential metabolic profiles induced by these PGPR strains 
The results showed that the four PGPR strains induced a defence related metabolic reprogramming in tomato plants, characterized by changes in 
hydroxycinnamates, benzoates, flavonoids, amino acids and fatty acids These metabolic alterations point to a preconditioned state that renders the 
plants primed for an enhanced defense responses Thus, these results contribute to ongoing efforts in investigating and unravelling the biochemical 
processes that define the priming phenomenon

Metabolomics and Machine Learning Techniques applied to investigate beneficial Plant-Bacteria Interactions
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Lena Fragner, University of Vienna, Austria
CO-AUTHORS: Florian Schindler, Johannes Herpell, Anke Bellaire, Weimin Li, Xiaoliang Sun, Wolfram Weckwerth
Endophytic non-pathogenic colonization of plant tissue by bacteria is a well-known and wide spread phenomenon, even expected to be the case for 
all angiosperms Symbiotic plant-bacteria interactions comprise various levels of obligations and ecological benefits to at least one of the partners 
The beneficial effects and functions for plants are manifold, including enhanced stress resistance, plant growth promotion or capacity for controlling 
plant-pathogens In the present work, we focus on obligatory and constant symbioses occurring in the plant families Rubiaceae, Primulaceae and 
Dioscoreaceae Highly specialized bacterial symbionts are mainly host-specific, often not cultivable and their absence can lead to dwarf phenotypes 
of the host-plants Endophytic bacteria of leaves can be evenly distributed between the mesophyll cells or accumulated in specific leaf areas or 
in specialized structures Most studies focused on genome and proteome analyses suggesting potential alterations of secondary metabolism 
caused by the presence of beneficial symbionts However, detailed mechanisms and functions of these highly specialized mutualistic plant-bacteria 
symbioses are not yet fully understood In the present study we investigate alterations in the metabolome of colonized leaf tissue Primary and 
secondary metabolites were analyzed by GC-MS and LC-MS respectively, complemented with physiological and morphological data, and analyzed 
with machine learning techniques Results indicate distinctive mechanisms of the symbiosis in investigated beneficial plant-bacteria interactions and 
will be discussed in detail

Metabolic Profiling of Benzoxazinoids in Weed Suppressive and Early Vigour Wheat Genotypes
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Leslie Ann Weston, Charles Sturt University, Australia
CO-AUTHORS: James M. Mwendwa, Paul A. Weston, Inge Fomsgaard, William B. Brown, Jeffrey D. Weidenhamer , Leslie A. Weston
Wheat cultivar trials were conducted in moderate to low rainfall zones at Wagga Wagga and Condobolin NSW from 2014-2016 Crop and weed 
growth was monitored at tillering, vegetative, grain filling, harvest and post-harvest stages Wheat roots, shoots, rhizosphere and bulk soils were 
collected over time for metabolomic profiling and extracted in methanol using an automated Buchi high pressure extractor while soil samples were 
extracted for 24h by rotary shaker Non-targeted analysis by UPLC-ESI MS QToF (Agilent 6530) was performed and data analysed using Mass 
Profiler Professional (Agilent) Benzoxazinoids (BXs), including potent allelochemicals, were profiled using targeted analysis in negative ion mode 
while key bioactive phenoxazinones (microbially-produced APO, AAPO, AAMPO) were profiled in positive ion mode Detection of up to 20 individual 
BXs including glycosides, lactones, hydroxamic acids and related microbial metabolites were noted Both qualitative and quantitative differences 
in BXs were observed and were cultivar-, growth stage- and location-dependent Plant part and rhizosphere location (distance from root) also 
impacted BX concentration Microbially-produced metabolites with phytotoxic activity were detected at ecologically relevant concentrations in roots 
and rhizosphere soils Metabolic profiling provided critical knowledge of seasonal impacts on wheat metabolism, as well as the biosynthesis and 
release of metabolites associated with weed suppression Certain wheat cultivars, including heritage and recent commercial accessions, maintained 
high yield potential and were significantly more weed suppressive, depending on year and location, potentially due to their vigorous early growth 
habit and canopy architecture as well as the release of BXs and phenoxazinones into the rhizosphere over time

The honey bee pollen diet investigated by MS and NMR based metabolomics
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Nanna Hjort Vidkjaer, Aarhus University, Department of Agroecology, Denmark
CO-AUTHORS: Jane Ward, Per Kryger, Inge S. Fomsgaard
Declining honey bee (Apis mellifera, hereafter bees) populations are concerning because bees are important pollinators of food crops The decline 
is hypothesized to be driven by multiple factors (1), and bees face many stressors including pathogens, xenobiotics and changes in floral resources 
affecting their diet Bees consume pollen containing essential nutrients and multitudes of bioactive plant secondary metabolites (PSMs) Recent 
findings demonstrate the potential of PSMs to affect bee health eg by reducing virus loads (2), but the PSM profile of pollen is sparsely investigated 
Different floral resources are available in different environments and throughout the season, but limited knowledge exist on how such variations 
influences dietary composition In a Danish field experiment, biweekly pollen samples (hive entrance and fermented pollen stores) were collected 
from four apiaries located in different environments (agricultural, urban, forest, and meadow) Chemical profiles of the two pollen types were 
generated by direct infusion ESI-MS, NMR, and HPLC-HRMS Multivariate data analysis was subsequently used to explore seasonal and landscape 
variations in diet composition The results clearly demonstrated differences in the composition of the pollen originating from the apiaries in the 
four environments Within each environment, the pollen composition gradually changed throughout the season Collectively, the results create a 
knowledge base for future studies of dietary effects on bee health and allows for novel insight into the chemical fate of PSMs upon hive storage and 
fermentation prior to consumption 1 Goulson, D et al Science 2015, 347:1435 2 Palmer-Young, EC et al J Econ Entomol 2017, 110:1959

From Field to Feature: A global workflow for metabolic fingerprinting in grassland communities
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Susanne Marr, IPB Halle, MLU, iDiv, Germany
CO-AUTHORS: Jos Hageman, Kristian Peters, Nicole van Dam, Helge Bruelheide, Steffen Neumann
Plants, grown in fields, face an undefined number of stresses How plants respond to these factors, is often studied on the level of visible traits 
However, changing communities and seasons will also be reflected in the metabolic fingerprint of a plant Understanding those dynamics will 
help to unravel underlying mechanisms of ecosystem functions, such as herbivore resistance One primary challenge that scientists face when 
bringing together high-throughput analytical tools with broad ecological questions is the lack of standardised methods that would allow for the 
automated analyses of metabolomic data within complex experimental designs We aim to design a global workflow enabling large-scale ecological 
experiments including many diverse plant metabolomic profiles to be analysed and compared within one dataset We analysed secondary 
metabolites – well known to play key-roles in plant defence strategies – in the aboveground tissue of 13 grassland species In the Jena Experiment, 
plants were sampled from different communities, consisting of 1 to 8 different species The plants were collected at four time-points across the 
growing season to capture seasonal differences Our workflow enables the automated processing and analysis of raw data, obtained from UPLC-MS 
spectra, across all species and all treatments simultaneously We use the number and composition of features – compound-fragments defined by 
their specific mass and retention time – to describe the metabolic fingerprint The fingerprints identified each species across the different sampling 
conditions On the species level, we found different responses to plant diversity and season, indicating species-specific strategies of adaptation to 
environmental changes

Jasmonate-mediated tomato fruit growth under supplemental LED inter-lighting revealed by metabolomics
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Ivan Paponov, Research Scientist, Norway
CO-AUTHORS: Martina Paponov, Dmitry Kechasov, Michel J. Verheul
Fruit growth and the accumulation of primary compounds, which determine the final fruit quality, are driven by the supply of water, assimilates, and 
nutrients to the fruits through the phloem and xylem Consequently, both shoot and root activities contribute to fruit growth The supplemental 
LED inter-lighting can modulate both shoot and root activities; therefore, we suppose that this supplemental lighting also can modulate the relative 
growth rate of tomato fruits during the light and dark periods How the diurnal rhythm of fruit growth is affected by supplemental LED inter-lighting 
treatment and the mechanisms of its regulation are unknown and needs further investigation To address these questions, we investigated the 
diurnal response in term of fruit relative growth rate and we analyzed the metabolite composition of xylem sap Diurnal analysis of fruit growth 
showed that fruits on plants receiving LED light grew quicker during the night than did fruits of control plants This larger fruit growth during the 
night was related to an increased root pressure: the main source of night-time water and nutrient transport into the fruits LED treatment also 
increased the levels of the phytohormone jasmonate in the xylem Supplemental LED inter-lighting increased tomato fruit weight by increasing the 
total assimilates available for fruit growth and by enhancing root activity through increases in root pressure and water supply to support fruit growth 
during the night

Metabolomic responses of Oryza sativa (rice) to high humidity conditions
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Venea Dara Daygon, The University of Queensland, Australia
CO-AUTHORS: Melissa Fitzgerald
Abiotic stresses induce a cascade of metabolic responses in plants to help in adaptation and survival during unfavourable conditions In some 
cases, these changes affect the eating quality of food crops In our previous study, untargeted profiling of volatile compounds in rice has identified 
indole as a major contributor to unpleasant odour in rice grains and its production is highly affected by environmental factors To understand 
the mechanism of indole production, eight japonica rice varieties were grown in different levels of humidity during grain filling stage Targeted 
analysis of indole was performed using GC-MS in the matured rice grains and metabolite profiling of auxins and indole derivatives was performed 
using SPE UHPLC-MS on different stages of rice development We further compared the expression of candidate genes in varieties with varying 
levels of indole production In this study, we demonstrate that high moisture and humidity during the mid to late grain filling stages enhances 
indole production in susceptible varieties Indole expression in the matured grains could be a result of an alteration in the tryptophan-dependent 
biosynthesis of indole-3-acetic acid synthesis during stress conditions

Metabolomics of Brachypodium – fungal pathogen interaction
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Anna Piasecka, Institute of Plant Genetics, Polish Academy of Sciences, Poland
CO-AUTHORS: Nicolas Jedrzejczak-Rey, Paweł Bednarek
Brachypodium distachyon (Bd) is one of the model systems to study plant–pathogen interaction in grasses However, the immune function of Bd 
secondary metabolites is until now unexplored Therefore, metabolomics of Bd carries great potential to contribute to fundamental knowledge on 
plant immunity in cereal crops Untargeted LC-MS approach in combination with MZmine2, MetaboAnalyst and MarVis cheminformatic tools enabled 
us to study secondary metabolism of Bd during infection with Parastaganospora nodorum, which is economically devastating fungal pathogen 
of cereals Our analysis revealed that the number of differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) 72 hours post infection (hpi) was three times 
greater than 24 hpi Compounds from biosynthetic pathways of indoles, phenylpropanoids, terpenes and polyamines have been identified as DAMs 
among thousands of detected signals The most significant changes in metabolite accumulation were observed for serotonin and its derivatives 
For instance, dehydrodimer of serotonin was one of the most highly accumulated metabolites 48 hpi Conjugates of serotonin with p-coumaric and 
ferulic acids were also identified as DAMs In addition, tryptamine, which is a precursor of serotonin, also increased its accumulation during infection 
These results indicate a tight correlation of tryptophan and hydroxycinnamic acid metabolism with Bd immune response to fungal pathogens This 
study was supported by the National Science Centre grants: Sonata 2015/17/D/NZ9/03347 and Sonata Bis 2012/07/E/NZ2/04098

Tracking the metabolic fate of 13C-labeled plant-derived allelochemicals in the environment
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Eva Knoch, Gregor Mendel Institute of Molecular Plant Biology, Austria
CO-AUTHORS: Niklas Shandry, Maria Doppler, Christoph Bueschl, Rainer Schuhmacher, Claude Becker
Many plant species release specialized metabolites into the soil that inhibit germination, growth, or development of neighboring plants These 
substances are collectively known as allelochemicals, and the related process as allelopathy A key aspect of allelopathy is the post-release 
chemical dynamics of these compounds in soil: while some of them are converted to biologically more active forms, others are degraded and lose 
their toxicity An important factor in the turnover of allelochemicals in soil is the rhizospheric microbiome, the community of microorganisms that 
live on and around the plant roots To understand the metabolic processes that occur after release of the allelochemicals, we take a deconstructed 
approach that uses plant-derived stable-isotope-labeled allelochemicals and isolated bacterial communities 13C-labeled allelochemicals are 
produced by growing plants on 13C-glucose and purified by preparative HPLC Purified labeled and unlabeled allelochemicals are added to the 
growth media of defined bacterial communities; we then monitor their metabolic conversion and degradation products by LC-HRMS and will try to 
identify novel biotransformation products with MS/MS The product patterns will be correlated with transcriptomes from the bacterial communities 
to reveal molecular mechanisms of allelochemical turnover by soil bacteria Here we present our results to date, with focus on the workflow for 
production of 13C-labeled allelochemicals benzoxazinoids from rye and sorgoleone from sorghum 13C-enrichment and isotopologue patterns of the 
target compounds produced in seedlings have been determined by LC-HRMS We find that the benzoxazinoids are almost fully 13C-labeled, which is 
a prerequisite for the use of them in our downstream application
