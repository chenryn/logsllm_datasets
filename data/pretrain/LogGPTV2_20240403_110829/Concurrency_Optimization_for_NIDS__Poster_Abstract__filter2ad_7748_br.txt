### Metabolomics Studies

#### Overview
In this study, we investigated three key aspects:
1. The mechanisms by which parasites directly sense changing conditions outside their host.
2. The differences in the metabolomes of uninfected and infected snails.
3. The possibility that soldier trematodes release an alarm pheromone to recruit other soldiers for colony defense.

#### P-442: Novel Sources for Striga Resistance: Looking Toward the Rhizosphere
**Presenting Author:** Benjamin Thiombiano, University of Amsterdam, Netherlands  
**Co-Authors:** Dorota Kawa, Aimee Walmsley, Hanna Vahldick, Siobhan Brady, Harro Bouwmeester

**Abstract:**
Striga species are root-parasitic plants that widely infest crops such as rice, maize, sorghum, and others. *S. hermonthica* is considered the most serious parasitic weed, affecting millions of hectares globally. Strategies to combat Striga include intercropping, fertilization, and using Striga low-germinant genotypes. Recent studies suggest that the soil microbiome may also reduce Striga infestation rates. To better understand the mechanisms behind this, we evaluated the chemical composition of sorghum roots and root exudates under four different growing conditions: gamma-radiated soil with and without Striga, and non-gamma-radiated soil with and without Striga. Our results showed a significant reduction in Striga attachment in the presence of microbes. Multivariate analysis indicated that growing conditions significantly affected the chemical composition of roots and root exudates. Further statistical analyses will link these chemical compositions to Striga infestation rates to identify the mechanisms involved in the microbiome-mediated decrease in Striga infestation.

#### P-443: Metabolomics Studies of Rhizosphere Metabolites from 26 Accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana
**Presenting Author:** Kourosh Hooshmand, Aarhus University, Denmark  
**Co-Authors:** Enoch Narh Kudjordjie, Rumakanta Sapkota, Tong Shen, Oliver Fiehn, Mogens Nicolaisen, Inge S. Fomsgaard

**Abstract:**
Plants regulate and selectively choose members of the rhizosphere microbial community through the exudation of bioactive compounds, which can provide indirect resistance against biotic challenges. However, the mechanisms by which plants shape their root microbiome remain poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed the primary and secondary metabolites and lipids of 26 accessions of *Arabidopsis thaliana* using GC-TOFMS, HILIC-TripleTOF MS/MS, and reverse phase-Q Exactive HF mass spectrometry. The bacterial and fungal composition was determined using Illumina MiSeq sequencing. Carbohydrates, amino acids, and fatty acids were the main primary metabolites, while carboxylic acids, organooxygen, and benzene derivatives, along with fatty acyls, glycerophospholipids, and sphingolipids, were the predominant polar metabolites and lipids. Statistical methods will be used to identify unique chemical substrates from each *A. thaliana* accession that regulate distinct beneficial rhizosphere microbes, leading to more sustainable plant production.

#### P-444: Metabolomics to Exploit the Primed Immune System of Tomato Fruit
**Presenting Author:** Pierre Pétriacq, INRA & University of Bordeaux, France  
**Co-Authors:** Estrella Luna, Amélie Flandin, Cédric Cassan, Chloé Chevanne, Camélia Feyrouse Kadiri, Yves Gibon, Pierre Pétriacq

**Abstract:**
Tomato, a major crop, suffers substantial yield losses due to postharvest diseases, with up to 50% of the total production being affected. To address this, there is increasing interest in exploiting plant immunity through priming, which enhances defensive capacity. β-aminobutyric acid (BABA) is known to induce broad-spectrum resistance in tomato plants. We examined whether BABA treatment results in durable induced resistance in tomato fruit against *Botrytis cinerea*, *Phytophthora infestans*, and *Pseudomonas syringae*. Metabolomic analyses revealed significant changes after BABA treatment and infection, with primed responses depending on the type of infection. Our results demonstrate that metabolomics is insightful for understanding defense priming in fruit. Further experiments will identify key metabolites mediating BABA-induced priming in tomato fruit.

#### P-445: Metabolomic Responses of Tomato Fruits and Roots to Magnesium Excess
**Presenting Author:** Min Cheol Kwon, Konkuk University, South Korea  
**Co-Authors:** Eun Sung Jung, Yangmin X. Kim, Seulbi Lee, Choong Hwan Lee

**Abstract:**
Greenhouse cultivation often uses excessive fertilizers, leading to nutrient salt stress. To explore the effect of magnesium excess on tomato plants, we performed non-targeted metabolite profiling under three conditions: control, high magnesium stress (MgH), and extremely high magnesium stress (MgEH). Principal component analysis and heat maps revealed different metabolite patterns in fruits and roots. Tomato fruit metabolic variations included increases in amino acids, flavonoids, and amines, and decreases in organic acids, sugars, and lysophospholipids. The highest antioxidant activity was observed in the MgEH group, positively correlated with flavonoids and amines. Root metabolites showed a decrease in amino acids, organic acids, and lysophospholipids under MgEH. These results indicate that tomato fruits and roots respond differently to magnesium excess, with amino acids increasing in fruits and decreasing in roots.

#### P-446: Stable Isotope Labeling and Omics Approaches to Study the Spatiotemporal Regulation of Diterpenoid Resin Acids Biosynthesis in Norway Spruce
**Presenting Author:** Monica Scognamiglio, Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology, Department of Biochemistry, Germany  
**Co-Authors:** Felix Feistel, Erica Perreca, Christian Paetz, Jonathan Gershenzon, Axel Schmidt

**Abstract:**
Conifer species produce a complex mixture of terpenoids, known as resin, which acts as a mechanical and chemical barrier against herbivores and pathogens. Despite knowing the biosynthetic pathways of resin components, the spatiotemporal regulation of diterpenoid resin acids in Norway spruce (*Picea abies*) remains poorly understood. We placed *P. abies* saplings in a labeling chamber with 13CO2 to monitor 13C enrichment over time. Using metabolomics and target chemical analyses, we found that diterpenoid resin acids are synthesized and accumulated early in new tissues, with no turnover in old tissues. The resin mixture's chemical composition is highly regulated and specific to organs/tissues, with branches showing conserved composition and needles varying over time. This approach provides insights into the spatiotemporal regulation of resin biosynthesis and accumulation in Norway spruce.

#### P-447: Elucidation of Metabolic Reprogramming Characterizing the Plant Growth-Promoting Rhizobacteria Priming of Tomato Plants
**Presenting Author:** Msizi Mhlongo, University of Johannesburg, South Africa  
**Co-Authors:** Fidele Tugizimana, Lizelle Piater, Ian Dubery

**Abstract:**
Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) stimulate plant growth and can prime plants for enhanced defense against pathogens and insect herbivores. We used four PGPR strains (*Pseudomonas fluorescens* N04, *P. koreensis* N19, *Paenibacillus alvei* T19, and *Lysinibacillus sphaericus* T22) to induce priming in *Solanum lycopersicum* (cv Moneymaker) plants. Seedlings were inoculated, and tissues (roots, stems, and leaves) were harvested at 24 h and 48 h post-inoculation. Metabolites were extracted and analyzed by UHPLC-MS/MS. Chemometrics revealed that the PGPR strains induced defense-related metabolic reprogramming, characterized by changes in hydroxycinnamates, benzoates, flavonoids, amino acids, and fatty acids. These alterations point to a preconditioned state that enhances defense responses, contributing to our understanding of the biochemical processes defining the priming phenomenon.

#### P-448: Metabolomics and Machine Learning Techniques Applied to Investigate Beneficial Plant-Bacteria Interactions
**Presenting Author:** Lena Fragner, University of Vienna, Austria  
**Co-Authors:** Florian Schindler, Johannes Herpell, Anke Bellaire, Weimin Li, Xiaoliang Sun, Wolfram Weckwerth

**Abstract:**
Endophytic non-pathogenic colonization of plant tissue by bacteria is widespread, with symbiotic interactions providing various benefits, including enhanced stress resistance and plant growth promotion. We focused on obligatory and constant symbioses in the plant families Rubiaceae, Primulaceae, and Dioscoreaceae. Highly specialized bacterial symbionts are often host-specific and not cultivable, and their absence can lead to dwarf phenotypes. We analyzed the metabolome of colonized leaf tissue using GC-MS and LC-MS, complemented with physiological and morphological data, and applied machine learning techniques. Results indicate distinctive mechanisms in the symbiosis of the investigated plant-bacteria interactions, providing detailed insights into the functions of these mutualistic relationships.

#### P-449: Metabolic Profiling of Benzoxazinoids in Weed Suppressive and Early Vigour Wheat Genotypes
**Presenting Author:** Leslie Ann Weston, Charles Sturt University, Australia  
**Co-Authors:** James M. Mwendwa, Paul A. Weston, Inge Fomsgaard, William B. Brown, Jeffrey D. Weidenhamer, Leslie A. Weston

**Abstract:**
Wheat cultivar trials were conducted in moderate to low rainfall zones at Wagga Wagga and Condobolin, NSW, from 2014 to 2016. Crop and weed growth were monitored at various stages, and samples were collected for metabolomic profiling. Non-targeted analysis by UPLC-ESI MS QToF and targeted analysis of benzoxazinoids (BXs) and bioactive phenoxazinones were performed. Up to 20 individual BXs, including glycosides, lactones, hydroxamic acids, and related microbial metabolites, were detected. Qualitative and quantitative differences in BXs were observed, dependent on cultivar, growth stage, and location. Microbially-produced metabolites with phytotoxic activity were detected in roots and rhizosphere soils. Metabolic profiling provided critical knowledge of seasonal impacts on wheat metabolism and the biosynthesis and release of metabolites associated with weed suppression. Certain wheat cultivars, including heritage and recent commercial accessions, maintained high yield potential and were more weed suppressive, potentially due to vigorous early growth and the release of BXs and phenoxazinones.

#### P-450: The Honey Bee Pollen Diet Investigated by MS and NMR-Based Metabolomics
**Presenting Author:** Nanna Hjort Vidkjaer, Aarhus University, Department of Agroecology, Denmark  
**Co-Authors:** Jane Ward, Per Kryger, Inge S. Fomsgaard

**Abstract:**
Declining honey bee (*Apis mellifera*) populations are concerning due to their importance as pollinators. Multiple factors, including pathogens, xenobiotics, and changes in floral resources, contribute to this decline. Bees consume pollen containing essential nutrients and bioactive plant secondary metabolites (PSMs), which can affect bee health, e.g., by reducing virus loads. However, the PSM profile of pollen is not well-studied. In a Danish field experiment, biweekly pollen samples were collected from four apiaries in different environments (agricultural, urban, forest, and meadow). Chemical profiles were generated using direct infusion ESI-MS, NMR, and HPLC-HRMS, and multivariate data analysis was used to explore seasonal and landscape variations in diet composition. Results showed differences in pollen composition among the four environments, with gradual changes throughout the season. This study creates a knowledge base for future studies on dietary effects on bee health and provides insights into the chemical fate of PSMs during hive storage and fermentation.

#### P-451: From Field to Feature: A Global Workflow for Metabolic Fingerprinting in Grassland Communities
**Presenting Author:** Susanne Marr, IPB Halle, MLU, iDiv, Germany  
**Co-Authors:** Jos Hageman, Kristian Peters, Nicole van Dam, Helge Bruelheide, Steffen Neumann

**Abstract:**
Plants in fields face various stresses, and their responses are often studied through visible traits. However, changing communities and seasons also reflect in the metabolic fingerprint of a plant. Understanding these dynamics can help unravel underlying mechanisms of ecosystem functions, such as herbivore resistance. We designed a global workflow to enable large-scale ecological experiments, including diverse plant metabolomic profiles, to be analyzed and compared within one dataset. We analyzed secondary metabolites in the aboveground tissue of 13 grassland species, sampled from different communities consisting of 1 to 8 species, at four time points across the growing season. Our workflow enables automated processing and analysis of raw data from UPLC-MS spectra, identifying each species across sampling conditions. Species-specific responses to plant diversity and season were observed, indicating adaptive strategies to environmental changes.

#### P-452: Jasmonate-Mediated Tomato Fruit Growth Under Supplemental LED Inter-Lighting Revealed by Metabolomics
**Presenting Author:** Ivan Paponov, Research Scientist, Norway  
**Co-Authors:** Martina Paponov, Dmitry Kechasov, Michel J. Verheul

**Abstract:**
Fruit growth and quality are influenced by the supply of water, assimilates, and nutrients through the phloem and xylem. Supplemental LED inter-lighting can modulate shoot and root activities, potentially affecting the diurnal rhythm of fruit growth. We investigated the diurnal response in fruit relative growth rate and analyzed the metabolite composition of xylem sap. Diurnal analysis showed that fruits on plants receiving LED light grew faster during the night than control plants, related to increased root pressure. LED treatment also increased jasmonate levels in the xylem. Supplemental LED inter-lighting increased tomato fruit weight by enhancing the total assimilates available for fruit growth and by increasing root activity, supporting fruit growth during the night.

#### P-453: Metabolomic Responses of Oryza sativa (Rice) to High Humidity Conditions
**Presenting Author:** Venea Dara Daygon, The University of Queensland, Australia  
**Co-Authors:** Melissa Fitzgerald

**Abstract:**
Abiotic stresses induce metabolic responses in plants, sometimes affecting the eating quality of food crops. In our previous study, untargeted profiling of volatile compounds in rice identified indole as a major contributor to unpleasant odor, with its production highly affected by environmental factors. Eight japonica rice varieties were grown in different humidity levels during the grain filling stage. Targeted analysis of indole and metabolite profiling of auxins and indole derivatives were performed using GC-MS and SPE UHPLC-MS. Expression of candidate genes in varieties with varying levels of indole production was also compared. High moisture and humidity during the mid to late grain filling stages enhanced indole production in susceptible varieties. Indole expression in mature grains could result from alterations in the tryptophan-dependent biosynthesis of indole-3-acetic acid during stress conditions.

#### P-454: Metabolomics of Brachypodium – Fungal Pathogen Interaction
**Presenting Author:** Anna Piasecka, Institute of Plant Genetics, Polish Academy of Sciences, Poland  
**Co-Authors:** Nicolas Jedrzejczak-Rey, Paweł Bednarek

**Abstract:**
*Brachypodium distachyon* (Bd) is a model system for studying plant-pathogen interactions in grasses. However, the immune function of Bd secondary metabolites is unexplored. We used an untargeted LC-MS approach combined with MZmine2, MetaboAnalyst, and MarVis cheminformatic tools to study Bd secondary metabolism during infection with *Parastaganospora nodorum*, a devastating fungal pathogen of cereals. Our analysis revealed that the number of differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) 72 hours post-infection (hpi) was three times greater than 24 hpi. Compounds from biosynthetic pathways of indoles, phenylpropanoids, terpenes, and polyamines were identified as DAMs. The most significant changes were observed for serotonin and its derivatives, indicating a tight correlation between tryptophan and hydroxycinnamic acid metabolism with Bd immune response to fungal pathogens. This study was supported by the National Science Centre grants: Sonata 2015/17/D/NZ9/03347 and Sonata Bis 2012/07/E/NZ2/04098.

#### P-455: Tracking the Metabolic Fate of 13C-Labeled Plant-Derived Allelochemicals in the Environment
**Presenting Author:** Eva Knoch, Gregor Mendel Institute of Molecular Plant Biology, Austria  
**Co-Authors:** Niklas Shandry, Maria Doppler, Christoph Bueschl, Rainer Schuhmacher, Claude Becker

**Abstract:**
Many plant species release specialized metabolites into the soil, inhibiting the germination, growth, or development of neighboring plants. These substances, known as allelochemicals, play a key role in allelopathy. Post-release chemical dynamics in soil, including conversion to biologically active forms or degradation, are influenced by the rhizospheric microbiome. To understand these processes, we used 13C-labeled allelochemicals produced by growing plants on 13C-glucose and purified by preparative HPLC. Labeled and unlabeled allelochemicals were added to defined bacterial communities, and their metabolic conversion and degradation products were monitored by LC-HRMS. We aim to identify novel biotransformation products with MS/MS and correlate product patterns with transcriptomes from bacterial communities. Our results to date focus on the workflow for producing 13C-labeled benzoxazinoids from rye and sorgoleone from sorghum. 13C-enrichment and isotopologue patterns of the target compounds in seedlings have been determined, showing that benzoxazinoids are almost fully 13C-labeled, suitable for downstream applications.
