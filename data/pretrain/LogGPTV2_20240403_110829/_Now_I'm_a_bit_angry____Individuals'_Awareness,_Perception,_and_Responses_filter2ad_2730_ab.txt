### 3.2 Recruitment
We recruited participants through Prolific, an online research platform known for its demographically diverse user base, similar to Amazon Mechanical Turk [57]. The recruitment period spanned from August to October 2020. We ensured a balanced distribution of age and gender among the participants. After collecting data from the first 171 participants, we identified and corrected a storage error that had led to missing data on income and ratings for taken or intended actions. This issue is addressed in Section 5. Participants were compensated $2.50 for an average completion time of 13.37 minutes, equating to an hourly rate of $11.22.

### 3.3 Analyses
We collected data from 416 participants, excluding three who did not provide meaningful responses to open-ended questions, resulting in a final sample size of 413. Our sample size was determined based on planned analyses: Bujang et al. [11] recommend a minimum sample size of n=500 or n=100+50×#IVs for logistic regressions. For the linear regression (RQ4), G*Power suggests a sample size of n=127 to detect medium effects (f² = 0.15) with α = 0.05 and β = 0.80. With 413 participants (435 email-specific responses; 792 breach-specific responses), we met or exceeded these thresholds.

97% of participants passed our generic attention check. Of the 302 participants shown at least one breach, only 55% passed the breach-specific attention check, while 42% chose "none of these" and 3% selected a decoy option. Upon reviewing the open-ended responses from those who failed the attention check, we found their answers to be detailed and insightful. Additionally, there were no significant correlations between the performance on this attention check and participants' breach-specific responses regarding awareness (chi-squared test, χ(1) = 0.06, p = 0.8), concern level (Mann-Whitney test, W = 58395, p = 0.2), and whether they had taken action (chi-squared test, χ(1) = 0.29, p = 0.6). Therefore, we did not exclude any participants based on this attention check, as it was not a reliable exclusion criterion.

**Qualitative Analysis:**
We analyzed participants' open-ended responses using inductive coding [75]. For Questions 7, 10, 14, 16, and 18, a primary coder developed an initial codebook based on all responses. Multiple coders then iteratively refined the codebook. A second coder analyzed 20% of responses to each question to ensure high inter-rater reliability [45]. Cohen’s κ values were 0.89 (Q7), 0.73 (Q10), 0.74 (Q14), 0.81 (Q16), and 0.78 (Q18). All coding discrepancies were resolved through discussions. The codebook, including common themes, is provided in Appendix B.

**Statistical Analysis:**
We conducted regressions to identify influential factors related to breach status (RQ1), awareness (RQ3), emotional response (RQ4), and behavioral response (RQ5). We included a random-intercept for individual participants to account for repeated observations across multiple breaches. However, for models corresponding to RQ1, the random effects were close to zero and caused a boundary singularity fit, so we used single-level regressions instead. In all models, participant demographics (age, gender, education, occupational background) were treated as control variables. We reported the model output with participant demographics if it provided a significantly better fit; otherwise, we opted for the simpler model. Participants' responses on a 5-point Likert scale for concern level were treated as a continuous variable, which has limitations as discussed below.

### 3.4 Limitations
As with most surveys, our findings rely on self-reported data, which can be subject to biases. Prior research has shown a gap between self-reported behavioral intentions and actual behaviors in security contexts [34] and beyond [78]. While we do not imply that all participants would take the actions they reported, their self-reported intentions can inform future research and mechanism design to better protect consumers against data breaches.

The Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) API does not return breaches marked as sensitive, such as those involving adult sites. Accessing these breaches requires sending a confirmation message to participant-provided email addresses for ownership verification. We decided not to do this to avoid suggesting that we store their email addresses, even though we do not.

Our study focused on data breaches involving email addresses, which may not represent all types of breaches (e.g., only 4% of breaches recorded by Privacy Rights Clearinghouse [63] included email addresses). The email-focused nature of these breaches makes it challenging to track whether and how breached organizations notified affected individuals and how this impacts consumer reactions, as existing breach notification databases mostly document letter-based notifications [98]. Future research could explore breaches that expose a broader range of data types and consider organizations' handling of breaches when feasible.

Regarding our analyses, we considered several options for treating the Likert responses for concern level: ordinal, nominal, or continuous. Treating concern as ordinal would introduce square and cubic effects into the model, which are difficult to interpret and inconsistent with the scale. Treating concern as nominal would lose information about the scale's ordering and prevent comparisons across all levels. Treating concern as continuous requires a more cautious interpretation of p-values and assumes equal differences between scale items. After consulting with our university’s statistical consulting service, we followed their advice and treated concern as a continuous variable. While this approach has limitations, it allows for a more straightforward and meaningful interpretation of results, which we prioritize to make the findings more accessible.

### 4 Data Description
**Participant Profile:**
Table 1 summarizes the demographics and breach status of our 413 participants. The participants were almost evenly distributed between men and women but skewed toward being younger and more educated. 122 (30%) had a background in information technology, and 25 (6%) had a background in law.

Participants provided 435 email addresses. 421 (97%) accounts were solely owned by the participant, and ten were shared with someone else. Four were either someone else's account or a made-up address for the study and were removed from the data. Participants whose initial email address was not exposed in any breach could scan another: 393 participants (95%) scanned only one email address, 18 scanned two addresses, and only two scanned three addresses.
