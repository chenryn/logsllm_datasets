(a) Multiplications in G per user revoked
(b) Multiplications in G per permission revoked
Fig. 5: Costs of revocation in different IBE/IBS schemes, in terms of elliptic curve point multiplications in group G
In this scenario, ﬁles could be stored encrypted on the cloud
server, while ﬁle encryption keys and the access control policy
to be enforced would be managed by a process running within
an SGX enclave. To access a ﬁle, a user would negotiate an
authenticated channel (e.g., using public key cryptography) with
this trusted process/reference monitor. The reference monitor
could then check the user’s permission to access the ﬁle, and
transmit the encrypted ﬁle and its associated key to the user
using a session key that is unknown to any process outside of
the SGX enclave. This approach frees organizations from the
overheads of running their own encryption/decryption proxies,
but is not without its limitations. For instance, this approach
will not work on commonly-used, storage-only services (e.g.,
Dropbox). Further, this approach may be subject to architectural
compromises or ﬂaws (e.g., memory integrity vulnerabilities)
that cryptography-only solutions are not.
While these and other alterations to the threat model that
we consider can lead to decreased cryptographic overheads,
each incurs other costs or tradeoffs. We now consider future
research directions that may decrease the costs associated with
cryptography-only solutions to the problem of outsourcing
dynamic access controls.
B. Future Directions
Our experimentation and analysis has led to a number of
interesting directions for future work:
• Revocation. It
is unclear how to use IBE to enforce
even RBAC0 without incurring high costs associated with
revocation-based state changes. Given our use of hybrid
cryptography for efﬁciency reasons, existing schemes for
revocation or proxy re-encryption (e.g., [8], [32]) cannot
solve the problem. Developing techniques to better facilitate
these forms of revocation and efﬁcient use of hybrid
encryption is an important area of future work.
• Trust Minimization. Our construction makes use of a
reference monitor on the cloud to validate signatures prior
to ﬁle replacement or metadata update. Moving to ﬁle
versioning (e.g., based on trusted timestamping or block-
chaining) rather than ﬁle replacement may result
in a
minimization of the trust placed in this reference monitor,
but at the cost of potential conﬁdentiality loss, since old key
material may remain accessible to former role members. It
is important to better explore this tradeoff between reference
monitor trust and conﬁdentiality guarantees.
• “Wrapper” Minimization. Our construction required the
management and use of three types of metadata structures to
correctly implement RBAC0 using IBE or PKI technologies.
It would be worth exploring whether the core cryptography
used to support outsourced access controls could be enhanced
to reduce the use of trusted management code needed to
maintain these sorts of structures.
• Deployability/Usability Costs. We did not consider issues
related to the use of the cryptographic tools underlying our
constructions. Further, our simulations do not separate our
IBE- and PKI-based constructions5 on the basis of RBAC0
implementation complexity. However, it may be the case
that the maturity of tools to support the use of PKIs or the
conceptual simplicity of IBE techniques tips the scales in
one direction or the other. Developing reasonable approaches
for considering these types of tradeoffs would greatly inform
future analyses.
While this paper focused on the use of IBE/IBS and PKI
schemes to enforce RBAC0 access controls, our ﬁndings
translate in a straightforward manner to the use of other
cryptographic tools (e.g., HIBE or ABE/ABS) to implement
more complex access control policies (e.g., RBAC1 or ABAC).
We now discuss some lessons learned when considering these
richer access control models.
C. Lessons Learned for More Expressive Systems
RBAC0 and IBE were natural choices for our initial ex-
ploration of the costs associated with using cryptography to
implement dynamic access control: RBAC0 is a simple, but
widely used, access control system; roles in RBAC0 have a
natural correspondence to identities in IBE; and the use of
hybrid encryption allows us to easily share resources between
5Our PKI construction and its corresponding simulations were omitted from
this paper due to space limitations.

roles. Further, it seemed like an implementation of RBAC0
using IBE would be a jumping-off point for exploring the
use of hierarchical roles in RBAC1 via an analogous use of
HIBE. However, many of the costs that we see with our IBE
implementation of RBAC0 have analogues (or worse) in any
reasonable RBAC1 or ABAC implementation that we foresee
based on respective cryptographic operations.
We ﬁrst note that we assume that any reasonable cryp-
tographic access control system must make use of hybrid
encryption. Without hybrid encryption, we would need to
continuously apply expensive asymmetric operations to small
“blocks” of a ﬁle that is to be encrypted. Given the complexity
of IBE/ABE encryption operations, the associated overheads of
this approach would be prohibitive, even for moderately-sized
ﬁles. Additionally, depending on the security requirements of
the application (e.g., Chosen Ciphertext Attack security), even
more complicated constructions than this simple blocking will
be required. The following observations may not apply to an
access control scheme where all ﬁles are small enough to do
away with the need of hybrid-encryption. However, the use
cases for such schemes seem limited.
A seemingly natural extension of our IBE-based RBAC0
scheme to a HIBE based RBAC1 scheme exploits the fact that
the HIBE can be used to encode hierarchical relationships,
such as those that exist between roles in a RBAC1 role
hierarchy. However, the costs of this implementation proved to
be considerable. A large initial problem is that an RBAC1 role
hierarchy can be an arbitrary DAG structure, while HIBE only
supports trees. Yet, even limiting RBAC1 to role hierarchies
that form a tree structure comes with serious costs. For example,
removing non-leaf roles in the hierarchy cascades re-encryption
down to all ﬁles at descendant leaves of the role, the creation of
new roles for each descendant node, and associated rekeying.
Similarly, practical operations like moving sub-trees in the
access structure can only be achieved by breaking the operation
down into addition and deletion of roles, which comes with
the associated costs of these primitive operations. We note that
we have developed a full RBAC1 implementation using HIBE,
which attempts to minimize costs. Unfortunately, a simple
inspection of this implementation shows that it would incur
signiﬁcantly more computational expense than the RBAC0
scheme discussed herein.
Similarly, one might hope that the expressiveness of the ABE
encryption schemes would allow us to naturally implement
ABAC access control schemes. Further, there has been some ini-
tial work [58] supporting dynamic (restrictive) credentials and
revocations. However, there is still signiﬁcant work associated
with making a practical ABE implementation of ABAC, and
such schemes will still have signiﬁcant costs and meta-data to
manage (as in our IBE/RBAC0 implementation). For example,
revoking a secret-key in an KP-ABE/ABAC setting requires
the dynamic re-encryption of every ciphertext whose attributes
satisfy the policy in the revoked user’s key. Each attribute in
each ciphertext that is re-encrypted must given a new version,
and then ﬁnally all users whose keys have policies affected by
the re-versioning of the attributes must be re-issued. Further,
there are ABAC design decisions that must be informed by
the ABE scheme being implemented. For example, suppose
a single ﬁle is to be accessed by multiple policies in a CP-
ABE scheme. One can support multiple policies p1, . . . , pn
as individual public-key encryptions all encrypting the same
hybrid key, or as a single encryption supporting the disjunction
of all previous policies, p1 ∨ p2 ∨ ··· ∨ pn. The cost trade-
offs are completely dependent on the ABE scheme used for
the implementation, as the cost of ABE encryption is highly
dependent on the policy encoded into the ciphertext.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
Advanced cryptographic techniques (e.g., IBE and ABE)
are promising approaches for cryptographically enforcing rich
access controls in the cloud. While prior work has focused on
the types of policies that can be represented by these approaches,
little attention has been given to how policies may evolve
over time. In this paper, we move beyond cryptographically
representing point states in an access control system for cloud-
hosted data, and study constructions that cryptographically
enforce dynamic (role-based) access controls. We provide
evidence that, given the current state of the art, in situations
involving even a minimal amount of policy dynamism, the
cryptographic enforcement of access controls is likely to
carry prohibitive costs. Further, these costs are seemingly
ampliﬁed when enforcing richer policies (e.g., RBAC1 or
ABAC), requiring more stringent security guarantees (e.g.,
online, rather than lazy, re-encryption), or assuming more
relaxed threat models.
To conduct our analysis, we developed IBE- and PKI-based
constructions that use hybrid cryptography to enforce dynamic
RBAC0 access controls over ﬁles hosted on a third-party
cloud storage provider. In addition to proving the correctness
of our constructions, we used real-word RBAC datasets to
experimentally analyze their associated cryptographic costs.
Our ﬁndings indicate that IBE and ABE are a natural ﬁt to
this problem in instances where users, roles, and permissions
increase monotonically, but incur very high overheads—e.g.,
sometimes exceeding thousands of encryption operations to
support a single revocation—when updates and revocation
must be supported. In doing so, we have identiﬁed a number
of fruitful areas for future work that could lead to more natural
constructions for cryptographic enforcement of access control
policies in cloud environments.
