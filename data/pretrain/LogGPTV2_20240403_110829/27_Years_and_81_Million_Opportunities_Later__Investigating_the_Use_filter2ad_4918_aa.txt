Abstract—Email is one of the main communication tools and
has seen signiﬁcant adoption in the past decades. However, emails
are sent in plain text by default and allow attackers easy access.
Users can protect their emails by end-to-end encrypting them
using tools such as S/MIME or PGP.
Although PGP had already been introduced in 1991,
it is
a commonly held belief that email encryption is a niche tool
that has not seen widespread adoption to date. Previous user
studies identiﬁed ample usability issues with email encryption
such as key management and user interface challenges, which
likely contribute to the limited success of email encryption.
However, so far ground truth based on longitudinal ﬁeld data
is missing in the literature. Towards ﬁlling this gap, we measure
the use of email encryption based on 27 years of data for 37,089
users at a large university. While attending to ethical and data
privacy concerns, we were able to analyze the use of S/MIME
and PGP in 81,612,595 emails.
We found that only 5.46% of all users ever used S/MIME or
PGP. This led to 0.06% encrypted and 2.8% signed emails. Users
were more likely to use S/MIME than PGP by a factor of six.
We saw that using multiple email clients had a negative impact
on signing as well as encrypting emails and that only 3.36% of
all emails between S/MIME users who had previously exchanged
certiﬁcates were encrypted on average.
Our results imply that the adoption of email encryption is
indeed very low and that key management challenges negatively
impact even users who have set up S/MIME or PGP previously.
I. INTRODUCTION
Email is one of the major online communication tools. As
of February 2021, there are more than 4 billion email users
worldwide sending and receiving over 300 billion emails per
day [41]. While email is used for all kinds of information in-
cluding the most sensitive kinds such as trade secrets, account
credentials, and health data, regular email is not encrypted and
allows network attackers and service providers unauthorized
access. This is not for a lack of tools. Both S/MIME [14]
and PGP [46] were introduced almost 30 years ago with the
goal to provide end-to-end encryption for email. However,
in contrast to modern messaging tools such as Signal [37]
or WhatsApp [43] that implement end-to-end encryption by
default, S/MIME and PGP require a complex manual setup
by users. Consequently, previous work has shown that using
email encryption correctly and securely is challenging for
many users [20], [32], [34]–[36], [45]. They struggle with
setting up and conﬁguring encryption keys, distributing them,
managing keys on multiple devices, and revoking them. These
ﬁndings, already anticipated by Davis [12], are corroborated
by public reports of failed PGP use. For example, it took
Edward Snowden and the journalist Glenn Greenwald a few
months and serious effort to set up PGP for email in order to
communicate securely [28]. Hence, it is commonly believed
in the security community that end-to-end encrypted email
is not widely used, mostly because of lacking usability and
awareness issues identiﬁed in a multitude of user studies in
the past 22 years (cf. [11], [20]–[22], [30], [34], [36]). To the
best of our knowledge, our work is the ﬁrst scientiﬁc collection
and evaluation of ground truth on the adoption of end-to-end
email encryption. Our work is mainly motivated as follows:
Ground Truth. We aim to conﬁrm the security community’s
anecdotal knowledge about the low adoption of end-to-end
email encryption and provide ground truth based on ﬁeld data.
Our longitudinal ﬁeld data can help motivate future work to
improve the adoption of end-to-end encryption for email.
Method Extension. We extend the toolbox of the past 22
years of email encryption research that was initiated with the
seminal paper “Why Johnny Can’t Encrypt” [45] at USENIX
Security’99 that is mostly based on laboratory experiments
and self-reporting studies: In this work, we investigate a large
dataset including millions of data points of thousands of users
and years of their email data.
Validate Results from Previous Work and Investigate Un-
derexplored Challenges. We conﬁrm ﬁndings from previous
work (e.g. [1], [26], [27], [30]) obtained by other methods
including smaller-scale interviews, surveys, and controlled ex-
periments. Additionally, we also investigate further challenges
that require large scale ﬁeld data.
Motivated by the above, we make the following contribu-
tions in the course of this work:
Data Collection Pipeline. In collaboration with our data
protection ofﬁcer, university staff council, and the technical
staff of the university IT department, we developed and tested

a reproducible and privacy friendly data collection pipeline
that allows to analyze large amounts of email data with a
focus on S/MIME and PGP usage (cf. Section IV-A). The
data collection pipeline is part of our replication package.
We aim to encourage other institutions to investigate their
adoption of S/MIME and PGP to contribute to an even better
understanding of the email encryption ecosystem.
Adoption of Email Encryption at a Large University.
We provide a detailed evaluation of the adoption of email
encryption at our university in the past 27 years. In our
evaluation, we focus on the use of S/MIME and PGP for
37,089 total email accounts. Our investigation of 81,612,595
emails found that 2.8% of them were digitally signed and
0.06% were encrypted. We found that only 5.46% of our users
ever used S/MIME or PGP and that S/MIME was more widely
used than PGP. However, PGP was the more popular email
encryption tool amongst researchers.
Use of S/MIME and PGP. We provide a detailed overview of
S/MIME certiﬁcates and PGP keys in our dataset and ﬁnd that
RSA is the most widely used key algorithm, employing 2048
bits keys most often for S/MIME. PGP keys used 4096 bits
most often, although newer PGP keys used less secure 2048
bits. We ﬁnd that more than one third of all PGP keys did not
have an expiration date set making revocation unnecessarily
complicated and Deutsche Telekom to be the root CA for
64.95% of all S/MIME certiﬁcates.
User Interaction Challenges including Key Management.
We report on an investigation of user interaction challenges
that previous work identiﬁed in user studies. Most
inter-
estingly, we focus on key management
issues during key
distribution, multi device use, and key rollover. We ﬁnd that
even after exchanging public keys, only 3.36% of all emails
between S/MIME users were encrypted on average. The use
of multiple email clients had a negative impact on the amount
of signed and encrypted emails. While most S/MIME and
PGP users renewed their keys in time, 11.5% of S/MIME key
rollovers occurred after the keys’ expiration.
Overall, our results conﬁrm the pessimistic assessment of
the security community: Although our university provides all
researchers, staff, and students with free access to S/MIME
certiﬁcates, only very few make use of them and only a negli-
gible amount of emails was encrypted or signed. Our ﬁndings
also support results from previous user studies and illustrate
additional challenges. Management of email encryption keys
is hard and distributing keys, using multiple email clients, or
having to renew keys complicates matters.
The rest of the paper1 is organized as follows: In Section II
we provide information on S/MIME, PGP, and our university’s
S/MIME certiﬁcate authority. We provide an overview of
related work and contextualize our contributions in Section III.
In Section IV, we describe our methodology by providing
details for our data collection pipeline, discussing ethical and
data privacy implications of our work, illustrating limitations,
and summarizing the replication package. In Section V, we
provide detailed results of our evaluation, discuss their impli-
cations in Section VI, and conclude the paper in Section VII.
II. BACKGROUND
In this section, we provide background information on
OpenPGP, S/MIME, and the email ecosystem of our university
including its S/MIME certiﬁcate authority.
A. OpenPGP
OpenPGP2 is an encryption standard (cf. [10], [15]) which
is used for email encryption and digital signatures. PGP is
an open source project and was ﬁrst standardized in 1996.
In the ﬁrst standardization, PGP messages were added to the
text body (named: PGP Inline) of an email. Later versions
introduced a separate MIME type for PGP messages (named:
PGP MIME). Over time, new algorithms have been added,
including the Camellia and ECDSA cryptography algorithms.
PGP supports the use of key servers for public key ex-
change. Users can search these servers for keys for given
email addresses. However, keys may also be exchanged by
attaching public keys to emails. Additionally, several email
clients, like K9 on Android or Thunderbird using the Enigma
plugin, support hidden key exchange by adding public keys to
email headers. This feature has been standardized and further
developed by the open source project Autocrypt3 since 2016.
In contrast to centralised trust infrastructures known from
the web PKI or S/MIME, PGP relies on the Web of Trust
to verify identities. In the web of trust approach, users sign
each other’s key when meeting other PGP users in person.
Therefore, users can trust a new key if another trusted key
previously signed the new key, relying on a decentralized trust
chain.
B. S/MIME
Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) is
a standard to encrypt and sign emails. It was ﬁrst introduced in
1998 (RFC2311 [15]) and has constantly been improved since
then. S/MIME utilizes a Public Key Infrastructure to verify
certiﬁcates and as such has mostly been used in corporate
environments, where a certiﬁcate authority (CA) is deployed or
third party CAs are utilized to issue certiﬁcates to employees.
It has been widely supported out-of-the box without the need
for third party plugins in commercially used email clients like
Outlook 98 and higher or Thunderbird.
C. Email Ecosystem at our University
Email at our university is a centralized service. The uni-
versity’s computing center provides email accounts for all
administrative staff members, for all students as well as facul-
ties, departments, and research groups. Overall, our university
offers 90 different study subjects reaching from engineering
to humanities, and has about 30,000 students and 5,000

staff members. Faculties, departments and research groups are
organized in decentralized units, i.e. each faculty, and most
departments and research groups have their own subdomain
(e.g., sec.uni-hannover.de for the information security research
group) for their email. Users can access their email accounts
either through a web interface or dedicated email clients using
the university’s POP3, or IMAP and SMTP servers.
D. University Certiﬁcate Authority / Registration Authority
Our university is part of the public key infrastructure of the
communications network for science and research in Germany
(DFN).4 The university’s computing center provides a registra-
tion authority for the DFN CA to issue certiﬁcates for email
end-to-end encryption and signing, server authentication for
TLS, and document signing for its scientiﬁc and administrative
staff and all students (DFN-PKI).5 Certiﬁcate signing and
revocation is processed through the DFN CA.
Certiﬁcate Policies. All university employees and students
are eligible to obtain S/MIME certiﬁcates. However, certiﬁcate
use is neither ofﬁcially endorsed, nor are issuances auto-
matically triggered. Individual work groups may informally
encourage certiﬁcate use. While the CA also provides server
certiﬁcates (e.g., for TLS), our work focuses on user certiﬁ-
cates for email encryption/signing.
User Certiﬁcates. To apply for a certiﬁcate, eligible staff and
students can apply online, receive a certiﬁcate signing request,
make an appointment with the registration authority, show
up in person, present a proof of identity, and then receive
a valid certiﬁcate. This process is comparably complicated. In
contrast, creation of a student ID that can be used to access
free transport and student discounts, and is used as proof of
identity in exams, does not require in-person interaction. The
process is also not embedded in any other existing onboarding
process at the university. New certiﬁcates for the same user can
be issued without another identiﬁcation if the last identiﬁcation
is not older than 39 months.
Certiﬁcate Signing Request Process. Users can generate a
certiﬁcate signing request (CSR) for email certiﬁcates using
a web application entering their personal details and a re-
vocation pin. The web application generates a CSR, saves it
in the browser certiﬁcate store, and asks the user to enter a
passphrase which protects the CSR’s private key.
Certiﬁcate Revocation Process. The CA provides a web
interface for certiﬁcate revocation. To revoke certiﬁcates, users
have to enter their certiﬁcate’s serial number and a revocation
PIN.
