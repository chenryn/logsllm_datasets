collects IPFIX data. The dataset contains roughly 97% of links (paid peering,
settlement-free peering, and ISP-paid transit links) from all participating ISPs.
All of the links represented in the dataset are private (i.e., they do not involve
public IXP switch fabrics). The dataset consists of ﬂow-level statistics over ﬁve-
minute intervals, including: timestamp, region (as access ISPs may connect to a
partner network in multiple geographic regions), anonymized partner network,
access ISP, ingress bytes, egress bytes, and link capacity. In terms of either bytes
or packets over a period of time, each ﬁve-minute interval provides the sum of the
utilization of traﬃc ﬂows that were active during that interval. We also calculate
secondary statistics from the dataset, including: timestamp for the peak ingress
and egress hour for each day on each link in terms of usage, ingress/egress peak
hour bytes, and daily 95th and 99th percentile usage.
Performance Data: Federal Communications Commission Measuring
Broadband America (MBA). We analyze the FCC’s ongoing nationwide per-
formance measurement of broadband service in the United States [10]. The raw
data is collected from a collection of distributed measurement devices (named
Whiteboxes) placed in volunteer’s homes across all states of America and oper-
ated by SamKnows. The sample includes tiers composed by the top 80% of the
subscriber base for each ISP and is representative. Measurements are conducted
on an hourly basis. The dataset includes raw measurements of several perfor-
mance metrics, such as timestamp, unit ID, target server, round trip time, traﬃc
volume, etc. Each Whitebox also includes information pertaining to its ISP, tech-
nology, and state where it is located. We also deﬁne dates related to the status
of the pandemic response (e.g., stay-at-home orders, state of emergency declara-
tion, etc.). Based on these, we can compute more statistics for speciﬁed groups
(e.g., break into ISPs): average and standard deviation among Whiteboxes, daily
95th and 99th percentile latency/throughput.

To keep the network capacity consistent and to record eventual changes solely
based on utilization factors, we pre-process the MBA dataset with several ﬁlters.
First, we ﬁlter the non-continuous data within the dates of interest (Dec. 1st,
2019 to June, 30th 2020, and the previous year) to capture successive shifts.
Then, we eliminate the Whiteboxes which do not aggregate a statistically sig-
niﬁcant amount of data, such as some states, ISPs, and technologies with lim-
ited data (e.g., satellite). Finally, we choose the measurements from Whiteboxes
to the top 10 most targeted servers across the United States to represent the
overall US performance. We take this decision because servers with less mea-
surements will have higher variance in sample, and introduce unexpected errors
when tracked across time. These servers are sparsely located in major cities of
the US and they have the most Whiteboxes (over 200 for each ISP) connecting
with them.
IP Preﬁx Advertisements: RouteViews. To gain insight into changes in
IP address space, we parse Internet-wide BGP information globally from sev-
eral locations and backbones via RouteViews. Raw RIBs (Routing Information
Bases) ﬁles were obtained from RouteViews [22] data on a weekly basis. The
average of each Tuesday is computed to represent that week. The RIBs are then
parsed to obtain IPv4 Preﬁx-to-Autonomous System (AS) relationships, includ-
ing mappings of IP preﬁx, preﬁx length, paths of AS numbers. In Sect. 6.2, we
compute the total advertised IPv4 spaces for AS numbers associated with two
popular video conferencing applications: Zoom and Cisco WebEx [9].
4 How Did Traﬃc Demands Change?
Because most previous studies [3,12,16] focus on Europe, we begin our explo-
rations by validating whether similar traﬃc changes are observed in the United
States. We consider peak hour link utilization from the Interconnect Measure-
ment Project as a measure of traﬃc demand. We pre-process the interconnect
dataset and remove anomalous data points that are caused by failures in the

measurement system. In particular, we do not analyze dates that are greater
than two standard deviations outside of a 60-day rolling mean for each link. Due
to conﬁdentiality reasons, we present the results in aggregation for the United
States as a whole.
Figure 1 shows both the absolute utilization and the utilization normalized
against the link capacity for two anonymized ISPs. For each ISP, we plot the
value corresponding to the 99th percentile link utilization for a given day. We
observe from Fig. 1a that ISP A saw a dramatic increase in raw utilization at
roughly the same time as the initial COVID-19 lockdowns (early March 2020),
with values tapering oﬀ slightly over the summer of 2020. ISP B, on the other
hand, saw a smaller raw increase in utilization for its 99th percentile links. To
better understand whether ISP B’s smaller increase is a byproduct of diﬀerent
operating behaviors, we explore possible trends in the normalized data (Fig. 1b).
Here we see that both ISPs experienced signiﬁcant increases in utilization in
March and April 2020.
We also investigated how traﬃc patterns changed between ISP A and each of
its peers, in both the upstream and downstream directions. For this analysis, we
focused on the dates around the utilization peaks shown in Fig. 1. We compared
the peak hour download and upload rates on all of ISP A’s interconnects on
(1) January 15, 2020, and (2) April 15, 2020 (Fig. 2). In general, we see that traﬃc
patterns to peers do not vary greatly between the two dates. We do see, however,
that traﬃc volumes to (and from) some peers change signiﬁcantly—some by
several orders of magnitude. The identities of the peers are anonymous in the
dataset, but some patterns are nonetheless clear: For example, some peers show
an increase of upstream utilization by two or three orders of magnitude. Such
drastic changes may be attributable to users working from home and connecting
to services that would cause more traﬃc to traverse the peer link in the upstream
direction. We conﬁrmed these results with the operators at ISP A and report
that they observed that streaming video traﬃc decreased from 67 to 63% of the

total traﬃc, but video conferencing increased from 1% to 4% as a percentage of
overall traﬃc.
5 What Was the Eﬀect on Performance?
The surge in interconnect utilization poses a challenge for service providers, as
high utilization of interconnects can potentially introduce high delays for inter-
active traﬃc, packet loss, or both. These eﬀects can ultimately be observed
through changes in latency (and, potentially, short-term throughput). To exam-
ine whether we can observe these eﬀects, we look into the latency and throughput
reported by the Measuring Broadband America (MBA) dataset [10]. We explore
these eﬀects over the course of several years to understand whether (and how)
performance anomalies that we observe during COVID-19 lockdown diﬀer sig-
niﬁcantly from performance anomalies observed during other time periods.
5.1 How Performance Changed After Lockdown
To better understand how performance changed during the COVID-19 lockdown
in the United States, we explored how latency evolved over the course of 2020.
To establish a basis for comparison, we show the time period from late 2019
through mid-2020. The Appendix also contains a similar analysis for the 2018–
2019 time period. We compute the average latency per-Whitebox per-day, and
subsequently explore distributions across Whiteboxes for each ISP. (As discussed
in Sect. 3, we consider only Whiteboxes in ﬁxed-line ISPs for which there are an
adequate number of Whiteboxes and samples.) We use March 10th1, the average
declaration of emergency date [13], to mark the beginning of the COVID-19
pandmic phase (red shaded for ﬁgures).

Fig. 4. Latency (95th percentile) for diﬀerent ISPs.
Longitudinal Evolution of Aggregate, Average Round-Trip Latency.
Figure 3 shows a seven-day moving average of average round-trip latencies
between all Whiteboxes in this study. We observe an increase in average round-
trip latency by as much as 10%, this increase in mean latency is signiﬁcant,
corresponding to 30x standard deviation among all Whiteboxes. At the end of
April, latencies return to early 2020 levels. It is worth noting that, although this
increase in average latency is both sizable and signiﬁcant, similar deviations and
increases in latency have been observed before (see the Appendix for comparable
data from 2018–2019). Thus, although some performance eﬀects are visible dur-
ing the COVID-19 lockdown, the event and its eﬀect on network performance are
not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from other performance aberrations. Part of the rea-
son for this, we believe, may be the providers’ rapid response to adding capacity
during the ﬁrst quarter of 2020, which we explore in more detail in Sect. 6.

Fig. 5. Latency (99th percentile) for diﬀerent ISPs.
Longitudinal Evolution of Per-ISP Latencies. In addition to the overall
changes in performance, we also explored per-ISP latency and throughput eﬀects
before and during the COVID-19 lockdown period. Figures 4 and 5 show these
eﬀects, showing (respectively) the 95th and 99th percentiles of average round-trip
latency across the Whiteboxes. These results show that, overall 95th percentile
latency across most ISPs remained stable; 99th percentile latency, on the other
hand, did show some deviations from normal levels during lockdown for certain
ISPs. Notably, however, in many cases the same ISPs experienced deviations in
latency during other periods of time, as well (e.g., during the December holidays).
5.2 Throughput-Latency Relationship
High latencies can sometimes be reﬂected in achieved throughput, given the
inverse relationship between TCP throughput and round-trip latency. To explore
whether latency aberrations ultimately result in throughput eﬀects, as well as
how those eﬀects manifest at diﬀerent times of day, we explored the distribution
of latencies before COVID-19 emergency declarations (ED), after the ED but
30

before the stay-at-home order (SO). Our hypothesis was that we might see higher
latencies (and lower throughputs) during “peak hours” of the day from broad-
band access networks, with the peak hours eﬀectively expanded to the weekday
working hours, in accordance with previous descriptions of these eﬀects [5].
We explored these metrics for a baseline period predating COVID-19, the
time between state declaration of emergency and stay at home ordered [13],
after stay-at-home declarations were ordered, and two months after stay-at-home
ordered. Because these dates diﬀered across states, we used known dates for each
state [13] and matched the corresponding dates for each state against the known
location of the Whiteboxes.
Figure 11 shows the distribution throughput and latency distributions across
all Whiteboxes for four time intervals, plotted in four-hour intervals. From
Fig. 11a, it is clear that the quantiles, median, and maximum latencies all exhibit
eﬀects that correlate with these time periods, which are consistent with the
latency changes in Fig. 3.
The period between ED and SO corresponds to abrupt routing changes,
and the latency data thus reﬂects a corresponding degradation during this time
interval, perhaps at least partially due to the fact that providers cannot immedi-
ately respond after the initial emergency declaration (we discuss the timeframes
during which capacity was added to the networks in Sect. 6). As the transition
continues, SO appears to be a point in time where latency stabilizes. Figure 11b
shows that distributions of throughput measurements are more robust, although
the upper end of the distribution is clearly aﬀected, with maximum achieved
throughputs lower. The median and minimum have negligible changes during
time periods in late April suggesting (and corresponding to) aggressive capacity
augmentation, which we discuss in more detail in Sect. 6.

6 How Did Service Providers Respond?
In this section, we study how service providers responded to the changes in
traﬃc demands. We focus on the capacity changes during lockdown by inspecting
two data sources: (1) to understand how ISPs responded by adding capacity
to interconnects, we study the interconnect capacity of two large ISPs in the
United States; and (2) to understand how video service providers expanded their
network footprints in response to increasing demand, we analyze IPv4 address
space from two major video conference providers—WebEx and Zoom—and ﬁnd
that both providers substantially increased advertised IP address space.
6.1 Capacity Increases at Interconnect
We begin by exploring how ISPs responded to changing traﬃc demands by
adding network capacity at interconnect links. To do so, we use the Interconnect
