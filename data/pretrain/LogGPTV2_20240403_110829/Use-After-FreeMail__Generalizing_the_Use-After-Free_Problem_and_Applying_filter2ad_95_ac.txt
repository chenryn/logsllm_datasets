### The Exploitation Phase

The goal of the exploitation phase is to gather sensitive and security-critical information and gain access to the accounts of a potential victim, including access to their sensitive data. In use-after-free attacks, an attacker waits for an identifier holder to use an outdated resource identifier (e.g., a free email address) or triggers a potential identifier holder to do so.

Emails intended for the original owner of the free email address now reach the attacker, such as personal emails sent by someone who remembers the old email address. This highlights a fundamental problem: there is no automated way to update people's memory when a free email address is deleted or expires, making some defenses against traditional use-after-free attacks inapplicable (see Section 2.2). Additionally, account information and password reset emails will also be directed to the attacker. By using the password-reset functionality on third-party websites, the attacker can gain access to various accounts, such as social media, bank accounts, online shops, discussion boards, and video streaming services. The attacker can automate these checks for popular websites, which we found to be easier than the free-email check described in previous sections. While this may not cover all of the user's accounts, the attacker can focus on the most relevant websites.

For most websites, the password-reset functionality relies on single-factor authentication through the email address used for registration. Since this email address now points to the attacker's email account, the attacker can authenticate with any website the victim has used.

Given that this phase violates a user’s privacy and can lead to temporary or permanent loss of access to services, we only performed this step with users who volunteered for our case studies. The results are summarized in Section 7.

### Use-After-FreeMail Through Expired Domain Names

Similar to the use of free email addresses, it is possible to extend these attacks to a larger scope by targeting domain names. While the attack vector in Section 4 focuses on the user part of an email address, it is also possible to target the domain part. An attacker who re-registers a formerly used domain can reactivate all email addresses associated with that domain. Previous work has suggested using re-registered domains for spam [29, 34] and authentication [38], but they focused on taking over other domains, similar to Schlamp et al. [59]. Our work, however, focuses on authentication with third-party services.

Although the term "domain owner" is well established, a domain is not truly owned by a person or legal entity. As described by ICANN [32], the domain owner registers the rights to freely dispose of the domain, but these rights are subject to expiry after 1 to 10 years. If a domain is not renewed within 45 days (the Auto Renew Grace Period), the Redemption Grace Period begins. After another 30 days, the domain will be deleted within the next 5 days. If the domain owner does not intervene, the domain becomes publicly available for re-registration.

This scenario complies with the three use-after-free requirements as stated in Section 3.1: the server referenced by the domain is the resource in question, which can be silently exchanged after domain expiration. The domain itself is the resource identifier. Re-registration of a domain leads to the same resource identifier referencing a different resource, i.e., a different server. Subsequently, the re-registered domain can be used to receive emails intended for addresses with the corresponding domain part.

#### 5.1 Collection Phase

Unlike free email accounts, the domain registration status is relatively easy to determine. We extract unique domain names from email addresses in online database leaks. Registered and active domains, which have not expired or are still in the auto-renew grace period, are listed in the zone files of the Domain Name System (DNS) top-level domains (TLD). Each Internet registry maintains TLD zone files for the TLDs it is responsible for, allowing DNS to filter active domains. Available domains and those in the redemption grace period do not appear in the TLD zone file and remain in the attacker’s candidate list. DNS queries for these domains result in NXDOMAIN errors, leaving only the domains most likely to be available for registration.

In addition to directly available domains, there is a market for expired domains. Special online businesses register recently expired domains to sell them back to the former owner or other interested parties. These domains are technically registered but available for transfer, requiring the attacker to pay a fee to the current domain owner. Given the many separate domain marketplaces, it is challenging to get an automated list of these domains. Therefore, our experiments are limited to directly available domains.

#### 5.2 Impersonation Phase

Since the redemption grace period lasts 30 days, expired domains might not be immediately available for registration, even if indicated by DNS responses. In such cases, the attacker waits for the redemption grace period to pass. The impersonation phase involves registering the domain and providing resource information, such as an IP address as a mail exchange (MX) record. The attacker’s system is configured to accept all emails delivered to it, ensuring that emails directed to any mailbox on the domain are delivered to the attacker’s mailbox.

Depending on the former domain owner, it might also be possible to impersonate a whole company and scam users of the former website and customers of the former company. An attacker can create a counterfeit website, leading visitors to believe it is the original business. This is especially dangerous for small businesses and startups that may go out of business, leading to domain expiration. However, this paper focuses on Use-After-FreeMail attacks.

### 5.3 Exploitation Phase

The exploitation phase for domain-based attacks follows a similar procedure to that for free email accounts. However, here, the attacker can also use impersonation techniques common in domain squatting attacks. The attacker gathers sensitive and security-critical information for any user who previously existed on the impersonated domain. Personal emails, account information, and password reset emails for any user will be directed to the attacker. Using the password-reset functionality on third-party websites, the attacker can then take over control of these accounts.

Given the potential violation of privacy and loss of access to services, we only performed a quantitative (see Section 6) and non-intrusive qualitative analysis (see Section 7.3).

### 6. Quantitative Analysis

In this section, we provide a quantitative analysis of the potential impact of Use-After-FreeMail. We analyzed 607 million unique email addresses from various leaks and found that the top 10 providers accounted for 83.3% of the leaked addresses. The top 3 providers alone accounted for 51.1% of the addresses. Table 2 shows the number of leaked addresses for the most common providers.

We investigated the policies of the top providers, as shown in Table 2. Most providers allow either deletion of email addresses, typically with a deletion period, or have an expiration period for unused email addresses. The deletion period ranges from 2 days (Lycos) to 6 months (rambler.ru), while the expiration period ranges from 30 days (Lycos) to 2 years (Yandex). This variation impacts the probability that an email address has expired. Most top providers allow re-registration, enabling Use-After-FreeMail attacks.

Gmail and rambler.ru are exceptions, as they do not allow re-registration of deleted email addresses. While this provides better protection, it does not fully prevent the problem of dangling references, i.e., references to addresses that were never valid. We found a small number of Gmail addresses and a larger number of Rambler addresses that were free to register, likely due to services that did not validate email addresses. These dangling references are just as exploitable as those from account expiration.

To investigate the prevalence of this issue among different providers, we randomly selected 10,000 email addresses for each of the top 10 providers from public database leaks. We ran the fully automated collection phase on these 100,000 addresses. Our implementation could test between 7 and 546 addresses per minute, depending on the provider.

Table 3 shows the number of free email addresses we found per provider, along with the expected percentage and standard error values.
