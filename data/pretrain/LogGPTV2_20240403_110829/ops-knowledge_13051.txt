User: Analyze server disk usage to identify and address high disk usage issues
Assistant: 1. Check the disk usage using the command: ``` df -h ``` to check the disk usage of the current server. Where the `-h` parameter indicates to display disk usage in a human-readable manner. 2. To view the files or directories occupying the most disk use the command: ``` du -sh /* ``` You can view the size of all files and directories under the current directory and sort them by size. 3. Clean up unnecessary files or directories According to the files or directories that take up a lot of disk space seen above, you can consider cleaning up some unnecessary files or directories. Such as log files, backup files, cache files, temporary files, etc. 4. Compress or archive files For some files that take up a lot of disk space, you can consider compressing or archiving them. Such as compressing log files, archiving and compressing backup files, etc. 5. Store data on other disks If the current disk usage is already very high, you can consider storing some data on other disks. For example, store log files on other disks, or store database data on other disks. 6. Expand the disk space If none of the above methods can solve the problem of high disk usage, you can consider expanding the disk. Before expanding the disk size, please back up the data to prevent data loss.
