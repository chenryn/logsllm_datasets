Symfony version | 3.3.x, probably ever since there is this bridge though (so
2.7 minimum ?)  
I am currently using the Doctrine bridge on a Flex install. For some reasons,
if I add a typehint to an action in a controller (`public function
myAction(Request $request)` for example), it tries to load the
`form.type_guesser.doctrine` service, which in turn implements an interface
that is present in the Form Component.
I think that if the form component is not available, this service shouldn't be
registered, as @sstok suggested it on Slack.
