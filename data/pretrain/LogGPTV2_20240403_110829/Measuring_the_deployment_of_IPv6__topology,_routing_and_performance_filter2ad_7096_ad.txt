Figure 8: Fraction of ASes from the combined
(IPv4+IPv6) graph that are present in the IPv6
graph, classiﬁed according to business type and ge-
ographical region. Less than 10% of ECs, while 90%
of LTPs are present in the IPv6 graph.
reports claimed APNIC to run out of allocatable IPv4 ad-
dresses ﬁrst, with RIPE and ARIN soon to follow [22].
ASes unique to the IPv6 topology
We brieﬂy comment on the small set of ASes that were
present only in the IPv6 topology.
In our latest topology
snapshot from October 2011, 109 ASes were only in the IPv6
topology. Of these, 42 ASes (34 ECs, 5 STP, and 3 CAHPs)
were in the IPv4 topology in some previous snapshot (and
hence we were able to assign business types to these ASes).
Inspection of the as-names and descriptions of the other 67
ASes (as they appear in the RIR whois databases) reveals
that 27 can be trivially matched with ASes in the IPv4 topol-
ogy that have similar names and descriptions. This over-
lap hints at organizations using separate ASes to provide
IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity. Furthermore, we found that 2
ASes unique to the IPv6 topology were administered by uni-
versities that used IPv4 address space announced from the
respective national research and education networks ASes.
This shows that organizational boundaries of the entities
that manage ASes in the IPv4 and IPv6 topology do not
always align.
Common top ASes
We measure the fraction of the top-K ASes (in terms of AS
degree) from the IPv4 topology that are also top among the
top-K ASes in the IPv6 topology. As the IPv6 network ma-
tures, we expect that the top ASes from the IPv4 topology
will also appear as the top ASes in the IPv6 topology. Fig-
ure 9 shows the fraction of the top-K ASes from the IPv4
topology that are also among the top-K ASes in the IPv6
topology, for K=10, 50 and 100. This fraction has increased
from around 20% in 2003 to more than 60% currently. Until
2008, however, the top-K fraction for K=10 was signiﬁcantly
smaller than that for K=50 and K=100, indicating that the
largest ASes in the IPv4 topology were either not present
in IPv6, or were not among the largest ASes in the IPv6
topology. This diﬀerence has decreased sharply in the last
3-4 years – currently 60% of the top-10 ASes from IPv4 are
also in the top-10 for the IPv6 topology.
Common AS links
Finally, we are interested in the common set of AS links
between the IPv4 and IPv6 topologies. As mentioned in

Figure 10: Fraction of AS links from combined
(IPv4+IPv6) graph that are present in the IPv6
graph, classiﬁed according to business type of link
endpoints.
Section 2, our BGP vantage points are likely to miss some
AS links, particularly peering links lower in the hierarchy
than the Routeviews/RIPE BGP monitors. We are, how-
ever, interested in the fraction of links from the IPv4 topol-
ogy which were also seen in the IPv6 topology. The afore-
mentioned visibility issues should aﬀect both the IPv4 and
IPv6 graphs similarly, and hence our analysis should not be
impacted by missing peering links in the measured IPv4 and
IPv6 topologies. Figure 10 shows the fraction of AS links
from the combined topology that also appear in the IPv6
topology over time. We compute this fraction for all AS
links and also classify them based on the business types of
the endpoints. As with ASes, the fraction of AS links seen
in the IPv6 topology is less than 20% for the overall graph.
This fraction varies widely, however with the business type
of the AS on each end of the link. Links involving ECs are
the least represented in the IPv6 graph, while larger frac-
tions of links involving STPs, LTPs, and CAHPs are seen in
the IPv6 graph. This is again consistent with our previous
ﬁnding that the pace of IPv6 adoption is higher in the core
of the network but lags at the edge (represented by ECs).
6. EVOLVING DYNAMICS OF IPV4 AND
IPV6 INFRASTRUCTURE
Continuing to explore our hypothesis that a maturing
IPv6 network should look more like the IPv4 network, we
compare the evolution of routing dynamics in IPv4 and
IPv6.
In particular, we focus on the evolution of update
churn, correlation between the update churn seen from dif-
ferent vantage points, path exploration, and convergence
times in IPv4 and IPv6. We focus on these metrics for the
following reasons. First, we hypothesize that both IPv4 and
IPv6 should show a similar relation between update churn
and the size of the underlying topology. Second, due to busi-
ness relationships and dense interconnection among ASes,
churn becomes localized, and each vantage point does not
see the same set of routing events. Consequently, correla-
tion between update churn seen at diﬀerent vantage points
can serve as a measure of the maturity of the underlying net-
work and business relationships. Finally, previous work has
shown that end-to-end delays and loss rates are signiﬁcantly
higher during routing events [23]. It is thus useful to com-
pare the extent of path exploration and routing convergence
times during routing events. If these metrics are signiﬁcantly
worse in IPv6 as compared to IPv4, then it could deter the
adoption of IPv6.
6.1 Churn as a function of topology size and
vantage point
Interdomain routing scalability has been a topic of major
concern in recent times [24, 25] for two reasons – increas-
ing routing table size, and increasing rate of BGP updates
(churn). The latter can be a more serious concern, because
failing to process updates in a timely manner can trigger a
wide-scale instability and result in traﬃc blackholing. Some
of these concerns were put to rest by observations that churn
in the IPv4 topology grows slowly [26, 27], and at the same
rate as the underlying topology. More recently, however,
Huston [28] compared IPv4 and IPv6 BGP update time se-
ries and concluded that while IPv4 churn has grown slowly
(linear), IPv6 churn has been increasing exponentially. This
qualitative diﬀerence between the evolution of update churn
in IPv4 and IPv6 raised speculation on whether routing dy-
namics in IPv6 are fundamentally diﬀerent from those in
IPv4. In order to investigate these diﬀerences, we next com-
pare the evolution of BGP churn in IPv4 and IPv6. We
deﬁne churn as the rate of BGP updates received from a
vantage point (e.g., updates per day). This deﬁnition of
churn is consistent with previous related work in the area.
Churn as a function of topology size
To understand how churn has evolved with respect to net-
work size, we track the growth in the number of updates,
normalized by the size of the underlying AS topology. To
calculate this metric, we bin the total number of updates
per day into three-month windows, ﬁnd the median daily
churn (using the average daily churn gives similar results)
for each window, and divide it by the average number of
ASes in the topology during that time window. Figure 11
plots this metric for IPv4 (top) and IPv6 (bottom).
In IPv6 this number has remained mostly stable since Jan
2004 at ≈ 3 updates per origin AS, except at the AT&T
monitor which sees half that many. In IPv4, except for the
AT&T and NTT monitors, this metric stabilized in 2006
at ≈ 5 updates per origin AS. Other monitors that peer
