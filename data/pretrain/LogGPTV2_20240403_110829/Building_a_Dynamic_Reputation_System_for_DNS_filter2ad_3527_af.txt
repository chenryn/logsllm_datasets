## Conclusion
In this paper, we introduce Notos, a dynamic reputation system for DNS. To the best of our knowledge, Notos is the first system capable of assigning a dynamic reputation score to any domain name in a DNS query that traverses the edge of a monitored network. Notos gathers information from multiple sources, including DNS zone data, related IP addresses, BGP prefixes, AS information, and honeypot analysis, to maintain up-to-date DNS information about legitimate and malicious domain names. Using this data, Notos employs automated classification and clustering algorithms to model the network and zone behaviors of legitimate and malicious domains, and then applies these models to compute a reputation score for a (new) domain name.

Our evaluation, using real-world data from large ISP networks, demonstrates that Notos is highly accurate in identifying new malicious domains in monitored DNS query traffic, with a true positive rate of 96.8% and a false positive rate of 0.38%. Additionally, Notos can identify these malicious domains weeks or even months before they appear in public blacklists, enabling proactive security measures against cyber attacks.
