User: When using sys.argv on python -c "some code" I only get ['-c'], how can I reliably access the code being passed to -c as a string?
Assistant: The option list starts after the code (which was passed as a string literal) according to the manual:

Specify  the command to execute (see next section).
  This terminates the option list (following options are passed as arguments
  to the command).

It means that the name of the script will be replaced by -c. The
python -c "import sys; print(sys.argv)" 1 2 3
results
['-c', '1', '2', '3']
A possible solution is the usage of inspect module, for example
python3 -c "import sys; import inspect; inspect.getsource(sys.modules[__name__])"
but it causes TypeError because the __main__ module is a built-in one.
