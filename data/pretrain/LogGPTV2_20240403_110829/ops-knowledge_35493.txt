User: Why is it necessary to perform disk cleanup regularly during system operation? How to implement Disk Cleanup in Linux system?
Assistant: During the running of the system, a large number of temporary files, log files, and cache files will be generated. These files will occupy a large amount of disk space, causing the system to slow down and even disk overflow. In order to ensure the stability and performance of the system, it is necessary to perform regular disk cleaning to remove useless files, free up disk space, and avoid system problems. In the Linux system, you can use some commands to clean up the disk, for example: 1. rm command: delete files and directories. 2. find command: find files and delete them regularly. 3. du command: View disk space usage. 4. df command: Check the remaining disk space. 5. logrotate command: Rotate log files. At the same time, you can also set a scheduled task to automatically clean up the disk, reducing the workload of the system administrator.
