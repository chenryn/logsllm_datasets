I recently attempted to install Python 3.2 along with IDLE 3 on my MacBook Pro. I successfully installed Python 3.2 and can run it from the terminal. However, when I tried to install IDLE 3.2, something went wrong, and now both IDLE 2.7 and IDLE 3.2 crash immediately upon opening, displaying the message "Python quit unexpectedly." This occurs whether I open IDLE through the terminal or Finder.

I have already installed the correct ActiveTCL package and even reinstalled it, but the issue persists. I have also attempted to reinstall Python 3.2 and IDLE 3, but I am not certain if I did it correctly. After some research, I found that some people suggested it might be a path issue, but all the solutions I found were for Windows, so I'm unsure how to apply them to my Mac.

I encountered the same problem where IDLE would crash immediately after opening on my Mac. I eventually resolved the issue by updating my operating system to OS X Yosemite and installing the latest version of Python. 

The root cause of the problem was that I had modified the preferences for certain keys in IDLE. Resetting the preferences fixed the issue. To do this, I ran the following command in the terminal:

```bash
mv ~/.idlerc ~/.idlerc2
```

This command renames the `.idlerc` directory, effectively resetting IDLE's preferences. After doing this, IDLE worked without any issues.
