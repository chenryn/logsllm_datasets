User: After installing unison from /usr/ports/net/unison with X11 disabled via make config, running the command unison -repeat watch /dir/mirror/1 /dir/mirror/2
Yields the message:

Fatal error: No file monitoring helper program found

From here I decided to try using pkg to install unison-nox11 and this yields the same error message.
I've also tried copying the fsmonitor.py file from unison-2.48.3.tar.gz to /usr/bin/unison-fsmonitor and I got the following error:

Fatal error: Unexpected response 'Usage: unison-fsmonitor [options] root [path] [path]...' from the filesystem watcher (expected VERSION)

Running the command unison-fsmonitor version shows the message

unsupported platform freebsd10

Anyone have any ideas on how to fix this?
Assistant: I think the message is pretty clear: unison-fsmonitor can't be run on freebsd10 because it's not supported, so you can't use Unison with the -repeat option.
Since it's just written in Python, though, I don't see why it shouldn't be supported. Maybe message the developer.
