User: Is there any way to write a script that will tell sublime to close specific windows on quit?
I've tried setting a window's remember_open_files setting to false, and I've tried using python's atexit library to run the close window command. So far no luck
Assistant: I don't know what you mean by "specific windows" - sublime windows? sublime views? Other application windows?
You can detect window close with EventListener. There is no direct pre-quitting event, but you can use view's on_close function and check if there is any widnows in sublime.windows().
def on_close(self, view):
    if not sublime.windows():
        self.close_specific_windows()

Be aware that this function will be called for each opened view (file) in sublime.
