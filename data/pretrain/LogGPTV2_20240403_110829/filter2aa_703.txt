### Scott Wolchok: "Spying the World from Your Laptop" @ LEET

#### Overview
- **Presentation Topic:** "Spying the World from Your Laptop"
- **Event:** LEET
- **Key Points:**
  - Crawl and scrape data from The Pirate Bay (TPB)
  - Track downloads for millions of IP addresses
  - Transition to magnet links and DHT (Distributed Hash Table) for more reliable and decentralized tracking
  - Challenges and opportunities in DHT crawling for torrent downloaders

#### The Pirate Bay (TPB) and Magnet Links
- **Transition to Magnet Links:**
  - TPB added magnet links last year, replacing traditional .torrent files.
  - Magnet links use DHT to fetch data, eliminating the need for a central tracker.
  - Benefits:
    - No single point of failure ("no central tracker that can be down")
    - Reliability ("don’t need to rely on a single server")

#### BitTorrent DHT Explained
- **Traditional Tracker System:**
  - .torrent files contain a list of trackers (servers).
  - Torrent clients send "announce" requests to these trackers.
  - Trackers respond with a list of peers (other clients sharing the same file).

- **Challenges:**
  - Trackers are often taken down (e.g., due to legal action).

- **Solution: Distributed Hash Tables (DHT):**
  - A P2P network that stores key-value pairs.
  - Peers and data have 160-bit IDs (Peer ID: "random", Data ID: SHA-1 hash).
  - Peers store data with similar IDs, ensuring redundancy and reliability.

- **DHT Operations:**
  - `PING`: Check if a peer is active.
  - `STORE(key, value)`: Store a key-value pair.
  - `FIND_NODE(id)`: Return the k closest peers.
  - `FIND_VALUE(key)`: Like `FIND_NODE`, but returns the value if known.

- **Example:**
  - `magnet:?xt=urn:btih:cfa86e0e8f3831c24120b7fee7413b4da31ee748&dn=Linux+Mint+9.0+x8`
  - This magnet link directly points to the file, bypassing the need for a .torrent file.

#### Legal and Technical Considerations
- **Legal Implications:**
  - DHTs make it harder to shut down torrent sites through legal action.
  - However, DHTs also make it easier to monitor and track users.

- **DHT Types:**
  - Two main DHTs: one for Vuze and one for other clients.
  - Focus on Vuze DHT for simplicity, but Mainline DHT can also be crawled.

- **Crawling and Analysis:**
  - Reimplemented the Vuze protocol in C.
  - Used a Sybil attack to simulate 1000+ clients, capturing 90%-99% of the DHT.
  - Reference: "Defeating Vanish with Low-Cost Sybil Attacks Against Large DHTs"

- **Data Collection and Indexing:**
  - Download torrent data (filenames, sizes, peers) from DHT.
  - Import data into PostgreSQL for indexing and searching.
  - Rank results by popularity using the number of downloaders.

- **Challenges:**
  - DHT stores (SHA-1(infohash), peers) but not the infohash itself.
  - Solution: Leaked torrent descriptions from Vuze clients.

- **SQL Query Example:**
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT DISTINCT ON (hash) name, hash, size, seeders, leechers,
    ts_rank_cd(to_tsvector('english', name), query, 0) AS rank,
    COALESCE(seeders, 0) + COALESCE(leechers, 0) as myrank
    FROM torrent_descs,
    plainto_tsquery('english', %s) AS query
    WHERE to_tsvector('english', name) @@ query AND
    hash is not NULL AND
    COALESCE(seeders, 1) <> 0) AS results
    ORDER BY results.myrank DESC NULLS LAST LIMIT 100
  ```

#### Crawl and Monitoring
- **Crawl Process:**
  - Crawl 8000 nodes over 2 hours, covering ~20% of the DHT.
  - Average crawl indexed 1 million torrents.
  - The Pirate Bay: 2.8 million torrents.
  - Crawl time: 81 minutes.
  - Import and indexing: 13 minutes and 6 minutes, respectively.
  - Total time: 100 minutes.

- **Bandwidth and Coverage:**
  - More bandwidth can reduce crawl time.
  - Trade-off between time and coverage.

- **Torrent Popularity:**
  - 15.1 million peer lists.
  - 3.6 million torrent descriptions.
  - 1.5 million torrents with both peers and descriptions, mapped to 7.9 million IPs.
  - Popular content includes TV shows, movies, and other media.

- **User Behavior:**
  - Inspected manually; most content appears to be copyright-infringing.
  - Examples: "The Pacific, Part 9," "Iron Man," "Alice in Wonderland," etc.
  - Air date: May 18, Friday.

- **User Insights:**
  - User #1: All porn.
  - User #2: Mixed content including "Iron Man," "The Back-up Plan," and "Michael Jackson’s Greatest Hits."

- **Personal Experience:**
  - Even caught myself unintentionally seeding a free movie trailer.

#### Conclusion
- **DHT Crawling Capabilities:**
  - Can create search engines and monitor up to 8 million users.
  - Suing torrent sites is a distraction; they can be rebuilt quickly.
  - DHTs won't help users hide from monitoring.

- **Future Trends:**
  - Potential for DHT poisoning and more user lawsuits.
