### Analysis of Properties in Fault Tree Logic (BFL)

#### Property 1: Is an object disinfection error sufficient for the occurrence of tle?
- **Property Statement**: ∀(H4 ⇒ IWoS)
- **Analysis**: This property does not hold. There are no cases where the failure of H4 (object disinfection error) alone is sufficient to cause the failure of tle (infected worker joining the workplace). This can be visualized in Figure 4, which shows that additional conditions are required for tle to occur.

**Figure 4: (Sub)tree for property 3 (excerpt from Fig. 2).**
- **Elements**: IWoS, MoT, SH, CP/R, CP, CR, CT, VW, H1, IW, H3, IT, H2, CIO, IT, MH1, H4

#### Property 2: Are at least 2 human errors sufficient for the occurrence of tle?
- **Property Statement**: ∀(Vot≥2 (H1, ..., H5) ⇒ IWoS)
- **Analysis**: Two or more human errors (H1 to H5) are not sufficient for the occurrence of IWoS. To further investigate, we can query which minimal cut sets (mcss) require the presence of human errors: (cid:2)(MCS(IWoS) ∧ H1) ∨ ... ∨ (MCS(IWoS) ∧ H5)(cid:3). This query returns twelve mcss, which can be overwhelming. Therefore, we focus on single human errors.

**Figure 5: Tree for property 4 (excerpt from Fig. 2).**
- **Elements**: CP/R, CP, CR, CT, DT, IWoS, MoT, AT, SH, CVT, VW, H1, IW, H3, IT, H2, CIW, CIO, CIS, IW, MV, H1, IW, PP, H1, IT, MH1, IS, MH2, H1, H4, H1, H5

#### Property 3: What are all the mcss for tle that include errors in disinfecting objects?
- **Property Statement**: (cid:2)MCS(IWoS) ∧ H4 (cid:3)
- **Analysis**: By focusing on a single error, H4, we can isolate the failure causes. The mcss that include H4 are {IW, H3, IT, H1, H4, VW} and {IT, H2, H1, H4, VW}. This analysis reveals a potentially concerning mcs with multiple human errors and only two other elements needed to trigger a system-level failure: the existence of a vulnerable worker (VW) and an infected object used by the team (IT).

#### Property 4: Is any human error sufficient to prevent the occurrence of tle?
- **Property Statement**: ∃MPS(IWoS)[H1 (cid:15)→ 0, H2 (cid:15)→ 0, H3 (cid:15)→ 0, H4 (cid:15)→ 0, H5 (cid:15)→ 0, ei∈BE\{H1,...,H5} ei (cid:15)→ 1]
- **Analysis**: The path set constructed in the formula is not minimal. There are ways to prevent tle by addressing specific human errors, but including all five is not minimal. A counterexample can be constructed following pattern2, with vectors {H1} and {H2, H3}. This means that if either H1 is not committed or both H2 and H3 are not committed, tle can be prevented.

#### Property 5: What are all the minimal ways to prevent the occurrence of tle?
- **Property Statement**: (cid:2)MPS(IWoS)(cid:3)
- **Analysis**: The query returns several minimal path sets (mpss) for preventing tle:
  - {IW, IT}
  - {IW, H2}
  - {IW, H4, IS, UT}
  - {IW, H4, H5, UT}
  - {IT, PP, IS, AB, MV, UT}
  - {H3, IT}
  - {H3, H2}
  - {IT, PP, H5, AB, MV, UT}
  - {PP, H4, IS, AB, MV, UT}
  - {PP, H4, H5, AB, MV, UT}
  - {H1}
  - {VW}

  Some of these mpss do not depend on human errors, such as {VW}, {IW, H2}, {IW, IT}, and {H3, IT}. These findings can inform risk mitigation strategies, such as reducing the risk of a vulnerable worker joining the team (VW).

#### Property 6: Are a contact with an infected object and a contact with an infected surface always independent scenarios?
- **Property Statement**: IDP(CIO, CIS)
- **Analysis**: CIO (contact with an infected object) and CIS (contact with an infected surface) are not independent. Their truth values both depend on H1 (respect of outbreak procedures).

**Figure: Excerpt showing dependency between CIO and CIS.**
- **Elements**: CT, CIO, MH1, MH2, CIS, H1, H5, H4, H1, IT, IS

#### Property 7: Is physical proximity superfluous for the occurrence of tle?
- **Property Statement**: SUP(PP)
- **Analysis**: Physical proximity (PP) is not superfluous for tle. There are cases where the failure of IWoS depends on the value of PP, making it a necessary element in the fault tree.

**Figure 6: Tree for property 9 (excerpt from Fig. 2).**
- **Elements**: IWoS, CP/R, MoT, SH, CP, CR, CT, DT, AT, CVT, UT, VW, H1, IW, H3, IT, H2, CIW, IW, PP, H1

### Conclusions and Future Work

#### Conclusions
- We presented BFL, a Boolean logic for fault trees that enables the construction of complex queries to capture various scenarios. BFL is flexible and powerful, as demonstrated by its application to a COVID-19-related fault tree. Our logic can express properties and query fault trees for diverse settings and what-if situations. We also presented model checking algorithms and a counterexample generation algorithm to enhance usability.

#### Future Work
- **Probabilistic Extension**: Extend BFL to model probabilities, allowing for the computation of probabilistic dependability metrics.
- **Dynamic Gates**: Incorporate dynamic gates in fault trees, enabling the expression of temporal properties similar to LTL, CTL, TLTL, and TCTL.
- **Domain-Specific Language (DSL)**: Develop a DSL for BFL to bridge the gap between theoretical development and practical use.
- **Industrial Application**: Apply BFL to an industrial case study to gather feedback from engineers and risk managers familiar with FTA.
