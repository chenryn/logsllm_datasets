User: I am currently switching from Eclipse Java Development more and more Python scripting using PyDev. Almost all the time there is a Eclipse backgropund thread called "reindexing PythonHome..." which loads my CPU for almost 100%. Unusable to coding in there anymore :/
Do you have any idea?
Thanks a lot for your help!

Assistant: Disable 'Build Automatically' and 'Refresh Automatically' under 
Preferences->General->Workspace
Disable 'Code Analysis' entirely, or configure it to only run on save under 
Preferences->PyDev->Editor->Code Analysis
