ABSTRACT
Preﬁx hijacking has always been a big concern in the Internet. Some
events made it into the international world-news, but most of them
remain unreported or even unnoticed. The scale of the problem can
only be estimated.
The Resource Publication Infrastructure (RPKI) is an effort by
the IETF to secure the inter-domain routing system. It includes a
formally veriﬁable way of identifying who owns legitimately which
portion of the IP address space. The RPKI has been standardized
and prototype implementations are tested by Internet Service Pro-
viders (ISPs). Currently the system holds already about 2% of the
Internet routing table.
Therefore, in theory, it should be easy to detect hijacking of pre-
ﬁxes within that address space. We take an early look at BGP up-
date data and check those updates against the RPKI—in the same
way a router would do, once the system goes operational. We ﬁnd
many interesting dynamics, not all can be easily explained as hi-
jacking, but a signiﬁcant number are likely operational testing or
misconﬁgurations.

INTRODUCTION
The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) was designed with next
to no security in mind and is therefore quite vulnerable to attacks
such as preﬁx hijacks, protocol attacks, and accidental misconﬁgur-
ation [1, 2].
This lack of security made it easy to announce address space
that does belong to someone else—without the owners permission.
“Evil guys” use this to inject spam, to launch attacks, or perform
other illegal activities. Given the critical importance of the Internet,
and the widespread use of this hijacking, there has been a lot of
concern around that topic [3].
The IETF Secure Inter-Domain Routing (SIDR) working group
has taken up the task to secure the BGP routing system. It builds
upon ideas to cryptographically verify BGP update messages [2].
At ﬁrst, this must include a mechanism of certifying who owns

what address space. RPKI certiﬁcate hierarchy [4] forms a hier-
archical relationship that follows the address space allocation, e.g.,
IANA gives address space to ARIN, ARIN to ISPs, ISPs to custom-
ers. In this way Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs) can be crypto-
graphically signed and published in repositories. On the other end,
relying party tools download that information, verify and upload it
to the router. The router, now, receives BGP update messages and
is able to check them against those validated ROAs. This is called
BGP Origin Validation. If a ROA is found following a longest com-
mon preﬁx match, the preﬁx update can either be valid or invalid. It
is up to the ISP to decide about the consequences, but, the intended
meaning of invalid is that the legitimate owner did not agree to the
announcement.
In this poster, we aim at ﬁrst steps in understanding to what ex-
tent BGP hijacking actually occurs in the Internet. To achieve this
we are downloading ROAs in the same way an ISP is download-
ing from the public repositories. We then look at BGP tables and
updates from RIPE’s RRC00 [5] and RouteViews [6] collector, and
match these real-world BGP data against the validated ROA inform-
ation. We expect that the invalid messages fall into two categories:
(1) hijacks or similar illegitimate activities or (2) system testings or
misconﬁguration, including operators not understanding the RPKI
system. To our surprise it is challenging to distinguish between
those two categories.
The RPKI implements the concept of positive attestation. Con-
sequently, all legitimate origin ASes of an RPKI-enabled address
block must be included in signed ROAs. An operator may eas-
ily miss some more-speciﬁc preﬁxes from customers or additional
(e.g., sibling) ASes. An invalid BGP update, thus, is by no means
obviously a hijack and the properties of system testing or misconﬁg-
urations are hardly distinguishable from preﬁx hijacks. Currently,
up to 20% of the veriﬁable routing table are invalid, which we will
analyze in detail in the next section.

INVALID (cid:2)= INVALID?
We look at one month, April 2012, of BGP update data and try
to develop a methodology that estimates the occurence of real BGP
hijacking. On April 1st, 2012, the RRC00 table dump contained
432,864 preﬁxes of which 6,843 (1.6%) preﬁxes were valid, but
also 1,665 (0.4%) preﬁxes were invalid. We now try to understand
better what causes invalid preﬁxes. Preﬁxes are invalid, if (i) the
BGP origin AS does not comply with the ROA origin AS (20% of
all invalid cases), (ii) the announced preﬁx-length is longer than
the speciﬁed max-length in the ROA (70%), or (iii) both (10%).
RouteViews exhibit similar results.
When looking at those preﬁxes, which turned invalid because
the origin AS differed, we noticed that in over 40% of the cases
we found the valid origin AS as the ﬁrst upstream AS (second last

AS on the path). This might lead to the speculation that operators
of the upstream AS have “forgotten” to add at least some of their
customers to the RPKI system. We also noticed this number has
dropped signiﬁcantly since January 2012, which might be due to
increased training in how the RPKI works and how it secures the
routing system.
Those considerations lead us to a set of assumptions, which we
would like to understand better in order to distinguish misconﬁgur-
ations from real illegitimate activity:
Misconﬁgurations are likely to cause (a) an invalid appearing on
an AS path where the ﬁrst upstream AS is one of the covering
ROAs, (b) an invalid preﬁx that matches the ROA’s origin
AS, but is more speciﬁc compared to the maximum length
deﬁned in the ROA, or (c) an invalid announcement in which
the ROA origin does not match the BGP origin AS, but both
ASes are siblings.
Preﬁx Hijacking is indicated by (d) an invalid more-speciﬁc ap-
pearing temporarily and then disappearing again while a valid
super-block is in the table, or (e) a valid preﬁx that is tem-
porarily replaced by an invalid (at some observation points),
while the corresponding ASes are not siblings.
Two points should be noted: (1) the proposed system for BGP
origin validation is not intended to secure the routing system against
attackers, who are faking their origin AS. For this reason alone, we
do not consider BGP preﬁxes, where the origin AS is valid, but only
the max-preﬁx length criteria is invalidating the announcement. We
also believe that most of those cases are due to operators, who are
currently in the process of adding their preﬁxes into the RPKI and
have not done so for their whole network yet. (2) It should also be
mentioned that hijacking often occurs in unallocated address space.
However, unallocated address space is out of the scope of this work,
as it is not secured by the RPKI.
We now look at BGP update dynamics for the whole month of
April 2012. Figure 1 shows the number of invalid announcements
for distinct preﬁxes per day, in which we exclude misconﬁgurations.
Analyzing those in detail, only one invalid preﬁx appear as a more-
speciﬁc of a valid, and 32 invalid preﬁxes occur, which temporarily
replace an otherwise valid preﬁx (at some observation points). Fig-
ure 2 shows the duration of invalids in the table. While we would
expect real hijacking to only last in the order of hours, we noticed
that some “potential candidate preﬁxes” are still in the table for
several days. We currently believe that many of those are still very
likely operational tests and that our methodology needs further re-

ﬁnement. As a consequence this also implies, operators should be
careful before turning on real ﬁltering based on the RPKI.
The one preﬁx, which according to our methodology is most
likely to be real hijcking, was in the table for 37.8 hours. While
one preﬁx does does not sound too much, one should consider that
the RPKI covers currently only 2% of the global routing table. If
this would be a representative sample one might expect real hijack-
ing in the order of 50 events per month.
3. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK
Securing the routing system is an important task for the Internet.
Great progress has been made by the IETF SIDR working group,
and prototype implementation of the system are being tested. In
this poster we intended to look at BGP hijacking, but it turned out
that we found many other interesting properties including how ISPs
are starting to use the system. We argue that it is important to under-
stand observable properties now, to support the efforts of the RPKI.
For example, if we could detect common mistakes that operators
are likely to make, this research could lead to improved training or
to automated tools that watch-out for such misconﬁgurations.
In future work we intend to continue our investigation, and to
improve our heuristics. We also intend to validate our ﬁndings by
discussing with operators at forums such as NANOG and RIPE.
