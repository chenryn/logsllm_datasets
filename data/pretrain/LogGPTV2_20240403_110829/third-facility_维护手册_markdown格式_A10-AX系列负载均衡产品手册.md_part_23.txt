DNSSEC Configuration Commands
dnssec standalone
Description Enable the ACOS device to run DNSSEC without being a member of a GSLB controller group.
Syntax [no] standalone
Default Disabled
Mode Configuration mode
Usage GSLB is still required. The ACOS device must be configured to act as a GSLB controller, and as
an authoritative DNS server for the GSLB zone.
dnssec template
Description Configure a DNSSEC template.
Syntax [no] dnssec template template-name
This command changes the CLI to the configuration level for the specified DNSSEC template,
where the following commands are available.
Command Description
[no] algorithm Cryptographic algorithm to use for encrypting DNSSEC keys.
{RSASHA1 | RSASHA256 | RSASHA512}
The default algorithm is RSASHA256.
[no] combinations-limit num Maximum number of combinations per Resource Record Set (RRset),
where RRset is defined as all the records of a particular type for a particu-
lar domain, such as all the “quad-A” (IPv6) records for www.example.com.
You can specify 1-65535.
The default number of combinations is 31.
[no] dnskey-ttl seconds Lifetime for DNSSEC key resource records. The TTL can range from 1-
864,000 seconds.
The default is 14,400 seconds (4 hours).
[no] enable-nsec3 Enables NSEC3 support. This is disabled by default.
[no] hsm template-name Binds a Hardware Security Module (HSM) template to this DNSSEC tem-
plate.
[no] ksk keysize bits Key length for KSKs. You can specify 1024-4096 bits.
The default is 2048 bits.
[no] ksk lifetime seconds Lifetime for KSKs, 1-2147483647 seconds (about 68 years). The roll-
[rollover-time seconds] over-time specifies how long to wait before generating a standby key
to replace the current key. The rollover-time setting also can be
1-2147483647 seconds. Generally, the rollover-time setting should
be shorter than the lifetime, to allow the new key to be ready when
needed.
The default is 31536000 seconds (365 days), with rollover-time
30931200 seconds (358 days)
Document No.: 410-P2-CLI-001 - 6/17/2016 | page 218
A10 Thunder Series and AX Series—Command Line Interface Reference
DNSSEC Operational Commands
Command Description
[no] return-nsec-on-failure Returns an NSEC or NSEC3 record in response to a client request for an
invalid domain. As originally designed, DNSSEC would expose the list of
device names within a zone, allowing an attacker to gain a list of network
devices that could be used to create a map of the network.
This is enabled by default.
[no] signature-validity-period Period for which a signature will remain valid. The time can range from 5
days to 30 days.
The default is 10 days.
[no] zsk lifetime seconds Lifetime for ZSKs, 1-2147483647 seconds. The rollover-time specifies
[rollover-time seconds] how long to wait before generating a standby key to replace the current
key. The rollover-time setting also can be 1-2147483647 seconds.
Generally, the rollover-time setting should be shorter than the life-
time, to allow the new key to be ready when needed.
The default is 7776000 seconds (90 days), with rollover-time
7171200 seconds (83 days).
Default See descriptions.
Mode Global configuration mode
DNSSEC Operational Commands
This section describes the operational commands for DNSSEC and for HSM support:
• dnssec dnskey delete
• dnssec ds delete
• dnssec key-rollover

A10 Thunder Series and AX Series—Command Line Interface Reference
snmp-server SNMPv1-v2c
Description Define an SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c community. The members of the community can gain
access to the SNMP data available on this device.
Syntax [no] snmp-server SNMPv1-v2c user u1
This command changes the CLI to an SNMP community configuration mode, where the
following commands are available:
Parameter Description
community read string Define a read-only community string (1-31 charac-
ters).
oid oid-value Object ID.
This option restricts the objects that the ACOS device
returns in response to GET requests. Values are
returned only for the objects within or under the
specified OID.
remote { Restricts SNMP access to a specific remote host or
ipv4addr [/mask-length | mask] | subnet.
ipv6addr [mask] |
When you use this option, only the specified host or
DNS-remote-host
subnet can receive SNMP data from the ACOS device
}
by sending a GET request to this community.
Default The configuration does not have any default SNMP communities.
Mode Global configuration mode
Usage All SNMP communities are read-only. Read-write communities are not supported. The OID
for A10 Thunder Series and AX Series objects is 1.3.6.1.4.1.22610.
Example The following commands enable SNMP and define community string “a10community”:
ACOS(config)# snmp-server enable service
ACOS(config)# snmp-server SNMPv1-v2c user u1
ACOS(config-user:u1)# community read a10community
ACOS(config-user:u1)# remote 10.10.10.0 /24
ACOS(config-user:u1)# remote 20.20.20.0 /24
ACOS(config-user:u1)# oid 1.2.3
ACOS(config-user:u1-oid:1.2.3)# remote 30.30.30.0 /24
ACOS(config-user:u1-oid:1.2.3)# remote 40.40.40.0 /24
Hosts in 10.10.10.0 /24 and 20.20.20.0 /24 can access the entire MIB tree using the
“a10community” community string. Hosts in 30.30.30.0 /24 and 40.40.40.0 /24 can access the
MIB sub-tree 1.2.3 using the community string “a10community.”
Example The following example deletes the OID sub-tree 1.2.3:
Document No.: 410-P2-CLI-001 - 6/17/2016 | page 226
A10 Thunder Series and AX Series—Command Line Interface Reference
ACOS(config-user:u1)# no oid 1.2.3
snmp-server SNMPv3
Description Define an SNMPv3 user.
Syntax [no] snmp-server SNMPv3 user username group groupname v3 {
auth {md5 | sha} auth-password [priv {des | aes} priv-password] |
noauth
}
Parameter Description
username Specifies the SNMP user name.
groupname Specifies the group to which the SNMP user belongs.
v3 Specifies SNMP version 3.
auth {md5 | sha} Specifies the encryption method to use for user authentication.
• md5 - Uses Message Digest Algorithm 5 (MD5) encryption.
• sha - Uses Security Hash Algorithm (SHA) encryption.
auth-password Password for user authentication (8-31 characters).
priv {aes | des} Specifies the encryption method to use for user privacy.
• aes - Uses Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm.
This uses a fixed block size of 128 bits, and has a key size of
128, 192, or 256 bits. AES encryption supersedes DES encryp-
tion.
• des - Uses Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm to apply
a 56-bit key to each 64-bit block of data. This is considered
strong encryption.
priv-password Password for message encryption and privacy (8-31 characters).
noauth Does not use message encryption or privacy.
Default No SNMP users are configured by default.
Mode Configuration mode
Usage SNMPv3 enables you to configure each user with a name, authentication type with an asso-
ciated key, and privacy type with an associated key.
• Authentication (auth) is performed by using the user’s authentication key to sign the
message being sent. This can be done using either MD5 or SHA encryption; the
authentication key is generated using the specified encryption method and the speci-
fied auth-password.
• Encryption (priv) is performed by using a user’s privacy key to encrypt the data por-
tion of the message being sent. This can be done using either AES or DES encryption;
the authentication key is generated using the specified encryption method and the
specified priv-password.
page 227 | Document No.: 410-P2-CLI-001 - 6/17/2016
A10 Thunder Series and AX Series—Command Line Interface Reference
Example The following example shows how to configure an SNMP user “exampleuser”, who is a mem-
ber in “examplegroup”. Authentication using MD5 encryption for “authpassword” is config-
ured, along with message encryption using AES or “privpassword”.
ACOS(config)# snmp-server view exampleview 1.2.3 included
ACOS(config)# snmp-server group examplegroup v3 auth read exampleview
ACOS(config)# snmp-server SNMPv3 user exampleuser group examplegroup v3 auth md5 authpass-
word priv aes privpassword
snmp-server community
Description Deprecated command to configure an SNMP community string.
Use snmp-server SNMPv1-v2c.
snmp-server contact
Description Configure SNMP contact information.
Syntax [no] snmp-server contact contact-name
Replace contact-name with the SNMP contact; for example, an E-mail address.
Default Empty string
Mode Configuration mode
Usage The no form removes the contact information.
By default, the SNMP sysContact OID value is synchronized among all member ACOS devices
of an aVCS virtual chassis. You can disable this synchronization, on an individual device basis.
NOTE: After configuring this option for an ACOS device, if you disable aVCS on that device,
the running-config is automatically updated to continue using the same sysCon-
tact value you specified for the device. You do not need to reconfigure the sysCon-
tact on the device after disabling aVCS.
Example The following command defines the SNMP contact with the E-mail address “exampleu-
PI:EMAIL”:
ACOS(config)#snmp-server contact PI:EMAIL
snmp-server enable
Description Enable the ACOS device to accept SNMP MIB data queries and to send SNMP v1/v2c traps.
To use SNMP on the device, you must enter this command. Enter this command first, then
