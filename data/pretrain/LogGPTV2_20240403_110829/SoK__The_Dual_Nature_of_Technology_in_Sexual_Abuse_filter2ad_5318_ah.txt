APPENDIX A
CODEBOOK
The tables in this appendix show various sub-themes that emerged during our coding process. We grouped and renamed
similar subthemes. The grouped themes are presented in Sections IV & V.
Theme
1. How
technology
facilitates
sexual
abuse
Subthemes
The anonymity of
technology
The malleability
of technology
Lack of
well-deﬁned
boundaries
Networking
Monitoring
victims
Deﬁnitions
Perpetrators hide under
the cover of anonymity
and use technology for
purposes other than
intended
The use of technology to
suit whatever
perpetrators want it to be
No physical limit to the
perpetrator’s reach
Perpetrators using
technology to network
with other perpetrators
and form stronger bonds
The use of technology to
monitor the activities of
victims
The friends nature
of technology
The use of technology to
facilitate friendship
between the perpetrator
and the potential victim
The opaqueness of
technology
Technology is not
transparent
Forgery of identity
Perpetrators changing
their identity using
technology
The ever-changing
nature of
technology
Perpetrators using the
evolving nature of
technology against
victims
Examples
“Recent technological advances also enable offenders to disguise
their identities and prevent the source of their communications from
being discovered by law enforcement. The use of cryptography,
stenography and anonymising protocols make the task of tracking
communications difﬁcult for police and regulators alike” [123].
“Technologies developed to detect surveillance ... may have the
potential to be abused by those attempting to evade surveillance by
law enforcement, much in the same way that many existing privacy
and security technologies can be abused by criminals to hinder
investigations” [203].
“Participants felt that the ﬂuidity between online and off-line social
spheres was a core feature of young people’s lives. Speciﬁcally,
participants identiﬁed: the centrality of online sociality to young
people’s interactions; — the blurring between online and off-line
domains” [91].
“The Internet may make it easier for CSEC (Cybersecurity)
offenders to make connections with other offenders, for example,
networking among pimps” [115].
“Computer monitoring software can track and record every keystroke
a person makes on a computer. Location tracking devices, such as
GPS, can track victims’ daily movements and their real-time
location. Hidden cameras and audio bugs have become much smaller
and more affordable so it is easier ... to install surveillance devices
inside a victim’s home, car, or workplace” [77].
“After a potential victim has been identiﬁed, the offender will
attempt to initiate a conversation or relationship through email, chat,
Instant Messaging (IM) or friend requests on social networking sites.
The friendship and relationship forming stages are similar to those of
the development of other online friendships, and involve the offender
approaching and befriending the young person, and encouraging
them to discuss their life in order to initiate friendship” [105].
“The blackbox nature of technology was seen as a problematic
factor. Participants were concerned with their own lack of
knowledge regarding the data that their own devices collect and with
whom this data may be shared” [51].
“This case identiﬁes an additional method of facilitation afforded by
new technologies, namely the ability of the perpetrator to create a
false representation of themselves to deceive potential victims. The
advantage for offenders of this behavior is that initial and continued
engagement is more likely in circumstances where the perpetrator is
able to misrepresent themselves as a desirable entity” [91].
“Offenders can use technology to adapt their offending behavior.
Consequentially, the constant and continual evolution in technology
has ramiﬁcations with regard to the facilitation of child sexual abuse
and the impact that they have on the prevention of child sexual
abuse” [103].

Distribution of
unauthorised
materials
The use of technology
for the distribution of
unauthorized sexual
images where sexual
abuse has occurred
Publicly available
information
through
technology
The
reproducibility or
irreversibility of
technology
Initiating meetings
between the
perpetrator and the
victim
Accessibility and
indispensability of
technology
Misuse of
legitimate tools
The use of technology to
view and gather publicly
available information
that is used against
victims
The reproducibility of
technology aiding sexual
abuse
The use of technology to
initiate a meeting
between the victim and
the perpetrator
Technology is easily
accessible and
indispensable making it
easy to misuse
Technology allows
legitimate tools to be
used in illegitimate ways
“In particular, rather than viewing the use of emerging ICTs
(Information and Communications Technology) as representing an
extension on video voyeurism or indeed as a driver of sexual
violence, it is argued that this issue must be considered in light of a
continuum of sexual violence. This is not to undermine the
importance of securing justice and support for victims regarding the
original sexual abuse, but rather emphasises the continued abuse on
the victim where an image is recorded and distributed” [138].
“In addition to using technology to monitor and track victims ...
using the Internet to gather information about their victims, post
damaging information about victims, and even impersonate
victims” [77].
“Two of the affordances that social media platforms such as Twitter
offer are (a) the ability to share content in live time and (b) the
ability to screenshot and capture content that then remains as a
digital image, even after the original content is deleted” [148].
“The use of social networking sites to invite women to meet in the
physical domain—police have described how sites may be ﬂooded
with invitations from an individual, increasing their chances of a
meeting, then the woman is sexually abused, and multiple
perpetrators may be involved” [91].
“How technology is used in intimate terrorism. Social Media is now
a ubiquitous technology that connects people virtually” [50].
“Our data also revealed how abusers often leverage what we term
dual-use applications to spy on victims. Unlike software that is
clearly designed and marketed to be spyware, dual-use applications
are designed for legitimate purposes, such as anti-theft tracking
apps, ‘Find My Friends’ emergency response apps, parental control
apps, and others” [55].
