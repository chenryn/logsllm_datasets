User: I need to validate phone numbers and there is a very good python library that will do this. My stack however is Go and I'm really not looking forward to porting a very large library. Do you think it would be better to use the python library by running a shell command from within the Go codebase or by running a daemon that I then have to communicate with somehow?
Assistant: Python, being an interpreted language, requires the system to load the interpreter each time a script is run from the command line. Also
On my particular system, after disk caching, it takes the system 20ms to execute a script with import string (which is plausible for your use case). If you're processing a lot information, and can't submit it all at once, you should consider setting up a daemon to avoid this kind of overhead.
On the other hand, a daemon is more complex to write and test, so you should probably see if a script suits your needs before optimizing prematurely.
There's no answer to your question that fits every possible case. Ultimately, you always have to try the performance with your data and in your system,
