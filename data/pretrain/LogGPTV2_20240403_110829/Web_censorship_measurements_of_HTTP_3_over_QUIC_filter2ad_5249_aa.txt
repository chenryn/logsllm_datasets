ABSTRACT
Web traffic censorship limits the free access to information, mak-
ing it a global human rights issue. The introduction of HTTP/3
(HTTP over QUIC) yields promising expectations to counteract
such interference, due to its novelty, build-in encryption, and faster
connection establishment. To evaluate this hypothesis and analyze
the current state of HTTP/3 blocking, we extended the open-source
censorship measurement-tool OONI with an HTTP/3 module. Using
an input list of possibly-blocked websites, real-world measurements
with HTTPS and HTTP/3 were conducted in selected Autonomous
Systems in China, Iran, India, and Kazakhstan. The presented eval-
uation assesses the different blocking methodologies employed for
TCP/TLS versus the ones employed for QUIC. The results reveal
dedicated UDP blocking in Iran and major IP blocklisting affecting
QUIC in China and India.

1 INTRODUCTION
Internet censorship interferes with accessing selected resources
and information on the Internet. In several countries, governmental
censors frequently limit the access to social networks and block
specific websites. This is enforced via firewalls, on-path, and off-
path middle boxes. In the media and in the literature, the most
prominent case of such interference is certainly the "Great Firewall"
of China [6]. But, Iran [1, 4], India [19], and countries of the Former
Soviet Union [17, 20] have also frequently been studied.
Over the last years, the widespread usage of HTTPS shifted cen-
sorship techniques towards interfering with TLS. The problem of
measuring TLS handshake blocking based on the content of the
Server Name Indication field in the Client Hello has been widely
studied by many [19, 22]. In early 2021, a new version of the HTTP
protocol, HTTP/3, was announced. HTTP/3 uses QUIC as the un-
derlying encrypted transport. In contrast to traditional HTTPS
over TCP, QUIC uses UDP and is implemented in user-space. QUIC

provides always-on, built-in encryption and reduce connection
setup time [12]. Considerations in the literature assume that QUIC
connections inherit a lower vulnerability to tampering and modifi-
cation by middle boxes [9, 13]. Yet, to our best knowledge, this has
not been empirically evaluated before.
We aim to test these expectations and provide a first survey
of the current state of HTTP/3 (and QUIC) blocking. To this end,
we integrated a QUIC module in the Open Observatory of Net-
work Interference (OONI) Probe software [8]. Then, we conducted
real-world side-by-side HTTPS and HTTP/3 measurements. We
measured selected likely-blocked URLs in Autonomous Systems
suspected of network interference in China, Iran, India, and Kaza-
khstan.
Our main findings are the following. In China and India, IP
blocking affects HTTPS and HTTP/3 traffic alike. In Iran, we no-
ticed the application of different blocking methods for HTTPS and
HTTP/3: HTTPS traffic is mainly filtered based on the SNI, HTTP/3
is impaired by UDP endpoint blocking.
2 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
Gaining knowledge through measurements is key to the under-
standing of censorship systems. Publishing the results openly raises
public awareness and increases pressure on censoring governments
and ISPs. While censors could misuse our findings, we believe
that raising public awareness outweighs potential drawbacks. This
stance is in line with OONI’s mission of increasing transparency of
Internet censorship. Due to the political nature of the subject and
risks involved, the conduct of censorship measurements should be
closely accompanied by ethical considerations. First and foremost,
the safety of the volunteers has to be ensured. Some participants
live in countries with strict internet regulations, e.g., Iran, and risk
legal persecution. Thus, all participants volunteered freely and were
clearly informed about the risks. Yet, we still excluded certain cat-
egories of websites to avoid raising any flags. Websites from the
following categories are removed from the set of test domains: Sex
Education, Pornography, Dating, Religion and LGBTQ+.
3 BACKGROUND & RELATED WORK
The following section presents the necessary background informa-
tion and summarizes the related work.
3.1 HTTP/3 over QUIC
QUIC [11] is a connection-oriented, general purpose protocol, which
integrates transport layer functionality with built-in encryption
on top of UDP. The protocol is implemented in user-space [12],
shifting the connection management to the encrypted application

layer. These characteristics make QUIC a long awaited alternative
to traditional TCP, especially for web browsing. Thus, the next
major version of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, HTTP/3 [3], uses
QUIC as its underlying transport protocol.
3.2 Web Traffic Censorship & Error Types
This paper focuses on Internet censorship in the form of website
access blocking. Website blocking methods can be split into two
categories: identification and interference (c.f., [9]): While identifi-
cation refers to the way the censor detects that traffic is directed
towards a blocklisted website, interference is the method of block-
ing or impairing such traffic.
Website censorship appears in the form of network errors, where
the specific type of error triggered, depends on the applied blocking
method. Censors can identify traffic flows by their header fields
on the IP or transport layer, e.g., destination IP or port number.
IP-based identification and filtering potentially causes collateral
damage because multiple services can be hosted at the same IP
address. Even more information can be revealed by Deep Packet
Inspection, which filters application layer packets based on key-
words in their unencrypted parts, like plain HTTP payloads, or TLS
extensions, e.g., Server Name Indication (SNI). To determine the
censor’s identification method, a common technique in censorship
measurements is to identify the last successful connection establish-
ment step. For example, it is possible to check if the failure occurs
during routing or later in the TLS handshake.
Common interference methods range from DNS manipulation,
over out-of-band attacks against the connection, to middle boxes
dropping unwanted packets (black holing). Connection reset errors
occur, when the connection was terminated due to an injected reset
packet from an outside attacker [9]. A timeout failure at one of the
endpoints can be a sign for black holing, but it can also be caused by
various other types of network malfunctions. By regularly repeating
measurements and observing the outcome over a longer period of
time it is possible to recognize censorship patterns and decrease
the bias caused by temporary network disturbances unrelated to
censorship. In this work, we focus only on the most common error
types and their relevance for censorship, denoted by the following
abbreviations:
TCP handshake timeout
TLS handshake timeout
TCP-hs-to
TLS-hs-to
QUIC-hs-to QUIC handshake timeout
conn-reset
route-err
connection reset during TLS handshake
IP routing error
We will discuss in Section 5.1 and 5.2, how these error types are
associated with certain censorship methods.
3.3 Open Observatory of Network Interference
(OONI)
The community-based Open Observatory of Network Interference
(OONI) [8] project develops open source client software for decen-
tralized evaluation of Internet censorship. OONI’s measurement
tool (OONI Probe) contains multiple tests to identify several internet
censorship techniques, e.g., DNS manipulation, IP and TCP end-
point blocking. Connection timeouts can be identified as well as
connection termination due to injected reset packets. Participating
end users deploy the software on their local machines and conduct
the measurements in their respective networks. The so collected
data covers over 200 countries, including all 22 countries considered
not free by the 2020 Freedom on the Net report [5]. Prior to our work,
only HTTP/2 measurements could be conducted. To also evaluate
network interference with HTTP/3, we extended the OONI Probe
software with a dedicated HTTP/3 module.
3.4 Related Publications
Currently, two IETF drafts refer to QUIC in the context of censor-
ship. The QUIC Human Rights Review [13] underlines the build-in
encryption of QUIC to protect against deep packet inspection. The
same draft also discusses the improved robustness against connec-
tion reset attacks, which is also taken up by an IETF censorship
survey [9]. Such reset attacks rely on out-of-band interference,
where the censor can inspect copies of packets, instead of drop-
ping them as they arrive. According to [13] and [9], QUIC is better
protected against this vulnerability, because established QUIC con-
nections can not be easily terminated by an outsider. A censor
would have to keep up inline blocking of QUIC connections, which
is very resource exhausting.
Apart from IETF working groups, there currently is very little
published research dealing with QUIC in the context of censor-
ship. Kyle Hogan [10] explores the potential of running Tor over
QUIC, focusing on the potential performance gain due to the mul-
tiplexing property. Zhan et al. (2021), from the Chinese Academy
of Sciences, test the vulnerability of QUIC traffic in regard to web-
site fingerprinting based on machine learning models [23]. They
suggest that pattern recognition of QUIC traffic features is feasible
under well-designed conditions. Alongside OONI, there are sev-
eral measurement platforms dedicated to observing and collecting
information about internet censorship. These platforms differ in
approach and methodology. At this point however, none of them
supports QUIC based protocols, i.e. HTTP/3 or DNS-over-QUIC.
ICLab [15] is a censorship observation tool with a measuring ap-
proach and structure which is similar to the OONI probing software.
The open source project has a vantage point infrastructure, which
mainly consists of VPN clients and VPSs, as well as embedded sys-
tems. CensoredPlanet [21] is a more recent project that follows a
different measurement methodology. Instead of implementing a de-
centralized approach as ICLab, CensoredPlanet focuses on remote
measurement techniques, which can detect connection blocking
without controlling either end point. This remote technique exploits
TCP/IP side channels by performing a type of reflection attack. The
remote measuring approach has the clear advantage of allowing
significantly increased coverage. At this point they have around
95,000 vantage points in total. Measurements can be run and repli-
cated without relying on volunteer experiments. It has to be noted,
that the technique requires careful ethical considerations. Since
the technique exploits side channels, the results are not as specific
as traditional measurements. Also, the owners of the examined
machines have no knowledge about their participation and could
become targeted by the censors.

4 MEASUREMENT FRAMEWORK
The following section describes the measurement framework, the
target host list used to create the data set, and the data collection
process itself.
4.1 HTTP/3 Extension for OONI Probe
The QUIC censorship measurement software was implemented
as part of the OONI Probe engine [16], which is written in Go. It
consists of a censorship measurement library and a command line
interface to conduct multiple networking experiments. Our new
QUIC extension can be used in any of the existing OONI network
experiments.
To measure website blocking, as done in this work, we configure
the existing URLGetter experiment to automatically use the QUIC
code. At runtime, we perform a set of preconfigured steps for each
entry of the URL test list:
• We parse the URL template to determine next steps.
• We resolve the IP address of the domain name, using either
the configured custom resolver or the default system re-
solver. This step can be replaced by providing a pre-resolved
IP address for an input URL, which we have done for the
measurements of this work.
• We establish a connection to the host over the configured
transport protocol, and try to fetch the resource over HTTP.
• We capture, classify and save any occurring network events
or thrown errors during the connection setup, the crypto-
graphic handshake, or the HTTP session.
For the QUIC implementation, we integrated the open source library
quic-go1, because it is also written in Go and has been successfully
used for QUIC research before [7, 14, 18].
4.2 Vantage Points
The data set was collected by using three different types of clients:
Personal Devices of volunteers (PD), Virtual Private Networks
(VPNs), and Virtual Private Servers (VPSs).
Personal devices (PD): With the help of OONI volunteers in Iran
and India, data was collected on devices from ISPs in AS48147,
AS38266 and AS55836. While such data most closely resembles the
real conditions in the probed countries, each measurement must be
conducted manually by the respective volunteer. Thus, sample size,
frequency, and continuity of the data is low. Also, PD measurements
invoke risks to the volunteers. Thus, we extended the data set by
using remotely controlled VPN and VPS measurements.
Virtual Private Networks (VPNs): Using a VPN, the measure-
ment software can be run on a machine outside the probed network
without the need for local volunteers. For measurements in Turkey,
Kazakhstan, Russia, and Malaysia, the use of OpenVPN services was
considered. However, early measurements showed that the tested
VPN servers located in Turkey, Russia, and Malaysia were notably
less censored than expected from prior OONI measurements2 and
the Freedom on the Net ranking [5]. This phenomenon is likely
caused by one of the following two reasons. First, we observed that
most VPN servers are connected to a hosting network, and not to
1https://github.com/lucas-clemente/quic-go

278
the common local ISP network. Since hosting networks are not
used by the general public, it is possible that they are not obligated
to implement the same strict censorship policies. The second ex-
planations is that the upstream AS of the VPN is often located in
a country with less internet restrictions. In such a scenario, the
traffic might never cross a severely censored network in the coun-
try of the respective VPN server. To avoid such bias, we did not
further conduct measurements in Turkey, Malaysia, and Russia.
However, in Kazakhstan, an available VPN server is located in the
network of the largest national ISP, KazakhTelecom (AS9198). Since
the upstream network of the VPN server’s network also belongs to
KazakhTelecom, the server can be used as a measurement point for
Kazakh internet censorship.
