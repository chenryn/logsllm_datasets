## Expected Behavior
This should work:
    // in pages/index.js
    import { Layout } from 'layout'
    export default () => 
    // in layout/index.js
    export { default as Layout } from './Layout'
## Current Behavior
    export { default as Layout } from './Layout'
    ^^^^^^
    SyntaxError: Unexpected token export
## Steps to Reproduce
  1. Create a new next app.
  2. Add a custom server.js.
  3. Create a component outside of the pages directory.
  4. Import that component from within pages/index.js.
  5. `yarn dev`
