IP blocks, we get only a few IP addresses that answer our probes, typically only one.
5 Comparison Between Databases and Active Measurements
Having discussed the geographic resolution of geolocation databases in Section 3 and
presented the conﬁdence area obtained with active measurements in Section 4, we use
the active measurements introduced in Section 4 to check the resolution of geolocation
databases. When comparing geolocation based on active measurements and databases,
several situations may occur. One possibility is when databases and active measure-
ments give the same location for an IP address, i.e. databases give a location that lies
within the conﬁdence region given by active measurements. This situation is not typi-
cal, given the coarse geographic resolution of database records. When location estimates
from the databases do not belong to the conﬁdence region provided by active measure-
ments, we would tend to doubt the accuracy of databases rather than expecting that the
conﬁdence region suffers from measurements biases, as the conﬁdence region is made
from higher bounds on the distance constraints.
Let us now measure the distance between the border of the conﬁdence region given
by CBG and the location estimates of the databases. If CBG is correct in its estimation
of the location, then this distance should provide a lower bound on the actual geolo-
cation error made by the database. Figure 3 shows the cumulative distribution of the
minimal distance between the location estimates of the Maxmind dataset (results for
Hexasoft are similar) and the border of the conﬁdence region given by CBG, with and
without using bandwidth estimation. This minimal distance ﬁrst tells whether the loca-
tion estimates from databases are within the conﬁdence region or not. If the distance
is negative on Figure 3, it means that databases are within the conﬁdence region. If
the conﬁdence region is small and the location estimate of the database lies within the
conﬁdence region, then we expect that it is likely that the database estimate is correct.
We observe on Figure 3 that more than 90% of the probed IP addresses have a database
location estimate that lies outside the conﬁdence region, and quite far away from it.
Note that in a few cases the distance on Figure 3 is negative and large, meaning that the
conﬁdence region is pretty large.

Ratio between Maxmind and CBG locations
Fig. 4. Ratio of the distance of the databases to the distance of CBG with respect to the CBG
location estimate (Maxmind dataset)
The large distances shown in Figure 3 suggest that the geographic resolution of
databases is poor, compared to the conﬁdence region given by CBG. To quantify the rel-
ative resolution of databases compared to the conﬁdence region given by CBG, we plot
in Figure 4 the ratio of the difference between the CBG estimate and the locations given
by the Maxmind dataset (results for Hexasoft are similar), divided by the uncertainty in
the CBG estimate (radius of the conﬁdence region). Let us denote the location given
by CBG by loccbg(IP ), the radius of CBG’s conﬁdence region by radiuscbg(IP ),
and the location given by a database by locdatabase(IP ), then the ratio we compute
|. A ratio smaller than 1 means that the location estimate
is | locdatabase(IP )−loccbg(IP )
given by the database is within the conﬁdence region. In this case, we would tend to
radiuscbg(IP )

trust the location estimate given by the database. A ratio larger than 1 means that the
location estimate given by the database lies outside the conﬁdence region. In that case,
it is likely that the geographic resolution of the database is too coarse to give an accurate
location estimate for the considered IP address. We observe on Figure 4 that the ratio
is typically far larger than 1, meaning that the geographic resolution of the databases
compared to the conﬁdence in the active measurements estimates is poor, relative to
the conﬁdence region of CBG. For only less than 10% of the probed IP addresses, the
databases have a good enough geographic resolution to make them comparable to the
accuracy of active measurements. Note that those results do not suggest that location
estimates provided by databases are incorrect, but rather that the geographic resolution
at which databases give mappings from IP blocks to locations are too coarse to provide
accuracy at the level of individual IP addresses.
6 Conclusion
In this paper, we assessed the geographic resolution of geolocation databases. We de-
scribed the typical content of such databases, showing that they do not contain informa-
tion to give conﬁdence in the expected accuracy of their location estimates. We illustrated
the relative coarse resolution databases provide, by showing how large the span of cities
is, and how much the location estimates differ between the considered databases.
We carried out active measurements in order to compare the geographic resolution
of databases to a more accurate standard. We quantiﬁed the accuracy of active measure-
ments, and tried to improve them by adding bandwidth measurements to reduce the bias
from bottleneck links.
Our comparison of the active measurements and the location estimates from the
databases demonstrated the coarse geographic resolution of databases location esti-
mates. We showed that not only the distance between the location estimate of the
databases and the location given by active measurements is very large, but that also
difference between the database location estimates from the active measurements esti-
mates, divided by the accuracy expected from the active measurements, is very large.
Our work shows that the geographic resolution of geolocation databases is coarse
compared to the one of active measurements. That does not mean that the location es-
timates given by databases are not good enough. Information about the geographic res-
olution of the databases can be embedded in them, for example by giving an estimate
of the city-level span for each record. In general, we do not expect that active measure-
ments will be so helpful to improve the geographic resolution of geolocation databases,
simply because databases work at the level of IP blocks. However, in particular cases
where better accuracy is required for speciﬁc IP addresses, active measurements have
great potential to provide better location estimates than databases.
