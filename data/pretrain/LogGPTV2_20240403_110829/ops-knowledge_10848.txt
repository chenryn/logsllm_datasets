Assistant: Whether there is an exception: There is an exception Exception type: Security exception Reason/solution: The message "Connection closed" appears in the log information, indicating that the SSH connection between the system and the remote host is disconnected, which is a security exception. This abnormality may be caused by a hacker or attacker trying to connect through the SSH protocol, but due to some reasons, cannot log in to the system successfully, or the system detects an abnormal connection and actively disconnects the connection.
