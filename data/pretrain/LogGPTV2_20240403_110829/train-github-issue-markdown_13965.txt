Opening this file:
https://github.com/espadrine/aulx/blob/master/html/tokenizer.js
Causes the parser to choke and Atom warns several times about not responding.
Eventually you have to give up and quit the whole app.
The exact line that is doing it is this:
https://github.com/espadrine/aulx/blob/master/html/tokenizer.js#L63
If I remove the line there is no problem.
I notice that when opening the file in Sublime 3 they don't syntax colorize
that line at all. For any really long line they just skip it.
