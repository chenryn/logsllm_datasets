of D values, Figure 2 shows the CDF of D for a randomly
chosen set of 1000 preﬁx pairs. The ﬁgure shows three im-
portant aspects of RSD applied to preﬁxes. First, it takes on
values in the range 0 to 243, because there are 243 ASes and
quasi-routers in the basis set. Second, it varies smoothly –
there are no sudden jumps or steps in the distance function.
This is in contrast to a metric like hop distance, in which
going from hop distance 1 to hop distance 2 encompasses
a huge increase in the number of preﬁx pairs. Finally, the
gradual slope on the left of the ﬁgure shows that RSD can
make ﬁne distinctions between preﬁx pairs. The number
of preﬁxes in a neighborhood grows very slowly for small to
moderate values of RSD, which means that RSD can be used
to identify ﬁne-grained groups of preﬁxes. This capability
will be important when we use RSD for clustering later in
the paper.
4. VISUALIZATION WITH RSD
In this section, we motivate the use of RSD for visualiza-
tion and we demonstrate that visualization using RSD can
yield useful insights in the analysis of interdomain routing.
4.1 Why 2-D Visualization is Meaningful
As described in Section 2, the information provided by
RSD can be organized into a distance matrix D in which
D(i, j) = RSD(i, j). We seek a way to eﬀectively visualize
the information contained in D.
To do so, we start by observing that in practice, we ﬁnd
that D has low eﬀective rank. That is, although D is a n×n
matrix it can be well approximated by a matrix of rank r
with r % n. A simple way to assess this is through a scree
plot, which is a plot of the singular values of D in decreasing
order. The sum of the ﬁrst k squared singular values is equal
to the fraction of total variance in D that can be captured
in a rank-k approximation. Thus, the scree plot of D gives
a direct assessment of the eﬀective rank of D.
We start by choosing 3000 preﬁxes at random from the
set of all 135,369 preﬁxes in our dataset. We then form the
3000 × 3000 matrix D consisting of the RSD values for all
preﬁx pairs. The scree plot of D is shown in Figure 3.
The Figure shows that D has very low eﬀective rank –
almost all of the the variation in D is captured in ﬁve di-

mensions, and even a rank-2 approximation to D captures
more than half of D’s total variance. (Results for other ran-
dom samples look very similar).
The fact that D has low eﬀective rank is important for
a number of reasons. First, it suggests that (as we will
demonstrate) RSD captures speciﬁc phenomena – were the
matrix D purely random, it would have high eﬀective rank.
Second, from a visualization standpoint, it indicates that a
large fraction of the total information captured by RSD can
be represented in a 2-D or 3-D visualization.
Thus, Figure 3 suggests that even a 2-D visualization of D
should give a reasonably accurate picture of its information
content. The usual way to construct such a visualization is
by using multidimensional scaling (MDS) [19]. Given a set of
items I and a set of item-item distances {dij}, i, j ∈ I, MDS
assigns each item a location xi, i ∈ I in some r-dimensional
Euclidean space. The goal is that distances between items
in Euclidean space should closely approximate the given set
of input distances {dij}. That is, MDS seeks to minimize:
min
x1,...,x|I|
X
i<j
(||xi − xj|| − dij)2 .
When r = 2, the result can be plotted; in such a plot, dis-
tances (i.e., RSD values) are approximately preserved.
4.2 The Emergence of Clusters
We use MDS to visualize the randomly chosen set of 3000
preﬁxes. The results are shown in Figure 4; distances be-
tween points in this ﬁgure approximate RSD. The ﬁgure
shows remarkable high-level structure: there are two large
clusters, with the smaller cluster comprising about 23% of all
preﬁxes. We ﬁnd this same clustering quite consistently for
any random sampling of preﬁxes; it seems to be an Internet-
wide phenomenon.
The fact that Internet preﬁxes cluster into two distinct
groups under the RSD metric is surprising. In fact, under-
standing the reason behind the presence of the two clusters
in Figure 4 is important and motivates our subsequent anal-
yses. Hence, we will now explore the cause of these two
clusters in depth.
First, we consider exactly what causes clustering under

RSD. Consider a cluster of preﬁxes C. This cluster corre-
sponds to a set of columns of N, i.e., N(:, C). Because the
preﬁxes in C are close to each other in RSD, the columns
of N(:, C) are similar to each other, at least in certain posi-
tions. This must be the case, by the deﬁnition of RSD.
This situation is shown in Figure 5. The ﬁgure shows the
nexthop matrix N, where cluster C is shown in gray. The
fact that the columns are similar in certain positions S is
signiﬁed by the horizontal bars. Note that for the columns
to be similar, rows in S must be constant (or at least nearly
constant).3 The region where the rows are constant is the
submatrix N(S, C).
(We have assumed that the columns
and rows of N have been reordered to bring out this struc-
ture.)
The key fact is that, in order for the preﬁxes in C to
cluster together, there will typically be a subset of rows S
with the following property: for any row within the subma-
trix N(S, C), the next hop AS in each cell must be (nearly)
always the same AS. That is, the entries of N(S, C) are ex-
pected to be highly coherent.
Thus, we can identify a cluster with a coherent submatrix
N(S, C). To understand what such coherent submatrices
signify, we consider how they arise in the course of BGP
routing. Expressed in terms of BGP, N(S, C) captures a set
of source ASes (S) that all make similar routing decisions
with respect to a set of destination ASes (C, i.e., the clus-
ter). In Section 6, we use diﬀerent measures to quantify and
evaluate the coherence of the submatrix N(S, C).
We refer to the pair (S, C) as a local atom. A local atom
is a generalization of the notion of BGP atoms [6]. Whereas
a BGP atom is a set of preﬁxes that are routed the same
way by all routers in the Internet, a local atom is a set
of preﬁxes that are routed similarly in some region of the
Internet (i.e., by the ASes in S). To be interesting, a local
atom (S, C) should have a signiﬁcant number of ASes in S
and also preﬁxes in C.
To illustrate the concept of a local atom, we return to the
3Strictly speaking, it is possible to construct a cluster with-
out a common set of similar rows; but such an arrangement
is highly unlikely in practice as it requires a very speciﬁc
structure. In all the cluster examples we study, we ﬁnd that
the preﬁxes cluster together because of a common set of
similar rows.
example in Figure 4. The smaller cluster turns out to be
the result of a local atom. We demonstrate this as follows.
Sampling the preﬁxes in the smaller cluster, we ﬁnd that
they belong primarily to networks in the Far East, with a
small portion belonging to networks in the US. For example,
out of a random sample of 100 preﬁxes we ﬁnd that 64%
are Far East and Paciﬁc Rim networks (including Korea,
Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, Singapore, China, Hong Kong,
Australia, and New Zealand) and 30% are from North Amer-
ica. However, there are also many Far Eastern (29%) and
North American (20%) preﬁxes in the larger cluster (along
with 33% European, which are almost completely absent in
the smaller cluster).4 Figure 6 shows examples of where
a random selection of these preﬁxes occurs within the two
clusters.
Given that Far Eastern and US preﬁxes occur in both
clusters, why then should this speciﬁc set of Far Eastern
and US preﬁxes group together in the smaller cluster?
The answer has to do with the next-hop decisions made
by the source set S. There are 35 ASes in the S set; they are
predominantly in Europe (52%) and North America (40%).
These ASes prefer one particular provider for transit to the
Far East and US. This provider is Hurricane Electric, ASN
6939 (‘HE’). The overwhelming presence of AS 6939 as a
next-hop results in the observed coherence of N(S, C). On
the other hand, the set of ASes in S does not commonly
agree on next hops to destinations in Europe. Therefore,
these preﬁxes do not occur in the local atom. Instead, those
preﬁxes appear in the larger cluster in Figure 4.
Figure 7 is a visualization of a portion of the nexthop ma-
trix N. In this plot, colors represent the ﬁve most popular
next-hop ASes across both clusters. The preﬁxes (columns)
consist of 50 samples chosen at random from each of the two
clusters. The ﬁrst 35 rows correspond to the ASes in set S
and the remaining rows are other ASes shown for compar-
4The assignment of a preﬁx to a geographic region was done
by noting the AS that announced the preﬁx, and then com-
bining information from the various routing registries along
with inspection of network maps and peering relationships
where available.
In particular, for preﬁxes that were an-
nounced by internationally distributed ASes, care was taken
to identify the region the preﬁx originated from.

ison. The local atom (S, C) can be seen as the submatrix
N(S, C) in the upper left part of the plot.
The ﬁgure shows the remarkable coherence of the N(S, C)
submatrix. The similarity of the columns on the left side of
the plot is the reason that those preﬁxes cluster together in
Figure 4. It also shows that, while sources in S clearly dis-
tinguish between preﬁxes in the two clusters, other sources
do not.
In fact, the preﬁxes that occur in the smaller cluster have
the following property: if any path from a monitor to a pre-
ﬁx in our dataset passes through Hurricane Electric, then
that preﬁx is in the smaller cluster. This remarkable fact
is illustrated in Figure 8. The ﬁgure shows which preﬁxes
can be reached from one or more monitors through three of
the most commonly occurring ASes in our data: (a) Level
3, (b) Hurricane Electric, and (c) Sprint. The ﬁgure shows
that what determines which preﬁxes go into the smaller clus-
ter is whether the preﬁx can be reached through Hurricane
Electric.
An example of routing to one such preﬁx is shown in Fig-
ure 9 (generated using BGPlay [4]). The preﬁx is one of
those that falls into the smaller cluster. The ﬁgure shows
how Hurricane Electric (ASN 6939) plays a special role with
respect to this preﬁx for a large set of ASes. The presence
of the smaller cluster is a result of routing patterns similar
to Figure 9 for all the preﬁxes in the cluster.
To uncover the reasons behind this eﬀect, we consulted
with a number of the network operators whose BGP conﬁg-
urations contributed to the clustering (that is, operators of
networks in the source set S). As a result, we can explain
the reason for this unusual routing behavior with respect to
Hurricane Electric: HE is a large ISP, but it has an open
peering policy. That is, any ISP that has a presence in an
exchange point in common with HE will be allowed to peer
with HE at that exchange point [12]. HE is present in dozens
of exchange points, mainly in the US and Europe (but with
some in the Far East).
Note that most operators will prefer peer routes over
provider routes in general. This implies that an ISP that
peers with HE will typically use HE as the next-hop to reach
any network that is a customer of HE (and not one of its own
customers). Hence, we can identify S as largely consisting
of networks that peer with HE, and D as the set of networks
that are customers (or customers of customers, etc.) of HE.
Thus, the presence of two clusters among Internet pre-
ﬁxes is due to a large-scale phenomenon:
for many ASes,
Hurricane Electric is the preferred next hop for any preﬁxes
for which it provides transit. Thus this local atom is a case
of similar decision making by independent entities (ASes)
when driven by common external factors; in this case, it
seems that the particular, open peering policy used by HE
is responsible for the observed similarity of routing behavior.
Hence, we conclude that clustering in RSD space has the
potential to uncover local atoms, and local atoms are evi-
dence of (generally unexpected) synchronization of routing
decisions among certain ASes with respect to certain des-
tinations. We then naturally ask the question: besides the
macroscopic cluster shown in Figure 4, are there other local
atoms, corresponding to other clusters, in our data? Pre-
sumably these clusters are at smaller scale and thus will
be much harder to ﬁnd. This motivates us to consider the
problem of clustering in RSD space more analytically, and
to look for eﬃcient and eﬀective methods of clustering for
RSD.
5. CLUSTERING WITH RSD
Finding a natural clustering for preﬁxes using the RSD
metric is challenging. Common clustering methods either
operate over a continuous metric space (e.g., k-means) or
others (e.g., k-median) require deﬁning the notion of a ‘rep-
resentative’ object for each cluster (i.e., the object that min-
imizes the sum of the distances to all other points in the
cluster). Unfortunately, our data are not continuous; each
data point is a column of the nexthop matrix and therefore
its elements are categorical. Secondly, the notion of a rep-
resentative in the RSD metric space is not clear. Further,
most clustering algorithms require the number of clusters
as input. Here we show that the RSD metric has a natural
clustering formulation that does not have these drawbacks.
Throughout this section, we will use the generic deﬁnition
