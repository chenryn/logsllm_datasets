### Apache Airflow version
2.3.2 AND 2.4.2
### What happened
  * Was running on version 2.3.2, out of sudden, scheduler keeps crashing and restarting. Upgrading to 2.4.2 does not resolve the issue.
  * It appears that one particular pipeline cannot updated to be successful (after all tasks succeeded)
## Symptom 1
This is when trying to mark the pipeline success (Either manually or by the
Airflow Scheduler). The traceback log appears in both the webserver as well as
the scheduler. Marking the dag failure does not cause error.  
At this time, access
the dag detail view of this dag works. (See attached video as well)

## Symptom 2
  * Upgraded to version 2.4.2
  * Trying to recover the issue with `airflow dags reserialize` (on version 2.4.2), the command succeeded but did not resolve the issue.
  * The error shows up when access the detail view of the dag. Below query returns 2 records.
    select *
    from dag
    where dag_id = 'my_problem_dag';
    The result of this query is

    sqlalchemy.exc.MultipleResultsFound: Multiple rows were found when exactly one was required
## Symptom 3
Most importantly, the scheduler loop exited, and crashes very often due to
that the scheduler trying to update dag run result, but no row was affected.
### What you think should happen instead
  * We were running 2.3.2 for a while and had no problem.
  * The problematic pipeline was not modified for the last six months
