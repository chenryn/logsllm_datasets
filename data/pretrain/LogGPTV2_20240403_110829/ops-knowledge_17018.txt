**Issue: Running a Django Dynamic Scraper Project on Windows**

I am working on a project using the Django Dynamic Scraper. The project runs smoothly on Linux, but I encounter an error when I attempt to run the `syncdb` command on Windows.

### Error Details

When I execute the following command:
```sh
python manage.py syncdb
```
I receive the following error message:
```
python : WindowsError: [Error 3] The system cannot find the path specified: 'C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\django_dynamic_scraper-0.3.0-py2.7.egg\dynamic_scraper\migrations/.'
At line:1 char:1
+ python manage.py syncdb
+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (WindowsError: [...migrations/.':String) [],
   RemoteException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : NativeCommandError
```

The admin server runs properly with the command:
```sh
python manage.py runserver
```

### Solution

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Package:**
   Download the `django-dynamic-scraper-0.3.0-py2.7.tar.gz` file from the official source or a trusted repository.

2. **Extract and Rename:**
   - Unzip the downloaded file.
   - Rename the extracted folder to `django-dynamic-scraper-0.3.0-py2.7.egg`.

3. **Place in Site-Packages:**
   - Copy the renamed folder and paste it into the `C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages` directory.

After completing these steps, try running the `syncdb` command again to see if the issue is resolved.
