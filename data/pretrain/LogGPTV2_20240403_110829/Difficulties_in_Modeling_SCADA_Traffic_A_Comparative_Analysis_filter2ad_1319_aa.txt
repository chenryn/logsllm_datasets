Abstract. Modern critical infrastructures, such as water distribution
and power generation, are large facilities that are distributed over large
geographical areas. Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)
networks are deployed to guarantee the correct operation and safety of
these infrastructures. In this paper, we describe key characteristics of
SCADA traﬃc, verifying if models developed for traﬃc in traditional
IT networks are applicable. Our results show that SCADA traﬃc largely
diﬀers from traditional IT traﬃc, more noticeably not presenting diurnal
patters or self-similar correlations in the time series.
1 Introduction
Modern critical infrastructures, such as water distribution and power generation,
are large facilities that are distributed over large geographical areas. Supervisory
Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) networks are deployed to continuously
monitor these infrastructures in order to guarantee correct operation and safety.
Originally, SCADA networks were isolated networks running proprietary proto-
cols, but there is an increasing trend toward the usage of IP protocols and the
interconnection with other networks and even the Internet.
Intuitively, we expect SCADA to present traﬃc patterns much diﬀerent to
those of “traditional” Information Technology (IT) networks. This is due to a
number of reasons. First, SCADA networks are expected to be more stable over
time, in the sense that new nodes are not expected to join or leave frequently.
Second, traditional networks usually support a multitude of protocols, such as
HTTP, instant messaging and Voice over IP, while the number of services in
SCADA networks is expected to be more limited. Finally, most of the SCADA
traﬃc is expected to be generated in a periodical fashion, due to the polling
mechanism used to gather data. In consequence, traﬃc patterns should not be
so dependent on human activity as in traditional IT networks.
Apart from the assumptions given above, not much more is publicly known
about the behavior of SCADA traﬃc. This is partly caused by the sensitivity
of the data. In fact, publications on SCADA networks generally do not rely
on empirical data as obtained from real-world measurement [1,2,3]. In contrast,

traditional networks have been intensively studied, sometimes leading to surpris-
ing insights. As an example, we refer to the seminal work in [4] and [5] on the
self-similar nature of network traﬃc and, connected to that, to studies on the
presence of long-range dependency and heavy-tailed distributions [6,7,8,9]. The
research has resulted in models and tools employed in, for example, the design
and dimensioning of network equipment and the parametrization of management
algorithms. Naturally, the question arises whether the existing models are also
valid for SCADA networks.
The goal of this paper is to verify if models used to describe traditional net-
work traﬃc can also be applied to SCADA traﬃc. We achieve this by comparing
a traditional IP traﬃc trace with real-world SCADA measurements done by us.
However, network behavior can be compared in a virtually inﬁnite number of
ways, starting from the above mentioned characteristic of self-similarity to topo-
logical properties [10] and application speciﬁc aspects [11]. In order to provide
information that is of interest for a wide range of readers, we base our analysis
in this ﬁrst work on a list of “invariants”, i.e., behaviours that are empirically
shown to hold for a wide range of environments, proposed in the well known
paper of Floyd and Paxson [12]. We revise this list and test our datasets for the
invariants applicable to our context.
In a separate, but closely related work, we perform a series of tests to char-
acterize SCADA traﬃc at the IP level, while drawing a comparison with Simple
Network Management Protocol (SNMP) traﬃc [13]. Our analysis conﬁrms that
most hosts (including user workstations) generate data in a periodical way, re-
sulting in a remarkably constant traﬃc time series. Surprisingly, we observe that
changes in the IP level connectivity matrix are common.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the
datasets used in this paper. In Section 3, we give a short description of the
invariants and we brieﬂy explain how the tests are performed. The results are
presented in Section 4. Finally, conclusions are given in Section 5.
2 Datasets
The datasets that we use in this paper consist of four network packet traces
in pcap format [14], collected at three diﬀerent locations: two water treatment
and distribution facilities that use SCADA networks and one research institute
network with “ordinary” IP traﬃc. From the pcap traces we generate ﬂow infor-
mation by aggregating packets that are no more than 300s apart, based on the
traditional 5-tuple of protocol number, source and destination IP addresses and
port numbers. In this section, we give more insight into the data.
The two SCADA locations have diﬀerent topologies, as shown in Figure 1.
Both topologies have a corporate network that does not have direct access to
the other parts of the network and is, in general, connected to the Internet. In
the three-layer topology (Figure 1a) , the remaining part of the network consists
of the ﬁeld network and the control network. The ﬁeld network contains the
Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) and the Remote Terminal Units (RTU)

that monitor (and possibly issue commands to) the ﬁeld devices. The control
network contains several servers with diﬀerent purposes, such as automatically
polling of ﬁeld nodes and performing the access control; and the Human-Machine
Interfaces (HMI). The latter are operator workstations that provide an user
interface to the ﬁeld nodes. The communication between the control network
and the ﬁeld network passes through a single node, the connectivity server.
In contrast, there is no such explicit (physical) separation between the control
network and the ﬁeld network in the two-layer topology (Figure 1b).
For the SCADA location following the 2-layer topology, we have captured the
traﬃc in the joint control/ﬁeld network. We refer to the collected dataset as
2layer in the following. For the 3-layer SCADA location, we have captured the
traﬃc in the control network as well as in the ﬁeld network. The so obtained two
packet traces are referred to as 3layer-control and 3layer-ﬁeld. In both locations,
the data capture was done through a switch’s mirror port, that replicated all
traﬃc in a given network. No data loss was reported. Finally, we have ignored
the traﬃc in the corporate networks since they do not transport SCADA traﬃc.
In order to provide a comparison with a traditional IT environment, we have
selected a publicly available traﬃc trace from the network of an educational
organization: Location 6 from [15]. The organization is relatively small with
around 36 employees and 100 students. Its network is comparable to the above
SCADA networks in the number of hosts as well as in the average bandwidth
and, hence, is an adequate candidate for the following studies. We use only a
portion of the available data, approximately the ﬁrst 7.5 days of the trace. We
refer to this dataset as IT. An overview of all four datasets is given in Table 1.

3 Invariants
In [12], seven invariants in Internet traﬃc are presented. Not all of them are
suitable for the datasets considered in this paper. In Sections 3.1 through 3.3,
we give a short description of those four invariants that we test in Section 4 and
we brieﬂy explain how the tests are performed. In Section 3.4 we discuss the
remaining three invariants and the reasons why we have not considered them.
3.1 Diurnal Patterns of Activity
Network activity is strongly correlated with human activity. As a consequence,
it starts increasing around 8–9 AM local time, peaks around 11 AM and 3–4 PM
and decreases as business day ends at 5 PM. Moreover, the amount of traﬃc
during the weekends tends to be considerably smaller than during week days. In
order to verify if SCADA traﬃc also follows this pattern, we plot time series for
three diﬀerent measures: the number of active ﬂows, packets/sec and bytes/sec.
3.2 Self-similarity
Self-similarity is the quality that the whole resembles its parts. In network traﬃc,
it can be observed as bursty periods being present at diﬀerent timescales, from
milliseconds to a few hours. This property violates the assumptions of traditional
Markovian modeling that predicts that longer-term correlations are weak. Since
the initial ﬁndings in the early 90’s [4,5], self-similarity of network traﬃc has
remained an active ﬁeld of research (see, e.g., [9]).
For this paper, we have decided to employ three popular visual methods to test
self-similarity [4,6]: the R/S analysis, variance-time plots and periodograms. The
visual representation of their results allows to detect anomalies and to estimate
the degree of self-similarity in the data:
R/S analysis: For a given set of observations X = X(t), 0 < t ≤ N, consider a
subset with starting point ti and size n. Let X(ti, n) and S(ti, n) be, respectively,
the mean and the standard deviation of a subsample of X calculated over the
interval [ti, ti+(n−1)]. The rescaled adjusted range plot (or R/S pox diagram) can
be obtained by dividing a set of observations X into K non-overlapping subsets
of size N/K with starting points ti = i(N/K) + 1. One selects logarithmically
spaced values of n and plots log(R/S(ti, n)) as a function of log(n), where R/S
is the R/S statistic. The Hurst parameter can be estimated from the slope of a
line ﬁtted to the resulting curve.
Variance-time plots: Self-similar time series do not become “smoother” at larger
time scales, i.e., the variance decreases slowly for increasing aggregation levels.
Let X (m) be the aggregated process, deﬁned as X (m)(t) = m−1
X(t).
The variance-time plot shows the variance of the aggregated process, S2(X (m))
versus the aggregation level m in a log-log scale. A line is least-squares ﬁtted to
the resulting curve, ignoring small values of m. A slope −1 ≤ β ≤ 0 suggests
self-similarity, and the Hurst parameter can be estimated as H = 1 − β/2.

Periodograms: The last method consists of ﬁtting a least-squares line to the low-
frequency part of a periodogram, typically the lowest 10%. The Hurst parameter
can be estimated as H = (1 − β)/2, with β being the slope of the ﬁtted line.
3.3 Log-Normal Connection Sizes and Heavy-Tail Distributions
Log-normal distributions are a good ﬁt to the body of connection size distribu-
tions, while the tails of network-activity related distributions are often heavy-
tailed. Since the original list of invariants was published, a debate started over
which of these models better describe connection size distributions: heavy-tail
(e.g., [6]) or log-normal (e.g., [7]). Recently, Gong et al. [8] argued that there is
never suﬃcient data to support any analytical form summarizing the tail behav-
ior, therefore the research eﬀorts should focus instead on studying the complex
nature of traﬃc generation and its implications.
In this work, we do not attempt to ﬁt our measurements to theoretical dis-
tributions. We simply show, through widely used Complementary Cumulative
Distribution Functions (CCDFs) [7], that measurements from the IT dataset
generally match the results reported in the literature and point out the diﬀer-
ences to the connection size distributions in SCADA networks.
3.4 Invariants Not Tested in This Work
In addition to the above four invariants, [12] also deﬁnes three invariants that
we do not further study in this paper for reasons explained in the following:
Session arrivals: A “session” refers to the period of time a human uses the net-
work for a speciﬁc task. There is evidence that session arrivals are well-modeled
by a Poisson process, e.g., FTP, TELNET [5] and HTTP [16]. Since the con-
cept is highly protocol speciﬁc, it is hard to develop a general method to group
network packets to sessions. This is especially true for our SCADA datasets, as
most of the protocols are closed. Hence, we do not attempt to test this invariant
in this work. Note that ﬂows are not well-modeled by a Poisson process.
Telnet packet generation: Packets generated by keystrokes, e.g., in a Telnet ses-
sion, obey a Pareto distribution. Since this invariant mostly concerns human
behavior and a single speciﬁc protocol, we have not considered it in this work.
Characteristics of the global topology: Some behaviors appear due to character-
istics of the Earth. For example, the delay in inter-continental connections is
bounded by the propagation delay. Such characteristics are not relevant for the
relatively small networks considered in this paper.

In this section we discuss the results of our analysis regarding the four selected
invariants.

Fig. 2. Looking for diurnal traﬃc patterns
4.1 Diurnal Patterns of Activity
Diurnal patterns in network activity are widely reported in the literature [12]. In
contrast, most of the traﬃc of a SCADA environment is generated periodically
by the polling mechanism used to retrieve data, and as a consequence, it should
have a very regular throughput. To verify this, we plot three diﬀerent time series:
packets/s, bytes/s and number of active ﬂows, calculated over 30-minute bins
for our four datasets. To ease the comparison, we align the time series based
on weekdays. Figure 2 show the results for packets/s. The results for the other
metrics are analogous, thus not shown due to space constraints.
As can be seen, the SCADA traﬃc does not present day and night patterns.
Instead, all time series remain stable over large periods of time, to which we
refer as baselines. Note, however, that the throughput is not constant. Notably,
datasets 2layer and 3layer-ﬁeld present a considerable drop in the packet rate at
around Friday noon and Sunday noon respectively. Such stability combined with
the fact that most sources generate traﬃc in a periodical way [13] indicates that
ON/OFF models might provide a good approximation for the general shape of
the time series.
A closer inspection of the data reveals three major causes for the deviations
from the baseline: (i) the start or end of ﬂows with large throughput, (ii) the
increase (or decease) in the rate in which variables are pooled and (iii) the
increase (or decrease) in the number of variables pooled. We speculate that the
changes are mostly caused by certain changes in the physical process that the
SCADA systems control, e.g., tanks becoming full or an increase in the water
demand. Another possible cause is a manual access to the PLCs, for either
retrieving data or uploading a new conﬁguration. Further research is necessary
to establish if these changes can be predicted.
As expected, the IT dataset shows diurnal patterns of activity, with lower
throughput during the nights and weekends. The daily peaks seen in the early
morning (around 5.25 AM) are caused by a single large ﬂow between the same
