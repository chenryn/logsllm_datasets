Hey guys, thank you for adding the setMinimizable option here
One weird thing though. When we use that and minimize the window by using
WindowKey+D RequestAnimationFrame is still working. **Which is a good thing
for me!** Since I want it to always be running for my game, but is that
intended? Because I don't want to install / use a new version of electron and
then it will come back and bite me in my ass :)
