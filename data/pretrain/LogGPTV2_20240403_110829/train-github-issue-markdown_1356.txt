#### Code Sample, a copy-pastable example if possible
    # for example, index should be accepted, like so:
    df.to_parquet( 'my_parquet_file.parquet', compression='gzip', index=False )
#### Problem description
[this should explain **why** the current behaviour is a problem and why the
expected output is a better solution.]
**Note** : We receive a lot of issues on our GitHub tracker, so it is very
possible that your issue has been posted before. Please check first before
submitting so that we do not have to handle and close duplicates!
**Note** : Many problems can be resolved by simply upgrading `pandas` to the
latest version. Before submitting, please check if that solution works for
you. If possible, you may want to check if `master` addresses this issue, but
that is not necessary.
For documentation-related issues, you can check the latest versions of the
docs on `master` here:
https://pandas-docs.github.io/pandas-docs-travis/
If the issue has not been resolved there, go ahead and file it in the issue
tracker.
#### Expected Output
#### Output of `pd.show_versions()`
