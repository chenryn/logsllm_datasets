#### How to reproduce the bug
    git clone https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/
    cd incubator-superset/contrib/docker
    docker-compose run --rm superset ./docker-init.sh
### Environment
Superset commit `ff6773df4ed7d3baca15f19baf30a793b4fce248`  
`Docker version 18.09.9-ce, build 039a7df`
### Checklist
Make sure these boxes are checked before submitting your issue - thank you!
  * [X ] I have checked the superset logs for python stacktraces and included it here as text if there are any.
  * [ X] I have reproduced the issue with at least the latest released version of superset.
  * [ X] I have checked the issue tracker for the same issue and I haven't found one similar.
### Additional context
Pretty sure this is due to changes in this PR that was merged in earlier
today. I checked out the commit immediately before that (`git checkout
300c4ecb0f6798e5901dcb88a034c53e708ff0b4`) and everything worked just fine.
I tried to update the `docker-init.sh` script so
`FLASK_APP="superset.app:create_app()"`. That got passed the initial error but
more popped up.
