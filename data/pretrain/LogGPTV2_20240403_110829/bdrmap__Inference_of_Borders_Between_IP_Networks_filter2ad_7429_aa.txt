## Abstract
We address the challenging and long-standing problem of automatically and accurately inferring network boundaries in traceroute data. This seemingly straightforward task is fraught with difficulties in real-world scenarios, which have hindered numerous research and development efforts for decades. We present a method that leverages targeted traceroutes, an understanding of traceroute peculiarities, and a set of structured heuristics to correctly identify interdomain links at the granularity of individual border routers. Our focus is on the network boundaries we can confidently infer, particularly those attached to the network initiating the traceroute. We validate our algorithm against ground truth data from four networks, covering 3,277 links, and achieve accuracy rates of 96.3% to 98.9%. Using 19 vantage points (VPs) across a large U.S. broadband provider, we reveal the high density of router-level interconnections between some ASes. In January 2016, the broadband provider had 45 router-level links with a Tier-1 peer, and we found that 17 VPs were required to observe all 45 links. Our method forms the foundation of a system we are developing to map interdomain performance, and we release our code.

## 1. Introduction
Traceroute is a familiar tool for Internet researchers and operators, but its output presents significant inferential challenges. These challenges have impeded the development of more accurate Internet path inference capabilities and, consequently, a range of research and development efforts. Despite these limitations, traceroute has been the primary tool for measuring and analyzing Internet router-level topologies for two decades.

### Challenges in Topology Discovery
1. **TCP/IP Architecture**: The TCP/IP architecture lacks a concept of interdomain boundaries at the network layer. An IP address identifies only a single interface on a router, and routers can have hundreds or thousands of interfaces.
2. **Measurement Tool Limitations**: Traceroute uses a 30-year-old hack to trick each router into revealing one of its interface IP addresses. Constructing an Internet-scale topology requires superimposing millions of such measurements and applying heuristic techniques to resolve aliases, which can lead to inflated link counts.
3. **Address Assignment and Router Implementation**: Operator practices and router implementations limit the accuracy of mapping IP addresses to the organizations that announce the longest matching prefix in BGP.
4. **Sampling Bias**: Traceroute measurements tend to sample links close to the vantage point, leading to less visibility into distant networks and reduced accuracy in router ownership inferences.
5. **Lack of Transparency**: Operators often avoid assigning hostnames to router interfaces to prevent revealing network topology information to competitors or potential attackers.

These challenges impede various Internet research and development efforts, including realistic network modeling, protocol design, and assessing real-world network properties like interdomain congestion, infrastructure resiliency, and security vulnerabilities. This paper makes the following contributions:

1. **Scalable Method for Network Boundary Inference**: We introduce a scalable method to accurately infer the boundaries of a given network and the other networks attached at each boundary. Our approach efficiently infers forward IP paths from traceroute measurements, resolves IP aliases, and uses topological constraints from BGP data to identify interdomain links.
2. **Efficient System for Resource-Limited Devices**: We develop a system that allows deployment on resource-limited devices by offloading data and state to a centrally-operated system.
3. **Validation with Ground Truth Data**: We validate our algorithm using ground truth data from four network operators and IXP address databases, achieving 96.3% to 98.9% accuracy for 3,277 inferred links.
4. **Utility Demonstration**: We demonstrate the utility of our algorithm by analyzing the topology of a large access ISP, revealing 45 interdomain links with a Tier-1 peer, distributed throughout the ISPâ€™s network.
5. **Public Release of Source Code**: We publicly release the source code implementation as part of scamper to promote further validation and use.

## 2. Motivation
### Network Modeling and Resilience
Early models of Internet topology considered each AS as a node and interdomain links as edges between ASes. While this model is simplistic, it reflects the inferential capabilities of the research community. Our work enables the construction of a router-level map of interdomain connectivity, which will improve the accuracy of AS topology evolution models and enable more detailed analysis of network resiliency and robustness.

### Interdomain Congestion
The growing demand for high-bandwidth content has fueled recent peering disputes among ISPs. Identifying persistent congestion on interdomain links is of increasing interest to the public policy community. For example, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) required AT&T to report performance measurements of its interconnections as part of the AT&T-DirectTV merger. Accurate identification of network borders is essential for addressing this challenge.

## 3. Related Work
### Internet Topology Measurement and Analysis
Research on Internet topology measurement and analysis has been active for over two decades, spanning AS, router, and physical topology. Recent work has focused on rich connectivity at IXPs and understanding the physical infrastructure facilitating connectivity. Our work aims to infer interconnection topology details that enable accurate interpretation of routing and performance measurements.

### Techniques for Alias Resolution
Alias resolution, the process of mapping IP addresses to common routers, is critical for counting and characterizing interdomain connections. Various techniques have been developed, including probing unused ports, utilizing reverse DNS information, and using the IP record-route option. Our work builds on these techniques to focus on the accurate inference of router-level interdomain connectivity between ASes.

### Inference of AS-Level Connectivity
Traceroute can provide AS-level connectivity information, compensating for the limitations of BGP data. However, deriving AS-level connectivity from traceroute requires heuristic inference and caution. The canonical approach of mapping IP addresses to ASes can induce false AS-link inferences due to factors such as shared address space and multihoming. Our method addresses these issues by using a structured set of heuristics and topological constraints.
