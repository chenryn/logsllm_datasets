User: I registered a Google App Engine app and I have some files below:

/index.html
/tabs.css
/tab.js
/temp.py

How should I write the app.yaml file?
Assistant: you should put your static files into some directory, for example staticdata
then your app.yaml would look like:

application: temp
version: 1
runtime: python
api_version: 1

handlers:
- url: /staticdata
  static_dir: staticdata

- url: /.*
  script: temp.py
