From the above steps, the estimation of η and timeout
for a crash-recovery FDS based on the NFD-S algorithm
amounts to ﬁnding a numerical solution for the inequali-
ties (8)-(13). This can be done using binary search sim-
ilarly to [3]. But the estimation of the input parameters
of the conﬁguration become more difﬁcult because param-
eters, such as E(XL(t)), MTTF, MTTR etc., are needed
for such a FDS. We will introduce input parameter estima-
tion shortly in Section 5. Note that for this conﬁguration
procedure, choosing a different message transmission pro-
tocol (e.g. TCP, UDP) can achieve different QoS for mes-
sage communication. Thus, this new conﬁguration can be
more adaptive to the message transmission. For example,
if the message loss probability or message delay is high for
a certain protocol, then the FDS can switch to a more reli-
able protocol to achieve a better QoS without increasing the
communication frequency or the timeout length.
4.4. Discussion
In Section 4.2 we introduced how to estimate the QoS
bounds for a crash-recovery FDS based on the NFD-S al-
gorithm. However, there are several facts which need to be
taken into consideration.
In reality, the MTTF and MTTR are non-deterministic
values, governed by random distributions. The proportion
of detected failures is dependent on the probability distribu-
tion of Xc(t), the length of η and timeout. If it is required
to detect most failures before recovery, in practice η +
timeout should be much smaller than MTTR. For exam-
ple, for exponentially distributed Xc(t), if η + timeout =

Theorem 4.1 gives the bounds of E(TMR) and E(TM).
However, from Fig. 3 we can see that the characteris-
tics of E(TMR) and E(TM) in the durations of [t0, t1)
M )), [t1, t2) (E(T 00
(E(T 0
M )), [t2, t3)
(E(T 000
M )) are quite different. Estimating η and
timeout using the mean of the dependability measure-
ments might not satisfy the QoS requirement all the time.
A stricter bound can be achieved by using the maxi-
mum value in the set {E(T 0
M )}, which
M ), E(T 00
must be smaller than T U
M and the minimum value in
MR)}, which must be larger than
{E(T 0

MR.
For TM, E(T 0
M ) is E(TDR); E(T 000
M ) is less than E(TD);
E(T 00
M ), which is the fail-free duration, can be estimated
by using the equation (3.3) of Theorem 5 in [3]. Thus

More strictly, E(TDR) can be substituted by the maximum

can be substituted by T U

For TMR, the possible mistake recurrence of the FDS
is affected by the message delays, and losses, and the
CR-TS’s crashes and recoveries. The impact of the CR-
TS’s crash and recovery is governed by MTTF and MTTR,
which mainly occur during[t0, t1) and [t2, t3). The im-
pact of message delays and losses on TMR mainly happen
within [t1, t2). From the analysis of Theorem 4.1 in Sec-
tion 4.2, we know that E(T

Inequality (15) gives a stricter constraint for the QoS es-
timation. However, the drawback of this method is obvious.
For a highly consistent CR-TS, due to small MTTR, TMR
could be too small to satisfy a given QoS requirement. In
this situation, using E(TMR) instead could be a reasonable
solution because the recovery of the CR-TS only happens
once per MTBF period. Furthermore, if timeout is scaled
up or even becomes larger than MTTR, from Theorem 4.1
we can know that the E(TMR) can increase, but more fail-
ures will become undetectable. For such a highly consistent
CR-TS, some new algorithm is needed to tackle this prob-

5. Parameter Estimation
For a crash-recovery run, there are more input parame-
ters than the fail-free run, e.g. parameters such as MTBF,
MTTF, MTTR, pL, E(D) and E(XL(t)), are used for the
FDS conﬁguration. For such a crash-recovery FDS’s con-
ﬁguration, the following strategies are used. During the ﬁrst
MTBF period (at the very beginning), we can assume that
the QoS of the message communication is perfect (pL = 0,
E(D) is small and E(XL(t)) = 0), and the CR-TS is fail-
free (MTTF → +∞). For the following MTBF periods,
initially, the previous period’s estimations can be used. As
the monitoring procedure continues, the estimation of the
QoS of the message communication and the dependability
metrics of the CR-TS will become more and more accurate.
Thus the FDS can be reconﬁgured to adapt to the chang-
ing input parameters achieving better η and timeout values.
The following gives a brief description of how to estimate
the FDS’s inputs.
QoS of Message Transmission Estimation: the estima-
tion of pL and E(D) can proceed similarly to [3]. How-
ever the estimation of pL and E(D) should now be for
each MTBF period. In addition, the average message loss-
length E(XL(t)) is used for the recovery detection speed
E(TDR) estimation. In our model, each message’s transmis-
sion and loss behaviors are assumed to be independent (as in
[3]). Thus the mean number of consecutive message losses
E(XL(t)) = 1×pL+2×p2
L =
L . Hence after arithmetic manipulation, it can be
L+···+m×pm

simpliﬁed to:
E(XL(t)) = pL(1 − pm
L )
(1 − pL)2 − mpm+1
1 − pL
L
(16)
where m is the maximum number of consecutive messages
lost and pL is the probability that each message is lost during
the transmission. When m → +∞ and pL < 1, pm
L → 0
L → 0. Therefore equation (16) can be simpliﬁed
and mpm
further:
m→+∞ E(XL(t)) =
lim
pL
(1 − pL)2
(17)
If dependencies between message transmissions exist, then
adopting the empirical probability distribution of XL(t) for
estimation of E(XL(t)) is needed (c.f. [14]).
