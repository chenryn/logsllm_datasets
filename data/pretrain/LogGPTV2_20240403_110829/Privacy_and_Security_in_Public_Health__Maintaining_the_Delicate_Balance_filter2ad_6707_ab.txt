### Public Health Information Network (PHIN)

The Public Health Information Network (PHIN) is designed to replace the "stovepipe" systems of the past with an interconnected web of interoperable information systems. PHIN aims to facilitate seamless sharing of electronic health information among public health partners, including local, state, and federal public health agencies, as well as laboratories, hospitals, and other support organizations. It defines technology, data, vocabulary, and information security standards to ensure consistent exchange of health, disease tracking, and response data. Additionally, PHIN protects the security of these data and ensures network reliability during national crises [16].

### National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (NEDSS)

The National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (NEDSS) program [17] is developing and implementing an integrated, standards-based solution to support ongoing public health surveillance across the U.S. NEDSS functions include the identification, monitoring, and response to infectious diseases and outbreaks. The program includes architecture, a set of terminology and messaging standards, and a reference implementation that enables public health agencies to share information electronically, promoting timeliness and accuracy. Under federal funding, states are assessing their current systems and developing plans to either build upon the NEDSS reference implementation provided by the CDC or acquire NEDSS-compatible systems.

### Outbreak Management System (OMS)

To support uniform collection and representation of information during an outbreak, the CDC has developed the Outbreak Management System (OMS). OMS is a complete application designed to support the response to public health emergencies. It includes tools for configuring data-collection instruments, collecting and analyzing data, managing controlled terminology, conducting case and contact investigations, and generating reports [18]. OMS is designed to run on a laptop computer with or without continuous network connectivity, making it suitable for deployment in regions with limited or intermittent network access.

### Biosurveillance

The availability of new sensor and data mining technologies, combined with the recognition of the potential value of innovative data sources, has increased interest in using technology for early detection of outbreaks and potential bioterrorist attacks. This has led to the development of biosurveillance, which involves the automated monitoring of various information sources to provide situational awareness and detect emerging epidemics, whether naturally occurring, accidental, or the result of bioterrorism [19].

Biosurveillance systems monitor a wide range of data sources, including clinical diagnostic data, consumer behaviors (e.g., purchases of over-the-counter drugs), ambulatory care, chief complaints reported to emergency-room staff, work or school absenteeism, lab orders, and data collected by bio-sensors. These systems leverage two major surveillance methods: established public health surveillance methods and near real-time, automated analysis of cases and suspect cases, along with statistical analysis and data visualization of pre-diagnostic and diagnostic data [20]. Biosurveillance systems are being developed at local, state, and national levels [19, 21, 22, 23, 24].

### Syndromic Surveillance

Syndromic surveillance is a type of biosurveillance used primarily for early detection. It monitors healthcare utilization patterns and pre-diagnostic clinical data in real time to detect the first signs of a covert biological attack or disease outbreak. Examples of syndromic surveillance systems include the Department of Defenseâ€™s prototype Electronic Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Community-based Epidemics (ESSENCE) and BioSense, implemented in hospitals and health systems in major U.S. cities [23, 28].

### Privacy and Security Considerations

The privacy sensitivity of information useful for public health surveillance increases as the information becomes more specific and person-centric. For example, air samplings collected by BioWatch contain no personal health information, while NND case reports sent to local and state health departments contain detailed personal and clinical information. A significant challenge for public health is to balance the need to protect the health and safety of the U.S. population with the need to protect individual privacy.

### Legal Framework for Privacy and Security

The most well-known federal law dealing with security and privacy for health information is the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 [29]. HIPAA includes the Privacy Rule [30] and the Security Rule [31], which specify actions that healthcare providers and health insurers (covered entities) must take to safeguard Protected Health Information (PHI) and define the rights of individuals with respect to their own PHI. Compliance with the Privacy Rule is enforced by the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Civil Rights (OCR).

The Privacy Rule allows covered entities to release PHI to public health authorities without individual authorization but restricts such release to the "minimum necessary" for the intended purposes and requires an accounting of all disclosures [32, 33]. However, interpretations of HIPAA privacy requirements for public health vary from state to state, and some public health agencies and laboratories are subject to all HIPAA requirements due to their covered functions.

Other relevant laws include the U.S. Constitution, the Privacy Act of 1974 [34], the E-Government Act of 2002 [35], and Section 242m of the Public Health and Welfare Act [36], which impose additional privacy and confidentiality protections for specific types of information.

### Security Challenges and Risk Dependencies

Public health faces several ethical and political considerations in balancing the health and safety of the U.S. population with the protection of individual privacy. For example, a local health department that provides healthcare (a covered entity under HIPAA) must manage its dual roles with individuals who are both patients and subjects of investigation. Anonymization methods can protect personal privacy in aggregated data sets, but this may come at the cost of detection sensitivity and specificity. Additionally, creating system accounts and issuing digital certificates for additional personnel during a massive outbreak can impede the response.

Threats that exploit security vulnerabilities can increase risks to both personal privacy and population health. For instance, a threat that spoofs a public health website to capture PHI will increase privacy risk, while a threat that exploits a vulnerability in the access controls of a research facility dedicated to vaccine development will increase health risk. Unlike identity theft, the economic drivers for PHI theft have not yet emerged, primarily because health information traditionally has not been as valuable as financial information.

In conclusion, achieving and maintaining an optimal balance between public health and individual privacy requires careful consideration of legal, ethical, and practical challenges. Effective policies and technologies, such as the least-privilege principle and anonymization methods, can help mitigate these risks.
