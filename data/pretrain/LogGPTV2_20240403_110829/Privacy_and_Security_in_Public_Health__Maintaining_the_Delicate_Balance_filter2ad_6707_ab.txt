Biosurveillance  is  the  automated  monitoring  of

two  major 
surveillance  methods.    First,  well  established  public 
health  surveillance  methods  used  in  epidemiologic 
investigations  of  infectious  disease  outbreaks  and 
environmental conditions are used to provide baseline 
comparisons  and  to  help  confirm  the  accuracy  and 
reliability  of  biosurveillance  findings.  Second,  near 
real-time,  automated  analysis  of  cases  and  suspect 
cases,  along  with  statistical  analysis  and  data 
visualization  of  pre-diagnostic  and  diagnostic  data, 
support  the  earliest  possible  detection  of  events  that 
may signal a public health emergency, and can provide 
continuing  situational  awareness  throughout  a  public 
health  response  [20].    Biosurveillance  systems  are 
being developed at the local, state, and national levels 
[19, 21, 22, 23, 24]. 
Figure 1 depicts a timeline from initial exposure to 
a biological agent to final diagnosis and treatment, and 
identifies some of the types of data available at various 
points [25].  Biosurveillance might use any number of 
the illustrative data types (and others) available from 
initial  exposure  to  final  diagnosis  to  detect  patterns 
indicative of a potential outbreak or bioterrorist attack.   
Sensor  technology  can  be  used  to  detect  biological 
events near the time of initial exposure to a biological 
agent.    An  example  is  the  Department  of  Homeland 
Security’s  BioWatch,  which  uses  sensors  to  detect 
trace amounts of biological materials in the air.  These 
environmental data can assist public health analysts in 
determining  the  presence  and  geographic  extent  of  a 
biological  agent  release,  enabling  federal,  state,  and 
local  officials  to  more  quickly  detect  and respond  to 
biological  events.    BioWatch  operates  nationwide, 
focusing on major urban centers [26]. 
Syndromic surveillance is a type of biosurveillance 
used primarily for early detection.  The principal data 
sources  for  syndromic  surveillance  are  healthcare 
utilization  patterns  and  pre-diagnostic  clinical  data  – 
information  indicative  of  a  need  for  health  care, 
beginning with the initial onset of symptoms, perhaps

Such patterns are monitored  in  real time  for the  first 
signs of a covert biological attack or disease outbreak, 
which  may  appear  as  clusters  of  infected  victims 
seeking health care [27].  A pattern of ill individuals 
exhibiting  similar  behavioral  patterns,  symptoms, 
signs, or preliminary laboratory  findings could be an 
indicator of an emerging disease outbreak.  Examples 
of syndromic surveillance systems in development and 
use today are the Department of Defense’s prototype

and  BioSense,  being  implemented  in  hospitals  and

becomes increasingly specific and person-centric.  For 
example,  the  air  samplings  collected  by  BioWatch 
contain  no  personal  health  information,  while  NND 
case reports sent to local and state health departments 
contain detailed personal and clinical information.  A 
confirmed diagnosis or treatment plan that includes the 
patient’s  name 
is  very  personal  and  potentially 
damaging to the individual should it be disclosed.  A 
significant  challenge  for  public  health  is  to  achieve 
and maintain an optimal balance between assuring the 
health and safety of the U.S. population and protecting 
the privacy of individuals within that population.   
4. Legal Framework for Privacy and 
Security Protection in Public Health 
for 
of  Community-based 
The  privacy  sensitivity  of  information  useful  to 
public health surveillance increases as the information 
Arguably 
the  most  well-known  and  widely 
discussed  federal  law  dealing  with  security  and 
privacy for health information is the Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996, 
Proceedings of the 22nd Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC'06)0-7695-2716-7/06 $20.00  © 2006which called for the adoption of a number of standards 
to  enable  and  encourage  the  use  and  exchange  of 
electronic  health  information  [29].    Principal  among 
these  standards  were  the  Privacy  Rule  [30]  and  the 
Security  Rule  [31].    The  Privacy  Rule  specifies  the 
actions  that healthcare  providers  and health  insurers, 
known  as  “covered  entities,”  must  take  to  safeguard 
Protected  Health  Information  (PHI)  and  defines  the 
rights  of  individuals  with  respect  to  their  own  PHI.  
The  Security  Rule  specifies  administrative,  physical, 
and  technical  safeguards  that  covered  entities  must 
either  implement  or  consider.    Compliance  with  the 
Privacy Rule is enforced by the Department of Health 
and Human Services Office of Civil Rights (OCR). 
The  Privacy  Rule  explicitly  enables  covered 
entities  to  release  PHI  to  public  health  authorities 
without  individual  authorization,  but  restricts  such 
release to the “minimum necessary”  for the purposes 
intended  and  requires  an  accounting  of  all  such 
disclosures  (See  Figure  2).    The  CDC has  published 
guidance on the interpretation of the Privacy Rule for 
public  health  [32],  and  the  OCR  has  developed  a 
Decision  Tool  to  assist  emergency  responders  in 
interpreting the Privacy Rule as it might apply to their 
planning and response activities [33]. 
However, HIPAA privacy requirements for public 
health  are not as  straight-forward as  they  may  seem, 
and  interpretations  vary  from  state  to  state.    One 
source  of  ambiguity  is  that  some  public  health 
agencies  and  laboratories  perform  covered  functions, 
such as diagnostic testing and providing patient care, 
making them “covered entities” subject to compliance 
with  all  HIPAA  requirements.    Also,  although  the 
Privacy Rule authorizes covered entities to release PHI 
to  public  health  authorities,  those  authorities  must 
comply with applicable federal and state privacy laws, 
which take precedence over regulation.  
The  U.S.  Constitution  establishes 
legal 
foundation for privacy protection, and the Privacy Act 
of 1974 [34] defines privacy requirements for federal 
agencies.  The Privacy Act prohibits the disclosure of 
individual records without the prior written consent of 
the  individual, requires  accountability  of  disclosures, 
and specifies exceptions.  Among the exceptions is the 
protection of the health and safety of individuals and 
the public.   
The  E-Government  Act  of  2002  [35]  defines  the 
responsibilities  of  federal  agencies  in  protecting  the 
privacy  of  personal  electronic 
in 
government information systems.  A key requirement 
is the conduct of a privacy impact assessment prior to 
developing  or  procuring  any  information  system  that 
collects,  maintains,  or  disseminates 
identifiable 
information.    Title  III,  the  “Federal  Information 
Security Management Act of 2002,” specifies required 
information 
the 
security  controls  to  protect  confidentiality,  integrity, 
and availability.   
More specific to public health, Section 242m [36] 
(see  Figure  3)  of  the  Public  Health  and  Welfare  Act 
(Title  42)  prohibits  public  health  authorities  from 
disclosing  information  identifying  an  individual  or 
establishment,  or  using  that  information  for  any 
purpose other than the purposes intended, without the 
consent  of  that  establishment  or  individual.  Section

specific types of information, including developmental

allowed  to  share  a  single  account  on  an  outbreak 
management  system,  how  might  the  security  risk 
measure  up  against  the  health  risk  of  not  having 
enough people to handle a response?  The bioterrorist 
threat  is  only  making  public  health  decisions  more 
difficult.    For  example,  what  security  measures  are 
strong enough to manage the risk that pathogens and 
toxins  used 
in  microbiology  research  might  be 
misused as agents of bioterrorism?  
Figure  4  depicts  a  risk  model  representing  the 
complex  interplay  among  concepts  and  relationships 
that  must  be  considered  in  order  to  protect  public 
health  while  respecting  and  preserving  personal 
privacy.    As  shown  in  this  model,  both  personal 
privacy  and  population  health  are  subject  to  risks.  
Security  countermeasures  that  provide  confidentiality 
protection  can  reduce  risk 
to  personal  privacy.  
Security  countermeasures  that  protect  data  integrity 
and service availability can reduce risk to population  
health by helping assure that public health data are not 
corrupted and that critical systems and information are 
available  when  they  are  needed.    However,  when 
security  measures

syndromic  surveillance  system  or  impede  a  response

On the other hand, disease surveillance systems and 
outbreak  response  systems  can  possess  security 
vulnerabilities  that  increase  risk  to  personal  privacy.  
For  example,  a  syndromic  surveillance  system  that 
collects  all  data  elements  within  an  electronic  health 
record, rather than a restricted, de-identified data set, 
increases risk to privacy.  Security policy can serve as 
a  countermeasure  to  reduce  these  risks.    The  least-
privilege  principle 
the  HIPAA 
“minimum  necessary”  requirement  is  such  a  policy.  
This policy can be applied not only to the release of 
PHI from a covered entity to a local health authority, 
but also to sharing information between local and state 
levels, and between state and federal levels.  In other 
words, at each level, what is the minimum information 
public  health  officials  need  to  know  to  effectively 
protect the health of their constituency?

Threats  can  exploit  security  vulnerabilities  to 
increase risks to either personal privacy or population 
health.    For  example,  a  threat  that  spoofs  a  public 
health  web  site  to  capture  PHI  will  increase  privacy 
risk, while a threat that exploits a vulnerability in the 
access controls guarding entry into a research facility 
dedicated  to  the  development  of  vaccines  to  protect 
against anthrax attack will increase the health risk to 
the surrounding population.  Unlike identity theft, the 
economic drivers for PHI theft have not yet emerged, 
primarily because  health information traditionally has

In  seeking  to  achieve  and  effectively  maintain  an 
optimal balance between assuring the health and safety 
of  the  U.S.  population  and  protecting  the  privacy  of 
individuals within that population, public health must 
address  a  number  of  difficult  ethical  and  political 
considerations at all levels.  For example, how can a 
local health department that provides health care (i.e., 
a “covered entity” under HIPAA) effectively manage 
its dual roles with an individual who is both a patient 
and 
investigation?  
Anonymization  methods  can  be  used  to  protect 
personal privacy in aggregated data sets – but at what 
sacrifice of detection sensitivity and specificity?  If an 
outbreak  is  detected  within  a  de-identified  data  set, 
how is the expedience of intervention and containment 
impaired  by  having  to  trace  back  to  re-identify 
affected individuals?  How  can an individual’s DNA 
be  effectively  de-identified?    If  a  massive  outbreak 
occurs  and  additional  people  are  recruited  to  help 
collect case information and trace contacts, how might 
the  response  be  impeded  by  having  to  first  create 
system  accounts  and  issue  individual  X.509  digital
