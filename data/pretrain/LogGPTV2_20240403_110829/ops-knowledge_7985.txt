"A": "Always use the largest available integer type to prevent overflow situations.",
"B": "Implement strict protocol conformance to ensure out-of-bounds behavior is identified.",
"C": "Rely exclusively on client-side validation for performance efficiency.",
"D": "Utilize a vetted library that provides constructs to handle integers safely."
