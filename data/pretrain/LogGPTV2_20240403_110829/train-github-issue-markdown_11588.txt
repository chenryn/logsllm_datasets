  * Electron version: 1.3.1
  * Operating system: OS X 10.11.5
Electron will crash/hang if attempting to use the Application Menu when a
webview has not been made visible, in this case contained within a div with
'style="display: none"'
Run sample app to replicate - 'electron main.js'
Manually clear style on container div to cause webview to display, no longer
crashes on use of app menu.
Does not error in Windows
