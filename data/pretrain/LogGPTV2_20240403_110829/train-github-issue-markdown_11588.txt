### Issue Description

**Electron Version:** 1.3.1  
**Operating System:** macOS 10.11.5

**Problem:**
Electron crashes or hangs when attempting to use the Application Menu if a `webview` element is not visible. Specifically, this occurs when the `webview` is contained within a `div` with the style attribute set to `display: none`.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. **Run the Sample Application:**
   - Execute the sample application using the command: `electron main.js`

2. **Reproduce the Crash:**
   - Attempt to use the Application Menu while the `webview` is hidden (i.e., the containing `div` has the style `display: none`).

3. **Resolve the Crash:**
   - Manually clear the `style="display: none"` attribute on the container `div` to make the `webview` visible.
   - The crash should no longer occur when using the Application Menu.

### Additional Information

- This issue does not occur on Windows.
- For reference, the sample application is provided in the `browser.zip` file.
