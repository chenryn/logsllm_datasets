Continuation of the discussion here which is a bit stale at this point: #5410
The docs currently have 4 sections
  * Manual 
    * This has two pages at present, a very useful "Creating a scene" page and a kind of orphaned looking page on matrix transformations
  * Reference 
    * This still needs some expansion in places, but should now be a complete API reference (as of r83). (ping me if you find mistakes, of which I'm sure there are more a few!)
  * Examples 
    * This is very incomplete
  * Developer Reference 
    * Also very incomplete
The Wiki is a bit of a mess at the moment but has
  * TODO (things to be developed in Three)
  * JSON reference
  * link to migration guide
  * code style guide
  * FAQ section which largely link to github issues
  * various manual type articles
  * "On the Net" section with links to all kind of Three related info across the net (some broken and some out of date)
@mrdoob you mentioned here #10342 that you'd like the JSON reference to stay
in the Wiki (although you also said in #5410 that everything should go in the
docs :p )
I have two suggestions:
  1. Everything goes in the docs. Get rid of the Wiki
  2. Split like so:
  * Docs: Everything related to using Three
  * Wiki: Everything related to developing Three
Obviously there would be some crossover in 2. but in ambiguous cases the docs
should be preferred.
