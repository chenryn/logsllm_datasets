Fig. 4. Per-port α: blocked versus total inferences over observed BGP preﬁxes
Figure 4 shows the relative incidence of port blocking by giving p versus αp
for αp > 0 ∀p. We use p = 6969 as a control group as this port is unassociated
with any applications or vulnerabilities and is typically unblocked.
We highlight only the most interesting results due to space constraints. The
most frequently blocked port is 136, the collateral damage port which we discuss
in (§4). The three lowest αp in descending order are HTTP, Control and Gnutella
which matches our intuitive notion of commonly open ports and serves as a
methodology litmus test. Email ports (25, 110, 161, 143) are more than twice
as likely to be blocked as our control port. Port 1434 was widely blocked due to
a worm [8] and shows prominently three years after the initial outbreak. FTP,
SSH, Bittorrent and VPNs round out the remaining top blocked ports.
Manual inspection of the BGP preﬁxes to which blocking is attributed reveals
several ISPs and universities blocking outgoing P2P ports (1214, 4662, 6346,
6881). We ﬁnd Canadian and US ISPs as well as a Polish VoIP preﬁx blocking
Skype. Email, especially outbound port 25 (SMTP) is blocked by several large
cable and DSL Internet providers as well as large hosting services.
3.3 Measurement Bias
We obtain unbiased measurements from a non-trivial portion of the Internet
(≈ 31k BGP preﬁxes, cf. Table 2). However, our methodology cannot obtain
measurements from networks which use content ﬁltering to disallow Gnutella
(the RSP listens on the non-default port 30494 to avoid port ﬁltering). Thus,
any extrapolation of our results to a characterization of the larger Internet is
potentially biased. Networks that we have yet to measure could block more or
fewer ports or diﬀerent ports than those seen in existing results.
Since we wish to measure service provider discriminatory blocking, we analyze
our data on the basis of BGP preﬁx aggregates. We reason, but do not prove, that
while an individual customer of an ISP, say a corporation or university, may block
Gnutella, it is unlikely that of the ISP’s customers ISP block Gnutella. A single

reachable node facilitates inference for that ISP. The breadth and scope of the
BGP preﬁxes for which we have data suggest that the qualitative characteristics
of blocking in our sample is likely representative of a signiﬁcant fraction of the
Internet. Our ongoing work seeks to further substantiate this characterization.
4 Discussion, Future Research and Conclusion
Understanding common operational practices on the Internet is particularly im-
portant as these practices are under close scrutiny in the network neutrality
debates. While our data cannot answer which practices should be acceptable,
the distribution of practices across diﬀerent types of providers (c.f. academic
and commercial) may provide insights into provider intentions.
For instance, the MIT network drops traﬃc destined for TCP ports 135 and
137-139, ports associated with Microsoft ﬁle sharing. With the same intent, but
slightly diﬀerent eﬀect, Comcast residential broadband blocks the entire 135-139
port range [11]. Interestingly, Comcast’s policy results in the collateral blocking
of port 136, assigned to the innocuous Proﬁle naming service [2]. The fact that
MIT and other non-proﬁt organizations block the Windows ﬁle sharing ports
potentially provides justiﬁable evidence that Comcast’s intentions in blocking
the same ports are not abuses of market power. Indeed, here the motivation for
blocking is based upon operators’ concerns for end-user security and privacy.
Given the infancy of our scheme and the broader evolution of network neutral-
ity, we expect this work to pose as many questions as it answers. By continuing
to collect data, we can form a more complete picture of blocking, not only in
terms of ports but also networks, autonomous systems and addresses.
Beyond the methodology in this paper there are several interesting and hard
data analysis problems we plan to investigate. First, port-speciﬁc traceroutes to
clients in our study could reveal ingress properties, ﬁltering asymmetry and yield
useful path information. By ﬁnding partially coincident AS paths with opposite
blocking policies, we can infer where in the network blocking occurs. Finally, our
data can shed light on the evolution of blocking over time.
Our results represent some of the ﬁrst measurements in the space of neu-
trality and discrimination. We hope our ﬁndings will better inform the network
neutrality debate by providing data on which to make informed decisions.
