### Figure 4: Per-Port α: Blocked versus Total Inferences over Observed BGP Prefixes

Figure 4 illustrates the relative incidence of port blocking by plotting \( p \) versus \( \alpha_p \) for all ports where \( \alpha_p > 0 \). We use port 6969 as a control group because it is unassociated with any applications or vulnerabilities and is typically unblocked.

Due to space constraints, we highlight only the most interesting results. The most frequently blocked port is 136, which is known as the collateral damage port (discussed in §4). The three ports with the lowest \( \alpha_p \) values, in descending order, are HTTP, Control, and Gnutella. This aligns with our intuitive understanding of commonly open ports and serves as a validation of our methodology.

Email ports (25, 110, 143, and 993) are more than twice as likely to be blocked compared to our control port. Port 1434 was widely blocked due to a worm [8] and remains prominently blocked three years after the initial outbreak. FTP, SSH, BitTorrent, and VPNs round out the remaining top blocked ports.

Manual inspection of the BGP prefixes associated with these blockings reveals several ISPs and universities blocking outgoing P2P ports (1214, 4662, 6346, and 6881). We also find Canadian and US ISPs, as well as a Polish VoIP prefix, blocking Skype. Email, especially outbound port 25 (SMTP), is blocked by several large cable and DSL Internet providers, as well as large hosting services.

### 3.3 Measurement Bias

We obtain unbiased measurements from a significant portion of the Internet (approximately 31,000 BGP prefixes, see Table 2). However, our methodology cannot measure networks that use content filtering to disallow Gnutella (the RSP listens on the non-default port 30494 to avoid port filtering). Therefore, any extrapolation of our results to characterize the larger Internet may be biased. Networks that we have not yet measured could block more, fewer, or different ports than those observed in our current data.

To measure service provider discriminatory blocking, we analyze our data based on BGP prefix aggregates. While an individual customer of an ISP, such as a corporation or university, may block Gnutella, it is unlikely that a majority of the ISP's customers would do so. A single reachable node within a BGP prefix can facilitate inference for that ISP. The breadth and scope of the BGP prefixes for which we have data suggest that the qualitative characteristics of blocking in our sample are likely representative of a significant fraction of the Internet. Our ongoing work aims to further substantiate this characterization.

### 4. Discussion, Future Research, and Conclusion

Understanding common operational practices on the Internet is crucial, especially in the context of network neutrality debates. While our data cannot determine which practices should be acceptable, the distribution of practices across different types of providers (e.g., academic and commercial) may provide insights into provider intentions.

For example, the MIT network drops traffic destined for TCP ports 135 and 137-139, which are associated with Microsoft file sharing. Comcast residential broadband blocks the entire 135-139 port range [11]. Interestingly, Comcast’s policy results in the collateral blocking of port 136, assigned to the innocuous Profile naming service [2]. The fact that MIT and other non-profit organizations block the Windows file sharing ports suggests that Comcast’s intentions in blocking the same ports are not abuses of market power but rather motivated by security and privacy concerns.

Given the early stage of our scheme and the evolving nature of network neutrality, this work raises as many questions as it answers. By continuing to collect data, we aim to form a more complete picture of blocking, not only in terms of ports but also networks, autonomous systems, and addresses.

Beyond the methodology presented in this paper, there are several challenging data analysis problems we plan to investigate. For instance, port-specific traceroutes to clients in our study could reveal ingress properties, filtering asymmetry, and useful path information. By finding partially coincident AS paths with opposite blocking policies, we can infer where in the network blocking occurs. Additionally, our data can shed light on the evolution of blocking over time.

Our results represent some of the first measurements in the space of network neutrality and discrimination. We hope our findings will better inform the network neutrality debate by providing data on which to make informed decisions.
