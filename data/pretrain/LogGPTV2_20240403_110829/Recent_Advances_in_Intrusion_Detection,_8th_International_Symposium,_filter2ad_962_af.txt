### Capability to Intercept External Connection Attempts and Forge Responses

The capability to intercept an external connection attempt and forge a corresponding response remains an open question in terms of its effectiveness against subsequent counter-measures employed by worms.

### Limitations of the Current Prototype

The current prototype is limited to Linux worms, although the design principles and concepts can be applied to build vGrounds for Windows worms. A significant challenge in extending the vGround implementation for Windows worms is developing highly scalable system virtualization and customization techniques for Windows systems. However, recent advancements in system virtualization technologies, such as VMware ESX server [13] and hardware virtualization support like Intelâ€™s Vanderpool technology [24], show promise in addressing this challenge. Once these technologies become available, they can be leveraged to support Windows-based vGrounds.

#### Testbeds for Destructive Experiments

- **DETER Project [10]**: The DETER project provides a shared testbed for researchers to conduct a wide variety of security experiments. With a pool of physical machines across multiple sites, DETER offers each researcher a virtually dedicated experiment environment on-demand. The granularity of resource allocation is typically one physical node. The vGround software platform can be deployed in the DETER testbed to provide enhanced worm experiment services, offering features such as easy recovery, larger scale, and confinement.
  
- **Netbed [50], Modelnet [47], and PlanetLab [7]**: These are valuable and accessible testbeds for general networking and distributed system experiments. The vGround platform can potentially be deployed in these testbeds to enhance their support for destructive worm experiments. For example, PlanetLab and Modelnet currently do not support worm experiments, especially those involving kernel-level damages (e.g., kernel-level rootkit installation).

- **Anti-Virus Industry Testbeds**: The anti-virus industry has long been building worm testbeds, including virtualization-based ones, for timely capture and analysis of worms. These testbeds are primarily for in-house use by skilled and specially trained experts. One pioneering industry testbed is Internet-in-a-Box [48] built at IBM, which uses virtual machines and virtual networks. While sharing the principle of system and network virtualization, vGrounds do not require dedicated network connections and administrator privileges. Additionally, vGrounds impose lower user skill requirements by automating vGround generation and deployment, and support virtual routers and user-specified network topologies. However, vGrounds currently do not support Windows worms.

#### VM-Based Worm Investigation

- **Virtual Machines (VMs)**: VMs provide an isolated virtualization layer for running and observing untrusted services and applications. Notable VM technologies include VMware [13], User-Mode Linux (UML) [30], Denali [49], and Xen [26]. VM technologies have been extensively used to study worms, often deployed as honeypots to capture worms during their early propagation stages. Advanced VM-based forensic platforms like ReVirt [31] enhance individual VMs with efficient logging and replay capabilities for intrusion analysis, allowing researchers to replay worm exploitation processes instruction-by-instruction.

- **Network Virtualization**: Recent research has focused on creating "virtual testbeds" on shared distributed infrastructures. Examples include X-bone [45], VNET [43], and VIOLIN [32]. X-bone and VNET create a "virtual Internet" that does not hide the underlying physical hosts and network connections, making them unsuitable for confining worm traffic within the virtual Internet. VIOLIN, a previous effort in network virtualization, does not provide automatic virtual network generation and bootstrapping.

#### Honeypot Systems

- **vGround vs. Honeypot Systems**: A vGround itself is not a honeypot system. Honeypot systems, such as Honeyd [40], are connected to and interact with the real Internet, while vGrounds are isolated virtual environments for replaying worm behavior. Honeypot systems and vGrounds complement each other. A promising integration would involve using honeypot systems to capture real-world worms and then using vGrounds to run the captured worms in a realistic but isolated environment, facilitating the automatic capture and characterization of 0-day worms.

### Conclusion

The vGround platform enables impact-confined and resource-efficient experiments with Internet worms. Key features of vGrounds, supported by a suite of virtualization-based techniques, allow researchers to run and observe real-world worms, including their network space targeting, propagation patterns, exploitation steps, and malicious payloads. These results are critical for developing worm detection and defense mechanisms, which can also be tested in vGrounds. For worm researchers, the vGround platform supports iterative experiment workflows with efficiency and convenience, making a timely contribution to worm detection and defense research.
