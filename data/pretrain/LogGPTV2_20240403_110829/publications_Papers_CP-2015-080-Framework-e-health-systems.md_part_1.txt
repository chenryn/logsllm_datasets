Introduction
Rising healthcare costs have become an issue in many countries. Understanding the role and impact of
careflows (sequences of healthcare activities) can help institutions in reducing expenditures, increase
efficiency and quality of patient care. We present a careflow-based framework that proposes advances for
the next generation of e-health systems and services. It brings together key disciplines around five
process-centered areas: discovery, compliance, execution, monitoring and analysis, and collaboration to
enable the development of process-aware end-to-end systems (Dumas et al., 2005).
The goal of discovery is to ascertain actual healthcare processes by extracting knowledge from event logs
(i.e., hospital information systems, medical equipment, and patient information). Our framework
proposes to use careflow mining (van der Aalst1, 2009; van der Aalst2, 2009) to identify, from evidences
of normal operation, how care processes are de facto performed. For instance, patients receiving medical
assistance leave traces of information that can be used to reconstitute the careflows that the patients were
subject to in a bottom-up manner, providing a more realist picture of how the organization operates than
a traditional top-down modeling could. Once discovered, we move on to ensure that careflows meet the
requirements of healthcare guidelines (GL), protocols, procedural manuals, code of practice, and laws.
Research has shown that information systems are an effective way to increase the compliance of
treatments (Kawamoto, 2005; Purcell, 2005; Albert, 2007). Once evaluated as compliant, careflows serve
as blueprints to manage patients’ treatments by using a flexible CareFlow Management Systems (CfMS),
since traditional business process management systems (BPMS) are too strict to deal with the inherent
variability that exists in healthcare processes. During the execution of careflows, Healthcare Business
Intelligence provides methods and applications for gathering, storing, analyzing, and access to careflow
data to help a better decision-making process. So far, little research has been directed towards analysis
and monitoring of processes (Grigori et al, 2004, Deutch, 2008, Beeri et al, 2007). Horizontal to all these
four key areas, collaboration platforms with professional social networks and social communities of
practice support sharing, commenting and managing of careflows. This type of communities is an
important catalyst of social processes (de Moor, 2005) and is driving the evolution of socio-technical
systems (Wenger et al., 2002).
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we present the proposed framework and
discuss its five core areas, guiding the reader from introduction to implications in each. Section 3
describes our research methodology just before our conclusion in section 4.

Careflow mining (1) is concerned with new techniques and algorithms to identify the de facto care
workflows that are in place at the hospital (van der Aalst, 2009). Instead of relying on business analysts to
manually identify, graphically design, and document those processes – a costly and time consuming
procedure – our approach automatically discovers these high-level workflows by reverse engineering
them from traces that everyday operation leaves in the various hospital systems, such as calendars, lab
equipment, and billing systems. After the discovery process, the resulting workflows are analyzed for
compliance (Panzarasa, 2007) with clinical practice guidelines, protocols, and best practices stated in
national and international laws and regulations (2). Doctors and hospital administrators can manually
adjust the careflows to eliminate non-compliances, after which they are deployed to the CareFlow
Management System (CfMS), a specialized Business Process Management System (Cardoso and van der
Aalst, 2009) for healthcare environments (3). This engine implements a flexible execution, called guiding
mode, which allows for deviations from standard procedure when justified. Nevertheless, for quality
assurance and adherence to regulations, a rule engine detects any non-compliant behavior. Being the
blueprints for all patient-related processing, careflows provide a 360º view on them, by integrating all
disparate healthcare data that is usually spread out across various systems. Business Intelligence (Grigori
et al, 2004) comes next (4), as key performance indicators (KPIs) are collected in real-time from the
careflows. Data on compliance violations, on the quality of lab tests, on missing information in records,
among others, enables decision-makers to take grounded decisions about process tuning. Finally, a
collaborative platform (5) brings together healthcare professionals so that they can contribute with their
knowledge. Collective intelligence is leveraged using professional social networks to focus on particular
aspects of social processes (de Moor, 2005) and support socio-technical systems (Wenger et al., 2002).
In the following sections, each of these key areas is analyzed in detail. For each, we introduce the context
and objectives, followed by challenges, state-of-the-art, and proposed innovations and its implications.

Careflow Mining
Context and objectives
Typically, people involved in careflows only have a limited or idealized view of how these processes are
executed. That is, they tend to have an ideal scenario in mind, which, in reality, is only one of the many
possible unfoldings of the workflow. On the other hand, manually designing careflows is too costly and
time consuming. Process mining is of great value in this context, as it aims at extracting process-related
information from event logs created by existing hospital systems that record information about careflows
that have been executed. Since the availability of medical personnel is typically limited and scarce, it is
important that the obtained process insights can be quickly communicated to the medical personnel and,
thus, contribute to enable a better decision-making for hospital administrators.
This reality leads to the following two objectives. First, since a wide variety of systems that record careflow
information can be found in healthcare institutions, in order to obtain useful and trustworthy event logs it
is essential to develop a classification of systems providing guidance into the identification and
integration of different sources of data, and the inherent problems that are related to it. Second, since
careflows are known to be highly variable, poorly structured, and cross multiple medical disciplines, it is
necessary to develop new mining techniques which effectively describe the careflow under consideration,
showing the ordering of activities, and the actors of the medical disciplines that are involved.
State-of-the-art and challenges
Almost all mining algorithms present a discovered careflow as a procedural/imperative model. Procedural
languages are suitable for repetitive processes with tight control but fail in representing flexible processes
(Chesani et al., 2009). Consequently, mining results obtained from flexible careflows are unstructured
and hard to understand. Conversely, declarative process languages describe a process by means of
constraints: any execution that does not violate constraints is possible, which makes them a better fit for
flexible careflows (van der Aalst and Günther, 2009; Pesic and van der Aalst, 2006). So far little research
has been done on the discovery of declarative models. Current approaches heavily rely on the availability
of negative information, i.e. behavior will never occur or is forbidden to occur (Chesani et al., 2009;
Ferreira and Ferreira, 2006; Goedertier, 2008; Cataffi et al., 2010). However, event logs do not record
what cannot happen, but rather what did. Additionally, the quality of process models leaves much to be
desired (van der Aalst1, 2009, van der Aalst2, 2009). For example, models are not tailored towards a
specific purpose. Also, they tend to show irrelevant details and do not show that some activities or process
paths are more important than others (Günther and van der Aalst, 2007, van der Aalst1, 2009, van der
Aalst2, 2009).
Providing the needed classification for the heterogeneous systems in a healthcare institution and the
guidance on how to obtain process related information in an effective way is far from trivial. Additionally,
current process mining techniques have problems dealing with the flexible nature of careflows. So, the
challenge is to develop mining techniques that are able to capture the variability and low structure that
exists within careflows. Moreover, the obtained mining results need to be communicated in a quick and
convincing way.
Innovation and Implications
It is clear that the mining of declarative models is still in its infancy. So, the development of new less
procedural techniques is necessary. Declarative models are based on constraints that mean that negative
information needs to be available. Advanced techniques need to be developed in which this negative
information can be discovered based on historical data or can be inferred in another way. For the
visualization of careflows the current situation must be dramatically improved, by devoting it specific
attention. Here, we can learn from geographical information systems and the way a car navigation
systems present different types of information (zoom-in/zoom-out, see traffic jams, speed limits etc.).
Additionally, work done in the field of visual analytics needs to be considered. Visual analytics aims at
presenting huge amounts of information in an understandable and interactive way (Mansmann et al.,
2006; van Ham et al., 2008; Volz et al, 2013).

Careflow Compliance
Context and objectives
Non-compliance detection may have different meanings. First, analyzing the careflows automatically
identified by process mining allows discovering systematic differences between expected and real
processes: if any, discussion with medical and administrative experts will help designing a CfMS to be
enacted within healthcare organizations, facilitating professionals to comply with best practices. During
the very first enactment phase, non-compliance detection is useful for the system validation (i.e. the user
can be non-compliant simply because the system provided a bad suggestion, due to a model error). Once
the model flaws have been fixed, and the final CfMS delivered, non-compliance must still be detected: it
helps find human errors, lack of resources, or disagreement with the suggestions (probably due to
patients' peculiarity). After some time, interestingly, non-compliance could also indicate a practice is
becoming obsolete because of new scientific evidence, but the careflow model has not acknowledged this
change yet.
The main objective in careflow compliance is to develop a closed loop system that allows exploiting
quantitative measures of users’ compliance to improve the quality of the delivered care. More precisely,
the loop to close is the life cycle of guidelines and protocols: currently, these documents are updated only
on the basis of new scientific evidence, but users’ feedback is also of paramount importance. Thus, we
propose the development of a technological support for detecting, analyzing and discussing non
compliances, addressing two target users and goals: the careflow users, that more easily will adhere to
best practice, and the guideline/protocol developers, that more quickly will be alerted of any flaw in
careflow logic. These objectives may be achieved by classifying non-compliances according to multiple
axes: a) their severity, that can be measured through the level of scientific evidence supporting the
recommendation, and b) their causes/motivations, taking into account that a non compliance does not
necessarily imply a malpractice.
State-of-the-art and challenges
Despite the great confidence in the potential of evidence-based medicine, compliance with guidelines
(GLs) was and continues to be poor (Cabana, 1999; Eccles, 2002; Leape, 2003; Barner, 2003; Jami,
2007). Several studies show that computerized decision support systems improve clinicians’ compliance
(Kawamoto, 2005; Purcell, 2005; Albert, 2007), particularly if they are fully integrated with the work
processes of clinicians (Sim, 2001). Moreover, it is agreed that documenting clinical activities is of
paramount importance, particularly when a clinician practices outside the guidelines (Pelly, 1998).
Different approaches exist for compliance checking, from computational logic-based frameworks as
GPROVE (Chesani, 2008) to minimally intrusive critiquing systems, giving advice when the user’s
decision is out of the system’s permissible range (van Bemmel, 1997; Panzarasa , 2007). Investigating the
causes of non-compliance is important from the medical practice point of view, see Gilligan (2007)
describing an American study on the compliance with breast cancer guidelines, and Maviglia (2001)
investigating patients’ features which affect physicians' behavior. Interesting approaches were proposed
by (Svatek et al, 2004; Razavi et al, 2007), adopting a data-mining method. Eventually, Case-based
Reasoning has been recently proposed for the automated support of careflow management in general
(Minor 2008, Weber 06), and to careflow monitoring in particular (Petridis 2009).
Careflow compliance detection and analysis involves both technical and socio-technical challenges. First
of all, it requires the formalization of “best practice documents” into computational models (patterns,
