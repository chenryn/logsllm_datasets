### Framework for Next-Generation E-Health Systems and Services

**Full Paper**

#### Introduction

Rising healthcare costs have become a significant issue in many countries. Understanding the role and impact of careflows (sequences of healthcare activities) can help institutions reduce expenditures, increase efficiency, and improve the quality of patient care. This paper presents a careflow-based framework that proposes advancements for the next generation of e-health systems and services. The framework integrates key disciplines around five process-centered areas: discovery, compliance, execution, monitoring and analysis, and collaboration. This integration enables the development of process-aware, end-to-end systems (Dumas et al., 2005).

The goal of **discovery** is to identify actual healthcare processes by extracting knowledge from event logs, such as those generated by hospital information systems, medical equipment, and patient records. Our framework employs careflow mining (van der Aalst, 2009) to uncover how care processes are actually performed. For example, by analyzing the traces left by patients receiving medical assistance, we can reconstruct careflows in a bottom-up manner, providing a more realistic view of organizational operations than traditional top-down modeling.

Once discovered, the next step is to ensure that careflows meet the requirements of healthcare guidelines (GLs), protocols, procedural manuals, codes of practice, and laws. Research has shown that information systems are effective in increasing treatment compliance (Kawamoto, 2005; Purcell, 2005; Albert, 2007). After ensuring compliance, careflows serve as blueprints for managing patient treatments using a flexible CareFlow Management System (CfMS). Traditional business process management systems (BPMS) are too rigid to handle the inherent variability in healthcare processes. During the execution of careflows, Healthcare Business Intelligence provides methods and applications for gathering, storing, analyzing, and accessing careflow data to support better decision-making. Little research has been directed towards the analysis and monitoring of these processes (Grigori et al., 2004; Deutch, 2008; Beeri et al., 2007). Collaboration platforms with professional social networks and communities of practice facilitate the sharing, commenting, and management of careflows. These communities are important catalysts for social processes (de Moor, 2005) and drive the evolution of socio-technical systems (Wenger et al., 2002).

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present the proposed framework and discuss its five core areas, guiding the reader through each. Section 3 describes our research methodology, and Section 4 concludes the paper.

### A Framework for Next-Generation E-Health Systems and Services

Figure 1 illustrates how the five scientific and technological areas underlying the proposed framework for e-health systems and services come together.

**Figure 1: Framework for Next-Generation E-Health Systems and Services**

1. **Careflow Mining**: This area focuses on new techniques and algorithms to identify the actual care workflows in place at hospitals (van der Aalst, 2009). Instead of relying on manual identification and documentation, which is costly and time-consuming, our approach automatically discovers high-level workflows by reverse engineering them from traces left in various hospital systems, such as calendars, lab equipment, and billing systems.

2. **Compliance**: After discovery, the resulting workflows are analyzed for compliance with clinical practice guidelines, protocols, and best practices (Panzarasa, 2007). Doctors and hospital administrators can manually adjust the careflows to eliminate non-compliances. These adjusted careflows are then deployed to the CareFlow Management System (CfMS), a specialized Business Process Management System (Cardoso and van der Aalst, 2009) for healthcare environments. The CfMS implements a flexible execution mode, allowing for deviations from standard procedures when justified, while a rule engine ensures quality assurance and adherence to regulations.

3. **Execution**: The careflows serve as blueprints for all patient-related processing, integrating disparate healthcare data spread across various systems. Business Intelligence (Grigori et al., 2004) collects key performance indicators (KPIs) in real-time from the careflows. Data on compliance violations, lab test quality, and missing information in records enable decision-makers to make informed decisions about process tuning.

4. **Monitoring and Analysis**: This area involves the continuous monitoring and analysis of careflows to ensure they meet the required standards and to identify areas for improvement. Real-time data collection and analysis provide insights into the effectiveness of care processes and help in making data-driven decisions.

5. **Collaboration**: A collaborative platform brings together healthcare professionals to share their knowledge. Collective intelligence is leveraged through professional social networks, focusing on specific aspects of social processes (de Moor, 2005) and supporting socio-technical systems (Wenger et al., 2002).

In the following sections, each of these key areas is analyzed in detail. For each, we introduce the context and objectives, followed by challenges, state-of-the-art, and proposed innovations and their implications.

### Careflow Mining

#### Context and Objectives

Typically, individuals involved in careflows have a limited or idealized view of how these processes are executed. They often have an ideal scenario in mind, which, in reality, is only one of many possible workflows. Manually designing careflows is both costly and time-consuming. Process mining is valuable in this context as it aims to extract process-related information from event logs created by existing hospital systems. Given the limited availability of medical personnel, it is crucial that the obtained process insights can be quickly communicated to the medical staff, contributing to better decision-making for hospital administrators.

This leads to two main objectives:
1. Develop a classification of systems to guide the identification and integration of different data sources and address related problems.
2. Develop new mining techniques to effectively describe careflows, showing the ordering of activities and the actors involved from multiple medical disciplines.

#### State-of-the-Art and Challenges

Most mining algorithms present discovered careflows as procedural/imperative models, which are suitable for repetitive processes but fail to represent flexible processes (Chesani et al., 2009). Consequently, mining results from flexible careflows are unstructured and hard to understand. Declarative process languages, which describe processes using constraints, are better suited for flexible careflows (van der Aalst and Günther, 2009; Pesic and van der Aalst, 2006). However, little research has been done on the discovery of declarative models, and current approaches rely heavily on the availability of negative information, which is not typically recorded in event logs. Additionally, the quality of process models leaves much to be desired (van der Aalst, 2009). Models are often not tailored to specific purposes, show irrelevant details, and do not highlight the importance of certain activities or process paths (Günther and van der Aalst, 2007).

The challenge is to develop mining techniques that can capture the variability and low structure within careflows and communicate the results in a quick and convincing way.

#### Innovation and Implications

Developing new, less procedural techniques for mining declarative models is necessary. Advanced techniques need to be developed to discover negative information based on historical data or infer it in other ways. The visualization of careflows must be dramatically improved, drawing inspiration from geographical information systems and car navigation systems. Work in visual analytics, which aims to present large amounts of information in an understandable and interactive way (Mansmann et al., 2006; van Ham et al., 2008; Volz et al., 2013), should also be considered.

**Implication 1**: More predictive, individualized, effective, and safer healthcare.

### Careflow Compliance

#### Context and Objectives

Non-compliance detection can have different meanings. Analyzing careflows identified by process mining allows for the discovery of systematic differences between expected and real processes. Discussions with medical and administrative experts can help design a CfMS to be enacted within healthcare organizations, facilitating compliance with best practices. During the initial enactment phase, non-compliance detection is useful for system validation. Once model flaws are fixed, non-compliance detection helps identify human errors, resource shortages, or disagreements with suggestions. Over time, non-compliance can also indicate that a practice is becoming obsolete due to new scientific evidence.

The main objective is to develop a closed-loop system that uses quantitative measures of user compliance to improve the quality of delivered care. This involves closing the lifecycle of guidelines and protocols, which are currently updated based on new scientific evidence but should also consider user feedback. We propose developing a technological support system for detecting, analyzing, and discussing non-compliances, addressing both careflow users and guideline/protocol developers. Non-compliances can be classified based on their severity and causes, recognizing that non-compliance does not necessarily imply malpractice.

#### State-of-the-Art and Challenges

Despite the potential of evidence-based medicine, compliance with guidelines (GLs) remains poor (Cabana, 1999; Eccles, 2002; Leape, 2003; Barner, 2003; Jami, 2007). Computerized decision support systems improve clinicians’ compliance, particularly when fully integrated with work processes (Sim, 2001). Documenting clinical activities, especially when practicing outside guidelines, is crucial (Pelly, 1998). Different approaches exist for compliance checking, from computational logic-based frameworks like GPROVE (Chesani, 2008) to minimally intrusive critiquing systems (van Bemmel, 1997; Panzarasa, 2007). Investigating the causes of non-compliance is important, as seen in studies on breast cancer guidelines (Gilligan, 2007) and patients' features affecting physicians' behavior (Maviglia, 2001). Data-mining methods (Svatek et al., 2004; Razavi et al., 2007) and case-based reasoning (Minor, 2008; Weber, 2006; Petridis, 2009) have also been proposed.

Careflow compliance detection and analysis involve both technical and socio-technical challenges, including the formalization of "best practice" documents into computational models.
