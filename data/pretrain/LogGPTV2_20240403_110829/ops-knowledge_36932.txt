User: Please describe the basic principles of virtualization technology and introduce common virtualization software.
Assistant: Virtualization technology is a technology that abstracts and isolates computer resources. It can divide a physical computer (host) into multiple virtual computers (virtual machines), and each virtual machine has its own operating system and application program. and independent computing resources. The basic principle of virtualization technology is to abstract the resources of the host machine by running virtualization software on the host machine to form a virtual computer operating environment. Virtualization software is responsible for managing operations such as creation, start, stop, backup, recovery, and scheduling of virtual machines, and at the same time establishes a virtualization layer between the virtual machine and the host machine, so that the virtual machine operating system and applications can directly access the virtualization The computing resources provided by the layer. Common virtualization software includes: 1. VMware VMware is a leading virtualization technology provider, and its virtualization software includes VMware Workstation, VMware Fusion, VMware ESXi and other products. Among them, VMware ESXi is a bare-metal-based virtualization technology that can directly convert a host computer into a virtual machine management server to provide an efficient virtualization solution. 2. Oracle VirtualBox Oracle VirtualBox is a free open source virtualization software that can install and run virtual machines in multiple operating systems and provide advanced features such as clipboard sharing and virtual hardware support. 3. Microsoft Hyper-V Microsoft Hyper-V is a virtualization solution based on the Windows Server operating system, which can divide a physical server into multiple virtual servers, and supports functions such as online migration, backup and recovery of virtual machines . 4. KVM KVM is a virtualization solution based on the Linux kernel, which can run multiple virtual machines on a physical computer and supports multiple operating systems and applications. 5. Xen Xen is a high-performance virtualization software that can run on a variety of operating systems, including Windows, Linux and FreeBSD, etc., with high flexibility and customizable functions.
