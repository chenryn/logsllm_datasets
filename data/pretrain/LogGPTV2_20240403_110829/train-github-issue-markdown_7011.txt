I am using Neo4j 1.9.1. I am getting an incorrect node count in the red bubble
which shows the number of nodes with a given relationship and this behaviour
occurs after I select one of the nodes from that bubble.
To show this, I downloaded the Cineeast database from here. I went to to the
data browser and searched for node 431. That node has 14 nodes with
relationship ACTS_IN coming into it. I clicked on the red bubble with 14 nodes
written in it. I selected node number 434 from the pop-up list. After
selecting that node, the node count displayed went down to 12 instead of 13.
When I click on that red bubble again, I can see that the list has 13 nodes in
it. So the error is in the node count text.
cheers
