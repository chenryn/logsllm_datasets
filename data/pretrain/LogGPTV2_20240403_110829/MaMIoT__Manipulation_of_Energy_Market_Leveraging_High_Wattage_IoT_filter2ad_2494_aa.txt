ABSTRACT
If a trader could predict price changes in the stock market better
than other traders, she would make a fortune. Similarly in the elec-
tricity market, a trader that could predict changes in the electricity
load, and thus electricity prices, would be able to make large prots.
Predicting price changes in the electricity market better than other
market participants is hard, but in this paper, we show that attack-
ers can manipulate the electricity prices in small but predictable
ways, giving them a competitive advantage in the market.
Our attack is possible when the adversary controls a botnet of
high wattage devices such as air conditioning units, which are able
to abruptly change the total demand of the power grid. Such attacks
are called Manipulation of Demand via IoT (MaDIoT) attacks. In
this paper, we present a new variant of MaDIoT and name it Ma-
nipulation of Market via IoT (MaMIoT). MaMIoT is the rst energy
market manipulation cyberattack that leverages high wattage IoT
botnets to slightly change the total demand of the power grid with
the aim of aecting the electricity prices in the favor of specic
market players. Using real-world data obtained from two major en-
ergy markets, we show that MaMIoT can signicantly increase the
prot of particular market players or nancially damage a group
of players depending on the motivation of the attacker.

1 INTRODUCTION
Real-world attacks, as well as demonstration projects, have shown
the eectiveness of cyberattacks against the power grid [31, 35,
63, 64]. These are direct attacks, meaning that they directly target
the critical components (e.g., generators) or the supervision and
control system of the power grids. Recent works, however, have
shown how to attack the power grid indirectly, by compromising
consumer devices (and not devices in the grid) [28, 51]. In partic-
ular, the adversary creates or rents a botnet of high wattage IoT
devices (e.g., an Internet-connected EV charger or water heater),
and then, collectively and abruptly changes the electricity demand
of thousands of these devices (via simultaneously turning them
on/o), creating an unanticipated sudden power surge which can
potentially result in local or regional blackouts [28, 51].
In this paper, we analyze a new unexplored threat from high
wattage IoT botnets: attacks to the deregulated wholesale electric-
ity market [50]. According to the U.S. Energy Information Admin-
istration (EIA), the average price of electricity and total energy
consumption in the U.S. was 75 USD/MWh and 2.935⇥109 MWh,
respectively [55, 56], with approximately 220 billion USD transac-
tions. Such markets can be attractive targets for cybercriminals
around the world and selsh traders who are willing to manipulate
the market.
Market manipulation (creating articial prices) is not a new
problem. In the U.S., the primary purpose of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) is to enforce the law against stock
market manipulation. Recently, security researchers started to study
how botnets can facilitate stock market manipulation [62]. In this
paper, we perform a similar study but in the electricity market.
In a role similar to that of the SEC for the stock market, the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has oversight on
electricity markets in the U.S. and can impose penalties on enti-
ties that manipulate the prices. While there have been multiple
electricity market manipulation cases over the years, none of the
discovered cases so far has been enabled by cyberattacks [45].
The most visible example of electricity market manipulation is
the case of Enron [38]: Enron traders had names for strategies that
they used to manipulate the market. Some of these include “Death
Star,” where traders led nonexistent transmission schedules in
order to get paid to alleviate congestion that did not exist; “Fat
boy”, where traders overscheduled power transmission reecting
nonexistent demand; “Get Shorty” focused on selling power and
services it did not have with the expectation that they would not be
asked to fulll the contract, and “Ricochet” focused on exporting
electricity outside of California, to be latter bought at higher prices

prole case, there are several other traders that have been ned for
manipulating the market over the years, including JPMorgan [16,
21], Louis Dreyfus Energy Services [14], and Barclays [47]. Still,
there may be several other cases of market manipulation that are
not detected [14]. The diculty in proving market manipulation
cases in the power grid might motivate attackers to use cyberattacks
in their eorts to prot from (or shock) the electricity market.
Our proposed attack, which we call Manipulation of Market
via IoT (MaMIoT), exploits the relationship between demand and
price uctuations [8] and manipulates the market prices by slightly
altering the total power consumption of the grid through a high
wattage IoT botnet. This botnet can give a huge advantage to the
malicious participants in the market, as they can predict sudden
(but small) changes in the demand for electricity (changes created
by the botnet). Being able to predict electricity demand changes is
akin to a stockbroker who could predict small uctuations of the
stock prices in advance.
The market manipulation through MaMIoT can be implemented
in two general ways based on the ultimate goal and motivation of
the attacker: i) to provide additional nancial prots for one of the
market players (i.e., the attacker is one of the market players such
as the previously discovered market manipulation cases by FERC);
ii) to cause economic damage to the entire market (i.e., attacker
is a nation-state actor who is doing this as a part of a trade/cold
war). For each of the cases, we develop an optimization model to
maximize the prot (or damage) of a specic market player (or to
the entire market) while keeping the attack as stealthy as possible.
The input data for the optimization models are obtained by crawling
and processing publicly available datasets from ocial electricity
market websites (they can be similarly obtained through a trading
tool called Bloomberg terminal or similar trading software). The
outputs of the optimization models are the timeline of the botnet
activation/deactivation (to realize the manipulated prices) along
with the malicious bids/oers in the electricity market (to realize
the additional attack gain).
The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:
• This is the rst paper in the literature that identies and
analyzes the emerging threat from the high wattage IoT
botnets to the wholesale electricity markets.
• In order to develop successful attacks, we develop optimiza-
tion algorithms to decide when and how to attack, subject
to the constraints of the market, and the power constraints
of the system. Using the optimization models helps us maxi-
mize the attacks’ gains.
• We evaluate and test the eectiveness of the attacks with
real-world traces.
• We propose a set of practical countermeasures to consider-
ably limit the damaging consequences and severity of the
studied attacks.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we
explain the basic structure of electricity markets and their various
players. We then present the threat model and attack feasibility in
Section 3. We develop a formulation of the attack model for dierent
attackers in Section 4. In Section 5, we evaluate the performance
of the proposed approach with real-world case studies. We then
propose a set of practical countermeasures in Section 6. Finally, we
conclude and discuss open research questions in Section 7.
2 BACKGROUND
2.1 Structure of the Electricity Market
There are two main markets for electricity. The wholesale market
focuses on the bulk power grid, while the retail market is where indi-
vidual consumers (e.g., homeowners) interact with electric utilities.
In this paper, we focus on the wholesale market.
Before deregulation of the wholesale market in the 1980s and 90s,
the electricity industry operated as a monopoly, which meant that
generators, transmission lines, substations, and distribution lines
were owned and operated by monopolistic (sometimes government-
owned) utilities. Proposers of deregulation argued that rising elec-
tricity costs were due to the lack of an ecient market.
With deregulation, electric utilities were forced to sell their gen-
eration plants and became wholesale consumers, having to pur-
chase electricity on the spot market everyday. Deregulated mar-
kets also allowed new participants (outside of electric utilities)
to join the wholesale markets such as banks, nancial rms, and
smaller traders; in fact, regulators of the electricity market encour-
age traders to join these markets in the hopes of making them more
ecient. Deregulated electricity markets allow the participation
and competition of multiple energy producers and utilities in the
market providing customers with ecient, cheap, and more reliable
energy [6]. There are in general four major players in the market:
producers (generators), consumers (retailers), a market operator,
and a regulator.
2.1.1 Producers. Generation companies such as nuclear or coal
power plants, hydropower plants, and wind farms mainly fall into
this category where their basic goal is to produce and sell electric
energy. They may also sell services such as frequency regulation,
voltage control, and reserves to help the system operators main-
tain the reliability of the power grid. A generation company can
own a single generator or a portfolio of generators with dierent
technologies [32, 50]. In some cases, nancial companies such as
JPMorgan rent a power plant with multiple generators to partici-
pate in the market and make prots from their trading strategies
[16, 47]. Other traders can also buy electricity from producers and
then sell them in the wholesale market [38]. Electricity prices on
the supply side are highly aected by fuel prices.
2.1.2 Retailers. Retailers buy electrical energy from the wholesale
energy markets and resell it to consumers (e.g., homeowners). Elec-
tric utilities and electric vehicle (EV) aggregators1 are two examples
of such retailers [32, 58], but again, other traders can join the market
and purchase electricity [38]. Consumer prices are highly aected
by weather and economic activity.
2.1.3 Market Operator (MO) or Independent System Operator (ISO).
Market operators (MO), and independent system operators (ISO),
run a computer program to match the bids and oers submitted
by producers and retailers [32]. A responsibility of the ISO is to
clear the market in such a way that it preserves the reliability of
1An EV aggregator is a market player who participates in the wholesale market on
behalf of a certain number of EVs and charges the batteries of these EVs based on a
signed contract.

one geographical area and all consumers in another, the ISO has to
make sure that the power transmission lines have the capacity to
transfer the amount of energy. Therefore, specic bids and oers
that violate the limitations of the power grid, will be removed from
the market to maintain the grid’s stability [32].
2.1.4 Regulator. A regulator is a government organization respon-
sible for ensuring the fair and ecient operation of market players.
This organization monitors the market, studies its environment,
and determines a set of rules to prevent abuse, manipulation, and
fraud by the market players. The regulator also sets the prices for
the products and services that are provided by monopolies or single
parties to preserve fairness in the market [32].
2.2 Day-Ahead and Real-Time Markets
The wholesale market is dierent than various other markets in
that the products cannot be stored, so the production of electricity
has to match the demand for electricity at every point in time,
which in turn can lead to high volatility of electricity prices. To
hedge this price volatility, the market is divided into two parts: the
day-ahead market (which helps stabilize the prices of electricity)
and the real-time market [50].
In the day-ahead market, all players in the market make forecasts
of how much electricity will be needed for the next day, and then
at 12pm, they make oers for the amount of electricity they will
produce (or buy) for every hour of the 24 hours of the next day.
About four hours later the market is cleared by the ISO, and it
releases the specic commitments for each player. For example, if
player 1 submitted a bid for consuming 2MWh for a price of $15
from 3 pm to 4 pm, player 1 has to do that, otherwise, she will be
penalized nancially.
Since predicting the exact energy demand a day in advance is
impossible, the market needs to have a real-time component to
correct prediction errors from the day-ahead market. If the day-
ahead market committed to less generation than what is currently
in demand, players make new bids and oers for electricity. If
the day-ahead market is committed to more generation than what
is currently in demand, the prices of electricity in the real-time
market can plummet and in some cases can become negative (asking
industries to consume electricity and being rewarded for that).
Both markets work the same way. Bids/oers submitted to the
ISO (for the day-ahead or real-time market) at a specic time slot
are shown in Figure 1. As illustrated in the gure, each player of
the market submits a quantity-price pair to the ISO for each time
interval. The ISO sorts the bids/oers based on the suggested prices
and solves the optimization problem expressed in equations (1)–(4)
to maximize the social welfare of the market players and determine
the optimal price of the market at each time slot while satisfying
the power system physical constraints.
