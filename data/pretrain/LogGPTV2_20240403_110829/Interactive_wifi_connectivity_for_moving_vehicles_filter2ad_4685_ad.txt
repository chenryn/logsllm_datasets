# 5.3 Application Performance

Our experiments demonstrate that the resilient link-layer connectivity provided by ViFi translates into superior performance for interactive applications. Specifically, we evaluated the performance of short TCP transfers, which are representative of typical web workloads, and Voice over IP (VoIP). In these experiments, unacknowledged packets are retransmitted by the source up to three times. We found that higher retransmission limits yield similar or slightly worse results.

## 5.3.1 Performance of TCP Transfers

Our TCP experiments assessed two key performance metrics: 
1. The time to complete a transfer.
2. The number of completed transfers in a session, where a session is defined as a period during which no transfer attempt was terminated due to a lack of progress.

The vehicle repeatedly fetches a 10 KB file from a machine connected to the wired network, and the process is repeated in the opposite direction. Transfers that make no progress for ten seconds are terminated and restarted. This limit is imposed because some transfers either hang or take an excessively long time to complete due to packet losses at inopportune times in the TCP exchange.

### Figure 9: TCP Performance in VanLAN
- **(a) Median Transfer Time**
- **(b) Transfers per Session**

Figure 9(a) shows the median time to complete a transfer. To isolate the benefits of diversity and salvaging in ViFi, the middle bar represents the median time for a configuration where diversity was enabled but salvaging was disabled. The results indicate that ViFi's median TCP transfer time is approximately 0.6 seconds, representing a 50% improvement over BRR. This improvement exceeds what would be predicted based on the number of additional packets delivered by the link layer (Figure 2), highlighting the difference between aggregate performance and the performance of interactive applications when using diversity. The figure also shows that most of ViFi’s gain is attributed to diversity, although salvaging provides a noticeable gain of about 10%. Given that only 1.2% of the packets are salvaged, this benefit is disproportionately high, confirming our intuition that a few stuck packets at older basestations can significantly impact TCP performance.

We find that ViFi’s TCP performance is comparable to modern cellular technologies. An EVDO Rev. A-based cellular modem was added to one of our vehicles, and a similar TCP workload was generated. The median connection time in the downlink was 0.75 seconds and in the uplink was 1.2 seconds (cellular data rates are asymmetric).

Figure 9(b) shows the average number of completed transfers per session. The average for ViFi is more than twice that of BRR. Combined with its lower transfer times, this implies that users of ViFi will experience fewer disrupted transfers and better performance for individual transfers.

## 5.3.2 Performance of VoIP Traffic

We evaluated the performance of VoIP sessions over ViFi by measuring the length of uninterrupted sessions. Supporting VoIP is more challenging than TCP because quality is sensitive to both loss and delay. The industry-standard for evaluating a voice call is the Mean Opinion Score (MOS), which ranges from 1 to 5, with labels of perfect (5), fair (4), annoying (3), very annoying (2), and impossible to communicate (1). MOS is a perceptual measure, commonly estimated from an R-factor score [11] as: 1 if R < 100; and 1 + 0.035R + 7×10^(-6)R(R−60)(100−R), otherwise. The R-factor is the sum of four terms: R = 100 − Is − Id − Ief + A, where Is is the signal-to-noise impairments, Id and Ief are impairments due to delay and loss, and A is the expectation factor, which is higher when users expect lower quality. The impairments are functions of the codec.

We used the G.729 codec, which is implemented on most VoIP devices. For simplicity, we set A to zero (though it may be higher given the challenging environment). Then, the R-factor reduces to [11]: 94.2 − 0.024d − 0.11(d − 177.3)H(d − 177.3) − 11 − 40log(1 + 10e), where d is the mouth-to-ear delay (including coding delay, network delay, and jitter buffer delay), e is the total loss rate (including network losses and losses due to late arrivals), and H is the Heaviside step function: H(x) = 1 if x > 0; 0 otherwise.

Per the codec, we generate 20-byte packets every 20 ms. Following convention, we assume a coding delay of 25 ms, a jitter buffer of 60 ms, and a wired segment delay of 40 ms (corresponding to cross-country paths in the USA) for each VoIP packet. Aiming for a mouth-to-ear delay of 177 ms, packets that take more than 52 ms in the wireless part should be considered lost. We measure one-way delays by applying piecewise linear regression [27] to remove clock skew and assuming the minimum one-way delay is identical in both directions.

We quantify VoIP performance using the median length of time between interruptions. An interruption is deemed to have occurred when the MOS value drops below 2 for a three-second period. Three seconds is roughly the time it takes to enunciate a short English sentence, and a MOS value lower than 2 represents a severe disruption in call quality. We are not aware of an existing method to evaluate voice calls when packet delay and loss vary with time, and this definition seemed reasonable to us. We also studied different MOS thresholds and time periods within this framework. Results for those fit the qualitative behavior of Figure 7: the relative advantage of ViFi over BRR increases as the definition of an interruption becomes more stringent.

### Figure 11: Median Length of Uninterrupted VoIP Sessions
- **(a) VanLAN**
- **(b) DieselNet Ch. 1**
- **(c) DieselNet Ch. 6**

Figure 11 shows the results for our deployment on VanLAN and trace-driven simulations based on DieselNet. Because our results indicate that salvaging brings little benefit for VoIP, we do not isolate diversity and salvaging components of ViFi in the figure. The results show that the average session lengths are much longer with ViFi: the gain is over 100% in VanLAN, over 50% in Channel 1 of DieselNet, and over 65% in Channel 6 of DieselNet. We find that the overall call quality with ViFi is better as well. In VanLAN, the average of three-second MOS scores is 3.4 with ViFi and 3.0 with BRR. Thus, our results show that users of ViFi experience better call quality and significantly fewer disruptions in their voice calls.

## 5.4 Efficiency of Medium Usage

The higher application performance of ViFi does not stem from it using the medium more aggressively; in fact, its overall efficiency is comparable to that of BRR. We measure efficiency as the number of application packets delivered per transmission in the channel between the vehicle and the BSes.

### Comparison with PerfectRelay and BRR
In the PerfectRelay protocol, exactly one basestation relays only if the intended destination did not hear the packet. We estimate its efficiency using packet-level logs of ViFi. In the upstream direction, a packet is considered delivered by PerfectRelay if at least one BS hears it. In the downstream direction, a complication is that even if a BS relays the packet, the vehicle may not hear it. We address this by:
1. Assuming the outcome of the relaying will be identical to that of ViFi if at least one of the BSes relayed the packet.
2. Considering the relaying successful if no BS relayed it in ViFi.

### Table 1: Detailed Statistics on the Behavior of ViFi in VanLAN

| Metric | Upstream | Downstream |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Source transmissions that reach the destination | 5 | 3.6 |
| Median number of auxiliary BSes | 2.5 | 74% |
| Average number of auxiliary BSes that hear a source transmission | 1.5 | 26% |
| Average number of auxiliary BSes that hear a source transmission but not the acknowledgment | 98% | 34% |
| Relayed transmissions corresponding to successful source transmissions (i.e., false positives) | 50% | 5 |
| Average number of auxiliary BSes that relay when a false positive relay occurs | 1.7 | 0.6 |
| Cases where at least one auxiliary BS overhears a failed source transmission | 67% | 25% |
| Cases where zero auxiliary BSes relay a failed source transmission (i.e., false negatives) | 33% | 66% |
| Relayed packets that reach the destination | 10% | 100% |
