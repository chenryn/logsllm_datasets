Lessons Learned 
Mistakes cost money. 
Save some by using ours. 
System Design 
vs.  
Knee Jerk Problem Solving 
• Looking ahead 3 steps or more  
• Poor choices today can limit tomorrow’s potential 
• You will crash, learn from your failures 
• Good / Bad decisions 
• MIG vs. EasyStar 
• VIA Epia vs. ARM payload 
• Propeller size 
• Attitude sensor location 
Utilizing what is already 
available 
• This has no custom parts. Everything is easily available 
online 
• The average enthusiast can build and operate this 
• This is what we came up with, not the limit of 
possibilities 
This might not make you 
popular 
• People automatically assume you are an evil bastard 
trying to destroy their hobby / job / life 
• Online communities can see you as a potential threat, so 
don’t expect a lot of hugs and kisses 
• We received threats that we were going to be reported to 
the FAA, FCC, FBI, NSA, NAACP, AARP, GI-Joe, the 
Air Force, Air Traffic Control and our moms if we didn’t 
stop ruining it for everybody 
The Reality Of It All 
• It’s never as hard as it seems, or as easy as it looks 
• Unforeseen issues take up time & money 
• You will crash 
•
Do not expect perfection the first time 
• Cheap is a relative term
