This discrepancy makes comparing file paths very difficult:
    import { join } from "https://deno.land/std/path/mod.ts";
    console.log(Deno.realPathSync("."));
    console.log(join("C:", "Source", "Deno", "fsdisrepancy"));
Prints out this:
    C:/Source/Deno/fsdisrepancy
    C:\Source\Deno\fsdisrepancy
This is very problematic, because a lot of libraries are written using `join`,
and if on some point of your code you use realPath then comparing the paths
with `===` is not possible.
Imagine using a library A that uses `realPath`, and library that uses `join`
at some point, one can't compare the paths with `===` without sanitization
which becomes messy.
