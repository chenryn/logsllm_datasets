User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Where can I see what calls of EXE-programs have been made (including the arguments)? Is there any log-file within Windows where all EXE-calls are tracked or is it possible to enable such a log? Would this contain the arguments / parameters of these calls?

Thanks

Assistant: This can be done using Audit Process Creation policy, which is enabled either in group policy if you're in a domain environment, or in the local policy on an individual workstation. This setting is in Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Advanced Audit Configuration > Detailed Tracking

Each time a process is started an event will be recorded in the Windows event log with ID 4688.

The more recent versions of Windows and Windows server (8.1, 2012 R2 and above) will also record command line arguments if you enable a second policy setting called "Include command line in process creation events".
