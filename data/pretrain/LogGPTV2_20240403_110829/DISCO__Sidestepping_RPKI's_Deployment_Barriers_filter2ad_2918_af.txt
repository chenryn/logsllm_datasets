OWNERSHIP CERTIFICATION
A. Certifying Non-advertised Preﬁxes
Relying on de facto ownership makes it challenging to
certify ownership over preﬁxes not advertised in BGP. An
attacker can claim ownership of an unannounced preﬁx by
starting to advertise it
in BGP and initiating the DISCO
certiﬁcation procedure. Once certiﬁed, the attacker can issue
itself a ROA for that preﬁx. Since such preﬁxes do not
receive any trafﬁc, rogue certiﬁcates would not threaten the
Internet’s immediate connectivity. But they allow the attacker
to disconnect the owner later or hijack all their trafﬁc at will,
since, even if the legitimate owner starts advertising the preﬁx,
ASes that use DISCO for ROV will discard its advertisements,
violating the “do no harm” principle.
To prevent
the issuance of such rogue certiﬁcates, we
extend DISCO to leverage information recorded in Regional
Internet Registry (RIR) databases about preﬁx allocations and
the corresponding controlling organizations. RIR databases
contain a reduced set of mostly static information maintained
by the RIR itself (e.g., the allocations) and are only partially
editable by network operators (e.g., organization and point-of-
contact information). The RIR itself already speciﬁes in its
database which organization controls a preﬁx, establishing a
link between org and inetnum objects.
Due to their authoritative nature and recurring resource
allocation maintenance costs, inetnum and org objects are kept
more up-to-date than Internet Routing Registries (IRR) objects
used for specifying routing policies (e.g., route, route6, and
AS-SET objects). IRRs are known for being incomplete, out-
of-date, or outright incorrect.
Although RIPE maintains a single database that combines
all these functionalities, operators have limited control over
allocation (inetnum) objects, and so it is safe to use these
objects as a basis for preventing rogue DISCO certiﬁcates.
Speciﬁcally, an owner speciﬁes the public key that it intends
to certify for its preﬁxes in its organization’s description in
the RIR database. Operators can currently include the DISCO
public key as part of their organization’s address, which would
be sufﬁcient for the purposes of this extension, although
database schemas could be updated with a dedicated ﬁeld for
storing DISCO public keys.
DISCO then compares the public key in the RIR database
to the public key seen in an announcement. To claim a
previously unadvertised preﬁx, the attacker would ﬁrst need
to obtain the credentials to modify the owner’s organization
entry in the database, then successfully advertise the preﬁx
while attaching the DISCO attribute during the certiﬁcation
period. This raises the bar for false certiﬁcation, allows time
for the legitimate owner to react, and guarantees more visible
traces of attacks. In addition, the legitimate owner of the IP
preﬁx can void the false certiﬁcate by editing their information
at the RIR database for that preﬁx at any time. Conceptually,
the above extension extends the notion of de facto ownership
to control of the authoritative information recorded in RIR as
well as the routes propagating on the Internet.
As a security measure, DISCO uses only the information
recorded in the database of a preﬁx’s authoritative regional
(RIR), local (LIR), or national (NIR) Internet registry; this
requires querying multiple databases to identify which one
is authoritative for a given preﬁx, particularly for legacy
resources. If a preﬁx is not assigned to an organization in any
database (e.g., not allocated), then DISCO does not issue a
certiﬁcate for that preﬁx. Although this extension does not
protect preﬁxes missing from databases or defend against
compromised point-of-contact and organization records (e.g.,
point-of-contact e-mail addresses whose domains have expired
and been reregistered by third-parties), neither does RPKI.
B. Certifying Multiple Origins for the Same IP Address Block
As discussed in §III-B, on fairly rare occasions, the same
IP preﬁx is advertised by multiple ASes. To validate de facto
ownership of a preﬁx with multiple origin ASes, the ASes
should use the same public key when advertising the preﬁx.
Thus, DISCO vantage points will observe this key on all BGP
route-advertisements for that preﬁx, and de facto ownership
will be veriﬁed. This can be accomplished without sharing the
corresponding private key; after de facto ownership is veriﬁed,
the owner of the private key can create ROAs authorizing all
ASes to announce the preﬁx.
IX. DISCUSSION
We next discuss alternative approaches to performing de
facto ownership validation and explain why they fall short in
meeting DISCO’s goals (§IV). We conclude with a discussion
on using DISCO as a basis for further validation of BGP paths.
Validating ownership of the entire IP preﬁx vs. validating
ownership of a small set of IP addresses. As discussed
in §III, de facto ownership is a strictly weaker desideratum
than the traditional goal of binding IP preﬁxes to their legal
owners. Settling for this weaker goal is intended to enable the
design of deployable solutions while not losing “too much”
in terms of security. A natural question is thus whether de
facto ownership of the certiﬁed address block can be further
weakened to achieve similar goals. Consider, for instance, a
certiﬁcation scheme in which, when certifying an IP preﬁx,
the party being certiﬁed needs only prove control over a small
set of IP addresses within the IP preﬁx, or even just a single IP
address (e.g., of a Web, DNS or mail server). Such a scheme
would be easy to deploy but would be more vulnerable to
manipulation. Someone with control over few IP addresses,
e.g., by ‘renting’ them from a hosting provider, or taking over
an end-host, may be able to abuse such a mechanism to claim
ownership of an entire address block.
Control plane vs. data plane certiﬁcation of de facto
ownership. DISCO could,
in principle, be replaced by a
certiﬁcation mechanism that validates de facto ownership of
an IP preﬁx by requiring the alleged owner to respond to
“challenges” sent to addresses in the preﬁx from multiple
locations over a sufﬁciently long time period.
One shortcoming of data plane validation of de facto
ownership is the need to intercept (e.g., at a ﬁrewall or border
router) all challenges sent to IP addresses in the address block
being certiﬁed and forward these to a location from which
the responses are sent. DISCO, in contrast, adds an attribute
13
to existing BGP advertisements, thus avoiding the need to
actively intercept and forward challenges.
Data plane approaches are also vulnerable to stealthy
manipulations. Someone capable of intercepting the challenge
packets, e.g., via BGP preﬁx hijacking, could respond to them
and so establish ownership over another’s IP address block.
A sophisticated attacker could also ensure that all other trafﬁc
to the legitimate owner of the address block safely reaches
its destination (and so not arouse suspicions). DISCO, by
design, uses many vantage points, and so attacks on it cannot
be successful unless they are widely visible.
Beyond origin validation. BGPsec [40] was proposed to
prevent path-manipulation attacks, in which an AS advertises
bogus BGP routes to inﬂuence other ASes’ path selection,
by cryptographically authenticating the links between ASes.
Unfortunately, BGPsec requires widespread adoption of RPKI
as a prerequisite, involves nontrivial changes to the Internet
infrastructure to support on-path cryptography, and provides
limited security beneﬁts until universal adoption [39]. For these
reasons, the adoption of BGPsec is far more difﬁcult than that
of RPKI [26]. BGPsec relies on certiﬁcates of ownership over
AS numbers, which DISCO does not support.
DISCO is a good match for path-end validation, a re-
cently proposed alternative to BGPsec that does not require
modiﬁcations to the Internet’s infrastructure and is effective
in partial deployment [14], [15]. In path-end validation, a
preﬁx’s owner uses its private key to approve neighboring ASes
for relaying BGP advertisements it originates. Since DISCO
assigns IP addresses to public keys,
it naturally supports
authenticating neighbors through path-end validation records.
The combination of DISCO and path-end validation provides
a tangible defense against path manipulation attacks.
X. RELATED WORK
Previous research has pointed out complementary ap-
proaches to RPKI, and operators continuously reﬁne deploy-
ment approaches. Regardless, RPKI adoption has been very
slow, and known deployments are not without serious chal-
lenges: AT&T’s deployment, for example, requires constant
monitoring by experienced administrators,
is partial (ROV
is enforced on peering links only), and still is far beyond
what most networks have done. We believe that DISCO’s
automated certiﬁcation mechanism signiﬁcantly lowers the bar
for adoption compared to previously proposed approaches. We
also believe DISCO certiﬁcation is an advancement relative to
today’s monitoring and alert systems.
Similar to DISCO’s de facto ownership, PGBGP maintains
a history mapping which origins announce what preﬁxes [33].
When a preﬁx is announced by a different origin AS, a
PGBGP router quarantines the announcement for a predeﬁned
period (e.g., 24h) before installing the routes. The quarantine
period allows network operators to check the quarantined
announcement and take action before damage is done. Left
unchecked, hijacks (due to misconﬁgurations or attacks) would
be propagated as regular announcements after the quarantine
period. Furthermore, quarantining routes requires changes to
existing routers and may accidentally quarantine legitimate
changes in announcement conﬁguration (e.g., for trafﬁc en-
gineering). DISCO instead uses de facto ownership to create
certiﬁcates, which allows ﬂexible, deterministic, permanent ﬁl-
tering without the involvement of network operators. Another
fundamental difference is that DISCO uses a global view
of the Internet to establish ownership, while PGBGP routers
operate in isolation and are thus more easily subverted by
targeted, localized attacks.
Some studies proposed using anomaly detection to identify
attacks on BGP [27], [36], [54], [58]. Like DISCO, these
proposals rely on a global view of Internet routes afforded
by vantage points. Although anomaly detection is useful for
identifying suspicious routes, it does not bind IP preﬁxes to
owners (through public keys) and so does not enable the owner
to publish ﬁltering rules pertaining to its preﬁxes like ROAs.
Our recent workshop paper proposes using BGP adver-
tisements to establish de facto ownership over preﬁxes [23].
However, (1) the work presents only preliminary results from
one Internet measurement and did not advertise a control
preﬁx, limiting the conclusions that can be drawn; (2) no
results regarding the global effects on reachability or data-
plane measurements are presented; (3) no measurements of the
fraction of announced preﬁxes with de facto owners are given
so as to evaluate how useful the certiﬁcation approach would
be in practice; (4) important implementation details such as
how to integrate with border routers are not explained; and (5)
alternative approaches to establishing de facto ownership are
not discussed.
Other proposals advocate establishing ownership by check-
ing for control of a single machine (such as the reverse DNS
server [19]). As discussed in §IX, such approaches might not
provide sufﬁcient security.
Human involvement in the conﬁguration of cryptographic
protocols induces errors and limits adoption. Consequently,
automating conﬁguration has been investigated in the context
of other protocols as well, including IPsec and TLS [6], [22].
De facto ownership for establishing security proved useful in
bootstrapping TLS, as reﬂected by the popular Let’s Encrypt
service for issuing X.509 TLS certiﬁcates [3], [6], [41]. Nev-
ertheless, this approach was shown vulnerable to MitM attacks
in the data plane [7], [8] and was later improved by utilizing
control plane information for performing validation [10].
DISCO’s decentralized approach for certifying ownership
over IP address blocks resembles the design of the Conver-
gence system for validating the correctness of TLS certiﬁ-
cates [42]. In contrast to DISCO, Convergence relies on the
data plane to validate ownership (discussed as an alternative
approach to DISCO’s design in section IX). DISCO’s repos-
itories publish a list of all issued certiﬁcates, allowing anyone
to identify whether their preﬁx was certiﬁcated to someone
else, an idea resembling certiﬁcate transparency for TLS [37].
XI. CONCLUSION
We presented DISCO, a system for certifying ownership of
IP address blocks that yields substantial security beneﬁts while
circumventing the obstacles to adoption facing RPKI and ROV.
We evaluated the security and deployability of DISCO through
a combination of extensive simulations on empirically-derived
datasets and live (control-plane and data-plane) experiments
using the PEERING platform.

We view DISCO as the ﬁrst step towards a broader agenda
for securing BGP routing. Beyond protecting against preﬁx
hijacking attacks, DISCO certiﬁcation is sufﬁcient to support
path-end validation [14], [15], a recently proposed alternative
to BGPsec that achieves comparable security beneﬁts in a de-
ployable manner. Combined, DISCO and path-end validation
constitute a feasible path to BGP security.
