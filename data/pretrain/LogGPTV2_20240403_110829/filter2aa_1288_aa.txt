Break, Memory 
By 
Richard Thieme 
The Evolution of the Problem 
The problem was not that people couldn’t remember; the problem was that people 
couldn’t forget. 
As far back as the 20th century, we realized that socio-historical problems were 
best handled on a macro level. It was inefficient to work on individuals who were, after 
all, nothing but birds in digital cages. Move the cage, move the birds. The challenge was 
to build the cage big enough to create an illusion of freedom in flight but small enough to 
be moved easily. 
When long-term collective memory became a problem in the 21st century, it 
wound up on my desktop.  There had always been a potential for individuals to connect 
the dots and cause a contextual shift. We managed the collective as best we could with 
Chomsky Chutes but an event could break out randomly at any time like a bubble 
bursting. As much as we surveil the social landscape with sensors and datamine for deep 
patterns, we can’t catch everything. It’s all sensors and statistics, after all, which have 
limits. If a phenomenon gets sticky or achieves critical mass, it can explode through any 
interface, even create the interface it needs at the moment of explosion. That can gum up 
the works.

Remembering and forgetting changed after writing was invented. The ones that 
remembered best had always won. Writing shifted the advantage from those who knew to 
those who knew how to find what was known. Electronic communication shifted the 
advantage once again to those who knew what they didn’t need to know but knew how to 
get it when they did. In the twentieth century advances in pharmacology and genetic 
engineering increased longevity dramatically and at the same time meaningful 
distinctions between backward and forward societies disappeared so far as health care 
was concerned. The population exploded everywhere simultaneously. 
People who had retired in their sixties could look forward to sixty or seventy more 
years of healthful living. As usual, the anticipated problems – overcrowding, scarce water 
and food, employment for those who wanted it – were not the big issues.  
Crowding was managed by staggered living, generating  niches in many multiples 
of what used to be daylight single-sided life. Life became double-sided, then triple-sided, 
and so on. Like early memory storage devices that packed magnetic media inside other 
media, squeezing them into every bit of available space, we designed multiple niches in 
society that allowed people to live next to one another in densely packed communities 
without even noticing their neighbors. Oh, people were vaguely aware that thousands of 
others were on the streets or in stadiums, but they might as well have been simulants for 
all the difference they made. We call this the Second Neolithic, the emergence of 
specialization at the next level squared.  
The antisocial challenges posed by hackers who “flipped” through niches for 
weeks at a time, staying awake on Perkup, or criminals exploiting flaws inevitably 
3 
present in any new system, were anticipated and handled using risk management 
algorithms. In short, multisided life works. 
Genetic engineering provided plenty of food and water.  Binderhoff Day 
commemorates the day that water was recycled from sewage using the Binderhoff 
Method. A body barely relinquishes its liquid before it’s back in a glass in its hand. As to 
food, the management of fads enables us to play musical chairs with agri-resources, 
smoothing the distribution curve. 
Lastly, people are easy to keep busy. Serial careers, marriages and identities have 
been pretty much standard since the twentieth century. Trends in that direction continued 
at incremental rather than tipping-point levels. We knew within statistical limits when too 
many transitions would cause a problem, jamming intersections as it were with too many 
vehicles, so we licensed relationships, work-terms, and personal reinvention using traffic 
management algorithms to control the social flow.  
By the twenty-first century, everybody’s needs were met. Ninety-eight per cent of 
everything bought and sold was just plain made up. Once we started a fad, it tended to 
stay in motion, generating its own momentum. People spent much of their time 
exchanging goods and services that an objective observer might have thought useless or 
unnecessary, but of course, there was no such thing as an objective observer. Objectivity 
requires distance, historical perspective, exactly what is lacking. Every product or service 
introduced into the marketplace drags in its wake an army of workers to manufacture it, 
support it, or clean up after it which swells the stream until it becomes a river. All of 
those rivers flow into the sea but the sea is never full.

Fantasy baseball is a good example. It had long been noticed that baseball itself, 
once the sport became digitized, was a simulation. Team names were made up for as 
many teams as the population would watch. Players for those teams were swapped back 
and forth so the team name was obviously arbitrary, requiring the projection of a “team 
gestalt” from loyal fans pretending not to notice that they booed players they had cheered 
as heroes the year before. Even when fans were physically present at games, the 
experience was mediated through digital filters; one watched or listened to digital 
simulations instead of the game itself, which existed increasingly on the edges of the field 
of perception. Then the baseball strike of 2012 triggered the Great Realization. The strike 
was on for forty-two days before anyone noticed the absence of flesh-and-blood players 
because the owners substituted players made of pixels. Game Boys created game boys. 
Fantasy baseball had invented itself in recognition that fans might as well swap virtual 
players and make up teams too but the G.R. took it to the next level. After the strike, 
Double Fantasy Baseball became an industry, nested like a Russian doll inside Original 
Fantasy Baseball. Leagues of fantasy players were swapped in meta-leagues of fantasy 
players. Then Triple Fantasy Baseball … Quadruple Fantasy Baseball … and now the fad 
is Twelves in baseball football and whack-it-ball and I understand that Lucky Thirteens is 
on the drawing boards, bigger and better than any of its predecessors. 
So no, there is no shortage of arbitrary activities or useless goods. EBay was the 
prototype of the future, turning the world into one gigantic swap meet. If we need a 
police action or a new professional sport to bleed off excess hostility or rebalance the 
body politic, we make it up. The Hump in the Bell Curve as we call the eighty per cent 
that buy and sell just about everything swim blissfully in the currents of make-believe 
5 
digital rivers, all unassuming. They call it the Pursuit of Happiness. And hey – who are 
we to argue? 
The memory-longevity problem came as usual completely out of fantasy left field. 
People were living three, four, five generations, as we used to count generations, and 
vividly recalled the events of their personal histories. Pharmacological assists and genetic 
enhancement made the problem worse by quickening recall and ending dementia and 
Alzheimer’s. I don’t mean that every single person remembered every single thing but the 
Hump as a whole had pretty good recall of its collective history and that’s what mattered. 
Peer-to-peer communication means one-knows-everyone-knows and that created 
problems for society in general and – as a Master of Society – that makes it my business. 
My name is Horicon Walsh, if you hadn’t guessed, and I lead the team that 
designs the protocols of society. I am the man behind the Master. I am the Master behind 
the Plan. 
The Philosophical Basis of the Problem 
The philosophical touchstone of our efforts was defined in nineteenth century 
America. The only question that matters is, What good is it? Questions like, what is its 
nature? what is its end? are irrelevant.  
Take manic depression, for example. Four per cent of the naturally occurring 
population were manic depressive in the late twentieth century. The pharmacological fix 
applied to the anxious or depressive one-third of the Hump attempted to maintain a 
6 
steady internal state, not too high and not too low. That standard of equilibrium was 
accepted without question as a benchmark for fixing manic depression. Once we got the 
chemistry right, the people who had swung between killing themselves and weeks of 
incredibly productive, often genius-level activity were tamped down in the bowl, as it 
were, their glowing embers a mere reflection of the fire that had once burned so brightly. 
Evolution, in other words, had gotten it right because their good days – viewed from the 
top of the tent – made up for their bad days. Losing a few to suicide was no more 
consequential than a few soccer fans getting trampled. Believing that the Golden Mean 
worked on the individual as well as the macro level, we got it all wrong. 
That sort of mistake, fixing things according to unexamined assumptions, 
happened all the time when we started tweaking things. Too many dumb but athletic 
children spoiled the broth. Too many waddling bespectacled geeks made it too acrid. Too 
many willowy beauties made it too salty. Peaks and valleys, that’s what we call the first 
half of the 21st century, as we let people design their own progeny. The feedback loops 
inside society kind of worked – we didn’t kill ourselves – but clearly we needed to be 
more aware. Regulation was obviously necessary and subsequently all genetic alteration 
and pharmacological enhancements were cross-referenced in a matrix calibrated to the 
happiness of the Hump. Executing the Plan to make it all work was our responsibility, a 
charge that the ten per cent of us called Masters gladly accepted. The ten per cent 
destined to be dregs, spending their lives picking through dumpsters and arguing loudly 
with themselves in loopy monologues, serve as grim reminders of what humanity would 
be without our enlightened guidance.

That’s the context in which it became clear that everybody remembering 
everything was a problem. The Nostalgia Riots of Greater Florida were only a symptom. 
The Nostalgia Riots 
Here you had the fat tip of a long peninsular state packed like a water balloon 
with millions of people well into their hundreds. One third of the population was 150 or 
older by 2175. Some remembered sixteen major wars and dozens of skirmishes and 
police actions.  Some had lived through forty-six recessions and recoveries. Some had 
lived through so many elections they could have written the scripts, that’s how bad it 
was. Their thoughtful reflection, nuanced perspective, and appropriate skepticism were a 
blight on a well-managed global free-market democracy. They did not get depressed – 
pharmies in the food and water made sure of that – but they sure acted like depressed 
people even if they didn’t feel like it. And depressed people tend to get angry.  
West Floridians lined benches from Key West through Tampa Bay all the way to 
the Panhandle. The view from satellites when they lighted matches one night in 
midwinter to demonstrate their power shows an unbroken arc along the edge of the water 
like a second beach beside the darker beach. All day every day they sat there 
remembering, comparing notes, measuring what was happening now by what had 
happened before. They put together pieces of the historical puzzle the way people used to 
do crosswords and we had to work overtime to stay a step ahead. The long view of the 
8 
Elder Sub-Hump undermined satisfaction with the present. They preferred a different, 
less helpful way of looking at things. 
When the drums of the Department of System Integration, formerly the Managed 
Affairs and Perception Office, began to beat loudly to rouse the population of our 
crowded earth to a fury against the revolutionary Martian colonists who shot their 
resupplies into space rather than pay taxes to the earth, we thought we would have the 
support of the Elder Sub-Hump. Instead they pushed the drumming into the background 
and recalled through numerous conversations the details of past conflicts, creating a 
memory net that destabilized the official Net. Their case for why our effort was doomed 
was air-tight, but that wasn’t the problem. We didn’t mind the truth being out there so 
long as no one connected it to the present. The problem was that so many people knew it 
because the Elder Sub-Hump wouldn’t shut up. That created a precedent and the 
precedent was the problem.  
Long-term memory, we realized, was subversive of the body politic.  
Where had we gotten off course? We had led the culture to skew toward youth 
because youth have no memory in essence, no context for judging anything. Their 
righteousness is in proportion to their ignorance, as it should be. But the Elder Sub-Hump 
skewed that skew.   
We launched a campaign against the seditious seniors. Because there were so 
many of them, we had to use ridicule. The three legs of the stool of cover and deception 
operations are illusion, misdirection, and ridicule, but the greatest of these is ridicule. 
When the enemy is in plain sight, you have to make him look absurd so everything he 
says is discredited. The UFO Campaign of the twentieth century is the textbook example 
9 
of that strategy. You had fighter pilots, commercial pilots, credible citizens all reporting 
the same thing from all over the world, their reports agreeing over many decades in the 
small details. So ordinary citizens were subjected to ridicule. The use of government 
owned and influenced media like newspapers (including agency-owned-and-operated 
tabloids) and television networks made people afraid to say what they saw. They came to 
disbelieve their own eyes so the phenomena could hide in plain sight.  Pretty soon no one 
saw it. Even people burned by close encounters refused to believe in their own 
experience and accepted official explanations. 
We did everything possible to make old people look ridiculous. Subtle images of 
drooling fools were inserted into news stories, short features showed ancients playing 
inanely with their pets, the testimony of confused seniors was routinely dismissed in 
courts of law. Our trump card – entertainment – celebrated youth and its lack of 
perspective, extolling the beauty of young muscular bodies in contrast with sagging-skin 
bags of bones who paused too long before they spoke. We turned the book industry inside 
out so the little bit that people did know was ever more superficial. The standard for 
excellence in publishing became an absence of meaningful text, massive amounts of 
white space, and large fonts. Originality dimmed, and pretty soon the only books that 
sold well were mini-books of aphorisms promulgated by pseudo-gurus each in his or her 
self-generated niche. 
Slowly the cognitive functioning of the Hump degraded until abstract or creative 
thought became marks of the wacky, the outcast, and the impotent.  
Then the unexpected happened, as it always will. Despite our efforts, the 
Nostalgia Riots broke out one hot and steamy summer day. Govvies moved on South 
10 
Florida with happy gas, trying to turn the rampaging populace into one big smiley face, 
but the seniors went berserk before the gas – on top of pills, mind you, chemicals in the 
water, and soporific stories in the media – took effect. They tore up benches from the 
Everglades to Tampa/St. Pete and made bonfires that made the forest fires of ’64 look 
like fireflies. They smashed store windows, burned hovers, and looted amusement parks 
along the Hundred-Mile-Boardwalk. Although the Youthful Sub-Hump was slow to get 
on board, they burned white-hot when they finally ignited, racing through their shopping 
worlds with inhuman cold-blooded cries. A shiver of primordial terror chilled the Hump 
from end to end.  
That a riot broke out was not the primary problem. Riots will happen and serve 
many good purposes. They enable us to reinforce stereotypes, enact desirable legislation, 
and discharge unhelpful energies. The way we frame analyses of their causes become 
antecedents for future policies and police actions. We have sponsored or facilitated many 
a useful riot. No, the problem was that the elders’ arguments were based on past events 
and if anybody listened, they made sense. That’s what tipped the balance. Youth who had 
learned to ignore and disrespect their elders actually listened to what they were saying. 
Pretending to think things through became a fad. The young sat on quasi-elder-benches 
from Key Largo to Saint Augustine, pretending to have thoughtful conversations about 
the old days. Coffee shops came back into vogue. Lingering became fashionable again. 
Earth had long ago decided to back down when the Martians declared independence, so it 
wasn’t that. It was the spectacle of the elderly strutting their stuff in a victory parade that 
stretched from Miami Beach to Biloxi that imaged a future we could not abide. 
11 
Even before the march, we were working on solving the problem. Let them win 
the battle. Martians winning independence, old folks feeling their oats, those weren’t the 
issues. How policy was determined was the issue. Our long-term strategy focused on 
winning that war. 
Beyond the Chomsky Chutes 
The first thing we did was review the efficacy of Chomsky Chutes.
