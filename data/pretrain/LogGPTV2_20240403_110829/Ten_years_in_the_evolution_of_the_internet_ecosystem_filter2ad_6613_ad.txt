### Regional Distribution of AS Types Over Time

**Geographical Trends for Each AS Type:**
To classify Autonomous Systems (ASes) into broad geographical regions, we use the "registry" field from the corresponding WHOIS entries. Figure 9 illustrates the fraction of ASes of each type that are registered with ARIN (North America) and RIPE (primarily Europe). Other registries, such as APNIC, LACNIC, and AFRINIC, account for a smaller fraction and are not shown in the figure.

Interestingly, the number of Edge Customers (ECs) in North America and Europe is converging. It is likely that in the next few years, there will be more ECs registered in Europe than in North America. This trend has already been observed for Small Transit Providers (STPs), where the number of STPs is now slightly higher in Europe. Large Transit Providers (LTPs), however, are still predominantly based in North America. The fraction of Content/Access/Hosting Providers (CAHPs) in Europe has always been higher than in North America, possibly due to the presence of many regional access providers in Europe. These trends suggest that the Internet market, in terms of the number of access/hosting, transit, and content providers, will soon be larger in Europe than in North America, if it is not already so.

### Rewiring Activity for Each AS Type

The differences in business functions and incentives among the four AS types can also be observed in their rewiring activity. To measure this, we calculate the Jaccard distance for the set of Customer-Provider (CP) links of each AS and then compute the average Jaccard distance for all ASes of the same type. The top panel of Figure 10 shows these averages over time.

- **Edge Customers (ECs):** ECs show the lowest rewiring activity throughout the last ten years.
- **Small Transit Providers (STPs) and Large Transit Providers (LTPs):** These have similar rewiring activity.
- **Content/Access/Hosting Providers (CAHPs):** CAHPs exhibit the highest rewiring activity, especially since 2001. They frequently rewire their CP links to minimize transit costs and provide good performance and reliability to their customers.

A related metric is the fraction of nodes in each AS type that are inert, meaning they do not undergo any change in their set of CP links between two successive snapshots. The bottom panel of Figure 10 shows this fraction over time:

- **Edge Customers (ECs):** The fraction of inert ECs increased slightly from 74% in 2001 to 80% currently, indicating that ECs at the network edge are becoming increasingly stable with respect to their connectivity to providers.
- **Small Transit Providers (STPs):** The fraction of inert STPs has remained almost constant since 2001 (between 25% and 30%). Many of the inert STPs are national monopoly providers or research and educational backbone networks, which have a stable customer base and little incentive to constantly optimize their connectivity.
- **Large Transit Providers (LTPs):** The fraction of inert LTPs is very low and approaches zero, as large transit providers have a constant churn in their customers.
- **Content/Access/Hosting Providers (CAHPs):** The fraction of inert CAHPs has decreased significantly from 46% to 18%, suggesting that these providers have an incentive to constantly optimize their connectivity.

### Evolution of CP Relations: Customer-Side Properties

**Number of Providers per AS Type:**
Figure 11 shows the average number of providers per customer (or the average multihoming degree) for each AS type. The median number of providers shows similar trends.

- **Edge Customers (ECs):** The multihoming degree for ECs has increased very slowly over the last decade (from 1.5 to 1.9) and has been almost constant since 2001.
- **Small Transit Providers (STPs):** The multihoming degree for STPs has increased significantly (from 1.9 to 3.9).
- **Large Transit Providers (LTPs):** The multihoming degree for LTPs has increased from 2 to 5.5.
- **Content/Access/Hosting Providers (CAHPs):** The multihoming degree for CAHPs has increased dramatically (from 2.1 to 8.2).

The dramatic increase in the multihoming degree of CAHPs and LTPs is likely the main reason behind the densification of the Internet, as discussed earlier.

**Distribution of the Number of Providers:**
We further study the distribution of the number of providers for different AS types. The distribution for ECs has not changed significantly in the last 10 years. The most significant change is for CAHPs. Figure 12 shows the distribution of the number of providers for CAHPs in five snapshots over the last 10 years. The distribution has shifted consistently towards the right, indicating an increase in the number of providers for CAHPs. The median number of providers for CAHPs is close to the average, and 50% of CAHPs in the latest snapshot (2007.10) have more than 7 providers. This means that the average number of providers for CAHPs seen in Figure 11 is not biased by a small number of CAHPs with many providers.

**STPs versus LTPs:**
We are also interested in the type of provider that each AS type connects to when acting as a customer in a customer-provider relation. Figure 13 shows the number of links in each transit category over time.

- **EC-LTP and EC-STP Links:** Both EC-LTP and EC-STP links showed an exponential increase up to 2001, matching the trend of the total number of CP links. Thereafter, the growth rate slowed down, following a linear increase. Until 2004, the number of EC-STP links was almost the same as the number of EC-LTP links. After 2004, the growth rate of EC-STP links has been higher than that of EC-LTP links (240 links/month vs 106 links/month), indicating that ECs increasingly prefer to connect to smaller, regional providers. Possible reasons for this preference include lower costs, regional factors such as national monopolies and regulations, and region-specific marketing by STPs.
- **CAHP and STP Customers:** The numbers of CAHP-LTP and CAHP-STP (as well as STP-STP and STP-LTP) links have been increasing at roughly the same rate. Unlike ECs, CAHP and STP customers do not prefer one type of provider over the other.

**Rewiring Activity of AS Customers:**
Next, we investigate the rewiring activity of AS customers according to the broad geographical region in which they belong. Specifically, we find the set of active customers (customers that made some change to their set of providers) between pairs of successive snapshots and calculate the fraction of those active customers that belong to each geographical region. Figure 14 shows these trends. The fractions for Asia-Pacific (APNIC), Latin America (LACNIC), and Africa (AFRINIC) are practically constant and significantly lower than for Europe (RIPE) and North America (ARIN). Interestingly, after 2004-2005, there are more active customers based in Europe than in North America. As shown in Section 4, Europe is catching up with North America in terms of the population of ECs, and the population of STPs is already larger in Europe. We conjecture that this has created a more competitive market in Europe, with European customer ASes being more active in adjusting their upstream connectivity.

### Evolution of CP Relations: Provider-Side Properties

**Preferential Attachment and Preferential Detachment:**
First, we measure the total number of CP links that were born and died between two consecutive snapshots. We define the attractiveness \( A_p \) of a provider \( p \) as the fraction of CP links born in the second snapshot that connected to provider \( p \). Similarly, the repulsiveness \( R_p \) of a provider \( p \) is the fraction of CP links that died in the second snapshot.
