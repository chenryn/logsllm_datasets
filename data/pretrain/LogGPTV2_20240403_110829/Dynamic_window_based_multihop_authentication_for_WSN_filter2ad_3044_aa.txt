ABSTRACT 
Per-hop authentication is the most effective way to prevent DOS 
attacks during multihop data delivery. Although the study results 
show  that  Public  Key  Cryptography  (PKC)  is  feasible  on  sensor 
nodes with limited resources, it is still very expensive to perform 
per-hop authentication using public key digital signature. To solve 
the  problem  that  the  resources  of  WSN  is  exhausted  quickly  by 
PKC, Dynamic Window Based Multihop Authentication(DWMA) 
for  WSN  is  proposed  in  this  paper.  Dynamic  window  makes  it 
possible  to  pay  only  a  small  number  of  authentication  based  on 
digital signature for confining DoS attacks effectively in a small 
scope and locating suspicious nodes quickly. Experimental results 
show  that  DWMA  could  save  more  resources  than  per-hop 
authentication for WSN, defend DoS attacks effectively and locate 
malicious  nodes.  It’s  an  effective  protocol  for  ensuring  the 
resistance of DoS in routing.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
The goal of DOS attacks in WSN is to keep the legitimate node 
from accessing the destination node. In WSN, DOS attacks could 
be divided into two types: positive attacks and passive attacks [1]. 
The best way of defending the positive DOS attacks is to verify 
the  integrity,  authenticity  and  freshness  of  messages  via  per-hop 
authentication.  That  could  discover  and  discard  suspicious 
messages immediately after anomalous messages are injected into 
WSN. 
At present, there have been many message authentication schemes 
for  different  application  environments,  such  as  SNEP,  TinySec, 
ZigBee,  MiniSec,  one-way  hash  chain,  and  LEDS,  and  so  on 
[2,3,4,5,6].  These  authentication  algorithms  mainly  use  one-way 
hash  function  or  MAC  to  implement  per-hop  authentication,  but 
their  security  and  flexibility  are  not  well.  The  digital  signature 
based on public key is a better choice for message authentication 
compared  with  the  above  authentication  algorithms,  but  many 
people think that its cost is very terrible and unrealistic for sensor

nodes.  The  experiment  shows  that  the  cost  of  one  ECDSA-160 
sign  and  one  ECDSA-160  authentication  are  22.82mJ  and 
45.09mJ  respectively,  and  PKC  is  feasible  on  sensor  nodes  [7]. 
Furthermore, the public key infrastructure has been implemented 
on  the  8-bit,  7.3828-MHz  MICA2  mote  [8].  However  if  sensor 
nodes using EDCSA-160 authenticate every message, the resource 
consumption  is  still  very  expensive,  especially  in  per-hop 
authentication. 
In fact, most overhead of per-hop authentication occurs in normal 
messages, which is actually not essential. When digital signature 
based on public key is used to verify messages in multihop data 
delivery, if it is possible that DoS attacks could be limited without 
verifying  normal  messages,  the  resource  consumption  will  be 
acceptable for WSN. To achieve the target, this paper proposes a 
novel  scheme:  dynamic  window  based  multihop  authentication 
(DWMA).  The  proposed  scheme  doesn’t  only  avoid  most  of 
needless authentication for authentic messages, but also limit DOS 
attacks  effectively,  and  could  locate  malicious  nodes  quickly. 
More  importantly,  the  energy  consumption  of  the  proposed 
scheme using digital signature based on public key is no more than 
that  of  per-hop  authentication  using  one-way  hash  function  or 
MAC. 
2.  USING DYNAMIC WINDOW TO VERIFY  
MESSAGES DURING MUTIHOP DATA  
DELIVERY 
2.1 System Model 
In  this  paper,  we assume  that  the attack  objective is to consume 
nodes’ limited resources and stop the delivery of normal data. To 
achieve  the  objective,  the  attacker  would  try  to  capture  normal 
nodes  or  deploy  malicious  nodes.  These  anomalous  nodes  could 
tamper  received  messages,  flood  faked  messages, and  replay old 
messages.  To  confuse  normal  nodes,  attackers  may  send 
anomalous messages randomly or with a certain probability.  
We  assume  that  the  topology  of  WSN  is  static,  and  WSN  will 
implement  neighbor  discovery  mechanism  to  establish  neighbor 
lists in every node. Nodes only communicate with nodes in their 
own  neighbor 
lists.  Meanwhile,  attackers  can’t  move  any 
malicious nodes after starting to attack. 
2.2 Design Targets 
The goal of this paper is to verify messages via digital signature 
based  on  public  key,  defend  the  positive  DOS  attack  and  locate 
attack sources quickly. The design principles include: 
7441)  Effectiveness:  DWMA  should  contain  the  damage  of  DOS 
attacks very well and find out malicious nodes quickly. 
2)  Savings:  the  message  authentication  using  digital  signature 
based  on  public  key  shouldn’t  consume  too  many  resources  and 
even  consume  less  energy  than  per-hop  authentication  based  on 
MAC or one-way hash chain in the long run. 
3)  Flexibility:  DWMA  should  be  able  to  be  applied  to  kinds  of 
WSN routing protocols. 
2.3 DWMA 
DWMA  is  to  improve  the  broadcast  authentication  mechanism 
based on dynamic window in [9]. In this scheme, every message 
adds a field da: it records the number of passed nodes after the last 
authentication.  At  the  same  time,  every  sensor  node  needs  to 
maintain  a  neighbor  table:  sensor  nodes  set  the  corresponding 
window  value  W,  the  growth  delay  degree  Rdelay  of  W,  and  the 
history  record  Bnum  of  anomalous  messages  for  every  neighbor 
node.  
W  controls  the  maximum  number  of  nodes  that  forward  the 
message  M  which  isn’t  verified.  Once  the  hop  number  da  of  M 
received by S is not less than the corresponding W, S must verify 
M.  If  authentication  is  successful,  execute  different  functions  by 
judging  the  value  of  Rdelay:  when  Rdelay  =  0,  this  function  ψs  is 
executed;  when  Rdelay  >  0,  the  function  Rm  is  executed.  If 
authentication fails and W>1, the function ψm is executed. At this 
time, if Rdelay=0, Bnum= Bnum+1, the update function Ru is executed. 
Finally,  the  window  decreasing  message  DATA_W_REDUCE, 
which  is  to  be  forwarded  da-1  hops  at  most,  is  sent  along  the 
reverse  path  of  data  delivery.  If  authentication  fails  and  W=1,  S 
sends the alarm message DATA_W_ALARM to the last node, and 
warns  the  last  node  to  send  messages  to  it  after  verifying 
messages. The process of DWMA is shown in Fig.1.

(c) 
Shown in Fig.1(a), at first, the value of Wmax is 4 for all nodes and 
W=Wmax. S1 sends a message M to D. When N4 receives M, N4 
tampers M and sends it to N5. Then N5 sends M to N6. N6 find 
that da >=W(N5-N6), and then verifies M. But the authentication fails 
and Rdelay=0. So N6 executes these formulas for N5 in turn: Bnum= 
Bnum+1=1,  Rdelay=Ru=2Bnum=2,  W(N5-N6)=ψm=W(N5-N6)/2=2.  Finally, 
N6  discards  M,  and  forwards  DATA_W_REDUCE  along  the 
reverse  path  of  the  M  delivery  path  S1-N1-N4-N5-N6(shown  in 
Fig.1(b)).  When  one  of  these  nodes  in  the  reverse  path  receives 
DATA_W_REDUCE,  it  executes  those  formulas  that  N6  has 
executed  and  forwards  DATA_W_REDUCE  to  the  next  node  in 
the  reverse  path.  When  N5  receives  the  second  anomalous 
message from N4 again, W(N4-N5)=1. As given in Fig.1(c), when N5 
receives  the  third  anomalous  message  form  N4,  N5  sends    the 
alarm  message  DATA_W_ALARM  to  N4.  If  N4  continues  to 
sends anomalous messages to N5, N5 sends the alarm message to 
the sink node and isolates N4.

is  analyzed  and  evaluated  using 
OMNET++4.0.  The  following  performances  are  evaluated:  1, 
throughput  (the  amount  of  data  received  by  the  sink);  2, 
authentication  times  in  WSN;  3,  the  total  energy  consumed  in 
WSN. 
3.1  Environmental  Setup  
In  this  simulation,  we  assume  that  we  assume  that  sensor  nodes 
run on the Berkeley/Crossbow Mica2dot sensor platform[7]. In the 
simulation environment, there are 100 uniformly deployed sensor 
nodes, ten of which are malicious nodes.
