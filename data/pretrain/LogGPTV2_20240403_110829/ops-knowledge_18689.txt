User: What precautions should be taken when deploying applications using Docker containers?
Assistant: 1. Identify the right image: Choose a widely used, community-supported, and reliable Docker image. 2. Set up an appropriate container: Set resources such as CPU, memory, and network according to application requirements. 3. Ensure data persistence: ensure that data will not be lost after the container is destroyed. It is recommended to use storage methods such as data volumes, host mounts, or object storage. 4. Keep containers secure: Be aware of software versions installed inside containers, regularly update images and containers, and use proper authentication and authorization mechanisms. 5. Monitoring and logs: Docker integrates a variety of log management methods to ensure timely discovery of problems and quick troubleshooting; monitoring monitors the health status of containers running in docker, internal indicators of containers, running activity status, process information, etc. Is necessary. 6. Network management: Docker containers will communicate in their own internal network bridge network by default. You can customize the network network through the docker network command to achieve more flexible container network communication, and you can also manage the number of networks. Containers are managed under a network.
