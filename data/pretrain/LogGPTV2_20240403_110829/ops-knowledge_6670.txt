User: I need to package my Python application, its dependencies and Python into a single MSI installer. The end result should desirably be:

Python is installed in the standard location
the package and its dependencies are installed in a separate directory (possibly site-packages)
the installation directory should contain the Python uncompressed and a standalone executable is not required
Assistant: py2exe is the best way to do this.  It's a bit of a PITA to use, but the end result works very well.
