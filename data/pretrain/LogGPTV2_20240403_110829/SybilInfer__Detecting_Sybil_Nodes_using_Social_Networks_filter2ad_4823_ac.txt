As a result, by sufﬁciently increasing the number of ran-
dom walks T performed on the social graph, we can get
EXX arbitrarily close to zero. In turn this means that our
distribution P (T|X = Honest) is uniform for given sizes
of |X|, given our uniform a-prior P (X = Honest|T ).
In a nutshell by estimating EXX for any sample X re-
turned by the MH algorithm, and testing how close it is
to zero we detect whether it corresponds to an attack (as
we will see from theorem B) or a natural cut in the graph.
We can increase the precision of the detector arbitrarily by
increasing the number of walks T .
Our second results relates to the behaviour of the sys-
tem under Sybil attack:
THEOREM B. Connecting any additional Sybil nodes
to the social network, through a set of corrupt nodes,
lowers the dishonest sub-graph conductance to the
honest region, leading to slow mixing, and hence we
expect EXX > 0.
First we deﬁne the dishonest set ¯X0 comprising all dis-
honest nodes connected to honest nodes in the graph. The
set ¯XS contains all dishonest nodes in the system, includ-
ing nodes in ¯X0 and the Sybil nodes attached to them. It
must hold that | ¯X0|  0, even for very few Sybils. This deviation is
subject to the sampling variation introduced by the trace
T , but the error can be made arbitrarily small by sampling
more random walks in T .
These two results are very strong: they indicate that, in
theory, a set of compromised nodes connecting to honest
nodes in a social network, would get no advantage by con-
necting any additional Sybil nodes, since that would lead
to their detection. Sampling regions of the graph with ab-
normally small conductance, through the use of the ran-
dom walks T , should lead to their discovery, which is the
theoretical foundation of our technique. Furthermore we
established that techniques based on detecting abnormali-
ties in the value of EXX are strategy proof, meaning that
there is no attacker strategy (in terms of special adversary
topology) to foil detection.
4.2 Practical considerations
Models and assumptions are always an approximation
of the real world. As a result, careful evaluation is nec-
essary to ensure that the theorems are robust to deviations
from the ideal behaviour assumed so far.
The ﬁrst practical issue concerns the fast mixing prop-
erties of social networks. There is a lot of evidence that
social networks exhibit this behaviour [18], and previous
proposals relating to Sybil defence use and validate the
same assumption [27, 26]. SybilInfer makes an further
assumption, namely that the modiﬁed random walk over
the social network, that yields a uniform distribution over
all nodes, is also fast mixing for real social networks. The
), depends on the mutual
probability Pij = min( 1
di
degrees of the nodes i and j, and makes the transition to
nodes of higher degree less likely. This effect has the po-
tential to slow down mixing times in the honest case, par-
ticularly when there is a high variation in node degrees.
This effect can be alleviated by removing random edges
from high degree nodes to guarantee that the ratio of max-
imum and minimum node degree in the graph is bounded
(an approach also used by SybilLimit.)

dj
The second consideration also relates to the fast mix-
ing properties of networks. While in theory fast mixing
networks should not exhibit any small cuts, or regions of
abnormally low conductance, in practice they do. This
is especially true for regions with new users that have not
had the chance to connect to many others, as well as social
networks that only contain users with particular charac-
teristics (like interest, locality, or administrative groups.)
Those regions yield, even in the honest case, sample cuts
that have the potential to be mistaken as attacks. This ef-
fect forces us to consider a threshold EXX under which
we consider cuts to be simply false positives. In turn this
makes the guarantees of schemes weaker in practice than
in theory, since the adversary can introduce Sybils into a
region undetected, as long as the set threshold EXX is not
exceeded.
The threshold EXX is chosen to be α·EXXmax, where
EXXmax = 1|X| − 1|V |, and α is a constant between 0
and 1. Here α can be used to control the tradeoff between
false positives and false negatives. A higher value of alpha
enables the adversary to insert a larger number of sybils
undetected but reduces the false positives. On the other
hand, a smaller value of α reduces the number of Sybils
that can be introduced undetected but at the cost of higher
number of false positives.
Given these practical considerations, we can formulate
a weaker security guarantee for SybilInfer:
THEOREM C. Given a certain “natural” threshold
value for EXX in an honest social network, a dis-
honest region performing a Sybil attack will exceed
it after introducing a certain number of Sybil nodes.

(b) Low degree compromised nodes
Figure 3. Synthetic Scale Free Topology: SybilInfer Evaluation as a function of additional Sybil
identities (ψ) introduced by colluding entities. False negatives denote the total number of dishon-
est identities accepted by SybilInfer while false positives denote the number of honest nodes that
are misclassiﬁed.
This theorem is the result of Theorem B that demonstrates
that the conductance keeps decreasing as the number of
Sybils attached to a dishonest region increases. This in
turn will slow down the mixing time between the hon-
est and dishonest region, leading to an increasingly large
EXX.
Intuitively, as the attack becomes larger, the cut be-
tween honest and dishonest nodes becomes increasingly
distinct, which makes Sybil detection easier. It is impor-
tant to note that as more Sybils are introduced into the
dishonest region, the probability of the whole region be-
ing detected as an attack increases, not only the new Sybil
nodes. This provides strong disincentives to the adver-
sary from performing larger Sybil attacks, since even pre-
viously undetected malicious nodes might be ﬂagged as
Sybils.
4.3 Experimental evaluation using synthetic
data
We ﬁrst experimentally demonstrate the validity of
Theorem C using synthetic topologies. Our experiments
consist of building synthetic social network topologies, in-
jecting a variable number of Sybil nodes, and applying
SybilInfer to establish how many of them are detected. A
key issue we explore is the number of introduced Sybil
nodes under which Sybil attacks are not detected.
Social networks exhibit a scale-free (or power law)
node degree topology [21]. Our network synthesis al-
gorithm replicates this structure through preferential at-
tachment, following the methodology of Nagaraja [18].
We create m0 initial nodes connected in a clique, and
then for each new node v, we create m new edges to
existing nodes, such that the probability of choosing any
Pr[(v, i)] = di(cid:80)
given node is proportional to the degree of that node; i.e.:
, where di is the degree of node i. In
our simulations, we use m = 5, giving an average node
degree of 10.
j dj
In such a scale free topology of 1000 nodes, we con-
sider a fraction f = 10% of the nodes to be compro-
mised by a single adversary. The compromised nodes are
distributed uniformly at random in the topology. Com-
promised nodes introduce ψ additional Sybil nodes and
establish a scale free topology amongst themselves. We
conﬁgure SybilInfer to use 20 samples for computing the
marginal probabilities, and label as honest the set of nodes
whose marginal probability of being honest is greater than
0.5. The experiment is repeated 100 times with different
scale free topologies.
Figure 3(a) illustrates the false positives and false neg-
atives classiﬁcations returned by SybilInfer, for varying
value of ψ, the number of additional Sybil nodes intro-
duced. We observe that when ψ < 100, α = 0.7 , then all
the malicious identities are classiﬁed as honest by Sybil-
Infer. However, there is a threshold at ψ = 100, be-
yond which all of the Sybil identities, including the ini-
tially compromised entities are ﬂagged as attackers. This
is because beyond this point, the EXX for the Sybil region
exceeds the natural threshold leading to full detection, val-
idating Theorem C. The value ψ = 100 is clearly the op-
timal attack strategy, in which the attacker can introduce
the maximal number of Sybils without being detected. We
also note that even in the worst case, the false positives are
less than 5%. The false positive nodes have been misclas-
siﬁed because these nodes are closer to the Sybil region;
SybilInfer is thus incentive compatible in the sense that
nodes which have mostly honest friends are likely not to
be misclassiﬁed.

tities as a function of the compromised fraction of nodes
f. Note that our theoretical prediction (which is strategy-
independent) matches closely with the attacker strategy
of connecting Sybil nodes in a scale free topology. The
adversary is able to introduce roughly about 1 additional
Sybil identity per real entity. For instance, at f = 0.2,
the total number of Sybil identities is 0.37. As we observe
from the ﬁgure the ability of the adversary to just include
about one additional Sybil identity per compromised node
embedded in the social network remains constant, no mat-
ter the fraction f of compromised nodes in the network.

total malicious and Sybil identities as a func-
tion of real malicious entities.
4.4 Experimental evaluation using real-world
data
We can also see the effect of varying the threshold
EXX. As α is increased from 0.65 to 0.7, the ψ for the
optimal attacker strategy increases from 70 to 100. This is
because an increase in the threshold EXX allows the ad-
versary to insert more Sybils undetected. The advantage
of increasing α lies in reducing the worst case false pos-
itives. We can see that by increasing α from 0.7 to 0.75,
the worst case false positives can be reduced from 5% to
2%.
Note that for the remainder of the paper, we shall use
α = 0.7.
We also wish to show that the security of our scheme
depends primarily on the number of colluding malicious
nodes and not on the number of attack edges. To this end,
we chose the compromised nodes to have the lowest num-
ber of attack edges (instead of choosing them uniformly
at random), and repeat the experiment. Figure 3(b) illus-
trates that the false positives and false negatives classiﬁca-
tions returned by SybilInfer, where the average number of
attack edges are 500. Note that these results are very simi-
lar to the previous case illustrated in Figure 3(a), where the
number of attack edges is around 800. This analysis in-
dicates that the security provided by SybilInfer primarily
depends on the number of colluding entities. The implica-
tion is that the compromise of high degree nodes does not
yield any signiﬁcant advantage to the adversary. As we
shall see, this is in contrast to SybilGuard and SybilLimit,
which are extremely vulnerable when high degree nodes
are compromised.
Our next experiment establishes the number of Sybil
nodes that can be inserted into a network given different
fractions of compromised nodes. We vary the fraction of
compromised colluding nodes f, and for each value of f,
we compute the optimal number of additional Sybil iden-
tities that the attackers can insert, as in the previous exper-
iment.
Next we validate the security guarantees provided by
SybilInfer using a sampled LiveJournal topology. A vari-
ant of snowball [9] sampling was used to collect the full
data set data, comprising over 100,000 nodes.
To perform our experiments we chose a random node
and collect all nodes in its three hop neighbourhood. The
resulting social network has about 50,000 nodes. We then
perform some pre-processing step on the sub-graph:
• Nodes with degree less than 3 are removed, to ﬁlter
out nodes that are too new to the social network, or
inactive.
• If there is an edge between A → B, but no edge
between B → A, then A → B is removed (to only
keep the symmetric friendship relationships.)
We note that despite this pre-processing nodes all degrees
