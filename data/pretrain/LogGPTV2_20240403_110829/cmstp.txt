- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
`cmstp` is a command-line utility used to install or remove a Connection Manager service profile. When used without optional parameters, `cmstp` installs a service profile with default settings appropriate to the operating system and the user's permissions.

**Syntax:**

#### Syntax 1 - Custom Installation Application
This syntax is typically used in a custom installation application. To use this syntax, you must run `cmstp` from the directory that contains the `.exe` file.

```
.exe /q:a /c:cmstp.exe .inf [/nf] [/s] [/u]
```

#### Syntax 2 - Direct Command-Line Usage
```
cmstp.exe [/nf] [/s] [/u] [drive:][path]serviceprofilefilename.inf
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `.exe` | Specifies, by name, the installation package that contains the profile to be installed. Required for Syntax 1, but not valid for Syntax 2. |
| `/q:a` | Specifies that the profile should be installed without prompting the user. The verification message that the installation has succeeded will still appear. Required for Syntax 1, but not valid for Syntax 2. |
| `[drive:][path].inf` | Specifies, by name, the configuration file that determines how the profile should be installed. The `[drive:][path]` parameter is not valid for Syntax 1. |
| `/nf` | Specifies that the support files should not be installed. |
| `/s` | Specifies that the service profile should be installed or uninstalled silently (without prompting for user response or displaying a verification message). This is the only parameter that can be used in combination with `/u`. |
| `/u` | Specifies that the service profile should be uninstalled. |
| `/?` | Displays help at the command prompt. |

**Examples:**

1. **Install the `fiction` service profile without any support files:**
   ```sh
   fiction.exe /c:cmstp.exe fiction.inf /nf
   ```

2. **Silently install the `fiction` service profile for a single user:**
   ```sh
   fiction.exe /c:cmstp.exe fiction.inf /s /su
   ```

3. **Silently uninstall the `fiction` service profile:**
   ```sh
   fiction.exe /c:cmstp.exe fiction.inf /s /u
   ```

By following these guidelines, you can effectively use `cmstp` to manage Connection Manager service profiles on your Windows Server systems.
