close  to  1.    From  inequality  (8),  this  can  be  accomplished  by 
increasing the redundancy number m regardless of the value of s

Therefore, in theory, our watermark based correlation scheme 
can,  with  arbitrarily  small  averaged  adjustment  of  inter-packet 
timing (for embedding the watermark), achieve arbitrarily close to 
a  100%  watermark  detection  rate  and  arbitrarily  close  to  a  0%

7.1  Limitation 
In  theory,  our  watermark  correlation  is  effective  and  robust 
against  random  delays  that  are  independent  and  identically 
distributed (iid) over the set of watermarked packets. For random 
delays  that  are  independent but have different distributions over

perturbation s/2 may have to be greater than a specific non-zero 
value to achieve an arbitrarily high watermark detection rate and 
arbitrarily low watermark collision rate at the same time. This is 
due to the fact that the random variable Xk = dj,k-di,k may have a 
non-zero  mean  if  dj,k  and  di,k    are  of  different  distributions.  In 
addition,  our  watermark  correlation  method  is  not  as  robust 
against non-independent random delays. An extreme case would 
be  when  the  attacker  knows  exactly  which  packets  have  been 
delayed and by how much, making it much easier to corrupt the 
embedded watermark bits.  
8.  EXPERIMENTS 
The  goal  of  the  experiments  is  to  answer  the  following 
questions about watermark-based correlation (as well as existing 
timing-based  correlation) 
timing 
perturbation by the attacker:

1)  How  vulnerable  are  existing  (passive) 
timing-based 
correlation schemes to random timing perturbations? 
2)  How robust is watermark-based correlation against random 
timing perturbations?

correlation 
4)  What  is  the  collision  (false  positive)  rate  of  watermark-
based correlation? 
5)  How  well  do  the  models  of  watermark  bit  robustness, 
watermark  detection  rate  and  watermark  collision  rate 
predict the measured values? 
We  have  used  two  flow  sets,  labeled  FS1  and  FS2  in  our 
experiments. FS1 is derived from over 49 million packet headers 
of  the  Bell  Labs-1  Traces  of  NLANR[9].    It  contains  121  SSH 
flows  that  have  at  least  600  packets  and  that  are  at  least  300 
seconds long. FS2 contains 1000 telnet flows generated from an 
empirically-derived  distribution[3]  of  telnet  packet  inter-arrival 
times, using the tcplib[2] tool.
