Dependability on the Last Frontier
Alex Hills
Carnegie Mellon University
Although Alaska is well-known for its frontier image, it is actually highly dependent on technological systems and
networks. Sometimes these are reliable, and sometimes they are not. A 38-year veteran of the Great Land, Alex Hills
will tell you about some Alaskan systems that have been dependable and some others that have fallen short-all true
and interesting stories.
Speaker:
Dr. Alex Hills is Distinguished Service Professor at Carnegie Mellon University and also President of Alex Hills
Associates, based in Palmer, Alaska. After his arrival in Alaska 38 years ago, he spent seven years living and
working in the Alaska bush, where he was deeply involved in developing rural Alaska's broadcast and
telecommunications network.
For example, Dr. Hills served as the first full time General Manager of Kotzebue's KOTZ, the only radio station in
northwest Alaska, and the residents of the region also elected him the first President of OTZ Telephone Cooperative,
which provides telephone service in the area's villages. He subsequently assisted four other bush communities in
starting their own public radio stations. Years later, at Carnegie Mellon, he created the university's "Wireless
Andrew" network, which established the vision for the technology we now call "Wi-Fi."
Dr. Hills is a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers and was recently elected Alaska Engineer
of the Year by the Alaska Engineering Societies.
