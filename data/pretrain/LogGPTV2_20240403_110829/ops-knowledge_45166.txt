User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题nginx + php-fpm + v8js crashing I have a problem concerning v8js extension for php. I needed to install it on my server (and did) (CentOS 6.5, Nginx 1.0.15, php 5.5.12) 

but whenever I give such a simple test to it: http://pastebin.com/KtyLYccs

it crashes php-fpm child process

[11-Jul-2014 15:45:44] WARNING: [pool www] child 19409 exited on signal 11 (SIGSEGV) after 159.191070 seconds from start
[11-Jul-2014 15:45:44] NOTICE: [pool www] child 19577 started


any ideas what may have gone wrong? also whatever logs/configs you need, just tell and I'll share them with you

Assistant: found solution, you need to have php compiled without ZTS enabled
