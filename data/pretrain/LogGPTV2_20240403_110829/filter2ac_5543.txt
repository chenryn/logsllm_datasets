### Title: Backdooring and Hijacking Azure AD Accounts by Abusing External Identities

**Abstract:**

External identities in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) enable collaboration with users outside of an organization. These external users, often referred to as guest users, can be granted access to specific resources and work alongside internal users. Their identities are managed either in a different Azure AD tenant or as unmanaged accounts outside of Azure AD.

This presentation delves into the mechanics of external identities in Azure AD and how they facilitate B2B (Business-to-Business) collaboration. During our research, we identified several implementation flaws that allow for novel methods of backdooring and hijacking Azure AD accounts, even from a regular user's perspective. Additionally, we discovered ways to exploit these external identity links to elevate privileges, bypass Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and circumvent Conditional Access policies. Notably, all these attacks were possible in the default configuration of Azure AD.

The talk will provide a comprehensive overview of the external identities concept, the technical details that enabled these vulnerabilities, and practical strategies for hardening your Azure AD environment against such attacks. We will also discuss methods for detecting and mitigating the abuse of these vulnerabilities.

**Key Points:**
- **Understanding External Identities:** How external identities function in Azure AD and their role in B2B collaboration.
- **Identified Flaws:** Detailed explanation of the implementation flaws that allow for account backdooring and hijacking.
- **Exploitation Techniques:** Methods to exploit external identity links for privilege escalation, MFA bypass, and Conditional Access policy evasion.
- **Default Configuration Vulnerabilities:** Insights into why these attacks are possible in the default Azure AD setup.
- **Hardening and Detection:** Strategies to strengthen Azure AD security and detect potential abuse of external identity vulnerabilities.

By the end of this session, attendees will have a deeper understanding of the risks associated with external identities in Azure AD and the steps they can take to protect their organizations.
