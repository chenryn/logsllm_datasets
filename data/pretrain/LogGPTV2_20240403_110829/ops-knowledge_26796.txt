User: I work on a project to control my PC with a remote, and a infrared receptor on an Arduino.
I need to simulate keyboard input with a process on linux who will listen arduino output and simulate keyboard input. I can dev it with Python or C++, but i think python is more easy.
After many search, i found many result for... windows u_u
Anyone have a library for this ?
thanks
EDIT: I found that /dev/input/event3 is my keyboard. I think write in to simulate keyboard, i'm searching how do that
Assistant: The most generic solution is to use pseudo-terminals: you connect tttyn to the standard in and standard out of the program you want to monitor, and use pttyn to read and write to it.
Alternatively, you can create two pipes, which you connect to the standard in and standard out of the program to be monitored before doing the exec.  This is much simpler, but the pipes look more like a file than a terminal to the program being monitored.
