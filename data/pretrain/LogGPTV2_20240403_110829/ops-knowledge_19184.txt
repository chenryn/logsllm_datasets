User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Wireshark running all the time Would this cause an issue eventually or is always ok to leave running. SHould it's logs be saved every no and again and if so when?

Assistant: The real question is: what is the purpose of this ?

If you want something that can continuously log and monitor network traffic, and attach to a trace whenever you need to, consider a solution that doesn't have such massive overhead, such as dumpcap (included in the wireshark distribution.)

Personally, I use Network Security Toolkit (NST), which is a specialzied distribution that contains tons of analysis and measurement software in one easy-to-deploy DVD or VMware image, and supports fully transparent SPAN capturing of all traffic.
