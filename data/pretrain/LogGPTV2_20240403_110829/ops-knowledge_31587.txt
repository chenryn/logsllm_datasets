I am currently working on setting up a project using Google App Engine with Python. Given my familiarity with Eclipse, I opted to use PyDev as the development environment. After overcoming some initial challenges, I have managed to get a basic "Hello World" program to run, but it is not functioning perfectly yet. Specifically, I am encountering an issue where the `webapp2` import is flagged as unresolved.

I have followed all the instructions I could find and believe that I have correctly linked the Google App Engine libraries. However, I am unable to locate `webapp2` in any of the library files, even after performing a thorough search. As I am quite new to both Python and the Google App Engine, I suspect that this problem, while likely simple, has been made more complex by my lack of experience.

My setup includes:
- Operating System: OS X
- IDE: Eclipse Indigo Service Release 1
- Plugin: Latest version of PyDev (downloaded as of Tuesday evening)

**Solution Provided:**
Adding `${GOOGLE_APP_ENGINE}/lib/webapp2-2.5.2` to the "External Libraries" in the PyDev settings resolved the issue for me.
- App Engine SDK Version: 1.8.2
- Python Version: 2.7

If you are facing a similar issue, try adding the `webapp2` library to your external libraries in PyDev. This should help resolve the unresolved import error.
