### Apache Airflow version
2.1.3 (latest released)
### Operating System
Debian
### Versions of Apache Airflow Providers
_No response_
### Deployment
Other Docker-based deployment
### Deployment details
Custom docker image on k8s
### What happened
New dag version was written in same named dag. The only difference was one of
specified tags got changed in case, for ex. "test" to "Test". With huge amount
of dags this causes scheduler immediately to crash due to constraint
violation.
### What you expected to happen
Tags are refreshed correctly without crash of scheduler.
### How to reproduce
  1. Create dag with tags in running airflow cluster
  2. Update dag with change of case of one of tags for ex. "test" to "Test"
  3. Watch scheduler crash continuously
### Anything else
Alternative option is to make tags case sensitive...
