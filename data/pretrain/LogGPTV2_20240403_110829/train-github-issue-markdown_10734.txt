# Environment
- **Windows Build Number:** Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.18362.239]
- **Windows Terminal Version:** 0.2.1831.0

# Steps to Reproduce
1. I edited the settings to add a key binding for the `newWindow` command, as specified in the following GitHub reference:
   - [AppKeyBindingsSerialization.cpp, Line 28](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/blob/v0.2.1831.0/src/cascadia/TerminalApp/AppKeyBindingsSerialization.cpp#L28)
2. The configuration snippet added to the settings is as follows:
   ```json
   {
       "command": "newWindow",
       "keys": [
           "ctrl+n"
       ]
   }
   ```

# Expected Behavior
- When pressing `Ctrl + N`, a new Windows Terminal window should open.

# Actual Behavior
- No action occurs when `Ctrl + N` is pressed.
