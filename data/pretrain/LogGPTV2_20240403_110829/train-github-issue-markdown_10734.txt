# Environment
    Windows build number: Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.18362.239]
    Windows Terminal version (if applicable): 0.2.1831.0
# Steps to reproduce
I edit my settings to add a key binding for `newWindow` as listed here:
https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/blob/v0.2.1831.0/src/cascadia/TerminalApp/AppKeyBindingsSerialization.cpp#L28
This is a sample of the configuration:
                {
                    "command" : "newWindow",
                    "keys" : 
                    [
                        "ctrl+n"
                    ]
                }
# Expected behavior
Upon pressing `ctrl+n` a new Windows terminal window should be opened.
# Actual behavior
Nothing happens.
