User: How to install MySQL on a remote server and configure basic security for it?
Assistant: 1. Install MySQL Using an account with administrator privileges on the remote server, you can install MySQL with the following command: Ubuntu/Debian system: sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install mysql-server CentOS system: sudo yum update sudo yum install mysql -server 2. Configure basic security 2.1 Change MySQL root user password MySQL root user has no password by default. A password can be set with the following command: sudo mysql_secure_installation Follow the prompts, enter a new password in the terminal and confirm it. When prompted to remove anonymous users, choose Y. Prompt whether to prohibit remote access of the root user, if you only use MySQL locally, select Y. 2.2 Prohibit remote root users from accessing MySQL By changing the MySQL configuration file, you can prohibit remote root users from accessing MySQL. First edit the MySQL configuration file: sudo nano /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf Find the bind-address line and comment it out: #bind-address = 127.0.0.1 Next, add the following: [ mysqld] skip-networking Save and exit the editor. 2.3 Create a separate MySQL user Create a separate user in MySQL as a regular user and application access control, which can improve system security. Open the MySQL terminal: sudo mysql Enter the following command to create a new user and grant basic privileges: CREATE USER 'newuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password'; GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, ALTER ON *.* TO 'newuser'@'localhost'; FLUSH PRIVILEGES; Replace "newuser" and "password" in the above command with the username and password you want to create. This user will have permissions to execute SQL queries and other operations in the local MySQL instance on the server. Save and exit the MySQL terminal: exit The above steps can help you install MySQL on the remote server and configure basic security measures. In addition, we recommend that you enable the SSL protocol in MySQL for encrypted communication to improve data confidentiality.
