When I am using DropDownMenu and as `menuStyle` I am setting transparency but
it is being set for a div whose role is `menu` but a "div" above that is
actually controlling the transparency.
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
Make the Menu transparent
## Current Behavior
The menu is not becoming transparent.
