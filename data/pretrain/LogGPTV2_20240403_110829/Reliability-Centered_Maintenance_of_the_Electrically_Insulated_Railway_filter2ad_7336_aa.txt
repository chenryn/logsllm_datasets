Abstract—Maintenance is an important way to increase system
dependability: timely inspections, repairs and renewals can sig-
niﬁcantly increase a system’s reliability, availability and life time.
At the same time, maintenance incurs costs and planned down
time. Thus, good maintenance planning has to balance between
these factors.
In this paper, we study the effect of different maintenance
strategies on the electrically insulated railway joint (EI-joint),
a critical asset in railroad tracks for train detection, and a
relative frequent cause for train disruptions. Together with
experts in maintenance engineering, we have modeled the EI-joint
as a fault maintenance tree (FMT), i.e. a fault tree augmented
with maintenance aspects. We show how complex maintenance
concepts, such as condition-based maintenance with periodic
inspections, are naturally modeled by FMTs, and how several key
performance indicators, such as the system reliability, number of
failures, and costs, can be analysed.
The faithfulness of quantitative analyses heavily depend on
the accuracy of the parameter values in the models. Here, we
have been in the unique situation that extensive data could be
collected, both from incident registration databases, as well as
from interviews with domain experts from several companies.
This made that we could construct a model that faithfully predicts
the expected number of failures at system level.
Our analysis shows that that the current maintenance policy is
close to cost-optimal. It is possible to increase joint reliability, e.g.
by performing more inspections, but the additional maintenance
costs outweigh the reduced cost of failures.
INTRODUCTION
Reliability-centred maintenance (RCM) [1] is an important
trend in infrastructural asset management. Its goal is to obtain
optimal maintenance policies by maintaining crucial objects
more intensively than less crucial ones. Thus, RCM tries to
ﬁnd an optimal balance between maintenance cost and system
dependability, by placing maintenance effort where it matters
most. To make such decisions, RCM requires a good insight in
the effect of a maintenance policy on the system dependability,
with key performance indicators as the system reliability,
availability, and mean time between failures, etc. In fact, since
RCM intertwines dependability and maintenance, it asks for an
integral analysis of these two aspects. This paper demonstrates
how such integral analysis can work and leads to useful results
on RCM strategies, by studying a typical infrastructural asset
via fault-maintenance trees.

Fault tree analysis (FTA) [2] is a popular methodology
for dependability analysis. When the failure rates of the
components are known, then FTA can compute the odds of a
failure of the entire system. In practice, however, these failure
rates are strongly affected by maintenance, which is not taken
into account by fault trees. Thus, FTA is not suitable when the
maintenance policy is subject to variation.
To overcome this limitation, and assess the impact of differ-
ent maintenance strategies on system reliability and costs, fault
maintenance trees (FMTs) have been developed [3]. These
combine fault trees with maintenance models, representing the
required ingredients for maintenance: component degradation,
inspections, and repairs.
Moreover, FMTs necessitate the introduction of a new
gate: the RDEP (rate dependency) gate makes that the failure
of one component can accelerate the degeneration of other
components. In this paper, we show that RDEPs are essential
to faithfully model the EI-joint.
FMTs support the calculation of a number of important
dependability metrics, such as the system reliability, availabil-
ity, MTTF, expected cost etc. Technically, these analyses are
realized via statistical model checking [4], a novel Monte Carlo

EI-joints. Electrically insulated joints (EI-joints, see Figure
1) are an important railroad element, facilitating train detec-
tion and protection by electrically separating different track
sections. They are a relatively frequent cause for failures and
service disruption, so good maintenance is crucial for EI-joints.
Moreover, maintenance of the EI-joint is typical for other
assets as well, with both random and wear-induced failures,
repairs and renewals, and different options for maintenance
strategies, and signiﬁcant costs for failures and maintenance.
Modeling and analysis. In close collaboration with the Dutch
national railway network infrastructure manager ProRail, we
have conducted a reliability analysis of electrically insulated
joints. We analyze the dependability of these joints, computing
the reliability, expected number of failures, and expected costs
over time. In particular, we investigate a reference maintenance
strategy, as well as potentially better strategies. We study
(1) variations in inspection intervals, (2) periodic preventive
replacements, (3) replacement of an entire joint instead of re-
pairing individual components, and (4) repairs when observing
higher or lower degradation levels.
Our analysis ﬁnds that (1) the current inspection policy
is nearly cost-optimal when combining cost of failure and
cost of maintenance, (2) periodic preventive replacements
improve reliability, but are more expensive than corrective
replacements, and (3) the optimal inspection policy does not
vary much with the load level of the track.
An important contribution is the extensive validation of our
model: To provide conﬁdence in the results of our analysis,
we have compared the results predicted from our analysis with
actual data from a failure database. Our predicted results agree
with actual results from the ﬁeld strongly enough to make
recommendations based on our model.
Last but not least, we conclude that FMTs are a useful
framework to investigate maintenance optimization problems
from industrial practice: FMTs are a convenient model, have
sufﬁcient expressive power to capture complex maintenance
aspects; and are able to produce predictive analysis results.
Related work. Many analysis techniques and extensions for
fault trees exist, for an overview we refer the reader to [6].
Current FTA techniques support simple repair strategies by
either equipping leaves with repair times [2] or with repair
boxes [7], but do not consider preventive maintenance.
More complex repair policies are supported by the Re-
pairable Fault Tree [8] formalism by Codetta-Raiteri et al., but
this formalism still requires exponentially distributed failure
and repair times.
Non-exponential failure time distributions can be used in
the tool by Bucci et al. [9], which can be used to analyze
component failures due to wear over time. This tool, however,
does not consider maintenance to undo this wear.
Degraded states can be modeled in Extended Fault Trees
by Buchacker et al. [11] which also supports components with
failure rates that depend on the states of other components.
Failure times are still modeled as exponential distributions, and
this method does not include repairs or inspections dependent
on full subtrees.
Looking outside FTA, Carnevali et al. [10] consider main-
tenance in phased systems where resources are used in a
sequence of tasks, with detection and repair actions inbetween

these tasks.
In systems consisting of
identical components, Van
Noortwijk and Frangopol [12] consider in detail two models
of the effects of various maintenance choices on the reliability
and cost in civil infrastructure, but these do not generalize to
systems of multiple different components.
Organization of the paper. This paper begins with a de-
scription of EI-joints in Section II and the methodology in
Section III. The modeling of the EI-joint by FMTs is explained
in Section IV. Section V explains how this model is analyzed,
and provides the results of this analysis. Finally, we provide
our conclusions in Section VI.
II. CASE DESCRIPTION: MAINTENANCE OF EI-JOINTS
Electrically insulated joints (see Figures 1 and 2) are a
railway component used in the detection of the occupancy of a
railroad segment. They consist of a piece of insulating material
between the ends of two tracks, to keep different segments
of track electrically separated, while mechanically holding the
tracks together.
Due to the large number of these joints in the railroad
network, EI-joints are a relatively frequent cause of disrup-
tions. Failures can occur for various reasons, both internal
to the joint such as broken bolts, and external to the joint
such as metal shavings bypassing the insulation. Inspections
can be performed to determine whether some of these fail-
ures are likely to occur soon, and corrective action, such as
sweeping away iron shavings, can prevent certain failures from
occurring. Other failures can only be prevented or corrected
by replacing the entire joint. Some failures, such as vandalism,
cannot be prevented by maintenance.
A. Purpose and operation
Many railroad networks use electrical detection to de-
termine the presence of trains on the tracks (e.g.
in The
Netherlands [13]). This system works by detecting when the
axles of a train electrically connect the two rails, illustrated
in Figure 2. To determine the location of a train, tracks are
divided into several, electrically isolated, sections.
To detect the presence of a train, a small detection voltage
is applied across the rails at one end of a section, and detected

at the other end. A train on the section will short circuit
the detection current, so the signal is not detected, and the
interlocking system locks switches in their positions, sets
signals appropriately, etc.
The location of a train is determined by creating electrically
separate sections of track, each of which has its own detection
current and detectors. On straight stretches of rail,
these
sections are several hundred metres to several kilometres in
length. In areas with switches or level crossings, the sections
are often much shorter.
B. Joint construction
The electrically insulated joint consists of a layer of insu-
lating material placed between two sections of rail. The section
of insulating material is called the end post. In glued joints,
this post is produced at the factory attached to the ends of
the rails, and the entire assembly including several metres of
track is welded in place. In constructed joints, the end post
is a separate component and mechanically held in place after
assembly on site.
The rails are further held together by attaching one ﬁshplate
on each side of the rail with bolts. Insulating material is used to
prevent the ﬁshplates making electrical contact with the rails.
Likewise, insulating bushings maintain separation between the
bolts and the rails. Since the joint forms a weak point in the
rail, two sleepers are normally placed close together where
the joint is located, providing increased support to prevent the
joint from ﬂexing and breaking.
C. Failure modes
EI-joints are subject to two general categories of failures:
failures where the joint no longer provides a
Mechanical
physical connection of the rails, and electrical failures that lead
to an unintended electrical connection between the rails. The
former type are uncommon, but have potentially catastrophic
consequences (derailment of trains). The latter failures are
more common and are generally not considered safety-critical
due to the fail-safe nature of the detection system.
Table I lists the most signiﬁcant failure modes, together
with important failure parameters: Each mode is characterized
by the expected time to failure assuming no maintenance is
performed, the number of degradation phases we consider our
modeling, and the probability that a given joint is subject to this
failure mode. The latter is needed, since not all failure modes
occur in all situations. For instance, Line 1 in the table shows
that only 10% of the EI-joints are subject to poor geometry;
90% of the joints have a sufﬁciently stable surface to that this
failure mode never occurs.
D. Inspections and repairs
A possible maintenance policy described by ProRail con-
sists of several annual
inspections, followed by corrective
maintenance to repair any faults found by the inspection. This
policy is taken as the reference policy in this paper.
The corrective action to be taken depends on the type of
fault. Some faults, such as metal shavings causing a short
circuit, can be immediately repaired without affecting any
other failure mode. Other failure modes require a more general
corrective action, such as grinding the surface of the rails, that
also repairs wear of other failure modes. Finally, some failures
require a complete replacement of the joint, thus repairing
degradation of all other failure modes.

The numbers in the basic events correspond to the section numbers of the
failure modes. Failure modes 5a and 5b are speciﬁc causes of failure mode 5
(broken glue connection), due to manufacturing defects and installation errors,
respectively. Failure modes 6, 7, and 16 have been merged into mode 6, as
these are speciﬁc causes of the same fault. Failure mode 10 (short due to
shavings) is separated into 10a for joints without additional protective coating,
and 10b for joints with protective coating.
E. Problem Statement
We like to use the EI-joint to ﬁnd out if FMTs are a
useful tool to investigate maintenance questions, and to obtain
trustworthy results. In particular, we like to know if the mod-
eling power is sufﬁcient to model the complex maintenance
policies used in practice; if we can analyze relevant questions,
and if we get faithful results that are useable in practice.
The key question to be analysed for EI-joint is if the current
maintenance strategy is effective and efﬁcient. That is, whether
the desired reliability requirements are met, whether it is cost
effective, and whether improvements are possible.
III. METHODOLOGY
We have modeled the EI-joint in terms of fault maintenance
trees. Below, we brieﬂy describe the main ingredients of this
framework: fault trees, maintenance models, analysis methods
and metrics.

A. Fault Trees
Fault trees (FTs) are a widely used, graphical method for
performing reliability and safety analysis [2] [6]. They are
directed acyclic graphs in which the leaves, called basic events
(BEs) describe component failures, and internal nodes, called
gates or intermediate events, describe how these component
failures interact and propagate to cause system failures. The
root of the tree, called the top level event, denotes such system
failure.
The gates of standard fault trees are AND-, OR-, and
VOT(k)-gates, which fail when, respectively, all, any, or at
least k of their children fail. The leaves are traditionally
equipped either with failure probabilities, describing the prob-
ability of each leaf failing within the time of interest, or
exponential failure rates, describing the progression of failure
probabilities over time.
B. Fault maintenance trees
Fault maintenance trees (FMTs) [3] are an extension of FTs
that can model several additional contributors to system relia-
bility, including gradual degradation of components over time,
inspections and repairs, and dependencies where one event
triggers an accelerated degradation of another component. The
FMT modeling the EI-joint is shown in Figure 3.
