### Satellite Communication Latency Analysis

When data is transmitted via satellite, it experiences a one-way delay of approximately 125 milliseconds (ms) due to the distance to the satellite and back [2, 15]. The return trip adds another 125 ms, resulting in a theoretical minimum round-trip time (RTT) of 250 ms.

#### High Percentile Latencies in Satellite ISPs

We expect satellite Internet service providers (ISPs) to exhibit high 1st percentile latencies. However, we also investigate whether these ISPs have high 99th percentile latencies. For this analysis, we use data from the ISI survey IT63c (20150206), which provides hundreds of ping samples per IP address. This allows us to study a limited number of addresses in detail.

**Figure 11** illustrates the relationship between 1st percentile and 99th percentile latencies for the surveyed IP addresses. We separate addresses that the Maxmind database maps to known satellite providers, such as Hughes and ViaSat. 

- **Left Plot:** Shows the overall distribution excluding addresses from known satellite ISPs.
- **Right Plot:** Displays only the addresses from known satellite ISPs.

Note that the precision of values just above the ISI timeout of three seconds is limited to integers, creating horizontal bands in the plots.

The right plot reveals that the 1st percentile RTT for all satellite-only ISP addresses exceeds 500 ms, nearly double the theoretical minimum. Some points in the left plot remain within the satellite-like cluster, likely due to rural broadband providers that offer both satellite and other connectivity, such as xplorenet in Canada, which had at least one IP address with a 1st percentile below 0.5 seconds.

Each satellite provider forms a distinct cluster in the scatter plot. Two smaller providers, Horizon and iiNet, show near-horizontal lines, indicating varying 1st percentiles but fairly consistent 99th percentiles. This suggests that queuing for these addresses is capped, but the base distance to the satellite varies by geography.

Although some satellite hosts have remarkably high RTTs, up to 517 ms, their 99th percentile values are predominantly below 3 seconds. They do not have such high 99th percentile values as the rest of the hosts with 1st percentiles over 0.3 seconds. Thus, satellite autonomous systems (ASes) account for very few of the high-latency addresses.

### Autonomous Systems with High Latency Addresses

Next, we investigate the ASes and geographic locations with the most high-latency addresses to identify relationships. For this analysis, we use Zmap scans from 2015, which ping every IPv4 address, covering all ASes. We chose the May 22, June 21, and July 9 Zmap scans, conducted at different times of the day, on different days of the week, and in different months, as shown in Table 3.

For each Zmap scan, we use Maxmind to find the ASN and geographic location for every address that responded.

#### ASes Prone to RTTs Greater than 1 Second

**Figure 7** shows that the percentage of addresses with high latency Echo Responses remained stable over time, with around 5% of addresses observing RTTs greater than a second in each scan. We refer to these addresses as "turtles" and investigate their distribution across ASes.

For each Zmap scan, we identified the turtles and ranked ASes by the number of contributed turtles. We then summed the turtles from each AS across the three scans and sorted ASes accordingly, showing the top ten in Table 4. For example, AS26615 had the second-largest sum of turtles across the three Zmap scans but was ranked third in the May 2015 scan.

Inspecting the owners of these ASes reveals that a majority are cellular. AS26599 (TELEFONICA BRASIL), a cellular AS in Brazil, has the most turtles, more than double that of the next largest AS in each scan. The next two ASes, AS45609 (Bharti Airtel Ltd.) and AS26615 (Tim Celular), are also cellular, and so are five of the remaining seven ASes in the top ten.

Notably, most cellular ASes have around 70% of all probed addresses being turtles. AS9829, one of the two ASes with turtles accounting for less than 50% of probed addresses, offers other services in addition to cellular. AS4134, with only 1% of its probed addresses being turtles, also offers other services. We believe that the cellular addresses observe high RTTs while others do not, explaining the low ratio of probed addresses with RTTs greater than 1 second.

Finally, nine ASes were observed in the top ten in every scan. AS4134 was the only exception, ranking 11th in the June and July scans. Thus, the ASes with the most turtles remain consistent over time.

#### Continents with the Most Turtles

Table 5 shows the continents with the most turtles. South America and Asia alone account for around 75% of all turtles. Additionally, around a quarter of all addresses in South America and a third of the addresses in Africa experienced RTTs greater than 1 second in each scan. In contrast, only 1% of North America's addresses are turtles, with more than half coming from a single ASN: AS22394.

#### ASes Prone to RTTs Greater than 100 Seconds

Next, we investigate the ASes of addresses with RTTs greater than 100 seconds in the three Zmap scans, referring to these addresses as "sleepy-turtles." We consider whether these addresses are different from turtles to identify any underlying cause. Following the same process as in Table 4, Table 6 shows the ASes most prone to RTTs greater than 100 seconds.

We find that sleepy-turtles exhibit similarities to turtles. Every AS in Table 6 is cellular, and the ranks of the ASes remain stable over time across the scans. However, there is more variation in the percentage of sleepy-turtles among all probed addresses for an AS, suggesting that the fraction of addresses experiencing RTTs greater than 100 seconds is less stable over time.

### Is It the First Ping?

RTTs consistently greater than a second are sufficiently high to make interactive application traffic impractical. We suspected that the latencies measured by ISI and Zmap might not be typical of regular usage.
