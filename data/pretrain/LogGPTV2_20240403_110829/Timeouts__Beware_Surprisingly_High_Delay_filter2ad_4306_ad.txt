a satellite and back, leading to about 125 ms of one way
delay [2, 15]. Another 125 ms for the return trip yields a
theoretical minimum of 250ms.
We expect satellite ISPs to have high 1st percentile la-
tencies, but we consider whether they have high 99th per-
centile latencies as well. We use data from ISI survey IT63c
(20150206) for this analysis because it provides hundreds of
ping samples per IP address, and we wish to study relatively
few addresses in some detail. Figure 11 shows the plot of
1st percentile latencies vs. the 99th percentile latencies for
addresses in this survey. We separate addresses that the
Maxmind database maps to known satellite providers, in-
cluding Hughes and ViaSat. At left, we show the overall
distribution without addresses from known satellite ISPs; at
right, we show only satellite ISPs. (Recall that the preci-
sion of values just above the ISI timeout of three seconds is
limited to integers; this creates the horizontal bands.) The
satellite-only ISPs plot shows that the 1st percentile RTT for
these addresses exceeds 500ms in all cases, showing that the
RTTs are almost double the theoretical minimum. There are
some points in the left plot that remain within the satellite-
like cluster; at least some of these are from rural broadband
providers that provide both satellite and other connectiv-
ity, such as xplorenet in Canada, which had at least one IP
address report with a below 0.5s ﬁrst percentile.
Each satellite provider has a distinct cluster in this scatter
plot, and two smaller providers, Horizon and iiNet, have
clusters of reports that produce near-horizontal lines in the
graph, with varying 1st percentile but fairly consistent 99th
percentile, as if queuing for these addresses is capped but
the base distance to the satellite varies by geography.
Although some satellite hosts do have remarkably high
RTT values—up to 517s—their 99th percentile values are
predominantly below 3s. They do not have such high 99th
percentile values as the rest of the hosts with over 0.3s ﬁrst
percentiles (those shown on the left graph). Thus, satellite
ASes accounted for very few of the high latency addresses.
6.2 Autonomous Systems with the most high
latency addresses
Next, we investigate the ASes and geographic locations
with the most high latency addresses to identify relation-
ships. For this analysis, we use Zmap scans from 2015 to
identify high latency addresses. Zmap pings every IPv4 ad-
dress, thereby covering addresses from all ASes. We chose
the May 22, Jun 21 and Jul 9 Zmap scans to study. These
scans were conducted at diﬀerent times of the day, on dif-
ferent days of the week and in diﬀerent months, as shown
in Table 3. For each of these Zmap scans, we use Maxmind
to ﬁnd the ASN and geographic location for every address
that responded.
ASes most prone to RTTs greater than 1 second
Figure 7 showed that the percentage of addresses that sent
high latency Echo Responses remained stable over time. In
particular, around 5% of addresses observed RTTs greater
than a second in each scan. We refer to these addresses as
turtles and investigate their distribution across Autonomous
Systems to identify relationships.
For each Zmap scan, we found the turtles and identiﬁed
their AS, and ranked ASes by the number of contributed
turtles. Finally, we summed the turtles from each AS across
the three scans and sort ASes accordingly and show the top
ten in Table 4. For example, AS26615 had the second-largest
sum of turtles across the three Zmap scans, but was ranked
third within the May 2015 scan.
Inspecting the owners of each of these Autonomous Sys-
tems reveals that a majority of them are cellular. AS26599
(TELEFONICA BRASIL), a cellular AS in Brazil, has the
most turtles, more than double that of the next largest AS
in each of the scans. The next two ASes, AS45609 (Bharti
Airtel Ltd.), and AS26615 (Tim Celular), are also cellular,
and so are 5 of the remaining 7 ASes in the top 10.
Also notable is the percentage of responding addresses
that are turtles for these ASes. Most of the cellular ASes
have around 70% of all probed addresses being turtles. AS9829,
one of the two ASes with turtles accounting for lower than
50% of probed addresses, is known to oﬀer other services
in addition to cellular. AS4134, with only 1% of its probed
addresses being turtles, is also known to oﬀer other services.
We believe that the cellular addresses observe high RTTs
while others do not, explaining the low ratio of probed ad-
dresses with RTTs greater than 1 second.
Finally, nine ASes were observed in the top ten in every
scan. AS4134 was the only exception, but it ranked 11th

Table 6: Autonomous Systems sorted by the addresses summed across three Zmap scans for addresses that observed RTTs
greater than 100s. The table shows for each AS: the number and percentage of addresses with RTT greater than 100s and
the rank in that scan.
in the June and July scans. Thus, the Autonomous Sytems
with the most turtles also remain consistent over time.
Table 5 shows the continents with the most turtles. South
America and Asia alone account for around 75% of all tur-
tles. Further, around a quarter of all addresses in South
America and a third of the addresses in Africa experienced
RTTs greater than 1s in each scan. On the other hand, only
1% of North America’s addresses are turtles (of which more
than half come from a single ASN: AS22394).
ASes most prone to RTTs greater than 100 seconds
Next, we investigate the Autonomous Systems of addresses
with RTTs greater than 100 seconds in the three Zmap
scans: we refer to these addresses as sleepy-turtles. We con-
sider whether these addresses are diﬀerent from turtles to
identify whether there is a diﬀerent underlying cause. Fol-
lowing the same process in identifying ASes and sorting them
as in Table 4, Table 6 shows Autonomous Systems that are
most prone to RTTs greater than 100 seconds.
We ﬁnd that sleepy-turtles exhibit similarities to turtles.
Every Autonomous System in Table 6 is cellular. Further,
the ranks of the Autonomous Systems remain stable over
time across the scans. However, there is more variation
across the scans for the percentage of sleepy-turtles among
all probed addresses for an AS. This suggests that the frac-
tion of addresses experiencing RTTs greater than 100 sec-
onds is less stable over time.
6.3 Is it the ﬁrst ping?
RTTs that are consistently greater than a second are suf-
ﬁciently high that interactive application traﬃc would seem
impractical with these delays. We suspected that the la-
tencies measured by ISI and Zmap might not be typical of
