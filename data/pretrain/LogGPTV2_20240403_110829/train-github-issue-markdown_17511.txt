Hello,

When you import TensorFlow, it outputs some informational messages that you find unnecessary. You want to know how to disable these messages without recompiling TensorFlow. Setting the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable does not seem to have any effect on this.

Here is an example of the output you are seeing:

```python
In [1]: import tensorflow as tf
I tensorflow/stream_executor/dso_loader.cc:111] successfully opened CUDA library libcublas.so.7.5 locally
I tensorflow/stream_executor/dso_loader.cc:111] successfully opened CUDA library libcudnn.so.5.1 locally
I tensorflow/stream_executor/dso_loader.cc:111] successfully opened CUDA library libcufft.so.7.5 locally
I tensorflow/stream_executor/dso_loader.cc:111] successfully opened CUDA library libcuda.so.1 locally
I tensorflow/stream_executor/dso_loader.cc:111] successfully opened CUDA library libcurand.so.7.5 locally
```

To suppress these messages, you can set the logging level in TensorFlow. Here is how you can do it:

```python
import os
os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '2'  # or any {'0', '1', '2', '3'}
import tensorflow as tf
```

- `0`: Default, all logs are shown.
- `1`: Filter out INFO logs.
- `2`: Filter out WARNING logs.
- `3`: Filter out all logs.

Setting `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `2` should filter out the informational messages you are seeing.

Thank you.
