ABSTRACT
Wideband technologies in the unlicensed spectrum can satisfy the
ever-increasing demands for wireless bandwidth created by emerging
rich media applications. The key challenge for such systems, however,
is to allow narrowband technologies that share these bands (say,
802.11 a/b/g/n, Zigbee) to achieve their normal performance, without
compromising the throughput or range of the wideband network.
This paper presents SWIFT, the ﬁrst system where high-throughput
wideband nodes are shown in a working deployment to coexist with
unknown narrowband devices, while forming a network of their own.
Prior work avoids narrowband devices by operating below the noise
level and limiting itself to a single contiguous unused band. While
this achieves coexistence, it sacriﬁces the throughput and operating
distance of the wideband device. In contrast, SWIFT creates high-
throughput wireless links by weaving together non-contiguous unused
frequency bands that change as narrowband devices enter or leave
the environment. This design principle of cognitive aggregation
allows SWIFT to achieve coexistence, while operating at normal
power, and thereby obtaining higher throughput and greater operating
range. We implement SWIFT on a wideband hardware platform, and
evaluate it in the presence of 802.11 devices. In comparison to a
baseline that coexists with narrowband devices by operating below
their noise level, SWIFT is equally narrowband-friendly but achieves
3.6 − 10.5× higher throughput and 6× greater range.

Introduction
Users’ desires to share high deﬁnition audio and video around
the home are driving the need for ever-increasing wireless band-
width [1, 9], and wideband radios, whose frequency bandwidth
spans hundreds of MHz to many GHz, have been proposed as a
solution [9, 34, 20]. These radios mainly operate in the unlicensed
spectrum, which is populated by a variety of legacy narrowband
devices (e.g., 802.11a/b/g, Zigbee), as well as a slew of emerging
technologies (e.g., 802.11n). The key problem in operating these
wideband systems is to ensure that they neither hinder the perfor-

mance of narrowband devices in these bands, nor sacriﬁce their own
throughput or operating range. Overcoming this problem requires a
network design that achieves high throughput even when interferers
continuously exist, a fundamental departure from traditional wireless
networks, which are crippled by interference.
This paper presents SWIFT, a Split Wideband Interferer Friendly
Technology that safely coexists with narrowband devices operating
in the same frequencies. SWIFT’s key feature is cognitive aggrega-
tion: the ability to create high-throughput wireless links by weaving
together non-contiguous unused frequency bands that change as nar-
rowband devices enter or leave the environment. Our design is moti-
vated by measurement studies [19, 27] showing that, while various
wireless technologies exist throughout the spectrum, only a few such
technologies are usually operational in a house or small geographic
area,1 and hence a large number of non-contiguous frequency bands
are likely to be unused. SWIFT’s ability to detect and utilize exactly
these unoccupied bands, and compose them to build a single wireless
link, allows wideband networks to operate at normal power without
affecting narrowband, and delivers on the promise of simultaneously
achieving high throughput, operating range, and coexistence.
SWIFT bridges two areas in wireless communications: cognitive
radios, and wideband and ultra-wideband design. While there has
been a lot of interest in cognitive communication, most proposals
have focused on the licensed spectrum [12, 10, 16], where the pri-
mary users of the band are known a priori, and hence this knowledge
may be incorporated into detecting if the band is occupied by the
known signal pattern. In contrast, SWIFT focuses on the unlicensed
band, where narrowband devices are many, and their signal patterns
are unlikely to be known. Further, cognitive proposals attempt to ﬁnd
a single unused band which they may opportunistically use, while
SWIFT aggregates the bandwidth of many such bands to maximize
throughput. Similarly to cognitive radios, Wideband (WB) and Ultra-
wideband (UWB) technologies have to cooperate with existing users
of the spectrum. They have, however, tried to bypass the coexistence
problem by reducing their transmission power below the noise ﬂoor
of narrowband devices [34, 29, 4], and limiting themselves to a single
contiguous band. While this allows narrowband devices to oper-
ate unhindered, it sacriﬁces the WB device’s throughput, operating
distance, or both.
To achieve its goal of high throughput, range, and narrowband-
friendliness, SWIFT has to address three key challenges:
• How does SWIFT detect the frequency bands that it must avoid, to
allow narrowband devices to operate normally? In the absence of
any information about the narrowband signal, traditional solutions
avoid frequency bands that show high narrowband power [10].
This approach uses observed power (or the lack of it) in a band
as a proxy for whether interference in this band is detrimental (or
irrelevant) to operation of the narrowband device, and is known to
have both false positives and false negatives [32]. Instead, SWIFT
has a novel adaptive sensing technique that exploits common net-

work semantics, by observing that many unlicensed devices react
when faced with interference, either at the lower layers [7, 21], or
at higher layers [24]. This observation allows SWIFT to directly
address the key goal of cognition: identifying frequency bands
whose use could interfere with narrowband devices. Thus, SWIFT
probes ambiguous frequencies, monitors the change in narrowband
power proﬁle, and backs away if it perceives narrowband reaction.
• How does the PHY layer operate across chunks of non-contiguous
frequencies? The current PHY layer of high-throughput wire-
less systems assumes a known and contiguous communication
band, and breaks down in the presence of narrowband devices.
For example, even basic primitives like packet detection can be
triggered incorrectly by power from narrowband transmissions.
SWIFT introduces a cognitive PHY that incorporates cross-layer
information from the adaptive sensing subsystem into the basic
signal processing algorithms.
• Given that different nodes might perceive different usable fre-
quencies, how do SWIFT nodes communicate? Varying prox-
imity to narrowband devices between SWIFT transmitter-receiver
pairs may lead to differences in their choice of usable frequency
bands. Since state of the art high-throughput wireless systems (e.g.
OFDM) communicate across a frequency band by striping the data
bits sequentially across sub-frequencies in the band, disagreement
in the set of usable sub-frequencies between a sender-receiver pair
leads to unknown insertions and deletions in the data stream, which
cannot be dealt with by typical error-correcting codes. SWIFT’s
in-band consensus scheme transforms these insertions and dele-
tions into bit errors, which can be dealt with using standard error-
correcting techniques, and hence enables communication despite
uncertainty in the environment.
We have built SWIFT in a custom wideband radio hardware [20].
Our implementation addresses the major details of computational
complexity, storage, and pipelining inherent in building a wideband
wireless transceiver and apparent only at the hardware level. We
evaluate our design in a testbed of wideband nodes and 802.11 nar-
rowband devices. Our results reveal the following ﬁndings.
• SWIFT safely coexists with narrowband devices while simultane-
ously providing high throughput and good range. In comparison to
a baseline system that coexists with narrowband devices by operat-
ing below their noise level, SWIFT is as narrowband-friendly, but
its throughput is 3.6 − 10.5× higher, and its range is 6× greater.
• Adaptive sensing is effective. As compared to a threshold based
approach, which is neither efﬁcient for wideband nor safe for nar-
rowband across all locations, adaptive sensing accurately identiﬁes
interfered frequency bands, and provides efﬁciency while still
being safe for narrowband.
• SWIFT nodes can communicate despite disagreement over narrow-
band spectrum usage and tolerate up to 40% disagreement about
the usable frequency bands.
To the best of our knowledge, SWIFT is the ﬁrst system where
wideband nodes are shown in a working deployment to coexist safely
with unknown narrowband devices, while forming a network of their
own.
2 Related Work
SWIFT brings together research in two threads of wireless communi-
cations: wideband systems, and cognitive radios.
(a) Wideband Systems. The last couple of years have seen
tremendous successes in the implementation of WB and UWB ra-
dios [18, 20, 9, 34]. This work falls in two major categories: low
power consumption, low-rate radios for precision location and track-
ing systems, and high throughput radios for personal area networks
and wire replacement in homes and ofﬁces [9, 1].
An intrinsic problem for high-throughput wideband radios, how-
ever, is coexistence with narrowband devices with which they share
the unlicensed bands. Prior work tries to avoid interfering with nar-
rowband devices by transmitting below their noise level [34, 29].
This approach inherently limits the throughput and operating range
of the WB radio [34]. Further, in many cases, it fails to achieve its
goal of protecting narrowband devices [29, 4]. Mishra et al. [28]
propose to detect and avoid WiMax operating in the same band as
an ultra-wideband device. Their work however is speciﬁc to WiMax,
and can deal neither with general narrowband devices nor with a
dynamic environment. Also, their implementation considers only a
wideband sender and does not include a wideband receiver.
While most prior work is focused on a single link and the PHY
layer, SWIFT’s components span multiple areas, including signal
processing, coding, and network protocols, which together success-
fully address the issue of coexistence with dynamic and unknown
narrowband devices.
(b) Cognitive Radios. The realization of the congested spectrum
allocation and its inefﬁcient utilization [19, 27] has led to a surge of
interest in cognitive communications. Work here has largely focused
on detecting unused bands (spectrum sensing) and providing methods
for sharing these bands among cognitive radios (spectrum sharing).
Prior work on spectrum sensing focuses on the licensed band,
where it is crucial that cognitive secondary users do not interfere
with the licensed primary user. The most basic approach involves
measuring the energy level in a band. Energy detection is cheap, fast,
and requires no knowledge of the characteristics of the signal. How-
ever, choosing energy thresholds is not robust across a wide range of
SNRs [10]. Though more sophisticated mechanisms such as matched
ﬁlter detection [10] are more accurate, they require knowledge of
the transmitted signal (modulation, packet format, pilots, bandwidth,
etc.) and thus work only for known technologies.
Architectures for spectrum sharing fall in two categories: central-
ized and distributed [10]. Centralized approaches [3, 15, 14] require
a controller, such as a base station or spectrum broker, to allocate
spectrum to all cognitive users. Distributed approaches [35, 36, 12,
16, 25] have MAC protocols that rely on one or more control channels
to coordinate spectrum access.
While our work builds on these prior foundations, it makes three
major departures. First, cognitive radios focus on ﬁnding a single
contiguous unoccupied band, whereas SWIFT weaves together mul-
tiple non-contiguous unoccupied bands to create a high-throughput
wideband link. Second, SWIFT introduces new spectrum sensing
mechanisms that exploit network semantics to strengthen traditional
energy based techniques for unknown signals. Third, SWIFT allows
communicating nodes to agree on usable frequencies using a fully
distributed consensus scheme that requires no control channels.
3 Problem Domain
SWIFT is designed to provide high throughput wireless connectiv-
ity for rich media appliances in a home scenario. It operates in the
unlicensed spectrum, and is intended to function in the presence of
narrowband devices that utilize the same part of the spectrum, and
which might persist for long periods, or arrive and depart within min-
utes or hours, e.g., a laptop utilizing an 802.11 wireless connection.
SWIFT is a cognitive architecture for OFDM wideband radios.
We focus on Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)
because it has emerged as the technique of choice for the majority of

wireless technologies, such as wideband digital communication [20],
ultra-wideband [5], 802.11 a/g/n [7, 8] and WiMAX [11]. The rest of
our description focuses on single antenna radios, but our ideas are also
applicable to wideband MIMO radios, as they too use OFDM [13].
Robust detection of narrowband devices without any knowledge of
their signal patterns or other characteristics is impossible [32]. Since
it is impractical to assume known signal patterns in the unlicensed
band, SWIFT focuses its design on the practical scenarios that could
arise in the environment of interest. Speciﬁcally, SWIFT addresses
situations in which the following constraints apply:
1. It is acceptable to treat narrowband trafﬁc as best effort. Speciﬁ-
cally, narrowband devices should continue to experience the same
average throughput and loss rate in the presence of wideband nodes
as without them, but their requirements are not any more stringent
than what is expected from today’s wireless LANs.
2. The capacity of the wideband network exceeds its peak trafﬁc.
This implies that the medium exhibits frequent idle intervals such
that narrowband devices that perform carrier sense are not com-
pletely locked out. Sufﬁcient capacity can arguably be obtained by
increasing the spectrum width spanned by the wideband radio.
3. Narrowband technologies of interest in this paper react to interfer-
ence. This reaction can be at lower layers, for example, carrier-
sense abstaining from using the medium, or autorate changing
modulation schemes, or at the higher layer, for example, TCP
backing off on sustained packet loss. Further, these devices are
expected to operate at reasonable SNRs (a few dB above the noise
ﬂoor, e.g. 802.11a/b/g/n). Narrowband devices that operate below
or around the noise ﬂoor are expected to have their own mecha-
nisms to combat interference, as they need them in such a regime.

5 SWIFT
SWIFT is designed around the concept of cognitive aggregation. Sim-
ilar to the cognitive radio vision, cognitive aggregation is based on
detecting narrowband systems and avoiding their frequency bands.
Unlike prior cognitive systems, which use only a single contiguous
band, cognitive aggregation merges many non-contiguous bands into
a single high-throughput communication channel, as shown in Fig. 2.
Such a design is critical when using a wide band in the unlicensed
spectrum since a wide contiguous unused band typically does not
exist. SWIFT implements a cognitive aggregation design by utiliz-
ing three key components: (a) a spectrum sensing mechanism based
on determining how SWIFT’s selection of frequency bands impacts
narrowband transmissions, rather than just how the narrowband trans-
missions look to SWIFT, (b) a cognitive PHY layer that can operate
over non-contiguous spectrum bands, and (c) a consensus protocol
that allows SWIFT nodes to agree on usable frequency bands despite
uncertainty about which bands are occupied by narrowband devices.
Below, we explain each of these components in detail.
4 OFDM Background
5.1 Adaptive Spectrum Sensing
This section provides a simpliﬁed description of OFDM focused only
on issues related to this paper. OFDM divides the used RF bandwidth
into many narrow sub-channels, called OFDM bins. Each OFDM bin
can be treated independently from other bins, and may use a different
modulation (e.g., BPSK, 4-QAM) or transmission power. A data
stream is striped into bits, with different numbers of bits assigned
to each bin based on its modulation scheme. An assignment of
modulated bits to each of the OFDM bins is called an OFDM symbol,
see Fig. 1. The frequency representation of the OFDM symbol is
converted to a time domain OFDM symbol by using an Inverse Fast
Fourier Transform (IFFT) and sent on the medium by the transmitter.
The receiver ﬁrst determines the exact sample at which the packet
starts. It then aligns the time samples on OFDM symbol bound-
aries, and performs a few basic signal processing tasks like Carrier
Frequency Offset (CFO) and channel estimation. Next, the aligned
time signal is passed to a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) module to
produce the frequency representation. The data symbols are then
converted to their frequency representation, corrected for the channel,
and demodulated to retrieve the transmitted data bits.
SWIFT senders must learn the set of OFDM bins in which they can
send while being narrowband-friendly.
5.1.1 How do we detect bins that interfere with narrowband?
Ideally, SWIFT could directly measure how its choice of transmit
bins affects a narrowband device. Since this is typically not possible,
and given that one does not know the signal details for arbitrary unli-
censed narrowband devices, prior cognitive devices passively listen
for narrowband devices, and avoid all frequency bins in which they
see power above some threshold [10]. This approach essentially uses
information about how SWIFT observes the narrowband transmis-
sions to guess how a SWIFT transmission would be observed by the
narrowband device. Such an approach is problematic for two reasons.
First, it is difﬁcult to pick a power threshold [32] to precisely iden-
tify occupied bins, because the correct value varies with time and
proximity to the narrowband device. Fig. 3 illustrates this issue. It
shows the power proﬁle of an 802.11a narrowband device operating
on channel 52, as observed by two SWIFT nodes at different dis-

tances from the 802.11a transmitter. In this scenario, the narrowband
device uses bins 3 through 23. Clearly, no single ﬁxed threshold
would eliminate exactly the correct set of bins used by the narrow-
band device at both locations. This problem becomes even worse
in the presence of variable power levels among narrowband devices.
