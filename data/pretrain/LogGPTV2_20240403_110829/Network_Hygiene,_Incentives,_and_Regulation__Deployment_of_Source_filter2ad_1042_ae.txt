remediated for at least six months.
It is clear that market forces alone will not remedy the harm that
networks without SAV pose to the Internet, and to commerce that
relies on it. Many efforts over the years have tried and failed to
overcome the fundamental underlying problem – misaligned incen-
tives – which hinder deployment of these technical solutions in a
competitive and largely unregulated industry.
An economist would call failure to deploy SAV a negative exter-
nality: networks that allow spoofing save on their own operational
costs, while imposing costs on others (in the form of attacks). An
economic perspective argues that the only long-term remedy is
to internalize this externality on the ISPs. “Naming and shaming”
is a weak form of internalization. Stronger forms include liability
for damages, and various types of regulation. We consider several
potential future scenarios.
8.1 Impact of exogenous interventions
Section 7 concluded that our project’s approach of “naming and
shaming” those who do not implement SAV had some positive
impact but appears to be insufficient, based on subsequent mea-
surements (or lack thereof) of the same networks from the Spoofer
platform. But a valuable benefit of the platform is its enabling ob-
jective evaluation of the effectiveness of attempted interventions
targeting remediation. We offer two examples. As of August 2019,
the Internet Society had 205 distinct organizations (some with mul-
tiple ASes) participating in MANRS (§2), 159 (77.6%) asserting their
commitment to SAV on the MANRS website. As part of the onboard-
ing process, MANRS requests that the ISP send a URL showing the
outcome of running Spoofer from a network without a NAT in
place. For the year ending August 2019 we had IPv4 tests from 99
MANRS ASes with no NAT – likely the MANRS ISP member testing
their own network, with only 11 (11.1%) able to spoof. We also had
IPv4 tests from 108 MANRS ASes where a NAT was involved (more
likely a representative test from a visitor to a MANRS network)
and the fraction of these ASes that could spoof (25.0%) was approxi-
mately the same as the general population (22.0%, figure 4). In short,
our data shows no evidence that those who assert a commitment to
deploy SAV are any more likely to properly deploy it than others.
Our second example is a study of the effect of the U.S. National
Science Foundation (NSF) including BCP 38 language in Campus
Cyberinfrastructure (CC*) solicitations [44]. From 2014-2016, these

institutions to address BCP 38 in their proposals: “..the Campus CI
plan should address efforts to prevent IP spoofing by potential adoption
of BCP 38” and encouraged proposers to use the Spoofer system
to test the current state of their network. To estimate the impact
of this solicitation language, we examined tests belonging to ASes
of institutions that were awarded funding from this program, and
compared them to a control population of institutions who were
awarded funding in political science and not in CC*. We looked
for tests from an AS: i) between May 2016 and August 2019; ii) in
the three-month window between the solicitation posting and the
response due date (“window”); iii) anytime prior to the solicitation
posting (“before”). We found that few of the institutions who re-
ceived CC* funding ran the test as requested during the window of
solicitation response. There were 10 awards in 2014, and 12 awards
in 2016. For both the 2014 and 2016 solicitations, only two awardees
in each year ran the test in the window, though 7 and 8, respec-
tively, had run the test at some time before the solicitation. Of the
22 awardees, 3 showed evidence that they had not deployed SAV as
of August 2019. In the control population, 2 of 10 awardees ran the
test during the CC* solicitation window, 5 before, and none showed
evidence of spoofing. We conclude that tying SAV deployment to
NSF funding did not have an observable impact.
8.2 Liability, insurance, and industry standards
If network operators faced costs by assuming liability associated
with attacks originating from or transiting their networks, they
would have clear incentives to minimize such attacks, including
by deploying technologies like SAV. Even the threat of litigation
or regulation could be enough to change incentives in favor of
substantially increasing SAV deployment, and might motivate in-
surance companies to require policy holders to provide evidence of
consistent SAV deployment. As the insurance industry underwrites
an increasing amount of Internet security risk, it might consider
demanding SAV deployment as a way of lowering overall exposure.
Inbound SAV deployment is already mandated by the widely de-
ployed Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
[9], though §4 shows inbound SAV deployment is problematic.
Unfortunately, there are at least two stubborn barriers. The first
barrier to internalizing these costs via liability for attacks is the
general difficulty of attributing attacks reliably, as well as the re-
quirement to prove economic harm. If it were feasible to attribute
spoofed DoS attacks to a specific party, the associated reputational
harm would already present a strong incentive to deploy SAV. A sec-
ond barrier is the general presumption (enshrined in U.S. law) that
networks are intermediaries who are not considered responsible
for activity that merely transits their systems.
8.3 Regulating transparency
Requirements for disclosure around network management practices
could serve as a stronger “name and shame” regime around SAV
deployment. Such rules were part of the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) Open Internet Orders [56] and recently updated
transparency requirements [57]. These requirements may already
require the disclosure of SAV deployment or non-deployment, as
they cover security mechanisms and device attachment rules. The
problem is likely not disclosure, but a failure of enforcement and
compliance. Our tool could be an excellent arbiter of compliance
with this rule, demonstrating publicly whether the network allows
spoofing. This data can be useful to insurers, regulators, and to
consumers wishing to understand network hygiene.
8.4 Regulating government procurement
If the U.S. Government wanted to take a leading role in increasing
the ability of all networks to attribute attacks, thereby improving
global cybersecurity, it could require SAV of all agency networks
and require Government-contracted ISPs to support SAV as well.
A similar effort successfully mandated the availability of all gov-
ernment websites over HTTPS with modern settings under Office
of Management and Budget (OMB) Memo M-15-13 [48]. The U.S.
National Institutes of Science and Technology has recently included
SAV in draft security guidance documents that will represent re-
quirements for all U.S. government agencies [43, 50]. Sometimes
NIST takes these guidance documents and embodies them in Fed-
eral Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) controls, e.g.,
for Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC) [59] or in other policy
initiatives [60]. All such requirements are only partially effective,
but they often serve as important catalysts to broader adoption.
There are several further approaches the U.S. government has
still not tried: including SAV as a requirement in government-
procured networking services; the Department of Homeland Se-
curity Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agenda (CISA)
issuing a Binding Operational Directive (BOD); or the OMB issu-
ing a specific policy. We heard one anecdote about SAV being a
requirement for Federal Risk and Authorization Management Pro-
gram (FEDRAMP) technology acquisition guidelines for U.S. federal
agencies, where SAV was a requirement right up until the end of
the process. When the government asked for input from industry,
cloud providers wanted the requirement removed because it was
“too hard to implement.” This is a disturbing anecdote, since many
cloud providers also sell DDoS mitigation services, so there is at
least the appearance of conflict of interest in this dynamic.
This episode is reminiscent of the U.S. Anti-Bot Code (ABC) of
Conduct for ISPs issued in 2012 [55]. The FCC’s Communications
Security, Reliability, and Interoperability Council (CSRIC) convened
a multistakeholder group to create a set of voluntary guidelines on
botnet prevention and mitigation. When it was completed, the FCC
asked ISPs to publicly acknowledge whether they would comply
with the guidelines; the ISPs refused. This made it impossible to
assess the effectiveness of the guidelines.
Two related developments challenge the prospect of increasing
the strength of ISP guidelines. First, some assert that the tremen-
dous consolidation in the Internet markets over the last twenty
years has dampened the urgency of solving the SAV problem, since
many companies outsource their content distribution to other plat-
forms, e.g., one of the giant content distribution cloud platforms,
many of whom have resources in place to mitigate the impact of
DoS attacks by absorbing, dispersing, or blackholing attack traffic
in real time [25]. Indeed, many of these cloud platforms leverage
their infrastructure to sell DDoS mitigation services, so DDoS at-
tacks represent a revenue opportunity for them. A counterpoint
is that attacks are growing in volume so much that only the most
heavily capitalized providers can handle them. In October 2016,
Akamai had to abandon its pro bono DDoS mitigation support for
cybersecurity journalist Brian Krebs because it could not longer
afford to subsidize this service. Google’s Project Shield took over
Krebs’ web site instead [7]. The tremendous consolidation in inter-
connection may also make it easier for well-resourced networks to
trace back the source of spoofed traffic as there are fewer hops to
reverse engineer [10].
Second, many people tend to look at security as the responsi-
bility of hardware and software manufacturers. In the case of the
Mirai botnet [2], the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) sued the
device manufacturer (D-Link) for failing to adequately secure the
company’s home networking hardware [58]. We also note that a
judge subsequently dismissed the lawsuit for failing to show suffi-
cient harm by D-Link devices on consumers [54]. This does inspire
the question: if a victim of a spoofed DoS attack could establish
clear economic harm, and attribute it to a class of devices that
did not configure SAV by default, could the equipment vendor be
considered responsible for the harm?
8.5 Sticky defaults: vendor SAV responsibility
Research has found that default settings have strong impact on
human behavior, even for high-stakes situations where people are
well informed of their choices [23]. An important open question is
why, when the benefits of deploying SAV universally are clear and
the costs are low and falling, SAV is not universally deployed. Other
choices of default settings in networking equipment could radically
shift this equilibrium – for example, if instead of providing packets
to filter out in network ACLs, operators had to select which packets
to forward, they would likely make different choices and would in
particular be unlikely to allow spoofed-source packets. The space
of interface design for networking equipment and its impact on
security is very much underexplored.
Further confirming the benefit of SAV by default is our conver-
sations with users of the platform over the last three years, where
operators think they have deployed SAV, but have not verified from
all parts of their network, and since SAV is not generally a default
configuration on networking equipment, pockets of spoofability
can appear with any network equipment upgrade. Similarly, we
have noticed many temporary conference wireless networks that
support technical meetings within the Internet industry, whose
operator has neglected to enable SAV when building the temporary
network. While the operator often deploys SAV during the meeting
after private notification, the process repeats several months later.
A related issue is network transit providers who hesitate to de-
ploy filtering, such as with unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF)
[4], because of the possibility the filtered customer network could
be multihomed to another provider, now or in the future. A router
that has deployed uRPF will discard a packet if the interface the
packet arrived on is not the best (strict-mode) or a possible reverse
path (feasible-mode) interface the router would choose to route
packets to that destination. If a multihomed stub AS announces
non-overlapping portions of their address space to different transit
providers for traffic engineering, the provider network may find it
difficult to deploy uRPF. That is, the feasible return path might not
be via the interface a router received a packet from. The IETF has
Figure 19: Feasibility of uRPF over time based on observed
BGP announcements across 21 years. As of August 2019,
84.3% of ASes in the Internet are Stub ASes, and 45.3% of
these stub ASes in the Internet had a single inferred transit
provider (38.2% of all ASes) and were candidates for feasible-
mode uRPF. (Transit relationships inferred from BGP data
from RouteViews and RIPE RIS using [35].)
recently proposed improvements to filtering techniques to increase
their operational robustness in the face of such complexity [51].
However, we note two compelling empirical facts. First, a stub
AS that is not multihomed to more than one transit provider is
a candidate for at least feasible uRPF, as the transit provider will
receive routes for all prefixes the stub AS uses even if the customer
has multiple physical connections to their provider, or the stub AS
will risk not having global connectivity in the event one connection
fails. This single-homed stub AS scenario is more common than it
used to be, and on the rise. Figure 19 shows that beginning 2005,
as the Internet grew in terms of distinct routing policies (ASes),
the trend was for stub ASes to choose a single transit provider.
Transit provider ASes can deploy feasible-mode uRPF on these stub
ASes without impacting packet forwarding, provided their stub AS
customer properly announces prefixes covering all of their address
space across each BGP session with their transit provider.
Second, more complex networks also tend to be more capitalized,
and our project demonstrates (and publishes) that some of the most
largest and complex networks, e.g., Comcast and AT&T, have suc-
cessfully implemented SAV throughout their networks. Part of the
problem, and an argument for making SAV the default, is the lack of
resources (both knowledge and time) required to accurately main-
tain SAV filtering, confirmed in a 2017 survey of 84 operators [30].
We were gratified to hear that our platform is useful to network
operators who wish to verify their own SAV compliance, including
after network upgrades that created pockets of spoofability that
operators did not expect. If the U.S. government mandated SAV-by-
default on its networking equipment vendors, it might lead to SAV
becoming the default for equipment sold into enterprise networks
as well. In turn, demand for predictability by network technicians
would create pressure on vendors who do not do business with the
U.S. Government to make SAV a default as well.
Our data indicates that there is limited deployment of uRPF on
single-homed BGP customers in the Internet. In figure 4, 25.2% of
IPv4 ASes are at least partially spoofable in the year ending August
2019. For the 438 ASes where feasible-mode uRPF could be deployed
that are in our data in the year ending August 2019, 21.5% of IPv4
ASes are at least partially spoofable.

The Internet ecosystem, with its academic roots and radically dis-
tributed ownership, has long defied traditional governance solu-
tions. For some vulnerabilities, there will be no simple policy so-
lutions. For such vulnerabilities, measurement plays a critical role
in quantifying the current attack surface, and assessing the effec-
tiveness of proposed interventions. Unlike many other network
security hygiene properties, there is no way to audit a network
from outside to confirm that it performs SAV. The most valuable
contribution of our work has been the establishment of this capa-
bility – to prove to an independent third-party auditor that one
has properly deployed SAV from a given network. Any regulatory,
