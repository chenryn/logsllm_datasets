User: I was looking through the Python standards libs and saw BDB the debugger framework. What is it for and can I get additional value from it?
At the moment I use Eclipse/PyDev with the internal debugger which also supports conditionals breakpoints. Can I get something new from BDB?
Assistant: The bdb module implements the basic debugger facilities for pdb.Pdb, which is the concrete debugger class that is used to debug Python scripts from a terminal.
Unless you're planning to write your own debugger user interface, you shouldn't need to use anything from bdb.
