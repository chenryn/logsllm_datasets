# Environment
Windows pro 1903  
4k with 225% for screen  
PowerToys version: v0.16.1
# Steps to reproduce
Just drag and drop windows with 'shift'
# Expected behavior
Fully using whole screen,  
Better assign 'win + shift + arrow' to fancyzones and leave 'win + arrow' as
system default.  
It would be better if and adjust by drag the border of both zones as window
system default for temporary.
# Actual behavior
There is space not usable on the right of screen.  
Seems ok now with v0.16.1 after reboots (not sure is it because of reboots?) üëç
