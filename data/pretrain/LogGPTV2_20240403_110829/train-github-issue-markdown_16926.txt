### Bug Report for TypeScript

**Summary:**
I am reporting a potential bug in TypeScript, which I have encountered while working on the "AddVS15" branch of the [Klib6 repository](https://github.com/kevinpas/Klib6).

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. **Navigate to the Repository:**
   - Clone or access the repository at: [Klib6](https://github.com/kevinpas/Klib6).
   - Switch to the "AddVS15" branch.

2. **Locate the Startup File:**
   - Open the file `Klib6/Tests/Core/CoreTests.ts`.

3. **Initial Setup:**
   - In `CoreTests.ts`, there are two import statements.
   - Comment out the second import statement and run the tests. You should be able to successfully run and debug the tests.

4. **Reproduce the Issue:**
   - Uncomment the second import statement.
   - Additionally, uncomment the following lines near the bottom of the file:
     ```typescript
     // var units = "mm";
     // var nameValueUnits = new NameValueUnits(name, value, units);
     ```

5. **Run the Code:**
   - Attempt to run the code again. You will encounter an exception.

**Exception Details:**

- **Operating System:** Windows 7
- **Error Message:**
  ```
  Debugger listening on port 5858
  module.js:338
    throw err;
    ^

  Error: Cannot find module 'NameValue'
      at Function.Module._resolveFilename (module.js:336:15)
      at Function.Module._load (module.js:278:25)
      at Module.require (module.js:365:17)
      at require (module.js:384:17)
      at Object.<anonymous> (C:\ ... \Git\GitHub\Klib6\Source\Core\NameValueUnits.js:46:19)

      at Function.Module._load (module.js:310:12)
      at Module.require (module.js:365:17)
  Press any key to continue...
  ```

**Expected Behavior:**
The code should run without errors, allowing me to debug and step through the tests even with the second import and the additional lines uncommented.

**Actual Behavior:**
An error is thrown, indicating that the module 'NameValue' cannot be found.

**Additional Notes:**
- This issue only occurs when the second import and the specific lines are uncommented.
- The error does not occur if the second import is commented out.
