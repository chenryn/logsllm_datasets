seconds to reduce the state that the NIC must maintain. We desire
for an attacker to have to send 100 Mbits/s of trafﬁc for ≥ 5 minutes
(about seven million packets) to cause a 5 minute interruption. We
therefore use as Bloom ﬁlter parameters:
n elements = 1,500,000
m bits in table = 64× 220 (8MBytes)
k hash functions = 12
The probability of a false positive is 2.9× 10−8, or about 1 in 35
million. The 12 hash functions can be computed as 26-bit sections
of a hash computation such as SHA-384. Note that this false positive
rate is quite conservative: the probability is much lower if the source
has been (as would be typical) transmitting at less than 50,000
packets per second.
Because this mechanism is designed to defend against high-
volume ﬂoods, the NIC can simply clear the Bloom ﬁlter every
30 seconds. If a victim is unlucky and responds to a packet sent just
before the ﬁlter is cleared, it can try again a few seconds later.
3.3 Securing BGP
AIP greatly simpliﬁes the task of deploying mechanisms similar to
S-BGP [19] to secure the routing system against hijacking and route
forgery.
This task is difﬁcult today because IP lacks a ﬁrm binding between
public keys, autonomous systems, and the preﬁxes announced in
routing messages. As a result, securing BGP requires external trusted
registries that bind, e.g., an owner’s public key to a preﬁx or to an
AS number. In part due to the difﬁculty of creating, maintaining, and
trusting these registries, the deployment of secure routing protocols
has languished despite considerable attention in both the research
and operational communities.
AIP eliminates the need for these databases: In AIP, the network
an AD (or AS) announces is the AD itself, which eliminates the need
for key-to-AS registries. Only a router or network in possession of
the private key corresponding to AD can generate authentic routing
messages. As a result, secure routing follows naturally from AIP,
using mechanisms nearly identical to S-BGP:
1. Operators conﬁgure a BGP peering session. By identifying the
peer AD, the session is automatically aware of the public keys
that should be used to verify announcements from the peer and
to negotiate an encrypted communication session with the peer.
2. BGP routers sign their routing announcements. A router re-
ceiving a routing update veriﬁes the signature before applying
the changes or forwarding the announcement. We discuss the
resource requirements of the resulting load in Section 4.2.2.
3. Each router must be able to ﬁnd the public key that corre-
sponds to an AD. These keys could be transmitted in-line with
BGP messages, or could be sent as an out-of-band, slowly
changing database, as in S-BGP. As discussed in Section 5,
this distribution is quite simple: because ADs are the hash
of the corresponding public key, the bindings are completely
self-certifying.
4 Routing Scalability with AIP
In this section, we examine the question of whether the combination
of AIP and the continued growth of the Internet will cause some
aspect of Internet routing, such as the forwarding and routing infor-
mation base (FIB and RIB) sizes, update rate, etc., to exceed the
capabilities of future hardware to support in a cost-effective manner.
We ﬁnd through our analysis—using even conservative estimates
for future hardware capabilities—that neither the continued growth
of the Internet nor the introduction of AIP should impose an undue
scaling burden. ISPs may still ﬁnd the effects of routing growth
undesirable, because they could be forced to upgrade routers, but
our analysis is strictly one of the possible: we argue that future
routers will be able to support the larger routing table sizes without
an increase in price relative to today’s routers.
Resources affected by routing growth: We begin by more pre-
cisely deﬁning what we mean by “routing growth” and the physical
resources that would be affected by such growth:
Growth of
Routing table size
FIB size
Update processing
Resource affected
DRAM
DRAM/SRAM/CAM
CPU
To understand the effect of growth upon these resources, we
ﬁrst examine current Internet growth curves and survey several
predictions for future routing table sizes and update rates. We then
estimate the effects of moving to AIP-style routing. Using the
estimates for routing table size, FIB size, and update rate, we then
explore whether semiconductor technology trends will be able to
meet these demands at constant cost.4
4In this analysis, we count “backbone” BGP announcements. Many providers have
signiﬁcantly more preﬁxes de-aggregated internally or from layer-3 virtual private
networks (VPNs). Our focus here is on the change in the relative numbers of preﬁxes
more than on the absolute number. An assumption in this analysis, therefore, is that the
internal preﬁxes will scale at the same rate as the external preﬁxes.

4.1 Routing Growth Estimates
Diameter of the Internet / AS path length: According to
Leskovec et al. [23], the AS-diameter of the Internet has been shrink-
ing. From November 1997 to January 2000, the average out-degree
of an AS increased from roughly 3.6 to 4.1, and the AS diameter
decreased slightly from nearly 4.8 to 4.6 AS hops. Our analysis
points to a slightly different conclusion: the average AS path length
received at Routeviews in December 2007 was 4.52 entries (2.3
billion announcements) while in December 2001 it was 4.30 (387
million announcements). Both results support the conclusion that, if
current trends continue, the increase in the AS-diameter in the future
is likely to be small.
Routing table size: Our best estimate for routing table growth is
that for the last ten years, the table size has been growing at roughly
17% per year. Figure 5 shows the table growth with both linear
and exponential regression lines.5 The exponential ﬁt is size =
2.07· 104 · e4.253·10−4·day with day 0 being June 30, 2008. The 17%
growth prediction is compatible with predictions from Fuller et
al. [12]; if past and current trends continue, the routing table is likely
to have about 1.6 million entries by 2020 (Table 1).
Churn: The amount of routing trafﬁc appears to grow roughly lin-
early with the routing table size, but the picture is less clear than
the simple table scaling. Figure 6 shows the number of preﬁxes
announced and withdrawn per week by the AT&T RouteViews peer.
During 2002, the average daily volume was 122,966 updates per day.
During 2007, the number was 304,996, an increase of 248%. The
routing table grew from 107,424 preﬁxes (1.145 updates/preﬁx/day)
to 247,167 preﬁxes (1.234 updates/preﬁx/day) during the same pe-

riod, an increase of 230%.6 The change in churn appears to be
affected by more factors than simply growth, as the rapid increase
and subsequent correction in 2005–2006 indicate. In the absence
of more information, we assume that per-preﬁx churn will remain
relatively stable or increase slightly in the coming years, using 1.5
updates per preﬁx per day as a conservative estimate.
Our resulting predictions (Table 2) are smaller than the
Fuller/Huston predictions; we believe this difference arises for two
reasons. First, one set of Huston’s measurements focused mostly on
2005, which appears in retrospect to have shown anomalously large
growth in routing volume (in fact, volume decreased markedly in the
following year). Second, the measurements may differ by a constant
factor simply because of the different vantage points—as Table 2
shows, the 2006-2007 measurements themselves differ by a factor of
two. Fuller’s caveat that these numbers represent a “cloudy crystal
ball” (low-conﬁdence projections) holds for our churn analysis as
well.
The overall rate of updates with these predictions is small (1.6M
daily updates is only 28 updates/sec on average). The more impor-
tant update rate is therefore during full table updates. When a
BGP session resets, by 2020, the routers will have to exchange ≥ 1.6
million preﬁxes with each peer, ideally in a few seconds.
4.2 Effects of Moving to AIP
AIP will have several effects on routing, both positive and negative.
RIB and FIB size increase: The move to AIP will increase the
size of the RIB and FIB in two ways. First, the size of preﬁxes
and ASes will increase from their current 32 and 16 bits to 160
bits. Second, just as the move to S-BGP would require, a router
will need to store a copy of each AD’s public key. For domains that
use a two-level key hierarchy (Section 5), this requirement will be

doubled. While the number of RIB entries is proportional to the
number of peers, each AD’s full key must only be stored once. For
this discussion, we assume 2048-bit RSA public keys.
An important change with AIP is that FIB lookups become ﬂat.
The effects of this change are somewhat difﬁcult to measure, and
so we deliberately leave this improvement out of our calculations
to ensure a worst-case estimate for AIP. In practice, we expect
ﬂat lookups to require roughly 5× fewer memory accesses than
preﬁx-based lookups would using modern DRAM-based lookup
algorithms [40].
CPU costs for cryptographic operations: The cryptographic
costs of AIP are very similar to those for adopting S-BGP. Routers
must verify signatures on incoming routing announcements and sign
their own announcements.
Diameter changes: The move to AIP may result in some large
domains being split into multiple ADs. We envision, for instance,
that a large ISP might split itself into a transit AD and a number of
ADs from which it allocates direct customers. As a consequence, the
move to AIP might increase the diameter of the network, perhaps by
two or three AD-hops. This discussion is, of course, highly specu-
lative, as it depends on the reaction of the operational community
to AIP. As a result, we present scaling numbers with the diameter
unchanged and with it increased.
4.2.1 Semiconductor Growth Trends
The International Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) is the semi-
conductor industry’s joint technology roadmap for semiconductor
technology development through 2020 [1]. Its predictions are an
engineering extension of Moore’s Law, for the last 20 years brought
to fruition by the resultant industry efforts to meet those predictions.
Whether they will continue to hold through 2020 is uncertain, but
past experience suggests that the roadmap is surprisingly accurate.
A noteworthy feature of the 2005 and 2006 ITRS updates is that
they reduce their doubling predictions from 1.5 years (historical) to
3 years.
In general, the roadmap predicts a continuation of the aggressive
growth observed thus far (Table 3). Both DRAM density and CPU
performance are expected to improve dramatically. While SRAM
access speeds will similarly increase, conventional DRAM access
and write times are expected to improve only modestly, unless a shift
to faster memory technologies such as MRAM occurs.
4.2.2 Resource Requirements
RIB storage (DRAM): The RIB must hold one copy of the routing
table from each peer, and requires that the DRAM be able to sustain
enough throughput to load this data from peers at high speeds.
