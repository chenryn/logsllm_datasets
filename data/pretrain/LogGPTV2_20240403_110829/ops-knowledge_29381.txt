I am attempting to add Tesseract to my system so that I can install `pytesseract`. I am using Windows 7.

I have added the following path to my `PATH` environment variable:
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe
```

However, when I run the following commands from the command line:
```sh
tesseract DMTX_screenshot.png out
```
or simply:
```sh
tesseract
```
I receive the error message:
```
'tesseract' is not recognized as an internal or external command.
```

Here is a portion of my `PATH` environment variable:
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe;C:\Users\Moondra\Anaconda_related\Anaconda\geckodriver.exe;
```

Do you have any ideas about what might be going wrong?

Thank you.

**Assistant:**

It looks like the issue may be with the way the `PATH` environment variable is set. When adding a directory to the `PATH`, you should include the directory containing the executable, not the executable itself. 

Try updating your `PATH` to include the directory:
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Tesseract-OCR
```

After making this change, you may need to restart your command prompt or any other terminal sessions for the changes to take effect.

If you installed Tesseract using `pacman` or `msys2`, you might also need to add the following directory to your `PATH`:
```
C:\msys64\mingw32\bin
```

This should resolve the issue and allow you to use `tesseract` from the command line.
