6.4.4 Fingerprinting using Microphone and Speaker
We now look at ﬁngerprinting smartphones through both mi-
crophones and speakers. For this experiment we build an android
app to collect data from different smartphones. Our app plays and
records different audio clips simultaneously and uploads the data
to a remote server. As we are using an android app for our data
collection, we had to exclude iPhone5 and Sony Ericsson W518
handset from this experiment (reducing our pool of handsets to 5
devices). Again each audio sample is recorded 10 times, half of
which is used for training and the other half for testing. We use the
features obtained from Table 4. Table 7 summarizes our ﬁndings
(values are reported as percentages). We see that we can achieve
an F1-score of 100%. Thus, a malicious app having access to only
speaker and microphone can successfully ﬁngerprint smartphones.
