ABSTRACT
Distance bounding protocols have been proposed for many
security critical applications as a means of getting an upper
bound on the physical distance to a communication part-
ner. As such, distance bounding protocols are executed fre-
quently, e.g., to keep node locations up to date, etc. We
analyze distance bounding protocols in terms of their loca-
tion privacy and we show that they leak information about
the location and distance between communicating partners
even to passive attackers. This location and distance infor-
mation may be highly sensitive since it can form the basis
for access control, key establishment, or be used as input
to location aware applications. We analyze, in a number of
scenarios, how much information distance bounding proto-
cols leak. We further discuss several straightforward coun-
termeasures and show why they do not provide adequate
protection against distance leakage. Finally, we propose a
location private distance bounding protocol that maintains
the properties of existing distance bounding protocols while
leaking no information about the distance measured between
the communicating parties.

RF devices [27, 11], RFID [10, 8, 16], ultrasonic devices [21,
22] and UWB [14, 9]. All the proposed protocols have one
thing in common: they aim to provide an eﬃcient and accu-
rate distance (or distance bound) between two nodes. Re-
gardless of the type of distance bounding protocol, the dis-
tance bound is obtained from a rapid exchange of messages
between two nodes called the prover and the veriﬁer. In this
paper, we analyze this rapid message exchange, common
to all distance bounding protocols, in terms of the infor-
mation that a passive attacker can obtain from overhearing
the communication between two nodes executing a distance
bounding protocol.
In general, most protocols leak some kind of information,
e.g., by executing a protocol two nodes might reveal the fact
that they are present within the attackers radio range. What
makes the information leakage from distance bounding pro-
tocols especially severe is that the information that is leaked
is the same as the nodes participating in the protocol, i.e.,
the prover and veriﬁer, will obtain after the execution of the
protocol. In distance bounding protocols, a passive attacker
is able to deduce not only the distance between the prover
and veriﬁer, with the same accuracy as the nodes executing
the protocol, but also his own position relative to the prover
and veriﬁer.
Distance bounding protocols are often used to allow nodes
to build topology maps of the network or to control access
to speciﬁc resources in the network, e.g., a node can only
access a speciﬁc resource if it is in a speciﬁc location.
In
those application scenarios, the leaking of the distance will
eﬀectively give the attacker the same map of the network as
the legitimate nodes have, or enable him to map out where
any special access zones might be. This can cause a severe
breach of security.
We analyze several straightforward ways of countering the
information leakage from distance bounding protocols and
we point out the weaknesses or strong assumptions appro-
priate for each of those solutions. We also identify eight dif-
ferent scenarios (diﬀerent a priori attacker knowledge) that
aﬀect the amount of information leaked to the attacker. Fi-
nally, we propose a location private distance bounding pro-
tocol (LP-DB) that solves the problems outlined above. Our
protocol also prevents distance leakage to an active attacker,
which starts an (unauthorized) distance bounding session;
we thus extend our attacker model to include active attack-
ers.
We summarize our contributions in the following points:
(i) we present a thorough investigation of the distance and
location information leaked from distance bounding proto-
cols in various scenarios, (ii) we analyze several diﬀerent
straightforward countermeasures and discuss why they do
not provide adequate protection against this information
leakage (iii) we propose a location private distance bounding
protocol that leaks a minimum amount of information.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2
gives a quick introduction to distance bounding protocols.
In Section 3 we analyse what information leaks from the dis-
tance bounding protocol and we build a basic model of the
attackers knowledge. In Section 4 we analyse the possible
ways of countering the leaking, and we expand the model
for the attackers knowledge to take diﬀerent scenarios into
account. In Section 5 we describe our location private dis-
tance bounding protocol (LP-DB). In Section 6 we discuss
related work and we conclude the paper in Section 7.
2. BACKGROUND
Distance bounding denotes a class of protocols in which
one entity (the veriﬁer) measures an upper-bound on its
distance to another (un-trusted) entity (the prover). Dis-
tance bounding protocols were ﬁrst introduced by Brands
and Chaum [4] for the prevention of maﬁa-fraud attacks on
Automatic Teller Machines (ATMs). The purpose of Brands
and Chaum’s distance bounding protocol was to enable the
user’s smart-card (veriﬁer) to check its proximity to the le-
gitimate ATM machine (prover). Figure 1 shows the main
principle of operation of distance bounding protocols.
s − tV
In distance bounding protocols, the veriﬁer challenges the
prover with a b-bit freshly generated nonce N . Upon re-
ception of the challenge, the prover computes an (authen-
ticated) response f P (N ), and sends it to the veriﬁer. The
veriﬁer veriﬁes the authenticity of the reply and measures
the time tV
r between the challenge and the response.
This process is repeated k times to avoid the prover guess-
ing (part of) N and replying before the whole challenge is
received. Based on the measured time, the veriﬁer estimates
the upper-bound on the distance to the prover. The time
tP
s −tP
r between the reception of the challenge and the trans-
mission of the response at the prover is either negligible com-
pared to the propagation time tP
s or is lower bounded
by the prover’s processing and communication capabilities δ,
i.e., tP
r − tV
s − tP
r ≥ δ.
The security of a distance bounding protocol relies on the
following observations. The challenge Ni cannot reach the
prover before it has been sent by the veriﬁer, and its prop-
agation cannot be sped-up if the messages propagate at the
speed of light (e.g., over a radio channel); the message prop-
agation can therefore not be shortened by external attacks
or by untrusted provers. The prover’s responses are pro-
tected from external attacks by their unpredictability, and
from the untrusted prover by the fact that the responses are
functions f P (Ni) of the challenges; i.e., the prover cannot
send back the response before receiving the challenge. Given
this, distance bounding protocols provide to the veriﬁer an
upper-bound on its distance to the prover.
After the execution of a distance bounding protocol the
veriﬁer knows that the prover is within a certain distance,
namely:

INFORMATION LEAKAGE FROM
DISTANCE BOUNDING PROTOCOLS
In this section we analyze the distance information leaked
from distance bounding protocols. The amount of informa-
tion leaked by the execution of a distance bounding protocol
depends on how much the attacker knows about his own po-
sition relative to the prover and veriﬁer before the protocol
starts. In this section we assume that the attacker has no
information about the positions of the prover and veriﬁer,
except that they are in his power range.
In Section 4 we
will then expand the model to include the attacker’s knowl-
edge. Before we start the analysis we describe our system
and attacker models.
3.1 System and Attacker Model
We consider three nodes, the prover P , the veriﬁer V and
the attacker M . The prover and veriﬁer execute a distance
bounding protocol as described in Section 2. We assume
that the veriﬁer is trusted and not compromised and that
both the prover and the veriﬁer do not deliberately give any
information to the attacker.
The nature of the distance bounding protocol implies that
the veriﬁer does not trust the prover (otherwise they could
use an authenticated ranging protocol [30]) but for the pur-
pose of this analysis we assume that the prover is honest and
complies with the distance bounding protocol to the best of
its capabilities. The prover and the veriﬁer are within one
hop communication range and the delay introduced by the
message processing of the prover δp and veriﬁer δv are public
values.
We consider that the attacker can listen to the radio com-
munication of both the prover and the veriﬁer. We do not
require that the attacker holds any keys or any other se-
cret material that form part of the protocol between P and
V , however, the attacker does know the public parameters
of the distance bounding protocol and the type of hardware
used by the nodes and thus the processing time of the provers
and veriﬁers radios.
We do not assume any kind of time synchronization be-
tween the nodes, although we do assume that the nodes can
time-stamp messages with, at least, nanosecond precision;
examples of such hardware can be found in [12], and hard-
ware of more recent implementations of distance bounding
and authenticated ranging protocols in [8, 16, 19].

3.2 Distance leakage
If two nodes, the prover and the veriﬁer, execute a dis-
tance bounding protocol under the assumptions described
in Section 3.1 the distance between the prover and veriﬁer
leaks, even if the attacker remains completely passive, i.e.,
even if he does not participate in, or interfere with, the pro-
tocol execution.
In order to mount the attack the attacker needs to record
the time at which the messages from the rapid message ex-
change phase of the distance bounding protocol arrive at his
radio interface. The attacker must record the arrival time of
three consecutive messages to obtain enough information to
calculate the distance between P and V . The arrival times
Ti of three consecutive messages are illustrated in Figure 2
and can be described by the following three equations:
T0 = t0 + tvm
T1 = t0 + tvp + δp + tpm
