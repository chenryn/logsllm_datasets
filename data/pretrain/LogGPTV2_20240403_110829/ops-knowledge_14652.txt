Question: Considering the mitigations proposed for speculative execution vulnerabilities, what are some valid statements regarding the benefits and drawbacks of the strategies for Variant 1, Variant 2, and Variant 3?
"A": "Variant 1 mitigation involves modifying the code to constrain indices, which may lead to performance overheads due to additional bounds checking.",
"B": "Variant 2 mitigation through the use of retpoline introduces an infinite loop that is never executed, causing a slowdown in all indirect jumps.",
"C": "Variant 3 mitigation using Kernel page table isolation (KPTI) completely eliminates the performance overhead as it uses two separate page tables for user and kernel.",
"D": "Reducing shared resources when processing secret data by using a separate core with its own cache is an easy and straightforward solution to implement."
Answer: AB
