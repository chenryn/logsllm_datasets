The following:
    function resolve({a, b}, c) {
        return resolve();
    }
results in:
    "use strict";
    function f(_x, _x2) {
        var _again = true;
        _function: while (_again) {
            var a = _ref.a;
            var b = _ref.b;
            _again = false;
            var _ref = _x,
                c = _x2;
            a = b = undefined;
            _again = true;
            continue _function;
        }
    }
This obviously breaks, as `_ref` is accessed before being declared.  
It only seems to happen, if the function is named (and recurses by calling
itself by that name) and takes more than one argument.  
The above example is the smallest I could narrow it down to. I realise it
would create an endless loop, but the problem still exists, if you make the
recursing conditional.
I hope this issue is not a duplicate of anything and I did not accidentally
miss another issue.  
Tested with PI:EMAIL, straight from npm.
