Question: Your team is tasked with enhancing the security of an existing software system that handles sensitive user data. During the requirements phase, you identify that encryption is necessary for both storage and transmission of this data. Which of the following actions should be taken to ensure that encryption is properly integrated into the system design? (Select all that apply.)
"A": "Specify which data is considered sensitive and ensure that its transmission or storage is encrypted using well-vetted algorithms.",
"B": "Develop a custom encryption algorithm tailored to your system's specific needs to avoid known vulnerabilities in public algorithms.",
"C": "Use strong, up-to-date cryptographic libraries or frameworks and ensure they are implemented correctly without skipping essential steps.",
"D": "Compartmentalize the system to create 'safe' areas and enforce privilege separation to control access to sensitive data."
Answer: ACD
