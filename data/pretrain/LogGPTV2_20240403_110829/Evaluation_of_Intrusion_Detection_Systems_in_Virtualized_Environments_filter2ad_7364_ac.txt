### Characterization of Benign Hypercall Activities
We estimate the steady-states of benign hypercall activities for the server VMs and calculate relevant statistics (see Section 3.1). The IDS monitoring landscape was initialized, and Xenini was deployed before the characterization. We used `xentrace`, the tracing facility of the Xen hypervisor, to capture hypercall activities in trace files.

**Notes:**
- Only full paravirtualization is supported by `xentrace` for capturing benign hypercall activities.
- Software and hardware requirements for deploying and running SPECvirt sc2013 are available at: [SPECvirt User Guide](https://www.spec.org/virt_sc2013/docs/SPECvirtUserGuide.html).

### Table 1: Benign Workload Characterization
| Server VM | Run 1 (ts, sec.) | Run 1 (r, occ./sec.) | Run 2 (ts, sec.) | Run 2 (r, occ./sec.) |
|-----------|------------------|----------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| Web       | 19644.5          | 5350                 | 19627.3          | 5357                 |
| Network File | 5343           | 10204.9              | 5343             | 10204.9              |
| Mail      | 5391             | 5315                 | 5367             | 5382                 |
| Batch     | 5285             | 3141.5               | 5273             | 31415.9              |

| Database  | 633.4            | 3148.7               | 623.8            | 31437.5              |

### Growth Curves
Figures 6a–f show growth curves depicting \( S_t \) until \( t_{\text{max}} = 5500 \) seconds for each server VM. The target standard deviation \( \sigma \) is set to 15 over a 100-second time period. In Table 1, we present \( t_s \) (in seconds) and \( r \) (in occurrences per second) for each run.

### Repeatability of Hypercall Activities
We empirically demonstrate that, given an IDS monitoring landscape, VMs' hypercall activities exhibit repeatability. The maximum difference in \( t_s \) is 17 seconds, and in \( r \) is 26.4 occurrences per second. Over 30 runs, the maximum standard deviations are 8.036 for \( t_s \) and 15.95 for \( r \), indicating minimal non-repeatability.

### Attack Injection Scenarios
#### Scenario #1: Evaluating Xenini's Attack Coverage
- **Configuration**: \( th = 0.3 \)
- **Vulnerabilities**: CVE-2012-5525, CVE-2012-3495, CVE-2012-5513, CVE-2012-5510, CVE-2013-4494, CVE-2013-1964
- **Injection Points**: Web and mail server VMs using the LKM component of hInjector
- **Injection Timing**: 10 seconds between each attack, no delays within attacks

#### Scenario #2: Evaluating Xenini's Accuracy Against Evasive Attacks
- **Attacks**: Modified versions of the attacks from Scenario #1 (mimicry and smoke-screen attacks)
- **Injection Points**: Database server VM using the LKM component of hInjector
- **Testing Phases**: Unmodified and modified attacks injected in three separate phases

### Attack Contents
- **CVE-2012-3495**: Depicted in Fig. 3a, injected from the web server VM.
- **Other CVEs**: Depicted in Figs. 7a–e, with specific hypercalls and parameters.

### Conclusion
The small deviations in hypercall activities indicate that they are sufficiently repeatable for accurate IDS testing. The specified attack scenarios will help evaluate Xenini's coverage and accuracy against both unmodified and evasive attacks.
