Question: "In a recent security audit of an application, it was discovered that the PRNG used for cryptographic operations occasionally fails in a weak way, leading to predictable outcomes. What could be the cause of this issue, and how should it be addressed?"
 "A": "The PRNG might not be re-seeding itself with high-quality entropy sources; consider implementing a PRNG that re-seeds with hardware devices."
 "B": "The PRNG may not conform to recognized standards; ensure it meets FIPS 140-2 standards, specifically the guidelines in Annex C."
 "C": "The PRNG could be using a weak algorithm; replace it with a more secure one that provides a consistent level of protection."
 "D": "The application might not require high entropy; verify if low entropy PRNG is acceptable for its security needs."
Answer: ABC
