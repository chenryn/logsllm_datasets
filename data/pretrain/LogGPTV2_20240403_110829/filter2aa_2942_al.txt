AU-13 MONITORING FOR INFORMATION DISCLOSURE 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Within the C-SCRM context, information disclosure may occur via 
multiple avenues, including open source information. For example, supplier-provided errata may reveal 
information about an enterprise’s system that increases the risk to that system. Enterprises should ensure 
that monitoring is in place for contractor systems to detect the unauthorized disclosure of any data and that 
contract language includes a requirement that the vendor will notify the enterprise, in accordance with 
enterprise-defined time frames and as soon as possible in the event of any potential or actual unauthorized 
disclosure. Enterprises should require their prime contractors to implement this control and flow down this 
requirement to relevant sub-tier contractors. Departments and agencies should refer to Appendix F to 
implement this guidance in accordance with Executive Order 14028, Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity.

CROSS-ORGANIZATIONAL AUDIT LOGGING | SHARING OF AUDIT INFORMATION 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Whether managing a distributed audit environment or an audit data-
sharing environment between enterprises and its system integrators or external services providers, 
enterprises should establish a set of requirements for the process of sharing audit information. In the 
case of the system integrator and external service provider and the enterprise, a service-level agreement 
of the type of audit data required versus what can be provided must be agreed to in advance to ensure 
that the enterprise obtains the relevant audit information needed to ensure that appropriate protections 
are in place to meet its mission operation protection needs. Ensure that coverage of both the 
information systems and supply chain network are addressed for the collection and sharing of audit 
information. Enterprises should require their prime contractors to implement this control and flow 
down this requirement to relevant sub-level contractors.

FAMILY: ASSESSMENT, AUTHORIZATION, AND MONITORING 
[FIPS 200] specifies the Certification, Accreditation, and Security Assessments minimum 
security requirement as follows: 
Organizations must: (i) periodically assess the security controls in organizational 
information systems to determine if the controls are effective in their application; (ii) 
develop and implement plans of action designed to correct deficiencies and reduce or 
eliminate vulnerabilities in organizational information systems; (iii) authorize the 
operation of organizational information systems and any associated information system 
connections; and (iv) monitor information system security controls on an ongoing basis 
to ensure the continued effectiveness of the controls.  
Enterprises should integrate C-SCRM – including the supply chain risk management process 
and the use of relevant controls defined in this publication – into ongoing security assessment 
and authorization activities. This includes activities to assess and authorize an enterprise’s 
information systems, as well as external assessments of suppliers, developers, system 
integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers, 
where appropriate. Supply chain aspects include documentation, the tracking of chain of 
custody and system interconnections within and between enterprises, the verification of supply 
chain cybersecurity training, the verification of suppliers’ claims of conformance to security, 
product/component integrity, and validation tools and techniques for non-invasive approaches 
to detecting counterfeits or malware (e.g., Trojans) using inspection for genuine components, 
including manual inspection techniques.  
CA-1 
POLICY AND PROCEDURES 
Supplemental C- SCRM Guidance: Integrate the development and implementation of assessment and 
authorization policies and procedures for supply chain cybersecurity into the control assessment and 
authorization policy and related C-SCRM Strategy/Implementation Plan(s), policies, and system-level 
plans. To address cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain, enterprises should develop a C-SCRM 
policy (or, if required, integrate into existing policies) to direct C-SCRM activities for control assessment 
and authorization. The C-SCRM policy should define C-SCRM roles and responsibilities within the 
enterprise for conducting control assessment and authorization, any dependencies among those roles, and 
the interaction among the roles. Enterprise-wide security and privacy risks should be assessed on an 
ongoing basis and include supply chain risk assessment results.  
Level(s): 1, 2, 3

CONTROL ASSESSMENTS 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Ensure that the control assessment plan incorporates relevant C-SCRM 
controls and control enhancements. The control assessment should cover the assessment of both 
information systems and the supply chain and ensure that an enterprise-relevant baseline set of controls and 
control enhancements are identified and used for the assessment. Control assessments can include 
information from supplier audits, reviews, and supply chain-related information. Enterprises should 
develop a strategy for collecting information, including a strategy for engaging with providers on supply 
chain risk assessments. Such collaboration helps enterprises leverage information from providers, reduce

SCRM personnel should review the control assessment.   
Level(s): 2, 3 
Control Enhancement(s): 
CONTROL ASSESSMENTS | SPECIALIZED ASSESSMENTS 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Enterprises should use a variety of assessment techniques and 
methodologies, such as continuous monitoring, insider threat assessment, and malicious user 
assessment. These assessment mechanisms are context-specific and require the enterprise to 
understand its supply chain and to define the required set of measures for assessing and verifying that 
appropriate protections have been implemented.   
Level(s): 3 
CONTROL ASSESSMENTS | LEVERAGING RESULTS FROM EXTERNAL ORGANIZATIONS 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: For C-SCRM, enterprises should use external security assessments 
for suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-
related service providers. External assessments include certifications, third-party assessments, and – in 
the federal context – prior assessments performed by other departments and agencies. Certifications 
from the International Enterprise for Standardization (ISO), the National Information Assurance 
Partnership (Common Criteria), and the Open Group Trusted Technology Forum (OTTF) may also be 
used by non-federal and federal enterprises alike, if such certifications meet agency needs.  
Level(s): 3 
CA-3 
INFORMATION EXCHANGE 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: The exchange of information or data between the system and other 
systems requires scrutiny from a supply chain perspective. This includes understanding the interface 
characteristics and connections of those components/systems that are directly interconnected or the data 
that is shared through those components/systems with developers, system integrators, external system 
service providers, other ICT/OT-related service providers, and – in some cases – suppliers. Proper service-
level agreements should be in place to ensure compliance to system information exchange requirements 
defined by the enterprise, as the transfer of information between systems in different security or privacy 
domains with different security or privacy policies introduces the risk that such transfers violate one or 
more domain security or privacy policies. Examples of such interconnections can include: 
a. 
A shared development and operational environment between the enterprise and system integrator 
b. Product update/patch management connection to an off-the-shelf supplier 
c. 
Data request and retrieval transactions in a processing system that resides on an external service 
provider shared environment 
Enterprises should require their prime contractors to implement this control and flow down this 
requirement to relevant sub-tier contractors. 
Level(s): 3

systems and the supply chain. The C-SCRM POA&M should include tasks to be accomplished with a 
recommendation for completion before or after system authorization, the resources required to accomplish 
the tasks, milestones established to meet the tasks, and the scheduled completion dates for the milestones 
and tasks. The enterprise should include relevant weaknesses, the impact of weaknesses on information 
systems or the supply chain, any remediation to address weaknesses, and any continuous monitoring 
activities in its C-SCRM POA&M. The C-SCRM POA&M should be included as part of the authorization 
package. 
Level(s): 2, 3 
CA-6  
AUTHORIZATION 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Authorizing officials should include C-SCRM in authorization 
decisions. To accomplish this, supply chain risks and compensating controls documented in C-SCRM Plans 
or system security plans and the C-SCRM POA&M should be included in the authorization package as part 
of the decision-making process. Risks should be determined and associated compensating controls selected 
based on the output of criticality, threat, and vulnerability analyses. Authorizing officials may use the 
guidance in Section 2 of this document as well as NISTIR 8179 to guide the assessment process.

FAMILY: CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT 
[FIPS 200] specifies the Configuration Management minimum security requirement as follows: 
Organizations must: (i) establish and maintain baseline configurations and inventories 
of organizational information systems (including hardware, software, firmware, and 
documentation) throughout the respective system development life cycles; and (ii) 
establish and enforce security configuration settings for information technology 
products employed in organizational information systems.  
Configuration Management helps track changes made throughout the SDLC to systems, 
components, and documentation within the information systems and networks. This is important 
for knowing what changes were made to those systems, components, and documentation; who 
made the changes; and who authorized the changes. Configuration management also provides 
evidence for investigations of supply chain cybersecurity compromise when determining which 
changes were authorized and which were not. Enterprises should apply configuration 
management controls to their own systems and encourage the use of configuration management 
controls by their suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and 
other ICT/OT-related service providers. See NISTIR 7622 for more information on 
Configuration Management.   
CM-1 
POLICY AND PROCEDURES 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Configuration management impacts nearly every aspect of the supply 
chain. Configuration management is critical to the enterprise’s ability to establish the provenance of 
components, including tracking and tracing them through the SDLC and the supply chain. A properly 
defined and implemented configuration management capability provides greater assurance throughout the 
SDLC and the supply chain that components are authentic and have not been inappropriately modified. 
When defining a configuration management policy and procedures, enterprises should address the full 
SDLC, including procedures for introducing and removing components to and from the enterprise’s 
information system boundary. A configuration management policy should incorporate configuration items, 
data retention for configuration items and corresponding metadata, and tracking of the configuration item 
and its metadata. The enterprise should coordinate with suppliers, developers, system integrators, external 
system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers regarding the configuration 
management policy.   
Level(s): 1, 2, 3 
CM-2 
BASELINE CONFIGURATION 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Enterprises should establish a baseline configuration of both the 
information system and the development environment, including documenting, formally reviewing, and 
securing the agreement of stakeholders. The purpose of the baseline is to provide a starting point for 
tracking changes to components, code, and/or settings throughout the SDLC. Regular reviews and updates 
of baseline configurations (i.e., re-baselining) are critical for traceability and provenance. The baseline 
configuration must take into consideration the enterprise’s operational environment and any relevant 
supplier, developer, system integrator, external system service provider, and other ICT/OT-related service 
provider involvement with the organization’s information systems and networks. If the system integrator, 
for example, uses the existing organization’s infrastructure, appropriate measures should be taken to 
establish a baseline that reflects an appropriate set of agreed-upon criteria for access and operation.
