Service-level agreements must be agreed upon in advance to ensure that the enterprise obtains the necessary audit information to meet its mission operation protection needs. Both information systems and the supply chain network should be covered for the collection and sharing of audit information. Prime contractors should implement this control and flow it down to sub-tier contractors.
**Level(s):** 2, 3

### Assessment, Authorization, and Monitoring

[FIPS 200] specifies the minimum security requirements for Certification, Accreditation, and Security Assessments as follows:
1. Periodically assess the security controls in organizational information systems to determine their effectiveness.
2. Develop and implement plans of action to correct deficiencies and reduce vulnerabilities.
3. Authorize the operation of organizational information systems and associated connections.
4. Monitor information system security controls on an ongoing basis to ensure their continued effectiveness.

Enterprises should integrate C-SCRM into ongoing security assessment and authorization activities, including assessing and authorizing information systems and conducting external assessments of suppliers, developers, system integrators, and other ICT/OT-related service providers. Supply chain aspects include documentation, tracking chain of custody, verifying cybersecurity training, and validating product/component integrity.

Control assessments can include information from supplier audits, reviews, and supply chain-related information. Enterprises should develop a strategy for collecting information and engaging with providers to leverage information, reduce redundancy, and identify potential courses of action for risk responses. C-SCRM personnel should review the control assessment.
**Level(s):** 2, 3

### Control Enhancement

#### CONTROL ASSESSMENTS | SPECIALIZED ASSESSMENTS
**Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance:** Use a variety of assessment techniques and methodologies, such as continuous monitoring, insider threat assessment, and malicious user assessment. These mechanisms are context-specific and require the enterprise to understand its supply chain and define the required measures for assessing and verifying appropriate protections.

**Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance:** Scrutinize the exchange of information or data between the system and other systems from a supply chain perspective. Understand the interface characteristics and connections of those components/systems, and ensure proper service-level agreements are in place to comply with system information exchange requirements. Examples of interconnections include shared development and operational environments, product update/patch management, and data request and retrieval transactions. Prime contractors should implement this control and flow it down to sub-tier contractors.
**Level(s):** 3

#### CA-5 PLAN OF ACTION AND MILESTONES (POA&M)
**Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance:** Ensure a separate POA&M exists for C-SCRM, covering both information systems and the supply chain. The POA&M should include tasks, resources, milestones, and scheduled completion dates. It should also include relevant weaknesses, their impact, remediation, and continuous monitoring activities. The C-SCRM POA&M should be part of the authorization package.
**Level(s):** 2, 3

#### CA-6 AUTHORIZATION
**Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance:** Authorizing officials should include C-SCRM in authorization decisions. Supply chain risks and compensating controls documented in C-SCRM Plans or system security plans and the C-SCRM POA&M should be included in the authorization package.

### Configuration Management

[FIPS 200] specifies the minimum security requirements for Configuration Management as follows:
1. Establish and maintain baseline configurations and inventories of organizational information systems (including hardware, software, firmware, and documentation) throughout the system development life cycle.
2. Establish and enforce security configuration settings for IT products employed in organizational information systems.

Configuration Management helps track changes made throughout the SDLC to systems, components, and documentation. It is important for knowing what changes were made, who made them, and who authorized them. Configuration management also provides evidence for investigations of supply chain cybersecurity compromises.

#### CM-1 POLICY AND PROCEDURES
**Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance:** Configuration management impacts nearly every aspect of the supply chain. It is critical for establishing the provenance of components and ensuring their authenticity and integrity. When defining a configuration management policy and procedures, address the full SDLC, including introducing and removing components. The policy should incorporate configuration items, data retention, and tracking. Coordinate with suppliers, developers, system integrators, and other ICT/OT-related service providers regarding the configuration management policy.
**Level(s):** 1, 2, 3

#### CM-2 BASELINE CONFIGURATION
**Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance:** Establish a baseline configuration for both the information system and the development environment, including documenting, formally reviewing, and securing stakeholder agreement. Regularly review and update baseline configurations for traceability and provenance. Consider the enterprise’s operational environment and any relevant supplier, developer, system integrator, or external service provider involvement. If the system integrator uses the existing organization’s infrastructure, establish a baseline reflecting agreed-upon criteria for access and operation. Prime contractors should implement this control and flow it down to sub-tier contractors. Departments and agencies should refer to Appendix F for implementation guidance in accordance with Executive Order 14028, Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity.

**Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance:** Consider changes to the information system and underlying or interoperable systems and networks to determine whether these changes affect existing security controls and warrant additional or different protection to maintain an acceptable level of cybersecurity risk. Include stakeholders such as system engineers and system security engineers in impact analysis activities. NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5 control enhancement CM-4 (1) can be used to protect the information system from vulnerabilities introduced through the test environment.
**Level(s):** 3

### Control Enhancement

#### IMPACT ANALYSES | SEPARATE TEST ENVIRONMENTS

**Level(s):** 3

#### CM-6 CONFIGURATION SETTINGS
**Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance:** Oversee the function of modifying configuration settings for information systems and networks and throughout the SDLC. Methods of oversight include periodic verification, reporting, and review. Share resulting information with parties that have access to, are connected to, or engage in the creation of the enterprise’s information systems and networks on a need-to-know basis. Changes should be tested and approved before implementation. Monitor and audit configuration settings to alert designated enterprise personnel when a change has occurred. Prime contractors should implement this control and flow it down to sub-tier contractors. Departments and agencies should refer to Appendix F for implementation guidance in accordance with Executive Order 14028, Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity.
