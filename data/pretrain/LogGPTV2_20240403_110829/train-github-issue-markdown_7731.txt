### Current Behavior:
In a normal terminal `npm install` yields `must not have multiple workspaces
with the same name` without any mention of conflicting namespaces.
Opening a debug terminal in VSCode and running the same command in same folder
clears the problem and `npm install` now works in both terminals.
### Expected Behavior:
Conflicting workspaces should be named.
### Steps To Reproduce:
See `Current behavior`
### Environment:
  * OS: Windows 10
  * Node: 15.6.0
  * npm: 7.4.0
