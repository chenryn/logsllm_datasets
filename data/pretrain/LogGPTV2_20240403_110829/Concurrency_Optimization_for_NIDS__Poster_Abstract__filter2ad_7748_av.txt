**Abstract:**
Fatty acids (FAs) are dietary components that have long been associated with health and disease. However, FA analysis typically involves diverse fractions derived from blood, erythrocytes, or adipose tissue. In epidemiological and nutrition studies, serum phospholipid and total lipid fractions are commonly used, but there is a notable gap regarding the clinical utility of more convenient lipid pools, such as serum non-esterified FAs (NEFA), as dietary biomarkers.

In this pilot study, 50 subjects from the FAMILY birth cohort were selected based on a devised diet index to form "good diet" and "poor diet" groups. Comprehensive analyses of serum NEFA and total FAs were performed using multisegment injection-non-aqueous-capillary electrophoresis–mass spectrometry (MSI-NACE-MS). The study investigated associations between circulating FAs and the diet index score, fish, dairy, and fiber servings, as derived from standardized food-frequency questionnaires (FFQs).

Results showed that pregnant women in the "good diet" group had higher levels of EPA and DHA (q = 0.35, R²Y > 0.99, Q² > 0.71, p-values < 0.05). These findings highlight the potential of serum NEFA and total FAs as reliable biomarkers of maternal dietary fat intake.

**Abstract:**
Dendritic cells (DCs) play a crucial role in the immune response to bacterial and viral infections. To better understand the metabolic changes associated with DC activation, we conducted a comprehensive metabolomic analysis using capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS). Over 150 metabolites were robustly monitored, and dramatic metabolic changes were observed upon DC activation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), affecting more than 100 metabolites.

Bacterial and viral DC activations could be distinguished by significant fluctuations in over 70 metabolites. The analysis revealed alterations in four main metabolic pathways: alanine-aspartate-glutamine, glutathione, pyrimidine, and the Krebs cycle. These pathways were significantly upregulated in response to bacterial infection and downregulated in viral infection. Our approach provides an unprecedented, powerful, and straightforward method to monitor the metabolic activation of immune cells, facilitating the discovery of biomarkers specific to bacterial or viral infections.

### Discovering Metabolic Biomarkers for Predicting Efficacy of Anti-Histamine Treatment in Chronic Urticaria Patients

**Abstract:**
Chronic urticaria is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by recurrent episodes lasting more than six weeks. The first-line treatment for chronic urticaria is antihistamines, which are effective but exhibit large inter-individual variations in response. This study aimed to discover metabolic biomarkers for predicting the therapeutic outcome of antihistamine treatment in patients with chronic urticaria using a metabolomics approach.

Plasma samples from 60 patients with chronic urticaria were collected. Of these, 25 showed a response to antihistamines, while 35 were non-responders. Plasma metabolomes were analyzed using gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS). Multivariate statistical analysis was conducted, and biomarkers were selected based on fold change differences between the two groups, with a false discovery rate-adjusted P value less than 0.05.

The results identified palmitic acid and stearic acid as putative biomarkers, which were significantly higher in the non-responder group. These findings suggest that changes in lipid metabolism are linked to the efficacy of antihistamine treatment in chronic urticaria patients.
