Fatty acids (FAs) are dietary components that have long been implicated in health and disease However, FAs analysis encompasses diverse fractions 
derived from blood, erythrocytes or adipose tissue To date, serum phospholipid and total lipid fractions are often used in epidemiological and nutrition 
studies with a notable gap regarding the clinical utility of more convenient lipid pools for dietary biomarkers, such as serum non-esterified FAs (NEFA) 
In this study, 50 subjects from FAMILY birth cohort were selected based on a devised diet index to constitute a “good diet” and a “poor diet” group 
Comprehensive analyses of serum NEFA and total FAs were performed using multisegment injection-non-aqueous-capillary electrophoresis–mass 
spectrometry (MSI-NACE-MS) to investigate associations of circulating FAs with the diet index score, fish, dairy and fiber servings derived from 
standardized food-frequency questionnaires (FFQs) Pregnant women within the good diet group had higher EPA and DHA (q 035, R2Y>099, Q2>071 and p-values 
CV-ANOVA 150 metabolites robustly monitored) and identified dramatic 
metabolic changes upon DC activation with LPS (>100 metabolites impacted), whereas bacterial and viral DC activations can be distinguished by 
significant fluctuations in more than 70 metabolites Those Metabolomic analyses revealed alterations in four main metabolic pathways (alanine-
aspartate-glutamine, glutathione, and pyrimidine pathways, Krebs cycle), significantly upregulated upon bacterial infection and downregulated in 
the case of viral infection The few metabolites already described were confirmed while many others were also highlighted, thus enabling a better 
comprehension of the metabolic mechanisms of pathogen-specific DC activation Our approach represents an unprecedented, powerful and 
straightforward way to robustly monitor metabolic activation of immune cells that would facilitate the discovery of biomarkers specifically signing 
bacterial or viral infection

Chronic urticaria is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that occurs for more than six weeks and recurs frequently First line treatment of chronic 
urticaria is anti-histamine, which is proven to be effective but bares large inter-individual variation in response Thus, the aim of this study was 
to discover metabolic biomarkers for predicting therapeutic outcome of anti-histamine treatment in patients with chronic urticaria by using 
metabolomics approach Total 60 plasma samples were collected from patients suffering from chronic urticaria Twenty five of them showed 
response to anti-histamine and thirty five of them were diagnosed as non-responders Plasma metabolomes were analyzed using GC-TOF-MS 
Multivariate statistical analysis were conducted where biomarkers were selected according to fold change difference between two groups with 
false discovery rate adjusted P value less than 005 As a result, palmitic acid and stearic acid were selected as putative biomarkers, which were 
significantly higher in non-responder group Therefore, we speculate changes in lipid metabolism are linked with the efficacy of anti-histamine
