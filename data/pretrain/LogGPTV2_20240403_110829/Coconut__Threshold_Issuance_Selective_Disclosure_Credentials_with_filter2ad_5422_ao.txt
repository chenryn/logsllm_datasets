1 where ˜r ∈ Fp is unknown by the users
(as in Pointcheval and Sanders [43]). However, since h is
deterministic, every authority can uniquely derive it in isolation
and forgeries are prevented since different m0 and m1 cannot
lead to the same value of h.3 As described in Section III-C,
the blind signature scheme of Pointcheval and Sanders builds
the credentials directly from a commitment of the attribute
and a blinding factor secretly chosen by the authority; this is
unsuitable for issuance of threshold credentials. We circumvent
that problem by introducing the El-Gamal ciphertext c in our
scheme and exploiting its homomorphism, as described above.
Upon reception of ˜c, the users decrypt it using their El-
Gamal private key d to recover the partial credentials σi =
(h, hxi+yi·m); this is performed by the Unblind algorithm ().
Then, the users can call the AggCred algorithm to aggregate
any subset of t partial credentials. This algorithm uses the
Lagrange basis polynomial l which allows to reconstruct the
original v(0) and w(0) through polynomial interpolation;
v(0) =
v(i)li
and w(0) =
w(i)li
t(cid:88)i=1
t(cid:88)i=1
However, this computation happens in the exponent—neither
the authorities nor the users should know the values v(0) and
w(0). One can easily verify the correctness of AggCred of t
partial credentials σi = (hi, si) as below.
s =
(si)li =
t(cid:89)i=1
t(cid:89)i=1
t(cid:89)i=1(cid:0)hxi+yi·m(cid:1)li
t(cid:89)i=1
t(cid:89)i=1
(hyi·m)li =
(hxi )li
