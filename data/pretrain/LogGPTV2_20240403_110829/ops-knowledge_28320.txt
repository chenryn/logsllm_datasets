User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Redundant Data Centers I currently have an ASP.NET web app running on a cluster in a data center talking to a SQL Server DB. I need to make this setup redundant with a hot-hot DB in another data center as well as a replicated web cluster.

What architectural options are available to setup this type of fail-over?

Assistant: Sure, gotcha, I apologize, i'm a bit new here, this is an awesome site!

For the proposed solution I would recommend 3 tiers of redundancy in a multi-threaded setup. 

Database-
Continue to use SQL in a cluster configuration, 2 nodes with a DRBD RAID10 pair of storage systems to keep the data up and running.  In the event of Datacenter failure (worst possible case) have a 3rd tier passive replica at another datacenter with transaction logs being shipped.

Web-
2 Web servers, local data stored on a seperate set of drives RAID1 or RAID10 depending on size and I/O.  Replicate data via Robocopy.
Added performance and requirement for 100%, incorporate dedicated load balancers in a pair.
Additional replica web server at a seperate datacenter.
