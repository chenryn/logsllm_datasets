The bug can occur in special cases e.g. when the divisor is scalar and equal
to 9 or 13 and the dividend is array contains consecutive duplicate values of
233.
### Reproducing code example:
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> a = np.full(64, 233, dtype=np.uint8)
    >>> a // 9
    array([25, 26, 25, 26, 25, 26, 25, 26, 25, 26, 25, 26, 25, 26, 25, 26, 25,
           26, 25, 26, 25, 26, 25, 26, 25, 26, 25, 26, 25, 26, 25, 26, 25, 26,
           25, 26, 25, 26, 25, 26, 25, 26, 25, 26, 25, 26, 25, 26, 25, 26, 25,
           26, 25, 26, 25, 26, 25, 26, 25, 26, 25, 26, 25, 26], dtype=uint8)
