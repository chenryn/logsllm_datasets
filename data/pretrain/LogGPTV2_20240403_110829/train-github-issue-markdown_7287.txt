The bug can occur in specific cases, such as when the divisor is a scalar and equal to 9 or 13, and the dividend is an array containing consecutive duplicate values of 233.

### Reproducing Code Example:
```python
import numpy as np

# Create an array of 64 elements, each with the value 233, using uint8 data type
a = np.full(64, 233, dtype=np.uint8)

# Perform integer division by 9
result = a // 9

# Expected output: An array of 64 elements, all with the same value
# Actual output: An array with alternating values of 25 and 26
print(result)
```

### Output:
```python
array([25, 26, 25, 26, 25, 26, 25, 26, 25, 26, 25, 26, 25, 26, 25, 26, 25,
       26, 25, 26, 25, 26, 25, 26, 25, 26, 25, 26, 25, 26, 25, 26, 25, 26,
       25, 26, 25, 26, 25, 26, 25, 26, 25, 26, 25, 26, 25, 26, 25, 26, 25,
       26, 25, 26, 25, 26, 25, 26, 25, 26, 25, 26, 25, 26], dtype=uint8)
```
