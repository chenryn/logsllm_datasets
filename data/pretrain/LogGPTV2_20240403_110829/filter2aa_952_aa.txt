INTRODUCTION 
The cloak-and-dagger of cybercrime makes for entertaining theater. 
That’s especially true for sensational breaches often caused by malware 
or other sophisticated attacks. Behind the drama though are some 
inherent vulnerabilities making these attacks possible. 
A myriad of device models, operating system versions, and unique 
software modifications makes handling Android vulnerabilities a 
challenge. The earlier these vulnerabilities are born in the supply chain, 
the more difficult they are to fix.  
Fixes require mind-bending coordination between suppliers, 
manufacturers, carriers and users before patches make it from the 
drawing board to installation. The fragmented world of Android leaves 
many users exposed to risk, even with out-of-the-box devices. 
In this report, the research team details four newly-discovered 
vulnerabilities affecting over 900 million Android smartphones and 
tablets. If exploited, each of these can give attackers complete control of 
devices and access to sensitive personal and enterprise data on them.  
QUADROOTER 
QuadRooter is a set of four vulnerabilities affecting Android devices built 
on Qualcomm® chipsets. The world’s leading designer of LTE chipsets, 
Qualcomm owns a 65% share of the LTE modem baseband market.1

WHAT IS ROOTING? 
Rooting enables administrative 
control of a device and allows apps to 
run privileged commands not usually 
available on factory-configured 
devices. An attacker can use these 
commands to perform operations like 
changing or removing system-level 
files, deleting or adding apps, as well 
as accessing hardware on the device, 
including the touchscreen, camera, 
microphone, and other sensors.  
If any one of the four vulnerabilities is exploited, an attacker can 
trigger privilege escalations and gain root access to a device.  
An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities 
using a malicious app. These apps require no 
special permissions to take advantage of these 
vulnerabilities, alleviating any suspicion users 
may have when installing.  
The vulnerabilities are found in Qualcomm’s 
software drivers that come with its chipsets. 
The drivers, controlling communication 
between chipset components, become 
incorporated into Android builds 
manufacturers develop for their devices.  
Pre-installed on devices at the point of 
manufacturing, these vulnerable drivers can 
only be fixed by installing a patch from the 
distributor or carrier. Distributors and carriers 
can only issue patches after receiving fixed 
driver packs from Qualcomm.  
The research team provided Qualcomm with information about 
the vulnerabilities in April 2016. The team then followed the 
industry-standard disclosure policy (CERT/CC policy) of allowing 
90 days for patches to be produced before disclosing these 
vulnerabilities to the public.  
Qualcomm reviewed these vulnerabilities, classified each as high 
risk, and confirmed that it released patches to original equipment 
manufacturers (OEMs). 
This affects an estimated 900 million Android devices 
manufactured by OEMs like Samsung, HTC, Motorola, LG and 
more. In fact, some of the latest and most popular Android 
devices found on the market today use the vulnerable Qualcomm 
chipsets including:

BlackBerry Priv
Blackphone 1 and 2
Google Nexus 5X, 6 and 6P
HTC One M9 and HTC 10
LG G4, G5, and V10
New Moto X by Motorola
OnePlus One, 2 and 3
Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge
Sony Xperia Z Ultra
Unique vulnerabilities affect four modules. Each vulnerability 
impacts a device’s entire Android system:   
IPC Router (inter-process communication)
The ipc_router module provides inter-process communication
for various Qualcomm components, user mode processes, and
hardware drivers.
Ashmem (Android kernel anonymous shared memory feature)
Android’s propriety memory allocation subsystem, Ashmem
enables processes to share memory buffers efficiently. Android
devices using Qualcomm chipsets use a modified ashmem 
system, providing easy access to the subsystem API from the
GPU drivers.
kgsl (kernel graphics support layer) &
kgsl_sync (kernel graphics support layer sync)
The Qualcomm GPU component kgsl is a kernel driver that
renders graphics by communicating with user-mode binaries.
While this driver includes many modules, kgsl_sync is the one
responsible for synchronization between the CPU and apps.

FRAGMENTATION 
VISUALIZED 
A number of factors 
contribute to Android 
fragmentation including 
different Android builds 
for different device 
makers, models, carriers 
and distributors.  
WHY DOES THIS KEEP HAPPENING? THE SUPPLY CHAIN. 
Suppliers, like chipset makers, provide the hardware and software modules needed to manufacture 
smartphones and tables. Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) combine these software modules, 
Android builds from Google, and their own customizations to create a unique Android build for a 
particular device. Distributors resell the devices, often including their own customizations and apps –
creating yet another unique Android build. When patches are required, they must flow through this supply 
chain before making it onto an end user’s device. That process often takes weeks or even months.

RECOMMENDATIONS 
Vulnerabilities like QuadRooter bring the unique challenge of securing 
Android devices into focus:  
Fragmentation puts the responsibility of keeping Android devices and
their data safe into the hands of a complex supply chain.
Making patches and security updates available is resource and time-
intensive – leaving users without protection while these are coded,
tested, accepted and distributed.
In-market devices that cannot support the latest versions of Android
may not receive important security updates at all, leaving them
exposed to new vulnerabilities.
End-users remain poorly informed by retailers and employers on the
risks of using mobile devices and networks, including the risks of
rooting, downloading apps from third-party sources, and using public
Wi-Fi® networks.
These gaps not only put at risk the user’s personal information, but
also any sensitive enterprise information that may be on their device.
Stake holders throughout the Android supply chain continue to explore 
comprehensive solutions that address these concerns. They are no doubt 
motivated by the United States Federal Communications Commission2

and Federal Trade Commission3, which recently requested explanations 
from carriers and manufacturers for why the Android security update 
process is so badly broken. 
Unfortunately, reasonable solutions require coordination and 
standardization across the industry. Until then, Check Point continues to 
recommend these best practices to keep your Android devices safe: 
Download and install the latest Android updates as soon as they
become available. These include important security updates that help
keep your device and data protected.
Understand the risks of rooting your device – either intentionally or
as a result of an attack.
Avoid side-loading Android apps (.APK files) or downloading apps
from third-party sources. Instead, practice good app hygiene by
downloading apps only from Google Play.
Carefully read permission requests when installing apps. Be wary of
apps that ask for unusual or unnecessary permissions or that use
large amounts of data or battery life.
Use known, trusted Wi-Fi networks. If traveling, use only networks
you can verify are provided by a trustworthy source.
Consider mobile security solutions that detect suspicious behavior on
a device, including malware hiding in installed apps.
