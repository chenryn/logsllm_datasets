## Expected Behavior
A React.Component should be returned when using:  
`private responsiveDialog = withResponsiveFullScreen({ breakpoint: 'sm'
})(Dialog);`  
This means that `withResponsiveFullScreen({ breakpoint: 'sm' })` should return
a function that accepts a type and returns the new Component with responsive
properties.
## Current Behavior
Currently calling `withResponsiveFullScreen({ breakpoint: 'sm' })` returns a
React.Component. This is out of line with the expected behaviour when looking
at the funciton in withResponsiveFullScreen.js.  
The definition of withResponsiveFullScreen in withResponsiveFullScreen.d.ts
should probably be changed to return a function.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. `private responsiveDialog = withResponsiveFullScreen({ breakpoint: 'sm' })(Dialog);` when using typescript.
