and the CUSUM procedures by quantifying the eﬀect of the
attack sequence δk on process dynamics when they are used
to detect anomalies. In particular, we characterize for a class
of zero-alarm attacks, the largest deviation on the estimation
error due to the attack sequence. We derive upper bounds
on the expectation of the estimation error given the sys-
tem dynamics, the Kalman ﬁlter, the attack sequence, and
the parameters of the detection procedure. For the same
class of attacks, we quantify the largest deviation of the ex-
pectation for the estimation error when using the bad-data
procedure and then compare it with the one obtained with
the CUSUM.
4.2.1
In this section we will evaluate the impact of a class of
zero-alarm attacks on system state estimation. This can be
termed as worst case analysis as the attacker is able to do
damage and still not get detected. As stated in section 3,
the attacker has complete knowledge of system dynamics
Impact of Zero-Alarm Attacks
and detection algorithms. Based on this information an at-
tacker generates an attack sequence δk, such that detection
algorithms would not generate an alarm. Although this at-
tack goes undetected it can induce changes in the system
dynamics and here we analyze such a disturbance in this
section. First, consider the bad-data procedure and write
the left-hand side of (14) in terms of the estimation error
ek:
|rk,i| = |Ciek + ηk,i + δk,i|,
i ∈ I.
(17)
By assumption, the attacker has access to yk,i = Ciyk + ηk,i.
Moreover, given its perfect knowledge of the Kalman ﬁlter,
the opponent can compute the estimated output Ci ˆxk and
then construct Ciek + ηk,i. It follows that
δk,i = −Ciek − ηk,i + αi → |rk,i| = αi,
i ∈ I,
(18)
is a feasible attack sequence given the capabilities of the at-
tacker. These attacks maximize the damage to the CPS by
immediately saturating and maintaining |rk,i| at the thresh-
old αi. Deﬁne α := col(α1, . . . , αm). Then, the expectation
of the estimation error under the attack (18) is given by
E[ek+1] = AE[ek] − Lα.
(19)
If ρ[A] > 1, then ||E[ek]|| diverges to inﬁnity as k → ∞
[7]. That is, the attack sequence (18) destabilizes the sys-

not diverge to inﬁnity depending on algebraic and geomet-
ric multiplicities of the eigenvalues with unit modulus of A
(a known fact from stability of LTI systems [7]).
Proposition 1. Consider the process (1), the Kalman ﬁlter
(3)-(6), and the Bad-Data procedure (14). Let the sensors be
attacked by the bad-data zero-alarm attack sequence (18).
Then, if ρ[A]  τi. As with the bad-
data, we look for attack sequences that immediately saturate
and then maintain the CUSUM statistic at the threshold
Sk,i = τi. Assume that the attack starts at some k = k∗ ≥ 2
and Sk∗−1,i ≤ τi, i.e., the attack does not start immediately
after a false alarm. Consider the attack:
(cid:26) τi + bi − Ciek − ηk,i − Sk−1,i, k = k∗,
δk,i =
bi − Ciek − ηk,i, k > k∗.
(21)
Launching a zero-alarm attack to deceive a CUSUM detector
is not as simple as doing the same for the bad-data detec-
tor. Since CUSUM test depends on accumulated sum over

the time, to launch an attack as in (21), an attacker needs
to know Sk∗−1,i, i.e., the value of the CUSUM sequence one
step before the attack. This is a strong assumption since
it represents a real-time quantity that is not communicated
over the communication network. Even if the opponent has
access to the parameters of the CUSUM, (bi, τi), given the
stochastic nature of the residuals, the attacker would need
to know the complete history of observations (from when
the CUSUM was started) to be able to reconstruct Sk∗−1,i
from data. This is an inherent security advantage in fa-
vor of the CUSUM over static detectors like the bad-data
or chi-squared. Nevertheless, for evaluating the worst case
scenario, we assume that the attacker has access to Sk∗−1,i.
Deﬁne b := col(b1, . . . , bm), τ := col(τ1, . . . , τm), and, with-
out loss of generality, assume k∗ = 2. Then, by construc-
tion, E[xi] = E[ei] = 0, i = 1, 2, and the expectation of the
closed-loop system under the attack sequence (21) is written
as: E[x3] = 0, E[e3] = −Lτ , and, for k > k∗ = 2,
E[ek+1] = AE[ek] − Lb.
(22)
Proposition 2. Consider the process (1), the Kalman ﬁlter
(3)-(6), and the CUSUM procedure (13). Let the sensors be
attacked by the CUSUM zero-alarm attack sequence (21).
Then, if ρ[A]  1, i.e.,
the system model is open-loop unstable. We remark
that this case considers input attacks. We have no
information about the starting time and the structure
of these control input attacks. It makes this scenario
interesting for testing the eﬀectiveness of our detection
schemes.
Figure 6 shows the evolution of the residuals under the
zero-alarm attack for scenario 1. The top plot depicts the
residual for the level sensor reading of the storage tank
when the system is running under normal conditions. Each
value of k represents sampling time from the simulations in
EPANET (sampling interval in this case study is 15 min-
utes). The zero-alarm attack for the bad-data detector is
designed as in (18). The attack is launched at k = 150, so
that the ﬁrst 150 data samples are attack free. This helps
us to understand the evolution of the residuals before and
during the attack. After the attack is launched, the resid-
ual approaches the threshold αk,i (as seen in Figure 6); and
stays there for the rest of the simulation (because attack is
not removed). This zero-alarm attack leads to deviations in
the state estimates and sensor measurements (as shown in
