User: Cannot locate PIP in a newly-installed Python3.4 (redhat linux 4) environment.
$ python -V
Python 3.4.1
$ which pip
/usr/bin/which: no pip in (/usr/
$ python -m pip install requests
/usr/local/bin/python3.4: No module named pip
I installed this as an alternate installation and am able to successfully create and run python3.4 scripts. Our other implementation is python 2.3 with no pip.
Any help is greatly appreciated.
Assistant: In Python 3 the program will be installed as pip3.
So you should be able to find it using which pip3.
