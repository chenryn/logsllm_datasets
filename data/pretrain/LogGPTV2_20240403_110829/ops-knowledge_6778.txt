User: Please explain what is HTTP protocol and HTTPS protocol? Please describe their differences, advantages and disadvantages, and analyze the application scenarios of HTTPS.
Assistant: The HTTP protocol (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is a protocol for transmitting hypertext data on the network. It is the basis of Web data exchange, including the two processes of the client requesting information from the server and the server returning information to the client. HTTP works at the application layer and is based on the TCP protocol. The HTTPS protocol (HTTP Secure) is based on the HTTP protocol, adding SSL / TLS encryption technology during transmission, so as to ensure the security of data during transmission. HTTPS adds a security protocol layer on the basis of the transmission protocol. When the transmission path is particularly vulnerable to attacks, HTTPS is more secure. The differences, advantages and disadvantages of the two protocols are as follows: 1. Data transmission methods are different. HTTP data is transmitted in plain text, while HTTPS data is transmitted in cipher text; 2. The scenarios where the protocols are widely used are different. HTTP is suitable for scenarios that do not require confidentiality and integrity, such as Browsing and transmission of information; HTTPS is suitable for important information transmission, such as online shopping, online banking, etc.; 3. Different security Data during HTTP transmission is vulnerable to malicious attacks, HTTPS uses SSL/TLS encryption technology, which can ensure data 4. The access speed is different. HTTP is faster than HTTPS, because HTTPS needs to be encrypted and decrypted during transmission; 5. The deployment cost is different. HTTPS needs to obtain an SSL certificate from a certificate authority or a self-built CA. Installing an SSL certificate will cost A certain cost. HTTPS has a wide range of application scenarios, especially for scenarios involving personal privacy and sensitive information, such as financial transactions, e-commerce transactions, social networking sites, user account login, mailboxes, and so on. With the increasing awareness of Internet security, the application scope of HTTPS is still expanding.
