The following table compares the `contains` operators using the abbreviations provided:
* RHS = right-hand side of the expression
* LHS = left-hand side of the expression
|Operator   |Description   |Case-Sensitive  |Example (yields `true`)  |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|-------------------------|
|[`contains`](../kusto/query/contains-operator.md) |RHS occurs as a subsequence of LHS |No |`"FabriKam" contains "BRik"`|
|[`!contains`](../kusto/query/not-contains-operator.md) |RHS doesn't occur in LHS |No |`"Fabrikam" !contains "xyz"`|
|[`contains_cs`](../kusto/query/contains-cs-operator.md) |RHS occurs as a subsequence of LHS |Yes |`"FabriKam" contains_cs "Kam"`|
|[`!contains_cs`](../kusto/query/not-contains-cs-operator.md)   |RHS doesn't occur in LHS |Yes |`"Fabrikam" !contains_cs "Kam"`|
For more information about other operators and to determine which operator is most appropriate for your query, see [datatype string operators](../kusto/query/datatypes-string-operators.md).
