Assistant: At 17-06-09 20:11:08, a task (TID 1224) was assigned to an executor. The executor then proceeded to compute two partitions (rdd_42_23 and rdd_42_24) from the hdfs file 2kSOSP.log. The computation of these partitions was completed and stored in memory as bytes. Another task (TID 1220) was finished and the result was sent to the driver. Finally, another task (TID 1225) was assigned to the executor.
