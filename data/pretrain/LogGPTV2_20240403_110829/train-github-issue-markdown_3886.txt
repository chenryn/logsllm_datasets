Please describe how to reproduce this issue, and include links to screenshots
if possible.
My code:
    var count = 0;
    function cc(card) {
      // Only change code below this line
      switch(card){
        case 2:
        case 3:
        case 4:
        case 5:
        case 6:
          count += 1;
          break;
        case 7:
        case 8:
        case 9:
          count = 0;
          break;
        case 10:
        case 'J':
        case 'Q':
        case 'K':
        case 'A':
          count -= 1;
          break;
      }
      if(count == 5){
        return "5 Bet";
      }
      else if (count === 0){
        return "0 Hold";
      }
      else if (count == -5){
        return "-5 Hold";
      }
      else{
        return "-1 Hold";
      }
      // Only change code above this line
    }
    // Add/remove calls to test your function.
    // Note: Only the last will display
    cc(2); cc(3); cc(7); cc('K'); cc('A');
I don't understand how my code solves the problem. Yet it solves all the
challenges required to pass the waypoint. I sort of gamed it. I don't believe
my code is right. So this waypoint is probably bugged and needs to be
reframed. What do you think, guys?
