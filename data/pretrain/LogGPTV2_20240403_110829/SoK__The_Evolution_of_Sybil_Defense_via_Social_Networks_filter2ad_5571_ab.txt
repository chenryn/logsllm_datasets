where the volume of S is deﬁned as vol(S) :=
v∈S deg(v)
(the sum of the degrees of vertices in S), and the cut induced
by S is the set cut(S) of edges with one endpoint in S and
the other endpoint outside of S. Finally, the conductance of
a graph G is deﬁned as
ϕ(G) := min
vol(S)≤|E| ϕ(S).
B. Which property is most resilient?
Consider a social network G in which every node is
honest, and assume a sybil defense that uses a structural
property of the social graph to correctly classify every node.
An attack that somehow turns some of the nodes in G into
sybils, without otherwise affecting the social network, will
be undetectable, since it will change nothing tangible. We
could term this a perfect attack. Similarly, if an adversary
can add sybil identities to G without altering G’s structural
properties, then any sybil defense that tries to leverage those
properties will be circumvented.
We can however compare the four structural properties
above in terms of the effort they require of an adversary
bent on evading detection: in particular, we measure the
number of attack edges that the adversary needs to create to
be undetectable.
To this end, we assume that a graph H with n honest
nodes is given and that the attack induces a graph S of
sybil nodes. While H is ﬁxed, the adversary has full control
over S and can build it so that its structural properties
are indistinguishable from those of H—for simplicity, we
assume that S is an exact copy of H.
The adversary tries to set up m := |E(H)| potential attack
edges that connect H with S. We assume that the endpoints
of these edges in both H and S are chosen by preferential
attachment, i.e. a vertex v is chosen with probability
deg(v)
2m

As we will see, preferential attachment is crucial to not alter
properties of the social network and in particular its degree
distribution.
If the attacker is able to create arbitrarily many attack
edges, no sybil defense can hope to distinguish between the
two regions of the graph. Therefore, as customary in the
sybil defense literature [45], [46], we assume that the at−
tacker’s ability to create attack edges is limited; in particular,
we postulate that tentative attack edges are accepted with
probability p and rejected with probability 1 − p, resulting
in a set A of attack edges. To account for the outcome of
recent social engineering experiments [6], we allow p to
be constant: the expected cardinality of A is then pm. We
denote with G the graph that results from joining S to H
via A.
Under this simple attack model, how resilient are then the
four deﬁning structural properties of social graphs?
1) Popularity: We ﬁnd that it is trivial for the adversary
to make sure that G’s popularity distribution is statistically
indistinguishable from that of H. We prove [2] that a) the
expected degree of an honest node in G is barely higher than
in H and b) moving to G will, in essence, at most double
the degree of a popular honest node.

are inserted respectively with probability p = 0.01 and
p = 0.1: the curves before and after the attacks have the
same shape. Indeed, an attack that introduced no attack
edges would produce the same curve! We conclude that
popularity is ill−suited as a foundation for sybil defense.

The implications of this theorem are disappointingly clear:
the clustering coefﬁcient
is not a good basis for sybil
defense, since even after the attack its value cannot drop by
too much. In fact, if the number of attack edges is smaller
than pm, with high probability there will be only a constant
change in the clustering coefﬁcient. The Clustering Coeff
column of Table I conﬁrms the theorem’s predictions.
4) Conductance: Yu et al. [45] prove that for graphs
whose conductance is asymptotically constant, an adversary
that can introduce O(n) attack edges can build a graph G
whose conductance is indistinguishable from that of H. We
generalize that result to graphs of arbitrary conductance as
follows [2].
Figure 1. Degree distribution of the Facebook graph before and after
attack. The attack shifts the distribution up (because it doubles the size of
the graph) and to the right (proportionally to the number of attack edges),
but does not change the shape of the curves.
2) Small world property: The small world property does
not fare much better than popularity, since the adversary can
easily keep the diameter of G from growing suspiciously.
First, it is easy for the adversary to bound the relative growth
of the diameter of G with respect to that of H: if S = H
and the adversary succeeds in inserting just one attack edge
the diameter can at most double. The following proposition
immediately follows [2]:
Proposition 2. A sybil attack can at most double the
diameter of H.
Second, it is easy for the adversary, who has full control
over S, to effect any change to the diameter slowly, so that it
appears completely physiological. Our experimental evalua−
tion of several real life social networks shows (90% diameter
column of Table I) that the 90%−effective diameter [16],
which measures the maximum distance between 90% of the
pair of nodes, is indeed barely affected under attack.
3) Clustering coefﬁcient: Leveraging the clustering co−
efﬁcient appears promising because attack edges reduce
its value. Unfortunately, while the clustering coefﬁcient of
social networks is typically high, its value varies signif−
icantly from network to network [17], from 0.79 in the
actor collaboration network of IMDB, down to 0.35 for Live
Journal and to a mere 0.09 for the social network of Yahoo!
Messenger chat exchanges. Thus, if an attack modiﬁes the
clustering coefﬁcient by a small multiplicative factor, the
change is hard to detect, especially if made very gradually.
We capture that intuition in the following result [2].
Theorem 1. Let H be the graph of honest nodes and let
G be the network under the sybil attack described in II-B.
Also, let α := 8(1 + 1
2 p)2, where p is the probability that an
attack edge is accepted. Then, c(G) ≥ α

Theorem 2. Let H denote a network of n honest nodes and
m edges such that ϕ(H)m = Ω(log n), and let S denote a
edges such that ϕ(S) ≥

ϕ(H) and ϕ(H)m ≤ m
(cid:4) ≤ m. Suppose further that the
−1
adversary is able to establish between ϕ(H)m log ϕ(H)
and m attack edges. Then, with high probability, ϕ(G) =
Ω(ϕ(H)).
The fundamental implication of the theorem is that if
the adversary is able to introduce at least ϕ(H)m log
ϕ(H)
attack edges (i.e., O(m) attack edges when the mixing time
is O(log n)), then the conductance of the graph will with
high probability remain very nearly the same.

Table I conﬁrms the theorem’s message that an adversary
that succeeds in generating sufﬁciently many attack edges
can circumvent any technique that attempts to detect sybil
nodes by looking for signiﬁcant changes in global con−
ductance. As expected, the conductance drops signiﬁcantly
under a weak attack (p = 0.01), providing leverage for sybil
detection. However, under a strong attack (p = 0.1) the con−
ductance may actually increase because, by adding random
attack edges, the adversary enlarges every cut with some
probability, including the cut with minimum conductance
which deﬁnes the conductance of the entire network.
Note that computing a graph’s conductance is NP−hard.
The conductance values that we report are approximate and
were obtained using the the approximation method proposed
by Leskovec et al. [17].
C. Discussion
None of the structural properties of social graphs that we
have considered provides full−proof defense against sybil
attacks in general, or even against the speciﬁc attack we
have assumed. However, as Table II shows, when a graph
under attack is observed through the lens of conductance, the
adversary has to work much harder to look inconspicuous.
These results both motivate and justify the insight of Yu
and his collaborators to rely on conductance in the work
that jump−started sybil defense via social networks [46]. We

III. LEVERAGING CONDUCTANCE TOWARDS UNIVERSAL
SYBIL DEFENSE
The vision behind the seminal work of Yu and his collab−
orators is to develop a decentralized approach to universal
sybil defense, with the goal of allowing honest users to
correctly assess with high probability the honesty of every
other user in the system. False positive and false negatives
would still be possible, but they would be few and, further,
their number would be bound within a rigorous theoretical
framework. This compelling vision, ﬁrst articulated in the
SybilGuard protocol [46], is further reﬁned in their later
work on SybilLimit [45] and has inspired several other
efforts in sybil defense [7], [10], [35], [42].
We begin this section by discussing the main intuition
underlying these techniques and the guarantees that they
provide; we then proceed to discuss the crucial role that
a set of key assumptions play in ensuring those guarantees
and present evidence suggesting that the assumptions do not
appear to hold in actual social graphs.
A. Picking whom to trust
In all these protocols, an honest node determines which
nodes to trust on the basis of a sample of the social graph
collected by using random walks. Different protocols apply
sampling in different ways and to different parts of the
graph. SybilLimit [46] samples edges; SybilGuard [45] and
Gatekeeper [35] sample nodes in the graph; SybilInfer [10]
uses the random walks to build a Bayesian model for
the likelihood that a trace T was initiated by an honest
node. In the following, we provide an overview of how
SybilLimit [46] applies the random sampling of edges to
identify honest users. While the details of the discussion are
speciﬁc to SybilLimit, the intuition for how the structural
properties of the graph make random sampling effective is
common to this entire family of protocols.
Let us consider a particularly simple version of the sybil
detection problem. We are given two disjoint graphs H and
S—the graph of honest and, respectively, sybil nodes; an
honest vertex u—the seed; and a vertex v. Our task is to
determine whether v belongs to H or to S. Both nodes select
an edge at random: u accepts v if they pick the same edge.
The probability of collision is very low, 1
m . To boost it
√
we can use the classic birthday paradox. Vertex u picks a
set Su of, say,
m distinct edges, while v picks a set Sv
m edges independently at random: now u accepts v if
of
there is a collision (i.e. Su ∩ Sv (cid:8)= ∅). This probability is
√
1 − Pr(no collision) = 1 −

a good probability of success. Note now that the set Su can
itself be picked at random. Since |Su| =
m (cid:11) m, almost
√
all edges will be distinct. This simple protocol succeeds
with good probability: each vertex picks a set of
m
edges independently and uniformly at random. If the two
sets intersect, then u accepts v, otherwise it does not. The
protocol is symmetric and can be used by both u and v
to determine whether to trust one another. This basic idea
can be further reﬁned to obtain a test that succeeds with
overwhelming probability with small−sized edge sets.
Suppose now we have two disjoint graphs and two ver−
tices: we want to determine whether or not they belong to
the same graph. If vertices are restricted to pick the edge set
from their own graph, the simple protocol above provides
the membership test we are looking for: if the two vertices
live in different graphs the chance that they trust each other
is zero, otherwise it is given by Equation (2).
the test
But how can we implement
in a distributed
fashion? A simple approach is to take a random walk in the
graph—which, in the interest of efﬁciency, should be very
short—and pick the last edge of the walk. This is a correct
implementation of the test as long as the short random walk
picks edges at random (i.e., every edge is equally likely to
be selected). It is here that the graph’s mixing time enters
the picture: it is the minimum length of a random walk
that selects edges in an unbiased way.3 Networks for which
random walks of length O(log n) are sufﬁcient (i.e., have
mixing time O(log n)) are said to be fast mixing.
Therefore, if we assume that the graph of honest nodes
is fast mixing, we have a very good protocol for sybil
detection, as long as H and S are disjoint. In reality,
however, H and S are connected through the attack edges
that nodes in S have convinced nodes in H to accept: it is
then possible that a random walk starting from v ∈ S will
traverse an attack edge, enter H, and pick one of the edges
selected by u ∈ H. The intuition is that, as long as the cut
between H and S is sparse, such situations are sufﬁciently
unlikely that
the mechanism continues to function with
good probability. Indeed, as we already mentioned, Yu et
