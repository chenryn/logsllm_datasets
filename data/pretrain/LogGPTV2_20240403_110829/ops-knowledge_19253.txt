**User:** I want to create an audio chat room on Google App Engine (GAE). Is there any framework that can help me achieve this? Thanks.

**Assistant:** 

Google App Engine (GAE) is primarily designed for handling web applications based on a request-response model, which makes it challenging to directly support real-time audio chat. However, you can still implement an audio chat feature by integrating GAE with other services and frameworks that are better suited for real-time communication.

Here are some options you might consider:

1. **WebSockets:**
   - **Socket.IO**: A popular JavaScript library that enables real-time, bidirectional, and event-based communication. You can use it in conjunction with a WebSocket server like `socket.io` or `WebSocket-Node`.
   - **Pusher**: A hosted service that provides a simple API for real-time data streaming and WebSockets. It supports various platforms and languages.

2. **Serverless Functions:**
   - **Cloud Functions for Firebase**: You can use Cloud Functions to handle the backend logic and Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore to manage the state and signaling.
   - **AWS Lambda and API Gateway**: Another option is to use AWS Lambda for serverless computing and API Gateway for managing WebSocket connections.

3. **Third-Party Services:**
   - **Agora.io**: A platform that provides SDKs for real-time voice and video communication. It can be integrated into your GAE application.
   - **Twilio**: Offers programmable voice and video APIs that can be used to build real-time communication features.

To get started, you can choose one of these solutions and integrate it with your GAE application. For example, you can use GAE to handle the main application logic and user authentication, while using a WebSocket server or a third-party service to manage the real-time audio chat.

If you need more specific guidance on how to integrate these services, feel free to ask!
