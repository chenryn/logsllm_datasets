User: I am attempting to install ipython notebook based on some instructions. However, while I tried to execute this 'In your favorite editor, open the file $HOME/.ipython/profile_default/ipython_notebook_config.py', I can't really open a file from TextWrangler. I am not familiar with this. Could anyone help me out there? Thank you very much!!
Assistant: maybe it's not there? you can create it first, in Mac's terminal
touch $HOME/.ipython/profile_default/ipython_notebook_config.py
and then open it in TextWranggler
open -a /Applications/TextWrangler.app $HOME/.ipython/profile_default/ipython_notebook_config.py
