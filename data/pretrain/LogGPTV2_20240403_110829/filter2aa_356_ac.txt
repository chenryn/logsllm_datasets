circuit and is more likely you can do a platter swap to a good drive, or replace the head 
stack assembly. The voice coil was mentioned in previous information at Defcon 14. 
Click of Death and Hard Drives Safe Mode Notes 
Errors cause the drive to constantly shutdown and recalibrate, this 
is a sound or movement that can usually be heard or seen and is 
known as the Click of Death for hard drives. If drive parts are good 
then rewriting the SA area is the part that needs repairing. The 
difficultly is in knowing if the rest of the parts are good. The SA can 
only be rewritten by a few devices. There are a few ways to get 
around this; one of the ways is a live PCB swap. Again the SA is 
not accessible over the interface without special tools. 
Most hard drives have a specific recalibration routine they use to 
retry the SA area. Even though it cannot be read most drives will 
continue this routine.  A few drives will, after a certain number of 
times automatically power down.  The normal timing routine for this 
process is: 
• Two head clicks 
• power down  
• two head clicks again 
** Some drives will perform three head clicks before powering down. 
Maxtor drives will test all heads from 0 to F; it must come out to 
level F, or stop the spindle. The problem of Quantum drives of all 
series (including last series — known as Maxtor D540X and 
D740X) can be detected by the specific sounds: after starting, 
there will be two loud clicks, then drive’s motor will increase its 
speed, and there will be 4 more clicks, after which the drive will 
become “ready”. For Western Digital a dead preamplifier is also 
detected by the specific sounds: after two loud clicks the drive will 
stop the spindle. If you have a clicking Maxtor then heads 
malfunctioning is characterized with a continuous clicking for over 
30 seconds. Samsung drives with a dead preamplifier also click 
two times and then stop the spindle; however, for Samsung drives 
it can also mean problems with reading of the critical modules of 
the system area.

Can be done by setting jumpers in case a module is damaged or 
some drives can detect it and go into safe mode itself. In safe 
mode the drive bypasses its own firmware and is waiting for 
firmware to be uploaded to ram. The RAM code is called the loader 
and will start the drive operations. It is possible for the hard drive to 
go into safe mode all by itself if it detects a problem. You will never 
know this is happening on purpose. Some software like MHDD 
might be able to tell you if your drive is in safe mode. You will 
never be able to recover data until this problem is solved and it is 
not running in safe mode. When it is running in safe mode it will 
sound like the Click of Death on most hard drives. 
Diagnostic software called MHDD or Victoria 
http://hddguru.com/content/en/software/2005.10.02-MHDD/ 
MHDD Software commands and functions: 
• Erase Waits:- It is better to use this for Drive Repair but it is 
data destructive 
• HPA :- Host Protected Area Functions 
• REMAP: - Try to recover bad sectors 
• Standby: - turn the motor off 
• PWD: - User Password INFO 
• Dispwd: - disable the password 
• Fdisk: can make one full size fat 32 drive 
Slide 3791: The cause of the click is from four possible areas, all resulting in the SA not 
being able to be read. 
1. System Area of the drive cannot be read because the platter is scratched.  
2. The head itself has a problem and cannot read the SA area. 
3. Preamp on Actuator to the Head has gone bad and is not passing the correct 
signal to the electronics 
4. The firmware on the board is damaged and does not initialize. This is 
sometimes caused by static electricity walking across the carpet to install the 
drives, or there is a short on the board, and additionally I see where someone 
has allowed the board on the bottom of the drive to touch metal cause it to burn. 
All will result in the same problem and will sound like the Click of Death. Recovery 
Software will not help you correct any of these until after you have repaired the drive 
and it is running again.

Data Recovery Whitepaper – Rev 17                                                                                                   Page 13 of 22 
Now we move on to some of the things you can do about it on your own.  The click of 
death is a very difficult problem to solve and in some cases will not be able to be solved 
especially without some very high end and expensive equipment. But I will tell you what 
I have been able to fix without that equipment. 
Slide 4009: Swapping the PCB (printed circuit board) Live to get around a SA area that 
cannot be read. 
I have done this process several times successfully. It is not perfect but it is a possible 
chance you will have to recover your data. The first step is to get a hard drive as close 
to identical as the bad drive you have that is a working drive. At the bottom of this paper 
you will find help about matching hard drives and serial numbers. If the System Area is 
badly damaged or corrupt and for some reason the drive will not read the System Area 
you can attempt to do a live swap. What this means is that you can hook up the good 
drive, then you use software or windows and tell the drive to go to sleep.  This will 
cause the drive to spin down but will still be live and powered up and mounted.  Once 
the drive goes to sleep and the drive stops spinning you can unscrew the board, 
carefully so as not to let the screws roll around on the board, and disconnect the board 
and connect it to the bad drive. I suggest that once you do this, you go after the files you 
need very quickly. It’s possibly you will be able to make an image of the drive.  Keep in 
mind, that whatever bad blocks that the drive had assigned to the other drive will be bad 
here as well.  You could try to use some software to clear bad blocks before attempting 
this, however I don’t suggest it in most cases. That is because it is one more possible 
item that might cause failure. I would prefer to use the drive that was working and lose a 
few blocks. After you get what you can then you can attempt to make changes and go 
back for more data. This is a concept that works about 25% of the time. 
Slide 4199: Imaging in Reverse 
In dealing with damaged hard drives, I have run into many problems with cache memory 
on the drive. The problems will often show up as timeouts or ECC failures as well. For 
example, I try to read from a drive with16 megs of ram for cache and receive errors but 
the drive is otherwise appears ok. If there is an error 16 megs away from the sector I am 
reading my drive will die. As of now there is no way to turn off this cache.  However, if 
you can image your drive backwards there is no cache. Memory on a drive only caches 
data forward. There are only three ways I know of to image a drive backwards. The first 
is free, and it is to use dd_rescue. dd_rescue has a special setting for imaging a drive 
backwards. There is also a special script for dd_rhelp to control dd_rescue for the 
purpose of data recovery. You can use this on Linux and it works on drives regardless 
of the operating system on the drive you are recovering from. Typically you will start at 
the MaxLBA number and work backwards down to 0 LBA. It works quite well and will 
work on a surprising number of drives that cannot be read any other way. Your other 
two choices are Media Tools Pro from RecoverSoft (http://www.recoversoft.com/) for 
Windows, which is about $400, or a piece of hardware which is extremely efficient at 
doing this type of recovery called Deepspar Disk Imager

(http://www.deepspar.com/products-ds-disk-imager.html), which will cost between 
$3000 and $4000 depending on configuration. But you should contact each of these 
vendors for pricing, or use the free option! 
Slide 4259: Head Replacement Section 
This is the only section from last year I kept and it is because this is directly related to 
fixing this click of death problem.  NOTE: If there is only one platter it might be easier to 
move the platter than to move the assembly. You have to make that choice. 
List of items needed: 
1. The first step is to get a hard drive as close to identical as the bad drive you have 
that is a working drive. At the bottom of this paper you will find help about 
matching hard drives and serial numbers.  
2. You need a clean area to work on with as little dust floating around as possible. 
3. You will need about 3 hours to do this carefully  
4. A screwdriver set with T3-T8.  These are my favorite 
http://www.wihatools.com/200seri/278serie.htm 
5. Post-it Notes 
6. Other tools depending on the drive 
7. Patience 
Process for Head Replacement: 
1. You will need to disassemble the heads and other components from the drive to 
clear the room for the head and components.   
2. Disassemble the new hard drive, and carefully use folded paper to move the 
heads apart and to keep them apart as much as possible. 
NOTE: 
If you are going to move the heads off of a drive platter you should 
always spin the motor in the direction away from the heads and the 
arm while you are moving the actuator arm to get the heads off. 
Move with care.  
If you are storing the heads or going to put them down, you can try 
cutting sections of a drinking straw around the head itself. If the 
drive has a ramp it is very useful to help line up the heads to take 
them off and to put them back on. 
*** There is often a screw under the assembly of the actuator arm

that needs to be removed to move the heads. 
3. Carefully lift the assembly out of the drive and move it to the bad drive and 
reassemble. It will take about two hours to assemble correctly if you take your time. 
Do everything you can to get the heads lined up again. 
NOTE: 
It is helpful to fold a piece of post-it notes in a V shape and to make 
the V towards the platters and the heads on each side of the V.  You 
can get the paper to slide onto the platter and turn the platters with a 
screwdriver while you gently move the heads back into place. 
You must get them lined up and review it before you turn the drive back on or the heads 
may slide into place and hit the edge of the platter ripping them off and scratching the 
platter.  It is good to practice with another drive you do not care about before doing this.  
Slide 4500:  Doing a Platter Swap for a Single Platter 
List of items needed: 
1. The first step is to get a hard drive as close to identical as the bad drive you have 
that is a working drive. At the bottom of this paper you will find help about 
matching hard drives and serial numbers.  
2. You need a clean area to work on with as little dust floating around as possible. 
3. You will need about 1 hour to do this carefully  
4. A screwdriver set with T3-T8.  These are my favorite 
http://www.wihatools.com/200seri/278serie.htm 
5. Post-it Notes 
6. Other tools depending on the drive 
7. Anti-Static Gloves ($5 at the local store) 
8. Patience 
1. Just move the head as careful as you can to get it out of the way  
NOTE: 
This is a fairly simple task compared to a head swap. The 
hardest part is again getting the heads aligned and back on 
the platter correctly.  
If you have a ramp on your drive it is fairly simple to get the 
head moved out of the way enough to get the platter in 
position.

2.  Remove the platter from the good drive.  
NOTE: 
I usually will try to put a screwdriver in the shaft just to the edge
