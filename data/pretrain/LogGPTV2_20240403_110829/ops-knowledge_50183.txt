User: I have a simple pyparsing construct for extracting parts of a log message. It looks like this
log_line = timestamp + task_info + Suppress(LineEnd())
This construct parses a log file generated in Linux very well but doesn't parse a similar file generated in windows. I am pretty sure it is because of the new line representation difference. I was wondering if LineEnd() takes care of that? If it doesn't how do I take care of it?
Assistant: Try Suppress("\r\n") instead of Suppress(LineEnd())
