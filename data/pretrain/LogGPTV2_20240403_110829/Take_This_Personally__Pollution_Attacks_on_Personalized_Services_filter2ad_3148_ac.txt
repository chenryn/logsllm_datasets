Figure 7: Promotion rates of promoted Google search rankings for successful contextual history pollution attacks.
4.5.3 Real Users
We also evaluate the effectiveness of pollution attacks
on ten volunteers’ accounts with extensive pre-existing
search histories. We ﬁnd that, on average, 97.1% of our
729 previously successful contextual attacks remain suc-
cessful, while only 77.78% of the persistent pollution at-
tacks that work on fresh accounts achieve similar suc-
cess. We believe that users’ search histories sometimes
interfere with the attacks, and that user history inter-
feres more with the attacks on persistent personalization.
Contextualized attacks rely only on a small set of re-
cent search terms to alter the personalized search results,
which is unlikely to be affected by a user’s search history.
In contrast, pollution attacks against persistent personal-
ization rely on more of a user’s search history. If relevant
keywords are already present in a user’s search history,
keyword pollution may be less effective. In any event,
both attacks are relatively robust, even when launched
against users with long search histories.
5 Pollution Attacks on Amazon
Of the three services, Amazon’s personalization is per-
haps the most evident to the end user. On one hand, this
makes pollution-based attacks less insidious, as they will
be visible to the observant user. On the other, of the three
services, Amazon has the most direct monetization path,
since users may directly purchase the goods from Ama-
zon. Therefore, exploitation of Amazon’s personaliza-
tion may be proﬁtable to an enterprising attacker.
Amazon tailors a customer’s homepage based on the
previous purchase, browsing and searching behavior of
the user. Amazon product recommendations consider
each of these three activities individually and explicitly
labels its recommendations according to the aspect of the
user’s history it used to generate them. We focused on the
personalized recommendations Amazon generates based
on the browsing and searching activities of a customer
because manipulating the previous purchase history of a
customer may have unintended consequences.
5.1 Amazon Recommendations
Amazon displays ﬁve recommendation lists on a cus-
tomer’s homepage that are ostensibly computed based on
the customer’s searching and browsing history. Four of
these lists are derived from the products that the customer
has recently viewed (view-based recommendation); the
ﬁfth is based on the latest search term the customer en-
tered (search-based recommendation). For each of the
view-based recommendation lists, Amazon uses relation-
ships between products that are purchased together to
compute the corresponding recommended products; this
concept is similar to the co-visitation relationship that
YouTube uses to promote videos. For the recommenda-
tion list that is computed based on the latest search term
of a customer, the recommended products are the top-
ranked results for the latest search term.
In contrast to the types of personalization used for
YouTube and Google Search, Amazon’s personalization
is based on history that maintained by the user’s web
browser, not by the service. Because customers fre-
quently brows Amazon without being signed in, both the
