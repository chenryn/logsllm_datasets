**Current behavior**  
Returning `false` on CanDeactivate implementation influences browser history.  
Seems to be leftover from #10321 and #12825
**Expected behavior**  
Returning `false` on CanDeactivate implementation does not influence browser
history.
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**  
Present in Angular Routing Demo plnkr:  
https://angular.io/resources/live-examples/router/ts/eplnkr.html
_STEPS TO REPRODUCE_ :
  1. Click "Crisis Center"
  2. Click Crisis Center 1, then 2, then 3
  3. Edit Crisis Center 3's "Name" in its details
  4. Press browser "Back" button, and press "Cancel" when confirm dialog pops up asking if you want to discard changes
  5. Press browser "Back" button again, but this time press "OK" when confirm dialog pops up asking if you want to discard changes
  6. _RESULT:_  
You are taken back to Crisis Center 1 detail view instead of Crisis Center 2.
If you press browser "Forward" button twice, you'll notice that both times you
are taken to Crisis Center 3 detail view. The Crisis Center 3 detail view has
essentially replaced the Crisis Center 2 detail view history entry.
**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**  
I press my browser's "Back" button but then choose to cancel navigation in
order to first save pending changes. When I press my browser's "Back" button
again, I should navigate to the previous page as if this was the first time I
pressed my browser's "Back" button.
