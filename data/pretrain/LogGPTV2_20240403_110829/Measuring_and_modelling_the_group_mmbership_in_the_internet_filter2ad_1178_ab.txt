of game servers. Some game servers offer a querying mechanism,
which can retrieve some speciﬁc information, such as the number
of players, players’ nicknames, IP addresses, and scores, and the
time that each player has been connected, etc. To analyze cluster-
ing of members, we need members’ IP addresses (the reason will
be clariﬁed in Section 4.2). Not all games, however, provide play-
ers’ IP addresses. Quake I is one of the fewer games that allow
this. Thus, we choose Quake I though it is a little bit old game.
Using QStat, we measured 70 Quake game servers (obtained from
a master server) for ﬁve days (across a weekend), and the servers
are polled every one minute. We select the 10 most popular servers
(5 of them providing IP addresses of players) for our analysis, and
the selected game servers are illustrated in Table 3.
From each data set of MBONE and net games (note that, one
data set corresponds to one multicast session or group), we sample
the group membership at regular interval (1 minute). Each sample
of group membership is composed of members with IP address or
player ID for some net games data sets (in which IP address of play-
ers are not provided). To give some intuition of the data sets, we
plot some examples chosen from real MBONE data and net games
data in Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3, and Fig. 4. In all these ﬁgures, the
X-axis is the time, and the Y-axis represents the number of mem-
bers (receivers for MBONE or players for net games). We can see
clearly how the number of members changes with the time.

MBONE multicast: decelerating increase and “black-out”
phases. In Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, we see that the IETF broadcast in-
creases close to monotonically but with decreasing rate of increase.
We also notice some short periods (there is also a big period for
IETF Video) in which the number of members drop suddenly and
then rise again. One possible explanation is the network instabil-
ity: either the tree was torn down and rebuilt or the measurements
got lost. Another possible reason is that these might correspond to
breaks of the IETF meeting, such as lunch time. Fig. 3 shows the
sampled data sets for NASA broadcast. We see that NASA broad-
cast has smaller number of drop periods than IETF broadcast. One
reason to explain this is that, unlike IETF meeting, NASA shuttle
lunch is a more continuous event. The big drop period can be ex-
plained by some break of network connection or some unexpected
and uninteresting event.
Net games: membership is strongly periodic. Fig. 4 shows
in each
very interesting behavior of net games (Quake) players:
day, there is a big spike in user participation. Moreover, there are
more players during the weekend (May 17th and May 18th). This
periodicity is natural given the nature of the activity: For a game
server, due to the delay constraints of gaming, most of the players
come from areas within some range (say, in several hops). Thus
the players are more likely active in some relatively ﬁxed period of
time in a day. For example, in Fig. 4, we see that late night is a very
active period for game players in this server.

In the rest of this section, we examine membership properties of
the above data.
4.2 Member Clustering
To model member clustering, we employ network-aware cluster-
ing. Intuitively, two members should be in the same cluster if they
are close in terms of network routing. In the Internet, this kind of
grouping can be done based on IP addresses. We adopt the method
in [16] to identify member clusters using network preﬁxes, based
on information available from BGP routing snapshots (we use the
BGP dump tables obtained from [2]). This way, clustered nodes are
likely to to be under common administrative control. For details,
please see [16].
We brieﬂy outline network-aware clustering for completeness.
We ﬁrst extract the network preﬁxes/netmasks from BGP dump
tables and the IP addresses of members from group membership
samples, then we classify all the member IP addresses that have
the same longest-match preﬁx into one cluster, which is identi-

ﬁed by the shared preﬁx. For example, suppose we want to clus-
ter the IP addresses 216.123.0.1, 216.123.1.5, 216.123.16.59, and
216.123.51.87. In the routing table, we ﬁnd the longest-match pre-
ﬁxes are 216.123.0.0/19, 216.123.0.0/19, 216.123.0.0/19, and
216.123.48.0/21 respectively. Then we can classify the ﬁrst three

and the last one into another cluster identiﬁed by 216.123.48.0/21.
It should be to noted that other clustering methods, such as network
topology based approach, are possible. But network-aware cluster-
ing is an easy and effective way for us to do clustering considering
the data we have achieved. In later sections, we will show that our
analysis and model are not constrained by the clustering method.
For each data set, we want to see the number of group mem-
bers per cluster. Here, we refer to the number of group members
in a cluster as the size of the cluster (or cluster size). For all the
group membership samples, we examine the Cumulative Distribu-
tion Function (CDF) of the cluster size. The results for data sets
from MBONE and net games are shown in Fig. 5. Therefore, for a
given cluster size in the X-axis, we see how many clusters have at
most that size.
Figure 5: CDF of cluster size for data sets from MBONE and
net games. The upper set of curves are for net game data sets
(with 5 game servers providing IP addresses of players), the
middle set of curves are for MBONE real data sets (IETF43-
A, IETF43-A, and NASA), and the lower set of curves are for
MBONE cumulative data sets.
Group members form clusters with skewed size distribution.
Group members are signiﬁcantly clustered. In Fig. 5, we can see
three different groups of curves: the upper group for net game data
sets (with 5 game servers providing IP addresses of players), the
middle group for MBONE real data sets (IETF43-A, IETF43-A,
and NASA), and the lower group for MBONE cumulative data sets.
In each group, the data sets have similar member clustering prop-
erty: for example, for MBONE real data sets, more than 20% clus-
ters have 2 or more group members; for MBONE cumulative data
sets (UCSB-2000, UCSB-2001, Gatech-2001 and UOregon-2001),
they also have similar features: more than 60% clusters have 2
or more group members; while for net games, the corresponding
group of CDF curves do not show signiﬁcant member clustering:
about 90% “clusters” have size 1.
Cluster size distribution is mainly affected by the group size.
We observe that it is primarily the size of the group that affects
the range of the distribution. However, the cluster size distribu-
tion is similar qualitatively in all three groups of data sets. When
comparing the groups of curves, we can conclude that the MBONE
cumulative data sets have more signiﬁcant clustering feature than
MBONE real data sets. We attribute this to the larger size of the
group. The average number of members for each cumulative data
set (from 500 to 1000) is much higher than that for real data sets
(around 50). The bigger the group is, the more members tend to
be in one cluster and the more signiﬁcant of the member clustering
feature is. As for net games, the feature of member clustering is
even less signiﬁcant: most “clusters” have only one member, which
means that Quake players are more likely scattered over the net-
work. This observation suggests that probably the gain from some
multicast or intelligent caching schemes may not provide signiﬁ-
cant beneﬁts in this case.
The absence of clustering in the net games can be attributed to
many factors. One observation is that the maximum number of
players (16 in Quake) is controlled by the game servers because
of management issues. Thus, the possibility for the members to
fall in one cluster becomes smaller. It would be very interesting to
examine a net game with a larger user participation, but we were
not able to get such data. Another possible explanation may be
that the game players are not necessarily from a similar area of the
network potentially. This suggests that gaming community is scat-
tered, or alternatively, that net games bring together people from
signiﬁcantly different places.
The practical implications of member clustering. Understand-
ing the clustering properties can help us develop efﬁcient protocols
to improve the scalability and the performance of applications. The
member clustering captures the proximity of the members in the
network especially with the use of network-aware clustering. For
example, in a well clustered group, we can potentially develop hi-
erarchical protocols that can exploit the spatial distribution of the
members like hierarchical multicasting.
4.3 Group Participation Probability
We ﬁnd that the participation probability is non-uniform across
clusters or nodes. This strongly suggests that the uniform distri-
bution used so far for most research is not realistic. In the analysis
below, we study the distribution across clusters or nodes that par-
ticipate at least once in a multicast group. Clearly, there are clusters
or nodes in the network that do not appear in any group. In fact, we
expect that these clusters (or nodes) are probably large in number,
which reinforces the observation that not all clusters (or nodes) are
created equal regarding multicast participation.
Note that, given the limited number of groups, we measured the
time-based participation probability as deﬁned in the previous sec-
tion.
We give the CDF of the participation probability of clusters or
nodes for MBONE and net games in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 respectively.
Given a probability in the X-axis, we can see how many clusters or
nodes have at most that probability to participate in the multicast
group.
MBONE: the cluster participation probability is non-uniform.
In Fig. 6, we see that the MBONE clusters are not equal in partic-
ipating in a group. If the clusters had the same probability p of
participating in a group, the CDF of the participation probability
would appear as a vertical line at the exact p on the X-axis. The
current plot of the CDF shows a roughly linear increase with close
to 45 degrees slope. This suggests that we have a wide range of
participation probabilities: for any value on the X-axis, we can ﬁnd
a cluster with such a participation probability.
Net Games: the node participation probability roughly fol-
lows uniform distribution. For net games, since the member clus-
tering feature is not signiﬁcant at all (about 90% “clusters” have
size 1), we simply analyze the node participation probability which
is approximated by the frequency of nodes joining the net game
session.
Fig. 7 plots the CDF of the participation probability for net games.
We observe that the plot is qualitatively different from the MBONE
distribution. For all the Quake servers we examined, more than

the X-axis, we know how many pairs of clusters or nodes have at
most that correlation coefﬁcient in multicast participation.

data sets from MBONE (only real data).
Figure 8: CDF of the correlation coefﬁcient of clusters for data
sets from MBONE (real data).
Figure 7: CDF of the participation probability of nodes for data
sets from net games (including 10 data sets).
95% of nodes only have participation probability less than 0.1%.
We can say the uniformly random group membership model is suf-
ﬁciently realistic for net games (Quake). Interestingly, this suggests
that user participation is approximately equally distributed, and we
do not ﬁnd players that would always join a game server. This is
consistent with our intuition: a player joins and leaves the game
at will and the player’s behavior is not heavily affected by other
factors as in applications on MBONE, such as IETF43 and NASA,
where the delivery content does inﬂuence the behavior of members
