### Block Page Detection and Clustering

#### Methodology
Our approach involves matching web pages to a block page template. While this method may not capture all block page templates, it is sufficient for our evaluation, which uses precision and recall metrics. The evaluation focuses on how well the clustering identifies known templates. Our method may also discover new templates, but we do not evaluate the quality of these clusters.

#### Evaluation Metrics
To assess the quality of each clustering, we computed the F-1 measure, a common metric that equally combines precision and recall:
\[ \text{F-1} = \frac{2 \cdot \text{precision} \cdot \text{recall}}{\text{precision} + \text{recall}} \]

We calculated the overall F-1 measure by summing the maximum F-measure for each subsequence:
\[ \sum_{i \in \text{clusters}} \frac{n_i}{N} \cdot \max_{j \in \text{subsequences}} \{ f(i, j) \} \]
where \( N \) is the total number of block pages, \( n_i \) is the number of block pages in the \( i \)-th cluster, and \( f(i, j) \) is the F-measure for cluster \( i \) and subsequence \( j \).

By taking the maximum F-measure for each subsequence, we associate the block page template with the cluster that best matches the template. We then average the F-measures, weighted by the number of pages using that template. This ensures that an outcome with many small clusters (each with high F-measure) and one large cluster (with low F-measure) does not score well. The F-1 measure ranges from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating better precision and recall.

#### Results
- **Term Frequency Clustering**: F-1 measure of 0.98.
- **Page Length Clustering**: F-1 measure of 0.64.

Term frequency clustering performs well because block pages are generated from templates, sharing similar structures. Despite noise from mislabeled pages and HTTP error messages, term frequency clustering effectively identifies block page templates. Page length clustering, however, produces poor-quality clusters, as shown in Figure 5, where block pages have only a few distinct lengths.

#### Fingerprinting Filtering Tools
We label each cluster based on known signatures or manually identify the block page vendor. Using this method, we identified five filtering tools that generated seven out of 36 clusters in the dataset. Table 2 summarizes these results.

| Number of Clusters | Product Manufacturer | AS Number(s) | Time Frame | Fingerprint |
|--------------------|----------------------|--------------|------------|-------------|
| 2                  | FortiGuard           | AS 24090 (Malaysia) | 2009 | "Powered by FortiGuard" in block page text |
| 1                  | Squid Proxy Server   | AS 2609 (Tunisia) | 2010 | "Server: squid/2.6.STABLE16" in HTTP headers |
| 1                  | Netsweeper           | AS 12486 (US), AS 15802 (UAE), AS 12586 (Yemen) | 2010-2012 | "webadmin/deny" in URL |
| 1                  | Websense             | AS 29584 (Azerbaijan) | 2010 | Websense copyright disclaimer in HTML comments |
| 2                  | WireFilter           | AS 25019 (Saudi Arabia) | 2011 | "Server: Protected by WireFilter" in HTTP headers |

#### Case Studies
##### Political Shifts (Burma)
Analyzing changes in filtering mechanisms and block pages in Burma (Myanmar) provides insight into censorship evolution. Figure 6 shows the enforcement mechanisms and block page clusters used in AS 18399 between 2007 and 2012. Until mid-2009, AS 18399 used DNS redirection. In mid-2009, a custom block page template (vector 0) appeared, resolving 568 URLs to 659 IPs, indicating no DNS redirection. In late 2011, Burma reduced censorship, reflected in the lack of detected block pages.

##### New Filtering Tools (Saudi Arabia)
Figure 7 illustrates the shift in AS 25019, where a new filtering tool, WireFilter, began censoring content in 2011. WireFilter uses multiple block page templates concurrently, suggesting multiple devices in use.

##### Different Techniques in Different ISPs (Thailand)
Figure 8 shows that different ISPs in Thailand implement censorship differently. AS 9737 and AS 17552 use different filtering tools and mechanisms. AS 9737 switched from DNS redirection to a transparent proxy in 2010, while AS 17552 switched from DNS redirection to a new filtering tool in late 2009. Both ISPs obfuscate their filtering tools' identities using Apache server strings in HTTP headers.

#### Conclusion
We developed techniques for block page detection and filtering tool identification, achieving a 95.03% true positive rate and a 1.371% false positive rate. These methods significantly improve censorship measurement and set the stage for future advancements. Future work could include fingerprinting existing block page products to find more template matches.
