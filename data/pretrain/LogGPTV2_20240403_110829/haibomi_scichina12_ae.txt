How to select the most suitable values for the other factors has been well studied in their relevant research areas [13,35]. Here, we just use the recommended values for them.Table 2 summarizes the results of localizing the anomalous methods in different scenarios. 	From Table 2 we can see that about 30% requests will be discarded without adjusting clusters. It causes the high false-negative rate (in each case, the false-negative rate is above 20%). However, after merging the minor clusters into the major ones, the false-negative rate decreases obviously. For instance, in case 2, the false-negative rate decreases by 23.8%.Figure 7 shows the cumulative percent variance of components for the four scenarios. 	The top k components whose summed variance is larger than the threshold (i.e., 0.95) are considered as the principal components. From these principal components, we can extract the principal methods. The number of principal methods equals that of principal components.Figure 8 lists the suspicious scores of the principal methods for each scenario. All related method

names have been replaced by the numbers due to the confidentiality. For space consideration, we just list the dissimilarity ratios of the instances for the top one anomalous method in each scenario, as shown in Figure 9. The ratios have been ranked in a descending order.

Performance anomalies due to misconfigurations are frequently encountered in large scale systems like a production cloud. But they are very difficult to be troubleshot. It is hard to correlate the performance degradation to the relevant misconfigured parameters. This case reports how our approach helps engineers debug misconfiguration-related performance anomalies.In our target system, the distributed file system is built with Hadoop-like architecture. A mechanism is provided to merge small files into a bigger one in case of excessively accessing disks. In our experiment, we disable this merging mechanism through setting the relevant parameter of the configuration file to be OFF. Therefore, the meta data of users increases over time, which causes the response latency of the ListFile to rise significantly. We try to validate whether our approach can localize the method of reading user meta data that correlates with this performance degradation.Figure 7(a) shows that there are four major clusters in this case. In each cluster, the summed variance of the first three principal components captures more than 0.95 of variance in the data. Therefore, for each major cluster, about four principal methods are picked out. The suspicious scores of the top four principal methods are listed in Figure 8(a). The top one method is used to fetch the user meta data. Its suspicious score is four, which means that it is considered to be suspicious in each major cluster. The experimental results confirm that our approach localizes the anomalous method precisely. Furthermore, the dissimilarity ratios of instances for the top one anomalous method are shown in Figure 9(a). We can see that there are three instances whose behavior are significantly different from others. In other words, the behavior of the top one method manifests to be anomalous in these three replicated instances. It gives operators very meaningful clues to diagnose the problems more effectively.

operators have to check all corresponding instances, which will suffer poor efficiency.
	As is shown in Table 2, the number of principal methods takes up only 4.1% of the total invoked methods, which sharply decreases the localization scopes. 	Without adjusting the clusters, the false-negative rate and false-positive rate are 26.1% and 2.7% respectively; however, after merging the minor clusters into the major ones, the false-negative rate decreases to 5.9% and the false-positive rate declines to 2.1%.7.2 	Case scenario 2
In large-scale cloud computing systems, component failures are the norm rather than the exception [37]. In case of service inaccessibility, the distributed platform provides a failover mechanism to recovery the killed instances. It will influence the system performance during the recovering process. In our experiment, we manually kill one fourth of chunk-server service instances that store files into disks. Then, the response latencies of most SaveFile operations clearly increase. We try to check whether our approach can detect the methods that reflect the recovery process.As is shown in Figure 7(b), about three to five principal methods can be picked out from more than one hundred of methods for each major cluster. There are in total eight different principal methods and Figure 8(b) lists the suspicious scores of the top six methods. The top three methods have direct relationship with chunk server services. Because the rest chunk server instances suffer more load pressures than before, excessive writing requests cannot be handled in time. Our approach finds out that these methods play a major role in the performance degradation for the SaveFile. The scores of the right three methods all equal one, which are the false-positives of our approach. Figure 9(b) lists the dissimilarity ratios of instances for the top one anomalous method. Among them, the first two instances are the most questionable because they suffer more accesses; thus our approach helps operators narrow down the localization scope effectively.The quantitative results are shown in Table 2.
