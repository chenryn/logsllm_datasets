User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题problems configuring Filezilla ftp server on windows azure virtual machine Recently I've been attempting to setup a filezilla server on one of azure virtual machines and cannot seem to get it fully running. I am currently able to get an initial connection, however subsequent data connections (i.e. for listing remote directories, file transfers etc..) always fail. I have tried following the advice on various blogs like this one:

http://www.bradmcallister.com/posts/how-to-use-filezilla-ftp-server-with-windows-azure-virtual-machines/

however I still get the same results.

Azure manager settings

unfortuantely I don't have enough reputation to post pictures of the configuration, so I will try my best to describe them.

for the server I have 2 Endpoints open for ftp.


TCP public port: 21, private port: 21
TCP public port: 65100, private port: 65100


General server settings

For the purpose of eliminating potential sources of errors I have temporarily turned off windows firewall on the server, so that should not affect the results that I'm seeing here.

FileZilla PASV settings


use custom port range checked. range used was 65100 - 65100
use the following IP checked, with the public virtual IP (VIP) Address from the azure dashboard.
Don't use external IP for local connections unchecked

Assistant: Managed to finally figure this out after a lot of head scratching. Turns out that azure has implemented a probing of sorts on ports opened using the manager. deleting the passive ports created there and opening them up using powershell allowed this to work.

Here's a good article describing the process: http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsazure/en-US/8f697f17-72b7-46f7-8c97-398b91190a2f/server-2012-vm-on-azure-passive-ftp-wont-work
