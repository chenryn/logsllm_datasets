Corporate Personality Testing

•Now corporate types seem to love personality testing. Infact Myers Briggs assessments are almost ubiquitous in corporations
•Anecdotally at least, many of the corporate types administering the tests on their staff really donʼt seem to understand it, itʼs real value and itʼs limitations
•Itʼs important to stress that itʼs not worthless, but that it can be very dangerous when used in the wrong contexts without an understanding of the limitations.

•Well, now with the advent of mass social network use, blogging etc (almost 1 in 12 people around the world are on Facebook) itʼs unsurprising to see these same corporates (and 
other organizations), turn to cyber vetting
•They look at your Online Reputation or NetRep to determine if youʼd be a good choice or a bad one. Often this is something a hiring manager would do themselves, whether itʼs illegal 
or note. 
•but now weʼre seeing companies like this spring up.

•Actually, and itʼs important to stress this. I kind of like this company for a number of reasons. 
•If youʼre going to have someone look at your NetRep, Iʼd say itʼs better that a company like this do it in a controlled manner following strict guidelines.  If you want to see what they do, 
thereʼs a great Gizmodo article.
•But, the point here is. Companies can look at your online reputation today.  Itʼs not entirely clear whether thereʼs a ﬁrm scientiﬁc basis for this, i.e. are we measuring the right variables 
and measuring them consistently? Given what I know about social intelligence, I suspect theyʼre on the money of what makes someone look more or less desirable.

• You see,  our handy app asks for A LOT of information.
•This, for example, is Farmville. People complain about apps like this and yet it asks little (compared to us) .
•By the way. other online personality studies also grab the same data as Farmville, thatʼs what differentiates our work from theirs. We look at more, although thats not to discredit their 
work (as weʼll show).  
•As a side note, the more access you request, the less likely it is for people to install your app.

• Tweeting and re-tweeting.
• Adding information on our project to Digg and Reddit and ﬁnally, the most successful approach
•Flyer distribution and talking to people....Over 5,000 ﬂyers. We really targets Chineham in the UK and Boise, Idaho in the USA.
•And with that, we ended up with a lot of data. Data from 537 participants.  but we had a problem. While we know a bit about statistics, weʼre not experts...so we quickly recruited one, 
gave her our data set and asked her to “ﬁgure it out” :-)

•Tell a little bit about what I did with the data, the decisions we made along the way, let you know some of our results and then talk a little bit about what this actually means in the real 
world.
•In performing this study, the ﬁrst thing we had to do was come up with some hypotheses about what we thought the data might show us. Our null hypothesis was that there was no 
relationship between a personʼs personality type, their concerns over privacy issues and their Facebook activity. Our alternative hypothesis was that there was a relationship between 
these variables.
•The ﬁrst thing I had to do is familiarise myself with the data – if you donʼt know your data, you canʼt hope to analyse it properly. The ﬁrst thing I did was to look at the demographics of 
the data and take a look at the age, sex and location of our participants.

•Over 2/3 of our participants were female, which differs from the sex split of the Facebook population, however, this may reﬂect higher tendencies in females to volunteer their time in 
studies such as these. This 2:1 ratio has also been noted in other studies of personality and online media. 
•The greatest proportion were in the 20 – 29 age group, and the overall age distribution of our sample is pretty representative of the underlying age distribution of all Facebook users.

•Before I go on, Iʼm going to have to do a little housekeeping. Much of what I will be talking about refers to the Normal Distribution, so Iʼm just going to give a brief overview of what is 
meant by this. Iʼm sure many of you know this already, so my apologies, but if you donʼt get this, you wonʼt have a clue what Iʼm talking about for the next 5 minutes.
•The normal distribution is pattern for the distribution of a set of data which follows this bell shaped curve. Many variables follow this pattern, for example, height, weight, IQ score – 
they all follow this distribution.  
•For a normal distribution, the mean, mode and median for the normal distribution are all the same - in the case of IQ, they are all 100 - the value in the centre of the bell curve. 
•A measure called the standard deviation is used to measure the spread of values across the bell curve. So, in terms of IQ, for example, about 68% of people will have an IQ level 
within 1 standard deviation above or below the mean, 95% of people will have an IQ that is within 2 standard deviations above or below the mean and 99% of people will have an IQ
