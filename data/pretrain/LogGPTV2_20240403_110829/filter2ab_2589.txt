# Title: EU-19 Bring Your Own Token (BYOT) to Replace Traditional Smartcards for Strong Authentication and Signing

Smartcards have long been a reliable method for enabling strong authentication to enterprise networks and applications. They provide identification, authentication, and the ability to store cryptographic key information on the card using an embedded microchip and memory. Enterprises can provision these smartcards with a digital identity, typically in the form of an X.509 certificate uniquely associated with a user, to facilitate smartcard logon to servers and Mutual TLS Authentication for services.

Traditionally, hybrid cards that combine both proximity and smartcard functionalities have been used. This allows users to carry a single card for both physical access to facilities and strong authentication to IT servers and applications. However, this approach has several limitations and challenges.

One significant challenge is the provisioning process. Proximity cards can be pre-provisioned in bulk, as the association between the user's identity and the proximity ID can be done after the card is assigned to a user. In contrast, the X.509 certificates provisioned to smartcards must contain user-specific information at the time of provisioning, which slows down the process. Additionally, issuing replacement or temporary cards for lost or misplaced cards can be cumbersome and time-consuming.

This whitepaper outlines the solution implemented at Cisco to address these limitations by replacing traditional hybrid smartcards with a Bring Your Own Token (BYOT) model. The BYOT solution enables users to bring their own USB tokens that are compatible with Personal Identity Verification (PIV) and Chip Card Interface Device (CCID) standards. Users can then self-provision the digital identities needed for strong authentication, signing, and other cryptographic functions. This approach not only streamlines the provisioning process but also enhances the overall security and flexibility of the authentication system.
