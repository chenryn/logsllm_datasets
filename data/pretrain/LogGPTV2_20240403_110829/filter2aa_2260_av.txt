Existing regional SOPs were 
reviewed and included in the 
TICP, and are in use by 
included agencies. NIMS-
compliant command and 
control has been instituted by 
all agencies and disciplines in 
the region. Despite minor 
issues, all SOPs were 
successfully demonstrated 
during exercise(s).
Some existing SOPs were 
incorporated in the TICP and

Alabama designated the City of Birmingham as its metropolitan area (area), which includes Calhoun, Clay, 
Cleburne, Etowah, Jefferson, St. Clair, and Talladega counties.  Major cities located within this area include 
Birmingham, Anniston, Gadsden, Pell City and Talladega.  
Governance: Intermediate Implementation

Birmingham as a whole has developed a fairly robust governance structure for the support of its 
communications interoperability.  There are multiple governing bodies listed as responsible for creating and 
implementing the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP) (e.g., Tactical TICP Governance 
Group, Communications Work Group, and the Alabama Department of Homeland Security [ADHS] Region 
7 Interoperability Team [R7IT]).  This many governance bodies can cause confusion, especially in cases like 
Birmingham in which the roles and responsibilities among them are undefined.  It also appears the 
governance groups require further regional cooperation to ensure locally driven decision-making (e.g., the 
ADHS seems to have ultimate decision-making authority, although review power and implementation 
responsibility fall to the local R7IT) and complete participation from agencies in the area (e.g., Jefferson 
County’s limited participation in the regional TICP).  The area has recently developed formal agreements 
supporting a mix of formal and informal partnerships among the area’s public safety organizations.  These 
agreements mark a positive step in moving towards regional cooperation.  Although agencies in the area set 
budget priorities with communications interoperability goals, the area relies mainly on federal grant monies 
with support from local resources.  The area reports developing a strategic plan, which may be an 
amalgamation of the two disparate plans resulting from the combination of the original two TICPs submitted 
for the area.  According to the TICP Peer Review, Jefferson County initially wrote its own plan, separate 
from the Region 7 plan.  The area receives funding from both federal grants and local resources, and appears 
to budget with consideration for regional interoperability goals.  Alabama’s leadership has demonstrated 
political and fiscal support for public safety interoperability by obtaining federal grant funds, without any 
designated Urban Area Security Initiative sites in the state, but the level of participation and support from 
local leaders as champions for achieving communications interoperability across the area is unclear. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Clarify the decision-making authority and implementation responsibilities of the governing bodies (e.g., 
R7IT, Region 7 Homeland Security Task Force, Communications Work Group) through a formalized 
charter and ensure local first responder participation in groups with decision-making authority 
• 
Implement newly developed regional interoperability agreements (e.g., memoranda of understanding), 
involve all participant agencies, and review these agreements at least every 3 to 5 years and after 
significant events or upgrades to ensure they address current needs   
• 
Consider distributing a unified regional strategic plan (beyond the operational TICP), including Jefferson 
County, with participant approval, adoption, and acceptance that takes into account a long-term 
communications funding strategy (beyond grants)  
• 
Align local and statewide strategic planning efforts to ensure that regional interoperability needs are met 
• 
Consider the direct involvement of an executive-level local official(s), with political and fiscal authority 
to specifically focus on interoperable communications

Birmingham was successful in incorporating and updating existing policies and procedures (developed in late 
1990s) into the submitted TICP.  The TICP is very detailed for each county in the area.  However, it appears 
that the area is developing multiple TICPs (one for each county), rather than a consolidated regional plan.  It 
is feasible that having such distinct county-specific plans could complicate rather than simplify attempts to 
achieve interoperable communications across the area.  The area has plans in place to disseminate the various 
county procedures throughout the area once completed.  The area also reports broad adoption of the National 
Incident Management System (NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS).  The real-world exercise used to 
test the TICP identified some procedural gaps in command and control (e.g., inconsistent updating of ICS 
205 forms, use of 10-codes rather than plain language), which leads to the conclusion that full adoption of 
the SOPs is still developing. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Once completed, distribute unified regional interoperability SOPs (beyond those compiled in the TICP), 
and put them into practice with all first responders (e.g., emergency medical services [EMS]) through 
regular training (e.g., in-service refreshers and basic training courses), exercises, and usage 
• 
Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (include communications unit 
implementation consistent with the TICP) and to ensure that all participating first responder agencies 
attain and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance

Birmingham reports daily use of its available means of interoperable communications (e.g., gateways, shared 
channels, and shared systems) and was effective in establishing interoperable communications during its 
exercise.  Because the TICP validation exercise was held in conjunction with a real-world event, there were 
artificial constraints placed on the exercise that did not allow robust testing of participants’ familiarity with 
interoperable communications equipment.  Participants across all disciplines and levels of government were 
involved in the exercise (e.g., Federal Bureau of Investigation, Sheriffs, EMS, and Fire) and were able to 
establish interoperable communications with available interoperability equipment and solutions.   
Recommendation: 
• 
Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises

The Birmingham area has five shared radio systems supporting public safety operations. Systems operating in the area 
include one 800 megahertz (MHz) M/A-COM, Enhanced Digital Access Communications System, three 800 MHz 
Motorola SmartZone™ systems, and one ultra high frequency statewide repeater system.  Both Birmingham and 
Jefferson County use 800 MHz Motorola SmartZone systems.  In addition, the area routinely relies on the 
SouthernLINC commercial wireless system to provide law enforcement and public safety officials with voice and data 
wireless communications.  Regional interoperability is achieved through the use of shared systems, shared channels, 
gateways, and cached radios.  The Interoperable Communications Technical Assistance Program is not active in the 
Birmingham area, and information regarding their current and future communications initiatives is currently unknown.

Anchorage’s Interoperable Communications Steering Committee (ICSC) was established to make 
communications decisions related to funding, policy, training, exercises, and compliance.  The ICSC has an 
Operations Working Group and a Technology Working Group with representation from local, state, and 
federal agencies.  Anchorage should be commended for having broad representation (local, state, and federal) 
on its Alaska Land Mobile Radio (ALMR) system; however, greater federal representation of system users 
may be required in the ICSC.  The public safety agencies in Anchorage have some formal and informal 
agreements among the jurisdictions in the area.  Anchorage has a formal strategic plan that incorporates 
interoperable communications and is accepted by participating agencies.  It is unclear, however, whether the 
area regularly revises the plan or whether the plan is aligned with a long-term funding strategy.  The area has 
been successful in acquiring federal grants and issuing bonds to execute parts of its funding strategy, which 
should be incorporated into a longer-term funding plan (i.e., covering more than 2 years).  Anchorage’s 
leadership has demonstrated political and fiscal support through its issuance of bonds dedicated to 
communications interoperability. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Investigate the possibility of more formal involvement of state and federal organizations in the decision-
making group (e.g., consider conducting executive-level tabletop exercise), and document roles and 
responsibilities, as appropriate 
• 
Document and formalize agreements (e.g., memorandum of understanding) among all participating 
agencies to support partnerships on regional interoperability 
• 
Establish a process to review the strategic plan annually to ensure that interoperable communications 
goals are met 
• 
Align local and statewide strategic planning efforts to ensure the regional interoperability needs are met 
• 
Continue to support and enhance the regional interoperability funding strategy and methods, including 
additional long-term (e.g., 3 to 5 years) funding sources that align with strategic planning efforts

In creating the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP), the area built on the existing TriBorough 
Regional Mutual Aid agreements.  Since the completion of the TICP, however, Anchorage has yet to 
disseminate the new regional SOPs to all included organizations.  Not doing so could potentially cause 
confusion should there be any differences in the pre-existing SOPs upon which the TICP is built.  The 
National Incident Management System (NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS) was implemented more 
than 1 year ago in the area, and all first responder agencies are included in the practice and training.  During 
the TICP validation exercise, the area was successful in demonstrating command and control and the 
Communications Unit Leader (COML) responsibilities.  For example, a unified command was quickly

Usage: Advanced Implementation 
The public safety agencies in the area have demonstrated a clear dedication to implementing interoperable 
communications solutions and a familiarity with the area’s current technology.  Interoperability solutions are 
used on a daily basis and frequently during task force events.  During the TICP validation exercise, the 
participants effectively used their interoperable communications assets across all levels of government and 
types of support disciplines (e.g., Anchorage Water and Wastewater Utility, Federal Aviation 
Administration).  They distributed and provided instructions on the radio cache; created a patch using a 
gateway between Fire and Police; and demonstrated familiarity with the area’s shared systems.  For example, 
during the TICP validation exercise, a patch was set up between Anchorage Fire Department and Police 
Department that served as the command channel for unified command to emergency operations center 
communications.  Additionally, the HearNet shared channel was used to communicate among hospitals.  This 
channel is tested on a weekly basis, which is a strong indication of familiarity and frequency of use. 
Recommendation: 
• 
Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises

The State of Alaska designed a statewide very high frequency, Project 25 (P25), trunked radio communications system 
several years ago in cooperation with the Department of Defense (DoD).  This system, known as the ALMR system, is 
being built slowly as funding becomes available and includes local, state, federal, and DoD users.  The largest 
jurisdiction of this area, the Municipality of Anchorage, is proceeding with its own development and installation of an 
800 megahertz, P25, trunked system.   
The State of Alaska and DoD plan to connect to the Anchorage system via a gateway.  This will increase the potential
