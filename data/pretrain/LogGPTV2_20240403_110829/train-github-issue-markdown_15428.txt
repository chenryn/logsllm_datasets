# Summary of the new feature/enhancement
When certain applications are on the taskbar, right-clicking their icons shows
additional special menu options (ex: VS Code provides options to open recently
opened files, workspaces, etc., calculator has a _tasks_ section, to open the
calculator in standard, programming, etc. modes, Outlook has a menu to create
new tasks, emails, etc.). It would be convenient to include similar
functionality for Terminal, so that a user could open a new Terminal window
that is not the configured default.
For example, if a user's default is Ubuntu 18.04, and the user needs to open a
Powershell window, then the user could simply right-click the taskbar icon,
and the menu would allow opening Terminal directly to either Powershell or any
of the other terminal options. This interaction would prevent a user from
having to open with a fresh Ubuntu terminal, then open a Powershell window (by
either navigating to the menu or using keyboard shortcuts), and closing the
unwanted Ubuntu terminal.
# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)
Add menu contributions to the normal default right-click taskbar menu, which
allows a user to open Terminal directly into any one of the configured
terminal options.
