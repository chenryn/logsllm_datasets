To effectively implement CIS Control 13.3, which involves deploying a network intrusion detection solution, an organization should follow these key procedures:

1. **Assessment and Planning:**
   - Conduct a thorough assessment of the organization's network infrastructure to identify critical assets and potential points of vulnerability.
   - Determine the appropriate locations for deploying the Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) or equivalent cloud service provider (CSP) service. This may include strategic network segments, such as those with high-value assets or frequent external connections.

2. **Selection of Technology:**
   - Choose a NIDS solution that aligns with the organization’s specific needs, budget, and technical capabilities. Consider factors such as the system's ability to detect known and unknown threats, ease of integration with existing security tools, and the level of support and updates provided by the vendor.
   - If using a cloud service provider, ensure that the CSP's intrusion detection service meets the organization’s requirements and complies with relevant security standards.

3. **Deployment:**
   - Install and configure the NIDS or CSP service according to the manufacturer’s guidelines and best practices. Ensure that the system is properly integrated into the network architecture.
   - Configure the system to monitor and analyze network traffic in real-time, and set up alerts for suspicious activities or potential intrusions.

4. **Configuration and Tuning:**
   - Fine-tune the NIDS to reduce false positives and ensure accurate detection. This may involve adjusting thresholds, refining rules, and customizing alert settings.
   - Regularly update the NIDS with the latest threat intelligence and signatures to stay ahead of emerging threats.

5. **Monitoring and Response:**
   - Establish a robust monitoring and response plan. Designate a team or individuals responsible for continuously monitoring the NIDS and responding to alerts.
   - Develop and document incident response procedures to address detected intrusions, including steps for containment, investigation, and remediation.

6. **Training and Awareness:**
   - Provide training to the IT and security teams on the operation and management of the NIDS. Ensure they are familiar with the system’s features, alert mechanisms, and response protocols.
   - Raise awareness among all employees about the importance of network security and the role of the NIDS in protecting the organization’s assets.

7. **Regular Audits and Reviews:**
   - Conduct regular audits and reviews of the NIDS to ensure it is functioning effectively and meeting the organization’s security objectives.
   - Update the NIDS configuration and policies as needed based on the results of the audits and any changes in the threat landscape.

By following these procedures, an organization can successfully deploy and maintain a network intrusion detection solution, enhancing its ability to detect and respond to potential security threats.
