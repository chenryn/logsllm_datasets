User: I just upgraded to windows 10, and downloaded the Anaconda Python distribution and chose the option for it to add everything to my PATH etc. Back in windows 8 when I created a .py file I could execute it from the file explorer just by clicking on it, but for some reason windows 10 won't recognise .py files and when I try run them it opens them in notepad. I am able to run them from the command line. What's gone wrong?
UPDATE: When I choose another application to open the file, I click on the python application and it says "Cannot Execute as Python27.dll is not found", I installed python 3, why is it trying to open in python2.7?
Assistant: Choose open with, then scroll down and click something like "choose another application from this computer" (I don't exactly know, I use windows in different language). Then just select your Python executable and click OK.
