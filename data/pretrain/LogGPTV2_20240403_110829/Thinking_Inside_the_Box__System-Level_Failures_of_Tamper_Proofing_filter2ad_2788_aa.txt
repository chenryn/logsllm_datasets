Abstract
PIN entry devices (PEDs) are critical security compo-
nents in EMV smartcard payment systems as they receive
a customer’s card and PIN. Their approval is subject to
an extensive suite of evaluation and certiﬁcation proce-
dures. In this paper, we demonstrate that the tamper proof-
ing of PEDs is unsatisfactory, as is the certiﬁcation pro-
cess. We have implemented practical low-cost attacks on
two certiﬁed, widely-deployed PEDs – the Ingenico i3300
and the Dione Xtreme. By tapping inadequately protected
smartcard communications, an attacker with basic techni-
cal skills can expose card details and PINs, leaving card-
holders open to fraud. We analyze the anti-tampering mech-
anisms of the two PEDs and show that, while the speciﬁc
protection measures mostly work as intended, critical vul-
nerabilities arise because of the poor integration of cryp-
tographic, physical and procedural protection. As these
vulnerabilities illustrate a systematic failure in the design
process, we propose a methodology for doing it better in
the future. These failures also demonstrate a serious prob-
lem with the Common Criteria. So we discuss the incentive
structures of the certiﬁcation process, and show how they
can lead to problems of the kind we identiﬁed. Finally, we
recommend changes to the Common Criteria framework in
light of the lessons learned.

Introduction
In this paper we examine the deﬁnition and application
of security boundaries in tamper-proof systems. Our work-
ing example is the UK card payment system, ‘Chip and
PIN’, which is an implementation of EMV (the EuroPay,
MasterCard and Visa protocol suite) [23]. We show how
two models of PEDs fail to protect against tampering and
demonstrate real, practical, low-cost attacks. The attacks
highlight problems throughout the entire process of speciﬁ-
cation, design, certiﬁcation and deployment.
Smartcards are now replacing magnetic strip cards for
point of sale and ATM payments in many countries, to re-
sist counterfeiting. The leading system, EMV, has been de-
ployed throughout most of Europe, and is currently being
tested in Canada [40]. In EMV, customers authorize a trans-
action by inserting a bank smartcard and entering a PIN into
a PIN entry device (PED); the PIN is veriﬁed by the smart-
card, which is in turn authenticated to the PED by a public-
key certiﬁcate. Transactions may be further authenticated
online by the card issuer. The move from magnetic strip to
chip has reduced the use of counterfeit cards domestically,
but fraud abroad has more than compensated. According to
APACS, the UK banks’ trade association, the ﬁrst half of
2007 saw £72.3m of fraud due to counterfeit cards, up 37%
from the 2006 ﬁgure [6]. The inadequacies of the deployed
systems have thus impacted many people.
The contributions of this paper are to expose signiﬁcant
vulnerabilities in two of the most widely deployed PEDs in
the UK; to discuss the ﬂawed incentive structure of the cer-
tiﬁcation process; and to propose general design principles
that would minimize future occurrences of the types of vul-
nerability we disclose. We also believe it is in the public
interest to inform cardholders of the true security of bank-
ing systems, in contrast to the banks’ frequently overstated
claims. This will encourage improved security and better
treatment of customers, who are often blamed for fraud.
The remainder of this section surveys anti-tampering
technology. Section 2 describes in detail the ﬂaws we have
identiﬁed; Section 3 discusses some defenses and their lim-
itations; Section 4 presents our methodology for the analy-
sis of tamper-proof systems; Section 5 discusses why these
ﬂaws were not prevented by the extensive certiﬁcation pro-
cedures that PEDs must pass; and ﬁnally, we suggest how
to improve the evaluation process. Additional pictures and
discussion of the tamper prooﬁng of the devices we studied
are in the extended version of this paper [21].

porates anti-tampering mechanisms, which may be catego-
rized as follows:
Tamper evident seals allow an examiner to determine if
protected spaces have been breached. Seals are usually af-
ﬁxed to an enclosure using an adhesive that reacts to being
peeled or torn, to solvents, and to extreme temperatures. It
is challenging, however, to create tamper-evident seals that
cannot be trivially bypassed, and if users are not trained to
detect tampered seals their value is extremely limited [28].
Tamper resistant devices physically hinder unauthorized
access. Technologies used include locks, metal barriers,
and uniquely-shaped screw heads. Electronic circuits may
be ‘potted’ by encasing them in an opaque solid compound
that cannot easily be cut, dissolved, drilled or milled, while
being able to conduct heat away from enclosed circuitry and
dissipate it.
Tamper response means providing sensors to detect tam-
pering, and associated response mechanisms. Sensors mon-
itor environmental and electrical conditions such as connec-
tivity, light, pressure, temperature, radiation, motion, volt-
age, clock signals, conductivity, and others; Weingart [44]
provides a concise list of such sensors. When a breach is
detected, a supervisory circuit responds appropriately.
These techniques are often combined to form tamper-
proof systems. The IBM 4758 security module, for exam-
ple, uses a dense multi-layered mesh of non-metallic con-
ductive grids embedded within a potting compound made
of a material with similar visual and chemical properties
to the conductors, so that identiﬁcation and separation be-
comes more difﬁcult [36]. The whole assembly is encased
in a hard metal shell to prevent accidental damage and to
minimise electromagnetic interference and leakage.
A common response mechanism is zeroization, where
secret data is deleted. Passive zeroization involves discon-
necting power to volatile memory such that content is lost,
while active zeroization overwrites data. Passive zeroiza-
tion may not be sufﬁcient because of data remanence, where
previously stored state remains in RAM cells and other stor-
age media after they have lost power. Ionic contamination,
hot-carrier effects, and electromigration can ‘imprint’ the
stored state over time [24, 25], and extreme temperature or
voltage may cause RAM content to remain for seconds or
even minutes after power is removed [34].
Although very little work has been published on mid-
range, relatively cheap security modules, such as PEDs and
payment terminals, there is some literature on the more ex-
pensive high-end security modules, such as those protecting
the bank master keys used for PIN veriﬁcation. In 1983,
Chaum [17] provided design concepts for tamper prooﬁng
systems using a layered approach, most of which still re-
mains relevant today, although some of the terminology has
changed. To decrease the probability of successful attacks,
Chaum suggested that inner-layer sensors be able to also de-
tect tampering of outer layers. In 1990, Weingart et al. [45]
offered evaluation criteria for security modules, which take
into account the environment and value of the protected
modules; these criteria later formed the basis for NIST’s
FIPS 140-1. In 1999, Smith and Weingart [36] described
the tamper prooﬁng and the API design of the ﬁrst FIPS 140
Level-4 approved security module, the IBM 4758. A year
later, Weingart surveyed known tamper-prooﬁng techniques
and state-of-the-art attacks [44]. Anderson et al. [2, 4]
surveyed the security of cryptographic processors and the
importance of equally robust APIs. Smith [35] discussed
the very relevant disconnect in the minds of protocol de-
signers between the assumed and actual security of secret
storage in the real world. Both Bowles et al. [13] and
Yang et al. [46] surveyed possible vulnerabilities and pro-
tection mechanisms in PEDs in a general sense, but stopped
short of studying deployed models to ﬁnd and demonstrate
existing attacks and ﬂaws, especially in the context of EMV
and the certiﬁcation process. And following the deployment
of EMV in Britain, Anderson et al. [1] discussed security
problems associated with its design, including the applica-
tion of relay attacks to EMV, which were later implemented
by Drimer and Murdoch [20] using custom hardware com-
bined with a fake PED.
Our work pushes this forward, ﬁrst, by considering the
intersection of physical security, protocol design and the
banking transaction environment; second, by looking at
low-cost PEDs that operate in an uncontrolled environ-
ment yet must protect information valuable to third parties;
third, by showing how individual anti-tampering mecha-
nisms must be considered in the context of the system as
a whole; fourth, by discussing the implications for design
and assurance of the vulnerabilities we ﬁnd; and ﬁnally, by
examining the implications for certiﬁcation schemes such
as the Common Criteria. We did this work as independent
researchers not beholden to any external interests.
2 Real world failures in tamper-prooﬁng
For backwards compatibility, cards in the UK have both
a chip and magnetic strip; the strip is used in ATMs with-
out chip readers or when the chip is unreadable. Thus a
criminal who learns the contents of the magnetic strip and
a cardholder’s PIN can withdraw cash by causing an ATM
to fall back to the older system, or by using a copy of the
card in an ATM in a country such as the USA that has not
adopted EMV. A copy of the magnetic strip is stored on the
chip in its public-key certiﬁcate and is sent to terminals (for
backward-compatibility reasons), so PEDs must therefore
protect not just PINs entered by cardholders but also card
details. There may also be symmetric keys, used to protect
communication between the PED and the bank, but these
are outside the EMV protocol.

Merchants have free access to PEDs (as do corrupt em-
ployees); customers sometimes have access for long enough
to tamper with them [19]; and fraudsters have impersonated
service engineers to gain access [9]. Thus the PED must
be assumed to operate in an uncontrolled environment, and
must also fulﬁll its protection goals subject to assumptions
about attacker capabilities deﬁned in certiﬁcation criteria.
Currently the most economically important threat is that if
the PIN and card details are intercepted when they are sent,
unencrypted, between the card and PED, a fake magnetic
strip card may be created. As European bank customers do
not in general enjoy the consumer protection that Regula-
tion E affords to USA bank customers, they are routinely
accused of negligence or even complicity in fraud. This
creates a moral hazard in that the PED is purchased by the
merchant from a list of devices approved by the banks, yet
its role is to protect the cardholder. This makes PED secu-
rity a matter of public interest, and there are also interesting
constraints on PEDs: they must protect valuable secrets in
an unsupervised environment, while being cheap enough to
be affordable by all merchants.
For analysis, we purchased two each of the Ingenico
i3300 [26] and Dione Xtreme [38] (now branded as Ver-
iFone) PEDs, one for reverse engineering and another for
implementing the attacks. Each of those was obtained on-
line for under $20 – thus, in practice, the sale of PEDs is
not restricted. What we found validated our suspicion, in
that the most widely deployed PEDs in the UK appear to
protect bank and merchant secrets well, yet leave customer
card details and PINs inadequately protected.
Both terminals have passed the Visa PED evaluation,
which requires that the terminal meet one of four alternative
requirements (that defeating the tamper-detection would
cost over $25,000 per-PED; or that inserting a PIN-stealing
bug would be detected, or take more than ten hours, or
cost over $25,000) [41, p5, A8]. Neither terminal meets
any of these requirements. In the case of the APACS PED
‘Common Criteria’ evaluation (which the Ingenico device
also passed), the Protection Proﬁle requires that “The [se-
curity function] shall resist physical attacks based on ad-
dition of any PIN tapping device to the PIN Entry Device
and Card Reader by {selection: providing the capability to
detect such attacks with a high probability, automatically re-
sponding such that the [security policy] is not violated}” [5,
p 32, 5.1.4.4]. Again, the Ingenico device clearly fails. The
remainder of this section will show how.
2.1 Anti-tampering mechanisms
The Ingenico PED’s enclosure is made from two plas-
tic shells attached to each other by four ‘Torx 6’ star-head
screws possibly intended to discourage casual opening. A
tamper-response switch is released upon opening the shell,
and breaks a supervisory circuit, as shown in Figure 1(a).
One entire internal circuit board layer is a dense sensor
mesh that is intended to detect drilling from the rear of the
PED. This sensor mesh extends to a three-sided wall that
protects the switch from drilling through a user-accessible
compartment (shown in Figure 2(a)). Additionally, four
contacts (one of which is shown in Figure 1(b)) are pressed
by the enclosure’s top shell, so as to alarm if the keypad
panel is removed. The contacts are surrounded by a con-
ductive ring connected to the battery supply; this is presum-
ably to prevent the attacker from defeating the mechanism
by injecting a conductive liquid. The processing module is
gift-wrapped with a coarse sensor mesh and then potted.
The Dione PED is ultrasonically sealed at seven inter-
locking plastic joints, and has a simple pad shorting a con-
tact to detect opening. Unlike the Ingenico PED, it has no
