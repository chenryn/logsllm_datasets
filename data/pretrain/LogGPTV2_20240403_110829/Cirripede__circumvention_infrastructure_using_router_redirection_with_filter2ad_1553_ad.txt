### Deployment Considerations

To ensure that sufficient DRs are deployed to cover most clients, while keeping the number of DRs small and deployed at trustworthy ISPs or in locations under the provider’s control, we conducted a simulation study. We used a path-level simulator that reads the Internet AS-level graph, places Cirripede components at various ASes, and computes shortest policy-safe paths. The CAIDA AS-level topology (sampled on January 11, 2011) was used, and Gao-Rexford policies were applied based on CAIDA’s inferred AS-relationships.

**Key Experiments:**

1. **Fraction of Clients That Can Utilize the Network (Figure 5):**
   - **Random Subset of ASes as DRs (Figure 5a):** Even if only 5% of overt destinations are allowed to be probed, 0.4% of ASes deploying DRs is sufficient to enable all hosts to join the Cirripede network.
   - **Tier-1 ASes as DRs (Figure 5b):** If only one tier-1 AS deploys Cirripede, 97% of clients can use it, and this increases to 100% with two tier-1 ASes.
   - **Alexa Internet Top Global Sites (Figure 5c):** If hosts are allowed to probe among the top-30 most popular sites, 100% of hosts can join Cirripede. The warden ISP would need to block more than 95% of the top 1000 Alexa-ranked sites to prevent hosts from joining.

2. **Overhead Required to Join the Network (Figure 6):**
   - **Random Subset of ASes as DRs (Figure 6a):** With 5% of overt destinations probed, the source requires only ten probes to discover a path containing a DR.
   - **Tier-1 ASes as DRs (Figure 6b):** This value reduces to less than two, as most Internet paths traverse tier-1 ASes.

#### 7.1 Covert Channels

Covert channels provide a means for unobservable communication and can be classified into covert timing and storage channels. Timing channels embed information in packet timings, which can be detected using statistical tests. Newer channels use models to generate timings with a target distribution, but they may still be detectable due to unmodeled statistical properties. Storage channels use unused or pseudo-random packet fields, but can be detected if the fields differ significantly from regular traffic. Techniques like using TCP initial sequence numbers, IP header TTL, and application-layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, DNS) have been proposed. These channels typically have limited capacities, but end-to-end encryption can increase their bandwidth.

#### 7.2 Blocking Circumvention

Censorship systems, such as the Great Firewall of China, use IP address blocking. Circumvention strategies include using proxies, but distributing proxy addresses without censors discovering them is challenging. Infranet disguises communication as normal web browsing, but relies on the censor not knowing the proxy address. Collage uses user-generated content sites, improving unobservability but reducing interactive performance. Cirripede differs by embedding the proxy within the network, making blocking individual websites ineffective. Telex and Decoy routing share a similar high-level strategy but do not use a registration protocol, requiring monitoring of all port 443 traffic. In contrast, Cirripede monitors only TCP SYN packets, significantly reducing traffic volumes.
