User: I setup a new Ubuntu 12.10 Server on VPN hosting. I have installed all the required setup like Nginx, Python, MySQL etc. I am configuring this to deploy a Flask + Python app using uWSGI. Its working fine.
But to create a basic app i used Putty tool (from Windows) and created required app .py files.
But I want to setup a Git functionality so that i can push my code to required directory say /var/www/mysite.com/app_data so that i don't have to use SSH or FileZilla etc everytime i make some changes into my website.
Since i use both Ubuntu & Windows for development of app, setting up a Git kind of functionality would help me push or change my data easily to my Cloud Server.
How can i setup a Git functionality in Ubuntu ? and How could i access it and Deploy data using tools like GitBash etc. ?

Assistant: Create a bare repository on your server.
Configure your local repository to use the repository on the server as a remote.
When working on your local workstation, commmit your changes and push them to the repository on your server.
Create a post-receive hook in the server repository that calls "git archive" and thus transfers your files to some other directory on the server.
