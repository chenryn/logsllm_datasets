I apologize in advance if I bore you
•
PCI is driving adoption of WAF (and Web App Vulnerability 
Scanning)
•
Pentesters (i.e. QSAs): PCI will drive your business. You 
will need to be familiar with WAFs to evaluate and subvert 
them.
•
IT Security: You will be deploying WAFs because of PCI
•
Blackhats: You will be subverting WAFs for fun and profit!

The Basics

•
R6. "Develop & maintain secure systems and applications"
•
R6.6. "Ensure that all web-facing applications are protected 
against known attacks by applying either of the following 
methods:
 Having all custom application code reviewed for 
common vulnerabilities by an organization that 
specializes in application security
 Installing an application layer firewall in front of 
web-facing applications.
•
Note: This method is considered a best practice until June 
30, 2008, after which it becomes a requirement."

A way to reassign legal liability
 QSA assumes unlimited liability? (IANAL)
•
Compliance rationale for bigger IT security budgets
•
An economically dictated race to the bottom for ASVs?
PCI Data Security Standard
What Does All This Really Mean?
The Information Security Experts
Copyright © 2008 SecureWorks, Inc. All rights reserved.
•
Cost of a PCI ASV's Solution
•
vs. that Solution's Ability to Find Issues (its Quality) 
•
vs. Cost of Remediating the Identified Findings
•
vs. Loss Expectancy Due to Unidentified Issues
•
vs. Loss Expectancy Due to Unremediated Issues
•
No market differentiator between a PCI stamp of approval 
granted by ASVs of varying quality!

"When you know nothing, permit-all is the only option. 
When you know something, default-permit is what you can 
and should do. When you know everything, default-deny 
becomes possible, and only then." – Richard Bejtlich(?),

ModSecurity Content Injection

•
The following rule will inject a Java Applet
•
MyAddress will force attacker's browser to callback to us
•
Reveals IP of the attacking host
 Works despite NAT
 Good, we might be only seeing IP of WAF in server log
Content Injection
An Example

SecContentInjection On
SecDefaultAction 
"log,deny,phase:2,status:500,t:none,setvar:tx.alert=1"
SecRule TX:ALERT "@eq 1" \
"phase:3,nolog,pass,chain,prepend:' \
 \
 \
' "
SecRule RESPONSE_CONTENT_TYPE "^text/html"

The Rules

•
Below is a snippet from Apache access_log on the server
•
Reverse Proxy WAF has IP address is 10.0.0.10
•
Attacker IP is 172.16.0.20
10.0.0.10 - - [30/May/2008:13:47:11 -0400] "GET /cgi-
bin/foo.cgi?param=document.write('
HTTP/1.1" 500 676
10.0.0.10 - - [30/May/2008:13:47:11 -0400] "GET /cgi-
bin/grab_ip.php?IP=172.16.0.20 HTTP/1.1" 404 207

"The Dream"
 Automated webapp vulnerability assessment (i.e., 
scanning) instantly mitigates identified flaws through 
automagic deployment of rules to WAFs.
•
Until recently, not really feasible
 Web App VA generated too many false postives
 Web App VA generated too many duplicates
 WAFs suffered under too many FPs and duplicates
•
Vendors are trying again
VA + WAF
= ??? + Profit !!!

•
Insecure Session Handling / Potential Cookie Tampering
 WAF can perform transparent cookie 
encryption/decryption
•
Flaws in Business Logic
 Reliance on a predictable "random" number in URL to 
provide authentication and authorization
• Can be solved with a WAF performing "URL 
encryption"
• Similar to ModSecurity protection against Universal 
PDF XSS
 Many flaws in business logic are very difficult to detect 
w/ automated tools…
 …and difficult to mitigate with a tool like a WAF
Limitations of WAFs
It’s Just A Tool, Not A Silver Bullet

•
Vendors will continue to add WAF-like functionality
 Load Balancers
 Firewalls
 IPS and UTM devices
•
WAF-like funtionality being wrapped into malware
 Many already contain SOCKS proxy functionality
•

 WPAD-like attack vectors?
