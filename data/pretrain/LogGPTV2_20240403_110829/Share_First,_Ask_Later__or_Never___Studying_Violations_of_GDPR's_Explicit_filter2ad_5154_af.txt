Automated analysis of privacy requirements for mobile
apps. In NDSS, 2017.
As part of our analysis, we investigate the sharing of users’
personal information (e.g., user IP address, persistent identi-
ﬁers, tracking identiﬁers) with third-party services to show
personalized or behavioral advertising. Based on our analysis,
your app shares some personal user information to such ser-
vices without obtaining prior explicit consent from users. We
have prepared a detailed report on the analysis methodology,
the data being sent out, and the parties involved. You can
access this through our (password-protected) Web interface at
$report_url (please do not publish this URL as it is personal-
ized for your app). By analyzing the legal documents (e.g., the
terms of service, privacy policies, developer guidelines, and
contracts) provided by the third-party services in question,
we concluded that your app might be non-compliant with
the consent requirements by the GDPR [1]. In most cases,
in order to be legally compliant, an app is required to obtain
explicit consent from users situated in the European Union
before sharing users’ personal data with third parties for per-
sonalized ads, if those third parties act as a data controller.
Please note that we do not offer a conclusive legal assessment
or consultancy on an individual app’s compliance as there
might be an alternative lawful basis present for data sharing
with a third party other than consent. As this email is part
of a research project in which we are trying to understand
the reasons for GDPR compliance issues of mobile apps in
the wild, it would be immensely helpful to provide us with
feedback regarding your apps.
(1) Were you aware of the types of data that are being col-
lected and transmitted when you include third-party SDK(s)
into your apps? Were you aware that these types of data could
be considered personal data under the GDPR?
(2) Are there speciﬁc reasons why your app does not im-
plement explicit consent?
(3) Are there any changes you plan to apply to remedy the
outlined issues? What type of support (e.g., documentation or
automated tools) would be beneﬁcial for you?
Should you have further questions or wish not to receive
any further communication, please contact us, and we will
diligently follow the request.

B Manual Version Analysis
Dear $developer team,
We are a team of academic researchers from the $af-
ﬁliation, conducting a research project on user consent and
GDPR (EU General Data Protection Regulation) compliance
of mobile apps. Please note that this email is part of an
academic research project and is not meant to sell any
products or services.
We ﬁrst analyze the app network trafﬁc to ﬁnd parameters that
indicate the SDK version. These are: unity3d.com (x-unity-
version, sdkversion, sdk_version_name, sdk_ver, sdkversion);
flurry.com (ﬂ.sdk.version.code); vungle.com (user-agent,
sdk); my.com:
(mytracker_ver); amazon-adsystem.com
(adsdk). Further, we manually verify the results with the iden-
tiﬁed SDK(s) release notes. We then used this knowledge to
detect versions all apps that sent PD.
