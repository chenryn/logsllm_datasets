### Integration of Facebook Login in an App

There are two primary methods to integrate Facebook login into an application:

1. **Direct Button Implementation**: Embed a Facebook login button (implemented using the Facebook SDK) in one of the app's activity layout files.
2. **Programmatic Login**: Invoke Facebook login functions programmatically through code.

Based on these approaches, we designed a screening procedure that first checks for the presence of a Facebook login button in the app's activity layout files. If no button is found, the procedure then searches for code that calls Facebook login methods from the Facebook SDK. This code search is performed using the Soot framework, which analyzes function call patterns. If neither the button nor the invoking code is detected, the app is excluded from further analysis. After applying this filtering process, our dataset includes 4,838 apps.

### Testing Environment

All apps were tested on a real LG Nexus 4 smartphone running Android 4.4. The phone was equipped with a component for generating post-authentication messages and was connected to a Ubuntu 14.04 desktop with an Intel i7-6700k Skylake 4.00 GHz CPU and 8 GB of memory. The desktop controlled the automatic execution of apps on the smartphone via the ADB interface using Python scripts. Additionally, it intercepted, collected, and mutated network messages between the apps and remote servers using a man-in-the-middle proxy. We also registered two test accounts, Alice (PI:EMAIL) and Bob (bob4testapp@gmail.com), with Facebook for testing purposes.

### Evaluation Results

#### Macro Level

We spent a total of 562.4 hours dynamically analyzing the 4,838 apps and discovered 597 vulnerable authorization implementations in the corresponding servers, affecting 306 apps. The overall experimental results are summarized in Table 2. 

- **Total Request Messages**: 3,220,886
- **HTTP Messages**: 178,539
- **Total Message Size**: 59.2 G-bytes
- **Time for Facebook Login Analysis**: 169.9 hours
- **Activities Explored Before Authentication**: 15,367
- **Views Identified Before Authentication**: 503,441
- **Activities Explored After Authentication**: 20,704
- **Views Identified After Authentication**: 1,181,442
- **Fields Mutated**: 57,736
- **Suspicious Interfaces**: 2,976
- **Public Interfaces**: 2,379
- **Vulnerable Interfaces**: 597

To understand the distribution of vulnerable services, we categorized the apps based on their top-level categories as assigned by Google Play. The results, shown in Figure 5, indicate that the top three categories with the most vulnerable interfaces are:
- **Lifestyle**: 153
- **Games**: 99
- **Shopping**: 72

These categories often involve highly interactive apps where user data is frequently stored, shared, and updated on servers, leading to more complex access control implementations. Surprisingly, we also found vulnerable implementations in Finance (3) and Business (9) related apps, which can have serious implications for end users due to potential data leakage.

#### Micro Level

To provide a detailed view of AuthScope's performance, we selected the top downloaded app in each vulnerable server category and presented the results in Table 3. The table includes the following information for each app:
- **Category Name**
- **Package Name** (anonymized for privacy)
- **Number of Activities Explored**
- **Number of Unique Views Identified**
- **Time to Find Facebook Login**
- **Total Number of Request Messages**
- **Total Number of Fields Mutated**
- **Number of Public Interfaces**
- **Number of Vulnerable Interfaces**

This detailed breakdown helps in understanding the specific vulnerabilities and performance metrics for each app.
