**Config file**
    import {Config, defineConfig} from "@playwright/test";
    import {dirname, join} from "node:path";
    import {fileURLToPath} from "node:URL";
    const __dirname = dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url));
    const CI = process.env.CI !== undefined;
    const reportsPath = join(__dirname, "tests/playwright/reports");
    const reporters: Config["reporter"] = [
      [
        "html",
        {
          open: "never",
          outputFolder: join(reportsPath, "html")
        }
      ],
      ["list"]
    ];
    if (CI) {
      reporters.push(["github"]);
    }
    export default defineConfig({
      projects: [
        {
          name: "tests",
          testDir: join(__dirname, "tests/playwright/tests"),
          testMatch: "**/*.spec.ts"
        }
      ],
      outputDir: join(__dirname, "tests/playwright/output"),
      use: {
        video: "on",
        trace: "on"
      },
      timeout: 1000 * 60 * 5,
      //CI will be true
      maxFailures: CI ? 1 : 0,
      reporter: reporters,
      retries: CI ? 2 : 0,
      workers: CI ? 8 : 1
    });
**Test file (self-contained)**
    it('should check the box using setChecked', async ({ page }) => {
      //...
      /* Note that running with force: true seems to slightly decrease the frequency of the issue,
      but it still occurs >50% of the time. The issue also occurs with the `.type` method (at about
      the same frequency as the stock `.fill` method, like below). */
      await page.getByLabel("Email").fill("PI:EMAIL");
      await page.getByLabel("Password").first().fill("[REDACTED]");
      await page.getByRole("button", {
        name: /Log in|Sign up/
      }).click();
      //...
    });
**React Component**
    //Based on https://mantine.dev/form/use-form/#getinputprops
    const form = useForm({
      initialValues: {
        email: "",
        password: "",
        confirmPassword: "",
        terms: false
      },
      clearInputErrorOnChange: false,
      validate: //Validation logic is ran immediately after any input
    });
    //...
    }
      label="Email"
      placeholder="PI:EMAIL"
      radius="md"
      type="email"
      withAsterisk
    />
    }
      label="Password"
      radius="md"
      {...form.getInputProps("password")}
      visibilityToggleIcon={visibilityToggle}
      withAsterisk
    />
    //...
**Steps**
  * Run the tests in GitHub Actions
**Expected**
  * Playwright reliably types into the input fields (See the screen recordings)
**Actual**
  * Playwright non-deterministically fails to type into the input fields and the test times out 
    * Occurs 80% of the time in GitHub Actions
    * Does not consistently freeze up at the same place in the email/password input
