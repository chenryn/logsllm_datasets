User: i am facing some problem with files with huge data.
i need to skip doing some execution on those files.
i get the data of the file into a variable.
now i need to get the byte of the variable and if it is greater than 102400 , then print a message.
update : i cannot open the files , since it is present in a tar file. 
         the content is already getting copied to a variable called 'data'
         i am able to print contents of the variable data. i just need to check if it has more than 102400 bytes.
thanks
Assistant: len(data) gives you the size in bytes if it's binary data. With strings the size depends on the encoding used.
