I am encountering an issue with files containing large amounts of data. I need to skip certain operations on these files based on their size.

Currently, the file data is being loaded into a variable named `data`. I need to check the size of this `data` in bytes and print a message if it exceeds 102400 bytes.

**Additional Details:**
- The files are contained within a tar archive, so I cannot open them directly.
- The content of the files is already being copied into the `data` variable.
- I can print the contents of the `data` variable, but I only need to check if its size exceeds 102400 bytes.

**Question:**
How can I determine the size of the `data` variable in bytes and check if it is greater than 102400 bytes?

**Note:**
- If `data` is binary, `len(data)` will give the size in bytes.
- If `data` is a string, the size in bytes depends on the encoding used.

Thank you for your help.
