### Attribute Clustering Coefficient and Average Clustering Coefficient

We define the attribute clustering coefficient \( c(u) \) for an attribute node \( u \) using the method from ยง3.4. The average attribute clustering coefficient \( C_a \) is then given by:

\[ C_a = \frac{1}{|V_a|} \sum_{u \in V_a} c(u) \]

The attribute clustering coefficient \( c(u) \) characterizes the ability of attribute \( u \) to form communities among users who possess that attribute. Comparing Figure 4d and Figure 8b, we observe that the average attribute clustering coefficient evolves differently, remaining relatively stable in Phase II.

### Distribution of Clustering Coefficients

In Figure 9a, we show the distribution of both social and attribute clustering coefficients as a function of node degree. Both types of clustering coefficients follow a power-law distribution with respect to node degrees, but the attribute clustering coefficient distribution has a larger exponent. Generally, attribute clustering coefficients are lower because many shared attributes (e.g., city or major) do not naturally translate into social relationships.

### Degree Distributions in SANs

Social-Attribute Networks (SANs) introduce edges between social and attribute nodes, leading to two new notions of node degrees:
1. **Social degree of attribute nodes**: The number of users that have this attribute.
2. **Attribute degree of social nodes**: The number of attributes each user has.

We find that the attribute degree of social nodes is best modeled by a lognormal distribution, while the social degree of attribute nodes is best modeled by a power-law distribution. Figures 10 and 11 illustrate these degree distributions and the evolution of their fitted parameters.

### Evolution of Degree Distributions

For the attribute degree, we observe significant differences from the previous observation in Figure 6: its mean decreases in Phase I, remains roughly constant in Phase II, and decreases again in Phase III. However, its standard deviation increases slightly in all phases. For the social degree, which follows a power-law distribution, the exponent decreases rapidly in Phase I and increases slightly in Phases II and III.

### Joint Degree Distribution

Next, we extend the joint degree distribution (JDD) analysis to attribute nodes. For each social degree \( k \), we compute \( k_{nn} \) as the average attribute degree of social neighbors of attribute nodes with social degree \( k \). This captures the tendency of attribute nodes with high social degree to connect to social nodes with high attribute degree. Figure 12 shows the \( k_{nn} \) function for attribute JDD and the evolution of the attribute assortativity coefficient.

### Influenze on Social Network Structure

We examine how attributes influence the social structure of the Google+ SAN with respect to the metrics discussed in ยง3. We focus on the Employer and Major attributes and show the results for the top attribute values observed within each category. Figure 14 plots the median, 25th, and 75th percentiles of the social outdegree of nodes with these attribute values. Users with Employer=Google and Major=Computer Science tend to have higher degrees. The full degree distributions for these attribute values follow different lognormal distributions, suggesting a specific artifact of the Google+ network, where early adopters likely included many Google employees and IT/CS industry users.

### Validation via Subsampling

To validate whether the attributes of 22% of users are representative of the entire user base, we use a subsampling method. We remove attributes with a probability of 0.5 for each user with attributes, creating a subsampled SAN. We then calculate the attribute clustering coefficient distributions for both the original and subsampled SANs. Figure 9b shows that the results are almost identical, confirming that the attributes of 22% of users are a representative sample of the attributes of all users.

### Summary of Key Observations and Implications

- **Attribute Metrics and Social Counterparts**: While some attribute metrics mirror their social counterparts (e.g., diameter), others show significantly different distributions and trends (e.g., clustering coefficient, attribute degree). These observations will guide the design of models for SANs.
- **Impact on Social Structure**: Attributes have a significant impact on the social structure. For example, nodes are more likely to have higher reciprocity if they share common attributes. This implies that reciprocity predictors should incorporate node attributes.
- **Differential Influence of Attribute Types**: Some attribute types, such as Employer, have a stronger influence on social connections than others, like City. Data mining tasks such as link prediction and attribute inference can benefit from these findings.

### Generative Model for SAN

From the previous sections, we have observed novel phenomena in the social and attribute structure of the Google+ SAN. A natural question is whether we can create an accurate generative network model that reproduces both the social and attribute structures. Such a model can help us understand the growth mechanisms of SANs and support applications like network extrapolation, sampling, visualization, and anonymization.

### Building Block 1: Combined Linear Effect of Social Degree and Attributes

We conclude that there is a combined linear effect of both social degree and attributes on the network structure.

### Building Block 2: Attribute-Augmented Triangle-Closings

Triangle closing, where a node \( u \) selects a node \( v \) from its 2-hop neighbors and adds an edge, is a key component of many generative network models. We explore whether node attributes can improve triangle closing in the context of SANs. We consider three models:
- **Baseline**: Select a social neighbor \( v \) within a 2-hop radius uniformly at random.
- **Random-Random (RR)**: Select a social neighbor \( w \in \Gamma_s(u) \) uniformly at random, and then select a social neighbor \( v \in \Gamma_s(w) \) uniformly at random.
- **Random-Random-SAN (RR-SAN)**: Select a neighbor \( w \in \Gamma_s(u) \cup \Gamma_a(u) \) uniformly at random, and then select a social neighbor \( v \in \Gamma_s(w) \) uniformly at random.

Our experimental results confirm that the RR model performs 14% better than the Baseline model, and the RR-SAN model performs 36% better than the RR model. This confirms that attributes play a significant role in triangle-closing and have implications for link prediction and friend recommendation.

### Our Generative Model for SAN

To address the gap in modeling the attribute structure and its impact on social structure, we propose a new generative model that incorporates the attribute structure from first principles. This model aims to accurately reproduce both the social and attribute structures observed in the Google+ SAN.
