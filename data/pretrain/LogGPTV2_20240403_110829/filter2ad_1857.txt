ABSTRACT
In the current Internet architecture, application service pro-
viders (ASPs) own users’ data and social groups informa-
tion, which made a handful of ASP companies growing big-
ger and bigger and denied small and medium companies
from entering this business. We propose a new architecture,
called Application Independent Information Infrastructure
(AI3). The design goals of AI3 are: 1) Decoupling user-
s’ data from ASPs and users’ social relations from ASPs,
such that ASPs become independent from users’ data and
social relations. 2) Open architecture, such that diﬀeren-
t ASPs can interoperate with each other. This demo is to
show a prototype of AI3. The demo has four parts: 1) ASP-
independent data management in AI3; 2) ASP-independent
management of users’ social relations in AI3; 3) inter-domain
data transport and user roaming; 4) real-time communica-
tions by using AI3. The demo video can be watched at:

INTRODUCTION
Fueled up by the explosive growth of social networks in re-
cent years, User Generated Contents (UGC), such as videos,
photos, and blogs, have become a dominant source of Inter-
net traﬃc. The constant eﬀorts of developing new Inter-
net architectures have led to several projects for informa-
tion dissemination, sharing and networking. The well-known
projects [1, 2, 3, 4] include Information-centric networking
(ICN), Named Data Networks (NDN), and PURSUIT. How-
ever, these systems focused on eﬃcient content discovery
and data transportation by using routing and caching tech-

nologies. The issues of ownership of UGC and managemen-
t of UGC have been largely overlooked and not been ad-
dressed adequately. In the current setting, application ser-
vice providers (ASPs), such as Facebook, Twitter, Tencen-
t, etc., own users’ data and manage the information about
users’ social groups, which made a handful of ASP compa-
nies growing bigger and bigger and denied small and medi-
um companies from entering this business. There are several
major problems with this structure of ASPs: 1) The ASPs
use users’ data and social relations to hijack the users to go
with them, leaving users with little choice. 2) Users can only
publish their data within the ASP that they registered with
and the data cannot be shared by friends crossing diﬀeren-
t ASPs. 3) User’s social groups are fragmented by ASPs
and the members of a user’s social group are often scattered
among several ASPs.
We propose a new architecture, called Application Inde-
pendent Information Infrastructure (AI3). There are two
design goals of AI3:
1) Decoupling users’ data and users’ social relations from
ASPs, such that ASPs become independent from users’ da-
ta and social relations. The ownership of users’ data and
information of social groups are returned back to the users
and managed by the AI3 architecture. ASPs become the
ordinary applications on top of AI3, which breaks down the
monopoly of a few giant ASPs and provides small companies
a leveled ground to compete with them in business.
2) Open architecture, such that diﬀerent ASPs can in-
teroperate with each other. Users publish information no
longer with a speciﬁc ASP, they publish information to their
social groups. Once a user publishes a message to a social
group through an ASP, all members in this social group
can receive the message no matter which ASPs they reg-
istered with. The openness of the architecture also means
the interoperation among diﬀerent network domains, which
facilitates roaming functions of users and automatic data
migration across network domains.
2. AI3 ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW
The overview of AI3 is described in Fig.1. There are two
layers in the architecture, information layer and presentation
layer.
Information layer is the core of AI3, which is responsi-
ble for data storage, access control and distribution. These
functions are supported by a system called versatile storage
system (VSS). In VSS system, each user has his own storage
to store his data and social relations. Standard APIs are
provided to the presentation layer, which allows the ASP-
s and user applications (APPs) to operate on user’s social
145ASPs: FaceBlog, SinaBlog and NetDrive. We consider two
VSS domains, one in USA and the other in China. There are
four parts of the demo: 1) how AI3 decouples users’ social
relations from ASPs; 2) how AI3 decouples users’ data from
ASPs; 3) how AI3 enables the VSS systems operated by
diﬀerent organizations to cooperate with each other; and 4)
how AI3 support real-time inter-person communication.
A. ASP-Independent User Relations Management.
In
this part of demo, Alice in FaceBlog follows Bob who uses
a diﬀerent ASP, say SinaBlog. Although Bob uses a diﬀer-
ent ASP from Alice, he can still see Alice becomes his fan
from his own ASP. This is because all users’ social relations
are managed by AI3 and decoupled from the ASPs. ASPs
use standard interface provided by AI3 to operate on users’
social relations.
B. ASP-Independent Data Management.
In this section
of demo, Cathy shares a photo to public through a ﬁle man-
agement app - NetDrive. All her followers, say Alice and
Bob, can see the photo in their own ASPs, such as FaceBlog
and SinaBlog, even though they do not use NetDrive. This
is because all users’ data are managed by AI3 and are de-
coupled from the ASPs. These data are solely owned and
controlled by the user. Once the user deletes the data, all
references of the data that were published in multiple ASPs
will be completely removed throughout the entire network.
In
this subsection, we demonstrate that two users registered at
diﬀerent VSS domains communicate with each other, and
roam to the other domains seamlessly without feeling per-
formance degradation. The inter-domain communications
are handled by AI3 inter-domain interface, and they are
transparent to the end users. Data pre-caching technique
is employed to ensure the seamless roaming of users across
domains.

relations, and subscribe from and publish data to targeted
social groups. To support the openness, AI3 also provides
a standard inter-domain interface to allow interconnection
between domains operated by diﬀerent organizations. Users
can move freely from one domain to another without af-
fecting their data access experience and users from diﬀerent
domains can communicate seamlessly. Another design goal
of AI3 is to make it as the infrastructure of data commu-
nication networks which support data transmission, inter-
person real-time communication and data management. It
integrates both data service and networking service into a
versatile ﬁle service upon which various network applications
can be built.
The presentation layer consists of the ASPs and APPs.
These ASPs (or APPs) make use of the data obtained from
the information layer, and provide a variety of services to
the end users. Since users’ data and social relations are
decoupled from ASPs, all ASPs have to compete with each
other to win users by providing high quality and innovative
services.

there are three end users: Alice, Bob and Cathy, and three
D. Real-time Inter-person Communication.
In this part,
we demonstrate real-time inter-person communications in
AI3 architecture. Two users, Alice and Bob, make a video
conference call by using the app VideoChat in presentation
layer of AI3. The real-time video traﬃc is temporally stored
at and relayed by a VSS system that is close to both users.
The users can also archive the streaming data into their
personal storage.
4. CONCLUSION
AI3 decouples ASPs from users’ data and users’ social
relations. With AI3 architecture, ASPs can focus on de-
veloping more innovative applications and providing bet-
ter quality services to win user groups. AI3 also integrates
ﬁle services with traditional networking services. This is a
good structure to support user’s mobility and to implement
architecture-wide information security.
