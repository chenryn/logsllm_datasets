Assistant: You can check the basic status of the system through the following steps: 1. Install a monitoring system: You can choose an open source monitoring system, such as Zabbix, Nagios, Cacti, etc., or a commercial monitoring system, such as SolarWinds, PRTG, Datadog, etc. 2. Configure monitoring items: add hosts or devices to be monitored in the monitoring system, and configure parameters to be monitored, such as CPU usage, memory usage, network traffic, etc. 3. Start the monitoring task: After configuring the monitoring items, start the monitoring task. The monitoring system will periodically obtain data according to the configured parameters, and perform analysis and alarm. 4. View monitoring data: You can view real-time monitoring data in the graphical interface of the monitoring system, and you can also set alarm rules. Once a certain parameter exceeds the preset threshold, the monitoring system will automatically send an alarm email or SMS to notify the administrator . In short, through the above steps, the basic state of the system can be easily monitored, and problems can be found and dealt with in time to ensure the normal operation of the system.
