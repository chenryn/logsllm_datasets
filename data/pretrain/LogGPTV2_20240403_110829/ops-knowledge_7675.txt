Question: "An attacker is targeting an online service with the intent of exploiting security mechanism flaws. Based on common issues with security mechanisms, which of the following scenarios could allow the attacker to succeed? (Choose all that apply.)"
 "A": "The online service's website has rate-limiting on login attempts, but an API used for a password recovery feature does not implement rate-limiting."
 "B": "A credit card web application performs proper access control checks on the login page but fails to verify the user's session when direct URLs to account pages are accessed."
 "C": "The random number generator used in the service's cryptographic functions has been thoroughly vetted and is seeded properly with high-quality entropy sources."
 "D": "The service uses a complex encryption algorithm that has not been publicly analyzed, believing that its obscurity provides an additional layer of security."
