**ATT&CK ID:** T1056.004  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Credential API Hooking

Adversaries may use credential API hooking to intercept and collect user credentials by redirecting calls to specific Windows application programming interface (API) functions. This technique targets API calls that include parameters revealing user authentication credentials. Unlike keylogging, which captures keystrokes, credential API hooking specifically focuses on intercepting function calls that handle or process user credentials. The hooking mechanism can be implemented through various methods, including:

- **DLL Injection:** Injecting a malicious DLL into a process to intercept and modify API calls.
- **Inline Hooking:** Directly modifying the code of the target API function to redirect execution flow.
- **IAT (Import Address Table) Hooking:** Modifying the import address table to point to a malicious function instead of the original API function.
- **Detours:** Using a library like Microsoft Detours to intercept and manipulate API calls.

These methods allow adversaries to capture sensitive information, such as usernames and passwords, without relying on traditional keylogging techniques.
