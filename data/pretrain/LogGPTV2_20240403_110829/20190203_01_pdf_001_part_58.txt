### Verifying User Privileges in Replication Systems

#### Single-Master Replication System
- **Publication Database:**
  - Ensure the publication database user is a superuser and has the privilege to modify `pg_catalog` tables.
  - Refer to Section 5.1.4.3 for more details.

#### Multi-Master Replication System
- **Master Definition Node:**
  - Verify that the publication database user is a superuser and has the privilege to modify `pg_catalog` tables.
  - Refer to Section 6.1.3 for more details.
- **Other Master Nodes:**
  - Confirm that the master node database user is a superuser and has the privilege to modify `pg_catalog` tables.
  - Refer to Section 6.1.4 for more details.

#### Subscription Database
- **Oracle:**
  - Ensure the subscription database user has `CONNECT` and `RESOURCE` privileges.
- **Postgres:**
  - Verify that the subscription database user is a superuser and has the privilege to modify `pg_catalog` tables.
  - Refer to Section 5.1.5 for more details.

### Network Configuration (Linux Only)
- **Step 7:**
  - Verify that the network IP address returned by the `/sbin/ifconfig` command matches either:
    - The IP address associated with the host name in the `/etc/hosts` file (see Section 5.1.6.2).
    - The IP address specified with the `java.rmi.server.hostname` configuration option in the publication and subscription server configuration files (see Section 10.4.1.7).

### Troubleshooting Areas

#### 10.3.4.1 Java Runtime Errors
- If you encounter errors related to the Java Runtime Environment, such as "Java program not found" or "Java heap space errors," check the parameters set in the xDB Startup Configuration file (`xdbReplicationServer-xx.config`).
- Refer to Section 2.3.1.4 for information on the xDB Startup Configuration file.
- Example of the xDB Startup Configuration file:
  ```sh
  #!/bin/sh
  JAVA_EXECUTABLE_PATH="/usr/bin/java"
  JAVA_MINIMUM_VERSION=1.7
  JAVA_BITNESS_REQUIRED=64
  JAVA_HEAP_SIZE="-Xms256m -Xmx1536m"
  PUBPORT=9051
  SUBPORT=9052
  ```
- After making any changes, restart the publication and subscription servers.

#### 10.3.4.2 Starting the Publication Server or Subscription Server
- **Note:** The subscription server applies only to single-master replication systems.
- If you cannot start the publication or subscription server, follow these steps:
  1. Check the `pubserver.log` and `subserver.log` files for errors.
  2. Review the log file of the database server running the controller database for errors.
  3. Verify that the user name and password in the xDB Replication Configuration file match a database user name and password in the controller database.
  4. For Postgres databases, ensure the `pg_hba.conf` file allows access from the IP addresses of the hosts running the publication and subscription servers.

#### 10.3.4.3 Deleting the Control Schema and Control Schema Objects
- The control schema is crucial for the proper functioning of the replication system. If it becomes corrupted, you may need to delete all remaining control schema objects.
- **Warning:** Do not attempt this if any replication systems are running in production. All replication systems will become inoperable.
- To determine if the control schema is incomplete, review the checklist in Section 10.3.3. If deletion is necessary, follow these steps:

  1. Stop the publication server.
  2. Stop the subscription server.
  3. Identify the control schema objects within the publication database. For example, the publication user `pubuser` has two tables: `dept` and `emp`.
     - **Oracle:** See Section 5.2.4.1.
     - **SQL Server:** See Section 5.2.4.2.
     - **Postgres:** See Section 5.2.4.3.
  4. If the control schema or its objects are missing, proceed with the deletion process. Repeat Step 7 for all publication databases and Step 8 for all subscription databases.
  5. For single-master replication systems, verify the presence of the `rrep_txset_health` table in the subscription database. See Section 5.3.4 for details.
  6. If all control schemas and objects appear intact, recheck the checklist in Section 10.3.3.
  7. Delete the control schema and objects from each publication database:
     - **Oracle:**
       ```sql
       SQL> CONNECT system/password
       Connected.
       SQL> DROP USER pubuser CASCADE;
       User dropped.
       ```
     - **SQL Server:**
       - Drop jobs in the `msdb` database.
       - Drop triggers on non-snapshot publication tables.
       - Drop control schema objects under `_edb_replicator_pub`, `_edb_replicator_sub`, and `_edb_scheduler`.
       - Drop the `pubuser` schema.
     - **SQL Server 2008:**
       - Drop additional control schema objects.
     - **SQL Server 2012, 2014:**
       - Drop sequences and additional control schema objects.
     - **Postgres:**
       - Follow similar steps to drop the control schema and objects.

After completing the deletion process, recreate the replication systems following the directions in sections 5.2 onward for single-master systems and sections 6.2 onward for multi-master systems.
