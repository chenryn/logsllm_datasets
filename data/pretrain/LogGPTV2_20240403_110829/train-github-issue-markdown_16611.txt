### Documentation Link
https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/gallery/widgets/span_selector.html
### Problem
I've noticed this in a couple instances, but was requested via twitter to
report this one. I think a visitor would expect the spanselector example to be
a dynamic, working version. When I go to the stable or dev link, it appears as
a static image.
### Suggested improvement
A working example would be helpful for users to know how spanselector actually
works. This seems like a great feature that folks might like to embed in their
websites.
