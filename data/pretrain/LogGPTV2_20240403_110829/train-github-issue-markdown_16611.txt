### Issue Description
I have observed this issue in several instances, and it was also brought to my attention via Twitter. The current SpanSelector example on the documentation page appears as a static image, both in the stable and development versions. Visitors would likely expect a dynamic, interactive example to better understand how the SpanSelector works.

### Suggested Improvement
To enhance the user experience and provide a clearer demonstration of the SpanSelector functionality, I recommend implementing a working, interactive example. This would allow users to interact with the SpanSelector directly and see its behavior in real-time. Additionally, a live, functional example would be particularly useful for those who are interested in embedding this feature on their own websites.
