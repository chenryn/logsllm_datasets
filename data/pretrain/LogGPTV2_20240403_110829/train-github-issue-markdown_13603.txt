##### Issue Type:
Feature Idea
##### Component Name:
lineinfile module
##### Ansible Version:
All versions.
##### Environment:
Ubuntu 14.04, and all other.
##### Summary:
The module "lineinfile" should have an option to remove duplicate lines
matched by regexp.  
Currently it changes only the last line.
##### Steps To Reproduce:
Let's say that we have the following lines in sshd_config (don't ask me how I
got this):
    PasswordAuthentication yes
    # some stuff
    PasswordAuthentication yes
We run ansible as:
    $ansible -c local -m lineinfile -a 'dest=./sshd_config  regexp="^[#\s]*PasswordAuthentication.*" line="PasswordAuthentication no"' localhost
##### Expected Results:
With an option like "remove_dups=yes" we would have:
    # some stuff
    PasswordAuthentication no
##### Actual Results:
    PasswordAuthentication yes
    # some stuff
    PasswordAuthentication no
