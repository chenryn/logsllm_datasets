tation.
2. Repeat the following steps until the ARPACK rou-
tine indicates convergence or stops after certain
number of iterations:
(a) Consistency Check When dsaupd returns
control to S1 with a vector, the server con-
φ and sends it to
verts the vector to v ∈ Zm
all users. The servers execute the consistency
check protocol for each user.
(b) Aggregate For any users who are marked as
FAIL, or fail to respond, the servers simply ig-
nore their data and exclude them from subse-
quent computation. Q is updated accordingly.
For this round they compute s =Pi∈Q di and
S1 returns it as the matrix-vector product to
dsaupd which runs another iteration.
3. Output S1 outputs
Theorem 3 Let nc be the number of cheating users. We
use ˜· to denote perturbed quantity and σi the i-th singu-
lar value of matrix A. Assuming that honest users vector
L2-norms are uniformly random in [0, L) and nc ≪ n,
then
sPi(˜σi − σi)2

pect the scheme to be deployed with a large number of
servers, we provide some analysis here in case stronger
