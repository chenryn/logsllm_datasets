Web tracking technologies are largely divided into two
broad categories: stateful and stateless. Stateful tracking tech-
niques store information on the user’s computer and later
retrieve it to recognise the user. Third-party cookies are the
most prevalent online tracking technique, and in recent years
researchers found out that cookies can be "respawned" even
if the user deleted them [7, 27]. Moreover, cookies get syn-
chronised among diﬀerent data brokers in order to map and
exchange user’s pro(cid:12)les [13, 24]. Several groups of researchers
have reported on the usage of diﬀerent stateful trackers on
popular websites [7, 17, 26, 28].
Stateless technologies allow trackers to recognise users
without storing any information on the user’s machine. De-
vice (cid:12)ngerprinting collects information about the user’s browser
and OS properties, and can distinguish users by these char-
acteristics [11]. In 2010, Eckersley (cid:12)rst demonstrated that
the technology is eﬀective (see Panopticlick project [12]). Re-
searchers later on have discovered that device (cid:12)ngerprinting
started being used by tracking companies [6, 21]. Moreover,
because of the advance of web standards and HTML5, new
more advanced techniques became possible, that use Can-
vas API, WebRTC and AudioContext (cid:12)ngerprinting [13]. Re-
cently, more (cid:12)ngerprinting techniques were discovered, that
allow to track users across devices [9, 10]. In another recent
project, researchers demonstrate that web browsers may be
detected via the extensions that the user installs and web-
sites where the user is logged in [14].

regulation, which may make website owners liable for the
third-party tracking present on their websites. Social share
privacy platform [25] allows website developers to include
social widgets, but disable any request to a third party until
the used clicks on the button. Researchers have recently pro-
posed a server-side technique to protect against web tracking:
it’s based on setting up two additional servers that rewrite
and redirect the original web application requests so that
third-party tracking is automatically removed from the third-
party content [30].
