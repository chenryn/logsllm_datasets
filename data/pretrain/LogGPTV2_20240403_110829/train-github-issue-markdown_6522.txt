    Currently, the documentation on os.File.Seek mentions:
    Seek sets the offset for the next Read or Write on file to offset, interpreted according
    to whence: 0 means relative to the origin of the file, 1 means relative to the current
    offset, and 2 means relative to the end.
    It leads people to write things like file.Seek(0, 2) which is in my opinion, not that
    readable, especially when you don't know where those numbers come from.
    I believe it would be better if the following os constants were mentioned instead:
     * SEEK_SET
     * SEEK_CUR
     * SEEK_END
