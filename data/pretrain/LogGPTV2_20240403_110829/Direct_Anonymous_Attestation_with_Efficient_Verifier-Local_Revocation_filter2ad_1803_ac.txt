To analyze the computational complexity in a DAA scheme, we
divide the operations into two classes—(1) offline, and (2) online.
All the operations which can be pre-computed or stored, and do
not need to be generated in real time are classified as offline op-
erations. The offline operations include the computations at the
TPM, the host and the issuer for establishing the platform’s mem-
bership and/or login credentials. The operations which need to
be performed in real time are classified as online operations. The
online operations include the computations at the TPM and the
host for generating the login signature, and the computations at the
verifier for verifying the signature. Table 1 presents the number of
computationally expensive offline and online operations performed
by each entity in the two DAA schemes. In LASER, the total offline
computational complexities are computed by summing the com-
putational complexities in the MemCreGen and the LogCreGen
protocols. In Table 1, we observe that the computational complexi-
ties of the offline operations in CDL-EPID and LASER are O(1) and
O(ms), respectively. Most importantly, in Table 1, we observe that
the computational complexities of the platform’s online operations
are O(mr) in CDL-EPID as compared to O(1) in LASER. Although
the computational complexity of verifier’s online operations are
O(mr) in CDL-EPID as well as LASER, we note that the verifiers
(service providers) have access to servers with large computational
resources, and hence they are able to handle the online operations.
To analyze the communication overhead in a DAA scheme, we
divide the communications into two classes—(1) offline, and (2) on-
line. All the communications which can be pre-shared and stored,
and do not need to be performed in real time are classified as offline
communications. The offline communication overhead includes the
communication from the platform to the issuer for sending the sig-
natures with requests for the membership and/or login credentials
(represented by p-i-sig). It also includes the communication from
the issuer to the platform for sending the membership and/or login
credentials (represented by i-p-cre), and the revocation list (repre-
sented by i-p-rev). Further, it includes the communication from the
issuer to the verifier for sending the revocation list (represented
by i-v-rev). The communications which need to be performed in
real time are classified as online communications. The online com-
munication overhead includes the communication between the
platform and the verifier for communicating the login signature
(represented by p-v-sig). Table 2 presents the number of offline
and online elements communicated between the entities in the two
DAA schemes. In LASER, the offline communication overheads
are computed by summing the communication overheads in the
MemCreGen and the LogCreGen protocols. In Table 2, we observe
that the online communication overhead increases by O(mr) in
CDL-EPID as compared to O(1) in LASER.
4 IMPLEMENTATION RESULTS
We assume an illustrative application where one million users are
subscribed at the issuer in an online subscription service. The users
are required to renew their subscription every month which con-
sists of 30 days. Each user (platform) sends login requests to ten
providers (verifiers) per day, and generates one login signature cor-
responding to the request to each provider per day. This means that
the total number of login signatures generated per day by a user is
ten. Moreover, we assume that 0.2 percent of the laptop platforms
belonging to the users are revoked every month because they are
lost or stolen [27]. This means that over the period of a month,
the number of revoked platforms increases from 0 to 2000. In this
illustrative scenario, we consider and analyze the following four de-
ployment cases—(1) CDL-EPID, (2) LASER-A: LASER with absolute
unlinkability, i.e., ms = 300, (3) LASER-B: LASER with conditional
unlinkability where the issuer can link some login signatures, i.e.,
ms = 30, and (4) LASER-C: LASER with conditional unlinkability
where the issuer can link all the login signatures, i.e., ms = 1.
We obtain the computational overheads in the above deploy-
ment cases by implementing them on a Lenovo laptop with 2.6
GHz Intel i7 6600U CPU. We leverage OpenSSL, the pairing-based
cryptography (PBC) library [26], and IBM Trusted Software Stack
(TSS) for TPM 2.0 [19] to prototype CDL-EPID and LASER in C.
The prototypes of the TPM and the host in LASER (available at
[17]) comprise of 600 and 1800 lines of code, respectively. The total
development time of the prototypes was around 1000 man-hours.
We utilize the Barreto-Naehrig (BN) curve which is standardized for
DAA by the TCG [2]. Specifically, we utilize the “Type F” internal
described in PBC library which is constructed on the curve of the
form y2 = x3 + 3 with embedding degree 12 where the lengths
of an element in Z∗
p and G1 are 256 bits and 512 bits, respectively.
With this curve, the DAA implemented with TPM 2.0 specification
provides 85 bits of security [10].
By averaging over 100 iterations, we obtain the running time
in milliseconds (ms) for different protocols in LASER and CDL-
EPID. Our results indicate that with mr = 1000, the time taken
to generate a signature is only 348 ms in LASER-A, LASER-B and
LASER-C as compared to 342,112 ms in CDL-EPID. Further, in
Table 3, we present the monthly computational costs of the offline
and online operations in the four cases when the number of revoked
platforms increases from 0 to 2000 over the month. In Table 3,
we observe that the offline computational costs in LASER-A and
LASER-B are significantly higher than that in CDL-EPID, while the
offline computational cost in LASER-C is only slightly higher than

that in CDL-EPID. From Table 3, we note that significantly lower
online computational cost in LASER-A, LASER-B and LASER-C
as compared to CDL-EPID is achieved at the cost of higher offline
computational cost. Table 4 presents the monthly online and offline
communication overheads in the four cases in the aforementioned
scenario. We observe that LASER-B and LASER-C result in the
same online communication cost, but significantly lower offline
communication costs when compared to LASER-A. We also observe
that LASER-A, LASER-B and LASER-C are more than two orders
of magnitude more efficient than CDL-EPID in terms of the online
communication overhead.
From the above results, we observe that all the three deployment
scenarios of LASER incur significantly lower online overhead - in
terms of both computation and communication - compared to CDL-
DAA at the cost of higher offline overhead. This trade-off between
offline and online computational and communication costs is very
advantageous because the online computational and communica-
tion occur significantly more often than the offline ones. Also, as
the online procedure require significantly lower latency than the of-
fline procedure, LASER is more practical than CDL-EPID when mr
is large. Another noteworthy attribute of LASER is its realization of
the security notion that we refer to as adaptable unlinkability (see
Apendix A). LASER is capable of increasing both the computational
and communication efficiency of the underlying DAA protocol by
relaxing the notion of absolute unlinkability (which is provided by
LASER-A) to realize conditional unlinkability (which is provided
by LASER-B and LASER-C).
5 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we proposed a novel DAA scheme called LASER
which supports verifier-local revocation, and can be utilized to
realize the anonymous subscription system. We have shown that
LASER achieves a significant performance improvement over the
prior art by shifting most of the computational and communication
overhead at the platform from its online protocol to its offline pro-
tocol. We have evaluated LASER through analytical analysis as well
as through an actual implementation on a TPM cryptoprocessor.
