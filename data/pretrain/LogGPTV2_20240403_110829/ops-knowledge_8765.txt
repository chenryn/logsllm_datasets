To effectively implement CIS Control 3.9, "Encrypt Data on Removable Media," an organization should follow these main procedures:

1. **Policy Development**: Establish a clear and comprehensive policy that mandates the encryption of all data stored on removable media. This policy should be communicated to all relevant stakeholders and enforced consistently.

2. **Encryption Standards**: Select and adopt robust encryption standards and algorithms, such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with a key length of at least 256 bits, to ensure the security of the data.

3. **Tool Selection and Deployment**: Choose and deploy reliable encryption tools and software that are compatible with the organization's existing IT infrastructure. Ensure that these tools are user-friendly and can be easily integrated into the workflow.

4. **Training and Awareness**: Provide regular training and awareness programs for employees to educate them on the importance of data encryption, the proper use of encryption tools, and the potential risks associated with unencrypted data on removable media.

5. **Access Controls**: Implement strict access controls and authentication mechanisms to ensure that only authorized personnel can access and decrypt the data stored on removable media.

6. **Monitoring and Auditing**: Regularly monitor and audit the use of removable media and the effectiveness of the encryption measures. This includes tracking who is using the media, what data is being encrypted, and ensuring compliance with the established policies.

7. **Incident Response Plan**: Develop and maintain an incident response plan to address any breaches or unauthorized access to encrypted data on removable media. This plan should include steps for containment, investigation, and remediation.

By following these procedures, an organization can effectively protect its data on removable media, aligning with the "Protect" function of CIS Control 3.9 and ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information.
