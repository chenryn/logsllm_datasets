I have written a Python script that I would like to share with other users. I prefer to keep it as a script rather than an executable, so that users can modify the code if needed. However, my script relies on several external Python libraries that are not included in the standard Python distribution. Additionally, the target users may not have Python installed on their systems.

To simplify the process for these users, I am considering creating a single installer that would handle the installation of both Python and the necessary external libraries. All the installers are Windows x86 MSI installers, and there are about 5 or 6 of them. The users are using Windows XP Professional 32-bit, and the Python version is 2.7.

Is it possible to create such a combined installer? If so, what are the potential drawbacks?

### Assistant: 

Creating a single installer that combines multiple MSI installers (including Python and the required external libraries) is indeed possible. This type of combined installer is often referred to as a "bootstrapper." Hereâ€™s a detailed look at how you can achieve this and the potential drawbacks:

#### Possible Solutions

1. **WiX Toolset with Burn:**
   - **Description:** WiX (Windows Installer XML) is a powerful tool for building Windows installation packages. The Burn feature in WiX allows you to create a bootstrapper that can chain together multiple MSI installations.
   - **Pros:**
     - Open-source and free.
     - Highly customizable.
     - Supports a wide range of installation scenarios.
   - **Cons:**
     - Can be complex to set up and configure, especially for beginners.
     - Requires some learning and familiarity with XML and the WiX toolset.

2. **InstallShield Premier:**
   - **Description:** InstallShield is a commercial tool that supports the creation of setup suites, which can bundle multiple MSIs into a single installer.
   - **Pros:**
     - User-friendly interface.
     - Comprehensive features and support.
   - **Cons:**
     - Expensive.
     - Overkill for simple projects.

3. **NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System):**
   - **Description:** NSIS is a free, open-source system for creating Windows installers. It is highly flexible and can be used to create a bootstrapper that installs multiple MSIs.
   - **Pros:**
     - Free and open-source.
     - Lightweight and easy to use.
   - **Cons:**
     - Requires scripting knowledge.
     - May not be as feature-rich as commercial tools.

4. **Advanced Installer:**
   - **Description:** Advanced Installer is another commercial tool that supports the creation of bootstrappers and setup bundles.
   - **Pros:**
     - Easy to use with a graphical interface.
     - Good balance of features and cost.
   - **Cons:**
     - Not free, but more affordable than InstallShield.

#### Potential Drawbacks

1. **Complexity:**
   - Creating a bootstrapper can be complex, especially if you need to handle dependencies, error conditions, and user interactions smoothly.
   
2. **Uninstallation:**
   - Managing the uninstallation of the bundled components can be challenging. You need to ensure that all components can be uninstalled individually or as a group, and that the uninstallation process is seamless.

3. **Error Handling:**
   - If one of the MSIs fails to install, you need to handle the error gracefully and provide a way for the user to resolve the issue or roll back the installation.

4. **Reboots:**
   - Some MSIs may require a system reboot. Your bootstrapper needs to handle this and resume the installation process after the reboot.

5. **Maintenance:**
   - Updating the bootstrapper and the individual MSIs can be more complicated compared to managing them separately.

#### Conclusion

Creating a combined installer using a tool like WiX with Burn or NSIS is feasible and can greatly simplify the installation process for your users. However, it comes with its own set of challenges, particularly around error handling and uninstallation. If you are comfortable with scripting and configuration, WiX with Burn is a robust and free option. For a more user-friendly experience, you might consider a commercial tool like Advanced Installer.

If you decide to proceed, make sure to thoroughly test the combined installer to ensure it works seamlessly on Windows XP Professional 32-bit.
