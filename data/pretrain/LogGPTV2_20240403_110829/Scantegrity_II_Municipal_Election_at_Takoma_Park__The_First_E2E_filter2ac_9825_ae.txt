### Voter Challenges and Feedback

1. **Verification Option Awareness**: Some voters were unaware of the verification option.
2. **Writing Down Code Numbers**: Some did not realize they needed to write down the code numbers.
3. **Pen Usage Confusion**: Some found the pens confusing, not realizing that the pens would expose code numbers and unsure which end to use.
4. **Code Number Readability**: Some found the code numbers difficult to read.
5. **IRV Ballot Marking**: Some did not understand how to mark an Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) ballot.
6. **Ballot Scanning**: Some did not know how to place the ballot into the scanner.
7. **Privacy Concerns**: One voter had no difficulty but expressed concern about the government potentially linking their IP address used during verification with their ballot serial number, thereby discerning their vote. This could be possible if the cryptography is compromised or in other scenarios, but it would be more direct for the scanner to log how they voted.
8. **Suggested Improvements**: Many suggested that better instructions, including while waiting in line, would have been helpful.

### Survey Results

Figure 3 illustrates voter responses to four questions from the field study questionnaire. The results strongly indicate that voters found the voting system easy to use (Question 5) and had confidence in the system (Question 13). Question 10 showed that the option to check votes online increased voter confidence in the election results. Question 9 indicated that voters were confident that the receipt alone did not reveal their vote, a notable finding given the widespread belief that many people erroneously think all end-to-end (E2E) receipts reveal ballot choices. A detailed analysis of the complete survey data will be presented in a separate companion paper.

### Poll Worker Experiences

Each of the twelve poll workers was provided with an addressed and stamped envelope containing two questionnaires (field study and demographics) to complete and return after the election. The field study focused on their experiences administering Scantegrity, with most answers rated on a seven-point Likert scale. Five forms were returned. Poll workers noted the following difficulties:

1. **Information Overload**: There was too much information.
2. **Voter Understanding**: Some voters did not understand what to do, including how to create a receipt.
3. **IRV Ballot Marking**: Some voters did not understand how to mark an IRV ballot.
4. **Privacy Sleeve Usability**: The privacy sleeve was hard to use with one hand.
5. **Pen Confusion**: The double-ended pens caused confusion.
6. **Different Needs**: Voters, poll workers, and the Scantegrity team have different needs. One wondered if Scantegrity was worth the extra trouble.

They offered the following suggestions:

1. **Simplify the Ballot**: Simplify the ballot design.
2. **Provide Receipts**: Provide receipts so that voters do not have to copy code numbers.
3. **Pre-Election Education**: Develop better pre-election voter education.

### Discussion and Lessons Learned

Overall, this project should be considered a success: the goals of the election were met, and there were no major issues. Many aspects of the Scantegrity design and implementation worked well, while some areas need improvement for future elections.

#### Technology Challenges

The most challenging aspect for future elections is scaling up ballot printing. The printers used were not very reliable. Variations on the Scantegrity design worth exploring include printing voter receipts (rather than having voters copy confirmation codes by hand), which has clear security implications. The design should also be extended for better accessibility. The special pen might be improved by having only a single medium-tip point, rather than two tips of different sizes. The scanning operation and its interaction with the privacy sleeve should be studied and improved.

#### Website and Scanner Enhancements

The website, while sufficient, could benefit from existing research in distributed systems to reduce the expectations on observers and voters. The scanner could be improved with more sophisticated image analysis and better handling of unreadable ballots. It occurred to us after the election that the write-in resolution process could have greater utility if expanded to deal with unreadable and unclear ballots.

#### Real-World Deployment

As with many projects, too much was left until the last minute. Better project management and earlier finalization of key aspects would have been beneficial. Materials and procedures should be more extensively tested beforehand.

#### Collaboration and Communication

One of the most important lessons learned is the value of close collaboration and clear communication between election officials and the election system providers (whether researchers or vendors).

#### Voter Education

It is crucial to provide voters with clear explanations of the new features of a voting system, efficiently and with minimal impact on throughput. Resolving this tension requires further exploration. For example, an instructional video explaining the Scantegrity system that voters could watch as they come in might be worthwhile. The permanent adoption of Scantegrity II in a jurisdiction would alleviate the educational burden over time as voters learn the system’s features in successive elections.

### Comparison with Post-Election Audits

It is interesting to compare Scantegrity with post-election audits, another major technique for election outcome verification. Post-election audits do not allow anyone to check that a particular ballot was counted correctly, thus not providing the same level of integrity guarantee as Scantegrity. Post-election audits, even those with redundant digital and physical records like optical scan systems, only address errors or malfeasance in the counting of votes, not in the chain of custody. In contrast, end-to-end voting systems like Scantegrity provide a "verifiable chain of custody." Voters can check that their ballots are included in the tally, and anyone—not just a privileged group of auditors—can check that those ballots are tallied as intended.

While Scantegrity II provides additional integrity benefits, it comes at the cost of increased complexity and a manageable risk to voter privacy (since ballots are uniquely identifiable). However, some jurisdictions and/or election systems already require or use serial numbers on ballots, and we have proposed several approaches to appropriately destroy or obfuscate serial number information. Furthermore, a voter wishing to "fingerprint" a ballot can do so without detection in current paper ballot systems simply by marking ovals in distinctive ways.

### Conclusions

Traditional optical scan (opscan) voting systems clearly benefit from allowing voters to verify that their ballots are correctly filled out. However, once cast, voters must trust others to safely collect and correctly count the ballots. With end-to-end voting systems, these operations (collecting and counting ballots) are verifiable as well. Voters can use their receipt and a website to verify that their ballot is safely collected, and anyone can use the website data to verify that the ballots have been correctly counted.

The authors would like to acknowledge the contributions of the voters of Takoma Park, the City Clerk, the Assistant City Clerk, all Board of Elections members since 2008, and the independent auditors—Lillie Coney, Ben Adida, and Filip Zagórski—to the success of the election. Vivek Relan and Bhushan Sonawane timed voters and helped assemble the privacy sleeves. Lynn Baumeister interviewed some voters as they left the precinct. Cory Jones provided general assistance, and Alex Florescu and Jan Rubio assisted with ink creation.
