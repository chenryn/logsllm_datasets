Some were unaware of veriﬁcation option. (2) Some did
not realize they were supposed to write down codenum-
bers.
(3) Some found the pens confusing to use: they
did not realize that the pens would expose codenumbers,
and they did not know which end to use. (4) Some found
codenumbers were hard to read. (5) Some did not under-
stand how to mark an IRV ballot. (6) Some did not know
how to place the ballot into the scanner. (7) One had no
difﬁculty but wondered if seniors or people who speak
neither English nor Spanish might have difﬁculties. (8)
One wondered if the government might be able to discern
his vote by linking his IP address used during veriﬁcation
with his ballot serial number and noting the time that he
was issued a ballot (this may be possible if the cryptogra-
phy is broken or in other scenarios, but it would be more
direct to have the scanner log how he voted). (9) Many
13
suggested that it would have been helpful to have better
instructions, including instruction while they wait in line.
Figure 3 shows how voters responded to four ques-
tions from the ﬁeld study questionnaire. These results
strongly show that voters found the voting system easy
to use (Question 5), and that they had conﬁdence in the
system (Question 13). Question 10 showed that the op-
tion to check votes on line increased voter conﬁdence in
the election results. Question 9 showed that voters had
conﬁdence that the receipt alone did not reveal how they
voted; this ﬁnding is notable given that it is widely sus-
pected that many people erroneously believe that all E2E
receipts reveal ballot choices. We plan to present detailed
analysis of our complete survey data in a separate com-
panion paper.
Survey of Poll Worker Experiences Each of the
twelve poll workers was given an addressed and stamped
envelope with two questionnaires (ﬁeld study and demo-
graphics) to ﬁll out and mail to the researchers after the
election. The ﬁeld study focused on their experiences ad-
ministering Scantegrity, with most answer expressed on
a seven-point Likert scale. This questionnaire also in-
cluded four open-ended questions. Each pair of forms
had matching serial numbers. Five forms were returned.
Poll workers noted the following difﬁculties. (1) There
was too much information. (2) Some voters did not un-
derstand what to do, including how to create a receipt.
(3) Some voters did not understand how to mark an IRV
ballot. (4) The privacy sleeve was hard to use with one
hand. (5) The double-ended pens created confusion. (6)
Voters, poll workers, and the Scantegrity team have dif-
ferent needs. One wondered if Scantegrity was worth the
extra trouble.
They offered the following suggestions: (1) Simplify
the ballot. (2) Provide receipts so that voters do not have
to copy codenumbers.
(3) Develop better pre-election
voter education.
8 Discussion and Lessons Learned
the
Overall, this project should be deemed a success:
goals of the election were met, and there were no ma-
jor snafus. Many aspects of the Scantegrity design and
implementation worked well, while some could be im-
proved in future elections.
Technology Challenges Perhaps the most challenging
aspect for future elections is scaling up ballot printing.
The printers we used were not very reliable.
Variations on the Scantegrity design worth exploring
include the printing of voter receipts (rather than hav-
ing voters copy conﬁrmation codes by hand)—there are
clearly security aspects to handle if one does this. The
design should also be extended for better accessibility.
The special pen might be improved by having only a sin-
gle medium-tip point, rather than two tips of different
sizes. The scanning operation and its interaction with
the privacy sleeve should be studied and improved.
The website, while sufﬁcient, might utilize existing re-
search in distributed systems to reduce the expectations
on observers and voters. The scanner could also be im-
proved with more sophisticated image analysis, and also
to better handle unreadable ballots. It only occured to
us after the election that the write-in resolution process
could have greater utility if it were expanded to deal with
unreadable and unclear ballots.
Real World Deployment of Research Systems As is
common with many projects, too much was left until
the last minute. Better project management would have
been helpful, and key aspects should have been ﬁnalized
earlier. Materials and procedures should be more exten-
sively tested beforehand.
One of the most important lessons learned is the
value of close collaboration and clear communication be-
tween election ofﬁcials and the election system providers
(whether they be researchers or vendors).
Another lesson learned is that it is both important to
provide voters with clear explanations of the new fea-
tures of a voting system, and to do so efﬁciently, with
minimal impact on throughput. Resolving the tension
between these requirements deﬁnitely needs further ex-
ploration. For example, it might be worthwhile to have
an instructional video explaining the Scantegrity system
that voters could watch as they come in. The permanent
adoption of Scantegrity II in a jurisdiction would, how-
ever, alleviate the educational burden over time, as voters
learn the system’s features in successive elections.
Comparison with post-election audits
It is interest-
ing to compare Scantegrity with the other major tech-
nique for election outcome veriﬁcation: post-election au-
dits. Because these audits do not allow anyone to check
that a particular ballot was counted correctly, they do
not provide the level of integrity guarantee provided by
Scantegrity.
Post-election audits, even those with redundant digital
and physical records like optical scan systems, only ad-
dress errors or malfeasance in the counting of votes and
not in the chain of custody. 19
In contrast, end-to-end
19Having multiple records may make an attacker’s job harder, but
note that the attacker only has to change the record that will ultimately
be used and/or trusted (not necessarily both). Also, redudancy can work
against a system, as changing a digital record in an obviously malicious
way may allow time for a more subtle manipulation of the physical
record.

Figure 3: Voter responses to Survey Questions 5, 9, 10, 13 from all 271 voters completing the survey. Using a seven-
point Likert scale, voters indicated how strongly they agreed or disagreed with each statement about the voting system
they had just used (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree). Each histogram shows the number of voters responding
for each of the seven agreement levels. The four questions shown are the following: (5) Overall, the voting system was
easy to use. (9) I have conﬁdence that my receipt by itself does not reveal how I voted. (10) The option to verify my
vote online afterwards increases my conﬁdence in the election results. (13) I have conﬁdence in this voting system.
voting systems such as Scantegrity provide a “veriﬁable
chain of custody.” Voters can check that their ballots are
included in the tally, and anyone—not just a privileged
group of auditors—can check that those ballots are tal-
lied as intended.
It must be admitted, however, that the additional in-
tegrity beneﬁts provided by Scantegrity II come at the
cost of somewhat increased complexity and at the cost
of an increased (but manageable) risk to voter privacy
(since ballots are uniquely identiﬁable). That said, some
jurisdictions and/or election systems require or use serial
numbers on ballots anyway, and we have proposed sev-
eral possible approaches to appropriately destroy or ob-
fuscate serial number information. Furthermore, it can
be argued that a voter wishing to ”ﬁngerprint” a ballot
can do so without being detected in current paper ballot
systems simply by marking ovals in distinctive ways.
II voting system provides such end-to-end veriﬁcation
capability as an overlay on top of traditional opscan tech-
nology. Further development should improve scalability
(esp. printing), usability (e.g. with printed receipts) and
accessibility of the Scantegrity II system.
The successful use of the Scantegrity II voting sys-
tem in the Takoma Park election of November 3, 2009
demonstrates that voters and election ofﬁcials can use so-
phisticated cryptographic techniques to organize a trans-
parent secret ballot election with a familiar voting experi-
ence. The election results show considerable satisfaction
by both voters and pollworkers, indicating that end-to-
end voting technology has matured to the point of being
ready and usable for real binding governmental elections.
This paper thus documents a signiﬁcant step forward in
the security and integrity of voting systems as used in
practice.
9 Conclusions
Traditional opscan voting systems have the clear bene-
ﬁt that “votes are veriﬁably cast as intended”—the voter
can see for herself that the ballot is correctly ﬁlled out.
Yet once her ballot is cast, the voter must place her trust
in others that ballots are safely collected and correctly
counted. With end-to-end voting systems these last two
operations (collecting ballots and counting them) are ver-
iﬁable as well: voters can verify—using their receipt and
a website—that their ballot is safely collected with the
others, and anyone can use the website data to verify that
the ballots have been correctly counted. The Scantegrity
