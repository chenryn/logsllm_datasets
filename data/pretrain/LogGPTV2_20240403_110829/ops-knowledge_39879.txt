User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Working from many places  being able to restrict SSH access to server to IP range I administer a webserver, and while I'd like to restrict the SSH access to an IP range, I wouldn't be able to do so because a) I travel a lot and b) I don't have a static IP at my homeoffice.

I've thought of using a VPN service like ProXPN, which I'll certainly do to increase the security of the connection from less secure places, but then everybody on the same VPN server could also try to connect. While this would definitely be more secure than leaving the port open to everyone, it still doesn't seem like a solution that'd make me happy, also because I wouldn't be able to access my server while the VPN service is down.

Any ideas?

Thanks a lot

Assistant: Setup ssh key authentication and disable password authentication (ensure you don't lock out yourself!)

In order to log in, an attacker would need to prove they own the same ssh key as you, which -barring bugs such as the debian fail- would be infeasible.
