When the FGD participants were asked to explain what they understood by the 
“truth”, they were of the view that the “truth is a statement that describes reality 
without any embellishment, no addition or subtraction”. (FGD 1)
Truth  is  saying  the  right  thing.  A  statement  that  can  be  supported 
with facts or proof. It is simply the reality and has no element of lie or 
doubt. It is always uttered in confidence and clear conscience. Truth is 
a statement that conforms to the reality and not otherwise. (FGD 1)
The study further showed that 48.0% of the traditional leaders were of the view 
that the truth was not told at the TRC, while 38.0% believed the truth was told. 
On the other hand, the majority of the religious leaders, 61.5%, believed that the 
truth  was  told  during  the  proceedings  while  only  19.2%  believed  that  the  truth 
was either not told or that it was only partially told. Nevertheless, 46.1% of the 
total sample believed that the truth was told during the TRC proceedings. Among 
the traditional leaders, 36.8% were of the view that some facts were not revealed 
while 31.6% believed that some people lied and that the TRC process was a failure. 
46.1% of the traditional leaders believed that the truth would have or could have 
been ensured if those that gave evidence were asked to swear on the Bible or Koran.

However, and importantly, a significant number, 38.2%, believed that administer-
ing the oath in a shrine would have encouraged people to speak the whole truth. On 
what they understood by reconciliation in a post conflict society, an overwhelming 
number  of  the  survey  respondents,  83.9%,  explained  that  reconciliation  involves 
accepting  former  opponents;  33.3%  understood  reconciliation  to  mean  bringing 
people together in the spirit of forgiveness for past wrongs, while 32.8% said “it is 
uniting former enemies in a harmonious way”. Finally, while 38.2% of the tradi-
tional and religious leaders believed that the TRC promoted reconciliation, 32.9% 
of both groups were of the view that it did not (Table 6). What is significant to note 
here is the unanimity among the respondents on what constitutes reconciliation. It 
is obvious from their responses that they all had a clear idea of what reconciliation 
was in the circumstances of Sierra Leone at the time of the interviews and focus 
group discussions.

More important, is the fact 70.9% of all the respondents believed that the present 
peace in the country would endure, while 29.1% believed that such optimism was 
not borne out by the realities on the ground.
Reconciliation  in  the  understanding  of  some  FGD  participants  represents  a 
process of fence – mending between two or more individuals or groups in conflict.
It means bringing together again two or more conflicting parties in or-
der to settle their differences. Reconciliation is a process of fostering peace 
among people who are enemies. It is a process restoring unity. (FGD 2)

Nonetheless, some FGD participants were of the view that the TRC only partially fa-
cilitated reconciliation and that the wounds of the war were only partially healed.
Some of the wounds are so deep that they will need the grace of God to be 
totally healed. To heal the wounds I think is not even in the mandate of 
the TRC given the length of time they had which was too short. (FGD 5)
9.6 Knowledge of perpetrators and victims
More  than  half  of  the  elites,  55.3%,  a  very  high  82.3%  of  the  members  of  the 
public, and 71.3% of the other categories of respondents, revealed that they knew 
someone who was involved in the war. Slightly more than half of the respondents, 
51.6% of the elites and members of the public confirmed that they knew some of 
those who were killed, and also confirmed that among those that they knew, 23.7% 
were amputated, while 20.4% lost all their property. Among the elites and members 
of the public, 35.9% and 87.1% respectively, confirmed that they lost valuable prop-
erty on account of the war. However, 64.1% of the elites and 12.9% of members 
of the public stated that they did not lose any property to the war. When asked to 
describe the type of property lost to the war, 65.2% of those interviewed confirmed 
that it was household property while only 15.2% said they lost academic materials 
and documents. More interesting is the fact that 76.9% of those who said they did 
not lose any property to the war attributed it to God’s providence, 15.4% said they 
did not live in places hit hard by the war while only 7.7% said they were not in the 
country during the war.
Unfortunately, a simple majority of the respondents, 58.2%, agreed that they 
lost loved ones to the war, while 41.2% said they did not lose any close relation. Of 
those who lost relatives and friends, 13.4% said they lost uncles (Table 7).

Of the relatives whose limbs were amputated, those who lost a leg were 29.6%; while 
25.9% lost both hands, and 18.5% lost one hand. Among the elites and members of
