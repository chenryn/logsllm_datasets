User: In Linux, how to use systemctl to manage system services?
Assistant: systemctl is a service management tool under Linux, which is used to control the start, stop, restart and status query of system services. The following is an example of using systemctl to manage system services: 1. Start a service sudo systemctl start servicename.service 2. Stop a service sudo systemctl stop servicename.service 3. Restart a service sudo systemctl restart servicename.service 4. Check the status of a service sudo systemctl status servicename.service 5. Set the service to start automatically at boot sudo systemctl enable servicename.service 6. Disable the service to start automatically at boot sudo systemctl disable servicename.service 7. View all started services sudo systemctl list-units --type=service 8. View all available services sudo systemctl list-unit-files --type=service In the above command, servicename is the name of the service, such as httpd, ssh, etc. If you need to control other types of units, such as socket, mount, etc., you can replace service in the above command with the corresponding type. For example: sudo systemctl start socketname.socket sudo systemctl start mountname.mount sudo systemctl status devicename.device Using systemctl to manage services is one of the important operations in Linux system management, mastering its usage can improve the work efficiency of system administrators.
