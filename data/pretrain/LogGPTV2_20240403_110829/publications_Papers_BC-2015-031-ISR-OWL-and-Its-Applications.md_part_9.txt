 easy. Ontologies and logic enable and support these
 approaches. By using mappings, the data structures
 are linked to a uniform ontology, providing a common,
 holistic view on the data. Combining ontologies with
 existing business logic makes new business insights
 available. Information integration makes processes
 easier, faster, less expensive and more understandable
