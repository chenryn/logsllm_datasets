**ATT&CK ID:** T1592.002  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Gather Victim Host Software Information

Adversaries may collect information about the software installed on a victim's host, which can be used to inform and refine their targeting strategies. This information may include various details such as the types and versions of software installed on specific hosts, as well as the presence of additional security components that might indicate enhanced defensive measures (e.g., antivirus software, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems, etc.). Understanding the software environment allows adversaries to tailor their attacks more effectively, potentially exploiting known vulnerabilities or avoiding detection by existing security solutions.
