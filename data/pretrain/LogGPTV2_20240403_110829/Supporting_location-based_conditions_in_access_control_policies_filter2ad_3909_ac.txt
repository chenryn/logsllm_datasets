### Management of a Mobile Network

Managing a nationwide mobile network is a highly critical activity. Reconfiguration privileges must be granted only to strictly selected personnel and must adhere to the highest security standards. Additionally, access to logging and billing data is also critical, as these include information about the positions and movements of the mobile operator's customers. While we consider access to customer-related information less critical than reconfiguration privileges, it still requires handling in a highly secured environment and should be granted only to selected personnel, in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. At a lower criticality level, access to statistical data about the network’s operation must also be protected, for example, from disclosure to competitors.

We assume that the Mobile Network Console (MNC) is a software service that allows for reconfiguration of the mobile network and reading of customer data. Below are some examples of protection requirements for such a service, along with the corresponding access control rules (Table 2).

1. **System Administrators (Role=Admin)**: With a valid account, system administrators are authorized to configure the mobile network if they are in the server farm room, alone, and moving at walking speed or slower.
   - **Conditions**:
     - `user.Role=Admin`
     - `inarea(sim, Server Farm Room)`
     - `density(sim, Server Farm Room, 1, 1)`
     - `velocity(sim, 0, 3)`

2. **System Administrators (Role=Admin)**: With a valid account, system administrators are authorized to read mobile network data if they are in the information systems department area, moving at walking speed or slower, and there is no one close by.
   - **Conditions**:
     - `user.Role=Admin`
     - `inarea(sim, Information Systems Dept.)`
     - `local density(sim, Close By, 1, 1)`
     - `velocity(sim, 0, 3)`

3. **CEO (Role=CEO)**: With a valid account, the CEO is authorized to access mobile network data if they are alone, in the corporate main office, and moving at walking speed or slower.
   - **Conditions**:
     - `user.Role=CEO`
     - `inarea(sim, Corporate Main Office)`
     - `local density(sim, Close By, 1, 1)`
     - `velocity(sim, 0, 3)`

4. **CEO (Role=CEO)**: With a valid account, the CEO is authorized to access mobile network statistics if there is no one close by and they are not in a competitor location.
   - **Conditions**:
     - `user.Role=CEO`
     - `disjoint(sim, Competitor Location)`
     - `local density(sim, Close By, 1, 1)`

5. **Guests (Role=Guest)**: With a valid account, guests can read mobile network statistics if there is no one close by and they are in a corporate location.
   - **Conditions**:
     - `user.Role=Guest`
     - `inarea(sim, Corporate Location)`
     - `local density(sim, Close By, 1, 1)`

### Policy Evaluation and Enforcement

#### From Confidence to Truth Values

Before discussing how the access control process operates, we need to address the basic problem of transforming location-based predicates into boolean values. The responses to boolean location queries are in the form of a triple `[bool value, confidence, timeout]`. The Access Control Engine (ACE) must assign a truth value to these responses based on the parameters `timeout` and `confidence`.

- **Timeout**: If the timeout has expired, the predicate is automatically re-evaluated, regardless of other parameter values.
- **Confidence**: If the timeout has not expired, the confidence value is compared with two thresholds (lower and upper) specific to each location predicate. Based on this comparison, the boolean value in the response is treated differently.

The confidence value has a semantics of belief; a response returning a boolean value `v` with a confidence of `α` is equivalent to a response returning `¬v` with a confidence of `1 - α`.

The Extended True Table (ETT) in Table 3 provides custom confidence thresholds for each predicate. The ETT is used as follows:
- If the confidence level is greater than the upper threshold, the boolean value returned by the Location Service is confirmed.
- If the confidence level is below the lower threshold, the boolean value is not confirmed, and the location-based condition is evaluated to `¬bool value`.
- If the confidence level is between the lower and upper thresholds, neither the returned value nor its negation is considered reliable, and the predicate is re-evaluated. This re-evaluation is limited by a `MaxTries` number to avoid deadlock.

#### Function Solve

To perform the mapping of boolean query responses into boolean values, we define a function `Solve` that enforces the described semantics. The function takes as input a predicate name with its parameters and a Location Service, and returns a value in the set `{True, False, Undefined}`.

```python
Function Solve(pred-name(p1, ..., pn), LS):
    {True, False, Undefined}
    upper := ETT[pred-name, upper]
    lower := ETT[pred-name, lower]
    maxtries := ETT[pred-name, MaxTries]
    response := Undefined
    tries := 0
    repeat
        Send query pred-name(p1, ..., pn) to LS
        Receive Reply = [bool value, confidence, timeout]
        if current-time < timeout then
            if confidence > upper then
                return bool value
            else if confidence < lower then
                return ¬bool value
            else
                tries := tries + 1
                if tries >= maxtries then
                    return response
```

#### Access Control Enforcement

The access control process operates as follows:

1. **Access Request Definition**: An access request is a 4-tuple `(user id, SIM, action, object id)`, where `user id` is the optional identifier of the user, `SIM` is the optional SIM card number, `action` is the requested action, and `object id` is the identifier of the object on which the action is to be performed.

2. **Policy Evaluation**:
   - The ACE first evaluates whether a decision can be taken locally based on generic conditions.
   - If local evaluation is insufficient, location-based queries are sent to the involved Location Service.

3. **Three-Phase Process**:
   - **Phase 1**: Collect all applicable rules from the policy `P` that match the access request.
   - **Phase 2**: Evaluate the collected rules using the `Solve` function to determine the truth values of location-based conditions.
   - **Phase 3**: Enforce the access control decision based on the evaluated rules.

By following these steps, the access control process ensures that only authorized personnel can perform critical actions and access sensitive data, maintaining the security and integrity of the mobile network.
