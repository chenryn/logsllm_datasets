Atom is incorrectly highlighting the javascript in this markdown that I am
writing. It's written like this because we're seeding, but, even though there
isn't a mismatched quote, it seems to think there is. This issue might be more
properly put on a package page, but I'm not sure which one to put it on. Also,
this happens whether or not I have soft wrap on. It's kinda weird, and doesn't
go away if Atom is killed and restarted.

Also, to make sure this isn't part of the debate, this is how it looks on
emacs. It's properly enclosed there, which tells me that it's Atom and not
that there is an unclosed quote there:

If I should submit this somewhere else, let me know.
