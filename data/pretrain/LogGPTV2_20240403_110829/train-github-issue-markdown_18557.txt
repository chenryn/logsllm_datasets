The select component in `1.0-beta.27` does not change selection to when you
type
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
When you have a select field selected and begin to type, it should change
selection to match what you typed.
## Current Behavior
Typing while a select is open does nothing.
