User: Is there any way to run a Python script in Windows XP without a command shell momentarily appearing? I often need to automate WordPerfect (for work) with Python, and even if my script has no output, if I execute it from without WP an empty shell still pops up for a second before disappearing. Is there any way to prevent this? Some kind of output redirection perhaps?
Assistant: I had the same problem. I tried many options, and all of them failed
But I tried this method, and it magically worked!!!!!
So, I had this python file (mod.py) in a folder, I used to run using command prompt
When I used to close the cmd the gui is automatically closed.....(SAD),
So I run it as follows 
C:\....>pythonw mod.py
Don't forget pythonw "w" is IMP
