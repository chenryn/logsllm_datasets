## From Dark Visitors to Valued Allies

### Introduction
Thank you for joining me today. This talk will begin shortly.

### About the Speaker
You may have seen me on the National Geographic TV show "Breakthrough" Season 2, where I demonstrated a bank robbery to highlight security vulnerabilities. Additionally, I have appeared in news segments discussing hacking and security-related topics. Unfortunately, some of you may have also encountered me in your server rooms... üòä

### What Does It Mean to Be a Hacker?
The term "hacker" often carries a negative connotation, but hackers provide a valuable service to society by discovering and reporting vulnerabilities. This proactive approach helps organizations improve their security measures.

### Why Are There No Black Hat Bankers?
If something is broken but not discovered, is it any less broken? The answer is no. The same principle applies to banking and other industries. However, the difference lies in the ethical framework. Hackers who report vulnerabilities (white hats) are helping, while those who exploit them (black hats) are causing harm.
