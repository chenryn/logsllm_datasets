title:blackhat:asia-22 Keynote: Quantify Security Effectively â€“  Moving the Security Needle From the  Security Trenches to the Boardroom
One of our biggest challenges in cybersecurity is determining return on investment and ultimately answering the question - are we moving the security needle? This challenge applies to the security engineer all the way up to the CISO and beyond. The reason why this challenge is so daunting is that at the end of the day cybersecurity is a game of risk management and quantifying risks is as much a science as it is an art form. Management will always aim to invest in the cybersecurity areas that have the best ROI and security engineers will aim to have the best technical ROI as they are in the trenches and have the best insights into the problems. These lenses are often different and lead to friction.George Do started his career as a cybersecurity incident responder at NASA. Now as a CISO, he has an appreciation for both security engineers in the trenches and leaders who are accountable for protecting their organization. George will discuss bridging this gap and the strategies that he has learned to set the security team up for success.
