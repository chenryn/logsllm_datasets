### Title: Black Hat Asia 22 Keynote: Effectively Quantifying Security â€“ Bridging the Gap from the Trenches to the Boardroom

One of the most significant challenges in cybersecurity is determining the return on investment (ROI) and ultimately answering the question: Are we making meaningful progress in enhancing security? This challenge spans from the security engineer to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) and beyond. The difficulty lies in the fact that cybersecurity is fundamentally a risk management exercise, and quantifying risks is as much an art as it is a science.

Management often prioritizes investments in cybersecurity areas with the highest ROI, while security engineers, who are on the front lines, focus on achieving the best technical ROI based on their deep understanding of the specific issues. These differing perspectives can create friction.

George Do, who began his career as a cybersecurity incident responder at NASA and is now a CISO, has a unique appreciation for both the challenges faced by security engineers in the trenches and the responsibilities of leaders accountable for protecting their organizations. In this keynote, George will share strategies he has developed to bridge this gap and set the security team up for success.
