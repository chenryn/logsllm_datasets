ABSTRACT
Mobile communication networks connect much of the world’s pop-
ulation. The security of users’ calls, SMSs, and mobile data depends
on the guarantees provided by the Authenticated Key Exchange
protocols used. For the next-generation network (5G), the 3GPP
group has standardized the 5G AKA protocol for this purpose.
We provide the first comprehensive formal model of a protocol
from the AKA family: 5G AKA. We also extract precise requirements
from the 3GPP standards defining 5G and we identify missing
security goals. Using the security protocol verification tool Tamarin,
we conduct a full, systematic, security evaluation of the model with
respect to the 5G security goals. Our automated analysis identifies
the minimal security assumptions required for each security goal
and we find that some critical security goals are not met, except
under additional assumptions missing from the standard. Finally,
we make explicit recommendations with provably secure fixes for
the attacks and weaknesses we found.

1 INTRODUCTION
Two thirds of the world’s population, roughly 5 billion people, are
mobile subscribers [24]. They are connected to the mobile network
via their USIM cards and are protected by security mechanisms
standardized by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)
group. Both subscribers and carriers expect security guarantees
from the mechanisms used, such as the confidentiality of user data
(e.g., voice and SMS) and that subscribers are billed only for the
services they consume. Moreover, these properties should hold in
an adversarial environment with malicious base stations and users.
One of the most important security mechanisms in place aims
at mutually authenticating subscribers and their carriers and es-
tablishing a secure channel to protect subsequent communication.
For network generations (3G and 4G) introduced since the year
2000, this is achieved using variants of the Authentication and Key
Agreement (AKA) protocol, standardized by the 3GPP. These proto-
cols involve the subscribers, the Serving Networks (SNs) that have
base stations in subscribers’ vicinity, and Home Networks (HNs)
that correspond to the subscribers’ carriers. The protocols aim to
enable the subscribers and the HNs to mutually authenticate each
other and to let the subscribers and the SNs establish a session key.
Next-Generation (5G). Since 2016, the 3GPP group has been stan-
dardizing the next generation of mobile communication (5G) with
the aim of increasing network throughput and offering an ambi-
tious infrastructure encompassing new use cases. The 5G standard
will be deployed in two phases. The first phase (Release 15, June
2018) addresses the most critical requirements needed for commer-
cial deployment and forms the basis for the first deployment. The
second phase (Release 16, to be completed by the end of 2019) will
address all remaining requirements.
In June 2018, the 3GPP published the final version v15.1.0 of Re-
lease 15 of the Technical Specification (TS) defining the 5G security
architecture and procedures [4]. The authentication in 5G Release
15 is based on new versions of the AKA protocols, notably the new
5G AKA protocol, which enhances the AKA protocol currently used
in 4G (EPS AKA) and which supposedly provides improved security
guarantees. This raises the following question: What are the security
guarantees that 5G AKA actually provides and under which threat
model and security assumptions?
Formal Methods. In this paper, we give a precise answer to the
above question. Namely, we apply formal methods and automated
verification in the symbolic model to determine precisely which
security guarantees are met by 5G AKA. Formal methods have al-
ready proved extremely valuable in assessing the security of large-
scale, real-world security protocols such as TLS 1.3 [10, 16, 18],
messaging protocols [26], and entity authentication protocols [6].
Symbolic approaches, in particular, allow one to automate reason-
ing using techniques including model-checking, resolution, and
rewriting. Examples of mature verification tools along these lines
are Tamarin [30], ProVerif [11], and DeepSec [14].
Unfortunately, the AKA protocols, and a fortiori 5G AKA, feature
a combination of properties that are extremely challenging for
state-of-the-art verification techniques and tools and, until very
recently, a detailed formalization was outside of their scope. First,
the flow and the state-machines of these protocols are large and
complex. This is due in part to the use of sequence numbers (SQN)
and the need for a re-synchronization mechanism should counters
become out-of-sync. This complexity is problematic for tools that
reason about a bounded number of sessions as they scale poorly

here. It also eliminates the option of machine-checked manual
proofs as the number of interactions is too large for humans to
explore. Second, these protocols are stateful (the SQN counters are
mutable and persist over multiple sessions) and have numerous
loops. This makes inductive reasoning necessary and rules out
fully automated tools, which are not yet capable of automatically
finding appropriate inductive invariants. Finally, the AKA protocols
use the Exclusive-OR (XOR) primitive to conceal some values. This
primitive is notoriously hard to reason about symbolically, due to its
algebraic properties (i.e., associativity, commutativity, cancellation,
and neutral element). For this reason, prior works provided only
limited models of the AKA protocols, which were insufficiently
precise for a satisfactory analysis; see the discussion on related
work below. Given these features, we are left with just the verifier
Tamarin [30] as a suitable tool, and Tamarin has only recently
been extended to handle XOR [21].
Contributions. We describe next our three main contributions:
our formalization, models, and analysis results.
Formalization of the 5G Standard. We extract and formally inter-
pret the standard’s security assumptions and goals. In doing so, we
identify key missing security goals and flaws in the stated goals. We
target a wide range of properties — confidentiality, authentication,
and privacy — and their fine-grained variants. As explained in Sec-
tions 2 and 3, this required considerable analysis and interpretation
of the 3GPP Technical Specification (722 pages across 4 documents).
Formal Model of 5G AKA. We tackle the aforementioned chal-
lenges to provide the first faithful model of an AKA protocol that is
detailed enough for a precise security analysis and is still amenable
to automation. As we explain in Section 4, the modeling choices
for formalizing our interpretation of the standard are crucial. To
support reasoning about our model, we develop dedicated proof
techniques based on inductive lemmas and proof strategies that
guide proof search.
Security Evaluation of 5G AKA. We carry out the first formal se-
curity evaluation of 5G authentication, providing a comprehensive
analysis of the 5G AKA protocol. This includes:
• a formal, systematic security evaluation: we leverage our
model of 5G AKA to automatically identify the minimal secu-
rity assumptions required for each security goal to hold. We
find that some critical authentication properties are violated
prior to key confirmation, which is not clearly mandated by
the standard. Some other properties are not met, except un-
der assumptions on the 5G ecosystem that are missing from
the standard. Additionally, we show that a privacy attack
(enabling traceability) is possible for an active attacker. See
the tables in Section 5.2 for details.
• recommendations: we make explicit recommendations and
propose provably secure fixes for the attacks and weaknesses
we identified. Most of our recommendations generalize to
5G Authentication as a whole, and not just 5G AKA.
We believe that our model of 5G AKA provides a valuable tool to
accompany the 5G standard’s evolution and assess the security
of future proposal updates and the standard’s evolution (e.g., 5G
phase 2). Our model can also serve as the basis for a comprehensive
formal comparison between AKA protocols from all generations,
providing precise answers to questions like “what guarantees does
one obtain, or lose, when moving from 4G to 5G?”
Related Work. Formal methods have been applied to AKA pro-
tocols in the past, but prior work provided only weak guarantees
due to the use of strong abstractions, protocol simplifications, and
limitations in the analyzed properties.
The initial AKA protocol specified for 3G was manually verified
by the 3GPP using TLA and an enhanced BAN logic [3]. The TLA
analysis focused on functional properties, like the protocol recovers
from de-synchronization. The short pen and paper proof, which
was given in an enhanced BAN logic, provides weak guarantees,
e.g., about key agreement and confidentiality, due to the logic’s
limitations. In particular, the logic does not account for, e.g., com-
promised agents and type-flaws, and it has had soundness issues
in the past [13]. Moreover, the proof considered a simplified proto-
col without SQN concealment or re-synchronization as SQNs were
always assumed to be synchronized. This misses, for example, the
privacy attack based on the desynchronization error message that
we observed.
ProVerif has also been used to formally check untraceabil-
ity and basic authentication properties of simplified AKA proto-
cols [5, 31]. These prior works acknowledge the challenges of for-
mally verifying AKA protocols but only offered limited solutions.
For instance, the SQN counters were abstracted away by nonces
that are initially shared by HNs and subscribers, thus reducing the
protocol to a stateless protocol. The re-synchronization procedure
was also omitted. The SNs and HNs were merged into a single entity.
Furthermore, XOR was either not modeled or was replaced by a
different construct with simpler algebraic properties. The resulting
protocol was thus overly simplified and corresponding analyses
would have missed the attacks we obtain in this paper (Table 1).
Moreover, the only authentication property that was checked is
mutual aliveness between subscribers and the network.
More recently, [25] proposed a model-based testing approach
that used ProVerif to carry out some analyses of EPS AKA from 4G.
However, in addition to using the same aforementioned abstractions
and simplifications, they only used ProVerif to check if specific
trace executions correspond to attack traces.
In summary, in stark contrast to previous work, we provide the
first faithful formalization of an AKA protocol. Namely, we for-
malize the entire protocol logic including the full protocol state
machine with all message flows and symbolic abstractions of all
cryptographic operators. This allows for the first comprehensive
formal analysis that characterizes the properties that are achieved
in different adversarial settings.
Outline. We present in Section 2 the cellular network architecture
and how authentication is achieved in the 5G ecosystem using
the 5G AKA protocol. We carry out a systematic formalization of
the security assumptions and goals of the standard in Section 3
and highlight shortcomings. In Section 4 we explain the basics of
the Tamarin verifier and our modeling and design choices. We
present our comprehensive security analysis of 5G AKA and our
recommendations in Section 5. We draw conclusions in Section 6.

2 5G AUTHENTICATION PROTOCOLS
We explain in this section how authentication and key establish-
ment are achieved in the 5G ecosystem, following as closely as pos-
sible the specification 3GPP TS 33.501 [4], referred from here on as
[TS 33.501]. We simplify terminology to improve readability and
refer the knowledgeable reader to the correspondence table with the
terminology from 3GPP given in Appendix A. We first present the
general architecture and afterwards the authentication protocols.
2.1 Architecture
Three main entities are involved in the cellular network architec-
ture (see Figure 1). First, User Equipment (UE), typically smart-
phones or IoT devices containing a Universal Subscriber Identity
Module (USIM), are carried by subscribers. We shall call a subscriber
the combination of a UE with its USIM. Second, Home Networks
(HNs) contain a database of their subscribers and are responsible
for their authentication. However, subscribers may be in locations
where their corresponding HN has no base station (i.e., antennas
which may connect UEs to the network), for example when roaming.
Therefore, the architecture has a third entity: the Serving Networks
(SNs) to which UEs may attach to. An SN provides services (e.g.,
call or SMS) once both the UE and the SN have mutually authen-
ticated each other (this supports billing) and have established a
secure channel with the help of the subscriber’s HN. The UE and
SN communicate over the air, while the SN and HN communicate
over an authenticated channel (we list security assumptions later
in this section).
As mentioned earlier, each subscriber has a USIM with crypto-
graphic capabilities (e.g., symmetric encryption, MAC). Relevant
