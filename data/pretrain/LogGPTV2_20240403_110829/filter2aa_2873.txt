We've got jobs and stuff. This is not our job. 
Mostly, the lovely people we work for don't 
talk like this. We do sometimes because it's 
the right thing to do. Therefore, what we're 
saying is **all** us and not them. 
If you need to find someone to blame, it's just 
us, except if it's the voices in your own head - 
that's **all** you.
Also, there are no spiders or clowns in the 
presentation, in case you were worried.

American Education Statistics 
85% attain a high school degree
27% attain a post-secondary (2-4 year 
college degree)
Budget of $972 billion (public and private)
Literacy rate is 98% of students > 15 yrs old
Science/Math education rank At THE 
BOTTOM as compared to other developed 
countries
Bureau, U. C. (2009). The 2009 Statistical Abstract. Retrieved from National Data Book
Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), OECD, reading literacy, science 
literacy &
mathematics literacy all rank near the bottom of OECD-countries. 
Women in Computer and 
Information Science
By 2016, U.S. universities will produce only 
53% of the computer science bachelors 
degrees needed to fill the 1.5 million 
computer specialist jobs projected to be 
available.
Down from 37% in 1985, only 18% of 
computer and information science degrees 
were awarded to women in 2008.

Combing the Hackerspace with 
the School
From 8am-5pm, the school 
students use the facility
From 5pm-11pm week days 
and 9am-11pm weekends, 
the space is for hackerspace 
members
Requesting that the 
hackerspace members share 
their projects with the 
students
Establishing a 
mentorship program 
where a students pairs 
with a professional in the
Combing the 
Hackerspace & School
Combining hands-on projects with a traditional 
accredited high school curriculum
For example, the aquarium/biology 
laboratory area will be used for the high 
school laboratory component for the 
courses
Accepting volunteers from the D.C. area to 
teach short courses/lectures/workshops for the 
students
Why Hackerspaces Can Do This 
Better than Traditional Schools
Students learn differently than the 1960s 
educational model upon which current science & 
math curriculums are still based
Students have different learning patterns & 
methods now; educational models have not kept 
pace
In 2004, 3 in 1000 preschoolers were taking 
antidepressant drugs to enhance ability to focus in 
school programs, 
Perhaps changing education to a more dynamic, 
rather than static, model is necessary to attain 
attention of the “now” generation.
