# Presentation: Insecure by Design - DOCSIS and Cable Modem Security

## Introduction
- **Source:** [DOCSIS Insecure by Design - Blake Durandal](http://www.soldierx.com/defcon16speech/docsis_insecure_by_design-blake_durandal.ppt)
- **Humor:** Maybe Ted Stevens has a series of hacked modems and a drop amp at his place. Could this be the reason he thinks that the internet is a series of tubes?

### Background
- **Personal Experience:**
  - Conducted SIPRNET Administration and Red Team Penetration Testing for the USMC.
  - Currently conducting research for SERC (Software Engineering Research Center), an NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research Center.
- **Presentation History:**
  - A shorter version of this presentation was given at the Spring 2008 SERC Showcase.
  - Various individuals, such as Durandal from SOLDIERX, have used the methods in this Defcon presentation to put and keep modems online.

## Overview of the Speech
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Requirements for examples
  - Network overview
  - Anonymous access
  - Cloning a HFC MAC linked to an ISP account
  - How anonymous you really are
  - Firmware overview
  - Hardware and security
  - Specifications, firmware disassembly, current and future security solutions

## Requirements
- **For Examples:**
  - Coaxial connection to the cable company
  - JTAG cable (MIPS EJTAG)
    - USB Cypress or FTDI based JTAG (Fast)
    - Parallel buffered/unbuffered JTAG (Slow)
  - SB5100/5101 cable modem (other modems can be modified)
  - Soldering skills + 10 pin header
  - Applications for flashing the firmware onto a modem
    - Parallel: Schwartze Katze by tcniso.com
    - USB: USB JTAG from usbjtag.com

### Detailed Requirements
- **Cable Connection:**
  - Essential for connecting to the cable network.
- **EJTAG Cable:**
  - Easy to make and available online.
- **USB JTAG:**
  - More difficult to make but significantly faster.

### Additional Requirements
- **Modify the SB5100/5101 or Buy a Premod:**
  - Available from sites like sbhacker.net.
- **Program the SB5100/5101:**
  - Using Schwarze Katze/USB JTAG.

## Modified Firmware
- **Features of Sigma X2/Haxorware:**
  - Enable factory mode
  - Change all associated MAC addresses
  - Change serial number
  - Disable ISP firmware upgrade
  - Disable reboots
  - Force network access (ignore unauthorized messages)
  - Disable & set ISP filters (ports blocked at modem level)
  - Specify config filename and TFTP server IP address
  - Force config file from ISP, local TFTP, or uploaded flash memory
  - Get & set SNMP OID values and Factory mode OID values
  - Broadcom CLI access through serial connection or telnet
  - Full shell access to VxWorks/eCos (Unix-like OS)
  - Upload, flash, and upgrade firmware

## Cable Network Overview
- **Anonymous Internet Access:**
  - Example using Comcast
  - Why Comcast?
    - According to Alex Goldman’s research on isp-planet.com, as of Q4 2007, Comcast is the second most used ISP in the United States and the number one ISP using DOCSIS.
  - Non-provisioned modems will only show a Comcast page asking to sign up for service.
  - You can generally connect inbound to the computer but not outbound.
  - Changing DNS servers allows some outbound connections.
  - Disabling SNMP filters in the console removes port blocking at the modem level.

### Faster Speeds
- **Increasing Speeds:**
  - Force a faster configuration file from the ISP, served locally, or from configs stored in flash memory.
  - Specify a TFTP server; Comcast uses static configurations.
  - Example configuration files:
    - DOCSIS 1.0: d10_m_sb5100_speedtierextreme2_c05.cm = 16/2, d10_m_sb5100_showcase_c01.cm = 55/5, d10_m_na_c05.cm = 0/0 (unrestricted)
    - DOCSIS 1.1: d11_m_sb5100_speedtierextreme2_c05.cm = 16/2, d11_m_sb5100_showcase_c01.cm = 55/5, d11_m_na_c05.cm = 0/0 (unrestricted)

### Changing the Configuration File
- **Navigate to http://192.168.100.1:1337**
  - Specify a file that exists on the ISP server, local server, or upload and serve a file from flash memory.
  - Forcing your own custom config file is generally not possible.

## Techniques for Remaining Anonymous
- **Disable the SNMP daemon after registration:**
  - `cd /non-vol/snmp`
  - `diag_disable_post_reg true`
  - `write`
- **Hide the Modem’s HFC IP Address:**
  - `cd /non-vol/snmp`
  - `hide_ipstack_ifentries true`
  - `write`
- **Hide Reported Software Version:**
  - `cd /snmp`
  - `delete sysDescr`
  - `write`

### Field Results
- **High Success Rates:**
  - Many anonymous cable modem hackers report zero signs of detection.
  - Durandal has a machine on a business configuration seeding torrents for over a year.
  - Individuals often pay for service but splice their line to add additional modems.

## Cloning
- **Basic Cloning:**
  - Specify a provisioned HFC MAC address to get a class of service assigned to the MAC.
  - Use a HFC MAC address from a different CMTS.
  - This method associates your modem with someone else’s account.

### Obtaining Information for Cloning
- **MAC Addresses:**
  - Traded privately on forums and IRC.
  - Sniff DHCP packets to find HFC MAC addresses on your node.
  - Use Wireshark to filter broadcasted packets.
  - SNMP scanning is the preferred method for obtaining HFC MACs for multiple nodes.
  - Exact clones require all identifying information from the modem, including HFC MAC, ETHER MAC, USB MAC, Serial, and BPI+ Certificates.

## How Anonymous Are You?
- **Operations Support System:**
  - Usually unable to pinpoint a modem to an exact location due to the hybrid fiber coax cable network design.
  - Detection typically goes as far as the node where the modem is located.

### Preventing Detection
- **Signal Levels:**
  - ISPs poll for poor signal levels; use an amp if your signal strength is too low.
  - Recommended signal levels: downstream between -15 and +15 dBmV, upstream between -35 to -50.
- **Routine Audits:**
  - ISPs perform audits on lines that should not be connected.
  - Use colored tags to identify the account and service.
- **Regional Operating Centers (ROC):**
  - Independently networked to each CMTS, maintaining a customer MAC database.

### Throwing Up a Red Flag
- **Avoid:**
  - Not using techniques for remaining anonymous.
  - Excessive torrenting.
  - Hosting FTP/Web servers with illegal content.
  - Using cloned MAC addresses without discretion.
  - Splitting the connection too many times, which weakens the signal and may trigger technician visits.

## Precautions
- **Do not transfer personal information over unencrypted connections…EVER!**
