The limit may be reached during normal operation if a PITR discovers a large number of dynamic hosts in the EID-prefix ranges enabled for dynamic learning. If the dynamic local database size limit is reached new hosts will not be discovered. It is worth noting that it is normal for the local database to have a limit for dynamic entries for example to set an upper limit on the amount of memory required. To diagnose this issue it may be helpful to inspect the local database using show ip[v6] lisp [eid-table ] database. The entries can also be cleared with clear lisp[eid-table ] dynamic-eid.

If the cache size limit is reached new entries will replace old/inactive ones as required. If the map-cache limit is set too low actively used EID-to-RLOC mappings may be replaced continously which causes traffic to be dropped while these mappings are re-acquired. As long as only inactive map-cache entries are replaced the impact should not be significant. Furthermore it is worth noting that it is normal for the cache to have a limit for example to set an upper limit on the amount of memory required. To diagnose this issue it may be helpful to inspect the map-cache using show ip[v6] lisp [eid-table ] map-cache. It can also be cleared with clear ip[v6] lisp [eid-table ] map-cache.
