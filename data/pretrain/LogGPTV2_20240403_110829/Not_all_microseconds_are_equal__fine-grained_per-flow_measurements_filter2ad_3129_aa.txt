## Abstract
New applications such as algorithmic trading and high-performance computing require extremely low latency (in microseconds). Network operators today lack sufficient fine-grain measurement tools to detect, localize, and repair performance anomalies and delay spikes that cause application SLA violations. A recently proposed solution called LDA provides a scalable way to obtain latency, but only offers aggregate measurements. However, debugging application-specific problems requires per-flow measurements, as different flows may exhibit significantly different characteristics even when traversing the same link. To enable fine-grained per-flow measurements in routers, we propose a new scalable architecture called Reference Latency Interpolation (RLI) based on our observation that packets closely spaced in time, potentially belonging to different flows, exhibit similar delay properties. In our evaluation using simulations over real traces, RLI achieves a median relative error of 12% and one to two orders of magnitude higher accuracy than previous per-flow measurement solutions with minimal overhead.

## 1. Introduction
Latency is a fundamental property of packet-switched networks, directly impacting critical Internet applications such as multimedia (e.g., voice-over-IP, video conferencing, online games). While these traditional applications often require end-to-end latencies within hundreds of milliseconds, new types of applications, such as high-performance computing, storage (Fiber Channel over Ethernet), and algorithmic trading, demand extremely low end-to-end latencies (in the order of microseconds). For instance, a small increase in end-to-end latency for trading applications can lead to significant financial losses.

To effectively manage low-latency applications, network operators need sophisticated tools to detect, localize, and resolve delay spikes and other performance anomalies. Once localized, they can isolate and reroute offending flows or upgrade bottleneck links. Some switches, like those by Arista and Woven, provide latency guarantees, but fine-grained measurements are still necessary to anticipate and address unforeseen performance issues.

Current router and switch capabilities, such as SNMP counters and NetFlow, are insufficient for fine-grained latency measurements. Active probes and specialized measurement appliances (e.g., Corvil) are costly and not suitable for widespread deployment. Recently, LDA was proposed to measure delays at high fidelity, but it only provides aggregate measurements. Differentiated delay measurements are crucial because concurrent flows can experience significantly different latencies, even over short periods.

We illustrate this with two examples: 
1. A data center hosting multiple applications where one application suffers due to periodic bursts from another.
2. Trading networks where service providers must ensure specific SLAs, requiring flow-level measurements to diagnose customer-specific issues.

Our study reveals significant performance diversity among concurrent flows and temporal similarity in short bursts. We propose RLI, a new architecture for scalable per-flow latency measurements, achieving a median relative error of 10-12% and up to one to two orders of magnitude lower relative error than existing schemes.

## 2. Delay Diversity and Locality
Before designing a scalable architecture for fine-grained flow-level latencies, it is essential to confirm that aggregate latency measures (like LDA) are insufficient. We show significant diversity in performance experienced by concurrent flows through both qualitative reasoning and experimental studies. Bursty packet arrivals and heavy-tailed flow durations contribute to this diversity, making single delay statistics inadequate.

### 2.1 Flow-Level Performance Diversity
Under bursty conditions, the performance of a flow depends on whether it encounters congestion. Common delay statistics (mean, quantiles) can vary significantly between probe streams and actual flows. Our analysis of four datasets (SANJ, CHIC, WEB468, WEB700) confirms this diversity, with range factors (R) indicating large variations in mean delays.

### 2.2 Temporal Localization of Queueing Delays
While delay statistics of concurrent flows over a 5-minute period can vary, burstiness also leads to similar queueing delays within short time windows. We demonstrate this by localizing time and approximating the mean queueing delay experienced by packets of a given flow over small time windows using the mean delay of all other flows. This insight is crucial for designing scalable performance measurements.
