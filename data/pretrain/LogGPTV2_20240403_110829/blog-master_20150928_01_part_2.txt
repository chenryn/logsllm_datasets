还有中期TODO，不支持分布式JOIN，不支持分布式事务，不支持非分布列的唯一约束，FK约束。  
短期TODO，不支持表结构修改，不支持删除表。  
另一个问题是，pg_shard需要一个master数据库，而且master没有办法做对等设备。所以master容易成为瓶颈，特别是网络瓶颈和CPU瓶颈。因此要突破这几个瓶颈和问题的话，在OLTP中使用就更加靠谱了。  
鉴于以上这些限制，你要考虑清楚pg_shard是否能满足你的需求。  
个人认为最靠谱的还是连接池代理，轻量，而且容易做对等设备，可以很好的解决性能和效率的问题。  
（但是同样很难实现分布式事务和分布式JOIN，以及分布式唯一和FK约束，但是你得考虑清楚，你是否真的需要这些？）  
另外，你可以使用9.4版本的jdbc，已经支持负载均衡和failover了。  
http://blog.163.com/digoal@126/blog/static/16387704020158241250463/  
如果你没有跨库事务和分布式JOIN，以及分布式唯一和FK约束的需求。目前jdbc 9.4 + plproxy可以完美的实现真正性能线性增长的数据库分片。
