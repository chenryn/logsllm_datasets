## Abstract
The Tor anonymity network is often subjected to discrimination by online service providers due to abusive traffic. This study characterizes both the extent of such discrimination and the nature of the unwanted traffic originating from the Tor network, a task complicated by the need to maintain user anonymity. We leverage multiple independent data sources, including email complaints, commercial IP blacklists, webpage crawls via Tor, and privacy-sensitive measurements from our own Tor exit nodes. Our methods include classifying email complaints, developing an interactive crawler to detect subtle forms of discrimination, and deploying Tor exits in various configurations to understand which are more prone to discrimination. We find that conservative exit policies are ineffective in preventing blacklisting, but high-traffic volume attacks suggest the possibility of detection and prevention without compromising user privacy.

## 1. Introduction
Anonymity systems like Tor provide a valuable service for users who wish to access the internet without revealing their identity or destination. However, as Tor's usage has grown, tensions have emerged between Tor users and online service providers. Service providers claim that the anonymity provided by Tor is frequently exploited for malicious activities such as spamming, vulnerability scanning, and scraping. As a result, Tor users face differential treatment, including CAPTCHAs and outright blocking.

The core issue is that each Tor user shares their reputation with other users, leading to IP addresses used by Tor exit relays being included in abuse blacklists. Consequently, even benign Tor users are treated as potentially malicious. In this paper, we characterize the conflict between users desiring anonymity and websites aiming to protect themselves against malicious Tor traffic. We investigate the nature of the traffic exiting the Tor network and the forms of discrimination faced by Tor users.

### Challenges
We address two key challenges: measuring Tor traffic while respecting user privacy and defining and identifying abusive traffic. We focus on the receivers' reactions to Tor traffic rather than the traffic itself, using email complaints, blacklisting, and server responses. This approach allows us to observe the effects of undesired traffic without directly measuring it and provides an operational definition of undesired traffic.

Additionally, we faced technical challenges in collecting and analyzing the datasets. We developed automated methods to process 3 million email complaints, distinguished reactive from proactive blacklisting, and created a crawler capable of exercising website features to detect subtle forms of discrimination. We also deployed our own Tor exit relays with a privacy-sensitive logging approach to measure real Tor traffic and understand the characteristics that make exits more susceptible to complaints and blacklisting.

### Key Findings
Our analysis reveals that many attacks originating from Tor generate high traffic volumes, suggesting the potential for detection and prevention using privacy-sensitive techniques. Historically, copyright enforcement firms were the most vocal complainants, but this has changed, possibly due to Tor blocking BitTorrent's standard ports. The most common non-copyright complaints were about network abuse and unauthorized access attempts.

From our analysis of commercial IP blacklists, we find that 7% engage in proactive blocking of Tor users, indicating a policy-based approach rather than a response to specific abuse. Currently, 88% of Tor relays are blacklisted on one or more blacklists, compared to 9% and 69% for VPNGate and HMA VPN services, respectively. Conservative exit policies do not reduce the likelihood of blacklisting, likely because they still allow web access, the primary channel for abuse.

Finally, we find that discrimination is a significant concern. Our synthetic experiments show that 20% of Alexa Top 500 websites discriminate against Tor users, with higher rates for search and login functionalities. Real Tor users experience high fractions of failed HTTP and HTTPS requests while browsing the Alexa Top 1M websites.

## 2. Background and Related Work
### Tensions between Tor and Online Services
Tor is a low-latency onion routing network with over 2 million daily users and 7,000 supporting servers. While it provides valuable anonymity, it can also be used for malicious activities. Reports from CloudFlare, Distill Networks, Sqreen, Akamai, and Imperva-Incapsula highlight the prevalence of malicious traffic from Tor. However, some studies suggest that the methods used to infer malicious traffic may be flawed, and there is evidence that Tor users are just as likely to make purchases as non-Tor users.

### Blocking and Filtering of Tor
Many governments block access to Tor, but this is different from server-side blocking, which targets Tor exit nodes. Khattak et al. found that at least 1.3 million IP addresses blocked Tor at the TCP/IP layer in 2015, and 3.6% of Alexa Top 1,000 websites blocked Tor at the HTTP layer. Our work extends this by measuring the blocking of login and search functionality, finding a higher rate of blocking (20.03%).

## 3. Our Deployed Exits
To aid our studies, we deployed ten of our own Tor exits with varying bandwidth and exit policies. We used 2 MBps (small exits), 10 MBps (medium exits), and unlimited (large exits) bandwidth allocations. The exit policies were either the default policy or the Reduced-Reduced (RR) policy, designed to avoid blacklisting. We summarize our relay configurations in Table 1.

| Configuration | Max. BW | Exit Policy | Num. |
|---------------|----------|-------------|------|
| Large-Default | 61 MBps | Default     | 2    |
| Medium-Default| 10 MBps | Default     | 2    |
| Medium-RR     | 10 MBps | RR          | 2    |
| Small-Default | 2 MBps  | Default     | 2    |
| Small-RR      | 2 MBps  | RR          | 2    |

Analyzing the port usage statistics, we found that web traffic accounts for 98.88% of all connections through RR policy exits, while default policy exits have higher application/port diversity, with only 31.36% being HTTP(S).

## 4. Email Complaints about Abuse
In this section, we analyze abuse complaints received by exit operators. We use these complaints to understand the type and frequency of undesired incidents through Tor exit relays.

### 4.1 The Email Corpus
We obtained access to abuse complaints emailed to four exit relay operators, including a large corpus of ≈3 million emails from Torservers.net. We estimate that Torservers runs 10 to 20 exits, making them one of the largest exit operators. Our dataset includes complaints from apx1, apx2, apx3, TorLand1, and jahjah. The dataset lacks complaints sent by fax or mail, and some email complaints may have been lost or deleted.
