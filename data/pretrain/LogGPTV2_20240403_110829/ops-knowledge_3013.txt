User: How to install and configure Nginx in Linux system, and make basic performance optimization?
Assistant: Install and configure Nginx: 1. Install Nginx on a Linux system: You can use package management tools such as apt-get or yum to install, or compile it from source code. For example, to install Nginx via apt-get: sudo apt-get install nginx. 2. Configure Nginx: Nginx configuration files are generally in the /etc/nginx/ directory, mainly including nginx.conf and sites-available/default files. You can modify the configuration of Nginx as needed, for example, modify the listening port, domain name, SSL, etc. 3. Start Nginx: Use the systemctl or service command to start the Nginx service, for example, sudo systemctl start nginx or sudo service nginx start. Performance optimization: 1. Enable gzip compression: Enable gzip compression in the Nginx.conf file to reduce page loading time. 2. Cache static resources: Use Nginx's proxy_cache or fastcgi_cache module to speed up page loading. 3. Enable keepalive: Using keepalive can reduce the establishment and teardown of TCP connections and improve the response speed of the server. 4. Configure cache: Use the proxy_cache_path module of Nginx to set the cache path and cache time. 5. Adjust the value of worker_processes: According to the hardware configuration and performance requirements of the server, appropriately increase or decrease the value of worker_processes to improve the concurrent processing capability of Nginx. 6. Use the mapping table: URLs are pre-routed to the mapping table in memory, which can reduce matching time and improve performance. 7. Limit access frequency: Use the limit_req module of Nginx to control the frequency of user requests and prevent DDoS attacks.
