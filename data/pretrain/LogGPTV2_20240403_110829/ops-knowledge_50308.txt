User: While learning debugging,I somehow went into installing gdb and then gdb-peda.But now, I would like to uninstall gdb-peda.Can anyone pls guide me ?
Assistant: Actually peda-gdb doesn't really install any executable in your computer.
All the peda-gdb does is to modify the config file of gdb.
This file is by default located at ~/.gdbinit. 

use cat ~/.gdbinit can you peek how does peda do
Therefore, to go back to vanilla gdb, there are 2 solutions

gdb --nx

This is a better way, since you may need peda someday 

rm -rf ~/.gdbinit

This will remove the config file of gdb, so what peda did will have no effect on your gdb now.
