### Relay-Forward
**Description:**
- Sent by a relay agent to forward a message to a server.
- The Relay-Forward message contains a client message encapsulated as the DHCPv6 Relay-Message option.

**Usage:**
- N/A

### Relay-Reply
**Description:**
- Sent by a server to send a message to a client through a relay agent.
- The Relay-Reply message contains a server message encapsulated as the DHCPv6 Relay-Message option.

**Usage:**
- N/A

### Table 6-2: DHCPv6 Messages
A typical DHCPv6 stateful message exchange for obtaining IPv6 addresses and configuration settings involves the following messages:

1. **Solicit**: Sent by the client to locate available servers.
2. **Advertise**: Sent by a server to indicate that it can provide addresses and configuration settings.
3. **Request**: Sent by the client to request addresses and configuration settings from a specific server.
4. **Reply**: Sent by the requested server, containing the assigned addresses and configuration settings.

**Relay Agent Involvement:**
- If a relay agent is present between the client and the server, it sends the server Relay-Forward messages containing the encapsulated Solicit and Request messages from the client.
- The server then sends the relay agent Relay-Reply messages containing the encapsulated Advertise and Reply messages for the client.

For a DHCPv6 stateless message exchange to obtain only configuration settings, the following messages are typically used:

1. **Information-Request**: Sent by the DHCPv6 client to request configuration settings from a server.
2. **Reply**: Sent by the server, containing the requested configuration settings.

**Stateless Address Prefix Assignment:**
- For an IPv6 network where routers are configured to assign stateless address prefixes to hosts, a two-message DHCPv6 exchange can be used to assign DNS servers, DNS domain names, and other configuration settings not included in router advertisement messages.

### DHCPv6 Support in Windows
- **Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008** include a DHCPv6 client.
- The DHCPv6 client's behavior depends on the values of the M (Managed) and O (Other) flags in received router advertisement messages.
- To use DHCPv6, you must configure DHCPv6 servers and relay agents to service each IPv6 subnet and configure your IPv6 routers to set these flags appropriately.
- Multiple advertising routers for a given subnet should be configured to advertise the same stateless address prefixes and flag values.
- **Windows XP and Windows Server 2003** do not include a DHCPv6 client and ignore the M and O flags in received router advertisements.

**Configuring Flags:**
- Use the `netsh interface ipv6 set interface InterfaceNameOrIndex managedaddress=enabled` command to set the M flag to 1.
- Use the `netsh interface ipv6 set interface InterfaceNameOrIndex otherstateful=enabled` command to set the O flag to 1.

**Windows Server 2008** supports both stateful and stateless DHCPv6 configurations with the DHCP Server service and a DHCPv6 relay agent via the Routing and Remote Access service.

### Configuring DHCPv6 Scopes and Options
**Creating a DHCPv6 Scope:**
1. In the DHCP snap-in console tree, right-click the IPv6 node and select "New scope."
2. Follow the instructions in the New Scope Wizard.

**Configuring a DHCPv6 Scope Option:**
1. In the DHCP snap-in console tree, open the IPv6 node and the applicable scope.
2. Right-click "Scope Options" and select "Configure Options."
3. In the "Available Options" list, select the checkbox for the first option you want to configure.
4. Under "Data entry," enter the required information and click "OK."
5. Repeat steps 3-4 for any additional options.

**Example:**
- Figure 6-18 shows an example of configuring the DNS Recursive Name Server IPv6 Address List scope option.

### Installing and Configuring the DHCPv6 Relay Agent
**Installation and Configuration:**
1. In the Routing and Remote Access snap-in console tree, double-click the server name and select "IPv6."
2. Click "IPv6 Routing," right-click "General," and select "New Routing Protocol."
3. In the "Select Routing Protocol" dialog box, choose "DHCPv6 Relay Agent" and click "OK."
4. In the console tree, right-click "DHCPv6 Relay Agent" and select "Properties."
5. In the "DHCPv6 Relay Agent Properties" dialog box, add the list of IPv6 addresses corresponding to the DHCPv6 servers on your network.

**Example:**
- Figure 6-19 shows an example of the DHCPv6 Relay Agent Properties dialog box.

**Enabling the DHCPv6 Relay Agent on Additional Interfaces:**
1. In the Routing and Remote Access snap-in console tree, double-click the server name and select "IPv6."
2. Double-click "IPv6 Routing," right-click "DHCPv6 Relay Agent," and select "New Interface."
3. Select the interface you want to add and click "OK."
4. In the "DHCPv6 Relay Properties" dialog box, verify that the "Relay DHCPv6 packets" checkbox is selected.
5. Modify the "Hop-count threshold" and "Boot threshold (seconds)" as needed.
6. Click "OK."

**Example:**
- Figure 6-20 shows an example of the DHCPv6 Relay Properties dialog box for an interface.

### Using the Ipconfig Tool
The `ipconfig` tool is used to display a computer’s TCP/IP configuration and manage an IPv4 address configuration allocated using DHCP.

**Displaying IP Configuration:**
- **Basic Information:**
  - Type `ipconfig` at the command prompt.
  - Displays connection-specific DNS suffix, IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6), subnet mask (for IPv4 addresses), and default gateway.
- **Detailed Information:**
  - Type `ipconfig /all` at the command prompt.
  - Includes additional items such as host name, primary DNS suffix, NetBIOS node type, IP routing status, WINS proxy status, DNS suffix search list, network adapter description, MAC address, DHCP and autoconfiguration (APIPA) status, DHCP server address, WINS server addresses, lease information, and more.

**Renewing a Lease:**
- Type `ipconfig /renew` at the command prompt to renew a lease on an IPv4 address allocated using DHCP.

**Releasing a Lease:**
- Type `ipconfig /release` at the command prompt to release the current IPv4 address configuration.

**Setting and Displaying the Class ID:**
- Set the user class ID: `ipconfig /setclassid Adapter ClassID`
- Display the user class ID: `ipconfig /showclassid Adapter`
