User: Is is possible to detect if a Python script was started from the command prompt or by a user "double clicking" a .py file in the file explorer on Windows?
Assistant: Good question. One thing you could do is create a shortcut to the script in Windows, and pass arguments (using the shortcut's Target property) that would denote the script was launched by double-clicking (in this case, a shortcut).
