If possible clear the VINES routing table. This will result in a temporary loss of connectivity until all routes are relearned.\" In the VINES routing table an inconsistency that should never happen was detected in paths to its neighbor. The side effects of this inconsistency are unknown. This inconsistency is most likely due to mishandling of internal pointers by VINES but it is also quite possible that other components in the system may have been indirectly affected with corrupting pointers. Debugging should focus on trying to catch strange events that happen with the VINES route table. The show vines route command and the debug vines routing state table and reinit commands are the primary commands to use in attempting to determine the cause of the inconsistency.
