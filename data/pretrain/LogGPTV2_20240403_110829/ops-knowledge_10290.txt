User: Familiar with the network configuration and management under the Linux system, how to check the device IP address, port status, routing table and other information, and perform network debugging and troubleshooting?
Assistant: 1. View the IP address of the device: You can use the ifconfig command or the ip addr command to view the IP address of the device. 2. View the port status: You can use the netstat command or the lsof command to view the occupied ports and corresponding applications. 3. View the routing table: You can use the route command to view the routing table information of the current device. 4. Network debugging and troubleshooting: You can use the ping command, traceroute command, tcpdump command, etc. for network debugging and troubleshooting. At the same time, you can view system log files and other network tools for diagnosis. For specific operations, please refer to the following command examples: 1. ifconfig command: You can view information such as the IP address, subnet mask, and MAC address of the device. ``` ifconfig ``` 2. Netstat command: You can view the ports and corresponding applications that have been opened by the current device. ``` netstat -anp ``` 3. lsof command: You can view the file and port information of the current device that has been opened. ``` lsof -i ``` 4. route command: You can view the routing table information of the current device. ``` route -n ``` 5. ping command: It can test the network connectivity between devices. ```ping IP address``` 6. traceroute command: You can view the network path information that the data packet passes through. ``` traceroute IP address``` 7. tcpdump command: It can capture network data packets for network traffic analysis. ``` tcpdump -i eth0 -n ``` It should be noted that these commands need to have administrator privileges to execute. When performing network debugging and troubleshooting, it is necessary to combine system log files, other network tools, and related actual operating environments for diagnosis.
