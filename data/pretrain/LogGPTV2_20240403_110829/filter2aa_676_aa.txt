SUMMARY 
Dell, Google, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Microsoft, and Philips (collectively the 
“Coalition”) applaud the Commission’s decision to make available portions of unused 
spectrum in the television (“TV”) broadcast bands.  This decision was a crucial first step 
towards providing broadband access to millions of Americans and enabling a wide range 
of innovative wireless devices and services which are not practical at higher frequencies.  
However, if the Commission adopts overly restrictive technical and operational rules, this 
first step could also be the last, depriving the public of tremendous benefits that could be 
realized by putting the valuable—but fallow—TV white spaces to use.  To ensure that the 
white spaces are used to serve the public, the Coalition herein proposes an approach that 
will protect incumbent licensees from harmful interference while at the same time 
maximizing use of the white spaces by innovative unlicensed devices.  Specifically, the 
Coalition urges the Commission to implement the following recommendations: 
First, with respect to personal/portable unlicensed devices, the Commission 
should authorize the use of spectrum sensing technology rather than mandating the geo-
location/database and control signal approaches discussed in the initial Notice of 
Proposed Rulemaking.  The rigorous testing that the Commission intends to undertake 
will confirm that spectrum sensing, when implemented with the correct technical 
parameters as proposed herein, is the most reliable and efficient means of avoiding 
harmful interference to incumbent licensees.  To this end, the Coalition will provide the 
Commission with a prototype device for testing purposes so that the Commission can 
confirm that the proposed unlicensed devices which the Coalition plans to market will not 
cause harmful interference.  
iii
Second, the Commission should authorize the use of personal/portable unlicensed 
devices contemporaneous with the authorization of fixed devices, and facilitate the use of 
personal/portable unlicensed devices by imposing the minimum regulation necessary to 
protect incumbent licensees.  Technology has advanced sufficiently such that the high 
tech industry can manufacture mass market, low power devices for a wide range of 
innovative services that will protect licensees from harmful interference.  These devices, 
however, cannot and should not operate pursuant to the restrictions applicable to fixed 
devices; personal/portable devices use lower power than fixed devices, and should be 
regulated accordingly.  Moreover, a market comprised only of fixed devices would be 
much smaller, thereby limiting economies of scale and scope and potentially causing 
significant manufacturers to forego market entry—depriving many Americans of 
innovative wireless services and technologies.   
Third, the Commission should ensure that the TV white spaces are used for 
unlicensed operation; spectrum should not be allocated on a licensed basis.  The 
Commission has concluded correctly that unlicensed operations may be better suited to 
adapt to the “shifting spectrum environment” characterized by low power operations in 
the TV bands.  Indeed, the phenomenal success of the Wi-Fi industry is merely a prelude 
to the benefits the country can expect from making unused television spectrum available 
on an unlicensed basis.  With so much licensed spectrum already available below 1 GHz 
(including an additional 60 MHz to be freed up for nationwide licensed use by the DTV 
transition in the near future), it simply makes no sense to license the TV white spaces as 
well—particularly since licensing of this “Swiss cheese”, power-restricted spectrum will 
likely result in substantial underutilization.  Moreover, licensing simply is not necessary 
iv
to protect incumbent licensees as some would contend; unlicensed manufacturers are 
strongly motivated to protect licensed users from harmful interference, and are fully 
capable of doing so.    
In short, the Coalition strongly urges the Commission to adopt minimal technical 
and operational rules that maximize the potential innovative uses of the TV white spaces 
while protecting the legitimate rights of licensed users.  By doing so, the Commission 
will help ensure that all Americans derive the highest benefit from this valuable, yet 
presently underused, public resource.

Dell, Google, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Microsoft, and Philips (collectively the 
“Coalition”) applaud the Commission’s decision in the First Report and Order to grant 
certain devices access to substantial portions of unused spectrum in the television (“TV”) 
broadcast bands.1  This decision represents a crucial first step towards providing 
broadband access to millions of Americans and enabling a wide range of innovative 
wireless services and technologies, such as self-organizing mesh networks and 
distribution of high-definition multimedia content throughout the household.  As the 
world’s largest producers of consumer electronics, software, semiconductors, personal 
computers, and peripheral devices, the Coalition’s members stand ready to commit 
substantial resources to bring these advancements to consumers.   
The Coalition’s members believe that the phenomenal success of the billion dollar 
Wi-Fi industry—which has utilized what was once called “junk” spectrum to lower

infrastructure costs and enable widespread, flexible broadband access—is merely a 
prelude to the benefits that can be achieved from opening up unused TV broadcast 
spectrum.  For the first time, the public will have access to broadband-capable unlicensed 
spectrum below 900 MHz, and industry will be able to offer consumers a range of new 
products and services that take advantage of the superior propagation characteristics of 
this spectrum.  In order to realize this vision, the Commission must strike the appropriate 
balance between the interests of incumbent license holders and the public’s right to use 
the airwaves in innovative ways.  The existing users of the TV bands should be afforded 
the interference protection accorded to them by their licenses, but the overreaching 
measures proposed by some incumbents extend far beyond the rights their licenses 
provide, and are not necessary to protect licensees. 2  In fact, such measures will serve 
only to foreclose the benefits that full utilization of these bands can offer to millions of 
Americans.    
Innovative use of the 2.4 GHz band—which currently accommodates over one 
billion devices—has been driven by the substantial flexibility and unlicensed access 
afforded to users of that band.  Successful utilization of the TV white spaces will require 
a similar approach.  The Coalition therefore is encouraged by the Commission’s 
recognition in the Further Notice that overly restrictive technical rules will render use of 
the TV white spaces infeasible, and endorses the Commission’s decision to conduct 
independent testing to determine the actual level of interference protection necessary for 
incumbents.  In short, the Commission should adopt regulations that ensure the maximum

opposed allocating spectrum in these bands for unlicensed devices.  See generally Joint Comments of

flexibility for innovation in the white spaces, while still protecting incumbent licensees 
from harmful interference.   
I. 
THE COMMISSION SHOULD AUTHORIZE SPECTRUM SENSING TECHNOLOGY TO 
ENABLE USE OF LOW POWER UNLICENSED DEVICES IN THE TV WHITE SPACES.   
A. 
Spectrum Sensing Offers the Best Solution for Identifying and 
Utilizing Available White Spaces.  
The Coalition enthusiastically endorses the Commission’s initial determination 
that devices operating in the TV white spaces could employ spectrum sensing to 
determine that a particular channel is available for use,3 and encourages the Commission 
to authorize spectrum sensing for low power personal/portable devices.  Spectrum 
sensing will protect incumbent licensees and facilitate spectrum sharing with other low 
power devices in the white spaces, while avoiding the operational difficulties and 
economic burdens associated with the other interference avoidance mechanisms 
identified in this proceeding.  In addition, since spectrum sensing does not depend on 
third party “assisting” technologies (such as databases of available channels and/or 
broadcast beacons) to implement, a spectrum sensing approach will better facilitate the 
creation of a mass market for devices – resulting in more affordable consumer products 
and more attractive prospects for wireless broadband, including in rural areas.  In fact, it 
may be the single most significant action taken by the Commission to bring broadband 
access to rural America.

 See FNPRM ¶ 3 (“We propose to require that TV band devices employ spectrum sensing to determine 
when TV channels are unused and to incorporate a dynamic frequency selection (DFS) mechanism to 
ensure that TV band devices operate only on vacant TV channels.”).

1. 
Spectrum sensing is a proven, well understood technique.  
The primary concern raised to date by incumbent licensees with respect to 
spectrum sensing is that this approach is unproven.4  However, this is simply not the case.  
Wi-Fi devices operating in the unlicensed bands have been employing spectrum sensing 
technology for over 10 years.  Moreover, as the Commission has recognized, the 
authorization of U-NII devices employing dynamic frequency selection (“DFS”) in the 5 
GHz band provides a valuable precedent for the Commission to consider when 
determining the appropriate approach for interference avoidance in this proceeding.5  As 
discussed below, the Coalition advocates an even more conservative means of detecting 
protected signals than that used by U-NII devices.  In order to protect incumbent 
licensees, the Coalition recommends -114 dBm as the threshold for establishing channel 
vacancy, 50 dB more than the Commission requires for U-NII devices.  
Although the Commission correctly notes that differences between incumbent 
military radar in the 5 GHz band and TV broadcast signals will require modifications to 
the U-NII DFS approach, most of these differences make the case for spectrum sensing in 
the TV bands even more compelling.  Unlike military radar, TV signals are designed to 
be detected.  While differences between the bands will require different technical 
standards, the Coalition is confident that the Commission’s prototype device testing will 
confirm that the Coalition’s proposed operating parameters will protect licensees from 
harmful interference.  Spectrum sensing obviates the need for base stations, geo-location

See, e.g., MSTV and NAB Comments at 15 (“While [spectrum sensing] technology may hold promise, 
the Commission cannot risk the health of the public’s broadcast television service today on the basis of 
technology that may or may not be developed tomorrow.”).

or control signals, and the Commission should authorize its use for unlicensed 
personal/portable devices.     
2. 
Proposed operating parameters for spectrum sensing. 
In its initial NPRM, the Commission proposed to limit the maximum power 
output of unlicensed personal/portable devices to 100 mW, with a maximum transmit and 
receive antenna gain of 6 dBi.6  In order to further reduce the likelihood of harmful 
interference, the Coalition recommends a maximum of 0 dBi for receive and transmit 
antennas rather than the 6 dBi gain proposed by the Commission.  This restriction will 
result in an EIRP which is 6 dB less than was suggested by the Commission.  The 
Coalition further notes that the operating parameters it suggests below will cause the 
unlicensed device to frequently transmit at powers less than its proposed maximum EIRP 
of 20 dBm.7
