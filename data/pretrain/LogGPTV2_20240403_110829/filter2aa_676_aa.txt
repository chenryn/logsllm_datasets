**Summary**

Dell, Google, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Microsoft, and Philips (collectively, the "Coalition") commend the Commission's decision to make available portions of unused spectrum in the television ("TV") broadcast bands. This decision marks a critical first step toward providing broadband access to millions of Americans and enabling a wide range of innovative wireless devices and services that are not feasible at higher frequencies. However, if the Commission adopts overly restrictive technical and operational rules, this initial progress could be halted, depriving the public of significant benefits from utilizing the valuable but underused TV white spaces.

To ensure that the white spaces are used to serve the public, the Coalition proposes an approach that will protect incumbent licensees from harmful interference while maximizing the use of the white spaces by innovative unlicensed devices. Specifically, the Coalition urges the Commission to implement the following recommendations:

1. **Spectrum Sensing Technology**: For personal/portable unlicensed devices, the Commission should authorize the use of spectrum sensing technology rather than mandating geolocation/database and control signal approaches. Rigorous testing will confirm that spectrum sensing, with the correct technical parameters, is the most reliable and efficient means of avoiding harmful interference. The Coalition will provide the Commission with a prototype device for testing to confirm that the proposed unlicensed devices will not cause harmful interference.

2. **Authorization of Personal/Portable Devices**: The Commission should authorize the use of personal/portable unlicensed devices simultaneously with the authorization of fixed devices, imposing only the minimum regulation necessary to protect incumbent licensees. Technological advancements now allow the high-tech industry to manufacture mass-market, low-power devices for a wide range of innovative services that will protect licensees from harmful interference. These devices should not be subject to the same restrictions as fixed devices, as they operate at lower power levels and should be regulated accordingly. A market comprised solely of fixed devices would be smaller, limiting economies of scale and potentially deterring significant manufacturers from entering the market, thus depriving many Americans of innovative wireless services and technologies.

3. **Unlicensed Operation of TV White Spaces**: The Commission should ensure that the TV white spaces are allocated for unlicensed operation, not licensed use. The Commission has correctly concluded that unlicensed operations may be better suited to adapt to the "shifting spectrum environment" characterized by low-power operations in the TV bands. The success of the Wi-Fi industry, which has utilized previously underutilized spectrum, is a testament to the potential benefits of making unused television spectrum available on an unlicensed basis. With substantial licensed spectrum already available below 1 GHz, including an additional 60 MHz to be freed up for nationwide licensed use by the DTV transition, it is unnecessary to license the TV white spaces. Licensing such "Swiss cheese," power-restricted spectrum would likely result in significant underutilization. Moreover, licensing is not necessary to protect incumbent licensees, as unlicensed manufacturers are strongly motivated and capable of protecting licensed users from harmful interference.

In summary, the Coalition strongly urges the Commission to adopt minimal technical and operational rules that maximize the potential innovative uses of the TV white spaces while protecting the legitimate rights of licensed users. By doing so, the Commission will help ensure that all Americans derive the highest benefit from this valuable, yet currently underused, public resource.

**I. The Commission Should Authorize Spectrum Sensing Technology to Enable Use of Low Power Unlicensed Devices in the TV White Spaces**

**A. Spectrum Sensing Offers the Best Solution for Identifying and Utilizing Available White Spaces**

The Coalition enthusiastically endorses the Commission's initial determination that devices operating in the TV white spaces could employ spectrum sensing to determine channel availability. Spectrum sensing will protect incumbent licensees and facilitate spectrum sharing with other low-power devices, avoiding the operational difficulties and economic burdens associated with other interference avoidance mechanisms. Since spectrum sensing does not depend on third-party "assisting" technologies (such as databases or broadcast beacons), it will better facilitate the creation of a mass market for devices, resulting in more affordable consumer products and more attractive prospects for wireless broadband, especially in rural areas.

**1. Spectrum Sensing is a Proven, Well-Understood Technique**

Incumbent licensees have raised concerns about the unproven nature of spectrum sensing. However, this concern is unfounded. Wi-Fi devices have been using spectrum sensing technology for over a decade. Additionally, the Commission's authorization of U-NII devices employing dynamic frequency selection (DFS) in the 5 GHz band provides a valuable precedent. The Coalition advocates a more conservative approach, recommending a -114 dBm threshold for establishing channel vacancy, 50 dB more stringent than the Commission's requirement for U-NII devices.

Although differences between military radar in the 5 GHz band and TV broadcast signals will require modifications to the U-NII DFS approach, these differences make the case for spectrum sensing in the TV bands even more compelling. Unlike military radar, TV signals are designed to be detected. The Coalition is confident that the Commission's prototype device testing will confirm that the proposed operating parameters will protect licensees from harmful interference. Spectrum sensing eliminates the need for base stations, geolocation, or control signals, and the Commission should authorize its use for unlicensed personal/portable devices.

**2. Proposed Operating Parameters for Spectrum Sensing**

In its initial NPRM, the Commission proposed to limit the maximum power output of unlicensed personal/portable devices to 100 mW, with a maximum transmit and receive antenna gain of 6 dBi. To further reduce the likelihood of harmful interference, the Coalition recommends a maximum of 0 dBi for both receive and transmit antennas, resulting in an EIRP 6 dB less than the Commission's suggestion. The Coalition also notes that the proposed operating parameters will often result in transmission powers lower than the proposed maximum EIRP of 20 dBm.
