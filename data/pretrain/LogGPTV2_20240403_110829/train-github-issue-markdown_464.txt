**Issue Description**

I have thoroughly searched the issues in this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.

## Expected Behavior
I would like to have an `Avatar` component that displays the image of the currently logged-in user.

## Current Behavior
The `Avatar` component does not work as expected. It only works if I import the image at the top of the file and use a static string for the `src` attribute.

## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
Here is the relevant code snippet. I am retrieving the user's image URL from `this.state.user.img`, and I have verified that it contains the correct value.

```jsx
// Your code here
```

## Environment
- Project created using `create-react-app`
- **Material-UI**: v0.19.2
- **React**: v15.6.1
- **Browser**: Chrome 62
