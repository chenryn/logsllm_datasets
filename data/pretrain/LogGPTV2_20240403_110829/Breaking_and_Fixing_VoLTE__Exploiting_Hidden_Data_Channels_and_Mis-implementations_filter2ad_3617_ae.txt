respond to UEs with an error message.
Further, to protect against SIP tunneling and denial of service
attacks, operators should limit the number of SIP messages from a
UE within a certain period. If an adversary exceeds a certain thresh-
old, operators should block the adversary and inspect her activities.
Furthermore, the SIP server should check if a UE is already calling
another UE. If so, it should block other call originating messages
(i.e. INVITE messages). This policy can detect and prevent other
attacks such as cellular p2p deﬁnitely, and intuitively because a
prerequisite of these attacks is that an adversary should be able to
send multiple INVITE messages.
UE Veriﬁcation. To prevent call spooﬁng, SIP servers should verify
the source of SIP messages. One possible way to facilitate this is
to add a UE’s unique identity such as IMEI to SIP messages. SIP
servers would then be able to cross-check the unique identity with
the phone number. Unless a unique identity is stored securely in the
mobile device, an adversary can easily intercept this information by
remotely installing a malicious application.
Another solution is to bind the phone number with the IP address
of a UE. The operators can validate the user-initiated SIP messages
by checking UE’s IP header with the parameters (such as IP ad-
336dress, phone number, and device unique identity) in SIP messages
because this information is already stored in the operators’ server.
IP spooﬁng is also possible, but we found that all the operators we
experimented with have an IP spooﬁng prevention mechanism for
the data interface. Even though we have not tested IP spooﬁng for
the VoLTE interface, the operators might have already installed a
similar mechanism in VoLTE. Therefore, cross-checking is a strong
yet easy to implement solution.
However, it cannot prevent caller spooﬁng in cases where an
adversary spoofs the victim’s IMS registration procedure, such that
the SIP server stores spoofed parameters. A UE registers itself to
a SIP server by exchanging REGISTER messages, and the SIP
server stores several parameters that can identify the UE. Thus,
if an adversary can spoof the registration, she can obtain the full
permission of the victim’s phone address.
Deep Packet Inspection (DPI). Since the RTP tunneling exploits
the media dedicated bearer during a VoLTE call, operators can
recognize if a user is utilizing the media channel through trafﬁc
monitoring. This monitoring job can be done by applying a deep
packet inspection (DPI) solution in P-GWs or media proxies. How-
ever, if an adversary disguises the data into voice-like trafﬁc, then
the DPI solution will not be sufﬁcient to prevent it.
Accounting Policy. All the free channels we exploited in this paper
resulted from time-based accounting. This problem can be resolved
by changing the accounting policy of VoLTE service to a byte usage-
based scheme. Of course, even in this case, an adversary can still
exploit a voice channel. However, she cannot bypass the accounting.
This seems quite natural, but it would be difﬁcult for the operators
to change the current time-based policy since it is deeply related to
the revenue. 70% of total revenue in the operators is still from voice
and SMS [12].
6.2 A Long-term and Comprehensive Solution
Permission model mismatch is a severe problem that is prevalent in
current VoLTE-compatible mobile devices. Unlike the previous call
mechanism, as VoLTE is IP-based, the current permission model
of mobile devices cannot handle it. Strictly binding sockets from
any application to the data interface would be one way to prevent it.
In this way, SIP packets from an application cannot reach the SIP
server. The operators, in the same manner, should block packets from
the data interface. One limitation of this solution is that deploying
the solution would not be easy since all the ﬁrmware of mobile
devices should be updated. Furthermore, data encryption (e.g. IPsec
or TLS for signaling, and sRTP for media data) should be deployed
as speciﬁed in the 3GPP speciﬁcations [4, 5].
However, even with strict binding and encryption, an adversary
can still utilize tunneling since she has all permission for her phone.
Another way to resolve the problem is to process both call signal-
ing and voice data transmission in the CP as a traditional circuit-
switching call does. The CP only allows legitimate call related
requests and blocks all other packets utilizing the VoLTE interface
from the AP. Thus, an adversary cannot send manipulated packets
through the VoLTE interface. Furthermore, protecting the CP with
hardware security modules such as TrustZone or secure storage [6]
may also be required to prevent the adversary from intercepting SIP
messages in the CP.
7 Related Work
Accounting Issues in Cellular Network. Several research groups
have studied cellular accounting issues [14, 15, 25–27, 32]. There
are two main attacks related to accounting: accounting bypass and
overbilling.
Peng et al. demonstrated DNS port abuse for free-data [25].
In [26], the authors uncovered an accounting bypass by source
IP address spooﬁng because a mobile data charging system was
only based on the packet header. Go et al. wrapped their payload
in a TCP retransmission packet and utilized some ISPs that did not
charge a fee to ensure fairness [14, 15].
In addition to accounting bypass, overbilling attacks, also occur.
Go et al. pointed out that TCP retransmission could also be used
to impose a data fee on a victim. In [25], a large quantity of spam
data was sent to a victim using VoIP and a malicious phishing link.
The unfair billing practices of some operators were illuminated
in [27, 32].
While much research has been conducted on accounting bypass
and overbilling, our work is fundamentally different in terms of the
interface we used. Previous works only covered accounting issues
related to the data interface, whereas our work is focused on the
VoLTE interface. Furthermore, previous research studies assumed
that the overbilling attacks were committed by ﬁrst installing a
malicious application on the victim’s phone. In contrast, in our call
spooﬁng attack, the adversary only needs her own device.
VoIP Tunneling for Censorship Resistance. Much research has
been conducted on VoIP tunneling, with a speciﬁc focus on avoid-
ance of censorship. In general, VoIP services such as Skype are
widely used as tunneling protocols. Skypemorph sends Tor trafﬁc
through UDP ports via the Skype video call channel [22]. In [33],
the authors utilized RTP downstream to avoid censorship. In the
case of Freewave, data are converted to acoustic signal data and
loaded into normal VoIP packets to hide the data [19].
Our work also utilizes a tunneling protocol and data concealment.
However, our focus is on accounting bypass as well as discovery
of mis-implementation problems. In other words, the main goal of
our work for tunneling is different from that of previous works. In
fact, in contrast to previous works, which applied tunneling on the
Internet, our work is the ﬁrst to apply tunneling in cellular networks.
DoS Attack on Cellular Network. Various DoS attacks in cellular
networks have also been investigated. In general, most research on
DoS attacks has been related to the GSM Network [11, 16, 23,
28, 30]. Enck et al. suggested that sending SMS to certain phone
numbers compiled by a hit-list would massively affect the cellular
core network [11]. Traynor et al. [30] demonstrated that degrading
the cellular network service was possible with a cellular botnet.
Mulliner et al. [23] described how malformed SMS messages could
force mobile phones to be rebooted, and would ﬁnally overload
the network. Golde et al. [16] introduced a DoS attack because of
mis-authentication in the GSM network. Traynor et al. [31] pre-
sented DoS attacks exploiting the setup and teardown process of the
radio interface in the GPRS/EDGE network. The UMTS network
is still vulnerable to a targeted DoS. While Enck et al. utilized a
phone number on the GSM network, Qian et al. made a hit-list by
ﬁngerprinting IP addresses to carry out a targeted DoS on the core
network of UMTS [28].
In contrast to these attacks on GSM networks, the DoS attack
proposed in this paper is against the VoLTE network, and can be
initiated by a signiﬁcantly small number of mobile devices.
8 Future Work and Conclusion
We conducted an analysis of the VoLTE network of ﬁve operators in
the United States and South Korea. To the best of our knowledge,
we are the ﬁrst to analyze security issues on the VoLTE network.
The key contribution of our study is that VoLTE transition is not
simple, but involves the EPC core (3GPP standards), OS support at
UE, hardware interface redesign, and cellular accounting policies.
The main lesson is that it negates the common belief that VoLTE is
337a simple transition because VoIP is well understood on the Internet.
In contrast, it shows that architectural aspects of cellular networks
make the problem much more complex. Although we discovered a
few implementation bugs that are easy to ﬁx, the core problem is
complicated processes, involving accounting, access control, ses-
sion management, and EPC-UE interaction. This is evidenced by
the response from ISPs, Android, and US/KR CERTs to our respon-
sive disclosure. It requires greater attention because a systematic
security analysis of new architecture is always necessary to make
the architecture robust.
In this paper, we considered security issues and possible attacks
related to VoLTE call service after legitimate IMS registration. How-
ever, an attacker can also utilize a SIP REGISTER message to
perform other attacks. If there are vulnerabilities in the registration
phase, an attacker can control all access to a victim’s VoLTE service.
For example, she can carry out an imposter attack or even wiretap-
ping. We plan to investigate scenarios such as this in future work.
In this work, we concentrated on the problems and vulnerabilities
discovered in ﬁve operators; however, more problems and vulnera-
bilities may be present in these and other operators. As more and
more operators provide VoLTE services, it is essential that more
security analyses be conducted on VoLTE networks.
