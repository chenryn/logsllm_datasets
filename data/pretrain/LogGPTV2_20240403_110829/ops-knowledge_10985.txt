User: Trying to experiment with Beaker Notebooks, but I can not figure out how to launch from a specified directory. I've downloaded the .zip file (I'm on Windows 10), and can launch from that directory using the beaker.command batch file, but cannot figure out where to configure or set a separate launch directory for a specific notebook. With Jupyter notebooks, launching from the saved .ipynb file serves from that directory, but I cannot figure out how to do the same for Beaker notebooks.
Does anyone know the correct method to serve a Beaker Notebook from various parent directories?
Thanks.
Assistant: If you want to change the current working directory, I don't think that's possible.
But if you want to serve files as in make them available to the web server that creates the page, use ~/.beaker/v1/web as described in the "Generating and accessing web content" tutorial.
