When a navigation bar (navbar) dropdown is left open in collapsed (mobile) mode and the screen is then resized to horizontal (desktop) mode, the dropdown may not function correctly.

To address this issue, it might be beneficial to automatically close all dropdowns when switching from collapsed (mobile) mode to horizontal (desktop) mode. This would ensure a smoother and more consistent user experience.

For reference, you can see an example of the navbar at: [http://getbootstrap.com/examples/navbar/](http://getbootstrap.com/examples/navbar/)
