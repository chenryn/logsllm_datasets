experiments 20 times and used the average EERs to show the 
effect of attacks. 
Figure  9  shows  the  changes  of  average  EERs  between 
statistical attack and zero-effort attack for each of 161 subjects 
in  cumulative  distribution  function  (CDF)  graphs.  Using 
EERs of zero-effort attack as the baseline, EER changes less 
than or equal to 0 indicate the statistical attack has no effect. 
For EER changes greater than 0, the statistical attack exhibits 
a  positive  effect.  The  larger  the  EER  changes,  the  more 
significant is the statistical attack. 
Figure 9 shows that while the accuracies of the behavioral 
authentication models are undermined by the statistical attack, 
the  performance  of  physiological  and  combined  selected 
models are less influenced. Figure 9a shows, for physiological 
models trained with 30 samples, 80% of the subjects are not 
affected by statistical attacks. For the selected model, about 
70% of the subjects are not affected by the statistical attacks. 
Figure 9b shows if trained with more legitimate samples, the 
resilience  to  statistical  attacks  will  become  better.  For  the 
selected model trained with 100 samples, we have about 87% 
of the subjects not affected by the statistical attack. 
  Tables XI and XII show averaged EERs under statistical 
attacks over all 161 subjects for models trained with 30 and 
100 samples respectively. With the averaged EERs of zero-
effort attacks as baselines, the tables show the overall impact

of  statistical  attacks  for  the  whole  population.  The  results 
show that the statistical attack does not have much effect on 
the  authentication  model  built  using  only  physiological 
features.  In  fact,  for  physiological  model  trained  with  100 
samples, we note that the average EER under statistical attacks 
is 2.17%. It is even lower than the baseline EER of 2.94%. 
Thus  although  the  authentication  model  built  on  pure 
behavioral  features  are  undermined,  with  help  of  the 
physiological  features,  the  authentication  model  using  both 
selected  physiological  and  behavioral  features  also  shows 
some  resilience to  the  statistical attack.  Compared  with  the 
behavioral  model,  its  EERs  only  increased  from  3.02%  for 
baseline to 4.69% for statistical attack in Table XI and from 
1.88% for baseline to 2.43% for statistical attack in Table XII. 
  We speculate that the strong resilience to statistical attacks 
with  physiological  models  is  due  to  the  stability  and 
distinctiveness  of  physiological  features.  This  makes  the 
legitimate ranges of physiological features small and feature 
values of different subjects widely separated. Thus the most 
probable feature values drawn from a population in statistical 
attacks actually cannot fit into the ranges of many legitimate 
users.

Usability  is  a  very  important  factor  for  authentication 
systems  on  smart  devices  such  as  smartphones.  We

Fig. 10. Average ratings for the four usability questions 
try  different  TFST  gesture  authentications  on  smartphones 
with  different  screen  sizes.  These  participants  are  different 
from  the  subjects  involved in  previous  data collections  and 
were not familiar with the TFST gestures. They were asked to 
rate  TFST  gesture  authentication  from  the  following  4 
perspectives and to compare it to the commonly used methods 
of passcode and pattern lock: 1) Is it easy to memorize? 2) Is 
it fast to login in? 3) Is it convenient to perform? 4) Is it less 
error  prone?  For  each  question,  we  use  3  (1-3)  levels 
representing responses of “disagree”, “neutral” and “agree”.  
The  subjects  were  asked  to  evaluate  TFST  gesture 
authentications  on  two  smartphones  and  one  tablet  of  3 
different screen sizes (4”, 5.3” and 8.4”). The subjects were 
asked to perform the 3-finger vertical swipe and 3-finger L 
swipe on 4” smartphone, the 4-finger vertical swipe and 4-
finger  L  swipe  on  the  5.3”  smartphone  and  the  4-finger  L 
swipe on the 8.4” tablet. Before answering the questionnaire, 
each subject tried all of the gestures more than 20 times on 
each device. The average ratings for different authentication 
methods calculated from the resulted 158 questionnaires are 
shown in Figure 10 with results of TFST gestures highlighted 
in the red box.  
Figure 10 shows that compared to the standard methods, 
the evaluated gestures are regarded easier to memorize; 4 out 
of 5 gestures are regarded faster for login and less error prone. 
For convenience, there are 4 out of 5 gestures rated better than 
passcode and 2 out of 5 rated better than pattern lock. The 3 
finger  L  swipe  on  the  4”  screen  is  the  lowest  rated  TFST 
gesture, but it is still rated better than pattern lock in 2 out of 
4 aspects, and better than passcode in 3 out of 4 aspects. 
This  result  demonstrates  that  user  acceptance  of  TFST 
gesture  authentication  method 
is  high  compared  with 
traditional methods of passcode and pattern lock. Our methods 
are  generally  regarded  as  easy,  fast  and  convenient.  The 
gestures  do  not  incur  too  much  cognitive  load  on  the  user. 
Thus, for devices with small screen sizes such as 4”, 3 finger 
TFST  gestures  are  able  to  provide  good  usability  with 
relatively  good  security.  For  devices  with  5.3”  or  larger 
screens,  4  finger  TFST  gestures  are  able  to  provide  good 
usability and good security simultaneously.

X.  RELATED WORK 
Behavioral  biometrics,  which  identify  a  person  by 
analyzing his own behavioral traits, are becoming a hot topic 
on smartphones, with the help of various embedded sensors 
and  devices  such  as  accelerometer,  gyroscope  and  touch 
screen.  Authentication  approaches  using  gait  recognition, 
keystroke  dynamics,  and  touch  gestures  are  proposed  and 
investigated on smartphones and other mobile devices. 
Gait  Recognition:  This  authentication  method  relies  on 
sensor data from accelerometers and gyroscopes and analyzes 
the way how a user walks to authenticate the user. Mantyjarvi 
[4]  proposed  an  approach  of  identifying  persons  by  using 
characteristics in the acceleration signal produced by walking 
with a portable sensor device in 2005. In 2010, Kwapisz [5] 
utilized  accelerometers  in  smartphones  to  identify  and 
authenticate  cellphone  users  based  on  their  normal  daily 
activities.  But  both  Mantyjarvi  and  Kwapisz  assumed  the 
smartphone is fixed on some part of the user’s body, which is 
too strict for normal usages of smartphones. In 2014, Lu [6] 
came  up  with  a  gait  verification  system  for  mobile  phones 
without assumption of body placement or device orientation. 
However,  all  gait  recognition  approaches  require 
the 
observation of a certain period of users’ behaviors which is 
not  suitable  for  common  authentication  scenarios  such  as 
screen unlocking requiring a quick authentication. 
Keystroke dynamics: This methods analyzes the manner 
and  the  rhythm  of  typing  characters  on  a  keypad  or  soft 
keyboard  to  authenticate  users.  It  was  first  applied  in 
authenticating users on PC systems with desktop keyboard [7, 
8]. Afterwards, keystroke dynamics has been investigated to 
authenticate users of mobile devices. Clarke et al. [9] in 2003 
conducted a feasibility study of using keystroke dynamics to 
authenticate users on mobile handsets. Then in 2012, Zheng 
et al. [10] utilized tapping behaviors for user verification on 
touchscreen smartphone, and extracted four types of features 
to distinguish the legitimate user and impostors. Giu(cid:31)rida et 
al.  [11]  proposed  a  new  biometric  mechanism  by  sensor-
enhanced keystroke dynamics in 2014. They asked subjects to 
type  fixed-texts  and  characterized  users’  identity  via  the

information.  Keystroke  dynamics 
Gesture  based  authentication:  With  the  popularity  of 
smartphones,  touchscreens  have  recently  become  a  leading 
input device. Gesture based authentication utilizes the detailed 
information  of  how  users  perform  certain  gestures  on 
touchscreens to verify the identities of users [12-14,34,35]. In 
2012, De Luca et al. [12] proposed a pattern lock enhancement 
method. They designed an unlocking pattern with 4 gestures: 
horizontal,  vertical,  vertical  with  two  fingers  and  diagonal, 
and  collected  30,720  unlocks  data  from  48  subjects.  They 
reported a best accuracy of 57% among four gestures. They 
also implemented the gesture based authentication as a hidden 
security  layer  for  a  pattern  lock.  With  34  subjects’  data 
consisting of XY-coordinates, pressure, size, time and speed, 
they  achieved  an  average  77%  accuracy.  De  Luca  et  al. 
performed a pioneering study on mobile authentications using 
simple touch gestures. However, the reported accuracies are 
not  satisfactory  for  real-world  implementations  and  the 
important  issue  of  behavioral  variances  was  not  closely 
examined.  Cai  et  al.  proposed  another  approach 
to 
authenticate users using common touch gestures such as drag, 
zoom-in  and  zoom-out  [34].  But  the  authentication  process 
lasts more than 6 seconds, which makes it difficult to be used 
for the frequent phone unlocks. 
Shahzad et al. [13] presented GEAT, a gesture based user 
authentication system for the secure unlocking of touch screen 
devices.  They  designed  39  gestures  and  chose  the  10  most 
e(cid:31)ective  gestures.  They  extracted  features  like  finger 
velocity,  accelerator  readings,  and  stroke  time  to  recognize 
users. With samples from 50 volunteers, the authors achieved 
an  average  EER  of  4.8%  with  1  gesture  and  1.7%  with  3 
gestures.  Sherman  et  al.  [35]  studied  free-form  multi-touch 
gestures with any number of fingers for mobile authentication. 
The technique is different from the TFST gestures proposed 
in  this  paper.  Both  Shahzad  and  Sherman  used  behavioral 
characteristics  for  authentication,  but  they  did  not  perform 
extensive investigations of behavioral variability either.  
Sae-Bae  et  al.  proposed  an  interesting  approach  to  use 
five-finger gestures on multi-touch screen for authentication 
[36,14].  They  defined  a  set  of  22  multi-touch  gestures  and
