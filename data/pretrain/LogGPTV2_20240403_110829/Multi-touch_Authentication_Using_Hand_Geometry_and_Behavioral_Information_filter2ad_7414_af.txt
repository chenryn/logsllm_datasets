### Experimental Setup and Results

To evaluate the impact of attacks, we conducted 20 experiments and calculated the average Equal Error Rates (EERs). Figure 9 illustrates the changes in average EERs between statistical attacks and zero-effort attacks for each of the 161 subjects, presented as cumulative distribution function (CDF) graphs. The EERs from the zero-effort attack were used as the baseline. EER changes less than or equal to 0 indicate that the statistical attack had no effect, while EER changes greater than 0 indicate a positive effect of the statistical attack. The larger the EER change, the more significant the impact of the statistical attack.

#### Analysis of Attack Impact

Figure 9 shows that the accuracy of behavioral authentication models is undermined by statistical attacks, whereas the performance of physiological and combined selected models is less affected. Specifically, for physiological models trained with 30 samples, 80% of the subjects were not affected by the statistical attacks (Figure 9a). For the selected model, approximately 70% of the subjects were unaffected. When trained with more legitimate samples, the resilience to statistical attacks improved. For the selected model trained with 100 samples, about 87% of the subjects were not affected by the statistical attack (Figure 9b).

Tables XI and XII present the averaged EERs under statistical attacks for all 161 subjects, for models trained with 30 and 100 samples, respectively. Using the averaged EERs of zero-effort attacks as baselines, these tables show the overall impact of statistical attacks on the entire population. The results indicate that statistical attacks have minimal effect on the authentication model built using only physiological features. In fact, for the physiological model trained with 100 samples, the average EER under statistical attacks was 2.17%, even lower than the baseline EER of 2.94%. 

Although the authentication model built on pure behavioral features is compromised, the inclusion of physiological features enhances the model's resilience to statistical attacks. For example, the EERs for the selected model increased from 3.02% (baseline) to 4.69% (statistical attack) in Table XI and from 1.88% (baseline) to 2.43% (statistical attack) in Table XII.

We hypothesize that the strong resilience of physiological models to statistical attacks is due to the stability and distinctiveness of physiological features. This makes the legitimate ranges of physiological features small and feature values of different subjects widely separated. Consequently, the most probable feature values drawn from a population in statistical attacks do not fit into the legitimate ranges of many users.

### Usability Study

Usability is a critical factor for authentication systems on smart devices such as smartphones. To investigate the usability of TFST gesture authentication, we invited 158 undergraduate students to try different TFST gesture authentications on smartphones with varying screen sizes. These participants were different from those involved in previous data collections and were not familiar with TFST gestures. They were asked to rate TFST gesture authentication from four perspectives and compare it to commonly used methods like passcode and pattern lock:
1. Is it easy to memorize?
2. Is it fast to log in?
3. Is it convenient to perform?
4. Is it less error-prone?

For each question, we used a 3-point scale (1-3) representing "disagree," "neutral," and "agree." Participants evaluated TFST gesture authentications on two smartphones and one tablet with screen sizes of 4", 5.3", and 8.4". They performed the 3-finger vertical swipe and 3-finger L swipe on the 4" smartphone, the 4-finger vertical swipe and 4-finger L swipe on the 5.3" smartphone, and the 4-finger L swipe on the 8.4" tablet. Each participant tried all gestures more than 20 times on each device before answering the questionnaire. The average ratings from the 158 questionnaires are shown in Figure 10, with TFST gesture results highlighted in the red box.

Figure 10 indicates that compared to standard methods, the evaluated gestures are generally easier to memorize, faster for login, and less error-prone. For convenience, 4 out of 5 gestures were rated better than passcode, and 2 out of 5 were rated better than pattern lock. The 3-finger L swipe on the 4" screen was the lowest-rated TFST gesture but still rated better than pattern lock in 2 out of 4 aspects and better than passcode in 3 out of 4 aspects.

These results demonstrate high user acceptance of TFST gesture authentication compared to traditional methods. Our methods are generally regarded as easy, fast, and convenient, without incurring significant cognitive load on the user. For devices with small screen sizes (e.g., 4"), 3-finger TFST gestures provide good usability with relatively good security. For devices with 5.3" or larger screens, 4-finger TFST gestures offer both good usability and security.

### Related Work

Behavioral biometrics, which identify individuals by analyzing their behavioral traits, are gaining attention on smartphones, thanks to various embedded sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, and touchscreens. Authentication approaches using gait recognition, keystroke dynamics, and touch gestures have been proposed and investigated on smartphones and other mobile devices.

#### Gait Recognition

Gait recognition relies on sensor data from accelerometers and gyroscopes to analyze how a user walks for authentication. Mantyjarvi [4] proposed an approach in 2005 to identify persons using characteristics in the acceleration signal produced by walking with a portable sensor device. Kwapisz [5] utilized accelerometers in smartphones in 2010 to authenticate cellphone users based on their normal daily activities. However, both studies assumed the smartphone was fixed on the user's body, which is impractical for typical usage. Lu [6] developed a gait verification system for mobile phones in 2014 without such assumptions. Despite these advancements, gait recognition requires observing a certain period of user behavior, making it unsuitable for quick authentication scenarios like screen unlocking.

#### Keystroke Dynamics

Keystroke dynamics analyze the manner and rhythm of typing characters on a keypad or soft keyboard to authenticate users. Initially applied to PC systems with desktop keyboards [7, 8], keystroke dynamics have since been investigated for mobile devices. Clarke et al. [9] conducted a feasibility study in 2003, and Zheng et al. [10] used tapping behaviors for user verification on touchscreen smartphones in 2012. Giu(cid:31)rida et al. [11] proposed a new biometric mechanism using sensor-enhanced keystroke dynamics in 2014. While keystroke dynamics rely on behavioral features, the impact of long-term behavioral variability has not been extensively studied.

#### Gesture-Based Authentication

With the popularity of smartphones, touchscreens have become a leading input device. Gesture-based authentication uses detailed information on how users perform certain gestures to verify their identities [12-14, 34, 35]. De Luca et al. [12] proposed a pattern lock enhancement method in 2012, achieving a best accuracy of 57% among four gestures. They also implemented gesture-based authentication as a hidden security layer for pattern locks, achieving an average 77% accuracy. Cai et al. [34] proposed another approach using common touch gestures, but the process lasted more than 6 seconds, making it impractical for frequent phone unlocks.

Shahzad et al. [13] presented GEAT, a gesture-based user authentication system, achieving an average EER of 4.8% with 1 gesture and 1.7% with 3 gestures. Sherman et al. [35] studied free-form multi-touch gestures for mobile authentication. Both Shahzad and Sherman used behavioral characteristics but did not extensively investigate behavioral variability.

Sae-Bae et al. [36, 14] proposed an interesting approach using five-finger gestures on multi-touch screens for authentication, defining a set of 22 multi-touch gestures.
