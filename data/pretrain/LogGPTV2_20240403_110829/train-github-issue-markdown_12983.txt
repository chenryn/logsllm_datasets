For cases where a small amount of static data is desired. This could include
  1. configuration for containers whose process is configured by files
  2. small-medium amounts of static data, such as an archive of www data for a static site server
  3. inputs to a process that has a small input to work ratio
Example use cases:
  * allow developers to specify data along side the pod it's used with, instead of needing to put it "somewhere else" (EBS / PD / RBD)
  * allow Kubernetes-native process coordinators to pass input data to worker pods
For developers, this would be facilitated by a kubectl plugin (#13606) in a
similar way to what is proposed for easing secret creation (#4822). The plugin
would handle archive creation and encoding for inclusion in the manifest.
The size of this data would be limited, as it would be living in etcd. I don't
know what a reasonable limit is as I'm not familiar enough with etcd. I would
assume a couple hundred KB at the most?
