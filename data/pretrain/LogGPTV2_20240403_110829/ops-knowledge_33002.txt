User: I want to run my Matlab function (test.m) from Python. I converted the function to an exe file test.exe using mcc -m command of Matlab; and I can run it test.exe from command prompt of windows. 
On the other side, when I run exe files using os.system and subprocess.call by Python, it works well:
subprocess.call('C:\Program Files\DVD Maker\DVDMaker.exe',shell=True)
(My DVDMaker opens)
But when I run
subprocess.call('C:\...\test.exe',shell=True)
I receive this:
The filename, directory name or volume label syntax is incorrect.
Assistant: Possible issues:

You did not install MCR.
