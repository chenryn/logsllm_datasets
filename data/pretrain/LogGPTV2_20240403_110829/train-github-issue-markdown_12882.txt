Thank u for the excellent works on next@5.  
I found that it uses 'blob:http://localhost:3000/0xxxxxxx' to load css/scss
into the page after dom is rendered.  
So the users will see the page without styles about 1 or 2 seconds. I believe
it is the only behavior in development mode at first.  
So I tried build with `yarn build` & run server in production model with `yarn
start`.But this time, I see no css files loaded.  
Did I miss something or this is designed?
