Thank you for the excellent work on next@5.

I noticed that in development mode, CSS/SCSS files are loaded using URLs like `blob:http://localhost:3000/xxxxxxxx` after the DOM is rendered. This causes a delay of about 1-2 seconds during which the page appears without any styles. Initially, I assumed this behavior was specific to the development environment.

To test this, I built the project with `yarn build` and then ran the server in production mode using `yarn start`. However, in this setup, no CSS files were loaded at all.

Am I missing something, or is this an intended design?
