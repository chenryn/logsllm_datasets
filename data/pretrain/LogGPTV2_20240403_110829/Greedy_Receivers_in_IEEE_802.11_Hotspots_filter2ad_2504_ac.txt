and GS-GR under a varying wireless link loss
rate. The x-axis shows bit error rate on the
top and data frame error rate on the bottom.
Summary: Our evaluation shows that increasing
NAV is an eﬀective greedy misbehavior. As we would
expect, a larger NAV increase or a larger greedy per-
centage increases the gain of greedy receivers. Fur-
thermore, the damage is larger when a greedy receiver
has a separate sender from normal receivers than when
the sender is shared. Finally, the impact of NAV in-
ﬂation in TCP depends on which frames the greedy
receiver manipulates: the impact of NAV inﬂation in
CTS or ACK frames in TCP is smaller than that in
UDP; however the impact on TCP traﬃc can further
increase when the greedy receiver also modiﬁes RTS
and data frames corresponding to TCP ACK packet.
5.2 Misbehavior 2: Spooﬁng ACKs
We evaluate misbehavior 2 using TCP traﬃc since
this misbehavior targets TCP. We use a 4-node topol-
ogy (2 senders sending to 2 receivers), where all the
wireless nodes are within communication range of each
other for evaluation. The loss rates on all wireless links
(e.g., N S-N R, GS-GR, N S-GR and GS-N R) are the
same.
Vary bit error rate: First we examine the impact
of a greedy receiver by varying bit error rate (BER).
The greedy receiver spoofs MAC-layer ACKs for ev-
ery data packet it sniﬀs from the sender to the nor-
mal receiver (i.e., GP=100). Fig. 7 shows the goodput
of both receivers when one of them misbehaves ver-
sus when neither misbehaves. The x-axis shows both
bit error rate and the corresponding data frame error
rate. We make the following observations. First, when
neither misbehaves, the two receivers get similar good-
put. Their goodput both decreases with an increasing
BER. In comparison, when one of them misbehaves,
the greedy receiver gets signiﬁcantly higher goodput
than the normal receiver. Moreover, we observe that
when BER is lower than 2e−4, the greedy receiver gets
an increasing gain as loss rate increases. This is be-
cause an increasing loss rate means that more packets
to the normal receiver have to be recovered at TCP
layer after spooﬁng MAC-layer ACKs, thereby increas-
ing the eﬀectiveness of greedy misbehavior. When BER
is higher than 2e−4, the greedy receiver’s goodput gain
gradually decreases because the number of data packets
it overhears decreases, thereby decreasing the number
of spoofed ACKs. Moreover, an increasing loss rate be-
tween the greedy receiver and its sender also degrades
its TCP goodput. In an extreme, when the loss rate is

high enough, both TCP ﬂows get virtually zero good-
put regardless of whether one misbehaves or not.
Vary greedy percentage: Next we evaluate the im-
pact of greedy percentage (i.e., how often the greedy
receiver spoofs an ACK when it sniﬀs the other sender’s
data packet). Fig. 8 summarizes the results. As we
would expect, the goodput of greedy receiver increases
with GP. This is true over all loss rate values. For low
loss rate, the eﬀect of spooﬁng is limited because most
packets are correctly received at the normal receiver.
For moderate loss rate, a signiﬁcant number of pack-
ets are lost at the normal receiver, making spooﬁng
ACK an eﬀective attack. For high loss rate, spooﬁng
ACK continues to allow the greedy receiver to get more
goodput than the normal receiver, even though it also
suﬀers degradation due to the high loss rate.
Vary the number of greedy receivers: We fur-
ther evaluate the performance of 2 TCP ﬂows under
0, 1, or 2 greedy receivers. As shown in Fig. 9, the
total goodput decreases when both receivers misbe-
have. This is because in this case both receivers spoof
the other’s MAC-layer ACK, which eﬀectively disables
MAC-layer retransmission and makes the loss propa-
gated to TCP layer. A larger GP causes MAC-layer
retransmission to be disabled more often, and results
in larger reduction in goodput.
Vary the number of sender-receiver pairs: Next
we consider one greedy receiver competes with a vary-
ing number of normal receivers. Fig. 10(a) compares
the average goodput of a greedy receiver and normal
receivers when they share one AP, and Fig. 10(b) shows
the results when each receiver receive data from a dif-
ferent AP. As they show, in both cases the average
throughput of greedy receiver is higher than that of the
normal receivers. Moreover, the goodput diﬀerence be-
tween the greedy and normal receivers is larger under
multiple APs due to lack of head-of-line blocking.

senders, where both wireless links to the

TCP sender at remote site: So far we consider the
connections span only wireless links. Next we consider
the case where the two connections span both wireless
and wireline links, as shown in Fig. 11(a). We vary the
wired link latency from 2ms to 400ms, and set BER
of both wireless links to 2e−5. Fig. 11 compares good-
put under no greedy receiver versus under one greedy
receiver (R2 is a greedy receiver in this case). We ob-
serve that increasing wireline latency initially increases
the gap between the normal and greedy receiver. This
is because an increasing wireline latency makes end-
to-end loss recovery more expensive. When the wire-
line latency is beyond 200ms, the goodput of greedy
receiver starts to decrease, even though it still signif-
icantly out-performs the normal receiver. This is be-
cause TCP ACK-clocking reduces its goodput as delay
increases, and the goodput gain from the normal re-
ceiver is not enough to oﬀset such drop.
5.3 Misbehavior 3: Sending Fake ACKs
For misbehavior 3, a greedy receiver sends an ACK
even upon receiving a corrupted data frame. This
misbehavior is eﬀective when the greedy receiver uses
UDP, and the source and the destination address in
the corrupted DATA frame are preserved. As shown
in Table 1, this is quite common. We create data loss
using one of the following two ways. We disable RTS-
CTS exchange and place two receivers next to each
other and senders far apart from each other to create
the hidden terminal problem. Alternatively, we create
loss by injecting random loss of bit-error-rate (BER)
of 2e−5 when the two sender-receiver pairs are within
communication range of each other. In both cases, the
two ﬂows experience similar loss rates.
Vary greedy percentage: As shown in Fig. 12, an
increasing greedy percentage increases the discrepancy

between the goodput of the normal and greedy re-
ceivers. When GP=100% (i.e., greedy receiver fakes
ACK on every corrupted data packet), the greedy re-
ceiver shuts oﬀ the other connection. This is because
faking ACKs makes GS’s contention window (CW)
considerably smaller than N S’s CW.
Vary the number of greedy receivers: Next we
compare the performance when both receivers are
greedy.
Interestingly, the performance would depend
on the types of losses. Under congestion-related losses
due to hidden terminal, both greedy receivers suf-
fer. Their goodput is reduced by 48%. This is be-
cause faking ACK eﬀectively disables exponential back-
oﬀ in 802.11 and senders send faster than they should,
creating more collisions.
In comparison, when the
loss is non-congestion related (e.g., low received sig-
nal strength), faking ACKs improve the goodput by
2-12% when data frame loss rate varies from 0.2 to
0.8, as shown in Table 2. This is because under non-
congestion loss, performing exponential back-oﬀ does
not help reduce losses and only unnecessarily reduces
the sending rate. Faking ACKs avoids such unneces-
sary rate reduction and improves performance.
Diﬀerent loss rates on the two ﬂows: Our next
evaluation is to understand whether a greedy receiver’s
performance gain under packet losses is no more than
a normal receiver when its link is loss free. So we in-
ject random loss to only one ﬂow, and let both re-
ceivers behave normally. When both ﬂows have BER
of 5e−4, the greedy and normal receivers obtain 2.61
Mbps and 1.086 Mbps, respectively.
In comparison,
when both receivers are normal, one ﬂow with BER
of 5e−4, and the other with no loss, the one with no
loss has 2.64Mbps and the other has 1.096 Mbps. So
eﬀectively the greedy receiver pretends to be a normal
receiver without packet losses. Under non-congestion
loss, faking ACKs can be considered as a useful sur-
viving technique. However, this is not recommended
under congestion losses.
Vary the number of sender-receiver pairs: Fi-
nally we consider one greedy receiver competes with a
varying number of normal receivers, where all of them
