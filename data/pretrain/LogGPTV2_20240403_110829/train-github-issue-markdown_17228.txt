`ss2zpk` is implemented as
    return tf2zpk(*ss2tf(A, B, C, D, input=input))
Please don't go through transfer-function form as it throws away numerical
accuracy.
I am not sure of the best way to implement ss2zpk. The poles are easy: get the
eigenvalues. Not sure about the zeros.
Related to the inverse function #5912.
