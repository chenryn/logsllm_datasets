The magnetic ﬁeld strength of a magnetic stripe
card imposed on a read head is by default small, ap-
proximately 24 µT [26], and becomes even smaller
as the distance between the card and read head in-
crease. Magnetic ﬁeld intensity is heavily affected
by distance and falls off at a rate of approximately
r3, where r is the distance in meters [26]. For exam-
ple, if the magnetic stripe card and the read head are
separated by only 1 mm the magnetic ﬁeld intensity
of the card imposed on the read head is approxi-
mately 2.4× 10−14 T, similar to that emitted by the
human brain [13].
Due to this decrease in ﬁeld intensity, guidance
from both commercial reader manufacturers [38]
and parts sellers [3] explicitly mention the need to
apply force between the card and the head (illus-
trated in Figure 8):

Figure 9: This is the entire Skim Reaper device, consist-
ing of the microcontroller system (left) and the measure-
ment card (right). The card is inserted into a card accep-
tor, where the number of read heads is measured by the
microcontroller. After the user indicates that the test is
complete, the user is notiﬁed if a skimmer was detected.
Figure 10: On the measurement card, a pattern of traces
pass over read heads for detection. The black lines on the
left indicate the pattern and position of the traces, which
are aligned to the expected data track locations (shown
on right for comparison). When a read head passes over
the card, the traces are bridged and a circuit is completed.
The traces are separated by 0.1 mm of space, which is
over an order of magnitude smaller than the smallest read
head we encountered.
Skim Reaper. The device, shown in Figure 9, consists of
a payment card-sized board and a microcontroller sys-
tem, which provides 3.3 V to the card and performs anal-
ysis. The card is intended to be inserted into the card
acceptor on a payment device, and relies on the proper-
ties of magnetic read heads discussed above to improve
detection and increase the difﬁculty in developing effec-
tive countermeasures.
As we previously discussed, the skimmers identiﬁed
in our NYPD data set are designed to press a metallic
read head against the card during capture. Our system
relies on these two properties and expects read heads in
the card acceptor to contact our card and bridge a pair
of electrical traces, which complete a circuit back to the
microcontroller. To ensure correct alignment, the card is
the height and thickness of a standard payment card. On
this card, we placed a series of split copper interconnec-
tions aligned with the ISO-standard locations [29, 30] for
the three card tracks, as shown in Figure 10. This design
ensures that if a skimmer is aligned to read a particular

ness of the Skim Reaper.
card track, it will also pass over our traces.
The distance between each trace is 0.1 mm, which is
over an order of magnitude smaller than the shortest track
read length we observed (1.5 mm). As a result, these read
heads will bridge the traces, complete the circuit, and be
counted. We mirrored the traces on the card and placed
the wires to the top of one side; this allows the card to
successfully contact read heads in any conﬁguration of
both dip- and swipe-style readers.
During early prototyping, we encountered problems
creating PCB masks that met our 0.1 mm needs; this
level of precision is difﬁcult to obtain by hand. We over-
came this by spray painting bare copper-clad board then
used a laser cutter to vaporize the areas not covered by
the mask. We then chemically etched the board and re-
moved the leftover spray paint with acetone. This is a
time-consuming, manual process with each card taking
several hours to ﬁnish. As our design choices became
ﬁnalized, we encountered a different problem with this
method: the chemical bath would occasionally dissolve
the copper underneath the spray paint, leading to a high
manufacturing failure rate. We produced our ﬁnal proto-
type device using PCBs produced in a professional fab-
rication facility based on our circuit diagrams.
The analysis device consists of an Adafruit [1] Ar-
duino based microcontroller which applies voltage to one
half of the traces and monitors for circuit completion on
the opposite half. To prevent noise in the signal from
causing false positives, the device samples the card, aver-
ages every 20 samples to counter the effects of having an
imperfect ground, and compares it to a threshold. If the
value is above the threshold, one is added to the current
read head count. The microcontroller waits for the aver-
age voltage to drop back below the threshold, which in-
dicates that the read head has fully passed over the card.
After this the microcontroller begins again looking for
an average voltage above the threshold. This repeats un-
til the user indicates that the test is complete.
When counting the read heads in a card acceptor, the
count can vary depending on the type of reader. For ex-
ample, in a swipe-style reader, each read head passes

Figure 12: As the Skim Reaper passes over read heads, the microcontroller measures the voltage returned from the
measurement card, shown above. The voltage spike indicates that a read head was encountered as a circuit is completed
using the head. In dip mode, the device internally halves the count because each head passes over the card twice (once
on insert and once on removal). We used the Sankyo MCM2PO reader with our custom skimmer for conﬁrmation
testing in dip mode, and we used a standard stripe reader (1 head) and a stripe encoder (2 heads) for testing in swipe
mode.
over the card only once. In dip-style readers, however,
each head will pass the card twice: once on insert and
once on removal. Due to this use case, our device has
a switch to allow the user to identify the type of reader
being examined.
Finally, the Skim Reaper uses this count to alert the
user to the presence of skimmers. If more than one read
head is detected, the user is alerted. If one read head is
detected, a notiﬁcation appears that the reader appears
to be normal. In other conditions (including zero heads
detected), an error is displayed.
5 Conﬁrmation and Analysis
We now describe our experimental evaluations of the
Skim Reaper and show that our system is effective in de-
tecting overlay and deep-insert skimmers.
5.1 Conﬁrmation
During our initial design, we needed to quickly test pro-
totype iterations. Skimmers are difﬁcult and expensive
to obtain; “retail” prices for overlays can reach hundreds
of dollars for the bezel alone (without electronics or read
heads, which can easily triple the price of a complete
unit) [2]. Many skimmer sellers require the customer to
wire funds with no guarantee of receiving the item. Fur-
thermore, it is unclear whether these businesses are legit-
imate or if the funds are used for criminal purposes. To
avoid needing to purchase a skimmer, we ﬁrst designed
and built a skimmer suitable for testing.
We purchased a Sankyo MCM2PO reader and de-
signed and 3D-printed a conspicuous, brightly-colored
overlay skimmer for it, shown in Figure 11. The Sankyo
device is an OEM replacement part for a gas pump
payment terminal. Our overlay extends the card track
from the original card reader, holding a standard Square
Reader in the track. Since our detector detects the pres-
ence of the read head, the Square Reader does not need
to be further connected to any device (e.g., for decoding).
Testing the Skim Reaper with this skimmer is the same
process as detecting any other skimmer: We select the
dip mode on the device, enable detection, insert the card
into the card track, then remove it. We performed this
task with and without the skimmer attached to verify that
our system correctly identiﬁes its presence. Figure 12
shows our device as it encounters heads. As the card
passes over read heads, the circuit completes, creating a
voltage spike. Since the card passes over each read head
multiple times in dip mode (once on insert and once on
removal), the number of spikes seen is double the num-
ber of heads.

detected all of these skimmers.
5.2 NYPD Evidence Set
While our testing with commercially-available read
heads was successful, we observed that the readers ex-
amined in Section 3 had much smaller heads. We again
partnered with the NYPD Financial Crimes Task Force
to obtain skimmers from evidence storage4. In total, we
obtained access to ten external-access skimmers consist-
ing of eight overlays and two deep-inserts. Each of these
skimmers is shown in Figure 13. Many of these skim-
mers were conﬁscated in campaigns identiﬁed by the
BOLOs we discussed in Section 3. As a result, these
skimmers represent a realistic subset of the skimmers
found in New York City. We had no access to these skim-
mers prior to building our prototype Skim Reaper device.
Except for a single deep-insert skimmer, we also did
not have access to the payment devices the skimmers
were designed to attack. For the remainder of the de-
vices, we used a modiﬁed protocol: Since the detection
alert is based on the number of detected read heads, we
can verify that our system will detect a skimmer by ob-
serving whether it detects a single read head when in-
serted into only the skimmer. We tested the Skim Reaper
against each of these skimmers ﬁve times and recorded
whether or not it successfully detected the skimmer. The
4The skimmers were from closed cases.
Skim Reaper successfully detected the skimmers in all
ﬁve attempts on all of the skimmers.
The deep-insert skimmer we were provided with its
payment terminal did not contain an additional read head
like others we have observed.
Instead, it appeared to
use thin 30 AWG solid-core bare copper wires bent up-
wards, away from the skimmer, to physically tap the ex-
isting magnetic read head. We discovered this mecha-
nism after our system successfully detected the skimmer
and we removed the skimmer from the payment device.
We disassembled the payment device to learn more about
this mechanism and discovered that the ﬂexible ﬂat rib-
bon cable used to connect the read head to the body of
the payment device was not coated. As a result, the
cable provided an exposed electrical connection to the
read head. Unfortunately, we were not able to determine
whether this device worked since removing it from the
skimmer damaged the tap mechanism. We believe this
is a hardware vulnerability stemming from the lack of
coating on the cable, though successfully executing this
attack requires the attacker to have some luck to accu-
rately place thin copper wires onto thin copper traces on
the ribbon cable without visibility. Regardless, our sys-
tem detected the deep-insert since the body of the skim-
mer was metal and still contacted the measurement card.

Figure 14: We recorded the raw magnetic signal from a skimmer’s head with and without tape attached to it. Tape
could be used to reduce the conductivity of the head as a countermeasure, but this ultimately fails as the signal is
reduced to the point of being unreadable.
5.3 Ongoing Detection
The Skim Reaper successfully detects every overlay and
deep-insert skimmer we have obtained, and as we have
shown, making these undetectable relies on overcoming
current limitations in reading magnetic stripes, conﬁrm-
ing our hypothesis. Using the properties of skimming
technology, our system provides a substantial beneﬁt to
consumers and law enforcement ofﬁcers who wish to
identify the presence of skimmers earlier.
The NYPD Financial Crimes Task Force requested a
set of Skim Reaper devices for use in the ﬁeld, which
we provided. These devices are now being used by de-
tectives in the ﬁeld to proactively identify skimmers or
verify skimmers are present when investigating a com-
plaint.
6 Countermeasures and Discussion
During the course of testing the Skim Reaper, we had the
opportunity to closely observe skimmer technology. In
this section, we discuss adversarial countermeasures to
detection and outline additional information about these
devices.
Reducing conductivity: One seemingly obvious way
to avoid detection is to make the head non-conductive.
We addressed the requirement for the head to be con-
ductive in Section 4.2, however applying tape or lam-
inate to the head may also reduce the conductivity to
the card without modifying the head. Such an addition
does not change the construction of the head, but both
create a gap between the head and stripe and eliminate
the conductivity of the card/head interaction. In fact, ap-
plying tape to the magnetic stripe is a common ﬁx for
read errors on worn cards [23]. However, this ﬁx works
because the read heads typically found in point-of-sale
terminals and other commercial applications are physi-
cally larger than those found in skimmers, a property that
makes them more sensitive to the weaker signal produced
by a magstripe through tape.
To verify, we tested this on the skimmer shown in Fig-
ure 13c. We recorded the raw signal produced by the
skimmer’s read head at a 96 kHz sample rate while we
swiped a card with and without tape, shown in Figure 14.
With tape, the recorded signal is diminished and unread-
able. We attempted 50 times to read the card and de-
code its data through tape, but were unsuccessful. Ac-
cordingly, taping the read heads is not a viable option for
avoiding detection.
Other commonalities: Each of the overlay and deep-

access skimmers we examined is functionally identical.
Internally, each device contains a microcontroller that re-
ceives a signal from a magnetic read head. The card data
is then stored on a ﬂash memory IC that is communi-
cated with via exposed female headers. We were unable
to identify the ICs used in each skimmer because the in-
formation on the surface of the chips (e.g., model infor-
mation) is ﬁled or etched off. The internals of one of the
skimmers pictured in Figure 13 can be seen in Figure 15
All of these devices were powered by lithium-ion bat-
teries. Some are easily rechargeable via female headers,
while others provide no charging mechanism. The main
variation in batteries is size and capacity, which we found
typically ﬁt exactly the available space after installing the
other components. Several skimmers we examined con-
tained multiple batteries connected in parallel, which is
poor practice because it can cause the batteries to be un-
stable, and thus creating a ﬁre hazard.
Ultimately, these devices differ only in their form fac-
tors.
