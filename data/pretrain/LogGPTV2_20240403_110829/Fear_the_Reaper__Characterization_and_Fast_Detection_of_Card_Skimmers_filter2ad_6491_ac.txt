### Magnetic Field Strength and Detection in Magnetic Stripe Cards

The magnetic field strength of a magnetic stripe card, when read by a read head, is typically small, around 24 µT [26]. This field strength decreases further as the distance between the card and the read head increases. The magnetic field intensity is heavily influenced by the distance, decreasing at a rate proportional to the cube of the distance (r³), where r is the distance in meters [26]. For instance, if the magnetic stripe card and the read head are separated by just 1 mm, the magnetic field intensity imposed on the read head is approximately 2.4 × 10⁻¹⁴ T, which is comparable to the magnetic field emitted by the human brain [13].

### Importance of Card-Head Proximity

Due to this significant decrease in field intensity, both commercial reader manufacturers [38] and parts sellers [3] emphasize the need for close contact between the card and the read head. This requirement is illustrated in Figure 8.

### Skim Reaper: A Device for Detecting Skimmers

#### Overview
The Skim Reaper, shown in Figure 9, is a device designed to detect skimmers in payment card readers. It consists of a microcontroller system and a measurement card. The card is inserted into a card acceptor, and the number of read heads is measured by the microcontroller. After the user indicates that the test is complete, the device notifies whether a skimmer was detected.

#### Measurement Card Design
The measurement card, depicted in Figure 10, features a pattern of traces that pass over read heads for detection. The black lines on the left indicate the trace pattern and position, aligned with the expected data track locations (shown on the right for comparison). When a read head passes over the card, the traces are bridged, completing a circuit. The traces are separated by 0.1 mm, which is significantly smaller than the smallest read head encountered.

### Operational Mechanism

The Skim Reaper relies on the properties of magnetic read heads to improve detection and increase the difficulty of developing effective countermeasures. The skimmers identified in our NYPD dataset are designed to press a metallic read head against the card during capture. Our system expects read heads in the card acceptor to contact the card and bridge a pair of electrical traces, completing a circuit back to the microcontroller.

To ensure correct alignment, the card is the height and thickness of a standard payment card. On the card, we placed a series of split copper interconnections aligned with the ISO-standard locations [29, 30] for the three card tracks. This design ensures that if a skimmer is aligned to read a particular card track, it will also pass over our traces.

### Prototype Development

During early prototyping, we faced challenges in creating PCB masks that met our 0.1 mm precision requirements. We overcame this by spray painting bare copper-clad boards and using a laser cutter to vaporize the areas not covered by the mask. We then chemically etched the board and removed the leftover spray paint with acetone. This process was time-consuming, with each card taking several hours to finish. As our design choices were finalized, we encountered issues with the chemical bath occasionally dissolving the copper underneath the spray paint, leading to a high manufacturing failure rate. We produced our final prototype device using PCBs from a professional fabrication facility based on our circuit diagrams.

### Analysis and Detection

The analysis device consists of an Adafruit Arduino-based microcontroller, which applies voltage to one half of the traces and monitors for circuit completion on the other half. To prevent false positives, the device samples the card, averages every 20 samples to counter the effects of an imperfect ground, and compares it to a threshold. If the value exceeds the threshold, the read head count is incremented. The microcontroller waits for the average voltage to drop below the threshold, indicating that the read head has fully passed over the card. This process repeats until the user indicates that the test is complete.

### Counting Read Heads

The count of read heads can vary depending on the type of reader. In swipe-style readers, each read head passes over the card once. In dip-style readers, each head passes the card twice: once on insertion and once on removal. Our device includes a switch to allow the user to identify the type of reader being examined.

### Detection and Notification

The Skim Reaper uses the read head count to alert the user to the presence of skimmers. If more than one read head is detected, the user is alerted. If one read head is detected, a notification appears that the reader appears to be normal. In other conditions (including zero heads detected), an error is displayed.

### Experimental Evaluations

#### Confirmation Testing
We tested the Skim Reaper with a Sankyo MCM2PO stripe reader and a custom 3D-printed skimmer to verify its effectiveness. The Sankyo device is an OEM replacement part for a gas pump payment terminal. Our overlay extends the card track from the original card reader, holding a standard Square Reader in the track. Testing the Skim Reaper with this skimmer involves selecting the dip mode on the device, enabling detection, inserting the card into the card track, and then removing it. We performed this task with and without the skimmer attached to verify that our system correctly identifies its presence. Figure 12 shows the voltage spikes as the card passes over the read heads.

#### NYPD Evidence Set
We partnered with the NYPD Financial Crimes Task Force to obtain skimmers from evidence storage. We obtained ten external-access skimmers, consisting of eight overlays and two deep-inserts, as shown in Figure 13. We tested the Skim Reaper against each of these skimmers five times and recorded successful detection in all attempts.

#### Ongoing Detection
The Skim Reaper successfully detects every overlay and deep-insert skimmer we have obtained, confirming our hypothesis. The NYPD Financial Crimes Task Force requested a set of Skim Reaper devices for use in the field, which we provided. These devices are now being used by detectives to proactively identify skimmers or verify their presence during investigations.

### Countermeasures and Discussion

#### Reducing Conductivity
One potential countermeasure is to make the read head non-conductive. Applying tape or laminate to the head can reduce conductivity, but this also diminishes the signal to the point of being unreadable. We tested this on a skimmer and found that taping the read heads is not a viable option for avoiding detection.

#### Commonalities in Skimmers
Each overlay and deep-access skimmer we examined is functionally identical, containing a microcontroller that receives a signal from a magnetic read head. The card data is stored on a flash memory IC, and the devices are powered by lithium-ion batteries. The main variation is in battery size and capacity, with some skimmers containing multiple batteries connected in parallel, which can create a fire hazard.

### Related Work

Electronic payment systems are vulnerable to various attacks, including transaction snooping, fraudulent accounts, counterfeit/tampered transactions, and double spending. The magnetic stripe card, the most widely deployed electronic payment system, does not offer any inherent security features, making it particularly susceptible to skimming attacks.
