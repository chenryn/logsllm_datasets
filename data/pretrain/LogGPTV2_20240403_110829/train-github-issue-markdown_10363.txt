##### Detailed description
opencv/opencv_contrib#490 as per optimisation related changes implemented for
x86 processor with the use of OpenCL and MKL Blas. Can i optimise the same dnn
module with OpenBlas library for arm platforms?.
Because in my reading of the CMakeLists.txt, I came on to this line
    OCV_OPTION(WITH_OPENCL "Include OpenCL Runtime support" (NOT ANDROID AND NOT CV_DISABLE_OPTIMIZATION)
    VISIBLE_IF NOT IOS AND NOT WINRT
    VERIFY HAVE_OPENCL)
which i think even if i turn on OPENCL flag from terminal, it will not gonna
be accepted.
