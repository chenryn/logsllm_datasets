### Detailed Description

In reference to the optimization changes implemented for x86 processors in `opencv/opencv_contrib#490` using OpenCL and MKL BLAS, I am considering whether it is possible to optimize the DNN module with the OpenBLAS library for ARM platforms.

Upon reviewing the `CMakeLists.txt` file, I encountered the following line:

```cmake
OCV_OPTION(WITH_OPENCL "Include OpenCL Runtime support" (NOT ANDROID AND NOT CV_DISABLE_OPTIMIZATION)
    VISIBLE_IF NOT IOS AND NOT WINRT
    VERIFY HAVE_OPENCL)
```

Based on this, it appears that even if I enable the `WITH_OPENCL` flag from the terminal, it will not be accepted on Android due to the condition `(NOT ANDROID)`.

### Questions
1. Is it feasible to optimize the DNN module with the OpenBLAS library for ARM platforms?
2. Are there any alternative methods or configurations to enable OpenCL support on Android, or should I consider other optimization strategies?
