User: I'm very new to Python development, and am having a problem with one of my apps in OSX.
Technologies being used in this project

python 2.6
django
google app engine
rpx (openid)

When loading up the site on my windows app, there are no issues, but when trying to same app on OSX 10.6, I get the following issue:

ImportError at /rpx/rpx/login/
No module named _ctypes
Here's where the error is happening:
/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/lib/python2.6/ctypes/init.py  in 

#

"""create and manipulate C data types in Python"""
import os as _os, sys as _sys
version = "1.1.0"
from _ctypes import Union, Structure, Array 

Any ideas? Thanks!
Assistant: The only thing that I can think of is that maybe it's not on your path. Seems unlikely, but I would check that anyways.
