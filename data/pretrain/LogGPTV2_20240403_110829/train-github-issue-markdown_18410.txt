# Summary of the new feature/enhancement
I think there are some applications that are used very frequently. So it's a
good idea to show a list of applications that are pined and the most used.
Therefore, we don't need to type in a keyword to find them again.
# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)
The list can be above the input textbox or at the sides of it.  
Items can be selected by keyboard "ALT + number", so one of my fingers does
not have to leave the ALT key after a "ALT + Space".
