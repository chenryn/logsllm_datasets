Figure 6: The power spectrum (top) and NCS (bottom) for two
example attacks
We analyze the spectral content of all 67 attacks previously clas-
siﬁed by header analysis. Based on observations from these known
classes, we conclude that single- and multi-source attacks can be
distinguished by their spectra:
• Single-source attacks include dominant high frequencies cre-
ating a linear trend in the normalized cumulative spectrum.
• Multi-source attacks have dominant low frequencies causing
the normalized cumulative spectrum to sharply rises at lower
frequencies.
Figure 6(a) shows an example of the spectrum of a single-source
attack. In this case, the attacker that generates TCP no ﬂag packets
at a rate of 1100packets/s. The source addresses are spoofed, but
the ID and TTL values clearly indicate a single-source attack (using
analysis from Section 4.1). There are noticeable peaks at higher
frequencies in the spectrum and the NCS is linear.
In contrast, Figure 6(b) shows a reﬂected attack using echo reply
packets. Since the source address in reﬂected attacks is not spoofed,
we can count 145 different reﬂectors located in countries such as
Brazil, Japan, Korea, Singapore, and United States. The attack rate
is 4300packets/s. Here we observe concentration of power in lower
frequencies creating a corresponding shift in the NCS.
The intuition behind the result requires consideration of a sin-
gle attack source and then the interaction of multiple attackers. We

Table 4: Number of attacks in each class based on header anal-
ysis at USC.
Figure 7: Comparison of F (60%) against attack rate for each
attack class
suggest that a single attacker sending at full rate will have high
frequency components in the attack trafﬁc because any computer
and network interface has a maximum possible transmission rate
due to hardware or operating system limits. This rate gives that
attacker a basic frequency and harmonics at multiples of that fre-
quency, resulting in some high-frequency components and a basi-
cally linear cumulative spectrum. Now consider a collaborative,
distributed attack with multiple attackers, each sending as fast as
possible. Each attacker will have its own maximum rate and cor-
responding spectra, but in the aggregate, their trafﬁc will “blur to-
gether”, because the attackers operate independently at different
rates and frequencies, and because each attacker experiences noise
from different levels of cross-trafﬁc, loosing high frequency com-
ponents and causing the lower frequency components to dominate
the spectrum. We expand on this intuition in several steps: through
experiments in Section 6.2, simple simulations in Section 6.3, and
discussion about robustness in Section 7.
Since it is difﬁcult to quantify differences between attacks with
a graphical representation of spectrum, we use the F (60%) value
(from Equation 6) for each attack to isolate the concept of power
being concentrated in lower frequencies. Figure 7 plots F (60%)
against the attack rates in packets/s (log-scale). Single-source at-
tacks are concentrated in the center frequency band because their
linear normalized cumulative spectrum results in mid-range F (60%)
values. Multi-source attacks, both direct and reﬂected, are con-
centrated in the lower frequency band, due to the accumulation of
power in lower frequencies. The two classes of attacks also have a
signiﬁcant difference in ﬁrst-order statistics: single-source attacks
have a mean 268Hz and a 95% conﬁdence interval between 240–
295Hz, while multi-source attacks have a mean of 172Hz, and a
95% conﬁdence interval between 142–210Hz. We performed the
Wilcoxon rank sum test [5] to verify that the two classes have dif-
ferent F (60%) ranges. The test strongly rejects the null hypoth-
esis, that single- and multi-source attacks have identical dominant
frequencies, with a p-value of 7.5 × 10−5.
We use the spectral analysis described above to classify the re-
maining 13 unclassiﬁed attacks. The spectrum of ﬁve attacks match
spectral characteristics of single-source attacks, with a F (60%) lo-
cated above 240Hz. The remaining eight attacks have spectral char-
acteristics similar to multi-source attacks with localization of power
in the lower frequencies. These attacks also exhibit an initial ramp-
up lasting from 300ms to 14 seconds corroborating the presence of
multiple attackers.

6. VALIDATION
We use three techniques to validate our classiﬁcation algorithms
and understand the nature of our observations. First, we analyze
DoS attacks from a second site to conﬁrm that the numbers and
types of attacks we identiﬁed were not unique to our original ob-
servation point. Then we conduct controlled experiments and use
simple numerical simulations to understand the physical character-
istics behind our classiﬁcation techniques.
6.1 Observations from an Alternate Site
We deployed a second trace machine at USC’s connection to In-
ternet2. The typical daytime load is 112Mbits/s with a mean of
25Kpackets/s. The trafﬁc mix on the Internet2 link is fairly dif-
ferent than what we observed at Los Nettos; see Tables 3 for a
breakdown of trafﬁc at each site by protocol. Los Nettos shows
much more DNS trafﬁc (due to the presence of the b-root name-
server) and web trafﬁc, while USC shows more “other” trafﬁc due
to gaming, ﬁle sharing and research that uses atypical or ephemeral
ports.
We observed 18 attacks at USC during the months of October
and November 2003. Due to the differences in monitoring duration
and trafﬁc quantity, it is difﬁcult to compare the absolute number of
attacks with our observations at Los Nettos. However, we observed
about the same ratio of attacks in each attack class.
Table 4 lists attacks by class as determined by header content.
Three attacks were unclassiﬁed since they completely randomize
the ID value. Table 5 shows a detailed manual analysis of packet
headers. Although it is difﬁcult to directly compare with Table 2,
we observe a similar set of attacks. Attacks of type TCP SYN-
ACK, TCP-unusual and ICMP-illegal were not seen at USC; how-
ever, these were not very frequent at Los Nettos either.
Ramp-up and spectral analysis of attacks at USC were similar to
attacks observed at our original site, and hence we do not reproduce
spectra of individual attacks here. Figure 8 plots F (60%) against
the attack rate (in log-scale) for each attack class. The USC results
also indicate the F (60%) is located in the middle frequency band
for single-source attacks, and in the low frequency band for multi-
source attacks. The two classes of attacks also have ﬁrst-order
statistics similar to the Los Nettos. The mean for single-source at-
tacks is 292Hz and a 95% conﬁdence interval between 200–380Hz,
while multi-source attacks have a mean of 120Hz and a 95% con-
ﬁdence interval between 35Hz–200Hz. One unclassiﬁed attack is
most likely a single-source attack since it does not show a ramp-up
and its F (60%) is 260Hz. The other two unclassiﬁed attacks are
similar to each other in many aspects. They exhibit a small ramp-

attackers.
The tendency of multi-source attacks to localize power in lower
frequencies is distinctly visible in the summary of F (60%) fre-
quencies for both sites, Los Nettos in Figure 7 and USC in Figure 8.
Based on these observations, we conclude that our results are not
distorted by unusual trafﬁc characteristics at Los Nettos and our
techniques could be applied to other trafﬁc mixes.
6.2 Experimental Conﬁrmation
To understand the effect of network topology and number of
sources on attack trafﬁc we carried out controlled experiments over
the Internet varying both these parameters. We placed synthetic at-
tackers at universities and research labs on both coasts of the United
States (at ISI East, UCLA, UCSB, UCSD, UMass, and USC). We
measured trafﬁc at a target while varying the number of sources
from 1–5 considering two topologies: a clustered attack, where
all attackers reside on the same LAN segment and are well con-
nected to the target via a high bandwidth, low latency link, and
a distributed topology where attackers are widely distributed with
attackers on both coasts. Although it is not possible to control In-
ternet trafﬁc, we repeated these experiments multiple times during
heavy and light network utilization, during peak weekday hours
and early morning/weekends (as measured local to the target). The
victim and the observation point were located on the same Ether-
net segment, connected via a hub. The trafﬁc traces were captured
using tcpdump [16]. Each synthetic DoS attacker was an Iperf [36]
UDP source sending 50 byte packets at a rate of 1Mbits/s and each
experiment was run for 100 seconds. The hosts in the experiments
have different operating speeds and all run variants of Linux.

Figure 9(a) shows the clustered topology with only one sender.
We see strong peaks in the high frequency ranges. This behavior
is an inherent characteristic of a host sending at a rapid pace. All
computers run at certain frequencies due to clocks in the CPU, the
network card, and the operating system. We therefore believe that
this pattern will be present in any host that is sending as rapidly as
possible.
Looking across Figure 9 we see how the spectrum changes as
the number of sources increase from 1 to 3 with all sources on the
same Ethernet segment. The dominant spectral characteristics tend
to shift toward low frequencies as the number of sources increase,
with F (60%) at 300Hz, 150Hz, and 21Hz for 1, 2 and 3 sources
respectively. In Section 6.3 we examine this effect more closely to
show that it is due to multiple attackers operating out of phase with
each other.
To examine the effect of network topology we repeated this ex-
