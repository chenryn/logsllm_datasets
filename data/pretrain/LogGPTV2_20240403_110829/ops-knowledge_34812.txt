User: I am using OS X 1.6 snow leopard and I successfully got PIL installed. I am able to open terminal and type import Image without any errors.
However, When using app engine I get Image error still saying that PIL is not installed. I am wondering if any of you have an thoughts as to how I can resolve this issue.

Assistant: I had this same problem and found in GoogleAppEngineLauncher | Preferences that I needed to set the Python Path to /usr/local/bin/python2.5
After I did that it started working.
