Subject: Issue with PIL Installation on Google App Engine

Dear Support,

I am currently using OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard and have successfully installed the Python Imaging Library (PIL). I can confirm the installation by opening the Terminal and running `import Image` without encountering any errors.

However, when I attempt to use Google App Engine, I receive an error message indicating that PIL is not installed. Could you please provide some guidance or suggestions on how to resolve this issue?

Best regards,
Matthew

Hi Matthew,

I encountered a similar problem in the past and found a solution. In the Google App Engine Launcher, go to Preferences and set the Python Path to `/usr/local/bin/python2.5`. After making this change, the issue should be resolved, and PIL should work correctly within your Google App Engine environment.

I hope this helps!

Best,
