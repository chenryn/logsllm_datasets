Use memory analysis tools: Using memory analysis tools can help you determine the cause of memory leaks, the source of memory leaks, the size of memory leaks, and so on. Commonly used tools are Heaptrack, Massif, LeakTracer, etc. 3. Use code review tools: Code review tools can help you find the source of all memory leaks. Commonly used tools are Cppcheck, Clang Static Analyzer, Coverity, etc. 4. Use log output or Debug: If you cannot use the above tools or methods, you can add some log output or Debug to the program to help you debug and troubleshoot. 5. Check the memory usage: You can use the top, ps and other commands that come with the system to check the memory usage of the process to help you debug and troubleshoot.
