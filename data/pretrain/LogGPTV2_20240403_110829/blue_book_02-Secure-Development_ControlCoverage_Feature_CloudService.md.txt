## IMPORTANT: DevOps Kit (AzSK) is being sunset by the end of FY21. For more details, please refer to [this document](../../../ReleaseNotes/AzSKSunsetNotice.md).

### Cloud Service Security Controls and Rationale

| Control Description | Rationale | Severity | Automated Fix Script Available? | 
|---------------------|-----------|----------|---------------------------------|
| **Cloud Service must authenticate users using Azure Active Directory (AAD) backed credentials** | Utilizing the native enterprise directory for authentication ensures a high level of assurance in the user's identity, which is crucial for subsequent access control. All Enterprise subscriptions are automatically linked with their enterprise directory (e.g., `xxx.onmicrosoft.com`), and users within this directory are trusted for authentication to these subscriptions. | High | No |
| **Cloud Service must only be accessible over HTTPS. Enable HTTPS for InputEndpoints.** | Enforcing HTTPS ensures server/service authentication and protects data in transit from network-layer attacks such as man-in-the-middle, eavesdropping, and session hijacking. | High | Yes |
| **Remove unused internal endpoints** | Internal endpoints are used for instance-to-instance communication within a cloud service. If one internal instance is compromised, it can put all other instances at risk due to open communication channels. | Medium | Yes |
| **Remove unused input endpoints** | Input endpoints expose ports to the outside world, making the cloud service vulnerable to internet-based attacks, such as brute-force attempts to gain access. | Medium | Yes |
| **Remote debugging must be turned off** | Remote debugging requires opening inbound ports, which can become easy targets for various internet-based attacks. | High | Yes |
| **A CNAME should be configured for the cloud service** | Using a custom domain name helps protect the web application from common attacks like phishing, session hijacking, and DNS-related attacks. | Medium | No |
| **OS version should be set to automatic updates** | Disabling automatic OS updates can lead to missed security patches, increasing the risk of compromise from malware and trojans that exploit known vulnerabilities. | High | Yes |
| **Enable the Antimalware extension for the cloud service roles** | The antimalware extension provides real-time protection, scheduled scanning, malware remediation, signature updates, and other security features. | High | Yes |
| **Remote Desktop (RDP) access must be disabled on cloud service roles** | Remote desktop access requires opening inbound ports, which can become easy targets for various internet-based attacks. | High | Yes |

This table outlines the necessary security controls for cloud services, along with their rationale, severity, and whether an automated fix script is available.
