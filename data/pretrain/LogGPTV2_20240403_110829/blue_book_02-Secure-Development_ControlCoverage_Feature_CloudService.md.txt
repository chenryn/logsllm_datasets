CloudServiceDescription & RationaleControlSeverityAutomatedFix ScriptCloud Service must authenticate users using Azure Active Directory backed credentialsUsing the native enterprise directory for authentication ensures that there is a built-in high level of assurance in the user identity established for subsequent access control.All Enterprise subscriptions are automatically associated with their enterprise directory (xxx.onmicrosoft.com) and users in the native directory are trusted for authentication to enterprise subscriptions.HighNoNoCloud Service must only be accessible over HTTPS. Enable https for InputEndpoints.Use of HTTPS ensures server/service authentication and protects data in transit from network layer man-in-the-middle, eavesdropping, session-hijacking attacks.HighYesNoRemove unused internal endpointsInternal endpoints are available for instance-to-instance communication with in cloud service. Exploitation of one such internal instance can put all the other internal instances at risk with which it has open communication channels.MediumYesNoRemove unused input endpointsThe input endpoint is used when you want to expose a port to the outside from a cloud service. Such unintended open connections expose cloud service instances to a high level of risk from internet-based attacks that attempt to brute force credentials to gain access to the machine.MediumYesNoRemote debugging must be turned offRemote debugging requires inbound ports to be opened. These ports become easy targets for compromise from various internet based attacks.HighYesNoA CNAME should be configured for the cloud service.Use of custom domain protects a web application from common attacks such as phishing, session hijacking and other DNS-related attacks.MediumNoNoOS version should be set to automatic.Cloud services where automatic updates are disabled are likely to miss important security patches (human error, forgetfulness). This may lead to compromise from various malware/trojan attacks that exploit known vulnerabilities in operating systems and related software.HighYesNoEnable the Antimalware extension for the cloud service rolesAntimalware provides real-time protection, scheduled scanning, malware remediation, signature updates, engine updates, samples reporting, exclusion event collection etc.HighYesNoRemote Desktop (RDP) access must be disabled on cloud service rolesRemote desktop access requires inbound ports to be opened. These ports become easy targets for compromise from various internet based attacks.HighYesNo
