With a van, they could use the "bigfoot" 
concept for raising antennas.  They could 
use a disk antenna for low frequencies and 
a gain antenna for the 800 MHz spectrum. 
They are setting-up the TRP-1000 for use 
as an emergency dispatch center and as a 
mobile repeater.  They have identified a 
number of frequencies to be used in the 
new system.  In an emergency, they would 
be able to use the unit to dispatch to the 
entire city.  Currently, portable radios have a 
problem transmitting back to a single an-
tenna location. 
Note: 
The following section was taken from 
the AGILE: City of Orlando Fire De-
partment Mock Disaster Drill After-
Action Report. 
On January 13, 2001, the City of Orlando 
Fire Department (OFD) was involved in a 
mock disaster drill at Universal Studios in 
Orlando, Florida.  The exercise included the 
City of Orlando Community Emergency Re-
sponse Team (CERT) Association, City of 
Orlando Fire Department, and National Dis-
aster Medical Systems (NDMS) Disaster 
Medical Assistance Team (DMAT FL-6).  
During this exercise, the fire department 
had the opportunity to utilize a TRP-1000 
provided by the Department of Justice 
(DOJ) Office of Justice Programs (OJP), 
OSLDPS as part of a demonstration and 
assessment initiative.  For this exercise, the 
TRP-1000 was used to link radio communi-
cations between the Orlando Fire Depart-
ment and DMAT FL-6.  The exercise simu-
lated a tornado hit in an urban area and the 
response of community volunteers (CERT) 
coming to the aid of the 150 disaster vic-
tims. One hundred fifty children from an 
area high school were dressed in camou-
flage and acted as victims of the storm 
event.  The victims were dispersed through-
out a section of Universal Studios Florida.  
Victims were assessed and provided basic 
first aid by the 20 CERT teams participating 
in the event (8 people per team) and trans-
ported via stretchers to the DMAT.  DMAT 
(a surgical field hospital) triaged and simu-
lated treatment of 75 of these victims.  The 
event lasted for five hours.  
The TRP-1000s were initially configured 
with Bendix King VHF and UHF radios.  The 
City of Orlando Police Department pur-
chased five Motorola 800 MHz MCS2000s 
for installation into the four TRP-1000s.  
Through a multi-agency agreement, the 800 
MHz radios were programmed with systems 
and talk-groups from neighboring jurisdic-
tions as well as conventional NPSPAC in-
teroperability channels.  The Bendix King 
radios were programmed with frequencies 
utilized within the State of Florida for inter-
operability and disasters as well as Federal 
FEMA and NIC frequencies, which were 
also decided upon through multi-agency 
agreement.  
Orlando Fire Department transported the 
TRP-1000 to Universal Studios and set up 
operations in close proximity to DMAT FL-6.  
The TRP-1000 was set up and connected to 
AC power from two outlets on the property.  
OFD set up the antennas several wave-
lengths apart utilizing some ice machines 
ACU/TRP-1000 Handbook 
Page 5-5 
and the vehicle as a ground plane.  The set 
up time for the TRP-1000 was approxi-
mately 15 minutes. 
After the initial setup of the TRP-1000, a 
test was conducted of the 800 MHz, VHF, 
and UHF radios with an OFD portable radio.  
Initial attempts to generate a net between 
the 800 MHz, VHF, and UHF radios, and 
any combination thereof, were unsuccess-
ful.  OFD personnel determined that the 
speaker button on the VHF and UHF radios 
was set up for PA function rather than 
speaker.  After the radios were repro-
grammed, the TRP-1000 successfully gen-
erated nets between the 800 MHz, VHF, 
and UHF radios without incident.  After gen-
erating a test net, audio settings were ad-
justed to optimize performance; once ini-
tially set, the settings did not require any 
further adjustment during the exercise.  
During the exercise, one of DMAT FL-6's 25 
KHz UHF simplex channels was linked to a 
OFD 800 MHz talk-group. Once the soft-
ware correction (described above) was ac-
complished, the TRP-1000 worked flaw-
lessly.  There were brief moments of cross 
talk and intermod.  This was not due to any 
deficiency in the TRP-1000 but a symptom 
of being set up in a RF rich environment, 
coupled with the DMAT FL- 6 radios utilizing 
carrier squelch rather than selective signal-
ing.  At the conclusion of the five-hour exer-
cise, the TRP-1000 was dismantled and 
stored for transportation in 15 minutes.  As-
sistant Chief Robert Sorenson noted, "The 
TRP-1000 has tremendous potential for the 
City of Orlando and surrounding jurisdic-
tions.  The ability to network communica-
tions of several agencies utilizing different 
communications mediums in a field portable 
piece of equipment makes operational in-
teroperability a reality.  In this exercise, the 
TRP-1000 system has proven to be a reli-
able and useful piece of equipment." 
5.3 Arapahoe County, Colorado 
Project 
Arapahoe County, Colorado is one of the 
largest counties in Colorado with a popula-
tion of more than 500,000.  It adjoins the 
City of Denver to the south, covering an 
area of 850 square miles.  Littleton is the 
county seat.  The western part of the 
County is mostly urban with residential, re-
tail, office, and industrial areas, while the 
eastern portion is relatively rural.  
5.3.1 Arapahoe County, Colorado 
TRP-1000 Deployment 
Arapahoe County has two TRP-1000 units.  
One is currently mounted in a converted 
prisoner transport van as shown in Figure 
5-2.  The county is purchasing a second van 
for the other unit that will have four wheel-
drive capability and air conditioning.  The 
unit is manned by telecommunications 
technicians and the van is available to go 
anywhere in the State of Colorado.  There 
are two other technicians from neighboring 
counties that can be called upon to man the 
unit. 
The unit is equipped with 60 older VHF 
portable radios pre-configured for the inter-
connect system.  These can be distributed 
at an emergency site to assure each team 
has a radio that can communicate with the 
command post.  The TRP-1000 can be eas-
ily removed from the van for re-deployment 
to a higher elevation such as the top of a 
building. 
There are also two additional units set up in 
separate vans.  The TRP-1000 units are

into a modified Arapahoe County Sheriffs 
prisoner transport van. 
ACU/TRP-1000 Handbook 
Page 5-6 
attached via tie-down straps.  There are 12 
antennas on each van and two generators 
in a trailer that is towed by the vans. 
Arapahoe County contacted the FCC and 
the state telecommunications offices to get 
a current list of frequencies being used by 
emergency response agencies.  They used 
these to make a list of contacts and phone 
numbers for all responder agencies in Colo-
rado.  That information is carried on the unit 
as a reference.  
The communications technicians have also 
equipped the van with schematic diagrams 
and common cable connectors to be able to 
interconnect other radios to the system 
while at the scene.  
Power to the unit is supplied by two genera-
tors (one as backup) carried on a small flat 
bed trailer towed behind the van, or by ex-
tension cord hookup to any satisfactory out-
let.  The power supply is "filtered" through 
two uninterruptible power supply (UPS) 
units to prevent voltage spikes, and to guard 
against generator failure or inadvertent dis-
connection of the extension cord.  
Problems encountered with their set-up oc-
curred on a hot day during the TOPOFF 
2000 Exercise.  Communications techni-
cians had to fine-tune the radios connected 
to the TRP-1000 because they started to 
drift off-frequency.  They now plan accord-
ingly for the heat and bring fans or crack 
windows as necessary. 
Arapahoe County also notes that extreme 
cold temperatures can also cause radio fre-
quency drift.  To solve this problem, they 
are staffing the unit with radio technicians 
who can monitor and correct most radio 
problems.  In the future, vehicles will be 
equipped with air-conditioning and heat to 
minimize this problem. 
Plans include the addition of an Aluma 75-
foot winch-up tower.  The tower would be 
towed on a trailer.  
Arapahoe County has informed other juris-
dictions of their willingness to respond 
within the state in support of any major inci-
dents.  Arapahoe County has demonstrated 
the system on several occasions and has 
provided informational packets for other ju-
risdictions interested in the system.
