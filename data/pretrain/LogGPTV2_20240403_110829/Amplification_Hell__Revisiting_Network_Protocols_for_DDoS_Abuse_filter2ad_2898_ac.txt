### Table III: Bandwidth Amplification Factors per Protocol

The table below shows the average Bandwidth Amplification Factor (BAF) for all amplifiers, as well as the BAFs when using the worst 50% or 10% of the amplifiers. For each protocol, we identify the request-response scenario with the highest bandwidth amplification factor. We then send the corresponding request to all identified amplifiers and measure the average response size. The BAF is primarily determined by the protocol but can also vary based on the specific amplifier instance and its implementation. An attacker can optimize their attack by focusing on the subset of amplifiers with the highest BAFs.
