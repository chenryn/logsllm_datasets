User: How to accurately detect the version information of the Linux kernel?
Assistant: To accurately detect the version information of the Linux kernel, you can execute the following command: ``` uname -a ``` This command will output complete kernel and system information, including kernel version number, architecture type, operating system type, host name, etc. . Alternatively, you can execute the following command to output only the kernel version number: ``` uname -r ``` This command will output the currently running kernel version number.
