I have a Symfony 2.6 project that uses the Symfony3 directory structure. When
I clear/warmup for the first time the compiled DI container contains the wrong
cache directory. E.g:
    'kernel.cache_dir' => (dirname(dirname(dirname(__DIR__))).'/app/../var/cache/de_'),
While I have set my environment as "dev", not as "de_". This causes all sorts
of problems and causes the application to fail due to missing directories.
