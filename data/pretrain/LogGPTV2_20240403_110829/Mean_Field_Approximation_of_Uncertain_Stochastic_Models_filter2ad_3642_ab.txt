Note that the the Birkhoff centre BF is included in the set
AF . The inclusion is in general strict.
The following result is a direct consequence of Theorem 1.
Theorem 2. Let (XN )N be an imprecise population process,
then there exists a sequence εN that converges to 0 in
probability and such that the distance between X N (t) and
AF becomes stochastic lower than εN as t goes to inﬁnity. In
other word:
N→∞ lim

t→∞ d(X N (t), AF ) = 0
in probability.
When in addition of being an imprecise Markov chain,
for all N, the process XN is a Markov chain and has a
stationary measure μN , we can say more. The following results
characterise the stationary behaviour of the stationary measures
as N grows. It shows that the sequence of stationary measures
μN concentrates on the Birkhoff centre of the differential
inclusion. The Birkhoff centre, deﬁned in Section II-B, is es-
sentially the set of recurrent points of the differential inclusion,
i.e., the set of points such that there exists a trajectory that
starts at this point and comes back to this point in the future.
Theorem 3. Let X be an imprecise population process such
that XN is a Markov chain that has a stationary measure μN .
Let μ be a limit point of μN (for the weak convergence). Then,
the support of μ is included in the Birkhoff centre of F , deﬁned
in Equation (1): μ(BF ) = 1.
Sketch of proof: As for the proof of Theorem 1, one can
show that there exists a function I(N ) such that XN (kI(N ))
is a GASP. Theorem 3 is therefore a consequence of [18,
Corollary 9].

Corollary 2. Let X be an uncertain population process such
that XN is a Markov chain that has a stationary measure
μN . Let μ be a limit point of μN (for the weak convergence).
Then, the support of μ is included in the Birkhoff centre of
Fϑ, deﬁned in Equation (1).
Remark: Theorem 3 only states that the support of μ
is included in the Birkhoff centre but provides no intuition on
the how the probability mass is spread on this set. This results
can be reﬁned by using the notion of semi-invariant measure
[18, Deﬁnition 3.3]. However,
this notion is complex and
computing a semi-invariant measure of a differential inclusion
seems numerically intractable, as it requires to compute a
probability measure on all
the possible trajectories of the
differential inclusion. Hence, it the present document, we limit
our exposition to the notion of Birkhoff centre, which, even if
less accurate, provides a simpler characterisation that can be
computed numerically.
IV. NUMERICAL METHODS
The results of the previous section imply that, for large
populations, we can study the mean ﬁeld differential inclusion
to get insights on the transient and on the steady state of the
stochastic population process. The analysis of this class of
mean ﬁeld models, however, is in general more challenging
than ordinary differential equations (ODE). In the differential
inclusion case, in fact, we usually are only able to compute
bounds on the solution set of the equations. After discussing
some existing approaches, we present in more detail two fast
methods, one based on differential hulls and the other based
on the control-theoretic Pontraygin principle.
A. Related work on numerical methods
Most recent numerical approaches dealing with imprecise
deterministic processes have been developed for computing
reachable sets of hybrid systems, whose continuous dynam-
ics can be speciﬁed by (non-linear) differential equations or
differential inclusions. The proposed methods in literature can
be roughly divided in two classes: exact over-approximation
methods and simulation-based methods [24].
The ﬁrst class of methods manipulates directly sets of
states, ﬁnitely represented, for instance, as polytopes [25],
ellipsoids [26], or zonotopes [27], or by relying on interval
arithmetic [28] combined with constraint solving [29], [30],
exploiting satisfaction modulo solvers over reals [31], [32].
The dynamics of the system is lifted at the set level, so that
one computes the evolution of the reachable set under the
action of the dynamics. These methods usually compute over-
approximation of the real reachable set, which is formally
guaranteed to contain all reachable points. Most of the methods
in literature are restricted to linear systems, due to their wide
diffusion in engineering applications. For this class of systems,
efﬁcient methods exist [27], [33]. Tools like SpaceEx [34]
implement routines for linear differential inclusions capable
of solving problems up to several hundred dimensions. Over-
approximation methods for non-linear systems, instead, are
much less developed, due to the intrinsic difﬁculty of the
problem. Here we recall hybridization [35], which is based
on a localised linearisation of the dynamics. Another family
of methods, very common for differential inclusions, is based

on interval-based methods combined with constrain solving to
control the over-approximation introduced by interval compu-
tations. Among them, we recall [29] and [30]. Other methods
for integrating differential inclusions rely on error bounding
[36].
An alternative approach is offered by simulation methods,
which try to infer the reachable set from few simulated
trajectories of the system. These methods are very effective
for the limit dynamics emerging from uncertain population
processes. Here we recall [37], which uses the sensitivity of
the system with respect to initial conditions to (approximately)
compute how a set of initial conditions propagates in T units
of time under the action of the dynamics. The approach
of [38], instead, use statistical methods borrowed from ma-
chine learning to perform inference of the reachable set with
statistical error guarantees. Other methods work for more
general imprecise limit models; for example, the procedure of
[39]–[41] constructs an under-approximation of the reachable
set using a Monte-Carlo sampling method.
B. Differential hull of a differential inclusion
A ﬁrst method to compute the set of reachable points
by the solutions of a differential inclusion is to construct a
rectangular over-approximation, which is composed of two
functions x and x such that x(t) ≤ x(t) ≤ x(t), for any x
that is solution of the differential inclusion x. In this section,
we show that we can construct two differential equations such
that x and x are their solutions and such that for all t and
any solution x of the differential inclusion ˙x ∈ F (x), we have
x(t) ≤ x(t) ≤ x(t) (coordinate-wise). The construction of
these equations is simple. This bounds are reasonably tight
when the set of possible parameters θ is small. However,
as we will see in Section V-D,
the bounds provided by
this approximation become loose when the set of possible ϑ
increase.
Following the deﬁnition of [13], we say that a locally
Lipschitz-continuous function (f , f ) is a differential hull for
the differential inclusion F if for each coordinate i and each
x such that x ≤ x ≤ x, we have:
xi = xi ⇒f
(x, x) ≤ inf
f∈F (x)
xi = xi ⇒f i(x, x) ≥ sup
f∈F (x)
i
fi
fi.
The tightest functions f and f that are a differential hull
for a differential inclusion F are:
min
(x, x) =
f
i
x∈[x,x]:xi=xi(t)
min Fi(x)
f i(x, x) =
max
x∈[x,x]:xi=xi(t)
max Fi(x)
C. Reachability as an optimal control problem: an algorithm
based on Pontryagin’s maximum principle
In general, the bounds x and x found by the differential
hull method are not tight. We can do better by exploiting
Pontryagin’s maximum principle, a classical method that can
be used to compute numerically the exact minimal value
xmin(t) and maximal value xmax(t) that can be reached by
an imprecise ﬂuid model at time t [7].
Let T ≥ 0 be some ﬁxed time and i ∈ {1 . . . d} a
coordinate. Let xmax
xi(T ) be the maximal
value that the ith coordinate of the solution of a differential
inclusion can take at time t. The quantity xmax
(T ) is the
solution of the maximization problem over functions ϑ(t):
xmax
(T ) = supx∈SF,x0
(T ) := max
xi(T ) such that
i

θ(t) ∈ [ϑmin, ϑmax]

for all t ∈ [0; T ]:
(cid:12) t
Pontryagin’s maximum principle is a set of necessary
conditions that the trajectory that attains the maximum should
satisfy. Following the description of [7, Section 3] these
conditions are the following. If x is a trajectory that maximises
xi(T ),
then there exists a costate trajectory p such that
pi(T ) = −1, pj(T ) = 0 for j (cid:5)= i and:
˙x(t) = f (x(t), u(t))
ϑ(t) ∈ arg max
(cid:13)
− ˙p(t) =
f (x, ϑ)T p,
f (x, ϑ)T p
(7)
(8)
(cid:14)
ϑ
(9)
∂
∂x
where f (x, ϑ)T p denotes the scalar product between f (x, ϑ)
and p.
This formulation can be used to derive a ﬁxpoint algorithm
to iteratively obtain x and ϑ. We start from an (arbitrary) initial
costate p, satisfying the constraints at time T , then alternatively
compute a trajectory x forward in time the x by using (7) and
(8), holding p ﬁxed, and computing a new p backward in time
by solving (9), holding x ﬁxed. These two steps are repeted
until a convergence criterion is met (typically, the sup norm
of p and x varies less than a prescribed ε after an iteration).
Remark: The rectangle delimited by xmin(T ) and
xmax(T ) provides an approximation of the reachable set of
x(T ). This set is tighter than the rectangle delimited by x and
x, but is not exact: in general, the set of reachable points is
not a rectangle. However, the algorithm given by the iterations
(7-9) can be easily extended to reﬁne the rectangle into any
convex template polyhedron by considering the minimisation
problems mini
i αixi(t) for any tuple of coefﬁcients αi.
(cid:2)
This leads to the following result, that is a consequence of
[42, Theorem 1].
Theorem 4. Let x : [0 : T ] → R
d be a solution of ˙x ∈ F (x)
with initial condition x(0) = x0. Let (x, x) be the solution of
the differential equation ˙x = f (x, x) and ˙x = f (x, x) with
initial condition x(0) = x(0) = x0. Then, for all t, we have:
x(t) ≤ x(t) ≤ x(t)

ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE 1: THE SIR MODEL
In this section, we apply our techniques to the well-known
susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model. This example will
serve us to illustrate the differences between the imprecise
and uncertain model and to evaluate our numerical algorithms.
We show in particular that the imprecise model can be solved
numerically and that it provides bounds that are much tighter
than the differential hull approximation.

A. The SIR model
We consider a system composed of N nodes. Each node
is in one of the three states: susceptible, infected or recovered.
We denote by XS(t) ∈ [0, 1] the proportion of nodes that are
susceptible at time t (and by XI (t) and XR(t) the proportion
of infected and recovered nodes). By deﬁnition, for each t,
XS(t) + XI (t) + XR(t) = 1.
We model the dynamics of the stochastic system as follows.
A susceptible node can become infected from an external
source (this occurs at rate a). An infected node becomes
recovered at rate b and a recovered node becomes susceptible
at rate c. We consider that susceptible and infected node are
moving but we do not know at which speed. We model this
by considering that a susceptible node encounters an infected
node and becomes infected at rate ϑXI (t).
