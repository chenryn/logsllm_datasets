signiﬁcant increase in RTT, before discussing how frequently
this issue occurs across all measurements in our global
dataset.
5.1 Case studies
As we mentioned in the previous section, we found a high
degree of path asymmetry in Cuban international traﬃc.
Unfortunately, since there is only one available probe in
Cuba, we are only able to verify the outgoing path from
a single preﬁx. However, based on RTT measurements,
this asymmetry appears to apply to the preﬁxes that route
incoming traﬃc via the satellite networks.
We compute the AS path for each traceroute in our
dataset using the methodology presented in Chen et. al. [5].
We then match traceroutes with opposite source and desti-
nation IP address to get the forward and reverse path and
calculate the asymmetry of the path [10, 14].
Figure 3 shows one example of path asymmetry to/from
Cuba. In this case, traceroutes were run simultaneously by
Atlas nodes in Havana, Cuba and Miami, Florida (in NTT’s
network), with each node targeting the other.
We start with the traceroute launched by the Atlas node in
Cuba, shown on the top half of Figure 3. RTT measurements
to the edge of the Cuban IXP were very low, typically taking
less than 3 ms. The ﬁrst jump in latency occurs as the
traceroute leaves AS12956 and enters Telefonica’s transit
network. Though we were unable to verify the exact location
of this hop, we believe that it likely located in Venezuela;
the only other landing of the ALBA-1 submarine is located
in Jamaica and is reportedly intended to be a backup. The
next hop is still in Telefonica’s network, but there is another

4. CONNECTIVITY
In this section, we brieﬂy describe the structure of
Cuba’s networks and its connectivity to the global Internet.
According to Preﬁx WhoIs, there are a total of three Au-
tonomous Systems (ASes) in Cuba, two of which (AS11960
and AS27725) are operated by ETECSA, a government-
owned telecommunications service provider. The third AS
(AS10569) is operated by Centro de Intercambio Automati-
zado de Informacion (CENIAI). All international traﬃc to
and from the island ﬂows through AS11960. Table 1 lists
the number of IPv4 and IPv6 preﬁxes in each of the Cuban
ASes.
Using the traceroute measurements launched from Name-
help clients targeting each preﬁx in Cuba [4, 5], we created
the AS map in Figure 2, which describes how these three
networks are connected to each other and to the rest
of the Internet (via the four ASes listed on the right
side of the diagram). Before reaching Cuba, all of our
traceroute measurements traversed one of four networks:
Tata’s, Telefonica’s, NewCom’s, or the Intelsat’s network.
Traﬃc that travels through Tata’s (AS6453) or Telefonica’s
(AS12956) networks appears to travel to Cuba via the
ALBA-1 submarine cable as it leaves those networks. Paths
that reach Cuba via Intelsat’s (AS222351) or Newcom’s
(AS27725) networks are reaching the island via satellite.
In AS11960, we found that one of the IPv4 preﬁxes
(200.13.144.0/21) hosts a small number of domains, includ-
ing cubacel.cu, a website for ETECSA. The remaining IPv4
and IPv6 preﬁxes are part of the Cuban Internet Exchange
Point (IXP). All of our measurements into and out of Cuba
ﬂow through this IXP.
In AS27725, a number of preﬁxes are assigned to gov-
ernmental and educational organizations. After analyzing

while the dotted arrow and latency measurements on the bottom are from the reverse path (US to Cuba).

signiﬁcant jump in RTT. Based on traceroute measurements
to this router’s IP address from Atlas probes in the US, this
hop appears to be near Washington DC; the Atlas probe
with the shortest latency to this probe (less than 1 ms) was
located in the DC metropolitan area.
Once the traceroute from Cuba to Miami had a high
enough TTL to reach a router in NTT’s network, RTT
suddenly increases by over 200 ms. Based on the router’s
hostname, the router is located near Ashburn, Virginia, and
is likely within 60 km of the previous hop. In fact, once the
TTL was high enough to leave Telefonica’s network, RTT
was never below 345 ms.
The reason for this sudden jump in latency becomes clear
when examining the reverse path. The dashed arrows and
RTTs on the bottom of Figure 3 summarize the output of
the traceroute initiated by the probe in NTT’s network.
Instead of routing through Telefonica’s network, probes from
the Atlas node in Miami are being routed to Cuba via
AT&T’s transit network to NewCom’s network, traversing
the satellite link to the island.
Interestingly, the RTT
actually reaches its highest point once the path arrives at
the NewCom’s base station in Cuba. At this point, packets
must travel over the satellite link in both directions (which
must take at least 477 ms). Once the TTL is high enough to
reach the Cuban network, RTT drops by over 200 ms, as the
traceroute responses are now returning via the submarine
cable.
Although this example only covers a single forward and
reverse path between Atlas probes in Cuba and Florida, the
sudden jumps in latency and path asymmetry were both
common when measuring between Cuba and the US. In
our analysis of paths between the Atlas node in Cuba and
Namehelp users in the US, we found that all paths going
out of Cuba traversed the submarine cable and 92% of paths
going into Cuba traversed a satellite link.
This issue also appeared frequently on paths to popular
websites. Figure 4 summarizes the path of a traceroute from
the Atlas probe in Cuba to google.com. Despite the fact that
we were unable to run traceroutes along the reverse path
(from Google’s network to Cuba), the forward path is very

similar to the example in Figure 3; after leaving Telefonica’s
network, latency suddenly jumps by 220 ms.
Based on the hostname of the Google server targeted by
the Atlas node in Cuba, the server appeared to be located
near Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas. Ping measurements from
Atlas probes in the DC area (near the last hop in Telefonica’s
network) to the same Google server took less than 35 ms.
However, between Telefonica’s network and the destination,
RTT increases by 220 ms. Given the similarity to the
previous example, we believe that this sudden increase is
also a result of the reverse path being routed to Cuba via a
high latency satellite link. We observed this same trend for
all of the other top sites included in our tests (i.e., Yahoo,
Wikipedia, Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit).
5.2 Wider impact
We now summarize the paths between our population of
Namehelp users and the Atlas probe in Cuba. Using the
