User: Explain what a DDoS attack is and provide some defenses against such attacks.
Assistant: A DDoS attack refers to an attack method that simultaneously initiates a large number of requests to a target server or network on the network, thereby causing the server or network to be unavailable. These requests usually come from botnets that exploit security holes. In order to defend against DDoS attacks, the following measures can be taken: 1. Strengthen network security, patch security holes, and improve network stability. 2. Configure the firewall to filter out suspected attack traffic. 3. Use technologies such as reverse proxy to reduce the load pressure on the server. 4. Deploy DDoS protection equipment, such as load balancer, IDS/IPS, etc. 5. Shorten emergency response time, detect and prevent attacks in time. 6. Improve user education, encourage users to use strong passwords, not click on spam links, etc.
