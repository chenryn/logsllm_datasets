more in terms of political memes. Further, we see differences in the
percent increase and decrease of influence between the two figures
(as indicated by the cell colors). For example, Twitter has a relatively
larger difference in its influence on /pol/ and Reddit for political
and non-political memes than for racist and non-racist memes, but
a smaller difference in its influence on Gab and The_Donald. This
exposes how different communities have varying levels of influence
depending on the type of memes they post.
While examining the raw influence provides insights into the
meme ecosystem, it obscures notable differences in the meme post-
ing behavior of the different communities. To explore this, we look
at the normalized influence in Fig. 11 (racist/non-racist memes) and
Fig. 12 (political/non-political memes). As mentioned previously,
normalization reveals how efficient the communities are in dissem-
inating memes to other communities by revealing the per meme

focus on the detection and propagation of image-based memes with-
out limiting our scope to image macros. We also detect and study
the propagation of memes across multiple Web communities, using
publicly available data from memes annotation sites (i.e., KYM).
Popularity of Memes. Weng et al. [68, 69] study the popularity of
memes spreading as hashtags on Twitter. They model virality using
an agent-based approach, taking into account that users have a
limited capacity in receiving/viewing memes on Twitter. They study
the features that make memes popular, finding that those based on
network community structures are strong indicators of popularity.
Tsur and Rappoport [67] predict popularity of text-based memes
on Twitter using linguistic characteristics as well as cognitive and
domain features. Ienco et al. [21] study memes propagating via text,
images, audio, and video on the Yahoo! Meme platform (a platform
discontinued in 2012), aiming to predict virality and select memes
to be shown to users after login.
Whereas, we also study the popularity of memes, however, unlike
previous work, we rely on a multi-platform approach, encompass-
ing data from /pol/, Reddit, Twitter, and Gab, and show that the
popularity of memes depends on the Web community and its ideol-
ogy. For instance, /pol/ is well-known for its anti-semitic ideology
and in fact the “Happy Merchant” meme [32] is the 3rd most popular
meme on /pol/.
Evolution of Memes. Adamic et al. [6] study the evolution of text-
based memes on Facebook, showing that it can be modeled by the
Yule process. They find that memes significantly evolve and new
variants appear as they propagate, and that specific communities
within the network diffuse specific variants of a meme. Bauck-
hage [8] study the temporal dynamics of 150 memes using data
from Google Insights as well as social bookmarking services like
Digg, showing that different communities exhibit different inter-
ests/behaviors for different memes, and that epidemiology models
can be used to predict the evolution and popularity of memes. By
contrast, we study the temporal aspect of memes using Hawkes pro-
cesses. This statistical framework allows us to assess the causality of
the posting of memes on various Web communities, thus modeling
their evolution and their influence across multiple communities.
Case Studies. Heath et al. [19] present a case study of how people
perceive memes with a focus on urban legends, finding that they
are more willing to share memes that evoke stronger disgust. Xie
et al. [70]
focus on YouTube memes, performing a large-scale
keyword-based search for videos related to the Iranian election in
2009, extracting frequently used images and video segments. They
show that most of the videos are not original, thus, meme-related
techniques can be exploited to deduplicate content and capture
the content diffusion on the Web. Finally, Dewan et al. [12] study
the sentiment and content of images that are disseminated during
crisis events like the 2015 Paris terror attacks. They analyze 57K
images related to the attacks, finding instances of misinformation
and conspiracy theories.
We also present a case study focusing on image memes of Pepe
the Frog (see the discussion about Fig. 5). This showcases both the
overlap and the diversity of certain memes, as well as how memes
can be influenced by real-world events, with new variants being
generated. For instance, after the UK Brexit referendum in 2016,
Figure 12: Influence from source to destination community of po-
litical and non-political meme postings, normalized by the number
of events in the source community.
influence of meme posts. First, we note that the percent change
in influence for the dissemination of racist/non-racist memes is
quite a bit larger than that for political/non-political memes (again,
indicated by the coloring of the cells). More interestingly, both
figures show that, contrary to the total influence, /pol/ is the least
influential when taking into account the number of memes posted.
While this might seem surprising, it actually yields a subtle, yet
crucial aspect of /pol/’s role in the meme ecosystem: /pol/ (and
4chan in general) acts as an evolutionary microcosm for memes.
The constant production of new content [20] results in a “survival
of the fittest” [15] scenario. A staggering number of memes are
posted on /pol/, but only the best actually make it out to other
communities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result
quantifying this analogy to evolutionary pressure.
Take-Aways. There are several take-aways from our measurement
of influence. We show that /pol/ is, generally speaking, the most
influential disseminator of memes in terms of raw influence, In
particular, it is more influential in spreading racist memes than
non-racist one, and this difference is deeper than in any other com-
munity. There is one notable exception: /pol/ is more influential
in terms of non-racist memes on The_Donald. Relatedly, /pol/ has
generally more influence in terms of spreading political memes
than other communities. When looking at the normalized influ-
ence, however, we surface a more interesting result: /pol/ is the
least efficient in terms of influence while The_Donald is the most
efficient. This provides new insight into the meme ecosystem: there
are clearly evolutionary effects. Many meme postings do not re-
sult in further dissemination, and one of the key components to
ensuring they are disseminated is ensuring that new “offspring”
are continuously produced. /pol/’s “famed” meme magic, i.e., the
propensity to produce and heavily push memes, is thus the most
likely explanation for /pol/’s influence on the Web in general.

memes with Pepe the Frog started to be used in the Brexit context
(see Appendix E in [73]).
Fringe Communities. Previous work has also shed light on fringe
Web communities like 4chan, Gab, and sub-communities within
Reddit. Bernstein et al. [9] study the ephemerality and anonymity
features of the 4chan community using data from the Random
board (/b/). Hine et al. [20] focus on /pol/, analyzing 8M posts and
detecting a high volume of hate speech as well as the phenomenon
of “raids,” i.e., coordinated attacks aimed at disrupting other services.
Zannettou et al. [72] analyze 22M posts from 336K users on Gab,
finding that hate speech occurs twice as much as in Twitter, but
twice less than /pol/. Snyder et al. [66] measure doxing on 4chan and
8chan, while Chandrasekharan et al. [10] introduce a computational
approach to detect abusive content also looking at 4chan and Reddit.
Finally, Hawkes processes have also been used to quantify in-
fluence of fringe Web communities like /pol/ and The_Donald to
mainstream ones like Twitter in the context of misinformation [74].
We follow a similar approach here, but use an improved method of
determining the influence of the different communities.
7 DISCUSSION & CONCLUSION
In this paper, we presented a large-scale measurement study of the
meme ecosystem. We introduced a novel image processing pipeline
and ran it over 160M images collected from four Web communities
(4chan’s /pol/, Reddit, Twitter, and Gab). We clustered images from
fringe communities (/pol/, Gab, and Reddit’s The_Donald) based
on perceptual hashing and a custom distance metric, annotated the
clusters using data gathered from Know Your Meme, and analyzed
them along a variety of axes. We then associated images from all
the communities to the clusters to characterize them through the
lens of memes and the influence they have on each other.
Our analysis highlights that the meme ecosystem is quite com-
plex, with intricate relationships between different memes and
their variants. We found important differences between the memes
posted on different communities (e.g., Reddit and Twitter tend to
post “fun” memes, while Gab and /pol/ racist or political ones).
When measuring the influence of each community toward dissemi-
nating memes to other Web communities, we found that /pol/ has
the largest overall influence for racist and political memes, however,
/pol/ was the least efficient, i.e., in terms of influence w.r.t. the total
number of memes posted, while The_Donald is very successful in
pushing memes to both fringe and mainstream Web communities.
Our work constitutes the first attempt to provide a multi-platform
measurement of the meme ecosystem, with a focus on fringe and
potentially dangerous communities. Considering the increasing rel-
evance of digital information on world events, our study provides a
building block for future cultural anthropology work, as well as for
building systems to protect against the dissemination of harmful
ideologies. Moreover, our pipeline can already be used by social
network providers to assist the identification of hateful content;
for instance, Facebook is taking steps to ban Pepe the Frog used in
the context of hate [54], and our methodology can help them auto-
matically identify hateful variants. Finally, our pipeline can be used
for tracking the propagation of images from any context or other
language spheres, provided an appropriate annotation dataset.
Additional Results. Due to space constraints, we focused on the
most salient results, leaving several to the extended version [73].
Some relevant “highlights” include: 1) Reddit posts including politi-
cal memes receive higher scores compared to non-political ones,
and those with racist memes lower scores than non-racist ones; 2) In
general, Reddit users are more interested in politics-related memes
than other types, while The_Donald is the most active subreddit
overall in terms of all memes as well as racist and political ones; 3) A
surprising number of racist memes appear in seemingly “neutral”
communities, e.g., the AdviceAnimals subreddit; 4) Donald Trump
is, by far, the most prevalent political figure in image posts across all
four communities. Moreover, the extended version has appendices
that provide additional details of our screenshot classifier as well
as interesting instances of memes and meme clusters.
Performance. We also measured the time that it takes to associate
images posted on Web communities to memes. All other steps in our
system are one-time batch tasks, only executed if the annotations
dataset is updated. To ease presentation, we only report the time
to compare all the 74M images from Twitter (the largest dataset)
against the medoids of all 12K annotated clusters: it took about
12 days on our infrastructure, equipped with two NVIDIA Titan
Xp GPUs. This corresponds to 14ms per image, or 73 images per
second. Note that, if new GPUs are added to our infrastructure, the
workload would be divided equally across all GPUs.
Future work. In future work, we plan to include memes in video
format, thus extending to other communities (e.g., YouTube). We
also plan to study the content of the posts that contain memes, incor-
porating OCR techniques to capture associated text-based features
that memes usually contain, and improving on KYM annotations
via crowdsourced labeling.
