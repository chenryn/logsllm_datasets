### Analysis of Political and Racist Memes Across Different Web Communities

#### Influence Differences in Meme Dissemination

Our analysis reveals differences in the percent increase and decrease of influence between different figures, as indicated by the cell colors. For example, Twitter has a relatively larger difference in its influence on /pol/ and Reddit for political and non-political memes compared to racist and non-racist memes. Conversely, the difference in influence on Gab and The_Donald is smaller. This highlights how different communities have varying levels of influence depending on the type of memes they post.

While raw influence provides insights into the meme ecosystem, it can obscure notable differences in the meme-posting behavior of different communities. To address this, we examine the normalized influence in Figures 11 (racist/non-racist memes) and 12 (political/non-political memes). Normalization reveals the efficiency of communities in disseminating memes to other communities by showing the per-meme influence.

#### Raw vs. Normalized Influence

- **/pol/**: Generally, /pol/ is the most influential in terms of raw influence, particularly in spreading racist and political memes. However, when normalized, /pol/ is the least efficient, indicating that while many memes are posted, only the best ones spread to other communities.
- **The_Donald**: In contrast, The_Donald is the most efficient in terms of normalized influence, suggesting that it is very successful in pushing memes to both fringe and mainstream Web communities.

This analysis provides new insights into the meme ecosystem, revealing evolutionary effects where many meme postings do not result in further dissemination. The continuous production of new "offspring" memes is a key component in ensuring their spread. /pol/'s "meme magic," characterized by the propensity to produce and heavily push memes, explains its significant influence on the Web.

- **Dubey et al. [13]**: Extraction of semantic embeddings for meme images.

In contrast, our work focuses on a multi-platform approach, encompassing data from /pol/, Reddit, Twitter, and Gab, and shows that the popularity of memes depends on the Web community and its ideology. For instance, /pol/ is well-known for its anti-Semitic ideology, and the "Happy Merchant" meme is the third most popular on /pol/.

#### Evolution of Memes

- **Adamic et al. [6]**: Study of the evolution of text-based memes on Facebook, modeled by the Yule process.
- **Bauckhage [8]**: Temporal dynamics of 150 memes using data from Google Insights and social bookmarking services, showing that different communities exhibit different interests and behaviors for different memes.

We use Hawkes processes to study the temporal aspect of memes, allowing us to assess the causality of meme posting across various Web communities and model their evolution and influence.

#### Case Studies

- **Heath et al. [19]**: Perceptions of urban legends, finding that people are more willing to share memes that evoke stronger disgust.
- **Xie et al. [70]**: Large-scale keyword-based search for YouTube videos related to the 2009 Iranian election, showing that most videos are not original, and meme-related techniques can be used to deduplicate content.
- **Dewan et al. [12]**: Sentiment and content analysis of images disseminated during the 2015 Paris terror attacks, finding instances of misinformation and conspiracy theories.

We present a case study on Pepe the Frog, showcasing the overlap and diversity of certain memes and how they can be influenced by real-world events, such as the UK Brexit referendum in 2016.

### Discussion and Conclusion

In this paper, we conducted a large-scale measurement study of the meme ecosystem. We introduced a novel image processing pipeline and analyzed 160M images from four Web communities: 4chan's /pol/, Reddit, Twitter, and Gab. Our findings highlight the complexity of the meme ecosystem, with intricate relationships between different memes and their variants.

- **Community Differences**: Reddit and Twitter tend to post "fun" memes, while Gab and /pol/ post more racist or political ones.
- **Influence Measurement**: /pol/ has the largest overall influence for racist and political memes but is the least efficient. The_Donald is very successful in pushing memes to both fringe and mainstream communities.

Our work is the first to provide a multi-platform measurement of the meme ecosystem, with a focus on fringe and potentially dangerous communities. It serves as a building block for future cultural anthropology work and for building systems to protect against the dissemination of harmful ideologies. Our pipeline can also assist social network providers in identifying hateful content, such as the ban on Pepe the Frog in hate contexts on Facebook.

### Additional Results

Due to space constraints, we focused on the most salient results, leaving several to the extended version [73]. Some highlights include:
- **Reddit Scores**: Political memes receive higher scores, while racist memes receive lower scores.
- **User Interest**: Reddit users are more interested in politics-related memes, and The_Donald is the most active subreddit for all types of memes.
- **Racist Memes**: A surprising number appear in seemingly "neutral" communities like AdviceAnimals.
- **Political Figures**: Donald Trump is the most prevalent political figure in image posts across all four communities.

### Performance

We measured the time it takes to associate images posted on Web communities to memes. For 74M images from Twitter, it took about 12 days on our infrastructure equipped with two NVIDIA Titan Xp GPUs, corresponding to 14ms per image or 73 images per second.

### Future Work

Future work will include extending our analysis to video format memes, studying the content of posts containing memes, and improving KYM annotations via crowdsourced labeling.
