2.5 MEMS Microphones
MEMS is an integrated implementation of mechanical compo-
nents on a chip, typically fabricated with an etching process.
While there are a number of different MEMS sensors (e.g.,
accelerometers and gyroscopes), in this paper we focus on
MEMS-based microphones, which are particularly popular in
mobile and embedded applications (such as smartphones and
smart speakers) due to their small footprints and low prices.
Microphone Overview. The left column of Figure 2 shows
the construction of a typical backport MEMS microphone,
which is composed of a diaphragm and an ASIC circuit. The
diaphragm is a thin membrane that ﬂexes in response to an
acoustic wave. The diaphragm and a ﬁxed back plate work
as a parallel-plate capacitor, whose capacitance changes as a
consequence of the diaphragm’s mechanical deformations as
it responds to alternating sound pressures. Finally, the ASIC
die converts the capacitive change to a voltage signal on the
output of the microphone.
Microphone Mounting. A backport MEMS microphone is
mounted on the surface of a printed circuit board (PCB), with
the microphone’s aperture exposed through a cavity on the
PCB (see the third column of Figure 2). The cavity, in turn,
is part of an acoustic path that guides sound through holes
(acoustic ports) in the device’s chassis to the microphone’s
aperture. Finally, the device’s acoustic ports typically have
a ﬁne mesh as shown in Figure 3 to prevent dirt and foreign
objects from entering the microphone.
2.6 Laser Sources
Choice of a Laser. A laser is a device that emits a beam of
coherent light that stays narrow over a long distance and be
focused to a tight spot. While other alternatives exist, in this
paper we focus on laser emitting diodes, which are common
in consumer laser products such as laser pointers. Next, as
the light intensity emitted from a laser diode is directly pro-
portional to the diode’s driving current, we can easily encode
analog signals via the beam’s intensity by using a laser driver
capable of amplitude modulation.
Laser Safety and Availability. As strong, tightly focused
lights can be potentially hazardous, there are standards in
place regulating lights emitted from laser systems [28, 29]
that divide lasers into classes based on the potential for injury
resulting from beam exposure. In this paper, we are interested
in two main types of devices, which we now describe.
Low-Power Class 3R Systems.
This class contains de-
vices whose output power is less than 5 mW at visible wave-
length (400–700 nm, see Figure 4). While prolonged inten-
tional eye exposure to the beam emitted from these devices
might be harmful, these lasers are considered safe for brief
eye-exposures. As such, class 3R systems form a good com-
promise between safety and usability, making these lasers
common in consumer products such as laser pointers.
High-Power Class 3B and Class 4 Systems. Next, lasers
that emit between 5 and 500 mW are classiﬁed as class 3B
systems, and might cause eye injury even from short beam
exposure durations. Finally, lasers that emit over 500 mW of
power are categorized as class 4, which can instantaneously
cause blindness, skin burns and ﬁres. As such, uncontrolled
exposure to class 4 laser beams should be strongly avoided.
However, despite the regulation, there are reports of high-
power class 3B and 4 systems being openly sold as “laser
pointers” [30]. While purchasing laser pointers from Ama-
zon and eBay, we have discovered a troubling discrepancy
between the rated and actual power of laser products. While
the labels and descriptions of most products stated an output
power of 5 mW, the actual measured power was sometimes
as high as 1 W (i.e., ×200 above the allowable limit).
3 Threat Model
The attacker’s goal is to remotely inject malicious commands
into the targeted voice-controllable device without being de-
tected by the device’s owner. More speciﬁcally, we consider
the following threat model.
No Physical Access or Owner Interaction. We assume
that the attacker does not have any physical access to the
victim device. Thus, the attacker cannot press any buttons,
alter voice-inaccessible settings, or compromise the device’s
software. Finally, we assume that the attacker cannot make
the device’s owner perform any useful interaction (such as
pressing a button or unlocking the screen).
Line of Sight. We do assume however that the attacker has
remote line of sight access to the target device and its micro-
phones. We argue that such an assumption is reasonable, as
voice-activated devices (such as smart speakers, thermostats,
security cameras, or even phones) are often left visible to the
attacker, including through closed glass windows.

the devices, and there are meshes inside the port.
Figure 4: Wavelength and color of light
Device Feedback. We note that the remote line of sight ac-
cess to the target device usually allows the attacker to observe
the device’s LED lights. Generally, these LEDs light up after
a device properly recognizes its wake-up word (e.g., Alexa,
Hey Google) and show unique colors and light patterns once
a voice command has been recognized and accepted. Observ-
ing the lights, an attacker can use this feedback to remotely
determine if an attack attempt was successful.
Device Characteristics.
Finally, we also assume that the
attacker has access to a device of a similar model as the tar-
get device. Thus, the attacker knows all the target’s physical
characteristics, such as location of the microphone ports and
physical structure of the device’s sound path. Such knowl-
edge can easily be acquired by purchasing and analyzing a
device of the same model before launching attacks. We do
not, however, assume that the attacker has prior access the
speciﬁc device instance used by the victim. In particular, all
the experiments done in this paper were empirically veriﬁed
to be applicable to other devices of the same model available
to us without instance-speciﬁc calibration.
4 Injecting Sound via Laser Light
4.1 Signal Injection Feasibility
In this section we explore the feasibility of injecting acous-
tic signals into microphones using laser light. We begin by
describing our experimental setup.
Setup. We used a blue Osram PLT5 450B 450-nm laser
diode connected to a Thorlabs LDC205C laser driver. We
increased the diode’s DC current with the driver until it emit-
ted a continuous 5 mW laser beam, while measuring light
intensity using the Thorlabs S121C photo-diode power sensor.
The beam was subsequently directed to the acoustic port on
the SparkFun MEMS microphone breakout board mounting
the Analog Devices ADMP401 MEMS microphone. Finally,
we recorded the diode current and the microphone’s output
using a Tektronix MSO5204 oscilloscope, see Figure 5. The
experiments were conducted in a regular ofﬁce environment,
with typical ambient noise from human speech, computers,
and air conditioning systems.
Signal Injection by Converting Sound to Light.
To con-
vert sound signals into light, we encode the intensity of the
sound signal as the intensity of the laser beam, where louder
sounds make for larger changes in light intensity and weaker
sounds correspond to smaller changes. Next, as the intensity
of the light beam emitted from the laser diode is direction
proportional with the supplied current, we use a laser driver
to regulate the laser diode’s current as a function of an audio
ﬁle played into the driver’s input port. This resulted in the
audio waveform being directly encoded in the intensity of the
light emitted by the laser.
More speciﬁcally, we used the current driver to modulate
a sine wave on top of the diode’s current It via amplitude
modulation (AM), given by the following equation:
It = IDC +
Ipp
2
sin(2π f t)
(1)
where IDC is a DC bias, Ipp is the peak-to-peak amplitude,
and f is the frequency. In this section, we set IDC = 26.2 mA,
Ipp = 7 mA and f = 1 kHz. The sine wave was played using
a laptop’s on-board soundcard, where the speaker output was
connected to the modulation input port on the laser driver
via a Neoteck NTK059 audio ampliﬁer. The laser driver [31]
performs an amplitude modulation (AM) of the sine wave
onto its output current without needing additional custom
circuits or software. Finally, as the light intensity emitted by
the laser diode is directly proportional to the current provided
by the laser driver, this resulted in a 1 kHz sine wave directly
encoded in the intensity of the light emitted by the laser diode.
Observing the Microphone Output.
As can be seen in
Figure 5, the microphone output clearly shows a 1 kHz sine
wave that matches the frequency of the injected signal without
any noticeable distortion.

4.2 Characterizing Laser Audio Injection
Having successfully demonstrated the possibility of injecting
audio signals via laser beams, we now proceed to characterize
the light intensity response of the diodes (as a function of cur-
rent) and the frequency response of the microphone to laser-
based audio injection. To see the wavelength dependency,
we also examine a 638-nm red laser (Ushio HL63603TG) in
addition to the blue one used in the previous experiment.
Laser Current to Light Characteristics. We begin by
examining the relationship between the diode current and the
optical power of the laser. For this purpose, we aimed a laser
beam at our Thorlabs S121C power sensor while driving the
diodes with DC currents, i.e., Ipp = 0 in Equation 1. Consid-
ering the different properties of the diodes, the blue and red
laser are examined up to 300 and 200 mA, respectively.
The ﬁrst column of Figure 6 shows the current vs. light (I-
L) curves for the blue and red lasers. The horizontal axis is the
diode current IDC and the vertical axis is the optical power. As
can be seen, once the current provided to the laser is above the
diode-speciﬁc threshold (denoted by Ith), the light power emit-
ted by the laser increases linearly with the provided current.
Thus, as |sin(2π f t)|  Ith.
Laser Current to Sound Characteristics. We now proceed
to characterize the effect of light injection on a MEMS micro-
phone. We achieve this by aiming an amplitude-modulated
(AM) laser beam with variable current amplitudes (Ipp) and
a constant current offset (IDC) into the aperture of the Ana-
log Devices ADMP401 microphone, mounted on a breakout
board. We subsequently monitor the peak-to-peak voltage of
the microphone’s output, plotting the resulting signal.
The second column of Figure 6 shows the relationship
between the modulating signal Ipp and the resulting signal
Vpp for both the blue and red laser diodes. The results suggest
that the driving alternating current Ipp (cf. the bias current)
is the key for strong injection: we can linearly increase the
sound volume received by the microphone by increasing the
driving AC current Ipp.
Choosing IDC and Ipp. Given a laser diode that can emit a
maximum average power of L mW, we would like to choose
the values for IDC and Ipp which result in the strongest pos-
sible microphone output signals, while having the average
optical power emitted by the laser be less than or equal to L
mW. From the leftmost column of Figure 6, we deduce that the
laser’s output power is linearly proportional to the laser’s driv-
ing current It = IDC + Ipp sin(2π f t), and the average power
depends mostly on IDC, as Ipp sin(2π f t) averages out to zero.
Thus, to stay within the power budget of L mW while
obtaining the strongest possible signal at the microphone
output, the attacker must ﬁrst determine the DC current offset
IDC that results in the diode outputting light at L mW, and then
subsequently maximize the amplitude of the microphone’s
output signal by setting Ipp/2 = IDC − Ith.*
Characterizing the Frequency Response of Laser Audio
Injection.
Next, we set out to characterize the response
of the microphone to different frequencies of laser-injected
sound signals. We use the same operating points as the previ-
ous experiment, and set the tone’s amplitude such that it ﬁts
with the linear region (IDC = 200 mA and Ipp = 150 mA for
the blue laser, and IDC = 150 mA and Ipp = 75 mA for the red
laser). We then record the microphone’s output levels while
changing the frequency f of the light-modulated sine wave.
The third column of Figure 6 shows the obtained frequency
response for both blue and red lasers. The horizontal axis is
the frequency while the vertical axis is the peak-to-peak volt-
age of the microphone output. Both lasers have very similar
responses, covering the entire audible band 20 Hz–20 kHz,
implying the possibility of injecting any audio signal.
Choice of Laser.
Finally, we note the color insensitivity
of injection. Although blue and red lights are on the other
edges on the visible spectrum (see Figure 4), the levels of
injected audio signal are in the same range and the shapes
of the frequency-response curves are also similar. Therefore,
color has low priority in choosing a laser compared to other
factors for making LightCommands. In this paper, we consis-
tently use the 450-nm blue laser mainly because of (i) better
availability of high-power diodes and (ii) the advantage in
focusing because of a shorter wavelength.
*We note here that the subtraction of Ith is designed to ensure that
IDC − Ipp/2 > Ith, meaning that the diode stays in its linear region thereby
avoiding signal distortion.

4.3 Mechanical or Electrical Transduction?
In this section we set out to investigate the physical root cause
behind of the microphone’s sensitivity to light. We consider
both the photoelectric and photoacoustic effects, and try to
distinguish between them by selectively illuminating different
parts of the microphone’s internal structure using lasers.
Photoelectric Effect.
Traditional laser fault injection at-
tacks on semiconductor chips (as described in 2.4) are ex-
plained by the photoelectric effect in transistors [26, 27] re-
sulting in irregularities in the device’s digital logic. Like-
wise, MEMS microphones also have ASICs inside their pack-
ages, which are used for converting the capacitive changes of
the diaphragm into an electrical signal (see Figure 2). Such
ASICs can be externally-illuminated via lasers through the
microphone’s exposed acoustic port. As strong light hits a
semiconductor chip, it induces a photocurrent across a tran-
sistor, where the current’s strength is proportional to the light
intensity [24]. The analog part of the microphone’s ASIC
recognizes this photocurrent as a genuine signal from the di-
aphragm, resulting in the microphone treating light as sound.
Conﬁrming this, while not common in smart speakers, we
have seen several other microphone vendors covering the
ASIC with opaque resin, known in the industry as “goop”.
Photoacoustic Effect. The light sensitivity of microphones
can also be attributed to the photoacoustic effect [32], which
converts optical to kinetic energy and induces mechanical
vibration at the illuminated material. The effect is well known
for more than 100 years since its discovery by Alexander
Graham Bell back in 1880 [33], which is now used for spec-
troscopy and bioimaging. Although we have not found any
previous work on the photoacoustic effect speciﬁc to a MEMS
microphone, the effect is universal and available even with
ambient water vapor in the air [34].
Selective Laser Illumination. We can further narrow the
root cause of the microphone’s light sensitivity, by noticing
that the photoelectric effect happens on an ASIC while the
