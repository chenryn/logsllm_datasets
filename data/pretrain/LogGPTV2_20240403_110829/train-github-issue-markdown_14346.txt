In the bootstrap.css file there are few properties which are are repeated
twice, starting at line no 719:
This is repeated [appears in line 719 & again in 729]:
.container:before,  
.container:after {  
display: table;  
content: " ";  
}
.container:after {  
clear: both;  
}
And this is repeated [appears in line 739 & again in 749]:
.row:before,  
.row:after {  
display: table;  
content: " ";  
}
.row:after {  
clear: both;  
}
The same duplication has found its way into bootstrap.min.css as well.
