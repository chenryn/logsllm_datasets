About the importance of web servers: A web server is a program used to publish static and dynamic web content. It receives requests from users and responds or returns appropriate messages or content. For dynamic web applications, the web server typically forwards requests to the application server to generate dynamic content, which is then returned to the user. The role played by a web server in a web application is very important. It is the core of the entire infrastructure, responsible for handling user requests, handling load balancing, security, and scalability. Therefore, properly configuring and managing your web server is critical to the functioning of your website and user experience.
