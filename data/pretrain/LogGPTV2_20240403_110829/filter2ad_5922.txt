1. Introduction
Illinois at Urbana Champaign)
The goals of HotDep are to bring forth cutting-
edge research ideas spanning the domains of fault toler-
ance/reliability and systems, and to build linkages between
the two communities (e.g., between people who attend tra-
ditional ”dependability” conferences such as DSN and IS-
SRE, and those who attend ”systems” conferences such as
OSDI, SOSP, and EuroSys). Previous HotDep workshop
programs are available at
http://hotdep.org/
To achieve these goals, we selected a program com-
mittee for HotDep’07 with a mix of people from both
communities.
The program committee for this year’s
workshop was composed of:
Marcos K. Aguilera, Hewlett-Packard Labs
Lorenzo Alvisi, University of Texas at Austin
Paul Barham, Microsoft Research, Cambridge
Garth Gibson, Carnegie Mellon University
Anne-Marie Kermarrec, INRIA, Rennes
Petros Maniatis, Intel Research
Armando Fox, University of California, Berkeley
Ashvin Goel, University of Toronto
Rick Schlichting, AT&T Labs
Paulo Verissimo, University of Lisboa, Portugal
Yuanyuan Zhou, UIUC
Willy Zwaenepoel, EPFL, Lausanne
We received 22 submissions. The program committee
wrote a total of 118 reviews and each paper was reviewed
by at least 5 program committee members. After a meeting
in Lisbon on March 23, we decided to accept 6 papers
and to accept 16 of the other submissions as posters to be
presented at the workshop. The 6 accepted papers were:
Delta Execution for Software Reliability Yuanyuan Zhou,
Darkov Marinov, Craig Zilles, William Sanders, Joe Tucek,
Marcelo D’Amorim, and Steven Lauterburg (University of
Reliable Device Drivers Require Well-Deﬁned Protocols
Leonid Ryzhyk, Timothy Bourke, and Ihor Kuz (NICTA
and the University of New South Wales)
Large-Scale Byzantine Fault Tolerance:
Safe but Not
Always Live Rodrigo Rodrigues (INESC-ID and Tech.
Univ. Lisbon), Petr Kouznetsov (MPI-SWS), and Bobby
Bhattacharjee (Univ. of Maryland)
Data Sanitization:
Improving the Forensic Utility of
Anomaly Detection Systems Gabriela F. Cretu, An-
gelos Stavrou, Salvatore J. Stolfo and Angelos D.
Keromytis(Columbia University)
Improving Dependability by Revisiting Operating System
Design Francis David, Jeffrey Carlyle, Roy Campbell,
Ellick Chan, and Philip Reames (University of Illinois at
Urbana Champaign)
Classic Paxos vs. Fast Paxos: Caveat Emptor Flavio
Junqueira (Yahoo! Research), Yanhua Mao, and Keith
Marzullo (UC San Diego)
The posters span many subjects: operating systems,
hardware, networking, security, and distributed systems.
The papers and posters will be published in a supplement
to the DSN proceedings and also online at
http://hotdep.org/2007
We thank all the authors, the program committee, and
George Candea (the chair of the steering committee) for
helping us put this fun program together.
