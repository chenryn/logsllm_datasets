 **Romeo Gregorie** opened **SPR-3176** and commented
I was exploring Spring remoting with the jpetstore sample from 2.0.2 release
and wasted half a day trying to figure "...table not found..." errors and
additionally created hsql database files ending with the \r char.
It turned out the shell script has DOS line ending. Unfortunately, I did not
search here first. Issue SRP-305 reported in 2004 !? addresses the same issue.
Could someone please fix this issue, so nobody wastes time on it any more. And
while you are at it, why not remove the DOS characters all together, from the
code too. I doubt they are needed even on the win platform.
