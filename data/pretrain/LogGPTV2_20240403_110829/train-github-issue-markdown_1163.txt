While exploring Spring remoting using the jPetStore sample from the 2.0.2 release, I encountered a series of "table not found" errors that took me half a day to resolve. Additionally, I noticed that HSQL database files were being created with an unintended carriage return (\r) character at the end. The root cause was identified as the shell script having DOS line endings, which caused these issues.

Unfortunately, I did not check the issue tracker first, and it turns out that a similar problem was reported in 2004 under SRP-305.

Could someone please address this issue to prevent others from wasting time on it? Furthermore, I suggest removing all DOS line endings from the codebase, as they are likely unnecessary even on Windows platforms.
