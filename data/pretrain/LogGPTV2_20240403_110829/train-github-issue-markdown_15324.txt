It appears there is an issue with the following code in Julia 1.6.1:

```julia
julia> [1][begin:end]
1-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
```

When attempting to use the `@less` macro to view the lowered form of the expression, an error occurs:

```julia
julia> @less [1][begin:end]
ERROR: UndefVarError: begin not defined
Stacktrace:
 [1] top-level scope
   @ REPL[16]:1
```

The error indicates that the variable `begin` is not defined in this context.
