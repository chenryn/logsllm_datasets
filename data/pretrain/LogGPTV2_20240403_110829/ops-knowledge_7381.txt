User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题What are these zero-length files created by Apache in the tmp directory? Any ideas on why apache (httpd) creates these files in /tmp? I'm on Redhat 5.5 and Apache 2.2, mpm-prefork.

Sometimes, I see dozens of these, and I always delete them, but haven't found anything on why or how these files are generated in the first place. Error logs look clean, albeit, they're set to Error. 

Update: Application is Drupal 7, running on PHP 5.3.2.

Assistant: /tmp is PHP's default folder for session data.  You can change this by editing the "session_save_path" in your php.ini file.  The being said, various scripts could write various session data here.

There are cases where lax permissions in this folder have led to vulnerabilities (UID/Symlink attacks), so if you suspect these files don't line up with what your PHP application is expected to be doing, I might recommend redirecting your PHP sesion files and watching this area closely.
