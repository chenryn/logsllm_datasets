though, DeCaptcher does not pay PixProﬁt workers dou-
ble the amount for solving them, consequently increasing
its proﬁt margin on these new CAPTCHAs.
Figure 12: ImageToText error rate for the custom Asirra
CAPTCHA over time.
CAPTCHA suitable for use with standard solver image
APIs. Figure 11 shows an example. We wrote the in-
structions “Find all cats” in English, Chinese (Simpl.),
Russian and Hindi across the top, as the majority of
the workers speak one of these languages. We submitted
this image once every three minutes to all services over
12 days. ImageToText displayed a remarkable adapt-
ability to this new CAPTCHA type, successfully solv-
ing the CAPTCHA on average 39.9% of the time. Fig-
ure 12 shows the declining error rate for ImageToText; as
time progresses, the workers become increasingly adept
at solving the CAPTCHA. The next closest service was
BeatCaptchas, which succeeded 20.4% of the time. The
remaining services, excluding DeCaptcher, had success
rates below 7%.
Coincidentally, as we were evaluating our own ver-
sion of the Asirra CAPTCHA, on January 17th, 2010 De-
Captcher began offering an API method that supported it
directly—albeit at $4 per 1,000 Asirra solves (double its
base price). Microsoft had deployed the Asirra CAPTCHA
on December 8th, 2009 on Club Bing. Demand for solv-
ing this CAPTCHA was apparently sufﬁciently strong
enough that DeCaptcher took only ﬁve weeks to incorpo-
rate it into their service. We then performed the same ex-
periment described above using the new DeCaptcher API
method and received 1,494 responses. DeCaptcher suc-
cessfully solved 696 (46.5%) requests with a median re-
sponse time of 39 seconds, about 2.3 times its median of
17 seconds for regular CAPTCHAs. DeCaptcher appears

6.6 Targeted Sites
Customers of CAPTCHA-solving services target a num-
ber of different Web sites. Using our worker accounts
on Kolotibablo and PixProﬁt, the public worker sites
of Antigate and DeCaptcher, respectively, we can iden-
tify which Web sites are targeted by the customers of
these services. Over the course of 82 days we recorded
over 25,000 CAPTCHAs from Kolotibablo and 28,000
CAPTCHAs from PixProﬁt.
To identify the Web sites from which these CAPTCHAs
originated, we ﬁrst grouped the CAPTCHAs by image di-
mensions. Most groups consisted of a single CAPTCHA
type, which we conﬁrmed visually. We then attempted to
identify the Web sites from which these CAPTCHAs were
taken. In this manner we identiﬁed 90% of Kolotibablo
CAPTCHAs and 94% of PixProﬁt CAPTCHAs.
Table 3 shows the top ﬁve CAPTCHA types we ob-
served on Kolotibablo and PixProﬁt, with the remaining
identiﬁed CAPTCHA types (18 CAPTCHA in both cases)
representing 14% and 4% of the CAPTCHA volume on
Kolotibablo and PixProﬁt respectively. Both distribu-
tions of CAPTCHA types are highly skewed: on PixProﬁt,
the top two CAPTCHAs types represent 81% of the vol-
ume, with the top ﬁve accounting for 91%. Kolotibablo
is not quite as concentrated, but the top ﬁve still account
for 76% of its volume.
Clearly the markets for the services are different. Al-
though Microsoft is by far the most common target for
both, PixProﬁt tailors to CAPTCHAs from large global
services (Google, Yahoo, AOL, and MySpace) whereas
Russian sites otherwise dominate Kolotibablo (VKon-
takte.ru, Mail.ru, CAPTCHA.ru, Mamba.ru, and Yan-
dex) — a demographic that correlates well with the ob-
served worker ﬂuency in Russian for Antigate (Table 2).

By design, CAPTCHAs are simple and easy to solve by
humans. Their “low-impact” quality makes them attrac-
tive to site operators who are wary of any defense that
could turn away visitors. However, this same quality has
made them easy to outsource to the global unskilled la-
bor market. In this study, we have shed light on the
business of solving CAPTCHAs, showing it to be a well-
developed, highly-competitive industry with the capac-
ity to solve on the order of a million CAPTCHAs per
day. Wholesale and retail prices continue to decline, sug-
gesting that this is a demand-limited market; an asser-
tion further supported by our informal survey of several
freelancer forums where workers in search of CAPTCHA-
solving work greatly outnumber CAPTCHA-solving ser-
vice recruitments. One may well ask: Do CAPTCHAs ac-
tually work? The answer depends on what it is that we
expect CAPTCHAs to do.
Telling computers and humans apart. The original
purpose of CAPTCHAs is to distinguish humans from ma-
chines. To this day, no completely general means of solv-
ing CAPTCHAs has emerged, nor is the cat-and-mouse
game of creating automated solvers viable as a business
model. In this regard, then, CAPTCHAs have succeeded.
Preventing automated site access. Today,
the re-
tail price for solving one million CAPTCHAs is as
low as $1,000. Indeed, for well-motivated adversaries,
CAPTCHAs are an acceptable cost of doing business
when measured against the value of gaining access to the
protected resource. E-mail spammers, for example, solve
CAPTCHAs to gain access to Web mail accounts from
which to send their advertisements, while blog spam-
mers seek to acquire organic “clicks” and inﬂuence result
placement on major search engines. Thus, in an absolute
sense, CAPTCHAs do not prevent large-scale automated
site access.
Limiting automated site access. However, it is short-
sighted to evaluate CAPTCHAs as a defense in isolation.
Rather, they exert friction on the underlying economic
model and should be evaluated in terms of how efﬁ-
ciently they can undermine the attacker’s proﬁtability.
Put simply, a CAPTCHA reduces an attacker’s expected
proﬁt by the cost of solving the CAPTCHA. If the at-
tacker’s revenue cannot cover this cost, CAPTCHAs as
a defense mechanism have succeeded. Indeed, for many
sites (e.g., low PageRank blogs), CAPTCHAs alone may
be sufﬁcient to dissuade abuse. For higher-value sites,
CAPTCHAs place a utilization constraint on otherwise
“free” resources, below which it makes no sense to target
them. Taking e-mail spam as an example, let us suppose
that each newly registered Web mail account can send
some number of spam messages before being shut down.
The marginal revenue per message is given by the aver-
age revenue per sale divided by the expected number of
messages needed to generate a single sale. For pharma-
ceutical spam, Kanich et al. [14] estimate the marginal
revenue per message to be roughly $0.00001; at $1 per
1,000 CAPTCHAs, a new Web mail account starts to break
even only after about 100 messages sent.9
Thus, CAPTCHAs naturally limit site access to those
attackers whose business models are efﬁcient enough to
be proﬁtable in spite of these costs and act as a drag on
proﬁt for all actors. Indeed, MR. E reported that while
his service had thousands of customers, 75% of trafﬁc
was generated by a small subset of them (5–10).
The role of CAPTCHAs today. Continuing our reason-
ing, the proﬁtability of any particular scam is a function
of three factors: the cost of CAPTCHA-solving, the ef-
fectiveness of any secondary defenses (e.g., SMS valida-
tion, account shutdowns, additional CAPTCHA screens,
etc.) and the efﬁciency of the attacker’s business model.
As the cost of CAPTCHA solving decreases, a site oper-
ator must employ secondary defenses more aggressively
to maintain a given level of fraud.
Unfortunately, secondary defenses are invariably more
expensive both in infrastructure and customer impact
when compared to CAPTCHAs. However, a key observa-
tion is that secondary defenses need only be deployed
quickly enough to undermine proﬁtability (e.g., within a
certain number of messages sent, accounts registered per
IP, etc.). Indeed, the optimal point for this transition is
precisely the point at which the attacker ”breaks even.”
Before this point it is preferable to use CAPTCHAs to
minimize the cost burden to the site owner and the poten-
tial impact on legitimate users. While we do not believe
that such economic models have been carefully devel-
oped by site owners, we see evidence that precisely this
kind of tradeoff is being made. For example, a number of
popular sites such as Google are now making aggressive
use of secondary mechanisms to screen account sign-
ups (e.g., SMS challenges), but only after a CAPTCHA is
passed and some usage threshold is triggered (e.g., mul-
tiple sign-ups from the same IP address).10
In summary, we have argued that CAPTCHAs, while
traditionally viewed as a technological impediment to
an attacker, should more properly be regarded as an
economic one, as witnessed by a robust and mature
CAPTCHA-solving industry which bypasses the underly-
9These numbers should be taken with a grain of salt, both be-
cause the cited study is but a single data point, and because they stud-
ied SMTP-based spam, which generally has lower deliverability than
Webmail-based spam. Anecdotally, the retail cost of Webmail-based
delivery can be over 100 times more than via SMTP from raw bots.
10Anecdotally, this strategy appears effective for now and Gmail ac-
counts on the underground market have gone from a typical asking
price of $8/1,000, to being hard to come by at any price. We will not
be surprised, however, if this mechanism leads to the monetization of
smartphone botnets, or mobots [10], in response.

ing technological issue completely. Viewed in this light,
CAPTCHAs are a low-impact mechanism that adds fric-
tion to the attacker’s business model and thus minimizes
the cost and legitimate user impact of heavier-weight sec-
ondary defenses. CAPTCHAs continue to serve this func-
tion, but as with most such defensive mechanisms, they
simply work less efﬁciently over time.
