**Title: BlackHat EU-18: Attacking and Defending Blockchains: From Horror Stories to Secure Wallets**

In this talk, we will examine some of the most significant security failures in blockchain systems and provide strategies to mitigate these risks. We will delve into notable Ethereum smart contract vulnerabilities, critically analyze the case of Iota's custom cryptography, and share a real-world example where we identified a potential exploit that could have resulted in the theft of millions of dollars worth of tokens (which we did not execute). Additionally, we will present examples of critical bugs discovered in widely used Bitcoin software utilities.

The second part of the talk will focus on different types of cryptocurrency wallets, their respective advantages and disadvantages, and the risks and benefits associated with hardware-based wallets for individuals, organizations, and trading platforms. The speaker brings extensive experience in auditing blockchain systems for leading cryptocurrencies and currently plays a key role in securing a major cryptocurrency exchange platform.
