3.1.1 Session 1
The initial one-hour session was divided into three phases: Prac-
tice, Password Generation, and Retention, as shown in Table 1.
First, participants completed a Practice phase with two trials. For
each trial, they created, conﬁrmed, and logged in with one pass-
word. This phase was used to explain the process and familiarize
participants with the user interface. During Practice phase, partic-
ipants were told that they did not need to remember their practice
passwords and would not be asked about them again.
In the Password Generation phase, participants completed 6 tri-
als where they created distinct passwords, each associated with a
different pre-deﬁned “account”: bank, email, instant messenger,
library, online dating, and work. The accounts were identiﬁed by
coloured banners at the top of the application window that included
a unique icon and the account name (see Figures 8 and 9). In this
phase, the accounts were presented to all participants in the same
order. For PassPoints, each account was associated with a distinct
image, so participants never had more than one password per im-
age. Furthermore, the PassPoints accounts were consistently paired
with the same images (although in a real implementation, a system
would use different images for different participants and offer a
new image if a user reset a password). This design decision al-
lowed us to gather enough data on each image to assess whether
hotspots and patterns occurred as a result of having multiple pass-
words, and to remove a potential confounding variable. Participants
were asked to pick realistic passwords that they could remember
but that would be difﬁcult for others to guess. They were further
told that they would need to remember these passwords later and
reminded that each password was created for a speciﬁc account. In
Figure 8: Password creation interface (Text condition).
total, 395 account passwords were created: 204 in the Text condi-
tion and 191 in the PassPoints condition.
During the Practice and Password Generation phases, partici-
pants used the following 5-step process for each of their accounts.
1. Create. Participants created a password for the given account.
Those in the Text condition had an 8-character minimum and had to
enter their password twice (see Figure 8). The text passwords were
visible during password creation. Those in the PassPoints condition
were required to click on 5 different click-points on the provided
image (see Figure 9). The selected click-points were never made
visible to participants at any time during the study.
2. Conﬁrm. Participants conﬁrmed their password. For text
passwords, participants entered their password, now echoed only
as asterisks. PassPoints participants had to enter their password by
clicking on the same 5 ordered click-points, within a 19x19 pixel
tolerance area of the original click-points. If participants could not
remember their password, they could return to the Create step.
3. Answer Questions. Participants responded to two 10-point
Likert-scale questions about the perceived difﬁculty of creating and
remembering the current password.
4. Perform Distraction Task. A 30-second distraction task was
used to simulate a longer passage of time [19]. Participants in the
Text condition counted backwards by 3s from a random 4-digit
number, while participants in the PassPoints condition completed
a Mental Rotations Test (MRT) puzzle [28]. Different tasks were
used to clear textual working memory and visual working memory.
503Participants could re-try as many times as necessary to recall their
password or decide that they had forgotten it. At the end of the
session, participants completed a short paper questionnaire.
4. RESULTS
As is the standard approach in analyzing data from user studies,
we used various statistical tests to assess whether differences in the
data reﬂect actual differences between conditions or whether these
may have occurred by chance. Three types of statistical tests for
signiﬁcance were used in the present analysis, each intended to de-
termine whether the groups being analyzed were distinct from each
other with respect to the factor being tested. We used t-tests to com-
pare variance of the means between two groups, Mann-Whitney
tests to compare ordered categorical data (e.g., Likert scale responses,
where the choices are discrete and ordered, but it cannot be as-
sumed that participants view all pairs of adjacent levels as equidis-
tant), and Chi-square (χ2) tests to compare non-ordered categorical
or nominal data (e.g., comparing login success/fail ratios). In all
cases, we regard a value of p  .05).
4.1 Success Rates
We ﬁrst examine success rates as a measure of participants’ per-
formance. The success rate is the number of successful password
entry attempts divided by the total number of attempts, across all
participants. We calculate the success rates speciﬁcally for the ﬁrst
attempt in a given step, after 3 attempts, and then consider all at-
tempts. During Password Generation, participants could conﬁrm
and login with Text and PassPoints passwords equally well (see Ta-
ble 2). There was no statistically signiﬁcant difference in success
rates between conditions for this phase of the study. These results
are similar to previous studies [6, 16] with the same methodology.
Recall-1. During Recall-1, we found a signiﬁcant difference in
success rates between the Text and PassPoints conditions. Partici-
pants in the PassPoints condition were signiﬁcantly more likely to
successfully recall their password than those in the Text condition.
As reported in Table 2, when we consider only the ﬁrst attempt for
each password, participants recalled their text password correctly
only 68% of the time while those in the PassPoints condition had
a 95% success rate. Participants could try recalling their password
as many times as they wished, until they either succeeded or gave
up. Participants in the Text condition reached an 88% success rate
with multiple recall attempts, compared to 99% for PassPoints par-
ticipants. This means that for 12% of trials in the Text condition,
participants eventually said they could not recall their password.
Only 1% of trials in the PassPoints condition ended with such a
failure to recall. Very high success rates in many categories indi-
cate that participants’ memory was not strongly taxed during Ses-
sion 1. However, this makes the much lower success rate for recall
in the Text condition all that more remarkable.
Recall-2. During Recall-2, participants in both conditions had
difﬁculty remembering their passwords (see Table 2), perhaps indi-
cating that this was a more difﬁcult memory task. Two weeks after
creating their passwords, only 70% of Text participants and 57% of
PassPoints participants were able to successfully recall their pass-
words. The differences in success rates between the two conditions
were not statistically signiﬁcant.
We took a closer look at the Recall-2 data to understand where
the difﬁculties arose. We found that male participants were signiﬁ-
cantly more likely to successfully recall their PassPoints passwords
Figure 9: Password creation interface (PassPoints condition).
5. Login. Participants re-entered their password. They could
re-try as many times as necessary to get it correct. If they forgot
their password, they could return to the Create step.
After a short break where participants completed a demographics
questionnaire, they moved on to the Retention phase of the study.
The Retention phase tested whether participants could recall each
of their 6 passwords. The application prompted participants to log
in by displaying the account name and banner along with an entry
ﬁeld for their username and a password entry ﬁeld or an image,
depending on whether participants were in the Text or PassPoints
condition. Participants could re-try as many times as they wished
if they made mistakes, and an additional button was available: “I
don’t remember creating a password for this account”. In fact, we
never asked participants to enter passwords for which they had no
account, but they may have forgotten that they created a password
for a particular account.
In the Retention phase, the accounts were presented in shufﬂed
order based on a Latin square, where each row represented a partic-
ipant and each column represented an account. Pre-testing showed
that one hour was sufﬁcient for the generation and later recall of 6
passwords, therefore we used a 6×6 Latin Square for determining
presentation order during the Retention phase. The Latin square en-
sures that the presentation order of the accounts is balanced across
all participants, avoiding possible bias that might otherwise result
from serial order effects.
To complete Session 1, participants answered a paper question-
naire aimed at gathering their perception of the password system
and their general attitudes towards passwords.
3.1.2 Session 2
Twenty-six participants returned to the lab 12 to 15 days after
their Session 1 to complete the second part of the study. This 2-
week Retention phase followed the same procedure as the initial
Retention phase and accounts were presented in the same order.

than women. As shown in Table 3, 71% of males correctly en-
tered their PassPoints password within 3 attempts as opposed to
only 40% of female participants. This result aligns with psychol-
ogy research which continues to show that males tend to perform
better at visual-spatial tasks, while females generally have better
performance with linguistic tasks [5,23]. Although this gender dif-
ference was not apparent in the success rates for Text passwords,
males were more likely to employ a coping mechanism to help re-
member their text passwords (see Section 4.4).
4.2 Recall Errors
We now focus on the Retention phase and examine the types of
errors committed by participants trying to recall their passwords.
Recall-1. As shown in Table 4, participants had more difﬁculty
recalling text passwords than PassPoints passwords (t(238.47) =
5.428, p < .001) during Recall-1.2
In total, participants in the
Text condition made 173 errors, while participants in the Pass-
Points condition made 17 errors. Participants who were unsuccess-
ful could re-try as many times as they wished, so there could be
many more errors than trials.
Each group committed different types of errors. Participants in
the Text condition appeared to be more affected by interference
from multiple passwords during Session 1. In the Text condition,
20 out of 34 participants made recall errors. They often tried pass-
words from other accounts when asked to recall a password for
a particular account. Many participants cycled through several of
their passwords before reaching the correct one or giving up. In
these cases, they either entered the exact password for another ac-
count, some variant of the exact password, or a variant of a pass-
word for another account. For example one user had “870103zx”
as a password, but repeatedly entered “zx870103’, although even if
entered correctly this password would have been incorrect since it
was for another account (we call these wrong account variants).
A few errors were due to misspelling or variants of the correct
passwords, such as entering “access!ble” when the password was
“@ccessible” or entering “mybnakpwd” instead of “mybankpwd”
(we call these misspelled variants). The types of errors for text
passwords are summarized in Table 5.
As shown in Table 6, over half of the errors in the PassPoints
condition were due to forgetting one or more click-points within
the password. For one trial, the user remembered the pattern of the
password (a straight horizontal line), but thought it was approxi-
mately 15 pixels lower, aligning to a lower linear feature on the
Cars image (Figure 2), and tried to enter it 4 times in this shifted po-
sition. One user knew the correct password but one click-point was
slightly outside of the tolerance region, while another user entered
the correct click-points but in the wrong order. As expected, no

user confused their password from one account for another, since
all passwords were based on different images. In the PassPoints
condition, 8 out of 32 participants made recall errors.
Recall-2. Participants in both conditions made considerably more
errors after the two-week interval. In total, there were 216 Recall-2
errors in the Text condition, which is statistically greater than for
Recall-1 (t(122.39) = 4.61, p < .001). Similarly, the 106 Recall-
2 errors for PassPoints is signiﬁcantly greater than for Recall-1
(t(67.23) = 5.99, p < .001).
Text participants were more likely to re-try entering their pass-
words, making on average 3.14 attempts per account, while Pass-
Points participants made 2.2 attempts on average (t(150) = 2.575,
p < .05) before either successfully entering their password or giv-
ing up. As discussed later, this occurred because participants in the
Text condition were more likely to cycle through their passwords
or variations of their passwords when they did not know the pass-
word for a particular account. The distribution of errors in Tables 5
and 6 show that for Recall-2, participants in both conditions were
more likely to enter passwords that had no relation to any of their
6 account passwords or that were variations of an existing pass-
word than during Recall-1. Interestingly, a common error in the
PassPoints condition was to have some, or all, of the x-coordinates
correct, but have incorrect y-coordinates. This occurred on several
images (not only Cars, as in Recall-1).
4.3 Timings
Table 7 and Figure 103 show the times taken to complete each
password-related step of the study and provide results of t-tests
comparing the times from each condition. These times represent
the total time spent during a given step. For example, the time to
login began when the login screen ﬁrst appeared and continued un-
til the user entered their username and password, then successfully
logged in (including any errors committed).
During Password Generation, there is no consistent relationship
between the two conditions with respect to the amount of time
taken at each step. Participants were faster at creating PassPoints
passwords than text passwords. In contrast, participants were slower
at conﬁrming their password in the PassPoints condition than in the
Text condition. During Login, participants took approximately the
same amount of time to enter their password in both conditions.
Recall-1. During Recall-1, participants were quicker at entering
PassPoints passwords (t(262.64) = 3.93, p < .001). This aligns
with the fact that participants made fewer errors in the PassPoints
condition and hence spent less time repeatedly entering their pass-

Each box indicates the Inter-Quartile Range (IQR - the interval
between the 25th and 75th percentiles) while the dashed lines
(whiskers) represent the ﬁrst and fourth quartiles. The narrowest
part of the box indicates the median time for each phase. The
notches surrounding the median represent the conﬁdence intervals.
If the notches of two boxes do not overlap, then their medians are
signiﬁcantly different from each other at p < .05.
