scanners – Many adversaries monitor instance count on services like VirusTotal for discovery of targeted malware.
• No modifications – Unless you face an imminent threat of losing business-critical data (deletion, encryption, exfiltration), do not start recovery operations until the investigation is complete.• Don’t investigate forever – You must ruthlessly prioritize your investigation efforts (e.g., only perform forensic analysis on hosts that attackers have actually used or modified). In a major incident where an attacker has administrative privileges, it is practically impossible to investigate all potentially compromised resources (which may include all corporate resources).• Share information – Confirm that all investigation teams (including all internal teams and external investigators) are fully sharing their data with each other. 
• Access the Right Expertise – Confirm you integrate people with deep knowledge of the systems into the investigation (internal staff or external entities – like vendors – as needed), not just security generalists.• Legal check – Check with your legal department on whether they plan to involve law enforcement so you can plan investigation and recovery procedures appropriately. 
• Your response capability will be negatively impacted – Plan for 50% of your staff operating at 50% of normal capacity due to situational stress.

Technology – Recovery Phase CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS• Don’t boil the ocean – Limit response scope to confirm recovery operation can be executed within 24 hours or less (plan a weekend to account for contingencies and corrective actions).
• Avoid distractions – Defer long-term security investments like implementing large/complex new security systems or

replacing antimalware solutions until after the recovery operation. Anything that does not have direct and immediate impact on the current recovery operation is a distraction. 
TIPS
• Never reset all passwords at once – Password resets should focus first on known-compromised accounts (from investigation) and potentially administrator/service accounts. If warranted, user passwords should be reset only in a staged/controlled manner.• Consolidate execution of recovery tasks – Unless you face an imminent threat of losing business-critical data, you should plan a consolidated operation to rapidly remediate all compromised resources (hosts, 
accounts, etc.) vs. remediating compromised resources as you find them. Compressing this time window will make it difficult for attack operators to adapt and maintain persistence.• Use Existing Tools – Research and use the capabilities of tools you have already deployed (software deployment, antimalware, etc.) before trying to deploy and learn a new tool during a recovery.• Avoid tipping off adversary – As practical, you should take steps to limit the information available to adversaries about the recovery operation. Adversaries typically have access to all production data and email in a major cybersecurity incident, but in reality, most attackers don’t have time to monitor all your communications. When required, we have successfully used a non-production Office 365 tenant for secure collaboration for members of the incident response team.25
Operations – Investigation Phase CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS
• Stay focused – Confirm you keep the focus on business-critical data, customer impact, and getting ready for remediation. 
• Coordination and role clarity
– Establish distinct roles for 
operations in support of the crisis team and confirm technical, legal and communications teams are keeping each other informed.

• Business perspective – You should always consider the impact on business 	operations by both adversary actions and your response actions. 
TIPSTIPS
• Consider ICS for crisis management – If you don’t have a permanent organization that manages security incidents, we recommend using the ICS as a temporary organizational structure to handle the crisis. 
• The show must go on – Confirm the daily security operations are not completely sidelined to support incident investigations. The normal work still needs to be done.• Avoid wasteful spending – Many major incidents result in organizations purchasing an assortment of expensive security tools in a panic that are never deployed or used. If you can’t deploy and use a tool during the investigation, defer acquisition until after the investigation is finished. Also, consider your ability to hire/train/retain people for any rare or specialized skill sets needed to operate or gain value from the tool.• Access to deep expertise – Confirm you have the ability to escalate questions and issues to deep experts on critical platforms. This may require access to the operating system and application vendor for business-critical systems and enterprise-wide components (desktops, servers, etc.).

Operations– Recovery Phase CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS• Clear Plan and Limited Scope – Work closely with technical teams to build a clear plan with limited scope. While plans may change based on adversary activity or new information, you should work diligently to limit “scope creep” of additional tasks.

• Stakeholder communications – Work with communication teams to provide timely updates and active expectation management for organizational stakeholders.TIPS
• Know your capabilities and know your limits – Managing major security incidents is very challenging, very complex, and new to many professionals in the industry. You should seriously consider bringing in expertise 
from external organizations or professional services if your teams are overwhelmed or aren’t confident in what to do next.• Capture lessons learned – Build and continually improve role-specific handbooks for security operations, even if it’s your first incident without any written procedures.

Communications
Managing communications during a live incident presents unique challenges when compared to other types of crisis that companies can face. What a company knows about the scope of the information lost, how long attackers have been in the system and confirmation that remediation steps weresuccessful in keeping them out of systems, will drastically change over the several weeks it takes to conduct a forensics investigation. As a result, there is a real risk of communicating inaccurate information regarding an incident that can ultimately lead to greater reputational damage for the organization. 
CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORSCRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS
While the fact pattern of each incident will require its own strategy, there are several key principles to keep in mind when making these decisions.
• Focus on actions not outcomes. Early in an incident, focus communications on the actions your company is taking to investigate and remediate the security incident. This often includes steps like notifying law enforcement, hiring forensics experts to help in the investigation and any general steps being taken to remediate the issue. Avoid disclosing numbers or otherwise scoping the incident until there is forensic certainty around these facts.• Keep customers as your north star. In all messages, focus on how you are helping to protect customers versus going into detail about how the incident happened or who was behind it. Often the media will want to know more details about the attack itself or other facts that would help produce a more interesting or sensational story. However, these details often do little to help address customers’ concerns or needs. Focusing on providing actionable guidance is likely to be more helpful to your customers, as well as regulators who are often most interested in how the company is protecting its constituents.• Keep media interactions transactional. The goal during a security incident is to contain news coverage of the event and confirm that the key messages of the company appear in stories. The most effective way to achieve these goals is to provide the media with written statements and only grant media interviews with a spokesperson if necessary. 
2828
• Leverage your owned properties. Creating a single online destination where those interested in an incident can get accurate and updated 
information can help streamline communications. The information posted on this site can include a customer message from company leadership, Q&A we expect customers to ask, as well as links to other resources that may be helpful to customers.OTHER COMMUNICATIONS ACTIONS
Effectively managing communications goes well beyond just sharing the right external messages. Several other actions must also be considered as part of an effective response process. 
• Brief internal audiences. Confirm that any customer-facing employees are briefed about the incident and provided with the appropriate talking points or escalation processes, should they get questions.• Monitor the conversation. Develop crisis-specific traditional and social media monitoring to detect media leaks early in an investigation and then to understand the sentiment once an issue is disclosed. Without a good accounting of the conversation, it’s difficult to make decisions as an incident unfolds.• Consider steps to regain or earn trust. While not always required, it’s important that your company consider if there are steps it should take to regain customer trust after an incident is concluded.

LegalA cybersecurity incident presents a variety of challenges in terms regulatory compliance, statutory and contractual notification obligations, and managing risk of ensuing litigation and regulatory enforcement proceedings and investigations. As a result, legal counsel increasingly plays a critical role in incident response, as well as proactive cybersecurity program development, deployment, and execution.Early engagement of legal counsel to direct an investigation can substantially assist in identifying these obligations and managing legal risk from regulators, plaintiffs, shareholders, and industry groups. 
There are several key principles to keep in mind for compliance with legal obligations, while managing legal risk:• Maintain Confidentiality and Protect Privilege. Legal counsel (internal and/or external) should be positioned to direct the investigation and response efforts, generally in close partnership with the IT security lead, to identify legal obligations and manage risk. With counsel leading the investigation, communications and work product are covered by legal privilege, which adds a significant level of confidentiality protection to the investigation and response efforts. Legal should further retain cybersecurity and communications experts necessary for response, thus covering their work product and communications under the privilege. The privilege creates a “safe place” for responders to facilitate the fact-finding mission and thoughtful discussion regarding risk, without fear that these deliberations will be second-guessed by regulators and plaintiff’s counsel.• Identify Legal Statutory, Contractual, and Other Obligations. Statutory legal obligations are constantly shifting as statutory notification obligations are amended and (re)interpreted, changing the data elements and events that trigger notification obligations, and creating so-called notification safe harbors. Moreover, contractual and industry rules often are broader than statutory obligations and not subject to safe harbors. The decision to notify – as well as what to communicate – is made even more challenging by the reality that forensic investigations are often inconclusive and the evidentiary record imperfect. Consider these judgments carefully in light of changing legal interpretations, as well as accepted and expected practices.30
• Take Care Regarding Post-Breach Actions/Statements. Understanding 	what to say – and what not to say – is critical to managing legal risk. 
Plaintiffs regularly use post-incident actions and communications to 
make arguments about the nature of the incident, the scope of affected individuals, and harm that will keep their suits alive in court. In addition to communications and messaging requiring significant and substantive input from the communications team, all communications and post-breach accommodations to affected individuals should be carefully vetted by legal.• Engage Law Enforcement. Engaging law enforcement is now a key consideration in incident response. Not only is it often an important piece  in the communication narrative, but it is often required depending on industry (for example, certain government contractors) and type of data affected (for example, by major card brands in the case of a credit card breach). Properly facilitated law enforcement engagement can also sometimes be leveraged to delay statutory notifications, gain additional information regarding the incident, and help determine root causes and/or data compromised. Legal should coordinate such outreach, at a minimum, to negotiate and manage the legal process law enforcement uses to gain information for its investigation.• Keep Executives/Board Members Adequately Informed. Increasingly, shareholders and regulators are scrutinizing C-suite and board members involvement in and oversight of cybersecurity incidents. Updates to executives and board members must balance the quality and quantity of information to enable them to carry out their fiduciary responsibilities and exercise business judgment, while avoiding overloading them with technical details.31
