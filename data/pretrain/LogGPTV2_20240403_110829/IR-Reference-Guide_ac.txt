### Scanners and Adversary Monitoring
Many adversaries monitor instance counts on services like VirusTotal to discover targeted malware. 

### No Modifications
Unless you face an imminent threat of losing business-critical data (e.g., deletion, encryption, exfiltration), do not initiate recovery operations until the investigation is complete.

### Prioritize Investigation Efforts
- **Ruthless Prioritization**: Focus your investigation efforts on hosts that attackers have actually used or modified. In a major incident where an attacker has administrative privileges, it is impractical to investigate all potentially compromised resources.
- **Information Sharing**: Ensure that all investigation teams, both internal and external, fully share their data with each other.
- **Expertise Integration**: Include individuals with deep knowledge of the systems in the investigation, whether they are internal staff or external entities such as vendors.

### Legal Considerations
- **Legal Check**: Consult with your legal department to determine if they plan to involve law enforcement, so you can plan investigation and recovery procedures accordingly.

### Staff Capacity
- **Response Capability**: Plan for 50% of your staff operating at 50% of normal capacity due to situational stress.

### Technology – Recovery Phase: Critical Success Factors
- **Limit Scope**: Ensure the response scope is limited to allow recovery operations to be executed within 24 hours or less. Plan for contingencies and corrective actions over a weekend.
- **Avoid Distractions**: Defer long-term security investments, such as implementing large/complex new security systems or replacing antimalware solutions, until after the recovery operation. Focus only on tasks with direct and immediate impact on the current recovery.

### Tips for Recovery
- **Password Resets**: Focus password resets on known-compromised accounts and potentially administrator/service accounts. If necessary, user passwords should be reset in a staged and controlled manner.
- **Consolidate Recovery Tasks**: Plan a consolidated operation to rapidly remediate all compromised resources (hosts, accounts, etc.) rather than remediating them as they are found. This compressed time window makes it difficult for attackers to adapt and maintain persistence.
- **Use Existing Tools**: Leverage the capabilities of tools already deployed (e.g., software deployment, antimalware) before trying to deploy and learn new tools during recovery.
- **Avoid Tipping Off Adversaries**: Limit the information available to adversaries about the recovery operation. Use non-production Office 365 tenants for secure collaboration among the incident response team when required.

### Operations – Investigation Phase: Critical Success Factors
- **Stay Focused**: Keep the focus on business-critical data, customer impact, and preparation for remediation.
- **Coordination and Role Clarity**: Establish distinct roles for operations in support of the crisis team. Ensure that technical, legal, and communications teams are keeping each other informed.
- **Business Perspective**: Consider the impact on business operations from both adversary actions and your response actions.

### Tips for Operations
- **ICS for Crisis Management**: If you don’t have a permanent organization managing security incidents, consider using the Incident Command System (ICS) as a temporary organizational structure.
- **Daily Security Operations**: Ensure that daily security operations are not completely sidelined to support incident investigations. Normal work still needs to be done.
- **Avoid Wasteful Spending**: Many organizations purchase expensive security tools in a panic that are never deployed or used. If you can’t deploy and use a tool during the investigation, defer acquisition until after the investigation is finished.
- **Access to Deep Expertise**: Ensure you can escalate questions and issues to deep experts on critical platforms. This may require access to the operating system and application vendor for business-critical systems and enterprise-wide components.

### Operations – Recovery Phase: Critical Success Factors
- **Clear Plan and Limited Scope**: Work closely with technical teams to build a clear plan with limited scope. While plans may change based on adversary activity or new information, diligently limit "scope creep" of additional tasks.
- **Clear Plan and Ownership**: Designate a clear project lead for the recovery operation to ensure crisp decision-making and good information flow among the crisis team.
- **Stakeholder Communications**: Work with communication teams to provide timely updates and manage expectations for organizational stakeholders.

### Tips for Operations
- **Know Your Capabilities and Limits**: Managing major security incidents is challenging and complex. Consider bringing in expertise from external organizations or professional services if your teams are overwhelmed or lack confidence.
- **Capture Lessons Learned**: Build and continually improve role-specific handbooks for security operations, even if it’s your first incident without any written procedures.

### Communications
Managing communications during a live incident presents unique challenges. The scope of information lost, the duration of the attack, and the success of remediation steps will change over the several weeks of a forensics investigation. Communicating inaccurate information can lead to greater reputational damage.

### Critical Success Factors
- **Focus on Actions, Not Outcomes**: Early in an incident, focus communications on the actions your company is taking to investigate and remediate the security incident. Avoid disclosing numbers or scoping the incident until there is forensic certainty.
- **Customer-Centric Messaging**: Focus on how you are helping to protect customers rather than detailing the incident or who was behind it.
- **Transactional Media Interactions**: Provide the media with written statements and grant interviews with a spokesperson only if necessary.
- **Leverage Owned Properties**: Create a single online destination for accurate and updated information, including a customer message from company leadership, Q&A, and links to other resources.

### Other Communications Actions
- **Brief Internal Audiences**: Ensure customer-facing employees are briefed and provided with appropriate talking points or escalation processes.
- **Monitor the Conversation**: Develop crisis-specific traditional and social media monitoring to detect leaks and understand sentiment.
- **Regain Trust**: Consider steps to regain or earn customer trust after the incident.

### Legal
A cybersecurity incident presents challenges in regulatory compliance, statutory and contractual notification obligations, and managing the risk of litigation and regulatory enforcement. Legal counsel plays a critical role in incident response and proactive cybersecurity program development.

### Key Principles
- **Maintain Confidentiality and Protect Privilege**: Position legal counsel to direct the investigation and response efforts. With counsel leading, communications and work product are covered by legal privilege.
- **Identify Legal Obligations**: Statutory, contractual, and industry rules often change. Carefully consider these judgments in light of changing legal interpretations and accepted practices.
- **Post-Breach Actions/Statements**: Understand what to say and what not to say to manage legal risk. All communications and post-breach accommodations should be vetted by legal.
- **Engage Law Enforcement**: Engaging law enforcement is often required and can sometimes be leveraged to delay statutory notifications and gain additional information.
- **Keep Executives/Board Members Informed**: Updates must balance the quality and quantity of information to enable fiduciary responsibilities and business judgment while avoiding technical overload.
