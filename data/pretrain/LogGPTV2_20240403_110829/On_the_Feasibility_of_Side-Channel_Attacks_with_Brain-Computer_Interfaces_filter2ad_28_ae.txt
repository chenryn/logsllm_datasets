security and privacy implications of this technology.
In this paper, we designed and carried out a number of
experiments which show the feasibility of using a cheap
consumer-level BCI gaming device to partially reveal
private and secret information of the users. In these ex-
periments, a user takes part in classiﬁcation tasks made
of different images (i.e., stimuli). By analyzing the cap-
tured EEG signal, we were able to detect which of the
presented stimuli are related to the user’s private or se-
cret information, like information related to credit cards,
PIN numbers, the persons known to the user, or the user’s
area of residence, etc. The experiments demonstrate that
the information leakage from the user, measured by the
information entropy is 10 %-20 % of the overall informa-
tion, which can increase up to ≈ 43 %.
The simplicity of our experiments suggests the pos-
sibility of more sophisticated attacks. For example, an
uninformed user could be easily engaged into “mind-
games” that camouﬂage the interrogation of the user and
make them more cooperative. Furthermore, with the ever
increasing quality of devices, success rates of attacks will
likely improve. Another crucial issue is that current APIs
available to third-party developers offer full access to the
raw EEG signal. This cannot be easily avoided, since the
complex EEG signal processing is outsourced to the ap-
plication. Consequently, the development of new attacks
can be achieved with relative ease and is only limited by
the attacker’s own creativity.
