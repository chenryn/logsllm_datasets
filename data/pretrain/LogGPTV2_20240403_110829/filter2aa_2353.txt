It’s a Bad Goal
Expectations of heroism drive burnout
Not everyone wants to be torn from their family as a child…
… Forced to live without attachments
Even if they did, many people just don’t qualify

Developers introduce many problems
• Code with security bugs + flaws
• Missing security features
• Unusable security features

“Shift Left”
• Build security in
• Changes to how we/they 
design, develop, deploy 
• Requires new skills
• Less pen testing
• More software 
engineering
• Growing popularity

Shifting Left?
19
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents
Shift left implies: Change the development process
• Demands clear responsibilities
• What exactly is changing?
• Deliverables
• Tasks
• Skills
• Risk: Are we doing this to please appsec?
20
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents
Clarify
Who delivers what to whom?
How?
21
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents
One tool - Bloom’s Taxonomy
• Fundamental 
tool in learning
• Goals + 
evaluations
22
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents
Bloom’s Taxonomy: remember
• Recall facts and basic concepts
• Define, duplicate, list, repeat
• “Remember data sent over a network can be read by anyone”
23
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents
Bloom’s Taxonomy: Evaluate
• Justify a stand or decision
• Argue, defend, judge, select, critique, weigh
• Does encryption protect against that threat?
24
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents
Tools help us use Bloom to define skills + knowledge
The Helpful Hundred – Planning for Instruction
Smaldino, Lowther, and Russell (2008) suggest 100 verbs that highlight performance. Each of these verbs is observable and measurable, making them work quite well i
writing objectives for learning. This is not to say that these 100 verbs are the only ones are can be used effectively; however, they provide a great reference.

Criteria + constraints
• Align to job, aspirations
• Within reasonable training time
• Goals
• Help people find, follow paved roads
• Recognize danger signs

#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents
Chunking is crucial
• Our brains are really, really good at pattern recognition
• Dealing with information in “chunks”
• Short term memory is 7 +/- 2 chunks
• 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,34,55…
• If we don’t define the chunks, our students will
• (They may anyway!)
32
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents
Categories and frames 
• Exploit techniques?
• Threat actors? 
• Compliance?
• Cyberwar?
• Top ten?
• Threats?
33
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents
“What can go wrong”
focuses our attention on
threats
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents
“What can go wrong?” is a powerful framing question
• Everyone has an answer — if you ask and encourage
• Across industries, technical skill, execs
• Variants
• “What keeps you up at night?”
• “How would you attack this”
• Lots of fast, cheap, good approaches 
35
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents
“What can go wrong” is an umbrella
• Open ended is easier to answer, but answers vary a lot
• Structures
• Finance execs … ORX 
• Security … OWASP top ten
• FDA …. inability to update
• Compliance… see my Threat Modeling Compliance (BHAsia ’21)
• Flaws, not just bugs
36
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents
What’s the single best toolset?
• 4 ways of doing something that’s a side task?
• I have to analyze, compare, evaluate?
• Those are expert tasks!
• So people need experts to offer 
specific advice
37
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents
Single best tool need: Personal finance example
• Max out your tax advantaged, matched accounts…
38
50?!?!!
• Target date funds
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents
What’s the target date fund of security knowledge?

#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents
What does every engineer need to know?
• The question’s catalyzed by a couple of projects
• Fast, Cheap + Good: An Unusual Tradeoff (whitepaper)
• Threats: What Every Engineer Should Learn from Star Wars 
• All of which started with a simple question…
Whitepaper available now Shostack.org/whitepapers/ | Book: Wiley, Feb, 2023

#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents
A simple question 
Is every flaw unique?
41
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents
Another simple question 
Do flaws cluster?
What do we need to know to find them?
42
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents
Where are the flaws? (1)
43
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents
Where are the flaws? (2)
44
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents
Maybe they’re lightweight?
45
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents
If lightweight flaws are common,
we should transform 
how we work with 
engineers
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents
What developers need to know: My proposal
• STRIDE threats
• (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Info disclose, DoS, Expansion of Authority)
• Parsing + predictability generate danger
• Kill chains bring these together 
48
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents
What developers need to know (Samples)
• Remember that … 
• Spoofing must be addressed differently for each of 
• [machines, people] authenticating to [machines, people]
• …Spoofing programs is easy unless the platform prevents it
50
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents
Recap
• Code issues underly many (most?) security issues
• Shifting left is an admirable goal
• Only works when we’re clear about change
51
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents
Rebellions are built on hope
• Normal levels of security are defined
• Developers able to build more secure systems
• Less rework, fewer escalations, more predictable delivery
52
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents
Call to action
1. Define expectations: What developers know about threats
2. Help people meet them: Training, assessment
3. Measure impact
