is the relationship between mobility and application usage?
(ii) What is the relationship between users’ location and the
applications they access from there?
3.2.1 Mobility and Applications
To answer the ﬁrst question, we ﬁrst correlate movement
and stationarity exhibited within a session (intra-session)
with application accesses. We obtain the following groups
of packet data sessions: completely stationary, i.e., those
which spend 0 minutes in movement and sessions with vary-
ing levels of mobility. For the latter, we consider Deﬁnition 1
while restricting to only intra-session movement events, and
obtain groups: (xi, xj, w, δ) for δ ranging from [10-60] min-
utes. Recall from deﬁnition that a group (xi, xj, w, δ) con-
tains those sessions which were present at location xi at
some time in the hour window w and then move to xj within
δ time. Hence, by deﬁnition, for the same location pair xi, xj
and hour window w, for δlo < δhi, the following relationship
holds: (xi, xj, w, δlo) ⊂ (xi, xj, w, δhi). Thus, a group with
a higher value of δ contains the sessions from lower δ values
as well as additional sessions which spent larger amount of
time in movement than those considered previously.
We ﬁnd that the top applications accessed by stationary
sessions is social networking, music and e-mail which com-
prise 29%, 21% and 21% of all application accesses respec-
tively. Interestingly, as sessions become more mobile, we ob-
served that users access less music, e.g., in the highly mobile
sessions with δ of 60 minutes, percentage accesses for music
reduces to 9%. On the other hand, as sessions become more
mobile, they comprise of more e-mail accesses.
Mobility span. To explore this issue in more depth, we
explore how does mobility span, i.e., the number of loca-

Figure 4: Application usage breakdown for people
seen in the given number of locations
tions that a user visits, impact the applications he accesses?
Figure 4 shows the application access probability as a func-
tion of discrete mobility spans.
In particular, we explore
groups of users that have been seen at that particular num-
ber of locations during the seven day period. For each of the
points on x-axis, the sum of normalized access probabilities
on y-axis equals to one.
Figure 4 shows high correlation (and anti-correlation) be-
tween the mobility span and applications that people access.
In particular, for the ‘stationary’ users (number of base-
stations seen equals 1), music dominates. We explain this
phenomenon later in the text, in the context of the ‘comfort
zone’ that we introduce later.
In contrast, e-mail shows completely opposite trend. In-
deed, the more stationary users are, the less they access
e-mail on their mobile devices. This is most likely because
they use other devices (e.g., a home computer) to access
e-mail. However, the more people move, the more e-mail
starts dominating the applications. Indeed, for those who
have a large mobility span, e-mail is by far the most ac-
cessed application, more than 50% of time. Indeed, those
who move a lot have their mobile phones as their primary
communication devices.
Finally, social networking shows highly intriguing behav-
ior. It lags far behind the leading applications both within
highly stationary group (lags behind music) and within highly
mobile group (lags behind e-mail). Yet, for the medium mo-
bility span group, for which music starts to fade due to mo-
bility, and e-mail still does not start to dominate fully, social
networking is the leading application.
Weather and maps patterns. Here, we correlate the
inter-session rules with applications as follows. We use Def-
inition 3 to obtain the users who disappear, i.e. switch-oﬀ
their devices for δ time. Next, in Deﬁnitions 1 and 2, we con-
sider only inter-session (and no intra-session) changes and
also restrict the set U to only those users who are accessing
the application being correlated. Thus, given an application
say, maps, we only consider those sessions where the user ac-
cessed an online maps website and then compute the various
inter-session movement and stationary rules with δ values
varying as [1-8] hours to capture varying proportions of those
users. Since, we are only interested in aggregate statistics,
we cluster all the movement and stationarity events that oc-
cur within the same δ value irrespective of the locations and
hours of day involved.
Next, we identify the rule type which captures the max-
imum percentage of accesses to an application type. We
identiﬁed two applications, weather and maps as highly cor-
related with inter-session stationary and movement respec-
tively. First, amongst all accesses to weather applications,

Figure 5: Probability to ‘see’ users at diﬀerent lo-
cation ranks (for users who span 5, 10, 30, and 50
locations during one week)
a majority (69%) of them are grouped as inter-session sta-
tionary with a δ of 6 hours. In other words, after a weather
query, users are not inclined to movement. This directly im-
plies that users are more interested in weather when they are
sedentary for a long time. Second, amongst all accesses to
a maps application, a majority (67%) of them are grouped
by inter-session movement rules with a δ of 3 hours. This
suggests that after accessing a maps website, users typically
switch-oﬀ and move (possibly to the location they looked-
up) and log-on to the network again after 3 hours.
3.2.2 The Role of Locations
Here, our goal is to understand the relationship between
a user’s physical location and the applications he accesses
from there. To answer this question comprehensively, we
answer the following two related questions: (i) What is the
distribution of locations that users visit in terms of time
spent in these locations? (ii) What applications do users
access at these diﬀerent locations?
To answer the ﬁrst question, we proceed as follows. We
ﬁrst ﬁnd the groups of users that have been detected in 5,
10, 30, and 50 locations during one week period. Then, we
rank the locations at which the users reside based on the
time spent in each of the locations.
Figure 5 plots the probability to ‘see’ given users as a
function of the location rank. The key insight from the ﬁgure
is that users spend the vast majority of time in the top three
locations. For example, users who span ﬁve locations (base-
stations) during one week, spend 89.5% of their time in the
top three locations. Likewise, users who visit as many as 50
diﬀerent base-stations during a week, spend more than 55%
of their time in the top three locations. Hence, we call the
top three location ranks as the user ‘comfort zone’ — the
area where they spent the most of their time.
The second question we want to address is what applica-
tions do users access at diﬀerently ranked locations, in par-
ticular with respect to the ‘comfort zone.’ Figure 6 plots the
cumulative distribution functions of the probabilities to ac-
cess the six applications at the given ranked locations. The
vertical line at location rank 3 marks the ‘comfort zone’ bor-
der. Here, we show the statistics for all users, not only the
subgroups we discussed above.
In Figure 6, the higher the curve is, the more the given ap-
plication is accessed within the ‘comfort zone’. For example,
more than 85% of music accesses happen within the ‘com-
fort zone’, while less than 15% outside it. We hypothesize
that because music (and video likewise) is bandwidth and
battery consuming, it is less likely to be accessed outside the

‘comfort zone’. The second interesting result is that dating
applications are mostly accessed from within the ‘comfort
zone’, only 18% outside it. We explain this result later in
the text.
While email, news, and social networking are again more
likely to be accessed within the ‘comfort zone’, they are
accessed much more frequently outside the zone relative to
the other applications. For example, e-mail is accessed 40%
of time outside the ‘comfort zone’, while social networking
is accessed 30% of time outside the ’comfort zone’. Indeed,
it appears that users have the tendency to ‘stay socialized
and connected’ while outside the ‘comfort zone’: they access
social networking sites, they read e-mail, and access news.
Home vs. work. Here, we want to understand which ap-
plications do users access at diﬀerent locations within their
‘comfort zone’. Because both home and work locations are
amongst two of the three top-most locations in the vast ma-
jority of scenarios, our ﬁrst goal is to identify locations cor-
responding to a user’s home and work locations. Then, we
provide insights about the applications accessed at the two
locations.
To identify home and work locations, we proceed as fol-
lows. We consider a location as a user’s home if we observe
the user spending most of his time between 10 PM and 6
AM at this location. Further, in order to identify the most
likely work place of a user, we consider the time interval be-
tween 10 AM in the morning and 12 PM (noon) and the time
interval between 2 PM and 5 PM (during weekdays) and de-
termine the top location that the user has been present at. If
the two locations are the same, we are unable to accurately
distinguish between home vs. workplace. This can happen
either because the user does not work or the user lives and
works within the area covered by the same base-station, etc.
If the two locations are diﬀerent, we assume the one accessed
during night is home and the other is work.
Figure 7 shows the application access statistics. Our ﬁnd-
273ings are the following. First, at home, users are most likely
to access music. This is in-line with our ﬁndings above, as
music dominates among applications accessed in the ‘com-
fort zone’. Moreover, for the group of users for which we
were unable to distinguish home vs. work location as it over-
laps, music is again the leading application (result not shown
in the ﬁgure). Second, at work, users are most likely to ac-
cess e-mail. Third, at both home and work locations, social
networking is the second most popular application. Most in-
terestingly, dating is the least accessed application at both
home and work. However, given that dating is frequently
accessed in the ‘comfort zone’ (see Figure 6), it follows that
it is mostly accessed outside home and work, yet within the
‘comfort zone’. We shed more light on this phenomenon in
the next section.
4. HOTSPOTS
In this section, we study the eﬀects of user movements
on locations and how locations evolve as a result. First,
by following an approach outlined in [26], we identify which
locations have a high net change in userbase at a certain time
and hence become hotspots. After identifying and classifying
hotspots, we then study the interests of the userbase that is
attracted to the hotspot as well as the actual applications
that users access while they are present there.
We use the binary rule Deﬁnitions 1-3 for detection of
hotspots as follows. We consider time windows of one hour
and the change time δ as one hour as well. Let x and h rep-
resent a location and an hour window respectively. Let the
number of users who ﬁrst switched-on their mobile devices
at location x in the hour window h be denoted as: na(x, h).
Next, let nd(x, h) denote the users who log-oﬀ from the net-
work at location x in the hour window h. Finally, let those
who entered the location x within the hour window h from
some other location be denoted as ne(x, h), those that left
it in that hour as nl(x, h) and those that continued staying
there for that hour as ns(x, h).
The number of users entering a location x at a given
hour h can be computed as the total conﬁdence of all the
movement rules which have this location as a target as fol-
lows: ne(x, h) = Py6=x conf (y, x, h, 1). Next, the number
of users leaving a location at a given hour can be com-
puted as the total conﬁdence of all the movement rules
which have this location as the source as follows: nl(x, h) =
Py6=x conf (x, y, h, 1). Next, the number of users that stay
stationary at a location at a given hour is given directly by
the conﬁdence of the stationary rule involving this location
as follows: ns(x, h) = conf (x, x, h, 1). Similarly, the users
who ﬁrst appear or ﬁnally disappear at a location at a given
hour are given directly by the conﬁdence of the appear and
disappear rules respectively as: na(x, h) = conf (∅, x, h, 1)
and nd(x, h) = conf (x, ∅, h, 1).
For each location, the total number of users who were
present in an hour window, N (x, h) can be described by
considering all the exit states of those users, i.e., by count-
ing all the users who disappeared, those who left for some
other location and those who stayed stationary: N (x, h) =
ns(x, h) + nl(x, h) + nd(x, h). Now, for the same location
at the next hour window h + 1, the total number of users is
given by those who stayed back from the past window as well
as those who ﬁrst switched-on their devices at this location
and those who moved from some place else: N (x, h + 1) =
ns(x, h) + na(x, h + 1) + ne(x, h + 1). Thus, the net change
in users at a location across two consecutive hour windows
h and h + 1 is composed of two components, a net in-
ﬂow and net outﬂow and is obtained as inﬂow - outﬂow
or: N (x, h + 1) − N (x, h) = {na(x, h + 1) + ne(x, h + 1)} −
{nl(x, h) + nd(x, h)}.
N(x,h)
Hence, we determine if a location becomes a hotspot at a
certain hour as follows. When the net inﬂow at a location
during a certain hour contributes to the total number of
users at the location at that hour by more than a fraction
γin, then we tag it as a sink, i.e. ne(x,h)+na(x,h)
≥ γin.
Similarly, when the net outﬂow at a location during a certain
hour contributes to the total number of users at the location
at that hour by larger than a fraction γout, then we tag the
location as a source, i.e., nl (x,h)+nd(x,h)
≥ γout. Finally,
when the number of users who stayed at a location within
an hour, ns(x, h) contributes to the total number of users
at the location at that hour by more than a fraction, γs, we
tag it as a stationary location. Note that a location could
be both a source and a sink at the same hour in some cases
e.g., base-stations located next to freeways.
N(x,h)
We select the values of thresholds as the 90%-ile for each
of the fractions across the entire trace duration. Thus, the
threshold γin is chosen as the 90%-ile of the fractional con-
tribution of net inﬂow across all the base-stations over the
entire trace and similarly, for the other two thresholds. This
yields values of γin = 0.7, γout = 0.7 and γs = 0.3.
Next, we use sinks, sources, and stationary locations to
detect hotspots. In addition, we characterize the hotspots
by looking for most likely causes for their creation. In par-
ticular, we use the available geographic (e.g., downtown vs.
suburb) and other properties (e.g., residential vs. business
area) of given areas that we obtain from publicly available
sources. Hence, we characterize the hotspots as follows.
Day hotspots. These locations are sinks during early
morning (8 AM-10 AM), stationary locations during the day
