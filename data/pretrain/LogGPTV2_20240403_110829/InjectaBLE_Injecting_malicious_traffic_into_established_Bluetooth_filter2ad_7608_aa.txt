Abstract—Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is nowadays one of
the most popular wireless communication protocols for Internet
of Things (IoT) devices. As a result, several attacks have targeted
this protocol or its implementations in recent years, illustrating
the growing interest for this technology. However, some major
challenges remain from an offensive perspective, such as injecting
arbitrary frames, hijacking the Slave role or performing a Man-
in-The-Middle in an already established connection. In this paper,
we describe a novel attack called InjectaBLE, allowing to inject
malicious trafﬁc into an existing connection. This attack is highly
critical as the vulnerability exploited is inherent to the BLE
speciﬁcation itself, which means that any BLE connection can
be possibly vulnerable, regardless of the BLE devices involved
in the connection. We describe the theoretical foundations of the
attack, how to implement it in practice, and we explore four
critical attack scenarios allowing to maliciously trigger a speciﬁc
feature of the target device, hijack the Slave and Master role or
to perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack. Finally, we discuss the
impact of this attack and outline some mitigation measures.

I. INTRODUCTION
Nowadays, Internet of Things (IoT) devices are everywhere:
many objects of our daily lives, from fridges to watches, now
incorporate micro-controllers and modems, allowing them to
communicate with their environment and to offer new services.
Several wireless communication protocols have been devel-
oped in recent years to implement these services, among them
the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol. BLE provides a
lightweight protocol stack and allows devices to communicate
easily and reliably with a minimal energy consumption, which
ﬁts perfectly the constraints of connected objects. It is also
widely deployed in smartphones, computers and tablets, en-
abling direct communications without the need for additional
gateways in the network. As a result, many IoT devices already
rely on BLE to communicate with their environment.
The growing interest for this technology also raises le-
gitimate concerns about the security of BLE. In the recent
years, the security of this protocol has been actively studied
both from an offensive and a defensive perspective, high-
lighting serious ﬂaws in its speciﬁcation [5] and in various
implementations. Some papers focused on eavesdropping a
BLE connection, which is not straightforward because of
the use of a channel hopping algorithm, while other papers
described active attacks such as jamming, hijacking or Man-
in-the-Middle attacks. However, to our knowledge, all state
of the art offensive techniques described so far require the
attack to be carried out before the targeted BLE connection is
established, or are based on highly invasive techniques such
as jamming. Even if some papers mentioned a theoretical non
invasive injection-based attack in an established connection
[19] or consider it difﬁcult to achieve [21], it has never been
implemented in practice and the new offensive capabilities
provided by this strategy have not been studied.
In this paper, we demonstrate the practical feasibility of
such attacks, which increases signiﬁcantly the attack surface
of the BLE protocol. We present a novel approach named In-
jectaBLE allowing to perform an arbitrary frame injection into
an already established BLE connection. We ﬁrst explain its
theoretical foundations, and then present various experiments
illustrating its feasibility.
Four critical offensive scenarios that take advantage of this
injection attack are investigated: we show that an attacker
could use our approach to stealthily trigger a speciﬁc feature of
a device, hijack any role involved in the targeted connection or
perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack during the connection. We
demonstrate that most of these scenarios, that were considered
unrealistic until now, are in fact quite easy to perform and
could have serious consequences on the security of any BLE
device compliant to Bluetooth Core Speciﬁcation irrespective
of how it is implemented. We ﬁnally discuss the impact of
this attack and potential mitigation measures.
In summary, the major contributions of the paper are:
• the presentation of a novel injection-based attack into an
already established BLE connection, from its theoretical
foundations to its practical implementation, the objective
being to increase awareness of the vulnerability of this
widely used wireless protocol and the potential threats if
appropriate security measures are not applied.
• a sensitivity analysis, allowing to understand the impact
of three key parameters on the injection success.
• four critical attack scenarios based on the injection at-
tack, allowing to maliciously trigger a speciﬁc feature
of a device, hijack the role of any device involved in
the connection and perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack
during an established connection.

The paper is organised as follows. Section II presents the
state of the art of offensive security targeting the BLE protocol
and clearly outlines the innovative contribution of this work.
Section III presents an overview of the BLE protocol with
a speciﬁc focus on the Link Layer, introducing some key
concepts that are necessary to understand the attack strategy.
Section IV presents an overview of the attack and introduces
the main challenges that must be addressed for this attack to
be successful. Then, Section V describes the theoretical foun-
dations of our attack and its practical implementation. Section
VI shows how this attack can be used in four critical attack
scenarios, while section VII presents a set of experiments
carried out to analyse the impact of three main parameters
regarding the attack success. Section VIII proposes multiple
counter-measures that could be used to mitigate the impact of
our attack or detect it and Section IX concludes the paper.
II. RELATED WORK
In the past few years, multiple attack strategies and tools
targeting the BLE protocol have been released.
Snifﬁng a Bluetooth Low Energy connection is a non-
trivial task, because of the channel hopping algorithm used
by the devices when they are in connected mode. In [19], M.
Ryan demonstrated that a speciﬁc connection can be easily
sniffed if the sniffer successfully receives the packet initiating
the connection which includes the initial channel hopping
parameters. He also showed that an attacker may be able to
retrieve the parameters of an already established connection by
monitoring speciﬁc events. This approach was then improved
by D. Cauquil in [8] to infer the channels to listen to. In
[10], he also adapted the snifﬁng strategy to deal with a new
algorithm based on a pseudo-random generator that has been
introduced in the BLE 5.0 speciﬁcation [5], called channel
selection algorithm #2. Finally, a new tool named Snifﬂe
has also been released [17] by S. Qasim Khan. It provides
interesting features such as support for the new physical layers
introduced in the BLE 5.0 speciﬁcation or a mode allowing
to follow the target device hopping along the advertising
channels. Since these channels are used to broadcast data and
indicate the presence of a speciﬁc device, the probability of a
successful snifﬁng is increased.
Multiple active attacks have also been presented in recent
years. First, jamming-based attacks have been explored by
Brauer et al. in [6], they demonstrated an attack allowing to
selectively jam advertisements. D. Cauquil also presented a
new offensive tool named BTLEJack [9] allowing to disrupt
an existing connection by jamming packets transmitted by one
of the devices involved in a connection, called Slave. The
direct consequence of this jamming strategy is a disconnection
of the other device, named Master, allowing the attacker to
synchronise with the Slave instead of the legitimate device,
resulting in hijacking the Master role during an established
connection. However, this strategy cannot be used to hijack
the Slave role, which could also be relevant from an offensive
perspective, and, being based on a jamming technique, is
highly invasive and visible.
Second, two major tools, GATTacker [15] by S. Jasek and
BTLEJuice [7] by D. Cauquil, can be used to perform a Man-
in-the-Middle attack. GATTacker clones the advertisements
transmitted by the target device (called Peripheral) to indicate
its presence and tries to advertise them faster, forcing the
device initiating the connection (also known as Central) to
connect on a cloned Peripheral controlled by the attacker.
The approach adopted by BTLEJuice directly establishes a
connection with the target Peripheral, forcing it to stop ad-
vertising, then it exposes a cloned Peripheral to the Central.
Both of these strategies are based on advertisements spooﬁng:
as a consequence, they can only perform a Man-in-the-Middle
attack if the connection is not already established.
Multiple studies have also addressed the security of authen-
tication and encryption mechanisms in BLE connections. In
2013, M. Ryan presented CRACKLE [20], a tool exploiting a
weakness in the ﬁrst version of the BLE pairing process to
quickly bruteforce the keys involved in the BLE connected
mode security. In [1], Antonioli et al. introduced an attack
named KNOB (Key Negotiation of Bluetooth), to downgrade
the key entropy from 16 to 7 bytes, which drastically reduces
the attacker’s effort to bruteforce the key. In [2], they also
analysed the Cross-Transport Key Derivation, a mechanism
allowing to share keys between Bluetooth Classic and BLE,
and demonstrated four attacks named BLUR attacks abusing
this feature, allowing to impersonate a device, manipulate
trafﬁc or establish a malicious session. Similarly, Wu et al.
demonstrated BLESA [23], an active attack abusing the recon-
nection process of an already paired Central to impersonate
the corresponding Peripheral and transmit some unencrypted
spoofed data. Von Tschirschnitz et al. presented a method
confusion attack [22] aiming at forcing the pairing of two
devices using different methods. While some of these attacks
can be used to impersonate a device, none of them can hijack
such a device during an established BLE connection.
Previous research have also focused on discovering vul-
nerabilities that are linked to the stack implementation rather
than the protocol speciﬁcation, such as Blueborne [3] in 2017
or BleedingBit [4] in 2018. Also, in [14], Garbelini et al.
presented a fuzzing framework named SweynTooth targeting
various BLE stacks, discovering a dozen of vulnerabilities.
While their consequences are generally severe, they are related
to speciﬁc implementations and cannot be generalised.
Limitations of existing approaches and contribution. As
far as we know, none of the existing research in this ﬁeld
have focused on injecting malicious frames into an existing
connection. In [21], Santos et al. hypothesised it would be
too difﬁcult to set up such an injection-based attack in BLE,
because they considered that dealing with race conditions
is complex and would require high performance hardware.
As a consequence, they rejected the possibility of such an
approach. However, as we will further demonstrate afterwards
and illustrate it experimentally, such an attack is actually
possible, and can even take advantage of the race condition

Santos et al. stated as a limitation to injection-based attacks.
We also demonstrate that this approach can be used to perform
new attack scenarios that haven’t been explored yet, such as
hijacking the Slave role or performing a Man-in-the-Middle
attack during an already established connection.
