User:  Please explain what "virtualization" is and briefly describe the different types of virtualization technologies.
Assistant: Virtualization is a technology that simulates the functions of physical resources such as computers, operating systems, servers, and networks, and creates a virtual environment on top of them to achieve more efficient resource utilization, more flexible deployment, and more simple management. Virtualization technologies are mainly divided into the following categories: 1. Hardware virtualization Hardware virtualization is a technology that virtualizes physical resources of a host computer into multiple virtual machines. This virtualization technology can run multiple operating systems and applications on the same physical machine. Representative technologies of hardware virtualization include VMware, Hyper-V, and the like. 2. Operating system virtualization Operating system virtualization is a virtualization technology that allows multiple operating systems to share the same computer resources. This virtualization technology is usually based on the isolation of the operating system and container technology. Representative operating system virtualization technologies include Docker, LXC, etc. 3. Application virtualization Application virtualization is a method to separate the application environment from the operating system, and then run in a virtualized environment, thus simplifying the deployment and management of the application. Representative application virtualization technologies include Java virtual machine, .NET Framework and so on. 4. Network virtualization Network virtualization is a technology that virtualizes network resources into multiple virtual networks. This virtualization technology can help network administrators manage network resources more efficiently. Representative network virtualization technologies include OpenStack Neutron, OpenVSwitch, etc.
