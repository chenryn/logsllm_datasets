Certainly! Here is a more polished and professional version of your text:

"Confirm the log mode. PacketResponder 1 for block blk_38865049064139660 is terminating."

If you are looking to generalize this message, you can use the following format:

"Confirm the log mode. PacketResponder [ID] for block blk_[BLOCK_ID] is terminating."

This makes the message clear and easily adaptable for different instances.
