### Figure 14: Model Performance on the Training Sample

**Model performance on the training sample, measured by Precision, F1 (left) and ROC AUC (right) at different threshold levels.**

- **Feature Importance:**
  - Among all features related to market movements, return features are generally more important than volume or volatility features.
  - Exchange-specific features, including MinBaseTrade, MinWithdraw, MaxWithdraw, and WithdrawFee, are the least important.

### Figure 18: Estimated Coefficients of Variables with GLM Models

**Figure 18 presents the estimated coefficients of variables using GLM models, which align with the findings from the Random Forest (RF) models. Specifically:**

- **Explanatory Power:**
  - When only one variable is included, `return1h` has the highest explanatory power for predicting a coin's pump likelihood.
  - The positive coefficients of return features imply that higher returns before a pump increase the likelihood of a coin being pumped.
  - The positive coefficient of `pumpedtimes` suggests that coins that have been pumped before are more likely to be pumped again.

**Consistency in Feature Assessment:**
- Both RF and GLM models find that features representing market movement shortly before the pump are more important than longer-term features. This is consistent with our exploratory analysis (Figure 13) and aligns with the findings of Kamps et al. [20]. This suggests the spontaneous nature of admins' coin selection and the importance of real-time market data for strategic traders.

### 5.3 Assessing Prediction Accuracy

**Both the Random Forest (RF) and Generalized Linear Model (GLM) predict the likelihood of a given coin being pumped, ranging between 0 and 1. We apply thresholding to convert these probabilities into binary TRUE/FALSE predictions.**

**Figure 14 depicts the in-sample fitting of model candidates with the training sample as the threshold value changes. The fitting metrics include precision, F1 measure, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC).**

- **Precision:**
  - Precision is the number of true positives divided by the number of predicted positives. The precision line ends when the denominator equals zero, i.e., when no TRUE predictions are produced.
  - Among the three RF models, the threshold value at which the line ends is the lowest for RF1 and the highest for RF3. This indicates that without balanced bootstrapping, RF models tend to systematically underestimate pump likelihood, leading to zero predicted TRUE cases even at low threshold values.
  - Compared to RF models, none of the GLM models achieve high precision.

- **F1 Measure:**
  - RF models outperform GLM models in terms of F1 measure. Among the three RF models, RF1 performs best at a low threshold range (e.g., 0.4), followed by RF2.
  - The superiority of RF models over GLM models is further demonstrated by the ROC curves in Figure 14. All three RF models exhibit high performance with AUC > 0.94, while the GLM models have AUCs between 0.63 and 0.88.

**Due to their inferior performance, GLM models are eliminated from further analysis. Figure 15 illustrates the out-of-sample performance of RF models, showing strong performance across all three indicators (precision, F1, and AUC) on the validation sample. This suggests that the classification model trained and calibrated on one period of data can accurately predict a later period.**

**Figures 14(a) and 15 also indicate that balancing the sample with various TRUE/FALSE ratios only changes the absolute value of the pump likelihood output but not the relative performance. This means that the three RF models can perform similarly in terms of precision and F1 measure when the appropriate threshold value is chosen (specifically, ThresholdRF1 < ThresholdRF2 < ThresholdRF3).**

### 5.4 Testing an Investment Strategy

**To explore the practical utility of the model, we devise a simple investment strategy. At each pump, we check which coin's predicted pump likelihood surpasses a predetermined threshold and purchase those coins before the actual announcement. If no coin's likelihood exceeds the threshold, no pre-purchase is made.**

**Note that if we had the ability to short or use margin trading on the exchanges, more options would open up.**

**Strategy:**
- For each coin we pre-purchase, we buy the coin at the open price one hour before the announcement with an amount of BTC equivalent to k times the vote, where k is a constant. This means the investment, measured in BTC, on each coin is proportional to its predicted pump likelihood.
- We assume that coins that do not get pumped (false positives) will generate a return of zero, while those that get pumped (true positives) will be sold at an elevated price during the pump. To be conservative, we assume that we only obtain half of the pump gain, expressed as:**

\[
\text{Pump Gain} = \frac{\text{High Price} - \text{Open Price}}{\text{Open Price}}
\]

**Figure 16 presents the relationship between the aggregate return and the threshold choice.**

- **Training Sample:**
  - Generally, the higher the threshold, the higher the return, as we buy coins with higher pump likelihoods and disregard others.
  
- **Validation Sample:**
  - As the threshold increases, the return first increases and then decreases. This is because the coins with the highest predicted pump likelihood in the validation sample happen to have very low pump gains. High thresholds lead to high precision but a low number of coins purchased, increasing the risk associated with an undiversified investment portfolio.

### 5.5 Final Test

**Based on the training and validation results, we select one model and an accompanying threshold value to apply to the test sample. Our goal is to maximize the trading profit using the selected model in combination with the proposed trading strategy on a set of out-of-sample data. Therefore, we base our decision primarily on Figure 16(b). We apply RF1 with a threshold of 0.3, the combination that delivers the highest return in Figure 16(b), on our test sample.**

**To determine the investment amount in BTC, we need to examine the market depth, especially for exchanges with low trading volume such as Cryptopia and Yobit. We calculate the average trading volume per pump-and-dump event at Cryptopia, considering only "uptick" transactions where the buyer is the aggressor. This yields a ballpark estimation of the market depth on the buy side. We use this number, 0.37 BTC, as the baseline investment quantity. This baseline amount, discounted by the predicted pump likelihood, would be the investment value in BTC.**

**The return on the investment amounts to 60% (2.61/4.38) over the test sample period of two and a half months. Note that the effect of transaction fees (0.2% on Cryptopia) on the investment profitability is negligible.**

**The result of the final test is very similar to that with both the training sample and the validation sample when the same combination of model (RF1) and threshold (0.3) is applied, confirming the model’s robustness.**

### 5.6 Caveats and Improvement Potential

**Data:**
- Upon availability, order book data, tick-by-tick data before a pump, and traders' account information can be included as features.

**Modeling Method:**
- Random forest with unsupervised anomaly detection has the potential to improve model performance.
- Other classification (e.g., k-NN) and regression (e.g., ridge) models are worth considering.

**Additional Considerations:**
- Investment weights could consider coin price increase potential (based on historical returns) in combination with coin pump likelihood.
- In liquid exchanges, the trading strategy applies only to small retail investments, as large purchase orders prior to a pump can move the market, causing pump organizers to cancel or switch the coin.
- Market risks (e.g., security, legal) associated with the nascent crypto-market must be factored in.

### 6 Related Work

**Over the past year, several studies have researched cryptocurrency pump-and-dump activities, notably Kamps et al. [20], Li et al. [23], and Hamrick et al. [18]. Our work differs in terms of motivation, methodology, data, and contribution. We aim for prospective prediction rather than retrospective investigation of pump-and-dump activities. We use a homogeneous set of data that includes clearly announced pump-and-dump events on Telegram, covering a recent time span from June 17, 2018, to February 26, 2019 (Table 5).**

**Our paper is also related to literature on market manipulation in non-cryptocurrency contexts. Lin [24] explains the potential damage of various manipulation methods, including pump-and-dump, front running, cornering, and mass misinformation, and argues for swift regulatory action against these threats. Austin [3] calls for authorities to demonstrate their ability to effectively deter market manipulation in exchanges for small-capped companies, to restore investor confidence and foster economic growth.**

**Our paper is further related to research on crypto trading. Gandal et al. [17] demonstrate that the unprecedented spike in the USD-BTC exchange rate in late 2013 was possibly caused by price manipulation. Makarov et al. [25] probe arbitrage opportunities in crypto markets. Aune et al. [2] highlight potential manipulation in the blockchain market resulting from the exposure of the footprint of a transaction after its broadcast and before its validation in a blockchain, and propose a cryptographic approach to solve information leakage problems in distributed ledgers.**

**Our paper is also akin to existing literature on cryptocurrencies' market movements. The majority of related literature focuses on understanding and predicting market dynamics, which is crucial for both investors and regulators.**
