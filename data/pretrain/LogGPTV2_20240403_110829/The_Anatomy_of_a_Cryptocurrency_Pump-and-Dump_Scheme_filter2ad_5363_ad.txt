F1 (left) and ROC AUC (right) at different threshold levels.
• Among all the features related to market movements,
return features are generally more important than volume
or volatility features.
• Exchange-speciﬁc features including MinBaseTrade,
MinWithdraw, MaxWithdraw, and WithdrawFee are
least important.
Figure 18 presents the estimated coefﬁcients of variables with
GLM models, from which we obtain several ﬁndings in line
with what is indicated by RF models above. Speciﬁcally, we
notice that:
• When only one variable is included, return1h appears
to have the highest explanatory power on coins’ pump
likelihood;
• The positive coefﬁcients of return features imply that
the higher the return a coin shows before the pump, the
more likely the coin is to be pumped;
• The positive coefﬁcient of pumpedtimes implies that
pumped coins are more likely to get pumped again.
The variable assessment performed by RF and GLM is
coherent in that both ﬁnd features representing market move-
ment shortly before the pump to be more important than
longer-term features. This echoes our exploratory analysis
illustrated in Figure 13 and aligns with Kamps et al. [20]. The
ﬁnding suggests the spontaneity of admins’ coin selection,
and the importance for strategic traders to obtain real-time
market data.
5.3 Assessing Prediction Accuracy
Both the random forest model and GML predict whether a
given coin will be pumped as a likelihood ranging between 0
and 1. We apply thresholding to get a binary TRUE/FALSE
answer.
Figure 14 depicts the in-sample ﬁtting of model candidates
with the training sample as the threshold value changes. The
ﬁtting measurements include precision, the F1 measure and
area under ROC (Receiver operating characteristic) curve.
Figure 14(a) describes the performance of RF models and
Figure 14(b) GLM models.
Precision represents the number of true positive divided
by number of predicted positive, and the precision line ends
when the denominator equals zero, i.e. when no TRUE pre-
diction is produced. Figure 14 shows that, among the three
RF models, the threshold value at which the line ends is the
lowest with RF1, and highest with RF3. This indicates that
absent balanced bootstrapping, an RF model tends to sys-
tematically underestimate pump likelihood, leading to zero
predicted TRUE cases even when the threshold value is small.
Compared to RF models, none of the GLM models is able
to produce high precision.
In terms of F1 measure, RF models again appear superior to
GLM models. Among the three RF models, the RF1 performs
best at a low threshold range ( 0.4). RF2 resides in between.
The RF models’ superiority to GLM models is further
demonstrated by the ROC (Receiver operating characteris-
tic) curve in Figure 14. Among the three RF models, no
discernible difference can be found in terms of ROC AUC:
all exhibit high performance with AUC > 0.94. The GLM
models, in contrast, render an AUC between 0.63 and 0.88.
Due to their obvious inferiority, we eliminate GLM models
from further analysis. Figure 15 illustrates the out-of-sample
performance of RF models. The model performance with
the validation sample resembles that of the training sample,
remaining strong with regard to all three indicators (precision,
F1 and AUC). This suggests that the classiﬁcation model
trained and calibrated on one period of data can accurately
predict a later period.
Both Figure 14(a) and Figure 15 suggest that balancing the
sample with various TRUE/FALSE ratios only changes the ab-
solute value of the pump likelihood output, but not the relative
one. This means the three RF models can perform similarly
in terms of Precision and F1 measure, when the appropriate
threshold value is chosen in correspondence with the model
(speciﬁcally, TresholdRF1 < TresholdRF2 < TresholdRF3).
5.4 Testing an Investment Strategy
To explore the model’s practical utility, we devise a simple
investment strategy. At each pump, we check which coin’s
predicted pump likelihood surpasses a predetermined thresh-
old, and we purchase all those coins before the actual coin
announcement (if no coin’s vote exceeds the threshold, we
will not pre-purchase any coin). Note that if we had the abil-
ity to short or use margin trading on the exchanges we use,

low gain are included in the investment portfolio, resulting in
a low overall return.
As already mentioned at the end of Section 5.3, every model
has its own optimal threshold value. In terms of the magnitude
of the proﬁt, with the right combination of threshold and
model, investors would theoretically enjoy a return of 140%
with the training sample cases (RF1 with threshold of 0.7),
and a return of 80% with the validation sample cases (RF1
with threshold of 0.3).
One should be mindful that if the threshold is set too high
(e.g., greater than 0.8), then the investor might end up not buy-
ing any coins, and consequently gaining no proﬁt. In addition,
although high threshold comes with high precision, it also
leads to a low number of coins being purchased, increasing
the risk associated with an undiversiﬁed investment portfolio,
as demonstrated in Figure 16(b).
5.5 Final Test
Based on the training and validation results of speciﬁed mod-
els, we need to select one model and an accompanying thresh-
old value to apply to the test sample. Our ultimate goal to
maximize the trading proﬁt using the selected model in com-
bination with the proposed trading strategy on a set of out-
of-sample data. Therefore, we base our decision primarily on
Figure 16(b). We apply RF1 and a threshold of 0.3 — the
combination that delivers the highest return in Figure 16(b) —
on our test sample.
To determine the investment amount in BTC for our trading
strategy, we need to examine the market depth. This is partic-
ularly important for exchanges with low trading volume such
as Cryptopia and Yobit. When trading in those exchanges, it
has to be ensured that during the pump-and-dump, the market
would provide sufﬁcient depth for us to liquidate the coins
purchased prior to the pump. For example, if the total trading
volume in one event is 0.4 BTC, it would make no sense to
spend 0.8 BTC on the coin.
To this end, we calculate the average trading volume per
pump-and-dump at Cryptopia. We only consider “uptick”
transactions, i.e. where the buyer is the aggressor. This yields
a ballpark estimation of the market depth on the buy side.
We use this number, 0.37 BTC, as the baseline investment
quantity. This baseline amount, discounted by the predicted
pump likelihood, would be the investment value in BTC.

potentially more options would open up for us.
Strategy: Speciﬁcally, for each coin that we pre-purchase,
we buy the coin at the open price one hour before the coin
announcement with the amount of BTC equivalent to k times
the vote where k is a constant. That is to say, with all the
coins we purchase, the investment, measured in BTC, on each
coin is proportionate to its vote supplied by the random for-
est model. This is logical because a higher vote implies a
higher likelihood of being pumped, and thus worth a higher
investment.
We further assume that among all the coins we purchased,
those coins that do not get pumped (false positive, “false
alarms”) will generate a return of zero, i.e. their price will
remain at the same level as the purchase price; those coins that
get pumped (true positive, “hits”) will be sold at an elevated
price during the pump. To be conservative, we assume that
with each purchased coin that gets pumped we only obtain
half of the pump gain, expressed as:

Figure 16(a) illustrates the performance of the trading strat-
egy with the training sample. The ﬁgure shows that, in gen-
eral, the higher the threshold, which means we buy coins with
higher pump likelihoods and disregard others, the higher the
return.
Figure 16(b) illustrates the performance of the trading strat-
egy with the validation sample. As the threshold increases,
the return ﬁrst increases and then decreases. This is because
the coins with the highest predicted pump likelihood in the
validation sample happen to have very low pump gain. When
the threshold is high, only those coins with high likelihood but

Table 4: Purchased coins based on pump likelihood predicted by RF1. Only
coins with predicted pump likelihood of greater than 0.3 are purchased.
Investment weight equals pump likelihood. Q = 0.37, the average of total
transaction volume in a pump-and-dump event in Cryptopia. Only transaction
volume where the buyer is the aggressor is considered.
Table 3 displays the confusion matrix of the model pre-
diction with the test sample. The model suggests us to pur-
chase 9 coins in total, all of which are ultimately pumped.
Table 4 lists those 9 coins, their respective investment weight
and assumed proﬁt. The return on the investment amounts
to 60% (2.61/4.38) over the test sample period of two and
a half months. Note that the effect of transaction fees (0.2%
on Cryptopia) on the investment proﬁtability is negligible.
The result of the ﬁnal test is very similar to that with both
the training sample and the validation sample when the same
combination of model (RF1) and threshold (0.3) is applied
(Figure 16), conﬁrming the model’s robustness.
5.6 Caveats and Improvement Potential
Data: Upon availability, order book data, tick-by-tick data
before a pump and traders’ account information can also be
included as features.
Modelling method: Random forest with unsupervised
anomaly detection has the potential to improve the model
performance. In addition, other classiﬁcation (e.g. k-NN) and
regression (e.g. ridge) models are worth considering.
Additional considerations: Regarding investment weights,
one may consider coin price increase potential (based on e.g.
historical returns) in combination with coin pump likelihood.
One must beware that in liquid exchanges, the trading strategy
only applies to small retail investment, since big purchase
orders prior to a pump can move the market, such that pump
organizers may cancel the pump or switch the coin last-minute.
Also worth factoring in is the market risk (e.g. security risk,
legal risk) associated with the nascent crypto-market.
6 Related Work
Over the past year, a handful of studies researching cryptocur-
rency pump-and-dump activities have been conducted, no-
tably Kamps et al. [20] , Li et al. [23] and Hamrick et al. [18].
Our work differs from the aforementioned studies in terms of
motivation, methodology, data, and contribution. We aim for
prospective prediction as opposed to retrospective investiga-
tion of pump-and-dump activities. We use a homogeneous set
of data that only includes clearly announced pump-and-dump
events on Telegram.22 Regarding the sample period, our data
cover a recent time span of June 17, 2018 to February 26, 2019
(Table 5).
Our paper is also closely linked to literature on market ma-
nipulation in non-cryptocurrency contexts. Lin [24] explains
potential damage of various manipulation methods including
pump-and-dump, front running, cornering and mass misinfor-
mation, and argues for swift regulatory action against those
threats. Austin [3] calls for authorities’ demonstration of their
ability to effectively deter market manipulation such as pump-
and-dump in exchanges for small-capped companies, in order
to recover investors’ conﬁdence in trading in those markets,
which would consequently foster economic growth.
Our paper is further related to research on crypto trading.
Gandal et al. [17] demonstrate that the unprecedented spike in
the USD-BTC exchange rate in late 2013 was possibly caused
by price manipulation. Makarov et al. [25] probe arbitrage
opportunities in crypto markets. Aune et al. [2] highlight po-
tential manipulation in the blockchain market resulting from
the exposure of the footprint of a transaction after its broad-
cast and before its validation in a blockchain, and proposes a
cryptographic approach for solving the information leakage
problems in distributed ledgers.
Our paper is also akin to existing literature on cryptocur-
rencies’ market movements. The majority of related literature
