## ℹ Computer information

## 📝 Provide detailed reproduction steps (if any)
  1. Have a (relatively) new windows, where powertoys was never installed before
  2. Download exe from github
  3. Click install as normal user
  4. Wait very, very long - the install never finishes.
### ✔️ Expected result
Have a quick install experience, with powertoys being available after the
install.
### ❌ Actual result
A very slow install notification in the message pane (or whatever its called),
which finally will stall at 99%.
## Workaround
Fix this by installing 0.21.1 first, and then upgrade from there
