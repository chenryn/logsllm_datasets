ABSTRACT
This paper studies an active underground economy which special-
izes in the commoditization of activities such as credit card fraud,
identity theft, spamming, phishing, online credential theft, and the
sale of compromised hosts. Using a seven month trace of logs col-
lected from an active underground market operating on public In-
ternet chat networks, we measure how the shift from “hacking for
fun” to “hacking for proﬁt” has given birth to a societal substrate
mature enough to steal wealth into the millions of dollars in less
than one year.

INTRODUCTION
Computer security is a ﬁeld that lives in co-dependence with an
adversary. The motivation for security research is ever to stymie
the goals of some hypothetical miscreant determined to violate one
of our security policies. Typically, we abstract away their motiva-
tions and consider the adversary solely in terms of their capabilities.
There is good reason for this since the threat model for any security
mechanism is generally driven entirely by the adversary’s abilities.
Moreover, reasoning about any individual’s state of mind, let alone
predicting their behavior, is inherently prone to error. That said, the
nature of Internet-based threats has changed over the last decade in
ways that make it compelling to attempt a better understanding of
today’s adversaries and the mechanisms by which they are driven.
First and foremost among these changes is the widespread ob-
servation that Internet-based criminal activity has been transformed
from a reputation economy (i.e., receiving “street cred” for defac-
ing Web sites or authoring viruses) to a cash economy (e.g., via
SPAM, phishing, DDoS extortion, etc). Indeed, even legal activ-
ities such as vulnerability research has been pulled by the grav-
ity of a cash economy and today new vulnerabilities are routinely
bought and sold by public companies and underground organiza-
tions alike [12]. Thus, there is a large fraction of Internet-based
crime that is now fundamentally proﬁt driven and can be modeled
roughly as rational behavior. Second, and more importantly, the
nature of this activity has expanded and evolved to the point where
it exceeds the capacity of a closed group. In fact, there is an ac-
tive and diverse on-line market economy that trades in illicit digital
goods and services in the support of criminal activities. Thus, while
any individual miscreant may be difﬁcult to analyze, analyzing the
overall market behavior and the forces acting on it is far more fea-
sible.
This paper is a ﬁrst exploration into measuring and analyzing this
market economy. Using a dataset collected over 7 months and com-
prising over 13 million messages, we document a large illicit mar-
ket, categorize the participants and explore the goods and services
offered. It is our belief that better understanding the underground
market will offer insight into measuring threats, how to prioritize
defenses and, ultimately, may identify vulnerabilities in the under-
ground economy itself.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview
of the market being studied. Section 3 is an analysis of relevant
issues including market signiﬁcance, participation, and services.
Section 4 measures the advertisements seen in the market and pro-
vides price data. Section 5 discusses applications of our measure-
ments and countermeasures to disrupt the market. Sections 6 and 7
present related work and our conclusions.

The market studied in this paper is a public channel commonly
found on Internet Relay Chat (IRC) networks. It provides buyers
and sellers with a meeting place to buy, sell, and trade goods and
services in support of activities such as credit card fraud, identity
theft, spamming, phishing, online credential theft, and the sale of
compromised hosts, among others.
2.1 IRC Background
Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is a standard protocol for real-time
message exchange over the Internet [13]. IRC employs a client-
server model where clients connect to an IRC server which may
peer with other servers to form an IRC network.
To connect to an IRC network, an IRC client ﬁrst looks up the
address of a server belonging to the network then connects to the
network by way of the server. After connecting, the client identi-
ﬁes itself with an IRC nickname (nick) which can be registered by
assigning a password. To begin communicating, a client typically
queries the network for the list of all named communication areas
known as channels.
After joining a named channel, a client can send both public
(one-to-many) and private (one-to-one) messages. Public messages
are broadcast to all clients connected to the channel. Private mes-
sages are transmitted from the source client to the destination client
without being displayed in the channel. Private messages pass
through any intermediate IRC servers between the source and des-
tination, but are not available to the other clients connected to the
channel including the channel administrators, called channel oper-
ators.
2.2 Data Collection
Our dataset is comprised of 2.4GBs of Internet Relay Chat (IRC)
logs archived over a 7 month period ranging from January to Au-
gust of 2006. The logs were collected by connecting to a particular
channel on different IRC networks and logging all subsequent pub-
lic messages. Each log is of the format: (timestamp, IRC server
IP address, source identiﬁer, channel name, message). The dataset
contains over 13 million messages from a total of more than one
hundred thousand distinct nicks.
The IRC channels monitored were simultaneously active on a
number of independent IRC networks. Each network provides a
separate channel which may include over three hundred partici-
pants at any time. While the channels on each network are separate,
the predominance of certain types of common activities establish
uniformity across networks and create a market.
2.3 Market Administration
Channel administrators are responsible for the well-being of the
market including maintaining a list of veriﬁed participants, enforc-
ing client identiﬁcation policies, and running an automated channel
service bot.
Veriﬁed Participants. A culture of dishonesty and distrust per-
vades the market making it necessary to differentiate trustworthy
individuals from dishonest “rippers,” individuals who conduct fraud-
ulent transactions. To facilitate honest transactions, channel ad-
ministrators provide a participant veriﬁcation service. After a nick
demonstrates their trustworthiness, they are given a special desig-
nation, +v (the IRC ’voice’ attribute), as a seal of approval from
the channel’s administrators.
Channel administrators continuously remind buyers and sellers
to only undertake transactions with other veriﬁed participants. Chan-
nel participants look for the +v designation to determine the level
of care to take when dealing with a particular nick. Many par-
ticipants only undertake transactions with other veriﬁed nicks or
require unveriﬁed participants to complete their end of the transac-
tion ﬁrst to ensure the unveriﬁed participant upholds their end of
the deal.
Client Identiﬁcation. Each line of data in the corpus contains a
source identiﬁer for the client who sent the message to the chan-
nel. The source identiﬁer contains three ﬁelds: an IRC nick, a
client username or Ident [10] response, and a host identiﬁer such
as an IP address or hostname. The nick and host identiﬁer ﬁelds
are used in the market for client identiﬁcation. Upon connecting to
an IRC server, a client’s IP address may be checked against a local,
block list used to prevent access from unruly IPs or to prevent client
access from anonymization services. A client’s IRC nick may be
checked against a local database of previously registered names. If
the client’s nick was previously registered, a password is required to
use the nick. Otherwise, the client may proceed as an unregistered
user or register their nick by assigning a password. Registration is
a necessary, ﬁrst step for clients who wish to build business rela-
tionships or sometimes even post to a channel. Finally, the market
administrators maintain a list of registered nicks which belong to
veriﬁed participants.
Channel Services. Most networks include one or more auto-
mated channel service bots which provide a myriad of interactive
services including credit card limit lookups, credit card validation
code (CVV2) lookups, listing IP addresses of open proxies, re-
turning e-merchants who perform limited credit card authorization
checks, and tracking the time a nick was last active.
2.4 Market Activity
The majority of the public messages in the market can be broadly
categorized into two types: advertisements and sensitive data.
Advertisements. The most common behavior in the market is the
posting of want and sales ads for illicit digital goods and services.
Goods range from compromised machines to mass email lists for
spamming. Services range from electronically transferring funds
out of bank accounts to spamming and phishing for hire. Table 1
includes actual ads seen in the market and their meanings.
The goods and services advertised are sold to miscreants who
perform various forms of e-crime including ﬁnancial fraud, phish-
ing, and spamming. For example, a miscreant, intent on phish-
ing, can enter the market and buy the goods necessary to launch
a targeted phishing campaign:
targeted email addresses derived
from web crawling or compromised databases, mailers installed on
compromised hosts or web forms vulnerable to email injection at-
tacks [1], compromised machines to host the phishing “scam” page,
and software which promises to bypass spam ﬁlters. Similarly, a
miscreant, intent on committing ﬁnancial fraud, can enter the mar-
ket and purchase credentials such as bank logins and passwords,
PayPal accounts, credit cards, and social security numbers (SSNs).
After purchasing credentials, the fraudster may employ the services
of a “cashier,” a miscreant who specializes in the conversion of ﬁ-
nancial credentials into funds. To perform their task, the cashiers
may work with a “conﬁrmer,” a miscreant who poses as the sender
in a money transfer using a stolen account. After each miscreant
performs their task, the fraudster’s transaction is complete and the
supporting miscreants typically accept their payment through an
online currency such as E-Gold or an ofﬂine source such as West-
ern Union money transfer.
Sensitive Data. The second most common behavior in the market
is pasting sensitive data to the channel. For example, it is common
to see miscreants post sensitive data such as the following credit
card and identity information:
Advertisement
i have boa wells and barclays bank logins....
have hacked hosts, mail lists, php mailer send to all inbox
i need 1 mastercard i give 1 linux hacked root
i have veriﬁed paypal accounts with good balance...and i can cashout paypals
Classiﬁcation Label(s)
Bank Login Sale Ad
Hacked Host Sale Ad, Mailing List Sale Ad, Mailer Sale Ad
Credit Card Want Ad, Hacked Host Sale Ad
PayPal Sale Ad, Cashier Service Ad
Table 1: Advertisements with labels used for classiﬁcation.

Card Number: 4123 4567 8901 2345
Exp: 10/09
SSN: 123-45-6789
CVV: 123
Sensitive data posted to the channel may or may not include suf-
ﬁcient information to make it immediately useful to other channel
members. In the credit card information example, other channel
members could begin using Phil’s card or steal his identity. Other
times, sensitive data may be posted to the channel as a way to
demonstrate the existence of a valuable commodity such as access
to a ﬁnancial account without giving the commodity away. For ex-
ample, miscreants post partial account numbers along with their
balances as a form of sales ad.
CHECKING 123-456-XXXX $51,337.31
SAVINGS 987-654-XXXX $75,299.64
Sensitive data may be either explicitly labeled as in the previous
examples or posted without a label. When explicitly ﬂagged, a mis-
creant intentionally appends a label to the data before posting to the
channel. This label helps to identify the data type and disambiguate
ﬁelds. However not all sensitive data is labeled. Often miscreants
simply paste sensitive data under the assumption that ﬁelds such as
names, addresses, and phone numbers are implicitly recognizable.
Since relying on labels would limit the extent to which data could
be measured, the measurements in this paper use pattern matches
for structured data such as credit cards and social security numbers
and random sampling in conjunction with manual labeling for free
form data such as names, addresses, and usernames and passwords.
2.5 Measurement Methodology
This paper contains three classes of measurements: manual, syn-
tactic, and semantic. The primary differences between classes are
the techniques used and their level of accuracy.
Manual Measurements. We hand labeled a 3,789 line dataset
selected uniformly at random from the corpus with several dozen
labels describing the goods and services advertised and sensitive
data in each message. Labels describing ads include the good or
service being advertised and the type of advertisement (want or
sale). Labels describing sensitive data signify the data type (e.g.,
credit card number, CVV2, SSN, etc.). Table 1 includes real ads
with their corresponding category labels. Throughout the remain-
der of the paper, references to labeled data or the labeled dataset
are meant to denote this manually labeled data.
Syntactic Measurements.
Syntactic measurements use pattern
matches in the form of regular expressions and achieve a high de-
gree of accuracy. When necessary, both matches and mismatches
are measured. Other measurements which fall into this category in-
clude the use of the Luhn algorithm to verify credit card numbers,
IP address lookups on DNS blacklists, and social security number
lookups in a Social Security Administration database.
Semantic Measurements. Semantic measurements make use of
supervised machine learning techniques to classify text into more
than sixty categories with associated meanings. To automatically
classify ads such as those in Table 1, we use statistical machine
learning classiﬁers to label each line with an associated meaning.
In particular, we employ linear support vector machines (SVMs)
with bag-of-words feature vectors, term frequency-inverse docu-
ment frequency (TFIDF) feature representation, and an L2-norm
as implemented in the SV Mlight package [9]. Similar approaches
have been used in the past for accurate and scalable classiﬁcation
of large text corpora [5, 20].
We split the labeled dataset chronologically, the ﬁrst 70% was
used as a training set and the remaining 30% as a test set. We
trained a binary SVM classiﬁer for each of our categories. We per-
formed ofﬂine classiﬁcation of the 13 million unlabeled messages
to identify ads throughout the monitored period. Measurements
made with the SVM classiﬁers contain both false positives and false
negatives and are accompanied by performance statistics from the
test set.
2.6 Complexities and Limitations
Several limitations and complexities underlie the measurements
and analysis in this paper.
Market Visibility. The dataset used in this paper does not contain
private messages between participants. Private messages contain
the majority of transaction details. The measurements in this paper
include public messages and ads sent to every client in the channel.
Assertions versus Intentions. Assertions do not necessarily rep-
resent the underlying intentions of a market participant. For ex-
ample, a seller may advertise social security numbers for sale with
the intention of tricking unsuspecting buyers into paying before re-
ceiving SSNs. The measurements in this paper use aggregation and
statistical analysis to minimize the effect of dishonest advertising.
Monitored Individuals Biasing Analysis.
Individuals who know
they are being monitored may change their behavior resulting in
skewed measurements. The anonymity provided by proxies and the
market’s focus on illegal activities makes such behavior unlikely.
3. MARKET ANALYSIS
We begin our analysis of the underground market by asking a
necessary preliminary question: “Is the market signiﬁcant?” To
answer this question, we measure the extent to which the market
enables identity theft, credit card fraud, and other illicit activities.
Next, we build a proﬁle of the market’s members by measuring
market participation including activity levels, participant lifetimes,
veriﬁed status; and correlating participant’s IPs with known ex-
ploited IPs, proxies, and IPs which send spam. Finally, we analyze
the services provided by the market’s administrators and discuss
the incentives behind operating an underground market.
3.1 Sensitive Data and Market Signiﬁcance
In order to establish the signiﬁcance of the market being studied,
we present measurements of the sensitive data observed in the open
market. We believe sensitive data is posted to the channel for two
primary reasons: 1) sellers providing samples of useful data such as
credit card data to build credibility or demonstrate that they possess
valid data, and 2) participants submitting sensitive data in queries
to the channel services bot.

Sensitive Data: Measurement Methodology. To determine the
extent to which posting sensitive data pervades the market, we count
the number of messages in the manually-labeled dataset which con-
tain sensitive data including credit card numbers and expiration
dates, addresses, names, Card Veriﬁcation Values (CVV2s), phone
numbers, usernames and passwords, mother’s maiden names, an-
swers to challenge questions, SSNs, bank account numbers, ATM
PINs, driver’s license numbers, and dates of birth. Since we are es-
tablishing an upper bound on the levels of sensitive data, we do not
remove repeated data nor do we verify the validity of the sensitive
data found. Subsequent measurements address the issues of data
repetition and validation.
Sensitive Data: Measurement Results. The percentage of mes-
sages containing various types of sensitive data is shown in Fig-
ure 1. These measurements show that by randomly sampling from
the 13 million line corpus a signiﬁcant amount of sensitive data can
be found. Furthermore, these measurements suggest that the mar-
ket is awash in freely available data of all types. To understand
the magnitude of the sensitive data available, we further measure
the highest percentage sensitive data, credit card numbers, and two
important data types: ﬁnancial account data and SSNs.
3.1.1 Credit Card Data
Credit Card Data: Measurement Methodology. We identify po-
tential credit card numbers by pattern matching numbers which ap-
pear to be properly formatted Visa, Mastercard, American Express,
or Discover cards. To maximize the number of cards identiﬁed, we
use syntactic matches rather than relying on miscreants to explic-
itly ﬂag their posted data. We remove repeated cards and check
that each unique card number has a valid Luhn digit [11]. The
Luhn digit is a checksum value which guards against simple er-
rors in transmission. While passing the Luhn check is a necessary
condition for card validity, it does not guarantee that the card num-
ber has been issued, is active, or has available credit at the time of
posting.
Credit Card Data: Measurement Results.
Including repeats, we
found a total of 974,951 credit card numbers in the corpus. This
represents 7.4% of the total logs which is close to the 7.15% es-
timate established in Section 3.1. Eliminating duplicate values,
there were a total of 100,490 unique credit card numbers. Other
card numbers are present in the corpus, but their representations
include text, delimiters, or other separators which resist simple pat-
tern matches. Hence, the number of cards found can be considered
a conservative estimate. The results of our measurements are sum-
marized in Table 2.

Table 2: Credit card statistics.
To correlate our data with another source, we look up a small
sample of the credit cards with valid Luhn digits in TrustedID’s
StolenIDSearch database of 2,484,411 numbers. TrustedID states
that they receive information, “by looking in places where fraud-
sters typically trade or store this kind of information.” StolenID-
Search provides a query interface for consumers to check if their
identity or credit information may be compromised. Of the 181
cards numbers we queried, 51% were in the TrustedID database as
of August 2007. The high percentage of matches may be the result
of TrustedID monitoring the same servers we monitored. Alterna-
tively, the card numbers may be available in multiple locations.
To understand the possible origins of the credit card data, we
manually survey the data and the ﬂags miscreants use to identity
sensitive data posted to the channel. We found over 1,300 ﬂags
which start with the preﬁx, “AOL”. We believe this preﬁx is meant
