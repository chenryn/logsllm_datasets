User: I'm tracking a linux filesystem (that could be any type) with pyinotify module for python (which is actually the linux kernel behind doing the job). Many directories/folders/files (as much as the user want to) are being tracked with my application and now i would like track the md5sum of each file and store them on a database (includes every moving, renaming, new files, etc).
I guess that a database should be the best option to store all the md5sum of each file... But what should be the best database for that? Certainly a very performatic one. I'm looking for a free one, because the application is gonna be GPL.
Assistant: You could try Redis. It is most certainly fast.
But really, since you're tracking a filesystem, and disks are slow as snails in comparison to even a medium-fast database, performance shouldn't be your primary concern.
