User: How to analyze network traffic to find out whether there is an abnormal situation with excessive throughput? Please provide a practical steps.
Assistant: Network traffic analysis is the process of evaluating network performance and discovering possible problems. The following are the practical steps to find out whether there is an abnormal situation of excessive throughput: 1. Select the appropriate tool: Network traffic analysis requires the use of dedicated tools, you can choose Wireshark, tcpdump and other traffic analysis tools. 2. Obtain traffic data: Collect network traffic data by directly monitoring the network, using hardware or software equipment, or according to the needs of different statistics and storage strategies. It can capture traffic from network devices such as network switches, routers, and servers, and store it locally. 3. Statistical and analytical data: Import the locally stored network data into the selected analysis tool. Try to determine basic statistical parameters of the data, such as maximum, minimum and mean, as well as variance and standard deviation, etc. 4. Confirm the threshold of excessive throughput: Determine a threshold, and the traffic of the entry exceeding this threshold will be marked as abnormal. This threshold should be set according to network capacity and actual conditions. 5. Look for high traffic entries: By analyzing network data, you can identify other anomalies where throughput exceeds thresholds. These anomalies could indicate that traffic is being consumed by unauthorized devices, that attackers are conducting denial-of-service attacks, or that the network is being hit by a rapidly increasing amount of malicious traffic, among other things. 6. Classify exceptions: Classify the found abnormal entries. You can classify throughput anomalies into categories such as attacks, application errors, or structural issues. 7. Solve the problem: After determining the abnormal situation of excessive throughput, you can take appropriate measures to solve the problem, such as adding traffic restrictions, blocking bad IPs, etc. In addition to this, you should record and analyze anomalies and develop countermeasures to ensure that the network is always in a safe state. The above is the actual operation steps of network traffic analysis to find out whether there is an abnormal situation with excessive throughput.
