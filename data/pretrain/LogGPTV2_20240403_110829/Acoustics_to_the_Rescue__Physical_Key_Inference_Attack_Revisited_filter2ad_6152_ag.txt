of options to change the audio quality in these devices, the
doorbells save them in lossy Advanced Audio Coding (or
AAC) format, which further degrades signal quality.
Figure 23: Figure depicts that 79% of keys which lie
above −0.011 cluster distinctness score form the attackable
keyspace for Keynergy. We obtain this threshold score by per-
forming empirical analysis on key insertion of keys k1 − k7.
Appendix F Attackable Keyspace Determina-
tion
Recall from Section 4 that the presence of distinct clusters
is necessary for our acoustic inference attack. In order to de-
termine the set of keys that satisfy this constraint, we plot
a cluster distinctness score that determines the distinctness
of clusters based on the simulated model, for all keys in the
keyspace as shown in Figure 23. We compute cluster distinct-
ness score as the difference between the shortest inter-cluster
duration (i.e., time-interval between clusters) and the longest
intra-cluster duration (time-interval between clicks within a
cluster), where a larger score indicates more distinct clusters.
We observe that about 70% of keys have distinct clusters (i.e.,
score > 0). However, in order to determine if this distinct-
ness holds true for real key insertions, we select seven keys
(k1 − k7) that are outside of the 75 keys in our test set (see Sec-
tion 6.2). We obtain the recordings from three participants for
each key. Of the seven keys, three are above and four below
the zero mark. We observe that k1 − k4 have distinct clusters,
conﬁrming the presence of larger durations between clusters
in real insertion as compared to simulation. Hence, we deter-
mine the keyspace by identifying the point of steepest descent
between keys, k4 and k5, which yields a score threshold of
−0.011 and a keyspace of 59,207 keys (79% of 75,066 keys).
Appendix G Smart Doorbell Analysis
To investigate the possibility of an attacker who can remotely
access a smart doorbell installed on the victim’s door, we test
the attack utility of key insertion audio recorded from multiple
smart doorbell models [15, 44, 57, 58]. Figure 24 depicts the
spectrogram of key insertion from two popular models – Ring
Video Doorbell 3 Plus and Google Nest Hello. From our
analysis, we infer that all the doorbells we investigate are
equipped with low-quality microphones designed for human
voice capture (i.e., having low-frequency response only up
to 8kHz), hence making them unsuitable for capturing ﬁne-
grained click timing information. Furthermore, due to the lack
Appendix H Noise Analysis of Parabolic Mic
In Section 6.4.2, we present the average reduction ratio
(RatioReduction) for Micparab across all keys for distances,
namely 5ft to 25ft. In Figure 25, we depict the RatioReduction
of individual keys at all distances, for two different noise
types – human conversation (noisetalk) and dog barking sound
(noisebark). Similar to the analysis in Section 6.4.2, we ob-
serve low variance in RatioReduction across different noise lev-
els, across all distances. These results illustrate that Keynergy
is robust to low-frequency noise sources.
