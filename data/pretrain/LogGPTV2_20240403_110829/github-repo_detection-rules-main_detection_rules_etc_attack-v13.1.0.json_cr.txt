Certainly! Below are the optimized versions of the provided texts, with a focus on clarity, coherence, and professionalism.

### Stripped Payloads
Adversaries may attempt to make payloads difficult to analyze by removing symbols, strings, and other human-readable information. Scripts and executables often contain variable names and strings that help developers document code functionality. Symbols are typically created by an operating system's `linker` when executable payloads are compiled. Reverse engineers use these symbols and strings to analyze code and identify payload functionality. (Citation: Mandiant golang stripped binaries explanation) (Citation: intezer stripped binaries elf files 2018)

Adversaries may use stripped payloads to make malware analysis more challenging. Compilers and other tools can remove or obfuscate strings and symbols. For example, adversaries have used stripped payload formats, such as run-only AppleScripts, which are compiled and stripped versions of [AppleScript](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/002), to evade detection and analysis. The lack of human-readable information hinders the detection and analysis of payloads. (Citation: SentinelLabs reversing run-only applescripts 2021)

### Component Object Model
Adversaries may use the Windows Component Object Model (COM) for local code execution. COM is an inter-process communication (IPC) component of the native Windows application programming interface (API) that enables interaction between software objects, typically binary Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) or executables (EXEs). (Citation: Fireeye Hunting COM June 2019) Remote COM execution is facilitated by [Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021) such as [Distributed Component Object Model](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/003) (DCOM). (Citation: Fireeye Hunting COM June 2019)

Various COM interfaces can be abused to invoke arbitrary execution via programming languages such as C, C++, Java, and [Visual Basic](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/005). (Citation: Microsoft COM) Specific COM objects can also perform functions beyond code execution, such as creating a [Scheduled Task/Job](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053), fileless download/execution, and other adversary behaviors related to privilege escalation and persistence. (Citation: Fireeye Hunting COM June 2019) (Citation: ProjectZero File Write EoP Apr 2018)

### DLL Search Order Hijacking
Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the search order used to load DLLs. Windows systems use a common method to look for required DLLs to load into a program. (Citation: Microsoft Dynamic Link Library Search Order) (Citation: FireEye Hijacking July 2010) Hijacking DLL loads may be for establishing persistence, elevating privileges, and evading restrictions on file execution.

Adversaries can plant trojan dynamic-link library files (DLLs) in a directory that will be searched before the location of a legitimate library, causing Windows to load their malicious library when requested by the victim program. Adversaries may also perform DLL preloading, also called binary planting attacks, by placing a malicious DLL with the same name as an ambiguously specified DLL in a location that Windows searches before the legitimate DLL. (Citation: OWASP Binary Planting) (Citation: FireEye fxsst June 2011) Remote DLL preloading attacks occur when a program sets its current directory to a remote location such as a Web share before loading a DLL. (Citation: Microsoft Security Advisory 2269637)

Adversaries may also directly modify the search order via DLL redirection, which after being enabled (in the Registry and creation of a redirection file) may cause a program to load a different DLL. (Citation: Microsoft Dynamic-Link Library Redirection) (Citation: Microsoft Manifests) (Citation: FireEye DLL Search Order Hijacking)

If a search order-vulnerable program is configured to run at a higher privilege level, the adversary-controlled DLL that is loaded will also be executed at the higher level. Programs that fall victim to path hijacking may appear to behave normally because malicious DLLs may be configured to also load the legitimate DLLs they were meant to replace.

### Automated Collection
Once established within a system or network, adversaries may use automated techniques for collecting internal data. Methods for performing this technique could include using a [Command and Scripting Interpreter](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059) to search for and copy information fitting set criteria, such as file type, location, or name at specific time intervals. In cloud-based environments, adversaries may also use cloud APIs, command line interfaces, or extract, transform, and load (ETL) services to automatically collect data. This functionality could also be built into remote access tools. (Citation: MITRE ATT&CK)

This technique may incorporate other techniques such as [File and Directory Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1083) and [Lateral Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1570) to identify and move files, as well as [Cloud Service Dashboard](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1538) and [Cloud Storage Object Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1619) to identify resources in cloud environments.

### Clipboard Data
Adversaries may collect data stored in the clipboard from users copying information within or between applications. On Windows, adversaries can access clipboard data using `clip.exe` or `Get-Clipboard`. (Citation: MSDN Clipboard) (Citation: clip_win_server) (Citation: CISA_AA21_200B) Additionally, adversaries may monitor and replace users' clipboard content with their own data. (Citation: mining_ruby_reversinglabs)

macOS and Linux also have commands, such as `pbpaste`, to grab clipboard contents. (Citation: Operating with EmPyre)

### Proc Filesystem
Adversaries may gather credentials from the proc filesystem or `/proc`. The proc filesystem is a pseudo-filesystem used as an interface to kernel data structures for Linux-based systems managing virtual memory. For each process, the `/proc//maps` file shows how memory is mapped within the process's virtual address space. The `/proc//mem` file, exposed for debugging purposes, provides access to the process's virtual address space. (Citation: Picus Labs Proc cump 2022) (Citation: baeldung Linux proc map 2022)

When executing with root privileges, adversaries can search these memory locations for all processes on a system that contain patterns indicative of credentials, such as fixed strings in memory structures or cached hashes. When running without privileged access, processes can still view their own virtual memory locations. Some services or programs may save credentials in clear text inside the process's memory. (Citation: MimiPenguin GitHub May 2017) (Citation: Polop Linux PrivEsc Gitbook)

If running as or with the permissions of a web browser, a process can search the `/maps` & `/mem` locations for common website credential patterns, in which hashes or cleartext credentials may be located.

### Botnet
Adversaries may buy, lease, or rent a network of compromised systems that can be used during targeting. A botnet is a network of compromised systems that can be instructed to perform coordinated tasks. (Citation: Norton Botnet) Adversaries may purchase a subscription to use an existing botnet from a booter/stresser service. With a botnet at their disposal, adversaries may perform follow-on activities such as large-scale [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566) or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS). (Citation: Imperva DDoS for Hire) (Citation: Krebs-Anna) (Citation: Krebs-Bazaar) (Citation: Krebs-Booter)

### Password Managers
Adversaries may acquire user credentials from third-party password managers. (Citation: ise Password Manager February 2019) Password managers are applications designed to store user credentials, typically in an encrypted database. Credentials are usually accessible after a user provides a master password that unlocks the database. After the database is unlocked, these credentials may be copied to memory. These databases can be stored as files on disk. (Citation: ise Password Manager February 2019)

Adversaries may acquire user credentials from password managers by extracting the master password and/or plain-text credentials from memory. (Citation: FoxIT Wocao December 2019) (Citation: Github KeeThief) Adversaries may extract credentials from memory via [Exploitation for Credential Access](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1212). (Citation: NVD CVE-2019-3610) Adversaries may also try brute forcing via [Password Guessing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110/001) to obtain the master password of a password manager. (Citation: Cyberreason Anchor December 2019)

### AppInit DLLs
Dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) specified in the `AppInit_DLLs` value in the Registry keys `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows` or `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows` are loaded by `user32.dll` into every process that loads `user32.dll`. In practice, this is nearly every program since `user32.dll` is a very common library. (Citation: Elastic Process Injection July 2017) Similar to [Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055), these values can be abused to obtain persistence and privilege escalation by causing a malicious DLL to be loaded and run in the context of separate processes on the computer. (Citation: AppInit Registry)

The `AppInit` DLL functionality is disabled in Windows 8 and later versions when secure boot is enabled. (Citation: AppInit Secure Boot)

### Gatekeeper Bypass
Adversaries may modify file attributes and subvert Gatekeeper functionality to evade user prompts and execute untrusted programs. Gatekeeper is a set of technologies that act as a layer of Apple’s security model to ensure only trusted applications are executed on a host. Gatekeeper was built on top of File Quarantine in Snow Leopard (10.6, 2009) and has grown to include Code Signing, security policy compliance, Notarization, and more. Gatekeeper also treats applications running for the first time differently than reopened applications. (Citation: TheEclecticLightCompany Quarantine and the flag) (Citation: TheEclecticLightCompany apple notarization)

Based on an opt-in system, when files are downloaded, an extended attribute (xattr) called `com.apple.quarantine` (also known as a quarantine flag) can be set on the file by the application performing the download. Launch Services opens the application in a suspended state. For first-run applications with the quarantine flag set, Gatekeeper executes the following functions:

1. **Check Extended Attribute**: Gatekeeper checks for the quarantine flag, then provides an alert prompt to the user to allow or deny execution. (Citation: OceanLotus for OS X) (Citation: 20 macOS Common Tools and Techniques)
2. **Check System Policies**: Gatekeeper checks the system security policy, allowing execution of apps downloaded from either just the App Store or the App Store and identified developers.
3. **Code Signing**: Gatekeeper checks for a valid code signature from an Apple Developer ID.
4. **Notarization**: Using the `api.apple-cloudkit.com` API, Gatekeeper reaches out to Apple servers to verify or pull down the notarization ticket and ensure the ticket is not revoked. Users can override notarization, which will result in a prompt of executing an "unauthorized app" and the security policy will be modified.

Adversaries can subvert one or multiple security controls within Gatekeeper checks through logic errors (e.g., [Exploitation for Defense Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1211)), unchecked file types, and external libraries. For example, prior to macOS 13 Ventura, code signing and notarization checks were only conducted on first launch, allowing adversaries to write malicious executables to previously opened applications to bypass Gatekeeper security checks. (Citation: theevilbit gatekeeper bypass 2021) (Citation: Application Bundle Manipulation Brandon Dalton)

Applications and files loaded onto the system from a USB flash drive, optical disk, external hard drive, from a drive shared over the local network, or using the `curl` command may not set the quarantine flag. Additionally, it is possible to avoid setting the quarantine flag using [Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189).

### Drive-by Target
Adversaries may prepare an operational environment to infect systems that visit a website over the normal course of browsing. Endpoint systems may be compromised through browsing to adversary-controlled sites, as in [Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189). In such cases, the user's web browser is typically targeted for exploitation (often not requiring any extra user interaction once landing on the site), but adversaries may also set up websites for non-exploitation behavior such as [Application Access Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/001). Prior to [Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189), adversaries must stage resources needed to deliver the exploit to users who browse to an adversary-controlled site. Drive-by content can be staged on adversary-controlled infrastructure that has been acquired ([Acquire Infrastructure](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583)) or previously compromised ([Compromise Infrastructure](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584)).

Adversaries may upload or inject malicious web content, such as [JavaScript](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/007), into websites. (Citation: FireEye CFR Watering Hole 2012) (Citation: Gallagher 2015) This may be done in several ways, including:

* Inserting malicious scripts into web pages or other user-controllable web content such as forum posts.
* Modifying script files served to websites from publicly writable cloud storage buckets.
* Crafting malicious web advertisements and purchasing ad space on a website through legitimate ad providers (i.e., [Malvertising](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/008)).

In addition to staging content to exploit a user's web browser, adversaries may also stage scripting content to profile the user's browser (as in [Gather Victim Host Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1592)) to ensure it is vulnerable prior to attempting exploitation. (Citation: ATT ScanBox)

Websites compromised by an adversary and used to stage a drive-by may be ones visited by a specific community, such as government, a particular industry, or region, where the goal is to compromise a specific user or set of users based on a shared interest. This kind of targeted campaign is referred to as a strategic web compromise or watering hole attack.

Adversaries may purchase domains similar to legitimate domains (e.g., homoglyphs, typosquatting, different top-level domain, etc.) during acquisition of infrastructure ([Domains](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/001)) to help facilitate [Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189).

### System Service Discovery
Adversaries may try to gather information about registered local system services. Adversaries may obtain information about services using tools as well as OS utility commands such as `sc query`, `tasklist /svc`, and `systemctl`.

### Network Sniffing
Adversaries may sniff network traffic to capture information about an environment, including authentication material passed over the network. Network sniffing refers to using the network interface on a system to monitor or capture information sent over a wired or wireless connection. An adversary may place a network interface into promiscuous mode to passively access data in transit over the network, or use span ports to capture a larger amount of data.

Data captured via this technique may include user credentials, especially those sent over an insecure, unencrypted protocol. Techniques for name service resolution poisoning, such as [LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/001), can also be used to capture credentials to websites, proxies, and internal systems by redirecting traffic to an adversary.

Network sniffing may also reveal configuration details, such as running services, version numbers, and other network characteristics (e.g., IP addresses, hostnames, VLAN IDs) necessary for subsequent Lateral Movement and/or Defense Evasion activities.

In cloud-based environments, adversaries may still be able to use traffic mirroring services to sniff network traffic from virtual machines. For example, AWS Traffic Mirroring, GCP Packet Mirroring, and Azure vTap allow users to define specified instances to collect traffic from and specified targets to send collected traffic to. (Citation: AWS Traffic Mirroring) (Citation: GCP Packet Mirroring) (Citation: Azure Virtual Network TAP) Often, much of this traffic will be in cleartext due to the use of TLS termination at the load balancer level to reduce the strain of encrypting and decrypting traffic. (Citation: Rhino Security Labs AWS VPC Traffic Mirroring) (Citation: SpecterOps AWS Traffic Mirroring) The adversary can then use exfiltration techniques such as Transfer Data to Cloud Account in order to access the sniffed traffic. (Citation: Rhino Security Labs AWS VPC Traffic Mirroring)

On network devices, adversaries may perform network captures using [Network Device CLI](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/008) commands such as `monitor capture`. (Citation: US-CERT-TA18-106A) (Citation: capture_embedded_packet_on_software)

### Application Deployment Software
Adversaries may deploy malicious software to systems within a network using application deployment systems employed by enterprise administrators. The permissions required for this action vary by system configuration; local credentials may be sufficient with direct access to the deployment server, or specific domain credentials may be required. However, the system may require an administrative account to log in or to perform software deployment.

Access to a network-wide or enterprise-wide software deployment system enables an adversary to have remote code execution on all systems connected to such a system. The access may be used to laterally move to systems, gather information, or cause a specific effect, such as wiping the hard drives on all endpoints.

### Code Signing
Adversaries may create, acquire, or steal code signing materials to sign their malware or tools. Code signing provides a level of authenticity on a binary from the developer and a guarantee that the binary has not been tampered with. (Citation: Wikipedia Code Signing) The certificates used during an operation may be created, acquired, or stolen by the adversary. (Citation: Securelist Digital Certificates) (Citation: Symantec Digital Certificates) Unlike [Invalid Code Signature](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/001), this activity will result in a valid signature.

Code signing to verify software on first run can be used on modern Windows and macOS systems. It is not used on Linux due to the decentralized nature of the platform. (Citation: Wikipedia Code Signing) (Citation: EclecticLightChecksonEXECodeSigning)

Code signing certificates may be used to bypass security policies that require signed code to execute on a system.

### Data from Cloud Storage
Adversaries may access data from improperly secured cloud storage. Many cloud service providers offer solutions for online data object storage, such as Amazon S3, Azure Storage, and Google Cloud Storage. These solutions differ from other storage solutions (such as SQL or Elasticsearch) in that there is no overarching application. Data from these solutions can be retrieved directly using the cloud provider's APIs.

In other cases, SaaS application providers such as Slack, Confluence, and Salesforce also provide cloud storage solutions as a peripheral use case of their platform. These cloud objects can be extracted directly from their associated application. (Citation: EA Hacked via Slack - June 2021) (Citation: SecureWorld - How Secure Is Your Slack Channel - Dec 2021) (Citation: HackerNews - 3 SaaS App Cyber Attacks - April 2022) (Citation: Dark Clouds_Usenix_Mulazzani_08_2011)

Adversaries may collect sensitive data from these cloud storage solutions. Providers typically offer security guides to help end-users configure systems, though misconfigurations are a common problem. (Citation: Amazon S3 Security, 2019) (Citation: Microsoft Azure Storage Security, 2019) (Citation: Google Cloud Storage Best Practices, 2019) There have been numerous incidents where cloud storage has been improperly secured, typically by unintentionally allowing public access to unauthenticated users, overly broad access by all users, or even access for any anonymous person outside the control of the Identity Access Management system without even needing basic user permissions.

This open access may expose various types of sensitive data, such as credit cards, personally identifiable information, or medical records. (Citation: Trend Micro S3 Exposed PII, 2017) (Citation: Wired Magecart S3 Buckets, 2019) (Citation: HIPAA Journal S3 Breach, 2017) (Citation: Rclone-mega-extortion_05_2021)

Adversaries may also obtain and abuse leaked credentials from source repositories, logs, or other means as a way to gain access to cloud storage objects.

### Runtime Data Manipulation
Adversaries may modify systems to manipulate the data as it is accessed and displayed to an end-user, thus threatening the integrity of the data. (Citation: FireEye APT38 Oct 2018) (Citation: DOJ Lazarus Sony 2018) By manipulating runtime data, adversaries may attempt to affect a business process, organizational understanding, and decision-making.

Adversaries may alter application binaries used to display data in order to cause runtime manipulations. Adversaries may also conduct [Change Default File Association](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/001) and [Masquerading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036) to cause a similar effect. The type of modification and the impact it will have depends on the target application and process as well as the goals and objectives of the adversary. For complex systems, an adversary would likely need special expertise and possibly access to specialized software related to the system that would typically be gained through a prolonged information-gathering campaign in order to have the desired impact.

### Credentials in Registry
Adversaries may search the Registry on compromised systems for insecurely stored credentials. The Windows Registry stores configuration information that can be used by the system or other programs. Adversaries may query the Registry looking for credentials and passwords that have been stored for use by other programs or services. Sometimes these credentials are used for automatic logons.

Example commands to find Registry keys related to password information: (Citation: Pentestlab Stored Credentials)

* Local Machine Hive: `reg query HKLM /f password /t REG_SZ /s`
* Current User Hive: `reg query HKCU /f password /t REG_SZ /s`
