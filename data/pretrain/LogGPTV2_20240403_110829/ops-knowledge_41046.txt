User: When I run my jupyter notebook, the home folder displayed in jupyter is always my home directory even if I start my notebook from a different directory. Also not all folders in my home  directory are displayed. I tried to change the access of the unshown folders by using chmod -R 0755 foldername, however the folders do not show when I run jupyter. 
I want all the folders in my home directory to show. 
I am using ubuntu.
Assistant: Open command promt,
pip
If you use pip, you can install it with:
pip install notebook
Congratulations, you have installed Jupyter Notebook! To run the notebook, run the following command at the Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows):
jupyter notebook
