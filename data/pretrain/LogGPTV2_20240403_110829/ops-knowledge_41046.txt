When I run my Jupyter Notebook, the home folder displayed in Jupyter is always my home directory, even if I start the notebook from a different directory. Additionally, not all folders in my home directory are visible. I tried to change the permissions of the hidden folders using `chmod -R 0755 foldername`, but the folders still do not appear when I run Jupyter.

I want all the folders in my home directory to be displayed. I am using Ubuntu.

To address this issue, follow these steps:

1. **Check Jupyter Configuration:**
   Jupyter might be configured to start in a specific directory. You can check and modify the configuration file to ensure it starts in the desired directory.

   - Generate or edit the Jupyter configuration file:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook --generate-config
     ```
   - Open the configuration file in a text editor:
     ```bash
     nano ~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py
     ```
   - Look for the `c.NotebookApp.notebook_dir` setting and set it to your desired directory, or comment it out to use the current working directory:
     ```python
     # c.NotebookApp.notebook_dir = ''
     ```

2. **Check Directory Permissions:**
   Ensure that the directories you want to access have the correct permissions. You mentioned using `chmod -R 0755 foldername`. This should generally work, but double-check the permissions with:
   ```bash
   ls -l
   ```

3. **Check Jupyter Server Extensions:**
   Some server extensions might restrict the visibility of certain directories. Ensure that no such extensions are active by listing and disabling them:
   ```bash
   jupyter serverextension list
   jupyter serverextension disable <extension_name>
   ```

4. **Install and Run Jupyter Notebook:**
   If you haven't already installed Jupyter Notebook, you can do so using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   ```

   To run Jupyter Notebook, use the following command in the Terminal:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

By following these steps, you should be able to see all the folders in your home directory when running Jupyter Notebook.
