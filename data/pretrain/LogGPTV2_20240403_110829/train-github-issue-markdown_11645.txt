**Please ensure that this is a bug. According to our GitHub Policy, we only address code or documentation bugs, performance issues, feature requests, and build/installation issues on GitHub.**

### System Information
- **OS Platform and Distribution:** macOS Mojave
- **TensorFlow Installation Method:** pip
- **TensorFlow Version:** 2.0.0 alpha-0
- **Python Version:** 3.7.2

### Current Behavior
When using the Python `logging` module in conjunction with TensorFlow, a warning message is emitted:

```
WARNING: Logging before flag parsing goes to stderr.
```

Additionally, duplicate log messages are printed, one with the custom formatter and another with an internally defined format (presumably by TensorFlow). Here is an example of the output:

```plaintext
$ python3 test.py
[INFO|test.py:29] 2019-03-14 17:30:14,402 >> Hello World.
WARNING: Logging before flag parsing goes to stderr.
I0314 17:30:14.402168 4528047552 test.py:29] Hello World.
[INFO|test.py:30] 2019-03-14 17:30:14,402 >> This is message 1
I0314 17:30:14.402369 4528047552 test.py:30] This is message 1
```

If TensorFlow is not imported, the logging works as expected without any warnings or duplicate messages:

```plaintext
$ python3 test.py
[INFO|test.py:29] 2019-03-14 17:37:40,172 >> Hello World.
[INFO|test.py:30] 2019-03-14 17:37:40,172 >> This is message 1
```

### Expected Behavior
The logging should work correctly without emitting the warning message and without duplicating log entries. It seems that the stream handler might be conflicting with TensorFlow's internal logging mechanism.

### Code to Reproduce the Issue
```python
import logging
import tensorflow as tf

# Set up the logging formatter
formatter = logging.Formatter('[%(levelname)s|%(filename)s:%(lineno)s] %(asctime)s >> %(message)s')

# Create a logger
stream_logger = logging.getLogger('logger_stream')
stream_logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)

# Set up the stream handler
stream_handler = logging.StreamHandler()
stream_handler.setFormatter(formatter)
stream_logger.addHandler(stream_handler)

# Log some messages
stream_logger.info("Hello World")
stream_logger.info("This is message 1")
```
