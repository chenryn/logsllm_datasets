be set sufﬁciently long to tolerate the errors in a normal
token transmission. As an example, a payer needs 5 -10
seconds to place her phone before the QR code can be
reliably recognized. As a result, often a payment token
has more than one minute of living time, which as shown
in our study (Section 3), is often long enough for success-
fully spending it on a different transaction, with the help
of a colluder in the attack.
Adversary model. In our study on the payment through
electromagnetic ﬁeld (Samsung Pay) and audio signals,
we consider an adversary who is either physically present
at the payment scene or capable of placing her attack
devices (including sniffer and jammer) there. This is com-
pletely realistic, given the small sizes of the devices, as
illustrated in Figure 7(a). In QR-code based payment, we
no longer require the presence of attack devices. Instead,
we assume that the payer’s phone is infected with an at-
tack app, which does not have system privileges but needs
camera, Bluetooth and network permissions, which are
commonly requested by legitimate apps.
3 STLS Attacks
In this section, we report our security analysis on Sam-
sung Pay as well as the Audio Pay and QR Pay techniques
utilized by other popular mobile off-line payment ser-
vices such as Alipay and Wechat. Our study shows that
they are all subject to the STLS attacks: an adversary
can realistically disrupt payment transactions, steal pay-
ment tokens and spend them without proper authorization.
This security hazard affects hundreds of millions of mo-
bile users worldwide. We contacted all affected service
providers and some of them have already acknowledged
the importance of the ﬁndings. We are now helping them
ﬁx the discovered problems and enhance their protection.
Following we elaborate this study.
3.1 Samsung Pay
Samsung Pay is a popular token based mobile payment
service available on the smartphones manufactured by
Samsung Electronics.
It is characterized by a unique
POS-device communication technique, when compared
with other payment services like Apple Pay and Android
Pay, called Magnetic Secure Transmission (MST), which
has been acquired from LoopPay in 2015 [44]. In this
paper we focus on the security protection of MST, even
though Samsung Pay also supports NFC.
Samsung Pay features a high compatibility to exist-
ing POS terminals which work with magnetic-stripe card.
Merchants need no modiﬁcation to their out-dated POS

it is issued recently, within the validity period) of the
token. If so, the provider continues to check the balance of
the owner’s account to determine whether the transaction
can proceed. A transaction approval or denial is then
issued to the POS terminal, depending on whether all
these checks are passed. The process is shown in Figure
3.
Payment security. The security guarantee of an off-line
payment scheme is mainly built upon the protection of
the payment token, which is essentially the proof for a
payment request, typically in the form of a hash-based
message authentication code (HMAC) over its generation
time and other information. The token is delivered to the
provider by the payee through a secure channel. Less
protected here is the direct link between the payer and
the payee, which could be monitored by the adversary
present at the scene of the payment. For the transaction
going through NFC and Bluetooth (see Table 1), a random
number generated by the payee can serve to challenge the
payer and ensure that the token is bound to a speciﬁc POS
terminal. For other channels, however, existing payment
schemes do not use this challenge-response approach (due
to the complexity and unreliability of the channels) and
instead, rely on one-time token: a token, once received by
the provider, is recorded to make sure that it will not be
used again. Also, each token is ephemeral, with a short
valid period attached to it, based upon its generation time
speciﬁed in its content.
This protection apparently only considers the threat
from a passive adversary, who does nothing to interfere
with the execution of a transaction. The situation can be
very different for an active one. In the case that the trans-
action can actually be disrupted, which stops the delivery
of the token to the provider, the observed one-time token

payment. A Samsung phone stores a piece of secret key
inside KNOX, a secure container. When the Samsung Pay
user (the payer) is going to pay at a POS, she launches
the app and chooses a card she is going to pay with and
then passes the app’s veriﬁcation with either password
or ﬁngerprint. Then the app (inside KNOX) immedi-
ately generates a token for the user by HMAC a piece of
message containing the transaction counter, the primary
account number (PAN) 1 using the secret key, assembles
all information in the same format as the magnetic tracks
on conventional credit cards, and starts to broadcast that
information over the MST channel by modulating electric
current passing through a MST antenna. Any POS termi-
nal, if magnetic card is supported, will receive the token
through its magnetic head and then process it in the exact
same way as if the user is swiping a magnetic-stripe credit
card. The track data with token and other information
encapsulated will be passed to the service provider via
POS’s network for further transaction processes includ-
ing token veriﬁcation, translating to real PAN, balance
veriﬁcation, and the transaction result will be returned to
the POS terminal to notify the payee if the transaction is
approved or not.
Understanding MST. MST is a patented technique
(US8814046 [20]) that ﬁrst appears in LoopPay Fob and
LoopPay CardCase and it is compatible with any existing
POS terminal.
The security protection of MST pretty much depends
on the property of electromagnetic ﬁeld, which is consid-
ered to be a near-ﬁeld communication channel. Speciﬁ-
cally, the strength of electromagnet signal quickly atten-
uates as the distance to the source r grows, at the rate of
1/r3. On LoopPay’s home page, it is claimed: “Loop-
Pay works within a 3-inch distance from the read head.
The ﬁeld dissipates rapidly beyond that point, and only
exists during a transmission initiated by the user” [33]. A
similar claim is also made by Samsung Pay: “Due to the
short-range nature of MST, it is difﬁcult to capture the
payment signal” [43].
Eavesdropping MST signal. However, we found in our
research that this distance based protection does not work
as stated by those claims, which has also been reported
by other research [6, 3]. Fundamentally, the distance that
allows electromagnetic ﬁeld signal snifﬁng feasible is de-
termined by a signal-noise-ratio (SNR) at that distance
and the capability for the snifﬁng antenna to pick up the
signal. Our study shows that instead of 3 inches (< 0.08
meters) as claimed by the MST document, a small loop
antenna at the size of a small bag (as illustrated in Fig-
ure 4) can effectively collect the signal at least 2 meters
away from the source. More importantly, the signal cap-

tured at this distance still carry enough information for
decoding, in a realistic noise environment. For example,
Figure 5 a) and b) compare the signal received by our loop
antenna (2 meters away from the source) with the theoret-
ically received ones, as discovered in a real-world grocery
store. As we can see here, the signal still largely pre-
served the coding information and can therefore be used
for decoding using our later proposed decoding method.
Figure 5: Comparison between original signal and our
received one in 2 meters.
Signal decoding. In our research, we decode such sig-
nal according to impulse polarity changes. Speciﬁcally,
MST uses differential Manchester encoding, in which
the polarity ﬂips once for the symbol ’0’ while twice for
the symbol ’1’ (Figure 5 c)). Although our antenna can-
not directly sense the magnetic ﬁeld, it is able to capture
the polarity ﬂips, because the current generated by the
antenna is the derivative of the magnetic ﬁled (a ﬂip’s
derivative is an impulse, as compared in the Figure 5 b)
and c)).
The captured signal is then decoded using a band pass
ﬁlter (BPF), a synchronization detection module and a
symbol judgment module. BPF allows only frequency

tively reduces the out-of-band noise. The synchronization
detection module identiﬁes the start and the end positions
of each symbol. It sequentially enumerates all the sample
points and determines whether a given sample point is an
apex and whether it exceeds a threshold: if so, the point
is chosen as the start point of the ﬁrst symbol. Then the
module chooses an apex with maximum strength around
its theoretical end position (based upon the symbol dura-
tion) as the end point of the ﬁrst symbol (also the start
point of the second symbol). The process repeats until the
apex’s strength is under the threshold, which indicates that
the valid signal ends. In this way, all the symbols’ start
and end positions are determined. The symbol judgment
module decides whether a given symbol represents ‘0’ or
‘1’ by comparing the polarities of the start and end point.
If the start point and end point have the same polarity, the
symbol represents ’1’, otherwise, it is ’0’.

The symbols generated by the symbol judgment can
be easily translated to a text string in accordance with the
ANSI/ISO ALPHA data format (designed for magnetic
card track 1) or the ANSI/ISO BCD data format (for track
2 and 3) [2], as shown in Figure 6.

mPOS jamming. As mentioned earlier, Samsung Pay
and LoopPay utilize one-time token, which effectively
defends against passive attacks: up to our knowledge,
none of the prior exploit attempts [6, 3] can succeed, be-
cause a used token cannot be used again. A fundamental
issue here, however, is that the protection does not work
against an active adversary and interfering with an ongo-
ing transaction is much more realistic than one thought,
as discovered in our research. Speciﬁcally, we found that
mobile POS systems, as shown in Figure 7(b) and Fig-
ure 7(c), with over 3.2 million already installations and a
over 27 million installations in 2021 by expectation [21],
can be easily jammed using a portable commercial device.
For example, the device in Figure 7(a) can easily block
either WiFi or cellular signal or both at a distance of 3

meters, which causes all mPOS transaction to abort. Such
a jammer simply broadcasts white noise over the same
frequencies as those used by the targeted channels to in-
terfere with legitimate communications. It can be easily
switched on and off to target a speciﬁc payment step. Note
that such jamming does not need to be blind: most mPOS
systems are using WiFi, and a temporary disruption of its
service, within a few meters, will not affect other mobile
users, such as those using smartphones through 3G or
4G; even for the mPOS running on cellular networks, the
adversary can jam only their speciﬁc cellular formats, e.g.,
Verizon (CDMA format), without interfering with others,
e.g., AT&T users (UMTS format), in a 3-meter peripheral.
Further, given the delay for the POS system to restore its
connection, the adversary can quickly stop jamming: for
example, he can turn on the device for 30 seconds and
then leave, and gives his colluder, who receives the token
from an unblocked channel, at least 1 minute to spend the
token.
The attack. Putting pieces together, the ﬂow for the
whole STLS attack on Samsung Pay is illustrated in Fig-
ure 8. The attacker runs a small antenna (small enough
to be hidden in his backpack) connected to a laptop (also
hidden) to monitor the electromagnetic signal around an
mPOS terminal. Once a customer opens her digital wallet
(on her smartphone) for a payment transaction, the an-
tenna captures the token and in the meantime, the jammer
is switched on (which does not affect the communication
between the wallet and the mPOS) to block the mPOS’s
network. The acquired token is then automatically de-
coded and forwarded through an unjammed channel to a
colluder (who might run an app to alert him to the arrival
of a token that needs to be spent within a time frame2).
Such a token is automatically written to a magnetic stripe
card, which can be used just like a normal credit card, or

its token [25].

vending machine) to replay the token. The adversary can
stop the jamming and walk away after a short period
of time, which allows the mPOS to restore its network
connection and receive a payment error from the server
(which often comes without details). As a result, the payer
has to retry with an automatically generated new token
to complete the transaction. We are communicating with
Samsung to help them address this threat.
3.2 Audio Pay
Similar to MST-based payment, the schemes based upon
the audio channel are equally vulnerable to the STLS at-
tack. Following we elaborate the attack on these schemes.
Analysis of audio pay. Audio is an emerging channel
for near-ﬁeld inter-device communication. Compared to
other channels like Bluetooth, Wi-Fi Direct, or NFC, the
audio channel is cheap and easy to use, given the fact that
every phone is equipped with a microphone and a speaker.
The main weakness of this channel is its bandwidth be-
cause of its narrow frequency spectrum. Nevertheless, it
remains an efﬁcient and convenient way to exchange a
small amount of information. In particular, it has been
used by multiple payment schemes, including Alipay and
ToneTag, to transmit a payment token (from the payer’s
device to the payee).
Speciﬁcally, the payer is supposed to encode her pay-
ment information into an audio clip using a modulation
scheme like audio frequency-shift keying (AFSK). Dur-
ing the payment transaction, she can play the clip to the
merchant’s POS device. Upon receiving the audio, the
merchant decodes it to recover the payment token from,
and then sends the token as well as transaction informa-
tion to the payment service provider. The provider veriﬁes
the payment token and replies with an acknowledgement
response if successful. This payment process is illustrated
in Figure 9.
being, the payment token is encoded at the frequency of
17.2kHz - 18.4kHz, which is beyond the absolute thresh-
old of human hearing. But such a modulation scheme also
enables the snifﬁng attack since there is nearly no noise
at this frequency range, and the token can be broadcast
with low lost. Here, we elaborate our attack to audio pay
as below.
