User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Non standard ssh port: should I edit /etc/services? On a *nix system, when configuring ssh to listen on non standard port, 
should I also edit /etc/services to reflect that.

I would think it should be done, so tools that use it (such as ufw) will recognize the correct port for ssh, but I see very little mention of it in documentation and tutorials.

So is it considered good or bad practise to edit /etc/services, and if not, why?

Assistant: I don't think it makes sense to edit /etc/services in such a case. The world will not change ssh ports with you, and all programs that look up service names to port numbers on your machine would get the incorrect port for ssh.

If anything, it might make more sense to add an entry of your own for your non-standard ssh port, eg myssh &lt;yourport&gt;/tcp if you want a service name that you can use.


Then there's obviously the age-long debate of whether changing ports like that to "hide" services actually serves any real purpose beyond reducing log spam.
