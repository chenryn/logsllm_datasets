Web Defense – Fail2Ban 
•  Fail2Ban 
–  Designed to protect against brute-force attacks by analyzing error 
logs 
–  Can be pointed at access logs and used for DDoS defense 
•  Provides both blocking and notification 
Remember this “random” pattern from earlier?

Web Defense – Fail2Ban Example 
23 
Turn “randomized” DDoS attack into a worthless attempt 
jail.conf  
#DDoS blocks for SX 
[apache-dos] 
enabled = true 
port = http,https 
filter = apache-dos 
banaction = iptables-allports 
action = %(action_mwl)s 
logpath = /var/log/apache*/*access.log 
maxretry = 1 
destemail = PI:EMAIL 
ignoreip = 127.0.0.1 192.168.0.0/16 
bantime  = 86400 
apache-dos.conf 
[Definition] 
# Option: failregex 
# Notes: Designed to stop lame DDoS.  No DDoS For You! 
failregex =  ^.*GET \/[A-Z]{99}\=[A-Z]{99}.*$ 
# ignoreregex is here as fail2ban needs it, but we do not. 
ignoreregex = 
Web Defense – Additional Ideas 
•  Caching 
–  Caching systems can cache generated data and greatly reduce 
load on the server 
–  A number of caching systems exist 
•  SX is based on Drupal and uses boost for caching 
•  Associates have reported success using Squid Proxy for caching 
•  Other Apache Defenses 
–  mod_bwshare 
•  Throttle bandwidth per client (IP) 
–  mod_limitipconn 
•  Limit number of simultaneous connections per client (IP) 
•  Attempt to Detect Bots 
–  Captcha 
–  Custom Javascript 
•  Detect keystrokes, mouse events, etc 
24 
Web Defense – Improved Code 
•  Strict validation and filtering on user input 
•  Properly release resources 
•  Set limits 
–  Session related objects and memory allocated 
–  Token expiration 
–  Loop counters 
–  Concurrent session tokens per IP address 
–  Expensive queries (often searches) per IP address 
•  Cache results of expensive queries when possible 
•  Optimize DB structure for application 
•  Test code against DoS/DDoS 
–  Should be part of quality assurance in your organization 
25 
Web Defense – Best Practices 
•  Limit connections with something like mod_evasion 
•  Have some way(s) to intelligently block bad traffic  
–  Snort inline/Fail2ban/etc 
•  Have sniffer(s) in place to have quick access to traffic 
•  Tune webserver, database, etc for performance 
–  This includes log tuning 
•  Configure webserver to log Client IP AND X-Forwarded-For 
•  Remove search function if not needed 
–  Could replace with google search or at least require users to login 
to site to perform searches 
•  Avoid hosting public large files when possible 
–  Many DDoS have involved hitting large PDF files 
•  Have a monitoring service such as RoboAmp running 
•  Deploy as many of the defenses covered as possible 
•  Share information with similar companies/individuals 
26 
•  Don’t Panic! 
•  Verify Attack 
–  Attack or just youtube? 
•  Read logs 
–  Web logs are often ideal initially 
–  See if you can block on User Agent 
–  Get top talkers and block on malicious ones 
•  # cat access.log | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n 
–  Look for patterns for Fail2Ban or whatever blocking 
system you have in place 
•  Use sniffers + wireshark 
–  Identify unique characteristics to block on 
27 
Reacting to an Attack 
•  If attack was effective, why? 
–  Talk to various teams in your organization 
•  Brainstorm! 
–  Deploy defenses discussed here (if not already) 
–  Test network against a similar attack until defenses are effective 
•  Hack back? 
–  SX Forum users have hacked DDoSers with great success 
– 
“Is it more risky to continue the same methods of cyber defense (stand in the ring with multiple opponents 
just bobbing and weaving never throwing a punch) or more risky to start fighting back with jabs, 
combinations, head and body blows?” – Jeff Bardin, Treadstone71 
•  Shame? 
–  Identifying and shaming DDoSers has been effective for SX 
–  Once tied back to real name, every DDoS skid has left to never 
return 
28 
Reacting to an Attack (Aftermath) 
29 
Story Time 
•  VB 
-  VB DDoS’d SX and took it down for 5 minutes 
-  The Fixer got VB’s IP from the forums 
-  VB’s ISP used mikrotik routers (where TheFixer used to work) 
-  Remote pcap and lulz ensued 
•  BenOwns 
-  Defrauded SX VIP and was called out for it 
-  Proceeded to DDoS the site 
-  Dox were dropped, Ben vanished 
•  Others 
-  Many a pizza has been ordered at the 
   expense of DDoS skids 
-  Sc0rpion 
-  plex0r 
•  Anonymous network technicians that answered 
questions about various DDoS they have encountered 
•  Amp, The Fixer, lattera, spender, sn4ggl3, Shinobi, 
Kohelet, Rhapsody, and the entire soldierx.com 
community (to include irc.soldierx.com) 
•  DDoS skids for all of the entertaining nights of laughing 
at your packets (especially Desu attack)
