can be broken down into three sequential phases: recogni-
zance, identiﬁcation, and veriﬁcation.
Recognizance: First, nmap is used to scan large portions
of the internet for open TCP ports 23 and 80. The
results of scan is stored in a SQL database.
Identiﬁcation: Next, the device identiﬁcation process con-
nects to all listening Telnet and HTTP servers to re-
trieve the initial output of these servers2. The server
output is stored in a SQL database then matched against
a list of signatures to identify the manufacturer and
model of the device in question (See 3.3).
For example, Figure 2 shows a telnet login prompt
common to Cisco routers and switches.
Veriﬁcation: Once the manufacturer and model of the de-
vice are positively identiﬁed, the veriﬁcation phase uses
an automated script to attempt to log into devices
found in the identiﬁcation phase. This script uses only
well known default root credentials for the speciﬁc de-
vice model and does not engage in any form of brute
force password guessing. We create a unique device
veriﬁcation proﬁle for each type of embedded device
we monitor. This proﬁle contains all information nec-
essary for the veriﬁcation script to automatically ne-
gotiate the authentication process, using either the de-
vice’s Telnet or HTTP administrative interface. Fig-
ure 3.2 shows two typical device veriﬁcation proﬁles,
one for the administrative Telnet interface for Cisco
switches and routers, the other for the HTTP adminis-
trative interface for Linksys WRT routers using HTTP
Basic Authentication. Each device veriﬁcation proﬁle
contains information like the username and password
prompt signatures, default credentials as well as au-
thentication success and failure conditions for the par-
ticular embedded device type. Once the success or
failure of the default credential is veriﬁed, the TCP
session is terminated and the results are written to an
encrypted ﬂash drive for oﬀ-line analysis. (See 3.5).

ical Distribution of the IP Ranges Currently Moni-
tored by the Default Credential Scanner.
3.3 Device Selection
The full list of devices currently monitored by our default
credential scanner can be found on our project webpage3.
In order for an embedded device to be included in this list,
its default root credentials must be well known and obtain-
able through either manufacturer documentation or simple
search engine queries. The default credential scanner does
not engage in any form of brute force password guessing.
The device selection process is manual and iterative. We
begin by analyzing data gathered by the recognizance phase
of our scanner, which collects the initial output from ac-
tive Telnet and HTTP servers found by NMAP. We main-
tain three sets of signatures: non-embedded devices, non-
candidate embedded devices and candidate embedded de-
vices. Signatures of non-embedded devices include those of
popular HTTP servers such as Apache and IIS as well as
Telnet common authentication prompts of general purpose
operating systems. Signatures of non-candidate embedded
devices include those that do not ship with a well known de-
fault credential4. Signatures of candidate embedded devices
include string patterns that positively identify the device as
one that we are actively monitoring. After the recognizance
data is tagged using these three signature sets, we manually
inspect the remaining records, tagging, creating new signa-
tures and device veriﬁcation proﬁles.
3.4 Network Range Selection
We initially directed our scan towards the largest ISPs
in North and South America, Europe and Asia. As we it-
eratively reﬁned our scanning infrastructure, we gradually
widened the scope of our scan to include select geographical
locations within the United States. After testing our de-
fault credential scanner for over six months to ensure that it
caused no harm to the scanned networks, we ﬁnally allowed
the scanner to operate globally. Using a reverse lookup of
the MaxMind GeoIP database [2], we included every /24 net-
work in the IPv4 space which is associated to a geographical
location. Table 2 shows some key metrics on the scope of
the IP ranges which we currently monitor.
3.5 Ethical Considerations and Due Diligence
The technical methodology of our project is straightfor-
ward. However, the necessary means of gathering real-world
data on the vulnerability rates of embedded device have
raised an ethical debate.
3http://www.hacktory.cs.columbia.edu
4For example, the Polycom VSX 3000 video conferencing
unit uses the device’s serial number as the default password.
100On one hand, the simple act of port scanning a remote net-
work across the internet can be construed as a hostile and
malicious attack. On the other hand, we can not move be-
yond vague and anecdotal suspicions of the embedded device
security problem unless we gather large scale, quantitative
evidence of the problem currently in the wild.
As advocated in a recent position paper on the ethics of
security vulnerability research [15], this line of proactive vul-
nerability research serves an important social function and
is neither unethical nor illegal with respect to US
law.
The experimental results contain sensitive information on
a large number of vulnerable devices in the world, some of
which reside in sensitive environments. Therefore it is the
responsibility of the research team to uphold a high stan-
dard for ethical behavior and due diligence when engaging
in such sensitive research. The operating environment must
be isolated and fortiﬁed against compromise and data ex-
ﬁltration. Furthermore, each member of the research team
must agree to adhere to a clear experimental protocol to
ensure that no harm is done.
A trivial network scanner can be implemented with little
work. However, using such a scanner openly on a global
scale is irresponsible and ethically unacceptable. Therefore
we have invested a large portion of of energy to create a
secure research environment and a responsible experimental
protocol in order to ensure that our activities cause no harm:
Doing no harm. Bound by the ethics principal of the duty
not to harm, we have taken numerous steps to ensure
that our research activities do not interfere with the
normal operations of the networks we monitor. To
this end, the default credential scanner is designed to
use minimal external resources in order to accurately
verify device vulnerability. We scan target networks
in /24 blocks in non-sequential order in order to min-
imize the number of incoming TCP requests destined
to any individual organization. Detailed activity logs
are kept to ensure that no device or network is un-
necessarily probed multiple times during a single scan.
Overall, non-embedded devices and non-candidate em-
bedded devices will receive at most 6 TCP packets over
a period of several minutes. The scanner’s outbound
packet-rate is policed and monitored in order not to
overwhelm any in-path networking devices. Lastly,
each IP address used by our scanner runs a pubic
webpage describing the intention and methodology of
our project [3]. This page also provides instructions
for permanently opting-out of the scan.
(See Table
6). Such requests are monitored by both our research
team as well as the Columbia University NOC, and are
promptly honored without question.
Implementing a secure research environment. The scan
system is contained in a DMZ network behind a Cisco
ASA ﬁrewall. Scanning nodes are isolated from the
university network. Inbound access to this protected
network can only be established by using IPSec VPN.
Outbound access by the scanning nodes are limited
to the ports which they are scanning (Telnet, HTTP,
etc).
Compartmentalization of access to sensitive information.
VPN access to the scan system DMZ is granted only
to active members of the research team. New students
participating in research are ﬁrst given access to a sep-
arate DMZ containing a development copy of the scan
system with no sensitive data. Access to the produc-
tion environment is given to students only after they
have acknowledged and demonstrated understanding
of the experimental protocol.
Proper handling of sensitive data at rest. Sensitive ex-
perimental data is purged from the production database
regularly, then transferred to an IronKey [4] USB stick
for encrypted oﬄine storage. This is done to minimize
the amount of data available for exﬁltration in case of
a compromise of the research environment.
Notiﬁcations of vulnerabilities through trusted channels.
Signiﬁcant vulnerabilities are reported to Team Cymru,
who brokers communications between our research team
and the appropriate contacts. Sensitive information
detailing the vulnerable devices is either physically handed
oﬀ to Team Cmyru members or transferred using en-
crypted channels.
4. MALICIOUS POTENTIAL OF EMBED-
DED DEVICE EXPLOITATION
This section discusses several novel ways of exploiting vul-
nerable embedded devices due to their unique functions and
hardware capabilities. After auditing the functional capabil-
ities of many diﬀerent embedded devices, we have concluded
that the attacks described below are trivially possible among
a majority of embedded devices within the appropriate func-
tional categories. All attacks discussed below can be carried
out through legitimate manipulation of the administrative
interface. More importantly, as the data presented in Sec-
tion 5 illustrate quantitatively, there exists a large popula-
tion of embedded devices vulnerable to each of the attacks
discussed below. Although DDOS attacks using embedded
devices have certainly been carried out on a relatively large
scale, most of the other attacks described in this section have
not. However, considering the data presented in Section 5,
we posit that it is only a matter of time before such attacks
are carried out systematically on a large scale.
We have engaged several major organizations to mitigate
some of the issues discussed below. Therefore, speciﬁc de-
tails regarding organization names and device model infor-
mation are withheld when appropriate.
4.1 Massive DDOS Potential
The heterogeneous nature of embedded administrative in-
terfaces makes orchestrating large DDOS attacks using em-
bedded devices a logistic challenge. Vulnerable embedded
devices clearly exist in large numbers in the wild. However,
it is often believed that embedded operating systems are
too diverse; and capturing the long tail of this diversity is
required to carry out large scale exploitation. Data gathered
by our default credential scanner reveal that many large vul-
nerable homogenous device groups exist in the wild. In fact,
the top 3 most vulnerable device types represent over 55%
of all vulnerable devices discovered by our latest scan. In
other words, there exists at least 300,000 vulnerable embed-
ded devices which can be controlled via 3 similar Telnet-
based administrative interfaces. The exact model of these
three device groups have been anonymized. However, these
three device groups are centrally managed by various service
providers around the world, and thus can be systematically
1014.4 Enterprise Credential Leakage via Acci-
dental Misconﬁguration
It is common practice for organizations that operate large
homogenous collections of networking equipment to apply
the same set of administrative credentials to all managed
devices. While this signiﬁcantly reduces the complexity and
cost of managing a large network, it also puts the network
at risk of total compromise. Using a single master root pass-
word for all networking devices is safe so long as every device
is correctly conﬁgured at all times, and the master password
is not leaked. If an enterprise networking device is brought
online with both factory default credentials, as well as the
master credentials of the organization, an attacker can eas-
ily obtain the master root password for the entire network.
While this event is unlikely, the probability of such a mis-
conﬁguration quickly increases with the size and complexity
of the organization, specially when human error is taken into
account. We have not veriﬁed that such an attack is feasi-
ble; however, our data indicate that enterprise networking
devices residing within large homogenous environments have
been misconﬁgured with default root credentials.
5. ANALYSIS OF RESULTS
Figure 4: Embedded Device Vulnerability Rates of
Monitored Countries (Threshold = 2%).
In this section we present latest data gathered by our de-
fault credential scanner as well as preliminary results from
our ongoing longitudinal study, tracking approximately 102,000
vulnerable devices over a span of four months. We also
present statistics on the level of human and organizational
responses received by Columbia University regarding our
scanning activities. Figure 4 shows a heat map of embedded
device vulnerability rates across monitored countries.
Section 5.1 shows the breakdown of vulnerable embed-
ded devices across 9 functional categories; Enterprise
Devices, VoIP Devices, Home Networking Devices, Cam-
era/Surveillance, Oﬃce Appliances, Power Management Con-
trollers, Service Provider Issued Equipment, Video Confer-
encing Units, and Home Brew Devices. Section 5.2 shows
the breakdown of vulnerable embedded devices across 6 con-
tinents. Section 5.3 shows the breakdown of vulnerable de-
vices across 5 types of organizations; Educational, ISP,
Private Enterprise, Government, and Unidentiﬁed.

secured in a feasible manner. Figure 3 shows the distribu-
tion of the top 12 most frequently encountered vulnerable
embedded device types.
4.2 VoIP Appliance Exploitation
VoIP adapters like the Linksys PAP2, Linksys SPA and
Sipura SPA are consumer appliances, which provide a gate-
way between standard analog telephones and VoIP service
providers. In many cases, the publicly accessible HTTP in-
terface of such devices will display diagnostic information
without requiring any user authentication. This informa-
tion usually includes the name of the customer, their phone
number(s), a log of incoming and outgoing calls, and rel-
evant information regarding the SIP gateway to which the
device is conﬁgured to connect. Once authenticated as the
administrative user, an attacker can usually retrieve the cus-
tomer’s SIP credentials, either by exploiting trivial HTTP
vulnerabilities5 or redirecting the victim to a malicious SIP
server.
4.3 Data Leakage via Ofﬁce Appliance Exploita-
tion
Enterprise printers servers and digital document stations
are ubiquitous in most work environments. According to
our data, network printers also constitute one of the most
vulnerable types of embedded devices. For example, our
default credential scanner identiﬁed over 44,000 vulnerable
HP JetDirect Print Servers in 2,505 unique organizations
worldwide. Since high-end print servers and document sta-
tions often have the capability of digitally caching the doc-
uments it processes, we posit that an attacker can use such
devices not only to monitor the ﬂow of internal documents,
but also to exﬁltrate them as well.

HTML password ﬁelds. While this appears to hide the pass-
words in the web browser, it does not hide it in the HTML
source.
