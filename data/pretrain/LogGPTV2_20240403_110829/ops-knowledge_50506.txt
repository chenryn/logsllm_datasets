User: I recently compiled the shogun library from source, but I'm not sure where I need to place the python files created.  make install placed them in '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages' which I assume is valid on linux systems.
sys.path in python doesn't have a dist-packages in its path, only a site-packages
Assistant: Workaround: Decided to simply add a .pth file to my site-packages directory which points to /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
That is: Place in /Library/Frameworks/EPD64.framework/Versions/7.3/lib/python2.7/site-packages
a file shogun.pth which simply contains: /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/
