Question: "A web application security engineer is reviewing the framing policies to enhance the siteâ€™s defense against clickjacking attacks. Which Content Security Policy (CSP) directive should the engineer use to prevent the site from being iframed by any other site, and what would be an appropriate alternative to the deprecated directive that allowed iframing from a specific URI?"
 "A": "Use 'DENY' to prevent any site from iframing, and replace the deprecated 'ALLOW-FROM' directive with 'frame-ancestors'."
 "B": "Use 'SAMEORIGIN' to prevent any site from iframing, and keep using 'ALLOW-FROM' as there is no replacement."
 "C": "Use 'ALLOW-FROM' to prevent any site from iframing, and replace it with 'default-src' for specific URIs."
 "D": "Use 'SAMEORIGIN' to allow any site to iframe, and replace 'ALLOW-FROM' with 'frame-options'."
