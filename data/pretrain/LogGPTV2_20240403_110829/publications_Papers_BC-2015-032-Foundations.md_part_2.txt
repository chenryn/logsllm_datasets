1.1.3 ServiceIndustries
Oneapproachtopromotetheunderstandingofrealworld,digital,andeveryday
services across service industries is to provide examples. The service sector is
amazingly varied. A brief reading of the listings in the Yellow Pages shows an
overwhelmingnumberofservicesdirectedatindividualconsumersaswellasto
corporatepurchasers. Mostconsumersuseservicesalmosteveryday. Traveling
by bus, visiting the dentist, mailing a letter, getting a haircut, refueling a car or
sending clothes to the cleaners are all examples of service consumption. This

1.2.1 DefinitionofaService
Services have many facets. The word service can have different meanings in
colloquiallanguageasitwillbepointedoutlater. Theacademiccommunityhas
lookedatservicesformanyyears. Yet,differentacademicdisciplinescameupwith
different views on services. As a consequence, it cannot be expected that there
existsasinglecomprehensiveandcommonlyaccepteddefinitionofaservice.

that the receiver of the service is a single person or the belongings of a single

economicunitisacompany(anorganization)incorporatingdifferentpeopleand
“belongings” (assets belonging to a company). Putting the words “person” and
“good” into the plural form, Hill’s definition becomes general enough to cover
all kinds of service situations. It is implicit in this definition that the receiving
economicunit(theunitrequestingandeventuallypayingfortheservice)andthe

Hill and other authors who later built on Hill’s definition of a service (e.g.,
