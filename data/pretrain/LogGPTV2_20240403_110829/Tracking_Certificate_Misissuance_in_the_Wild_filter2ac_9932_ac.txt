Fig. 7: OCSP, CRL Timeouts and Average time to Respond—We show the average response time as well as the number

organizations adhere to community standards, there are still a handful of poorly managed and broken services encoded in trusted
certiﬁcates.
that in 80% of these organizations, the majority of ZLint error
certiﬁcates can be traced back to exactly one intermediate. For
example, the majority of COMODO’s misissued certiﬁcates
are generated by the intermediate COMODO RSA Domain
Validation Secure Server, which accounts for 85.5% of the
error certiﬁcates. We posit that this is because intermediates
within an organization are using entirely disparate codebases
or infrastructure to issue certiﬁcates. This has implications
for PKI organizations moving forward—as rules continue to
grow and change, maintenance of such processes may become
unwieldy, and the surface area for a programming error to
manifest may increase. Ultimately, oversight of an organization
is harder when there are disparate issuance processes.

While ZLint can systematically identify problems in the
construction of individual certiﬁcates, there are many aspects
of CA operation that cannot be veriﬁed in isolation. These
range from correctly validating domain ownership to generating
consistent OCSP responses. We measure two supporting
services—OCSP responders and CRL distribution points—to
see if they correlate with certiﬁcate misissuance.
A. OCSP Responders
OCSP (Online Certiﬁcate Status Protocol) is an Internet
protocol that allows authorities to revoke issued certiﬁcates [39].
Per BR §4.9, authorities are required to continually operate
OCSP responders that allow user agents to check for revocation.
We measured for adherence with following requirements:
1) Endpoint Availability Certiﬁcate authorities must main-
tain an online OCSP responder (BR §4.9.10). We check
for baseline responsiveness every hour during this period
using a 60 second timeout.
2) Regular Updates Per BR §4.9.10, OCSP responders
must update revocation responses at least once every four
days. We check that responses are not older than this.
3) No Response for Unknown Certiﬁcates Authorities
must not return a G O O D response for certiﬁcates they did
not issue. We construct and send an OCSP request for the
serial number deadbeefdeadbeef, which we found no
CA had issued in our dataset.
We performed these checks for the 1,419 responders in our
dataset every hour from the University of Illinois Urbana-
Champaign campus between September 1–20, 2017.
Given the large number of organizations that misissue
certiﬁcates, we were surprised to ﬁnd that 75% of respon-
ders (associated with 89.8% of intermediates and 94.2% of
organizations) were available for all 454 checks during our
two week measurement period. Just over 9% of responders
(134) responders were ofﬂine for all checks. These belonged
to 73 organizations. Beyond the responders that were never
available, there is a large variance in responder uptime (Fig-

TABLE V: Distrusted Certiﬁcate Authorities—We show the three major organizations that have lost browser trust compared
to the rest of the ecosystem. In 2016 and 2017, all three organizations were misissuing certiﬁcates at a rate 2-8x worse than the
remainder of trusted organizations.
ure 7a). Baseline Requirements §4.10.2 stipulates that OCSP
responders must respond in under 10 seconds under normal
operating conditions. As can be seen in Figure 7b, the median
response time is 247 milliseconds, but 2 (0.2%) responders have
median response times above 10 seconds. Both belonged to
WISeKey. In addition, 53 responders had worst-case response
times greater than 10 seconds.
There were 25 responders (11 organizations) that incorrectly
provided a G O O D response for an unknown certiﬁcate. These
belonged to smaller authorities, with an median issuance of
24 certiﬁcates. The largest of these authorities was Swisscom
Smaragd CA 2, which issued 571 certiﬁcates in our dataset.
Only 10 responders (7 organizations) did not refresh validity
periods every four days. These were similarly small authorities,
issuing a median 22 certiﬁcates. In general, we note a positive
trend in OCSP responder health from 2012 when only 8.27%
of OCSP queries took less than 100ms [43]. In our experiment,
just over 33% of our OCSP requests required 100ms, and in
general, there are only a handful of responders in the wild that
behave incorrectly.
B. CRL Maintenance
While OCSP is the preferred mechanism for revoking
certiﬁcates, some CAs continue to support CRLs. When CAs
decide to provide CRL-based revocation, they must guarantee
the uptime of CRL distribution points per BR §4.10. There
are 3.4 K unique CRLs, which are associated with 90% of
intermediates and 95% of organizations in our dataset.
We observe a smaller number of CRL distribution points that
time out for every request compared to OCSP (6 servers, 0.2%).
The median average response time is 252 milliseconds, which
is well under the BR requirement of 10 seconds (Figure 7b).
However, 2 CRL distribution points had worst-case response
times of 15 seconds. The rate of of the curve increases rapidly
after the median point. In other words, the latter 50% of CRLs
are far signiﬁcantly worse than the than the former 50%. We
ﬁnd that the latter 50% of CRLs generally belong to much
smaller organizations that issue a median 37 certiﬁcates. This
is similar with our earlier ﬁnding that smaller organization
misissue a larger fractions of their certiﬁcates.

While adhering to technical standards is innately important
for guaranteeing correct behavior with user agents, it is also
natural to ask if the misissuance that ZLint detects can act as a
predictor for more severe problems like incorrectly validating
domain ownership.
In the past year, Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox
took removal steps for three certiﬁcate authorities: WoSign,
Symantec, and PROCERT [29], [35], [49]. The browsers did not
revoke these authorities solely based on failure to adhere to the
Baseline Requirements [49]. However, these issuers had some
of the worst ZLint misissuance rates in their corresponding
classes. Of the 16 authorities with more than 100 K certiﬁcates
in our dataset, Symantec and Wosign controlled ﬁve of the
six organizations with the highest misissuance rates (Table V).
These were 5–24 times higher than the median misissuance
rate for this class of authorities. The sixth organization in the
equivalence class is GoDaddy, who misissued 38 K (2.4%)
certiﬁcates. We manually investigated the certiﬁcates GoDaddy
issued and ﬁnd that 95% were issued in late 2012 to early 2013.
All suffered from the same problem: missing the required SAN
extension. Since the issue was resolved in 2013, GoDaddy’s
misissuance rate has been 0.1%, in line with other authorities
like Let’s Encrypt and Comodo.
For large authorities with over 100K certiﬁcates, there is
strong correlation between organization misissuance rate (i.e,
percent of certiﬁcates containing errors) and browser action. The
Point-Biserial Correlation between organization misissuance
and browser action is 0.71 (p = 0.002). However, we note
that while several intermediate organizations were distrusted
by browsers, these were subsidiaries of only two companies.
We manually categorize the issuer organizations for these
top CAs by parent company and ﬁnd moderate correlation
of (0.58, p = 0.04). This correlation breaks down when run
against all authorities, because there are a large number of
very small authorities who have misissued all certiﬁcates.
37 organizations misissue more than 90% of their certiﬁcates
and 18 organizations have a 100% misissuance rate. As such,
there is no correlation for situations like PROCERT where 39
(100%) of certiﬁcates are misissued.
Beyond the correlation with browser action, there is weak
correlation between organizations that sign certiﬁcates with

warnings and organizations that sign certiﬁcates with errors.5
There is strong correlation (0.59) between OCSP and CRL mis-
management, but only weak correlation between misissuance
(as deﬁned by ZLint) and OCSP mismanagement. This result
lends some credence to the notion that misissuance can serve
as an indicator for larger organizational mismanagement issues,
as PKI members have previously suggested [42].
A. Community Discussion of Misissuance
Given the number of the authorities with exceedingly high
misissuance rates, it begs the question: is the community aware
of and addressing these authorities’ behavior? To investigate
this, we investigated the correlation between mismanagement
and misissuance with discussion on the Mozilla Developer
Security Policy (MDSP) mailing list. The MDSP mailing list
is the primary public forum for discussing web PKI issues
and for reporting misissuance [1]. As such, MDSP acts as
a “public proﬁle” of a CA. We used the number of times a
CA was mentioned doing something unexpected as a proxy
for “CA Notoriety” in the community. We crawled the MDSP
forum from the beginning of 2015 and searched for links to
certiﬁcates that were misissued (e.g., a link to crt.sh). We
augmented this list by manually inspecting posts for other
kinds of mentions that did not include certiﬁcate links. In total,
we classiﬁed 6,069 posts and comments, identifying a total
630 CA mentions. These misissued certiﬁcates are associated
with 130 intermediate certiﬁcates and 83 organizations.
Surprisingly, there is only a weak correlation between ZLint
errors (i.e., misissuance) and MDSP discussion of misissuance
(Table VI). However, we ﬁnd that many organizations are
mentioned infrequently on MDSP, and as a result, rank ordering
in the latter 50% of the dataset is fairly unstable. If we only
consider the larger half of the organizations, we observe strong
positive correlation (0.88, p << 0.01). In other words, large
authorities that misissue certiﬁcates are discussed on MDSP,
but there is a lack of conversation around small organizations.
This may be because community members are only discussing
misissued certiﬁcates when they are ﬁrst logged in certiﬁcate
transparency servers and many of the small authorities have
only issued a handful of publicly-known certiﬁcates.
Last, we note that discussion is skewed towards misissuance
rather than management of other resources like CRLs and OCSP,
5We use the Spearman’s rank correlation test to determine correlation
between types of mismanagement. According to Cohen’s guidelines [13],
values with absolute correlation coefﬁcients from 0.1–0.3 are weakly correlated,
values from 0.3–0.5 are moderately correlated, and values greater than 0.5 are
considered strongly correlated.
despite these being a critical part of the Baseline Requirements.
This may be because misissued certiﬁcates can be found during
ex post facto investigation rather than requiring continuous
monitoring.
V I I . D I S C U S S I O N
It is not immediately clear what the PKI community should
do with lint results, or the correlation between misissuance
and other types of mismanagement. In this section, we discuss
potential routes forward as well as other observations from our
investigation.
A. Community Response
Given the positive correlation between ZLint-identiﬁed
misissuance, other types of operational mismanagement, and
more serious concerns, we argue that the PKI community
should use lint results along with other data sources (e.g., OCSP
monitoring) to identify authorities with worrisome operational
practices. While many of the correlations we discussed are
not strong under all circumstances, we note that we are not
arguing for browsers to take direct action based on lint results.
Rather, we argue that lint data can used to indicate where the
community should focus more attention.
This is slightly different from how lint results are being
used today. Currently, conversation looks to focus on a speciﬁc
incident or a single class of error. In most cases, these are errors
that larger authorities are making. While addressing these errors
will likely lead to better certiﬁcate quality, we encourage the
community to look beyond individual misissuances and to focus
attention on the authorities that are failing to address sustained
misissuance.
There is slight risk that constant attention on lints will
train authorities to simply pass linters rather than focus on
the larger issues at hand. This could remove one of a small
number of externally visible indicators of CA behavior before
a more serious incident occurs. However, given that the CA/B
Forum Baseline Requirements are an evolving document and
that authorities are continuing to misissue certiﬁcates despite
the emergence of tools like certlint, this seems unlikely. We
encourage authorities to integrate tools like ZLint and certlint
into their issuance processes. We expect that this will provide
a low-pass ﬁlter on organizations looking to reduce their error
proﬁle. Lint errors should further only make up one component
of a certiﬁcate authority’s public proﬁle. Other aspects such
as CRL and OCSP availability as well as CAA adherence can
and should be used as indicators. Root stores might consider
setting strict limits before authorities are disqualiﬁed.

A critical step in focusing attention on the most worrisome
authorities is independent, long-term data collection and re-
porting. Certiﬁcate Transparency and services like crt.sh are
a huge step forward in addressing problems in the web PKI.
However, the ecosystem still needs additional monitors that
track other aspects of behavior such as OCSP/CRL uptime and
better reporting tools to track CA behavior over time.
B. Small Authorities
As has been noted by many prior studies, there are a
worrisome number of small certiﬁcate authorities that can sign
certiﬁcates for nearly any website [5], [19], [47], [48]. In
most cases, this concern has been theoretical, based on the
nature of the controlling organizations and the concept of “least
privilege.” However, as can be seen in Figure 5, most of these
small authorities are struggling to follow community standards
and correctly issue valid certiﬁcates.
PROCERT is one of nineteen authorities that have misissued
every certiﬁcate valid at the time of our study. 37 authorities
have misissued 90% of certiﬁcates and 76 authorities have
errors in at least half of their certiﬁcates. Like PROCERT,
the authorities with the worst issuance proﬁles tend to be
small. Of the organizations who have issued more than half
of their certiﬁcates incorrectly, the majority (77%) have issued
fewer than 100 certiﬁcates and only two have issued more than
1,000 certiﬁcates. Unfortunately, as discussed in the previous
section, while the misbehavior of medium and large authorities
has been discussed, many of these very small authorities have
gone unmentioned on public forums like MDSP, but deserve
additional attention.
C. Lack of Authority Transparency
CCADB is a signiﬁcant step forward for tracking who
controls CA certiﬁcates. However, we ﬁnd that it is still
missing 59 (4.4%) of the intermediates in our investigation. All
misissued at least one certiﬁcate. We were further surprised to
ﬁnd that while CCADB oftentimes contains the information
needed to identify the CA owner (e.g., audit statements),
there is no discrete ﬁeld that
indicates an intermediate’s
operator. For example, Let’s Encrypt is listed as being owned
by both IdenTrust and ISRG, because IdenTrust served as
their trust anchor before Let’s Encrypt established their own
root certiﬁcate. We expect that making this data explicit will
ensure more accurate measurement and enable new types of
monitoring.
V I I I . R E L AT E D W O R K
Our understanding of the certiﬁcate ecosystem has largely
been informed by active probing of HTTPS sites and Internet-
wide scanning of the IPv4 space. Holz et al. published a study
in 2011 that focused on a lack of standardization across leaf
certiﬁcates found through active and passive measurements [26].
The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) operates the SSL
Observatory, which aggregates certiﬁcates based on frequent
IPv4 scans [21]. In 2013, Durumeric et al. analyzed the
state of the HTTPS PKI, focusing on certiﬁcate collected
through aggregate scans of the IPv4 space [19]. Unfortunately,
the ecosystem is becoming increasingly opaque to scanning.
VanderSloot et al. showed that scanning can no longer be used
as the sole source for certiﬁcate measurement, and that we
must instead leverage a variety of perspectives to further our
understanding. As a result, this study utilizes both Censys [17]
and Certiﬁcate Transparency Logs [27], which cover 99.4% of
the certiﬁcates observed by VanderSloot et al [47].
In addition to these measurements, there is a long history of
work from both academia and industry that have measured and
improved the HTTPS and certiﬁcate ecosystem. For example,
Akhawe et al. published two studies on how to improve the
effectiveness of HTTPS browser warnings [4], [5]. In addition,
researchers have focused on certiﬁcate and PKI errors from
both the perspectives of the CA and the browser, and in contexts
outside of HTTPS [3], [6], [18], [48]. Recent work from Porter
Felt et al. has studied the increased adoption of HTTPS, and
offers insight into improving adoption further [23]. Finally,
there have been a number of papers that investigate the state
of revocation in the Web PKI [28], [50].
Our work is not the ﬁrst to measure certiﬁcate compliance
with community standards. In particular, Delignat-Lavaud et al.
investigated certiﬁcate conformance to the BRs on an aggregate
level in 2014 [16]. Our work draws on their initial analysis,
but provides an update on the ecosystem in 2017. Further, we
released ZLint as an open source project, and deployed our
linter in production environments to provide actionable feedback
to the PKI community. Finally, we focus on using compliance
data as a predictor for other security related problems with
CAs, which was not present in the original work.
The idea of building a certiﬁcate linter was drawn from
prior community efforts to build similar tools. In early 2016,
AWSLabs published a tool called certlint [7], which checks
a myriad of important ﬁelds on certiﬁcates for conformance.
Shortly after, a tool named x509lint was released [36], which
broadly checks the correctness of ﬁelds in certiﬁcates. Unfor-
tunately, we found using these tools to be a challenge, as they
lacked consistency and did not entirely cover the clauses in the
standards.
In addition to large scale measurements, there has also been
focused work on testing the quality of certiﬁcate validation in
