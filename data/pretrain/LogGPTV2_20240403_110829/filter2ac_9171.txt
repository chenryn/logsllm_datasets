ATT&CK ID:S0420
ATT&CK Technique Name:Dvmap
Dvmap replaces /system/bin/ip with a malicious version. Dvmap can inject code by patching libdmv.so or libandroid_runtime.so, depending on the Android OS version. Both libraries are related to the Dalvik and ART runtime environments. The patched functions can only call /system/bin/ip, which was replaced with the malicious version.[1]
