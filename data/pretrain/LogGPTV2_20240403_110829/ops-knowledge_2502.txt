User: I am trying to make a file manager in python that looks like GNOME default file manager (nautilus) Because I am developing a FilePane plugin for a python written text editor. I don't know if there is a widget to give me the same look of Nautilus. If not, what widgets can I use to get a nice looking file manager?
Assistant: I searched GTK API and I found that GTK TreeView does what I want.
