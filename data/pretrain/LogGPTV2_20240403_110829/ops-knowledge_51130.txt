User: i wrote a python script and installed py2exe 0.6.9 (win32) to a 32bit-Windows7 machine with Python 2.7. I could successfully run "python setup.py py2exe" via cmd.
Now I installed py2exe 0.6.9 (win64) to a 2nd PC (Win7, 64bit, Python2.7) and tried the same to exactly the same script:
But "python setup.py py2exe" returned this message (hope I translated it correctly into english):
"The command 'python' is either written wrong or couldn't be found."
Why does this happen? How can I solve this?
Assistant: This has nothing to do with py2exe, and everything to do with the machine's setup.
You don't have python on your path. You can test this by just running python by itself to open the interactive interpreter. If cmd can't find python, it can't run it.
Here are some ways around this:

Explicitly use the full path to Pythonâ€”e.g., if it's C:\Python27\bin\Python.exe, type that instead of just python.
Temporarily edit your PATH environment variable in the cmd window. With the above example, this would be set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Python27\bin. You will have to do this again every time you reboot, open a new cmd window, etc.
Permanently edit your PATH environment variable. This is done in the Advanced System Settings controls, which I believe are still accessible through the Properties on the context menu for My Computer in Windows 7.
Uninstall and reinstall Python, and this time allow it to put itself on your path.
Ask for further help at superuser or some other site that's focused on system configuration problems rather than programming problems.
