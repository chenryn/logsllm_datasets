# Environment
- **Windows Build Number:** Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.18362.418]
- **Windows Terminal Version (if applicable):** All

# Steps to Reproduce
1. Open Notepad and type the following characters with linefeeds:
   ```
   a
   b
   c
   d
   e
   ```
2. Copy the text.
3. Open Windows Terminal and launch WSL by typing `wsl` and pressing Enter.
4. Use the `cat` command to write the copied text into a new file named `test.txt`:
   ```sh
   hez2010@DESKTOP-CD2C52F:~$ cat > test.txt
   a
   b
   c
   d
   e
   f
   ```

# Actual Behavior
When you view the contents of `test.txt`, each linefeed is repeated twice, resulting in extra blank lines between each character. The output looks like this:
```sh
PS C:\Users\hez20> wsl
hez2010@DESKTOP-CD2C52F:/mnt/c/Users/hez20$ cd ~
hez2010@DESKTOP-CD2C52F:~$ cat > test.txt
a

b

c

d

e

f
```

Each linefeed was duplicated, causing an additional blank line after each character.
