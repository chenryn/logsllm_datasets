will get smaller due to b3 = b6. As a result, the fraction will get
smaller. Similarly, if the sliding window has passed the starting
point, the denominator will get larger due to c2 (cid:2) c5, the numerator
will get smaller due to c1 = c4. As a result, the fraction will also get
smaller. Therefore, only when the sliding window exactly arrives at
the starting point of the frame, (9) has the maximum value. Fig. 8(b)
shows an experiment result of the variation of sliding window val-
ues with different window positions. The red point denotes the
starting point of the frame, which demonstrates the high precision
of our method.
4.3.2 Authorization Code Extraction. After finding the starting
point, every 160 sample points are grouped into a symbol pair.
Then, we extract the authorization code by checking the CP length
of each symbol pair. The distinguishability of four cases lie in Y1,
Y2 and Y3 (as shown in Fig. 7), we define the following equations to
distinguish the four cases,

th sample point of a symbol pair. For each received symbol pair,
we calculate the value of these four equations. Which one has the
minimum value among these four equations, the embedded bits of
authorization code are just the corresponding case. From (10)–(13),
we can find that the values of sample points in the numerator are
almost identical to each other, so their difference will be close to
zero. However, the value of the denominator is relatively large, so
the value of the whole equation will be close to 0 if the received
symbol pair fits the case. In this way, we achieve the purpose of
authorization code decoding.
4.4 Detection Scheme Analysis
The previous subsection introduces the encoding/decoding process
with a set of given numbers in the parameter setting. In this subsec-
tion, we extend the above analysis into a general case and further
discuss the pros and cons of the parameter selection.
Formulation. The number of available CP pairs are adjustable
4.4.1
in the general case. For example, we can define 8 cases of symbol
pairs which with CP lengths {(9,23), (10,22),..., (16,16)} to denote 8
authorization codes 000-111. In this case, the CP lengths are chosen
from set A={9, 10, ..., 23}, which has 15 available values with an
interval of 1.
Suppose we define C cases of symbol pairs, in which the CP
length are chosen from set A={Lcp −(C−1)Δ, Lcp −(C−2)Δ, ..., Lcp +
(C − 1)Δ}, the delimiting process can be expressed as follows,
i = arg max

in which Lcp = 16 is the normal CP length in IEEE 802.11g, Δ is
the interval of elements in set A. Ls = 80 is the length of WiFi
symbol, Lf = 64 is the size of FFT operation, l1 ∈ [1, Ls − 2Lcp ],
l2 ∈ [1, Ls − Lcp − (C − 1)Δ]. For decoding, we have C equations to
estimate which case it is. The c-th equation is defined as (16):

4.4.2 Parameter Selection. The value of C and Δ cannot be too
large, otherwise, they will lead to insufficient CP length and cause
severe inter-symbol interference and a high BER. On the other
hand, the CP cannot be too long, which will slow down the data
rate. Thus, the CP length is usually designed as two to four times the
root-mean-square of delay spread. We use the following equation
[12] to evaluate the BER of 64-QAM OFDM system in Rayleigh
fading channel,

in which αM =
is the
SNR per bit. We also conduct a simulation in frequency selective
fading channel with 7 taps to measure the appropriate range of
CP length. Fig. 10(a) shows the change of BER with different CP
lengths and SNR. The BER decreases with the increase of CP length,
but when the CP length reaches 6, the BER no longer decreases.
Thus, the two curves (CP length=6 and 7) are overlapped with each
other. Fig. 10(b) shows a more explicit decrease of BER when the CP
length changes. If the value is large, the increase of CP length has a
significant effect on decreasing BER. It can be found that when CP
length increases from 6 to 7, the decrease of BER is nearly 0, which
means this process is meaningless in reducing BER.

old value, as long as the CP length is not less than 6, it will not
affect the BER of 64-QAM OFDM system.
In addition, we also study whether the dynamic CP length will
cause chip errors when a ZigBee device decodes the emulated signal.
We set C = 2, 4, 8, 16, where different C values mean the number
of available CP pairs and the range of CP lengths are different.
Experiment results show that the average chip error rates are: 7.3/32,
5.3/32, 8.7/32, 10.4/32, respectively, indicating C = 4 has the lowest
chip error rate. Note that as long as the number of wrong chips is
smaller than the fault-tolerant threshold of DSSS, the symbol can
be decoded correctly.
4.4.3 Overhead Discussion. In the aspect of overhead, the most
noticeable problem may be whether the encoding and decoding
processes can be done in real-time. Actually, they do not need to
be real-time. First, these two processes are performed on WiFi de-
vices (i.e. smartphone and detector) instead of IoT end devices. WiFi
devices usually have sufficient capability to complete the above cal-
culation task. Second, the authorization code is only embedded into
the preamble of a ZigBee packet instead of the whole packet, so the
sender doesn’t have to wait for the whole packet to be constructed.
Once the previous ZigBee command has been sent, the sender can
begin to prepare the preamble of the next command. When the
next command needs to be sent, the sender can concatenate the
preamble and the payload (i.e. the next command), then send it.
5 EXPERIMENT AND EVALUATION
In this section, we thoroughly investigate the feasibility of WEA, the
performance of the attacking process, as well as the effectiveness
of the defensive mechanism.
5.1 Feasibility of WEA
We conduct an experiment with a commercial off-the-shelf Osram
smart bulb [2] to demonstrate the feasibility of WEA. As shown in
Fig. 11(a), we use a WiFi-based USRP to turn on the ZigBee bulb
(the “TURNING ON” command has been overheard in advance) and
repeat this experiment in different positions, as given in Fig. 11(d),
where S is the location of the sender, R1-R5 are the locations of the
receiver.
We find that the emulated signal has a significant advantage
in the attacking range. In all non-line-of-sight (NLOS) cases (R1,
R2, R3, R5), the emulated signal can turn on the light whereas the
ZigBee signal cannot. This is because the signal power of ZigBee
devices is usually lower than that of WiFi devices. In the line-of-
sight (LOS) case (R4), both the emulated signal and the ZigBee
signal can turn on the light. Fig. 11(e) shows the symbol error rate
(SER) and packet error rate (PER) at each location, it can be seen
that the SER and PER of ZigBee signal are significantly higher than
that of the emulated signal.
We also implement the WEA on LG Nexus 5 and do the indoor
and outdoor experiments. Fig. 11(b) shows the structure of our
equipment. It consists of a ZigBee launchPad CC26x2R, a relay, and
a 110V light bulb. When the “TURNING ON” command is detected
by the launchpad, it triggers a high level to the I/O output D100,
which enables the relay to turn on the bulb. The smartphone works
in the central frequency 2412MHz whereas CC26x2R centered on
2407MHz. For the indoor experiment, we measure the SER and
PER under different distances. The results are shown in Table 1.
For the outdoor experiment, the smartphone can even turn on the
light bulb at a distance of 100m (as shown in Fig. 11(c)). Both of the
experiment results indicate that WiFi has a better performance in
launching WEA.

In this subsection, we carry out two experiments, where the first
one evaluates whether the attacker can decode the eavesdropped
signal correctly, and the second one evaluates whether the attacker
can emulate the eavesdropped signal accurately. We conduct both
simulation experiments and field experiments. Simulation experi-
ments are based on GNU Radio and field experiments are based on
USRP.
Signal Eavesdropping. We focus on the impact of different en-
5.2.1
vironmental factors, such as channel model, distance, transmission
power, and SNR. Each time the ZigBee device sends 100 packets,
each of which includes 64 symbols. Meanwhile, we measure the
SER and PER at the eavesdropper side.
