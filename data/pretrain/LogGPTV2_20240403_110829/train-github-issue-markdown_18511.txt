Julia has kick ass features for computation.  
However what is the point of computing so much if the data cannot be
visualized/inspected ?
Current 2d plotting capabilities are nice, but no real matlab/scilab/scipy
competitor would be credible without some kind of 3d plotting.
One way of going would be to "port" mayavi to Julia.  
http://github.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/auto/examples.html
Mayavi builds on top of VTK, so the 3d system itself would not be reinvented
from scratch.
I think this would be relevant feature to have for release 2.0...
ps: 2d or 3d plotting systems in Julia should have SVG/PDF output, so it can
be used in scientific publishing...
