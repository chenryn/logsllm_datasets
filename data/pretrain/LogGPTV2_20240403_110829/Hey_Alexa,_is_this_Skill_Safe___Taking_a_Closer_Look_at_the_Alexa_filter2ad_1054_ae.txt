accounts (the remaining four cases were internally handled) —
favoring the original spelling of a word (‘snake facts’ instead
of ‘snek facts’). For the word-spacing variants, the joint words
succeeded in ﬁve cases. Only for the case of ‘world war two
facts,’ the variant with the additional space between ‘worldwar’
was preferred. These behaviors were consistent across both the
accounts.
Finding 6: Certain approaches within each skill-squatting
pattern have a higher likelihood of successfully squatting
skills. For the different spelling types and homophones, we
saw that correct/accepted spelling increased the likelihood of
launching the expected skill over its variants with additional
or altered letters. However, for punctuation appropriate
usage reduced its chance of being activated. And for word-
spacing, joint words succeeded most of the time.
VII. PRIVACY POLICY ANALYSIS OF SKILLS
In this section, we answer RQ3: Is the requirement of a
providing privacy policy link effective? Given that skills can
register to collect a wide range of personal data, analyzing to
what extent skills explicitly address such data in their privacy
policies is an important issue. We are the ﬁrst to study whether
privacy policies of skills consistently disclose the data accessed
and are compliant to existing regulations. We ﬁrst highlight
the prevalence of privacy policies in the different skill stores
as not all skills are mandated to provide a privacy policy
(Section VII-A). Next, we study the efﬁcacy of the mandating
privacy policies for skills requesting one or more permissions
(Section VII-B).

found that among all skills that provide a policy link around
2.9 % of them were not reachable in the US skill store. We even
found a skill (B07DZT5YX9) with a policy link that pointed
to “ﬁle://”, referencing a document on the developers local
machine. This indicates that Alexa, at times, is not properly
vetting the privacy policy links.
The skill store allows us to browse available skills by
categories which is same in all countries. Table IX lists the
different categories and highlights the number of US skills
in each category along with the percentage of skills that have
privacy policies for each category. From Table IX, we see that a
vast majority (93.7 %) of skills belonging to the ‘smart home’
category provide a privacy policy, followed by skills in the
‘connected car’ category. The categories that contain the least
portion of skills with privacy policies include: ‘game & trivia’,
‘novelty & humor’ and ‘education & reference’ and ‘kids’.
Amazon enables skill developers to provide a privacy
policy link addressing how data from end-users is collected
and used. However, Amazon does not mandate a privacy policy
for all skills, rather only for skills that request access to one or
more of their permission APIs. We, therefore, ﬁrst analyze the
availability of privacy policy links in the US skill store. We
found that around 28.5% of the US skills provide a privacy
policy link (see Table IX), which is similar to what Alhadlaq
et al. [8] reported back in 2017, when they found that around
25% skills out 11,827 skills provided a privacy policy link. We
From a legal perspective, two categories are especially
interesting: (1) the ‘kids’ category offering skills targeted
towards children, and (2) the ‘health and ﬁtness’ category that
lists skills with medial facts or other health related services.
Both COPPA [1] and EU’s GDPR [2] require that consent
be given by parents before kids interact with online services.
Since Amazon is aware of this regulation, skill developers have
to indicate if this skill is — “Directed to children under the age
of 13 for the United States, as determined under the Children’s
Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)”. Hints for developers

that help them decide whether or not their skills fall under
this category are — “presence of child-oriented activities and
incentives” and the “intended audience for the skill”. If this
box is checked, Alexa requires the skills to be enabled through
the Alexa companion app, assuming the app is installed on
the smartphone owned by the parent (who veriﬁes herself as
an adult by registering a credit card). Besides this one time
consent, there are no further restrictions on kids’ skills.
Finding 7: In the US skill store only 13.6 % of skills
belonging to the ‘kids’ category provide a privacy policy.
Interestingly, Amazon does not mandate a privacy policy
for skills targeted towards children under the age of 13. The
prevalence of privacy policies is somewhat higher for ‘health
and ﬁtness’ related skills (42.2 %). As privacy advocates we
feel both ‘kid’ and ‘health’ related skills should be held to
higher standards with respect to data privacy. The FTC is
also closely observing skills in the ‘kids’ category for poten-
tial COPPA violations [26]. Research has provided evidence
that guardians would also appreciate stricter controls [36].
B. Efﬁcacy of Privacy Policy Requirement
Skills by default are not required to have any accompanying
privacy policies. However, any skill requesting one or more
permissions must have an accompanying privacy policy for it
to be ofﬁcially available in the skill store. While there are
different legal constraints (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) in different
geographic locations, the developer console does not have
different requirements for developers in different countries
(we veriﬁed this from both US and EU locations). Users
enabling these skills must grant permission to these APIs
upon activation. These permissions can make interaction with
a skill much richer, e.g., a weather app with access to device
address would know which location’s weather to report
when asked. The full list of permissions can be found in
Table X, which shows the number of skills requesting dif-
ferent permissions. While the distribution of the permissions
requested across various skill stores is different, we see that
device address is prominently requested across all stores.
Figure 7 highlights the number of skills that request one or
more permissions across various skill categories. We see that
categories such as ‘shopping’, ‘music and audio’, ‘business

and ﬁnance’, ‘education and reference’ and ‘lifestyle’ con-
tain more skills that request access to different permissions.
These categories of skills typically request access to device
address and postal code. Interestingly, even though
Amazon mandates developers to provide a privacy policy
link when accessing these permission APIs (notification
and reminder being the only exceptions), we found some
instances (highlighted in bold in Table X) where privacy policy
links were missing.
Moreover, out of the 1,464 US skills requesting some
form of permissions, 41 did not provide a policy link as they
were requesting either the notification or reminder
permission. For the remaining 1,423 skills we found that 1,285
skills (90%) provide a link posting content relevant to a privacy
policy. We manually vetted all these privacy policies for this
analysis. However, such process can be automated and to
demonstrate that we designed a classiﬁer to determine if the
content of a privacy policy link was actually referring to a
privacy policy. For this purpose, we manually vetted 1000
Android privacy policies [57] and 1000 non-privacy policy
contents collected from blogging sites [45], Wikipedia and
news articles [29]. We extracted TF-IDF of uni-grams and
bi-grams from the text (ﬁrst converting the text to lowercase
and then removing all English stop words), and then used the
TF-IDF features to train a SVM classiﬁer (using ‘sigmoid’
kernel). Using 5-fold cross-validation we were able to obtain
99.8% precision and recall (accuracy was also around 99.8%).
We then tested the privacy policies of skills requesting one

a privacy policy. The classiﬁer had a precision and recall of
99.5% and 98.5%, respectively.
Finding 8: 90% of the US skills requesting one or more
permissions actually provide a valid privacy policy. The
remaining 10% policy links mostly result in page not found,
