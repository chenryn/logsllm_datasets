Question: "A web application uses Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to allow certain cross-domain requests. Which of the following CORS configurations could potentially introduce security vulnerabilities?"
 "A": "The application sets the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to a specific domain that the application expects to receive requests from."
 "B": "The application uses a wildcard in the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header indicating all domains are allowed."
 "C": "The application includes the Access-Control-Allow-Credentials header with a value of 'true' and sets the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to the requesting domain, not a wildcard."
 "D": "The server implements a check to validate the Origin request header against a list of allowed domains before sending the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header."
Answer: B
