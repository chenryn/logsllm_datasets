Accounts, the user can choose which speciﬁc account

introduced by the linkability service is also marginal. It
only occurs when apps access certain OS-level informa-
tion or conduct cross-app IPCs. These sensitive oper-
ations happened rather infrequently — once every 12.7
seconds during our experiments. These results suggest
that LinkDroid has limited impact on system perfor-
mance and usability.
We found that after applying LinkDroid, the Global
Linking Ratio (GLR) dropped from 81% to 21%. Fig. 13
shows the breakdown of linkability drop in different cat-
egories of sources. The majority of the remaining link-
ability comes from inter-app communications, most of
which are genuine from the user’s perspective. Not only
fewer apps are linkable, LinkDroid also makes it harder
for an adversary to aggregate information from two link-
able apps. The Global Linking Effort (GLE) increases
signiﬁcantly after applying LinkDroid: from 0.22 to
0.68. Speciﬁcally, the percentage of apps that are directly
linkable to Facebook dropped from 86% to 18%. Fig. 15
gives an illustrative example of how DLG changes after
applying LinkDroid. We also noticed that that the effec-
tiveness of LinkDroid differs across users, as shown in
Fig. 14. In general, LinkDroid is more effective for the
users who have diverse mobility patterns, are cautious
about sharing information across apps and/or maintain

different accounts for different services.
LinkDroid takes VPN as a plug-in solution to ob-
fuscate network identiﬁers. The potential drawback of
using VPN is its inﬂuence on device energy consump-
tion and network latency. We measured the device en-
ergy consumption of using VPN on a Samsung Galaxy 4
device, with Monsoon Power Monitor. Speciﬁcally, we
tested two network-intensive workloads: online videos
and browsing. We observed a 5% increase in energy con-
sumption for the ﬁrst workload, and no observable dif-
ference for the second. To measure the network latency,
we measured the ping time (average of 10 trials) to Alexa
Top 20 domains and found a 13% increase (17ms). These
results indicate that the overhead of using VPN on smart-
phone device is noticeable but not signiﬁcant. Seven of
13 participants in our evaluation were willing to use VPN

We interviewed the 13 participants after the experi-
ments. Questions are designed on a scale of 1 to 5 and
a score of 4 or higher is regarded as “agree.” Eleven of
the participants ﬁnd the UI prompt informative and clear
and nine are willing to use LinkDroid on a daily basis
to inform them about the risk and provide opt-out op-
tions. However, these responses might not be represen-
tative due to the limited size and diversity of the partic-
ipants. We also noticed that users care a lot about the
linkability of sensitive apps, such as Snapchat and Face-
book. Some participants clearly state that they do not
want any app to be associated with the Facebook app,
except for very necessary occasions. This also supports
the rationale behind the design of LinkDroid’s unlink-
able mode.
6 Related Work
There have been other proposals [7, 17] which also ad-
dress the privacy threats of information aggregation by
mobile apps. They shift the responsibility of informa-
tion personalization and aggregation from mobile apps
to the mobile OS or trusted cloud providers, requiring
re-development of mobile apps and extensive modiﬁ-
cations on the entire mobile ecosystem.
In contrast,
LinkDroid is a client-side solution which is compati-
ble with existing ecosystem — it focuses on character-
izing the threat in current mobile ecosystem and making
a practical trade-off, instead of proposing new computa-
tion (advertising) paradigm.
Existing studies investigated linkability under several
domain-speciﬁc scenarios. Arvind et al. [19] showed
that a user’s proﬁle in Netﬂix can be effectively linked
to his in IMDB, using long-tailed (unpopular) movies.
Sebastian et al. [16] described how to link the proﬁles of
the same user in different social networks using friends
topologies. This type of linkability is restricted to a small
scope, and may only exist across different apps in the
same domain. Here, we focus on the linkability that are
domain-independent and ubiquitous to all apps, regard-
less of the type and semantics of each app.
The capability of advertising agency on conducting
proﬁling and aggregation has been extensively stud-
ied [12, 23]. Various countermeasures have been pro-
posed, such as enforcing ﬁner-grained isolation between
ad library and the app [21, 22], or adopting a privacy-
preserving advertising paradigm [4]. However, unlike
LinkDroid, they only consider a very speciﬁc and re-
stricted scenario — advertising library — which in-
volves few functional trade-offs. LinkDroid, instead,
introduces a general linkability model, considers various
sources of linkability and suits a diverse set of adver-
saries.
There have also been numerous studies on informa-
tion access control on smartphone [6, 8, 9, 13, 14, 20, 24].
Many of these studies have already proposed to provide
apps with fake identiﬁers and other types of sensitive in-
formation [13, 20, 27]. These studies focus on the ex-
plicit privacy concern of accessing and leaking sensi-
tive user information, by malicious mobile apps or third-
party libraries. Our work addresses information access
control from a very different perspective, investigating
the implicit linkability introduced by accessing various
OS-level information and IPC channels.
Many modern browsers provide a private (incognito)
mode. These are used to defend against local attackers,
such as users sharing the same computer, from stealing
cookies or browse history from each other [2]. This is
inherently different from LinkDroid’s unlinkable mode
which targets unregulated aggregation by remote attack-
ers.
7 Discussion
In this paper, we proposed a new metric, linkability, to
quantify the ability of different apps to link and aggre-
gate their usage behaviors. This metric, albeit useful, is
only a coarse upper-bound of the actual privacy threat,
especially in the case of IPCs. Communication between
two apps does not necessarily mean that they have con-
ducted, or are capable of conducting, information aggre-
gation. However, deciding on the actual intention of each
IPC is by itself a difﬁcult task. It requires an automatic
and extensible way of conducting semantic introspection
on IPCs, and is a challenging research problem on its
own.
LinkDroid aims to reduce the linkability introduced
covertly without the user’s consent or knowledge —
it couldn’t and doesn’t try to eliminate the linkability
explicitly introduced by users. For example, a user
may post photos of himself or exhibit very identiﬁ-
able purchasing behavior in two different apps,
thus
establishing linkability.
This type of linkability is
app-speciﬁc, domain-dependent and beyond the control
of LinkDroid.
Identiﬁability or linkability of these
domain-speciﬁc usage behaviors are of particular inter-
est to other areas, such as anonymous payment [25],
anonymous query processing [18] and data anonymiza-
tion techniques.
The list of identifying information we considered in
this paper is well-formatted and widely-used. These
ubiquitous identiﬁers contribute the most to informa-
tion aggregation, since they are persistent and consis-
tent across different apps. We didn’t consider some un-
common identiﬁers, such as walking patterns and mi-
crophone signatures, because we haven’t yet observed
any real-world adoption of these techniques by commer-

cial apps. However, LinkDroid can easily include other
types of identifying information, as long as a clear deﬁ-
nition is given.
DLG introduces another dimension — linkability —
to privacy protection on mobile OS and has some other
potential usages. For example, when the user wants to
perform a certain task in Android and has multiple op-
tional apps, the OS can recommend him to choose the
app which is the least linkable with others. We also
noticed some interesting side-effect of LinkDroid’s un-
linkable mode. Since unlinkable mode allows users to
enjoy ﬁner-grained (session-level) unlinkability, it can be
used to stop a certain app from continuously identifying a
user. This can be exploited to infringe the beneﬁts of app
developers in the case of copyright protection, etc. For
example, NYTimes only allows an unregistered user to
read up to 10 articles every month. However, by restart-
ing the app in unlinkable mode in each session, a user
can stop NYTimes from linking himself across different
sessions and bypass this quota restriction.
8 Conclusion
In this paper, we addressed the privacy threat of unreg-
ulated aggregation from a new perspective by monitor-
ing, characterizing and reducing the underlying linka-
bility across apps. This allows us to measure the po-
tential threat of unregulated aggregation during runtime
and promptly warn users of the associated risks. We ob-
served how real-world apps abuse OS-level information
and IPCs to establish linkability, and proposed a prac-
tical countermeasure, LinkDroid. It provides runtime
monitoring and mediation of linkability across apps, in-
troducing a new dimension to privacy protection on mo-
bile device. Our evaluation on real users has shown that
LinkDroid is effective in reducing the linkability across
apps and only incurs marginal overheads.
