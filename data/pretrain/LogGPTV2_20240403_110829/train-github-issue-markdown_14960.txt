**Current behavior**  
See API guide for `ContentChild`.
The example in that guide page attempts to illustrate `ContentChild` by
showing a **directive** that extracts child content.
How does a directive - which lacks a template - extract child content (or a
child view)? From what? The example itself is unclear, perhaps nonsense?
It did reveal that `ngAfterContent...` and `ngAfterView...` hooks are called
on a directive. **Why?** How would I use them?
This all came up in an issue filed in `angular.io` about our lifecycle hook
documentation where I asserted that these hooks really don't apply to
directives.
I replied with some sample code there ... code that is a slight tweak of that
documentation chapter's plunker.
Can elaborate if need be.
