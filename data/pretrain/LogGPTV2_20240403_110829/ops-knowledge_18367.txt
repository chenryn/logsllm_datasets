Assistant: This log chunk shows the process of running tasks in stage 29.0. It begins with the PythonRunner reporting times for tasks 25.0, 28.0, 27.0, and 26.0. Then, tasks 1350, 1351, 1352, 1353, and 1354 are assigned and run. Finally, task 29.0 is finished and blocks rdd_42_30 and rdd_42_32 are found locally.
