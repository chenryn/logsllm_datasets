User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Do thin-clients need antivirus? I've just taken over as IT Manager in an environment where most of the end-users are using HP-based Win7 thin clients (approx 50 seats) to access a remote desktop server.

All the servers &amp; fat clients on site are protected with ESET Endpoint Antivirus, however I notice none of the thin clients have any type of AV enabled.

A brief Google search doesn't show much interest in securing these little beasties.  Should I look into a lightweigh AV system for these, or are they fine?

UPDATE: 

These thin clients are HP T510's, running Windows 7 Standard Embedded.  They don't seem to be using PXE Boot - by the look of it, each has its' own Windows OS which presents them with a local desktop on boot.  This desktop has a RDP connection, which they use to access the main server.

The Remote Desktop server does have antivirus on it, but there's no indication that the thin client is collecting anything from the server directly.

They don't have any browser available on the local OS, but I would be unsuprised if that's just a result of the previous IT folks simply hiding applications.

These machines aren't joined to the AD domain, and log in automatically, however it seems they aren't logged in with any admin rights.

Assistant: It might depend on your definition of "thin client".

The thin clients I know download just enough from the server to do their job, and that includes things like programs. As such, they will download the installed AV package from the server. In this way, the thin client itself doesn't need one, because it "borrows" it from the server.

If the server that serves the thin clients does not have AV, then you've got a problem.
