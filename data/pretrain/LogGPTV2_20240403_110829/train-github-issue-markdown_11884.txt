I'd like to implement an alternative jump to file that uses a custom matching
algorithm. Is this possible, or is the extension API too limited to do this?
The closest thing seems to be the quickpick api, and it falls short. Perhaps
`QuickPickItem` could be allowed to implement a
`matches(input:string):boolean` method?
