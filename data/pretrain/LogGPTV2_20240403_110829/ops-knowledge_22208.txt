User: I would like to edit the value of a StringListProperty variable on App Engine. Is it possible? I don't see any sign of editable field for a StringListProperty variable right inside the DataViewer panel.
Assistant: You need to edit it programmatically. Not all property types can be edited in the data viewer.
