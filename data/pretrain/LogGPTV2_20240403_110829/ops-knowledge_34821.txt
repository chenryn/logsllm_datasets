User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Updating group without log out or subshell I'm trying to run Docker on Elastic MapReduce streaming but am having trouble with a permissions issue.  In my bootstrap script, I need the "hadoop" user to be part of the "docker" group (as described on the AWS Docker Basics page):

sudo usermod -a -G docker hadoop


but I cannot log out or spawn a subshell (with newgrp).  Is there a way to force the group setting to take effect in my current shell session?

Assistant: No - unless the hadoop process is running as root, then you could do some gdb trickery to change the EUID, but not the group. But I guess that won't help in your case.

What could help is to temporarily allow the hadoop user access to the files that are meant for the docker group to be accessed.

Example: the hadoop user needs write-access to the /foo directory, but only the docker group can currently write it:


$ ls -ld /foo/
drwxrwx--- 2 root docker 4096 Mar 10 00:42 /foo/


Most file systems support ACLs nowadays:


$ sudo setfacl -m g:docker:rwx /foo


Now the hadoop user will be able to write to /foo.

I know, that's not what you asked, but since there's no possibility to change the EGID of a running process, maybe it works the other way around with the help of ACLs.
