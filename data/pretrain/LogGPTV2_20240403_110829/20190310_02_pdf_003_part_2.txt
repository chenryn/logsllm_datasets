Indexes
In order to provide optimal performance for the wide range of supported data types and new workloads
utilizing those data types, the database must also support a wide variety of indexes. EDB Postgres
Advanced Server is somewhat unique in this regard, especially its GiST index which allows for easy
development of specialized indexes for new data types.

SQL Capabilities
Postgres Advanced Server strongly conforms to the ANSI-SQL:2008 standard. It also has Transactional
DDL which supports backing out even large changes to DDL, such as table creation. While you can’t
recover from an add/drop on a database or tablespace, all other catalog operations are reversible. This
feature is often used for protection when doing complicated work like schema upgrades. If you put all
such changes into a transaction block, you can make sure they all apply atomically or not at all. This
drastically lowers the possibility that the database will be corrupted by a typo or other such error in the
schema change, which is particularly important when you’re modifying multiple related tables where a
mistake might destroy the relational key.

High Availability
Mission-critical workloads must remain operational at all times and have little tolerance for even planned
downtime for maintenance. This demand for high availability requires solutions that provide high speed
replication and redundancy to eliminate single points of failure in the system; failure detection and
automated failover to ensure systems continue to function in the event of a breakdown in the system;
and data and system recovery to assist DBAs following failure events.

Performance / Scalability
Database operations may be optimized through various means to deliver higher performance.
Connection pooling, for example, refers to a common way of maintaining open connections to
the database for applications that repeatedly make requests as opposed to having to create new
connections each time. Data replication can increase performance by making information simultaneously
available to multiple end-user applications. These performance enhancements can be achieved through
database enhancements and various external complementary solutions.

Integration
Today’s data centers commonly consist of one or more relational and many non-relational database
solutions deployed to handle specific workloads based on data type and application. Relational
databases utilize a range of mechanisms for connecting to other like and dissimilar database solutions
across the infrastructure in order to connect data from multiple sources and create a cohesive data
fabric. In some cases, the database is engineered with specific capabilities that enhance data
integration. Database vendors also develop adaptors that enable their database to connect with
other vendor solutions.

Application Development
Databases are a foundation of today’s data-driven enterprise, and applications are increasingly
data-intensive. Vendors in turn work to continually enhance their database solutions to support the
needs of application developers, who seek the flexibility to make choices and simple ways for executing
complex tasks. For example, databases that can provide support for multiple server-side languages for
triggers, functions, and stored procedures give developers the option to choose their language for both
client, middle tier and database server programming. Object oriented capabilities like user-defined
object types allow the database to store real world representations of data thus making development
easier, quicker, and more understandable.
