## Indexes

To provide optimal performance for a wide range of supported data types and new workloads, the database must support a variety of indexes. EDB Postgres Advanced Server is unique in this regard, particularly with its GiST index, which allows for the easy development of specialized indexes for new data types.

## SQL Capabilities

Postgres Advanced Server strongly conforms to the ANSI-SQL:2008 standard and includes Transactional DDL, which supports backing out even large changes to DDL, such as table creation. While you cannot recover from an add/drop on a database or tablespace, all other catalog operations are reversible. This feature is often used for protection during complex work like schema upgrades. By placing all changes into a transaction block, you ensure they apply atomically or not at all, reducing the risk of corruption due to typos or other errors, especially when modifying multiple related tables where a mistake might destroy the relational key.

## High Availability

Mission-critical workloads require high availability, with minimal tolerance for even planned downtime. High availability solutions must provide high-speed replication and redundancy to eliminate single points of failure, failure detection and automated failover, and data and system recovery to assist DBAs following failure events.

## Integration

Modern data centers often consist of multiple relational and non-relational databases. Relational databases use various mechanisms to connect with other databases, enabling the creation of a cohesive data fabric. In some cases, the database is engineered with specific capabilities to enhance data integration, and vendors develop adaptors to enable their databases to connect with other vendor solutions.

## Application Development

Databases are a foundation of today's data-driven enterprises, and application developers seek flexibility and simple ways to execute complex tasks. Databases that support multiple server-side languages for triggers, functions, and stored procedures give developers the option to choose their preferred language for client, middle tier, and database server programming. Object-oriented capabilities, such as user-defined object types, allow the database to store real-world representations of data, making development easier, quicker, and more understandable.
