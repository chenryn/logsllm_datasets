6.3 Issues in Implementation and Execution
Computational Complexity. Let imax denote the maximum original
ﬂow length whose frequency is to be estimated. Tabulation of the
binomial coefﬁcients for the iteration is O(i2
max). Let jsize denote
the number of non-zero sampled ﬂow length frequencies gj to be
employed. Then each EM iteration is O(imaxjsize).
Maximum Sampled Flow Length. In the algorithm, all indices j for
which there were sampled ﬂows of length j (i.e. for which gj > 0)
were included in the iteration. However, the tails of sampled data
sets often exhibit lengths j for which there is only one or a handful
of sampled ﬂows, and which are isolated in the sense that that there
are no neighboring lengths j with gj > 0. In some cases there will
be many such ﬂows, even though they represent a small proportion
of all ﬂows. Computational complexity of the iteration can be re-
duced by removing all sampled ﬂows above a certain length jmax,
instead treating them with the simple scaling method.
For the general ﬂow estimator (cid:5)f (4), jmax can be chosen as fol-
lows. Consider sampling the packets of an original ﬂow of length
N j independently with probability 1/N. The average length of
the sampled ﬂow is j, and the probability that no packet is sam-
pled is (1 − 1/N )Nj ≈ e
−j. Thus if simple scaling is applied
to all ﬂows of length greater than j, the likely error in estimat-
−j.
ing the total number of corresponding original ﬂows is about e
Thus for a given target proportionate error ε, we can choose any
jmax ≥ j(ε) = (cid:19)log(1/ε)(cid:20). For example, j(10%) = 3 and
j(1%) = 5. On the other hand, there may be reliable sampled
frequencies at lengths longer than j(ε), and these should not be
excluded from the iteration. We now discuss criteria for reliability.
Criteria for Use of Sampled Frequencies. The examples discussed
toward the end of Section 1.1 show that no inference method can
be expected to conjure the true distribution out of thin data. At very
high sampling rates, the distribution of sampled ﬂow lengths tends
to degenerate onto length 1, with relatively small weight at higher
lengths. Conversely, substantially different distributions of original
ﬂow lengths may be distinguished by only small differences in the
sampled frequencies. For this reason, the frequencies included in
the iteration should have some reliability attached to them.
A basic criterion is that they should be distinguishable from 0.
We view a small sampled frequency gj as a variable that arose from
a Poisson distribution whose mean is estimated by gj. We can say
that gj is distinguishable from 0 at signiﬁcance level ε if the proba-
bility that gj would have been zero under the Poisson distribution is
−gj  jmax.
Comparison of Iterative Methods for TCP. Here, either of the esti-
mators (cid:5)f (3) and (cid:5)f (4) can be used. Being based on measured SYN
ﬂows, (cid:5)f (3) is expected to provide better estimates of the total num-

ber of inferred ﬂows. One the other hand, it makes use of less data,
using only the sampled SYN ﬂows; for this reason the frequency
7. EVALUATION AND COMPARISON
In this section we apply the estimators derived in the previous
section to experimental trafﬁc traces.
Inference is performed on
ﬂow statistics derived from sampled version of the traces, and com-
pared with the unsampled ﬂow statistics of the original traces. We
compare different estimators applied to the same trace. We use the
weighted mean relative difference as a measure of estimation accu-
racy. In most cases the inferred distributions are accurate to within
a few percent. We expect this will be sufﬁciently accurate for many
networking applications.
7.1 Data Considerations
In this section we evaluate performance of the estimators of ﬂow
length distributions on the trace datasets. We used the packet trace

subtraces were extracted from PEERING and CAMPUS as follows.
Only packets from the set of original TCP ﬂows (as delineated by
a key comprising source and destination IP address and port num-
bers, and a 30 second interpacket timeout) that started with a SYN
packets. This was done primarily to eliminate edge effects: since
the traces were collected by packet monitors, SYN packets from
ﬂows that started before trace collection commenced will not be
present in the trace. This is particularly important for the PEERING
trace, whose length 37 minutes, is comparable with the duration of
some longer ﬂows in the trace. Restricting the original packet data
to ﬂows starting with a SYN packet eliminated 56% of TCP in the
(shorter) PEERING trace, and 15% in the (longer) CAMPUS trace.
Our characterization of this as an edge effect, rather than deviation
from expected TCP behavior, is supported by the fact that in the
trace FLOW of NetFlow statistics, the proportion of TCP ﬂows not
containing a SYN packet was negligible.
Flow splitting was not corrected for, so that original ﬂows may
give rise to multiple measured ﬂows. We ﬁnd below that the es-
timators perform well despite imperfect conformance with the as-
sumptions underlying Sections 4 and 6.
7.2 Scaling-based Estimators: (cid:5)f (1) and (cid:5)f (2)

sampling periods N. Packet sampling was performed using deter-
ministic sampling of the original packet stream. Some typical out-
comes are displayed in Figure 3, which shows inferred and actual
ﬂow length frequencies for the CAMPUS dataset. The right ﬁgure
uses the estimator (cid:5)f (1) for sampling periods N = 10, 30 and 100.
Observe that whereas the inferred frequencies are clearly distin-
guishable from the actual frequencies due to their stepwise nature,
the broad features are similar. At short ﬂow lengths, the manage-
ment of the widths of the ﬁrst two steps reﬂects well the distribution
of short ﬂow lengths. Without these manipulations, too little weight
would have been attached to the shorter ﬂow lengths. Note that the
original distribution has a strong peak at length 5; we cannot hope
to distinguish the frequencies of lengths shorter than this using only
the weights of the ﬁrst two steps once N grows much larger than 5.
Thus our approach to allocating weights evenly over the ﬁrst two
intervals represents a conservative use of the information available.
The left hand plot in Figure 3 compares the two estimators (cid:5)f (1)
and (cid:5)f (2) at sampling period N = 30. Observe (cid:5)f (1) more closely
captures the peak of the actual frequencies at length 5. (cid:5)f (2) is

we calculated the weighted mean relative difference of each in-
ferred frequencies with the actual frequencies. This was done block-
wise, in the sense that for each comparison, the frequencies to be
compared were aggregated over the piecewise constant blocks of
the scaling-based distribution before the WMRD was calculated.
This enables us to factor out the smoothing from the comparison,
so comparing the effects of the different choice of block bound-
aries. The WMRD values are shown in Table 3. This shows (cid:5)f (2)
to be uniformly better than (cid:5)f (1) in predicting the block weights.
(As remarked above, (cid:5)f (1) better captures the peak frequency). The
percent error for (cid:5)f (2) should be acceptable for use in many net-
absolute values of the WMRD look quite good. We expect the few

working applications. The WMRD of the unaggregated distributions
are shown in Table 4. The WMRD is substantially greater in the un-
aggregated case, since the smoothing of the inferred distribution
takes no account of distribution within blocks. Nonetheless, we
expect that discrepancies in the distribution of single ﬂow lengths
of roughly 20% may be acceptable for some applications. If only
coarser distributional information is required, Table 3 shows the
block aggregates to be considerably more accurate.
7.3 ML Estimation with the EM algorithm
7.3.1 Estimation of TCP ﬂow lengths: (cid:5)f (3)
To evaluate the TCP speciﬁc version of the EM estimator, (cid:5)f (3),
we returned to the CAMPUS and PEERING datasets. Using the ter-
mination criteria described in Section 6.3, 5 iterations were per-
formed for sampling period N = 10. The WMRD was 5.0% for
CAMPUS, noticeably better than the unaggregated WMRD for the
scaling based estimators reported in Table 4.
Accuracy was far worse with sampling period N = 100, with
WMRD about 50%. This is apparently due to insufﬁcient data. For
both datasets there are only a total of 100 sampled ﬂows of length
greater than 2, and at most 3 ﬂows of any individual length greater
than 3, and in both cases there were only 13 ﬂows of length 3.
