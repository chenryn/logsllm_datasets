User: I want to do some development on Python's distlib, and in the process run the code via virtualenv which has distlib as a dependency.
That is, not run the process inside a virtualenv, but run virtualenv's code using a custom dependency. What are the steps I need to go through to achieve this?
It seems to me that normal package management (pip) is not possible here.
Assistant: Surely the easiest way is simply to  modify your Python environment to search another directory where it will find your modified distlib before it picks it up from the stdlib? The classic way to do this is by setting your PYTHONPATH environment variable. No changes required to your Python installation!
