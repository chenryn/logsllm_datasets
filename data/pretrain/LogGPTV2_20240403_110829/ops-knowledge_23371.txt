To effectively implement CIS Control 7.6, which involves performing automated vulnerability scans of externally-exposed enterprise assets, an organization should follow these key procedures:

1. **Select a SCAP-Compliant Vulnerability Scanning Tool**: Choose a tool that is Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) compliant to ensure the scans are thorough and standardized.

2. **Schedule Regular Scans**: Conduct automated vulnerability scans on a monthly basis, or more frequently if the risk profile of the organization demands it. Regular scanning helps in identifying and addressing vulnerabilities promptly.

3. **Identify and Categorize Assets**: Focus on externally-exposed enterprise assets, such as web applications, network services, and other internet-facing systems. Clearly define and categorize these assets to ensure comprehensive coverage.

4. **Analyze and Prioritize Findings**: Review the results of the vulnerability scans, prioritize the identified vulnerabilities based on their severity and potential impact, and develop a plan to address them.

5. **Implement Remediation Measures**: Take appropriate actions to remediate the identified vulnerabilities, such as applying patches, updating configurations, or implementing additional security controls.

6. **Document and Report**: Maintain detailed records of the scans, findings, and remediation efforts. Regularly report the status of the vulnerability management process to relevant stakeholders, including senior management and IT teams.

CIS Control 7.6 is part of the "Identify" function within the CIS Controls framework, specifically targeting the asset type "Applications." By following these procedures, organizations can enhance their ability to detect and mitigate vulnerabilities in their externally-exposed assets, thereby improving overall security posture.
