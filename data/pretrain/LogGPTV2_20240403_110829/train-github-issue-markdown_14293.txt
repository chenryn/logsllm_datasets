I am using `launch.json` to debug .Net Core Application in VS code.  
Debugger configuration uses `"preLaunchTask": "build"` to build application
before starting, but the problem is that I have several projects in my
solution that I want to debug, so I have duplicated `launch.json`
configurations for every single executable project in my solution. With this
scenario `build` preLaunchTask is not working. I need to pass my project's
directory to `build` task.
Is there anyway to pass arguments to `preLaunchTask` from `launch.json`?
