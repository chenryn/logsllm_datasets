algorithms (i.e., PCFG-based [58] and Markov-based
[36]) to evaluate the strength of Chinese web passwords.
We further investigate whether the characteristics iden-
tiﬁed in Sec. 3.3 (e.g., dates and Pinyin names) can be
practically exploited to facilitate password guessing.
Necessity of pairing passwords by service type. There
are a number of confounding factors that impact pass-
word security, among which language, service type,
and password policy are the three most important ones
[29, 53, 56]. As shown in [36, 53], except for CSDN
that imposes a length 8+ policy, all our datasets (Table
1) reﬂect no explicit policy requirements. It has recently
been revealed that users often rationally choose robust
passwords for accounts perceived to be important [46],
while knowingly choose weak passwords for unimpor-
tant accounts [17]. Since accounts of the same service
would generally have the same level of value for users,
we divide datasets into three pairs according to their
types of services (i.e., Tianya vs. Rockyou, Dodonew
vs. Yahoo, and CSDN vs. Phpbb) for fairer strength
comparison, as opposed to existing works [7, 26, 34]
that do not take into account the site service type. We
emphasize that it is less reasonable if one compares
Dodonew passwords (from an e-commerce site) with
Phpbb passwords (from a low-value programmer forum):
Even if Dodonew passwords are stronger than Phpbb
passwords, one can not conclude that Chinese passwords
are more secure than English ones, because there is a
potential that Dodonew passwords will be weaker than
Yahoo e-commerce passwords.
4.1 PCFG-based attacks
The PCFG-based model [58] is one of the state-of-the-art
cracking models. Firstly, it divides all the passwords in a
training set into segments of similar character sequences
and obtains the corresponding base structures and their
associated probabilities of occurrence. For example,
“wanglei@123” is divided into the L segment “wanglei”,
S segment “@” and D segment “123”, resulting in a
base structure L7S1D3. The probability of L7S1D3 is
#of base structures. Such information is used to generate the
probabilistic context-free grammar.
#of L7S1D3
Then, one can derive password guesses in decreasing
order of probability. The probability of each guess is the
product of the probabilities of the productions used in its
derivation. For instance, the probability of “liwei@123”
is computed as P(“liwei@123”)= P(L5S1D3)· P(L5 →
liwei)· P(S1 → @)· P(D3 → 123). In Weir et al.’s original
proposal [58], the probabilities for D and S segments
are learned from the training set by counting, yet L
segments are handled either by learning from the training
set or by using an external input dictionary. Ma et al.
[36] revealed that PCFG-based attacks with L segments
directly learned from the training set generally perform
better than using an external input dictionary. Thus, we
prefer to instantiate the PCFG L segments of password
guesses by directly learning from the training set.
We divide the nine datasets into two groups by lan-
guage. For the Chinese group of test sets, we randomly
select 1M passwords from the Duowan dataset as the
training set (denoted by “Duowan 1M”). The reason is
that: Duowan has the least inversion number with the
dataset “All Chinese PWs” (see Sec. 3.3) and is likely to
best represent general Chinese web passwords. Similar-
ly, for the English test sets, we select 1M passwords from
Rockyou as the training set. Since we have only used
part of Duowan and Rockyou, their remaining passwords
and the other 7 datasets are used as the test sets. The
attacking results on the Chinese group and English group
are depicted in Fig. 4(a) and Fig. 4(b), respectively.
Bifacial-security. When the guess number (i.e., search
space size) allowed is below about 3,000, Chinese pass-
words are generally much weaker than English pass-
