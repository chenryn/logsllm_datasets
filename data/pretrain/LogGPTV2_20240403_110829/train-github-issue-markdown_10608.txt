I have successfully installed Ansible versions 1.8.1 and 1.9 without any issues. However, when I attempt to install Ansible 2.0 on a Linux system, I encounter the following error:

```bash
lrmk225:~/shared-webstorage/storage/hdfssvc/playbooks/build # ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.txt -f
ERROR! Could not open readme: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/usr/local/lib64/python2.6/site-packages/ansible-2.0.0-py2.6.egg/ansible/galaxy/data/readme'
```

To troubleshoot this, I tried creating an empty `readme` file in the specified location. This, however, resulted in a new error:

```bash
lrmk225:~/shared-webstorage/storage/hdfssvc/playbooks/build # ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.txt -f
ERROR! Could not open metadata_template.j2: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/usr/local/lib64/python2.6/site-packages/ansible-2.0.0-py2.6.egg/ansible/galaxy/data/metadata_template.j2'
```

Is this a known issue? Another individual in my organization reported it, and I was able to reproduce it on a different system.
