I have successfully installed Ansible 1.8.1 and 1.9 without difficulty. When I
attempt to install Ansible 2.0 on linux, I get the following:
    lrmk225:~/shared-webstorage/storage/hdfssvc/playbooks/build # ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.txt -f
    ERROR! Could not open readme: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/usr/local/lib64/python2.6/site-packages/ansible-2.0.0-py2.6.egg/ansible/galaxy/data/readme'
I tried creating an empty readme in this location, but that just shifts the
error to:
    lrmk225:~/shared-webstorage/storage/hdfssvc/playbooks/build # ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.txt -f
    ERROR! Could not open metadata_template.j2: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/usr/local/lib64/python2.6/site-packages/ansible-2.0.0-py2.6.egg/ansible/galaxy/data/metadata_template.j2'
Is this a known issue? This was reported to me by another individual in my
organization, and I duplicated it on a different system.
