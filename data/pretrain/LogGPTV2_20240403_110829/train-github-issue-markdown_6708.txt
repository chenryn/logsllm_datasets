**### Problem**  
As I used simpson in scipy, I found there some issue about it. Simpson's 1/3
rule use parabola eq. to approximate every curve in the segment, to determine
the parabola, it needs 3 points, so that is the constraint of 1/3 rule. It
just apply to odd number well, but inaccurate as the number is even.  
**### Solution**  
Combine 1/3 and 3/8 rule, so that simpson's rule apply every number of point.  
**### Result**
    import numpy as np
    from scipy.integrate import simps
    def f(x):
        return x**3
    x = np.linspace(1.0, 4.0, 20)
    y = f(x)
    a = simps(y,x)
    x = np.linspace(1.0, 4.0, 19)
    y = f(x)
    b = simps(y,x)
    print (a, b)
    correct result is 63.75
result1 should be more accurate than result2 because of the smaller h,  
but result1 = 63.7549, result2 = 63.7499  
I just write a C version and I uploaded it in my github, there is also the
derivation of simpson rule.
