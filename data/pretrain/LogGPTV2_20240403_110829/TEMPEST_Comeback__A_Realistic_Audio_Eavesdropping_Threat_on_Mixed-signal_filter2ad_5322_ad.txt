observe that the three devices (i.e., Sogou C1, Xiaomi YDLYEJ03LM,
and QCY Q29 Pro) show stronger radiation than other devices. The
strong emanations of the first two devices are explained with the
following circumstances. (a) Sogou’s C1 is a Power Type 1 device
whose internal power regulator is configured with SWREG only or
LDO only (refer to Table 3). Considering the 𝑓𝑆𝑊 𝑅𝐸𝐺_𝑛𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑒 (3.250
MHz) is clearly observable in Figure 21 of Appendix D, it seems that
there exists a strong SWREG noise all around the chipset. In other
words, one carrier source with 𝑓𝑆𝑊 𝑅𝐸𝐺_𝑛𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑒 has enough power
to be radiated. (b) the reason for the strong radiation of Xiaomi’s
YDLYEJ03LM seems to be the radiation efficiency due to its unique
shape. Unlike other target devices, which consist of two separate
lumped earpieces, the left and right earpieces of the device are elec-
trically connected with a line; this line generally plays an important
role in view of radiation of signals as a good antenna.
4.5 TEMPEST Attacks From a Distance Using
Antenna
In order to demonstrate that the new TEMPEST threat based on
the SWREG noise is effective in a practical environment, we try
to capture the emanated signals according to distance variations
with the same experimental setup as described in Subsection 4.3.
In this attack, the critical vulnerable metric is “the attack range,”
which is defined as the maximum distance that an attacker can sur-
reptitiously eavesdrop meaningful information from the unwanted
emanations. The “Single channel” column in Table 3 shows the
experimental attack range results at the highest USNR frequency
for each target. All the captured signals stored with “wav” format
are also available on the web link [12].
Considering the attack ranges as shown in Table 3 and the power
distributions of signal and noise as shown in Figure 21 of Appendix
D, it can be seen that the leakage power measured by the probe is
proportional to the attack range. In the devices having low leakage
power distributions, such as EO-MG900K and T1, no intelligible
information can be naturally obtainable in the remote situation
via the antennas. On the other hand, for Sogou C1 and Xiaomi
YDLYEJ03LM, we can acquire intelligible signals even at 10 meters
due to their strong emanation circumstances as described before.
5 COOPERATIVE RECONSTRUCTION FOR
INCREASE OF ATTACK RANGE
5.1 Advantages of Multi-radiated Frequency
Distribution
As described before, an audio signal via the ADC/DAC is unin-
tentionally radiated over a wide frequency range at intervals of
𝑓𝑆𝑊 𝑅𝐸𝐺_𝑛𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑒. Form an attacker’s point of view, these multiple
signals allow a good opportunity to attack in a practical noisy en-
vironment. First, even if the highest USNR signal is jammed by
commercially licensed bands, an attacker can capture an alternative
signal by simply altering the center frequency of USRP. Second,
since the multi-radiated signals are originated from a single audio
source, their similar signal characteristics make it possible for an
attacker to get a new strengthened signal by combining the multi-
radiated signals; in summary, an attacker naturally can try to get
a higher USNR signal if possible and achieve the increase of the
attack range.
5.2 An Example of Multi-radiated Signals
Figure 12(a)-12(d) show one example of the multiple radiated sig-
nals from the nRF52810-based C1 device. To get the radiated signals
simultaneously, the input bandwidth of USRP is changed to 50 MHz
whose operation frequency range is from 615 MHz to 665 MHz. Be-
cause 𝑓𝑆𝑊 𝑅𝐸𝐺_𝑛𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑒 of the C1 device is 3.24982 MHz, the maximum
number of receivable signals within the bandwidth (50 MHz) is
16; but only four signals are obtained by excluding jammed or low
USNR signals. Each figure also indicates the measured spurious-free
signal strength (SFSS), which is defined as the strength ratio of the
signal to the strongest spurious signal. In this example, the received
signal at 633.715 MHz has the highest SFSS value of 11.2 dB.

bined spectra according to the simple addition and the pro-
posed phase-aligned methods, respectively.

method based on phase-aligned signals for C1 device.
5.3 Proposed Spectral Addition of
Phase-aligned Signals
We first try to simply add all the four radiated signals. However,
because the signals are not coherent (i.e., the phases of the radiated
signals are different from each other as shown in Figure 12(a)-
12(d)), the SFSS value of the added signal (as shown in Figure 12(e))
is lowered to 5.1 dB. This noncoherent characteristic occurs due to
the difference between the coupling paths of the radiated signals.
Next, we propose a new approach to improve the signal by the
spectral addition of phase-aligned signals. Figure 13 shows the
block diagram of the proposed phase alignment approach based
on overlap-add (OLA) short-time fourier transform (STFT) [4]. For
each frame (20 milliseconds), all signals are processed according to
the following process: (a) each signal is multiplied by the triangular
window, (b) the time-domain windowed signals are transformed
into the frequency-domain signals by using the fast fourier trans-
form (FFT), (c) in the frequency-domain, the phases of all signals are

tween single channel and proposed phase-aligned method

aligned with the phase of the highest SFSS signal(@ 633.715 MHz),
(d) all aligned signals are added, (e) noise components below an
appropriate threshold value are removed, and (f) the added signal
is transformed into the time-domain by employing the inverse FFT
and OLA. Here, the frame overlap ratio is set to 50 %.
The result of the proposed spectral addition is shown in Fig-
ure 12(f). Compared to the spectrum of the highest SFSS signal in
Figure 12(d), the SFSS value obtained by the proposed method is
increased by 4 dB. The SFSS increment of the proposed method is
mainly caused by aligning the phases of multiple radiated signals
with different phases.
5.4 Experimental Results
Figure 14 shows the two positive effects of the proposed scheme in
cases of C1 (Sogou) and YDLYEJ03LM (Xiaomi) devices. The first
improvement is the signal separability against noise; at the same
distance, the cooperatively phase-aligned signal has an obvious
contrast compared to the single highest USNR signal. Second is the
attack distance extendability; we can capture intelligible signals at a
further distance by using the proposed method. The experimental
results of the attack range for all the commercial devices are shown
in the last column of Table 3. All the captured signals stored with
“wav” format are also available on the web link [12].
6 ATTACK FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS AND
DISCUSSION ON DIGITAL SIGNAL LEAKS
So far, we have focused on the analog audio leakage threat on recent
MSoCs which might mainly result from the strong SWREG noise.
However, the intelligible restoration of noisy analog audio signals
is much easier than that of noisy digital signals because the human
ear and brain are very robust to the noise. Also, recent MSoCs are
in the trends of adopting the digital interface, such as I2C or I2S,
for data transmission on behalf of the analog interfaces. In this
section, we expand the attack target signal into a typical digital
I2C signal by using the nRF52840 dongle which is operated with a
temperature sensor.
Session 4B: Physical Attacks CCS '20, November 9–13, 2020, Virtual Event, USA10946.1 Experimental Setup
Target Device. We select the nRF52840 dongle [37] (Figure 7) as
the target MSoC. The YwRobot SEN080608 breakout board [56],
which incorporates the LM75B temperature sensor chipset [40], is
connected to the target MSoC by I2C interface (i.e., two lines such
as serial clock (SCL) and serial data (SDA)). In the experiment, the
target MSoC plays the role of master and generates SCL at 400 kHz.
The target MSoC reads the ambient digital temperature value from
the breakout board at intervals of 1 second.
Experimental environment. We employ the practical receiver
system in Figure 11. Also, to demonstrate the digital signal leaks
in a real situation, we experiment in an office environment where
licensed frequency signals and various RF noises coexist. The mea-
surement distance between the target device and the antenna is
5 centimeters for feasibility analysis. The attack range might be
extendable by using expert equipment and additional signal pro-
cessing.
Analysis Procedure. (1) the I2C signals (SCL and SDA) are di-
rectly measured by an oscilloscope. Figure 15(a) and 15(c) show the
measured SCL and SDA signals, respectively. To read the temper-
ature, the MSoC sends data bits of ‘10010001’ to the temperature
sensor along with the first start bit ‘0’ [40] as shown in Figure 15(b).
(2) to find the highest USNR frequency components, we measure
the EM leakages from several MHz to 1 GHz by sweeping the cen-
ter frequency in the state of SWREG. (3) the leakage signals at the
highest USNR frequency are analyzed in time-domain as shown
in Figure 15(d). (4) we determine the possibility of an attack on a
digital signal based on whether the original data (’10010001’) can
be recognized after post-processing in time-domain.
6.2 Experimental Results
Figure 16 shows the measured spectra at the highest USNR center
frequency 224 MHz, which is one of the harmonics of the system
clock 32 MHz. The red line in the figure shows the power distri-
bution when I2C communication is in the idle state. The blue line
shows the power distribution when I2C data is transferred. In the
blue spectrum, the peaks at intervals of SCL frequency (400 kHz)
can be easily identifiable. From the figure, we can observe that the
overall leakages are increased when I2C signals are transferred
due to the coupling and radiation mechanisms. In other words, all
incoming and outgoing signals (not only analog signals but also
digital signals) on MSoC are strongly leaked if SWREG is used.
Figure 15(d) shows the measured time-domain EM signal at 224
MHz with 25 MHz bandwidth. We compare it with the original
signals, Figure 15(a) and 15(c). From the figures, we can see that the
transition sections of the SCL and SDA signals, that are marked with
vertical gray and green lines, respectively, are represented as posi-
tive or negative spikes. In other words, the signals are transferred
by a differential form of the original SCL and SDA. This phenome-
non can be inferred by the reactance component (i.e., capacitance
and inductance) of coupling paths for the radiated signals.
If we observe Figure 15(d) carefully, the SCL signal can be easily
eliminated by removing only the regular spikes using its periodic
characteristics. After eliminating the SCL signal as shown in the
blue line of Figure 15(e), we can restore the SDA signal by a sim-
ple integral operation of the signal as shown in the red line of
Figure 15: I2C signals: (a) measured SCL signal, (b) I2C data,
(c) measured SDA signal, (d) collected overlapped I2C signal,
and (e) reconstructed SDA signals.

width.
Figure 15(e). Compared to the original signal in Figure 15(c), an
attacker can successfully reconstruct transferred data (‘10010001’)
from Figure 15(e) although the all data bits are inverted.
6.3 Discussion on Feasibility Analysis Results
Even though the measurement distance is short-range, we prove
that it is possible to recover digital information by analyzing the
EM signals emitted from MSoC. The feasibility analysis results
imply that all incoming and outgoing signals, regardless of analog
or digital signal, are vulnerable to the new TEMPEST attack based
on the SWREG noise.
As we know, the most widely used and popular earbuds products
are Apple’s the Airpods and Samsung’s the Galaxy Buds. But this
Session 4B: Physical Attacks CCS '20, November 9–13, 2020, Virtual Event, USA1095kind of high-end product has a different hardware structure, which
employs a separate “audio codec chip” instead of a direct connection
between ADC/DAC and microphone/speaker. In two popular digital
interface products, we can not extract any meaningful digital data
from EM leakages, excluding their system clocks. It seems that they
already may have taken some countermeasure actions to reduce
unwanted radiations, which will be described in Section 7.
However, the experimental results on the digital signal may
provide obvious attack potentials on various MSoCs as follows:
Vulnerability on promising IoT services. As lightweight sen-
sor based IoT services become widespread, the critical requirement
of the sensor node for the IoT moves toward portability (i.e., light-
weight, small size, and low-power consumption). For lightweight
IoT, as a power module of MSoC, SWREG is preferred over LDO.
Therefore, the new TEMPEST threat caused by the use of SWREG
can be directly applicable to various IoT applications. The represen-
tative dangerous applications may be smart-home, smart-factory,
healthcare, and critical infrastructure.
Motivation for new EM SCCAs. From the EM SCCA attacker’s
point of view, the MSoC’s innate strong SWREG noise makes cryp-
tographic leakages become stronger. As a result, the new unique
features of the EM leakages may open potential attack opportuni-
ties and may become a motive for new EM SCCAs considering the
following reasons: (a) strong radiation may extend the attackable
distance or reduce the number of signal traces for analysis. (b) by
exploiting the intermodulation phenomenon with other radiation
sources, which was already discovered (e.g., RF carrier [9]) or will
be newly discovered, the number of attackable leakages would
increase.
7 COUNTERMEASURES
In this section, we suggest appropriate technical countermeasures
against this new vulnerability. The countermeasures, illustrated
below, are discussed from ready-to-use to long-term approach.
Reduction of Analog/Digital Coupling. The most ready-to-
use solution is the reduction of the signal coupling, even when two
strong clock sources exist. The USNR may be easily reduced, by
merely adopting a high input/output impedance device (i.e., a low
input/output current device). However, in the case of the analog
audio interface, to achieve high sensitivity for Hi-Fi audio, manu-
facturers have tried to lower the input impedance. Therefore, audio
devices with higher impedance will be effective for applications
whose signal quality is not very important.
Blocking Analog/Digital Radiation. This countermeasure in-
volves techniques that incorporate a means of blocking the ana-
log/digital radiation sources. One practical technique is EM shield-
ing that uses a metallic enclosure to isolate MSoCs from their sur-
