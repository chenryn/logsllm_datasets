pected to be a system administrator of their own desktop 
system, but without any training! 
Furthermore,  quality  assurance  testing  and  subjecting 
systems  to  authorized  (ethical)  hackers  are  among  the 
most common approaches for concluding that the security 
of  such  systems  is  adequate.    There  have  even  been  ap-
parently serious proposals [1] for something as important 
as  voting  to  use  student  hackers  “to  test  computerized 
voting  systems”.    Yet  it  is  evident  on  the  face  of  it  that 
such approaches are utterly useless for detecting the vul-
nerability  most  attractive  to  a  professional  –  malicious 
software triggered by a unique key or password unknown 
to those making this assessment.3

has no use.  One of the authors currently works in IBM’s Global Secu-
rity Analysis Laboratory, an ethical hacking organization.  Penetration

Thus, systems that are weaker than Multics are consid-
ered for use in environments in excess of what even Mul-
tics could deliver without restructuring around a security 
kernel.   There really seem to be only four possible con-
clusions  from  this:  either  (1)  today’s  systems  are  really 
much  more  secure  than  we  claim;  (2)  today’s  potential 
attackers are much  less capable or motivated; (3) the in-
formation  being  processed  is  much  less  valuable;  or  (4) 
people  are  unwilling  or  unable  to  recognize  the  compel-
ling need to employ much better technical solutions.   
6.2 
 Technical Solutions 
Though Multics was never restructured around a secu-
rity kernel as recommended, the technical ability to struc-
ture a full featured commercial operating system around a 
kernel designed to meet Class A1 while maintaining good 
operating system and application compatibility was dem-
onstrated  for  the  VAX  [25].    Successful  fielding  on  the 
open Internet of a highly secure system using the popular 
x86  processor  with  the  commercial  NSA-certified  Class 
A1 GEMSOS [32] security kernel for VPN security man-
agement has also been demonstrated [42].   
In  the  nearly  thirty years  since  the  report,  it  has  been 
demonstrated  that  the  technology  direction  that  was 
speculative  at  the  time  can  actually  be  implemented  and 
provides an effective solution to the problem of malicious 
software employed by well-motivated professionals.  Un-
fortunately,  the  mainstream  products  of  major  vendors 
largely  ignore  these  demonstrated  technologies.    In  their 
defense most of the vendors would claim that the market-
place is not prepared to pay for a high assurance of secu-
rity.  And customers have said they have never been of-
fered  mainstream  commercial  products  that  give  them 
such  a  choice,  so  they  are  left  with  several  ineffective 
solutions collected under marketing titles like “defense in 
depth”.   
In our opinion this is an unstable state of affairs.  It is 
unthinkable  that  another  thirty  years  will  go  by  without 
one of two occurrences: either there will be horrific cyber 
disasters  that  will  deprive  society  of  much  of  the  value 
computers  can  provide,  or  the  available  technology  will 
be  delivered,  and  hopefully  enhanced,  in  products  that 
provide effective security.  We hope it will be the latter.

We must thank Iris Partlow of the IBM Business Sup-
port  Center  for  retyping  the  1974  report.  Very  helpful 
comments came from Mike Thompson of Aesec Corpora-
tion,  Jeremy  Epstein  of  webMethods,  Wietse  Venema  
and David Safford of IBM Research, Steve Sutton of Pa-
tientKeeper, and Tom Van Vleck of NAI Labs.  Tom also 
runs  the  Multics  web  site  (http://www.multicians.org), 
where we found some of the information needed for this 
testing can identify some vulnerabilities for repair.  However, the failure 
of any particular penetration team to find vulnerabilities does not imply 
their absence.  It only indicates that the team failed to find any. 
commentary.    Tom  was  the  system  administrator  and  a 
designer of Multics, so we also thank him (nearly 30 years 
later) for understanding that our work was to make Mul-
tics  more  secure,  even  if  its presentation  was  considered  
overly dramatic at times.
