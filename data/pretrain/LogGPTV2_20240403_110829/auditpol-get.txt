**Applies to:**
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
The `auditpol get` command retrieves the system and per-user audit policies, auditing options, and the security descriptor associated with the audit policy.

**Permissions:**
To perform get operations on the per-user and system policies, you must have Read permission for the relevant object set in the security descriptor. Alternatively, you can use the `Manage auditing and security log (SeSecurityPrivilege)` user right, although this provides additional access that is not strictly necessary for the get operations.

**Syntax:**
```shell
auditpol /get
[/user[:|]]
[/category:*||[,: ]]
[/subcategory:*||[,: ]]
[/option:]
[/sd]
[/r]
```

**Parameters:**

- **/user**: Specifies the security principal for whom the per-user audit policy is queried. Either the `/category` or `/subcategory` parameter must be specified. The user can be specified by a security identifier (SID) or name. If no user account is specified, the system audit policy is queried.
- **/category**: One or more audit categories specified by globally unique identifier (GUID) or name. An asterisk (*) can be used to indicate all audit categories.
- **/subcategory**: One or more audit subcategories specified by GUID or name.
- **/sd**: Retrieves the security descriptor used to delegate access to the audit policy.
- **/option**: Retrieves the existing policy for the `CrashOnAuditFail`, `FullprivilegeAuditing`, `AuditBaseObjects`, or `AuditBasedirectories` options.
- **/r**: Displays the output in report format, comma-separated value (CSV).
- **/?**: Displays help at the command prompt.

**Remarks:**
- All categories and subcategories can be specified by their GUID or name enclosed in quotation marks (").
- Users can be specified by SID or name.

**Examples:**

1. **Retrieve the per-user audit policy for the Guest account and display the output for the System, Detailed Tracking, and Object Access categories:**
   ```shell
   auditpol /get /user:{S-1-5-21-1443922412-3030960370-963420232-51} /category:System,"Detailed Tracking","Object Access"
   ```

2. **Retrieve the per-user audit policy for a category and a particular subcategory, which reports the inclusive and exclusive settings for that subcategory under the System category for the Guest account:**
   ```shell
   auditpol /get /user:guest /category:System /subcategory:{0ccee921a-69ae-11d9-bed3-505054503030}
   ```

3. **Display the output in report format and include the computer name, policy target, subcategory, subcategory GUID, inclusion settings, and exclusion settings:**
   ```shell
   auditpol /get /user:guest /category:"Detailed Tracking" /r
   ```

4. **Retrieve the policy for the System category and subcategories, which reports the category and subcategory policy settings for the system audit policy:**
   ```shell
   auditpol /get /category:System /subcategory:{0ccee921a-69ae-11d9-bed3-505054503030}
   ```

5. **Retrieve the policy for the Detailed Tracking category and subcategories in report format and include the computer name, policy target, subcategory, subcategory GUID, inclusion settings, and exclusion settings:**
   ```shell
   auditpol /get /category:"Detailed Tracking" /r
   ```

6. **Retrieve the policy for two categories with the categories specified as GUIDs, which reports all the audit policy settings of all the subcategories under two categories:**
   ```shell
   auditpol /get /category:{69979849-797a-11d9-bed3-505054503030},{69997984a-797a-11d9-bed3-505054503030} /subcategory:{0ccee921a-69ae-11d9-bed3-505054503030}
   ```

7. **Retrieve the state, either enabled or disabled, of the `AuditBaseObjects` option:**
   ```shell
   auditpol /get /option:AuditBaseObjects
   ```

8. **Retrieve the state (enabled, disabled, or 2) of the `CrashOnAuditFail` option:**
   ```shell
   auditpol /get /option:CrashOnAuditFail /r
   ```

**Note:**
- This command is useful in two scenarios:
  1. When monitoring a specific user account for suspicious activity, you can use the `/get` command to retrieve results in specific categories using an inclusion policy to enable additional auditing.
  2. If audit settings on an account are logging numerous but superfluous events, you can use the `/get` command to filter out extraneous events for that account with an exclusion policy.
- For a list of all categories, use the `auditpol /list /category` command.
