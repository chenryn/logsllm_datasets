User: I'm trying to write a python script (in windows) that runs a batch file and will take the command line output of that batch file as input. The batch file runs processes that I don't have access to and gives output based on whether those processes are successful. I'd like to take those messages from the batch file and use them in the python script. Anyone have any ideas on how to do this ?
Assistant: Try subprocess.Popen(). It allows you to redirect stdout and stderr to files.
