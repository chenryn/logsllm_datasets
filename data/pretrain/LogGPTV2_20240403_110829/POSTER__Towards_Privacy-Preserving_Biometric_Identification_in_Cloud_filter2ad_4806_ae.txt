Biometrics
This chapter stands as an introduction to the ﬁeld of biometrics. It is important
to present the concepts and primitives of performance metrics due to their
impact on secure biometric schemes. Moreover, we give an overview of the
multibiometric systems while we discuss the levels of information fusion. Finally,
we address the issues that determine the accuracy and security which are related
to the applicability of multimodal designs in real-world deployments.
2.1 Biometric Modalities
In the era of technological evolution, automatic recognition of individuals
has become fast and easy. The popularity and acceptability of biometric
technologies is proved by the local ﬁngerprint authentication which is a
part of the daily routine for millions of smartphone users, enhancing their
experience and convenience. According to the results from a recent survey
commissioned by VISA [220], biometrics win the favor of users and the day when
biometric implementations completely substitute passwords is drawing nearer
than expected by the biometric markets. Biometrics present certain advantages
that cannot be provided by other authentication mechanisms, Prabhakar et
al. [167]. They are recognition forms that set a strong link between a person
and his identity due to the fact that biometric features cannot be easily lost, or
duplicated. Thus, biometrics are considered to be more resistant to attacks than
the other methods of recognition, Furnell [68]. One of their major advantages
is that they can oﬀer a negative recognition functionality. In this way, the
system establishes whether the person is who he implicitly or explicitly denies
13
14
BIOMETRICS
to be and it guarantees whether a certain user is indeed enrolled in a system
although the individual’s claims might. Additionally, biometric systems require
the presence of the user at the time of authentication, preventing the individuals
from making false repudiation claims as presented in ISO Standards [96]. Both
of these terms are especially critical in security-demanding applications, where
impostors may attempt to claim diﬀerent identities and gain beneﬁts. Besides
enhancing security, biometric systems also oﬀer improved user convenience by
alleviating the need to design passwords and tokens, Vasiu [218].
Figure 2.1: Physical and behavioral biometric features.
Biometric systems use a variety of physical or behavioral characteristics.
Figure 2.1 illustrates some examples of biometric traits that can be used for
authenticating a user. They include face, ear, iris, retinal scans, voice, ﬁngerprint,
palmprint, hand/ﬁnger geometry, vein patterns, heartbeat or even DNA, Abaza
et al. [1], Burge and Bowyer [37]. Behavioral characteristics deﬁne how the
person behaves or something unique regarding what he does or knows, such as
gait, signature analysis, keystroke dynamics/typing rhythm, computer’s mouse

use and device holding characteristics among others. Moreover, soft biometrics,
which belong to both categories, include the skin, eye and hair color, presence
of beard, height, weight, tattoos and accessories among others, are widely
used for lawful surveillance purposes, Othman and Ross [156]. Devices, such as
cameras from super markets to public places and roads, can identify the people
passing through. The new systems are carefully designed so that can reduce
the misidentiﬁcation errors. A recent study presented by Connor and Ross [54]
concludes that it is expected that the next generation systems can further
reduce the misidentiﬁcation errors by detecting the conditions that weaken any
external factor that could aﬀect the eﬀectiveness of a biometric-based device.
2.2 Properties for Biometric Modalities
The main properties that need to be considered before a modality can be
characterized as suitable for its applicability in a biometric recognition system
include: universality, uniqueness, permanence, collectability, measurability,
performance, acceptability and circumvention, ISO Standards Biometrics
Vocabulary [96], Jain et al. in “Handbook of Biometrics” [98] and Podio
in “Biometric Technologies and Security-International Biometric Standards
Development Activities” [166]. They are brieﬂy discussed as follows:
Universality. Every individual accessing the biometric application should
possess a speciﬁc modality. A large majority of people should have this
characteristic such as everybody or at least the most individuals have at least
one ﬁngerprint, eye or ear that they can use to identify themselves.
Uniqueness. The given characteristic should be suﬃciently diﬀerent across
users comprising the population. For example a ﬁngerprint or an iris are unique
even between identical twins. Unique characteristics can be used to prevent
unauthorized access to a biometric system, preventing attacks. Although the
uniqueness is seen as an advantage, it does not prevent the threat of tracing
individuals across diﬀerent applications. It remains possible for an attacker to
trace operations done by an individual who uses the same biometric modality
through the logging of authentication sessions. This the reason for the importance
of this property which reﬂects the need for security and privacy in biometric
designs.
Permanence. The biometric characteristic of an individual should be
suﬃciently invariant over a period of time with respect to the applicable
matching algorithm of the system. This means that the trait should not change
signiﬁcantly over a time period because otherwise it cannot be considered as
16
BIOMETRICS
a useful biometric. The ridge structures on the palm are the most well-known
biometric features that do not change much as the person ages.
Collectability. The term is referred to the easiness of obtaining the biometric
data. It should be possible to acquire and digitize the biometric features using
suitable devices with embedded sensors that do not cause undue inconvenience to
the user. In that way, we can achieve a successful extraction and representation
of the datasets in biometric templates.
Measurability. The biometric datasets should be suitable in order to use
statistical analysis to determine the matching result. The complexity of the
applicable algorithms, the computation time and the cost of the scheme’s
components should be evaluated in order to determine the eﬃciency of a system
in real-world applications.
Performance. This measurement is used to address system’s accuracy in order
to allow the access to only authorized users and reject impostors. It also includes
the constraints imposed by the application, such as the used resources and the
environmental factors that may aﬀect the recognition accuracy.
Acceptability. This property is referred to how people react to a biometric
system, how familiar they are with biometric technologies and the use of
applications (habituation) and which is their willingness to provide their
biometric data. The cooperation of the individuals is necessary and they should
feel comfortable and both legally and technically protected using this form of
recognition for their personal security.
Reliability. This concept refers to the quality of the biometric characteristic.
It should be not easy to be forged and the delivery of the characteristic
should not be apt to fooling the system. In the same context, the property of
circumvention/spoofability is used to deﬁne that we should be able to assess
potential spooﬁng attacks and measure how easily a biometric trait of a user can
be imitated using artifacts, such as create gelatin genetic clones of ﬁngerprints,
contact lens with a copy of iris or retinal scans, artiﬁcial replicas of faces, facial
samples in the form of photographs, a video or a 3D mask, Chingovska et al. [51]
and Rebera et al. [176]. It refers to the eﬀort of an attacker to fraudulently alter
and bypass the biometric system in order to gain unauthorized access.
2.3 Operating Modes of Biometric Systems
Depending on the context of application, a biometric system may operate
for authentication/veriﬁcation or identiﬁcation purposes. When it is necessary
to avoid this distinction, we are referred to the term of recognition, Jain et
OPERATING MODES OF BIOMETRIC SYSTEMS
17
al. [98]. Figure 2.2 depicts the main modules of a typical biometric recognition
architecture.
Figure 2.2: Stages of enrollment and recognition in biometric schemes.
During the enrollment process, the user presents his fresh biometric features
at a sensor that is a biometric scanner device. For example, optical ﬁngerprint
sensors are used by the administrative authorities to collect citizens ﬁngerprints
for civilian applications, such as electronic identity cards, Ross et al. [182]. This
module is part of the human machine interface. The feature extraction module
is involved to compute the quality of biometric samples that is assessed in order
to determine their suitability for the next processing stages. Furthermore, the
acquired data are subjected to signal enhancement algorithms in order to remove
noise and improve their quality. The feature sets compose the new template and
along with the user’s biographic information, such as name, address, etc. , they
are securely transmitted and stored in an encrypted biometric repository such
as a smart card issued to the user, or a DB, Yang et al. [227]. The protection
mechanisms for the secure storage of biometric information are extensively
discussed in Chapter 3.
For authentication purposes, a user who claims an identity presents a username
or a passcode and his biometric features at the sensor of the system. After
the feature extraction, the scheme conducts a one-to-one comparison, where
the created template is compared to the stored template. In the matching
module, an algorithm computes the similarity or the distance between the two
templates to determine a matching result. For instance, in a ﬁngerprint-based
biometric model, the number of matching minutiae between the two templates
is computed and a match score is reported. Finally, the module of decision
is used to compare the matching score to the system’s threshold in order to
validate a claimed identity.
In identiﬁcation applications, the scheme follows the same stages as in the
authentication mode. However, the user does not present his credentials and
the system tries to identify him by searching the templates of all the enrolled
individuals in the DB for one-to-many comparison. The process fails if the
subject has not been successfully enrolled, and therefore his templates are not
included in the system’s DB. Identiﬁcation is a critical component in recognition
18
BIOMETRICS
applications and it can only be established through biometric features and not
by other recognition methods, Cavoukian and Stoianov [48]. It is the only way
to prevent a person from using multiple identities while the scheme establishes
the true identity of the person in spite of who he claims or denies to be.
2.4 Performance Metrics and Recognition Accu-
racy
The selection of a particular biometric for an application and the conﬁdence in
the functionality of a biometric scheme are determined by speciﬁc measures that
are used to evaluate the recognition accuracy and eﬀectiveness as addressed in
ISO Standards [93]. During the matching process, the generated score, after the
comparison of the new and stored templates, can be analyzed on the basis of a
predeﬁned threshold, Tao and Veldhuis [203]. In biometric designs that use an
algorithm that computes the similarity between a new and a stored template,
the decision result is represented as 0 which means that the template is not
matching and the authentication is rejected. The closer the score is to 1 the
more certain is the system that the new and the stored templates come from
the same user. A threshold τ lying in the interval [0, 1] is deﬁned to decide if a
user does or does not correspond to a claimed identity. If the matching score is
less than the system’s threshold τ then the authentication is rejected. Biometric
data are anthropometrics and thus, they are noisy, resulting high error rates in
biometric designs, Li and Jain [122], Ross et al. [181]. Hence, schemes hardly
ever encounters a user’s fresh biometric trait and a stored template that result
in a 100% match. The statistical calculation of thresholds is related to the
extraction and validation of performance rates, Malik et al. [130].
The most important measures that are used to evaluate the performance of a
biometric recognition scheme are the False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and the
False Rejection Rate (FRR), Golfarelli et al. [75]. Figure 2.3 illustrates the
computation of the performance metrics for a given threshold τ, Maltoni et
al. [131]. FAR indicates the probability that the system incorrectly authorizes
a non-authorized person, due to falsely matching the biometric input with a
template. Moreover, FRR is the percentage of times when an individual is not
matched to his own stored template. In other words, FRR is the percentage of
the genuine scores which are lower than the decision threshold and they are
incorrectly rejected.
Figure 2.4 shows the Equal Error Rate (EER) that denotes the rate at a threshold
τ for which both FAR and FRR are equal, where genuine and impostor error
rates are closest to zero. Although in practice the EER is not useful in assessing
PERFORMANCE METRICS AND RECOGNITION ACCURACY
19
the actual system’s performance, it is an important operating indicator for the
selection of the threshold and consequently the recognition accuracy of the
biometric architecture, Li and Jain [122].
Figure 2.3: Performance metrics over
genuine and impostor distributions.
Figure 2.4: EER corresponding point
on FAR(τ) and FRR(τ) curves.
In biometric schemes, the performance of tests on biometric data is an essential
technique in order to achieve an acceptable value of FAR, or select an optimum
FRR for the purposes of the recognition schemes, Tao and Veldhuis [203]. This
can be achieved by training the applicable algorithms for examining how the
system behaves under diﬀerent values of threshold. Tuning the system’s threshold
is a mechanism to study the performance accuracy under a given procedure.
This process always aﬀects not only the corresponding rates of the system, but
also the ﬁnal decision, Malik et al. [130], Prabhakar et al. [167] and Ross et
al. [182]. In unimodal designs, these rates cannot be reduced simultaneously by
adjusting the threshold. Although, a lower threshold makes the system more
tolerant to input variations and noise, it increases the corresponding FAR. For
that reason, the system’s overall accuracy is associated with the ability of the
system designers to perform tests on biometric datasets in order to handle
the problems of high performance rates or select an optimum EER according
to the demands of recognition applications. In that way, systems with high
requirements in terms of robustness (e.g., border control, law enforcement and
surveillance applications) demand a low FAR, selecting a higher threshold for
enhancing security, Jain and Kumar [99] and Li et al. [123]. On the contrary,
in architectures for forensic applications the output should indicate the set
of possible matching identities sorted in decreasing order of conﬁdence and
therefore a higher FRR is more convenient, Cavoukian and Stoianov [47]. For
commercial applications, it is necessary to select an optimal solution in order to
avoid an extensive number of FAR and to reduce the need for human intervention.

recognition accuracy trade-oﬀ that is preferred in several types of applications,

applications.
2.5 Multibiometric Systems
The biometric properties, such as non-universality, and the operational factors,
for instance noisy input data, can restrict the availability of speciﬁc modalities for
a part of the users’ population. Thus, a ﬁne tuning of the system’s parameters
cannot be expected to provide continuous performance improvement, ISO
Standards for Biometric Performance Testing and Reporting [93]. Therefore, the
accuracy of a biometric system employing a single unimodal trait is constrained
by intrinsic factors. According to the ﬁndings of Ross et al. in [181], there is
not a single biometric modality that can be considered suﬃciently accurate for
robust real-world applications, while it is demanded from designers to produce
eﬃciently secure systems with low error rates. These limitations can be alleviated
by fusing the information presented by multiple sources, Manasa et al. [132].
This increases the number of the users that can be eﬀectively enrolled in a
recognition system while improves the reliability, as explained below. A system
that consolidates the evidences presented by multiple biometric sources is known
as a multibiometric scheme, Nair et al. [147].
Multibiometrics present several advantages over traditional unimodal deploy-
ments. They address the issue of insuﬃcient population coverage, since they
improve the ﬂexibility of a design where people can be enrolled using diﬀerent
MULTIBIOMETRIC SYSTEMS
21
features, Lee et al. [118]. Moreover, they can oﬀer substantial improvement
in the matching accuracy, depending on the information being combined
and the applied fusion methodology. Hence, both the FAR and FAR can be
reduced simultaneously, Sasidhar et al. [188]. Taking the quality assessment into
consideration, they can eﬀectively address the problem of poor data by selecting
only the used features that can be accurately measured. Finally, they present
