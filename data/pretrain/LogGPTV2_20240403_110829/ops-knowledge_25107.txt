User: I have a worker application written in python for a distributed system. There is a situation when I need to start multiple instances of this worker on a single server. Logging should be written into file I suspect that I cannot write to the same file from different instances. So what should I do, pass log-file name as command line argument to each instance? Is there a standard approach for such situation?
Assistant: I will use MySQL. This way I will have a standard tool for log analysis (MySQL Workbench), will solve the problem with multiple instance logging serialization. The best way would be probably to write a handler to standard logging module but at the moment I'll sent all messages through rabbitmq to service that stores them.
