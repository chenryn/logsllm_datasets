Using the regular task:scheduler element in conjunction with the
task:scheduled-tasks element, results, at least with Tomcat, in a server that
is unable to shut down.
The server hangs after having logged the following statement:  
Destroying singletons in
org.springframework.beans.factory.support.DefaultListableBeanFactory@d81cda:
defining beans []; parent:
org.springframework.beans.factory.support.DefaultListableBeanFactory@1d49247
Manually defining a task scheduler and setting the threads to run as daemon
provides a workaround:
However this is only a workaround, and the default behavior should work out of
the box. As you can see from the forum post reference, I am not the only one
facing this issue.
