No transporters means no transport – and assessment of the ‘real’ (natural) substrates of  
xenobiotic transporters.
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Douglas Kell, University of Liverpool, United Kingdom
CO-AUTHORS: Steve O’Hagan
Despite what it says in textbooks, bilayer flux through intact cell membranes is negligible [1] and hydrophobicity is often a poor guide to permeability 
Often their ‘natural’ substrates are unknown We compare several molecular fingerprint encodings for marketed, small molecule drugs, and assess how 
their rank order varies with the fingerprint in terms of the Tanimoto similarity to the most similar endogenous human metabolite as taken from Recon2 
For the great majority of drugs, the rank order varies very greatly depending on the encoding used, and also somewhat when the Tanimoto similarity 
(TS) is replaced by the Tversky similarity However, for a subset of such drugs, amounting to some 10% of the set and a Tanimoto similarity of ~08 or 
greater, the similarity coefficient is relatively robust to the encoding used This leads to a metric that, while arbitrary, suggests that a Tanimoto similarity 
of 075-08 or greater genuinely does imply a considerable structural similarity of two molecules in the drug-endogenite space However, the majority 
are in fact similar to natural products [2]

Spatial Isotope tracer Metabolomics to study 13C labelled Metabolite Distribution in 3D Tumor  
Spheroid Cell culture
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Prasad Phapale, EMBL, Germany
CO-AUTHORS: Mariia Naumenko, Karin Mitosch, Theodore Alexandrov
Tracer-based studies when performed in 2D cell culture do not provide information about spatial aspects of metabolism neglecting spatio-molecular 
gradients and 3D microenvironment manifested in tissues and tumors Multicellular tumor spheroids in 3D cell cultures are established in vitro models 
to mimic the primary tumors Study of the distribution of isotope-labeled metabolites in spheroids can give us a valuable spatial understanding of the 
3D spatial aspects of tumor metabolism Here we present a method combining using 13C6-glucose as a tracer in 3D cell culture and untargeted LC-MS/
MS analysis to map central carbon metabolism spatially across different layers of spheroids Tumor spheroids were cultured using HCT116 human colon 
carcinoma cells for 10 days in Nunclon SpheraTM plates Metabolites and lipids were extracted from each layer as well as from respective culturing 
medium to perform untargeted metabolomic profiling using our high-resolution LC-MS/MS-based EMBL-MCF platform (protocols available online 
https://wwwemblde/mcf/metabolomics-core-facility/protocols) Preliminary results of the metabolite profiling show the highest incorporation of the 
13C-label in layer 1 and the lowest in layer 3 The numbers of carbons labeled for pyruvate, succinate, sugar phosphates, other glycolytic metabolites, 
and amino acids were found to be decreasing from layer 1 to layer 3 The necrotic core with dead cells had the least incorporation of the 13C label which 
suggests diffusion of labeled metabolites across layers Our results suggest that the developed method is useful for investigating spatial aspects of 
metabolic fluxes in a tumor spheroid model

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with cardiovascular complications including heart failure To identify early prognostic factors for heart failure 
in CKD, we aim to explore the association of circulating plasma factors with microvascular integrity As current human 2D models with cultured endothelial 
cells lack sufficient complexity to assess the functionality of microvascular endothelial-pericyte interactions, research on microvascular loss largely 
depends on pre-clinical animal models for ischemia/reperfusion injury We recently developed a microfluidics-based, 3D ‘microvessel-on-a-chip’ platform 
that models patient specific human microvessels and allows quantitative and parallel testing of microvascular leakage Human umbilical vein endothelial 
cells (HUVECs) were cultured to generate microvessels-on-a-chip To assess microvascular destabilization, the layout of the microfluidics platform was 
modified to measure microvascular leakage of fluorescently labelled albumin by means of high-resolution time-lapse fluorescent microscopy In this 
small volume platform, we were able to measure metabolites that are critical in disease progression by using liquid chromatography–tandem mass 
spectrometry metabolomics Additionally, we developed an approach to test plasma samples of patients suffering from vascular diseases for the presence 
of destabilizing factors such as thrombin or TNF-alpha Our platform may serve as a unique tool for microvascular destabilization studies as well as for 
the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat cardiovascular complications Plasma samples of patients with a destabilizing profile may well 
predict ongoing microvascular rarefaction and risk of cardiovascular complications

Stable Isotope-Resolved Metabolomics (SIRM) Defines DEK Oncogene Driven Metabolic Reprogramming  
in 3D Epidermal Organoids
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Sara Vicente-Muñoz, NMR-Based Metabolomics Core Facility, Division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, United States
CO-AUTHORS: Sara Vicente-Muñoz, Marie C Matrka, Miki Watanabe, Marion G Brusadelli, Kaylin Earnest, Andrew N Lane,

The DEK oncoprotein is amplified and overexpressed in many malignancies, including squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) originating in keratinocytes of 
the human epidermis Our previous work on 2D cell models demonstrated that DEK overexpression reprogrammed metabolism at the level of aerobic 
glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation in the absence of proliferative gains, indicating that DEK drives metabolic reprogramming Engineered 3D 
epidermal organoids, which mimic stratified human epidermis, show induction of hyperplasia by DEK overexpression and a significant shift in steady 
state metabolism To reconstruct global metabolic networks in 3D models of human epidermis, we report the application of stable isotope-resolved 
metabolomics (SIRM) on epidermal organoids The goal was to unequivocally define DEK-driven metabolic pathways and specific enzymes, and their 
respective roles in enabling and sustaining oncogenic phenotypes Normal immortalized keratinocytes were transduced with either control or DEK 
overexpression vector, placed into 3D organoid culture conditions for 13 days, and then incubated with 13C6-glucose for an additional 24 hrs prior to 
collection and metabolite extraction NMR spectroscopy was used to determine positional isotopomers in downstream metabolites Media aliquots 
were collected post isotope addition to quantify 13C6-glucose consumption and de novo production of labelled metabolites Incorporation of 13C6-
glucose validated SIRM feasibility in this system; we observed numerous 13C-labeled metabolites including lactate, alanine, glutamine and glutamate 
Comprehensive analyses of DEK-overexpressing versus control organoids defined a number of reprogrammed pathways including glycolysis, the 
TCA cycle and glutathione metabolism Current experiments aim to target therapeutically relevant enzymes for the prevention of DEK-dependent SCC 
development and progression

Metabolomics as a quality control for the production of chondrogenic microtissues towards characterized 
endochondral bone regeneration
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Niki Loverdou, Prometheus, Division of Skeletal Tissue Engineering, KULeuven, Belgium
CO-AUTHORS: G. Nilsson Hall, K.Bernaerts, B.Ghesquiere, G.Carmeliet, I.Papantoniou, L.Geris
The use of 3D microtissues is becoming a standard for bone tissue engineering approaches, as this format allows cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix 
interactions Considering the role of metabolism as a key regulator of stem cell fate and the high sensitivity of metabolomics, this study aims to identify 
metabolic quality attributes indicative of a functional cartilage intermediate TE construct LC-MS (liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry) tracer 
analysis was conducted to investigate metabolic alterations during chondrogenic differentiation of spheroids of hPDCs (human periosteum derived stem 
cells) 13C labeled glucose, glutamine but also serine and aspartate have been used, as these metabolites showed significant differences between the 
time points of interest in a prior exometabolomics study Samples were analyzed at day 0, day 14 and day 21, time points indicative of the proliferating, 
prehypertrophic and hypertrophic state Our tracer analysis results showed progressive 13C glucose enrichment in palmitate from 0% at day 0 to 8% at day 
14 and 22% at day 21, suggesting activation of fatty acid synthesis Furthermore, we observed 13C glutamine enrichment in proline from 0 % at day 0 to 20 
% at day 14 and 42,5 % at day 21 and a similar trend of 13C glutamine contribution to hydroxyproline (from 0 % at day 0 to 35 % at day 14 and 38 % at day 
21) The consecutive stages of chondrogenic differentiation of hPDCs are characterized by specific metabolic adaptations and highlight the importance of 
unexplored metabolic pathways such as fatty acid and glutamine metabolism for chondrogenic differentiation

A large diversity of lipids is found in eukaryotic cells, where they fulfill important physiological functions The dysregulation of lipids is often related to 
serious diseases, eg, various types of cancer The robust, high-throughput, and validated analytical methods for the lipidomic quantitation can be applied 
for biomarker discovery research and also for monitoring the progress of disease therapy MS and its coupling with the liquid-phase separation techniques 
together with exogenous internal standards is the most common approach for the lipidomic quantitation We have developed the following MS based 
methods for the high-throughput clinical lipidomic quantitation: 1/ shotgun ESI-MS using characteristic NL and PI scans on QqQ, 2/ UHPSFC/MS, 3/ UHPLC/
MS, and 3/ MALDI coupled to Orbitrap mass analyzer Shotgun MS, UHPSFC/MS, and UHPLC/MS techniques are applied mainly for glycerophospholipids, 
sphingolipids, and glycerolipids using positive-ion ESI, while MALDI is used in the negative-ion mode to obtain complementary information on sulfatides 
and other anionic lipid subclasses About 300 – 500 lipid species are typically quantified in studied biological samples from over 1000 human subjects, 
mainly plasma or serum from healthy volunteers and cancer patients All mentioned methods follow the basic rule of reliable lipidomic quantitation that IS 
should be coionized with analytes from the same lipid subclass Finally, MDA methods are applied for building the statistical models to differentiate cancer 
patients and healthy controls with over 90% accuracy for samples with known classification and also for blinded samples This work was supported by 
project No 18-12204S sponsored by the Czech Science Foundation

Background- Statins have pleotropic effects on lipid metabolism However, the relationship between these effects and future cardiovascular events is 
unknown We sought to characterise the changes in lipid species upon pravastatin treatment and define the relationship with risk reduction for future 
cardiovascular events Methods - Plasma lipids (n=342) were measured on baseline and one-year follow-up samples from a LIPID study sub-cohort 
(n=4991) The associations of changes in lipids with treatment and cardiovascular outcomes were investigated using linear regression and cox regression 
The effect of treatment on future cardiovascular outcomes was examined by the relative risk reduction (RRR) Results - Pravastatin treatment was 
associated with changes in 206 lipids Species containing arachidonic acid were positively associated while phosphatidylinositol species were negatively 
associated with pravastatin treatment Findings were replicated in an ADVANCE case-cohort A greater decrease and increase in the phosphatidylinositol 
(PI(36:2)) and phosphatidylcholine (PC(38:4)) respectively, were associated with fewer events The RRR from pravastatin treatment for cardiovascular events 
reduced from 235% to 166% after adjustment for clinical risk factors and change in LDL-C, and to 30% after further adjustment for the change in the lipid 
ratio PI(36:2)/PC(38:4) 58% of the treatment effect was mediated by the change in PI(36:2)/PC(38:4), as indicated by causal mediation analysis Stratification 
of patients into quartiles of change in PI(36:2)/PC(38:4) indicated no benefit of pravastatin in Q4 Conclusion-The change in PI(36:2)/PC(38:4) predicts 
benefit from pravastatin, independent of change in LDL-C, demonstrating its potential as a biomarker for monitoring the clinical benefit of statin treatment 
in secondary prevention

Metabolomics analysis of human atherosclerotic plaques reveals a potential novel pathway of  
macrophage foam cell apoptosis in advanced atherosclerosis
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Panagiotis Vorkas, Imperial College London, United Kingdom
CO-AUTHORS: Sarah Onida, Kevin Woollard, Alun H Davies, Elaine Holmes
Atherosclerosis remains a leading worldwide cause of mortality and morbidity In this study, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to 
mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS)-based metabolomics were utilized for the analysis of human advanced atherosclerotic tissue From 78 patients, a total of 
52 carotid and 26 femoral plaques were compared to 16 adjacent arterial non-plaque tissue (intimal thickening) Tissue samples were homogenised and 
extracted consecutively for aqueous and organic extracts Aqueous extracts were analysed using hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC-)UHPLC-
MS, whilst organic extracts by reversed-phase (RP-)UHPLC-MS A panel of established as well as novel molecules, from several biological pathways, were 
identified as being dysregulated These included free unesterified cholesterol (FUEC), oxidized cholesteryl esters, purines, pyrimidines, sphingolipids 
and acylcarnitines A previously unassociated sphingolipid, namely phosphatidylethanolamine-ceramide (PE-Cer), was detected with high statistical 
significance (p=98x10-12) and 2-fold reduction in plaque tissue PE-Cer also demonstrated the highest (inverse) correlation to FUEC (ρ=-076) In pilot 
validation studies, human primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) were treated with vehicle (naïve), acetylated-LDL (acLDL) (foam cells) and acLDL/
FUEC (FUEC-loaded foam cells) The acLDL/FUEC-treated MDM demonstrated elevated apoptosis, and a 2-fold reduction in PE-Cer, in concordance with 
the findings in human tissue This was accompanied by a reduction of SAMD8 RNA, the enzyme responsible for PE-Cer synthesis Finally, a comprehensive 
examination of the sphingolipid pathway demonstrated an increase in de novo ceramide synthesis, further to the recognised in apoptosis hydrolysis of 
sphingomyelin (to ceramide) This provides insight for the role of PE-Cer and sphingolipids in advanced atherosclerosis and specifically in FUEC-loaded 
MDM foam cell apoptosis

Plasma metabolomics profiles associated with endothelial health and dysfunction impose changes  
to endothelial glycan biosynthesis and reflect endothelial catecholamine response
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Óttar Rolfsson, University of Iceland, Iceland
CO-AUTHORS: Sarah McGarrity, Hanne H. Henriksen, Per Johannsson
Endothelial dysfunction (ED) contributes to diseases of the vasculature by influencing blood pressure, clotting and transport of fluids, nutrients and immune 
cells Metabolic phenotypes associated with ED are not well characterised due to difficulties in assessing endothelial metabolism in situ To address this, we 
recently built a cell scale metabolic network model of endothelial metabolism (iEC2812) and applied it to infer endothelial metabotypes from sepsis patient 
plasma metabolomics data These highlighted changes to endothelial glycan metabolism We subsequently hypothesized that endothelial glycocalyx 
maintenance contributes to endothelial dysfunction and updated our model (iEC2997) to more accurately account for endothelial glycocalyx synthesis and 
biomass We then analysed, i) plasma metabolomics data from 20 trauma patients vs 20 controls and ii) ASGR1del12 carriers vs controls using iEC2997 
to identify reactions associated with both dysfunctional and above normally healthy vasculature, respectively Flux into the hexosamine biosynthetic 
pathway was altered in both cases To verify this effect, we titrated HUVEC monolayers with physiological concentrations of catecholamines Increased 
permeability and glycocalyx loss was verified by TEM, immunostaining and by permeability assays UPLC-MS metabolomics analysis showed a drop in the 
intracellular concentrations of the glycan precursors UDP-glucose and N-acetyl-glucosamine Extracellular measurements along with 13C-UL-glucose and 
15N2-glutamine flux analysis supported lower turnover of glycocalyx intermediates and lower glycolytic and TCA cycle flux In summary, metabolic network 
analysis of three independent plasma metabolomics datasets highlighted the importance of glycan synthesis to endothelial health Induction of endothelial 
dysfunction in vitro is accompanied by compromised glycan synthesis

Sphingolipidomics investigation of the ischemic brain injury
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Ching-Hua Kuo, National Taiwan University, Taiwan
CO-AUTHORS: Hsi-Chun Chao, Tsung-Heng Lee, Sung-Chun Tang
Stroke is among the three leading causes of death worldwide and is the most frequent cause of permanent disability Significant changes of sphingolipid 
(SPL) levels have been observed after stroke We conducted sphingolipidomic profiling of mouse brain tissue by liquid chromatography-electrospray 
ionization tandem mass spectrometry at 3 hour (hr) and 24 hr after 1 hr of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), and SPL were compared with those 
of the Sham control group At 3 hr post MCAO, ceramides (Cers) exhibited increase in levels of long-chain Cers but decrease in very-long-chain Cers 
Moreover, sphingosine, was decreased and S1P was increased at 3 hr after MCAO Both long-chain and very-long-chain Cers showed an increased trend 
at 24 hr post MCAO The administration of atorvastatin improved the neurological function of the mice and significantly reversed the SPL changes resulting 
from the ischemic injury To further investigate the prognostic roles of SPL in patients with acute ischemic stroke, we collected plasma samples from acute 
ischemic stroke patients at 24 hr and 72 hr (n=90; prognosis: 40%) post stroke and non-stroke controls (n=64) The association study between the plasma 
ceramide concentrations and 3 months post stroke outcome revealed that the levels of long chain ceramides at 72 hr were significantly higher in patients 
with poor outcome Long chain ceramides represented as potential prognostic markers for patients with acute ischemic stroke, and the network of SPL 
components that change upon ischemic damage may provide novel therapeutic targets for ischemic stroke

Elucidating insect resistance in tomato through genetical metabolomics
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Ric de Vos, Bioscience, Wageningen Plant Research, Wageningen University and Research, Netherlands
CO-AUTHORS: Robert D. Hall, Roland Mumm, Roeland E. Voorrips, Ben Vosman
Host plant pest resistance is becoming increasingly important in agriculture as more and more insecticides are being banned due to environmental 
concerns In tomato, resistance towards several pests has been found in wild relatives (Solanum section Lycopersicon) To identify quantitative traits 
loci (QTLs) regulating pest resistance, we combined untargeted metabolomics using LC-PDA-Orbitrap FTMS with insect resistance assays, trichome 
phenotyping and genetic mapping Screening a set of 14 accessions from close relatives of the cultivated tomato (S lycopersicum, cv Moneymaker) 
for resistance against different pest insects, including whitefly, thrips, caterpillar and aphids, we identified broad spectrum insect resistance in both S 
galapagense and a few accessions of S pimpinellifolium An untargeted metabolomics comparison of leaves of resistant S galapagense with those of its 
closest relative but sensitive S cheesmaniae, containing and lacking type-IV trichomes respectively, indicated significantly higher levels of both a range of 
acylated sucroses and methylated flavonols in S galapagense Subsequent whitefly resistance screening and metabolomics comparison of a recombinant 
inbred line population and near-isogenic lines derived from a cross between S lycopersicum and S galapagense indicated a major QTL on chromosome 
2 that controls the presence of both whitefly resistance, trichome types IV and V, and the accumulation of a specific set of phytochemicals including all 
identified acyl sugars and the methyl flavonols We hypothesize that this QTL regulates the formation of glandular trichome type IV on the leaf epidermis, 
thus enabling the production and accumulation of the bioactive metabolites in this specific trichome type

Dissecting the Genetic Basis of Variation in Tomato Fruit Metabolism and Pathogen Resistance through 
Multimodal Investigation of Wild Species Introgressions

Wild tomato species represent a rich gene pool for numerous desirable traits lost during domestication Here, we exploited an introgression population 
representing wild desert-adapted species and a domesticated cultivar to establish the genetic basis of gene expression and chemical variation 
accompanying the transfer of wild species-associated fruit traits Transcriptome and metabolome analysis of 580 lines coupled to pathogen sensitivity 
assays resulted in the identification of genomic loci significantly linked with levels of hundreds of transcripts and metabolites These associations occurred 
in functionally coherent hotspots that represent coordinated perturbation of metabolic pathways and ripening-related processes We demonstrated the 
efficacy of our approach by discovering yet undisclosed components of the renowned Solanum alkaloids pathway and showing that fruit fungal resistance 
is associated with changes in the ripening regulatory network Together, our results outline a framework for understanding metabolism and pathogen 
resistance underlying ripening and provide insights into key fruit quality traits

Metabolomics application to unravel the biochemistry underlying enhancement of drought stress tolerance  
in crops by plant growth promoting rhizobacteria
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Fidele Tugizimana, University of Johannesburg, South Africa
CO-AUTHORS: Lerato Nephali, Johan Huyser, Ian Dubery
Drought conditions pose a growing threat to food security, affecting agronomically important crop plants Although improved adaptation to drought has 
long been a pursuit of crop breeders, it has been difficult to achieve, since drought resistance is a quantitative trait controlled by multilayered cellular 
and molecular events Hence, innovative and efficient strategies are imperatively required, such as the use of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria 
(PGPR) However, to devise these novel PGPR-based agricultural strategies, there is a necessity to firstly understand the physiology and biochemistry 
governing the interactions between beneficial bacteria and plants, and the resultant enhanced plant defences against abiotic stresses Thus, we present 
the application of LC-MS-based metabolomics to elucidate the biochemical events and molecular mechanisms underlying PGPRs–maize interactions and 
the subsequent potentiation against drought conditions The results of this study showed that the application of PGPRs induced alterations in different 
pathways of primary and secondary metabolism such as phenylpropanoid, flavonoid biosynthesis, fatty acid metabolism, amino acids and phytohormones
