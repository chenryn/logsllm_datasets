The concept of a Pedal PC involves innovative projects that harness the energy generated by pedaling while you work on your computer. One of the most notable examples is [PedalPC](https://www.pedalpc.com/), although it remains an unconventional solution. Another similar project, [Pedal-Power](http://pedal-power.com/), also exists, but it appears to be no longer actively maintained.
