### Introduction
Hello, I'm Steve from DOMAIN. I need access to VLAN2. My goal is to demonstrate how one can trick firewall user identity capabilities into applying security policies to arbitrary IPs on the network.

- **Interests: Hacking and automation**
- **Role: Pentester at Orange Cyberdefense**
- **Hobbies: Craft beers and longboarding**

### The Story
#### Client Probing Dangers
- **Palo Alto Firewalls (Estaban Rodriguez @ Coalfire)**
  - Risks associated with client probing.
- **Authenticated Vulnerability Scans (Xavier Mertens @ SANS)**
  - Potential vulnerabilities in authenticated scans.
- **Palo Alto Credential Exposure (HD Moore @ Project Sonar)**
  - Historical incidents of credential exposure.

#### Example Scenario
- **Step 1: Request Access**
  - "I'd like access to the VIP fridge, please. My hotel room number is 192.168.56.148."
  - (Ping `vip-fridge.tld`)
- **Step 2: System Response**
  - "Ahh, room 148. Our system doesn't know who's currently checked into this room. What is your name, sir?"
  - (NetWkstaUserEnum Request)
- **Step 3: User Response**
  - "My name is Justin."
  - (NetWkstaUserEnum Response)
- **Step 4: Final Response**
  - "Hi, Mr. Perdok. Sorry, you are not allowed to access the VIP fridge due to our hotel policy. VIP clients only."

- **Step 5: Spoofed Access**
  - "I'd like access to the VIP fridge, please. My hotel room number is 192.168.56.149."
  - (Ping `vip-fridge.tld`)
- **Step 6: System Response**
  - "Aah, room 149. Our system doesn't know who's currently checked into this room. What is your name, sir?"
  - (NetWkstaUserEnum Request)
- **Step 7: Spoofed User Response**
  - "My name is Steve."
  - (Spoofed NetWkstaUserEnum Response)
- **Step 8: Final Response**
  - "Hi, Mr. McGreeve. I see you bought our VIP package. Of course, you are allowed to access the VIP fridge!"

### The Solution
#### Traditional Segmentation
- **VLAN Configuration**
  - **Untagged Ports**: VLAN1, VLAN2
  - **Tagged Ports**: VLAN1, VLAN2
- **Step-by-Step Process**
  - **Client in VLAN1**
  - **User-ID Agent**
  - **Firewall**
  - **The VIP Fridge in VLAN2**
  - **Cache and AD Logs**

### Building the Tool
- **References**
  - [MS-WKST Protocol Documentation](https://winprotocoldoc.blob.core.windows.net/productionwindowsarchives/MS-WKST/%5BMS-WKST%5D.pdf)
- **Steps**
  - **NetWkstaUserEnum Request**
  - **Building the tool**
  - **GitHub Repository**
    - [Impacket](https://github.com/justin-p/impacket)
    - [Pull Request](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/pull/965)

### The Pwn
- **Process Flow**
  - **ACL with User-ID**
  - **Cache and AD Logs**
  - **User Matches and Access Control**
    - **User Matches = Allow Access**
    - **User Mismatch = Block Access**

### Other Vendors
- **$Vendor2**
  - **Caveats**
    - **SMB Guest Access**
- **$Vendor3**
  - **Potential Exploits**
    - **WINREG Named Pipe**
    - **Reuse IP with Cached User-to-IP**
    - **WMI Support**
