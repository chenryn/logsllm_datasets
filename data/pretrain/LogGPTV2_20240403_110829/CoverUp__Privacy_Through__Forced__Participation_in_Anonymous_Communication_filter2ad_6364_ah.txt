Pr[Si + ∆] := Pr[0 ← (cid:104)A | Game i with delay ∆(cid:105)]
Notation 2.
Pr[Si − ∆] = Pr[S j] :⇐⇒ Pr[Si] = Pr[S j + ∆]
We have also used the following relation throughout
our proof which can be proved easily.
Pr[S j] = Pr[Si + ∆]∧ Pr[Si] = Pr[Sk + ∆(cid:48)]
⇐⇒ Pr[S j] = Pr[Sk + ∆ + ∆(cid:48)]
Pr[Si + ∆] = Pr[S j + ∆ + ∆(cid:48)]
⇐⇒ Pr[Si] = Pr[S j + ∆(cid:48)]

14.5.1 Game 0 and Game 1
Game 1 only include one operation on RequestQueue
which imposes ∆0 timing delay. Hence

14.5.2 Game 1 and Game 2
Game 2 adds the request intercept which executes in the
browser extension at client side. This includes one call
to readBiDirectionalData() method which reads
bi-directional data sent by the external application.
This incurs ∆1 timing delay. Moreover Game 2 adds
statements which modify the payload content such
to bi− directional and data ﬁeld to
as the header h f
the bi-directional request. This introduce ∆2 timing
delay. Remember that ll the communications are done
via a secure channel, and all the modiﬁcation of the
packet data ensures constant data size. Hence we can en-
sure indistinguishability in spite of the data modiﬁcation.

In Game 3 all the statements remain same, only the
to the reactive machine mix server(h f )
parameter
changes as the Ch now sends bi− directional as the
packet header. As mix server(h f ) guarantees constant
time execution irrespective of the input parameter, Game
3 does not introduce any additional timing delay.

15 Statistical distance and the optimal at-
tacker
Deﬁnition 2 (Discrete distributions over ﬁnite domains).
A discrete distribution X is a discrete distribution over
a ﬁnite domain if there is a natural number n such that
|supp(X)| = n, supp denotes the support. For pair X,Y
of discrete distributions over ﬁnite domains, the join do-
main ΩX,Y (abbreviated as Ω if uniquely determined in
the context) be deﬁned as ΩX,Y := supp(X)∪ supp(Y ).
Deﬁnition 3 (Negligible leakage against unbounded at-
tackers). Let X,Y be two families of discrete distribu-
tions over a ﬁnite domain with a joint Domain Ω. Then,
the X and Y have negligible leakage against unbounded
attackers if there is a negligible function µ such that for
all Turing machines A and sufﬁciently large η ∈ N we
have
|Pr[b = 1 : b ← A(w),w ← Xη ]
− Pr[b = 1 : b ← A(w),w ← Yη ]| ≤ µ(η)
Deﬁnition 4 (Statistical distance over ﬁnite domain). Let
X,Y be two discrete distributions over a ﬁnite domain
with a joint Domain Ω. Then, the statistical distance d of
X and Y is deﬁned as
d(X,Y ) :=
(|pX (a)− pY (a)|)
1
2 ∑
a∈Q
Deﬁnition 5 (Statistical indistinguishability). Let X,Y
be two families of discrete distributions over a ﬁnite do-
main with a joint Domain Ω. X and Y are statistically
indistinguishable if there is a negligible function µ such
that for sufﬁciently large η ∈ N the statistical distance of
Xη and Yη is negligible in η, i.e., d(X,Y ) ≤ µ(η).
Lemma 3 (Deﬁnition 3 ⇔ Deﬁnition 5). Let X,Y be two
discrete distributions over a ﬁnite domain with a joint
Domain Ω. Then, X,Y have negligible leakage against
unbounded attackers if and only if X,Y are statistically
indistinguishable.
Proof. If X and Y have negligible leakage against un-
bounded attackers, then X and Y are statistically indistin-
guishable. Otherwise, an unbounded attackers could just
check for each sample w that it receives whether pXη (w)
or pYη (w) is large, and output 1 in one case and 0 in the
other case. The resulting advantage is exactly the statis-
tical distance, which contracts the assumption that X and
Y are not statistically indistinguishable.
For the converse direction (statistical indistinguisha-
bility implies negligible leakage against unbounded at-
tackers), we assume that statistical indistinguishability
holds and there is an unbounded attacker A such that (for
inﬁnitely many η)
|Pr[b = 1 : b ← A(w),w ← Xη ]
− Pr[b = 1 : b ← A(w),w ← Yη ]| ≥ p(η)
for some polynomial η. For the proof, we use the more
general deﬁnition of statistical distance9
d(Xη ,Yη ) := max
S⊆Ω
|Pr[w ∈ S : w ← Xη ]
− Pr[w ∈ S : w ← Yη ]|
Statistical indistinguishability and the ﬁniteness of the
domain then implies (for some negligible function µ) for
sufﬁciently large η that there is a set S(cid:48) such that
|Pr[b = 1 : b ⇔ (w ∈ S(cid:48)),w ← Xη ]
− Pr[b = 1 : b ⇔ (w ∈ S(cid:48)),w ← Yη ]| ≤ µ(η)
(2)
(3)
We observe, however, that the attacker A also gives rise
to a set SA := {w | A(w) = 1}. Then, we have
|Pr[b = 1 : b ⇔ (w ∈ Sw),w ← Xη ]
− Pr[b = 1 : b ⇔ (w ∈ Sw),w ← Yη ]| ≥ p(η) > µ(η)
Which contradicts (1), since S(cid:48) was assumed to be the set
that maximizes |Pr[w ∈ S : w ← Xη ]−Pr[w ∈ S : w ← Yη ]|
and already for S(cid:48) we have
|Pr[w ∈ S : w ← Xη ]− Pr[w ∈ S : w ← Yη ]| ≤ µ(η)
for sufﬁciently large η, however, for the set SA we have
|Pr[w∈ S : w← Xη ]−Pr[w∈ S : w←Yη ]|≥ p(η) > µ(η)
16 Composition theorem
We recall a known result for the statistical distance of
two product distributions Di

Lemma 4. Let D0 and D1 a pair of distributions with
