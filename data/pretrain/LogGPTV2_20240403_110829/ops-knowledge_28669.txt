User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How do I configure Apache htaccess to allow access to a file on one domain and not another? I have a fairly default Apache install on Ubuntu 10.10. There's no virtual hosting and I would rather not add that. All domains that map to that machine are therefore served by the default site and the same directory.

What I would like is the .htaccess file in a specific directory to disallow access from a specific domain to that directory.

To clarify, xxx.foo.com/thefile.html gives a 403 (or whatever), but any other sub-domain or domain permits access to the file.

Assistant: You could try something like (untested and Rewrites never seem to work right the first time for me):

RewriteCond  %{HTTP_HOST}  ^xxx.foo.com
RewriteRule  ^/thefile.html$  [FL]


This should cause the one file to be returned as "forbidden" on the matching domain. The RewriteLog filename.log is helpful in debugging rewrites. See the official documentation for more on Rewriting.
