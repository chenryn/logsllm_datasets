# Mobile Privacy: Tor on the iPhone and Other Unusual Devices

**Author:** Marco Bonetti

## Abstract
Tor is a software project that helps users defend against traffic analysis, a form of network surveillance that can compromise personal freedom, privacy, confidential business activities, and state security. By routing communications through a distributed network of volunteer-operated relays, Tor prevents third parties from monitoring your Internet activity and determining your physical location.

However, with the introduction of new HTML5 features and built-in geolocation in web browsers, maintaining user privacy has become increasingly challenging. This paper will discuss the emerging threats to privacy posed by these technologies and how they can be (mis)used to target Tor users. Additionally, it will explore the ongoing efforts to enhance mobile privacy and enable users to protect themselves on their devices.

## 1. Introduction
Tor's popularity continues to grow, as evidenced by the "Help us reach 5000 relays in 2010!" campaign launched by TorProject.org. Despite this growth, secure browsing practices are not always adopted, and new privacy exploitation techniques are constantly being developed. The rapid proliferation of mobile devices further complicates the task of protecting user privacy.

Section 2 will provide an overview of the current state of secure communication for mobile phones. Section 3 will discuss the availability of Tor clients for mobile devices, followed by detailed sections on specific implementations: Section 4 will cover the Chumby One multimedia alarm clock, Section 5 will focus on the Nokia N900, Section 6 will introduce the Android port, and Section 7 will describe the work on porting Tor to the iPhone platform. Finally, Section 8 will outline future directions for enhancing mobile privacy.

## 2. Mobile Phone (In)Security
The topic of mobile phone security gained prominence in 2008 and saw significant growth in 2009. Several factors contribute to the importance of mobile security:
- **Personal Nature:** Mobile phones are considered personal devices, carried everywhere.
- **Critical Data:** They store call logs, emails, SMS, address books, and documents, often serving as access points to corporate networks.
- **Trusted Environment:** Users, operators, and networks trust each other, sometimes excessively.
- **Closed and Heterogeneous Protocols:** Communication protocols and networks are closed and varied.
- **Fragmented Landscape:** Hardware and software platforms are fragmented, hindering unified security development.

These issues have been extensively explored, particularly in the works of Paget and Nohl on communication security and Pietrosanti on architectural security. Keyboards designed for ease of use can weaken password strength, and small screen sizes make it difficult to verify SSL certificates and detect phishing attacks. Operating system security varies widely, with many systems using an "all or nothing" approach to permissions, and insecure protocols like GSM and SMS remain prevalent.

## 3. Tor on Mobile Phones and Other Unusual Devices
In recent years, Tor has been ported to various mobile devices and unconventional platforms. In December 2009, Tor was run as a bridge on a Chumby One, with an official announcement in February 2010. The first working port for a mobile phone was on the Nokia N900 in late February, followed by an Android port in early March. These developments represent significant steps in making Tor more accessible and widespread.

### 3.1 Challenges in Porting Tor to Mobile Devices
Porting Tor to mobile devices presents several challenges:
- **Platform Heterogeneity:** Different platforms require different approaches, with UNIX-compliant systems being easier to port.
- **Processor Power:** Cryptographic operations can be resource-intensive, impacting performance and battery life.
- **User Interface:** Limited screen space and input methods necessitate a user-friendly interface design.

## 4. Tor on the Chumby One
The Chumby One, a hackable Linux device, was the first unusual device to receive a working Tor port. It runs on an ARM CPU with 64MB of RAM, making it suitable for low-powered, low-bandwidth Tor nodes.

The port, developed by bunnie from bunnie:studios and Jacob Appelbaum from TorProject, was announced in December 2009 and officially integrated into the Tor source tree in February 2010. Installation is straightforward, involving downloading the source code, compiling it, and installing it via a USB key. The Chumby One can function as a bridge without performance issues, but it requires a swap file and lacks an easy update mechanism.

## 5. Tor on Maemo and the Nokia N900
The Nokia N900 was the first mobile phone to receive a working Tor port with a graphical controller application. The Maemo platform supports Tor through a third-party community site. Installation involves adding the Extras-devel repository, which is marked as "dangerous," and then selecting and installing Tor. The controller application allows users to enable or disable the Tor client, though it currently offers limited configuration options.

## 6. Orbot: Tor on Android
Orbot is the latest official TorProject port for Android devices, supporting both version 1.x and 2.x. Installation is simple, involving scanning a QR code from the project page. Orbot includes Tor, libevent, and Privoxy, providing HTTP and SOCKS 4a/5 access. For Android 1.x, users need to download additional applications like ProxySurf and Beem, while Android 2.x users can use general-purpose apps.

## 7. Tor on the iPhone
Porting Tor to the iPhone platform presents unique challenges due to its closed nature and strict app store policies. This section will detail the work done to bring Tor to the iPhone, the improvements it brings to mobile privacy, and the specific issues encountered during the process.

## 8. Future Directions
This final section will discuss the next steps in enhancing mobile privacy, including ongoing research, potential new features, and strategies to mitigate emerging threats.
