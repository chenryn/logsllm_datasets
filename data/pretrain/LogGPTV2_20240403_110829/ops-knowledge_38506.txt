My goal was to duplicate my Google App Engine application. I created a new application and uploaded all the necessary code from the source application (written in Python). Subsequently, I transferred previously created backup files from the Cloud Storage of the source application to the GCS bucket of the target app. The process involved downloading these files onto my PC first and then uploading them to the GCS bucket of the new application.

After completing these steps, I attempted to restore the data using the "Import Backup Information" button. Although the backup information file was successfully located and added to the list of available backups, an error message stating "There was a problem kicking off the jobs. The error was: Backup not readable" appeared when I tried to initiate the restoration process. Interestingly, I was able to successfully restore the data by following the same procedure after re-uploading the files to the original application, indicating that the files themselves are not corrupted.

I am aware that there are alternative methods for copying data between applications, but I specifically wanted to use this approach. My intention is to be prepared for a scenario where my Google account might get compromised, leaving me unable to access the original application's data. In such a case, having the backup data stored on my hard drive would allow me to create a new app and copy all the data over.

Has anyone else encountered a similar issue and, if so, found a solution?

**Response:**

What you're attempting to do is, unfortunately, not feasible due to absolute references within the backup files pointing to the original backup location (bucket). Simply moving the files to another GCS location will not resolve the issue.

Instead, you should leave the backup files in their original GCS bucket and grant your new project read access to that folder. This can be achieved through the "Edit bucket permissions" option. For example, you can add:

- **Project**: `owners-12345678`
- **Role**: `Reader`

By doing this, you will be able to import the backup information from the original bucket in your new project using the "Import Bucket Information" feature.

I hope this helps!
