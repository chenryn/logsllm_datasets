### Trusted Senders and Spam Restriction
Trusted senders, those from unaffiliated domains, will successfully restrict the email received to only messages sent from TripAdvisor. In our case study, this restriction was effective within six days of alias registration. Given that address leaks to spammers typically occur much later in real-world scenarios, it is reasonable to expect that users should not receive spam within the first six days of using their alias for proper functionality.

### 5.2 Affiliation Validation
To study the system in a real-world scenario where a web service requires an official email address for validating user affiliation, we provided students in a class with the option to use the system for receiving updates from a discussion forum that accepts only university domain email addresses. Including three instructors, there were 68 potential participants. The students were neither incentivized nor disincentivized to use SEAL; they could have registered with the discussion forum using their academic email addresses. 

- **Usage Statistics:**
  - 55 (80.9%) participants created aliases and used SEAL actively for the entire semester.
  - Five users created two aliases, one created three aliases, and another created five aliases.
  - The remaining users created one alias each.

**Figure 5(a)** shows the number of emails processed by each alias, and **Figure 5(b)** displays the daily number of active aliases. The low email transaction days coincided with weekends, school breaks, and public holidays. Despite being a prototype, no participants stopped using the system prematurely, demonstrating its practicality.

### 5.3 Email Address Leakages

#### 5.3.1 Leakage by Websites
To examine whether websites and mailing lists are sources of email address leakages, we created aliases and used them to register with 56 websites. We chose these websites arbitrarily by searching for keywords such as "shopping," "fast cash," "movies," "music," "cheap flights," and "education." 

- **Registration Attempts:**
  - Attempted to register with 70 websites, succeeding in 56.
  - Two websites initially rejected registrations due to email ID length restrictions, but we succeeded with shorter aliases.
  - Three websites disallowed the period character in email IDs, which we do not consider a limitation since the RFC allows up to 64 characters with periods [29].
  - The remaining 10 failures were due to requiring credit card information and real cellphone numbers.

We also registered with another 101 websites from 15 categories listed by Alexa as the most popular sites, using unique aliases. Additionally, we subscribed to 15 mailing lists ranked among the most subscribed by L-Soft [30].

After fifteen days, we collected and analyzed the sender domains for each alias. **Figure 6** shows the distribution of different numbers of aliases for varying numbers of unique sender domains. **Table 3** lists examples of the sender domains, showing only the interesting cases for brevity.

#### 5.3.2 Leakages by Online Posts
To study email address leakages through online message postings, we posted messages on seven forums and one popular classified advertising site. For each posting, we generated a new alias and displayed it in the message body. After 15 days, we examined the mail sent to these aliases. **Table 4** shows the sender domains for aliases that received emails.

- **Observed Leakages:**
  - Two leakages occurred on forums hosted by TripAdvisor and WebMD (Cases B1, B3, and B6).
  - Case B1 and B3 are related, with the intended recipient being `bob.m4kkxa4d`, but the email was sent to `m4kkxa4d` due to a parsing error.
  - The email in Case B1 was not forwarded to the user’s email provider.
  - Emails in Cases B4 and B5 were legitimate responses to our forum postings.
  - There were 24 emails from various senders sent to the alias used for posting an advertisement on a classified advertising site (Cases B1 and B6).

### 5.4 Timing Performance
Email systems use a store-and-forward model, and numerous factors contribute to the time taken for an email to reach its recipient. To understand the timing overheads incurred by SEAL, we measured the arrival times of emails at the email relay servers using the Received header field. While this method has limitations, it provides a reasonable approximation.

- **Synchronization and Delays:**
  - SEAL’s clock was synchronized with an NTP server.
  - We computed delays between consecutive entries in the Received header fields.
  - **Table 5** shows the percentages for the five groups of the shortest delays, with 126,794 delays collected from one author’s email account and a SEAL account.
  - The mean and standard deviation for these delays are 105.116 seconds and 21,232.627 seconds, respectively.
  - SEAL incurred 3,706 delays, with the maximum and minimum delays being five and one second, respectively.
  - The average delay contributed by SEAL is 0.274 seconds, which is insignificant compared to other delays.

### 6. Discussion

#### 6.1 Security
Although our construction of semi-private aliases aims to minimize inconvenience to legitimate senders, there are some remaining issues, some of which also apply to existing DEA systems. During the transition of an alias to the restricted state, there are some cases where:

- **Transition Issues:**
  - Some legitimate senders may be temporarily blocked during the transition.
  - These issues can be mitigated by providing clear communication and a grace period for legitimate senders.

This detailed analysis demonstrates the effectiveness and practicality of using SEAL for managing and investigating potential email address leakages.
