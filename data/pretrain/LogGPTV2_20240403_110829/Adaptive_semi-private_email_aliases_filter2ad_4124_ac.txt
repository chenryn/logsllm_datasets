trusted senders (those senders from the unafﬁliated domains) will
successfully restrict the email received to only those messages sent
from tripadvisor. For the case study, this point occurred within
six days from the time the alias was registered. Since we anticipate
that address leaks to spammers would typically occur much later
than this in real-world practice, the need for the user to not receive
spam within the ﬁrst six days of using their alias for correct func-
tionality appears reasonable.
5.2 Afﬁliation Validation
To study the system being used in a real world scenario where
a web service requires an ofﬁcial email address for validating the
user’s afﬁliation, for one semester, we provided the students of a
class an option to use the system for receiving updates from a dis-
cussion forum that accepts only email addresses having university
domains. Including three instructors, there were 68 potential partic-
ipants. The students were neither incentivized nor disincentivized
to use SEAL. They would have been able to register with the dis-
cussion forum using their academic email addresses. 55 (80.9%)
people proceeded to create aliases and used SEAL actively for the
whole semester. Five of the users created two aliases, one created
three aliases, and another created ﬁve aliases. The others created
one alias. Figure 5(a) shows the number of emails processed by

There were mails sent to 88 of the aliases. 62 (70.45%) of the
aliases had senders from only one domain. Having senders from
multiple domains does not necessarily constitute a leak as some
domains are afﬁliated. We deﬁne two domains to be afﬁliated if the
registrants for the domains are the same or they are declared to be
afﬁliated in the privacy policies or terms of service. Referring to
Table 3, we examined the domain afﬁliations for Cases A1 through
A20 and identiﬁed sender domains afﬁliated for each alias.
We noticed that for Cases A21 through A24, the number of unique
sender domains ranged from 13 to 128. We returned to examine
the private policies for these websites. All four policies stated that
email addresses will be shared with other sites. An example of
such a clause is, “We may share User information with third par-
ties as reasonably necessary for us to operate this website and to
provide offers and services to Users". It is easy for users to miss
such clauses as they are usually obscured within lengthy privacy
policies.
In practice, while investigating the sender domains, the ease with
which we were able to ﬁnd all emails sent to a particular alias was
very encouraging. This demonstrated the advantage of using aliases
for investigating potential leakages. Without using aliases, it might
have been an extremely challenging task for the user to distill out
bad websites such as for Cases A21 through A24. The user can
then surgically mark the aliases for these cases as leaked without
affecting the registrations for the good websites.
5.3.2 Leakages by Online Posts
To study the email address leakages through online message post-
ings, we posted messages on seven forums and one popular classi-
ﬁed advertising site. These were found from among the 45 sites we
used in Section 5.3.1. For each posting, we generated a new alias
and displayed it in the clear in the message body. After 15 days, we
examined the mail sent to these aliases. Table 4 shows the sender
domains for aliases that had emails sent to them. We observed
two leakages on two forums hosted by tripadvisor.com and
webmd.com. These are Cases B1, B3, and B6. Cases B1 and B3
are related. Clearly, the sender in Case B1 was intending to send to
bob.m4kkxa4d. However, perhaps due to parsing error, the mail
was sent to m4kkxa4d instead. We were able to observe this ab-
normality because we intercepted all emails sent to our server. The
email in Case B1 was not forwarded to the user’s email provider.
The emails sent in Cases B4 and B5 were legitimate responses to
our forum postings.
In addition, there were 24 emails from various senders sent to
the alias that we used for posting an advertisement on a classiﬁed
advertising site. These are Cases B1 and B6 in Table 4. Based on
Figure 6: Histogram of the number of aliases for different number
of unique sender domains.
SEAL per day while Figure 5(b) shows the daily number of aliases
that were active. The days with low email transactions coincide
with weekends, school break, and public holidays. While not all
aliases may be active daily, the ﬁgures show that the number of
users using the system remains relatively constant throughout the
semester. Even though the system is only a prototype, there were
no participants who stopped using the system prematurely, demon-
strating the practicality of the system prototype.
5.3 Leakages
In this part of the experiments, we examine potential leakages of
email aliases.
5.3.1 Leakage by Websites
To examine whether websites and mailing lists are sources of
email address leakages, we created aliases and used them to reg-
ister with 56 websites. In an attempt to diversify the websites in-
stead of choosing only those ranked as highly popular by survey
companies such as Alexa [28], the websites were chosen arbitrar-
ily by searching for keywords including “shopping”, “fast cash”,
“movies”, “music”, “cheap ﬂights”, and “education”. We attempted
to register with 70 web sites, succeeding in registering on 56 of
them. Two of the websites initially rejected the registrations as
they did not accept email ID lengths exceeding 30 characters. How-
ever, we were able to register successfully after using a shorter alias
name to satisfy that requirement. Three websites disallowed the pe-
riod character in email ids. We do not view this as a limitation of
our system since the RFC clearly states that the email ID may be
up to 64 characters long with the period character allowed [29], and
also since periods are supported by prominent email services like
Gmail. The remaining 10 failures were due to requiring credit card
information and real cellphone numbers.
Using aliases, we also registered with another 101 websites from
15 categories listed by Alexa as the most popular sites using unique
aliases [28]. The 15 categories are arts, business, computers, games,
health, home, kids and teens, news, recreation, reference, regional,
science, shopping, society, and sports. In addition, we subscribed
to 15 mailing lists. The mailing lists were ranked as among those
having the most subscribers by L-Soft, the company that invented
electronic mailing lists [30].
After ﬁfteen days, we collected and analyzed the domains from
which the senders were emailing each of the aliases. We used
the domains contained in the email envelopes instead of the email
headers, although it is easy for an adversary to spoof either the
“From” header or envelope source address. Figure 6 shows the dis-
tribution for the different numbers of aliases for varying numbers
of unique sender domains. Table 3 lists examples of the sender
domains. In the interest of space, only interesting cases are shown.

the email contents, seven of these appear to be legitimate queries,
while the remaining 17 emails contained messages that were irrel-
evant to the original context. Six emails claimed to be from the
administrator of the site, one from FBI and one from a reputable
bank. Eight of them contained links to external suspicious sites.
5.4 Timing Performance
Email systems use a store-and-forward model. Numerous fac-
tors contribute towards the time taken for an email to be sent to
its recipient, including network latency, spam or virus detection ﬁl-
tering, and overloaded relay servers. While delays are generally
tolerable, any additional processing on the emails by servers such
as SEAL should be reasonable. Towards understanding the tim-
ing overheads incurred by SEAL, we measured the arrival times
of emails at the email relay servers as indicated by the time stated
in the Received header ﬁeld. While this is not ideal for several
reasons including clock skew between different servers, incorrect
date and time on some servers, and timing information having only
a granularity of seconds, it allows us to approximate the overhead
incurred by SEAL. Moreover, the lack of access to other servers
does not allow us a detailed comparison of performance data.
We synchronized SEAL’s clock with an NTP server and assume
that other servers did the same. The Received header ﬁelds are
added by each SMTP server as the email is accepted. Figure 7
shows an example of these ﬁelds for an email. We compute the
differences between the timestamps of two consecutive entries and
refer to them as delays. In the example, we use the delay between
entries 2 and 3 as an indication of the processing time required by
SEAL to analyze and forward the email. At entry 2, the email is
marked as received by SEAL, after which it is processed. It is then
sent to the outgoing queue with entry 3 added. While we could
have timed the scripts, the lack of data from other servers would
render any comparison meaningless.
Table 5 shows the percentages for the ﬁve groups of the shortest
delays. 126,794 delays for emails were collected from one of the
author’s email accounts and a SEAL account. The mean and stan-
dard deviation for these delays is 105.116 seconds and 21,232.627
seconds respectively. 3,706 delays were incurred by SEAL, with
the maximum and minimum delays being ﬁve and one seconds re-
spectively. The average delay contributed by SEAL is 0.274 sec-
onds. This is at 0.00494 standard deviation away from the mean.
This can also be inferred from Table 5 that shows the percentages
for the ﬁve groups of shortest delays. 81.383% of the delays are
from zero seconds to one second, in which SEAL’s average delay
lies. The delay incurred by SEAL is thus insigniﬁcant in compari-
son to other delays.
6. DISCUSSION
6.1 Security
Although our construction of semi-private aliases seeks to min-
imize inconvenience to legitimate senders, there are remaining is-
sues, some of which also apply to existing DEA systems. During
the transition of an alias to the restricted state, there are some cases
