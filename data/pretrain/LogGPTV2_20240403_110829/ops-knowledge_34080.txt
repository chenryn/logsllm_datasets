User:  How to configure the highly available MySQL master-slave synchronization mode to ensure data consistency and availability?
Assistant: Configuring the high-availability MySQL master-slave synchronization mode can realize data backup, load balancing and fault recovery. The following are the specific steps: 1. Install and configure the MySQL server, and determine the IP address and port number of the master server and slave server. 2. Create a user for synchronization on the primary server and grant REPLICATION SLAVE permission. 3. Set up the master server's connection information on the slave server and start the replication process on the slave server to receive data from the master server. 4. Configure the log recording mode of the master server and the slave server so that the slave server can receive the binlog data of the master server, for example, enable binlog on the master server, and set parameters such as relay-log on the slave server. 5. Configure the synchronization strategy between the master and slave servers. For example, you can choose to use GTID or BINLOG as the synchronization identifier to ensure data consistency. 6. For high availability requirements, VIP or DNS can be used to achieve load balancing to ensure that any server can automatically switch to another server when it goes down. 7. Regularly back up data, and realize off-site backup and disaster recovery of data to improve data availability. It should be noted that the master-slave synchronization mode cannot completely avoid data loss and failure, but it can greatly reduce the impact of data loss and failure.
