**Applies to:**
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
The `rpcinfo` command-line utility is used to list programs on remote computers by making a remote procedure call (RPC) to an RPC server and reporting the results.

**Syntax:**
```sh
rpcinfo [/p <host>] [/b <program> <version>] [/t <host> <program> [<version>]] [/u <host> <program> [<version>]] [/?]
```

**Parameters:**

- **/p [host]**
  - Lists all programs registered with the port mapper on the specified host. If no host is specified, the local host is queried.
  
- **/b <program> <version>**
  - Requests a response from all network nodes that have the specified program and version registered with the port mapper. Both the program name or number and the version number must be specified.
  
- **/t <host> <program> [<version>]**
  - Uses the TCP transport protocol to call the specified program. Both the host (computer) name and the program name must be specified. If no version is specified, all versions of the program are called.
  
- **/u <host> <program> [<version>]**
  - Uses the UDP transport protocol to call the specified program. Both the host (computer) name and the program name must be specified. If no version is specified, all versions of the program are called.
  
- **/?**
  - Displays help at the command prompt.

**Examples:**

- To list all programs registered with the port mapper on a specified host:
  ```sh
  rpcinfo /p <host>
  ```

- To request a response from network nodes that have a specified program and version:
  ```sh
  rpcinfo /b <program> <version>
  ```

- To use Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) to call a program on a specified host:
  ```sh
  rpcinfo /t <host> <program> [<version>]
  ```

- To use User Datagram Protocol (UDP) to call a program on a specified host:
  ```sh
  rpcinfo /u <host> <program> [<version>]
  ```

This utility is useful for diagnosing and managing RPC services on Windows Server systems.
