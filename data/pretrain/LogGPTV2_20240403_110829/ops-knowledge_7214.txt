User: I would like to be able to run multiple, typically long processes, over different machines connected over a local network.
Processes would generally be python scripts.
In other words, suppose that I have 100 processes and 5 machines, and I don't want to run more than 10 processes on each machine at the same time.
My "organiser-script" would then start 10 processes per machine, then send the next ones as the first ones end.
Is there any way to do this in python?
Any suggestion would be very much appreciated!
Thank you!
Assistant: In addition to your "organiser-script" you will need some program/script on each of the other machines, that listens on the network for commands from the "organiser-script", starts "workers" and reports when "workers" have finished.
But there are existing solutions for your task. Take a good look around before you start coding.
