The Seattle UA has incorporated all previous regional SOPs (some dating back more than a decade) into the 
area’s TICP.  Although most UA agencies assisted in TICP development and have indicated a high-level of 
commitment to the SOPs, it appears the recently established policies, practices, and procedures (established 
through TICP process) have not been disseminated to the necessary agencies.  However, the UA was still

able to effectively use the SOPs during the TICP validation exercises.  Participants experienced some minor 
deficiencies (e.g., Northgate did not observe the “priority” order identified in the TICP to request 
interoperable communications equipment).  The Seattle UA implemented SOPs in compliance with the 
National Incident Management System (NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS) more than 1 year ago, and 
indicated that 95 percent of personnel had participated in NIMS/ICS training.  During the TICP validation 
exercise, proper adherence to effective command and control SOPs was successfully demonstrated by the 
Northgate communications unit while the Kilroy Towers communications unit experienced problems (e.g., 
resource request protocols, Communications Unit Leader integration). 
Recommendations: 
• 
Demonstrate the use of regional communications interoperability SOPs during future exercises (e.g., 
radio cache, shared channels) 
• 
Ensure that regional communications interoperability SOPs (beyond the TICP) are fully developed 
through a comprehensive interoperability plan beyond first responders (e.g., U.S. Coast Guard), and 
provide training on these SOPs 
• 
Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (include communications unit 
implementation consistent with the TICP) to ensure that all participating first responder agencies attain 
and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance

The Seattle UA regularly uses the four 800 megahertz (MHz) systems in the area for multi-agency and, to a 
lesser extent, multidiscipline communications.  In addition, the UA uses shared channels and gateways on a 
daily basis.  As noted by evaluators, all means of interoperability (e.g., radio caches, gateways, shared 
channels, shared systems) were successfully used and demonstrated in the area.  For example, during the 
TICP validation exercise a Pierce County Sheriff arrived on scene and needed to communicate with the law 
branch, the staging manager recognized the need for a cached radio and identified a radio for the Sheriff.  
However, some minor problems were also encountered with the use of gateways and radio programming 
during the exercise (e.g., patch problems, participant instructed to tune to a channel not programmed on his 
radio). 
Recommendations: 
• 
Regularly test and exercise deployment of regional communications interoperability resources to 
improve proficiency (e.g., radio cache, shared channels) 
• 
Practice multijurisdictional and multidiscipline communications during future exercises and day-to-day 
activities

The Seattle UA currently uses four Motorola 800 MHz SmartZone™ 4.1 systems for communications in King County, 
Snohomish County, Pierce County, and the Port of Seattle.  Communications among these radio systems are established 
using the Tri-County Regional Interoperability System (TRIS) fixed gateway console patching network.  The UA also 
uses two other systems.  One is a statewide very high frequency conventional system used in conjunction with the 
Washington State Patrol.  The other is an 800 MHz EF Johnson trunked system that connects them to the Washington 
Department of Transportation.  Future plans include installation of infrastructure to support a repeated simulcast 800 
MHz ICALL/ITAC system.  The present capabilities will serve the Seattle UA for many years to come.  Currently, the 
primary UA concern is 800 MHz rebanding and how that will take place.

The Milwaukee Urban Area Working Group includes local, state, and federal participants (e.g., public health, State 
Highway Patrol, and Wisconsin Army National Guard).  Its Communications Subcommittee is ad hoc, but is codified in 
the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP).  From the information provided, it is unclear whether the 
subcommittee includes active state and federal agency participation, which would demonstrate a more advanced degree 
of governance maturity.  A mix of formal and informal agreements exists within the area, and the UA is working to 
expand the formal partnerships (e.g., National Guard SOP is currently under review by the Milwaukee Police 
Department).  The continued development of documented agreements would support the formalization of these 
partnerships to ensure clear roles and responsibilities relating to communications interoperability issues and decisions.  
The Milwaukee UA is beginning to develop a strategic plan for interoperable communications.  Through federal and 
state grants, the organizations within the UA give consideration to regional interoperable communications while 
procuring equipment and developing budgets.  However, there is no longer term plan for sustainable funding to meet 
interoperable communications goals.  Although the local leadership is strong (demonstrated through apportioned 
funding requests), there are regional leadership differences (limited city and county cooperation) that affect political and 
fiscal support. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Expand Communications Subcommittee membership to formally include public support, state, and federal agencies 
(e.g., U.S. Coast Guard) and document roles and responsibilities as part of the group 
• 
Reference all applicable agreements (e.g., memoranda of understanding [MOU], intergovernmental agreements) in 
the TICP and store them in an accessible format 
• 
Document and formalize agreements (e.g., signed MOUs with defined roles and responsibilities) among all 
participating agencies to support partnerships on regional interoperability 
• 
Develop, document, and implement a regional strategic plan (beyond the operational focus of the TICP) with 
participant approval, adoption, and acceptance, that takes into account a long-term communications funding 
strategy (in addition to grants) 
• 
Consider outreach to expand participation in strategic planning process 
• 
Align local and state strategic planning efforts to ensure that regional interoperability needs are met 
• 
Initiate the development and implementation of a regional approach to long-term (e.g., 3 to 5 years) sustainable 
funding that is consistent with the strategic plan 
• 
Continue to broaden and champion a governance structure that will support regional communications 
interoperability and involve senior regional government leadership in long-term funding plans

The SOPs included in Milwaukee’s TICP represent the UA’s first regional consensus plan for interoperable 
communications.  Although current regional communications interoperability SOPs are limited, the area plans to train 
on and has made an effort to disseminate them to the participating organizations.  According to the TICP validation

specific procedures are documented in the TICP for these interoperability solutions.  The UA began implementing 
National Incident Management System (NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS) less than 1 year ago, which implies 
that the UA is still in the earlier stages of implementing NIMS/ICS policies and procedures.  Despite the short period of 
time during which NIMS/ICS procedures have been in place, the UA demonstrated process familiarity during the TICP 
validation exercise.  During the course of the exercise, it was noted that participants would have used commercial 
cellular technology (i.e., “NEXTELs”) in lieu of shared channels in a real-life response if radio reception were poor; 
there are no SOPs in the TICP addressing the use of cellular commercial technology. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Continue to develop and distribute regional communications interoperability SOPs (beyond the TICP) and put them 
into practice through regular training, exercises, and usage (e.g., written SOPs needed for shared channels and 
gateways) 
• 
Document, distribute, and verify all points of contact for each agency communications center 
• 
Consider developing policy on use and limitations of commercial services (e.g., cellular telephones) 
• 
Consider scheduling a regular review and update process for policies and procedures 
• 
Initiate basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (include communications unit implementation 
consistent with the TICP) to ensure that all participating first responder agencies attain and maintain NIMS/ICS

The area frequently uses its available means of interoperable communications (i.e., radio cache, gateways, shared 
channels, and shared systems).  Additionally, officials in the area report proficiency during real-world events (e.g., 
vehicle pursuit crossing city–county borders).  During the TICP validation exercise, the participants were able to 
establish interoperable communications with minimal difficulty (e.g., poor reception on shared channels, do not have 
common talk groups for fire and police). However, because there were no state and federal participants in the exercise, 
the area did not fully demonstrate interoperable communications among local, state, and federal agencies in the area. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Regularly test and exercise the deployment of regional interoperability resources (e.g., Milwaukee law enforcement 
and fire do not have common talk groups) to improve proficiency  
• 
Consider including additional state and federal agencies (e.g., Federal Bureau of Investigation) in future exercises 
and day-to-day use 
• 
Consider adding interoperable communications as an evaluation component for all future exercises and day-to-day 
activities

The UA’s mixture of very high frequency, ultra high frequency, and 800 megahertz (MHz) communications systems 
support most agencies in the area.  Milwaukee and Waukesha County have individual, trunked, Motorola® SmartNetTM 
Type II, 800 MHz communications systems.  The City of Greenfield has a Motorola, single site, trunked 
communications system.  The City of Milwaukee currently uses a conventional system that supports both the 
Milwaukee Police and Fire Departments.  The area’s main Public Safety Answering Points can make console patches 
among supported agencies’ channels and communication systems.  Milwaukee County is building out a Project 25 
communication system that could replace the old county system.  The City of Milwaukee is installing a M/A-COM 
OpenSkyTM system to initially support the city’s mobile data needs and later support city agencies with mission-critical 
voice communications.

The tables included in this appendix outline the results developed for Standard Operating 
Procedures (SOP), Usage, and Governance for the 22 metropolitan areas and 5 territories that 
developed and exercised TICPs.  The results represent the summary assessment of each 
Continuum element taking into account critical “sub-elements” identified in the Interoperability 
Maturity Measurement Model developed as part of the SAFECOM National Baseline Assessment.  
The Baseline approach to defining the aspects of communications interoperability was leveraged to 
ensure consistency in the measurement models applied to various Department of Homeland 
Security (DHS) initiatives.   
In the case of SOPs, the sub-elements include: 1) policies, practices, and procedures and 
2) command and control.  Usage focuses on the frequency of use and familiarity with 
interoperability solutions.  Governance focuses on five core sub-elements, including: 1) decision-
making groups, 2) agreements, 3) strategic planning, 4) interoperability funding, and 5) leadership.   
Each score can be defined as early, intermediate, established, or advanced implementation of the 
given element.  Below, general definitions for each score are provided.  
First responders regularly 
and seamlessly utilize 
interoperability solutions.  
The region demonstrated 
successful multi-agency 
communications during 
exercise(s), including state, 
federal and support 
organizations.
First responders use 
interoperability solutions 
regularly and easily.  The

despite some challenges 
during exercise(s).
Interoperable 
communications solutions 
are rarely used for multi-
agency communication and 
difficulties were encountered 
in achieving interoperability 
during exercise(s).
Usage
Regional SOPs, reviewed 
through the TICP process, 
are in place and regularly 
used by included 
agencies. NIMS procedures 
are well established among 
all agencies and 
disciplines. All procedures 
were effectively utilized 
during exercise(s). 
Existing regional SOPs were 
reviewed and included in the 
TICP, and are in use by 
included agencies. NIMS-
compliant command and 
control has been instituted by 
all agencies and disciplines in 
the region. Despite minor 
issues, all SOPs were 
successfully demonstrated 
during exercise(s).
Some existing SOPs were 
incorporated in the TICP and 
steps have been taken to 
institute these interoperability 
procedures among included 
agencies. Formal NIMS/ICS 
procedures are in place, but 
understanding varies among 
agencies leading to some 
issues during the exercise(s).
Region-wide SOPs were 
developed and formalized for 
the first time through the 
TICP, but have not been 
disseminated to all included 
agencies. Some elements of 
NIMS/ICS procedures for 
command and control are in 
place, but understanding 
varies among agencies and 
was an area of difficulty 
during exercise(s).
