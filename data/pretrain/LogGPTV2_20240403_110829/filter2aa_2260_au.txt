### Recommendations for Enhancing Regional Interoperability

#### 1. Formalize and Document Agreements
- **Objective:** Establish clear, documented agreements (e.g., memoranda of understanding) among all participating agencies to support regional interoperability.
- **Actions:**
  - Draft and formalize interagency agreements.
  - Ensure that all agreements are signed and include defined roles and responsibilities.

#### 2. Develop and Implement a Regional Strategic Plan
- **Objective:** Create a comprehensive, long-term strategic plan for regional interoperability with participant approval, adoption, and acceptance.
- **Actions:**
  - Develop a strategic plan that goes beyond the operational focus of the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP).
  - Align local and state strategic planning efforts to ensure regional interoperability needs are met.
  - Secure sustainable funding in addition to grants to support the strategic plan.

#### 3. Establish a Governance Structure
- **Objective:** Identify and appoint a champion or champions to establish a governance structure that supports the regional strategic plan.
- **Actions:**
  - Appoint a dedicated leader or leadership team to oversee the governance structure.
  - Involve senior government leadership broadly across the area to support interoperability initiatives.

#### 4. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
- **Objective:** Develop, document, and implement regional SOPs to ensure consistent and effective interoperability.
- **Actions:**
  - Incorporate all previous regional SOPs into the TICP and update them as necessary.
  - Disseminate the updated SOPs to all relevant agencies.
  - Provide training on the SOPs to ensure all personnel are familiar with and can effectively use them.

#### 5. Regular Testing and Training
- **Objective:** Regularly test and exercise the deployment of regional communications interoperability resources to improve proficiency.
- **Actions:**
  - Conduct regular exercises to test the use of radio caches, shared channels, and other interoperability solutions.
  - Include multijurisdictional and multidiscipline communications in future exercises and day-to-day activities.
  - Continue basic and advanced training on NIMS/ICS compliance to ensure all participating first responder agencies maintain high standards.

### Summary of Existing Technology

#### Seattle Urban Area (UA)
- **Technology Overview:**
  - The Seattle UA uses four Motorola 800 MHz SmartZone™ 4.1 systems for communications in King County, Snohomish County, Pierce County, and the Port of Seattle.
  - Communication among these systems is established using the Tri-County Regional Interoperability System (TRIS) fixed gateway console patching network.
  - Additional systems include a statewide very high frequency conventional system and an 800 MHz EF Johnson trunked system.
  - Future plans include the installation of infrastructure to support a repeated simulcast 800 MHz ICALL/ITAC system.

#### Milwaukee, WI
- **Technology Overview:**
  - The Milwaukee UA has a mix of very high frequency, ultra-high frequency, and 800 MHz communications systems.
  - Milwaukee and Waukesha County have individual, trunked, Motorola® SmartNetTM Type II, 800 MHz communications systems.
  - The City of Greenfield has a Motorola, single-site, trunked communications system.
  - The City of Milwaukee uses a conventional system for the Police and Fire Departments.
  - Milwaukee County is building out a Project 25 communication system, and the City of Milwaukee is installing a M/A-COM OpenSkyTM system for mobile data and mission-critical voice communications.

### Appendix B: Metropolitan Area Scorecards

#### Definitions of Implementation Levels

- **Advanced Implementation:**
  - First responders regularly and seamlessly utilize interoperability solutions.
  - The region demonstrated successful multi-agency communications during exercises, including state, federal, and support organizations.
  - Regional SOPs, reviewed through the TICP process, are in place and regularly used by included agencies.
  - Decision-making bodies proactively expand membership and update agreements and strategic plans regularly.

- **Established Implementation:**
  - First responders use interoperability solutions regularly and easily.
  - The region demonstrated successful multi-agency communications during exercises.
  - Existing regional SOPs were reviewed and included in the TICP and are in use by included agencies.
  - Formal agreements outline the roles and responsibilities of a decision-making group, which has an agreed-upon strategic plan addressing sustainable funding.

- **Intermediate Implementation:**
  - First responders use interoperability solutions regularly but face some challenges.
  - Some existing SOPs were incorporated in the TICP, and steps have been taken to institute these procedures.
  - Some formal agreements exist, and informal agreements are in practice among members of a decision-making group; regional strategic and budget planning processes are beginning to be put in place.

- **Early Implementation:**
  - Interoperable communications solutions are rarely used for multi-agency communication, and difficulties were encountered during exercises.
  - Region-wide SOPs were developed and formalized for the first time through the TICP but have not been disseminated to all included agencies.
  - Decision-making groups are informal and do not yet have a strategic plan in place to guide collective communications interoperability goals and funding.
