A.1 Selected Trademarks
Table 9 depicts the categories and respective number of trademarks
for each category we used to identify combosquatting domain
names. The second column provides an example of a trademark for
each category.
A.2 Most Frequent Words per Category
Table 10 summarizes the ten most frequent words for each trade-
mark category. There, we see that many of the popular words
closely correlate with the type of trademark being abused, such as,
the words apple, game, and phones being popular in the “Comput-
ers/Internet” category and the words president, vote, and elect in
the “Politics” category.
Moreover, we want to highlight the lists of words in the Couriers
and Financial categories. Several of the trademarks used in both
categories have been victims of spear phishing attacks according to
Garera et al. [40]. Additionally, words like tracking, delivery, service,
and account are used in both the creation of phishing domains and
phishing emails [37]. These results clearly indicate that most regis-
tered combosquatting domains have been carefully constructed by
attackers to match the expected context of each abused trademark
and can be used for a variety of purposes, ranging from trademark
abuse to phishing and spear-phishing campaigns.
A.3 Combosquatting APT Domains
Table 11 shows a list of combosquatting domain names related to
Advanced Persistent Threats (APT). These domains were found
