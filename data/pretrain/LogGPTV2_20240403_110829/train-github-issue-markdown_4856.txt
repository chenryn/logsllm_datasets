Using Typescript 1.7.3.
Here is some sample code:
    var MainMenu:React.StatelessComponent = (props)=>(
        Main Menu
    );
    var App:React.StatelessComponent = ({children}) => (
    );
The line containing `` inside `App` will throw this error msg:
    Error:(5, 3) TS2605: JSX element type 'ReactElement' is not a constructor function for JSX elements.
     Property 'render' is missing in type 'ReactElement'.
At first I thought this was #6349 but even assigning a type to props in
`MainMenu` doesnt help.
