Squatting Domain Identification.
is to generate squatting domains for the target brands. Unfortu-
nately, the state-of-the-art tools such as DNSTwist [3] and URL-
crazy [15] are not very applicable to our case. First, existing tools are
primarily designed to generated typo squatting and bits squatting
domains. They cannot effectively handle combo squatting domains
or domains that change the TLD. For example, URL-crazy can gen-
erate facebookj.com based on typo squatting for facebook.com, but
would miss a domain facebookj.es that exists in our DNS records.
In addition, existing tools are very incomplete in detecting homo-
graph domains. The most important type of homograph domains is
the internationalized domain names that exploit the unicode confu-
sion [14]. We find that tools like DNSTwist fail to map the complete
list of similar unicode characters. For example, there are 23 differ-
ent unicode characters that look similar to the letter “a" [14], but
DNSTwist only catches 13 of them. These limitations will seriously
hurt our chance of capturing squatting phishing pages.
To these ends, we develop our own system to capture squat-
ting domains given a target brand. Our system is extended from
DNSTwist and URL-crazy with (1) a more complete detection of ho-
mograph domains, (2) a new module to detect wrongTLD domains,
and (3) a module to handle combo squatting domains [40]. Below,
we provide details on the 5 types of squatting domains our system
can capture. We use the real-world examples shown in Table 1 to
explain each squatting type. We define the 5 types to be orthogonal
from each other for the ease of measurement later.
• Homograph: Homograph based squatting refers to squat-
ting domains that look similar to the target domains in the
vision perception. For example, two characters “rn” can be
used to impersonate the character “m”. faceb00k is a homo-
graph squatting to facebook since 00 looks similar to oo.
More advanced homograph squatting exploit internation-
alized domain names (IDN). IDN utilizes Punycode encod-
ing to convert unicode characters to ASCII. For example,
xn--fcebook-8va.com is the homograph IDN. After IDN
translation, the domain is presented as fàcebook.com in the
browser’s address bar.
• Typo: Typo squatting aims to mimic the incorrectly typed
domain names by users. There are several methods to gener-
ate typo squatting based on a given target domain, including
insertion (adding a character), omission (deleting a char-
acter), repetition (duplicating a character) and vowel swap
(re-ordering two consecutive characters). Insertion refers

to adding an additional character to the original domain.
Omission refers to deleting a character in the domain. Repe-
tition refers to repeating a character in the domain. Vowel
swap refers to reordering two consecutive characters in the
domain. For example, facebo0ok.com is a typo squatting do-
main by inserting 0. fcaebook.org is also a typo squatting
domain by reordering a and c in the domain name.
• Bits: Bits squatting is to flip a bit of the domain name. A bits
squatting domain is only one-bit different from the target
domain. For example, facebnok.tk is bits squatting domain
where one bit o is changed to n.
• Combo: Combo squatting is to concatenate the target do-
main name with other characters. The concatenation could
be either attached to the head or tail. In our analysis, we par-
ticularly focus on the combo squatting with hyphens which
are allowed in the domain name. For example, facebook-story
is the combo squatting where new characters are attached
to the tail of facebook with a hyphen.
• WrongTLD: All the above squatting techniques focus on
the domain name but ignore the TLD. WrongTLD refers to
domains that change the TLD but keep the domain name as
the same. For example, facebook.audi belongs to the wrongTLD
category since the original TLD com is changed to audi.
For a given brand,
Domain Squatting Detection Results.
we search through the DNS records to look for squatting domains.
For each DNS domain, we check all 5 squatting rules against the
target domain. If a match is found, we label the DNS domain with
the squatting type. During the domain matching, we ignore sub-
domains. For example, mail.google-app.de is regarded as a combo
squatting domain because the domain name google-app is a combo
squatting of the target brand google.
In total, we detect 657,663 squatting domains for the 702 target
brands. Figure 2 presents the distribution of different squatting
types. Clearly, combo squatting is the most common type (56%).
Intuitively, combo-squatting is easy to register since one can add
arbitrary words to the original domain and connect them with a
hyphen. Other squatting domains such as typo-squatting would be
more competitive since there are only limited ways to impersonate
the target domain name.
Figure 3 shows that the number of squatting domains per brand is
highly skewed. More specifically, we sort the brands based on their
number of squatting domains, and calculate the accumulated ratio
of squatting domains that the top brands generated. We observe
that the top 20 brands are responsible for more than 30% of the
squatting domains. Note that the top brands here are not necessarily
the most popular websites. Figure 4 presents the top 5 brands that
matched the largest number of squatting domains. Typically, these
domains either contains generic English word (e.g., apple, vice) or
the length is too short (e.g., bt).
3.2 Web Crawling
To detect squatting phishing pages from a large number of squatting
domains, we need to collect the web pages from each of the domains.
At the high level, we aim to collect both their web version and
mobile version of the pages to compare the potential differences.
In addition, to assist our later classification tasks, we collect both
the HTML source code and the screenshot for each page.
To obtain the complete HTML content, we

cannot simply query the static page using scripts like curl. In-
stead, we use headless browsers to load the dynamic content before
saving the page. More specifically, we use the recently released
Puppeteer [10], which is the headless Chrome. We have tested
other alternative browsers such as Selenium [11, 31]. However,
we find that Selenium is error-prone when crawling webpages at
the million-level [5]. Given the high overhead of the large-scale
dynamic crawling, we cannot exhaustively test all the possible
browser versions and browser types. We choose a Chrome browser
for its reliability. A potential limitation is that we might miss the
cloaking websites that are specifically targeting IE explorer or other
particular browsers. With Puppeteer, we build a distributed crawler
to scan the 657K squatting domains and obtain the HTML content
and take screenshots for the pages. Note that our crawling intro-
duces almost no overhead to the target websites. Each website only
receives 1-2 requests for each scan.
For each domain, we capture both

Chrome 65 to obtain the mobile and web pages respectively. The
data will help to analyze potential cloaking behavior or phishing
pages that specifically target mobile or web users.

implement our own distributed crawling by allocating a kernel-
level shared memory segment count. Each time, we fork a list
of children processes and utilizes shmget in IPC (inter process
communication) to balance the workload of each process. This
allows us to the maximize the usage of CPUs for the web crawling.
We run the crawler on 5 machines (24 cores, 196GB RAM) and open
20 Puppeteer simultaneously.
From April 01 to April 08 in 2018,
Web Crawling Statistics.
we collected one snapshot of the full 657,663 domains covering both
the web and mobile pages. We use this snapshot to detect squatting
phishing pages. From April 09 to April 29 in 2018, we collect three
additional snapshots only for the detected squatting phishing pages
(one week apart between consecutive snapshots). Table 2 provides
the statistics for the full snapshot. For the web version, we find that
362,545 domains are live and reachable. For the mobile version, we
obtain data from 354,297 live domains. Overall, about 55% of the
squatting domains are live during the time of crawling. Among the
live domains, we find that most of them (87%) have no redirection
and 13% of the domains redirect the crawler to other domains.
Interestingly, 6,115 domains (1.7%) redirect the crawler to the
original target domain. This indicates that the target brands in-
deed purchased squatting domains to redirect their users back to
the correct websites. Table 3 shows the top brands whose squat-
ting domains that the highest chance to redirect users to back to
the original websites. Some of the top brands are related to sen-
sitive services such as health (ZocDoc) and banking (Comerica,
Alliancebank) These brands are likely to protect their users (and
their reputation) by registering the squatting domains themselves.
In addition, we find some squatting domains will redirect users
to some domain marketplaces where domain names are put out for
sale (e.g., marketmonitor). To measure the level of such redirection,
we manually compiled a list of 22 known domain marketplaces.
We find that 10,734 squatting domains (3%) would redirect users to
one of the domain marketplaces. Table 4 shows top brands whose
squatting domains have the highest chance to redirect users to do-
main markets. Not surprisingly, a large number squatting domains
targeting popular brands such as Amazon and Paypal are listed
on the market for sale. We find 2,168 Amazon squatting domains
redirect to domain markets.
4 CHARACTERIZING EVASIONS
So far, we have collected a large set of squatting domains and their
webpages. Next we aim to systematically detect squatting phish-
ing pages. To develop an effective phishing detection system, we
need to understand whether and how phishing pages are currently
and actively evading common detection methods in practice. Such
knowledge will help to design more reliable features to capture
squatting phishing pages. In the following, we first collect and la-
bel ground-truth phishing pages and then perform a preliminary
analysis their evasion techniques.
