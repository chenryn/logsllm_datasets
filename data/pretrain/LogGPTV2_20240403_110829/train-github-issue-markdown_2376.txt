It would be beneficial to utilize `v-bind` with an object of attributes to pass props to a component. Currently, we need to explicitly list each prop that we are passing to the component.

For example, instead of writing:

```vue
<ChildComponent prop1="value1" prop2="value2" prop3="value3" />
```

We could write:

```vue
<ChildComponent v-bind="propsObject" />
```

Where `propsObject` is defined as:

```javascript
const propsObject = {
  prop1: 'value1',
  prop2: 'value2',
  prop3: 'value3'
};
```

This approach would make the code more concise and maintainable, especially when dealing with a large number of props.
