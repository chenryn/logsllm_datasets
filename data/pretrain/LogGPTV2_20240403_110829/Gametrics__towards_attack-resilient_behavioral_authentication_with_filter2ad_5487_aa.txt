ABSTRACT
Authenticating a user based on her unique behavioral bio-
metric traits has been extensively researched over the past
few years. The most researched behavioral biometrics tech-
niques are based on keystroke and mouse dynamics. These
schemes, however, have been shown to be vulnerable to
human-based and robotic attacks that attempt to mimic the
user’s behavioral pattern to impersonate the user.
In this paper, we aim to verify the user’s identity through
the use of active, cognition-based user interaction in the au-
thentication process. Such interaction boasts to provide two
key advantages. First, it may enhance the security of the au-
thentication process as multiple rounds of active interaction
would serve as a mechanism to prevent against several types
of attacks, including zero-eﬀort attack, expert trained at-
tackers, and automated attacks. Second, it may enhance the
usability of the authentication process by actively engaging
the user in the process.
We
the
explore
cognitive authentication paradigm
through very simplistic interactive challenges, called Dy-
namic Cognitive Games, which involve objects ﬂoating
around within the images, where the user’s task is to match
the objects with their respective target(s) and drag/drop
them to the target location(s). Speciﬁcally, we introduce,
build and study Gametrics (“Game-based biometrics”), an
authentication mechanism based on the unique way the user
solves such simple challenges captured by multiple features
related to her cognitive abilities and mouse dynamics. Based
on a comprehensive data set collected in both online and
lab settings, we show that Gametrics can identify the users
with a high accuracy (false negative rates, FNR, as low
as 0.02) while rejecting zero-eﬀort attackers (false positive
rates, FPR, as low as 0.02). Moreover, Gametrics shows
promising results in defending against expert attackers that
try to learn and later mimic the user’s pattern of solving
the challenges (FPR for expert human attacker as low as
0.03). Furthermore, we argue that the proposed biometrics
is hard to be replayed or spoofed by automated means, such
as robots or malware attacks.

INTRODUCTION
Behavioral biometrics is one of the most active research
topics in the area of user authentication. The most stud-
ied behavioral biometrics technique is keystroke dynamics
[2, 20], a method in which the typing patterns are used to
build a unique signature of a user, that can be used for point-
of-entry authentication (e.g., when combined with the dy-
namics involved in typing a password). Other widely stud-
ied behavioral biometrics techniques include mouse move-
ment patterns [35], and swiping patterns [11] for touchscreen
devices. However, these existing behavioral biometrics ap-
proaches have two fundamental limitations, which have pos-
sibly prevented their transition into real-world application
despite signiﬁcant research:
• The false negative rate (i.e., the possibility of falsely
rejecting the legitimate user) is relatively high, which
undermines the overall usability and real-world accept-
ability, as users may fail to login to their accounts on
a relatively frequent basis.
• The false positive rate (i.e., the possibility of falsely
accepting a “diﬀerent user”) is relatively high, which
weakens the overall security.
In addition, and per-
haps more seriously, a determined attacker (a human
or a bot) can deliberately/actively mimic the user’s
activities (e.g., typing or swiping) and compromise
the authentication functionality, for instance, based on
the global characteristics of typing patterns as shown
in [29], or a user-speciﬁc (previously leaked) authen-
tication template as shown in [31]. Existing schemes
have also been shown vulnerable to internal attacks
where the device from which the users logs in is itself
compromised with a malware [19].
These limitations stem from the fact that existing behav-
ioral authentication approaches lack enough randomization
and identifying “cues”, especially when the duration of input
is short (e.g., for point-of-entry authentication), necessary to
uniquely identify the user, negatively aﬀecting user experi-
ence and facilitating passive and active adversarial spooﬁng.
In this paper, to overcome the limitations of the cur-
rent behavioral biometrics systems, we propose Gametrics,
a novel system of interactive game-based behavioral biomet-
rics. Whenever users wish to authenticate to a device or ser-
vice, Gametrics would simply request them to play a short
and simple cognitive game. Once identiﬁed, permission to
access an account or device can be granted via a back end
database as is done with existing behavioral biometric solu-
tions. Games are a good platform for the purpose of authen-
tication since web browsers and touch screen devices fully
support them.
In contrast to traditional behavioral biometrics, due to
their randomized, dynamic, interactive and cognitive nature,
cognitive games oﬀer an attractive platform using which suf-
ﬁcient cues in a short period of time could be extracted.
In our proposed Gametrics system, the users will be au-
thenticated based on their multiple multi-modal gameplay
patterns as well as mouse dynamics. Speciﬁcally, Gamet-
rics utilizes various characteristics of the users’ interactions
with the games: (1) active and idle time [6]; (2) cognitive
abilities [1], such as visual search, and working memory &
information processing speed, and (3) mouse dynamics, such
as mean click length, average click rate, as well as distance,
speed, and angle at which the mouse is moved [24, 26]. This
type of data is already being collected and mined by video
game companies for marketing [10, 12] and quality control
purposes, which supports the plausibility of gaming-based
biometrics as a general authentication solution deployable
in the near future. As an example, the Valve Corporation
collects extensive information on users through its Steam
platform and publishes real time statistics for its most pop-
ular games online [32].
Gametrics provides signiﬁcant advantages in terms of se-
curity and usability of the user authentication process. First,
it can signiﬁcantly help improve the security of authentica-
tion in comparison to existing solutions. Gametrics can be
utilized as a stronger behavioral biometrics [2, 20] since the
active, multi-round, interaction with the games is unique
per user. Moreover, by using games that contain moving
objects or objects that are placed at random locations when
combined with passwords, the level of randomization may
serve as a defense against key loggers [19] or side-channel at-
tacks (i.e., attacks that try to deduce the entered password
on touch screen devices based on the locations the user has
pressed on the screen [15, 21]), replay attacks and spooﬁng
attacks [19, 29].
Second, engaging the user in the user authentication pro-
cess via interactivity may enhance the level of user experi-
ence. For example, interactive solutions may be more suit-
able for small touchscreen devices, where reading/entering
text might be challenging. Moreover, the interactivity makes
it possible to extract enough information to identify the user
within a short period of time.
To summarize, there are many unique advantages of Ga-
metrics over known biometrics systems (behavioral or other-
wise). First, the use of multiple multi-dimensional, explicit-
implicit, game play features when “fused” together could sig-
niﬁcantly reduce the false negative rates and thus improve
usability, when compared to existing behavioral biometrics.
Second, such fusion could signiﬁcantly reduce the false posi-
tive rates, thereby improving the security. Especially, spoof-
ing the user (either automatically or manually) may become
very hard given that the attacker would have to simultane-
ously mimic multiple subtle user interaction patterns (cor-
responding to the diﬀerent underlying features). Moreover,
the dynamic and interactive nature of the game makes it dif-
ﬁcult for an attacker to simply “replay” a previously learned
template or game session, unlike static passwords or key-
board dynamics mechanisms. Third, the interactive element
of the underlying games may further enhance the usability
and promote user acceptability.
While Gametrics can be built using diﬀerent forms of cog-
nitive games and puzzles, in this paper, as our authentica-
tion object, we use the Dynamic Cognitive Game (DCG)
notion recently introduced in [18] for the purpose of building
CAPTCHA (not user authentication) schemes. DCG games
involve objects ﬂoating around within the images, where the
user’s task is to match the objects with their respective tar-
get(s) and drag/drop them to the target location(s) (exam-
ples shown in Figure 1). We investigate the applicability of
using such simple constructs to extract a user’s unique bio-
metric information based on multi-modal user interactions.
We model and analyze the security of our multi-modal game
biometrics with respect to spooﬁng attacks, where the at-
tacker deliberately attempts to mimic the victim user’s game
play interaction patterns. We argue that attacking the pro-
posed biometrics with automated means would be hard as
the bot would require solving a CAPTCHA as well as mim-
icking the user interaction with the challenge. Moreover,
the randomization in the challenges would prevent attacks
that involve recording the user interaction with the challenge
and then replaying the recorded data later to authenticate
the attacker [18]. As authentication applications, Gamet-
rics is suitable for point-of-entry login. It could also be a
promising and a natural solution for the diﬃcult problem of
fall-back authentication (e.g., needed to retrieve a forgotten
password) [25, 27, 28].
Our Contributions: We believe that this paper makes the
following key contributions to the ﬁeld of user authentication
in general and behavioral authentication in particular:
1. Gametrics Design and Implementation: We design and
implement a Gametrics system based on simple DCGs
to capture the unique user interactions. Our system is
built using machine learning techniques and extracts
a total of 64 features from each game challenge solv-
ing instance that capture the multiple unique cognitive
abilities and the mouse dynamics of the users.
2. Evaluation of Gametrics under Benign Settings and
Zero-Eﬀort Attacks: We collect a comprehensive data
set from a total of 118 users (98 Amazon Mechanical
Turk (AMT) online workers and 20 University lab par-
ticipants), and show that Gametrics can identify the
legitimate users and the zero-eﬀort attackers (“diﬀer-
ent users”) with a high accuracy (average False Positive
Rate = 0.02, and False Negative Rate = 0.02) within
a short period of time (average around 15 seconds).
3. Evaluation of Gametrics under Active Attacks: We
show that Gametrics can thwart active attackers that
deliberately attempt to mimic a user’s interaction with
the challenges in an observation-based attack (attack
success rate as low as 0.03). Furthermore, we ar-
gue that attacking Gametrics using automated mech-
anisms, internal or external, is also a hard task.
Paper Outline: The rest of this paper is organized as fol-
lows. In Section 2, we lay out the design goals and threat
model for our Gametrics system. In Section 3, we describe
the authentication game object (DCGs) used in our system.
This is followed by Section 4, where we describe our data
collection methodology and procedures. Next, in Section 5,
we elaborate on our machine learning techniques and fea-
ture extraction methods to build the Gametrics authenti-
278
cation model, and provide the classiﬁcation results in be-
nign setting and against zero-eﬀort passive attackers.
In
Section 6, we evaluate Gametrics against active adversarial
attacks that deliberately attempt to mimic a user’s game
play pattern to defeat the authentication system.
In Sec-
tion 7, we discuss further aspects of our work and provide
future research directions. In Section 8, we provide a litera-
ture review on diﬀerent forms of prior behavioral biometric
systems. Finally, in Section 9, we conclude our work high-
lighting the main take away points.
2. DESGIN GOALS & THREAT MODEL
A core objective of Gametrics is to improve the usability
and the security of user authentication process (especially
that of behavioral biometrics authentication). As such, our
aim is to design and develop an interactive behavioral bio-
metrics system that possesses the following properties:
1. Usability: The user has to be identiﬁed within a short
time and with high accuracy.
2. Security against Zero-Eﬀort Attacks: Any bio-
metrics scheme should be able to distinguish between
diﬀerent users. That is, one user (potentially an at-
tacker) should not be able to log in as another user (a
victim).
3. Security against Shoulder-Surﬁng Attacks: An
external attacker who monitors the user while she is
authenticating herself to the system, should not be
able to mimic and impersonate the user at a later point
of time.
4. Security against Automated Attacks: We aim to
provide security against sophisticated attacks where
the attacker steals a user’s authentication template
(e.g., by hacking into the device or server that stores
this template) and tries to authenticate itself in an au-
tomated manner to the system.
5. Security against Internal Attacks: We aim to pro-
vide security against internal attacks, such as a mal-
ware residing on the authentication terminal itself that
records the user’s valid authentication token/template
and replays it later, or tries to learn the template by
recording one or multiple valid authentication sessions
and then creates an authentication token to authen-
ticate itself as the user. Other forms of behavioral
biometrics schemes have been shown to be vulnerable
to such attacks [19].
3. GAME COGNITIVE TASK
In this section, we elaborate on the design and the imple-
mentation of the interactive DCG constructs we utilized in
our study.
3.1 Cognitive Task Design
We embed the cognitive task in simple web-based games,
following the design presented in [18]. In this design, each of
the game challenges has three target objects and six moving
objects. The user’s task is to drag a subset of the moving ob-
jects (answer objects) to their corresponding target objects.
Solving a challenge require the user to: (1) understand the
content of the images, (2) ﬁnd the semantic relationship be-
tween the answer objects and the target objects, and (3)
drag the answer objects to their corresponding targets. We
impose a time limit of 60 second to complete each challenge.
We aim to identify the user based on her interaction with
the challenge. Basically, we aim to identify the user based on
her cognitive ability (i.e., the time it takes her to recognize
the objects and perform the required task) and mouse inter-
action (i.e., mouse movement characteristics such as mouse
movement speed and acceleration).
3.2 Cognitive Task Implementation
We implemented the challenges using Adobe Flash Ac-
tionScript3 and the web server using PHP. The challenge
image/frame size is 500 × 300 pixels, the size of each of the
moving object is 75 × 75 pixels and the size of the target
objects is 90 × 90 pixels. The challenge starts by placing the
objects in random locations on the image. Then, each ob-
ject picks a random direction in which it will move. A total
of 8 directions were used, namely, N, S, E, W, NE, NW, SE
and SW. If the chosen direction is one of E, W, S, or N, the
object will move (across X or Y axis) by 1 pixel per frame
in that direction. Otherwise, the object will move √2 =
1.414 pixels per frame along the hypotenuse, corresponding
to 1 pixel across both X and Y axes. This means that on an
average the object moves 1.207 [= (1 × 4 + 1.414× 4)/8]
pixels per frame. We set the number of frames per seconds
to 40 FPS. The object keeps moving in its current direction
until it collides with another object or with the challenge
border, whereupon it moves in a new random direction.
The challenge starts when the user presses a “Start” but-
ton on the screen center. The challenge ends when the user
drags all the answer objects and drops them onto their corre-
sponding targets, in which case a “Game Complete” message
is provided or timeout is reached, in which case a “Time Out”
message is provided.
After the user performs an object drag/drop, the chal-
lenge code sends to the server the identiﬁer of the ob-
ject and the drop location. The server checks the cor-
rectness of the drag/drop and gives feedback to the chal-
lenge code.
If the web server conﬁrms that the object
was dropped on its corresponding target, the object dis-
appears giving feedback to the user that he performed a
correct action. After the user drags and drops all the an-
swer objects to their corresponding targets, the challenge
code sends to the server the log of the gameplay. The
gameplay log contains the objects locations, the mouse lo-
cation and status (up/down) at each time interval to the
server. The server utilizes this log to authenticate the user.
The timestamps were generated from multiple events lis-
teners: MouseEvent.CLICK, MouseEvent.MOUSE UP, and
MouseEvent.MOUSE MOVE.
For the purpose of our study, we implemented six in-
stances of the explained challenges that can be categorized
into three categories (two instances of each category) de-
scribed below. A sample of each of the implemented cate-
gories is shown in Figure 1.
• Brands: The targets are popular worldwide brands
and the objects are commercial products (e.g., Nike
and Nike shoes).
• Animals: The targets are real animals and the mov-
ing objects are cartoon animals (e.g., lion and Lion
King).
