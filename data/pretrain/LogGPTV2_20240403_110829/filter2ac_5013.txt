**ATT&CK ID:** T1428  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Exploitation of Remote Services

Adversaries may exploit remote services on enterprise servers, workstations, or other network resources to gain unauthorized access to internal systems once they have breached the network perimeter. This exploitation can be facilitated by leveraging a mobile device's access to the internal enterprise network, either through local connectivity or via a Virtual Private Network (VPN).

Exploitation of a software vulnerability typically involves taking advantage of a programming error in an application, service, or within the operating system or kernel itself. By exploiting these vulnerabilities, adversaries can execute code under their control, often with the intent of gaining higher privileges or furthering their access within the network.

A common objective for post-compromise exploitation of remote services is to enable lateral movement, which allows adversaries to access and control additional systems within the network. This can significantly expand the scope of their activities and increase the potential impact of the breach.
