The observed TCP flows were found to be originating from sources scanning two specific services, which are associated with ports 139 and 445. Port 139 is used for the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol over NetBIOS, while port 445 is for direct SMB communication. However, this information alone was not sufficient to identify the attack vector, as it is common for NetBIOS scanners to probe both of these services. Passive logs provided additional insights: 1) Scans typically targeted 256 consecutive IP addresses that span a /24 network boundary, 2) The scans occurred in intervals of approximately 2.5 hours, and 3) A small-scale periodicity was superimposed on a larger, diurnal periodic behavior.

Figure 3 illustrates the inbound traffic patterns for a typical week on the campus-enterprise sink, measured in bits and packets per second. The analysis revealed that focusing on a single day's data allowed us to classify scanners based on their scan footprints. We defined "type-1" sources as those that scanned between 250-256 consecutive IP addresses spanning a /24 boundary. "Type-5" sources, on the other hand, were those that scanned five or more subnets simultaneously, including processes that selected destination IP addresses randomly and highly aggressive scanners. Figure 7 shows the time-volume graph of type-1 and type-5 scanners, highlighting that the number of sources during peak times (around 100) was significantly smaller than the total number of participants observed in a day (2,177). Most of the diurnal behavior could be attributed to type-5 sources.

Further investigation, aided by the development of NetBIOS and SMB responders, led to the identification of the scanning process as the LovGate worm, which creates the file NetServices.exe, among others.

This section showcases the capabilities of iSink and highlights the complementary roles of the Passive Monitor and the Active Sink, using results from our two iSink deployments. We begin by comparing the passive-monitoring results from the campus-enterprise sink and the service-provider sink, then demonstrate how the Active Sink can be used to investigate network phenomena, such as periodic probing and SMTP hot-spots, revealed by the Passive Monitor.

### 4.1 Campus Enterprise iSink Case Study
The campus iSink, located within one autonomous system and advertised via the local interior routing protocol, observes traffic from both local and remote sources. Local traffic includes:
- Network management traffic aimed at discovering network topology and address utilization (e.g., ping sweeps and SNMP queries).
- Traffic from misconfigured hosts, such as domain queries to unused IP addresses and incorrect WINS configurations.
- Malicious probes and worm traffic targeting hosts within the same classful network.

Figure 3 displays the traffic from remote sources over a typical week at the campus-enterprise iSink. Key observations include:
- TCP is the dominant protocol, as the campus border routers filter out scans to port 1434 (ms-sql-m), exploited by the SQL-Slammer worm.
- The peak traffic rate is about 1 Mb/s and 1,500 packets per second, with no clear periodicity.
- Due to the dominance of TCP, packet sizes are relatively constant, leading to a predictable ratio between bytes and packets, and thus similar trends in bit and packet rates.

### 4.2 Service Provider iSink Case Study
The unsolicited inbound traffic to the class A network varied from an average of 5,000 packets per second (pps) when the system was first brought online to over 20,000 pps six months later. Experienced network operators noted that even this relatively quiescent class A network cannot be effectively managed at the end of a 1.5 Mbps T1 link due to the saturation caused by unsolicited traffic.

Initially, we assumed that introducing the least-specific /16 route for the iSink would allow operators to occasionally introduce more-specific routes to redirect traffic elsewhere in the Internet. However, this approach did not work in practice due to the bifurcation of the Internet into commercial/commodity networks and research/education networks (Internet2â€™s Abilene). Some sites prefer less-specific routes over more-specific ones when the less-specific route is seen on a higher-performance or fixed-cost service like Internet2.

Figure 4 shows the traffic observed in a typical week at the service-provider iSink. Unlike the campus-enterprise network, UDP is the dominant protocol, primarily due to Windows NetBIOS scans on port 137 and ms-sql-m traffic from worms exploiting the MS-SQL monitor. The lack of a strong correlation between byte and packet graphs is due to the varying sizes of UDP payloads. The most notable feature is the striking periodic behavior of the TCP flows, discussed in more detail in Section 4. Table 2 summarizes the inbound flow rate per second for the top services.

### Analysis of Backscatter Packets
Backscatter packets, which are responses to spoofed DoS attacks, have been used to project Internet-wide attack behavior. Figure 5 provides a time series graph of the backscatter packet volume observed in our service-provider sink. Key features include:
- TCP packets with ACK/RST flags dominate, as expected in response to a SYN flood from forged sources.
