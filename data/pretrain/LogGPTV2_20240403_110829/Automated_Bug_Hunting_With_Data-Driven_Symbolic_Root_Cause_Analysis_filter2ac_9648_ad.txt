### 4.1 Bug Hunting in Real-World Programs

#### Methodology
For each of the 15 real-world programs in our dataset, we allowed Bunkerbuster to trace and analyze a corpus of benign inputs for one week. We also measured Bunkerbuster's code coverage over forwarded traces to test whether it converges, which is relevant to determining its usability in real-world deployments.

#### Results
Table 1 summarizes the results produced by Bunkerbuster’s analysis for the gathered data using our target programs and input corpus. In total, 39 bugs were found across the 15 tested programs.

- **ID Column**: 31 of the found bugs pertain to already publicly known vulnerabilities, whereas 8 have never been reported before. We manually inspected these cases to verify their presence.
- **New Vulnerabilities**: In one case, our prototype found a previously reported bug that the developers decided not to fix due to its performance consequences versus the relatively low security impact. One bug has been issued an EDB ID by Offensive Security and three CVE IDs by MITRE. Developers have patched them, using our system’s reports to independently review and verify their novelty and impact. Some of these bugs were highly exploitable, including a now-patched remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability, triggered via a WHOIS response.
- **Type Column**: Bunkerbuster found 25 overflows (Ovf), 1 FS bug, and 13 UAFs/DFs.
- **Program and Component Columns**: These columns report where the bugs reside, with "main" denoting the main executable object. 24 bugs were found within import libraries, and 15 were inside the main object. We also report the version number of the vulnerable component for completeness.
- **Notable Observations**: Autotrace is particularly buggy, with 17 vulnerabilities residing within the main object. Conversely, while GIMP is associated with 3 bugs, they were all found within import libraries.
