* New vulnerability discovered by Bunkerbuster.
4.1 Bug Hunting in Real-World Programs
Methodology. For each of the 15 real-world programs in our
dataset, we allow Bunkerbuster to trace and analyze our corpus of
benign inputs for 1 week. We also measure Bunkerbuster’s code
coverage over forwarded traces to test whether it converges, which
is relevant to determining its usability in real-world deployments.
Results. Table 1 shows the results produced by Bunkerbuster’s
analysis for the gathered data using our target programs and input
corpus. In total, 39 bugs were found across the 15 tested programs.
The “ID” column shows that 31 of the found bugs pertain to already
publicly known vulnerabilities, whereas 8 have never been reported
before. We manually inspect these cases to verify their presence.
In 1 case, our prototype found a previously reported bug that the
developers decided not to fix due to its performance consequences
versus the relatively low security impact. 1 bug has been issued an
EDB ID by Offensive Security and 3 CVE IDs by MITRE. Developers
have patched them, using our system’s reports to independently
review and verify their novelty and impact. Some of these bugs were
highly exploitable, including a now patched remote code execution
(RCE) vulnerability, triggered via a WHOIS response.
The “Type” column lists the type of each bug. In total, Bunker-
buster found 25 overflows (Ovf), 1 FS bug, and 13 UAFs/DFs. The
“Program” and “Component” columns report where the bugs reside,
with “main” denoting the main executable object. 24 bugs were
found within import libraries and 15 were inside the main object.
We also report the version number of the vulnerable component
for completeness. We observe that Autotrace is particularly buggy,
with 17 vulnerabilities residing within the main object. Conversely,
while GIMP is associated with 3 bugs, they were all found within
