In the 2.0.4 Reference Manual, on page 30, the `<tag>` is presented as follows:
```
<incorrect-tag>
```
Using this tag in its current form results in an error (refer to the forum discussion: [http://forum.springframework.org/showthread.php?t=34417](http://forum.springframework.org/showthread.php?t=34417)).

The correct `<tag>` should be:
```
<correct-tag>
```
