There are two copes of `Biobuf` in the compiler, `cmd/internal/obj/util.go`
and `cmd/internal/ld/util.go`. Both are in various stages of decomposition,
for example `05d5316` was applied to the latter, but not the former. The
former has sort of had `05d5316` applied accidentally, and now `Bungetc` is
inconsistent, some methods check the unget buffer, others do not.
  * If there must be a wrapper around `bufio.Buffer`, then there should be at most one in the compiler.
  * Preferably we should be using `bufio.Buffer` directly everywhere.
