User:  How to optimize website response speed and reduce access delay?
Assistant: 1. Use CDN: Putting website content on a CDN server and allowing users to download the required resources from the server closest to them is a way to reduce latency. 2. Compress files: Compress files such as text, images and videos, which can greatly reduce download time. 3. Use caching: Try to let users cache website content, so that when they visit the same page again, they do not need to download it again. 4. Use browser cache: set the cache time, and use the "expire" field in the HTTP header file. 5. File merging: reduce the number of browser requests, and combine multiple CSS and JavaScript files into one for separate download. 6. Optimize the picture: Make sure the picture has been optimized, you can reduce the file size, adjust the resolution and compression ratio, etc. 7. Reduce HTTP requests: minimize HTML page interaction, use external tables and styles as much as possible, and minimize the internal and external content of compressed responses. 8. Optimize code: reduce unnecessary code in HTML pages. 9. Adjust the server: Use an efficient server to minimize the overhead of CPU cycles and network bandwidth. 10. Use caching technology: Using caching technology can extract the most important data and save it on the server, which can reduce the delay time.
