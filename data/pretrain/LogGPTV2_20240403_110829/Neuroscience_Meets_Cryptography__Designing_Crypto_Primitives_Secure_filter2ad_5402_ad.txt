Fragments
One of the potential attacks on our system involves a
malicious party proﬁling the legitimate user’s knowledge
and using that information to reverse engineer the trained
sequence to be able to pass the authentication test. Al-
though the number of possible trained sequences is too
large to exhaustively test on any single individual each
sequence is constructed according to known constraints
and knowledge of subsequence fragments might enable
the attacker to either reconstruct the original sequence or
enough of it to pass an authentication test.
The training sequences are constrained to use all 6 re-
sponse keys equally often, so analysis of individual re-
sponse probabilities cannot provide information about
the trained sequence. Likewise all 30 possible response
key pairs (6∗ 5 = 30, since keys are not repeated) occur
equally often during training meaning that bigram fre-
quency also provides no information about the trained se-
quence. However, each 30-item sequence has 30 unique
trigrams (of 150 possible). If the speciﬁc training trigram
fragments could be identiﬁed, the underlying training se-
quence could be reconstructed.
An attack based on this information would be to have
a trained user perform a SISL test that contains all 150
trigrams equally often. If the user exhibited better perfor-
mance on the 30 trained trigrams than the 120 untrained,
the sequence could be reconstructed. This attack would
weaken the method’s relative resistance to external pres-
sure to reveal the authentication information.
However, while the sequence information can be de-
termined at the trigram level it is not known if partici-
pants reliably exhibit sequence knowledge in such short
fragments. In Experiment 3, we evaluated performance
on this type of trigram test to assess whether the sequence
information could be reconstructed.
Participants were again recruited through Mechanical
Turk and completed the same training sessions used in
Experiments 1 and 2. At test, participants performed a
sequence constructed to provide each of the 150 trigrams
exactly 10 times by constructing ten different 150-trial
units that each contain all possible trigrams in varying
order. Performance on each trigram was measured by
percent correct as a function of the current response and
two responses prior.
To evaluate whether these data could be used to recon-
struct the sequence, the percent correct on each trigram
was individually calculated and a rank order of all tri-
grams was created for each individual. If performance
on the trained trigrams was superior to others, the trained
trigram ranks should tend to be lower (e.g., performance
expression would lead the sequence trigrams to be the 30
best performed responses). However, average rank and
average percent correct on the trained trigrams was in-
distinguishable from untrained trigrams. Participants did
not exhibit their trained sequence knowledge on this type
of test, indicating that their sequence knowledge cannot
be attacked with a trigram-based method. More speciﬁ-
cally, for each user we compared the average percent cor-
rect measurements for the 30 trained-sequence trigrams
to those for the 120 remaining trigrams. The 34 par-
ticipants averaged 73.9% correct (SE 1.2%) for trigrams
from the trained sequence and 73.2% correct (SE 1.1%)
for the rest. The difference was not reliable.
While the trigram test did not lead to expression of se-
quence knowledge, it is likely that participants’ sequence
knowledge could be assessed for some longer fragments.
However, the number of fragments to assess grows ex-
ponentially with the length to be assessed and the abil-
ity to test all fragments is limited by the need to rely
on human performance to do the assessment. For exam-
ple, for length 4 fragments (quad-grams), there are 750
fragments to assess multiple times each to try to identify
which ones had been trained.
Future work.
In future work we will assess sequence
expression at various lengths to ﬁnd the minimal length
at which sequence knowledge can be expressed. This
minimal length likely reﬂects a basic operating charac-
teristic of the brain regions that support implicit sequen-
tial skill learning. If this length suggests the possibility
of attack, the sequence can be increased in complexity by
increasing the number of characters, using inter-response
timing (known to be important to learning [7]) or more
complex sequence structures than simple repeating se-
quences.
Recall that in our experiments we assumed that users
are honest during the training phase and the adversary
only gets to coerce users after they have been trained.
We leave it for future work to design a coersion-resistant
authentication protocol that remains secure when users
can be coerced during the training phase.
6 Related Work
There is a large body of related work in user authenti-
cation and biometrics for user access control. The work
can been broken down into biometrics (“who you are”),
tokens (“what you have”), and passwords (“what you
know”). There is signiﬁcant past work in each of the
three main areas. Our work may fall into a new cate-
gory of implicit learning (“what you know you know but
do not know”), or could be categorized as a subclass of
behavioral biometric measurement.
Classic biometrics identifying a user based on who
they physically are can be grouped into physiologi-
cal and behavior categories. Physiological characteris-
tics include ﬁngerprint, face recognition, DNA prints,
palm print, hand geometry, iris recognition, and retinal
scans. Behavioral characteristics include measurements
of typing rhythm and other dynamics, dynamic signa-
ture, walking gait, voiceprints, and eye movement pat-
terns [11, 10, 2, 15]. Our work differs from these in en-
abling quick training in new randomly seeded patterns.
It might be very difﬁcult to learn to walk a new way,
and nearly impossible to change one’s iris pattern, but it
should be easy to learn a new cortical crypto sequence
with a modest training regime. Further, if one relies on
retinal patterns for identiﬁcation, each system could cap-
ture all the information content of the retina, and thus a
single compromised retina reader could reveal to an ad-
versary the entire set of information. Our approach en-
ables key revocation and multiple keys per user for dif-
ferent systems where there need not be any information
leakage from one system to the next.
Denning et al. [4] propose an authentication model
based on implicit learning of sets of images. An ear-
lier study [21] compared the learning of images, artiﬁ-
cial words, and outputs from ﬁnite-state automata. Both
of these works develop authentication systems that al-
low users to easily memorize strong passwords, how-
ever the resulting systems are not as resistant to rubber
hose attacks because they depend on the user consciously
studying sets of images or strings and as a result the
user retains some conscious knowledge of the creden-
tial. When using the SISL task we were able to verify
that little conscious knowledge of the trained secret is
retained.
Image-based authentication mechanisms also
require curated image sets in order to reduce errors in the
authentication process; in contrast SISL-based authenti-
cation uses automatically generated sequences sampled
from a well-deﬁned high entropy combinatorial space.

Deniable encryption. In the context of encryption, de-
niable encryption [3, 13] enables a user who encrypts a
message to open the ciphertext in multiple ways to pro-
duce different cleartexts from the same ciphertext. Such
systems enable a user to reveal an encryption key, which
produces a document that contains plausible cleartext,
but which is different from the actual document the user
wishes to protect. This technique protects encrypted doc-
uments, but does not apply to authentication credentials.
Further, a properly motivated user of deniable encryp-
tion could choose to reveal the correct decryption key,
enabling the coercive adversary ofﬂine access to all ver-
sions of the document. Our approach develops a sys-
tem where the user cannot, even if strongly motivated,
reveal to another any information useful for an adver-
sary to replicate the user’s access without the user being
present. Deniability has also been studied in the context
of elections [9].
Coercion detection. Since our aim is to prevent users
from effectively transmitting the ability to authenticate
to others, there remains an attack where an adversary
coerces a user to authenticate while they are under ad-
versary control.
It is possible to reduce the effective-
ness of this technique if the system could detect if the
user is under duress. Some behaviors such as timed re-
sponses to stimuli may detectably change when the user
is under duress. Alternately, we might imagine other
modes of detection of duress, including video monitor-
ing, voice stress detection, and skin conductance moni-
toring [8, 16, 1]. The idea here would be to detect by
out-of-band techniques the effects of coercion. Together
with in-band detection of altered performance, we may
be able to reliably detect coerced users.
7 Conclusions and Future Work
We have presented a new approach to protecting against
coercion attacks using the concept of implicit learning
from cognitive psychology. We described a proof of
concept protocol and preliminary experiments conducted
through Mechanical Turk demonstrating a basis for con-
ﬁdence that it is possible to construct rubber hose resis-
tant authentication.
Much work remains. We hope to further analyze the
rate at which implicitly learned passwords are forgotten,
and the required frequency of refresher sessions. In ad-
dition we would like to ﬁnd methods to detect or predict
when individual users reliably learn (collecting more de-
mographic data about our users might be a good ﬁrst step
in this direction, along with multi-session long-term ex-
periments). We also hope to explore some of the limits of
the approach, for example by ﬁnding out the minimum
lengths at which parts of learned sequences are distin-
guishable to an attacker versus a legitimate authenticator,
as well as by strengthening the test procedures and analy-
sis to increase reliability across a larger fraction of users,
or reduce the required testing time, false positives, and
false negatives. Using variable timing between cues and
measuring user performance as a function of game speed
can further help in making the test protocol more reli-
able. Implicit learning of multiple credentials is yet an-
other area that can beneﬁt from additional experiments,
building upon prior work that has so far found no evi-
dence of interference when users learn distinct 12-item
sequences, while also being capable of learning implic-
itly sequences as long as 80 items.
Another future direction for this work is in testing
whether more complex structures—for example Markov
models—can be learned implicitly. We would like to use
such learning to build challenge-response authentication
which is resistant to eavesdropping in addition to coer-
cion. Finally, beyond authentication, we would like to
investigate the construction of a variety of cryptographic
primitives based on implicit learning.
