      message: "TypeError: Cannot read property 'startLineNumber' of null"
    }
    ```

- **Additional Error Messages:**
  - `workbench.main.js:90` and `workbench.main.js:63` both report the same `TypeError: Cannot read property 'startLineNumber' of null`.

**Summary:**
The error indicates that the `startLineNumber` property is `null` when the code formatting process is initiated. This issue is likely related to the HTML language support in Visual Studio Code.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Open Visual Studio Code version 0.10.4.
2. Open an HTML file.
3. Right-click in the editor and select "Format Code" from the context menu.
4. Observe the error in the console.

**Expected Behavior:**
The code should be formatted without any errors.

**Actual Behavior:**
An error is thrown, and the code is not formatted.

**Environment:**
- Visual Studio Code Version: 0.10.4
- Operating System: [Specify your OS]
