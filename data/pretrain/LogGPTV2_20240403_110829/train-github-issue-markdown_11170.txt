As pointed out in this stackoverflow question, `.offset` and `.repeat` are
properties of a texture, not a material.
Suppose, for example, a user wants to share a spritesheet across multiple
materials. Currently that is not possible, since `offset` is a property of the
texture, and can only be set once.
Also, making `offset` a property of a material would avoid the "uv repeat and
offset setting priorities" in `WebGLRenderer`.
        // uv repeat and offset setting priorities
        //  1. color map
        //  2. specular map
        //  3. normal map
        //  4. bump map
This code logic forces all the texture offsets/repeats to be the same, anyway.
Should `.offset` and `.repeat` be properties of a material instead?
