Sorry, low quality bug report here but I'm working to a deadline.
Browser: Chrome latest  
Visit this page: http://getbootstrap.com/components/  
Its currently using Bootstrap 3.2.0
On my desktop 1920*1080, on a windows 8 pc, maximised window.
If I scroll down to the end of the page using either of these two methods:  
1/ press END, then scroll up one mouse wheel and back down again OR  
2/ manually drag the scrollbar to the end of the page
you will notice that the affix plugin "pops" and goes off the top of the page.
I assume this may be intended behaviour as its being left behind as you go
beyond its affix zone.
If you press HOME after that it jumps back to the top of the page but the
affix is now in the wrong place and appears to be affixed to the top of window
instead of its original affix top location. Scrolling at all fixes the issue
and it pops back to its affix start location.
Obscure, yes. Browser issue, probably. Close the issue if you like, I'll only
be mildly offended :)
I think that its actually breaking both ways, if you END down it goes further
than it should. Then if you get it into my scroll bug location and HOME it
does the same bug in reverse?
