User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题RDP - Same login sufficient? I just authorized remote access to my Windows 7 machine (not using NLA, since I run a mainly Linux network). I diabled Remote Assistance.

My user (JoeBlow) is protected with password 123456 and autologon is not enabled.

When I connect from a Linux (Ubuntu) box, with a local user named JoeBlow, using password 0987654 (or anything else, it doesn't matter) through KRDC, it logs me directly in JoeBlow's windows session, without prompting for a password.

Did I miss something on the Windows setup side, or is RDP built in such a way as to allow anyone impersonating a user on a network to hijack the session?

Assistant: It's not normal behavior for it to just log you in by username.

My best guess is that you have the password saved either in the RDP program or your gnome keyring or something like that.

An easy way to test would be to change the password on the windows machine and see if it starts prompting you for a password again.
