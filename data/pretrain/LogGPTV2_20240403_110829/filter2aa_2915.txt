Malware and Hacking
• The problem of malware and computer based theft 
is increasing and becoming more complex
– The number of unique keyloggers and malware identified 
by the apwg have increased during 2008
– CSI/FBI reports that businesses lost over $21 million due 
to fraud, as well as over $10 million due to various 
malicious software infections
– The Department of Justice argues that it is now more 
profitable to engage in computer crime than drug 
trafficking 
Criminological Research
• Social science research has explored the malware 
and hacking community to some degree
– Hackers and malware writers operate within a technology 
focused subculture that values skill and ability
– They have relatively loose connections, and sometimes 
work in teams to create programs or hack systems
• Few systematic examinations of the malware and 
hacker community have examined social ties and 
interests
– Generally no predictive research has been conducted
On-line Resources
• The malware and hacking community utilize on-line 
resources that can be actively mined for information
• This study will examine the social networks of the 
malware and hacking community in Russia and 
Eastern Europe using data generated from social 
networking blogs
– Blogs provide important information on:
• Current and emerging threats
• The relationships and behavior of attackers
• Locations, attitudes, beliefs
Self-Report Information
• Each LJ profile allows users to provide information on their:
– Location 
– Education 
– Biographies sometimes provide useful information on psychological 
status of the user or whether the journal is friends-only 
– Interests can include political affiliation, geographical location as well 
as nonsense 
– Friends
• people whom the users reads and who can have access to ‘friends-only’ 
entries
– Also friend of
• people who read this journal and do not have access to protected entries
– Mutual friends 
• both users added each other 
– Communities
• LJ groups that the individual belongs to
Data and Methods
• This study uses a sample of the members of 
multiple hacker groups that have connected forums 
known to sell and trade malicious software and 
stolen data
– The content of each blog was downloaded and translated 
by a native speaker
– Google searching was conducted for each individual to 
determine their involvement in the hacker community
– Network analyses were conducted to indicate the 
centrality of users with high perceived threat level

Extrapolating Data: Location
• Location
– From current educational listing
– From ICQ profile or other online contact information
– From communities – if the user belongs to the 
communities devoted to finding jobs in particular location 
– From Interests – the user can indicate heightened 
interests to the particular location
– Each of these categories is further corroborated by 
reading the journal entries
Extrapolating Data: Age
• Age 
– Education
• Assuming the standard Russian educational trajectory, 
we can assign the age with some margin of error
– ICQ profiles
– Journal entries 
• users are congratulated on their birthdays, especially 
for ages 18-20
Extrapolating Data: Threat
• Threat scores were created and assigned 
based on:
• Results from google searches on the handle 
provided
– 0: no threat
– 1: computer security blogger
– 2: low level hacker
– 3: high level hacker
General Details
• 70% of users with very low perceived risk
• 13% of users did not provide physical 
locations in profiles
• 6% of users provided locations that do not 
exist
• 15% friends-only profiles
• 7 females
• 3 virtual identities 
Example of age identification
• Zdeusz:
– graduated from high-school in 2002;
– studied at the university in 2003-2008;
– he has spent one year somewhere (working 
or preparing to study in the university). 
– assuming that he has graduated from school 
as majority of Russians at 16, studied 5 years 
at the university, then this puts him at 22 
years or 1986.

Gender and Virtual Identities 
• Examples of females – represent a very small subset of 
hacker’s community, but with the very high degree of 
diversity. For example, 
– bubnilkin – describes her everyday life 
– kiote-the-one – the journal is called ‘serial maniacs’ and subscribed to 
communities devoted to studying serial maniacs, the content is about 
computer programming (but writes from a female ‘podumalA’) 
– 13-ya – has a twin sister and uses her diary for communication with 
friends
• Examples of virtual identities
– Mrbuggers – gender is listed as female in ICQ profiles, shown 
everywhere else as male, does not provide identification information 
in his LJ profile. One of co-founders of BH crew.
– perajok - the journal is from We not I (somebody and Irena 
Ponaroshku which translates as Irena Pretending, mostly devoted to 
music)
Gender and Virtual Identities
Only one high threat female was identified, eas7.  She was well connected to many 
males in the network
WowShell -Remote Shell access program
Netme ^_^- Portmap daemon or service application.
GOSS ^_^- GUI Oracle Security Scanner.
sTask ^_^- Console Service Task Manager/rootkit
Https ^_^- HTTPS - Console http/https downloader.
COSS ^_^- COSS - Console Oracle Security Scanner.
Rootkity ^_^ - Rootkits hidden ports checker.
GUI6011 ^_^- GUI Interface v.1.1.77 for Project6011.
GUI6011 ^_^- network scanner
Examples of identities which 
appear to be real people
• There is a small percentage of people who do 
not hide their real identities, but us Livejournal 
and Internet for professional or communal 
connections:
– puzanov (Puzanov) is a radio host who gives  ads for 
his new radio programs
• Puzanov can be his last name or nickname
– stden (Denis Stepulyonok) discusses educational 
programs at the institution where he works
• He teaches computer security 
BH Crew example
• BHCREW is the separate profile (from BH community) 
for founders (or the founder) or BH crew. BH stands for 
Bugger-Hukker Crew. 
• One of the latest visible entries in the BH crew 
community indicates that the community is seeking 
information on a computer security specialist
– This might be an example of hackers attack or control marker
• Use their own language and have their own manifesto: 
– “The plans of BHC are simple and trivial like hangover: produce 
REVOLUTION. Buggers will be the president, Hukkers will be 
the prime-minister, well and there, hwat else is there, everybody 
gets free coca-cola, golden roller-blades, freebie Internet too, 
and that's all!”
Examples of other uses of journals
• diaries 
– bubnilkin
• accessory to work 
– bukva_b asks different surveys-questionnaires
• collection of materials found in the Internet 
– cyberozzman
• Communication means 
– BH crew/ other hacker communities
• medium for distributing important information 
– BH_crew – posting news about group activities
• mass media type journals with large number of very 
popular for reading entries
Depression and Affect
• Heightened levels of depression and 
aggression are noted in user blogs, as well as 
deviant behavior in general 
– lisnake posted in an online photo-resource under   
the title: “The Perfect Day for Suicide”
– Crash’s blog titled “My Aimless Life”
– 4kella indicates that he wants to commit suicide, 
and receives the comment: “The suicide is for 
weak – you have to leave”

Initial Predictive Analysis
• An Anova analysis was conducted based on 
frequency of interests in various categories
– Malware
– Operating Systems
– Drugs & Alcohol
– Assembly Language
• Anova Class based on individuals verified as having 
created, attempted, or sold malware
0 = no history of hacks/malware
1 = security writer or blogger
2 = script kiddie, hacker or malware creator

• Individuals with higher threat levels express more specific 
and detailed interests in software techniques and methods, 
rather than general topics of interests.
•Threat Level = 0  might list “hacks” as a general interest
•Threat Level = 2 or 3 may list all of the following
“botnets, buffer overflows, ios kernel hack, phreaking, 
rootkits, immunity debugger”

Discussion and Conclusions
• A significant amount of information can be 
generated from social networking data
• The Russian hacker community is relatively 
centrally located in Moscow and St. Petersburg
– Gender and education reflect general research on the 
community
• Groups are well connected, and particularly 
threatening hackers are densely connected
– A small percentage of the members appear to be overtly 
involved in hacking and malware
Discussion and Conclusions
• Groups are densely connected and redundant 
networks exist
– Indicates insulation which may be why so many tools and 
attacks are continuously recycled and pushed from skilled 
to unskilled
• Interests may be a critical predictor of hacker 
behavior
– Multinomial regression models can be developed to 
identify factors that help to determine threat level of 
hackers
– Test computer simulations of hacker-networks behavior
