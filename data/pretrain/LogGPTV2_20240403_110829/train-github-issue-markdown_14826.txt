# Environment
    I am running Windows 10 version 1903 (18362.356)
    I have PowerToys 0.11.0 installed from the Releases tab of GitHub
    Bug concerns FancyZones
# Steps to reproduce
  * I have several virtual desktops set up
  * I have set up 3 zones on my display using FancyZones.
  * I opted to use the Win+left and Win+right keys to use my FancyZones instead of the default Windows 10 behavior.
  * I changed between virtual desktops and ended up having my focus on the Windows Task Bar. But the behavior can be triggered by clicking on an empty area of the Windows Task Bar as well.
  * I hit Win+left (believing I have focused on a Window)
# Expected behavior
Nothing should have happened, because I really do not expect to resize / move
the task bar.
# Actual behavior
The task bar behaved like a regular window and got stuck into my FancyZones. I
could even move it between the FancyZones just like any other window. Not what
I want :)
