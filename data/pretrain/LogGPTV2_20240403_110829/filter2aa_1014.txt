**Presented by: Mike Renlund, Digital Cinema Specialist**

#### Film: How It's Always Been Done
- **35mm Film**: The standard format, with over a mile of film per movie.
- **IMAX Film**: 10 times larger than 35mm.
- **Image Quality**: Minimal upgrades in over a century; the most significant change was from black and white to color.

#### Film Sound and Image
- **DTS Timecode**
- **Analog**
- **Dolby SRD**
- **Sony SDDS**

#### Distribution and Security of Film Prints
- **Weight**: 70 lbs (32 kg) cans containing the film.
- **Security Measures**:
  - Codenames for content
  - Separate shipments
  - Physical locks on the cans

#### DLP Technology
- **Invention**: First designed in 1987 by Dr. Larry Hornbeck at Texas Instruments.
- **Market Impact**: Gained prominence in the movie market with the first major digital cinema release in 2005.

#### The DLP Chip
- **Size**: Extremely small mirrors.
- **Image Creation (Greyscale)**: 
  - **DMD Chip**
  - **Lens**
  - **Screen**

#### Creating an Image
- **Color Separation**:
  - **Red DMD**
  - **Green DMD**
  - **Blue DMD**
  - **Lens**
  - **Light Pipe**
  - **Prism**

#### Different DLP Projectors
- **Sony SXRD**: Silicon X-tal Reflective Display

#### Digital Cinema Distribution
- **Methods**:
  - Hard Drive
  - Network Transfer
  - Satellite
- **Content Security**:
  - Content is served from storage to the Media Block.
  - Content is encrypted.

#### Security in Digital Cinema
1. **Content Delivery**:
   - From storage to the Media Block.
   - Encrypted content.
2. **Media Block (Decoder)**:
   - Decodes video/audio with the KDM.
   - Audio is passed to the audio processor.
   - Video is re-encrypted with Cinelink II and sent to the projector.
3. **Cryptography Section**:
   - SHA-256 key.
   - Secure connection to the Media Block.
   - No open access panels.
   - Correct date range, content, and no tampering detected.
4. **KDM (Key Delivery Message)**:
   - Contains detailed security information.
   - Any failure in the KDM prevents the movie from playing.

#### 3D Technology
- **Experience**: Have you seen a film in 3D before? What did you think?
- **Anaglyph Technology**: Two problems with 3D films.
- **Digital Cinema Solutions**:
  - **Circular Polarization**:
    - Real D: First major 3D format, disposable glasses.
  - **Wavelength Multiplex**:
    - Dolby 3D: Newer, uses Wavelength Multiplex Technology, reusable glasses.

#### Comparison
- **Real D vs. Dolby 3D**:
  - Personal opinion on which is better.

#### Upcoming 3D Films
- **Tim Burton’s ALICE IN WONDERLAND**
- **SHREK GOES FOURTH**
- **James Cameron’s AVATAR**
- **Michael Bay’s TRANSFORMERS 2**
- **STAR WARS**

#### 3D Presentation Quality
- **Research**: Find the best 3D presentations.
- **Challenges**: Many theaters are unaware of their 3D system, but research can enhance your viewing experience.

#### Alternative Content
