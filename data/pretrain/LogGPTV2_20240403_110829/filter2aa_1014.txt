The Big Picture: 
Digital Cinema Technology and Security

Film: How its always been done
• 35mm film is the standard, more than a mile 
of it for one movie.
• IMAX film is 10 times larger than 35mm.
• The image hasn’t been upgraded much in the 
more than a century that movies have been 
playing.
• The only real upgrade was from Black and 
White, to Color.

Distribution/Security of Film Prints
• 70 lbs (32 kg) cans 
with the film inside.
• Security measures 
include:
• Codenames for 
content
• Separate shipments
• Physical locks on the 
cans
DLP technology
• First designed in 1987 By Dr. Larry Hornbeck 
at Texas Instruments.
• It took a long time to make a splash in the 
Movie market.  
• The first major release in digital cinema was in 
2005.

• Interesting facts about content
Security in Digital Cinema
Step 1:
1. Content is served out from a storage 
point, to the Media Block
2. The content is encrypted. 
Content Storage
Raid Array
Media Block(Decoder)
Internal to the same box, or two separate devices
• The Show Player decodes the video/audio with the KDM, the audio is 
passed to the audio processor.
• The video is re‐encrypted with Cinelink II, and sent to the projector.
Media Block(Decoder)
Up to 16 
channels of 
uncompressed

Media Block(Decoder)
• Sha1 256 key
• Secure connection to 
the Media Block
• No open access panels
• Sha1 256 key
• Correct Date Range
• Correct content
• No tampering 
detected
Any of these fail, and you cannot play the movie

Security Wrap up
• How tough is Digital Cinema Security Overall?
• Are there any weaknesses?
3D Technology
• Have you seen a film in 3D before?
• What did you think?
Anaglyph Technology
Two problems with 3D films
How digital cinema fixes the problem
Digital Cinema 3D technologies
• There are a couple of major companies that 
produce 3D equipment.
• They use different methods to make the 3D 
effect. The main methods are:
• 1. Circular Polarization
• 2. Wavelength Multiplex
Method 1: Basic Circular Polarization

Method 1: Circular Polarization
Circular Polarization continued…
• Real D was the first major 3D format in digital 
cinema.
• These glasses are disposable, due to the low cost in 
making plastic circular polarized lenses.
Method 2: Wavelength Multiplex 
• Dolby 3D is new on the block
• Uses Wavelength Multiplex 
Technology. Licensed from 
INFITEC.
• These glasses are reusable.

Which is better?
• This is my opinion on it:
Real D
Dolby 3D
So, what’s coming in 3D
• Tim Burton’s ALICE IN WONDERLAND
• SHREK GOES FOURTH
• James Cameron’s AVATAR
• Michael Bay’s TRANSFORMERS 2
• And of course, STAR WARS
3D Wrap‐up
• Where are the best 3D presentations found?
• Do your research. This can be a bit difficult, as 
many theatres don’t have a clue which 3D 
system they use, but can save you a 
headache, and enhance your viewing 
experience.
Alternative Content
• Metropolitan Opera…yup, you know you love 
opera.
• Sports Events‐Dallas Mavericks games have been 
aired at local movie theatres in 3D.
• Concerts: U23D and others
• Oh, and if you are in any way interested,  Some 
places let you:
Play HALO 3 on the big screen!
