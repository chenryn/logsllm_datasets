User: I would like to drag and drop my data file onto a Python script and have it process the file and generate output. The Python script accepts the name of the data file as a command-line parameter, but Windows Explorer doesn't allow the script to be a drop target.
Is there some kind of configuration that needs to be done somewhere for this work?
Assistant: Create a shortcut of the file. In case you don't have python open .py files by default, go into the properties of the shortcut and edit the target of the shortcut to include the python version you're using. For example:
Target:    C:\Python26\python.exe < shortcut target path>
I'm posting this because I didn't want to edit the Registry and the .bat workaround didn't work for me.
