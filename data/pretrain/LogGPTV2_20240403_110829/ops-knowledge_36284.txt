User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题php-cgi got SIGKILL on burst.net VPS? I got an VPS at burst.net, very cheap one, but this doesn't matter.

The strange behavior of it is, the php-cgi process, which started using lighthttpd's spawn-cgi, dies every a few minutes. however, other processes are fine and great, even include a java process, and I'm sure there is no "out of memory" issue, so it's not killed by OOM killer.

I used strace to trace the process, and found out it was killed by SIGKILL, hence no single log was left on the disk, just dies suddenly.

Is there anyway I can find out what process/thing sent the SIGKILL to the poor php process?

Filed a ticket with the vendor, but they said they won't care.

strace -p 7176
Process 7176 attached - interrupt to quit
wait4(-1, &lt;unfinished ...&gt;
+++ killed by SIGKILL +++

Assistant: Finally I recompiled the php using php-fpm, that seems to be much better and steady.
anyway, openvz is not as good. but you pay that little, what to expect?
