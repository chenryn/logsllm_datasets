User: if i want to script a mini-application (in the Terminal) in mac and windows, which one is preferred: ruby or python?
or is there no major difference just a matter of taste?
cause i know python definetely is a good scripting language.
thanks
Assistant: I would suggest to go for Python over Ruby on Windows unless you are willing to port some gems as a few (no I cannot say what percentage) of the gems use unix/mac specific stuff (example from ENV[OSTYPE] to wget to unix processes) that I have seen break on windows.
