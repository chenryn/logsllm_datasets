Code example:
Save this in `main.rs` and try to compile.
    enum T {}
    type New = T;
    impl New {}
    fn main() {}
Trying to compile, it shows this error:
impl.rs:4:1: 4:12 error: cannot associate methods with a type outside the
crate the type is defined in; define and implement a trait or new type instead  
impl.rs:4 impl New {}  
^~~~~~~~~~~  
error: aborting due to previous error
