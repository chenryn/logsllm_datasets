Certainly! Here's a more polished and professional version of the text:

**Code Example:**

Save the following code in `main.rs` and attempt to compile it.

```rust
enum T {}

type New = T;

impl New {}

fn main() {}
```

**Compilation Error:**

When you try to compile the code, you will encounter the following error:

```
error[E0117]: only traits defined in the current crate can be implemented for arbitrary types
 --> impl.rs:4:1
  |
4 | impl New {}
  | ^^^^^^^^^^ impl doesn't use types inside crate
  |
  = note: define and implement a trait or new type instead
```

**Explanation:**

The error occurs because you are trying to implement methods for a type alias (`New`) that is not defined within the current crate. In Rust, you can only implement methods for types defined within the same crate unless you are implementing a trait.

**Solution:**

To resolve this issue, you should either:
- Define and implement a trait.
- Create a new type (e.g., using a struct or enum) and implement methods for that type.

**Rust Version:**

This example was tested with the latest version of Rust from the git master branch, commit `6fcf43e`.
