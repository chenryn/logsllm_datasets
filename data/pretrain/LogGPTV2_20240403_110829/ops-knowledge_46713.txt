Question: "Given a 32-bit system with ASLR implemented, an attacker is attempting to exploit a memory-safety vulnerability. They can either guess or leak the address required to bypass ASLR. Which of the following statements are correct concerning the attacker's strategies and the system's defenses?"
 "A": "An attacker can guess the correct address with a 1 in 65536 probability, as 32-bit systems often have around 16 bits of entropy for address randomization."
 "B": "ASLR randomizes both absolute and relative addresses of variables, which prevents attackers from deducing other memory addresses even if one is leaked."
 "C": "In a scenario where each attempt to guess an address takes exponentially longer after a crash, making 65536 attempts becomes infeasible."
 "D": "By leaking the absolute address of the sfp on the stack, the attacker could deduce the address of the rip, as the relative address between them is not randomized by ASLR."
Answer: ACD
