ABSTRACT
Demand response systems assume an electricity retail-market
with strategic electricity consuming agents. The goal in
these systems is to design load shaping mechanisms to achieve
eﬃciency of resources and customer satisfaction. Recent re-
search eﬀorts have studied the impact of integrity attacks in
simpliﬁed versions of the demand response problem, where
neither the load consuming agents nor the adversary are
strategic.
In this paper, we study the impact of integrity attacks con-
sidering strategic players (a social planner or a consumer)
and a strategic attacker. We identify two types of attackers:
(1) a malicious attacker who wants to damage the equip-
ment in the power grid by producing sudden overloads, and
(2) a selﬁsh attacker that wants to defraud the system by
compromising and then manipulating control (load shaping)
signals. We then explore the resiliency of two diﬀerent de-
mand response systems to these fraudsters and malicious
attackers. Our results provide guidelines for system oper-
ators deciding which type of demand-response system they
want to implement, how to secure them, and directions for
detecting these attacks.

INTRODUCTION
The smart grid refers to the modernization of current elec-
tric power networks to achieve better reliability, eﬃciency of
resources, and to provide consumers more information and
choices in the way they use electricity.
Research eﬀorts have been mainly focused on the techno-
logical side of the smart grid; however, particular attention
should be placed on individual consumer incentives, since in-
dividual agents (ﬁrms or people) within the smart grid are
one of the enabling factors that will make the grid smart [13].
One of the particular smart grid programs that will rely on
individual interactions between consumers and producers of
electricity is Demand Response (DR) [11], a program that
tries to address the retail electricity market ineﬃciencies.
Currently, the electricity price in the wholesale market
(the bulk power grid) is updated periodically to match gen-

eration with dynamic demand between bulk power gener-
ators and bulk power consumers. When the transmission
system is congested (which is the default state), Locational
Marginal Prices (LMPs) are computed at each load and
at each generation point to determine how much distribu-
tion utilities will pay the system operator (per Megawatt),
and how much will the system operator pay the generation
points. LMPs are traditionally computed every 5 to 10 min-
utes, but there is recent work (e.g., New York power system)
for computing LMPs in real-time. In contrast, retail mar-
kets (which consist of an electric utility interacting with fac-
tories, buildings, homes, etc.) adopt static pricing schemes
such as ﬁxed and time-of-use tariﬀs. Under these contracts,
consumers have limited incentives to adapt their electricity
consumption to market conditions.
The goal of a DR program is to control consumer loads
that are responsive to conditions in the electric power sys-
tem, in order to achieve better eﬃciency of the retail mar-
ket. Currently, the majority of DR programs are used by
large commercial consumers, and companies such as Ener-
NOC manage DR services for large corporations and sev-
eral government agencies in the U.S. Most active DR pro-
grams are designed for grid stability; however the focus of
DR programs in the future is expected to be on energy ef-
ﬁciency. One of the primary goals of the smart grid is to
make DR programs available to a much broader range of
consumers [10].
1.1 Previous Work on Integrity Attacks in the
Power Grid Markets
Integrity attacks (or false-data injection attacks) have been
recently proposed as a way to analyze the vulnerability of
cyber-physical systems in general, and electric networks in
particular [18].
The area that we are interested in, is how false data in-
jection attacks can aﬀect the markets used in the smart grid
and how false data injection can use the markets to drive
the power grid to unsafe states (e.g., malicious attackers).
Negrete-Pincetic et al. [21] were one of the ﬁrst to study
how false control signals can aﬀect the social welfare of the
electricity market. Related work by Xie et al. [30] studied
how false data injection attacks can be used to defraud bulk
electricity markets by modifying LMPs, and work by Liyan
et al.[19] studied how false meter data in the bulk of the
power grid can be used to cause the largest errors in LMP
estimation.
All this work of false data analysis focuses on the bulk
electricity market; however, the retail DR market has dif-
ferent models.
In addition, it is more likely that attacks
will happen in the retail market as there are many more
participants in retail with highly varying levels of trustwor-
thiness. Finally, attributing attacks will be more diﬃcult
given a large number of participants (and thus attackers
will have higher incentives for attacking retail markets than
bulk-electricity markets).
Work on the impact of integrity attacks on the retail DR
market were recently analyzed by Tan et al. [28], where they
showed that an attacker who can modify the pricing signal
sent to electricity consumers will aﬀect the system and could
cause severe oscillations of electricity load. They presented
a new DR model and then experimented with two diﬀerent
attack models, scaling attacks and delay attacks.
While their model is an important step towards under-
standing the resiliency of DR programs against attacks, it
has two limitations. First, Tan et al. [28] introduce a new
model which has not been validated by the smart grid com-
munity. The current consensus for modeling DR problems is
to incorporate market interactions of a multi-agent system
where each agent has a nonlinear valuation of electricity [25,
24, 14, 26, 7, 15, 12, 9, 17]. In this paper we use more repre-
sentative DR models and study their security. Furthermore,
in addition to dynamic pricing DR which is the focus of
study by Tan et al., we study direct-load control DR models
as well.
The second limitation is that the attacks considered by
Tan et al. are limited to be parametric models of the pric-
ing signal u(t); these are delay attacks u(t − τ ) and scaling
attacks αu(t). One contribution in this paper is to model a
more powerful attacker that is not constrained to only two
possible attack strategies, but that can select an arbitrary
attack signal ˆu(t). In addition, the previous model of the
attacker is not strategic; in this paper we model a strategic
attacker that will select an attack strategy in a principled
way, and in order to achieve a speciﬁc attack goal. For exam-
ple, 1) a malicious attacker will have a goal of damaging the
power grid by generating sudden overload spikes, whereas 2)
a selﬁsh attacker will try to defraud DR programs.
1.2 Contributions
In this paper we address the limitations of previous work
and propose new contributions.
• We introduce two attacker models against DR pro-
grams: (1) A fraudster who tries to steal electricity
without trying to damage the power grid, and (2) a
malicious attacker that tries to damage the power grid.
Our models assume non-parametric adversary models
and are therefore more powerful that adversaries con-
sidered in previous work.
• We provide a formal security analysis for the two types
of adversary models for two DR programs: dynamic
pricing and direct-load control, using models previ-
ously proposed by DR communities.
• We show that dynamic pricing is more resilient to fraud
and malicious attacks than direct load control mecha-
nisms.
• Previous work analyzing DR [7, 15, 12, 9, 17] consider
only equilibrium points (i.e., optimal steady states);
they do not consider the transient dynamics of the
agents adjusting to diﬀerent market conditions and
learning optimal outcomes.
In this paper we design
an evolutionary game-theory implementation of the
transient dynamics of the DR problem. This is nec-
essary for studying malicious attacks that need to cre-
ate sudden electricity peaks, and therefore require the
study of transient dynamics to their attacks (instead of
ﬁnding the steady-state equilibrium). Using this tran-
sient analysis we show how a sophisticated attacker
can manipulate the market to achieve better results
than naive attacks.
In an eﬀort to facilitate future
research, we are making the dynamic implementation
for these simulations available online as an open source
BSD project [6].
2. DEMAND RESPONSE MODELS
There are two main forms of DR programs: direct load
control and dynamic pricing.
2.1 Direct Load Control
Direct Load Control (DLC) [11] is a demand control sys-
tem in which the utility (or a DR broker) negotiates with
consumers the ability to directly control ﬂexible loads in
their homes, buildings or industries. The utility company or
companies like Trilliant [29] can use remote appliance con-
trollers to turn speciﬁc appliances on and oﬀ during peak de-
mand periods and critical events. These remote controllers
can manage water heaters, pool pumps, and air condition-
ers (among others) and can be programmed to respond to
time-of-use tiers, critical peak pricing events, and direct load
control events.
DLC has been a promising future direction for the smart
grid for a variety of reasons. By controlling loads which can
be modiﬁed without much impact on consumer satisfaction,
we can allay many costs by shifting loads from peak de-
mand and compensating for real-time load imbalances. For
example, Paciﬁc Gas & Electric deployed the SmartAC pro-
gram in Spring 2007 [1]. Another provider of DR services
has recruited over 1.25 million residential customers in DLC
programs, and has deployed over 5 million DLC devices in
the United States. In California, they have successfully cur-
tailed over 25 MW of power consumption since 2007 [5]. In
Hungary, for example, DLC accounts for 1600MW (25% of
peak consumption).
2.2 Dynamic Pricing
Dynamic pricing programs [11] use incentives (e.g., via
real-time pricing, rebates, etc.) to motivate consumers to
reduce electricity consumption during peak hours. In con-
trast to direct-load control, consumers will be responsible
for taking actions based on the incentive (control) signals;
giving consumers a choice between cost and convenience.
Therefore, while direct-load control is a centralized system,
in dynamic pricing, agents make decisions in a decentralized
way. By using dynamic pricing, utilities can create incen-
tives for consumers to distribute their load more evenly—
e.g., consume more energy when there is high wind or solar
energy in the grid, and reduce consumption during peak de-
mand times. This price-sensitive peak shaving will defer the
need for grid expansion and will reduce the investments on
generators that are only used for short peak demands.
2.3 Notation
We consider a population of N consumers of electricity.
We divide a period of 24 hours in a set of T time inter-
vals denoted τ = {τ1, . . . , τT}; formally, we deﬁne the set
τ as a partition of [0, 24), where ∪t∈{1,...,T}τt = τ and
∩t∈{1,...,T}τt = ∅. Furthermore, we denote with qt
i the
electricity consumption of the ith user in the tth time in-
terval. The daily electricity consumption of the ith user is
i ](cid:62) ∈ RT≥0. The
represented by the vector qi = [q1
population consumption at a given time t is deﬁned by the
N ](cid:62) ∈ RN≥0, and the joint elec-
vector qt = [qt
1, , qt
tricity consumption of the whole population is denoted by
1 , . . . , q(cid:62)
N ](cid:62). The aggregated consumption at a given
q = [q(cid:62)

time t is deﬁned as ||qt||1 = (cid:80)N

1-norm.
i (qt
A valuation function vt
i ) models the valuation that the
ith user gives to an electricity consumption of qt
i units in the
tth time interval. Finally, let p(·) : R → R be the price of
electricity charged to consumers.
2.4 Direct Load Control Model
DLC assumes a perfect competition market where a so-
cial planner wants to maximize the social welfare of a pop-
ulation. This problem can be represented by the following
optimization problem [16, 8, 17]:
N(cid:88)
N(cid:88)

q
subject to
where Ui(q) represents the proﬁt (valuation of electricity
consumption minus the electricity bill) of the ith customer
in function of the population demand proﬁle q. Note that
in this model users send their valuation for electricity to
a central planner, and the central planner then decides the
amount of electricity and price to charge to each agent. Here
we make some assumptions on the problem characteristics in
order to guarantee that the problem has a unique solution.
Assumption 1.
(a) Aggregated utility.
1. The valuation function vt

i (·) is diﬀerentiable, concave,
2. The price p(·) is diﬀerentiable, convex, and non-decreasing.
Assumption 2. The solution of the optimization problem
in Eq. (1) is inside the feasible region, that is

lem at the maximum, denoted by µ, are:
