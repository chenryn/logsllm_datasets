## Abstract
The recent revelation that some Bluetooth-enabled handsets are vulnerable to disclosing personal information has caused significant concern within the community. The document referenced in [1] outlines three primary methods for attacking Bluetooth devices. This report provides a brief overview of the SNARF exploit, which targets a recently discovered security vulnerability in Bluetooth devices, requiring no prior preparation or manipulation.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Bluetooth Security Issues
In late November 2003, Adam and Ben Laurie of A.L. Digital Ltd. published a document [1] highlighting serious security flaws in certain Bluetooth-enabled phones. These vulnerabilities allow attackers to connect to the device without permission (i.e., without pairing) and perform a so-called SNARF attack.

By early February 2004, news of these security issues had spread globally. Many news outlets reported that exploit tools were available online, but extensive searches did not uncover their exact locations.

As described in [1], the SNARF attack allows unauthorized access to restricted portions of the device. The term "snarf" is derived from hacker jargon, meaning to "grab a large document or file and use it without the authorâ€™s permission" [2]. This can include reading out the phone book, which contains numbers and names stored on the device, SIM card, or call logs. Additionally, it is possible to retrieve and send SMS messages, as well as initiate phone calls, including to premium service numbers.

While theoretically, all supported AT-commands could be executed, manufacturers claim that some commands are blocked through this unauthorized connection. However, there is no inherent reason to prevent commands if the firmware inadvertently discloses them.

### 1.2 CeBIT 2004
CeBIT is a major event for technology enthusiasts, making it an ideal setting for evaluating the security of Bluetooth devices. The fair, held annually at the Hannover Fairground in northern Germany, attracts a tech-savvy audience more likely to use Bluetooth actively.

Salzburg Research, in collaboration with the Salzburg University of Applied Sciences and Technologies, had a booth at CeBIT 2004 in Hall 11, located near public restrooms, a high-traffic area. This location was used to set up an environment for detecting and attacking Bluetooth-enabled devices.

## 2. The Bluesnarf Field Trial

### 2.1 Environment Setup
The trial used a COMPAQ Evo N600c laptop with two low-cost MSI Bluetooth USB dongles. The software setup included Linux-2.6.2, Qualcomm's Bluez Bluetooth stack (bluez-libs-2.5, bluez-utils-2.4, and bluez-sdp-1.5), and applications implemented in Perl and C. An enterprise-level SQL database (PostgreSQL-7.4.1) was used for data storage and analysis.

### 2.2 Collected Data Samples and Results
From March 18th to 21st, 2004, a total of 1,269 different devices were discovered within a range of approximately ten meters. Despite the limited range, the number of detected devices was substantial.

#### 2.2.1 Discovered Device Vendors
Figure 1 shows the distribution of device manufacturers, determined by the Bluetooth address. Table 1 lists the vendors, the first three bytes of their Bluetooth addresses, and their distribution percentages.

Nokia clearly leads the market, with 70% of the detected devices. The Nokia 6310i is particularly popular, possibly due to its compatibility with existing car kits in company vehicles.

| Vendor        | Address-Bytes  | Percentage |
|---------------|----------------|------------|
| Nokia         | 00:02:EE, 00:60:57, 00:E0:03 | 70%        |
| SonyEricsson  | 00:0A:D9       | 11.35%     |
| Siemens       | 00:01:E3       | 8.2%       |
| Unknown       | Miscellaneous  | 8.1%       |
| Other         | Miscellaneous  | 2.1%       |

#### 22.2 Discovered Models
Bluetooth names, often defaulting to model numbers, were used to identify device models. While not entirely reliable, they provide a general idea of the vendor/model distribution.

Tables 2, 3, and 4 list the uniquely identified models. Figure 2 and 3 support the observation that the Nokia 6310i and SonyEricsson T610 are particularly popular.

| Device                | Number | Percentage |
|-----------------------|--------|------------|
| Unrecognized          | 669    | 75.1%      |
| Nokia 6310/6310i      | 135    | 15.2%      |
| Nokia 6600            | 48     | 5.4%       |
| Nokia 3650            | 28     | 3.1%       |
| Nokia 7650            | 11     | 1.2%       |

| Device                    | Number | Percentage |
|---------------------------|--------|------------|
| Unrecognized              | 106    | 72.1%      |
| SonyEricsson T610         | 33     | 22.5%      |
| SonyEricsson P900         | 7      | 4.8%       |
| SonyEricsson P800         | 1      | 0.6%       |

| Device             | Number | Percentage |
|--------------------|--------|------------|
| Unrecognized       | 69     | 66.3%      |
| Siemens S55/SL55   | 34     | 32.7%      |

## Conclusion
The field trial at CeBIT 2004 provided valuable insights into the prevalence and vulnerabilities of Bluetooth-enabled devices. The high number of detected devices and the dominance of specific models highlight the need for robust security measures in Bluetooth technology.
