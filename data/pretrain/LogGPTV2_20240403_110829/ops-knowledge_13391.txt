Assistant: This log chunk contains errors related to the system's kernel, application, and CioStream socket. There were 20 DDR errors detected and corrected over 22070 seconds, 3 DDR errors detected and corrected over 8732 seconds, and 8 instruction cache parity errors corrected. Additionally, there were two errors related to the CioStream socket, one error related to the debugger dying, and one error related to a program image being too big. Finally, two core files were generated for two different programs.
