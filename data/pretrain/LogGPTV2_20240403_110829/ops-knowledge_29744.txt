User: According to the Bigtable original article, a column key of a Bigtable is named using "family:qualifier" syntax where column family names must be printable but qualifiers may be arbitrary strings. In the application I am working on, I would like to specify the qualifiers using Chinese words (or phrase). Is it possible to do this in Google App Engine? Is there a Bigtable API other than provided datastore API? It seems Google is tightly protecting its platform for good reasons.
Thanks in advance.

Assistant: The Datastore is the only interface to the underlying storage on App Engine. You should be able to use any valid UTF-8 string as a kind name, key name, or property name, however.
