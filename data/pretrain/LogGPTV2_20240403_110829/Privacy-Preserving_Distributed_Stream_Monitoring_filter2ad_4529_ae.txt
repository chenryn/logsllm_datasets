2) Varying Number of Violation Rounds: The bound b on
the number of violation rounds has two opposing effects on
the system lifetime. Increasing the bound allows the system to
sustain more local breaches (and the resulting synchronization
rounds) before the privacy budget is exhausted. However, at
the same time, the privacy budget assigned for monitoring each
sequence of silent rounds that ends with a violation round will
be smaller. This in turn will introduce more noise into the
monitoring process, increasing the likelihood (and therefore
the frequency) of violation rounds.
Figures 16 and 17 show the effect of different bounds on
the number of violation rounds when monitoring the number
of spam messages with thresholds T = 4800 and T = 5000
respectively. Similarly, Figure 18 shows that effect when
monitoring the information gain of the “febru” feature with
the threshold T = 0.002. The aforementioned opposing effects
of the number of violation rounds are evident in the decrease
in system lifetime when the number of violation rounds is too
low or too high. The system lifetime peaks in the “sweet spot”
where these opposing effects are balanced. Furthermore, when
the privacy constraints are weaker and ✏ is higher, it is possible
to sustain more violation rounds without a large increase in
false positives, resulting in longer system lifetime.

towards privacy-preserving monitoring of a global condition
over long periods of time. We provided theoretical analysis
of the proposed algorithm, and evaluated experimentally some
of the trade-offs between the privacy constraint, the system
lifetime, and the monitored threshold. Beyond these direct
trade-offs, we studied additional factors that affect the balance
between privacy and system performance: error margins that
augment the monitored threshold, and the bound on the number
of violation rounds.
For future research, we note that more sophisticated meth-
ods for violation recovery, such as local communication be-
tween nodes rather than global synchronization, could allow, in
some cases, further mitigation of privacy loss while monitoring
the system. Prediction models that tailor safe zones to nodes
[34], [35] also show promise in reducing the probability of lo-
cal safe zone breaches, allowing further increase in the system
lifetime. In addition, once the window of processed elements
advances beyond elements that contributed to violation rounds,
the privacy loss induced by those rounds can be discounted.
This gives rise to the option of replenishing the violation round
limit, allowing further extension of the system lifetime within
the given privacy constraint.
