    >>> import pandas as pd
    >>> from collections import OrderedDict
    >>> od = [OrderedDict([('z', 0), ('a', 1), ('*', 2)])]
    >>> pd.DataFrame(od)
       *  a  z
    0  2  1  0
    >>> pd.DataFrame.from_dict(od)
       *  a  z
    0  2  1  0
If OrderedDicts are used, I would expect the column order of the first
OrderDict that is encountered to be preserved, as the following:
    >>> pd.DataFrame(od, columns=od[0].keys())
       z  a  *
    0  0  1  2
    >>>
If different orders occur in the list, the earlier would overwrite the later.
If new columns are introduced with subsequent list entries, I would expect all
new columns to be appended to the original columns, with their relative order
preserved.
