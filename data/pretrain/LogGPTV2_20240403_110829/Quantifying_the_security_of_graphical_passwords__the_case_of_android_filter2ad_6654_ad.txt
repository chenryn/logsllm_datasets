in the Western hemisphere writing is from left to right and
top to bottom.
We see a strong bias towards choosing adjacent points
(i. e., points with Euclidean distance of 1), and to a lesser
extent to diagonally adjacent points (i. e., points with a Eu-
clidean distance of 1.4). The ﬁrst 3-gram that connects two
point that are not adjacent is the 14-th most frequent 3-
gram, and the ﬁrst 3-gram connecting two points that are
not even diagonally adjacent is the 40-th most frequent 3-
gram. This is probably caused by problems in usability,
as adjacent points are the easiest to draw a connection, and
points that are not even diagonally adjacent are very hard to
connect without accidentally touching intermediate points.
Furthermore, the resulting drawings become quite compli-
cated and probably harder to recall.
There is also a tendency to stay on the border, i. e., avoid-
ing the point in the middle. The ﬁrst 3-gram to touch the
middle point is the 12-th most frequent one. Also, there
is a tendency for straight lines and right angles (the ﬁrst
non-rectangular corner is formed by the 14-th most likely
3-gram). Again, this is similar to the ﬁndings for Pass-
Points [16], where straight lines often can be found.
5.2 Alternative Patterns
We explored four approaches that systematically change
the arrangement of the points in the grid without modifying
the basic method.
For the ﬁrst alternative, the Leftout Small Pattern (cf.
Figure 9), we omitted the upper left point, as it had by far
the strongest bias. Our hope was that this would spread the
initial point to a larger set of three or four points, thus po-
tentially increasing the entropy of chosen patterns. However,
reducing the number of points has the potential to reduce
both length and complexity of patterns, thus decreasing en-
tropy.
The second alternative, the Leftout Large Pattern (cf. Fig-
ure 10), is similar to the previous one, but we added two
points in the bottom row to increase the overall point count.
We added symmetry by leaving out the bottom right point
as well. Most mobile devices use a screen which is larger in
one direction, so ﬁtting a 3 × 4 grid of points should not be
problematic.
The third alternative, the Circle Pattern (cf. Figure 11),
targets another form of bias: For the plain Android Unlock
Pattern, there are a many straight lines (horizontal, vertical
and diagonal) that users prefer to follow, as we have seen in
the previous section. In addition, by removing corner points
(which were chosen as starting point in 78% of all patterns,
see Figure 7), we hoped to increase entropy. A potential
weak point of the Circle is that it might be tempting to just
“follow the circle” to create a pattern.
The fourth and last alternative, the Random Pattern (cf.
Figure 12), aims to break all symmetry and thus forcing the
user to choose strong patterns. The arrangement of points
looks fairly random, with the side condition that no three
points should be on a straight line, and no point should be
a clear upper-left corner point.
All these patterns were tested in a user study similar to
the one before, with 366 participants approximately evenly
spread over the four approaches, collecting 2,196 patterns in
total.
5.3 Study Setup and Data Collection
We conducted a user study identical to the one described
for Android Unlock Patterns in Section 3.2. This allows for
a fair comparison of the data we collected.
The user study was conducted over several weeks between

people participated, some statistics about their aﬃliation
with the university, gender, and age is given in Table 3. The
data from the plain Android user study is given to facilitate
comparison, it indicates that the population participating in
the study should be comparable.
Combining both studies, 479 people supported our work
by participating, at least 80 for each approach. The majority
of participants are male students of engineering. One expla-
nation is that they have a higher interest in mobile phone
security and were therefore easier attracted to participate in
our study.
5.4 Evaluation
We used the same methods as explained in Section 4 to
test the strength of the collected patterns. The results are
shown in Figure 15, and the resulting entropy estimates are
given in Table 4.
For the Leftout Small patterns, we can indeed observe
a more uniform distribution of the ﬁrst point. However,
overall the entropy is lower, most likely due to the smaller
number of points and, as a consequence, the lower number
of possible patterns.

Figure 15: Comparison of the guessing entropy estimates for
alternative constructions
For the Leftout Large patterns, somewhat surprisingly the
bias of the ﬁrst point is comparable to the original scheme.
We do not have a deﬁnite explanation, but we believe that
the rectangular form of the Leftout Small pattern leads the
user to more uniform choices, and the rectangular shape of
the Leftout Large patterns emphasizes the asymmetry of
the shape. This highlights the importance of user study
to understand the actual user choices. Due to the larger
number of points, the entropy estimate is larger, and from
Figure 15 we can see that the advantage over the original
Android scheme is mostly for larger number of guesses.
To our surprise, the Circle patterns performed best in
our experiments, even though the bias of the initial point
is similar to the original patterns. While we had expected
that more users would choose to draw a (partial) circle, we
saw that many people were aware that simply drawing a
circle is very insecure, and resorted to a number of other
patterns, like drawing a square or a triangle into the circle.
The guessing rate is smaller over the entire range of guesses,
and the entropy estimate is about 1.5 bits higher.
The Random patterns were surprisingly weak. As ex-
pected, the initial point is closer to a uniform distribution.
However, even though the points are spread randomly, many
users chose a pattern loosely resembling a δ, the reason
might be that human try to ﬁnd patterns even in random
data. It is noteworthy that Random patterns are particu-
larly weak for very small number of guesses, even weaker
than for the original patterns, and get only better for larger
numbers of guesses.
Memorability is a clear lack in the above user study: We
do not have any data on the long-term development for any
given pattern. However, our main focus was to learn about
frequently chosen passwords and the rationals behind it, so
this question was simply not in focus.
On statistical signiﬁcance.
The number of samples available for our study is substan-
tially limited by the time requirement for the user study,
which raises questions about statistical signiﬁcance of the
results. Unfortunately, guessing entropy does not allow di-
rectly computing conﬁdence intervals, therefor we resort to
techniques that were previously used by Bonneau [8].
We subsample samples of size 50 from the original dataset
of 114 samples, and empirically determined sizes for the con-
