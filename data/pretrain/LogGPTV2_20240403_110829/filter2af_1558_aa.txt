picoCTF的题目分布由易到难，很适合新手入门，做题过程中可以学到东西。对于新手，我觉得misc题更是能引起学习兴趣的。于是我做完了picoCTF2018的misc题目，现在把Writeup发到网络上来供萌新学习。所有题目文件和解析脚本可以从[这里](https://github.com/lxzmads/my-ctf-vestige/tree/master/picoctf2018/misc_KO)找到.
# General Warmup 1 (150pts)
# 题目
If I told you your grade was 0x41 in hexadecimal, what would it be in ASCII?
> Hints:  
>  (1) Submit your answer in our competition's flag format. For example, if
> you answer was 'hello', you would submit 'picoCTF{hello}' as the flag.
## 题解
题目意思很明确, 并且告诉你这就是ASCII, 于是Google ASCII, 对照ASCII码表就可以解出来了。还可以用Python来解
    print 'picoCTF{'+chr('0x41')+'}'
    # picoCTF{A}
# General Warmup 2 (50pts)
## 题目
Can you convert the number 27 (base 10) to binary (base 2)?
> Hints:  
>  (1) Submit your answer in our competition's flag format. For example, if
> you answer was '11111', you would submit 'picoCTF{11111}' as the flag.
## 题解
进制转换, 没什么多说的.
    print 'picoCTF{'+bin(27)[2:]+'}'
    # picoCTF{11011}
# General Warmup 3 (50pts)
## 题目
What is 0x3D (base 16) in decimal (base 10).
> Hints:  
>  (1) Submit your answer in our competition's flag format. For example, if
> you answer was '22', you would submit 'picoCTF{22}' as the flag.
## 题解
进制转换.
    print 'picoCTF{'+int('0x3D', 16)+'}'
    # picoCTF{61}
# Resources (50pts)
## 题目
We put together a bunch of resources to help you out on our website! If you go
over there, you might even find a flag! [link [1]]
( )
## 题解
就是观看一些介绍, 在网页中`Ctrl+F`搜索`picoCTF`, 得到flag. 也可用脚本
    import requests, re 
    r = requests.get('https://picoctf.com/resources')
    print re.findall(r'(picoCTF\{.*\})', r.text)[0]
    # picoCTF{xiexie_ni_lai_zheli}
# grep 1 (75pts)
## 题目
Can you find the flag in [file
[1]](https://2018shell2.picoctf.com/static/805ac70722810caa0b1c02bc88ef68d8/file)
? This would be really obnoxious to look through by hand, see if you can find
a faster way. You can also find the file in
/problems/grep-1_0_c0c0c16438cdbee39591397e16389f59 on the shell server.
> Hints:  
>  grep [tutorial](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/grep.php)
## 题解
从类似这些题就可以看出, Hints给的非常充分, 你只需要具备学习能力就能做题, 而不需要足够的知识储备与脑洞能力. 这和国内的题目差别是很明显的.
直接利用sh脚本
    cat file | grep picoCTF
    # picoCTF{grep_and_you_will_find_52e63a9f}
# net cat (75pts)
## 题目
Using netcat (nc) will be a necessity throughout your adventure. Can you
connect to `2018shell2.picoctf.com` at port `36356` to get the flag?
> Hints:  
>  nc [tutorial](https://linux.die.net/man/1/nc)
## 题解
主要是学习nc的用法. 连上之后就可以看到flag.
    nc 2018shell2.picoctf.com 36356
# strings (100pts)
## 题目
Can you find the flag in this file [1] without actually running it? You can
also find the file in /problems/strings_4_40d221755b4a0b134c2a7a2e825ef95f on
the shell server.
> Hints:  
>  [strings](https://linux.die.net/man/1/strings)
## 题解
主要是熟悉linux下的`strings`工具
    strings strings|grep pico
    # picoCTF{sTrIngS_sAVeS_Time_d3ffa29c}
# pipe (110pts)
## 题目
During your adventure, you will likely encounter a situation where you need to
process data that you receive over the network rather than through a file. Can
you find a way to save the output from this program and search for the flag?

> Hints:  
>  (1) Remember the flag format is picoCTF{XXXX} (2) Ever heard of a pipe? No
> not that kind of pipe... This [kind [1]](http://www.linfo.org/pipes.html)
## 题解
熟悉linux里面管道的原理以及操作
    nc 2018shell2.picoctf.com 2015 | grep pico
    # picoCTF{almost_like_mario_8861411c}
# grep 2 (125pts)
## 题目
This one is a little bit harder. Can you find the flag in
/problems/grep-2_4_06c2058761f24267033e7ca6ff9d9144/files on the shell server?
Remember, grep is your friend.
> Hints:  
>  grep [tutorial](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/grep.php)
## 题解
连上题目服务器, 进入到指定文件夹之后发现有很多的文件夹, flag就藏在某个文件夹的某个文件里面, 查阅grep的文档,
发现`-r`参数可以递归探测目录. 于是在题目目录运行命令
    grep 'pico' -r .
    # ./files2/file3:picoCTF{grep_r_and_you_will_find_036bbb25}
得到flag.
# Aca-Shell-A (150pts)
## 题目
It's never a bad idea to brush up on those linux skills or even learn some new
ones before you set off on this adventure! Connect with nc
2018shell2.picoctf.com 6903.

## 题解
题目是一个游戏, 主要考察基本linux命令的使用.  
连上之后首先输出一大段话
    Sweet! We have gotten access into the system but we aren't root.
    It's some sort of restricted shell! I can't see what you are typing
    but I can see your output. I'll be here to help you along.
    If you need help, type "echo 'Help Me!'" and I'll see what I can do
    There is not much time left!
这是个很有意思的shell, 它可以根据shell的输入来执行命令, 而不是你的输入. 我们`echo 'Help Me!'`来看一下
    You got this! Have you looked for any  directories?
提示看一下目录, 于是我们`ls`
    blackmail
    executables
    passwords
    photos
    secret
看到五个目录, 有个`secret`目录引人注目, `cd`进入
    Now we are cookin'! Take a look around there and tell me what you find!
继续`ls`
    intel_1
    intel_2
    intel_3
    intel_4
    intel_5
    profile_ahqueith5aekongieP4ahzugi
    profile_ahShaighaxahMooshuP1johgo
    profile_aik4hah9ilie9foru0Phoaph0
    profile_AipieG5Ua9aewei5ieSoh7aph
    profile_bah9Ech9oa4xaicohphahfaiG
    profile_ie7sheiP7su2At2ahw6iRikoe
    profile_of0Nee4laith8odaeLachoonu
    profile_poh9eij4Choophaweiwev6eev
    profile_poo3ipohGohThi9Cohverai7e
    profile_Xei2uu5suwangohceedaifohs
    Sabatoge them! Get rid of all their intel files!
最后一句告诉我们删掉所有的`intel`文件, 于是`rm intel*`
    Nice! Once they are all gone, I think I can drop you a file of an exploit!
    Just type "echo 'Drop it in!' " and we can give it a whirl!
接着按照提示`echo 'Drop it in!'`
    I placed a file in the executables folder as it looks like the only place we can execute from!
    Run the script I wrote to have a little more impact on the system!
按照提示`cd ..`到上层目录, 再进入`executables`目录, `./dontLookHere`运行可执行程序, 输出一大堆十六进制,
貌似是为了看起来很牛逼, 最后有一段文字是提示
    Looking through the text above, I think I have found the password. I am just having trouble with a username.
    Oh drats! They are onto us! We could get kicked out soon!
    Quick! Print the username to the screen so we can close are backdoor and log into the account directly!
    You have to find another way other than echo!
意思就是要输出用户名, 但是`echo`不能用了, 查阅Linux文档, 发现可以用`whoami`输出用户名, 于是
    l33th4x0r
    Perfect! One second!
    Okay, I think I have got what we are looking for. I just need to to copy the file to a place we can read.
    Try copying the file called TopSecret in tmp directory into the passwords folder.
按照提示, `cp /tmp/TopSecret ../passwords`
    Server shutdown in 10 seconds...
    Quick! go read the file before we lose our connection!
最后进入到 `passwords`目录, `cat TopSecret`得到flag
    picoCTF{CrUsHeD_It_dddcec58}
# environ (150pts)
## 题目
Sometimes you have to configure environment variables before executing a
program. Can you find the flag we've hidden in an environment variable on the
shell server?
> Hints:  
>  unix [env](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-environment.htm)
## 题解
主要是熟悉unix下的环境变量. 我们连上题目服务器后, 运行`env|grep pico|cut -d '=' -f2`, 得到flag
    mads@pico-2018-shell-2:~$ env|grep pico|cut -d '=' -f2
    picoCTF{eNv1r0nM3nT_v4r14Bl3_fL4g_3758492}
# ssh-keyz (150pts)
## 题目
As nice as it is to use our webshell, sometimes its helpful to connect
directly to our machine. To do so, please add your own public key to
~/.ssh/authorized_keys, using the webshell. The flag is in the ssh banner
which will be displayed when you login remotely with ssh to with your
username.
