User: Analyze the current security loopholes in the company's network and propose corresponding repair solutions.
Assistant: Security gaps in corporate networks: 1. Weak passwords: Many employees use easy-to-guess passwords or reuse the same passwords when creating passwords, which makes it easier for attackers to gain access to the network. 2. Social engineering attacks: Attackers may use techniques such as forced entry, phishing, and fraud to trick employees into handing over email accounts, passwords, and other sensitive information. 3. Application Vulnerabilities: There may be weak security configurations and vulnerabilities in applications that could be exploited by hackers to break into the network and access sensitive data. 4. Unauthorized devices: Computers, mobile devices, USB drives, and other USB devices, etc. Unauthorized devices can be a security hole. Fixes: 1. Mandatory employees to use complex passwords and reset passwords after a period of time. Known or commonly used passwords are not allowed. 2. Educate employees to be aware of social engineering, update phishing and fraud attack methods in a timely manner, and remind employees to protect important information. 3. To ensure the security of the application, even if the application has no vulnerabilities found before, they should be updated and checked regularly to ensure that they are not vulnerable to attack. 4. Use intrusion detection and system protection software to check all devices, prevent unauthorized devices from entering the network, and detect and block potential attacks in time.
