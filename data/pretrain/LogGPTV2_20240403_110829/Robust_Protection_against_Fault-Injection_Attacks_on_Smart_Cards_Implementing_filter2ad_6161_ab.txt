Robust codes can be used to extend the error coverage 
of any linear prediction scheme for AES.  Only two extra 
cubic  networks  are  needed,  one  in  the  extended  device, 
and  one  in  the  Error  Detection  Network  (EDN).    The 
architecture of AES with robust protection is presented in 
Figure 1. 
In the architecture in Figure 1 a single linear predictor 
is  assumed  for 
the  encryptor,  decryptor,  and  key 
expansion.    The  same  architecture  can  be  extended  to 
architectures, which would have separate linear predictors 
for  all  the  devices.    (Note  that  in  this  context  a  linear 
predictor  is  such  that  it  generates  a  signature,  which  is  a 
linear combination of the outputs of the round.  It does not

linear  predictor  offers  a 
relatively compact design, which allows for easy hardware 
sharing  for  encryption  and  decryption  prediction.    The 
single  predictor  is  designed  so  that  it  protects  the 
encryptor/decryptor  as  well  as  key-expansion. 
  The 
complete design of the linear predictor can be found in the 
next section.   
5. Detailed design of the linear predictor 
The output of the linear predictor is linearly related to 
the  output  of 
the  round  of  AES  (see  Figure  2).  
Specifically,  each  byte  of  the  linear  predictor’s  output 
  is  equivalent  to  the  componentwise  XOR  of  four 
L j
'( )
bytes of the output of a round (see Figure 3 for summary 
of the notations used): 
In  this  method  the  function  of  each  byte  of 
L j
'( )
  no 
longer contains the MixColumns transformation [16].  As 
a  result,  the  linear  predictor  is  greatly  simplified  since  it 
no longer needs to perform multiplications associated with 
the  MixColumns/InvMixColumns  (see  [16]).    The  details 
of the simplification are listed below.
