The exact engine we use needs further discussion. Probably we don't want to
use yarr because it requires the nitro jit, which is a big dependency and
could be undesirable for various reasons. Ideally, we would have a nice syntax
extension that precompiles the regexes (in addition to runtime compilation
options).
