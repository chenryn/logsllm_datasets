User: The following is 20 lines of a system log. Each line consists of a timestamp, log level, process id, relevant software component, and the log content. Think step-by-step and step and summarize this log chunk:

Assistant: This log chunk shows the storage.BlockManager finding a block locally, followed by the PythonRunner logging times for various tasks. After that, the Executor logs that it has finished four tasks in stage 2 and sends the results to the driver. Finally, the CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend assigns four tasks in stage 3 and the TorrentBroadcast starts reading a broadcast variable.
