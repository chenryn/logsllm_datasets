**Current behavior**  
According to Victor Savkin article when using the OnPush strategy if the
component Input does not change, there is no need to check the componentâ€™s
template. But in my example when I am clicking on the trigger button and the
Input does not change the _ngAfterViewChecked_ hook still running.
**Expected behavior**  
The _ngAfterViewChecked_ in the component should not run.
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**  
This is a working plunker.
