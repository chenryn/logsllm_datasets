**Current Behavior**  
According to Victor Savkin's article, when using the OnPush change detection strategy, if the component's input does not change, there is no need to check the componentâ€™s template. However, in my example, even when I click the trigger button and the input does not change, the `ngAfterViewChecked` lifecycle hook still runs.

**Expected Behavior**  
The `ngAfterViewChecked` lifecycle hook should not run if the component's input has not changed.
