## Abstract
Online service providers are in a constant battle with malicious actors who attempt to divert legitimate traffic for illicit profits. This study examines the abuse of "trending" search terms, where attackers place links to malware-distributing or ad-filled websites in web search and Twitter results. We collected and analyzed data over nine months from multiple sources. Our heuristics identified ad-filled sites, and we reported on the prevalence of malware and ad-filled sites in trending-term search results, as well as the success rates in blocking such content. Using network analysis, we uncovered collusion across offending domains and used regression analysis to determine that both malware and ad-filled sites thrive on less popular and less profitable trending terms. We developed an economic model based on our measurements, concluding that ad-filled sites and malware distribution may be economic substitutes. Additionally, our measurement interval included February 2011, when Google announced changes to its ranking algorithm to combat low-quality sites, allowing us to assess the impact of search-engine intervention on the profits of these malicious actors.

## 1. Introduction
News spreads rapidly, with blogs and other websites typically picking up a news story within about 2.5 hours after it is reported by traditional media [21]. This leads to a continuous supply of new "trending" topics, which are amplified across the Internet before fading away relatively quickly.

The initial moments after a story breaks present a window of opportunity for attackers to infiltrate web and social network search results. The primary motivation is financial, as high-ranking websites in response to trending terms can receive significant traffic, which can be monetized in various ways [6, 10, 17, 20]. Manipulating web or social network search engine results can thus be a profitable enterprise for perpetrators.

Many sites designed to respond to trending terms aim to generate revenue through advertisements without providing original content or services. For example, eworldpost.com, which appeared in response to 549 trending terms between July 2010 and March 2011, dedicates a large portion of its screen real estate to ads (Figure 1). Such sites are often referred to as "Made for AdSense" (MFA) after the Google advertising platform they target. Whether this activity is deemed criminal or merely a nuisance depends on the tactics used to boost the site's search rankings. Some sites have more sinister motives, such as distributing malware or selling fake antivirus software [2, 8, 30, 36].

Both MFA and malware-hosting sites are significant enough threats to prompt responses from search engine operators. Google modified its search algorithm in February 2011 to combat MFA sites [35] and has long offered the Google Safe Browsing API to block malware-distribution sites. Trending-term exploitation makes both MFA and malware sites even more dynamic, complicating the task of defenders.

This paper provides the first large-scale measurement and analysis of trending-term exploitation on the web. Based on a collection of over 60 million search results and tweets gathered over nine months, we characterize how trending terms are used for web search-engine manipulation and social-network spam. An important feature of our work is that we use publicly observable data from different web search engines (Google, Yahoo!/Bing) and social networks (Twitter).

Our specific contributions include:
1. A methodology to automate the classification of websites as MFA.
2. Salient differences between tactics used by MFA site operators and malware peddlers.
3. An economic model to characterize the trade-offs between advertising and malware as monetization vectors, quantifying the potential profit to perpetrators.
4. An examination of the impact of possible intervention strategies.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces our measurement and classification methodology. Section 3 analyzes the collected data to characterize trending-term exploitation on the web. Section 4 builds an economic model of attacker revenue, and Section 5 examines the effect of search-engine intervention. Section 6 compares our study with related work, and Section 7 draws brief conclusions.

## 2. Methodology
### 2.1 Data Collection
We describe our methodology for data collection and website classification. At a high level, we need to issue queries on various search engines for current trending terms, follow the links obtained, and classify the websites as malicious or benign. Within the collection of malicious sites, we further distinguish between malware-hosting and ad-laden sites. We also compare the results with those from "ordinary" rather than trending terms.

#### 2.1.1 Building Query Corpora
Building a corpus of trending terms is not inherently challenging. Google, through Google Hot Trends [15], provides a list of twenty current "hot searches," updated hourly. Twitter and Yahoo! also provide lists of trending topics. These lists sometimes have little overlap, but combining them can yield more than 40 distinct trending terms over short intervals. However, all search APIs limit the rate at which queries can be issued, so we face a trade-off between the time granularity of our measurements and the size of our query corpus.

**Trending Set:** We focus on Google Hot Trends, as a recent study [17] shows that over 95% of the terms used in search engine manipulation belong to this list. For Twitter, we use both Google Hot Trends and Twitter's current trending topics.

**Control Set:** We build a control list of the most popular search terms in 2010 according to Google Insights for Search [13], resulting in 495 unique search terms.

#### 2.1.2 Data Collection
For each term in our trending and control sets, we run automated searches on Google and Yahoo! between July 24, 2010, and April 24, 2011. We use the Google Web Search API [1] to pull the top 32 search results and the Yahoo! BOSS API to fetch the top 100 results. We also use the Twitter Atom API to retrieve the top 16 tweets for each term.

To understand the trade-offs between search frequency and coverage, we conducted a pilot experiment. Sampling once every 20 minutes, rather than every 10 minutes, caused only 4% of Google search results to be missed. Slower intervals caused slightly more sites to be missed, but 85% of the search results found when reissuing the query every 10 minutes could also be retrieved by sampling every 4 hours. For consistency, we used the same interval on Twitter despite the higher miss rate.

#### 2.1.3 Website Classification
We classify websites as benign, malware-distributing, or ad-filled. We define a website as a set of pages hosted on the same second-level DNS domain. 

**Malware-Distributing Sites:** We pass all search results to Googleâ€™s Safe Browsing API, which checks URLs against a blacklist. We keep checking the results for 14 days after the term is no longer hot. If a URL appears in the results and is later added to the blacklist, we assume it was already malicious but undetected. 

**MFA Sites:** Automated identification of MFA sites is challenging. We investigated 6,558 websites that appeared in the search results for at least 20 different trending terms. We manually inspected a statistically significant random sample of 363 websites and identified five broad categories of MFA sites. All MFA sites include mechanisms for automatically updating the topics they cover, with differences in how the content is presented.

1. **Content Aggregators:** Sites that reuse snippets created by search engines and provide direct links to external sites with original content.
2. **Blog-Style Sites:** Sites in blog format with short paragraphs of content likely copied and slightly tweaked by machine algorithms.
3. **Product Sites:** Sites that automatically update to new products for sale, pointing to stores through paid advertisements.
4. **Content Framers:** Sites that aggregate content by loading external websites into a frame, keeping users on the site along with their ads.
