User: I am developing a twisted server. I need to control the memory usage. It is not a good idea to modify code, insert some memory logging command and restart the server. I think it is better to use a "remote console", so that I can type heapy command and see the response from the server directly. All I need is a remote console, I can build one by myself, but I don't like to rebuild a wheel. My question is: is there already any remote console for twisted?
Thanks.
