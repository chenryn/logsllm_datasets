#### Evaluation Metrics
We consider three key evaluation metrics:
1. **Detection Probability**: The probability of successfully detecting a generated attack flow.
2 - **False Positive Probability on Small Flows**: The probability of incorrectly identifying a small flow as an attack when the link is under attack by flows of a certain rate.
3. **Incubation Period**: The time required to detect a generated attack flow from its generation.

### Experimental Comparison

**Figure 5(a) and 5(b)** show the detection probability for different types of attack flows. We focus on the scenario using 55 * 2 counters in FMF and AMF, as the results for 250 * 2 counters are similar. In Figure 5(b), the THh line indicates whether a bursty flow exceeds the high-bandwidth threshold. The results confirm that EARDet detects attack flows with 100% detection probability, supporting Theorem 4. Conversely, FMF fails to catch most of the Shrew flows. Additionally, EARDet can detect most attack flows in the ambiguity region (between THℓ(t) and THh(t)).

**Figures 6(a) to 6(h)** illustrate the false positive (FP) rates. EARDet consistently shows zero FPs in all scenarios, as expected. However, Figures 6(a) to 6(d) reveal that both FMF and AMF exhibit high FP rates in both attack scenarios when using limited memory, similar to EARDet. This means the attacker can successfully incriminate benign small flows. Under flooding attacks, the FP rate can reach up to 4% for FMF and 1% for AMF, while for Shrew attacks, FMF's FP rate is also extremely high. An interesting observation is that in Figure 6(a), both FMF and AMF have higher FP rates when the link is congested by malicious small flows. Figures 6(e) to 6(h) show that increasing the number of counters in FMF and AMF can reduce, but not eliminate, the FP rates. The CAIDA dataset results follow similar trends.

In our experiments, EARDet consistently produces similar results regardless of link congestion. In contrast, the results for AMF and FMF differ significantly between congested and non-congested links. This supports the conclusion in Section 5.1 that AMF and FMF rely on the number of active flows, whereas EARDet does not. This advantage makes EARDet stable in any networking environment.

### Incubation Period

Figure 7 describes the maximum and average incubation periods for high-rate flows with different rates during flooding attacks. The maximum incubation period for flows exceeding γh is always below the theoretical upper bound (tupincb), supporting Theorem 7. Furthermore, the average incubation period is much lower than the theoretical upper bound, demonstrating that EARDet's actual incubation period is significantly shorter.

### Related Work

Section 2.1 classifies prior work on detecting large flows and the closely related problem of finding frequent items based on the types of monitoring windows. Cormode and Hadjieleftheriou [9] provide a comprehensive survey and comparison of algorithms for finding frequent items. This section reviews prior approaches based on the techniques used. Most existing methods rely on specific window types and memory constraints, which can affect their performance in various network environments.
